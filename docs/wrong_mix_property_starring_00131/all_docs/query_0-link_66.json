        "text": "PRP's Statement on Wisconsin AG's Opinion Regarding Election Administration\n\nOn June 25, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul issued a legal opinion clarifying the state’s new constitutional provision, Article III § 7(2), which prohibits non-election officials from performing “task[s] in the conduct of . . . election[s].” The provision, approved by voters in April, caused confusion and concern among Wisconsin clerks. AG Kaul’s opinion helps to ameliorate that concern by adopting the interpretation of Article III § 7(2) advocated in Dane County’s original request for an opinion and in a comment Public Rights Project (PRP) submitted on behalf of a coalition of 18 municipal clerks. Specifically, the Attorney General’s opinion makes clear that while only “election officials” as defined in Wisconsin statute can play a role in “directing or leading the administration of [an] election,” election officials may continue to rely on vendors, other government employees, and volunteers to perform other election-related activities necessary to ensure free and secure elections.\n\nUntil now, many clerks feared that Article III § 7(2) could be interpreted to prohibit them from relying on other government agencies, vendors, and volunteers as they have in past elections. Clerks’ offices, for instance, often contract with voting machine vendors to provide real-time technical assistance on election day, rely on law enforcement for transportation of sealed ballots, receive digital security assistance from county or private IT experts, or enlist volunteers and city employees to help set up tables and voting booths at polling locations. It would be nearly impossible for clerks to efficiently conduct secure elections without any reliance on any outside entities. AG Kaul’s opinion recognizes this reality, and the fact that Article III § 7(2) was intended to prevent outside actors from playing a management role in election administration. Although Wisconsin courts are not required to follow an AG opinion, they often do so.\n\n“We applaud Attorney General Kaul for his thoughtful and thorough opinion,” said Graham Provost, staff attorney for Public Rights Project’s Election Protection Hub. “The opinion does exactly what we had hoped for. It adopts the most legally compelling interpretation of Article III § 7(2), and provides Wisconsin clerks with the certainty they need to do their jobs and effectively administer this year’s elections.”\n\nA copy of the AG’s opinion is available here. A copy of PRP’s comment to the AG is available here.\n\nO’Halloran v. Benson (2024)\n\nPublic Rights Project (PRP) filed a friend-of-the court (amicus) brief on behalf of a coalition of Michigan election clerks urging the state Supreme Court to uphold guidance on managing election challengers in O’Halloran v. Benson. The guidance seeks to empower local election officials to maintain order and to protect the right to vote, especially in the face of concern that election deniers will abuse the process to slow down voting on Election Day. As argued in the brief, the manual does not alter the rights or opportunities of legitimate challengers to raise questions about voter registration when they are acting in good faith and relying on factual information.\n\nSignatories include clerks in Ingham County, Delta Township, Genesee County, Romulus City, Washtenaw County, City of Westland, Canton Township, and Lansing City.\n\nSecretary of State Jocelyn Benson issued the guidance in 2022 to address growing concerns about the misuse of the election challenger process to intimidate voters, disenfranchise voters through undue delay, cause chaos and confusion in polling places and counting centers, and unfairly call the integrity of elections into question without basis. The Secretary’s guidance includes straightforward updates intended to empower local election officials to guard against such subversion. As argued by PRP’s coalition of clerks, the challenged provisions of the guidance align with Michigan law and fall squarely within the Secretary’s authority.\n\nChallengers play an important role in promoting confidence in the integrity of our elections, but their role is intended to be modest. Challenges can only be mounted with specific information about an individual’s eligibility to vote. The bases for these challenges are narrow. However, there are groups in Michigan seeking to misuse the challenge process by challenging hundreds of voters at a time. Several clerks received challenges relating to large numbers of voters in advance of the primary and general elections in 2022. The Secretary’s guidance helps clerks deal with these issues and more.\n\n2024.06.10 - O’Halloran v. Benson\n\nRyan v. Federal Trade Commission & ATS Tree Service v. FTC (Noncompete Rule Challenges)\n\nPublic Rights Project filed a brief on behalf of 12 state and local officials throughout Texas to push back on efforts by the Chamber of Commerce and others to stop the FTC's rule banning noncompete agreements.\n\nNon-competes are contracts that limit a worker's ability to work in their region or field for a period of time after they stop working for a particular employer. These agreements have been spreading across industries--from janitorial work to fast food to beauty services to health care, and keep workers from being able to leave for a better job or to start their own business, negotiate for better wages and working conditions, and stand up for their rights.\n\nShortly after the FTC finalized its rule, the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups filed a lawsuit in the federal district court moved to stop the rule from taking effect as scheduled. Now, Judge Ada Brown of the Northern District of Texas is soon deciding that motion.\n\nOur brief focuses on the various harms noncompetes cause, such as preventing the formation and growth of small businesses, interfering with innovation, reducing access to health care, and lowering wages. Additionally, the brief emphasizes that employers have other effective mechanisms to serve the legitimate purposes of noncompete agreements--namely, nondisclosure agreements and protections for trade secrets and other intellectual property.\n\n2024.05.31- Ryan v. Federal Trade Commission\n\nUPDATE (6/14/2024): PRP filed a brief on behalf of Pennsylvania state and local elected officials in an additional challenge to the FTC's noncompete rule, in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n\n2024.06.14- ATS Tree Service v. Federal Trade Commission\n\nComment of Election Officials on Interpreting Article III § 7(2) of the Wisconsin Constitution\n\nPublic Rights Project (PRP) recently filed a comment with the Wisconsin Attorney General on behalf of a coalition of current election officials. The comment supports Dane County’s request for a legal opinion providing guidance on the proper interpretation of Wisconsin’s new constitutional provision, Article III § 7(2), which has caused confusion and concern among Wisconsin clerks. PRP’s Election Protection Hub seeks to ensure a clear and narrow interpretation of Article III § 7(2) that allows local election officials to continue to do their jobs and effectively administer elections.\n\nSignatories are municipal clerks serving the City of Green Bay, City of Janesville, City of Lake Geneva, City of Madison, City of Milton, City of Milwaukee, City of Oconomowoc, City of Oshkosh, City of Sun Prairie, City of Wausau, City of West Bend, Town of Clayton, Town of Exeter, Town of Omro, Town of Vermont, Town of Woodruff, Village of Cottage Grove, and Village of Greenville.\n\nArticle III § 7(2) of the Wisconsin Constitution—enacted through a referendum on the April presidential primary ballot—prohibits any “individual other than an election official designated by law” from “perform[ing] any task in the conduct of any primary, election, or referendum.” The stated purpose of the amendment was to ensure that election officials retain control over the conduct of elections and do not delegate that authority to unaccountable third parties. But because of the vague language of the amendment, clerks fear the amendment could be misinterpreted to prohibit them from obtaining essential products and services from vendors, volunteers, and other government agencies, rendering effective election administration nearly impossible.\n\nRunning an efficient, secure, and safe election takes more than a village, a town, a city, or a county. Clerks rely on other government agencies, vendors, and volunteers for a wide variety of products and services. Many clerks’ offices contract with voting machine vendors to provide real-time technical assistance on Election Day, rely on law enforcement for transportation of sealed ballots, or enlist volunteers and city employees to help set up tables and voting booths at polling locations. To prepare for elections, clerks may also participate in trainings about best practices conducted by experts, seek legal advice from attorneys, or consult about technology security with the county and private IT experts, none of whom are sworn election officials. The PRP comment argues that these interactions are necessary to ensure that elections run smoothly and securely and should be permitted under a proper interpretation Article III § 7(2). It further argues that without guidance from the Attorney General, uncertainty about the provision will undermine the administration of this year’s primary and general elections.\n\n2024.05.13- Comment of Election Officials on Interpreting Article III § 7(2) of the Wisconsin Constitution\n\nComments on: TMB Rules §§ 165.7-165.9, Exceptions to Abortion Ban\n\nTexas has three state laws banning abortions, creating one of the most restrictive abortion landscapes in the country. While the laws contain an exception for the life and health of the pregnant person, Texas’s hostile abortion landscape, the threat of criminal prosecution, and vague and inconsistent language in the exception has deterred Texas physicians from providing their patients with necessary abortion care, even in emergency circumstances. Abortion providers and patients have sued the state for clarity regarding the emergency exception to its abortion ban, but the law remains vague.\n\nMore recently, the Texas Medical Board (TMB) prosed a new rule (§§ 165.7-165.9) in an attempt to provide some guidance to providers regarding the scope of the state’s medical emergency exception for abortion care. The TMB’s rule comes in direct response to the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in Cox v. Texas, where the Court denied Kate Cox’s request to obtain an emergency abortion and emphasized the TMB’s authority to provide clarity and address the existing confusion regarding the state’s medical emergency exception. The TMB has also previously received requests from hospitals, doctors, and advocates for clarity.\n\nPublic Rights Project submitted a comment to the Texas Medical Board on behalf of 15 local elected officials that opposes the rule. Despite the requests and need for guidance, the proposed rule fails to provide proper guidance regarding “reasonable medical judgment” and imposes greater documentation requirements for providers which will complicate, rather than clarify, the preconditions required for a physician to provide an emergency abortion.\n\n2024.05.05- Comments on: Texas Medical Board, Exceptions to Abortion\n\nPima County Attorney Joins in Asking Arizona Supreme Court to Stay Its Ruling in Planned Parenthood Arizona v. Mayes\n\nPublic Rights Project’s client Pima County Attorney Laura Conover joined in support of Planned Parenthood Arizona’s request that the Arizona Supreme Court stay the issuance of its mandate until the State Legislature’s recent repeal of A.R.S. § 13-3603 takes effect. The motion to the Supreme Court seeks to prevent Arizona’s 1864 abortion law from disrupting access to abortion care in the state.\n\nThis longstanding lawsuit was first filed in the 1970s and named the Pima County Attorney as a defendant. In 1973, following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade, the Arizona Court of Appeals entered an injunction halting enforcement of A.R.S. § 13-3603. In April 2024, however, the Supreme Court of Arizona ruled that following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, A.R.S. § 13-3603 is enforceable.\n\nOn May 1, 2024, the Arizona Senate passed House Bill 2677, repealing the state’s 160-year-old near-total abortion ban, three weeks after the state Supreme Court revived the law. The vote comes one week after the Arizona House of Representatives successfully voted to repeal the law. On May 2, 2024, Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs signed the repeal into law.\n\nBecause the repeal may not take effect until 90 days after the end of the legislative session this year, Public Rights Project and the Pima County Attorney’s Office, along with Planned Parenthood of Arizona, are asking the Supreme Court to refrain from issuing its mandate to prevent a temporary gap in access to abortion care before the repeal goes into effect.\n\nThe request highlights the demonstrated intent of the Arizona legislature to stop the antiquated 1864 abortion restrictions from being enforced, as well as important considerations like attention to real-world consequences to avoid unnecessary turmoil for pregnant Arizonans.\n\n2024.02.05- Planned Parenthood Arizona v. Mayes\n\nEl Koussa v. Campbell\n\nUber, Lyft, and other app-based companies have introduced 5 ballot initiatives to appear before Massachusetts voters in November 2024. Each initiative attempts to classify app-based drivers as contractors rather than employees. That independent status would block drivers from various legal protections including minimum wage, paid sick time, unemployment insurance, and worker’s compensation and would limit the companies’ liability for accidents by their drivers. These app-based companies are attempting to confuse and deceive voters with these 5 ballot questions in order to strip drivers of various rights.\n\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Court blocked two similar measures from appearing on the ballot in 2022, conclusion its inclusion of multiple areas of law in a single question would be confusing and unfair to voters.\n\nThis amicus brief focuses on the animating principle behind Article 48 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution--preventing voter confusion. Furthermore, the brief contextualizes these initiatives within app-based companies' established history of deceiving consumers, workers, and regulators.\n\n2024.26.04- El Koussa v. Campbell\n\nPriorities USA v. Wisconsin Elections Commissions (SCoWI)\n\nPublic Rights Project — on behalf of a coalition of ten Wisconsin county and municipal election officials — filed an amicus brief urging the Wisconsin Supreme Court to reinstate ballot drop boxes, essential to effectively administering the 2024 presidential election, after banning them in 2022. Oral arguments are scheduled in the Wisconsin drop box case, Priorities USA v. Wisconsin Election Commission, for May 13.\n\nSixty-six of Wisconsin’s 72 counties, or 91%, used drop boxes in 2020 — as did 39 states — without significant issues. Absentee ballot usage skyrocketed during the pandemic with 40% of these voters using drop boxes. Since then, drop boxes have been a target of lawsuits and unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud.\n\nIn 2022, the Wisconsin Supreme Court prohibited unstaffed drop boxes, holding that absentee voters could only return their ballots via the mail or by submitting their ballots directly to their municipal clerk or the clerk’s staff. The brief outlines three key reasons why ballot drop boxes benefit both voters and election clerks: drop boxes are secure, drop boxes are convenient for voters and local elections officials, and drop boxes ensure ballots are counted.\n\n2024.18.04- Priorities USA v. Wisconsin Elections Commissions (SCoWI)\n\nNAACP v. Schmidt\n\nIn March, a three-judge panel of the court held that federal law does not prohibit Pennsylvania from requiring election officials to reject mail-in ballots that are received on time, but are either missing a date on their return envelope or marked with an “incorrect” date (such as an incomplete date or a voter’s birthday).\n\nThe Voting Rights Act prohibits refusing to count a person’s vote based on an “error or omission” on a voting-related “record or paper” that is not “material in determining” a person’s qualifications to vote. The plaintiffs argued that this rule, known as the Materiality Provision, protects voters from having their otherwise-valid votes discounted based on technicalities like the envelope-date requirement (which is irrelevant to whether a ballot is considered timely). The district court agreed. The panel at the Court of Appeals in this case, however, held that this provision only applies to a state’s determination of who may vote, overturning the lower court’s decision and allowing the regulation to stand.\n\nThe goal of PRP’s brief is to urge the Third Circuit to rehear the case en banc, allowing all of the active judges on the court to rehear the case, and potentially overturn the panel’s decision. It will be filed in support of requests for rehearing from the ACLU and the Department of State.\n\nThe brief explains what is at stake for state and local election officials in this case. Election officials have an interest in making sure that all eligible citizens in their jurisdiction can exercise the right to vote. Forcing election officials to screen and discard ballots based on immaterial errors requires them to expend time and other resources to ensure that every eligible vote in their jurisdiction will be counted. It also creates more potential for errors, ambiguity, and inconsistency at a time when election administrators are under intense scrutiny.\n\n2024.17.04- NAACP v. Schmidt\n\nBoston v. State of Georgia - Challenge to O.C.G.A. § 15-18-32\n\nA bipartisan group of Georgia district attorneys filed a lawsuit challenging O.C.G.A. § 15-18-32, an anti-democratic statute that undermines prosecutorial discretion. Represented by Public Rights Project, Washington, Dreyer, and Associates, and Bruce P. Brown Law, Plaintiffs seek an interlocutory injunction to prevent the newly empowered Prosecuting Attorneys’ Qualifications Commission (“PAQC”) from opening any investigations or pursuing disciplinary measures against these elected DAs.\n\nThe Georgia law—amended in 2024 by the General Assembly to remove Georgia Supreme Court oversight—creates novel obligations for and discipline of local prosecutors, undermining their independence and threatening local democracy. Discretion is a structural element of a prosecutor’s job. DAs are elected by a local community to make decisions on whom to prosecute, what charges to bring, and which sentences to seek in order to promote safety and justice in their communities. The statute gives the PAQC the authority to investigate and remove prosecutors from office on the basis of these decisions. The members of the PAQC, who were all appointed by partisan executive and legislative officials, set their own standards for investigation and discipline. This statute is part of a nationwide trend of states adopting laws to infringe on the discretion of local prosecutors pursuing criminal justice reforms.\n\nShortly after the PAQC began operation, Public Rights Project filed this litigation to combat the State's attempt to undermine the will of Georgia voters and the independence of the prosecutors they elect. The lawsuit by District Attorney Sherry Boston of Stone Mountain (DeKalb County) Judicial Circuit, Towaliga District Attorney Jonathan Adams, and Augusta District Attorney Jared Williams asserts that O.C.G.A. § 15-18-32 and the PAQC’s improperly promulgated rules violate the separation of powers doctrine and the First Amendment and unconstitutionally infringe upon Plaintiff’s prosecutorial discretion and democratic ideals.\n\n2024.16.04- Boston v. State of Georgia\n\nPetersen v. Fontes\n\nPublic Rights Project and Protect Democracy — on behalf of a coalition of current and former election officials and administrators — filed an amicus brief in Petersen v. Fontes in the Maricopa County Superior Court. The brief urges the court to reject challenges to the 2023 Arizona Election Procedures Manual (EPM) brought by Arizona State Senate President Warren Petersen and Speaker of the House Ben Toma.\n\nThe lawsuit is part of a national trend of unprecedented legal challenges to undermine and disrupt elections administration across the country ahead of the 2024 presidential election. The new brief argues that the EPM provides crucial guidance to local election officials, fills gaps in existing laws, resolves ambiguities, and ensures that officials are able to implement fair and uniform election processes. Petersen and Toma contend that several provisions in the EPM incorrectly interpret state and federal law, and are seeking court intervention to block its use during this year’s election cycle.\n\nThe brief argues that the 2023 EPM plays a vital role in ensuring a smooth 2024 election cycle. Not only have election laws changed since the last EPM was issued in 2019, but election administrators have already used the 2023 EMP for the Presidential Preference Election. Additionally, they are training staff, allocating resources, and preparing for the July Primary Election and November General Election based on the 2023 EPM.\n\nThe brief also defends two key EPM provisions. The first prevents county boards of supervisors from changing vote totals or delaying certification of elections. The second protects against frivolous challenges to voter citizenship, based not on evidence but on factors like race or political party. The brief argues that these two provisions are both legally correct and practically important for election officials seeking to conduct fair and efficient elections.\n\n2024.25.03- Petersen v. Fontes\n\nBlack Voters Matter Capacity Building Institute, Inc. v. Byrd\n\nPublic Rights Project filed an amicus brief with the Florida Supreme Court on behalf of 31 current and former Florida elected officials. The brief urges the court to protect Black voters in North Florida by reinstating a pre-2022 congressional map that ensures a Black-voting district is included in the 2024 election.\n\nThe case, Black Voters Matter Capacity Building Institute, Inc. v. Byrd, raises important legal issues about the ability of communities of color to have meaningful and sustained representation at all levels of government in Florida. It challenges the Florida congressional districts that were redrawn in 2022, after Governor Ron DeSantis strong-armed the state legislature into eliminating the historically-Black Congressional District 5, spanning Jacksonville to Tennessee, which had been represented by Black elected officials in Congress since 1992.\n\nPRP’s brief speaks to the shared community of interest spanning Jacksonville to Tallahassee, especially among voters of color. Versions of this district have been represented in Congress by Black elected officials – Congressman Al Lawson and, previously, Congresswoman Corrine Brown – since 1992.\n\nAs the brief argues, eliminating Benchmark CD-5 unconstitutionally diminished the voting power of North Florida’s Black residents, a conclusion shared by the trial court. As a result, the new map should be altered to protect Black voters in the region. In the brief, the elected officials also argue that the First District Court of Appeals (DCA) applied an incorrect test when concluding that the benchmark district was improper and flawed.\n\nPRP’s amicus brief pushes back against this assessment by the First DCA and documents the extensive history of both racial oppression and resistance that have shaped North Florida. PRP asks the Florida Supreme Court to overturn the appeals court decision and reinstate the prior Congressional district map.\n\n2024.11.03- Black Voters Matter Capacity Building Institute, Inc. v. Byrd\n\nGenBioPro v. Raynes, Baltimore City and County Amicus Brief\n\nPublic Rights Project filed a brief on behalf of the City and County of Baltimore, Maryland in a fight to preserve access to medication abortion in West Virginia. The appeal pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit was filed by the generic manufacturer of mifepristone–GenBioPro–and challenges West Virginia’s deauthorization of this essential drug for reproductive healthcare. Our brief argued that West Virginia’s abortion bans and treatment of mifepristone overburden Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and Maryland’s health systems and funds because West Virginians are now forced to travel to Maryland for abortion care. Baltimore and Maryland’s clinics, providers, and funds have taken extraordinary measures to support out-of-staters seeking abortion care, but they do so while straining to meet the healthcare needs of their own residents. The brief explains that only the federal Food and Drug Administration has authority to restrict access to mifepristone and that West Virginia has improperly overstepped, causing great harm to its own residents and overburdening health systems regionally.\n\n2024.15.02- GenBioPro v. Raynes, Baltimore City and County Amicus Brief\n\nMifepristone Litigation – U.S. Supreme Court Amicus Brief\n\nPublic Rights Project filed amicus briefs on behalf of more than 100 local governments and local elected leaders in Food and Drug Administration, et al. v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, et al., a case pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. The case is an attack on access to mifepristone, one of two drugs most commonly used in medication abortion.\n\nIn the brief, PRP supports the FDA’s position that mifepristone is a safe and effective drug used for miscarriage management and medication abortion. Our amicus brief demonstrates clear flaws in the arguments challenging mifepristone, including the misuse of the federal courts for ideological interest: the plaintiffs in the case are not directly affected by mifepristone. The brief focuses on the flaws in plaintiffs’ standing and argues that the case should be dismissed.\n\nThis amicus brief also shows the significant harm the lower court rulings, if allowed to stand, will inflict on those residents’ access to essential healthcare, as well as on local governments’ health and social services systems. PRP has filed briefs at every appellate stage of this litigation, following a deeply flawed and controversial decision by the district court in early 2023.\n\n2024.01.30 Mifepristone Litigation – U.S. Supreme Court Amicus Brief\n\nTrump v. Anderson\n\nThis is a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, in which former President Donald Trump is appealing the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision ruling him ineligible to appear as a presidential candidate on the March 5, 2024 Republican primary ballot.\n\nBased on a challenge brought by a group of voters, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that President Trump was ineligible because of Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nPublic Rights Project has filed a brief on behalf of leading historians and in support of the voters who brought the challenge. Through a compelling historical narrative, the brief makes three important and clear points.\n\nThe framers intended Section Three: (1) to automatically disqualify insurrectionists; (2) to apply not only to the Civil War but also to future insurrections; and (3) to bar anyone who has betrayed an oath to uphold the Constitution from becoming President of the United States.\n\nThe brief relies on their extensive research on the period as well as crucial primary sources that inform the original public meaning of Section 3. In addition, the amicus brief rebuts misleading historical assertions made in briefs supporting President Trump.\n\n2024.01.29 Trump v. Anderson\n\nWarren v. DeSantis\n\nCase Update\n\nOn January 10, the federal Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit issued an important ruling (PDF) that affirmed the rights of elected prosecutors to make public statements about issues of public concern without fear of retribution.\n\nIn a case brought by suspended Hillsborough County, Florida (13th Judicial District) State Attorney Andrew Warren, the Court of Appeals found that joint letters expressing support for reproductive rights and transgender health were protected by the First Amendment.\n\nAs a result, the decision by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to suspend Warren in August 2022 might have violated the First Amendment. The case will be returned to the district court in Tallahassee for further consideration of the Governor’s motivation to suspend Warren from his position.\n\nPublic Rights Project filed an amicus brief (PDF) in support of Warren’s appeal and has been supporting Warren since early in the litigation.\n\n2024.01.10 Warren v. DeSantis – Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida\n\n——\n\nPRP filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in support of Florida prosecutor Andrew Warren’s lawsuit challenging his wrongful suspension by Governor Ron DeSantis on August 4, 2022. As a prosecutor, Warren sought to further the civil rights of the Hillsborough County, Florida residents that he served. He also joined with other prosecutors around the country to stand against attacks on reproductive healthcare and LGBTQ rights.\n\nThe district court determined that DeSantis’s purported reasons for suspending Warren were false and that all of the actual motivations were unlawful. In fact, DeSantis acted out of a combination of retaliation for First Amendment protected activities and political motives that were illegal under Florida law. Yet the district court still refused to reinstate Warren, based on a narrow interpretation of its authority.\n\nPRP’s brief highlights the core principle of democratic self-government that motivates both the Florida constitution and the First Amendment. This shared principle illustrates why the district court was wrong not to reinstate Warren. By allowing DeSantis’s decision to stand, the court disenfranchised the voters of Hillsborough County, who had twice chosen Warren as their prosecutor.\n\nPRP Legal Director Josh Rosenthal testified in support of a bill to improve voter registration in California before the California Senate Committee on Elections and Constitutional Amendments. SB 846, would streamline the state's automatic voter registration regime in an effort to register the estimated 4.6 million California citizens who are eligible to vote but not registered. The PRP testimony focused on the ways that this streamlined registration system would also help protect non-citizens from inadvertently registering to vote, and therefore risking deportation and criminal prosecution.\n\n2023.03.20 Warren v. DeSantis – Brief for Amicus Curiae Public Rights Project in Support of Appellant\n\nArkansas State Conference NAACP v. Arkansas Board of Apportionment\n\nPublic Rights Project filed an amicus brief in support of the Arkansas State Conference NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Panel’s petition for rehearing en banc of the Eighth Circuit’s November 20, 2023 problematic ruling that Section 2 of Voting Rights Act does not have a private right of action. The brief is on behalf of 42 local governments and leaders in support of the plaintiffs’ argument that the VRA allows private parties to file lawsuits. Kansas City Mayor Quinton D. Lucas led the brief on behalf of the local governments and leaders, and PRP received significant support from Ingham County, Michigan Clerk Barb Byrum.\n\nThe brief explains how the Eighth Circuit decision will undermine enforcement against discriminatory laws and practices impacting all election cycles and elected offices. The decision represents a radical change in interpretation of the VRA after nearly 60 years of private enforcement in federal courts throughout the country -- including hundreds of cases. No other court has ever reached the same conclusion, and it is essential to ensure that groups and individuals can continue to protect their rights through the courts.\n\n12/19/2023 - Arkansas State Conference NAACP - Eighth Circuit Amicus Brief\n\nNotice of Voluntary Dismissal — Boston v State\n\nPursuant to O.C.G.A. § 9-11-41(a)(1), the Plaintiffs to the above-captioned actions state as follows:\n\n1. In 2023, the General Assembly passed, and Governor Kemp signed into law, Senate Bill 92 (“SB 92”), which established the Prosecuting Attorneys Qualifications Commission (“PAQC”).\n\n2. Pursuant to SB 92, the PAQC has “the power to discipline, remove, and cause involuntary retirement of appointed or elected district attorneys . . . .” O.C.G.A. § 15-18-32(a).\n\n3. The General Assembly obligated the PAQC “with the assistance of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of the State of Georgia” to “promulgate standards of conduct and rules for the commission’s governance.” O.C.G.A. § 15-18-32(g).\n\n4. SB 92 provides “that such standards and rules shall be effective only upon review and adoption by the Supreme Court.” O.C.G.A. § 15-18-32(g).\n\n5. On or about September 30, 2023, the PAQC sent its draft standards and rules to the Georgia Supreme Court for its review and adoption.\n\n6. On November 22, 2023, the Georgia Supreme Court issued an order in Matter No. S24U0190 relating to the PAQC. The Georgia Supreme Court “decline[d] to take any action on the draft standards of conduct and rules.” In re: Prosecuting Attorneys Qualifications Commission Rules and Code of Conduct, Order at 2. The Court explained “we have grave doubts that it would be within our power to take action on the draft standards and rules, and the statute imposes no affirmative duty that would require us to decide conclusively whether such a duty is constitutionally permissible.” Id.\n\n7. Because the PAQC is without standards and rules that have been reviewed and adopted by the Georgia Supreme Court, the PAQC is not able to take any action to “discipline, remove, and cause involuntary retirement of appointed or elected district attorneys . . . . .” O.C.G.A. § 15-18-32(a).\n\n8. The PAQC will not be able to take any such action unless and until the General Assembly amends SB 92.\n\n9. Accordingly, because there is no further relief to obtain against Defendants relating to SB 92, Plaintiffs are dismissing their claims in this litigation without prejudice.\n\n10. By this notice, Plaintiffs do not waive their rights to reinstitute litigation should the PAQC take any subsequent action without Legislative authorization or if the General Assembly amends SB 92.\n\n2023-12-08 - Notice of Voluntary Dismissal -- Boston v State\n\nZurawski v. Texas\n\nPublic Rights Project partnered with Local Progress to file an amicus brief in Zurawski v. Texas, a case pending before the Texas Supreme Court seeking clarity regarding the medical exception to Texas’s extreme abortion ban. The brief was submitted on behalf of 26 current and former local elected officials supporting the Center for Reproductive Rights’ impact lawsuit.\n\nThe case was brought on behalf of 20 Texas women—each denied abortion care after facing severe and dangerous pregnancy complications—and two Texas obstetrician-gynecologists. Texas’s statewide abortion ban includes an exception for medical emergencies, but Texas’s hostile abortion landscape, the threat of criminal prosecution, and vague and inconsistent language in the exception has deterred Texas physicians from providing their patients with abortion care.\n\nIn August, a Texas district judge issued an injunction blocking Texas’s abortion bans as they apply to dangerous pregnancy complications, clarifying that doctors can use their own medical judgment to determine when to provide abortion care in emergency situations. However, the state immediately appealed the ruling to the Texas Supreme Court, blocking it from taking effect.\n\nOur amicus brief focuses on the negative health impacts that pregnant people face due to a lack of clarity regarding the law’s medical emergency exception, particularly on women of color and low-income women. Our brief also addresses some of the sovereign immunity arguments the state has made in an effort to avoid being held accountable in court. In addressing those arguments, we seek to ensure that the Plaintiffs’ stories are heard in court and they are offered the respect and empathy that they deserve.\n\n11/22/2023 - Zurawski v. Texas\n\nClarke v. Wisconsin Elections Commission\n\nPublic Rights Project filed an amicus brief with the Wisconsin Supreme Court to support a challenge of the gerrymander of the Wisconsin state legislative map in Clarke v. Wisconsin Elections Commission. In that case, Law Forward -- which represents the petitioners bringing the challenge -- argues that current maps in Wisconsin have divided communities, prevented fair representation, and diminished the voices of voters across the state.\n\nWritten on behalf of Wisconsin local elected officials, our amicus brief highlights the many challenges local elected officials face in their attempt to effectively govern due to the lack of representation in the state legislature caused by unfair maps. As an example, local initiatives to protect workers, renters, and the environment have been preempted at the state level. State funding for cities has often been inadequate, city projects have been stalled or underfunded, and city governments have been left without adequate voice at the state house.\n\nThe brief also explains how the existing maps violate parts of the Wisconsin Constitution, on the issue of contiguity of legislative districts. The legislative map’s failure to provide compact districts has meant that many cities are underrepresented at the state house. As a result, local democracy has suffered.\n\nPRP filed the brief on behalf of 19 local elected officials including mayors, city council members, and school board members from 14 different cities in Wisconsin.\n\n11/08/2023 - Clarke v. Wisconsin Elections Commission\n\nFDA v Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine\n\nPublic Rights Project filed a brief supporting the requests of the FDA and Danco Laboratories for U.S. Supreme Court review of the mifepristone litigation. In that case, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine is challenging FDA approval of the drug, which has been used safely for nearly 6 million abortions in the United States since 2000. Mifepristone is one of two drugs most commonly and safely used for early-pregnancy medication abortions.\n\nA decision by the Fifth Circuit restricts some of the FDA’s approvals for mifepristone and threatens access across the country. The case is an unprecedented attack on abortion, with nationwide implications, and represents the first time FDA approval has been overturned by the federal court.\n\nPRP filed a brief on behalf of 88 local governments and local government leaders from 26 states, including Alaska, North Dakota, Tennessee, and Utah. The brief argues that Supreme Court review is warranted because the plaintiffs have not been harmed by mifepristone approval, the lower courts improperly substituted their judgment for that of an expert agency, and the case is of national importance.\n\n10/12/2023 - FDA v Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine\n\nRobinson v. Ardoin -- U.S. Supreme Court\n\nPublic Rights Project filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of the Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus and other elected leaders of color in the state. The brief supports an emergency application filed by the plaintiffs in an ongoing Voting Rights Act case.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiffs achieved a preliminary injunction holding that Louisiana’s congressional map violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The original map provides only one opportunity district for Black voters. After being stayed at the Supreme Court while the Alabama case was pending, the case was sent back down this past June. Now Louisiana has asked to stop any hearing at the district court about the implementation of a remedial map. And the Fifth Circuit obliged with a writ of mandamus.\n\nThe plaintiffs have asked the Supreme Court to stop the Fifth Circuit’s order and allow for the hearing about a new map to go forward. Our brief highlights why the Louisiana Legislature has had ample time to put together a new map and how a lengthy delay could imperil implementation of a new map for the 2024 election cycle -- and further deprive Black voters in Louisiana of their rights.\n\n10/02/2023 - Robinson v. Ardoin -- U.S. Supreme Court\n\nKaul v. Urmanski - Dane County Circuit Court, Wisconsin - Amicus Brief on Abortion Access\n\nPublic Rights Project filed an amicus brief with the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys (APA) in Kaul v. Urmanski, the major abortion litigation pending in Wisconsin state courts. The case is a challenge to an historic statute that anti-choice activists view as banning almost all abortion in the state. The case was brought by the state attorney general against district attorneys in three Wisconsin counties that were once home to abortion clinics. Physicians later intervened, and the trial court judge preliminary ruled that the statute is in fact not an abortion statute, but a feticide statute, and cannot be used to prosecute consensual medical abortions.\n\nPRP and APA filed their brief in support of progressive prosecutors who seek clarity on the law. The brief urges the court to reach a final judgment declaring that the statute is in fact a feticide statute and leaves no room for prosecutorial discretion or uneven enforcement of abortion-related conduct. The brief also seeks a broad declaratory judgment from the court that applies statewide and provides clarity and finality to all state prosecutors.\n\n09/29/2023 - Kaul v. Urmanski\n\nKC v. Medical Licensing Board of Indiana — U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit — Amicus Brief on Gender-Affirming Care\n\nPublic Rights Project filed an amicus brief on behalf of 81 cities, counties, and local officials from 26 states in K.C. v. Medical Licensing Board of Indiana, a case pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The case is a challenge to Indiana’s ban on gender affirming care for transgender youth. Local government amici urge the Court to affirm the district court’s order granting a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of S.E.A 480, which undermines local government efforts to serve transgender communities.\n\nThe Appellees in the cases, represented by the ACLU, have challenged S.E.A 480 under the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. PRP filed in support of this legal argument, arguing that the law sidelines parents from medical decisions pertaining to their children. The ACLU’s case also includes a First Amendment challenge to S.E.A 480’s aiding and abetting provision, which bans Indiana providers from helping patients obtain care that is lawful outside of the state.\n\nIn the brief, the local governments explain that laws like S.E.A 480 impair their ability to serve their already vulnerable constituents. Because the law prevents access to necessary medical care for children, the harm of S.E.A 480 will extend to their communities as local governments will be forced to bear the subsequent consequences, such as crisis response to victimization, housing security, and educational attainment.\n\nThe brief is led by Washtenaw County Prosecuting Attorney Eli Savit. PRP partnered with Local Progress on the formation of this coalition of 81 signatories from 75 different jurisdictions.\n\n09/27/2023 - KC v. Medical Licensing Board of Indiana — Amicus Brief on Gender-Affirming Care\n\nMilligan v Allen — Alabama Redistricting Case\n\nPRP filed a brief in support of challenges to the latest redistricting map in Alabama. Written on behalf of state and local elected officials of color, the brief responds directly to the Alabama state legislature’s new map (following the Supreme Court's Voting Rights Act decision issued in June) and argues that the map does not provides adequate opportunity for black voters in the state.\n\nThe brief is led by Randall Woodfin, the mayor of Birmingham, and Steven Reed, the mayor of Montgomery. A hearing in the case is set for Monday August 14, 2023. Joining the brief are:\n\nMayor Randall Woodfin of Birmingham.\n\nMayor Steven L. Reed of Montgomery.\n\nSenator Merika Coleman, who represents District 19 in Jefferson County, and is the Chair of the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus.\n\nSenator Linda Coleman-Madison, who represents District 20 in Jefferson County.\n\nRepresentative Napoleon Bracy, Jr., who represents District 98 in Mobile County and serves as the Vice President of the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus and Chairman of the Alabama House Black Caucus.\n\nRepresentative Patrick Sellers, who represents District 57 in Jefferson County.\n\nCommissioner Sheila D. Tyson, who is a Jefferson County Commissioner representing District 2.\n\nMayor Jason Q. Ward of Lisman.\n\n8/11/23 -Milligan v Allen — Alabama Redistricting Case\n\nPRP filed on behalf of 20 elected leaders of color in opposition to Alabama’s effort to have the Supreme Court intervene in favor of its latest redistricting map. The brief responds to the state legislature’s new map and demonstrates that it violates the Voting Rights Act, arguing that the district court's decision should remain.\n\nFollowing our filing, the Supreme Court issued an order denying Alabama's request for a stay of the district court decision. Proceedings with the special master continue and the district court will decide which new map to implement.\n\n10/2/23 Allen v. Milligan Update\n\nLW v. Skrmetti & Doe v. Thornbury — Sixth Circuit Amicus Brief on Gender-Affirming Care\n\nPublic Rights Project filed an amicus brief on behalf of 28 cities, counties, and local officials in two cases pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that challenge bans on gender-affirming care in Tennessee and Kentucky. Local government amici strongly urge the Court to uphold the district courts’ injunctions of these dangerous laws.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the cases, represented by the ACLU, have challenged the abusive state laws under both the Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. PRP filed in support of those legal arguments.\n\nIn the brief, the local governments explain that they operate with limited resources and laws like Tennessee’s SB 1 and Kentucky’s SB 150 impair their ability to serve their constituents with housing, law enforcement, and health resources. The brief demonstrates that, because both laws prevent access to beneficial medical care, local governments will shoulder the burden of the downstream consequences, namely the resulting adverse mental health outcomes from denial of care.\n\nThe brief is led by Washtenaw County Prosecuting Attorney Eli Savit.\n\n8/10/23 - LW v. Skrmetti & Doe v. Thornbury Brief\n\nFitz-James v. Attorney General Bailey (Missouri Supreme Court)\n\nThe Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas and Public Rights Project filed a brief in the Missouri Supreme Court in a reproductive rights/ballot initiative case. Missourians seek to enshrine reproductive rights in the state constitution by putting the issue to voters in 2024 but their effort has been blocked by the Missouri Attorney General.\n\nThe brief argues that the Attorney General’s refusal to approve and forward the papers necessary to move the ballot initiative forward is based on misstatements of Missouri law and a flawed understanding of the effects of abortion access. The brief explains how the Attorney General acted outside of his authority, caused a loss of over seventy days for signature collection, and stripped Missouri citizens of their sovereignty and constitutional right to initiative.\n\nThe brief builds on PRP’s engagement on this issue in the Cole County Circuit Court, where that court issued a writ of mandamus to compel the AG’s action and prevent further delay. This brief asks the Supreme Court to uphold that decision. The case is set for oral argument on July 18, 2023.\n\n7/13/23 - Fitz-James v. Attorney General Bailey Amicus Brief\n\nSaunders v. Mississippi — Challenge to Mississippi’s HB 1020\n\nPublic Rights Project filed an amicus brief as counsel for the City of Jackson in a case before the Supreme Court of Mississippi challenging HB 1020, a new law that creates four unelected judicial positions in the Hinds County Circuit Court. The plaintiffs in the case are residents of Hinds County, where Jackson is located. They are seeking an injunction to stop the appointment of these four judges by the Chief Justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court. Under the state constitution, judges are elected by the local community—HB 1020’s appointment of judges by the judicial branch therefore arguably violates the state constitution.\n\nOur brief reinforces that the plaintiffs have standing to seek the injunction as taxpayers, voters, and direct participants in local democracy in Hinds County. Additionally, we argue that HB 1020, which was allegedly passed in order to respond to concerns about judicial backlogs, addresses these concerns in an unconstitutional manner. We in turn highlight alternative, evidence-based reforms to court backlogs that would be a better solution than HB 1020.\n\nHB 1020 is just one of many laws passed in the 2023 legislative session in states across the country that seek to restrict the electoral and judicial power of communities of color, including multiple bills in Mississippi. The stripping of local democracy and community power by gerrymandered state legislatures is part of a troubling trend intended to further diminish the voting and political power of people of color.\n\n6/14/23 - Saunders v. Mississippi Amicus Brief\n\nFitz-James v. Attorney General Bailey\n\nPRP filed a brief in support of Dr. Anna Fitz-James in Missouri state court challenging the Missouri Attorney General’s attempt to block ballot initiatives that would establish a right to reproductive freedom in the Missouri constitution. The Attorney General has refused to fulfill his statutory duties, thus indefinitely delaying pro-choice ballot initiatives from reaching Missourians. Public Rights Project aims to push back against this undemocratic effort in Missouri, and a broader nationwide trend of state officers acting outside their authority to prevent ballot initiatives that would restore or advance reproductive rights from reaching citizens.\n\nDr. Anna Fitz-James, a Missouri citizen, submitted to the Missouri Secretary of State eleven initiative petitions, each of which would amend the Missouri constitution to establish a right of reproductive freedom. The initiatives should have been certified by May 1, 2023 to allow for the early collection of signatures. Attorney General Bailey, however, prevented the certification by acting outside of his authority and refusing to accept the fiscal impact statement prepared by the State Auditor. Attorney General Bailey cited flawed studies to disagree with the Auditor’s report of the relevant and reasonable information the Auditor received and inaccurately inflate the cost of the pro-choice initiatives. Reputable studies in fact indicate the opposite: restrictions on abortion and contraception access are costly and voter initiatives restoring reproductive rights should lead to an expected overall reduction in costs to state and local governments.\n\nPRP’s brief argues that the Attorney General does not have the authority to prevent the initiative from reaching Missourians based on his own flawed analysis of the initiatives’ fiscal impact. Instead, the Attorney General has a ministerial duty to approve a fiscal note summary when presented in its proper form by the Auditor, which happened here. Our brief reviews how the Attorney General acted outside of his prescribed duties, usurped the powers of other officials, and undermined democratic processes to further his policy preferences. Our brief asks the court to compel the Attorney General to follow the law and ensure prompt production of a ballot title..\n\nThe case is set for a bench trial in the Cole County Circuit Court in Jefferson City, Missouri on June 7, 2023.\n\n06/07/2023 - Fitz-James v Bailey Missouri | PRP Amicus Brief\n\nMcKay v. Tennessee\n\nPRP filed a brief on behalf of Shelby County, Tennessee District Attorney Steve Mulroy opposing the state legislature’s attempt to strip him of his authority to represent the will of the voters who elected him in post-conviction death penalty proceedings.\n\nDA Mulroy was elected as a reform candidate in 2022, defeating an incumbent DA who had faced criticism for her persistent refusal to acknowledge the claims of a death row prisoner whose intellectual disability made executing him unconstitutional. In recent months, DA Mulroy decided to use his discretion as an elected DA to not contest similar claims brought by a death row prisoner. The Tennessee Legislature responded by passing a law that strips the state’s elected DAs of their power to represent the state in trial-level post-conviction proceedings in capital cases–proceedings that are used in Tennessee to bring forth newly discovered evidence–and transferred it to the state’s unelected Attorney General.\n\nWith PRP as counsel, DA Mulroy filed in support of a death row prisoner’s motion to disqualify the Attorney General from representing the state in trial-level post-conviction proceedings in his capital case. Our brief argues that the recently enacted law violates the Tennessee Constitution, which gives DAs–not the AG–the exclusive responsibility and duty to seek justice by evaluating new evidence in capital cases to decide whether seeking the death penalty is appropriate. Furthermore, we argue that the recently enacted law violates the Tennessee Constitution by transferring this authority to the unelected Attorney General, thereby depriving local voters of their ability to have their chosen DA implement their values and policy preferences in criminal proceedings.\n\n05/31/2023 McKay v. Tennessee\n\nCalifornia v. Olson - Ninth Circuit Amicus Brief\n\nWith co-counsel Veena Dubal, Public Rights Project filed an amicus brief on behalf of workers’ rights organizations supporting the State of California’s petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc in California v. Olson, a case recently decided by a panel of the Ninth Circuit allowing Uber and Postmates’ equal protection challenge to AB 5 to move forward. The California State Legislature passed AB 5 in 2019 to ensure that app-based workers were properly treated as employees under state law.\n\nOur amicus brief argues that the panel decision conflicts with past decisions of the Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court and should be reviewed and overturned. The panel decision ignores numerous rational reasons that legislators in California had for including app-based ride-hail and delivery companies like Uber and Postmates under AB 5 and goes against longstanding precedent giving legislatures significant leeway to craft incremental economic regulations. App-based transportation work is the only area where there has been significant growth in independent contracting and app-based transportation workers are at greater risk of harmful misclassification because of low-wages, power imbalances, and companies’ use of opaque algorithmic management.\n\nOur brief further argues that the panel’s finding that Uber and Postmates plausibly alleged animus on the part of the California legislature conflicts with well-established equal protection principles. Uber and Postmates are not a “politically unpopular group” deserving of heightened legal protection and have shown repeatedly that they are able to use the political process to their benefit. Moreover, statements by individual legislators that they intend to regulate certain companies, after hearing from workers that such regulation is needed, does not constitute impermissible animus. The panel’s approach to animus would shield powerful corporations from needed oversight, silence elected officials from publicly sharing their legislative aims, and punish workers for their successful political advocacy.\n\n05/08/23 California v. Olson - Ninth Circuit Amicus Brief\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration, et al. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, et al. – Fifth Circuit Amicus Briefs\n\nPublic Rights Project filed amicus briefs on behalf of 45 cities, counties, and public entities in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, et al. v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, et al., a case pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Local government amici support the FDA’s position that mifepristone is a safe and effective drug used for miscarriage management and medication abortion.\n\nOur amicus briefs demonstrate clear flaws in the plaintiffs’ procedural arguments. Plaintiffs have an ideological interest in the abortion issue and invoked the power of a federal court, even though they are not directly affected by mifepristone. Our brief further argues that the judge’s opinion is an overreach of judicial authority and unjustified on the merits.\n\nThere are decades of evidence-based research and regulation by the FDA that prove that mifepristone is safe, effective, and necessary. This unprecedented undermining of the FDA--if allowed to stand--could threaten the FDA's ability to regulate other drugs and healthcare for a variety of medical conditions and has severe consequences for amici local governments and governmental entities.\n\nThe Texas district court judge's order threatens access nationwide to this medication used by millions to terminate an unwanted or unsafe pregnancy, and to treat miscarriages and other pregnancy complications. Without a reversal of the judge’s order, pregnant people nationwide will lose access to mifepristone and suffer devastating consequences.\n\n2023.05.01 Unopposed Motion Of Local Governments To File Brief As Amici Curiae In Support Of Appellants And Intervenor–Appellant\n\n2023.04.11 Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, et al. v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, et al.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Arizona v. Arizona Attorney General and Intervenor Eric Hazelrigg\n\nPublic Rights Project filed a brief with its client and co-counsel the Pima County Attorney's Office urging the Arizona Supreme Court to deny a Petition for Review that seeks to reinstate a 19th century law that would ban nearly all abortion in the state. The Petition asks the Supreme Court to review the Arizona Court of Appeals' decision that doctors may still perform abortions in compliance with the state's extensive regulation of abortion. The Court of Appeals carefully reviewed dozens of abortion-related Arizona statutes to reach its conclusion that licensed physicians in Arizona may provide abortions up until 15 weeks gestation, as well as for medical reasons.\n\nNeither the plaintiff nor defendants in the case--not Planned Parenthood, not the Arizona Attorney General, and not the Pima County Attorney--sought review of the Court of Appeals decision. Instead, Intervenor Eric Hazelrigg inserted himself in the case, purporting to speak for the interests of all unborn fetuses in Arizona. He now demands that the Arizona Supreme Court reverse the Court of Appeals and strike down recently enacted abortion laws in favor of the territorial-era all-out abortion ban.\n\nThe brief highlights the careful textual analysis the Court of Appeals completed, looking at all of the duly enacted Arizona abortion statutes together. It argues that adopting Intervenor Hazelrigg's view of the Arizona statutes would thwart the plain text of the statutes and undercut the express intent of the Legislature. The Arizona Supreme Court will next decide whether it will grant Hazelrigg's petition for review or allow the Court of Appeals decision to stand.\n\n04.28.23 Planned Parenthood Arizona v. Arizona Attorney General and Intervenor Eric Hazelrigg\n\nGeorge Gascón v. Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County\n\nPublic Rights Project filed an amicus brief in the California Supreme Court on behalf of a group of law professors in support of prosecutorial discretion to make charging decisions that avoid unfairly long sentences. This lawsuit sought to enjoin Los Angeles District Attorney Gascón’s policy not to seek sentencing enhancements under California’s draconian Three Strikes law. The plaintiff union representing his deputy district attorneys, arguing that the text of the Three Strikes law requires prosecutors to “plead and prove” all applicable strike enhancements.\n\nPRP’s brief canvasses state constitutions across the United States to show the importance of prosecutorial charging discretion in state constitutional law–and particularly under California’s constitution. California’s constitution deliberately gives locally-elected DAs the power to decide what charges to bring in a given case, and places the primary check on DAs’ exercise of this power in the hands of the communities who elect these officers, not the state legislature.\n\nOur brief highlights the comparable choices that other states have made to empower local democracy and protect the discretion and independence of their DAs by making them into locally elected constitutional officers. We explain that over two dozen states have made the same choice that California has made to enshrine elected DAs in their constitutions. Furthermore, our brief showcases how many state high courts have found that these constitutional structures protect DAs’ independent charging discretion–and local communities’ electoral choices on important matters of criminal justice reform–from punitive legislative micromanagement.\n\n2023.04.20 George Gascón v. Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County\n\nComments on: FTC Non-Compete Clause Rulemaking, Matter No. P201200\n\nPublic Rights Project submitted a comment letter on behalf of 11 local governments, agencies, and officials in support of the Federal Trade Commission’s non-compete clause rulemaking. The FTC’s proposed rule would find that non-compete clauses are an unfair method of competition under Section 5(a) of the FTC Act and would ban non-compete clauses nationwide for all workers.\n\nAn estimated one in five workers in the United States is subject to a non-compete clause, including many low-wage workers. Non-competes suppress wages and benefits by restricting workers’ ability to move freely between jobs or to pursue new business opportunities. Even in states where non-compete agreements are currently unenforceable, research indicates that employers still enter into such agreements and they nonetheless impact worker and employer behavior. The existence of non-competes drives down wages and benefits across the labor market, harming all workers and the FTC estimates that the proposed rule will increase workers’ total earnings by $250 to $296 billion per year.\n\nOur comment letter highlights the interest of local governments in a strong federal ban on non-compete clauses, including localities’ ongoing efforts to protect low-wage workers, examples of local authority to enforce prohibitions on unfair methods of competition, and the importance of worker mobility for localities acting in their proprietary capacity. The comment also offers support for specific aspects of the proposed rule: its coverage of independent contractors; its requirement that employers rescind existing non-compete clauses and give notice to workers; its preemptive effect, which sets a federal floor rather than a ceiling; and its functional test for defining “non-compete clause,” which captures other constraints on worker mobility, such as some Training Repayment Agreement Provisions (TRAPs). The comment letter further urges the FTC to strengthen its final rule by narrowing an existing exception for franchisees and broadening the scope of the rule to more fully address TRAPS, other forms of employer-driven debt, and no-poach agreements.\n\nIf adopted, the FTC’s non-compete clause rule would boost worker bargaining power and raise wages and benefits for all workers.\n\n2023.04.14 Comments on: Non-Compete Clause Rulemaking, Matter No. P201200\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration, et al. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, et al. – Supreme Court Amicus Brief\n\nPublic Rights Project filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in support of the FDA and mifepristone manufacturer Danco’s emergency applications for a stay of the lower courts’ rulings. 40 cities, counties, and other local government entities joined the brief. The amicus brief highlights the egregious procedural flaws in plaintiffs’ case and highlights the nationwide chaos that will ensue if access to the safe and effective medicine mifepristone is disrupted. Additionally, the amicus brief shows that both the district court and the court of appeals improperly substituted their uninformed views for the expertise of a federal agency and its decades-long study of the drug.\n\nLocal governments are in a unique position to protect the health and safety of their residents. This amicus brief shows the significant harms the lower court rulings, if allowed to stand, will inflict on those residents’ access to essential healthcare, as well as on local governments’ health and social services systems. The brief asks the Court to grant the FDA’s and Danco’s emergency applications and stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal.\n\n2023.04.14 U.S. Food and Drug Administration, et al. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, et al.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida v. State of Florida\n\nPublic Rights Project filed an amicus brief in Planned Parenthood v. Florida, a case pending before the Florida Supreme Court about the state’s 15-week abortion ban, known as HB 5. The brief was submitted in support of the challengers–the ACLU, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and Planned Parenthood (supported by Jenner & Block)--on behalf of a coalition of more than 60 current and former elected officials. This is PRP’s biggest coalition yet!\n\nThe case challenges Florida’s HB 5, passed in 2022, which amended Florida’s law to restrict abortions to the first 15 weeks of pregnancy, with some limited and unworkable exceptions. According to Florida health records, about 5,000 people have abortions after 15 weeks each year.\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, and its impending decision threatens abortion access for all Floridians, but particularly impacts people of color.\n\nOur amicus brief demonstrates HB 5 as a clear violation of Florida’s well-established right to privacy, which has long included the right to access health care. Our brief further argues that this violation is most pronounced for people of color, especially Black and Latino, who have been left behind and harmed by systemic racism in health care. Our brief takes a particular focus on pregnant people of color, low-income pregnant people, and other marginalized communities, highlighting that HB 5 will disproportionately and negatively impact them (and already has).\n\n2023.03.09 Brief of Amici Curiae Current and Former Elected Representatives for Reproductive Justice in Support of Petitioners\n\nBiden v. Nebraska and Department of Education v. Brown\n\nPublic Rights Project filed an amicus brief on behalf of 40 local governments in 24 states -- part of a broader coalition spearheaded by the Student Borrower Protection Center and Democracy Forward -- to defend the Department of Education’s plan for student debt relief of up to $20,000 per student borrower. The plan would eliminate altogether the student debt burden of an estimated 20 million people and significantly reduce the burden for over 20 million more, bringing billions of dollars of debt relief to local residents.\n\nOur brief focuses on the issue of state standing in Biden v. Nebraska. We argue that the state’s only offer speculative and indirect financial harms while at the same time the states and their residents will significantly benefit in economic and other ways from student debt cancellation. The brief highlights these benefits: increased tax revenue, greater housing security, reduced workforce strain in public service professions, and improved public health.\n\nIf the Department of Education’s plan is allowed to move forward, it will mark an important step in addressing the nearly $1.7 trillion in outstanding student loan debt in the United States which disproportionately burdens Black and low-income student borrowers. Argument in the case is set for February 28th.\n\n2023.01.11 Brief of Amici Curiae Local Governments in Support of Petitioners\n\nKaramo v. Winfrey\n\n11/7/2022 Brief Update: Wayne County court denied relief in a lawsuit that would have disenfranchised thousands of Detroit voters on the eve of the upcoming elections.\n\nRead the court’s decision HERE.\n\n—\n\nPublic Rights Project, on behalf of 8 local election officials in Michigan, filed an amicus brief in the Wayne County Circuit Court. The brief opposed a motion for a preliminary injunction engineered to disrupt Detroit’s administration of the 2022 midterm elections and disenfranchise thousands of Detroit voters.\n\nThe case was filed on behalf of several candidates for office. They urge the court to invalidate Detroit’s–and only Detroit’s–procedures for, among other things, processing absentee ballot applications and matching signatures on absentee ballots. Most significantly, they demand that all absentee ballots that Detroit voters applied for via mail or the internet go uncounted.\n\nOur amicus, led by Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, pushes back on these unfounded arguments and illustrates how disastrous the desired injunction would be. Plaintiffs base their arguments on groundless accusations of election fraud and inaccurate readings of state law, and seek an extreme remedy that would invalidate thousands of absentee ballots.\n\n11.4.2022 Brief to oppose a motion for a preliminary injunction engineered to disrupt Detroit’s administration of the 2022 midterm elections and disenfranchise thousands of Detroit voters.\n\nO’Halloran v. Benson\n\n11/3/2022 Brief Update: In O'Halloran v. Benson, Public Rights Project filed an amicus brief arguing that the lower court erred both by failing to recognize the authority of Secretary Benson and by enjoining a manual after election officials hard relied on it. Given that Michigan election officials have faced unprecedented abuses of electoral processes to baselessly question the integrity of recent elections, this order is an important win to protect election administration in Michigan.\n\n—\n\nPublic Rights Project, on behalf of 8 Michigan election officials, filed amicus briefs to the Michigan Supreme Court and Court of Appeals in O’Halloran v. Benson, seeking a stay of the Michigan Court of Claims decision to invalidate essential guidance to local election officials about election challengers and poll watchers.\n\nMichigan election officials, like officials across the country, have faced unprecedented abuses of electoral processes to baselessly question the integrity of recent elections. Looking toward the 2022 election, there were concerns that groups would use election challengers, not for their important but modest role in ensuring confidence in election integrity, but instead to undermine the electoral process. In response, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson issued a Manual setting forth common-sense means to combat misuse of the election challenger process for voter intimidation or disenfranchisement. Months after local election officials had trained staff and election workers on the Manual, would-be challengers sued to invalidate it, and the Michigan Court of Claims ruled that officials should not implement several of its provisions.\n\nOur amicus brief argues that the Michigan Court of Claims erred both by failing to recognize the authority of Secretary Benson and by enjoining the Manual after election officials had relied on it and on the eve of the election. The Court of Claims ruling will undermine the public interest, as Michigan election officials scramble to retrain all election workers or reverse all previously provided instructions relating to the Manual. For those reasons, we request that the Michigan Court of Appeals issue the stay sought by Secretary Benson to ensure the orderly administration of the 2022 general election.\n\n10.31.22 Brief to stay a recent order stopping election administrators from implementing guidance re poll watchers & challengers.\n\nAnti-Defamation League Austin, Southwest and Texoma Regions, et al. v. Abbott, et al.\n\nPublic Rights Project collaborated with 17 cities and counties in filing an amicus brief supporting the challenge to Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s efforts to limit the number of drop-off sites for absentee ballots to one site per county. The Southwest region of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and Common Cause Texas sued to enjoin Governor Abbott from enforcing the one-site-per-county limit. The amicus brief showcases why Texas counties, as the closest, most accessible, and most accountable government to constituents, are the best situated to understand the voting needs of their constituents and the most likely to be able to meet those needs head-on. That is why, as the amicus brief explains, Texas law gives officials deference and discretion when it comes to making choices to enhance access to the polls and protect the voting rights of their residents. Given the significant risks posed by COVID-19 and voter concerns about USPS’s ability to timely deliver ballots, the need to defer to counties’ expertise on the number of drop-off locations needed to ensure voters can safely and securely vote is more important than ever. Governor Abbott’s decision to restrict counties to a single drop-off location in each county runs counter to these long-held principles and is inconsistent with the flexibility granted to the counties to ensure their residents are provided access.\n\nMatorin et al. v. Massachusetts and Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development (Suffolk County Superior Court)\n\nPublic Rights Project collaborated with the City of Chicago in filing a local government amicus brief in defense of the Massachusetts eviction moratorium. Two landlords sued to stop the moratorium. The amicus brief defended the decision of the Massachusetts Legislature to impose a temporary moratorium on all nonpayment evictions in the state. While landlords remain able to collect rent that is owed, tenants are protected from displacement due to an inability to pay the rent. The eviction moratorium in Massachusetts is one of dozens across the country put in place to protect the nearly 28 million households at high risk of displacement by eviction due to COVID-19 and the economic downturn.\n\nLittle Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania (SCOTUS)\n\nPennsylvania v. Trump (SCOTUS)\n\nPRP, partnering with the Oakland City Attorney’s Office, filed an amicus brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down two Trump Administration rules that would permit employers to refuse to provide contraceptive coverage to their employees and plan beneficiaries. In addition to arguing that the moral exemption rule has no legal justification, the brief also discusses the impact of these rules on the delivery of healthcare in many cities and counties. Because some of them serve as the healthcare provider of last resort, people without contraceptive coverage will seek care from city- and county-run clinics. As a result, local governments will be forced to pay for care that would otherwise be covered by private insurance. In addition, as a result of the rules, some individuals will forego contraceptive care, while others will be forced to obtain less effective types of contraception. These impacts may result in other costs to these communities whether they relate to unplanned pregnancies or health needs of children.\n\nPeople of the State of California v. Maplebear, Inc. (Instacart), No. D077380 (Cal. Ct. App. Mar. 23, 2020)\n\nPRP with the City of Oakland and the City of Santa Monica filed an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit by the City of San Diego to require Instacart to treat their workers as employees. During a pandemic like COVID-19, it’s essential that employers provide their employees with the protections they are entitled to--such as paid sick and family leave, unemployment insurance, and worker’s compensation. Properly classifying their workers as employees would also require companies to pay into the unemployment insurance fund, which is currently experiencing a surge in demand due to coronavirus.\n\nAs governments responsible for the health and safety of their communities, cities also know that voluntary company policies cannot substitute for enforceable state and local law. Several state and local governments have already expanded emergency sick leave for workers impacted by the coronavirus."
