        "text": "Clerks: Snooch to the Nooch! is a 2007 American adult computer-animated buddy comedy film directed by Hirokazu Machida and written by Kevin Smith, based on the 1994 film Clerks by Smith. Produced by Pixar Animation Studios in association with View Askew Productions and released by Touchstone Pictures, the film intoduces the voices of Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Jason Mewes and Smith as its main cast. To date, it is the only adult animated film produced by Pixar Animation Studios, and overall the only Pixar film to be released by Touchstone Pictures.\n\nThe film was released by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution on April 27, 2007, and received generally favorable reviews from critics who praised the film's voices, animation, tone, soundtrack and humor, while some criticized its storyline and screenplay. It is the first Pixar film to be considered a box office bomb, grossing $440.8 million worldwide. It received a nomination for Best Animated Feature at the 80th Academy Awards.\n\nPlot[]\n\nBillionaire Leonardo Leonardo returns to Leonardo, New Jersey and opens the Quicker Stop right across from the Quick Stop, which takes away all of Dante and Randal's customers, and nearly puts the Quick Stop out of business. The duo set out to stop Leonardo by uncovering his plot to enslave all of humanity, but are scoffed at during an appearance at Town Hall. Jay and Silent Bob, who had been selling illegal fireworks to children, inadvertently blow up the Quicker Stop, thwarting Leonardo's plans.\n\nMeanwhile, Dante and Randal get locked in the freezer of the Quick Stop. There, they look back on their lives, including foiling Leonardo's evil plans, working at convenience stores in the United Kingdom and India, how Randal got them kicked off The Real World, and their first meeting as children. Jay and Silent Bob also manage to get themselves locked in; Silent Bob eventually uses a crowbar to get them all out, only for Dante and Randal to become locked in the video store.\n\nSometime later, Quick Stop is put under government control after Leonardo is said to have been infected with a deadly virus by a monkey at the new pet store next to RST Video (at which they find Patrick Swayze working). Unfortunately, Jay and Silent Bob steal the monkey so they can teach it to smoke. The town of Leonardo is to be destroyed unless Dante and Randal manage to stop the helicopter pilot from dropping a bomb. After Randal tells the pilot that Dante is gay, Dante is forced to state that he is gay on live television to save the town.\n\nRandal is left in charge of the Quick Stop as part of a bet between him and Dante. Jay sues the Quick Stop for $10 million after slipping on Randal's spilled soda. Randal is Dante's lawyer for the case, while Judge Reinhold presides, and several NBA all-stars are members of the jury. Randal ends up doing more harm than good, putting Dante at the mercy of the courtroom. Before the verdict of the case can be announced, the scene cuts to Jay and Silent Bob going to the diner, where they meet the adult versions of Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup from The Powerpuff Girls and talk about their upcoming animated movie.\n\nSomeday later, Dante and Randal attend their high school reunion, where Randal discovers he has the ability to turn women into lesbians, and Dante is accosted by his old baseball team because they don't remember him (although Dante was the coach that won them the championship game). Leonardo decides to let Dante manage his Little League team. The team is on a losing streak until the inclusion of Jay and Silent Bob (as Jay is still in the fourth grade for being held back so many times and is technically eligible to play). Meanwhile, Randal is put into slave labor after beating the high score on an old video game. Dante and the baseball team discover Randal while searching for the baseball team they have been scheduled to play (which turn out to be some of the children enslaved to work in the mines).\n\nDante and Randal work inside the Quick Stop discussing various things after being told that they need to make the film more similar to the original Clerks. Meanwhile, outside, Dante's supposed to have a date with Caitlin Bree, Jay and Silent Bob go to a fair where havoc ensues, Walt and Steve-Dave need stuff, Leonardo Leonardo finds a soccer team on his roof, and Dante keeps getting called by a guy who wants to show him \"the truth about The Matrix\". Eventually, due to a phone call unknowingly made to the President, the Army surrounds the Quick Stop, the President is attacked by hookers and vampires who are enraged to find RST closed, and Dante and Randal finally go outside, where the animators put them in various awkward situations until it is revealed that Jay is the one behind it all.\n\nVoice cast[]"
