        "text": "What’s driving the day in London.\n\nBy Stefan Boscia\n\nSend tips here | Subscribe for free | Listen to Playbook and view in your browser\n\nGood morning. This is Stefan Boscia.\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nENOUGH IS ENOUGH: Keir Starmer and his team will wake up this morning with genuine hope that the past week’s riots are now beginning to fade. Dozens of planned demonstrations failed to materialize last night, after predictions of mayhem across the nation, and instead thousands of counter-protesters stood up to cowed far-right thugs. With a couple days of relative calm and convictions mounting, it does feel like the tide may just be turning.\n\nA nerve-filled day: The nation was braced for further civil unrest throughout Wednesday, with many businesses boarding up their shopfronts in anticipation of another wave of rioting. Six thousand riot police were mobilized to deal with 30+ protests planned on platforms like Telegram, where far-right thugs spoke about attacking immigration lawyers and refugee centers. However, the night passed without the type of rioting, looting or attacks on police officers the nation has witnessed over the past week.\n\nStanding up to extremism: Instead, today’s front pages lead on pictures of 5,000 anti-racist counter-protesters in the London neighborhood of Walthamstow, where there were fears of violent flare-ups. Counter-protesters also flooded the streets in Birmingham, Sheffield, Bristol, Liverpool, Brighton and Oxford. Thousands gathered at these sites to protect community law firms and migrant centers that were thought to be at risk of attack.\n\n**A message from Goldman Sachs: Private equity is expected to be a key driver in the 2024 market. An unprecedented $1.2 trillion in private equity dry powder coupled with macro drivers could cause a robust ripple effect of M&A and financing opportunities. Goldman Sachs’ latest whitepaper dives into how private equity activity could catalyse opportunity in 2024. Learn more.**\n\nFlare-ups: In most cases there were no signs of far-right protesters while in some areas, like Southampton and Brighton, they were vastly outnumbered by counter-protesters. The Mail’s splash quoted counter-protesters in Brighton chanting “Nazi scum, off our streets” to a handful of men who showed up, while the Times’ splash reported on people in Birmingham holding banners that read “oppose Tommy Robinson.” There were still reports of a small number of arrests in places like Southampton, Middlesbrough and Blackpool, where flag-draped protesters clashed with police.\n\nPaper round: There’s a near clean sweep of papers splashing this morning on the protests and counter-protests . The Times, Mail, Express, Mirror, Telegraph, Sun, i and Guardian all go big on Wednesday night’s events.\n\nThe boys in blue: Home Secretary Yvette Cooper posted on X a “thank you to all the police officers working tonight to protect and support local communities.” Home Office Minister Diana Johnson will be on the morning broadcast round for the government today, which will include BBC Breakfast at 7.30 a.m. and Today at 8.10 a.m.\n\nBANGED UP: We should also see more convictions today as a part of Starmer’s promise to bang up rioters within days of breaking the law. Wednesday saw one man receive a three-year prison sentence for getting involved in disorder at a mosque, while another received two and a half years for setting a police van on fire. Sky News has the details.\n\nFire up the CPS: Playbook is told by a person close to Downing Street that there was concern within government earlier this week that the Crown Prosecution Service would move too slowly in charging and convicting rioters. The person said No. 10 had to put “a f****ing firework up the CPS,” but that things were now moving swiftly through the courts. “There is always a certain amount of institutional inertia and it is August after all,” they said.\n\nKEIR AND KING: King Charles has asked for daily updates on the riots, according to Sky News. The broadcaster reported that the king has been engaging privately with the issues surrounding the riots, leading to speculation he could make an address.\n\nICYMI: UnHerd’s Tom McTague writes that the PM needs to emulate Maggie Thatcher’s strong-willed approach in order “to impose order so that civility can return” to Britain. McTague writes that Starmer “must use this crisis as an opportunity to define his purpose and to play the role demanded of him: from discord to harmony, as someone once said.”\n\nTO THE SUN LOUNGER? But before all that, Starmer may first want to go work on his tan this month. Expect much of the press to now turn to the question of whether the PM will still go on vacation at the end of this week as previously planned. No. 10 is still keeping schtum, but will likely have to tell journalists today or Friday if it’s happening.\n\nLook away now, Vic: New YouGov polling suggests the public will not take too kindly to pictures of the PM on a sun lounger on the French Riviera (for example), considering the past week’s events. The poll showed 71 percent of Brits reckon he should cancel the trip.\n\nPROFITABLE WEEK FOR SOME: One person who has made a massive impact while on a sun lounger this week is Tommy Robinson, thanks to a stream of X posts pushing right-wing conspiracy theories and disinformation. New analysis by the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that his posts had been viewed by 434 million people since the start of the riots. The Times’ Mark Sellman wrote that one up.\n\nPaging the axis of authoritarianism: Bloomberg’s Alex Wickham and colleagues got the scoop Wednesday that disinformation is also being peddled by malign state actors on platforms like X and Telegram. They report that British authorities suspect foreign state-backed actors are using bots and accounts with stolen British identities to amplify anti-immigration sentiment.\n\nPlaying both sides: My POLITICO colleagues Andrew McDonald and Esther Webber have a piece out on how Nigel Farage is trying to have it both ways by criticizing Robinson, while also parroting some of his messages about “two-tier policing.” Tom Winsor, a former HM Inspector of Constabulary, told the pair that some of Farage’s comments are putting officers at risk.\n\nJENRICK UNDER FIRE: Meanwhile, Tory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick is facing his own backlash this morning after telling Sky News that anyone yelling “Allahu Akbar” in the streets should be “immediately arrested.” In comments written up by the Mirror’s Lizzy Buchan, Deputy PM Angela Rayner accused Jenrick of “stirring up some of the problems that we’ve seen in our communities.” Jenrick went on to clarify that he was only referring to people using the phrase in an “intimidatory and threatening” manner, and that “‘Allahu Akbar’ is spoken peacefully and spiritually by millions of British Muslims in their daily lives.”\n\nBlue-on-blue: A staffer on a rival leadership campaign told Playbook that Jenrick should receive a yellow card from the 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs for the comments. Tory MP Bob Blackman, the 1922 chair, is handing out yellow cards to contenders for personal attacks against other candidates. The staffer said: “If you don’t get a yellow card for Islamophobia, then what do you get it for?”\n\nPardon me? A Jenrick ally batted away suggestions that the MP had crossed a line, telling Playbook that “politics is not about avoiding rows, it’s about having good fights.” They also went on to suggest that Jenrick was *checks notes* the reason there was no rioting on Wednesday night. “He spoke some hard truths and then the riots stopped,” they said. Which is certainly a very, shall we say, unique interpretation.\n\nTHE REEVES RULES\n\nGOING IN 1 DIRECTION: Rachel Reeves has once again refused to rule out changing Labour’s fiscal regs, with the chancellor telling POLITICO U.S. that she will make an announcement at the October budget. Reeves told my U.S. colleague Sam Sutton that “we’ll set out the precise details of those fiscal rules” on October 30, but that “we will not be playing fast and loose with public finances.”\n\nRules of engagement: Labour’s current fiscal rules — described as “non-negotiable” in the party’s election manifesto — dictate that the government will not borrow for annual day-to-day departmental spending and that Britain’s overall debt-to-GDP ratio will be falling in five years’ time. Reeves has inherited a very tight fiscal outlook with these rules in place, with speculation rife she will adjust the debt target to give the government more scope to borrow.\n\nBalancing act: Reeves told Sam during her trip to New York that “neither of [Labour’s] fiscal rules are being met at the moment,” because of its inheritance from the previous government, “and so we’ve got work to do — particularly on balancing day-to-day expenditures through receipts.”\n\nTaxing times: The chancellor also refused to be drawn on which taxes she will hike at the budget, after admitting they would likely rise to help close a £22 billion black hole in the nation’s finances. However, Reeves did promise to avoid any tax hikes which could hamper economic growth.\n\nShe said: “We’re looking at these things through the prism of the No. 1 mission of this government, which is to grow the economy. We won’t do anything to undercut that.”\n\nTHE LEFT WON’T LIKE THIS: Reeves will also look to clamp down on benefits spending to try to balance the books, according to the Sun’s Ryan Sabey. She told the paper while in New York that the last government “let welfare costs spiral out of control,” while she wanted to “make sure welfare spending is sustainable.” A reminder that the U.K.’s welfare bill has spiraled post-COVID due largely to an uptick in people claiming long-term sickness benefits.\n\nThey probably didn’t like this either: The chancellor also copped fresh criticism for her decision last week to cut spending by taking winter fuel payments away from 10 million pensioners. Ros Altmann, Tory peer and ex-pensions minister, told the Telegraph’s Cameron Henderson that means-testing the winter fuel payment would cause “real hardship.”\n\nTODAY IN WESTMINSTER\n\nWRONG SHADE OF BLUE: Reform UK’s Chair Zia Yusuf was a member of the Tory party until just last week, according to the Guardian’s Eleni Courea. The Tories booted him on Friday, after Courea asked the party whether Yusuf was still an active member.\n\nRETURN OF THE MAC: The government is looking at cutting the number of immigrant visas given to people working in the tech and engineering sectors, according to the FT’s Delphine Strauss. Yvette Cooper tasked the Migration Advisory Committee with reviewing the sectors, while asking the body to investigate how immigration policy “could be used more effectively” to boost domestic recruitment.\n\nSMALL BOAT NUMBERS: More than 4,000 people have arrived in Britain on small boats since the election, according to the latest Home Office figures. Shadow Home Secretary James Cleverly is (obvs) blaming the government’s decision to scrap the Rwanda scheme. The Mail’s David Barrett has this one.\n\nNOTHING’S CHANGED: Whitehall has denied a Jewish Chronicle report that the U.K. has suspended arms exports to Israel, pending an investigation launched recently by Foreign Secretary David Lammy. A government spokesperson told the Times’ George Grylls and Larisa Brown “there has been no change to our approach to export licences to Israel.”\n\nGENERATION GAME: My POLITICO colleague Esther Webber has picked up some sniffiness from older generations of Labour MPs toward Starmer’s army of newbies. Shadow frontbenchers who were not given jobs by Starmer have set their sights on select committee chairmanships — and are none too pleased to hear that some of the 2024 intake are having a pop at chair positions straight away. Dover and Deal MP Mike Tapp, who used to work for the National Crime Agency, fancies a go at justice, while Marie Tidball, a lawyer and disability advocate, has her sights set on education.\n\nBIRTH GAP: New research from Onward and Mumsnet has found a perceived “motherhood penalty” in their careers is stopping women having more babies. The research details a “birth gap” in England and Wales, with a record-low number of children born this year. The Times’ Oliver Wright has written that one up.\n\nSW1 EVENTS: Pakistan’s most senior military figure Sahir Shamshad Mirza, the chairman of the country’s powerful Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, will be speaking at a RUSI event from 11 a.m.\n\nREPORTS OUT TODAY: Policy Exchange is calling for pensions regulation reform to increase the risk appetite of individual funds. The think tank is calling for an Australian-style system, which prioritizes greater investment by pension funds in the economy.\n\nBEYOND THE M25\n\nONE TO BOOKMARK: The Spectator has a handy running tally of MSP endorsements for each of the contenders to become the next Scottish Tory leader.\n\nTERROR ALERT: Three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna have been canceled, after police foiled a terror attack linked to the Islamic State. Austrian authorities say they have arrested two men who were preparing to carry out the attack. POLITICO’s Seb Starcevic has more.\n\nHARRIS’ BLUE-COLLAR PITCH: My Stateside POLITICO colleague Adam Cancryn has some great analysis about Kamala Harris’ efforts to win over Joe Biden’s blue collar voters from 2020. Read that one here.\n\nUKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR: The Russian region of Kursk has declared a state of emergency in light of a cross-border attack by Ukrainian troops. Moscow claims 1,000 Ukrainian troops have entered the Russian town, while Kyiv has not commented on the attack. The BBC has more.\n\n**A message from Goldman Sachs: What might the rest of the year hold? Expanding Possibilities in Sponsor M&A: As M&A volumes normalise and sponsor-backed activity rebalances, we anticipate greater opportunity for a “meeting of the minds” between buyers and sellers. Public Equity Markets as a Key Liquidity Alternative: As sponsors monetise via public equity markets, the next several quarters should see increased deal count, volume, and industry breadth. The Private Markets and the Mainstreaming of Secondaries: Despite an increasingly active IPO market, the mainstreaming of the secondaries market and a more muted exit environment have ushered in a new era for private markets, which we see remaining a viable option for corporates with pragmatic valuation outlooks. Leveraged Finance Open for Business: The leveraged loan market is strengthening, and we expect it to become increasingly supportive of M&A financing throughout 2024 and 2025 as normalised loan trading levels spur lenders to seek new opportunities and support more aggressive underwriting structures.
