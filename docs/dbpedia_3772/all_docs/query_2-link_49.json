        "text": "Robert “Bob” Black is a leading Texas lawyer, renowned for his litigation abilities and as a mediator and arbitrator.\n\nMr. Black joined MehaffyWeber in 1980 after graduating Summa Cum Laude from the Texas Tech University School of Law. He has tried more than 50 cases and has focused on mediation and arbitration in recent years, successfully mediating more than 5,000 cases on a wide range of subjects and routinely arbitrating disputes throughout Texas and in other states. Mr. Black has an extraordinary ability to bring parties together for successful resolutions, which end up saving time and money for clients.\n\nLitigants rely on Mr. Black for his unparalleled depth of knowledge and successful resolution of even the most complex issues. He is a member of the American Arbitration Association Roster of Neutrals and was ranked by Chambers and Partners® in the 2016 inaugural rankings for Mediators Nationwide, an honor that was only bestowed upon 22 mediators nationwide. He has won this industry accolade every year since. Mr. Black has been recognized by The Best Lawyers in America® (2011-2024) and Super Lawyers by Thomson Reuters (2003 – 2022) for his outstanding legal work.\n\nHe is well known in the legal community as the past president of the State Bar of Texas from 2011-2012. During his time as president, he started an initiative called Oyez Oyez Oh Yay! that served to educate students on U. S. Supreme Court decisions that control the shape of our country and illustrate the central importance of the Rule of Law. This initiative was awarded the 2012 Community Outreach and Education Award from the National Association of American Bar Executives and Lexis Nexis, a national honor not previously accorded to a State Bar of Texas initiative. In 2014, Mr. Black was chosen as a Texas Legal Legend by the Litigation Section of the State Bar of Texas, the youngest ever selected. He has also been honored as a Distinguished Alumnus of Texas Tech School of Law (2011) and University of Texas at El Paso (2012)."
