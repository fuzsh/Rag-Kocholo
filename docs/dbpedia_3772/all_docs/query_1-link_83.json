        "text": "Serial child killer Robert Black - who dumped the body of one of his victims in a ditch near Twycross - has died in prison.\n\nThe twisted Scottish serial killer, who was serving 12 life sentences for brutally killing four young girls in the 1980s, died of natural causes in Maghaberry prison in Northern Ireland aged 68.\n\nIn 1994, Falkirk-born Black was found guilty of three child murders in the 1980s - those of 11-year-old Susan Maxwell, from the Scottish Borders, five-year-old Caroline Hogg, from Edinburgh, and Sarah Harper, 10, from Morley, near Leeds - as well as a failed abduction bid in Nottingham in 1988.\n\nIn 2011, he was found guilty of the 1981 murder of nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy, from Ballinderry, Co Antrim.\n\nBlack was also implicated, but never charged, with several other high profile disappearances.\n\nIt was his second known victim Caroline Hogg whose body was discovered in Leicestershire - on July 8 1983, he snatched five-year-old Caroline off the street as she was playing.\n\nCaroline, from Portobello near Edinburgh, who was wearing a princess dress, was given permission to play for five minutes in the school grounds opposite her house.\n\nEyewitnesses saw her with a scruffy man playing in the promenade and the funfair.\n\nTen days later her naked body was found dumped in Leicestershire.\n\nA salesman who had pulled over on the A444 made the discovery of the \"badly decomposed\" girl.\n\nAt the time, a farmworker told The Hinckley Times: \"He was obviously shocked, and my wife went to make him a cup of tea.\"\n\nPolice carried out a \"massive\" operation in the area, with a team reported to be at least 40 police officers and 20 more senior detectives.\n\nAn appeal was also made to \"courting couples\" who were said to regularly use the layby where Caroline was found.\n\nBlack was later traced to the area.\n\nBlackâ€™s murderous reign of terror came to a dramatic end when he was in 1990 seen snatching a six-year-old girl off the street, and bundling her into his van in the Scottish village of Stow.\n\nPolice intercepted him and found a six-year-old girl who had been hooded, bound and gagged and stuffed into a sleeping bag, locked in the back of his van.\n\nBlack had abducted her and sexually assaulted her moments earlier.\n\nShockingly, the policeman who discovered the terrified girl was her father."
