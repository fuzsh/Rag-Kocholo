        "text": "Orrington - Robert \"Wayne\" Black, 77, passed away peacefully in his home surrounded by loved ones on October 27, 2023 He was born September 26, 1946, in Bangor, the son of Elwell and Mildred (Alley) Black.\n\nWayne graduated from Brewer High School, class of 1965. He served in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War; his service spanned from 1965 to 1987. His rank was U.S. Navy Boatswain's Mate Chief Senior. After retiring from the Navy he worked as the head custodian at Center Drive School, in Orrington, where he permanently retired. He was an avid hunter and fisherman who would lend a hand to anyone in need including building houses, camps and decks. He had many canine companions that he adored. Anyone that had the pleasure to meet him always walked away with one of his infamous stories.\n\nIn addition to his parents, Wayne was predeceased by his first wife, Rosalie Black; brother, Dale Black; and sisters, Judy McNealy and Florence McDonald. Surviving in addition to his wife, Beverly Black, are sons, Robert Black of Brewer and Michael Black and his wife, Ashlee, of Brewer; stepdaughters, Amy Gibney of Alfred and Angela Gibney of Glenburn; and stepson, Alan Gibney and his wife, Lori, of Lyman; grandchildren, Tyler, Aidan, Logan, Joslyn, Lily, Ellie, Emma, and Annalyse; one brother, Earl Black of New York; many special nieces and nephews; and best friends, Ronnie Vilasuso of Orrington and Joe Hall of Bangor.\n\nA celebration of life will be announced at a later date.
