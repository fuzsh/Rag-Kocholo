        "text": "Bibliography\n\nJames Theodore Holly papers, 1861-1975. Library of Congress. “The collection includes three circulars by Bishop Holly regarding his Haitian mission, 1861-1862; reports by Holly in 1876; a pamphlet, Manuel de théologie dogmatique of the Church in Haiti, 1879; a few items of correspondence by and about the Bishop; and later articles concerning him. Subjects of correspondence include Holly’s overwork, family affairs, labors in Haiti, visits to Maryland and Delaware, financial needs, educational enterprises, and difficulties with the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Port-au-Prince. Papers deal with relations between the Episcopal Church in America and the Church in Haiti, known as L’Eglise Orthodoxe Apostolique en Haiti, including actions of the Board of Missions and the House of Bishops concerning Haiti. There are nine issues of the Church’s publication, L’Echo de l’Orthodoxie, for the first and second years, 1878-1879, some with articles by Bishop Holly.” From Worldcat.org.\n\nDigital Texts\n\nBrown, William Wells.
