Work began on Enric Miralles’s Holyrood complex in 1999, but by the time the first debate was held there in 2004 the cost had risen tenfold from the original estimate of £40 million to more than £400 million. The problem, Black said in a critical report of the project’s management, had been an absence of leadership. “There was no single point of leadership and control,” he wrote, adding that the management had not kept consultants’ fees under review.\n\nAs the first auditor general after devolution, Black’s role was to scrutinise how public money was spent by the Scottish government, its agencies,"
