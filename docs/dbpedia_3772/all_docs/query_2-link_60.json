        "text": "Robert Marshall Alexander \"Dr. Bob\" has gone to see the Lord, passing away peacefully at the age of 79 on July 20th, 2024, in Yakima, WA. He is preceded by his mother, father, and stepfather, Henry Mitchell. He is survived by his wife, Michele, sons Ryan and Jason, and his 7 grandchildren, Zach, Ellie, Taylor, Mackensey, Maggie, Lila, and August, sister Judith Alexander Selleck and assorted nieces and nephews and cousins. He met the Love of his life, Michele Eaton, in 9th grade at John Marshall Junior High in Seattle; they were married August 27, 1966, and remained married for 58 years.\n\nHe was born in Walla Walla, WA, on November 05, 1944, to Marion Marshall and Miriam Ruth Alexander. He grew up in Walla Walla, later moving to Seattle after the passing of his father when Bob was 10 years old. He attended Roosevelt H.S. and graduated in 1963. He played varsity baseball and basketball. He then attended the University of Washington for a year playing baseball, later transferring to Seattle Pacific College for baseball on scholarship, there receiving his bachelor's degree. He then attended and received his Master's Degree from Central Washington University, later completing a Doctorate in Education at Oregon State University, June 1984. He was hired as an English teacher, promoted to assistant principal, and later became principal at Davis High School until 1983. He was moved as principal to Eisenhower High School and promoted to downtown administration in 1989. He officially retired in 2005.\n\nHe ferociously loved his whole family. He enjoyed fly fishing, tennis, golf, hunting with his boys and his black lab Olive. He was a dog whisperer and never knew a dog that didn't absolutely love him. (Cats, also). He was a very active member of St. Timothy's Episcopal Church and participated at the diocesan level. He was involved for many years with the Parker Youth foundation and as a Rotary member. Bob coached his son's baseball and soccer teams. One year he facilitated the exchange of Ryan's soccer team with German players, fostering international relationships. Bob significantly loved, educated, and served people his whole life.\n\nThe Celebration of Life service will be held at 2:00pm on August 24th, 2024, at St. Timothy's Episcopal Church, 4105 Richey Rd, Yakima, WA 98908.\n\nAny memorial donations or contributions can be sent to the Alzheimer's Association at ALZFDN.org."
