        "text": "Isham Brumfield (Spelled Broomfield on Homestead Patent) was born enslaved in Louisiana in approximately 1818, as identified from the 1880 Pike County, Mississippi federal census and homestead testimony. His parents and siblings have not been definitively identified. In the 1870 Federal population census for Pike County, Mississippi, Isham is enumerated with Eli 14, Hester 13, and Harriet 10 years old, who were born in Mississippi and are likely his children.\n\nIsham filed application #6899 on March 6, 1873 for 160 acres of land in Walthall County, Mississippi at the Land Office in Jackson, Hinds County, Mississippi for a fee of $14.65.\n\nPublication of final proof to support his homestead claim was made March 12, 1880, in the Magnolia Gazette newspaper for five consecutive weeks. His witnesses in the newspaper were Solomon Singleton, Jacob Ellzey, Harry Butler and Jesse Thornhill.\n\nIsham Brumfield failed to provide final proof of his homestead application. His homestead entry was cancelled January 14, 1881. Robert Magee and Joseph Conerly appeared before the Pike County clerk on behalf of Isham on October 1, 1881. They testified his failure to make final proof was secondary to having lost his eyesight.\n\nOctober 21, 1881, Isham testified he was sixty-three years old and his post office address was Walkers Bridge in Pike County, Mississippi. He was on the land and established residence beginning December, 1870 with three children. He built a log house for a dwelling, horse stables and other necessary out houses valued at two hundred dollars.\n\nJacob Ellzey and Solomon Singleton were his sworn witnesses at that time. They testified that Isham Brumfield (name listed Isham Bromfield) was on the land and established residence beginning December, 1870. Isham had a log house for a dwelling and out houses valued at two hundred dollars. He cultivated twenty acres and five crops.\n\nOn November 16, 1881, the Pike County clerk acknowledged that Isham's severe eye disease had rendered him totally blind. The clerk requested to the register and receiver to reinstate his homestead entry and pass his final proof as made on the original published notice.\n\nIsham Brumfield 66 years old received his homestead certificate # 2381 on December 30,1884\n\nPatent Details - BLM GLO Records\n\n~ Contributed by Nona L.
