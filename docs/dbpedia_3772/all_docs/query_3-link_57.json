        "text": "The disappearance of Genette Tate is one of the UK's most notorious and disturbing child abduction cases.\n\nDevonLive publisher Reach has launched a powerful new true crime newsletter called Testimony and this week it focuses on her disappearance.\n\nReporter, Paul Greaves, looks back on the case. Here he provides an introduction and overview of the complex and haunting story that affected the lives so many people.\n\nRobert Black was born in 1947 and given up for adoption by his mother when he was six months old. From that point on his development can be viewed as an object lesson in how to create a predatory paedophile.\n\nHe was sexually abused by his foster father, put into care at 11 when his foster mother died, and then abused by staff while in the care of the state. On release he worked as a butcher's boy, becoming a prolific abuser of young girls by the age of 15 and a convicted dangerous child sex attacker by 17.\n\nIn 1968 he headed south to England and in 1976 passed his driving test and got a job as a poster delivery driver. His work took him all over the UK and Ireland and into Europe. It was the perfect cover for a predatory paedophile.\n\nUtilising the motorway network of the UK he could materialise, abduct and leave without anybody being aware of his presence. His preferred method was to leave the main road and snatch children in small rural settlements. Aylesbeare was close to the M5 linking the South West to the Midlands. Aylesbeare was exactly the sort of place Robert Black liked to visit.\n\nIn 1994 Black was convicted of the kidnap, rape and murder of three girls and sentenced to life in prison. The crimes had been committed in the 1980s and each had similarities to Genette's case.\n\nIn 2007 Devon and Cornwall Police presented a file to the Crown Prosecution Service seeking to bring charges against Black for Genette's disappearance.\n\nMatters did not progress but by 2016 hopes were high that a prosecution could finally happen.\n\nBlack died at Maghaberry high-security prison in Co Antrim in January 2016.\n\nAt the time detectives were said to be five weeks away from presenting the file seeking his prosecution. The full extent of the police case against him has never been revealed but it is known that a witness claims to have seen Black acting suspiciously on August 19, 1978 at Exeter Airport. There is also believed to be a petrol receipt which puts Black in the South West at the time, though it is not known exactly how close to Aylesbeare.\n\nAn inquest into Black's death at the age of 68 revealed he was a heavy smoker with high cholesterol when he died.\n\nHis inquest was held in the same courtroom in Armagh city where he was convicted of his fourth murder - Northern Irish schoolgirl Jennifer Cardy in 2011.\n\nNobody from his family was present at his inquest and the Coroners Service was unable to trace anybody prepared to mourn such a despicable human being.\n\nStephen Ritchie, a barrister for the Coroners Service, said medics believed Black died from a heart attack after having a stroke 20 years earlier.\n\nThere is no happy ending to Genette's case. Her body has never been found and despite the best efforts of police nobody knows with certainty what happened in Withen Lane on August 19, 1978.\n\nBlack has been linked to more than a dozen child abductions in the UK and Europe. His preferred method of roaming the country like a lone wolf and abducting children from towns and villages means he is undoubtedly the prime suspect in the case.\n\nPolice are convinced he is the man responsible for her death. It is a logical conclusion, certainly a compelling, though circumstantial case.\n\nBut there are many who don't agree and we'll never know whether the police case would have been strong enough to convince a jury of 12 people.\n\nOver the years the accumulation of information and misinformation has led some to conclude that police are either hiding the truth or are simply incompetent. Rumours of paedophilic activity and occult practices in the village are never far from the surface. The development of the internet has only increased the misguided conspiracy theories and allowed amateur sleuthing to flourish unchallenged."
