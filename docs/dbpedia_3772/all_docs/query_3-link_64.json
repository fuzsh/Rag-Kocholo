        "text": "The parents of a schoolgirl believed to have been murdered by serial killer Robert Black 40 years ago say they will “never get closure” as they still search for answers about her disappearance.\n\nJohn Tate and Sheila Cook, parents of Genette Tate, a 13-year-old girl who went missing in August 1978 whilst doing a paper round in Devon, were also unaware that the inquest into Black’s death was due to take place this week.\n\nPolice identified Robert Black, a child serial killer known to have committed four killings between 1981 and 1986, as their prime suspect in Genette’s murder. They were weeks away from charging him in January 2016 when he died from reported “natural causes” in a Northern Ireland prison.\n\nMr Tate and Mrs Cook, who have since separated, were only made aware that the inquest into Black’s death was taking place when The Sunday Telegraph made contact with them this week.\n\nThe inquest will start on Monday at Armagh Court House, Northern Ireland, shortly after a jury is sworn in.\n\nMr Tate, 76, said he “had a right to know” the inquest was taking place, adding: “I was not told about it. It’s frustrating and annoying and makes me feel forgotten about. I don’t know really how to put it into words.\n\n“I think the police should have kept us informed. We didn’t know anything about this to do with Robert Black’s inquest. It was a big surprise.\n\n“I don’t think closure comes into it at all. We are never going to get closure. We always think about her everyday of the week, it never goes away. I still have photographs in the house and they will remain there for the rest of my life.”\n\nMr Tate, who lives in Manchester and relies heavily on carers after suffering from two strokes, said he would have liked to attend the inquest, but will now struggle given the short notice and his immobility.\n\n“If a way was found, I would bucker up the strength and go. I will probably suffer for it in the end, but I would really like to know what it’s all about”, he added.\n\nMrs Cook, who has since remarried and lives in Bristol, said: “I’m afraid I wasn’t aware the inquest was imminent. I haven’t heard anything from Devon and Cornwall police since they effectively closed the case about 18 months ago.\n\n“Black’s death and its cause is somewhat tangential to Genette’s fate but I think it is right that the correct processes are followed. After all he did die very suddenly and unexpectedly.”\n\nBlack, who was 68 at the time of his death and originally from Stirlingshire, Scotland, was serving four life sentences when he was due to be charged with the murder of Genette. But in April 2016, three months after he died in Maghaberry high security prison, police closed Genette’s investigation.\n\nA spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: “We have worked closely with the family of Genette over the years including during the investigation and subsequent appeals.\n\n“We have since been in touch with Genette’s parents and we will ensure that both are aware of the current coronial investigation being conducted, the details of the inquest, and that specialist support is offered if needed.\n\n“We have been clear that Black was our only designated suspect and we approached the CPS with a recommendation to charge.”\n\nA spokeswoman for the Office of the Lord Chief Justice in Northern Ireland said that the coroner’s service will only ever notify “properly interested persons”, adding: “The Coroner in this case did not consider the family members of the victims or alleged victims of Robert Black to be in this category.“ ENDS\n\nKiller's girls victims: Youngest of Robert Black's victims was only five years old\n\nJennifer Cardy was the first of Black's young victims when she went missing on 12 August 1981, but he was not found guilty of her murder until 2011.\n\nThe nine-year-old was last seen by her mother at 1:40pm before cycling to a friend’s house in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. But she never arrived.\n\nHer bike was found hours later and, six days into the search for her, her body was found in a reservoir.\n\nAn autopsy concluded that she had died of drowning and that she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nThe watch she had been wearing was reported to have stopped at 5:40 pm.\n\nIt took police 30 years to get Black into court charged with her murder, which he denied.\n\nIn old police interviews into the disappearance of Jennifer, Black was asked if he was often left with “time to kill” after he had finished working, to which he replied: “I would have all afternoon and early evening to kill.”\n\nSusan Claire Maxwell was Black’s second victim. Killed when she was just 11-years-old, Black abducted her on 30 July 1982 near the Scottish border as she walked home from playing tennis.\n\nShe was last seen at 4:30pm and it is believed that she was abducted by Black only minutes later.\n\nTwo weeks after she was reported missing, her body was found by a lorry driver near Uttoxeter, 425 km from where she was abducted.\n\nIt is understood that Black kept her dead body in his vehicle for over 24 hours, before discarding her corpse beneath some undergrowth. Police believe she was sexually assaulted.\n\nWork records showed that Black had been travelling between Edinburgh and Newcastle on the day Susan vanished and that he would usually return to London through the Midlands, where he would visit a friend. The friend lived in Donisthorpe - 20 miles from the lay-by where Susan was found.\n\nSarah Harper, 10, from Leeds, was on her Easter holidays when her mother sent her to run an errand in her local corner shop.\n\nThe shopkeeper remembers her calling in and buying a loaf of bread, before heading down a short alleyway on her way home.\n\nIt is here that she was abducted by Black on 26 March 1986. She was reported missing within half and hour and more than 200 local volunteers and 100 police officers began the search for her.\n\nThree and a half weeks later, her body was found floating in the River Trent near Nottingham by a man walking his dog.\n\nShe was found without her skirt on and a post-mortem examination discovered that she he had been subjected to a violent sexual assault.\n\nBlack made a delivery in Morley the evening Sarah disappeared.\n\nHe was found guilty of murdering Sarah, Caroline and Susan on 19 May 1994."
