        "text": "Child serial killer Robert Black has died aged 68 at Maghaberry jail in Northern Ireland.\n\nBlack was convicted of murdering four children during the 1980s and was suspected of other killings.\n\nHis last conviction came in 2011 when he was given another life sentence for the 1981 abduction and murder of Jennifer Cardy.\n\nHe snatched the nine-year-old as she cycled to a friend's house in Ballinderry, Co Antrim.\n\nThe former delivery driver abducted Jennifer while on a work trip to Northern Ireland.\n\nHe dumped her body in water before catching a ferry home.\n\nReacting to the paedophile's death, Phillip Cardy, Jennifer's brother, said: \"I have no hate for him, I couldn't muster the hate for him.\"\n\nThe 2011 conviction came while he was already serving life terms for three other murders.\n\nIn 1994, he was found guilty of killing 11-year-old Susan Maxwell, from the Scottish Borders, five-year-old Caroline Hogg, from Edinburgh, and Sarah Harper, 10, from Morley, near Leeds.\n\nHe was also convicted of a failed abduction in Nottingham in 1988.\n\nBlack was caught in 1990 when police found him with a six-year-old girl bound and gagged in a sleeping bag in the back of his van. He had just sexually assaulted her.\n\nHe was also the main suspect in the case of missing Genette Tate, 13, last seen in rural Devon in 1978.\n\nThe delivery girl's newspapers and bike were found but her body has never been discovered.\n\nBlack was arrested but there was not enough evidence to bring charges.\n\nProsecutors at his last trial pushed for the Scottish-born killer to get a whole-life term but the judge gave him another life sentence with a minimum of 25 years.\n\nA NI Prison Service spokeswoman said: \"The Prison Service has confirmed that a 68-year-old prisoner has died at Maghaberry Prison.\n\n\"While this is not being treated as suspicious, the Prison Service has informed the PSNI, Coroner, and Prisoner Ombudsman. It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.\""
