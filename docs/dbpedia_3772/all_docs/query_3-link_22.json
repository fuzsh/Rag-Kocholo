        "text": "Child killer Robert Black has died in a jail in Northern Ireland.\n\nScottish-born Black, 68, died at Maghaberry top security prison in County Antrim. He had been serving a life sentence for murdering four girls.\n\nOn 12 August 1981, Black killed nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy in Northern Ireland. She was cycling to a friend’s house near her home in Ballinderry, Antrim, when Black abducted and murdered her. At the time he was working in Northern Ireland, driving around the region for a London-based poster company.\n\nIn 1982, Black abducted and murdered 11-year-old Susan Maxwell from Cornhill-on-Tweed in northern England, close to the Scottish border.\n\nA year later Caroline Hogg, five, disappeared from outside her home in Portobello, near Edinburgh, and was later found dead in a ditch in Leicestershire. In 1986 Black abducted 10-year-old Sarah Harper as she walked from a corner shop near her home in Morley, Leeds.\n\nHer body was later discovered in the river Trent in Nottingham. Black was caught by police in 1990, when they stopped his van and found another victim, a six-year-old girl, bound and gagged in the back of his vehicle. The child had been kidnapped from a village show in Scotland.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Prison Service confirmed on Tuesday that a 68-year-old prisoner had died at the jail. “While this is not being treated as suspicious, the Prison Service has informed the Police Service of Northern Ireland Coroner, and Prisoner Ombudsman,” it added. “It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.”\n\nAlthough Jennifer Cardy was Black’s first victim, her case was the last to be solved by police.\n\nBlack had long been the prime suspect in the case of missing 13-year-old Genette Tate, who was last seen in a rural lane in Aylesbeare, Devon, in 1978. No trace of the newspaper delivery girl has ever been found. All that remained at the scene were her bike and scattered papers."
