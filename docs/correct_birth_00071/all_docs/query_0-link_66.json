        "text": "As The Beatlesâ resident court jester, Ringo Starr (born Richard Starkey, 7 July 1940, in Liverpool) was initially known as much for his jokes as his drumming, shooting off one-liners to the press as effortlessly as he triggered the rapid-fire tom-tom rolls that open âShe Loves Youâ. And his rare lead-vocal turnsâwhether the droll reading of Buck Owensâ country standard âAct Naturallyâ or the kid-friendly fantasia of âYellow Submarineââonly amplified that playful personality. But as The Beatles transitioned from teen idols to experimental artists, Ringoâs backbeats formed the rock-solid foundation from which John Lennon leapt into psychedelic surrealism, Paul McCartney built his cinematic art-pop suites and George Harrison explored Eastern mysticism. Whenever you hear a rock band described as âBeatlesqueâ, theyâre often emulating one of Ringoâs bouncing-ball grooves; artists like the Beastie Boys and The Chemical Brothers retrofitted his most booming breaks for the rap/rave age. While Ringo may have continued to cultivate the image of jovial entertainer in his solo work, thereâs still so much more complexity behind his humour. He uses it as a balm on the 1973 hard life lesson âIt Donât Come Easyâ, which he co-wrote with Harrison, and he gives voice to Lennonâs bitingly sardonic lyrics on âGoodnight Viennaâ and âIâm the Greatestâ."
