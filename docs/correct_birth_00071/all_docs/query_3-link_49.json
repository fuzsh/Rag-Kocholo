        "text": "Ringo Starr\n\nFull Name: Richard Starkey\n\nProfession: Beatles Drummer, Singer, and Actor\n\nBiography: Ringo Starr, a featured member of Rory Storm and The Hurricanes, became the final piece of the Beatles puzzle when he replaced drummer Pete Best in 1962.\n\nRichard Starkey was raised in Dingle, a poor neighborhood of Liverpool. His father left the family when he was 4. A sickly child, \"Ritchie\" spent months at time in hospital recovering from peritonitis and tuberculosis. As part of his therapy, he started playing music. He was encouraged by his family, including his step-father, who purchased him a drum kit.\n\nIn the late 1950s he played in various rockabilly and skiffle bands before joining the Hurricanes, and becoming \"Ringo Starr\". He first met the Beatles when both groups were performing in Germany. When the Beatles secured a recording contract, producer George Martin expressed concern about Best, and the band opted to offer Ringo the position.\n\nHe provided a steady back-beat with a unique sound due in part to his being left-handed. Each album featured a turn as lead vocalist, with highlights being \"Yellow Submarine\" and \"With A Little Help From My Friends\". His happy-go-lucky demeanor and comic sensibilities were highlighted in the group's films; he continued working in the medium through the 1980s, including a stint on the \"Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\"/\"Shining Time Station\" children's television program.\n\nAs a solo artist, his greatest success was 1973's \"Ringo\" album which yielded two #1 singles - \"Photograph\" and \"You're Sixteen\". He appeared on some of the solo work of all the other Beatles - the only one to do so.\n\nAfter a stint in detox for alcohol issues, he re-invigorated his career in 1989 launching the \"All-Starr Band\", featuring a revolving cast of musicians sharing the spotlight. They continue to tour intermittently.\n\nIn 2010, Starr was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and in 2015 became the last Beatle to be inducted as a solo artist to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2018, as Richard Starkey, he was knighted in recognition for his service to music.\n\nHe has been married twice - to British hairdresser Maureen Cox, from 1965 to1975, with whom he had three children; and to American model and actress Barbara Bach since 1980.\n\nBorn: July 7, 1940\n\nBirthplace: Liverpool, England, United Kingdom\n\nAge: 84 years old\n\nGeneration: Silent Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Dragon\n\nStar Sign: Cancer\n\nArticles and Photos\n\nThe Beatles?
