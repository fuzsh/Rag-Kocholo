        "text": "Ringo Starr\n\nRingo Starr, the lead drummer for the British sensation band, the Beatles, shares a title given amongst all the band members: Ordained Minister.\n\nBorn in 1940 in Liverpool England, Ringo was known by his family to have a particular gift for drumming. He spent most of his early years playing in a band called Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After playing in London, he met with soon-to-be Beatle John Lennon and Sir Paul McCartney and was asked to replace the Beatles former drummer.\n\nAfter the bands breakup, Ringo set out on his own solo career, releasing albums Sentimental Journey (1970) Beaucoup of Blues (1971). Ringo (1973), and more. He also acted in such films as 200 Motels (1971), Thatâ€™ll Be the Day (1973) and Son of Dracula (1974). He also starred in the comedy Caveman (1981) where he met his future wife Barbara Bach.\n\nThrough all of this historic career, Ringo has also received his credentials at the Universal Life Church. We welcome Ringo into the hall of fame of people whom have also received their ordination credentials."
