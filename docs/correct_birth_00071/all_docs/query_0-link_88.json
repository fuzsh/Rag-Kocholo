        "text": "Devotees of the Fab Four have said proposals to demolish 9 Madryn Street in the Dingle district of Liverpool, where Starr, whose real name is Richard Starkey, was born on July 7 1940, is the equivalent of knocking down William Shakespeare’s home.\n\nEver since Beatlemania engulfed the world in the mid 1960s the address has become a vital part of any fans’ pilgrimage to the band’s home city attracting thousands of visitors each year.\n\nBut unlike the childhood homes of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, which are now owned and run by the National Trust, Ringo’s former house has fallen into disrepair and has been earmarked for demolition since 2005 along with a number of surrounding roads, known locally as the Welsh Streets.\n\nA wave of public opposition has already earned the area one stay of execution, but firms have now been asked to bid for the demolition contract, sparking a fresh wave of opposition from Beatles fans.\n\nOne option being considered in an attempt to appease sentimental Beatles fans is to dismantle the house brick by brick and rebuild it at Liverpool’s Museum of Life, which is due to open next year in Liverpool’s dock area.\n\nBut that option has been resolutely dismissed by Beatles’ fans who regard such a suggestion as a gross insult to one of Liverpool’s most famous sons.\n\n“If the council in Stratford wanted to knock down Shakespeare's birthplace and move it to the NEC there would be outrage. The only difference between the two is that Shakespeare has a four hundred year head-start on the Beatles.”\n\nHe added: “If they move it to the museum it will lose the sense of the area where it stands. Seeing it in a museum is just not going to have the same impact as visiting the street where Ringo was born.\n\n“Ringo Starr lived in other houses, but he was only born in one. If it's knocked-down – even if it is moved – fans all over the world are going to be up in arms. They will just not understand how Liverpool can carry-out this kind of cultural vandalism.”\n\nStarr, who has homes in Los Angeles, Monte Carlo and Surrey, has expressed his dismay at plans to knock down his childhood home and has also said he is opposed to plans to relocate it to a museum.\n\nSpeaking in 2007 he said: “If you want to see where I come from, it's no good putting me in the Wirral. It only works, as far as I can see, if it's there (Madryn Street).\"\n\nLocals have also called for the area to be given a new lease of life rather than bulldozed.\n\nRetired Isobel McDonagh, 70, who has lived close to Madryn Street for over 40 years, said: “The house does bring a lot of tourists to the area, but it is embarrassing to see people looking at a boarded up house.\n\nShe added: “Ringo said it should be preserved, so maybe they should ask him for the\n\nA member of staff in the Liverpool City Council Estates office said: “We are putting the demolition contract out to tender for private demolition contractors. That is the stage that we are at.”"
