        "text": "Beatle Ringo Starr's birthplace has been saved from demolition, Housing Minister Grant Shapps has said.\n\nNine Madryn Street, in Dingle, was set to be knocked down by Liverpool City Council as part of regeneration plans for the Welsh Streets area of the city.\n\nMr Shapps said \"a tide of community support\" had saved the home, which he described as a \"beacon of Beatlemania\".\n\nThe house is one of 16 on the street to be spared, although 400 other homes in the area will be pulled down.\n\nAbout 32 properties in the Welsh Streets area, including 9 Madryn Street, will now be refurbished and put on the market.\n\nThe housing minister also confirmed Â£14m would be available to help to bring empty homes in the Anfield area back into use.\n\nMr Shapps said: \"Ringo Starr's home is a significant beacon of Beatlemania.\n\n\"But it's also a lot more than that - a real example of communities having the power and voice to step in and save the places they treasure most.\n\n\"Its future will now be in the hands of local residents - if they can make a success of this street then many more similar houses and streets could be saved."
