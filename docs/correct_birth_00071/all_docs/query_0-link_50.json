        "text": "Ringo Starrâs childhood home is now worth less than Â£600.\n\nAccounts show that the terraced house on Madryn Street - worth Â£60,000 in April 2013 - now has a value of just Â£525.\n\nThe property is one of hundreds in the Welsh Streets area of the Dingle that were all together worth around Â£17m when bought by the council but are now worth around Â£1m.\n\nAll the houses are currently in possession of the council and Plus Dane housing association and are due either to be demolished or refurbished as part of a major regeneration project.\n\nBut critics have consistently argued that more of the houses should be saved than knocked down, despite council claims they are of little historical or cultural merit.\n\nThe former Beatleâs house was for several years owned by Merseytravel, and is regularly visited by coach parties of Fab Four fans.\n\nBut there is a stark contrast between the value of his childhood home and that of the houses the other three Beatles lived in.\n\nJohn Lennonâs childhood home in Newcastle Road in Wavertree sold for just under half a million pounds in October last year, despite a guide price of around Â£150,000.\n\nGeorge Harrisonâs childhood home in Upton Green in Speke is set to be auctioned at the Cavern for upwards of Â£100,000, and both Paul McCartneyâs family home in Forthlin Road in Speke and Lennonâs Menlove Avenue semi are National Trust properties.\n\nJonathan Brown, from SAVE Britainâs Heritage, said: âTo paraphrase John Lennon talking about Ringo, this isnât the best house in the world. Itâs not even the best house in Liverpool, but it does draw thousands of tourists from all around the world, and youâve got to wonder how little they must think Liverpool values The Beatles to let these houses be run down in this way.â\n\nCouncil cabinet member for housing Cllr Ann O'Byrne said: \"This is one of the properties that will be saved, therefore the value of that house will increase once we can continue with the scheme.\n\n\"If SAVE had not objected (and caused a public inquiry into the scheme), we would have been on with this by now. It's because they interfered that this house has devalued the way it has.\""
