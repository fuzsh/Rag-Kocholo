        "text": "Few bands have had as much influence on global music as The Beatles. Since rising to fame in the 1960s, John, Paul, George and Ringo went on to become a symbol of pop culture recognized all over the world, inspiring countless numbers to start their own bands or change their sound.\n\nYet it’s in their hometown Liverpool where their success left the greatest legacy. A 2016 report commissioned by Liverpool city council said the value of the Fab Four’s legacy to the city was almost $100 million and created more than 2,000 jobs. It’s easy to see why. Beatlemania is still alive and well on the streets of this former European Capital of Culture.\n\nSeveral tour operators offer guided tours of relevant sites, but it’s also perfectly possible to take a DIY approach. There are many Beatles-related attractions within walking distance of each other, while some in the southeast of the city will require a bus trip or your own transport.\n\nArriving in Liverpool\n\nVisitors to the city will see signs of the group upon arrival by air or sea. Previously displayed in Liverpool’s Albert Dock, the famous Yellow Submarine sculpture made by shipyard apprentices in the 1980s now stands outside the entrance of John Lennon Airport.\n\nWhile the sculpture has been relocated, those arriving by sea are still greeted by the Fab Four. A striking sculpture of John, Paul, George and Ringo seeming to walk through the streets of their city stands outside the Mersey ferry terminal and a short stroll from the cruise port.\n\nWhen one museum just isn’t enough\n\nA natural first stop on any musical itinerary in Liverpool is to visit the Beatles Museum to get some context into everything else you’ll see during your stay. The issue is which one to pick.\n\nThe Beatles Story at Albert Dock bills itself as the world’s largest permanent exhibition devoted to the band, so it’s a good place to start.\n\nAudio guides available in 12 languages guide visitors around the various themed rooms full of memorabilia including original instruments, rare photography, original handwritten lyrics and band members’ clothing. Entrance costs £18 ($21) and should be booked in advance.\n\nJust down the street from the iconic Cavern Club, the three-floor Beatles Museum shows off 1,000 items primarily from the band’s early years in Liverpool and Hamburg. General admission is steep at £17 ($20) but this is a must-do for true Beatles fans.\n\nCompletists should also check out the Beatles collections at the waterfront Museum of Liverpool. It chronicles their journey through significant objects from the band’s history and the vast amount of Beatles merchandise that has been produced over the years, from nylon stockings to a yellow submarine lunchbox.\n\nThe Cavern Club\n\nAside from the museums, Mathew Street will be the first destination for all Beatles fans visiting Liverpool. It’s here you’ll find the legendary Cavern Club and a legion of fans getting selfies outside.\n\nStill going strong today as a live music venue, the Cavern Club is where the group found its musical identity. After debuting in February 1961, the Beatles quickly established themselves as the club’s signature act, playing an astonishing 292 gigs at the tiny venue over the course of just 2.5 years.\n\nAlthough the club went through some tough times when it could no longer afford to book the Beatles and closed several times, it has since reopened albeit in a slightly different location and has gone on to thrive thanks to the band’s legacy.\n\nOutside the club, the Liverpool Wall of Fame chronicles this golden age by recognizing artists from the city that achieved a number one hit. Unsurprisingly it’s dominated by the Beatles.\n\nAlthough the museums and Cavern Club are likely enough to satisfy most fans, those wanting the full Beatles experience will need to head to the southeast of the city to see the childhood homes and places immortalized in song.\n\nThe homes of the Beatles\n\nMost guided Beatles tours pass by or stop off at the childhood homes of some of the group, but this is of limited interest.\n\nThe only way to get inside is to join a guided tour offered by the National Trust. This £11 ($13) tour includes visits to the childhood homes of both John Lennon and Paul McCartney.\n\nRingo Starr’s birthplace was in a sorry state until recently. Part of the abandoned terraced houses of the Welsh Streets neighborhood, the house and all of Madryn Street had been left to rot following disagreements over demolition and refurbishment projects. After more than a decade of delays, the street was renovated as part of a major housing renewal project in 2018.\n\nSong references around Liverpool\n\nAny place referenced in a Beatles song is now a shrine of sorts to the band. From Penny Lane and Strawberry Field to the gravestone and statue of Eleanor Rigby, there is plenty to see for the completist.\n\nPenny Lane is now a popular student area, home to student accommodation, charity stores and cheap takeouts. Written primarily by McCartney, the song references many people and sights from the area in the 1960s. Some of those sights are long gone, while others including the shelter ‘in the middle of the roundabout’ remain.\n\nClose to Lennon’s childhood home in Woolton, Strawberry Field, the former Salvation Army children’s home where John Lennon played as a child, reopened in 2019. It’s now home to an interactive visitor exhibition, cafe and shop. Inside, a program for young adults with learning disabilities helps get them into employment, while calm gardens are provided outside for spiritual reflection. Entry beyond the beyond red gates is free but tickets must be booked in advance for the interactive exhibition at £11 ($13).\n\nWhile the song Eleanor Rigby isn’t about a real person, the imagined lady from the song is nevertheless immortalized with a bronze statue on Stanley Street.\n\nThere’s also a curiosity hiding in the graveyard of St. Peter’s Church. A Rigby family grave includes an ‘Eleanor’ who died at the age of 44 in 1939. Despite McCartney confirming several times that the song was not about her, the family gravestone has become a must-visit place for Beatles completists.\n\nHow to end your day\n\nBeatles fans are spoilt for choice when it comes to evening entertainment. Mathew Street is an obvious place to start, with Beatles tribute bands at the Cavern Club and live music everyday at Sgt Peppers.\n\nWhether you’ve always dreamed of performing with the band or you’re caught up in the atmosphere of a Beatles weekend in Liverpool, you could do worse than end your night at MBox karaoke bar on Renshaw Street. Too shy? Private rooms are available to reserve."
