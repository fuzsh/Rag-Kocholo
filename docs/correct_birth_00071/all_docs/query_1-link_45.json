        "text": "Actor / Rock Musician\n\nPlace Of Birth:\n\nLiverpool, England\n\nBest Known As:\n\nThe drummer for The Beatles\n\nName at birth: Richard Starkey\n\nRingo Starr played drums with Rory Storm and The Hurricanes from 1959 until 1962, when he replaced Pete Best permanently as a member of The Beatles. Together with John Lennon, George Harrison and Paul McCartney, Ringo became world famous. Musically he was known for steadiness rather than flash, and his jolly, guileless image helped him launch an acting career. After The Beatles broke up, Ringo had a solo recording career, releasing hits such as \"It Don't Come Easy\" and \"Photograph.\" He also appeared in movies, including The Magic Christian (1969) and 200 Motels (1971). In 1988 he was nominated for an Emmy for his role as Mr. Conductor in the children's television show Shining Time Station. Since 1990 Starr has occasionally performed and recorded with Ringo And The All-Starr Band, which sometimes included his son, Zak Starkey.\n\nExtra Credit\n\nStarr flashes the two-fingered “peace” sign as a kind of personal trademark. In 2008 he asked fans around the world to flash the sign at noon on July 7th, his 68th birthday… The same year he told fans he’d stop accepting mail requests for autographs; he was previously famous for replying to all requests… Ringo married his second wife, actress Barbara Bach, on 27 April 1981; they met in 1980 on the set of the movie Cave Man (released in 1981)… Zak Starkey has also played extensively with The Who… Starr appeared in only the first season of Shining Time Station; he was succeeded as Mr. Conductor by comedian George Carlin."
