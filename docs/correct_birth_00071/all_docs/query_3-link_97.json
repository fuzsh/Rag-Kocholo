        "text": "Ringo Starr has been getting by with a little help from his friends since he voiced the Billy Shears character on the Beatles’ 1967 classic “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.”\n\nAnd he’s been doing that for the past 34 years with his All-Starr Band.\n\nThe concept is a simple one; Starr gets a group of, well, all-stars together most every year to hit the road and play his solo hits and Beatles’ favorites, as well as their own material. The latest incarnation, which hit the road back in May, includes guitarists Steve Lukather (Toto) and Colin Hay (Men at Work), multi-instrumentalist Edgar Winter, bassist Hamish Stuart (Average White Band, Paul McCartney), Detroit-born drummer Gregg Bissonette and multi-instrumentalist Warren Ham.\n\nStarr has more on his plate, meanwhile. A new four-song EP, “Rewind Forward” — which includes contributions from Beatles mate Paul McCartney, brother-in-law Joe Walsh, Ian Hunter, members of Tom Petty’s Heartbreakers and others — comes out Oct. 13. And Starr has been involved with the recording of “Now and Then,” a new (and final) Beatles track built from a demo by the late John Lennon, though no release date has been announced for it yet. And he, along with McCartney, played on Dolly Parton’s new version of the Beatles’ “Let It Be” for her upcoming (Nov. 13) album “Rockstar”…\n\n• Starr, 83, (real name Richard Starkey) has been touring almost annually since the launching the All-Starr format back in 1989, and he said during a pre-tour press conference that he’s always enjoyed being a working musician. “I’d rather play every night than have a day off. If I’m on the road I want to play. I don’t want to sit in the hotel and relax for three days. I want to get out there and play. It’s just who I am. I love to do it. It’s not grueling; playing has never been grueling. I promise you, we COULD play every night — but Edgar needs a day off.” (laughs)\n\n• Starr added that much of the magic of the All-Starrs is that it’s treated as a band rather than him as a solo act. “I love to play with these guys. With this band it’s great, ’cause everybody takes the weight. With Paul (McCartney), he’s, like, The Man, so he has to take time off to get himself back together. But ’cause we’re this crowd…it’s easier. When I first started putting All-Starr Bands together we would change the band completely. I did that for 20 years, but now…I’ve only changed to people this year for tis band. This band’s good for me.”\n\n• “Rewind Forward” is Starr’s four EP in just over two years, and he continues to prefer the format to making a full-length album. “I just felt EPs, you could sort of look at it in a serious way and you can do it in a month. An album does take longer, so (EPs are) what I’ve been doing…And I get to meet and actually work with people I’ve never worked with, which I’ve always found exciting.”\n\n• Starr has two additional EPs planned for the near future, though with no titles or release dates yet. One was recorded entirely with Linda Perry, the former 4 Non Blondes member who contributed songs to his previous two EPs. “We got to know each other and I love her She’s just great. She said, ‘Oh, Ringo, let me do it. ‘OK, do what you do. The only thing I’ll be doing on that EP is playing drums and singing.”\n\n• The other EP is country flavored, which Starr plans to work on after the current All-Starr Band tour wraps on Oct. 13. It was inspired, he says, after a chance meeting with meeting with Grammy Award-winning producer and songwriter T-Bone Burnett. “I asked (Burnett) to help us out. I (said) if he’s got any time and wants to do it…Well, he did want to do it, and he sent me, I promise you, one of the most beautiful country songs, tracks, I’ve heard in a long time. It’s very old school country. It’s beautiful. So I thought, ‘Hey, I’m gonna make a country EP!'”\n\nRingo Starr & His All-Starr Band perform Saturday, Oct. 7 at the Masonic Temple Theatre, 500 Temple St., Detroit.
