        "text": "The threat of demolition is once again hanging over the Liverpool birthplace of Beatles drummer Ringo Starr.\n\nThe Victorian terrace at Madryn Street, Toxteth, is one of hundreds in the \"Welsh Streets\" area to be bulldozed to make way for modern family homes.\n\nDiscussions to move number nine - where Richard Starkey was born on 7 July 1940 - to the new Museum of Liverpool are currently on hold.\n\nBut official demolition notices have now re-appeared in the street.\n\nMadryn Street is one of a number of roads earmarked for the second phase of the Pathfinder scheme, which will see the bulldozers enter in March 2011.\n\nAlthough Liverpool City Council owns the majority of the properties - which are mainly empty - number nine is owned privately.\n\nThe authority remains in negotiations with the owner but could end up pursuing a compulsory purchase order (CPO) for the property.\n\n\"The properties in the Welsh Streets are in such a poor condition that demolition is the only option,\" said a council spokesman.\n\n\"The city council owns 95% of the properties in this area and there are only two remaining residents who we are currently in discussions with.\n\n\"Once demolition is complete, high quality residential developments will be built of affordable homes for sale and socially-rented housing offering the modern desirable homes with gardens which local residents deserve.\n\n\"Regeneration will hopefully secure a brighter future for an area which has previously suffered from blight and abandonment.\"\n\nTalks between the council and National Museums Liverpool (NML) about the future of Starr's birthplace are currently on hold until the council can secure ownership.\n\nHowever, NML bosses said reports suggesting they wanted to move the house in its entirety were wide of the mark.\n\nDavid Fleming, NML director, said: \"We did have discussions with the City Council about a home once lived in by Ringo Starr.\n\n\"We hoped that, should the house be demolished, we could save part of it and show it in the new Museum of Liverpool.\n\n\"These discussions were some time ago and we are unaware of any current plans for the house.\"\n\nThe \"Welsh Streets\" area got its nickname after homes in the area, constructed for Welsh dockers working on the waterfront, were built using brick from Wales.\n\nRingo Starr, now 70, lived at the house for about three months before he moved to Admiral Grove, where he lived for about 20 years.\n\nLiverpool City Council previously said the house had \"no historical significance\" because of the short time Starr spent there.\n\nBeatles tourists can still visit the houses where John Lennon and Paul McCartney grew up in the city.\n\nThe National Trust owns Lennon and McCartney's childhood homes in Menlove Avenue and Forthlin Road respectively."
