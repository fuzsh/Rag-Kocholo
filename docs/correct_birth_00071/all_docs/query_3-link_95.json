The new single “Gonna Need Someone” and three other brand-new tracks on Ringo’s new ‘Crooked Boy’ EP are available to stream and download now and arriving on CD and vinyl on May 31st. “CrookedBoy EP”\n\nThe Crooked Boy EP And Who Is Linda Perry?\n\nThe new Ringo Starr effort received some help from Linda Perry, who wrote and produced it. Linda has written and produced some of the biggest songs for incredible artists. She’s also worked with Dolly Parton, Britney Spears, Alicia Keys, Courtney Love, and Celine Dion. Over the last few years, she’s been working with Ringo Starr. This new effort for Ringo, Crooked Boy. Written and produced by Linda Perry for Starr to make his own, adding vocals and playing drums.\n\nHow Did Linda Perry And Ringo Come Together To Work On The EP?\n\nAccording to an article on Udiscovermusic.com, Linda Perry tells how it all came to working with a former Beatle. I got a cold text from his producer who said, “Hey, Ringo wants to call you,” and I’m like, “OK.” He said he liked my songwriting and wanted to know if I wanted to write a song for one of his EPs. He said, “Maybe every six months, I make a four-song EP. I just want to have fun and put music out there. No big expectations. And would you like to write a song?” So that’s kind of how it started.\n\nLinda previously collaborated on two songs that appeared on earlier Ringo EPs. Linda asked Ringo if she could produce an entire EP, “Crooked Boy.” The result, consisting of “February Sky,” “Gonna Need Someone,” and “Adeline,” is the EP.\n\nRead the whole incredible story on Udiscovermusic.com\n\nIs The New EP Available In Different Formats?\n\nThe EP was released on a limited-edition marble vinyl on Record Store Day, April 20, 2024. Fans can pre-order the black vinyl and CD now, which will be released on May 31. The EP is also available to stream and download now.\n\nHow Many Releases Does Ringo Have Post Beatles Era?\n\nRingo Starr has released 20 studio albums and 46 singles, 43 movie appearances, and one Oscar in 1971 for the movie, “Let It Be.”\n\nRingo Starr Is Back Out On Tour Again\n\nThere is no time to rest, as Ringo announced new tour dates for his Ringo & His All Starr Band Fall Tour, which kicks off in May. As of yet, there are no Detroit dates, so I believe a trip to Vegas can now be explained to your wife why you have to leave on vacation.\n\nRock Hall 2024: Reactions from Inductees\n\nBorn in Mt Clemens, Screamin’ Scott has been a part of the Detroit airwaves for 30-plus years. With 40 years of experience in radio. When he’s not out on the streets for WCSX, you can find him devoting time to local charities with his, “Screamin Angels”; and for 16 years with Rock 4 Tots charity. And last 10 years with his local band, \"Chit!.\" Screamin Scott likes to write about nostalgic Detroit area memories, classic rock, and local metro Detroit topics."
