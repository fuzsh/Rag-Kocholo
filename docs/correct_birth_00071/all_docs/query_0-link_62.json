        "text": "Not just a key member of the Fab Four, but also an incredible Starr in his own right.\n\n\"Ringo wasn’t the best drummer in the world... Let's face it, he wasn’t even the best drummer in The Beatles,\" so joked John Lennon, Jasper Carrott Phillip Pope (with the line written by Geoffrey Perkins).\n\nA funny-if-cheeky gag, and obviously one that has zero basis in reality.\n\n'Free as a Bird' and 'Real Love': The story of the last \"new\" Beatles songs\n\nListen to the Gold 60s Live Playlist on Global Player\n\nWho is the Fifth Beatle? George Martin, Brian Epstein, Pete Best and more\n\nYeah, Paul McCartney could hold down a beat, but Ringo Starr's mistake-free, metronomic drumming was the backbone of The Beatles' music, and on songs like 'A Day In The Life' and 'Tomorrow Never Knows' he proved he could do the fancy stuff, too.\n\nThe Beatles only really became The Beatles when Ringo Starr joined the band, replacing the \"mean, moody, and magnificent\" Pete Best.\n\nSo it's long overdue a celebration of Ringo Starr, with a closer look at his life before, during and after his time in the Fab Four.\n\nHow old is Ringo Starr and where did he grow up?\n\nRingo Starr was born on July 7, 1940 at 9 Madryn Street in Dingle in Liverpool. He celebrated his 82nd birthday in 2022.\n\nHe was the only child of confectioners Richard Starkey and Elsie Gleave. The family moved to Admiral Grove, still in Dingle, when Ringo was just four.\n\nWith Ringo's dad frequently absent, his mum took on jobs as a cleaner and then barmaid to make ends meet.\n\nRingo was frequently absent from his Sefton Park school. He contracted peritonitis after an appendectomy and ended up in a coma for several days, with a year-long recovery away from his family at Myrtle Street Hospital.\n\nWith extra tuition, he soon caught up, but poor Ringo then contracted TB and had to spend two years in a sanatorium. He eventually attended St Silas primary school, and then Dingle Vale Secondary Modern.\n\nAfter school, he had failed stints as a British Rail worker, a waiter on a day boat, and a machinist.\n\nWhat is Ringo Starr's real name, and when did he change it?\n\nRingo Starr was born Richard Starkey, just like his dad. He was nicknamed Richy, with his dad (when he was around) being dubbed \"Big Ritchie\".\n\nIt was in late 1959 when the younger Richard Starkey adopted the stage name Ringo Starr, while playing in the skiffle-turned-rock-n-roll band eventually called Rory Storm and the Hurricanes (more on them imminently).\n\nHe chose the name as a nod to the many rings he wore on his fingers, which would later be a crucial plot device in Beatles' movie Help!, with Starr giving a country and western vibe.\n\nHow did Ringo Starr get into music?\n\nRingo's mum and dad were big fans of singing, dancing and swing, but it was during his long recovery from TB that Ringo really got into music, and drumming specifically.\n\nPlaying in a hospital band, he was given a mallet made from a cotton bobbin which he'd use to hit his bedside cabinets.\n\n\"I was in the hospital band ... that's where I really started playing,\" Ringo said later. \"I never wanted anything else from there on\n\n\"My grandparents gave me a mandolin and a banjo, but I didn't want them. My grandfather gave me a harmonica... we had a piano – nothing. Only the drums.\"\n\nIt was when he was working as a machinist that Ringo struck up a friendship with Roy Trafford, who introduced him to the popular skiffle sound.\n\nRingo co-founded the well-regarded Eddie Miles Band, later the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group and Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares.\n\nHe then joined Al Caldwell's Texans who became The Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans, and finally Rory Storm and the Hurricanes.\n\nThe Hurricanes were a significant local success story around Liverpool and also picked up residencies in Butlins, US Airforce Bases and eventually in Hamburg.\n\nWhen did Ringo Starr join The Beatles?\n\nWhile it's impossible to think of The Beatles without Ringo Starr, he was a relative latecomer to the band.\n\nPete Best was still drumming with the group when Ringo first met them on October 1, 1960. He was playing with the Hurricanes at Bruno Koschmider's Kaiserkeller in Hamburg, who were headlining above the Beatles at the time.\n\nHe occasionally stood in for Best, and couple of weeks later, he even recorded with John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison, when the lads who would eventually become the Fab Four backed Hurricanes singer Lu Walters on a version of 'Summertime'.\n\nRingo's talent turned heads, and Beatles associate Tony Sheridan was among those wanting to nab him for his own band. Indeed, Ringo briefly quit the Hurricanes to join Sheridan in early 1962, before returning to Rory Storm's gang for another Butlins stint.\n\nThen, on August 14, Ringo accepted John Lennon's invitation to join The Beatles. Two days later Brian Epstein told Pete Best: \"I've got some bad news for you. The boys want you out and Ringo in.\"\n\nHe played as an official member of the Beatles on August 18, 1962 at a horticultural society dance at Port Sunlight, while it all kicked off the following day after his Cavern Club bow with the band.\n\nBest's fans kicked off chanting \"Pete Best forever! Ringo never!\", with Brian Epstein's car tyres being flattened and George Harrison even getting a black eye.\n\nDespite his swift acceptance as a drummer and a Beatle by the rest of the gang, George Martin initially wasn't sure about his actual playing, hiring Andy White as a session player for both sides of the 'Love Me Do' / 'PS I Love You' single, with Ringo relegated to tambourine and maracas.\n\nRingo naturally feared the worst (\"That's the end, they're doing a Pete Best on me\") but from then on it was all Ringo, all the time. The Fab Four had arrived.\n\nWhat Beatles songs did Ringo write and which did he sing?\n\nThe songwriting partnership of John Lennon and Paul McCartney was so incredible and so prolific, it was hard for anyone else to get a look in.\n\nEven someone as talented as George Harrison could only get a sprinkling of his own songs on Beatles albums, it'd be a lot to ask Ringo to rack up the songwriting credits.\n\nWith that said, he did have two sole songwriting credits: 'Don't Pass Me By' on The Beatles (aka The White Album), and 'Octopus's Garden' on Abbey Road.\n\nHe also has joint writing credit on a few others: 'What Goes On' from Rubber Soul (Lennon-McCartney-Starr), 'Flying' from Magical Mystery Tour (Lennon-McCartney-Harrison-Starr), 'Dig It' from Let It Be (Lennon-McCartney-Harrison-Starr) and the adaptation of the trad 'Maggie May', also from Let It Be (Lennon-McCartney-Harrison-Starr).\n\nHe also was a named co-writer with all the other Beatles on the seasonal special 'Christmastime is Here Again', Anthology jams '12-Bar Original' and 'Los Paranoias', and the \"reunion\" single 'Free As A Bird'.\n\nAs for what Beatles songs Ringo sang, there are many, many more.\n\nThe full list is:\n\nBoys\n\nI Want To Be Your Man\n\nMatchbox\n\nHoney, Don’t\n\nAct Naturally\n\nWhat Goes On\n\nYellow Submarine\n\nWith a Little Help from My Friends\n\nFlying (co-lead wordless vocals)\n\nDon’t Pass Me By\n\nGood Night\n\nOctopus’s Garden\n\nCarry That Weight\n\nShout\n\nIf You've Got Trouble\n\nWhen did Ringo quit The Beatles and when did he return?\n\nThe story of the break-up of The Beatles has been picked apart for decades, and it's always worth noting that the first person to ever quit the Fab Four was actually Ringo Starr.\n\nIt was during the strained recording of The Beatles (aka The White Album). Many of the songs of that album are recorded by only three, two or even one of the band as things became to fracture.\n\nThings eventually got so tense, that Ringo actually quit The Beatles and went on holiday to Sardinia.\n\n\"I felt I wasn’t playing great,\" Ringo later said. \"I also felt that the other three were really happy and I was an outsider. There was no magic and the relationships were terrible.\"\n\nWhile away, the culinarily unadventurous Ringo demurred when offered a dish of octopus, but the following conversation did inspire Starr's future songwriting masterpiece.\n\nTwo weeks later he returned, and George Harrison even covered his drumkit in flowers to welcome him back to the band.\n\nWhat were Ringo's biggest songs and albums after The Beatles?\n\nGeorge Harrison arguably made the biggest splash after The Beatles with the triple album All Things Must Pass. John Lennon made maybe the greatest post-Beatles album with John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. After a lo-fi start, Paul McCartney had the most sustained, successful post-Beatles career.\n\nBut despite the competition from his bandmates, Ringo had a decent solo career of his own, usually backed by a smorgasbord of special guests, while he continues to tour with his All Starr band to this day.\n\nFirst came the oldie standards album Sentimental Journey in 1970, and just five months later there was the country and western-tinged Beaucoup of Blues.\n\nA couple of hit non-album singles (both produced by and one co-written by George Harrison) followed before Ringo recorded probably his best-known solo work, the self-titled Ringo.\n\nNot just a top ten album on both sides of the Atlantic, Ringo was also notable for a nearly-complete Beatles reunion on the John Lennon-written 'I'm The Greatest', which featured Starr, Lennon, George Harrison, and long-time Beatles associates and occasional \"Fifth Beatles\" Klaus Voormann and Billy Preston.\n\nElsewhere on the album, 'Six O'Clock' was written by, and featured, Paul and Linda McCartney.\n\nHe never quite reached those peaks again, but Ringo has gone on to release 20 studio albums and around 50 singles since.\n\nHis biggest songs include:\n\nBeaucoups of Blues\n\nIt Don't Come Easy\n\nBack Off Boogaloo\n\nPhotograph\n\nYou're Sixteen\n\nOh My My\n\nOnly You (And You Alone)\n\nSnookeroo\n\nNo No Song\n\nA Dose of Rock 'n' Roll\n\nWings\n\nDrowning in the Sea of Love\n\nLipstick Traces (On a Cigarette)\n\nWrack My Brain\n\nIn My Car\n\nWeight of the World\n\nLa De Da\n\nLiverpool 8\n\nWhat films has Ringo Starr appeared in?\n\nGeorge Harrison had a massive impact on film history as a producer with a hand in Monty Python's Life of Brian, Time Bandits, The Long Good Friday, Mona Lisa, Shanghai Surprise, Withnail and I and How to Get Ahead in Advertising.\n\nBut despite a few cameos in some of those films, and despite the obvious star quality of Paul McCartney and John Lennon, it's Ringo Starr who had the most significant acting career out of all of the Beatles.\n\nWhile he was a Beatle he obviously had roles in A Hard Day's Night, Help!, Magical Mystery Tour (and the outro of Yellow Submarine). Before the break-up, he also had roles in Candy and The Magic Christian.\n\nAfter the split, he featured in Blindman, Son of Dracula, Caveman, Frank Zappa's 200 Motels, Ringo and The Prince and the Pauper. He also popped up in Ken Russell's Listzomania and as himself in Paul McCartney's Give My Regards to Broad Street.\n\nHow many times has Ringo Starr been married and how many children does he have?\n\nThe week Ringo Starr joined The Beatles in 1962, he met hairdresser Maureen Cox at the Cavern Club. She actually kissed Paul first, on a dare, but only had eyes for Starr.\n\nThey hit it off pretty quick, started dating – despite the negative attention from Beatles fans – and got married in February 1965.\n\nThey had three children, Zak, Jason and Lee, but the couple started to disintegrate in 1970, amid Ringo's repeated infidelity and Maureen's own fling with George Harrison (George's wife Pattie had actually caught the pair in bed together).\n\nRingo and Maureen hung on together for a few years, but eventually divorced in 1975.\n\nStarr went on to meet Barbra Bach in 1980 when they were both acting in the movie Caveman, and they were married the following year.\n\nRingo's son Zak is an acclaimed drummer in his own right, and as well as sometimes performing with his dad's All Starr band, he also has drummed with The Who and Oasis.\n\nWhat is Ringo Starr's net worth?\n\nRingo Starr doesn't have the songwriting credits of Paul McCartney or the John Lennon estate, and he doesn't play the sort of arena and stadium shows Macca does either.\n\nBut he's still one-quarter of The Beatles with a hefty back catalogue and filmography, so he's not doing too badly."
