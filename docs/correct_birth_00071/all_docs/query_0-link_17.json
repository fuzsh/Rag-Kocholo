It's all about the peace and love.'\n\nWhile Ms Holmes will be renting out Ringo and George's childhood homes, she is planning a permanent move from London to Liverpool to live in Cynthia Lennon's former house as John is her favourite band member.\n\nRingo's home was known to be a regular haunt for the band, who got together in 1960, when they were younger and other well-known faces on the Merseybeat scene, including the late Cilla Black.\n\nRingo famously crammed 80 people into the cosy home for his 21st birthday and even got married there in 1963.\n\nInside these now stripped and peeling walls was where Beatles drummer Ringo Starr spent his childhood\n\nThe famous house sold for just £70,000 at an auction at Liverpool's legendary Cavern Club yesterday\n\nThe two-bedroom terrace house in Toxteth, Liverpool, will be rented out for the foreseeable future\n\nThis is the kitchen space where Ringo would have cooked his meals up until he was 23 years old\n\nWinning bidder and life-long Beatles fan Jackie Holmes, 48, is developing quite the collection of homes\n\nAnd The Empress pub at the end of the road is famous for appearing on the front of Ringo's first solo album, Sentimental Journey, which was released in 1970.\n\nThe former drummer - whose real name is Richard Starkey - was born at nearby Madryn Street in 1940 but moved to Admiral Grove as a toddler.\n\nAs part of a Beatles tour, crowds of fans can be seen outside the house daily - but special legal measures have been put in place to ensure it is not turned into a museum.\n\nThe Fab Four: Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ringo Starr and John Lennon\n\nRingo Starr pictured in his younger years, and , the former Beatles drummer in 2007\n\nThe rooms where the musician learnt to twist and shout as the Beatles began to grow more popular\n\nIt was said Ringo crammed 80 people into these rooms to celebrate his 21st birthday in 1961\n\nThe pink and white terraced house was bought by Jackie Homes, 48, a life-long fan of Beatles music\n\nClaire Griffiths, executive director of property for the Plus Dane Group, which manage the property, said: 'We've promised that any profits we make from the sale of Ringo Starr's childhood home will be reinvested back into Plus Dane homes in the L8 area.\n\n'We have taken on board the concerns of local residents and have put specific restrictions on the sale of the house so it cannot become a tourist attraction or museum.'"
