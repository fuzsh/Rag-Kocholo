        "text": "The band, who had become a four-piece after they lost their bassist Stuart Sutcliffe following a short residency in Hamburg, were rejected when they tried to get signed.\n\nThey made further recordings in 1962 for EMI and were signed, after which they started recording their first proper record.\n\nIt was during this time concerns were raised about Pete’s drumming, when George Martin replaced him with a session drummer for their first song Love Me Do.\n\nThe producer explained this decision in The Beatles: Anthology: “I decided that the drums, which are really the backbone of a good rock group, didn't give the boys enough support."
