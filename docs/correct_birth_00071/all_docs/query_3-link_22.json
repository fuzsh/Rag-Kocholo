        "text": "(born 1940). The backbeat behind the Beatles’ music, drummer Ringo Starr provided the rhythmic foundation that complemented his partners’ melodies on their phenomenally successful recordings. Often hidden, literally and figuratively, behind his more prominent bandmates, Starr’s contribution to the Beatles was sometimes overlooked, yet it provided the unique cornerstone that catalyzed the band’s shift from popular local band to international phenomenon.\n\nBorn Richard Starkey on July 7, 1940, in Liverpool, England, Starr got the nickname “Ringo” because of his fondness for rings. A sickly child who missed school often, he left school in his early teens and worked as an engineer’s apprentice. He dreamed of becoming a rock star and fashioned drums out of tin cans before getting his first real set in 1959.\n\nStarr became acquainted with members of the Beatles while touring with Rory Storme and the Hurricanes in the early 1960s. EMI signed the Beatles in 1962 but was less than pleased with their drummer, Pete Best. Starr was chosen as the replacement.\n\nPrimarily a background vocalist, Starr sang the lead on a handful of Beatles hits, notably “Yellow Submarine” (1966) and “With a Little Help From My Friends” (1967), the latter from the Grammy-winning Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. His first songwriting credit was “Don’t Pass Me By” (1968).\n\nThe Beatles disbanded in 1970, the same year Starr released a collection of standards called Sentimental Journey and a country album entitled Beaucoups of Blues. In 1971, he wrote and performed the hit “It Don’t Come Easy.” John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison individually contributed material to Ringo (1973), which featured the songs “You’re Sixteen” and “Photograph.” Further chart success came with “Only You” and “No No Song” from Goodnight Vienna (1974). He recorded sporadically in the late 1970s and early 1980s but struggled with substance-abuse problems.\n\nStarr had displayed a comedic flair in various Beatles films, and after the band split up he was offered a number of small roles, including The Magic Christian (1970), 200 Motels (1971), That’ll Be the Day (1974), and Caveman (1981, with his second wife, Barbara Bach). He directed Born to Boogie (1972), a documentary about the British group T. Rex, and appeared in Give My Regards to Broad Street (1984), which starred McCartney."
