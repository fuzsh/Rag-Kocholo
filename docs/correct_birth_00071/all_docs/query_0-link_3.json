        "text": "Ringo Starr‘s birthplace in Liverpool has been saved from the threat of demolition, the Telegraph reports. The house, a run-down three-bedroom Victorian terrace, was one of 400 buildings marked for demolition in the Dingle area of Liverpool, but Beatles fans and city residents have successfully lobbied to save the house, along with 15 others in the area. The Liverpool City Council has agreed to give locals the opportunity to fix up the properties.\n\nThe Liverpool City Council initially resisted efforts to preserve the house because Starr only lived at the location with his family for three months as an infant. The National Trust of England decreed that the house did not merit saving because of his brief stay there at a very early age, and that they simply did not have the means to acquire more than a dozen houses where the Beatles lived as children."
