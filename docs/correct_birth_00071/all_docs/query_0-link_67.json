        "text": "In 1960, Paul McCarthy, John Lennon, Ringo Starr and George Harrison, created a rock band in Liverpool named The Beatles, which without them knowing, would become the most successful and popular rock band in the 20th century. Popular enough that the group was the first group ever to perform at a sports arena because they needed a large enough space for all the people that bought the tickets. The Beatles became so powerful that contributed to a movement called “the British invasion”. Before The Beatles, all the musicians that made it\n\nThe Beatles are one of the most innovative rock bands of all time. They have not only changed the way rock and roll is looked at, but also the way that the music is recorded. They have influenced the artists of the 60s and the 70s, and also many generations later and to come. Originating from Liverpool, England, the Beatles, or the Fab Four, consists of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Topping the charts in ’63 with “Love Me Do,” and bringing in the highest rated viewing in history while performing on the Ed Sullivan Show, the Beatles are definitely a band that broke the sound barrier of rock\n\nThe Beatles originally started off as The Quarrymen in 1957, headed by John Lennon and consisting of other musicians. That same year Paul McCartney was invited to join the group by John Lennon, and eventually joined by George Harrison. In 1958 the groups name was changed to Johnny and the Moondogs (rolling stone article). Two years in 1960 later another member was added and the group was now named The Beatles. During this time The Beatles (with Pete Best playing drums), were playing mostly cover songs of popular artists in Hamburg, until the group came back to England to where they would play at the famous Cavern Club, where their local popularity would take off.\n\nThis is what began fostering the unique sound of The Beatles. So many different genres of music and a breadth of diverse artists inspired them, and consequently their sound became something entirely new. This is how The Beatles began to mold a new image of music, by taking all of the inspirations and melding it to become the epitome of their creativity. By using the Rock and Roll style of Elvis and combining it with other kinds of music they heard they started creating some of the most unique music at the time. They were also making unique music because essentially they were breaking all the rules because they didn’t know any of them. They didn’t have to follow the guidelines of the instruments that they were playing because they had no formal or professional training to teach them how to play. So instead of confining themselves in the wall of their own training they were able to broaden their horizons and break rules. However, this unique sound alone didn’t get them to the top, after Liverpool we shift our focus towards Hamburg, where the band perfected and fine-tuned their art, and acquired a strong stage presence.\n\nAround 1960 in Liverpool, England four young man, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr decided to form a rock band, and they name it The Beatles. However, it all started in the late 1950s when John Lennon formed his first band called The Black Jacks. The band was made up of classmates from the Quarry Bank Grammar School in Liverpool, and after they started, then they changed their name to The Quarrymen, to represent their school. They often played a kind of music called skiffle, which was a mixture of folk, jazz, and blues which was popular in England at the time. In the summer of 1957 a member of the band introduced Lennon to Paul McCartney, and Paul who was very passionate about music auditioned for the band, after he was invited to join the band in late October, 1957.\n\nAlthough the musical group finally decided on what to call themselves, they still were waiting for their big break. Their big break came in the form of a man notice Brian Epstein, a record storeowner. Epstein’s interest was piqued when he heard about a young band making its way through Liverpool. So Epstein decided to go watch \"The Beatles\" perform. Something about the Beatles energy when they play inspired Epstein to become their manager. Pulling a few strings throughout the musical community of Liverpool, Epstein was able to gain \"The Beatles\" a few auditions. After a few auditions, the Beatles were able to get an audition with George Martin, a respected member of Parlophone records. The only part that Martin didn 't like about the Beatles was the drummer, Pete Best. Before a record could be signed Epstein had to replace Best. The new drummer was known as Ringo Starr. At last, \"The Beatles\" we 're complete."
