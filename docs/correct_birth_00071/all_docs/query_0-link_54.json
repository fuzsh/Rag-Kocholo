        "text": "Ringo Starr, born Richard Starkey on July 7, 1940, in Liverpool, England, is a legendary musician, singer, songwriter, and actor. Best known as the drummer for the iconic rock band The Beatles, Starr has left an indelible mark on the world of music and popular culture.\n\nIn 2004, Starr showcased his artistic side with the release of \"Postcards From The Boys,\" a limited edition book published by Genesis Books. Featuring postcards sent to him by fellow Beatles John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison, the book served as a tribute to their friendship and creativity. Proceeds from the book went to the Lotus Foundation charity, reflecting Starr's philanthropic spirit.\n\nIn January 2008, Starr marked a significant milestone in his solo career with the release of \"Liverpool 8,\" his first studio album with Capitol/EMI in over three decades. The album, available globally on CD and digital platforms, showcased Starr's evolving musical style and deeply personal songwriting. With tracks infused with his trademark candor, wit, and soul, \"Liverpool 8\" resonated with audiences worldwide, delivering a universal message of peace and love.\n\nStarr's enduring commitment to his craft and his unwavering dedication to spreading positivity through his music have cemented his status as a beloved music icon."
