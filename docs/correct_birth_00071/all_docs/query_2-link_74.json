        "text": "Biography\n\nRichard Starkey was born July 7, 1940, the first Beatle baby. Much of his childhood is spent in the hospital. His father abandoned the family shortly after his birth. He joined Rory Storm and the Hurricanes and changed his name to Ringo Starr.\n\nHe was the funny Beatle and when the group broke up, he released an album called Sentimental Journey. By 1973, he was the most successful ex-Beatle. By the late 70s, he was the least successful, even though John didn't even release albums during this period. In 1981, he married Barbara Bach, to whom he is currently married."
