The birthplace of former Beatle Ringo Starr is facing demolition.

The Liverpool house has been under the danger of demolition since 2005. A fresh threat has now come in the form of local authorities giving the property, 9 Madryn Street, a final demolition order.

The leader of Liverpool City Council, Joe Anderson, told Clickliverpool.com: “The community in that area have been waiting for 11 years to have these houses demolished and believe they have waited long enough.”

Philip Coppell, chairman of the ongoing Save Madryn Street campaign, argued: “Number 9 is a priceless tourist resource that the city would be mad to destroy.”
