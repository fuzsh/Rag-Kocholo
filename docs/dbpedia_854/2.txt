LETTER FROM THE EDITOR Greetings: World Lighthouse Society Sitting here at my desk on a beautiful autumn morning, I can’t help but to reflect back on the events of the past three months. As you will soon read within these pages, lighthouse preservationists have been working harder than ever to preserve the world’s beacons. In addition, our members have been hard at work spreading the word about the World Lighthouse Society, as evidenced by the number of new members who have joined this quarter. A hearty “thank you” to all of you who have been helping to preserve our maritime heritage in ways large and small, and for helping our Society to grow stronger. Please join me in welcoming the following new WLS members: Keith Woodward (United Kingdom) Mark Lewis (United Kingdom) Jussi Tuovinen (Finland) David & Phyllis Idell (U.S.A.) Oliver Bisanti (France) Hong Kong Maritime Museum (Hong Kong) Christopher Nicholson (England) As you can see, the WLS is continuing to grow. As I’m sure you can guess, putting together the quarterly Newsletter is a tremendous amount of work, and I definitely could not do it without the many wonderful articles contributed by our members. It is a task I find extremely rewarding and I hope to continue as Editor for many more years. However, if the Newsletter is to continue to be of the same or better quality than you have come to expect, I need your help. Due to increased responsibilities in my private life and increased involvement in actively helping to preserve lighthouses and their history, I find that I am struggling to get your Newsletter out to our members in a timely manner. Many of you will notice that we do not have a featured lighthouse history in this issue. Generally I write the feature, one I hope you all enjoy, but this quarter I just could not find the time. I hope to see it return to the pages of the Newsletter, but if that is to happen, I will need volunteers to take over the responsibility for some of the other articles we regularly include in these pages. For example, if you have an interest in lighthouses that are Gone, But Not Forgotten, I am looking for someone who would be willing to do a small amount of research and write a short article to accompany an image of a lost lighthouse. In addition, I am looking for someone who would be willing to take on the responsibility for our Identify the 3 rd QUARTER <strong>2009</strong> NEWSLETTER Volume 7 Issue 3 Light article. Again, this would involve a small amount of research and the writing of a short article. Writing articles for the Newsletter does not take a high degree of skill or advanced knowledge on the topic of maritime history – just a desire to contribute toward making this publication the best it can be. You need only to write the article to the best of your ability and send it to me for any editing it may need. My hope is to have our Newsletter become better than ever while seeing less of my name on its pages, and more of yours! If you have any questions regarding the above mentioned articles or contributing other articles, please feel free to contact me at the address listed below. Many thanks to Peter Williams who has already agreed to handle the Member Profiles for this and future issues of the Newsletter, Gerry Douglas- Sherwood for contributing many of our Book Reviews, Mike Millichamp for starting Now and Then, a photography challenge for our members, and all of the other members who contributed articles for this issue of the Newsletter. Having said all the above, I will now leave you to browse through this issue of the Newsletter. In these pages you will find two new Member Profiles, two Book Reviews, Part 3 of Harold Taylor’s The Light on Top, and so much more. I hope you enjoy reading it, and until next time… Keep the lights burning! Donna Suchomelly 1 Ironstone Drive, Reading, PA 19606, USA.
