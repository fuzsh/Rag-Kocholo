        "text": "Accommodation and WiFi\n\nYour accommodation will be in either a volunteer house, dormitory-style hostel, or a homestay near your placement. All accommodations have been inspected thoroughly by local staff and chosen because of their safety and security.\n\nXiâan accommodation: Youâll stay in a volunteer house located in a compound of apartments with a security guard and a security gate. You can expect to share a bedroom with up to five other volunteers of the same gender. Bedrooms have single beds and bunk beds with bedding provided. Living is basic but comfortable and the volunteer house has electricity, running water and western bathrooms with hot water.\n\nIf you would prefer to not live in a dormitory situation with shared facilities, there is the option of upgrading to a 3-star hotel located nearby. You will have a private room and bathroom with breakfast provided in the hotel restaurant.\n\nWiFi is available for volunteers to use at the volunteer house in Xiâan. You can also purchase a local SIM card with data for an unlocked mobile phone to keep connected.\n\nWeinan accommodation: Volunteers on the Teaching project in Weinan will be accommodated in an apartment within the school grounds. Living is basic but comfortable and you can expect to share a bedroom with up to five other volunteers of the same gender. Bedrooms have single beds and bunk beds with bedding provided. There is WiFi available and western bathrooms with hot water. Weinan is a 1.5 hour trip from Xiâan City and you will travel by metro and train.\n\nVillage accommodation: Generally on the Summer Outreaching Teaching project, you will be accommodated in a dormitory-style hostel at a summer camp or with a local family in a homestay.\n\nThe homestay has electricity and very basic facilities including a squat toilet and due to the lack of heating in these homes, you would usually only be placed in a village during the summer months. Staying with a family is a great way to learn the Chinese way of life, meet local people, eat local food and engage in local customs and traditions. IVHQ gives the family money from your fee for support, food and board. You can expect to share a room with one other volunteer in the homestay.\n\nThe village placements are located 1-4 hours drive from Xiâan and you will be driven there by taxi.\n\nMeals\n\nFood in Xiâan blends traditional Chinese and Middle-Eastern cooking. Flatbread, pita bread and barbecued meat are often sold at street stalls and noodles, soups, dumplings and steamed buns are some of the favorite dishes in Xiâan. Meat is a staple of the Xiâan diet however, there are plenty of vegetable options on offer. Unlike other areas in China, food is generally spicy in Xiâan.\n\nYou will be given breakfast, lunch and dinner during your stay. Typically, volunteers eat breakfast at their accommodation, with lunch and dinner provided at their placement. During weekends you will be provided with brunch, rather than breakfast and lunch.\n\nBottled water is readily available in China and you should budget approximately $5 per week for 2 litres a day. Filtered water is also provided in some of the accommodation.\n\nIf you have any special dietary requirements, please let us know and the local team will do their best to accommodate you. However, you will need to be flexible and should not expect to eat as you normally do at home. We will do our best to see that you are well taken care of."
