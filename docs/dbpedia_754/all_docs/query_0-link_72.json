        "text": "On 5 September 2006, the school and the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Brunei inked the agreement to elect the school as the organising school for Chinese Proficiency Test (HSK) in Brunei, a national standardized test to assess the Chinese language proficiency of non-native speakers. On 9 September, three students from the school secured a scholarship from the school to pursue their academic advancement in China. Students that year also achieved outstanding results in O’ Level and were honoured with 10 Brilliance Awards. In October, the school launched the ground-breaking ceremony of the new school building. On 14 November, the school participated in the Aidilfitri Educational Exhibition in ICC, Berakas and the school was indebted when Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan consented to visit the exhibition booth of the school.\n\nOn 11 March 2007, CHMS Parent-teacher Association was established to involve parents and teachers of kindergarten, primary and secondary in the development of the school. On 8 April, a walkathon to commemorate the 85th anniversary of the school was successfully held and the school was grateful to the Minister of Education Yang Berhormat Pehin Orang Kaya Seri Lela Dato Seri Setia Haji Awang Abdul Rahman to officiate the walkathon. Students of the school again made Chung Hwa proud by their remarkable results in O’ Level whereby one student of the school emerged as the world top in commercial studies. On 29 August, the recycle campaign was successfully launched. On 2 September, the school held a grand funfair to raise fund for the new school building. On 24 October, the renowned philanthropist Madam Aw Sian visited the school."
