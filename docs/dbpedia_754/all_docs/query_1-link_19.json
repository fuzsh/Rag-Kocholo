        "meta_description": "In 1974, the Chinese language was recognised as the official language of Hong Kong under the Official Languages Bill. The Official Languages Bill was the result of a prolonged struggle led by a large number of organisations, student bodies and individual activists. The language movement was the largest social movement during the long 1970s. This chapter examines the organisation of the movement, the motivations of participants, the tactics employed by the activists and the significance of the campaign. The chapter reveals that the language campaign was not monolithic and contained a broad spectrum of public opinion. Although language activists and movement supporters often only identified themselves as Chinese culturally and rarely made direct political associations with the Chinese communist regime, optimism towards Hong Kongâ€™s return to China was expressed. The movement also demonstrated that Hong Kong had many political cultures. University students and elites vigorously engaged in social movements. They were critical of the colonial administration and politically conscious. The middle-aged and elderly groups only joined the movement mostly due to instrumental concerns. The working-class and grassroots groups were predominantly indifferent. Lastly, the movement shows that a reformist colonial administration was responsive to shifting popular sentiment. In response to a coalition demanding legal status for the Chinese language, the colonial government set up the Chinese Language Committee to investigate the issue. To help the bureaucrats to better understand changing public opinion, City District Officers produced Town Talk every week, which was disseminated to policymakers.",
