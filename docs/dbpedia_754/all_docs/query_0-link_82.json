        "text": "To provide quality education to Tiong Hwa community in Brunei, Kapitan China Ong Boon Pang and few dignitaries, after much effort, established a school called York Choi School in 1918. The school had a humble start where it only rented a two-story shop lot as its classroom without a building of its own.\n\nIn 1922, the school was named Chung Hwa School and only 16 years later in 1938, the school made a major breakthrough with its own premises situated at Jalan Bendahara (approximately the vacant space of the current Parliament)\n\nIn 1940, Kapitan China Ong Boon Pang passed away peacefully after chairing the school board for 22 years and his great contribution in laying a solid foundation for the school is still remember and much appreciated.\n\nIn 1954, Lim Teck Hoo was elected as the new School Board.\n\nIn 1955, the school commenced its secondary level and changed its name to Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB.\n\nIn 1957, the government of Brunei subsidised the school and paid for the teachers’ salary, administration cost and the construction cost of the basic school facilities. Moreover, free lunch, and later changed into free beverage, was provided to fellow students from 1959 to 1969.\n\nIn 1959, a comprehensive learning curriculum was successfully implemented at the school with its upper secondary level introduced in 1959. The total student population surged, surpassing the 1000 benchmark.\n\nIn 1962, one two-storey building was completed with the financing from both government and donation from the community. In 1962, the school launched its kindergarten level.\n\nIn 1968, a stadium was in completion.\n\nIn 1970, the government withdrawing its financial support to the school fomented financial constraints in the Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB. The crisis was solved after the Tiong Hwa Community volunteered to support the school in a form of monthly donation and the kind benefaction provided by the philanthropic Kapitan China Awang Lim Teck Hoo and other board members.\n\nIn 1971, the medium of instruction was changed to English for Upper Secondary Science Streams.\n\nIn 1972, the school was honoured when Al-Marhum Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien Sa’adul Khairi Waddin consented to officiate the 50th school anniversary. At the same time, a four-storey building was completed to cater for the needs of its secondary students.\n\nIn 1974, in line with the national policy, Friday was declared a weekend holiday. The school syllabus was adapted to echo the national syllabus where English and Bahasa Melayu were taught to primary students.\n\nIn 1975, the school embraced teachers assigned by the government to teach Bahasa Melayu for primary level and their salary was shouldered by the government.\n\nIn 1976, Chung Hwa students, instead of sitting for the internal exams set by the school, opt for GCE O’ Level.\n\nIn 1978, the school marked a glorious history and established its name when its students scored the public exams such as the PCE and BJCE with flying colours.\n\nIn 1982, a three-storey building was built to cater for the needs of kindergarten pupil. In May 1982, the school hall was upgraded and its named was officially changed to Darussalam Hall. The school marked a new milestone when Duli Yang Teramat Mulia Paduka Seri Pengiran Perdana Wazir graced the grand celebration of the school 60th anniversary. In November, the gala night, organised by the school alumni, successfully collected $241,937.80 with the establishment of the alumni education fund.\n\nIn 1983, the rules of the school board were amended and for the following year, election of the school boards abided by such amended rules. The new school canteen was open in 1986 and one year later, sixth form was launched at the school with a total of 11 students.\n\nIn 1988, the school made history as the first school whose management and learning was aided by computer.\n\nAt the same year, computer was integrated as part of the extracurricular activities.The new meeting room and the school library were completed and one air-conditioned school bus was used. In December that year, seven students graduated from the sixth form. The new entry policy, where a credit in GCE O’ Level Bahasa Melayu was a prerequisite to study in Sixth Form, jeopardised the source of students and forced the school to cease its sixth form education later.\n\nIn 1990, one hostel for teachers and students was constructed.\n\nIn 1992, the 70th anniversary celebration of the school was officiated by the Minister of Education, Yang Berhormat Orang Kaya Laila Wijaya Dato Pehin Haji Abdul Aziz Umar.
