        "text": "Conducted by the Centre for Social Policy Studies at the Department of Applied Social Sciences of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, with assistance of Unison Hong Kong at the first stage, this research seeks to explore the difficulties faced by the ethnic minority youngsters concerning their education in Hong Kong. Through this, we see that race and ethnicity are key dimensions of social stratification and inequality in contemporary Hong Kong society. We also hope that this research can well serve as a case to illustrate the relationship between race/ethnicity and educational opportunities as well as attainment in Hong Kong. In this research, our target groups are Filipino, Indian, Nepalese and Pakistani students who are studying in Form 4, Form 5, Form 6 and Form 7. This research consists of a questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews. The questionnaire survey was conducted between May and July 2004. We have completed 200 questionnaires with the help of ethnic minority students. The questionnaire covered five broad areas: education/school life, cultural aspects, aspirations and parental expectations, linguistic needs and interest in Chinese and mother-tongue, and lastly, their sense of belonging to Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the in-depth interviews aim to further explore the complex dynamic of educational experiences that could not be described by quantitative data in the survey, as well as to develop recommendations for improving social policies in relation to their educational situation. Twenty in-depth interviews with individual students were conducted from December 2004 to April 2005. On education and school life, more than half of the students think they do not have the same educational opportunities as local Chinese students in Hong Kong due to limited school choices while the chances for further education beyond senior secondary education are restricted. With respect to their teachers in school, one-quarter of the students disagree that their teachers treat students of different ethnicity or race equally. More than one quarter also feel some of their teachers may punish ethnic minority students more severely than Chinese students, care about Chinese students more than non-Chinese students, and dislike teaching ethnic minority students. Through elaboration, it is discovered that some teachers have stereotypes of ethnic minority students as being useless, misbehaving and impolite. At other times, ethnic minority students feel some teachers tend to pay more attention to Chinese students than to ethnic minority students. Concerning Chinese schoolmates, nearly half of the ethnic minority students reported they seldom have communication with their Chinese schoolmates. Moreover, one-fifth of them point out that Chinese schoolmates dislike them because of their race or ethnic origin. At discussions, students mentioned language problems and cultural differences as major barriers in communicating with their Chinese schoolmates. Majority of the students do not seem to have encounters with the school social workers, as ethnic minority students say they would not turn to a school social worker if they have problems. Regarding the general learning atmosphere in school, among 200 respondents, nearly one-third think drug abuse among students is a problem in their school and nearly half of the respondents consider bullying among student to be a problem in their schools. Some students have complained that the learning atmosphere in classroom is noisy and they cannot focus on their studies. For some students who are migrants, they have difficulties adjusting to the local school curriculum as the syllabuses of certain subjects in Hong Kong are different from those in their home country. On cultural aspects, more than half of the students reported their schools respect their cultural and religious values and practices as they are allowed to wear scarves and salwar, grow beard and put on signs of religion. However, probing into the issue at discussions, it is discovered that certain practices may not be allowed by individual schools or in other instances the environment of the school does not foster the practicing of their religion, with some Muslim students mentioning that they were denied a room for the special purpose of prayers. In certain schools, students said growing beard is forbidden. Religious values and practices are more easily accepted by schools than those that were cultural in nature. Other than this, Muslim and vegetarian students find it hard to meet their special dietary needs in school, or outside school. In school canteens, they can hardly find food suitable for consumption. In other instances, lunch boxes ordered by schools for students mostly contain meat, thus they cannot order them. On aspirations and parental expectations, we found majority of students disagree they have no reason to work hard in school, and slightly more than half believe they will complete college or university level. Moreover, three-quarter are optimistic about their future as they are confident they will have good career prospects upon completion of studies. However, despite such optimism in statistical data, at discussions we found that students have some worries about their future. They foresee some difficulties in achieving their ambitions, particularly in reference to achieving them in local society. For most of them, difficulties are mainly due to their incapability in Chinese language as they cannot speak the language while for those who can speak, they cannot read and write Chinese. On linguistic needs and interest in Chinese and mother-tongue, more than three-quarter students have expressed interest in learning Chinese language in school. Reasons for wanting to learn Chinese include the usefulness of the language for further study and future employment in Hong Kong, as well as its helpfulness in communicating with Chinese people and in everyday life. Among those who do not want to learn Chinese, majority of them reported it is too difficult a language to learn. Other reasons include Chinese not being an international language, not being practical as they are not going to stay in Hong Kong for good, not having enough Chinese lessons in school, and not having anyone outside school to help them with Chinese schoolwork. With respect to their mother-tongue, nearly half of them want to learn their mother-tongues in school. One possible reason as to why some students dislike learning mother-tongue in school is that they are already fluent in their mother-tongues. Some consider having the speaking and listening skills in mother-tongue as more than enough. For those who have spent a number of years in their home countries, and for the Nepalese in particular, they are already fluent in both written and oral skills of Nepali, and thus expressed in our research that they find it unnecessary to learn it in school now. On sense of belonging to Hong Kong, majority of the respondents identify themselves both by their ethnic origin and as a Hong Kong person, and almost half of them expressed that they like Hong Kong very much. A majority of our respondents have experienced racial discrimination in Hong Kong. Therefore, while discussing their attitudes towards Hong Kong people in general, the ethnic minority youngsters have ambivalent feelings about them. In statistical data, nearly half of them express they do not find Hong Kong people to be kind and helpful, whereas a higher proportion of them report that Hong Kong people are not caring and do not treat people of different races and nationalities equally. Generally speaking, almost ninety percent of them agree that most of their friends are non-Chinese people and only forty-two percent report having close Chinese friends. Lastly, they tend to have strong ethnic pride as more than ninety percent agree they are proud of their own ethnic origin. In addition, nearly eighty percent of them report having special qualities or abilities that local Chinese students do not have. Based on the educational situation reflected in the questionnaire survey and the opinions expressed in the in-depth interviews, we recommend policy changes and improvements in the following areas: educational opportunities, role of teachers and social workers, curriculum, cultural aspects as well as Chinese language and mother-tongue. To improve the educational situation of ethnic minorities, we believe that improvements in these aspects are essential to helping ethnic minority students progress in their academic performance and attainment in Hong Kong society."
