        "text": "This article is a re-examination of Chinese student activism in Singapore through the lens of cultural performance, which has yet to garner due attention. Tracing the ebb and flow of Chinese school concerts in the politically volatile atmosphere of Cold War era Singapore and Malaya complicates current understanding about student activism in the city state. Whereas the official narratives by the British colonial administration and later, the PAP, often cast Chinese student activism as part of a communist insurgency, this article argues that school concerts—comprising folk dances, songs, choirs and theatre—were an alternative space for Chinese youth to articulate their visions of building an independent socialist state and an integrated multiracial Malayan nation. Unlike the student activism expressed through mass strikes, these school concerts enable one to see how the Chinese students displayed sophisticated ways of discipline, organisation skills, and creative energy through the performing arts in 1950s and 1960s Singapore.\n\n1 Another significant component in Britain's decolonisation plan was the Malayan Union (MU) scheme. On 1 Apr. 1946, the British inaugurated the MU, comprising all the Malay States and the Straits Settlements of Penang and Malacca (excluding Singapore). Under the MU, all races were offered equal citizenship. However, feeling that their position was greatly undermined, the Malays fiercely protested against the MU, which was abandoned in favour of a pro-Malay Federation from 1 Feb. 1948.\n\n6 In the May Thirteenth Incident, about 1,150 Chinese middle school students lined up for a peaceful march to present a petition for exemption from conscription. However, a police squad was sent to forcibly disperse the assembly, which increased the Chinese community's resentment against the British.\n\n9 This binary characterisation was first put forward by Yeo Kim Wah in his seminal work, Political development in Singapore, 1945–1955 (Singapore: Singapore University Press, 1973). However, Yeo later revised this in the 1990s when he started to examine student activism among the English educated. See for example, Wah, Yeo Kim, ‘Student politics in University of Malaya, 1949–51’, Journal of Southeast Asian Studies 23, 2 (1992): 346–80CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n18 Michael Szonyi and Hong Liu, ‘Introduction: New approaches to the study of Cold War in Asia’, in The Cold War in Asia: The battle for hearts and minds, ed. Zheng Yangwen, Hong Liu and Michael Szonyi (Leiden: Brill, 2010), p. 11; Jennifer Lindsay, ‘Festival politics: Singapore's 1963 South-East Asia Cultural Festival’, in Cultures at war: The Cold War and cultural expression in Southeast Asia, ed. Tony Day and Maya H.T. Liem (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2010), p. 228.\n\n22 Ien Ang, On not speaking Chinese: Living between Asia and the West (London: Routledge, 2011); Shu-Mei Shih, ‘Against diaspora: The Sinophone as places of cultural production’, in Global Chinese literature: Critical essays, ed. David Dewei Wang and Jing Tsu (Leiden: Brill, 2010), pp. 29–48; Rey Chow, ‘Introduction: On Chineseness as a theoretical problem’, in ‘Modern Chinese literary and cultural studies in the age of theory: Reimagining a field’, special issue, boundary 2, 25, 3 (1998): 1–24.\n\n23 In the early to mid-20th century, Chinese migration to Singapore and Malaya grew substantially. As people and families came and settled down for longer periods, there was an increasing need to have Chinese schools where people could send their children to receive education in the same way as they did in the homeland.\n\n42 SCMSSU, also known as Zhongxuelian, was a student organisation that brought all Chinese middle school students together. It was a direct response to the May Thirteenth Incident to fight for the welfare of Chinese school students and protect Chinese education.\n\n51 The Anti-Yellow Culture Movement is well researched in Lau Yu Ching, ‘The Anti-Yellow Cultural Movement, 1953–1961: Morality and the language of decolonizing Singapore’ (MA thesis, History Dept., National University of Singapore, 2016). Cheng Tju Lim also pays important attention to the Movement. Cheng Tju Lim, ‘The Anti-Yellow Culture Campaign in Singapore: 1953–1979’, in The state and the arts in Singapore: Policies and institutions, ed. Terence Chong (New Jersey: World Scientific, 2018), pp. 31–48.\n\n67 There is a burgeoning scholarship on the role of Hong Kong in the Cold War. See Shuang Shen, ‘Empire of information: The Asia Foundation's network and Chinese-language cultural production in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia’, American Quarterly 69, 3 (2017): 589–610; Florence Mok, ‘Disseminating and containing communist propaganda to overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia through Hong Kong, the Cold War pivot, 1949–1960’, Historical Journal (2021): 1–21; Poshek Fu and Man-Fung Yip, eds, The Cold War and Asian cinemas (New York: Routledge, 2020).\n\n70 Zhang, Chinese theatre troupes in Southeast Asia, pp. 124–43.
