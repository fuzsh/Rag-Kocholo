        "text": "Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB Holds the Inaugural Drama Festival for Private Schools\n\nMore than 100 students from 7 private schools in Brunei were competing in the inaugural Drama Festival for Private Schools organised by Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB on 7th and 8th July 2010.\n\nThe participating schools, including St. George’s School, St. Angela’s School, St. Adrew’s School, St. Margaret’s School, Seri Mulia Sarjana School , Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB and Chung Ching Middle School, Seria, went all out to showcase their stage talents and prowess in drama to aim for the coveted champion trophy of the said festival.\n\nThe principal Mdm. Kho Guik Lan in her welcome speech expressed her hope that the drama festival would enable participants to process and use the English language in context, helping them acquire the key skills stated in the new educational system SPN 21. “A drama will enable students to explore and experience the many facts of the performing arts. The preparation, staging, interaction with the cast and other participants from other schools create great excitement and meaningful experience which can deepen their passion for drama,” she concluded.\n\nThe head of English department Mdm. Gemanar Cristina highlighted that organising a drama festival in Brunei was a dream come true. “Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB strongly believes in the importance of developing the students’ critical, analytical and social skills and continuously looks into ways of using English Language creatively and an event like this will give the participants and the students in the audience a career path to think about, that will bring great satisfaction to those who decide to pursue it,” she elaborated.\n\n.\n\nMotivational talk for O’ Level Candidates\n\nFamed lecturer Dr. Ee Ah Meng gave a motivational talk on 25 September 2010 at the lecture hall to tell students his formula for success: determination, discipline and hard work.\n\nOver the course of two hours, Dr. Ee cast lights on how to prepare for public examinations such as O’ Level and PSR. He transformed over 200 students, especially the disadvantaged students from the school and turned them into industrial and aim-orientated candidates through his interesting lectures.\n\nDr. Ee successfully created an atmosphere conducive for learning by using motivational video clips, songs and interactive games. He explained the correlations between future successes to current academic results. “The gist is easy- aim high and you will realize your goal,” he suggested. Through a video clip about the success of a physically-impaired teenager, Nick Vujicic, Dr. Ee talked about ways to transform shortcoming into strength towards excellence.\n\nStudents were enthralled by the educator’s talk. They also learned different tips to make learning easy such as mind maps and found them very inspirational. “After watching the movie, I am definitely ready to face my exams with confidence. Besides, the talk was very powerful – you could practically feel the excitement and enthusiasm flowing in the room,” answered one of the participants.\n\nFriday, 17th September 2010\n\nThe kindergarten staff of CHMS, B.S.B recently had a in-house training on Montessori Philosophy and Pedagogy with the objective of learning phonetics to prepare children with beginning reading skills. It was conducted by the Head of English Department, Mdm Gladys and Mdm Veronica Sia, a Montessori – trained teacher from the Primary Section of the school. The staff were also briefed on the good virtues of a teacher and give an insight of the first three stages of the development of a child. A slideshow “ Make A Difference” was also shown and it had been an inspiring and encouraging one which left a great impact on the staff overall.\n\nThe children and staff of CHMS Kindergarten, B.S.B were entertained by a short role – play in the conjunction with the Mid – Autumn Festival. Five teachers and 10 students performed in the legendary tale leading to the traditional celebration of the “Mooncake Festival ” on the 15th day of the eight month of the Chinese lunar calendar. The children were also shown the moon cakes and the pamelo fruit which were customary during this festival. They were delighted too when they were taken around to view the beautiful lanterns made by them and the rest of the students which were displayed at the ground floor of the kindergarten.\n\nECA (Extra Curricular Activities) Galore in Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB\n\nChung Hwa Middle School, BSB recently held its ECA enrollment in Boon Pang Hall on 15 January 2011 and saw its students enthusiastically enrolled for their favourite Extra Curricular Activities.\n\nStarted from 11.00 am to 12.30pm, all Year 7 to Year 10 students attended the said function in gaiety. The expectant students later visited different booths in which the teachers-in-charge briefed their potential members using slides, pictures or other captivating illustrations.\n\nThe principal Mdm. Kho Guik Lan stressed that ECA is an important part of education. “Used to mould the future leaders of our nation, ECA can widen the horizon of our students, instilling in them the importance of well-roundedness. Considering that it is compulsory under the new SPN21 for all students to engage themselves in at least one activity, Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB is gearing up for the commencement of all the extra-curricular activities next week,” she continued.\n\nMdm Kho also explained that students were free to choose any activities that suit their interest. “Chung Hwa has a myriad of educational and entertaining ECAs aimed to help students delve into a wide spectrum of knowledge. This year, some of the academic ECAs include trilingual club, Maths & Commerce club, Photography Club and Science &Social Studies Society. The school also has badminton, ping pong, football and other sports club to cater for our potential athletes. On the other hand, primary students are also spoiled with choices in their ECAs, namely drama, arts, computer, choir, music, dancing and martial arts,” she concluded.\n\nChung Hwa Middle School, BSB ushers in the Year of Rabbit in Style\n\nTo mark the auspicious Chinese New Year 2011, the Chinese Department of Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB organized a Chinese Calligraphy Competition where its winners received their awards in the grand Chinese New Year Celebration held in Darussalam Hall on 24th January 2011.\n\nThe vice chairperson of the School Board of Directors Mr. Lim Ming Kiat graced the event as the guest of honour. In his opening speech, he congratulated the school for its successful 88th School Anniversary Gala Dinner last year. “We have also revamped the secondary block, equipping all the classrooms with air-conditioners and contemporary teaching aids, namely computer and projector to create a learning environment conducive for learning. Apart from academic achievements, the school is also gearing up to promote Chinese heritage that offers rich, time-honoured traditions and a Chinese Calligraphy Competition can best exemplify such effort,” he concluded.\n\nThe principal, in her speech, also underpinned the Chinese Department’s effort to cultivate a love for Chinese calligraphy among students. “Over the millennia, the benefits of personality tempering and intellectual expression afforded by the art of Chinese calligraphy have been attested as this form of arts can bring physical and spiritual benefits to the practitioner, notably in instilling discipline, patience, and persistence. It is for these reasons that Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB has placed immense importance on Chinese calligraphy,” she explained.\n\nAfter the award presentation ceremony, a myriad of entertaining cultural shows such as traditional dance and songs added lustre to the event. The programme culminated in an educational quiz about Chinese New Year and was perfectly concluded at 11.45am.\n\nChung Hwa BSB Student Becomes the First Recipient in Brunei to Receive a Bond-free Scholarship from Hwa Chong International School, Singapore\n\nTop scorer Tiong Yee Eng was all smiles when she won the scholarship from the prestigious Hwa Chong International School, Singapore (HCIS), allowing her to pursue a two-year International Baccalaureate Diploma in the republic.
