Chinese is distinct in that it is a tonal language. But the allomorphic feature of tones is not usually marked in alphabetic Romanization of Chinese (called pinyin). Since the user of this guide will likely encounter such unmarked Romanization, we will dismiss tones in transcribing the sounds in pinyin.\n\nThe following begins with a simple introduction to Chinese names and the pronunciation system. It then provides clickable audio files for sounds that are more distant from those of English.\n\nFinally, this guide will provide Romanization and audio files for 1) common Chinese surnames and 2) the names of faculty members and some graduate students of the Chinese program at SILC as examples since there are no common given names in Chinese."
