        "text": "1911 Chung Hwa Girlsâ School was opened on 15 September 1911 through the concerted efforts of Mr Tay Peng Teng, Mr Puan Yeow Pang and members of the Chinese community.\n\nThe establishment of Chung Hwa Girlsâ School was a timely development that took place during an era when the roles and contributions of women in society were being seen in a new light. In heeding Dr Sun Yat Senâs call for the provision of education for girls in Singapore, these leaders of the Chinese community helped to mark a turning point for women in the Chinese community in Singapore.\n\nChung Hwa had started out with the modest aim of providing basic primary education for Chinese girls. However, as it evolved and grew in strength and stature, its role expanded to include teacher-training. Eventually, Chung Hwa embraced the mantle of secondary and pre-university education for all. 1925 The original location of Chung Hwa Girlsâ School was at Mohamad Sultan Road. It had slightly over ten students at its inception but later to meet the need for larger premises, the school moved to Tank Road.\n\nWith the combined efforts of the school and the Board of Directors in fundraising and in its search for a bigger building, the primary school section was shifted to No. 57, Niven Road. With greater interest and support from the community, enrolment grew to more than a hundred in subsequent years. 1930s\n\nto\n\n1940s Chung Hwa Girlsâ School started teacher training courses in the mid-1930s to create a local pool of teachers to meet growing needs. In 1935, Chung Hwa introduced a simplified Normal Training Course, and these cadets graduated in 1941.\n\nIn 1942, Classes were suspended with the outbreak of World War II and the Japanese Occupation of Singapore.\n\nIn 1947, Chung Hwa resumed classes with the reintroduction of two teacher training courses. Teacher cadets also graduated from the first post-war batch of the Normal Training Course.\n\nMany of the graduates stayed on at Chung Hwa or returned to Chung Hwa to teach â a strong testimony of the loyalty and commitment that the school inspired in those who had tread the Chung Hwa path. 1950 In 1950, teacher cadets from the second post-war batch undertaking the simplified Normal Training Course graduated.\n\nThe school attempted to sustain its teacher-training classes but these were eventually terminated between 1950 and 1951 when the government set up the Teachersâ Training College. 1951 Completed in 1951, the building at Bartley Road, known as the main school, housed the secondary school section named Chung Hwa Girlsâ High School. The primary school, known as the sub-school, remained at Niven Road. 1954\n\nto\n\n1958 In 1954, the school became known as Chung Hwa Girlsâ Middle School. In place of the training courses, middle school classes were introduced. In 1958, this system was replaced by the four-year secondary school system that remains at the core of secondary education today. In the drive towards nation-building during the post-war era, the quest for higher education was keenly felt. To meet this need, high school classes were introduced in 1954, which was later replaced by the two-year Pre-University system in 1962. 1957 The school became a government-aided school. Â Â 1967 Chung Hwa Girlsâ High celebrated her 56th Anniversary in 1967. The Guest of Honour was the then Minister for Education, Mr Ong Pang Boon. 1968 Chung Hwa participated in the National Day Parade in 1968. The studentsâ outstanding display was commended by then Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew as Chung Hwa students demonstrated their commitment, perseverance and team spirit by continuing to perform despite the heavy downpour during the National Day Parade. 1969 In 1969, Mr Ong Pang Boon, then Education Minister, graced the opening of an additional block for the school at the Bartley Road campus.\n\nIn a landmark move for curricular development, Chung Hwa became the first girlsâ school to introduce technical and home economics education in 1969. 1970s Towards the late 1970s, the school began to show formidable strength in basketball. It won six championships in one year, twenty-one championships during the period from 1978 to 1985, and produced three national players.\n\nThe school also experienced numerous victories in gymnastics championships. 1980 To keep up with times, predominance of English as the language of business and international communication, Chung Hwa introduced English-medium classes. The Chinese-medium classes were eventually phased out in 1987. 1984 Chung Hwa became a full-fledged government and co-educational school and took in male students for the first time in the secondary schoolâs history.\n\nThe school was then renamed Chung Hwa High School. 1987 The school relocated to its new site at Serangoon Avenue 4 in Serangoon New Town with a larger catchment population and a higher potential to be of service to the community. After the move in 1987, the hanyupinyin name of Zhonghua Secondary School was adopted and the logo was modified to reflect the change. 1996 Within a decade of its move to Serangoon Avenue 4, Zhonghua established itself within the neighbourhood as a secondary school of firm standing, where education is a mission and a passion.\n\nIn 1996, the schoolâs track record in continuous improvement in academic results resulted in Zhonghua being awarded autonomous status. With greater autonomy and more funds, the school began offering a wider range of programmes to enrich its pupils and stretch their potential. Â Â"
