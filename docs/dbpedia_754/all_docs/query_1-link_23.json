        "text": "Introduction\n\nPerceptions of China, a country in East Asia, must be adjusted to its enormous scale. Its culture and its civilization go back thousands of years. Its vast area is the third largest in the world, after Russia and Canada. China is also one of the most populous countries in the world. It is rivaled only by India, which, according to United Nations estimates, exceeded it in population in 2023. Area 3,696,097 square miles (9,572,900 square kilometers). Population (2024 est.) 1,410,474,000.\n\nThe Himalayas along China’s southwestern frontier with India are the world’s tallest mountains. China’s greatest river, the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang), is the world’s third longest. The Takla Makan Desert, in western Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang, is one of the driest spots on Earth. Other parts of China have tropical climates, subarctic climates, and many types in between. There are dozens of urban areas with populations of more than a million, with some much larger, including Beijing, the capital, and Shanghai, China’s largest city.\n\nChina has a great wealth of mineral and natural resources. Reserves of coal, iron ore, tungsten, tin, bauxite, copper, limestone, and many other minerals needed in modern industry are abundant. These resources helped provide China with a solid foundation for rapid industrial growth.\n\nAnother significant aspect of China is its long cultural and national history. The Chinese people have shared a common written culture longer than any other group on Earth. The Chinese writing system dates back almost 4,000 years. The imperial dynastic system of government, which continued for centuries, was established as early as 221 bc. Although specific dynasties were overturned, the dynastic system survived. China was even ruled at times by foreign invaders, such as the Mongols during the Yuan Dynasty, from the 13th to 14th century, and the Manchu during the Qing Dynasty, from the 17th to early 20th century, but the foreigners were largely absorbed into the culture they governed. It is as if the Roman Empire had lasted from the time of the Caesars to the 20th century and had during that time evolved a cultural system and written language shared by all the peoples of Europe.\n\nThe dynastic system was overturned in 1911/12, and a weak, nominally republican form of government existed until 1949. In that year, after a long civil war, the People’s Republic of China, with a communist government, was proclaimed. This government, through the ruling Chinese Communist party, has controlled China ever since. Although the dynastic system disappeared, the People’s Republic occupies largely the same territory and governs the same people as the last dynasty—the now-independent country of Mongolia being a notable exception. If anything, the culture and power of China seem stronger in the early 21st century than at almost any other period in history. Under the People’s Republic, China’s role in world economic and political affairs has grown increasingly more important.\n\nSize alone makes China an important member of the world community, a fact that the United Nations has recognized. China has had a permanent seat on the UN Security Council since that organization was founded. For a number of years, this seat was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist government, which had fled to the island of Taiwan when the communists came to power.\n\nIn 1971, however, the UN General Assembly voted to turn this seat over to the representatives of the People’s Republic. Most countries recognize the People’s Republic as the legitimate government of China, though Taiwan retains the formal name of the Republic of China. The governments of both the People’s Republic and Taiwan consider Taiwan to be a province of China.\n\nAfter 1971, the People’s Republic of China joined a number of UN and other international organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund. An example of China’s growing involvement with the world community in that period was the rapid increase in its foreign trade. Between 1959 and 1982 China’s total trade turnover with noncommunist countries rose from 1.3 billion dollars to about 32 billion dollars. This represented a significant shift in policy. It indicates that the Chinese had come to believe that the key to economic growth and modernization—including access to new industrial and scientific technologies—lay in closer economic and political relationships with developed countries such as Japan, the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\n\nBy the early 1980s, after several decades of civil war, conflicts with foreign powers, and domestic upheavals, China seemed to have stabilized. Disputes with neighbors and foreign powers remained, but they were muted. The emphasis had switched to the practical problems of improving the economy, the educational system, and the level of scientific and technical achievement.\n\nIn the late 20th century the country adopted a series of wide-reaching economic reforms that transformed Chinese society. It began a period of economic liberalization, in which elements of a free-market system, including private ownership of many industries, were introduced and foreign investment was allowed. Both foreign trade and the gross domestic product experienced dramatic growth, and by the 21st century it had one of the world’s largest economies. Although China is still not a rich country in per capita terms, the well-being of the Chinese people as a whole has improved rapidly, though income gaps have also grown. Moreover, China’s sheer numbers (about a fifth of the world’s population) and the size of the overall economy make it an important force among the world family of nations.\n\nLand and Climate\n\nLike the United States, China is located in the midlatitudes. On the east and south, China faces the Pacific Ocean. Consequently, eastern China—especially the southeastern coast—is humid and has generally mild winters compared to the rest of the country. High mountains close off the west, however, and much of the northwestern half of the country is relatively dry and isolated. Traditionally, China’s western regions have been sparsely populated, largely by minority peoples such as Tibetans, Uighurs (Uygurs), and Mongols.\n\nWith a vast land boundary as well as a long coastline, China shares borders with 14 countries: North Korea and Russia on the northeast; Mongolia on the north; Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan on the west; and India, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar (Burma), Laos, and Vietnam on the south. It also faces South Korea and Japan across the Yellow Sea and the Philippines across the South China Sea.\n\nSurface Features\n\nChina’s land surface is rugged and uneven. Almost one third of the total area consists of mountains and hills. Traveling westward from the coast in central China means going steadily upward across a series of hills and ridges, plateaus, and elevated basins. This climb ends at the Plateau of Tibet with the towering Himalayas on its southern flank. This high, vast plateau has an average elevation of more than 13,000 feet (4,000 meters) and accounts for about a quarter of China’s area. The Plateau of Tibet includes the administrative region known as Tibet but also stretches well beyond it, through much of Qinghai Province and into western Sichuan Province and southern Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang.\n\nThe major mountains, plateaus, and basins of the west generally follow an east-west axis. They are, from south to north, the Himalayas, the Plateau of Tibet, the Kunlun Mountains, the Tarim Basin, the Tien Shan (Celestial Mountains), the Junggar Basin, and the Altai Mountains. The main structural orientation of the mountains in the east—the Da Hinggan Range (Da Xing’an Ling) and the Taihang Mountains—is northeast-southwest. Where these mountains cross, they form what has been likened to a gigantic checkerboard. In the southeast, however, the low, rugged mountains and hills form a more complex pattern. The lowlands of the east also include many plains, notably the Northeast Plain, the North China Plain, and the plains along the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang).\n\nIn the southwest the ridges are folded into extremely rugged, high uplands separating the major drainage systems of several great rivers. Extensive areas in southern China are underlaid with limestone. This karst, or limestone, region has been weathered into some unusual and striking landscapes that feature a variety of steep domes and towers. These landscapes have served as a popular theme for the traditional school of Chinese landscape painting.\n\nMajor Rivers\n\nMost of China’s tens of thousands of rivers flow generally eastward, to the Pacific Ocean. This is true of the country’s two longest rivers, the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) and the Huang He (Yellow River), which rise on the eastern edge of the Plateau of Tibet. The Huang He eventually empties into the Bo Hai (Gulf of Chihli), while the Yangtze empties into the East China Sea. Several other large rivers that rise in the Plateau of Tibet, such as the Mekong, Salween, and Brahmaputra, flow into Southeast Asia or India. Another important river, the Amur, forms part of the boundary between China and Russia in the northeast. China’s major southern river is the Xi (West) River. The Xi, together with the Pearl (Zhu) River and other rivers, forms the important large southern delta plain in which the southern city of Guangzhou (Canton) is located.\n\nNatural Resources\n\nChina has a large and varied stock of natural resources, including many minerals. The country has about 12 percent of the world’s mineral resources, with only the United States and Russia possessing larger proportions. There are sizeable reserves of coal, iron, tin, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, tungsten, mercury, graphite, antimony, magnesite, fluorspar, and other minerals.\n\nThe country’s rich mineral supply is a product of its complex geology. In ancient geologic times much of what is now China was under the sea. Movements of Earth’s crust against three huge, stable masses of ancient Precambrian rock (in southeastern China, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia) gave rise to China’s characteristic parallel ridges and plains. In the lowlands and basins, which were repeatedly submerged during the Paleozoic era hundreds of millions of years ago, great quantities of carbon-containing material were deposited. These became the carbon-based fossil fuels that exist in China today—coal, which is abundant, and petroleum and natural gas, which are present to a smaller degree. Deposits of other minerals accumulated as a result of geologic processes, including vulcanism associated with the crustal movements.\n\nThe variety of different landforms, soil conditions, and climate patterns offers many different kinds of opportunities for agricultural production. A tremendous range of crops can be grown, and this made it possible for China to keep imports to a minimum during its Maoist period of self-reliance. China has only a modest supply of arable land (about 10 percent of the total land area). Where precipitation is sufficient for growing crops, however, Chinese farmers have satisfactory to good soils to work with or they have improved existing soils by adding nutrients. (See also “Mining and Energy” and “Crops and Livestock” below.)\n\nDifficult Environments\n\nOne of the most unusual and challenging regional environments in China is found on the Loess Plateau, a highland plateau west of the North China Plain. There the special type of fine, siltlike soil known as loess covers tens of thousands of square miles. The Loess Plateau has the most extensive area of loessic soil in the world. The loess is blown by the wind from the adjacent Ordos (Mu Us) and Gobi deserts, as well as from territories beyond China’s borders, and has accumulated over thousands of years. In many places the loess forms a thick mantle that completely covers the original landforms. When the forest or prairie vegetation on the loess is disturbed, the soil in the upland regions is easily eroded and formed into gullies during heavy summer rainstorms.\n\nThe region around the confluence of the Wei River and the Huang He is often called the cradle of Chinese civilization. It is thought that Neolithic people in that region began to develop the culture that evolved into the Chinese civilization. When these people began to farm, they disturbed the original vegetation. Ultimately, this increased the rate of erosion and led to severe environmental problems. In addition to scarring the surface landscape with gullies and badlands, the runoff found its way into the Huang He, adding to the silt burden of that river. The Huang He’s high content of yellow-brown silt gives it its name, which means “Yellow River.” The silt load causes sediment to be deposited in the river channel at a high rate and has resulted in a tendency to flood farther east on the North China Plain. The chronic and severe flooding of the Huang He, sometimes accompanied by major changes in the location of the channel, led the Chinese to call it “China’s sorrow.” Tremendous efforts and vast amounts of human labor have been used in building levees, channels, and dams to control it.\n\nParts of the southwest, with their extensive limestone deposits, irregular karst towers, and subsurface drainage networks, present a different set of difficulties. There the problems are to find areas of level land large enough to cultivate and to keep water on the surface so it can be used for irrigation.\n\nOther environments within China pose their own challenges. Farming is difficult in many parts of the country, and large investments have been needed to improve the land and control water for irrigation. Transportation networks are difficult and expensive to plan and build in many areas, where inaccessibility and geographic isolation have seriously impeded development for centuries.\n\nThe movements of Earth’s crust that created China’s mountain ranges and high plateaus continue today, making much of the country prone to earthquakes. Over its long history, it has been struck by hundreds of powerful, deadly quakes. In recent times, particularly devastating earthquakes occurred in eastern Gansu Province in 1920, in eastern Hebei Province in 1976, and in east-central Sichuan Province in 2008.\n\nClimate\n\nIn terms of climate, China may be divided roughly into the dry west and the humid east. Actually, the line dividing these regions would be diagonal, with the driest part of the country being in the northwest and the most humid in the southeast. The humid east may be further subdivided into the warm and humid south and southeast and the temperate-to-cool, moderately humid north and northeast. Much of the humid eastern region of China exhibits a monsoonal pattern of temperature and precipitation. In a monsoon climate, the warm summer months are typically the months of maximum precipitation.\n\nPrecipitation\n\nOnly the south and southeast have sufficient rainfall to support intensive farming. Just 20 to 26 inches (500 to 650 millimeters) of precipitation are common throughout much of the north and northeast. This is not enough to grow rice or to raise more than one crop per year. Consequently, much of northern and northeastern China must rely on irrigation water. In the early 2000s China began building massive water transfer schemes to bring water from southern China to northern China.\n\nWestern China gets very little rainfall. Most of this region consists of mountains or enclosed desert basins. In extreme western Xinjiang at Kashgar (Kashi) in the Tarim Basin, rainfall averages only 4 inches (100 millimeters) per year. About the same amount falls farther northeast, at Ürümqi in the Junggar Basin, while near Lhasa, high on the Plateau of Tibet, the average is about 11 inches (280 millimeters). These dry conditions permit little farming, even where drought-resistant crops such as gaoliang (a variety of sorghum) and some of the millets are grown. Irrigation is essential, and most of the settlements in western China developed initially around oases where there were dependable sources of water. In Tibet less water is needed because of the lower average temperature, but irrigation is becoming increasingly important as a means of making agricultural output more reliable.\n\nAn important feature of China’s climate is the annual occurrence, usually in the summer or autumn, of great storms called typhoons that sweep in from the western Pacific. These typhoons are tropical cyclones (which are called hurricanes when they occur in the Atlantic). They are accompanied by high winds and tremendous quantities of rain, usually concentrated within a few hours. The storm paths most commonly focus on the southeastern coast, though sometimes they sweep northward toward Japan. Great damage may be done by the flooding caused by typhoons, especially in low-lying coastal floodplains and basins.\n\nTemperature\n\nIn general, temperature patterns in China are determined by north-south location, though there are some exceptions. South of the Qin Mountains (Qin Ling), average annual temperatures are high and winters are generally mild. For example, the middle and lower Yangtze Basin in southeastern China has mild winters and extremely hot summers, and the average temperature increases only gradually as one moves south into the tropical coastal areas. The average annual temperature drops rapidly north of the Qin Mountains. In much of this area there is a continental climate. This is reflected in the cold winters that occur in such cities as Beijing, Xi’an, and Harbin.\n\nThe length of the growing season for plants, defined as the period during which daily mean temperatures are above 43° F (6° C), varies in line with the temperature patterns. Thus, most of the area south of the Yangtze has a growing season of at least 300 days, mild enough to grow two crops a year. Along the southern and southeastern coast the growing season lasts all year round. Light frosts may occur, but they are not severe enough to kill most plants. North of the Yangtze Basin average temperatures drop sharply, and the growing season shortens rapidly as distance north increases. In the northern interior the growing season is less than 180 days.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nChina has a very large population, which has grown rapidly in recent times. Between the 1964 and 1982 censuses China added more than 313 million to its population, more people than lived in the Soviet Union during that time. China’s population reached 1 billion in the early 1980s and exceeded 1.3 billion in the early 21st century, expanding by several million people each year. This rapid growth occurred because sanitation and health care improved greatly, so the death rate dropped sharply. The birth rate also fell, but not as fast as the death rate.\n\nThe problem of providing an acceptable quality of life for a society this large—and growing ever larger—has been a major concern in China. In an effort to reduce the rate of population growth, from the late 1970s until 2015 the Chinese government promoted the so-called one-child family. This policy applied mainly to the Han, or mainstream, Chinese (the group that makes up the vast majority of China’s population). In general, married couples were required to have no more than one child, though in rural areas they were permitted to have two children if the first child was female. Rewards such as better opportunities for a single child were offered. Family-planning advice and birth-control devices were easy to obtain and commonly used. Some aspects of policy and policy enforcement differed from province to province. If a woman became pregnant with an additional child, she normally was urged to have an abortion. Sterilization after one child was also promoted. In some areas of China, couples who violated the policy had to pay large fines.\n\nOne problem the government faced was the widespread desire for male children. Peasant families in particular still wanted sons to carry on the male family name and to provide the heavy labor necessary on rural farms. Families also wanted sons because sons were responsible for taking care of their parents economically in old age, as there was a lack of old-age welfare. Thus, there was a more lenient policy in rural China toward couples whose first child was a girl. Nevertheless, the country’s overall sex ratio became skewed, so that over time there were more and more males in China than females. The number of abortions of female fetuses increased. Larger numbers of female children were placed in orphanages or were abandoned. Some incidents of female infanticide, the killing of baby girls, were reported.\n\nDespite all the government’s efforts, family-planning and one-child programs had only limited success in rural areas. Still, population control programs significantly lowered the country’s overall birth rate. As a result, a growing proportion of China’s people were elderly. That ultimately became a concern. The great majority of senior citizens in China rely on their children for support after they retire, and there were fewer children to support them. From time to time, changes were made to relax the one-child policy. In late 2015 Chinese officials announced that the one-child program was ending and that every married couple would be allowed to have two children.\n\nEthnic and Language Groups\n\nThe concept of being Chinese is not based on race. To a certain degree, it is a cultural concept. To speak and behave like a Chinese—in short, to have and accept the Chinese system of cultural values—is to be Chinese. The mainstream Chinese refer to themselves as Han or sons of Han (as in Han Dynasty, a period of great historical significance). They account for some 90 percent of the population. Throughout history, small ethnic groups that came into contact with the Han Chinese have adopted Chinese culture and have been absorbed into the mainstream. This process continues, though there are legal guarantees designed to protect the rights and culture of most minority nationalities.\n\nTraditionally, the definition of a minority nationality in China is a group of people who speak a common language, occupy a common area, and share a common sense of social values. Such groups see themselves as non–Han Chinese—not belonging to the majority Han Chinese population. Most of them speak a non-Chinese language as their first language. The government officially recognizes 55 minority nationalities. In 2005 approximately 123 million people, or nearly 9.5 percent of China’s population, were members of these minority nationalities. In the 2000 census, 18 of the nationalities had populations of 1 million or more, and an additional 30 had at least 10,000 members. Their populations ranged from about 3,000 for the Lhoba, a group in Tibet, to more than 16 million for the Zhuang, who live mainly in southern China.\n\nAlthough the minority nationalities represent a comparatively small proportion of the total population of China, they have an importance in Chinese society beyond their numbers because of the strategic territories many occupy. Most minority nationalities live along China’s sparsely populated frontiers, and many have cultural relationships with minority groups in neighboring countries, such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, North Korea, Mongolia, Thailand, and Myanmar (Burma). If these groups became hostile toward the central government, it could affect China’s national security.\n\nIn part, the guarantees protecting the minority nationalities are expressed in the structure of the administrative system. In addition to the provinces, there are several administrative units with a status equivalent to a province. Among them are five autonomous regions based on the location of five of the larger minority nationalities. They include the Zhuang, who live mainly in the Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi, in the south. The Hui, or Chinese Muslims, live mostly in the Hui Autonomous Region of Ningxia, in the north-central part of the country. The Uighurs (or Uygurs) are a Turkic group in the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang in the northwest. The Tibetans live in the Tibet Autonomous Region and parts of Qinghai and Sichuan provinces, in the west. Finally, the Mongols are centered on the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in the north. In addition to these five groups, many smaller minority groups are given some degree of local self-government in smaller units such as autonomous prefectures, counties, and townships.\n\nThis administrative system is designed to give the minorities political equality with the Han people and to help them maintain their distinctive identities. The government has also adopted measures to promote economic growth among minorities to enable their per capita incomes to catch up with those of the Han Chinese. At the same time, a form of Mandarin Chinese is promoted as the official language of the country. All minority peoples are urged to learn it.\n\nChinese Language\n\nThere are two elements to the Chinese language: the written language and the spoken language. The written language is based on thousands of individual symbols called characters, each of which represents a concept or thing. Spoken Chinese includes a number of different mutually unintelligible forms, each with numerous dialects. In other words, there is not one spoken Chinese language but several, and speakers of one form cannot automatically understand the other forms—though they all use more or less the same system of written characters.\n\nThe written language is not based on an alphabet, though a national phonetic alphabet was devised for dictionary use. Several systems of writing Chinese words in alphabets of foreign languages have also been created. Those that use the Latin alphabet are called romanization systems. Starting in the early 1950s a standard system of romanization called Pinyin was developed in China. It is now commonly used for teaching the language, for dictionaries, and for representing Chinese words in languages that use the Latin alphabet, including English. Most of the spellings of Chinese sounds and names in this article are based on the Pinyin system. Those that are not are generally very familiar names in common use prior to the 1980s, such as the name of the Chinese Nationalist party, the Kuomintang (Guomindang in Pinyin).\n\nAs mentioned above, some types of spoken Chinese are very different from each other. All of them use tones to distinguish different words that otherwise have the same sounds. Mandarin, which is spoken in the Beijing region and in northern China generally, has four common tones. Cantonese, spoken in southern China, has nine tones and is quite different from Mandarin. Today, a form of Mandarin based on Beijing-area speech is called putonghua (meaning “common language”); it is the official language of government and education, and everyone is expected to learn to speak it. The country has also implemented a simplified system of Chinese characters, which is in common use throughout China except for Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, where the traditional written forms remain standard.\n\nReligion\n\nBefore the communist revolution, a number of religious and philosophical systems were practiced in China. Officially, the Chinese Communist party is atheist, and during the period from 1949 to about 1980 religious observance declined. Today, it is difficult to determine exactly how many people practice various religions. A large number of people describe themselves as nonreligious or atheist. Others admit to following a local “folk religion,” Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, or Daoism (Taoism). While religion officially is permitted in China today, organized religion must operate within parameters dictated by the Chinese government.\n\nTraditionally Daoism and Confucianism provided ethical guides to the proper behavior of individuals and officials. Both of these systems originated in China during the so-called Golden Age of Chinese thought, some 2,500 years ago. Daoism sought to promote the inner peace of individuals and harmony with their surroundings. Confucianism, based on the teachings and writings of the philosopher Confucius (Kongzi), is an ethical system that sought to teach the proper way for all people to behave in society. Each relationship—husband-wife, parents-children, ruler-subjects—involved a set of obligations which, if upheld, would lead to a just and harmonious society.\n\nBuddhism came to China from India by the 1st century ad and later became quite influential there. It flourished in China especially in the 5th to early 9th centuries. It has been estimated that about 5 percent of Chinese admitted to being Buddhists in 2005.\n\nPrior to 1949, practices that may best be called folk religions were common throughout China. Although they incorporated elements of Buddhism and, especially, Daoism, these religions were usually local, often based on local gods, and served the local people. Today, more than a quarter of the population is thought to practice a folk religion of some kind.\n\nIslam came to China mainly from Central Asia, where it was practiced by many of the Turkic peoples. Two autonomous regions, Ningxia and Xinjiang, have been designated for two groups of Islamic adherents, the Hui and the Uighur, respectively.\n\nChristian missionaries have been active in China since Roman Catholics belonging to the Jesuit order arrived in the early 17th century. Protestant missionaries first appeared in the early 19th century. All the Christian missionaries had difficulty converting the Chinese because Christianity was associated in the popular mind with Western imperialism. By 1949 there were only 3 or 4 million Christians in China, less than 1 percent of the total population.\n\nThe communists have discouraged religious practices, which they consider antisocialist. Many religious groups, such as the Falun Gong, are considered to be cults. In the early years of communist rule, many temples and churches were closed and their property taken. During the Cultural Revolution, a mass movement that lasted officially from 1966 to 1977, conditions were especially difficult, and religious practitioners were persecuted.\n\nThe situation eased after 1977. Buddhist temples have been allowed to reopen. Christian worship services have been permitted once again, but only in churches under the control of the official national Roman Catholic and Protestant organizations. Underground Catholic churches and Protestant “house churches” (privately organized in people’s homes) began spreading through the Chinese countryside in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. In particular Protestant groups have expanded rapidly and often incorporate unconventional practices in their faith and services. The Falun Gong meditation and exercise religious grouping has been severely repressed. The Chinese government remains cautious about all religious activity and is especially opposed to foreign missionary activity.\n\nSociety and the Family\n\nTraditionally the family has been the most important unit of society, and this is still true. The family is also an important economic unit. In rural areas, the traditional family consisted of the head of the household, his sons, and their wives and children, often living under one roof. Common surnames gave families membership in a clan, and clans were very important in southern China. In some villages all families had the same surname, or four or five surname clans might account for most of the villagers.\n\nLand, the main form of wealth in traditional China, was divided equally among all of a landowner’s surviving sons when he died. Thus, as China’s population grew, the landholdings became smaller and smaller, and many people were very poor. In the first half of the 20th century the family as a social unit came under severe stress. Rural conditions were bad, income was low, and food was often scarce. Health care was poor or nonexistent for most peasants, and mortality rates were high. Civil unrest, warfare, and foreign invasions added to the difficulties.\n\nAfter the communist revolution in 1949 rural conditions stabilized. Private ownership of land was abolished, but each peasant family was given a small plot to farm. Health care improved. The fluctuations in the food supply leveled off and life expectancy increased. Living conditions for the average peasant are generally better today than they were in 1949, and there are opportunities for at least some education.\n\nFor many years, peasant families were organized into large collectives that worked farmland together. Reforms introduced after 1978 once again made individual households the basic rural production units. Despite formal state ownership of the land, individual families now hold long-term leases of their plots for farming.\n\nFamily life is somewhat different in urban areas than in rural ones. While some rural families still have three generations under one roof, in the cities, families usually are smaller, often composed only of parents and a child. Since both parents normally work, children are left in day-care centers or schools. Today, family life for most people in the cities is stable, and family ties continue to play a major role in the lives of both parents and children.\n\nCities\n\nChina’s urban areas began to grow greatly in the second half of the 20th century. While less than a quarter of the Chinese people lived in and around cities in 1975, by 2005 more than two fifths did. By sheer numbers, there are more urban dwellers in China than in the United States and Russia combined. Some of the cities are quite large. Shanghai, for example, has about 15 million people living in its built-up area; Beijing and Chongqing have more than 10 million in urban areas, and Tianjin and a few others have more than 5 million. Many other cities have more than 1 million people each.\n\nChina’s cities have expanded rapidly and are continuing to expand. The government is attempting to regulate urban growth in order to avoid such problems as overcrowding, slum development, and unemployment. It remains more difficult for a person to move to a city if he or she does not have an urban household registration (hukou) permit. The household registration system used to slow the migration of people to cities and encourage the kind of urban and regional growth that planners wanted. This system has largely broken down since the late 1990s. People without an urban household registration can now move to the cities, but they face difficulties in finding good housing, decent education, and high paying jobs.\n\nLiterature and the Arts\n\nChinese culture is remarkable for its duration and diversity. Chinese music, dance, theater, and visual arts have a long history. The written language and literature are central to China’s culture. Scholars have identified inscriptions on pottery dating to about 4000 bc, and written Chinese has developed continuously since about 1200 bc, making it the world’s oldest written language in continuous use. China’s tradition of storytelling is rich.\n\nLiterature\n\nChina has a very old and rich tradition in literature. Early writings were generally philosophical or religious essays such as the works of Confucius (Pinyin: Kongzi or Kongfuzi; 551–479 bc) and Laozi (probably 6th century bc). These writings were often about how people should act and how the society and political system should be organized and operated. A strong tradition of historical writing also evolved. After the fall of a dynasty, for example, a grand history of the late dynasty was commissioned and written by scholars in the next dynasty.\n\nIn addition to philosophical, religious, and historical writings, China also produced poetry, novels, and dramatic writings from an early date. Poetry became well established as a literary form during the Tang Dynasty, from ad 618 to 907. Two of China’s greatest poets, Li Bai (Li Bo) and Du Fu, wrote during this period. Poetry, often dealing with the relationship of humans to their natural surroundings, has remained an important genre in Chinese literature.\n\nEarly Chinese novels often stressed character development and usually centered on an adventure or supernatural happening; an example is the classic Ming Dynasty version of Shuihuzhuan (The Water Margin). Historical themes were also popular, as in Sanguozhi yanyi (Romance of the Three Kingdoms), written in the late Yuan, or Mongol, period. There were also love stories such as the extremely popular Hongloumeng (Dream of the Red Chamber), probably China’s most famous novel, written in the 18th century by Cao Zhan. Many of the early novels were written anonymously. Often these works were written in the vernacular, or everyday language, rather than literary language, and many authors felt it was beneath their station to be associated with this type of writing.\n\nChina’s literary tradition continues to the present, though much 20th-century and early 21st-century writing concentrated on efforts to reform or modernize China. Increasingly, Chinese literature has offered glimpses into the tragic incidents since 1949, such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. Probably the most famous 20th-century writer was Lu Xun, a poet, essayist, and novelist whose work focused on the need to modernize through revolution. Under communism, writers have been expected to uphold the values of the socialist state, though the degree of control over their output has varied.\n\nArts\n\nChinese art, like Chinese literature, goes back to early times. Early themes were developed from religious and supernatural beliefs or from the natural environment and landscape. One of the most basic forms of Chinese art is calligraphy, the painting of Chinese characters with a brush. Calligraphy has developed as a pure art form with its own standards of excellence. Building on the tradition of calligraphy, Chinese painting developed a distinctive style that differs greatly from traditional Western painting. It is more efficient in terms of brushstrokes and appears more abstract. Landscapes have always been a popular theme.\n\nWith their stress on simplicity and economy, traditional Chinese calligraphy, painting, and poetry are closely related. In all of them, the artist seeks to express both inner harmony and harmony with the natural surroundings. Chinese poets and painters often have sought inspiration by withdrawing to isolated, mountainous areas, and these landscapes have become conventional themes of Chinese art. Similarly, Chinese architecture has traditionally aimed to convey harmony with society and nature.\n\nThe army of magnificent life-size terra-cotta statues of men and horses discovered in the early 1970s in the tomb of an emperor who died in 210 bc provide some indication of the long history of Chinese sculpture. After the introduction of Buddhism into China, Buddhist subjects became dominant themes of the sculptor’s art. Perhaps best known (and most copied) in the West, however, are the works of Chinese decorative artists, such as pottery, bronzes, lacquerware, and exquisitely detailed jade and ivory carvings.\n\nThe oldest art forms in China are music and dance, both of which continue to be appreciated in modern society. Drama is another old and important art form. Chinese drama usually combines vernacular language with music and song and has been popular with the common people. A variety of popular and standard themes are presented in Peking (Beijing) Opera, which developed in the mid-19th century from earlier styles. It is probably the best known of several Chinese operatic traditions. Chinese opera is a favorite artistic and cultural medium.\n\nEducation and Health\n\nThe large population and vast territory of China pose an enormous challenge for the government in terms of meeting the basic educational and medical needs of the people. The school system in China is an important means for both instilling values in and teaching skills to its people. Traditional Chinese culture attached great importance to education as a means of enhancing a person’s worth and career. The health of the Chinese population has improved overall since 1949, though health facilities remain unevenly distributed.\n\nEducation\n\nThe traditional educational system in China was based on literacy and the ability to read and write essays about the Confucian classics. Social advancement was achieved through successful completion of the imperial examinations, leading to an appointment in the imperial bureaucracy. Therefore, the questions asked in the imperial examinations determined the nature of the educational system. Since this examination system was used for many centuries and was not discarded until 1905, the Chinese educational system changed little during that time. The emphasis was on interpretation of the Confucian classics and the writing of elegant essays. Practical and scientific subjects were excluded.\n\nAlthough in theory the imperial examinations were open to any male, only the wealthy could afford to give their sons the years of schooling that were necessary for success. It is no wonder that the highest social class, the elite of traditional Chinese society, came to be called the scholar-gentry. They controlled the land and wealth, and, in general, only their sons were taught the Confucian classics, passed the imperial examinations, and became imperial officers.\n\nIn the late 19th century, as the weaknesses of the Chinese economic and social system became more obvious, calls for reforming the educational system grew louder. Peking University, in Beijing, with modern programs and courses, was founded in 1898. In 1905 the old imperial examination system was abolished. New courses in Western science and other nontraditional subjects were introduced, and new schools were established. The early 20th century was a period of rapid educational and intellectual change. Many young Chinese wanted to overturn the old society completely and reform China along modern, Western lines. Others advocated educational reform and social and political change, but within the framework of the traditional Confucian values.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century vast efforts were made to promote literacy. Both the Nationalist and Communist parties supported literacy and education, and both parties used education to promote their political goals. By 1945, however, it was estimated that only 20 percent of China’s people could read and write.\n\nAfter the communists came to power in 1949 literacy rose rapidly. It is estimated that by the 21st century just over 90 percent of those over age 15 were literate. Educational policy, however, has varied considerably. Generally, a primary school education has been made available to almost everyone. About 75 percent of urban 10- to 18-year-olds are able to attend school, whereas about half of the rural youth in that age group attend school. The rural education figures in the poorer parts of China are high by world standards, reflecting a belief that basic knowledge is essential to rural development and economic progress. By the early 2000s China had a nine-year compulsory education system in place.\n\nEducation at the college or university level is more difficult to obtain, however. University fees have skyrocketed in recent years. Despite this, the number of college students has greatly increased, reaching about 5 million in 2005.\n\nSince the 1950s policies on college admission have changed from time to time. During the Cultural Revolution stress was placed on “good political background” as a requirement, and technical expertise was strongly criticized. Many schools and most universities were closed at that time. The political climate changed from the late 1970s. Schools and universities were reopened. Admission came to be based on achievement, and scholastic goals emphasized technical learning and proficiency in subject matter. The political leaders who came to power after the Cultural Revolution believed that an educated group of professional managers, technicians, researchers, and teachers was essential for the modernization and development of China. Since 1978 the only requirement for admission to college has been a passing score on an entrance examination. The political background of an applicant’s parents is no longer a factor.\n\nHealth and welfare\n\nThere has been remarkable improvement in the health and material well-being of most of China’s people since the civil war. Life expectancy at birth has more than doubled, rising from an estimated 35 years in 1949 to more than 73 years in 2008. In the same period, the annual death rate declined from 23 per 1,000 population to about seven per 1,000.\n\nTwo major factors help to account for this progress. First, there has been a steady general improvement in the diet of the average citizen, resulting from larger and more reliable crop production. The old problem of periodic famine has largely disappeared, though poor harvests may still result in shortages.\n\nThe second factor is the great improvement in the nature and quality of health care. Diseases such as tuberculosis, cholera, typhus, malaria, leprosy, smallpox, typhoid, and bubonic plague traditionally took a heavy toll of lives in China. In addition, a variety of debilitating parasites, such as hookworm and the trematode worm that causes schistosomiasis, were widespread. Dysentery and acute diarrhea were serious problems, especially among young children. Poor diet, insanitary conditions, poverty, and lack of health care made the entire population vulnerable to disease. Fatal illness was frequent and often struck babies and young children.\n\nThe communist government made a tremendous effort to improve this situation. Inoculation against some diseases was emphasized, as were cleanliness and sanitation. Health services, ranging from those provided by hospitals and clinics to “barefoot doctors”—people with some medical training who work especially in the villages—were made available to the entire population. From the 1990s, however, the cost of health care began to rise as China’s social safety net was neglected.\n\nMost of the epidemic diseases that used to sweep over China have been brought under control. Such diseases as tuberculosis, encephalitis, cholera, and malaria and certain parasites still present problems, but to a lesser degree than in the prerevolutionary period. Diarrhea and dysentery are likely to continue as long as human waste (referred to as night soil) is used as a type of farm fertilizer. In recent years, the incidence of cancers has increased, and it is likely that this is connected to an increase in industrial pollution. Nevertheless, the much improved figures of life expectancy indicate the tremendous progress that has been made in the fight against diseases.\n\nEconomy\n\nChina’s traditional economy was based on rural activities and farm production. Ownership of land was the main form of wealth in late imperial times, and large holdings often belonged to absentee landlords who lived in nearby cities. Many peasants were poor and landless and worked as tenants for the absentee landlords or for richer peasants.\n\nFor several centuries one of China’s most serious problems was the rapid growth of the population, which tended to match any increases in food production. This became especially serious after 1800, partly because the supply of farmland grew slowly and partly because the practice of dividing farm holdings among all the surviving sons resulted in ever smaller units of production. Eventually many of the holdings were so small that a family could not sustain itself without going into debt. Once this happened, it was very difficult for the family to clear itself of financial obligation. Large numbers of peasants lost their land as a result. In times of famine and hardship, such families suffered the most.\n\nAs rural poverty spread during the 19th and early 20th centuries, many poor and middle peasants were attracted to political movements that promised radical changes and the breakup of large landholdings. The programs of Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek, and the Nationalist party were intended to improve the people’s livelihood, but much of their political support came from landlords. Therefore, it was difficult for the Nationalists to promote effective and thoroughgoing land reform.\n\nThe Chinese Communist party had no such ties to landlords. At first the party focused its attention on urban workers, but it made little progress. One young communist organizer, Mao Zedong, urged that the party concentrate its efforts on the rural peasantry, and eventually this strategy proved successful. The communists gained power in China partly because of the bad rural conditions that existed there.\n\nWhen the communist government took over in 1949, several paths to economic development and growth were available to it. The Soviet Union’s model of central direction and planning based on the development of heavy industry was one. Another was to retain central planning but to focus on agricultural development and light industry. Still another was to decentralize decision making and allow market forces to determine in part how resources were used. This last option is closest to the capitalism of Western industrialized countries.\n\nAlmost by definition any communist system must include a strong element of central direction and planning. China was no different from other communist states in this respect, and it moved quickly to develop a central planning body to direct the economy and determine the use of resources. Today, the main planning organs remain centrally directed by the State Council, the highest administrative body in the government. Under the State Council is the National Development and Reform Commission, which directs the various departments and offices such as the State Grain Administration, the Department of International Cooperation, and the Department of Laws and Regulations. The National Development and Reform Commission was formed in 2003. It has less power over the economy than the State Planning Commission used to have prior to the opening of market reforms in the 1980s.\n\nAnother important aspect of China’s economic system after 1950 was state ownership of all land and major equipment, what Marxists call the “means of production.” Initially land seized from the big landlords was given to peasants, but by 1955 all land was taken over by the state and organized into collective farms. A small fraction was later returned to the peasants as their own family plots, but there has not been any true private ownership of land in China since 1955.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1980 and even beyond, China followed several strategies to promote economic growth and development, but they were all based on central planning and direction, in what is called a “command” economy. However, there were substantial variations in the amount of decision making left to individuals at the local level and in the types of incentives available to individual farmers and workers. In the early 1950s China followed the Soviet model, focusing on the development of heavy industry to the neglect of other sectors of the economy. Over the years, however, there were shifts in the relative emphasis placed on heavy industry, light and consumer-oriented industries, and agriculture.\n\nSome of the changes in emphasis were tied to changes in the political orientation and thinking of the leadership. In the past such shifts were often reflected in major policy statements and associated with mass participation campaigns. Examples of mass participation campaigns are the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1959 and the Four Modernizations program beginning in 1978. The Cultural Revolution was basically a political movement, though it did have far-reaching effects on the economy and on economic development.\n\nFrom the 1980s a market-based economy, in which the state plays a smaller role in planning and controlling the economy, has been steadily developed. Private enterprises are now allowed to compete in many sectors, though key industries, such as mining, remain within the state plan. By 2001 the gross domestic product (GDP) of China had increased twofold from that of 1990 and China had become the world’s sixth largest economy. From 2002 to 2007, China’s GDP growth averaged 10.6 percent per year and China emerged as the world’s fourth largest economy. Although economic growth began to slow in 2008 because of a global financial crisis, it quickly rebounded. In 2010 China became the world’s second largest economy, after only the United States.\n\nAgriculture, Fishing, and Forestry\n\nAgriculture and rural activities are important in China for several reasons. Farming provides the food and fiber needed for the sustenance of China’s people. At the same time, about 50 percent of the people depend on agriculture or related rural activities for their livelihood, with about 20 percent engaged solely in agriculture. Although manufacturing contributes the largest share of the GDP, a larger number of people work in agriculture.\n\nIn addition, agriculture is seen as an important sector of the economy since food self-sufficiency has been a national goal. Moreover, if hard work, good management, and the application of sound, scientific farming make Chinese agriculture productive, capital surpluses can be created and invested in other sectors of the economy. This can accelerate the rate of economic growth and ultimately benefit all of China’s people.\n\nTraditional farming\n\nIn the thousands of years that farming has been practiced in China, the Chinese have refined and perfected their agricultural techniques. For example, they developed an elaborate system of maintaining the nutrient levels in the soil by collecting all organic wastes (including human wastes), fermenting them, and applying them to the fields. Traditional Chinese agriculture is labor intensive; that is, the emphasis is on using many workers to increase the crop yield per unit of land rather than on increasing the productivity of the individual worker. With each improvement in land management and crop production, the food supply increased, the land was able to support more people, and the population tended to rise accordingly until the pressure on the land became very great.\n\nThis cycle has continued in China throughout its history. One can say that agricultural success is responsible for China’s fairly large population in relation to its arable area. At the same time, a rising population meant that the workers themselves remained in relative poverty. This situation was made worse by a system of inheritance whereby land was subdivided into smaller and smaller holdings in each succeeding generation. By the 16th century China’s farm sector was lagging, and the country began to experience an economic slowdown. It became a society in need of resource-saving technology, which proved harder to develop than labor-saving technology.\n\nPart of the problem in further developing Chinese agriculture is a shortage of farmland, relative to the population. Although China has a slightly larger land area than the United States, it has only about half as much land that is suitable for growing crops and more than four times the population. China today has about 300 million acres (120 million hectares) of cultivated land. For centuries China has struggled to expand the supply of farmland. In the 19th century the migration of Han Chinese into frontier areas in the northeastern and western parts of the country resulted in the opening up of much new land to agriculture. However, these areas are generally cold, dry, or both, and farm productivity there is low compared with the traditional farming areas in the east.\n\nAt the same time, a substantial amount of prime farmland has been lost over the years as cities grew, transportation networks expanded, and factories were established or enlarged. This loss has become critical since the late 1940s as a result of rapid urbanization and industrialization. One problem is that most of China’s cities are located in the midst of the best farming regions. Also, the irrigation systems that have been constructed to help the farmers result in a loss of farmland, which is taken over for dams, lakes, canals, and irrigation ditches. Since 1950 the amount of available cropland per person has declined by more than half, to less than one-fourth acre (0.1 hectare). If the population continues to grow, the land reclamation projects currently under way will do no more than offset the losses of farmland around the cities.\n\nSocialist agriculture\n\nThe communist government that came to power in 1949 was determined to promote socialist agricultural methods. Initially its approach was cautious, since it needed the support and loyalty of the peasants in order to consolidate power. In the early 1950s land was taken away from the landlords and distributed among about 300 million poor peasants. In 1952 the government initiated mutual aid teams, which organized peasants into labor groups that worked together to raise production. Three years later, the mutual aid teams were combined into producer cooperatives, which pooled the peasants’ lands so they could be farmed collectively. In the following year, 1956, large collective farms were formally established and the state took over ownership of the land. The peasants were permitted to retain small “private plots” for their own use, but they were expected to derive their main livelihood by working together for the collective farm.\n\nIn 1958 Mao Zedong, the country’s leader, initiated a mass campaign called the Great Leap Forward, with the aim of driving the peasants to produce more. At that time, the collectives were merged into large units called communes. Initially, the Great Leap Forward involved a number of new programs, such as rural industrialization, abolition of private plots, and communal eating. However, some of them proved unpopular, and food production began to decline. Perhaps most serious was the abolition of private plots, which drastically reduced pig production and thus the amount of hog manure available for fertilizer. Private plots were restored in 1962, but the commune remained the main unit of rural economic organization.\n\nCommunes covered from 10 to 50 square miles (25 to 130 square kilometers) and averaged 15,000 people. They were subdivided into production brigades and production teams. Brigades often served as administrative and planning subunits. Production teams, the primary production units, were usually composed of 80 to 160 people charged with cultivating 20 to 95 acres (8 to 38 hectares) of land. Where possible, teams were drawn from a single hamlet, and members sometimes belonged to common surname groups (clans) or were old acquaintances.\n\nMao died in 1976, and in 1978 the new leadership group launched the Four Modernizations (of agriculture, industry, science and technology, and defense). As part of this program, the Production Responsibility System was introduced. This system permits individual families to contract with the collective unit, usually the production team (which now most closely corresponds to a village), to lease land for farm production. The family agrees to a quota and pays a certain agricultural tax. Any surplus the family produces beyond its quota and taxes may be kept for its own purposes or sold for income. The family can decide how much of each crop to plant as long as it meets its quota.\n\nThis system expanded rapidly and now covers virtually all farm families. The government acknowledged that some farmers will do better than others and that inequalities will appear. However, economic growth has been achieved for many who have chosen to remain in agriculture. Overall farm production rose rapidly in the early 1980s but slowed thereafter, with many peasants leaving agriculture for rural township enterprises and increasingly for towns and cities by the 1990s.\n\nCrops and livestock\n\nChina’s principal food crops are rice, wheat, corn (maize), gaoliang (a type of sorghum), millet, barley, potatoes, peanuts (groundnuts), apples, rapeseed, and sunflower seeds. Of these, rice is the most vital. China is the world’s largest producer of rice, and rice accounts for about one quarter of the country’s total area of cultivated land. Wheat, corn, and millet follow rice in importance. China has begun to grow genetically modified crops and has invested heavily in genetically modified crop research.\n\nThe most important industrial crops include cotton, oil-bearing crops (such as peanuts and rapeseed), sugar (both cane sugar and beet sugar, with sugarcane production rising rapidly from 1978), tobacco, bast fiber (for cordage, matting, and similar uses), tea, and fruits. While China has shown an interest in growing biofuel crops, this is likely to be hampered by the general shortage of agricultural land.\n\nPoultry and livestock production has risen rapidly in recent years. Pork remains the favored meat of most Han Chinese. Sheep, goats, and camels are raised by nomadic herders in the interior portions of China.\n\nAgricultural regions\n\nIn a sense, it is difficult to discuss Chinese agriculture as a whole, because the climate and physical features—and thus the kinds of crops that are cultivated—vary widely from one part of the country to another. In general, eight distinctive physical-agricultural regions can be considered.\n\nThe Plateau of Tibet in western China is a high, cold, dry, and extremely rugged area with a short growing season. Farmers there can usually grow only enough wheat, barley, and potatoes and raise enough sheep, yaks, and horses to provide for the needs of their own families.\n\nXinjiang, in the northwest, and Inner Mongolia, in the north, also are known for their dryness. They get less than 12 inches (300 millimeters) of precipitation annually and in some areas less than one inch (25 millimeters). Herding is the primary economic activity, though oasis agriculture is carried on where water is available. Crops include grain, cotton, sugar beets, medicinal plants, and fruits and melons.\n\nIn north-central China the Loess Plateau lies largely southeast of the Great Wall and north of the Qin Mountains. The loess that covers most of the area has eroded into badlands in places. This region is dry and has long, cold winters. Drought-tolerant crops such as millet and gaoliang are common. Wheat, corn, and cotton are also planted extensively, especially where irrigation water is available.\n\nIn the east, the North China Plain lies south of the Great Wall and extends from the coast to the mountains and hills to the west and south. The floodplains of the Huang He (Yellow River) and the Huai River are the main features. Several problems exist there. There is not enough rainfall, the winters are cold and long, and some of the soils are salty because of poor drainage. The main crops are wheat, barley, cotton, corn, gaoliang, millet, and peanuts.\n\nThe Northeast, or Dongbei (formerly called Manchuria), suffers from extremely cold winters, a short growing season, and poor drainage on the large Northeast Plain. The fields in this region are large, and heavy farm machinery has been used extensively. The chief crops include spring wheat, corn, millet, gaoliang, flax, and soybeans. A great deal of land reclamation has taken place in Heilongjiang Province. State farms remain the main form of agricultural organization in the northern land reclamation areas.\n\nThe middle and lower Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) basin in central China is the country’s richest and most productive agricultural region, the “rice bowl” of China. The lowlands contain extensive areas of rich, river-borne alluvial soils. Precipitation is abundant, and the winters are mild. Rice is the main crop, but cotton, tea, and oilseeds are also important. The farming methods are very intensive and yields are high. Much of the fertile land of this region is farmed all year-round.\n\nSouth China includes the region south of the Yangtze River basin along China’s southern and southeastern coasts, a land of rugged hills and low mountains interspersed with river basins. Much of this region lies within the tropics. Precipitation is abundant and the growing season is long, but only 10 percent of the area is flat enough to permit row cropping. The main crops are rice, sugarcane, mulberries (grown primarily for silkworm culture), fruit, and freshwater fishes raised in ponds or rice paddies. The Pearl (Zhu) River delta plain around Guangzhou (Canton) is one of the most productive farming regions in China.\n\nThe southwestern region contains the Sichuan Basin and extends south to include the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Much of this region consists of rugged hills and mountains. Except for the Yuan (Red) River basin and the large Chengdu Plain of Sichuan, it is not very productive. Two crops per year of rice is common where the terrain and soil conditions are right. Shifting cultivation of the slash-and-burn (swidden) type is practiced among isolated peoples in the extreme southwest.\n\nFishing\n\nChina has a long tradition of ocean and freshwater fishing and of aquaculture. The country is by far the world’s leading producer of fish, though severe shortages of seafood have been occurring in its rivers and lakes and along its coasts in recent years. Fish farming has always also been important and has been increasingly emphasized to supplement coastal and inland fisheries threatened by overfishing.\n\nMost of China’s total catch is from the ocean. The coastal zone is rich in fish variety. All the coastal seas (Bo Hai, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea) have extensive areas of shallow water over the continental shelf. In these seas, especially the Yellow and East China, cold and warm ocean currents mix, creating an environment that is especially suitable for many species of ocean fishes, including croakers, mackerels, tuna, herring, and sharks. Several varieties of shellfish and specialties such as squid and octopus are also produced. Unfortunately, fish stocks have been depleted in recent years.\n\nFish farming on ponds and lakes in the interior of China is also important. This type of food production, called aquaculture, has a long history in some parts of the country. It is common in the moister southeastern portions of China. For example, southwest of Guangzhou there is an area of fishponds, mulberry orchards, and sugarcane fields. The fish are fed the leaves from the sugarcane and the waste from the silkworms, which feed on the mulberry leaves. The mud in the bottom of the fishponds is scraped up and used to fertilize the cane and the mulberry trees. In this way many of the nutrients are recycled. The fishponds produce several varieties of carp, a favorite food in southern China and Hong Kong. Such fish production is a regionally important dietary supplement. The government has identified fishing as an important area for continued research and development.\n\nForestry\n\nDespite China’s large land area, its forests are modest. Much of the western interior is too high or too dry to support dense forest stands. In the humid east, the forests were harvested for centuries for building material and firewood, and little or no effort was made to regenerate them. In 1949 it was estimated that about 8 percent of the total surface of the country was covered with forests. Since then, an active program of forestation has been undertaken, and it is estimated that the forested area has been increased to 18 to 19 percent. Still, harvested timber probably exceeds annual growth, with larger trees becoming scarce. The government’s goal is to reach 26 percent forest coverage by 2050. By contrast, more than 30 percent of the United States is forested.\n\nAs China’s population and economy have grown, demand for wood and paper products has risen rapidly. China has been unable to meet this demand, and it seems doubtful that it will be able to do so in the foreseeable future. For example, there is a great need for railroad ties, electric utility poles, mine props, and building joists. China has increased timber imports. The country also has had to seek out substitutes, such as concrete poles or steel beams, but these require energy to produce and are expensive. The destruction of forests has also had an effect on watersheds, leading to the creation of barren land, soil erosion, and the silting up of stream channels. This, in turn, can result in flooding and raise the cost of irrigation.\n\nChina’s main forests are located in the Da Hinggan and Changbai mountains of the Northeast region and in southwestern China, with other forests largely in central and southeastern China. Northern conifers, larch, and birch are common trees of the Northeast. Southwestern China’s forested area is a mix of deciduous and evergreen species. The forests of central and southeastern China are poorer, partly because they have been harvested so extensively, but there are stands of eucalyptus and tropical hardwoods there in addition to other deciduous and evergreen species. Bamboo is an important forest plant that has a variety of uses in both building construction and furniture making.\n\nIndustry\n\nMining and energy\n\nThe total extent of China’s mineral resources is not known, but as of 2006 China had discovered 171 minerals of all sorts with the reserves of 158 verified. Many of these deposits were discovered after 1950, and new ones are still being found. China’s reserves of coal, tungsten, antimony, tin, mercury, salt, fluorspar, and magnesite are among the largest of any country in the world. It also has sizeable reserves of iron and manganese ores, bauxite (aluminum ore), limestone, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, graphite, and gold, as well as some petroleum reserves. There are some significant deficiencies, such as nickel, cobalt, titanium, and platinum group metals, but generally China has one of the largest and richest stocks of minerals of any country. Per capita, however, China’s mineral resources are only about 58 percent of the world’s average. In the early 21st century, its demand for petroleum and several other minerals surpassed production.\n\nMore than a tenth of the world’s coal reserves are found in China. It is the world’s leading producer of coal, supplying about two fifths of global total production. Coal is mined throughout China, though the main production is concentrated in Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Hebei, and Liaoning provinces in the north and northeast. Both open-pit and underground mining are practiced. Coal is the chief energy resource of the country and is likely to remain so at least through the first half of the 21st century. In many local areas it is also the main material used to produce fertilizers. The government plans to continue expansion of coal production, though it is shutting down small-scale coal mining operations, which are seen as unsafe and polluting.\n\nIron and steel manufacturing are major industries in China. There are extensive iron-ore deposits, as well as the coal and limestone needed for steel production. Much of the iron ore is concentrated in the Northeast, the traditional center of the heavy metals industry. Mining of all types of minerals is expanding rapidly. Such minerals as tungsten and yttrium are exported, though rapid economic growth in the early 2000s led to a sharper rise in mineral imports than exports.\n\nFor many years it was believed that China lacked significant petroleum reserves. Production before 1950 was small, and most petroleum products were imported. After 1952 a good deal of effort was spent on petroleum exploration, and deposits were found both on land and offshore. The main production centers are in the North China Plain and in the Northeast, in Heilongjiang Province at Daqing. Offshore deposits are located in the Bo Hai, South China Sea, East China Sea, and Yellow Sea.\n\nOil production rose steadily from the 1960s, and since the mid-1970s China has ranked as one of the 10 leading oil-producing countries in the world. For many years, a small quantity of this output was exported to earn foreign currency. China became a net importer of oil in the mid-1990s, however, and the proportion that has been imported has grown rapidly since then. Along with the growth of imports, China began to explore and drill for oil overseas.\n\nChina has also developed its enormous hydroelectric potential so that a larger share of its domestic demand for electric power can be met with renewable hydropower. Hydropower is tapped from moving water such as waterfalls and fast-moving streams. Many projects have been undertaken in the southwestern part of the country. The most famous hydroelectric project in China is the Sanxia, or Three Gorges, Dam in central China, which is the world’s largest dam in terms of the volume of poured concrete. Such large projects are now being questioned within China because of the ecological damage they can do. However, the Chinese government seems to prefer hydroelectric projects to building coal-fired power plants, which can produce considerable pollution and greenhouse gasses.\n\nManufacturing\n\nBefore the introduction of Western technology in the 19th century, China had a long tradition of local industry going back almost 2,000 years. During that period the Chinese developed many technical innovations. From an early date they produced paper, gunpowder, and silk and printed from movable type. The tradition of making fine porcelain dates at least from the Tang Dynasty (ad 618–907). The production of luxury goods, fine handicrafts, metalwork, and tools were all well-established industries long before the arrival of Western entrepreneurs and engineers.\n\nIn the 19th century European industrial technology was introduced into China. New factories and manufacturing enterprises were established in the so-called treaty port cities, where the Western countries had obtained certain rights. Shanghai became an industrial center, as did some cities along major rivers such as the Yangtze. During the 20th century the Northeast region developed rapidly as a center for coal and iron-ore production and the heavy metal and machine-building industries. The Soviets and Japanese, who controlled the area at various times, both invested heavily in the region’s transportation and industry. It became the most industrialized part of the country. Other cities that developed into important industrial centers were Tianjin and Qingdao.\n\nOne of the first goals of the communists after 1949 was to promote the growth of heavy industry, following the model of the Soviet Union. They attempted to encourage industrial development in the interior and to avoid concentrating more wealth in the old treaty port cities. New steel mills were constructed at Wuhan on the Yangtze and at Baotou in Inner Mongolia. Other interior cities, such as Zhengzhou, Xi’an, Lanzhou, Ürümqi, Taiyuan, Beijing, and Shijiazhuang, also grew rapidly. At the same time, large coastal cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Lüda (now Dalian) continued to attract industries that wished to take advantage of their good transport systems and physical facilities. These cities also provided a skilled labor force and access to international markets.\n\nThe whole range of industrial goods is produced in China today. The output of China’s factories extends from textiles, shoes, and toys to railway locomotives, aircraft, automobiles, and computers. China is the world’s largest producer of cotton and cotton textiles, and it exports large quantities of textiles and garments. Food processing is important, and many agricultural goods are exported. China is also the world leader in the production of cement, iron, and steel. Other industrial products include televisions, bicycles, washing machines, and cars and trucks. In 2007 China was the third largest motor vehicle producer in the world after Japan and the United States. The processing and manufacture of chemicals, including fertilizers, petroleum products, and pharmaceuticals, is another large segment of Chinese industry. The quality of Chinese exports has improved in recent years, despite safety problems in the early 21st century with certain goods such as low-end toys and some foodstuffs.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s China began to develop joint ventures with foreign manufacturers. The foreign concerns provided the technology, capital, and expertise, while China provided the materials, plant location, facilities, and labor. Special tax benefits and other policies favorable to businesses have been used to attract foreign investment in various kinds of economic zones, which are concentrated along the southeastern coast and in major cities. The zones are often associated with the production of goods for export. The most famous of them are the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ) next to Hong Kong; the Zhuhai SEZ bordering Macau; the Xiamen SEZ across the Taiwan Strait from Taiwan; and the Shantou SEZ in eastern coastal Guangdong and the Hainan SEZ, the original homes of many of the Chinese who live overseas in Southeast Asia. The goal of these initial zones was to attract funds from the ethnic Chinese capitalists in the nearby or culturally related territories. While the efforts in the 1980s and the early 1990s did not attract high-tech industries, they did generate lots of employment and profits. They also spearheaded industrial growth up the China coast and into parts of the interior. By the early 21st century a lot of high-tech industries had located in Shenzhen.\n\nFrom the 1990s China began to develop overseas joint ventures using Chinese capital and technology. In particular, Chinese manufacturing expanded into Africa but also to all other continents.\n\nServices\n\nWith the market reforms of the late 20th century and the growth of the economy, the service sector began to expand. In the 2000s services accounted for more than a third of the country’s GDP, making it second only to manufacturing. The share of the GDP contributed by services was lower, however, than in more-developed countries. Public administration, retail and wholesale trade, tourism, real estate, finance, and transportation and communications are important components of this sector. Foreign trade has grown tremendously.\n\nFrom 1949 to the 1990s goods and money were exchanged within localities and regions in China to satisfy local needs and to meet government quotas. At the national level, goods were moved to meet the needs and demands of the overall economy through a national plan. Internationally, China bought scarce goods to meet critical needs and sold goods that it could market at competitive prices in order to pay for imports.\n\nWhile the planned economy continues today, its importance has shrunk drastically. China now has many privately owned corporations run by individual entrepreneurs. As China sought to modernize its economy, foreign trade was used to bring in new equipment and technologies as well as to meet scarcities in the domestic economy. Exports were used to produce foreign earnings to pay for the imports. Until the early 1990s, the Chinese sought to maintain an even balance of trade so they could pay for imports rather than buying on credit. As the Chinese economy took off in the 1990s, exports grew faster than imports. Economic growth was so fast that maintaining a trade balance no longer was seen as an issue. China’s foreign trade as a whole grew from 4.8 billion dollars in 1971 to more than 2.1 trillion (2,100 billion) dollars in 2007. In 2009 China became the largest exporter in the world.\n\nChina’s trading partners changed after 1949. Initially, the communist government traded mainly with the Soviet Union and other communist-bloc countries and also provided Hong Kong and Macau with fresh food. Later, when China’s relations with the Soviet Union became less friendly, there was less emphasis on trade with other communist countries. Japan, Hong Kong, West Germany, Australia, and Canada became increasingly important as trading partners. Trade with the United States rose dramatically after U.S. President Richard Nixon visited China in 1972.\n\nBy the early 2000s the United States was the largest destination country for Chinese goods, accounting for about a fifth of China’s total export trade. Other major export destinations included Japan, countries of the European Union (EU), South Korea, and Singapore. The largest share of China’s imports came from Japan, followed by the EU, South Korea, the United States, Malaysia, and Australia. Taiwan also became one of the mainland’s main trading partners. China and Taiwan signed a historic free-trade agreement in 2010 to gradually reduce or eliminate tariffs on many goods and commodities exported from one side to the other.\n\nChina’s key exports include machinery and equipment, textiles and clothing, footwear, toys, mineral fuels, plastics, optical and medical equipment, and iron and steel. Major imports include machinery and equipment, oil and other fuels, plastics, optical and medical equipment, organic chemicals, and iron and steel.\n\nTransportation and Communications\n\nChina’s transportation system traditionally was poor. Moving people and goods was a slow, expensive, and sometimes dangerous process. Despite large investments in railroad, highway, waterway, and air travel construction, transportation continues to be a bottleneck slowing economic growth. This situation has produced significant variations in regional economic growth.\n\nHistorically, the only convenient and relatively inexpensive transportation arteries were a few large, deep rivers, such as the Yangtze, Sungari (Songhua), Amur, and Xi (West), and the well-traveled barge canals such as the Grand Canal, a series of waterways linking Hangzhou and Beijing. Even on these waterways travel was slow, and the conditions were sometimes difficult or hazardous. Nevertheless, the river and canal system provided the best means of transportation before the 20th century, and China’s waterways still carry about a tenth of the country’s total freight traffic in tons. A large share of this traffic is on the Yangtze.\n\nRailways\n\nRailway construction began in China late in the 19th century, and the first line, between Shanghai and Beijing, was opened in 1903. By World War II more than 15,500 miles (25,000 kilometers) of track had been built, primarily in the eastern and northeastern parts of the country. Much of the network was destroyed during the war, but rail construction began anew after 1949 and has continued ever since. In 2007 China had an estimated 48,500 miles (78,000 kilometers) of railroads. (By comparison, the United States had about three times as much trackage in that year.) Great effort has been made since the late 20th century to speed up new railway construction and to improve the existing network. By 1983 every province-level administrative unit except Tibet was served by rail, and in 2006 the Qinghai-Tibet railway was completed. A line extends from Lianyungang on the east coast to the Xinjiang-Kazakhstan border, linking China to Central Asia and Russia. Freight lines also link China to Europe. Lines run from Chongqing to Duisburg, Germany; from Beijing to Hamburg, Germany; and from Yiwu, in Zhejiang province, to Madrid, Spain. At more than 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers), the Yiwu-Madrid rail route was the longest in the world at the time of its opening in 2014.\n\nRailways have become a very important form of transportation in China, though they have not grown as much as highway transport in recent years. In the 2000s the railroad system moved about a seventh of the country’s total freight traffic in tons.\n\nChina’s rail network consists of a series of north-south trunk lines, crossed by a few major east-west lines. Most of the large cities are served by these trunk lines, but the density of the network is low relative to some other countries. Compared with India, which has roughly 40,000 miles (65,000 kilometers) of railways, China has only about 20 percent more track to serve about three times the area. Many of the trunk lines cannot meet the demand for service.\n\nRoads and highways\n\nAlthough it has been in use for many centuries, the road and path network in China was always poor. Conditions were bad, and travel was slow and costly. Not until the introduction of automobiles and trucks in the 20th century was there much improvement. The road and highway system expanded rapidly after World War II, but by Western standards it was still primitive. The network of all-weather roads and highways was not a unified national system with consistent standards by 1990, and many of the roads were poor. There were also gaps and bottlenecks.\n\nBy the early 21st century, the road network was inadequate to meet the country’s needs. Still, the highway network accounted for more than two-thirds of the yearly total freight traffic in tons (but less than a seventh of the freight in ton-miles). Domestic automobile manufacture grew rapidly after 1990 as individual car ownership became increasingly possible, and it emerged as one of China’s major industries. The number of cars on the roads increased dramatically. China still has a small number of cars per capita (about 3 per hundred persons in the 2000s) when compared with the United States, the European Union, or Japan, so there is more room for expansion if China allows.\n\nAir transportation\n\nCivil air transportation in China dates from World War II and the efforts of Claire Chennault, a retired U.S. colonel, to build a Chinese air force. After 1949 the new government set up the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China to serve as the country’s air carrier. It is now a regulatory body, and there are several Chinese airlines (some run by the state and others by private companies).\n\nBy 2001 China’s daily volume of air passenger transport was 17 times that for the whole year of 1950. Today a few million tons of freight is transported by air each year and there are several international carriers within China. There are even direct flights between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan. China has over 450 airports. The main international hubs are Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong.\n\nShipping\n\nOcean shipping has grown rapidly since 1970. China now has 130 ports open to foreign shipping and eight major port terminals handling billions of tons of freight. The ports at Shanghai and Hong Kong are the busiest. There are thousands of Chinese merchant ships, some now registered overseas. China also has a domestic fleet serving inland and coastal waters. It handles well over a trillion tons of freight annually and also includes a huge number of passenger ships plying China’s major river networks.\n\nChina builds most of its own ships, some of which are exported. For example, many of the containerships (as well as containers) being built are for export.\n\nCommunications\n\nSince 1949 considerable effort has been expended on the postal, telecommunications, and later Internet systems in China, but they are generally not as widespread as in Western countries. By the end of 2007 China had over 210 million Internet users. On a per capita basis, however, the number remained below that of most Western countries, and Internet access was more restricted than in Western countries. Still, this meant that more people in China were logging in at any one time than in any other country in the world. Mobile telephone penetration had reached over one third of the population, with more than 460 million users by 2007. A smaller number of people, more than 360 million, had standard telephone lines.\n\nHistory\n\nWith more than 4,000 years of recorded history, China is one of the few modern countries that also flourished economically and culturally in the earliest stages of world civilization. Indeed, despite the political and social upheavals that frequently ravaged the country, China is unique among nations in its longevity and resilience.\n\nAncient China: Beginnings\n\nArchaeological evidence suggests that China was one of the cradles of the human race. Remains, tools, and other artifacts of the early humans called “Peking man” (or “Beijing man”) were excavated at Zhoukoudian, near Beijing, starting in the 1920s. They date back to 770,000 to 230,000 years ago, to the Lower Paleolithic period (Old Stone Age). Peking man was of the species Homo erectus. Remains of Homo erectus have been unearthed at sites in several other provinces, indicating that these early humans spread over a fairly wide area in China (as well as in other parts of the world). Fossils of early Homo sapiens, or modern humans, have also been found at many sites in China. These humans made tools out of stones and bones, made clothes out of animal hides, and knew how to make fire.\n\nIn about the 4th or 3rd millennium bc, in the Neolithic period (New Stone Age), great changes occurred in the lives of the ancient Chinese. Larger numbers of people began living together at settled places, cultivating land, and domesticating animals. These people made polished stone tools and built shelters in pit dwellings and beehive-shaped huts that were covered with reed roofs. Such villages were found mostly in the area of the great bend of the Huang He (Yellow River) on the North China Plain. Despite its severe winters, this area was well suited to agriculture. In fact, it closely resembled the other cradles of ancient civilizations, such as the valley of the Nile in Egypt.\n\nThe people of this period (3000–2000 bc) also developed the art of making pottery for storing food and drink. Two distinct types have been discovered: red clay pots with swirling black designs of the Yangshao culture in north-central China and smooth black pottery of the Longshan culture in northeastern and north-central China.\n\nXia (2070?–1600?bc) and Shang (1600?–1046 bc) Dynasties\n\nThe Shang Dynasty is the first Chinese dynasty for which definite archaeological evidence and historical records exist. Chinese tradition mentions an earlier Xia Dynasty, but for lack of evidence, the Xia was considered a legendary period. In 1959 discoveries at Erlitou, in Yanshi Municipality, Henan Province, suggested that the site was the capital of the Xia, but this is still in debate. Until the late 1920s the Shang Dynasty itself was thought to be legendary, but discoveries made near the modern city of Anyang (the site of the Shang capital) in Henan Province proved that the dynasty existed. The most important of these discoveries were over 100,000 bones and shells inscribed with still-recognizable characters. These oracle bones and shells, originally used as religious objects, represent the earliest known form of the Chinese writing system.\n\nIn addition to the oracle bones and shells, the superb Shang bronzes and the tombs of the Shang rulers reveal a highly developed society. The Shang used bronze to make weapons, daily tools, and elaborately decorated sacrificial vessels.\n\nThe last Shang ruler was reportedly evil and tyrannical. He was overthrown by a revolt of the people, who were aided by the neighboring Zhou people. Wuwang, the leader of the Zhou, defeated the Shang and founded the Zhou Dynasty.\n\nZhou Dynasty (1046–256 bc)\n\nThe Zhou conquest of the Shang was given an important meaning by later moralistic interpretations of the event. The Zhou kings, whose chief deity was heaven, called themselves “Sons of Heaven,” and their success in overcoming the Shang was seen as the “mandate of heaven.” From this time on, Chinese rulers were called “Sons of Heaven” and the Chinese Empire, the “Celestial Empire.” The transfer of power from one dynasty to the next was based on the mandate of heaven. Zhou rule in China continued for nearly eight centuries. During that time great advances were made. The long period of the Zhou Dynasty is divided into two subperiods: Western (Early) and Eastern (Later) Zhou, named for the locations of the capitals.\n\nWestern (Early) Zhou (1046–771 bc)\n\nWestern Zhou territory covered most of the North China Plain. It was divided into about 200 princely states. The Zhou political system relied on a network of alliances with local rulers, especially those based on extended family relationships. It was similar in some ways to the feudal system of medieval Europe. The capital was located near what is now Xi’an, Shaanxi Province.\n\nThe Zhou people combined hunting and agriculture for a living. Associating the success or failure of crops with the disposition of nature, the people prayed to numerous nature gods for good harvests. One of the ruler’s duties was to placate heaven and Earth for all people. Failure to do so deprived him of the right to rule. Such beliefs are still widely held today among the Chinese people. Ancestor worship also developed during the Zhou period and has been important in East Asia for the last 2,000 years.\n\nThe Zhou were invaded in 771 bc by a less cultured, more militaristic people from the northwest. The capital was moved east to Luoyang, in what is now Henan Province. The manner in which the Western Zhou fell followed a pattern that was repeated throughout Chinese history. People who led a nomadic, or wandering, life in the northern steppe land would invade settled agricultural communities to solve periodic food shortages. Settled Chinese called the nomads “barbarians,” a term applied to all peoples of non-Chinese culture up to the 20th century. From this concept an idea developed that China was the center of the civilized world, hence the traditional name “Middle Kingdom” or “Middle Country” referring to China.\n\nEastern (Later) Zhou (770–256 bc)\n\nThe Eastern Zhou is itself divided into two periods. The first period is named Chunqiu, or Spring and Autumn, after a book credited to Confucius. The second is the Zhanguo, or Warring States, period.\n\nThe Spring and Autumn period lasted from 770 to 476 bc. During this time, iron replaced bronze for tools and weapons. The use of iron led to an increase in agricultural output, population growth, and warfare among the many different princely states.\n\nThe Warring States period began in 475 bc. By the 4th century bc the number of states had shrunk to seven. In 256 bc the princes of those states assumed the title of king, stopped paying homage to the Zhou king, and continued to fight for supremacy. The strongest of the seven states was Qin. Although the Zhou Dynasty fell in 256 bc, the Warring States period lasted until the Qin conquered the other six states and established a new dynasty, in 221 bc.\n\nThe disruption caused by this prolonged warfare had a number of long-range consequences. One was the rise of a new social group, the scholars (shi). They were forerunners of the scholar-officials of the Chinese Empire, who became the most influential group in China. In the Eastern Zhou period, however, they were a relatively small group of learned people. Often wandering from state to state in search of permanent employment, the shi worked as tutors to the children of the princes and as advisers to various state governments. The most famous of these scholarly shi was Confucius.\n\nAge of philosophies\n\nConfucius is a latinized form of the honorific title Kongfuzi (Master Kong), given to a wandering scholar from the state of Lu, in what is now Shandong Province in northeastern China. He lived from 551 to 479 bc. Although little known in his lifetime, he was revered as the greatest of sages throughout most of China’s history. His teaching, Confucianism, was the dominant state teaching from the mid-2nd century bc, during the Han Dynasty, to the end of the imperial period in 1911/12.\n\nDisturbed by constant warfare among the states, Confucius taught that most of the ills of society happened because people forgot their stations in life and rulers lost virtue. He advocated a return to the values of the golden age of antiquity of the legendary emperors Yao and Shun, when rulers were virtuous and people knew their places. Therefore, Confucius’ primary concern lay in social relations, proper conduct, and social harmony. Confucius defined five cardinal relationships: between ruler and ruled, between husband and wife, between parents and children, between older and younger brothers, and between friends. He defined all these relationships, except for the last case, as being between superiors and inferiors. He emphasized the complete obedience and loyalty of the inferior to the superior but also mentioned the benevolence of the superior to the inferior. The ideal Confucian family was an extended one of three or four generations, in which authority rested with the elderly male members. Filial piety (obedience to parents) was one of the most important virtues emphasized by later Confucians.\n\nConfucius reportedly spent his last years compiling, editing, and completing some of the books that came to be known as the Five Classics. These include the Classic of Poetry, the Classic of History, the Spring and Autumn annals, the Record of Rites, and the Classic of Changes, or Yijing (I-Ching). Memorized by scholars for generations in China, these books and four other works, including the Analects, a compilation of Confucian teachings, were the subjects of civil service examinations for over 2,000 years.\n\nConfucianism commanded a greater following some 200 years later, during the time of Mencius, or Mengzi (371?–289? bc). He was second only to Confucius himself in shaping Confucianism. His three main tenets were the basic good nature of human beings, the notion of society with a distinct distribution of functions, and the ruler’s obligation to the people. On the last point, Mencius elaborated on the concept of the mandate of heaven, which allows that rulers lose support of heaven when they cease to be virtuous. The concept served as the basis of revolts in China and the succession of new rulers.\n\nTwo other philosophies that have had an enduring influence on Chinese thought—Daoism and Legalism—also arose in this period. Daoism, with an emphasis on spontaneity and letting things take their natural course, gave the Chinese an alternative to Confucianism. Legalism, which stressed the importance of social conformity and the absolute power of rulers, provided the Chinese state with one of its basic doctrines.\n\nQin Empire (221–207 bc)\n\nThe state of Qin (Ch’in) unified China and established the first Chinese empire in 221 bc. The Qin empire did not last long, but it left two enduring legacies: the name China and the idea and structure of the empire. This heritage outlasted the Qin Dynasty itself by more than 2,000 years.\n\nThe first Qin emperor was called Shihuangdi. The title of emperor was used for the first time in Chinese history to set the Qin ruler apart—as the ruler of the unified land—from the kings, the heads of the earlier, smaller states. The construction of massive palaces and the ceremony of the court further enhanced the power of the emperor by inspiring awe in the people.\n\nA centralized bureaucracy replaced the old system based on extended family ties. The empire was divided into provinces and counties, which were governed by centrally appointed governors and magistrates. The former ruling families who had inherited their places in the aristocracy were uprooted and forced to live in the capital of Xianyang. Other centralizing policies included census taking and standardization of the writing system and of weights and measures.\n\nThe Qin army conducted massive military campaigns to complete the unification of the empire and expand its territory. The Qin empire stretched from the Mongolian plateau in the north to Vietnam in the south. As with rulers before and after"
