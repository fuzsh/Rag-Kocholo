It is a large, thriving boarding and day school with over 1680 students from 55 countries from 3 – 18 years in age. A leading British international school preparing students for I/GCSEs, A levels and the IB Diploma, we pride ourselves on providing an education that is not only academically challenging but also seeks to develop the whole student.\n\nJIS examination results have been truly excellent with students entering the best Universities in the world every year.

Our language teachers are native language speakers from China, France and Brunei.\n\nThe School is divided into two main sections: Junior School, for children ages 3 -11 years and Senior School. Within Senior School, the Middle Years consists of students in Years 7-9 (ages 11-14 years) whilst students in the Upper Years, Years 10-13, follow the IGCSE, IB Diploma and A Level programmes.\n\nAcademic Excellence\n\nIn January 2019, Jerudong International School (JISBrunei) was the first international school in the world to achieve the highest rating in all 9 areas inspected by the British Schools Overseas (BSO) inspectorate. These are:\n\nQuality of Education provided\n\nSpiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils\n\nWelfare, health and safety of pupils\n\nSuitability of proprietor and staff\n\nPremises and accommodation\n\nProvision of information to parents, carers and others\n\nManner in which complaints are handled\n\nQuality of leadership in and management of schools\n\nMinimum standards for boarding\n\nFounded in 1997, JISBrunei is located in South East Asia, in the small, country of Brunei Darussalam, on the island of Borneo. A direct flight from major regional hubs – Singapore, Bangkok, Beijing, Dubai, Shanghai, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, it is easy to access, making it an ideal school of choice for parents seeking an outstanding school in a safe, secure environment.\n\nThe School aims are: Communication, Engagement, Integration, Leadership, Resilience and Thinking. Students are encouraged to Challenge Yourself, Respect Others and Inspire Change.\n\nCampus\n\nThe 120 acre single campus is exceptional. The purpose-built, fully WiFi and ICT networked school facilities is located near the coast – a short drive from the capital city. Students can use the Arts Centre (725 seat auditorium, dance studio, black box theatre and rehearsal rooms), 27 science laboratories, extensive music faculty, art, design and technology and textile studios, libraries and traditional classrooms as well as the 2 swimming pools (50m and 25m), 3 large air-conditioned Sports Halls, outdoor netball/basketball and tennis courts and 3 soccer/rugby pitches. A well- equipped medical centre with 3 Nurses is on site to take care of students. . An award winning Outdoor Discovery Centre – an eco-forestry initiative on tropical heathland on the campus is regularly used for activities and also as an Outdoor Classroom learning space.\n\nBoarding facilities\n\nThe recently inspected and accredited ‘outstanding’ Boarding facilities for students age 11 years + are purpose designed and built for the community of boarders. 180 girls and boys presently enjoy separate Boarding Houses cared for by experienced staff. The Boarding Housemaster or Housemistresses are all teachers in the School. Boarders can also use the school facilities. A special partnership exists between the boarding staff and a student’s family with mutual trust at the heart of the relationship between home and school.\n\nPastoral Care\n\nAll students and teachers in the School are members of a House (a community of about 70 students) which plays a vital role in establishing and maintaining a strong school spirit and enabling leadership opportunities. The 16 Houses in Senior School, named after birds in Borneo, provide leadership, mentoring and teamwork opportunities. Weekly House sports competitions and other House Events including House Debates, House Music, JIS has Talent and Spelling Bees in addition to House social events are highlights.\n\nCo-curricular programme\n\nA strong co-curricular programme exists with almost 300 activities on offer including a wide range of sports and arts activities.

The School takes full advantage of the wonderful unique tropical environment of Brunei.\n\nFacts about Schools in Brunei\n\nThe school system in Brunei is relatively new, since formal schooling just started in the 20th century.\n\nThe first English school in Brunei was founded in 1931.\n\nThere are both private and government schools in Brunei. Although the national language is Malay, most of the private and government schools in Brunei are taught through the medium of English. So English is well spoken in Brunei.\n\nThe government and most private schools follow the same syllabus approved by the Ministry of Education. The School Year is January – December.\n\nThe International Schools follow a British International curriculum and school year (August – July).\n\nMost of the private and government schools study the Cambridge O Level at 16 years of age and then go to Sixth Form Colleges to study A Levels. Some Colleges now offer the UK BTECs and Diploma programmes.\n\nThe two largest International Schools are IB World Schools and offer the IB Diploma programme.\n\nWhy not contact us to find out more?
