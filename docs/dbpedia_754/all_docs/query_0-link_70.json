Application forms can be obtained from the school.\n\nMy School\n\nOver the course of evolution, Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB has been standing tall and attaining remarkable achievements for almost a century, aided by the capitalisation of the leading-edge technology. It was 87 years ago when our dedicated pioneers first sow the seeds of Chinese education on the land of Brunei and Chung Hwa Middle School, indebted to the wise leadership of His Majesty the Sultan of Brunei in providing a supportive milieu, has sprouted, grown and emerged as a iconic institution that promotes the rich heritage of Tiong Hwa community and preaches the much-treasured Tiong Hwa virtues from generations to generations.\n\nChung Hwa Middle School was bestowed with beaming pride during the gracious visit of His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah who consented to officiate the 80th Anniversary. Now, with the surging needs to keep pace with the latest educational reforms, the school vows to implement the avant-garde SPN 21 curriculum through the optimum utilisation of state-of-the-art facilities and up-to-date software. One noted example is the completion of Pehin Temenggong DatoLim Teck Hoo building in year 2008, considered to embody the school’s determination in moulding the future pillars of the society with the best resources available.\n\nAlthough Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB has the undeterred aim to ensure a perpetual enthusiasm in Mandarin and Tiong Hwa values amongst Tiong Hwa community and other races in Brunei, it never forgets its duty to place equal emphasis on cultivating moral value, knowledge, physical strength, appreciation of arts and team spirit into the students. For decades, Chung Hwa Middle School has been serving as the backbone of the society in producing well-rounded citizens who are trilingual and possess both academic & athletic competence.\n\nIn this era of vigorous technological advancement, Chung Hwa Middles School, BSB has always been gearing up to create innovative ways of integrating information and communication technology (ICT) into the curriculum and management. In retrospect, the management had been computerised and computer class for secondary students was pioneered at the school as early as the eighties. It was soon followed by the establishment of the school computer room in the nineties and the introduction of computer lessons from primary one in 1998.\n\nOver the years, in response to the directives from the Ministry of Education, the school’s ICT facilities have been substantially upgraded. Having begun the setting up of Chung Hwa Network in the library in 2002 and proudly emerging as the first school in Brunei to be linked by intranet, Chung Hwa presently has one of the most extensive educational websites in the country which incorporate all three languages, catering for parents and other educationists of different races.\n\nTo provide quality education to Tiong Hwa community in Brunei, Kapitan China Ong Boon Pang and few dignitaries, after much effort, established a school called York Choi School in 1918. The school had a humble start where it only rented a two-story shop lot as its classroom without a building of its own.\n\nIn 1922, the school was named Chung Hwa School and only 16 years later in 1938, the school made a major breakthrough with its own premises situated at Jalan Bendahara (approximately the vacant space of the current Parliament)\n\nIn 1940, Kapitan China Ong Boon Pang passed away peaceful after chairing the school board for 22 years and his great contribution in laying a solid foundation for the school is still remember and much appreciated.\n\nIn 1954, Lim Teck Hoo was elected as the new School Board.\n\nIn 1955, the school commenced its secondary level and changed its name to Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB.\n\nIn 1957, the government of Brunei subsidised the school and paid for the teachers’ salary, administration cost and the construction cost of the basic school facilities. Moreover, free lunch, and later changed into free beverage, was provided to fellow students from 1959 to 1969.\n\nIn 1959, a comprehensive learning curriculum was successfully implemented at the school with its upper secondary level introduced in 1959. The total student population surged, surpassing the 1000 benchmark.\n\nIn 1962, one two-storey building was completed with the financing from both government and donation from the community. In 1962, the school launched its kindergarten level.\n\nIn 1968, a stadium was in completion.\n\nIn 1970, the government withdrawing its financial support to the school fomented financial constraints in the Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB. The crisis was solved after the Tiong Hwa Community volunteered to support the school in a form of monthly donation and the kind benefaction provided by the philanthropic Kapitan China Awang Lim Teck Hoo and other board members.\n\nHow does CHMS look like??\n\nCHMS, BSB.\n\nThe Chung Hwa Middle School is a non-government, independent, public-funded Chinese school, established in 1922 by the Chinese community of Brunei. The school is the largest private school in Bandar Seri Begawan. It provides a trilingual (Chinese, English, and Malay) learning environment while adhering to the national education policy.\n\nThe school’s main financial resource is derived from student school fees, other fixed income as well as contributions and donations of the Chinese Community in the country. The twenty nine member Board of Directors form a panel of the highest authority in the school.\n\nThe three-block school building houses more than sixty classrooms, as well as science laboratories, kindergarten halls, a cooperative store, a canteen, music rooms, computer rooms, a conference room, a dental clinic, a multi media room and a cyber centre. The large Gymnasium cum Assembly Hall has a capacity of more than 2000 people, and is used for school assemblies, concerts, physical education classes, indoor sports and games. There is a 300-seat library with more than 40,000 books. Sporting fields include fields for soccer, volleyball, and basketball tournaments. There are also teacher and student residential quarters on campus.\n\nCHMS History Milestone\n\nTo provide quality education to Tiong Hwa community in Brunei, Kapitan China Ong Boon Pang and few dignitaries, after much effort, established a school called York Choi School in 1918. The school had a humble start where it only rented a two-story shop lot as its classroom without a building of its own. In 1922, the school was named Chung Hwa School and only 16 years later in 1938, the school made a major breakthrough with its own premises situated at Jalan Bendahara (approximately the vacant space of the current Parliament) In 1940, Kapitan China Ong Boon Pang passed away peacefully after chairing the school board for 22 years and his great contribution in laying a solid foundation for the school is still remember and much appreciated. In 1954, Lim Teck Hoo was elected as the new School Board. In 1955, the school commenced its secondary level and changed its name to Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB. In 1957, the government of Brunei subsidised the school and paid for the teachers’ salary, administration cost and the construction cost of the basic school facilities. Moreover, free lunch, and later changed into free beverage, was provided to fellow students from 1959 to 1969. In 1959, a comprehensive learning curriculum was successfully implemented at the school with its upper secondary level introduced in 1959. The total student population surged, surpassing the 1000 benchmark. In 1962, one two-storey building was completed with the financing from both government and donation from the community. In 1962, the school launched its kindergarten level. In 1968, a stadium was in completion. In 1970, the government withdrawing its financial support to the school fomented financial constraints in the Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB. The crisis was solved after the Tiong Hwa Community volunteered to support the school in a form of monthly donation and the kind benefaction provided by the philanthropic Kapitan China Awang Lim Teck Hoo and other board members. In 1971, the medium of instruction was changed to English for Upper Secondary Science Streams. In 1972, the school was honoured when Al-Marhum Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien Sa’adul Khairi Waddin consented to officiate the 50th school anniversary. At the same time, a four-storey building was completed to cater for the needs of its secondary students. In 1974, in line with the national policy, Friday was declared a weekend holiday. The school syllabus was adapted to echo the national syllabus where English and Bahasa Melayu were taught to primary students. After 1975, the medium of instruction of the school, except Mandarin, Bahasa Melayu, History, Music, Physical Education (PE), Arts and Moral, was aptly changed to English. In 1975, the school embraced teachers assigned by the government to teach Bahasa Melayu for primary level and their salary was shouldered by the government. In 1976, Chung Hwa students, instead of sitting for the internal exams set by the school, opt for GCE O’ Level.
