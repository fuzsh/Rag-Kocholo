This document provides an overview of the linguistic environment in Brunei and focuses on the role of Mandarin as the mother tongue for Chinese ethnic groups in Brunei. It discusses that while there are many Chinese dialects spoken, Mandarin serves as the common language of communication and is considered the mother tongue. It also examines a private Chinese medium school that uses Mandarin as the language of instruction to help Chinese children maintain their culture and mother tongue in a environment where English and Malay are dominant languages.",
