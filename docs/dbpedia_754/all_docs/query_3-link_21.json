        "text": "The Department of Modern Languages & Literaturesâ€™ rigorous, high-quality programs deeply rooted in our Jesuit values and in the principles of the liberal arts experience, offer students unique learning experiences both in and out of the classroom, which enrich their personal lives, help them discern a future career path, and prepare them to compete locally and globally for a wide variety of careers. Our faculty of professional language educators and scholars integrates the teaching of language and culture throughout our curricula in order to enable students to communicate effectively across cultures, appreciate cultural diversity, and to identify and analyze problems across cultural and national boundaries.\n\nStudents can major or minor in French and Francophone studies, Italian studies, and Spanish studies or minor in Japanese studies. Interdisciplinary minors blend language studies, especially Arabic, Chinese, or German, with other areas. (e.g. Arabic, Islamic & Middle Eastern Studies, Asian Studies, International Business minor) or an Individual Studies Major allows students to design their own path."
