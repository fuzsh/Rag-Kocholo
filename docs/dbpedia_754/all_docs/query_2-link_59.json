Some people said that Chinese schools are good in building characters, toughen them up.Some said private school encourage creative thinking etc. While Chinese school is good for characters building, we also want them to be proficient in English and able to share their thoughts. Care to share your experience and thoughts?",

Never heard of anyone getting caught smoking/ ponteng sekolah during my time there.\n\nYou don't mix that much with students of other races though and there's also this stigma of Chinese school students being memorizing machines with no thoughts.\n\nEDIT: not sure if you're asking about primary school or high school but I'm speaking from a high school POV.\n\nThis post has been edited by rexus: Jun 19 2021, 05:01 PM\n\nmj31382, SuperTuhan, and 4 others liked this post\n\nCasual\n\nJunior Member\n\n386 posts\n\nJoined: Feb 2018\n\nQUOTE(rexus @ Jun 19 2021, 04:59 PM)\n\nI'm from Chinese school so I can only offer my views from a Chinese school perspective.\n\nStudents only speak Chinese here (at least in my school), except for BM/English classes where the teachers insist on speaking in BM/English.\n\nEnglish among students are generally below average and those who do well normally come from English speaking family. Speaking English in school may be seen as an act of showing off for those who can't speak well.\n\nPlaying an active role in class/ co-curriculum activities will help your child in communicating and sharing their thoughts.\n\nDiscipline seems to be ok comparatively.

Only a few select elite schools do this. That's why people want to send their kids to elite schools\n\n1tanmee, adele123, and 2 others liked this post\n\nGetting Started\n\nJunior Member\n\n54 posts\n\nJoined: Jan 2003\n\nFrom: Neither here nor there\n\nQUOTE(kermit21 @ Jun 19 2021, 04:22 PM)\n\nHi all,\n\nWould like to get some advice from sifus here.\n\nWife and I are considering whether to send our children to Chinese or private school.\n\nSome people said that Chinese schools are good in building characters, toughen them up.\n\nSome said private school encourage creative thinking etc.\n\nWhile Chinese school is good for characters building, we also want them to be proficient in English and able to share their thoughts.\n\nCare to share your experience and thoughts?\n\nMy elder son has just completed his Year 11 at a private school in Putra Heights and my younger son is still studying at an SRJK in SS19. This is my experience and thoughts.\n\nSRJK\n\nThe focus of the school and its teachers are on academic achievement i.e UPSR results. Over 100 students were crammed into 2 year 6 'elite' classes to get good UPSR results so that the school maintains its high performance status. When you have such a large class, there is bound to be students who would be left behind. The teachers, however dedicated and well-meaning, just don't have the time to help all the students. PE periods are often replaced by exam subjects.\n\nThere is no time for students to develop their thinking and analytical skills as lessons are rushed and loads of homework follow. The only character that the student built is one that listen, memorise and follow. They will learn to be disciplined and be proficient in Chinese. The student would never be proficient in English just by following SRJK English syllabus.\n\nPrivate School\n\nThe school takes discipline, attendance and all-round education seriously. Parent-teacher conference is conducted twice a year and parents can contact teachers at any time. There might be a few problematic students but they keep their activities behind the authorities and didn't affect the rest. English, especially EFL, is much higher than during my SMK days. My son didn't take Chinese so I'm not sure about Chinese. Students are encouraged to participate, communicate and think, with evaluation from the class teacher every term. However, it would be too unrealistic to expect all students to be critical thinkers or excellent orators as it still depends on the person. Total cost including exams for 5 years = 180k.\n\nSJKC Vs Private primary\n\nI enrolled my younger son to the same SJKC because 1) Chinese and Mandarin 2) experience being busy and hardworking 3) the savings of 200k\n\nPrivate school or SJKC/Independent Chinese school is fine. SPM only as last resort.\n\nLook at all my stars!!\n\nSenior Member\n\n4,527 posts\n\nJoined: Mar 2012\n\nQUOTE(koja6049 @ Jun 19 2021, 05:16 PM)\n\nto be fair, most schools, chinese or not, do not train students in critical thinking.

Not even close.\n\nEven 'karen' type of students can demand things as they like.\n\nFor example, a student complained to the management that essay writing is difficult. Consequently, the head called the teacher to the office and instructed the teacher to stop giving out essay writing to the students. And mind you, those are IGCSE students.\n\nAnother issue was that there were several cases of students who came late. Parents were called to school to 'explain' to them that their child shouldn't come late to school. Parents don't bother even after they have been informed.\n\nThe only advantage is that your child will gain connections to those rich and the elites.\n\nLarryPizzaGuy liked this post"
