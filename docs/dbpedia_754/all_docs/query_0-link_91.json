        "text": "Students participating in the various games and activities designed by the students from the Department of Languages.\n\nHELP University’s Department of Languages recently organised the English Language Carnival at the Subang 2 campus on March 18, 2017. Over 132 students from the Chinese Independent Secondary Schools (CISS) across Malaysia participated in the event.\n\nThe objective of the Carnival was to promote creativity, teamwork, and confidence among students in the use of English Language through a wide range of stimulating and challenging activities outside the classroom context.\n\nThirty booths were set up by seventy volunteers, comprising students from the Bachelor of Education in TESL programme, who had created and developed the games and activities.\n\nThe participating students, who were divided into teams of five or six, were required to complete all the games which were set up at each booth. Two teams competed with one another at each booth at a time, and points collected from each game were tallied at the end of the day. Students were given six minutes at each booth to complete the required games before moving on to the next designated booth.\n\nAll of the games and activities had some aspect of encouraging the students to practice the English Language either through their sensory or communication skills with fellow team members. The students were tested in various elements that were infused with fun for the students.\n\nThe team which had collected the most points and emerged as the grand prize winner of the Carnival was Muar Chung Hwa High School, with Kwang Hua Private School and Chung Hua Middle School, Port Dickson, as the first and second runners-up respectively. Prizes were also given to the top eight teams with the highest points."
