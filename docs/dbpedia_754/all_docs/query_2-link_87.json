        "text": "Four SMSS students bagged silver and bronze awards in the Asia Pacific Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (APMOPS) for Academic Year 2018. Organised by Hwa Chong Institution, Singapore, APMOPS aims at generating greater interest in Mathematics among pupils in primary schools and sharpening their problem-solving skills.\n\nMathematics geniuses Chew Qian and Darrick Lee Jing Xian bagged the silver awards while Chloe Wee Yiin Ling and Darren Wong Chuan Lian obtained the bronze awards.\n\nThere was no easy and short way for the Maths wizards to reach that far. They had to undergo series of challenging trainings, provided by the Maths teachers. Such trainings were conducted to introduce them to important mathematical concepts, equipped them with major strategies for problem solving and develop their mathematical flexibility in solving problems before they were sent to compete in the first round in April 2018 at Chung Hwa Middle School, Bandar Seri Begawan. Soon after first round of the competition, the scripts of the awardees together with the rest of the eligible participants from various Asia Pacific countries were sent to Singapore for the invitation round.\n\nThe silver and bronze awards obtained do not only speak about winning in the competition but also proving that Seri Mulia Sarjana School sparks a great endeavour in the international educational spectrum.\n\nCongratulations to the four awardees and their mentors for a job very well done!"
