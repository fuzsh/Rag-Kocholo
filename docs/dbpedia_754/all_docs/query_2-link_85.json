This language is called 'Atayal', Tai4ya3yu3 .u\\&;y in Chinese. It is an Austronesian language, like all the other aborigine languages of Taiwan. Atayal is spoken over a large area of northern and eastern Taiwan. Some scholars speculate that Taiwan is the homeland of all Austronesian languages, since you find the greatest diversity from branch to branch among Taiwan's aboriginal languages, more than you find between other Austronesian languages. Maori, the aboriginal language of New Zealand, is also an Austronesian language, though it belongs to the 'Eastern Malayo-Polynesian' branch, while Atayal is classified as a 'Formosan' language. You mention different varieties of Atayal. In fact there are quite a few different dialects. The two main dialects are Atayal and Sediq. Scholar Paul Jen-kuei Li ('u%t,Q Li3 Ren2 gui3) of the Academia Sinica lists three subdialects for Sediq and 11 subdialects in two subgroups for Atayal. There are many works on Atayal. You might start with Der-Hwa Victoria Raw's _A Grammar of Atayal_, available from Crane Books in Taipei. Check the bibliography of this work for many other sources on Atayal. Or just go to any good university library and do a search under 'Atayal'. There are also teaching materials for Atayal and other Formosan languages; Atayal is taught, for example, at Wulai Middle School just outside Taipei with materials compiled by local governments and other agencies. Various missionary groups have also compiled materials in Atayal.
