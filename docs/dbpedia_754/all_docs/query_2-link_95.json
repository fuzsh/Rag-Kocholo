        "text": "Cathy Yi was born in 1950 in Gyeonggi Province, Korea, just outside of Seoul. At a young age, she moved with her family to Seoul, where she received her primary and secondary education; after graduating from high school, she moved to the United States to live with some of her relatives who had already immigrated to the country. She had heard stories of discriminatory attitudes towards minorities while living in Korea and was disheartened to experience such attitudes for herself in places as unassuming as the local grocery market, but was nevertheless resolved to make a better life for herself in spite of the racism she encountered. When she was 27 years old, she married and moved to New York where she and her husband lived for five years before moving to New Jersey to be closer to her business, which was located in Philadelphia. In 1986, she moved to Los Angeles where she and her family got by comfortable while working in wholesale, though a change in fortune would later cause her to close the business. Today, from retirement, Cathy appreciates how she was able to acclimate to an American way of life early on, recognizing that although there exists cultural differences between the Korea she remembers and the America she’d immigrate to, the choices we make as individuals are not predetermined by the society we live in.\n\nJustine Yoon was born in Los Angeles to immigrant parents. She grew up to the north of Koreatown in Los Feliz, and describes her childhood as having been lively and active: from a young age, her parents put her and her older siblings through a variety of local leagues, sports, and extracurriculars, in part so that they might grow up immersed within American culture. Her parents were active within the Korean community as well: her father operated a private practice in Koreatown, and after his retirement ventured into the restaurant business with her mother which they’ve continued to this day. Justine would often work in her parents’ restaurants, whether it was by peeling and cleaning vegetables or going out into the markets to secure the best deals on wholesale ingredients. Today, she has taken a smaller role at her parents’ restaurants to pursue her own passions, something which exemplifies a larger internal struggle that children of immigrants must personally and uniquely reckon with: how we might actualize our own dreams—which our parents worked tirelessly for—while also honoring the sacrifices that went into creating opportunities for the next generation.\n\nAileen Kim was born in Yanji, Jilin Province, China, in 1972, and she is a third-generation Korean Chinese: her grandmother sought refuge in China during the Japanese occupation, and her parents were born in Manchuria. She talks about having a relatively middle-class upbringing, with both parents both working as public servants, as well as attending Yanbian University of Science and Technology, where she studied English. After graduation, she worked for the school’s human resources team—her fluency across languages and cultures meant that she could work in translation and in cultural introductions with visiting students and scholars. Her husband was one such visiting student, and after the two married they lived in Ulsan, Korea, for six years, where Aileen worked as a Chinese instructor. While pregnant with their second child, the family moved to Los Angeles for Aileen’s husband’s career. Through Radio Korea, she later found work in a restaurant whose owner was also Korean Chinese; here, too, her fluency in Chinese, Korean, and English proved useful in working the front of house. Although she wasn’t aware of it at first, she came to find a sizable Korean Chinese community in Los Angeles, and takes pride in her identity. She relates to her children in understanding what it’s like to grow up Korean in a non-Korean-majority environment, and just as she held onto her heritage through the Korean language, she hopes for her children to continue using it as well.\n\nLaura Park is a hanbok business owner based in Los Angeles. She was born in 1964 to a family that operated a textile store in Gwangjang Market in Seoul and recounted a comfortable childhood containing memories of time spent at her parent’s store. She explains how the store had been in operation since before she was born: her mother had begun working in the market when she was 18, and by the time Laura came around, she was running a textile business that had become woven into the fabric of Gwangjang. Laura initially expressed an interest in languages and so worked as a translator for diplomatic correspondences between Korea and Japan ahead of the 1988 Olympics, but realized that her true passions lay in business; with the money earned from working as a translator, she moved to Los Angeles, where her uncle lived. Following in the footsteps of her parents, she opened a hanbok store which she called “Lee Hwa Korean Traditional Dress;” before long, she was selling wedding dresses as well, and so renamed the store to “Lee Hwa Wedding and Korean Traditional Dress.” As more and more non-Koreans became familiar with what a hanbok was, she renamed her store to “Lee Hwa Wedding and Hanbok,” a final DBA change that reflected shifting attitudes toward Korean culture in the United States. Today, most of her customers are non-Korean—compared to her clientele being 90% Korean when she first began her business—and her store caters to three styles of hanbok: traditional attire, modernized, and streetwear.\n\nKyungbin Min is a chef based in Los Angeles. He was born in Seoul, Korea, and immigrated with his family to SoCal where his aunt lived. He knew from an early age that his calling was in food service: as a child, he grew to love the instant gratification of being a part of dinner service, even if it it meant simply setting up plates at the table (even today, he says that it’s his customers’ positive reviews that “gives him the pump” to keep on going). He worked in restaurants right out of college, and after saving enough money paid his way through culinary school, after which he worked in a variety of kitchens, from fine dining to upscale casual. Though he enjoyed his time in culinary school, he says that it wasn’t necessary for him; the food he creates today, he says, is a mashup of what he learned in the kitchens with his own added flair. During the onset of the pandemic, he and his partners were furloughed, and so they set about starting their own food businesses: one of his partners started a meal prep company, while he and another partner together launched a dry aging meat company; everything, he says, was ecommerce. Soon, he opened “Hanchic,” which to his surprise was picked up by outlets such as Eater, Thrillist, and The Infatuation: what began as an ecommerce business soon turned into an outdoor patio, which then transitioned indoors. He owes the success of his enterprises to his community, which he tries to serve by introducing Korean flavors beyond the typical kbbq or kimbap that many are already familiar with. In acting as a middleman of sorts, he hopes more people will become comfortable ordering food from the “OG mom and pop” restaurants in L.A.’s Koreatown.\n\nEsther Kang is a researcher, educator, and Professor of Design Studies at the University of Wisconsin. As both a child and adult she moved often, experiencing life across a diverse range of cities spanning from Los Angeles and San Francisco, to Dallas and New York, and abroad in Perth, Australia, and Durbin, South Africa. Having lived in Los Angeles the longest and throughout her formative years, she considers the city to be her hometown; her family moved to L.A. in January of 1992, just months before the L.A. Uprising in April. Kang recounts how Saigu was a catalyst in her family’s discussions about race, the idea of which stuck with her as the family moved around the country: while attending school in Dallas, she was one of only two Asians students in the entire student body. As a researcher and educator today, Kang’s work centers on the political, cultural and social implications of Design, incorporating the recognition that design is more than just a means of communication, and that in many ways, the process of design itself is the product as well. She continues to ask what an equitable design process looks like, and what ethical design ethos is, questions she compels us to think about with critical and sensitive understandings of their consequences.\n\nSammy Kim (they/them) is a multifaceted individual: a queer artist, writer, healer, sex worker, community organizer, caregiver, and friend. From a young age, Sammy took on a caregiving role when their mother was diagnosed with Parkinson’s, moving in with relatives as her condition progressed. Seeing their mother struggle with her health, Sammy naturally came into a role of caregiving, grounding themselves in gratitude while extending empathy towards their family. By their pre-teen years, Sammy knew they were queer but felt compelled to hide it due to their Christian upbringing, even trying to “ungay” themselves to avoid eternal damnation. Operating out of fear, Sammy didn’t come out to their parents until their mother approached them about it, by which time they had been living openly for three years. Although their mother struggled to accept this part of Sammy, she affirmed her love, signaling a need for more time to understand.\n\nThrough sex work, what began as a caregiving role to provide for men seeking to feel wanted eventually evolved into a way for Sammy to heal from their early childhood trauma of sexual abuse. Their work became a way for them to deeply question their relationship to the sexualization tied to their identities. As Sammy continues to unravel the many intersections of their experiences, they choose with intention to feel alive in the present, living in the joy that stems from simply being themselves without distraction.\n\nAndrea Hong Marra (she/her), often known as Andy, is a trans activist and executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund (TLDEF). From an early age, she knew who she was as a Korean American and person of color. Adopted into a white family and growing up in a diverse neighborhood, she was raised to be in touch with her Korean heritage. However, there were fewer resources available about being transgender, leading to a journey of helping her parents understand and accept her queer identity.\n\nWith a commitment to service and leadership instilled by her parents, Andy began volunteering at LGBTQ organizations in her hometown. She realized that a life of service and advocacy was her calling, a path she’s dedicated herself to for the past couple of decades. Andy reminds us that activists often prioritize their work over themselves, but the spaces they create are for them too. She encourages us to leave behind our stories so that those who come after know they are not alone, asserting that leaving evidence of our existence is a powerful act of defiance.\n\nYoon (they/them) is a trans/non-binary filmmaker and organizer raised by communities in and around New Jersey and New York. Growing up in a family of mixed classes and statuses, they were exposed to a diversity of identities early on. It was through a class-based understanding of identity that Yoon mediated other modes of identity, such as queerness and love. Acknowledging the beauty of romantic love and romantic queer love, they describe their formative experiences as being shaped by community, spirituality, and family. Yoon soon began to understand that love could also be a collective force. In their own words, queerness is how someone builds relationships outside of what the “norm” may be; queer people are anyone who chooses to live outside a nuclear family, “having the liberation to be with whoever is best for you.”\n\nMudang Sung Park (he/him) was born in Seoul, Korea, and immigrated to the Ridgewood/Bushwick area with his family when he was young. Growing up, they were the only Korean family—or East Asian family, for that matter—for blocks around, and although Sung tried his best to reproduce the joys of his Korean childhood from within New York, his new environment slowly changed aspects of his personality. Encountering racism as a child, he became withdrawn, and was disappointed that the racism followed him into college, where he was battered with microaggressions ranging from compliments to his English, to students touching his soft hair.\n\nSung always knew that he was born in the wrong body, but being “queer” was something he attributed to whiteness. And there was another complication to his gender: like many Korean Americans, Sung grew up in the church, and came from a family of ministers. After college, he went to seminary, where he obtained a divinity degree, and was under care at a church to be ordained when his father suddenly passed. He wanted to honor him, but because his family had stopped practicing traditional rites long ago, didn’t know how to, and left ministry, having grown resentful of the ways in which the church prohibited indigenous practices in Korea. Wanting to relearn the practices of his spiritual heritage, he sought out a mudang to mentor him in musok, and was surprised to learn that he came from a lineage of not only ministers, but mudangs as well. He doesn’t know of other trans men who are mudang, and isn’t sure if there’s a significance to his gender and his spirituality, but he feels that there must be one, as coming into the musok tradition has felt like a second homecoming into the queer Korean American community.\n\nVanilla Honey (she/they) is a queer architect and community organizer based in New York. Growing up on Long Island, Honey was never taught Korean by their mother, but they connected with their family and other Koreans through humor and playfulness. Being biracial, Honey often felt out of place in certain spaces, but discovering their queer identity brought a familiar fluidity between their experiences with race and gender.\n\nQueerness has been, and continues to be, a bridge connecting them to the larger Korean American community. Partnering with friends and other queer Koreans, they helped bring KQTx(@kqtxnetwork @kqtxnyc)—a national grassroots network aimed at uplifting Queer and Trans people of Korean descent—to New York City. Queer joy, for Honey, is a mix of warmth, smiles, and a sense of safety surrounded by loved ones. They remind us: “You’re not alone. Support is out there; you don’t have to rely on yourself.”\n\nAlexander Chee (he/him) is a bestselling author, essayist, and Professor of English and Creative Writing at Dartmouth College. Born in South Kingstown, Rhode Island, to a white American mother and Korean father, Chee’s journey is a tale woven with humor and wit. Describing his childhood self as a “financial crisis” due to being unplanned, he moved around the Pacific with his family’s fisheries business before settling in Maine, where he encountered racism from his peers.\n\nIt wasn’t until he moved to San Francisco in 1989 that he found a community. There, he not only met another gay Asian man for the first time, but also others who shared his mixed-race background. However, he was surprised to discover that even within this vibrant community, there were divisions; some gay bars excluded women, while others historically excluded Asian men.\n\nThrough his experiences, Chee emphasizes that political work extends beyond demonstrations and policy-making. It’s also about finding joy and connection in everyday moments like “going out dancing with friends, jumping on a stage for a favorite song, or just being goofy.” His journey underscores the importance of finding spaces where you belong, even within the complexities of identity and community.\n\nSulkiro Song (she/they) is a queer, asexual, and aromantic pastor based in Virginia. Born in Seoul, Korea, to a family of ministers, their path seemed clear: carry on the family line and become a pastor. However, at age five, their grandfather declared, “women cannot be pastors!”—their first encounter with gender discrimination in ministry. Struggling to identify with the word “queer” and navigating their sexuality, Sulkiro felt misunderstood and out of place. They knew they were asexual since middle school but were often teased by peers. It wasn’t until much later, during a pride march, that they encountered the ace flag and finally felt like they belonged.\n\nDespite the initial discouragement, Sulkiro attended seminary, not just to study religion academically, but also to help themselves through deep religious trauma—a process they describe as “ridiculously expensive therapy.” Although they didn’t take courses in preaching or pastoral care, they felt comfortable sharing what they were learning in seminary with their congregation. Today, serving as the pastor of HAN UMC, Sulkiro’s sermons encompass queer, feminist, and anti-imperialist themes, reflecting their commitment to inclusivity and justice.\n\nEmmett Yoon (he/him) is a trans rights activist based in Houston, serving as the Executive Director of the Transgender Education Network of Texas (TENT). Born in South Korea and adopted by a white family in the Midwest, Emmett often felt out of place and confused as a transracial adoptee. His mother reminded him that both he and the world were more expansive than he realized, instilling in him a strong sense of social responsibility and community through volunteering. As an adult living in San Antonio, Emmett noticed the lack of support and the targeted attacks toward the trans community. This compelled him to take action and start volunteering, eventually leading him to become the Executive Director of TENT in 2017. Faced with the absence of trans infrastructure in Texas and drawing on his unique experiences, Emmett continues to expand trans-focused educational policy, legislation, and community resources. It’s an enormous task, but he remains grounded by the family he has built and his belief in the inherent goodness of humanity. Emmett hopes that by creating inclusive spaces, the trans community can find their own strength to protect their joy and for the greater community to see each other in fullness to work collectively for a better future.\n\nEllie Kim (she/her), known as SuperKnova (@superknova), is a genderfluid trans singer and musician based in NYC. Her relationship with music began early when her parents—like many Korean parents—enrolled her in piano lessons as a child. She hated it. It wasn’t until she picked up her first guitar that she fell in love with music and started dreaming of becoming a musician. Due to the lack of Asian American musicians in the mainstream—and even fewer queer Asian American musicians—Ellie didn’t think being a musician was a possibility, so she chose the “safe route” and pursued medical school. Ellie completed school and earned a medical degree, but she is not a doctor. She is now living life fully as both Ellie and SuperKnova. Music became the vehicle for her to process emotions and her queer identity, as well as to find a community that embraces her for who she is. So what’s her advice for the next generation? “Don’t listen to me! I’m just excited for Gen Z and Gen A to come up with their ideas and make the world better.”\n\nQueer and trans stories often go unheard within the Korean American community. By creating space and sharing these narratives, we can build bridges, learn from one another, and celebrate the diversity within our ever-evolving community. Last year, our team had the honor of interviewing nine incredible LGBTQIA+ Korean Americans across generations. In the coming weeks, we are excited to share a special edition of the Legacy Project: “Legacy Project: Queer Joy,” where we explore what queer joy means to them and their journey to finding it. A big thank you to our interviewees for being so open and allowing us to share your stories with our community and beyond 🩷\n\nFunding for this project was made possible by Korean American Community Foundation @kacfny with support from the Reva and David Logan Foundation @revaanddavidloganfoundation\n\nChung Soon Ahn was born in Pyongyang, North Korea, before the outbreak of the Korean war. She lived comfortably next to the Taedong River until her father’s friend informed them that they should move to the South, as the family was at risk of being targeted by a government purge. In 1948, the entire family relocated to Seoul, where Chung Soon was enrolled in school. During the war her family left Seoul, but returned after it ended. Chung Soon, now a university student, returned to school, and upon graduation found work at the YWCA. While working she met her husband, with whom she moved to Japan, following his career. Though her husband’s company wanted to relocate him to an American office in Atlanta, Chung Soon suggested that they move to D.C. instead, and in 1964 she and her husband moved to the United States, where her husband found a new job as an engineer and she as an airline interpreter. Looking back on her life, she remembers fondly the comforts of her childhood in North Korea, but is above all grateful for both the opportunities and the struggles which pushed her to start a new life in America as well.\n\nAnthony Hull was born in Mount Holly, New Jersey, to a Korean mother and a Black father who worked as an army mechanic. As a child, he remembers growing up in a relatively diverse community with friends who were Asian, or had Asian parents; it was in the fourth grade, when he befriended a transfer student from Korea, that Anthony began to feel a sense of pride and solidarity in his own Korean identity. In college, he remembers struggling to “half” identify with his dual heritage, feeling alienated from in-groups who didn’t see him “Black enough” or “Korean enough:” then and today, he feels that he is both 100% Black and 100% Korean. Following graduation, Anthony moved to New York to pursue a career in acting and filmmaking, where he now has his own production company to tell the stories he’s always wanted to share.\n\nJennifer Lee, 24, recounts her journey from Seoul, Korea, to North Bethesda, Maryland, where she now resides after immigrating to the United States with her mother and brother. She speaks about what it was like to be raised by a resilient mother who worked to provide for her young family in a new country and reflects on the love, support, and sympathy extended to her following the loss of her father at a young age. She talks about navigating college and career aspirations while switching from pre-health to computer science, where she found an interest in Human-Computer Interaction. Although initially conflicted on whether to pursue UX research and design, as this would mean more schooling rather than directly entering the workforce, her mother encouraged her to follow her passions instead of feeling burdened by the impossible weight of giving back to her family. She says that if she could give her younger self any advice, it would be to have confidence in yourself and what you do, because no matter how you feel toward yourself, there will always be those around willing to show you love and care.\n\nMatthias Chu, 25, was born and raised in Maryland. His story is one that resonates with many Korean American young adults, with the stresses and pressures of school and adulthood on his mind while also being of the age where he’s coming into his own identity. Part of this journey, he explains, has been navigating through his relationship with Christianity and the church, from interacting with students who attend church to having difficult conversations with his parents about his faith. Another part of the journey has been learning to navigate stress productively while not getting hung up on overthinking. Matthias talks about the guilt he feels from the difference in faith with his parents, as well as dropping out from college and working for two years; in both cases, he explains that he feels bad knowing what his parents want him to be, versus how he sees himself. Nonetheless, he feels grateful that as he grows older, his relationship with his parents has improved and that talking to them has become easier—despite the personal hardships and challenges that come with maturing as an adult, Matthias’ relationship with his family has always taken precedence.\n\nJacky Lee was born in Incheon, South Korea, in 1957. She recounts her early childhood memories living in Korea with her mother and younger sister, recollecting in vivid detail specific moments spent with family while noting that many of those earliest memories are becoming harder and harder to remember. When Jacky was five years old, she and her younger sister were adopted by an American couple who were stationed in Japan while serving in the Air Force. Though living in Japan presented its own set of challenges—she had to learn a new language, for one—Jacky describes feeling a particular bond with her adoptive mother owing to their skin color, and overall recollects her time in Japan fondly. After the family’s period of service was over, they relocated to California where her parents started a church; it was in America that Jacky felt for the first time a conflict in identity, where she was bullied by the other children at church for her appearance. Resentful that her parents were unwilling to talk about her past in Korea and her biracial heritage, Jacky talks about the confusion and shame that accompanied questions she had for herself. In her thirties, however, while visiting a Korean beauty supply store, a worker recognized her as being Korean; for the first time in her life, she felt able to slowly reclaim bits of her Korean identity. In 2014 she visited Korea with a group of other biracial Koreans, where she rediscovered a love for the land of her birth mother. Jacky went back to Korea in 2017 to nurture this connection, and ever since she’s identified herself as Korean, Black, and proud.\n\nGrace Lyo was born in 1946 in Gyeonggi Province, Korea. While attending elementary school, she moved in with relatives in Seoul, and after completing high school found work first as a government employee of the Treasury Department, then in the actuarial industry where she met her childrens’ father. In 1981, Grace immigrated to Baltimore with her family, which by then included young children. Opening up a store nearby, Grace and her husband worked to sustain their new lives in the U.S. Grace, who had always wanted to pursue higher education, enrolled in the local community college; her husband, who was against the idea, demanded she quit school. The couple separated and sold the store, which allowed Grace to open a new business, starting anew. Soon after, she opened a second store, and then another: at one point, she was running three businesses alone, one of which she gave to her brother when he too immigrated to the area. In 2015, during the Baltimore Protests, one of her stores suffered an arson attack which led to its permanent closure. Despite this setback, Grace talks about all the love that local residents have given her and her businesses throughout the years she’s lived in Baltimore, and how she herself harbors nothing but gratitude and a desire to give back to her community and its youth.\n\nDr. Chun-Kyu Lee was born in 1928 in Jeollanam-do, South Korea, and experienced the hardships of WWII during 8th grade when he was forced into labor instead of schooling to support the Japanese army. Following Japan’s surrender in 1945, Dr. Lee returned to academic life, only to face the outbreak of the Korean War shortly after starting college in Seoul. This led him to transfer to medical school, where he trained as a doctor to aid war efforts, later extending his medical expertise to Uganda during a doctor shortage. In 1972, Dr. Lee moved to the United States to pursue further training in psychiatry, working extensively in Korea, Uganda, and later in Cleveland, Ohio, despite language barriers. After retiring, he settled in Maryland, cherishing the proximity to his family as the happiest period of his life, reflecting a journey marked by resilience and dedication to serving others across continents.\n\nMilton Washington, now residing in Harlem, New York, carries a poignant story of resilience and identity, starting with his early life in South Korea. Born to a Korean mother who worked in South Korean military camptowns, Milton faced rejection not only for being mixed Black and Korean but for being the child of only one parent. The rejection forced the mother and son to move from their village near Incheon to Dongducheon. Years later, Milton was eight years old and found himself living at an adoption agency after his mother could no longer take care of him. One day, a car pulled up, and a Black family from America stepped out to adopt another child. Milton ran into the vehicle belonging to the family and refused to leave. Feeling an instant connection, this family adopted Milton. As an adult, Milton reflects on the geopolitical forces that impacted his mother’s life and other people’s heartbreaking and inspiring stories to persist and live.\n\nJim Lee, 61-years old and born in Namsan, South Korea, shares a story firmly rooted in his dedication to family, a story which begins in college when a mutual friend set him up on a blind date with Celeste, his future wife. Coming from two very different backgrounds, Lee was initially unsure of Celeste’s feelings, but their shared values and deep connection proved that the pair would make for a formidable couple grounded in each other as they navigated through life’s joys and hardships. A significant challenge arose with their son, Matthew, who faced health challenges from birth yet overcame them through the family’s perseverance and optimism in sourcing him the support he needed to thrive; today, Matthew leads a vibrant life, having proved those skeptical of his health wrong. Kim recounts how their daughter, inspired by Celeste’s compassion and dedication to Matthew’s well-being, would pursue a career in speech pathology, working as an advocate for children with special needs. Lee emphasizes the importance of giving back, the day-to-day gratitude, and the lasting peace he’s found in family life as he tells his narrative, encapsulating the resilience and enduring love of a Korean American family marked by struggle and triumph.\n\nPaul Kim was born in Seoul and immigrated to the United States in 1996. His family settled in St. Paul, Minnesota, fulfilling his father’s dream of moving to America. When Paul entered middle school, the family moved from St. Paul to the surrounding suburbs, which Paul recounts as having much better schools than the city, albeit being much less diverse than the city itself. Education was of utmost importance in the Kim family, and Paul chased what he believed was, at the time, the natural pipeline that was getting good grades, getting into college, and landing a high-paying job. Paul graduated from university convinced he wanted to become a businessman, so he moved to Chicago to work as a trader. After two years in Chicago, he relocated to Portland, where he worked as the only Asian worker at his workplace, to trade grain with Asia. While in Oregon, he received an offer from a different firm in Chicago, but it wasn’t until after he moved back to the Midwest that he learned his offer had been reneged. He eventually found work again as a trader but was compelled through his faith to find a higher calling in philanthropy. In partnership with a church in South Korea, Paul leveraged the skills he’d gained in industry to buy grain and ship it to North Korea, over time expanding the type and scale of the humanitarian efforts he found himself involved in.\n\nJinwoo Chung was born Montgomery County, Maryland, to parents who immigrated to the Rockville area from Korea. Holding a strong conviction to help others, Jinwoo studied psychology in college and eventually found work as a case manager and counselor for a boys group home. He recounts how, in forging relationships with youth who had experienced deep familial trauma, his perspective on family-building was deeply impacted. After navigating the emotional journey of fertility treatments with his wife, the family began to look into the process of adoption, a decision spurred by the couple’s unwavering belief in the power of familial love, irrespective of biological ties. When they matched with a birth mother through an adoption agency in Maryland, Jinwoo describes feeling initial anxiety about how his community would receive the family’s adoption of a child who would not present as Korean, but that this fear was quickly dispelled. He recognizes the fears and doubts that come with parenthood, especially through adoption, yet remains steadfast in his belief that every child deserves to be known and loved, through it all guided by his devotion to faith and family.\n\nMichael Jhin was born in Hong Kong in 1950 to a Chinese mother and a Korean father. His early years were marked by his father’s harrowing experiences in the Korean War, including being captured by the Chinese army and a daring escape back to Hong Kong, where his mother supported the family with her dress shops. Moving to the US in 1958, Michael faced the challenges of settling in a rough Brooklyn neighborhood. Later in his adulthood, his ambitions led him to become the youngest CEO of a university hospital, a role in which he embraced his identity not just as a blend of Chinese and Korean heritage but as a proficient CEO committed to utilizing community resources for the betterment of others. For Michael, who has lived in Houston for the past 33 years with his wife Susan and their three children, professional achievement defines his identity, showcasing how individual success can transcend cultural boundaries.\n\nBorn in Hongcheong-un of the Gangwon province, Dae Duck Cha was forced to flee to Seoul at age 6 due to the Korean War. His father led a March First Demonstration in 1919 in his hometown and this passion of his was handed down directly to Cha. Growing up amidst the war was rough for Cha, he had a hard time keeping up with academics due to frequently moving around and living with his older sisters. Through this period, drawing became his solace, leading him to pursue art at Hongik University and eventually join the Peace Corps as an artist which brought him to the United States. He continued to go through many more changes and relocations in his life until eventually settling in Houston. Recognition and fame within the Houston Korean Community came slowly, with his artworks showcased in galleries of others and also his own. Cha’s story reminds us of the importance of being passionate and pursuing our dreams no matter what comes our way.\n\nDr. Sam Jae Cho was born in Seoul in 1949, just a year before the War broke out. When he was just a year old, his family fled to Daegu, where he resided until he returned to Seoul to study at university. He details the trajectory of his academic career, starting as an undergraduate at SNU studying Mineral and Petroleum Engineering, to completing a PhD at UT Austin after receiving a government scholarship. After finishing his studies, Dr. Cho sought to return to Korea but upon feeling that the position he was offered wasn’t a right fit, he made the critical decision to remain in the United States choosing instead to work at energy companies where the efforts of his dissertation could be better realized. Even still, wanting to contribute to the advancements in energy technology for his home country, Dr. Cho worked at creating an organization which would provide a platform for Korean students studying energy sciences in Texas to come together, share discourse, and propose emerging technologies in energy management to their home. In his golden years, Dr. Cho remains steadfast in his conviction that we can inch toward a better future through scholarship.\n\nBark Bo Moon was born in Seoul in January 1945, just before the Korean War. He reminisces on his journey during the war to finding refuge in Masan-si alongside his family and being faced with much violence and hardship. Airplanes that flew above them would shoot down and have to protect themselves, but the family still spread warmth to one another. After the War, he went back to school and focused on his academics, especially English. Time passes and he joins the Korean Army and experiences the Vietnam War. He highlights how during his service he was able to use his English to help his peers connect. After moving to America, he was faced with a lack of job opportunities until one day he accepted an offer to enlist in the US Army after a recruiter visited the local church he was attending. After more changes in his life in homes and occupations, he now is retired but still lives with a drive to help others for the greater good. He emphasizes that his goal in life is to give smiles and spread kindness, and warm gestures.\n\nDavid Lee’s journey from a troubled upbringing in LA, marked by his mother’s bipolar disorder and abusive behavior, to finding solace and a new beginning is a testament to resilience and the search for identity. Raised in a devoutly Christian, Korean American household, he faced intensified challenges after his siblings left and his mother was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer, bearing the brunt of her abuse while serving as her caregiver. Recognizing education as his escape, David excelled academically, earning a scholarship to Georgetown University and leaving his difficult past behind. There, he formed a life-changing friendship with Kelly, whose family eventually adopted him, offering the love and stability he didn’t have growing up. This act of adoption not only provided David with a new family but also helped him to start healing from his past traumas. Embracing his complex identity as Korean, LGBT, and adoptee, David’s story is a powerful narrative of overcoming adversity through the support of his chosen family and the strength of the human spirit.\n\nFrom the straw-thatched house of her childhood in Jeolla-nam-do, South Korea, to the bustling streets of Houston, Texas, Terry Sa Yoon’s life has been a testament to resilience and service. Arriving in the United States in 1970, her family was immediately thrown into harrowing circumstances following a parental health scare. Terry’s journey embodies the strength that one must grow into while transitioning to life in a new country, but also the grace of others which help us out of difficult times. Through the kindness of strangers and the support of her community, she found her calling in helping others and today works as a dedicated service coordinator at the non-profit Woori Juntos, paying it forward to make tangible differences in the lives of those in need.\n\nJason Cho was born and raised in Houston, Texas, in the Aleaf area. His father owned a Taekwondo School business and was the first to do so in the 70s in their respective area. All his life he trained in Taekwondo at the Dojang which helped him develop strong qualities that show in his leadership. Jason’s introduction to the hospitality industry is owed to his sister and his love for food. While visiting his sister in New York, he tried Korean Fried Chicken for the first time and decided to bring it into Houston after realizing that he would be the first one to do so. It was an all-in situation for Jason and he persevered through his journey through the lessons he learned with Taekwondo. Discipline, structure, leading by example, and being a man of action are only some of what he learned. Jason now aspires to be a representation of Korean concepts in Houston through his restaurant Dak & Bop and carry on his father’s dream of buying land and building a community by creating a Koreatown in his city in the future.\n\nJoseph Yoo was born in Korea and immigrated to California with his parents when he was 6. Coming from a family of ministers, Joseph recounts grappling with the expectations to follow in his father’s pastoral footsteps, which he initially resisted before discovering his own personal calling to serve the church. As an adult, he describes family life with his wife and son, underscoring the challenges of embracing unconventional paths. He finds inspiration in their son’s remarkable ability to find joy in life’s simplest pleasures and reflects on the connection between joy and holiness.

Originally an Estee Lauder staff member in Korea, she could have chosen to be transferred to another job in the US. Despite this, she decided to follow a sudden urge to open a Korean restaurant, going against the opposition from her sisters. Owning a restaurant was not easy, as she was met with constant work and rough times. But a newfound faith in Christianity and a strong trust in her employees helped her persevere; the work never overwhelmed or scared her. Her 24/7 work days turned into 20 years in the blink of an eye and her once 9-item long menu at the very first opening grew to 85 when they closed down. After closing her restaurant, she started a catering business which she believes is her calling: “making food honestly and in turn making her proud of what she makes.” Her son now follows in her footsteps and also has a food business of his own, in which Oh helps make kimchi. Meeting God and peace led her to feel constant happiness, which her sons could see radiating from her.\n\nAndrew Ungal Kim takes us on a poignant journey from his early years in Gyeonggi-do, Anyang-si, Korea, where childhood was spent playing soccer and badminton with neighborhood friends. Moving to a town just outside of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, at age 14, Andrew was initially enthralled by the American dream but soon confronted the reality of adapting to a new country with a different culture and language. As he navigated this challenging period, Andrew grappled with both his station as a new immigrant to the country, as well as a self-reckoning with his own sexuality. Raised in a Christian environment, he initially tried to suppress his feelings through prayer, hoping they would eventually fade away. However, at 27, he met someone in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and fell in love, forcing him to accept his true self.\n\nAndrew’s journey also reflects the complexities of being open about his sexuality. While he had a nine-year relationship, he struggled to reveal it to his own side of the family and friends, causing a sense of isolation. Eventually his mother discovered the truth, challenging their relationship. Through it all, Andrew is grateful for the acceptance he found in some corners of his community (including some members of his congregation), emphasizing the ongoing process of self-discovery and the importance of understanding and embracing one’s true identity.\n\nBorn and raised in West Point, Utah, Tiffany grew up in a family which was rather distinct from those of her peers. As a biracial woman whose mother was Korean and father was Black, she expresses an overwhelming sense of feeling “different” in an environment which was predominantly of one race and religion. Yet Tiffany relishes in memories of her “very Korean” household, growing up with Korean food and observing Korean traditions, which she owes to her mother.\n\nIn high school, Tiffany joined the school newspaper; while in university, she continued to engage with student journalism while studying mass communication. Over the pandemic, she covered a story about local Koreans in Houston sewing masks community members, an experience that she considers pivotal in feeling accepted by the Korean community. Today, she lives in San Francisco working as an award-winning journalist, a career she values for its capacity to help those in need, bring light to unspoken issues, and affirm stories gone untold—stories such as her own.\n\nKyung Bin Bae was born in Seoul in 1953, at the heels of the Korean War. In childhood, he recalls growing up without financial worry, though his family’s fortunes would soon run out as he began to prepare for his college entrance exams. While in university, Kyung Bin studied journalism and, following the advice of his professor, decided to pursue graduate studies after college. After graduate school, he completed his mandatory military service and made the move to Michigan State University to continue studying journalism, which was where he met his wife.\n\nOver his first summer in America, he bought a used car and drove to New York City to find work and start building savings before returning to school; it was in the Big Apple that he’d begin his career in the clothing industry. Returning back to Michigan, he got married and had a change of heart with his journalistic aspirations, choosing to instead move to NYC after his wife’s graduation to continue work in the clothing business. Throughout the decades, he worked in a variety of operational roles for a variety of companies, sporting a variety of work cultures, but is currently enjoying retirement, which has finally afforded him the time to spend more time with his wife, children, and grandchildren.\n\nJackie Faye was born in Dallas, Texas to Korean immigrants; in the 1970s, her grandparents first arrived in Los Angeles, relocated to Alaska, and finally settled in Texas. Faye strongly identifies as being queer, emphasizing the importance of acceptance: of herself, and the risks that come along with it. Yet despite Jackie’s exposure to pain and violence which seek to diminish her identity, she describes her journey as having been worthwhile for the agency and freedom she’s fought for over her own experiences and aspirations. Jackie carries on her father’s passion for music by creating and engaging with music herself, a form of art that allows her to express her thoughts and feelings, as honest as she can be. She emphasizes the importance of being true to yourself in any and every way possible, paying no attention to what others might think about you.\n\nSoon Ki Bae, who also goes by Simon, was born in Japanese-occupied Korea in 1935 in South Jeolla Province. He recalls how the country was liberated while he was in the third grade, but political turbulence continued for much longer. The Korean War broke out when Bae was in middle school, and wartime anxiety followed him around. He was weary of police during the day, partisans at night. Political unrest would continue to spur anxiety even after the war’s end through the April 19th Revolution, and the following May 16th Coup in 1961. By chance, it was during the coup that Bae enlisted in the military to fulfill his mandatory service. After decades of turbulence at home, Bae moved to Germany to work as a contracted miner, relocating to Chicago with some friends he had made in the new country at the end of his contract. Slowly, the former miners opened restaurants, groceries, and other small businesses, building a Koreatown on the North Side of the city. Along the way, he’s been actively involved in cultural efforts such as the formation of a performing samulnori troup and even a saxophone sextet. Despite his hardships, Bae reminds us that the key to staying vibrant in one’s golden years is to continue seeking out activities that encourage youthful enthusiasm.\n\nBecky Belcore was born in Seoul and adopted into a Minnesotan family when she was one year old. She lived there until her family moved to the southern states of Virginia and, eventually, Alabama. Growing up in all-white communities was very challenging– Becky even once believed that Korea didn’t exist because she had never seen anybody who looked like her growing up.\n\nThrough a passion for activism and organizing she found during college, Becky connected with peers like herself and eventually her Korean heritage through her area’s Korean American Resource and Cultural Center (KRCC). Although it was tough for her to get used to the space, the lens of social justice she discovered at the center encouraged her to stay; the present marks her 26th year of involvement with KRCC and her 6th year as the co-director for the National Korean American Service & Education Consortium (NAKASEC).\n\nJohn Anthony Ranum was born in Pyeongyang, North Korea just as the Korean War was about to rear its head. Separated from his mother amidst the conflict, he wandered down the peninsula to Daegu, where he was placed in a number of orphanages. It was in Daegu that he’d meet his adoptive brother, an American GI stationed at Daegu air base. Adopted into a family in Chicagoland, Anthony himself would end up enlisting in the United States Air Force with hopes that he’d be able to find his mother while on duty in Korea. While stationed at Osan air base, Anthony met his wife, with whom he moved back to the United States to start his own family; today, he takes immense pride in his three daughters and five grandchildren.\n\nAnne Joh engages in conversation with her son Alex Joh-Jung about each of their upbringings in the United States. She reflects on her life as a single mother, striving to be a “good Korean immigrant parent” raising her two sons, and having a moment of realization that what was most important for her as a parent was letting them know they always have a choice of not doing something. Anne in turn asks Alex about how he felt growing up under a working, single, and feminist mother. Alex reflects on how his mother’s convictions have shaped his political and academic worldview.\n\nJoseph Oh, originally born in Korea, faced a unique journey of adoption and cultural immersion. At the age of 5, he and his biological brother found a loving home in Chicago when a White family adopted them together.

Today, Joseph is a father, determined to provide his son with the love and security he himself has come to cherish.\n\nIssun Park’s life has been shaped by unexpected relocations and experiences. Born in Kaesong, North Korea, she spent most of her childhood in Seoul. At the age of 8, her family had to leave Seoul urgently, crossing the Han River just before it was bombed. They managed to escape the city safely. Later, her father found a job with the US Army stationed in Tokyo, where they lived for seven years before eventually moving to Okinawa. In 1962, Park emigrated to San Francisco to join her older brother. It was there that she met her future husband through a mutual friend, got married, and had three boys together. Despite her diverse background, Park never felt out of place in America and has embraced the liberal values instilled by her father.\n\nWhile fleeing for their lives, Kwon Sook Young vividly recalls the evacuation journey with her family from Andong to Busan aboard a freight train. Amidst the chaos, a heart-stopping moment occurred when Young found herself surrounded by bags of rice as a large water kettle came crashing down upon her from a nearby bomb explosion. Her motionless body led her family to believe she died; however, against all odds, they discovered her crawling out alive and breathing.\n\nFrom attempting to sell Korean pears to nearby soldiers to her father narrowly escaping execution, the Korean War served as just one chapter in Young’s life of survival. Young eventually relocated to New York, and a profound sense of displacement enveloped her as she grappled with the challenges of language barriers and cultural shock.\n\nToday, Young’s thoughts often gravitate towards themes of mortality and aging, contemplating how to gracefully navigate the inevitable aftermath. Despite the passage of time, she continues to reside in New York alongside her family, desiring nothing but the best for them and hoping they may lead long and healthy lives.\n\nDr. Samuel Sang Gook Lee was born in Daegu, Korea in 1935 during the Japanese occupation. Recalling the Emperor’s Oath that Korean students had to recite every day in school, Dr. Lee reflects on feeling shame for obeying Japanese rule. He was forced to learn Japanese and obtain a Japanese Sur name during the occupation. His local church was the only place where he found community and positivity.\n\nLater when he was 15 years old, Dr. Lee served as a house boy for 3 years where he ran errands for the U.S. soldiers on their military base. It was during this time that he suffered from severe depression and anxiety, which he carried with him throughout the rest of his life. Since immigrating to the US, Dr. Lee continues to pray every day to bring healing to himself and his family impacted by generational trauma.\n\nAlex Chang was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1959, but spent most of his early life in Venice, California.

Alex is the current president and chair of the Korean American Pioneer Council, which mission is to collect and archive the histories of Korean American Pioneers and their descendants, and in 2015 Alex received a Certificate of Recognition from the city of Los Angeles for his service contribution to the community and in recognition of the 70th year of Korea’s Independence. Alex emphasizes the importance of preserving and passing down all Korean American stories and experiences to the next generations.\n\nHere is a link to the story he wrote a few years ago on his Great Grandfather and Grandfather.\n\nBorn a 2nd gen immigrant in Bakersfield, California in 1940, Irvin Paik recalls his unease around his Japanese neighbors and witnessing his parents face a lot of discrimination from white Americans. Irvin discovered a passion for theater in junior high school and continued to be involved with producing, writing, and acting in plays throughout high school and college. He even won an award in a Shakespeare competition at UCLA. Irvin also worked in photography, even pursuing a career in it, though he faced discrimination from employers.\n\nIrvin later found work in the army, filming training videos, serving in Vietnam as a combat photographer, and working as a script supervisor at a pictorial center in Long Island City. He also worked filming a television show for 14 years.

Despite feeling fortunate for her loving adoptive family, she still felt and looked different, influenced by classmates that bullied her.\n\nYears later, in 2018, Christine saw an online post about a welcome home program. Inspired by the documentary Lion, in which a man found his family on Google, she discovered the Korean American Adoptee Facebook group and was able to travel to Korea for the first time.

Seeing how much diversity that the States provided, Namjun’s parents decided to lengthen their stay to see their kids graduate. Along the way, Namjun had a hard time in school, feeling little sympathy from the community as he would find himself in conflict with other students; never being able to share his side of the story because of the language barrier. After years of adjusting to America, Namjun then returned to Korea in late-July of 2020 to fulfill his military duties. Because of his need to learn English to get by in the States, Namjun found himself now struggling with his native-tongue and self-proclaimed American identity, which earned him no support yet again. Caught in between, Namjun went into training and service feeling Korean, and has come out on what feels like the distant other side of being American.\n\nOne night in Seoul, Tae Kim found himself in a Burger King, struggling to order his meal. Despite being able to speak Korean fluently in his home of Koreatown LA, he quickly found that it just did not translate so smoothly in his new home of Korea. As he tried paying for the meal he didn’t even want, Tae felt the realness of culture shock. Doubt and fear permeated as he began to settle into the new city, leading him to ask friends about finding mental health counseling. To his surprise, his struggle was met with judgment. Certain that he couldn’t be the only one, Tae took action. Starting with a Facebook group to provide a safe outlet for people struggling with their mental health in Korea, it became clear that he really wasn’t alone. So he made an app called “Gideb” where people could remain anonymous and find the right resources and access to the mental health support they need. Now, Tae is grateful to be living in Korea with his wife and son, happily running his company.\n\nAn immigrant to Mercer Island, Washington, Kyu Lee recalls not knowing anything about Korean culture aside from the obvious, he and his family were all born there. It wasn’t until after college that Kyu began to be exposed to Korean entertainment. In 2005 during a vacation to the motherland, he watched “Taegukgi: The Brotherhood of War” for the first time and was blown away. Working for Sony at the time, Kyu flew home and enthusiastically told his team about the film. It was quickly picked up and distributed in the States, making it the first Korean film screened in the U.S. entertainment market. Sparking Kyu’s pride and desire to introduce Korean content to the States, he quickly built his network from there, ultimately leaving him responsible for the U.S. viral sensation “Gangnam Style”. Life is still a crazy rollercoaster ride for Kyu as he continues to work in film and distribution. As he rolls with the punches, he hopes to continue to uplift and provide opportunities to those around him.\n\nAs an anti-racist facilitator and overall creative, Kayla Kim Votapek leads a life of perpetual acceptance of growth and movement towards understanding, but getting there has come with its own challenges.

This further ignited a passion in her to help others feel seen and heard, to facilitate spaces that nurture communities through action, communication and reparation.\n\nAt age 15, with a natural talent for perfect pitch, Edwin Kim quickly immigrated from South Korea to New Jersey’s very own Palisades Park to attend Juilliard’s competitive pre-college program. Rather than encouragement for his gift of music, he was met with doubt and accusations of plagiarism from instructors. As a student and young immigrant, Edwin recalls this incident causing a deep struggle to prove himself, almost bringing him to end his own life.

Kwon being half Thai / half Korean, was brought up in a Western household; never feeling connected to either culture except through the food her family served in their restaurant. It wasn’t until recently, when her parents’ divorce became finalized, that Kwon began to see a shift in her mother, who began to immerse herself into the Korean community of Houston.

As Kwon continues navigating her place in the world, she hopes to unravel more about herself and her roots.\n\nDavid Shin recalls his dad expressing their family’s immigration to Canada as being “for the sake of his children” despite their struggles with money. Watching his father balance a difficult life of buying properties and paying mortgages– “asset rich, cash flow poor”– led David in a completely different direction towards engineering and law school.

When a friend invited him to visit Korea, he took the opportunity and brought along his barbeque rubs and spices. He somehow found a way to make barbeque and began to pursue popups to sell his pulled pork sandwiches. To his surprise, they were a hit and realized he was on to something and knew he had to head back to the US in order to learn more than just making pulled pork sandwiches. He traveled from town to town, meeting new people and learning new techniques. He eventually got to Batesville, Arkansas, where he trained to be a barbeque judge.

When she was eight or nine years old, she read the story of Tamar in the Bible and saw her life being reflected right at her. A family member was sexually abusing her.

She addressed what was happening, but the school couldn’t find any students or hard evidence to support her claim. Nobody believed her and thought she was just out to get him, so she internalized all of her emotions because she feared being shamed by others.

With the affirmation and support from the professor, Cecelia was able to get the help she needed.\n\nKat Ley was born in South Korea and was adopted when she was 7 months old. Before becoming a counselor at Sejong Camp, Kat attended as a camper for much of her childhood.

She has found peace in being able to embrace her Korean Americanness, while also believing that her true identity is defined by how she lives her everyday life.\n\nDr. Doug Hong was born in Korea in 1941. By the time he was 9 years old, the Korean War had begun. He recalls being faced with extreme hunger that he caught insects like cicadas and flies to eat.

Greg had no idea of what he was hoping for when he came to Korea. To a certain degree, he wanted to find a purpose while trying to live out the inflated dreams he made throughout his childhood but he was also feeling pressured because he told people back home his decision was to explore his Korean roots. After living in Korea for four years, he stopped worrying about his adoption because he found himself being able to feel comfortable in his own skin and living life through work and meeting people who embraced him as he is. As Greg continues life in Korea, he hopes to continue to process and explore his identity through each moment that comes naturally in his everyday life.\n\nMandy Hwang was raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma by an American father and Korean mother.

She believes that it is important for future generations of Korean Americans to not only be familiar with their Korean heritage, but also to make it their own.\n\nBrian Kuh was born in South Korea and moved to America at the age of six. He moved around frequently throughout his childhood, which always made him the new Asian student at school. By second grade, he started to realize how much his peers were teasing him and even recalls having rocks thrown at him. Instead of harboring any form of bitterness, Brian just wanted to feel like he belonged and continued to have a lingering feeling of being “in the middle”. With other Koreans, they would say he is too American. With Korean Americans, they would say he was too Korean. Eventually, he realized being between two cultures is a uniqueness not many people have and would allow him to become a bridge connecting two communities.\n\nEric McDaniel was adopted at the age of four to a family in Kansas City, Missouri. On the car ride from the airport, his mom opened up a photo album showing four polaroid photos – one of a car, a big house, his Mom and brother smiling, and his bed.

One day, he had the opportunity to participate in the running event at school and surprised everyone when he began to pass his classmates. Kesung was ultimately recruited for the track team and ended up beating the top runner at a sectional meet, thus helping him grow out of his shell and gaining confidence as well as respect from his peers.\n\nGrowing up in California, Hayden Royalty felt pressure to pursue a career in medicine during her studies at university.

Today, she uses her skills and artistic talent for advocacy and spreading awareness about rare diseases like hers.

Both of her parents grew up in the United States, and her American roots, coupled with her Korean heritage, gave her a unique cultural identity. While Ms. Choi felt in tune with her American identity, her Korean one was harder to reconcile with growing up in Hong Kong due to the relative lack of Korean-Americans in her community.
