        "text": "Sociology and the Making of the Huaqiao\n\nIt is worth elaborating briefly here on Chen Da’s use of the term huaqiao, which many studies have shown was under conceptual construction during the late Qing [End Page 245] and early Republic.10 Chen’s studies were curiously untethered from the proliferation of studies of Nanyang huaqiao being conducted almost simultaneously by a circle of intellectuals surrounding Jinan University and its Department of Nanyang Cultural and Educational Affairs, including Liu Shimu (劉士木 1889–1952), Yao Nan (姚楠 1912–1996), Su Qianying (苏乾英 1910–1996), and especially Li Changfu (李長傅 1899–1966), who was perhaps the most prolific writer on the Nanyang Chinese in the Nanjing era.11 Li Changfu’s interest in the overseas Chinese was actually provoked by reading Harley Farnsworth MacNair’s Chinese Abroad, as he laments in the introduction to his 1927 study, Huaqiao: “The study of huaqiao was not started by Chinese people but by foreigners; this is a great shame to Chinese academia.” Li took huaqiao to mean “all hua people (short for Zhonghua [中華] people) who sojourn and live abroad” (華者，中華之簡稱，僑者，旅寓之意; 凡我國人旅寓於國外者, 皆可稱之曰華僑).12 Li’s educational sojourn was in Japan rather than America—he spent a short stint at Waseda University between 1929 and 1931—and his writings, perhaps influenced by Japanese ideas of colonization as “people planting” (植民 shokumin), exhibit an understanding of Chinese migration to the Nanyang as a form of developmental colonization or settler development (拓殖 tuozhi), along with the civilizational benefits that implied.13 He specifically viewed China’s colonization (殖民 zhimin) of the Nanyang as a developmental process, of “leaving the motherland for a relatively undeveloped country” to settle permanently and participate in economic activities while maintaining political relations with the motherland, though he was careful to distinguish this from European colonialism, which he viewed as having greater state support.14 Like many northern Chinese intellectuals—Li was a [End Page 246] Jiangsu native—he also subscribed to stereotypes about the nature of the southern peoples that would push them to do such un-Confucian things as traveling away from their family burial grounds. The southern coastal residents, he thought, were piratical by nature and “late bloomers” in the adoption of Confucian norms, and so—while they were no doubt bettering even less developed lands in the southern seas—they were themselves far less civilized than their northern counterparts, who would not have sojourned at all.\n\nOn this matter, Chen’s approach to the huaqiao was diametrically opposed. He seems never to have cited works on the Nanyang by the Jinan scholars, nor did he engage with their usages of the term huaqiao, although his work was certainly known to some within the Jinan circle, at least later on,15 and he did interact with Liu Shimu in conceptualizing his 1938 study, though I have not been able to ascertain the extent of this exchange.16 Unlike the Jinan scholars, Chen made a distinction between two types of emigrant Chinese with “different natures and different outlooks on life”: those who migrated out of China, qianmin (迁民 literally, people who moved), and those who grew up in the South Seas, qiaomin (僑民 literally, people who lived abroad). He considered huaqiao to be a “common name” (俗稱 sucheng) or an umbrella term for haiwai Zhongguoren (海外 中國人), a category that for him included both qianmin and qiaomin.17 And rather than regarding mainlanders as civilizing the less developed southern Nanyang lands, he came to express in his work the view, in effect, that emigrant Chinese constituted an “element of social change” (社會變遷的一個原素 shehui bianqian de yige yuansu) for the emigrant districts of Guangdong and Fujian. In other words, rather than China civilizing the barbaric Nanyang periphery, the huaqiao of the Nanyang were, in fact, sources of modernization for a more backward China. Emigrants, Chen concluded in Nanyang huaqiao yu minyue shehui (南洋華僑與閩粵社會), tend to stimulate social change in China: materially, they remitted money home and transformed the economic base of their home villages (侨乡 qiaoxiang); beyond the material, they also brought different practices and values back to the emigrant districts. Across the realms of livelihood and work, food, clothing and shelter, family structure, education, health habits, and religion, emigrants were a major stimulus of change and transformation. They had the cumulative effect of disintegrating the family structures of “traditional society” (傳統社 chuantong shehui) and of fundamentally [End Page 247] changing and improving the “mode of living” (生活方式 shenghuo fangshi) or “standard of living” (生活程度 shenghuo chengdu) of families in emigrant districts.18\n\nOne of the reasons for Chen’s discursive isolation from the Jinan circle may be the genesis of Nanyang huaqiao yu minyue shehui in a research agenda established by the American-based Institute for Pacific Relations (IPR), an international nongovernmental research organization with roots in missionary activism and Wilsonian internationalism. Though largely forgotten today, the IPR had a remarkable influence on public knowledge and on both elite and popular discourse about the Asia-Pacific region prior to the Second World War.19 At a time when the US government was investing heavily in its domestic white middle classes through the New Deal, the IPR was uniquely committed to a broader mission of fostering transracial and international understanding and communication, beyond state politics and official government policies, regarding issues concerning China, Japan, and the broader Asia-Pacific region: China, in particular, consumed more of its research budget in the 1930s than all other countries combined. Owing no doubt to the networks he established in the United States while he was a student, Chen was invited to the IPR’s inaugural conference in Honolulu in 1925 as an expert on Chinese migration, the subject of his PhD dissertation and first monograph publication.20 What became his 1938 study was developed in conversation with a research agenda agreed upon at a major IPR conference in Banff in 1933, which resolved to “concentrate new research projects in the next biennial period to the subjects of Standards of Living and Cultural Relations.”21 In particular, it was intended to speak to a set of research questions about comparative standards of living between East and West, including a specific question about how far migration had affected standards of living in Pacific communities.22\n\nChen’s initial research fieldwork plan, drafted in 1934, was sent for comment to a wide range of academics within the broad networks of the IPR, including Robert E. Park of the University of Chicago and Romanzo Adams of the University of Hawaiʻi, Tao Menghe (陶孟和 1887–1960) of Nanjing Academia Sinica and Wu Wenzao (吴文藻 1901–1985) of Yenching University, and Liu Shimu of the Nanyang Department at Jinan. Among those most directly involved in the project was undoubtedly Bruno Lasker (1880–1965), a research associate of the IPR and a social scientist with wide-ranging [End Page 248] interests in unemployment, public health, social legislation, labor, and slavery.23 Lasker was instrumental at the research-design stage, traveled part of the way to Southeast Asia with Chen in early 1935, and remained in close cooperation with him throughout. They arranged to travel in opposing directions around the Nanyang, Chen moving counterclockwise from Borneo through to Malaya and the Dutch East Indies and Lasker beginning in Manila and traveling onward, clockwise, to Singapore.24 They also agreed on a division of labor between them: Chen would focus on making Chinese contacts, and Lasker would confine his inquiries to American and European government officials and representatives, whom, he explained, Chen had a harder time accessing.25 In the planning stage, Lasker furnished Chen directly with notes and “literary excerpts” that Lasker himself had collected independently,26 though he was disheartened by Chen’s apparent reluctance to assimilate them into his research methodology: “I have compiled an enormous amount of information from the literature on Southern Chinese emigration for Ta Chen,” Lasker wrote in a personal update to his IPR colleague William Holland, “and am only afraid that his methodical mind will not know what to do with it even if I carefully index these more than 150 pages for him.”27 Lasker was also responsible for overseeing and editing the 1940 English translation of Chen’s 1938 study, and it is in the divergence between the two that a moment of contingent discourse formation can be discerned.\n\nIn comparing the original and the translation, it becomes clear that there was a kind of intellectual tussle at play, centered directly upon argumentation and the question of the extent and centrality of Nanyang huaqiao influence on Chinese emigrant districts. The structure of the English translation differed in small but critical ways from that of the Chinese original. Lasker’s translation laid out an introduction and 10 chapters that more or less followed the sequence of Chen’s chapters, though with the creation of a few extra chapter divisions. Chen’s Chinese original, however, distributes all its chapters between just two major parts: Part I, “Huaqiao Districts: Traditional Lifestyle and Its Changes,” and Part II, “An Element of Social Change: The Influence of Migrants [移民 yimin].” Lasker commented on this explicitly in his editorial foreword: “The Chinese author in the present case has enviable mastery of the English language; nevertheless certain passages of the text required further elucidation, or changes in phraseology to make clear their intended meaning. Moreover the order of the report had to be changed because it made too great a demand on Western students who are accustomed to a different sequence of statement in the presentation of a given body of social information.”28 [End Page 249]\n\nThe arrangement of Chen’s chapters and parts makes clear his argumentative intention: of all the factors that were changing China at the time, he considered emigrants to be the principal one, and he says so explicitly in his introduction:\n\n閩粵的華僑社區，有它的生活方式 如本書各章所敘述的。這種生活方式的 形成與變遷，當然有許多原素，但南洋的遷民實是主要原動力之一。\n\nThe huaqiao districts in Guangdong and Fujian have their own specific modes of living, as the chapters of this book will elaborate. There are, of course, many elements [原素 yuansu] that contribute to the formation and transformation of their modes of living, but the Nanyang qianmin actually constitute one of the principal [主要 zhuyao] driving forces.\n\nHowever, this section is translated by Lasker as:\n\nThe emigrant communities in East Guangdong and South Fujian have a mode of living—if here we may briefly anticipate the findings given in subsequent chapters— readily distinguishable from that of other rural areas in China. Among the forces motivating social change the influence of the overseas Chinese from the Nanyang is, of course, only one, but it is striking and unmistakable.29\n\nTheir intellectual tussle takes place in the argumentative gap between “one of the principal driving forces” and “only one, but striking and unmistakable.” In fact, evidence from Lasker’s correspondence with the IPR in 1934–1935 frequently reveals their mutual struggle; in conceptualizing the project, Chen apparently “again and again [came] out with the insane idea that perhaps he was engaged only to finish the fieldwork and that subsequently someone else will be engaged to write up the result.”30 It is also clear from the correspondence that the original study had not been intended to furnish arguments about the importance of the Nanyang huaqiao to China at all but rather to appraise standards of living in China: as Lasker wrote, “We [do] not set out to study Chinese emigration, nor the character of Chinese settlement and colonization in the south-sea countries…. Our concern, as I understand it, is 90 per cent with the home community.”31 In March 1935, Lasker circulated among a limited number of IPR members a separate interim report of his own on Chen’s project that was intended to comment on Chen’s project in view of its relevance to the broader IPR program of research into comparative standards of living.32 On this point, Lasker’s report demonstrated a definite divergence from Chen’s arguments. In compiling this report, Lasker had access to the reams of letters and field reports that were being channeled to Chen from his platoon of research assistants stationed in the field sites under study between 1934 and 1935, and he was thus able to draw his own [End Page 250] conclusions. Lasker frequently cited reports from Kenneth Chun (陈观胜 Chen Guansheng dates unknown), a former student at the University of Hawaiʻi and one of Chen’s researchers, whom Chen had likely come to know while he was stationed in Honolulu as a visiting Carnegie Professor of International Relations in 1930 and whom Lasker likely also met at that time.33 Contrary to Chen, Lasker thought that “remittances enlarge, but do not materially change the standard of living,” and he cited Kenneth Chun’s field reports:\n\nChange in food and clothing are usually in quantity and quality, but very seldom in kind or style. It is true, some of the returned emigrants have brought Western clothes back with them; but they wear these only on special occasions. We have not seen a single woman here wearing anything other than the Chinese styles. However, the gains in quantity and quality are considerable…. This is also true of food…. There are no visible changes in the eating habits of the returned emigrants. They still stick to Chinese bowls, chopsticks, and food. However, there are improvements to the quantity and quality of the food….\n\nThe wasteful superstitious practices are still rampant…marriages are still concluded without the consent of those to be married. One young man who favored a “liberal” marriage, nevertheless went through the old-fashioned marriage ceremony and, when he was asked why he permitted it, said he could not fight against the combined opinion of home and community. Quite a few of the young returned emigrants have expressed themselves in the same vein—that it is futile to battle against the dead weight of traditional authority.\n\nThe changes enumerated in previous paragraphs represent only a small portion of the emigrant families. Our experience in Zhanglin [樟林] has shown us that, in the great majority of them, the returned member does not exert any discernible influence at all.34\n\nThis direction of critique of Chen’s conclusions can also be found in a subsequent review of the published book by Francis Hsu (许烺光 1909–1999), a Bronisław Malinowski–trained anthropologist and specialist on Yunnan magic and science. Hsu wrote critically of Chen’s study, rejecting his conclusions and stating bluntly that, in his scrutiny of the very same facts that Chen made available in his study, he had nonetheless drawn completely opposite conclusions. “South Seas emigration has…not only had no effects opposed to the traditional ways of life, but has caused them to be expressed with greater clarity and force,” he insisted, stating furthermore that “wealth acquired through emigration [End Page 251] has in most cases merely added oil to the lamp of age-old tradition.”35 It is possible that this struggle was on the minds of IPR researchers after the war. Lasker’s opinion of Chen was by no means fully negative, as he wrote to Holland’s Chinese counterpart in the IPR, Wellington Liu (劉馭萬 Liu Yuwan 1897–1966): “It is a very pleasant experience to work with the professor. Though we always disagree a little on interpreting what we find…we nevertheless have a great deal of fun together…and I admire his thoroughness, his modesty—though this is excessive—and his scientific zeal for the truth and nothing but the truth.”36 But his frustrations, as expressed in a more candid remark to Holland that Chen “has not a very original mind,” came to be echoed by other American IPR associates.37 Having spent most of the wartime years in Kunming doing meticulous census work and labor research for the Nationalist government, Chen wrote to the IPR in 1947 to request funding for publishing something out of these investigations; one of the proposed studies was on the urbanization of Kunming through the modernizing efforts of migrants. His request was politely declined after some internal discussion: “I am [not sure],” one reviewer wrote privately to Holland, the IPR research secretary, “that he has enough flexibility to undertake work on the topic you suggest.”38 Chen’s marshaling of social facts into an argumentative theory about the positive, modernizing influence of emigrants on China, part of a developmentalist drive that ran in an opposite direction from his Jinan contemporaries, seems to have been a patriotic interpretation from preexisting convictions about the value of emigrants to China. He had not, perhaps, heeded enough Lasker’s comment in Honolulu in 1930: “A sociologist must be like a child. Otherwise he loses the significance of the facts. If one goes to a place with set theories, he is likely to gather only those facts which suit his theories.”39\n\nBetween Fact and Theory: Chen Da’s Travels in the Nanyang\n\nAlthough the bulk of the ground-level fieldwork for Nanyang huaqiao yu minyue shehui was done by his research teams,40 Chen Da did visit the places that appear in his final study, and he recorded his travels in a book published a decade later and [End Page 252] called Notes from Ten Years of Roaming (浪跡十年 Langji shinian; 1946). Part travelogue, part autobiography, and part research notebook, this volume was described by Chen as a kind of unsystematic aide-mémoire or what he called “casual writing” (隨便的文筆 suibian de wenbi) as part of the practice of empirical sociology (實證社會學 shizheng shehuixue).41 He explained that he sought nothing more than to jot down noteworthy observations for the purposes of furnishing a basis for later argument. As he explained:\n\nA large part of human life is made up of trivial matters, such as food, clothing, shelter, and daily activities. For these events, we should observe [觀察 guancha] with all our five senses and seek to reduce errors when observing. Second, we should record our observations at the time of observation…. If [we do not do so], there are many things that will pass before our eyes like clouds, leaving no trace and no chance to study them in the future. If the memory is not detailed, there will be no reliable basis for narrative or argument. Third, we should seek to understand the meaning of these observations and be able to explain the observed phenomena and the recorded facts.\n\nThe places to which he traveled were determined by the areas of concentration of emigrants from the Southern Chinese districts at the center of his study, and thus for three months in early 1935 he traveled across the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, Siam, and French Indochina. “The aim,” he wrote, “was less that of securing data for comparison of living conditions at home and abroad as it was to study those factors in the overseas Chinese community which contribute to the particular kind of influence which it exerts on the mode of living in the home communities of its members in South China.”42 In the following sections, I elaborate first on the racially complex milieu of Chen’s encounters and the way he persistently reconciled and resolved them into a fantasy of Chineseness that supported his emigrant theories and then on the persistent masculinity of the world in which he moved and how that shaped his theories about the role of women in emigrant societies.\n\nBeyond Biology and Culture: Fantasies of Chineseness in the Malay World\n\nAs outlined earlier, Chen, unlike his Jinan contemporaries, distinguished clearly between qianmin and qiaomin, and in the course of his writing he did not often use the term huaqiao without this qualification.43 For Chen, the principal distinction between them was racial and a secondary distinction was jurisdictional. Qiaomin were mostly mixed race, usually born of a father who had emigrated from China and a mother who was a native local woman (當地的土人女子 dangdi de turen nüzi). Qianmin [End Page 253] were straightforwardly people of Chinese blood who sojourned. This, Chen thought, mapped onto a further jurisdictional difference: China’s consulates would consider qianmin as falling within their sphere of interests and protection, while European colonial governments considered qiaomin to be under their jurisdiction. Qiaomin, Chen said, were “mostly mixed race [混血兒 hunxue’er]; they do not speak Chinese and do not know Chinese history or geography.”44\n\nChen’s ideas about race are discernible in development from his earliest work, in particular his master’s degree research while a student at Columbia in 1920 and his subsequent 1923 monograph based on his doctoral dissertation on Chinese migration. His master’s thesis in political science, on birth control, illustrates his early inculcation with the widespread ideas about biological race and evolution that marked so many Chinese intellectuals of that era.45 Steeped in the eugenics discourses of the age, he developed an early conviction, which he would carry throughout his work during the Guomindang and Chinese Communist Party regimes, that birth control or “volitional limitation of the family” was the only possible check on the “inevitable evils of unlimited propagation” that he saw as the root cause of Chinese poverty.46 For Chen, birth control was the only way to guarantee the constant improvement of the quality of the race, since having large families was incompatible with “leisure” and leisure time was crucial for self-cultivation and civilization.47 He was greatly taken with Margaret Sanger’s work and played a role in introducing her to other May Fourth intellectuals and arranging her visit to China in 1920.48 In his direct contrasting of “volitional selection” as being more beneficial for racial improvement than “natural selection,”49 his views were also exemplary of the attractiveness to intellectuals in this period of Spencerian “eugenic control-fantasies” rather than the impersonal and unmanipulable Darwinian laws of evolution.50 Racial improvement, in short, could be managed through carefully chosen human action. In his personal life, Chen practiced what he preached: as an advocate of “equal replacement” of the population (对等更替 duideng gengti), he believed that a couple should have no more than two children; as far as I can tell, he had only two children himself, about whom very little information can be found, owing no doubt to his difficult trajectory through the Maoist era.51 [End Page 254]\n\nThere is little specifically about birth control in his study of Chinese migration published several years later, but he brought to this study his ideas about active racial improvement. Chen’s 1923 study was based primarily on library research rather than fieldwork; he canvassed official documents of Chinese, European, and American governments, secondary literature of journals and periodicals, and Western (though not Chinese) studies of Chinese emigrants.52 In this work he dealt for the first time with the issue of racial mixing and intermarriage and, perhaps surprisingly, was inclined to view miscegenation in a positive light as one of the active mechanisms by which a race might be improved. Though his conclusions remained tentative, chiefly held back by “the paucity of statistical material on racial amalgamation,” one of the main overall conclusions of his study was that “there has been evidence to show the eugenic benefits of miscegenation between the Chinese and other nationals.”53 He cites not only various American and European studies that suggested that Chinese blood had an improving and permanent effect on non-Chinese peoples but also those that suggested that mixed Chinese races might be superior to “pure” ones. He drew, for example, on Ernest J. Reece’s study of racial mixing in Hawaiʻi, which asserted that “the Chinese Hawaiian is far superior to both of the elements in his make-up” and was also superior to the Caucasian-Hawaiian,54 and he elsewhere observed that “white blood does not persist in the mestizos…the Chinese is the only race that implants permanent characteristics upon mestizo offspring.”55 From James Brook’s journal, he noted that “the mixed breed of the Chinese with the Malays or the Dyaks are a good looking and industrious race…. This mainly arises from education and early formed habits which are altogether Chinese; and in religion and customs they likewise follow, in a good measure, the paternal stock. The race is worthy of attention, as the future possessors of Borneo.”56 This early attention to mixed-race Chinese groups and his more extensive use of American and European sources may have been a stimulus to his qiaomin/qianmin distinction, disposing him to view miscegenation in a far more benign light than his Japan-influenced contemporaries.\n\nIn his field travels a decade later, however, Chen was presented with quite a different set of realities. Throughout his travels he met community leaders who had largely maintained connections with China or represented Chinese interests, which naturally had a self-selecting effect: those with whom he spoke regularly expressed the opinion that racial mixing between Chinese and non-Chinese would not have improving effects and that the mixing of non-Chinese with Chinese blood would result in the latter becoming [End Page 255] degraded. On February 4, 1935, he recorded a conversation with a Surabayan Chinese man named Lin Huiye (林徽業 dates unknown) who conveyed a typically troubling sentiment: “Mixed race people think that Chinese people are no good…but in the past hundred years, mixed race populations have been waning. The native people [土人 turen] have a simplistic culture and are famous for being lazy. They don’t understand hygiene [衛生 weisheng], and when Chinese people mix with them, they degrade the quality of the race.”57 In Singapore, probably owing to the doors opened by letters from the Penang-born president of Xiamen University Lim Boon Keng (林文慶 1869–1957), he was able to meet with important community leaders of both Chinese and Straits Chinese, including Tan Kah Kee (陳嘉庚 1874–1961) and Tan Cheng Lock (陳禎祿 1883–1960), and he had a particularly extensive conversation with the former, who conveyed to him similar racially charged sentiments about the intrinsic laziness of Malay peoples. As Chen records Tan Kah Kee’s words, “The reason huaren were able to open up Malaya is really because the turen lacked ambition and physical strength. Not a single one among Malaya’s turen could have built up a 100-acre rubber plantation. But the laziest huagong [華工] can set up a rubber plantation four times that size.”58 Perhaps most disturbingly for him, the qiaomin he encountered in Java and Siam seemed to have vanished altogether from visible Chineseness: “It is sometimes difficult to identify whether qiaomin who have assimilated [同化 tonghua] with natives are Chinese [中國人 Zhongguoren] or not.”59\n\nThese social facts presented Chen with an interpretive problem: how were emigrant communities meant to be an element of positive social change if intermarriage either “degraded” the Chinese race or caused them to become indistinguishable from the turen? His solution was to privilege the cultural over the material and biological, in a kind of wishful fantasy of racial thinking. For example, he observed of the mixed-race children he saw in Zhanglin, Shantou, that “while the physique [體質 tizhi] of mixed-race boys is sometimes distinguishable, the differences are not very significant” and that the most important of them lay in “language and living habits” (語言與生活習慣 yuyan yu shenghuo xiguan).60 Of still greater significance, beyond culture, was what was in their hearts: despite their physical assimilation, “many [qiaomin] still love the motherland and express a strong sympathy for it.”61 From his conversation with H. H. Kan (1881–1951), he recorded an idea of Chinese xinling (心靈 mind, mentality, or perhaps soul or spirit), which transcended blood:\n\nOn the surface, some habits of the qiaomin resemble those of natives, while others resemble those of Europeans—but when you investigate [偵察 zhencha, rather than 觀察 guancha] his heart, he is still a Chinese person. Qiaomin can take natives as wives, but all children born to them still have the xinling of Chinese children.62 [End Page 256]\n\nChen’s idea of xinling echoed the influence of his teacher Franklin Giddings, whose emphasis on culture and social psychology had produced the heuristic of the “social mind” to assess collective social phenomena.63 Chen’s conclusion—that even if Chineseness were to be biologically lost through racial mixing, it could nonetheless be transmitted through a metaphysical xinling—was also a contingent ideological formation, produced out of the creative adaptations of prevailing discourses of biological race with, as James Leibold put it, “the expectation that culture would gradually displace race as the dominant hermeneutic of national unity” in China.64 Thus, while noting that in Siam “three-quarters of the Siamese Chinese have been ‘Siamized’ [暹化 Xianhua]”65 and that “the degree of Siamization of the qiaomin is very high” there,66 in Zhanglin, Shantou, he was able to recuperate his vanishing countrymen. He observed that the Siamese Chinese were the most likely to maintain close business and educational connections with their emigrant districts and that they were after all, despite their mixed backgrounds, retrievable into Chineseness: “After living in Zhanglin for a long time, [Siamese mixed-race boys] are all Sinicized [漢化 Hanhua], and, if no one specifically points them out, it is not possible to tell who is mixed.”67\n\nIn Chen’s travelogues and studies of emigrant Chinese, we catch a glimpse of the ways in which, as Frank Dikötter, James Leibold, and others have shown, Republican-era elites at the time were grappling with multiple meanings of racial Chineseness, as “Chinese elites negotiated their way through myriad indigenous categories as well as the globally circulating norms of Western modernity to fashion an authentic, meaningful and practical form of identity.”68 Republican intellectuals from Liang Qichao (梁啟超) and Gu Jiegang (顧頡剛) to Lin Huixiang (林惠祥) and Zhang Xuguang (張旭光), in addressing similar issues of how to historicize the political unity of China’s current geobody with its racial heterogeneity, contemplated at least two competing paradigms. Some made use of Western racial theory to posit a homogenous single progenitor of the Han race and called for the maintenance of Han racial purity. Others argued that it was precisely China’s lineage diversity that had served as an ancient source of strength throughout its long history of physical interactions between Central Plains Han peoples and the “nomadic, seminomadic and swidden communities of the periphery,” and they called for the “infusion of fresh blood” (新血統的混入 xin xuetong de hunru) to continue to strengthen the Han core in the face of Japanese aggression and other threats to the Chinese geopolity.69 [End Page 257]\n\nA genealogical appraisal of Chen’s writings demonstrates how the problem became further complicated in considering the huaqiao, since it had to encompass populations living in “peripheries” beyond China’s territorial geobody. As Chen observed, in the South Seas, unlike within China, intermarriage could (and historically did) result in the peripheral vanishing rather than the improvement of the Chinese racial center. Chen’s theorizing of the persistence of Chinese characteristics among the huaqiao despite the facts he “observed” in his travels—their adoption of a great range of diverse cultural practices, their physical indistinguishability from turen, their ignorance of the Chinese language—enabled him to posit the continued benefits of emigrant Chinese for China by connecting their beneficial qualities to something beyond biology and even beyond culture. Though he theorized a category, qiaomin, that specifically differentiated these mixed-race communities from “pure” Chinese, he nonetheless drew them into a fantasy of Chineseness that was able to account for the attenuation of nearly every biological and cultural characteristic—“miscegenation,” changes in food habits, clothing and shelter habits, and even the loss or rejection of Chinese culture and language—and still claim them as part of his central thesis, that they were “elements” of positive social change and improvement for the Chinese core. It is worth noting too, finally, that Chen’s qiaomin category elides what would increasingly become a more salient distinction for Chinese emigrant communities in the South Seas, namely the distinction between, on the one hand, locally born “mixed-race” Chinese and, on the other hand, locally born “pure” Chinese, those who had not intermarried with turen but who nonetheless had, and wanted, little to do with China.70\n\nFact-Making and the Male Gaze\n\nAs an intellectual of the May Fourth generation, Chen was typically progressive in his views on women, and a significant proportion of his early research focused on women in the labor force and the social changes that were enabling their fuller participation.71 During his time in government service for the Guomindang, he witnessed the promulgation of its new civil code (1929–1930), which promoted marriage reform and particularly emphasized the need for monogamy and free choice in marital partners for women; indeed Chen explicitly viewed the Nationalist government as a source of “modern influence” with regard to marriage.72 In his 1938 study, one of the central components of his theory that emigrants were “elements of social change” was specifically gendered, namely that he regarded the social progress of women in emigrant districts as resulting from migrant influences. It was with regard to women that Chen made the distinction he did not with the qiaomin category, namely distinguishing between Chinese girls (中國婦人 Zhongguo furen) and foreign-born Chinese girls (南洋女子 Nanyang nüzi, 暹羅女子 Xianluo nüzi, or 僑生的中國女子 [End Page 258] qiaosheng de Zhongguo nüzi), who were, he suggested, more progressive in their outlook. Chen argued that these changes were largely due to “the attitude that the foreign-born Chinese daughter-in-law assumes toward her place in the household. She has either had a school education or has had experience of earning money as a girl. In either case, she has developed her personality in ways not accessible as a rule to girls in the Chinese village.”73 The “great majority” of rural women in China, Chen said, “have neither attended a modern school nor been overseas…socially, they are deemed inferior to men; and this inferiority is accepted by most women without protest.”74 Nanyang girls, he concluded, were more equal and free in their relations with Chinese men than the great majority of rural women in China, which gave them “a spirit of greater independence in the subsequent marriage relation.”75 This, Chen added, sometimes brought about crises within a family; he cited the case of a man introducing his foreign-born Chinese wife to the village family, who balked at her “clothes of a modern cut,” the fact that she had been to school, and the fact that, perhaps most appallingly, she had persuaded her husband to divide up the family property in China against customary practice.76\n\nOne clear differentiating factor that went largely unstated by Chen was that he was, in effect, contrasting urban Nanyang women with women from rural South China.77 This progressive, urban-biased view sits uneasily alongside what is perhaps the more lasting and influential aspect of his 1938 study, which is the principal exposition of the phenomenon of the liangtoujia (兩頭家 “dual-headed family” or “dual-headed household”). Chen’s study outlines the liangtoujia system as a system of transnational polygamy in which a male emigrant keeps wives and families both in his village of origin and in his host society, with principal, predominantly rural wives in the former and either “foreign-born Chinese girls” (南洋僑生女子 Nanyang qiaosheng nüzi) or Nanyang native women (南洋土人女子 Nanyang turen nüzi), predominantly urban, in the latter.78 This, Chen asserted, was a largely harmonious endeavor: “If the head of the family is staying abroad and intends to marry a concubine, his wife in the home village usually raises no objection”79 as long as he satisfies his financial obligations to both households. Chen stated that, on the whole, “mothers and wives in China often express themselves as entirely satisfied with the son’s or husband’s second matrimonial venture in the Nanyang.”80 Yet, Chen himself recognized this tension with his sympathies toward modern monogamy, admitting in passing that “not all the influences in respect to marriage that come from the Nanyang are necessarily in the [End Page 259] direction of progress,” since “the more influential emigrants tend to support concubinage and the dual marriage system.”81\n\nThe dissonance between these two views was also highlighted in the critiques of Francis Hsu, who accused Chen of willfully reading facts against what they said. Hsu pointed out that, in his view and based on his own research in Yunnan, successful returning migrants tended in fact to be even more traditional in their reinforcing of gender norms and the roles of women. Even on the basis of Chen’s own data, for all the distress that an overly modern foreign-born Chinese daughter-in-law might create when she went to (rural) China, such wives remained in a small minority—there were only 38 foreign-born wives among 846 marriage cases studied, which made his comments based on them little more than anecdotal.82 Lasker’s citation of Kenneth Chun’s correspondence also suggests that Chen might have been overlooking data regarding the “harmoniousness” of the trans-national polygamous relationship. As Chun wrote:\n\nAll too often, it is the chief breadwinner who has gone abroad, and he does not remit a single cent home. In such circumstances, the wife and children have to slave to keep body and soul together. Sometimes the emigrant is gone for many years without sending a word. Worse than that, he sometimes leaves a newly married wife in the village and then marries a native girl in the South Seas. Only God knows what mental anguish, forlorn hope, increased hardship these women have to undergo. In a number of cases, the women we interviewed broke down and wept. One of them begged us with tears to find her son for her.83\n\nThese field notes from Kenneth Chun reveal a key feature of Chen Da’s research, which is that by and large he did not conduct interviews himself. Indeed, as is clear from his field notes, Chen’s travels did take him to the South Seas, but he seems to have engaged almost exclusively with men: Chinese consuls, community leaders, entrepreneurs, businessmen, and teachers, as well as European colonial officials and missionaries and at least one IPR contact, Victor Purcell (1896–1965). His interlocutors were also exclusively from nonlaboring backgrounds. From the questions and conversations he recorded, it is clear that he was extremely interested in marriage practices in the Nanyang and in polygamy among the huaqiao. He made careful notes on Chinese marriages to Siamese women and on the forms of polygamy practiced by the Siamese, in which women were also entitled to property.84 From prominent Straits Chinese community members such as S. Q. Wong (1888–1980) and Lim Cheng Ean (1889–1987), he learned about the contemporary legal battles concerning monogamy and Chinese customary marriage. He recorded notes on the infamous Six Widows case decided in 1908 in the Supreme Court, in which it was ruled that, in the eyes of colonial law, polygamy was legal under Chinese “customary law” and thus Chinese could take concubines who might inherit property. He also noted a generational [End Page 260] shift in attitudes, namely that “the old acquiesced to this ruling, but the young opposed it,” and furthermore that qianmin openly took concubines, while qiaomin might have them, but not openly.85 In Penang and Singapore he noted the increase in “new-style marriages,”86 in modern matchmaking practices,87 and in the sociability of Chinese women, who even enjoyed going out dancing.88 In Solo, he met a Peranakan Chinese writer, Tjan Tjee Som (曾珠森 1903–1968), who furnished him with a Malay-language article he had written on the challenges that modern, “individualistic” Chinese women faced in marrying and finding jobs; Tjan translated the gist of it for him. Chen copied all of it into his notebook and was so taken with Tjan that he sought him out again in London the following year while on his European sabbatical.89 Thus, typically for Chinese intellectuals of the era, Chen appraised the question of women’s advancement and liberation through overwhelmingly male eyes.\n\nThe reliance on male testimony is especially problematic given that Chen’s travels coincided specifically with a time of escalating Chinese female labor migration, a phenomenon little touched upon in his empirical study. In 1931 Malaya’s Chinese female population was about 580,000, or roughly 34% of the whole Chinese population there; the second-highest count in the region was in Indonesia, about 465,000.90 In Siam in 1929, there were 131,500 women out of a total population of 445,000, a proportion of roughly 30%. W. L. Blythe estimated that the most intense period of Chinese female immigration to Malaya was from 1934, when the quota was imposed, to 1938, when a limit was placed on female immigrants—precisely the period when Chen was in the region.91 A similar story can be told for Siam, where the number of Chinese women increased by nearly 70% between 1929 and 1937.92 It should also be noted that the increase in Chinese female migrants was more than outweighed by the increase in locally born Chinese women. By 1921 locally born women already made up more than half the total number of Chinese females in Penang and Melaka, while in Kelantan they accounted for 90%. From 1931 onward, “the trend was clearly a steady increase in the number and proportion of locally born Chinese females until, by 1957, they constituted a majority in all states.”93 [End Page 261]\n\nHowever, despite Chen’s consistent and progressive attention to Chinese women’s labor, Chinese laboring women appear almost nowhere in Chen’s fieldwork diaries.94 Instead, in addition to male testimony gathered from fieldwork, Chen’s 1938 study (as well as his 1923 study) relied heavily on the use of district and prefectural gazetteers of Fujian and Guangdong as sources of information about Chinese family practices and norms concerning women, laboring or otherwise. Characteristic observations can be found in Chen’s sections on “culture traits”: in Quanzhou (泉州) “peasant women wear straw slippers and carry burdens…the gentlemen are seldom quick-witted”; in Chaozhou (潮州) “girls and women are chiefly engaged in embroidery” and are “seldom seen on the streets,” while “the gentlemen are simple in appearance and intelligent in spirit.”95 As the historian Bao Jiemin has observed, gazetteers are best understood as morally didactic and deeply ideological texts, aimed at establishing norms of gendered behavior rather than accurately reflecting men and women’s lives; an example is the way county gazetteers recorded cases of widow chastity and the filial piety displayed by “exemplary wives” (烈女 lienü) toward their mothers-in-law when their emigrant husbands died.96 Chen’s use of male fieldwork testimony might be understood as representing a modernized version of this practice, and in some respects he was just as embedded in a particular moral universe as the compilers of gazetteers were.\n\nTo take just one example, Chen’s travel notes on Zhanglin and its women have a faint echo of the didactic, moralizing gazetteers:\n\nThe women in Zhanglin take care of housework at home and do all the physical labor outside, such as carrying burdens, removing grass, and cutting rice…. Women seem to work harder than men. One reason is because many of the men of working age are already in the Nanyang, and another is because of local habits [本地的習慣 bendi de xiguan]…. The local women are natural-footed [添足 tianzu]…. Huaqiao families often have women who take care of household duties and assume various responsibilities.\n\nThere are few men residing in Zhanglin, and those who are there are usually the old and the young. Among them are…depraved elements, the lazy and the unambitious; these useless youths depend on remittances from the Nanyang and have the bad habit of sitting in teahouses, gambling and smoking opium. These men do not work and are often lazy; passing the years in a trance, they are generally unpromising people. As for the more ambitious and risk-taking men, they have largely crossed [End Page 262] the sea to become sojourners [番客 fanke; literally, “barbarian guests”]. Those who stay in the village are physically weak and mentally ill.97\n\nThese assertions updated China’s moral universe according to Chen: exemplary emigrant families had strong, household-leading women who worked hard, while ambitious and risk-taking men went abroad and remitted money home. In addition, the new lienü were the exemplary women who stayed behind, the fankeshen (番客婶 left-behind wife), who would be “an intelligent younger woman [who] often fully appreciates why it is desirable or even necessary for her husband to have another wife overseas” or, more rarely, might maintain household harmony and live in complete accord with a foreign wife brought back to the village by the returning husband.98 But in reality, the highly idealized viewpoint expressed here, and woven by Chen into empirical social fact, obscured ground-level realities of women’s actual lives, as the handful of subsequent studies of women’s much-less-than-harmonious experiences of the liangtoujia system have demonstrated. Instead, women’s and girls’ experiences of the liangtoujia system ranged widely across complex and layered forms of servitude, child betrothal, marriage, concubinage, abandonment, and estrangement, as well as a wide range of experiences of support and oppression within the larger in-law familial unit—all of which was enormously complicated by the inadequacy of the legal mechanisms that governed those relations to the task of transnational protection.99 Even at the time, the divergence between empirical realities and Chen’s ideological viewpoint could be discerned in the slippages between what he wrote and what he (or rather his researchers) saw. To return to Kenneth Chun’s reports, as quoted by Lasker:\n\nAmong those fortunate emigrants who have been able to accumulate sufficient savings for a new house, built and furnished partly in foreign style [洋樓 yanglou], the women have the work done for them by girl servants, while they themselves hobble around on their tiny feet.100\n\nThe layers of power relations within the familial unit, alluded to here by Chun, appear nowhere in Chen’s study, and were, given Chen’s methodology, likely either invisible to him during his travels among men or deemed by him to be irrelevant to his objective of assessing the influence emigrants had on their home villages. In this respect, Chen’s ideas about modern emigrant women and the transformation of the traditional family unit were in the end—and much like the ideas of his gazetteer-writing predecessors—deeply patriarchal in their assumptions and more normative than empirical in their conclusions.
