The school had a humble start where it only rented a two-story shop lot as its classroom without a building of its own.\n\nIn 1922, the school was named Chung Hwa School and only 16 years later in 1938, the school made a major breakthrough with its own premises situated at Jalan Bendahara (approximately the vacant space of the current Parliament)\n\nIn 1940, Kapitan China Ong Boon Pang passed away peacefully after chairing the school board for 22 years and his great contribution in laying a solid foundation for the school is still remember and much appreciated.\n\nIn 1954, Lim Teck Hoo was elected as the new School Board.\n\nIn 1955, the school commenced its secondary level and changed its name to Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB.\n\nIn 1957, the government of Brunei subsidised the school and paid for the teachers’ salary, administration cost and the construction cost of the basic school facilities. Moreover, free lunch, and later changed into free beverage, was provided to fellow students from 1959 to 1969.\n\nIn 1959, a comprehensive learning curriculum was successfully implemented at the school with its upper secondary level introduced in 1959. The total student population surged, surpassing the 1000 benchmark.\n\nIn 1962, one two-storey building was completed with the financing from both government and donation from the community. In 1962, the school launched its kindergarten level.\n\nIn 1968, a stadium was in completion.\n\nIn 1970, the government withdrawing its financial support to the school fomented financial constraints in the Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB. The crisis was solved after the Tiong Hwa Community volunteered to support the school in a form of monthly donation and the kind benefaction provided by the philanthropic Kapitan China Awang Lim Teck Hoo and other board members.\n\nIn 1971, the medium of instruction was changed to English for Upper Secondary Science Streams.\n\nIn 1972, the school was honoured when Al-Marhum Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien Sa’adul Khairi Waddin consented to officiate the 50th school anniversary. At the same time, a four-storey building was completed to cater for the needs of its secondary students.\n\nIn 1974, in line with the national policy, Friday was declared a weekend holiday. The school syllabus was adapted to echo the national syllabus where English and Bahasa Melayu were taught to primary students. After 1975, the medium of instruction of the school, except Mandarin, Bahasa Melayu, History, Music, Physical Education (PE), Arts and Moral, was aptly changed to English.\n\nIn 1975, the school embraced teachers assigned by the government to teach Bahasa Melayu for primary level and their salary was shouldered by the government.\n\nIn 1976, Chung Hwa students, instead of sitting for the internal exams set by the school, opt for GCE O’ Level.\n\nIn 1978, the school marked a glorious history and established its name when its students scored the public exams such as the PCE and BJCE with flying colours\n\nIn 1982, a three-storey building was built to cater for the needs of kindergarten pupil.
