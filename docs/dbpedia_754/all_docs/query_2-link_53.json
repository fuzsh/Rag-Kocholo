I also felt that it is important to learn Chinese to better communicate with people from China.”\n\nYear 6 Lia Sarker said, “It is really good to know another language like Chinese. I was inspired by my godmother who is Chinese and has taken care of me since I was a baby. Chinese language is being used almost everywhere, so its very convenient to know to how to speak it.”"
