        "text": "This study compares and contrasts Chinese education in two typical multicultural and multiethnic countries in the world - Malaysia and US. Both countries have a large number of Chinese ethnic population, however, the status of Chinese language and culture in two countries was different. In the US, retaining Chinese language and culture for the second and beyond generation Chinese immigrants was largely considered to be a failed mission and Chinese heritage language loss seemed inevitable, while in Malaysia, the Chinese ethnic groups successfully maintained its heritage language and culture in the K-12 schools’ system and mainstream society. This study explores reasons why the Chinese ethnic groups in Malaysia did a relatively better job in retaining their Chinese ethnic language and culture in the Malaysian K-12 school system while Chinese immigrants in the US often failed to do so. The result of this study indicates that political engagement and political influence of immigrants’ communities in their destination country played a crucial role in sustaining their heritage language and culture in the school system and mainstream society of their destination country.\n\nIn light of the ‘methodological cosmopolitanism’ of Ulrich Beck and Natan Sznaider (2006), this thesis aims to investigate the multiplicity of Chineseness produced in the Chinese schools in the Philippines. The study draws on participant observation based on my one-year teaching in a Philippine-Chinese school, on-site interviews with students, parents, administrators, educationalists and officials, and archival and documentary research. The major findings of the study reveal that: (i) viewed from different perspectives, three versions of Chineseness generated in Chinese school emerge: Huaqiao Chineseness with the nationalistic view of China as the motherland embodied by the traditional teaching approach involved in ‘teaching Mandarin as a national language’; Huaren Chineseness which proposes to seek a balance between the younger generations’ Mandarin learning and Filipino outlook; ‘communal Chineseness for integration’ by which the younger generations are provided with community-bas...\n\nThe aim of this study is to examine the ways in which sociopolitical factors affect why and how adults in Britain learn Mandarin Chinese. As China’s global influence grows, so too does the popularity and instrumental value of Mandarin Chinese as a taught foreign language. Understanding why and how adult learners of Mandarin Chinese choose to study the language and use it will be critical for developing effective and sustainable programs for teaching Mandarin Chinese to diverse populations. In this mixed-methods study, which consisted of short semi-structured interviews and an anonymous online survey, I approached adult learners of Mandarin Chinese at a Chinese Language Exchange, or CLE, at a London university’s Confucius Institute. To identify more participants for the online survey, I asked interviewees if they knew other learners who may be interested in the study. I also recruited survey respondents through a classmate who was also researching adult learners of Mandarin Chinese. In conjunction with the quantitative survey and qualitative interviews, I conducted a literature review of Confucius Institute promotional content and previous studies of Mandarin Chinese learners and language learning motivation. These three approaches have revealed the profound effects that social and political discourse, in particular Orientalism, have had on Mandarin learning motivation, access to learning resources, and on the ways learners perceive themselves as members of the Mandarin speech community. I argue that while learning resources for adults are expanding and diversifying, particularly in the realm of educational technology, negative sociopolitical discourses about Mandarin Chinese and insufficient opportunities for exposure are barriers to achieving proficiency.\n\nPrimary school is the first place where children receive formal education which includes basic reading, writing, arithmetic, as well as thinking skills. Thus, primary education is extremely crucial in a child’s life as it provides the foundation to literacy. With the various types of school available in Malaysia, parents have choices when deciding which school to send their children to. This study investigated the reasons why Malay parents send their children to Chinese medium school, the challenges faced by the children in the school and their academic performance. The case study involved all 20 Malay students studying in Primary 6 of a rural Chinese medium school in Kuching-Sarawak and their parents. Extensive semi-structured interviews were carried out with the parents focusing on their reasons for choosing to send their children to the school, while the interview with the students focused on the challenges they faced in the school. The students’ UPSR results were used as a measu...\n\nChinese language education in Indonesia is closely related to the social, political, and cultural dimensions of the country. The change of power in the country in 1998 affected the development of Chinese language. Since the ban imposed on Chinese language and culture since 1965 was lifted, there have been an increasing number of Chinese language schools. Under the theoretical frameworks of Gardner’s motivational orientations and Bourdieu’s cultural capital, this study explored varied motivations of Chinese Indonesians to learn Chinese, and how their perception of China influenced their efforts in learning the language. Data were obtained through focus group discussions and interviews. The findings showed that integrative and instrumental orientations were found among participants, but due to the learners’ social milieu, instrumentality of Chinese dominated their orientations. The instrumentality of Chinese and the positive perception of China worked together to make Chinese language...\n\nBilingual policy in Singapore has been characterized by dynamic government interventions since the nation’s independence in 1965. The elevation of English to the medium of instruction in education has inevitably come into conflict with Chinese, thelingua francaof Singapore’s dominant ethnic group. Drawing upon a theoretical perspective of prestige language planning, we show that the Chinese language has gradually lost prestige in Singaporean society in general, and in particular it has lost ground to English in terms of linguistic capital. A succinct re-examination of Singapore’s language-in-education planning shows that education alone cannot arrest the declining status of the Chinese language, neither does any image-fostering. The study highlights the importance of prestige promotion for the future success of Chinese language maintenance. The rapid rise of China provides an enabling environment for prestige manipulation. However, the socio-political goals of the Singaporean biling..."
