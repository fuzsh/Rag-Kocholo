        "text": "NACS 2017: CHINA TIME\n\nRETHINKING CULTURAL ENCOUNTERS\n\nAbstracts\n\nAmblard Bérangère IETT, Lyon, France\n\nHow China Stole the Idea of Contemporary Art: Chinese Contemporary Art and the Chinese Invention\n\nIn How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art, Serge Guilbaut demonstrates that the cultural centre shifting from Paris to New York in the 1950s does not only rely on artistic reasons but is also due to ideological ones1. He argues that avant-gardes were used to serve the renovating of the United States’ global image. I claim that contemporary art in China was objet to a similar hijacking; that it is both a symptom and a tool of a country that is fashioning its identity, reinventing its past and inventing its future.\n\nSince the 2000s in China, as in the United States during the 1950s, the government financially supports the development and promotion of artistic creation. Moreover, the Chinese government uses contemporary art as a means for differentiating, as part of the soft power. As recalled by Paul Gladston, in 2000, Jiang Zemin asserted publicly that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) should be the leading force of Chinese culture, stating that the People Republic of China (PRC) should aim to be a powerful nation not only politically and economically, but also culturally. Similarly, in 2004, Hu Jintao, stressed the importance of economic and cultural diplomacy.\n\nI intend to question the link there is between the recent acknowledgment of the value of contemporary art by the Chinese government and its ambition of projecting Chinese power internationally.\n\nAmy Matthewson\n\nYounghy-Bung-Boo-Hoo: He Hurtee me Welly Much! British Construction of ‘Chineseness’ in Punch Magazine, 1894\n\nThis paper focuses on one image along with its accompanying poem that was published in 1894 in Punch Magazine, a popular British satirical journal. The image and text are both entitled “A Touching Appeal” and make fun of a Chinese man named Younghy-Bung-Boo-Hoo when he starts a fight but then loses to a much smaller but stronger Japaneseman. In the background, Western nations stand and watch with John Bull of Britain lookingparticularly displeased. Of note is the ‘voice’ given to the Chinese and Japanese men in theaccompanying poem. The Chinese man ‘speaks’ in pidgin English whilst the Japanese man ‘speaks’ in grammatically-correct English.\n\nThe image and text were created during the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-1895, one of the most significant events that brought international attention to China’s weakened position within the global community. While Japan was recognized as a rising power, China was humiliated and ridiculed. Situating the image within the visual and textual frameworks of understanding prevalent at the time, I examine both the satirical depiction and the significance of the use of pidgin English. I approach the magazine as a site where opinions and attitudes were both formed and reflected and this paper considers historical perceptions of China and the Chinese and the ways in which these humiliations are remembered in contemporary China.\n\nAndreas Steen\n\n”Shanghai Jazz”: History, Memory and Politics\n\n100 years ago, in January 1917, the “Original Dixieland Jazz Band” recorded the first jazz records in New York. The record sold one million copies within a year and was a sensation. Jazz went around the world, also to Shanghai. By the end of the 1920s, Chinese audiences and composers began to embrace American jazz both as a new modern urban life-style and a commercially attractive musical genre. During the following two decades, Chinese jazz songs reached their heyday and jazz turned into a popular, though controversial genre. Until 1949, people in Shanghai went on “swinging” and jazz in China became strongly associated with that city.\n\nThis paper refers to the history of jazz in Shanghai, yet it is more concerned with people’s memory and the question of how China’s jazz age is reconstructed and remembered today. To answer this question, and to explore the meaning of “Shanghai Jazz”, I will refer to individuals and institutions that shape its present discourse. Politically, and as cultural heritage, I argue, Shanghai’s old jazz is as entertaining and controversial as it has always been.\n\nAndreea Chirita\n\nPerformance Encounters: China’s contemporary avant-garde performance on the Western stage\n\nThis study investigates the impact that the aesthetics of performance elaborated by Beijing Theatre Studio “Paper Tiger” had on the Western stage, from a transcultural perspective. In the context in which most Western theatrical venues and festivals host performances of Chinese traditional opera hybridized within Western postdramatic techniques, the “Paper Tiger Studio” engages in cross-cultural dialogue with a totally different aesthetic attitude; their avant-garde performance practices resist essentialism as they return to the epistemological Chinese tradition (Confucianism, Daoism and Chan Buddhism) and select exactly those elements that respond to the psychological needs of the contemporary world, enriching and helping the Western avant-garde postdramatic performance discourse to move forward. The “Paper Tiger” thus challenges the local-global domineering paradigm of the present glocal discourse and puts all cultures involved in cross-cultural performance on equal dialogical positions.\n\nThe analysis focuses on the performance of Totally Happy 非常高兴, staged at Munich Kammerspiele in 2014 and The Decalogue 十诫, a Chinese-Polish co-production staged at The Stary Theatre in Cracow, in 2016. The study follows comparatively the performance aesthetics brought forth by both sides on stage, underlining the common ground they manage to find by rethinking and engaging into a theatre praxis dialogue on equal terms. Performance as ‘happening’ and performance as effective social engagement are among the results the cultural parties involved come up with.\n\nAne Bislev\n\nOpen Sesame – China’s online credit rating system\n\nIn 2014, the Chinese Government announced its intention of creating a “social credit rating system” to be implemented in 2020. So far, we have little concrete knowledge about its concrete content. However, it appears that the system will combine a general evaluation of an individual’s “trustworthiness” with a more traditional credit rating score. The need for this social credit system springs from several sources, among them a general fear that public morale is in decline, and a wish to facilitate a shift away from personalized trust to an institutionalized trust expressed in a simple credit score. Also, less than a third of China’s 800 million potential bank customers have been registered in the central CRC (Credit Registry Center) making it very difficult for the remaining 560 million to be approved for formal credit. Intriguingly, the system will thus combine the very practical need for a widespread central credit rating system with a tightening of political controls.\n\nAs a precursor for the coming centralized system, several private companies have been allowed to set up private credit rating systems, addressing a lacuna in the Chinese financial landscape where only a minority of potential bank customers are covered by the existing credit rating system. This paper will discuss one of these systems, Ant Financial’s online credit rating system called Sesame Credit. Sesame Credit was launched in 2015, and provides a credit score using a system that assigns points between 350 – 950 to individuals, similar to the US/UK Fico scores. However, there is a major difference between the basis on which these points are assigned. While a Fico score is based on five elements all related to an individual’s financial history (e.g. credit history and types of credit), a Sesame credit score incorporates less tangible factors like behavior, spending habits, social status, and the credit scores of members of your network. Sesame Credit thereby places itself in an interesting nexus between a purely financial service and a more general evaluation of the trustworthiness of an individual. This paper will discuss various frameworks for understanding and contextualizing Sesame Credit and examines Sesame Credit’s online presentation and reception.\n\nAntónio Barrento\n\nTo an Ideal Place: Journeys to the West in the China Traveler, 1927-1937\n\nDuring the Nanjing Decade, interest in tourism and tourist practice expanded in Republican China, in line with worldwide trends and as a result of a number of internal factors that encouraged leisure travel. In this context, tourism to Europe and to North America became more of a possibility for a few of the more affluent travellers. Such a category of tourism was only a small fraction of the overall phenomenon in China but, while it was so, it was an important focus in the China Traveler, a monthly publication of the China Travel Service, the largest travel agency of this period in the country.\n\nThis paper examines the emphasis that was placed placed on these destinations in this magazine and in particular the ways in which the West was idealized as an outbound tourist destination. It also attempts to understand this process of idealization by looking simultaneously into the lure of the modern and of the foreign in China at the beginning of the twentieth century and into the business motivations of the China Travel Service. Finally, it analyses the ways in which the idealization of the West as a tourist destination was being combined with nationalistic considerations that were more generally making their way into the domain of tourism and which ultimately were used as a justification for travel to the West as an ideal place.\n\nBirgitte Egeskov Jensen\n\nAdapting to a ‘new’ culture of elder care – An individual-level study of filial obligations in the Chinese familialist culture, when migrating to ‘new’ cultures\n\nCulture encompasses a system of meanings, norms and values – it determines whether and how individuals will make use of the institutions and welfare benefits available to them. Individuals have, and share, norms and expectations about how society should care for their elders – and whether family or state should supply this care. In China, filial piety has remained a cornerstone of elder care for at least 2000 years. However, recent demographic development has forced Chinese policy makers to reform the Chinese pension system and shift the responsibility between the three institutional pillars of welfare: family, state and market. Despite this, the people’s confidence in the public pension system has been rapidly eroding, and the notion of filial piety, a major virtue of the Chinese traditional culture, has been re-emphasized in the Chinese society.\n\nUsing the 2016 ‘Migrants’ Welfare State Attitudes’ survey, this article aims at discussing how individuals from the Chinese familialist culture adapt their behavior according to existing old-age policies and institutions when migrating to a social-democratic or a corporatist welfare state, respectively Denmark and Germany. The demographic transition in China has sparked a need for and interest in new policy developments within the field of long-term care and the subject has emerged as a scientifically and politically relevant issue. The research presented in this article will contribute to the debate by offering an alternative perspective into Chinese citizen’s conformity when faced with new cultures of care, and thereby potentially uncover barriers to further reform impetus concerning Chinese old-age policies.\n\nBrian Moloughney\n\nCosmopolitan Sinology in Peking, 1919-1937\n\nThis paper explores the role cosmopolitan intellectuals living in Peking in the 1920s and 1930s played in transforming the study of China, both in China itself and in the West. Chinese scholars were by this time participating in the internationalisation of Sinology, often studying overseas before returning to the new Chinese universities to reshape what they called guoxue (‘national studies’ or Sinology). At the same time, foreign scholars were spending extended periods in Peking, often starting with language instruction at the College of Chinese Studies, and then working with Chinese colleagues to develop their chosen fields of study. After returning from China they founded new Chinese studies programmes in Western universities, programmes that either didn’t exist before or which had previously been staffed by retired missionaries and diplomats. In this paper, I argue that it was the sustained interaction between Chinese and Western scholars during this period that was critical for both the creation of modern China studies in the West and for the formation of post- Confucian academic scholarship within China itself. As an illustration of the wider thesis, I will explore the collaboration between the Estonian scholar Alexander von Staël-Holstein, who lived in Peking from 1916 until his death in 1937, and famous polymath Chen Yinke.\n\nCecilia Milwertz\n\nAre Nordic gender studies scholars interested in meeting scholars from China?\n\nExperiences from the Sino-Nordic Gender Studies Network 2002-2016 and prospects for joint studies of interconnectedness in the context of the global crisis of humanity\n\nSince 2002 the Sino-Nordic Gender Studies Network has invited gender studies scholars from the People’s Republic of China and the Nordic countries to meet up every three years at conferences held alternately in China and one of the Nordic countries. The importance attached to the three conferences held in China is reflected by their inclusion in a list of ‘Post 1995 Major Events on Gender Equality and Women’s Rights in China’ compiled by the Beijing based Columbia Global Centre based on input from feminist activists and scholars. Meanwhile, Nordic scholars have been less interested in meeting their Chinese colleagues. This paper investigates the encounters of Nordic and Chinese gender studies academics from two angles: First of all the paper is based on my own experience as co-initiator and coordinator of the network. Second, I talk with Nordic gender studies scholars who have hosted and/or attended the conferences. The aim is to understand their interest in the conferences, what they gained from the encounter with scholars from China and how they interpret the disparity between the interest expressed by scholars in China and the Nordic countries. The overall aim of the paper is to address the questions of 1) dynamics between differently located gender studies feminisms and 2) whether or not feminisms from different parts of the world can communicate and build alliances with a view to changing unequal local and global relations – specifically in view of the encounters with other parts of the world that relate to China’s globalizing strategies.\n\nChen Yihai\n\nDifferent Beds, Different Dreams: A Comparison between Chinese Dream and American Dream\n\nEverybody has his dreams, but when the “dream” is used as a symbol of a certain nation and people or a certain historical period, or as a nation’s development policy, it will be an issue of both politics and intercultural studies. When we compare and differentiate the American Dream and the Chinese Dream, we may have a better understanding of them; and when we study this issue, many aspects of the two sides’ culture can also be revealed.\n\nChristian Nordvall\n\nLegge’s invention of an English terminology for Confucian society\n\nThe British conquest of Hong Kong gave Europeans much greater access to the Chinese literary and cultural heritage than had previously been possible in Macau and Guangzhou. The first decades after the conquest saw the first complete English translation of the Four Books and Five Classics, by the missionary and later Oxford professor James Legge (1815-1897). As there were very few English translations of Chinese literature to guide Legge’s efforts, he and his fellow missionaries were left to their own devices to find appropriate English equivalents not just for lofty philosophical concepts like “filial piety” (xiao 孝) and “the mandate of heaven” (tian ming 天命), but also for more everyday things like the titles of officials, articles of clothing, food etc. In making his widely read translation Legge helped create not just a vocabulary for talking about Confucianism, but for talking about Confucian societies generally. This paper will look at which domesticating strategies Legge employed to make the initially alien Chinese world intelligible to the English reader, with a focus on the political and institutional rather than the philosophical. For instance how tian zi 天子 became initially “emperor” and then “son of heaven”, tian xia 天下“empire” and then “world” and gong 公 “duke”.\n\nDoris Weidemann\n\nChina’s growing role in global science – Rethinking German-Chinese science cooperation\n\nGerman universities have been slow to develop research ties with China. In an effort to mobilise academic resources to meet the “Chinese challenge” the German ministry of education and research launched a policy initiative in 2015 that aims to promote German- Chinese research cooperation. This initiative is a highly visible response to China’s growing role in global science and can be regarded as an appeal to the German science community to (re-)consider their attitude towards China. The proposed talk will share insights into changing German perceptions of China as a research partner, as unfolded in newspaper articles, policy papers and interviews with scholars who are engaged in German-Chinese research projects. It will be demonstrated that China’s rise to academic excellence is posing new challenges to a research community which is being confronted with a previously little known international partner and competitor. These include arising questions relating to academic power, social identity, (dis)trust, cultural distance, and intercultural competence which need to be negotiated on institutional and interpersonal levels. The analysis of German-Chinese research cooperation that will be presented reveals how cross-cultural encounters are changing in practice and serves as a starting point for rethinking hitherto established cross-cultural concepts and theory.\n\nErkki Viitasaari\n\nSTANDING THEIR GROUNDS AMONG GIANTS –National Identity in National Museums of Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore\n\nIn my PhD thesis I study how nation-building and the post-colonial quest to construct a national identity is visible in the national museums of three peculiar areas. Hong Kong, a former British Crown Colony, and Macau, a former Portuguese colony, became autonomous Special Administrative Regions (SAR) of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1997 and 1999 respectively. Singapore, another former British Crown Colony, with a two thirds Chinese population became independent in 1965.\n\nIn Hong Kong and Macau a deconstruction of colonial identity or mainlandization is taking place. A shift from colonial identity toward SAR identity is taking place and the new identity needs to be backed by a common history that emphasises the special, but predominantly Chinese, features of the regions. Singapore’s ambitious and thorough nation-building project has been successful, but flaws exist. Museums of the 21st century have to adjust themselves to the wide array of information available through competing media and interact with the increasingly educated guests. National museums strive to fulfil their missions of creating a feeling of unity for the locals and a desired international image for visitors.\n\nIn this presentation I will scratch the surface of issues related to how these three areas distinguish themselves in a larger Chinese/Southeast Asian context. Despite existing in close proximity of the PRC, Macau and Hong Kong differ culturally from their overwhelming neighbour. Similarly, Singapore stands out between Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nGao Man\n\nTeaching and Learning Chinese as a Foreign Language in Sweden\n\nChina’s international presence has increased significantly in recent years. As a reflection of China’s growing impact, the interest in the Chinese language is on the rise. There has been a rapid expansion in the teaching and learning of Chinese as a foreign language, particularly in North America and Europe. Such developments are also noticeable in Sweden, perhaps not so surprisingly since Sweden is a heavily export-oriented economy. In Sweden most universities and some university colleges today offer Chinese courses, and recently 1,000 high school students receive grades in Chinese every year. Politicians have raised the status of Chinese within the national school system to a level so far only awarded to English, Spanish, French and German. However, the endeavor to teach Chinese as a foreign language in Sweden faces a different set of challenges than, for instance, the teaching of English does. This presentation aims to introduce the current situation in Sweden including some of the characteristics of and opportunities for Chinese teaching in Swedish schools and universities. Based on a questionnaire given to Swedish students of Chinese and interviews with teachers of Chinese in Sweden, various needs, challenges and potential remedies for teaching Chinese in Sweden and Nordic countries are furthermore discussed.\n\nGe Ling\n\nThe poetics and politics of sustainable design- an ethnography of Design Harvest\n\nWhile contemporary design practices in the west have evolved from the conventional “designing for” users towards the more collaborative modes of “designing with” in conjunction with the emerging design practices termed as “social”, “sustainable” and/ or “critical”, co-design remains at its infancy in China. This paper presents an ethnographic account of an on-going sustainable design project Design Harvest based in a rural community on Chongming Island, Shanghai. Design Harvest, as developed through international co-design workshops and materialised in the designed services and products, claims to take a bottom-up design approach to the sustainable development of China by promoting urban-rural interactions and rejuvenating rural economy. Yet, just as the issue of sustainability involves political negotiations at all levels, sustainable design is inherently a political act. This paper examines how the “politics of sustainability” manifests itself in this project and how we can make sense of it in the contemporary socio-political context of China. The field materials are gathered through participant observation and interviews in both the rural village and in Shanghai. Drawing on theories of cultural reproduction, modernity and nostalgia, this paper argues that the “politics of sustainability”, as manifested in the socially distinct and nostalgic reproduction and consumption of the tangible and intangible rural culture, can be considered as the reflection of Chinese urban middle class’ fundamentally ambivalent ways of life, one being the disenchantment of the rationalised modern life, the other the nostalgic indulgence of the imagined rural past and present.\n\nGiulia Rampolla\n\nGlobal youth or cultural avant-garde? Post-80’s fiction as result of cultural encounters\n\nThis paper analyzes fictional writing of Chinese authors born in the 80’s of 20th century, thus belonging to a generation commonly referred to with the long debated definition of ‘post-80’s’, in the perspective of the cross-cultural encounters and even cross-temporal influences that determine their writing style. Considered that these writers are not beginners anymore, and so can’t be only read as commercial youth phenomena, a more objective evaluation of their literary work is today possible. I will than assume that their literary production is the result of multiple, somehow even discordant cultural encounters, that mirror nowadays pluralist world and appear melted together in their narrative language and fiction, giving shape to their unique style. Among these encounters, we can mention globalization culture, urban life styles, mass-media and technology and, at least for some of these authors, also with cultural elements belonging to the previous decades, not latter modernism, experimentalism and avant-garde spirit of the 80’s, as we can see in novels and short stories by writers such as Xiao Fan, Li Shasha and Zhang Jiawei. Furthermore, all these cultural interactions are differently indebted to western culture, but yet bring strong indigenous features and, from a literary point of view, this whole layout reveals the quality of postmodernism. During my presentation, after a theoretical introduction, I will concretely analyze some representative works of post-80’s writers with the aim of showing the narrative and linguistic features determined by these cultural influences.\n\nHenrik Kloppenborg Møller\n\nTypologies and Analogies in Chinese Valuation of Burmese Jadeite\n\nBased on fieldwork among traders of Burmese jadeite (feicui 翡翠) in China’s Yunnan Province, this paper examines relations between material properties of jadeite, vernacular classification and nomenclature, and value creation in the Chinese market economy. While social scientists often discuss value in terms of production, exchange, and consumption, I focus here on the conceptual packaging, or ‘sorting out’, of jadeite into different types, as well as classifications of their common characteristics and their relations to humans. As gemmological tests can only establish the compliance of a stone to the criteria for belonging to the generic category of jadeite, particular types and characteristics of jadeite stones are diversified through perceptive evaluation methods of sight, sound, and touch. Types and characteristics are measured along different parameters that include colour and colour composition; transparency; translucency; sound pitch; place of origin or mining; age; inclusions; skin texture; exposure of internal content; carving templates, styles, and execution, and so on. These evaluation parameters sustain typologies of differences in authenticity, quality, and value of jadeite. Meanwhile, vernacular jadeite nomenclatures also establish sameness through analogies between the properties of jadeite, and properties of both other nonhumans, and humans. The paper seeks to demonstrate how such conceptual constructions of differences and sameness in Chinese classifications of jadeite work to bring hierarchies of value that underpin markets into effect. is a PhD candidate at the Department of Sociology, Lund University.\n\nJesper Willaing Zeuthen\n\nUrban Development for Whom? Changing Forms of Urbanization in Chengdu, China\n\nIn Chengdu, like in most other Chinese mega-cities, urbanization has been very fast the last three decades. The fast urbanization challenges China’s agricultural production. In the current phase of urbanization, in Chengdu alone, around 900,000 villagers have been resettled to urban looking communities in order to release space for new arable land and justify continued urbanization closer to the city. This paper studies this new phase of urbanization in the countryside and compares it with the way urbanization took place in rural communities closer to the city in the past. Focus is on the institutions regulating changed use of land when communities shift from rural to urban. In the current phase of urbanization far from the city centre, politically decided plans bargained far from rural communities play a much larger role than they did in earlier phases of urbanization closer to the city. China being an authoritarian or at least semi-authoritarian state, the political nature of contestation on the rural fringe of Chengdu gives considerably less room for local communities to affect institutional change than earlier urbanization processes on the urban fringe did. Though the fast state controlled process means more formal regulations than in the past, it also means less credible institutions, because regulations may change almost over night as a result of political decisions on which local communities have no influence. In the current situation, the paper argues, the high degree of state control contributes to preserve old rural property rights institutions.\n\nJona Barabas\n\n“What do my emotions matter if mother is sad?” Filial Piety, Heteronormative Obligations, and Social Exchanges in Beijing Gushi\n\nA classic among queer works of literature written in Chinese, Beijing Gushi was one of the first Chinese novels to openly portray homosexual relationships in modern time. Given the first publication of an English translation of the novel in 2016, this paper is an attempt to shed some light on the particular connection between filial piety and queer identity in Sinophone communities, alongwith other unique cultural traits that make queer experiences in Sinophone societies different from their Euro-American counterparts. The paper is based on a Master thesis that examines how the main character in Beijing Gushi, Chen Handong, maintains his most important relationships in the novel, what factors determine his relational choices, and how he carries out the processes of social exchange to attain desired relational outcomes. By use of a theoretical framework based on queer theory and social exchange theory – particularly concepts from the works of Judith Butler and George C. Homans – I argue that traditional expectations connected to filial piety constitute the primary element that guides the main character’s actions, but that he simultaneously attempts to reduce the stress these expectations place on him through the maintaining of other kinds of relationships. Furthermore, I find that heteronormativity and material gifts also play significant roles in the character’s managing of his social life.\n\nJørgen Delman\n\nLuring the elephants back? Eco-civilization and the pressure for green urban development in Hangzhou\n\nThis paper asks how local green development is stimulated though new governance instruments in Hangzhou. The paper argues that the eco-civilization framework has become an overarching concept for green or sustainable development, i.e. to restore order and balance to the Chinese ecology to safeguard future generations. The paper updates previous work on eco-civilization construction and governance innovations in Hangzhou. The local field is increasingly politicized in response to central policies, and the room for local maneuvering is becoming increasingly regulated. Generally, the Party and state system seems to be taking more control of itself as an organization and of its agents to promote green development. The local green regulations are becoming increasingly specific and more and more measurable, and a new public management system with performance reviews and results management procedures based on key performance indicators and with assessments by the public are meant to improve policy implementation, also in the environmental field. It is observed how the city authorities respond to central and popular pressure by opening up to these external participation and assessment. This approach is seen as a key instrument to stimulate policy compliance and enhance government transparency and public accountability. However, the system of implementation still needs improvement, especially with regard to evidence based assessments of progress, compliance and effectiveness in the eco-civilization field. The evidence indicates that this approach has had some effect on narrowing the implementation gap in environmental politics.\n\nJyrki Kallio\n\nEncountering China’s Strategic Narrative\n\nChina’s leadership wants to “tell China’s story well”. In other words, China needs to have a strategic narrative laying down the development path, the values and the goals of the nation. Internationally, China needs a strategic narrative that underlines its peacefulness. Domestically, the people’s trust in the leaders’ capability to fulfill the fruition of the Chinese Dream needs to be bolstered. The narrative uses China’s historical narrative, China’s traditional worldview, and the Chinese Dream, as its building blocks. The strategic narrative aims to change perceptions about China abroad, but it also reveals China’s perceptions about the world, especially “the West” which is blamed for humiliating China, when weak, and defaming it, when strong. The West is also regarded the birthplace of “universal values” and the prevailing world order.\n\nIn 2015, China issued an Outline of National Security Strategy, the first of its kind. The document has not been made public, but some if its content has been referenced in the state media. There seems to be a strong emphasis on the “security of ideology” which is linked with a tendency to see national security in terms of internal peace and stability of governance, anbang-dingguo (安邦定国). This is said to be challenged by the West. This paper maps out China’s strategic narrative and compares its themes with China’s national security strategy in order to reveal the current ideational drivers in China’s relations with the West.\n\nKirk Denton\n\nDo Private Museums Offer Space for Alternative History? The Jianchuan Museum Cluster, Anren, Sichuan\n\nIn this presentation, I examine the issue of whether a private history museum can assert memories that are normally proscribed in the highly controlled context of the single-party state in China. The museum in question is the Jianchuan Museum Cluster, a private museum complex in Sichuan founded by the real estate entrepreneur Fan Jianchuan in 2005 that contains 28 museums divided into four “series”—the War of Resistance series, the Red Era series, the Earthquake series, and the Folk series.\n\nThe paper focuses on the Red Era series and analyzes the techniques Fan and his curators use to negotiate among commercial motivations, a sense of intellectual integrity to be true to the past, and state imposed limits on how the Cultural Revolution can be remembered.\n\nLauri Paltemaa\n\nNow You See It, Now You Don’t – An Analysis of Image Censorship in Chinese Internet\n\nThis paper argues that Chinese internet censorship practices can be divided into meta-level, index- level and editorial-level activities, which all aim at the prevention and manipulation of information flows. While the index-level and editorial-level practices have already been studied to some extent, the meta-level practice, which tries to hide information from audiences who are unaware of its existence, is largely uncharted in research. By comparing sets of images retrieved by using sensitive keywords in Chinese and Western search engines Baidu and Google, this paper suggest a method on how to analyze meta-level censorship and offers some tentative results about its content.\n\nLetizia Fusini\n\nRethinking Gao Xingjian’s post-exile dramaturgy in light of tragic theory: an independent perspective on a methodological problem.\n\nDespite featuring a “modern tragedy” (Escape, 1990) in his vast repertoire of plays, Gao Xingjian’s engagement with concepts and dramaturgies of the tragic has hitherto gone unnoticed in scholarly research. From The Other Shore (1986) to The Death Collector (2002), Gao has variously explored the multiple facets of what he calls “the predicament of modern man” (2007, p.90), namely the battle of the individual against the Other-within-the-Self, a sort of Trojan-horse-like force that inhabits the psyche, crushing it softly from within, and which proves even more portentous than external powers of the like of political oppression, social homogenization and consumerism. Furthermore, Gao has identified in the problem of the Self the transhistorical source of all tragedies from the Greeks to the present day, thereby establishing a strong link between the focus of most of his post-exile dramaturgical experimentations and the theory and practice of tragedy as a both a form of drama and a Weltanschauung.\n\nHowever, once the legitimacy of rethinking Gao Xingjian’s post-exile dramaturgy within a tragic perspective has been validated, what methodologies can be implemented to reframe and, possibly, reach a new understanding of key tropes of his post-exile theatre aesthetics? In exploring Gao’s personal contribution to world tragedy, this paper will evaluate the pros and cons of the comparative method and will ultimately argue in favour of an independent perspective, not based on “an ancillary name-tag” (Riley and Gissenwehrer 2001, p. 112) of this or that Western playwright or model work but on various transhistorical reconceptualizations of tragedy as an overarching dramatic “mode” or “mechanism”, “something that does something, that has an effect opera operato.” (Cowan 2003, p. 3).\n\nLiisa Kauppila & Sanna Kopra\n\nChina and the Construction of Risks and Responsibilities in the Arctic\n\nChina’s growing interest in the Arctic regional affairs has once again spurred China threat theories and speculations what kind of a great power China is rising to be. In particular, China’s environmental record, lack of transparency in Arctic policy-making and vocal protection of the rights of the non-Arctic countries have been perceived as sources of unease among the eight Arctic states, who have historically defined the norms and values of the region. Exploring China’s Arctic engagement represents a fruitful case to analyse and assess the variety of perceived risks that rising China’s economic, political and environmental modus operandi may possibly pose to the workings of the international society. In this paper, we argue that without understanding the way China defines and acts out its domestic and international responsibilities it is impossible to assess whether China’s entrance in the Arctic affairs poses real risks to the stability of the region.\n\nBy utilising Chinese language primary sources as part of the dataset, we demonstrate that China’s Arctic engagement is shaped and conducted by a variety of multi-level actors with different agendas. We apply the concept of responsible citizenship and study domestic interests and international duties that motivate and constrain China’s activities in the Arctic. Since states’ responsibilities are first and foremost guided by their domestic agendas, we begin by exploring the social construction of China’s national interests related to the Arctic and discuss how China’s participation (or non-participation) in the Arctic affairs may risk the state from realizing its goals and thus shouldering domestic responsibilities to its population as well as the ruling party. Second, we also analyse the way the Chinese government interprets and demonstrates its international responsibility to prevent harms and risks beyond its national borders. Finally, we explore perceived risks of China’s Arctic engagement and Chinese efforts to mitigate these risks.\n\nLily Mitchell\n\nBreaths and Whispers: Curating Chinese Contemporary Art through Cultural Encounters with the United Kingdom\n\nWithin the past twenty years a number of thematic trends can be interpreted in past exhibitions of Chinese contemporary art within the UK. The first being the expansion of art practice towards works, site specific installations, film works, and performances that have been created in response to the site, the host city, or to the UK. Another is the discursive criticism of ‘authenticity’, often playfully questioning previous attempts to encapsulate or translate the scope of Chinese contemporary art and instead demonstrating a more personal or pluralistic vision. Ultimately the hinted crisis of identity within many of the works captures a surprising snapshot of a state of flux in which Chinese contemporary art currently inhabits, filled with nomadic art practices, and changing social landscapes. Through a case study of the Centre for Chinse Contemporary Art (CFCCA) in Manchester this paper will analyse these methods of cultural encounter through curation and art practice by examining selected exhibitions and artist residencies produced by the Centre. I will also explore the methods of translation and transformation within these UK exhibitions.\n\nLinda Tsung\n\nEmerging trends and issues in teaching Chinese in the digital world\n\nThe past decade has seen rapid expansion in the teaching of Chinese. The growth in China’s economy and use of the internet have led to the expansion of Chinese programs in schools and universities internationally. Chinese is the main language, after English, used on the Internet. From developments on the internet there has arisen a transnational global Chinese language and culture. There has been dramatic growth in online Chinese language social media, newspapers, magazines and Chinese language bulletin boards. Against this background the teaching/ learning of Chinese in a global context has been influenced by developments in technology. This paper will focus on how the Chinese teaching curriculum and pedagogy have been affected by internet technology and identify issues which are emerging particularly in literacy.\n\nLisa Lindkvist Zhang, Prem Poddar,\n\nEncountering Spies in the Indian Hills: the Covert Politics of a Chinese Cultural Institution\n\nThis paper examines the cultural politics, mostly covert, of the Kalimpong Chung Hwa School 噶伦堡中华学校 (1941-1961). Perched at the junction between China, Bhutan and Nepal, and the former Himalayan kingdoms of Tibet and Sikkim, the hill station of Kalimpong functioned from the early 20th century not only as a trade outpost but also as an information hub. The Chung Hwa School in Kalimpong, set up as an educational enterprise for overseas Chinese children, officially served as a cultural institution with the purpose of promoting and transmitting Chinese values, customs, and language. More tenebrously, the Indian Intelligence Bureau suspected it to be a front for collecting intelligence: headmasters and teachers were arrested on many occasions and charged as secret agents.\n\nIn the critical time between the end of the 1940s to the beginning of the 1960s,when the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Republic of India (ROI) were fledgling states with messy borders, towns such as Kalimpong became barometrical indicators for the nervous nations and anxious states. For PRC, Kalimpong emerged as a border post harbouring dissenting Kashag defectors as well as imperial conspirators whereas for India it signified a borderland town which needed protection from Chinese infiltration and aggression. Reading intelligence files, Indian and Chinese government reports as well as newspaper sources, we argue that the history of the Kalimpong Chung Hwa School provides insights into the formatting of PRC-ROI relations; the unfolding encounters between the two ‘rising giants’ in our own time necessarily owe much to this pivotal period.\n\nMai Corlin\n\nTrojan Horses in the Chinese Countryside – The Bishan Commune and the Practice of Socially Engaged art in Rural China\n\nConcerned with socially engaged art practices in the Chinese countryside, the vantage point of this paper is the Bishan Commune; a socially engaged long-term utopian art project initiated under the rural reconstruction umbrella in the Chinese countryside. In 2010 the Chinese artist, editor, and curator Ou Ning drafted a notebook entitled How to Start Your Own Utopia. The notebook presents research into micro-nations across the world as well as drafts and ideas for an alternative community in rural China; a utopian ideal of another way of life based on the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin’s idea of mutual aid. In 2011 the commune was established in Bishan Village in rural Anhui Province. This paper examines how artists and intellectuals alike bring utopian imaginaries of the future to a countryside perceived to be in crisis. What are the imaginaries that they carry with them to the rural areas and what happens to these art projects as they venture into the fabric of rural society and leave the confined space of the urban? I explore the Bishan Project as a Trojan Horse – in the sense feminist art critic Lucy Lippard evoked, when she called the Trojan Horse the first activist artwork. I draw attention to Lippard because the dual connotations of the understanding of the Trojan Horse create a platform from which to understand the Bishan Project as a subversive power, that functions dialectically in the tension between gesture and aggression, the imaginary and the actual conversations taking place in the village. The arrival of urban artists is often followed by negotiations, clashes of imaginaries and conflicting visions of the future and of how the Chinese society is best organized for all parties involved. I thus also explore the Bishan Commune as a practical example of what happens when urban artists practice in the face of power and people in rural China.\n\nMarina Svensson (Keynote)\n\nThe Chinese heritage: Authorized heritage discourse, new voices, and local engagements\n\nChina is today undergoing a veritable heritage boom with huge investments in museums and heritage sites. Heritage is as much about the present and the future as about the past, and it thus inevitably serves contemporary goals and needs, including CCP’s legitimacy and economic development goals. The new vocabulary and way to conceptualise the past in terms of cultural heritage (wenhua yichan) has changed how historical sites and cultural traditions are imagined, valued, interpreted, mediated and used. China’s signing of the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Convention and adoption of the concept of intangible heritage (fei wuzhi wenhua yichan) unleashed a stronger interest in traditions and cultural practices. The intangible heritage includes a wide range of traditions and handicraft, ranging from traditional opera, to acrobatics, to papermaking and different ritual and religious festivals. Cultural practices, including religious rituals, which in the past were seen as ‘superstitious’ practices, are today instead celebrated as heritage. Although the heritagization process in China is very top-down in character there are also bottom-up developments and a strong interest in local history and celebration of place-based identities among Chinese citizens. My talk will address both the official discourse and policy and how local communities are negotiating with and trying to make use of the heritage discourse when protecting traditions and sites. It pays particular attention to how the heritage is mediated and visualized and how digital technologies, including in particular social media, offer new possibilities to share and engage with memories, identities, local culture, and heritage. The connective and affective affordances of social media strengthens the performative dimension of heritage experiences as well as give rise to a ‘co-present visuality’. The talk will provide examples from my own fieldwork among different local communities.\n\nMette Thunø\n\nChina’s new emigration museum in Beijing: Employing the Chinese diaspora to define the Chinese nation\n\nSince 2009 when China’s State Council upgraded culture to a strategic industry intended to contribute to China’s GDP and enhancing China’s soft power, museums have been multiplying rapidly. In this paper, I will explore how the newly established Overseas Chinese History Museum of China (中国 史博物 ) in Beijing is serving the official goals of culture as the “spirit and soul of the nation” when engaging with national subjects having left China to live beyond the boundaries of the nation-state. In particular, I intend to explore to what degree the Chinese diaspora is included in the construction of a collective narrative of the Chinese nation and how such a message is communicated in the exhibits. Usually museums display of artifacts confirms national belonging in opposition to other nations and people as well as products, but the display of ‘exotic’ artifacts also demonstrate a national ability to collect and control beyond the border. This project will investigate whether the displays of Chinese emigration serve similar purposes of reflecting international control and cosmopolitanism.\n\nMy study is based on detailed analysis of the exhibits since the opening in 2014, webpages and architecture of the Overseas Chinese History Museum of China under All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese as well as interviews with the museum director and curators. It is my intention to integrate museum studies of representation with Chinese diaspora studies to explore how the museum produces cultural and political boundaries embodied in the display of the emigration act. The overall aim is to highlight how a post-modern state as China shapes its relations to its diaspora through official museum narratives and how the display of global emigration reflects back on the national narrative.\n\nNathalie Mingboupha\n\nHyphenated-Chinese in China: ethnic “return” migrants’ intercultural encounters in the ancestral homeland\n\nWhile most Western economies were declining, China emerged as a nation with flourishing opportunities, consolidating its position in the global competition to attract the talented. To appeal to the highly-skilled, China implemented soft power strategies directed to its foreign coethnics, resulting in an increasing flow of migrants looking for fresher opportunities, including Western-born second generation overseas Chinese who “return” migrate to their parental homeland, though not only for economic reasons, but also to reconnect with their heritage.\n\nInscribed within the larger social processes and dynamics of Chinese contemporary society, my research thus explores Chinese ethnic “return” migration to China by uncovering this group’s multifaceted identities through their migration stories. With the purpose of understanding how their “homecoming” experiences and success or failure to integrate into the parental homeland’ society leads to the re- evaluation of their identity(ies), this groups of highly-skilled migrant group’s definitions of self and home evolve along with their transition from being a racial minority in their birth country to a cultural minority in their ethnic homeland.\n\nShedding light on the role of ethnicity in channelling migration and in restructuring the remigrants’ identities within their ancestral countries, my research uses a qualitatively-driven multimethod design to better understand migrants’ multi-layered socio-cultural integration experiences. Data collection thus primarily consisted of semi-structured in-depth interviews with 58 ethnic remigrants in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as a variety of documents analyses. By exploring these migrants’ integration experiences and overall journey, I find that as they re-evaluate their own definitions of home, self and belonging, this migrant group experiences various forms of emotional in-betweenness and double disconnection challenging the boundaries of their identities.\n\nNicholas Loubere\n\nThere and Back Again: Disentangling the Chinese Gold Rush in Ghana\n\nIn mid-2013, the Ghanaian government initiated a crackdown on the estimated 50,000 irregular Chinese migrants engaging in small-scale gold mining in the country – most of whom had arrived after 2008. In both the media and popular discourse, the Chinese miners were depicted as feeding into corruption, destroying the environment and stealing resources from marginal sectors of Ghanaian society. However, we still do not know much about who these miners were, the factors that compelled them to travel to such a distant land in the hopes of ‘striking it rich’, or how the spoils of this gold rush were distributed. This paper revisits this brief but intense episode in order to explore the ways in which this particular cultural encounter has shaped relationships between people, places and the natural environment, and to examine the impact that it has had on the lives of those involved, both in Ghana and China.\n\nNis Høyrup Christensen\n\nShaping China’s Renewable Energy Market: The Emergence of Organizational Fields in Authoritarian Settings\n\nIn 2009 China emerged as the biggest investor in renewable energy in the world, ahead of both Germany and the US. This milestone was reached just three years after China issued its first law on renewable energy, which shaped the regulatory framework for subsidizing and investing in capacity built-up. Today we still see staggering growth rates within solar and wind energy capacity making the renewable energy sector one of the most vibrant business settings worldwide.\n\nThe ambition of this paper is to explain how renewable energy in China emerged as an organizational field with a particular constellation of agents and specific meaning systems arising from their patterns of interaction. Two processes will be scrutinized: The linkages of ideas at the discursive level and the subsequent institutionalisation of an emerging field of renewable energy. We will see how the Party-state in China combines and integrates a set of ideas, which establishes ‘sustainable development’ as a comprehensive platform for action, and how that enables the institutionalization of renewable energy as an organizational field. The particular authoritarian setting is here of major importance, because field emergence becomes a less open-ended and democratically governed process compared to what we find in liberal democracies. This paper will therefore present a case from well outside of the neoinstitutional literature’s normal comfort zone and be able to offer a new understanding of field emergence in authoritarian settings.\n\nPolina Komarovskaya\n\nCombination of Art Traditions in Chinese Peasant Painting\n\nCurrently the centenary process of combining Western and Chinese traditions in Chinese painting reached its peak. A lot of talented artists who create both classic and path-breaking works are represented on the Chinese art scene. A special place is occupied by a genre of an artisan peasant painting (nongminhua, 农民画), which nevertheless belongs to folk art, but was formed under the direct influence of processess, taking place in guohua painting. Nоngminhua is a young genre which first appeared during the Great Leap Forward, flourished at the time of Cultural Revolution and has received its present form in the period of Reform and Opening- Up. Currently in China there are several dozens of nonminghua production centers, located mainly in the central and southern parts of the country. Nongminhua accumulates art traditions of peoples of China, but in its form it is Western and it has a lot of crossings with Western art. Non-Chinese influences and motifs are often brought up unconsciously. Although in other countries there are genres which are similar to nongminhua, it is a unique phenomenon, the formation of which would have been impossible without the conditions dictated by socio-political situation in China.\n\nRémy Jarry\n\nDeath, Sacrifice and Monumentality: Study of the Cultural Materials in the Work of Chen Zhen, Gu Wenda and Huang Yong Ping\n\nFrom the very end of the 1970’s up to now, Chinese artists have explored new media, genres and creative processes. In parallel, they have revived their historical and cultural heritage, which had been disregarded during the Cultural Revolution. In the course of this historical shift, one particular trend developed towards the end of the 1980’s: the pervasive presence of the theme of death in the works of a young generation of artists.\n\nIn the post-Revolution works of the young artists, artistic references to Chinese funerary arts along with other death-related topics became increasingly conspicuous. This trend crystallised when several Chinese avant-garde artists – all born in the 1950s – started to explore in depth the concept of death. Three of them, Chen Zhen (1955-2000), Gu Wenda (1955-) and Huang Yong Ping (1954-), were key artists in the generation in question.\n\nThese three artists started to incorporate visual elements related to death and Chinese funerary arts in their works, such as installations in the shape of Chinese tombs or steles. In certain cases, their art was even seen to revive traditional Chinese sacrificial rites. This trend toward an increasing embrace of the theme of death was all the more interesting because it started at the time, when these three artists came directly into contact with the Western world and culture.\n\nRuvimbo Natalie Mavhiki\n\nChina’s Confucianism and the future of democracy in Zimbabwe\n\nAuthoritarian regimes thrive and remain guaranteed by a marginalised and disenfranchised local majority, mostly in rural areas where Confucian values are strongly upheld. Based on the above proposition, this paper investigates values of social hierarchy, that is, people as followers, ministers and advisors as loyal middle men and the executive as sovereign and supreme. Exploring similarities between China’s Confucius values and African values that prioritise social harmony more than individual rights, in this paper I argue that this has led to a slackening in democratisation efforts in Africa. The paper juxtaposes confucian characteristics (respectful, politeness, elders, order, hierarchy, loyalty, obedience) with democratic standards as traditionally practiced in mature democracies to advance an argument that cultural values can affect politics. Furthermore, I argue that Confucius values affect the ability of citizens to demand accountability or transparency from leaders and affects the objectivity of deliberative and aggregative democratic processes. This comparison of Zimbabwean and Chinese cases contributes to the gap in literature on the South- South dimension and the future of international politics. This is also an attempt to answer Fukuyama’s question on whether Confucianism is incompatible with Western democracy or how viable is the African-Asian cultural alternative to democracy.\n\nSnorri Karlsson\n\nPassing on the torch: discourse strategies in the inaugural speeches of Jiang, Hu and Xi\n\nFollowing the death of Mao Zedong the new Chinese leadership attempted to avoid some of the problems associated with the concentration of personal political power, and Deng Xiaoping, though still playing a paramount political role, sought to rule through a leadership collective. Starting with Jiang Zemin, it has become a new norm in Chinese politics that the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the CCP also serves as President of the PRC.\n\nThis reemergence of (official) leadership concentration around a single person leads to the question of how transitions of leadership are presented within Chinese politics, and to what extent they are indicative of new directions of policy and ideology. An inaugural speech is designed to set the tone for new beginnings when a new officeholder assumes responsibilities. This thesis uses inaugural speeches and speeches given in connection with inaugurations to the two offices mentioned above as research material to address this question. Drawing inspiration from a Master’s Thesis by Tawfic and Fattah (2015), perspectives from Critical Discourse Analysis are employed to examine the relationships between language, power and discourse in the speeches. Focus is placed on the use of four discourse strategies: positive self-representation and negative other-representation, establishing speaker-addressee relationship, temporal proximization and assignment of agency. This thesis assesses to what extent Jiang, Hu and Xi differ in their employment of these discourse strategies, and if differences or similarities can be explained by correlation with biographical data, changes in policy direction or the sociopolitical background of the speeches.\n\nSophie Hoffritz Krogh\n\nBig Trouble in little Hollywood – How China’s current foreign movie policy affects global cinema\n\nThis paper discusses China’s foreign movie policy in the 21st century and how it affects the global movie environment. It argues that the commercialization and marketization of the Chinese movie market has not been weakening the Chinese government’s control over film production and dissemination, but that the government has adopted new strategies to control the Western influence on the Chinese movie market. Through collaboration with Hollywood movie companies China Communist Party (CCP) hopes to learn how to create mainstream movies with the use of Western technology and storytelling, but with content that still legitimate the Chinese party-state. This paper presents some of the restrictions that the Chinese government utilise to control the dissemination of Hollywood movies, i.e. the 34 foreign movie import quota, distribution and marketing restrictions and censorship, and how these restrictions have led to a change in the way China is perceived in Hollywood productions. Hollywood movie companies conduct self-censorship, hire Chinese actors and convey a positive China image in big Hollywood blockbusters to gain access to China; the second biggest movie market in the world. This paper will give examples on the new perception of China in Hollywood movies through a case analysis of the movies Pixels (Columbus 2015) and The Martian (Scott 2015). They each represent two different aspects of the Chinese influence on the foreign movie market, i.e. self-censorship and Chineseness in foreign productions. The conclusion is that Hollywood has created a new perception of China as to accommodate the Chinese movie market and government.\n\nStig Thøgersen\n\nThe Tragedy of Progressive Education in China\n\nUp through the 1920s and 1930s, a progressive pedagogy in the tradition of Pestalozzi, Fröbel, and Dewey became an accepted part of the left-wing repertoire in China where educators and psychologists such as Tao Xingzhi and Chen Heqin argued for a child-centered approach to education and for seeing children as more than just incomplete adults. In the early 1950s, however, the CCP ran campaigns against Dewey and his Chinese followers and, with the assistance of Soviet education experts, the Stalinist conception of children as future socialist citizens gradually ousted the progressive views. During the Hundred Flowers Movement, educators from the progressive camp criticized the Soviet influence in the educational field, but they were immediately branded as rightists. This paper will focus on the destinies of Chen Heqin and Zhang Zonglin, two central figures on the progressive wing. Based on their writings and on the accusations against them I will argue that the CCP through this campaign cemented a fundamentally Stalinist position, which it would later find it hard to leave. Up to the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong expressed a consistent and deep-rooted uneasiness with the Soviet- inspired education system but as the progressive part of the left-wing educational tradition and its conception of childhood had been wiped out, he was unable to define a viable alternative.\n\nSunny Xin Liu\n\nLook Beyond and Beneath the Soft Power: An Alternative Analytical Framework for China’s Cultural Diplomacy\n\nThis paper contextualises China’s contemporary global cultural footprints by examining the recent development of its cultural diplomacy. The point of departure was to show the limitations of applying the mainstream narrative of soft power as the analytical tool. The new theoretical framework this research proposes is underpinned by Gramsci’s concept of cultural hegemony (1971), Said’s critique of Orientalism (1978), and Ozirimli’s argument of nationalism (2005), which are applied to conceptualise China’s cultural diplomacy against the historical, international and domestic backgrounds, and then to examine the interactions between China’s long held image by the West to be the ‘cultural other’ and the ‘ideological other’ and China’s own representations as ‘us’. This new framework revealed a three-dimensional picture of an uneven global cultural terrain, both in terms of unbalanced powers with hidden barriers for the counter-hegemonic side, and also hierarchical barriers influencing the interactions among various players in this terrain. The dynamics among all the forces at work are critically analysed to understand the unique challenges China faces and how this is etched into the complexity of its cultural diplomacy, which is more than just building soft power to match its economic rise.\n\nSince the Confucius Institute represents the most visible, and a highly controversial manifestation of China’s cultural diplomacy, a comparative case study of Confucius Institutes operating in different parts of the world was carried out to epitomize the distinctive features of China’s cultural diplomacy.\n\nThorsten Budde Haensel\n\nChinese language teaching in Denmark: Where are we heading?\n\nSince the early years for the 21st century, Chinese language teaching in Denmark has experienced a continuous and at times fast-paced growth. The university programs’ intake of students rose to new heights, and new programs where opened up at more universities. In 2005 a high school reform accepted Chinese into the official curricula. A few years later, primary schools and middle schools started experimenting with offering Chinese language courses, often supported by Confucius Institutes.\n\nLearning Chinese was “hot” and Danish company leaders spoke out in the media, crying out for staff with competencies in Chinese language skills. As a result, the student body’s motivation for studying Chinese changed along the way. Instead of mainly attracting students, whose initial motivation was a deep interest in Chinese culture, characters or politics, many students now where attracted by the promise of Chinese studies being the Promised Land of employability.\n\nHowever, in since 2014 the political climate in Denmark has changed. The education system is experiencing fiscal cutbacks, and foreign language programs and courses are particularly hard hit – and Chinese has not been exempt. University programs are being shut down or reduced in intake. Yet a new high school reform is threatening to wipe Chinese off the course list. And at lower levels the time for experiments seems to be over.\n\nHow has Chinese language teaching in Denmark gone from a booming teaching area to just the opposite within only three years’ time? Why do the ministries of foreign affairs and trade put an enormous effort in strengthening ties with China while the Ministry of Education is going the opposite way?\n\nThis presentation will try to find answers and more importantly try to find solutions and hope. Particularly how increased collaboration between institutions and teachers in the Nordic countries can be important.\n\nTunghing Sum\n\nUnderstanding Humanitarianism from the Perspective of Confucianism\n\nThe fundamental idea of humanitarianism is “helping people in an exceptional distress situation”. Although this idea is not uniquely western and can be found in many civilizations, modern-day humanitarianism is shaped by a set of western liberal values and, its discourse has been dominated by the western states and organizations. With the increasing political and economic power, China expands its involvement in the humanitarian sphere. However, there is widely held the view that China’s response to the complex emergences does not conform to the established norm of humanitarianism. China’s approaches to humanitarianism challenges the established international humanitarian order which raises a question of the order’s future. Many have studied China’s humanitarian policy like its response to humanitarianism, or its foreign aid pattern. However, not many literatures have addressed why China has taken a different path. This paper will draw on constructivist approach which focus on how the interaction between domestic and international social ideational factors shape state’s foreign policy to understand China’s humanitarian response. To understand the China’s humanitarian approaches, this paper is going to explore the China’s humanitarian identity, particularly on Confucian ethical system which is a core element of this identity. By engaging the established humanitarian norm and China’s interpretation of it, it not only helps us understand China’s “controversial response”, but also reveals how the future international humanitarian order could be like.\n\nUffe Bergeton\n\nTransformative Translation: Manufacturing Ancient Chinese “Culture”\n\nTransformative translation plays an important role in modern Western cultural encounters with China. In this paper I show how the striking increase in the use of the word culture to render the Chinese term wén 文 (‘pattern,’ ‘decoration’) in English translations of the Analects from the seventeenth century to today provides a window into how historical changes in word meanings and collective consciousness have influenced modern Western understanding of early Chinese concepts of ‘culture.’ Before the mid-nineteenth century wén was never translated as “culture.” From the 1860s to today the percentage of instances of wén in the Analects translated as “culture” has steadily increased, reaching 98% in one recent translation. The popularization of the term culture to mean ‘universal high culture’ in the nineteenth century led translators to “discover” that wén meant something similar. Semantic developments in the English word culture made translators believe that they were finding a modern Anglo-phone concept of “culture” in ancient Chinese text. Pre-1860s translations of wén, such as “regulation of men and manners” and “order of things,” were often just as philologically sound, if not sounder, than later translations of wén as “culture.” Nevertheless, the idea that Confucius’s use of the word wén meant “culture” was so appealing that it eventually became almost universally accepted. To this day, this factoid continues to mislead contemporary readers of early Chinese texts in translation and insidiously perpetuates problematic essentializing assumptions of the so-called “culturalist paradigm” in the field of Chinese studies.\n\nValentine Nebon-Carle\n\n‘Hot interpretation’ of Western-related heritage sites in China: relating the ‘Imperialists’ encounters in Chinese history.\n\nWithin the field of heritage management, interpretation of heritage is supposed to be unbiased and dispassionate. Indeed, the narratives constructed by heritage professionals and by local tourism agencies must remain objective. However, when these discourses become personal and subjective, we can talk about ‘hot Interpretation’, as David Uzzell explains in his article. Inside the former Russo-Japanese prison in Lushun, China, interpretive panels are in fact providing a ‘hot interpretation’ of the Russian and Japanese occupation of the city to visitors. This city was occupied by the Russians between 1898 and 1904 and was intended to be a military port for the Russian Empire. The Japanese invaded the Liaodong Peninsula after winning the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. Most recently, the Chinese municipality turned the former battlefields and the Russo-Japanese prison, into tourist sites. The way that these historic sites have been interpreted for tourists is not objective, thus, an ideo-political message appeared behind this commodification. Similarly, we find the same discourse in the Old Summer Palace in Beijing, which was burned out and destroyed by the French and English during the Opium Wars. Inside the site, many ruins have been left behind to symbolise the damage done by the Western soldiers. This paper aims to discuss the making of the ‘hot interpretation’ of the former prison, the battlefields and the former Summer Palace today. Moreover, through these case studies, I intend to talk about heritage interpretation in Western-related heritage sites in China today.\n\nVictoria Bogushevskaya\n\nFifty shades of Chinese GREY: “a wild card” colour category in diachrony\n\nGrey is not an easy matter. It is an achromatic colour and is therefore supposed to be related to brightness rather than to hue. It is also referred to as “a wild-card” term that may occur at various points in the Berlin-Kay (1991 [1969]) basic colour terms’ (BCT) evolutionary sequence at any point after Stage IV. Modern Standard Mandarin (MSM) was treated as a problematical language with no basic colour term for grey.\n\nI will prove this statement wrong. Not only there is a psychologically salient basic colour term for this category in MSM, 灰 huī(OC *mʕə), but the grey shades were expressed in the language via the lexeme hēi 黑 “black” and via the polysemous “grue”, qīng 青 and cāng 蒼. 灰 huī is used in the meaning “ashes” in the Warring States-Hàn texts, as in the Lǐjì 禮 記 and the Lùnhéng 論衡, but also denotes “dirt” and “charcoal”. Its Tibeto-Burman cognate also means “ashes, dust” in some languages (Schuessler 2007).\n\nFrom the 4th century CE, huī is often applied to stone (shíhuī 石灰, lit. “stone huī”), denoting limestone. Limestone contains calcium carbonate and is the source of the white pigment used as early as in the beginning of Western Zhōu 周 era. The Kāngxī Dictionary, despite applying this lexeme for description of colour of birds’ plumage and fishes’ scales, does not gloss it as colour term. This does not mean that there were no lexical means for expressing grey colour.\n\nWang Jingjing\n\nOn Hu Shih’s Re-evaluation and Re-interpretation of Chinese Cultural Tradition\n\nHu Shih is one of the most important personage in the history of Chinese modern thought. On the one hand, he is “the father of Chinese Renaissance”; he insisted on Chinese modernization and the value of Democracy. On the other he also practiced Confucianism in all his life. It is generally accepted that Hu Shih is a radical reformer in May Fourth New-Culture Movement. He advocatd the abolish of “literary language”. He and his colleagues were against traditional moral concept and customs. However, in post-May Fourth time, Hu Shih almostly spent his rest of life restoring and re-interpreting the Chinese tradition. In this paper, I will study that how Hu Shih re-evaluate and re-interpretate Chinese Cultural tradition by the influence of John Dewey’s Experimentalism and other western ideas.\n\nXiao (Alvin) Yang\n\nEncountering Different Perceptions of the Rise of China: Contested International Relation Theories and One Belt One Road Initiative\n\nHow is the rise of China perceived by different international relations (IR) theories? This paper identifies, describes and critically examines the tensions among different perceptions of the rise of China from competing IR theories. For instance, neo-realist theory (Waltz 1979, Mearsheinmer 2001) may interpret the rise of China as a challenge to the US’ hegemony. In contrast, neo-liberal theory may perceive China as integrating into the “open, integrated, and rule-based” liberal world order in which the interdependence created by interaction and cooperation will make China peaceful and responsible (Ikenberry 2008). Moreover, there are more radical theories, such as Chang (2012, 2001) predicts that the modern Chinese state will collapse soon whereas Jacque (2012) predicts that China will “rule the world” and the spread of Chinese cultures and political ideas will fundamentally change the world order. However, from Chinese perspectives, the rise of China may be seen as catching up with the West and/or as China is going back to its “rightful” historical position and national rejuvenation (Heilmann and Schmidt 2014; Yan 2001). Furthermore, Zhang (2012) posits that China will rise peacefully because of its cultural traditions. I argue that none of these theories can fully capture all dimensions and dynamics of the rise of China. Rather, China is constantly changing, evolving, and re-inventing itself. As many countries are becoming inward looking, the Belt and Road Initiative may create new impetus and lead a new wave of global and regional integration, which may subsequently create a new model that is different from the American-led or European-led model.\n\nZhang Chun\n\nRoundtable: Chinese Language Education Across Nordic Universities: Towards Establishing the Nordic Association of Chinese Teaching (NACT): Concerns and Prospects\n\nWith the increasing maturity of Chinese teaching, a number of associations and teacher organizations have been established all over the world. Chinese language teachers support each other through membership of and participation in teacher associations. These range from international organization such as 世界汉语协会sponsored by Hanban; to teacher associations operating in a country, for example, British Association of Chinese Teaching, American association of Chinese Teaching; or in a region with common languages, for example, Association of German-speaking. In 2015, the European Association of Chinese Teaching was established. The establishment of EACT signals a landmark in the history of Chinese teaching in Europe. It is not only a platform for teacher educators, department leaders, policy makers, but also serves as a forum for Chinese language teachers, where CLTs exchange teaching experiences and gain mutual support. Although there is an increase in the number of Chinese language teachers (CLTs) teaching Chinese to college students across Nordic universities, the overall teachers’ numbers are small, and likely to remain so. Most university CLTs rarely belong to a teacher association. In 2016, teachers from Stockholm University, Oslo University and Aarhus University launched a common project called “NordNet_TCFL”. It is generously funded by Nordplus Higher Education. We started the project in October 2016. Teachers from three universities visited each other, observed each other’s class and shared teaching materials. The project will terminate in September 2017.\n\nThis Round Table aims to provide a forum to discuss and debate on (un)necessity of establishing a permanent and sustainable CLTs’ network across Nordic universities. The questions to be explored are:\n\nWhat are the drives for establishing a common association for Chinese teaching across Nordic countries?\n\nCan Nordic universities possibly move towards a Nordic Association of Chinese Teaching (NACT)? What would be the consequences of establishing it?\n\nWhat are the steps needed to take to engage with CLTs across Nordic universities? Is the NACT the best approach to do it? If so, how may this be leading to a sustainable network for CLTs?\n\nCould be argued that the support from Confucius Institutes (CIs) boost the collaboration and coordination between Chinese language teachers (CLTs) both in a country and across Nordic countries?\n\nZhang Xinsheng\n\nChinese Language Teaching in need of More Collaboration in Nordic Countries and in Europe\n\nIn the last ten years or so, there has been a noticeable rapid growth in the number of people in learning Chinese in most European countries, and Chinese teaching has also integrated into the national education system of several countries as a modern foreign language. This development has created the need for a European Chinese language competence framework in line with the CEFR; experienced and qualified teachers of Chinese who not only understand the difficulties of their students but also know how to help them; suitable teaching materials that their learners can use inside and outside classroom. All this calls for more collaboration and coordination between the teaching professionals of Chinese language both in a country and between the countries across Europe. The European Association of Chinese Teaching (EACT/AEEC) was specifically created for this very purpose in 2015. The talk will give a brief overall picture of CLT in Europe and what the EACT/AEEC has been doing since its inception. As there is already collaboration between universities in the teaching of Chinese in Nordic universities, the talk will then suggest that a more widely inclusive professional body of teachers of Chinese in Nordic countries is both feasible and highly necessary to further improve and promote CLT in these countries. Moreover, the EACT/AEEC will be very pleased to work closely with such Nordic organisation as it is now already working with a number of national associations across the whole Europe.\n\nZhu Hua (Keynote)\n\nWhere are you really from?: Nationality and Ethnicity Talk (NET) in everyday interactions\n\nThis talk examines the significance of questions such as “where are you really from?” in everyday conversational interactions. Defining this kind of talk as nationality and ethnicity talk (NET), i.e. discourse that either explicitly or inexplicitly evokes one’s nationality or ethnicity in everyday conversation, I discuss what constitutes NET, how it works through symbolic and indexical cues and strategic emphasis, and why it matters in the wider context of identity, race, intercultural contact and power relations. The discussion draws on social media data including videos, blogs, on-line comments and the authors’ observations, and focuses on NET around Asian people living outside Asia. It argues that the question “where are you really from” itself does not per se contest immigrants’ entitlement. However, what makes a difference to the perception of whether one is an “interloper” – someone who is not wanted – is the “tangled” history, memory and expectation imbued and fuelled by power inequality. ."
