        "text": "Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU) recently held the closing ceremony for the 2024 University Alliance of the Silk Road (UASR) \"Global Youth Leadership\" Summer Camp, marking the end of the seven-day series of activities.\n\nProf. Tian Mei, vice dean of School of International Education at XJTU, attended the ceremony and delivered a speech. She commended the positive learning attitudes and cooperative spirit demonstrated by the campers, encouraging them to maintain this enthusiasm in future studies. Tian expressed her hope that the summer camp would leave participants with unforgettable memories of XJTU and that each student would become an ambassador of friendship, sharing their experiences in China with family and friends to foster a better understanding of the country.\n\nLin Xiaolong, an instructor representative, reflected on the wonderful moments of the summer camp, expressing his hope that the knowledge and friendship gained during the camp would have a lasting impact.\n\nThe closing ceremony featured a touching performance by students from Chung Hwa Middle School, Brunei, who sang \"Tanah Airku\" in traditional costumes, earning warm applause from the audience. Meanwhile, Malaysian student Xu Huijia and Thai student Chen Feili, both XJTU volunteer representatives, spoke at the ceremony. Xu, who served as a teaching assistant in a calligraphy class, shared her experience of witnessing the cultural exchanges between the campers. Chen expressed her happiness in forming new friendships and her belief that the camp would leave a lasting impression on all participants.\n\nTeachers and students from countries including Brunei, Uzbekistan, Russia, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Indonesia shared their experiences and the insights gained from the camp.\n\nStudents have praised the university's learning environment and support from staff, expressing their gratitude for the opportunity to participate in the summer camp and their desire to continue their studies in China.\n\nSince 2017, Xi'an Jiaotong University has hosted the UASR Summer Camp for eight consecutive years. This year, the camp welcomed nearly 170 international teachers and students from 12 countries, including Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Vietnam, Mongolia, Brunei, New Zealand, and Azerbaijan. Through activities such as visiting the State Key Laboratories, learning the Chinese language and traditional Chinese calligraphy, and touring the Museum of Terracotta Warriors and Horses, participants gained a deeper appreciation of Chinese culture. The camp also provided rich opportunities for exchanges and interactions between Chinese and foreign students."
