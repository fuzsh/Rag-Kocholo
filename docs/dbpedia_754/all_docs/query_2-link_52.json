        "text": "For secondary schools in Malaysia, individuals enter secondary school at age 13. Secondary school education is compulsory for all Malaysian children. Generally, secondary school education lasts for five years. The two levels of secondary education are Lower Secondary (Form 1 to 3) and Upper Secondary (Form 4 to 5). On the other hand, the beginning of secondary education at international schools depends on the curriculum offered by the respective schools. Schools that follow the British Curriculum Secondary levels consist of KS3 (Ages 11 to 14) and KS4 (Ages 14 to 16). Students will typically sit for the (I)GCSE examinations at the end of KS4 at age 16."
