        "text": "Dear Mr Walter Woon,\n\nYes, I will not and shall not call you with the title ‘Baba’ Walter Woon, because the arrogance and disrespect you show towards the people who inherit Straits Chinese culture, be they indigenous, local, peranakan or sin khek/totok, does not reflect the progressive society that we envision.\n\nJust to give everyone else a little bit of context. Our friend here posted an article about how ‘Baba-Nonya community is a distinctively Singaporean one’.\n\nOkay . . .\n\nSure! If it refers to that community. Yeah, those people who take so much pride in fumbling less than a handful of melayu baba phrases here and there. The ones who get together wearing tacky kebaya-s in the most outrageously garish colours, singing malay children song and ma-masak (children’s pretend cooking).. Imagine preschool for old-people… that is what it looks like to people like us, who grew up in this creolised culture; a culture that is so rich, wide and diverse, which does not belong to anyone but yet belongs to everyone.\n\nTherefore, let’s listen to this ‘Walter Woon’ and analyse if his claims carry weight:\n\n‘My family has been part of the Baba/Nonya community for seven generations and our experience suggests that many young Singaporeans are only vaguely aware of this community.’\n\nIf you mean peranakan culture, yes most Singaporeans are aware of it, but as you mentioned afterwards, your Baba-Nonya culture is different. It is a subculture of peranakans, consisting of wealthy highly privileged elites who created a social wall that separated them from common folks. Why are we not aware, you say? Because the like of yours would rarely rub shoulders with every other kopitiam newspaper-reading ah-pek-s. Once when I was young and ignorant, I asked my uncle, “Why do we not know of any Babah Nyonya in Medan?”. My uncle replied, “Of course not. Ours is a Totok (sin-khek) families of no status”.\n\nTotok is a term used to call us by fully assimilated Indonesian Chinese. Long story, but today it has the connotation of: too Chinese to be Indonesian. Singsong tongue-tied accent. They don’t care about how creolised our culture is. We are not the model minority. We do not assimilate fully like them. Oh, by the way my nephews and nieces are 6th generation Totok Chinese in Sumatra.\n\n‘It is found nowhere else in the world, save in the former Straits Settlements of Malacca and Penang — even then, they have grown apart after more than 75 years of separate development.’\n\nIn a way it is a correct observation. Singapore has grown into a very different society than Malaya and Nusantara. Ruling class of Singapore are of Chinese descent. Although Indonesia and Malaysia have its own handful of ridiculously rich Chinese capitalists, Singaporean Chinese do not have the social stigma of being ‘a guest’. Singaporeans do not know what it means to be a minority, and do not know how it feels to practice their cultures as minority. Born in British Malaya, elite Baba-Nyonya were given the level of access to education and landownership not given to Sin-khek and their descendants. The use of English language as the default in Singaporean political arena, Baba-Nyonya elites survived through the test of time, thrived and retained their status of being the upper echelon of society in Modern Singapore. In a way, Singapore is a nation that is very detached from its neighbours.\n\nThe liberation of British Malay and Dutch East Indies meant that Chinese and Peranakans are both categorised as non bumiputra/pribumi. Non-peranakan Chinese in this case, have gained access to own land outside designated settlements and trade freely to various regions. Peranakan elites of Malaya and East Indies eventually lost their upper hands from their traditional trade monopolies. Their proficiency in English/Dutch language worth nothing in Malaysian or Indonesian politics and bureaucracies, while melayu baba is an informal patois, equal to Melayu Pasar, looked down in literature and journalism.\n\nI suppose, due to those factors, Singaporean Baba-Nyonya still holds the elitism and power, even if many have lost or squandered the wealth of their predecessors. Privilege, is what separates Singaporean Baba-Nyonya from their neighbouring kins.\n\n‘If we are looking for a candidate for inclusion in the Unesco Cultural Heritage list, Singaporean Baba/Nonya culture would be a natural choice.‘\n\nBaba Nyonya culture of Singapore is not old enough to even be categorised as an ‘ethnic group’ of its own. The lavishness and elitism celebrated by Singaporean baba-nyonya culture is just a reflection of a glimpse of a small golden age era that did not span over one or two centuries the most. Many Peranakans claimed older heritage than that, but almost all failed to provide convincing evidence to their claims. Recent Peranakan genome project in Singapore also confirmed that Singaporean Peranakans should not be boasting a heritage they do not own. We understand that Peranakans and Baba-Nyonya have different culture than Singaporean Sin-kheks, but a lot of the culture they claim to be nyonya-this and nyonya-that are not really exclusively baba-nyonya. No one can prove it. Much of the attributes of the culture was born out of nostalgia rather than something that is living and breathing, while ignoring the culture that instead passed down to other communities who preserved them better. Don’t forget that Singapore’s ‘Bengawan Solo’, and institution known for its Peranakan fares, was not even founded by a Nyonya, let alone native Singaporean.\n\nFor example, Cheang Hong Lim (my grandmother’s grandfather after whom Hong Lim Green is named) was born in Singapore in the first half of the 19th century.\n\nPicture below is coolies in Deli in 1870, only one generation off from your ancestor. Do they not deserve UNESCO cultural heritage listing as well? How about the orang asli and Malays before them?\n\n‘Many old Baba families trace their lineage even further back, as there were Chinese communities in Penang and Malacca — and even Singapore, since a significant port existed here before the advent of Raffles in 1819, despite common misconceptions and British propaganda.’\n\nDid you participate in the recent Singapore Peranakan Genome Project? Where are those many old Baba families you talked about? I suppose they are not reflected and represented in the published paper? And you should know better about figuring out what is propaganda and what is not. Singapore media and entertainment is full of it. Having few Chinese people in a pre-Raffles Tumasik Kampong does not mean that Baba-Nyonya were already there, with their smallwares, kamchengs and kasot manek, locked in the kitchen of a Baba mansion.\n\n‘Historically, a Mongol-led Chinese army invaded Java in the 13th century. They failed in this military endeavour and it is likely that many of the survivors would have remained in the region rather than return to distant China.‘\n\nThat is a historical heritage of all Chinese diaspora and all Chinese people. It is beyond any form of reasoning that one would try to link genealogy from 13th century Chinese (whatever ethnic group they were) to your 19th century ancestors. It took 3-6 centuries for indigenous Minnan to fully assimilate to a sinitic culture. By 19th century, you would not be able to tell the difference between those Chinese and locals, let alone keep a genealogy or pass down a ‘peranakan culture’. To claim that Chinese has been here since this time and that time, is a baseless, uneducated and assumptive statement that is not exclusively Peranakan or Baba-Nyonya.\n\n‘There are Indonesian genes among the old Baba families. This should not be surprising, as the original Babas inter-married with women from what is now Indonesia. This also would explain why Bahasa Baba is closer to Bahasa Indonesia than to Bahasa Melayu. The Nonyas in particular dressed in the Indonesian style, with the baju panjang and later the kebaya.’\n\nI love how Baba-Nyonya communities conveniently used the term ‘inter-married’, as if it was a mutual or consented agreement. Most of these women were bought slaves, and most of those who were not bought slaves were daughters of bought slaves. ‘Bahasa Indonesia’ did not exist until 1900s. It was known as Bahasa Melayu. Batavia’s bahasa Melayu was probably brought down from Melaka, which came from Sumatra. Many of the said enslaved women were not mother tongue Malay speakers. They would probably be learning malay on the go as it became the common language between her and her master-husband.\n\nBaju panjang/Kebaya panjang was the standard since 19th century, and yet almost no one today wears traditional kebaya panjang? What happened to that intangible heritage thing? And what is with the baju batik? There is nothing traditional about baju batik. People of that era probably would be shocked to see how sarong that was meant to cover legs are today made into shirt to cover chest.\n\n‘The Babas of the Straits Settlements (Singapore, Malacca and Penang) clearly were British subjects and generally proud of their status, as contrasted to the Chinese who owed their allegiance and kept their cultural links to China. The majority of the Chinese also didn’t consider Singapore their home. When the victory parade marking the Japanese surrender in Singapore was held in September 1945 the Chinese waved the flags of Nationalist China.’\n\nDo you not know that most of Chung Hwa schools in Indonesia and Malaya were founded and established by Peranakans/Baba-Nyonya? Many were not happy with traditional education at the temples and established confucian school teaching Sin-Khek-s mandarin language and unitarian movement through chung hwa/tionghoa identity. Most Peranakans or Baba-Nyonya have stronger identity of being a local, but through dual-citizenship mentality. The concept of nationality were not set in stone during that time. Most sinkheks would have never met anyone outside their clans and language community until they travelled to ‘nan yang/lam-io’.\n\n‘However, it should be noted that there were Chinese people born in the Straits Settlements who were not part of the Baba/Nonya community, especially after the Qing Dynasty was overthrown. The locally-born children of more-recent Chinese immigrants did not assimilate into the old-established Baba/Nonya community.’ This is why the label “Peranakan” is a misnomer when used as a synonym for “Baba” or “Nonya”. Being Baba or Nonya is a matter of cultural identification, not race.\n\nYes and no. The Post 1900s migrants adopt much less of Peranakan traits, especially in regions where their numbers are sizable enough to become a majority force, such as Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Throughout time they adopt nationalistic identity rather a historical cultural identity. In that sense, YES.\n\nBut NO, Baba Nyonya is not just cultural identification. As you said Baba-Nyonya culture is strongly connected to Nusantara. In my hometown, Baba and Nonya is still used, but they evolved into Bapak and Nyonya. It was used to be attributed to Chinese, but exclusively Chinese who are of higher caste (derajat yang lebih tinggi). Nowadays, in Medan, and probably around Nusantara, Nyonya and Bapak is used to refer to people of all races and of various cultural background. However, it is term strictly used to show formality and respect. Bapak, in Indonesia is used to replace ‘Tuan’, commonly used. Nyonya however, is used much less, and usually to show outmost respect. My Totok parents are called Bapak and Nyonya by their workers all the time. However no one in Indonesia would call themselves ‘Saya Bapak (name)’ or ‘Saya Nyonya (name)’. Giving oneself such title is seen as arrogant, crude and uncultivated. It is a title given to you, not one you give yourself.\n\nBahasa Baba is a creole of Hokkien and Indonesian. It is closer to Bahasa Indonesia than to Bahasa Melayu. Listen to the way Babas speak — the pronunciation is Indonesian.\n\nAgain, Bahasa Indonesia did not exist prior 1900s. It was bahasa Melayu Sumatera.\n\nSingaporeans are generally unaware of all this, except superficially through the cuisine. It would be good if schools could educate the young about this distinctively Singaporean culture.\n\nIt would also be good if Baba-Nyonya community stop claiming nyonya-this and nyonya-that. A lot of traditional food that you call ‘nyonya’ are not called nyonya in my hometown. We speak a language similar to Penang Babah Hokkien; one that is even more creolised. My grandaunts and granduncles wore sarong at home, batik for women madras for men. We eat lontong sayur during the first day of Chinese New Year. I grew up with all kinds of kueh, most you call nyonya kueh, but we call everything kueh, and it is our culture. I will not call myself peranakan, because I am proud of my Totok history. I am proud to be totok.\n\nMost of these cultural heritage are probably passed down not by the elite baba-nyonyas, but by the pua-tang (half-caste) people whose women became nyonya bride for rich chinese men, and whose men will probably stuck in lower middle class, taking local wife and creating new vocabularies everyday and conjuring up new flavours every other day. Or probably it is that sin-khek who could not find the right ingredient but ended up with something amazing. Or that uncle who wanted to open up his business for a wider customers with various dietary needs and palate.\n\nBut do you know, much of multiculturalism is born from love for one another. Medan Chinese New Year’s lontong sayur, for instance, is born from the desire for Chinese families to open their house for all people to visit, including their muslim neighbours.\n\nTherefore uncle Walter. I hope you have big enough heart to apologise to those people who you have offended. For the sake of your cultural heritage and your ancestors’ dignity.\n\nFrom a nobody."
