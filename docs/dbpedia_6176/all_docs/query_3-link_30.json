        "text": "A CYNOPSIS MESSAGE FROM NBC SPORTS GROUP\n\nWin a trip to the NASCAR Ford EcoBoost 400 in Miami\n\nfrom NBC SPORTS GROUP Launching Today\n\nEnter our exclusive sweepstakes and play for the chance to win\n\nother prizes including trips to a 2015 Sunday Night Football game or\n\nthe 2016 NHL All-Star Game in Nashville and exciting daily prizes.\n\nNBCSportsSweeps.com\n\nNBCUniversal – ALL TOGETHER. DIFFERENT.\n\nCYNOPSISSPORTS\n\n07.20.15\n\nGood morning. It’s Monday July 20, 2015, and this is your first early morning Sports briefing.\n\nThe emergence of Rentrak Sports, which launched officially last week, will look to create a new player in the industry, leveraging the company’s array of TV measurement data, consumer data, and branded entertainment metrics to serve rising sports sponsorship trends that saw $20 billion spent in the US alone in 2014. With numbers at a premium, the division will look to tap into its data to offer sports companies services that range from local/national TV ratings subscriptions and ad effectiveness to media rights valuation and viewership analysis projects.\n\nCynopsis Sports spoke with Tom Sommer, Managing Director of Rentrak Sports about the launch and how it will influence the industry in the years ahead.\n\nSommer on the launch: It has been a pretty exciting ride the last six months, getting a lot of word out there. We only really launched publically this past Monday. The desire from executives from throughout the sports marketing world for a different option to help them better understand their fans is out there, and there is an unquenchable thirst for data.\n\nOn the division: Rentrak’s linear television business is really only a few years old. I think the thought at Rentrak was how to take it to the next level, how do we work with teams, the brands and the agencies. How would they benefit from having a company like ours precisely measure viewership consumption as well as various other data overlays such as the types of cars they are driving, what type of products they buy and so forth. We are really the only shop that can do all that in a syndicated fashion.\n\nOn what makes their data unique: The way Rentrak pulls together its television data is that we work with and pull ratings directly from the set top boxes, drawing estimates from 32 million television sets. So it is a completely massive data set, there are no panels. Compared to the legacy ratings provider, it is substantially a larger sample size. The other thing that is different is that we measure all 210 DMAs, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, every single second. So if the guys from major League Baseball want to know how the All-Star Game did in Dubuque, Iowa, we are the only ones who offer that in a syndicated fashion. A lot of folks are interested in the sheer size of the sample that we offer and once they actually get in and have a meeting with us, they find out about a lot of the other unique things that we can give them and how we overlay that and match it to data sets.\n\nOur branded entertainment offering is something that is very unique because we pull ratings directly from the set top box. When a guy backs up to make a great catch in front of a Budweiser sign, we can actually deliver the audience for that three seconds of airtime. That is a unique aspect that no one has been able to hone in on.\n\nOn sports fans: On Sports fans are crazy and they make incredible decisions based on fanhood and their allegiances. We feel that we are the only company they can help leagues and teams truly understand who the sports fan is and how they consume their content. I always find that there are a number of shops that are good at one or two things. We are good at a bunch of stuff. While our core offering is our ratings platform, on a local level, where traditionally teams or leagues have had to rely on a panel of a couple hundred households, we have tens to hundreds of households in every single DMA.\n\nON THE AIR\n\nWith weather delays wreaking havoc at The Open, ESPN is set to carry Round 4 of the tournament today starting at 6a. Meanwhile, SiriusXM offers live coverage of the final round at 4a.\n\nGolf Channel had another record setting week leading into The Open, announcing that Golf Central Live From St. Andrews drew record audiences from Mon.-Wed. with its highest-rated total days ever, per Nielsen. The channel pulled a .102 HH ratings on Monday for a rise of 62% over 2014, with Tuesday hitting a .110 (up 83%) and Wednesday scored a .156 (up 54%). Meanwhile, the World Golf Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony became the most-watched induction ceremony in channel history with 156,000 average viewers.\n\nFOX Deportes reports that coverage of the 2015 MLB All-Star Game delivered 130,000 total viewers, with 63,000 in the P18-49 demo to rank as the highest total viewer and P18-49 audience delivery of the game in network history. The game was up 44% among total viewers and 215% for P18-49 over last year’s telecast.\n\nSpeaking of baseball, Forbes reports that primetime ratings for each of the Major League Baseball clubs was trending upward overall in local broadcasts. According to Nielsen data of each of the 29 domestic U.S. clubs, 13 clubs are seeing gains this season with 12 taking a dip. The rankings saw ten teams as the highest-rated, most-viewed programming in prime time beating the competition in both broadcast and cable – Royals, Cardinals, Tigers, Pirates, Mariners, Red Sox, Orioles, Padres, Giants, and Diamondbacks. When excluding broadcast television, 25 of 30 clubs are ranked the #1 rated program on cable since the season started.\n\nESPN unveils a new installment of its 30 for 30 documentary series on July 30 with Angry Sky at 8p. Jackass director Jeff Tremaine spotlights the story of Nick Piantanida, a truck driver and exotic pet dealer from New Jersey who dedicated his life to setting an extreme parachuting record.\n\nA CYNOPSIS MESSAGE\n\nTOMORROW, CYNOPSISKIDS WEBINARS WILL BE HOSTING\n\nTHE NEW SECRETS OF SUCCESSFUL APPS FOR KIDS\n\nTuesday, July 21, 2015 I 1:30PM to 3:00PM (ET)\n\nFeatured speakers include Linnette Attai, President & Founder\n\nat\n\nPlayWell, LLC; Sharon Rechter, EVP Business Development & Marketing\n\nat BabyFirst TV; Caitlin O’Donovan VP, Digital, Kids Division at Corus Entertainment; Sara Kloek at Moms With Apps and Moderator Cathy Olson, Editor for Cynopsis Kids Don’t delay, please click HEREfor more information and to REGISTER\n\nSPONSORSHIP & PROMOTION\n\nAs FIFA reconvenes in Zurich to ponder its future, two of the organizations top sponsors are pushing for reform. Reuters reports that Coca-Cola and McDonald’s “both made it clear that they are deeply unhappy with the way FIFA is governed and want major change.” Coca-Cola urged FIFA to support the creation of an independent body to reform the way the organization is operated. \"We have written to FIFA and asked them to support an independent third-party commission for reforms,\" a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola said on Friday. Meanwhile, McDonald’s said it has told FIFA that there needs to be \"meaningful changes to restore trust and credibility with fans and sponsors alike,\" stressing that FIFA’s internal controls and compliance culture \"are inconsistent with expectations McDonald’s has for its business partners throughout the world.\"\n\nNBC Sports will be playing through the American Century Championship through 2022 with Lake Tahoe as host. NBC Sports and American Century Investments announced the seven-year sponsorship extension for the nation’s longest running celebrity golf tournament. “Working in collaboration with NBC, Edgewood and the LTVA, the American Century Championship has become the gold standard of celebrity golf tournaments,” said American Century Investments’ Chief Marketing Officer Mark Killen. “This event provides our company with a high profile platform to tell the story about our unique ownership structure to a national television audience. We’re proud of the fact that more than 40 percent of our profits fund basic research to find cures for cancer and other gene-based diseases. Furthermore, the tournament has served as a backdrop for fundraising activities that have benefitted national charities, as well as worthy non-profits in the Tahoe area.” American Century Investments became title sponsor in 1998.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors were the winners of the 2015 NBA Team Sponsorship Activation of the Year Award by the league. The NBA invited each team to submit its best activations from the 2014-15 season and saw the Raptors team up with Proctor & Gamble and its Swiffer brand to create a program that saw fans who purchased $15 worth of Swiffer products receive an actual piece of the Raptors court from the team’s inaugural 1995-96 season. In addition, the partnership launched the Swiffer “Man Clean” promotion.\n\nThe NFL has reportedly hitting up Canada’s TV regulator in a move to prevent the CTV network from having to air US Super Bowl telecast commercials. The Hollywood Reporter writes that the league wants the CTV to continue maximizing Super Bowl ad revenue with homegrown ads to boost the value of the Canadian broadcast rights for the next time they come up for renewal.\n\nPRODUCTION TECH\n\nGolf oldest major, The Open, saw a new trick as ESPN’s coverage debuted a rotating main announce booth. The booth was situated on a platform adjacent to the 18th fairway and was able to rotate to offer a look of several different scenes out the window behind the main anchor desk, including the No. 1 green, and the “Road Hole,” the 17th. Movement is controlled by a joystick in the hand of the anchor announcer.\n\nFANTASY/GAMING/ESPORTS\n\nA federal judge approved a $60 million settlement stemming from a class-action lawsuit filed against the NCAA and video game maker Electronics Arts. Plaintiffs claimed that athletes’ names and likenesses were illegally used in video games for years.\n\nROSTER MOVES\n\nRob Sine was named President of IMG Learfield Ticket Solutions. Sine joins from the Pac-12 Conference & Pac-12 Sales. “Rob brings to us a strong combination of professional and collegiate sports ticket sales experience,” said Mark Dyer, SVP/Business Ventures at IMG College. “He understands how to harness business intelligence in critical areas like database management and lead generation, which will benefit our organization and our school partners.”\n\nDallas Mavericks President and CEO Terdema L. Ussery II is now heading to Under Armour where he will serve as president of global sports categories, according to multiple reports. Ussery begins on Sept. 14 and will now manage Under Armour’s push to \"drive authenticity and connectivity with consumers,\" the company said in a news release.\n\nTHE MAIN EVENT\n\nFinal round of The Open on ESPN at 6a.\n\nA CYNOPSIS MESSAGE\n\nCYNOPSISWEBINARS\n\nWednesday, August 12 at 1:30PM to 3:00PM (ET)\n\nTRANSFORMING YOUR CAREER:MOVING FROM LINEAR TV TO NEW MEDIA Featured speakers include Steve Bookbinder Co-Founder/CEOat Digital Media Training, John Rohrs, President at Rohrs Media Group, Adam L.
