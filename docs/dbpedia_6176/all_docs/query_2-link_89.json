        "text": "Film and TV measurement firm Rentrak has acquired Los Angeles-based Hollywood Software Inc. (HSI), which develops enterprise tools for managing parts of the digital movie distribution and exhibition industries. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nHSI's tools are designed to capture, manage and analyze data on the movie industry. The firm's Theatrical Distribution System (TDS) is installed in more than 30 studios in the US and Canada, including 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures and Lionsgate; while its Digital Cinema Theatre Management System (TCC) is currently used to manage more than 15,000 screens worldwide.\n\nRentrak will combine its own movie and television intelligence - including Video on Demand viewing information - with HSI's studio and theater planning systems to provide movie studios with films' total viewership over their lifespan. Rentrak says the deal will provide 'never-before-seen' analytics tools to the motion picture industry.\n\nRon Giambra, President of Rentrak's Worldwide Movie Measurement business, says the buy advances the company's commitment to the movie industry 'by continuing to provide products that enable studios and theaters to drive movie attendance and provide an enhanced movie-going experience'.\n\nWeb sites: www.rentrak.com and www.hollywoodsoftware.com .\n\nAll articles 2006-23 written and edited by Mel Crowther and/or Nick Thomas, 2024- by Nick Thomas, unless otherwise stated."
