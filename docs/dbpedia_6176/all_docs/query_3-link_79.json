        "text": "By LINDSEY BAHR\n\nAP Film Writer\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — The Avengers are mighty, but not enough to beat themselves. The Marvel and Disney sequel earned a staggering $187.7 million in its debut weekend, making it the second biggest U.S. opening of all time according to Rentrak estimates Sunday.\n\nBut “Avengers: Age of Ultron” failed to top the all-time record of the first film’s $207.4 million debut in 2012.\n\nAlthough “Ultron” was the only new film in wide release this weekend, it had some significant small screen competition: The Kentucky Derby, the NBA playoffs, and the Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao fight.\n\nNumbers could shift by the time Monday actuals roll in, but it seems the robust counter-programming may have blockaded another record for Marvel and Disney.\n\nStill, for Disney’s head of distribution Dave Hollis, the weekend was a “spectacular result” for the film, which cost a reported $250 million to produce.\n\nPlaying on 4,276 screens, the audiences for “Ultron’s” debut were 59 percent male and 41 percent under the age of 25.\n\n“We’re in rare air here,” said Hollis. “Having the second biggest opening weekend in the history of the movie business is always going to be something you walk away overwhelmingly happy with. The momentum of the brand for Marvel at this point is really something to take a step back and admire.”\n\nMarvel and Disney now boast the top three opening weekends of all time with “Avengers” and its sequel taking the top two slots and “Iron Man 3” in third place.\n\nHollis said this is “confirmation” that these films are “bringing a completely different kind of filmmaking to cinema. They’re creating events and characters and building worlds in a way that is drawing the attention of huge crowds.”\n\nRentrak’s Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian agreed that the failure to top the first film is “in no way” a disappointment.\n\n“You have to put this into perspective. Considering the level of competition this weekend in the sporting world, it shows that movie going holds its own against all other options,” he said.\n\nAlso, while the first film’s $207.4 million haul might just seem like a new benchmark to hit, Dergarabedian was quick to point out that opening above $200 million was “literally like breaking the box office sound barrier.”\n\nInstead of a new industry standard, a $200 million opening might continue to be an industry rarity.\n\n“Ultron’s” future success is not in doubt either.\n\n“These other options were single events. `Avengers’ has a very long playing time. This is a journey to $1 billion and beyond,” he said.\n\nWith $168 million in international sales this weekend, “Avengers: Age of Ultron” has grossed $627 million globally in just 12 days. The film has yet to open in China and Japan.\n\nThe rest of the top five was populated with holdovers, “The Age of Adaline,” `’Furious 7,” `’Paul Blart: Mall Cop,” and the animated “Home.”\n\n——\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” $187.7 million ($168 million international).\n\n2. “The Age of Adaline,” $6.3 million.\n\n3. “Furious 7,” $6.1 million ($52.8 million international).\n\n4. “Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,” $5.6 million ($4.3 million international).\n\n5. “Home,” $3.3 million ($17 million international).\n\n6. “Cinderella,” $2.4 million ($7 million international).\n\n7. “Ex Machina,” $2.2 million.\n\n8. “Unfriended,” $2 million ($3.6 million international).\n\n9. “The Longest Ride,” $1.7 million ($3.5 million international).\n\n10. “Woman in Gold,” $1.7 million.\n\n——\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at international theaters (excluding the U.S. and Canada), according to Rentrak:\n\n1. “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” $168 million.\n\n2. “Furious 7,” $52.8 million.\n\n3. “Silent Separation,” $28 million.\n\n4. “Home,” $17 million.\n\n5. “Helios,” $16.9 million.\n\n6. “The Left Ear,” $15.5 million.\n\n7. “Cinderella,” $7 million.\n\n8. “Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,” $4.3 million.\n\n9. “China Town,” $3.8 million.\n\n10. “Unfriended,” $3.6 million.\n\n——\n\nUniversal and Focus are owned by NBC Universal, a unit of Comcast Corp.; Sony, Columbia, Sony Screen Gems and Sony Pictures Classics are units of Sony Corp.; Paramount is owned by Viacom Inc.; Disney, Pixar and Marvel are owned by The Walt Disney Co.; Miramax is owned by Filmyard Holdings LLC; 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight are owned by 21st Century Fox; Warner Bros. and New Line are units of Time Warner Inc.; MGM is owned by a group of former creditors including Highland Capital, Anchorage Advisors and Carl Icahn; Lionsgate is owned by Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.; IFC is owned by AMC Networks Inc.; Rogue is owned by Relativity Media LLC.\n\n——\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/ldbahr\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
