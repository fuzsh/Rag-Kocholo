        "text": "Multi-screen media measurement firm Rentrak Corp. today announced that Raycom TV has signed a long-term contract expansion for Rentrak’s StationView Essentials local market census-based ratings service in 17 markets.\n\nThis more comprehensive contract includes the integration of the Polk Automotive and Political Segmentation information with Rentrak’s household and demographics ratings. These allow Raycom to sell not only the size of its audiences, but also its “strength” of a particular auto purchaser or political segment, according to Rentrak.\n\nRaycom signed with Rentrak in 2010 for service in two markets, Charlotte, N.C., and Birmingham, Ala. This new agreement expands usage to:\n\nWOIO-WUAB Cleveland-Akron (DMA 18)\n\nWBTV Charlotte, N.C. (25)\n\nWXIX Cincinnati (35)\n\nWFLX West Palm Beach, Fla. (38)\n\nWBRC Birmingham, Ala. (39)\n\nWAVE Louisville, Ky. (48)\n\nWMC Memphis (49)\n\nWWBT-WUPV Richmond, Va. (57)\n\nWTNZ Knoxville, Tenn. (61)\n\nKOLD-KMSB-KTTU Tucson, Ariz. (70)\n\nWTOC Savannah, Ga. (92)\n\nWLBT Jackson, Miss. (93)\n\nWAFB Baton Rouge, La. (94)\n\nWCSC Charleston, S.C. (98)\n\nWMBF Myrtle Beach, S.C. (103)\n\nKLTV Tyler, Texas (107)\n\nWTVM-WXTX Columbus, Ga. (127)\n\n“We believe Rentrak’s measurement can change the way our industry does business because there are significant advantages for both buyers and sellers of ad time,” said Paul McTear, Raycom president-CEO. “We need to take the focus from measurement issues and put it back on the efficiency and effectiveness of local television.”\n\n“Rentrak offers several important attributes our industry has been looking for in local measurement, including stability of data, consistency in methodology between markets, and daily ratings even in the smallest markets,” added Billy McDowell, VP Research at Raycom.\n\nRentrak offers a television ratings database currency that provides daily measurement of all U.S. TV networks in all 210 U.S. TV markets. The service incorporates data from more than 19 million satellite, telco and cable television sets and integrates it with product consumption information."
