        "text": "One year ago at i-com, Comscore and Kantar Media unveiled the first outcome of our strategic alliance to provide world class cross-media audience and campaign measurement capabilities to markets around the world. The industry expressed significant interest in the partnership and our executive briefing allowed us to share our roadmap, which identified Spain as the pilot market, and create a vision of what is possible when you bring together the leading experts on TV and internet audience measurement.\n\nThis year, we shared the i-com stage once again to show progress of our joint efforts in campaign measurement and ground breaking developments in the next frontier of cross media measurement, which include methodologies that are responsive to market needs and can use the scale and granular insights that are achievable with return path data.\n\nManish Bhatia, Chief Product Officer for Comscore, kicked off the briefing with an overview of our partnership with Kantar Media’s sister brand, Millward Brown that is designed to give brands a comprehensive view of digital effectiveness from delivery through to impact. Our combined solutions help marketers determine the full value of a validated impression across all digital platforms, which is vital in an age where ad fraud and viewability continue to create challenges in measuring campaign effectiveness.\n\nNext, Andy Brown the CEO and Chairman of Kantar Media, showcased our partnership in practice including the world’s first Total View service in the Netherlands, which measures online TV and Video alongside all other forms of TV. We also shared our pilot work in the Czech Republic, which delivered a consistent GRP metric across core and extended TV, and demonstrated progress in Spain on programme and campaign reporting. We concluded the executive briefing by looking at the road ahead from the technologies we are bringing together to the opportunities our joint capabilities represent.\n\nThe partnership with Kantar builds on the recent merger of Comscore and Rentrak, who have pioneered the use of return path data to deliver powerful TV measurement. Collectively, our shared aim in the US and international markets is to create a new model for cross-platform measurement, providing clients with actionable data and information that is unique in its granularity and precision.\n\nThe industry is hungry for a new way to measure and maximise content and advertising in a world of changing consumer behaviours. There is great potential ahead for marketers to truly see and understand the total view of media consumption in markets around the world. It requires enormous scale, powerful precision and accurate metrics to create trust in an evolving and complex environment and we are proud to be on the forefront of these developments.\n\nThere is still much progress to be made, but we are eager to innovate fast and move the industry forward together with Kantar. As Josh Chasin our Chief Research Officer said on the final day of i-com, 'cross media measurement is a team sport' and now that we have the star players together, we're ready to play."
