        "text": "Rentrak and leading film player Eros International announced a pact in which the box office tracking company will collect data for Eros titles across India. The first Eros film Rentrak will collect box office data for is Tevar, which is being released today.\n\nIndia is estimated to have 3.5 billion admissions per year with about 11,000 screens serving the market.\n\nRentrak recently set up its India affiliate, becoming the first international major aiming to offer independently verified box office data, hoping to fill a much-needed gap in the Indian industry.\n\n“We are thrilled to work with Eros as we continue to grow our international coverage, which now includes the operation and collection of theatre-level attendance and box office information from 36 countries,” said Rentrak worldwide movie measurement business president Ron Giambra in a statement. “The inclusion of Eros to our service is a powerful addition to our clients in India.”\n\nRead more Bollywood Star Priyanka Chopra Inks Talent Deal With ABC\n\n“I believe this tie-up will help accelerate positive change and herald a new era of transparency in the Indian movie industry,” added Eros International group CEO Jyoti Deshpande.\n\nRentrak recently measured the box office for PK, released via UTV Motion Pictures, a unit of Walt Disney India. The Aamir Khan-starrer became the first Bollywood film to be measured by Rentrak. Since its December 19 release, PK has set box office records as the highest-grossing film of all time in India, collecting about $50 million (3 billion rupees).\n\nLeading Indian studio Eros has been a strong player in both Hindi cinema (Bollywood) and regional films, distributing its titles in over 50 countries. Other Eros projects include last year’s Indo-Canadian release Dr. Cabbie, which co-starred Big Bang Theory actor Kunal Nayyar.\n\nEros’ latest title, Tevar, stars upcoming actor Arjun Kapoor and actress Sonakshi Sinha. The studio’s future releases include Shamitabh, starring Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan."
