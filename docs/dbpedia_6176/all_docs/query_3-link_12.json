        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore., May 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Rentrak (NASDAQ: RENT), the leader in precisely measuring movies and TV everywhere, has introduced Rubik™, an analytics platform that gives clients the power to analyze viewing patterns, advertising exposure and the products viewers use and buy against Rentrak's TV audience ratings.\n\nRubik, which is already in use with 10 major national networks and one major agency holding company, contains Rentrak's unique Advanced Demographics, which merge TV viewing with information about the products consumers buy and the cars they drive. The platform allows networks and advertising agencies to understand and identify the most relevant target households. Among Rubik's features is the ability to combine different segments into a campaign target so that custom reach and frequency reports can be defined and calculated.\n\n\"Rubik is the ultimate tool for optimized planning and TV buying at a national level,\" said Rentrak Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Livek. \"Do you remember playing for hours and weeks on end as a child with the Rubik's Cube? I remember being amazed by its complexity and, yet, its simplicity. Our new analytics platform has taken something very complex—TV viewing merged with the products viewers buy, how they vote, and the cars they drive—and made it simple. Think about a cube, not with nine boxes on a side, but with an endless number on each side. Rubik allows clients to perform complex analytics that help unlock the value of television programming and advertising content with viewers as the target.\"\n\nRentrak's television ratings service is the only fully-integrated system of detailed satellite, telco and cable TV viewing information projected to the total U.S. from more than 32 million TVs nationwide including granular information for TV stations and cable networks in all 210 local markets and nationally.\n\nAbout Rentrak\n\nRentrak (NASDAQ: RENT) is the entertainment and marketing industries' premier provider of worldwide consumer viewership information, precisely measuring actual viewing behavior of movies and TV everywhere.
