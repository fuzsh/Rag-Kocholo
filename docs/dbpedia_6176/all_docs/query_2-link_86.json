        "text": "FLO TV and Rentrak Corporation have aligned to launch the mobile television industry’s first comprehensive viewership and advertising impression reporting using Rentrak’s TV Essentials media measurement system.\n\nThrough their collaboration, FLO TV and Rentrak will deliver reporting that will serve as the currency for advertising sales on FLO TV in the U.S. and provide deeper insights into FLO TV audience viewing patterns while not divulging any individual subscriber’s personal information.\n\nAs mobile TV adoption has continued to rise, the demand for reliable and verifiable viewership data has grown throughout the entertainment, media and advertising industries. Through Rentrak’s TV Essentials reporting system, FLO TV will provide ongoing reports to content providers and advertisers to assist them in their programming and media buying decisions for this emerging platform.\n\n\"This is a significant milestone for FLO TV and also for the mobile multicast TV category,\" said Jonathan Barzilay, senior vice president of programming and advertising, FLO TV. \"Mobile TV is quickly becoming a vital platform for consumers. With our new impression reporting from Rentrak, FLO TV can provide relevant viewership information to advertisers and content partners swiftly and reliably.\""
