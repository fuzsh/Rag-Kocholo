        "text": "Box-office tracking company Rentrak has joined hands with the Indian unit of Mexican multiplex operator Cinepolis, the only international player in India’s theater business.\n\nRentrak set up its Indian affiliate last October, becoming the first international major aiming to offer independently verified box office data. Since then, it has pacted with the likes of leading Bollywood entity Eros International and top producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra‘s banner, which produced recent record-breaking hit PK.\n\nSince its 2009 launch, Cinepolis has grown to approximately 200 screens, boosted by its acquisition of Mumbai-based Fun Cinemas, which was running 83 screens. India’s largest theatrical chain, New Delhi-headquartered PVR Cinemas, operates 462 screens.\n\nCinepolis India is the first multiplex player to pact with Rentrak India.\n\n“We look forward to our partnership with Cinepolis and expanding as they continue to add more screens,” said Ron Giambra, Rentrak’s worldwide movie measurement business president, in a statement.\n\n“India is a very exciting market with tremendous passion for cinema,” added Cinepolis India managing director Javier Sotomayor. “When this passion can be measured accurately in real time and understood in terms of box-office analytics, it will pave way for greater growth in the industry and better movie products for the country as a whole.”\n\nIndia has an estimated 11,000 screens, and box-office data is still largely based on figures reported by distributors and producers rather than being directly sourced from cinema locations, a gap that Rentrak hopes to fill.\n\nIndustry estimates suggest India clocks 3.5 billion admissions per year with total revenues touching $1.5 billion. Given that Indian films are released in various overseas territories, Rentrak says it is already tracking Bollywood titles in 44 countries."
