        "text": "Variety the Children’s Charity of Southern California has tapped veteran Hollywood studio distribution chief Chris Aronson to receive the org’s inaugural Career Achievement Award. The tribute recognizes his work in supporting and championing children, youth, adults and families in need.\n\nAronson currently serves as president of domestic distribution for Paramount Pictures. He did a long stint at 20th Century Fox before it was taken over by Disney in 2019.\n\nAfter beginning his career in exhibition, he decided to transition to Hollywood. He worked at MGM, and also started the theatrical division for Rentrak, which provided comprehensive box office data collection, analysis, and reporting for the film industry (Rentrak ultimately became Comscore).\n\n“Chris is an admired and highly esteemed member in the motion picture industry whose steadfast leadership, dedication to the industry, service to the community, and commitment to philanthropy are unparalleled. We are honored to acknowledge Chris for all that he does to give back to others” says Steve Bunnell, president of Variety the Children’s Charity. (The charity has nothing to do with Variety the trade publication).\n\nAt Paramount, Aronson oversees domestic theatrical distribution and sales for the United States and Canada.\n\n“Chris is synonymous with entertainment and goodwill recognized across the country and around the world for his passion and dedication to the motion picture community and unwavering devotion to non-profits serving in key leadership roles for decades” said Mike Polydoros, CEO, Paper Airplane Media and chairman, Variety the Children’s Charity.\n\nAronson is the past chairman and president of the Will Rogers Motion Pictures Pioneer Foundation, the Lollipop Theater and a key member of Variety’s President’s Council."
