Clients using the OnDemand Essentials system are able to instantly analyze and interpret their own business data to identify trends, program and promote more effectively, as well as track their performance against the broader business sector in which they operate.\n\nSubscribers to Rentrak’s OnDemand Essentials have access to data from all of Rentrak’s participating MSOs including Bresnan Communications, Comcast, Cablevision, Charter and Insight Communications. These MSOs collectively reach more than 50% of all U.S. VOD enabled households.\n\nAbout Rentrak Corporation\n\nRentrak Corporation, based in Portland, Oregon, is an information management company serving clients in the media, entertainment, retail, advertising and manufacturing industries.
