Since then, however, the project has attained mythical status among many advertisers, buyers and network executives. \"I'll believe it when I see it,\" more than one has told me dismissively in recent months.\n\nBut the wait is almost over. Nielsen is putting the finishing touches on total audience measurement and gave Adweek an exclusive look at its new multiplatform measurement tool, which it says will forever change the industry."
