        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore., Oct. 9, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Rentrak (NASDAQ: RENT), the leader in precisely measuring movies and TV everywhere, has agreed to acquire the U.S. television measurement business of WPP's Kantar business unit for $98 million in Rentrak common stock.\n\nThe transaction, when closed, will include Kantar Media's customer contracts and customer relationships involved in U.S. television measurement, creating the benefits of clarity and simplicity for clients in the U.S. TV ratings marketplace with a single massive and passive TV measurement ratings service. This transaction gives Rentrak and Kantar better scale to rapidly innovate their products and services in the United States. No Kantar Media TV measurement or global development capabilities outside of the United States are affected by this transaction.\n\nUnder the agreement, Rentrak will also integrate its national and local TV measurement with a number of Kantar's U.S.-based services that focus on digital media, advertising expenditure and purchase data. The integration will provide advertisers, agencies, TV networks, multichannel video program distributors (MVPDs) and local television stations throughout the U.S. with even more powerful tools to understand consumers' purchasing habits and the ability to link TV viewing habits with purchase and other behavior in the United States.\n\n\"The combined expertise of Kantar and Rentrak will enable clients to better comprehend and leverage the relationship between United States TV viewing and brands,\" said Kantar CEO Eric Salama. \"We are excited about the future products that we can develop with Rentrak for the U.S. television industry. Clients will benefit from our focus on respondent-level media and purchase data.\"\n\n\"This agreement is designed to help all of our U.S. agency and TV advertiser clients with new services in television measurement and consumer insights,\" said Rentrak's Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Livek. \"We are thrilled to be working with WPP and look forward to partnering with Kantar to provide the marketplace with the best next generation of services.\"\n\nAcquisition Terms/Financial Implications\n\nThe stock purchase price equates to approximately 1.53 million Rentrak shares, or 12.4 percent of Rentrak's total shares outstanding, and is valued at $98 million. As part of the agreement, WPP will also purchase shares directly from the company for $56 million in cash, giving WPP a final ownership stake of 16.7 percent of Rentrak's stock. WPP may also purchase Rentrak shares on the open market so long as its total ownership of Rentrak stock does not exceed 20 percent.\n\nRentrak expects the agreement to produce multiple long-term revenue streams resulting directly from the acquisition of Kantar's TV service, as well as from anticipated future joint marketing agreements with Kantar and the company's expanded relationship with, and endorsement from, GroupM. Rentrak expects to add approximately $7 to $9 million in revenue in fiscal 2016 as a result of the transaction, which is expected to be slightly accretive in fiscal 2016.\n\nThe transaction, which is subject to customary regulatory approvals, is anticipated to be completed by the end of calendar 2014.\n\nGoldman, Sachs & Co. served as financial advisor to Rentrak.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThe foregoing paragraphs contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, without limitation, that Rentrak will generate approximately $7 to $9 million in revenue in fiscal 2016 as a result of the transaction and that it will be slightly accretive in fiscal 2016, the ability to close the transaction by the end of calendar 2014, and that the transaction will expand Rentrak's leadership position in television measurement and consumer insights. These forward-looking statements are based on Rentrak's current expectations, estimates and projections about its business and industry, management's beliefs, and certain assumptions, all of which are subject to change. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and Rentrak's actual results may differ significantly as a result of a number of factors, including the company's ability to attract new revenue-sharing customers and retain existing customers, the company's success in maintaining its relationships with studios and other product suppliers, the company's ability to successfully develop and market new products to create new revenue streams, its ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, and Rentrak's customers continuing to comply with the terms of their agreements. Additional factors that could affect Rentrak's financial results are described in Rentrak's reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Results of operations in any past period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.\n\nAbout Kantar\n\nKantar is the data investment management division of WPP and one of the world's largest insight, information and consultancy groups.
