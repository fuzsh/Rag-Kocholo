        "text": "Arzu J.\n\nArzu J.\n\nPublished Oct 21, 2015\n\nIn the last a few years with the introduction of high speed internet TV watching habits have evolved but addressability and subsequent delivery and measurement of media in the TV space have not kept up at the same speed. Today brands are looking to connect with their audiences across all digital channels – TV included. In order to achieve such a high goal, brands want to understand consumers and use precise targeting and measurement. Connecting the dots across all media channels is the Holy Grail of targeting that brands aim to achieve – and all digital vendors are in a race to develop and own.\n\nWhat has been going on?\n\ncomScore recently acquired Rentrak to build a leading, cross-platform measurement company.\n\nThe acquisition is a promising development. It was somewhat speculated after WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrel said he would “welcome them coming together” in late August. Despite Sir Martin’s timely predictions, WPP only owns a minority stake in the company and will not have a board seat.\n\nRentrak has not been shy about its ambitions to build cross-media solutions for media planning, targeting, activation and measurement. Rentrak has sealed a deal with consumer data powerhouse IRI and expanded its relationship with comScore in the last a few months.\n\nCombining comScore’s Internet traffic capability with Rentrak’s set-top TV capability is a compelling measurement combo. It positions comScore directly to challenge the biggest player in the field, Nielsen – whose reported revenues in 2014 were $6.3 billion vs. comScore’s $329M and Rentrak’s $103M. However, the winner of this race will not be determined based on pure capital, they will also need to be able to break silos between TV and digital media and develop a trusted cross-platform metric to determine the most accurate audience measurement.\n\nThe acquisition will speed up the race to deliver a better high-tech solution to measure television ratings and digital media across channels. After the acquisition, it was reported in the media that comScore aims to build a cross-platform currency and Nielsen is building a “total audience” measurement system, which will be rolled out by the end of 2015.\n\nWhat this means for advertisers:\n\nThe acquisition paves a path for enhanced and improved digital audience measurement. There is no denying there is a paramount need in the ad industry to build cross-media solutions for media planning, targeting, activation and measurement.\n\nIt accelerates building solutions/technologies that support cross platform media buying and measurement for TV and digital. This can finally catalyze development of measurement metrics that on par with changing viewing habits.\n\nIt closes gaps that exist in managing and measuring online video and TV viewership and enables brands to move from media buying to audience buying.\n\nIt presents comScore as a viable challenger to Nielsen. It is yet to be determined how much of a challenge the merger will mount to Nielsen’s market position.\n\nWPP’s lack of a majority stake is welcomed news for other holding companies"
