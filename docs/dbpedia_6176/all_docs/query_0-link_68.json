With transformative data science and vast audience insights across digital, linear TV, OTT, and theatrical viewership, Comscore is a third-party source for measurement of cross-platform audiences.\n\nThe company allows the planning, transaction, and evaluation across media platforms. With a data footprint combining digital, linear TV, and theatrical viewership with advanced audience insights, Comscore allows media buyers and sellers to quantify their multiscreen behaviour.\n\nIt also instruments change in television measurement by validating advanced audiences, enabling the industry to evaluate based on consumer behaviours, interests, and lifestyles.\n\nWhile the company has witnessed tremendous success over the years, it recently announced that CEO and Executive Vice Chairman Bill Livek wishes to retire as CEO once his successor is named.\n\nA Little About Livek\n\nAn expert in media measurement since 1978, Livek helped build several measurement companies, including Nielsen Audio, Birch, and Simmons. He was the CEO of Rentrak when it merged with Comscore in 2016. Following the merger, Livek served on the Comscore board before becoming the CEO in 2019, when the company had expanded into the Middle East with a box office measurement service in Saudi Arabia. Through his tenure as CEO, the company scored an operational turnaround, refinanced the balance sheet by delivering product enhancements, and came to be known as the future of modern measurement.\n\nComscore achieved a series of significant technological advancements in 2021. From the launch of a TV measurement suite, Comscore TV to the first measurement provider to deliver deduplicated advertising campaigns on YouTube. It also launched the personification methodology to capture individual-level co-viewing and expanded the Comscore Consumer Intelligence solution to provide monthly reporting of consumer retail visitation tied to television and digital viewing behaviour. The company acquired Shareablee, a marketing analytics and measurement company in the social media space, to expand its Media Metrix and Video Metrix currencies to include Shareablee’s social media engagement and video insights.\n\nComscore continues its winning streak of expanded partnerships and product launches in 2022.\n\nJanuary: Beginning the year with a bang, Comscore introduced Comscore Everywhere, a single-source, cross-platform measurement solution across content, advertising, planning, and optimisation. It provides a comprehensive, consistent, and deduplicated view of media consumption and audience intelligence to capture the realities of modern media consumption. The solution will also create a standard comparable Audience Definition powered by a specific dataset and methodology.\n\nThe solution was built on the success of Comscore Campaign Ratings, which measures deduplicated reach and frequency across linear TV, CTV, and digital. This launch put Comscore in even more direct competition with Nielsen for being the dominant player in cross-media measurement for TV, connected TVs, and streaming platforms.\n\nFebruary: Comscore partnered with DoubleVerify, a software platform for digital media measurement, data and analytics, to develop an integrated media quality verification and audience measurement solution that allows advertisers to measure the impact of their entire media plan seamlessly.\n\n“The industry is simultaneously facing three key megatrends: the search for more accurate deduplicated audience measurement, the mainstream emergence of streaming, and evolving privacy standards,” said Livek.\n\nThe solution combines DV Authentic Ad data, an MRC-accredited metric that verifies ads to be fully viewed in a brand-friendly environment, and within the intended geography, with Comscore Campaign Ratings, which is the cross-platform audience measurement solution offering deduplicated reach and frequency across TV, connected TV (CTV), desktop, and mobile.\n\nMarch: Broadcast TV is still the most effective medium to reach maximum customers, and automated buying provides advertisers easy access to local markets. To optimise this, Comscore expanded its 15-year partnership with WideOrbit, a broadcast TV and radio inventory and revenue workflow management provider, to create next-gen automated linear TV buying and selling. Introducing Comscore TV, the partnership allows automated TV transactions and audience targeting.\n\nEric Mathewson, WideOrbit Founder and CEO, said: “Our partnership with Comscore allows us to provide the data advertisers need for effective targeting, combined with the ease of execution, waste reduction, brand safety, and rate transparency they’ve come to expect from WideOrbit marketplace transactions.”\n\nComscore and Standard Media Index launched an advanced eCPM metric for linear TV advertising. David Algranati, chief product officer, Comscore, said: “As consumer viewing behaviour continues to evolve rapidly, eCPMs unified metric will provide both the buy-side and sell-side a greater understanding of the competitive marketplace.” Combining census-based pricing data from SMI with census-based viewing data from Comscore, the metric creates estimated CPM-based pricing for a more effective inventory and investment strategy across all media.\n\nToday, with over 1700 people worldwide comprising data scientists, product engineers, customer success partners, and more, the company has had a successful reign for over four decades. It continues to be the transformative source for data and measurement."
