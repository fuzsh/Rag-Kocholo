        "text": "Media measurement is not only getting more complicated, it’s getting nastier. So how should one make sense of this world of sharpening elbows and its witches’ brew of data science and art?\n\nJust this week Nielsen announced a significant new innovation with the upcoming release of its ‘Social Content Ratings.’ While previously limited to Twitter, Nielsen will now expand the “listenable” conversations about TV that it will track, analyze and report on to include Facebook. Nielsen plans to make this available in the U.S., Australia, Italy and Mexico by mid-2016.\n\nEverybody likes to beat up on Nielsen (akin to the treatment of local cable operators and the federal government), but its newly-expanded social media measurement tool will help those seeking a better understanding of how effectively video programming is connecting with targeted audiences. I have to be skeptical, however, about the statement from Sean Casey, President of Nielsen Social, referring to this new service as a “comprehensive, standardized picture of how consumers are responding to program content through social media.” There is too much ferment throughout the media measurement world to claim much of a “comprehensive” mantle right now.\n\nNetflix and NBCUniversal also engaged in a new variation on age-old ratings battles this week. Established media companies have been trying to figure out for years the degree to which Netflix is a friend (“Hey, Wall Street, Netflix just paid millions of dollars to license my reruns!”) or foe (“Yes, Mr. Advertiser, Netflix is stealing my audience at 10 o’clock!”). We’re used to TV networks scrapping for ratings supremacy, including over ratings interpretations, but NBCU and Netflix are now in a pitched battle over what should define a legitimate “rating.”\n\nNBCU claims that viewership of even programming Netflix trumpets as its most viewed actually draws but a fraction of that on broadcast or cable networks. As reported in Variety, NBCU claimed that an average episode of Netflix’s ‘Jessica Jones’ averaged only 4.8 million adults 18-49 (the highly-valued “demo” in broadcast speak) over the course of a 35-day viewing cycle. By comparison, a hit show like “The Voice” can approach those numbers in a single night.\n\nOf course, Nielsen doesn’t measure Netflix viewing, so NBCU went to an entirely new and untried source of ratings – a company called Symphony that collects “granular individual behavioral cross media data in real time” from smartphone audio (I told you this stuff was complicated). Ironically given the years of complaints from NBCU and its brethren over the relatively small Nielsen sample size, Symphony’s data is based on a panel (15,000 users) that stands in for millions of Netflix subscribers. Maybe not all panels are created equal.\n\nNetflix fired back quickly, with the company’s Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos calling NBCU’s data “remarkably inaccurate” and noting that as a subscription service with no advertising its metrics for success render this type of data irrelevant. But with so much viewership of traditional TV programming on Netflix, and needs of content providers (if not advertisers) to understand where Netflix usage fits into their broader distribution picture, some form of greater disclosure – dare I say “ratings” - of Netflix content is inevitable. The only immediate clarity from the NBCU-Netflix skirmish is that it is only the beginning, not the end of such battles.\n\nA host of other fascinating developments on the measurement front has been underway as well. Earlier this fall FOX became the first broadcast network to drop Nielsen’s traditional “Live + Same Day” ratings, leaning on measurements that take into account delayed DVR and VOD viewing. The merger of major Nielsen competitors comScore and Rentrak is expected to close shortly, and as I previously wrote many in the industry seem to be rooting on that combination. Cable operator Cablevision (soon to be acquired by Altice) is on the threshold of selling deep data analytics based on the second-by-second viewership data from its set-top box, opening another new floodgate. Meanwhile, every website and app that runs video is ready to demonstrate usage with their own “first party data” and we have a burgeoning industry in \"social listening\" as well.\n\nNielsen itself is hardly taking this activity lying down, as it will shortly go to market with its Total Audience Measurement, a potentially game-changing approach to measuring media consumption across traditional linear TV, connected TVs (Roku, Apple TV, etc.), mobile, tablets and beyond. And beside (bestride?) all of this lie the walled-gardens of Google and Facebook with their own limitless supply of consumer usage data.\n\nGiven an absence of uniformity in the near-future for measuring media, what is a network, a digital-first content producer or a major brand (or their agency) to do?"
