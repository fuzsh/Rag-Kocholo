        "text": "In 2005, the state and the city of Portland handed over more than $900,000 in no-interest loans and grants to Rentrak Corp. in hopes the maker of software for the entertainment industry would remain in Oregon.\n\nRentrak stayed put. The state and city forgave the loans.\n\nFive years later, Rentrak has again played the Vancouver card.\n\nFaced with the threat of the company moving across the Columbia River, the\n\nvoted unanimously Wednesday to tweak the borders of a state enterprise zone to include Rentrak's Northeast Portland headquarters. That change positions the company to participate in state tax credit programs that could cut the company's state income and property tax bills by more than $5 million over five years.\n\nThe issue illustrates the opportunity facing Portland companies and the resulting dilemma facing Oregon lawmakers.\n\nAs Rentrak has now proven twice, companies that make a credible threat to move can extract significant concessions from Oregon politicians. In the face of persistent double-digit unemployment, it's hard to blame public officials for emptying their goody bags of incentives to retain jobs. On the other hand, every package of corporate tax breaks worsens the state's gaping $3.5 billion budget hole.\n\nOutgoing\n\nhelped make the Rentrak tax breaks happen as one of his last official duties -- knowing full well the impact on the state's painful bottom line.\n\n\"Once you set up tax breaks, there is less revenue coming into the general fund, there's no doubt about that,\" Kulongoski said. \"But no one wants to be a position of having let 230 jobs walk across the river. You want to know the hardest issue? You do this for Rentrak, what do you say to the next company?\"\n\nDavid Chemerow, Rentrak chief operating officer and chief financial officer, said the company's allegiance to Oregon paled compared with the bottom-impacts of moving. \"In our hearts and guts, we would love to stay here\" in Portland, Chemerow said. \"But the savings in terms of cheaper real estate and the huge savings in terms of the corporate taxes made that real difficult.\"\n\nRentrak occupies an obscure data measurement corner of the entertainment industry. Its core business for years has been a suite of software products that allows movie studios to track video rentals and purchases at the thousands of video stores across the country.\n\nAs\n\n,\n\nkiosks and video-on-demand slowly kill off much of the traditional home video retail business, Rentrak's own bottom line has suffered.\n\nThe company eked out a profit of $576,000 in its 2010 fiscal year, which ended March 31. Its revenue for the year declined to $91 million, the lowest since 2004.\n\nBut the company is making a move into the much larger business of measuring viewership of movies, video on demand and television. It's taking on\n\n, the long-time king of the television ratings business.\n\nSales in Rentrak's new business is forecast to exceed $36 million this fiscal year, three times the level of 2009.\n\n\"They're now in a much larger market with much higher margins,\" said Todd Mitchell, an analyst with\n\nin New York. \"I would say that, without getting partisan or anything, this is the kind of thing that Portland's looking for. They're going to be growing their business, they're going to be adding high-knowledge jobs.\"\n\nPublic officials knew little about Rentrak's ambitious diversification efforts. They saw only the potential loss of 230 jobs and the average wage of $65,000.\n\nWhen news leaked that Rentrak was considering a move to Clark County, they moved fast. Company executives told Oregon officials that they could save between $4 million and $6 million a year by moving to Vancouver.\n\nSome of the savings came from the cheaper rent in Vancouver. But most of it, according to Chemerow, was due to lower state business taxes in Washington.\n\nThat was far more than that\n\ncould make up with its relatively small business loan program. But by coincidence, a state enterprise zone came fairly near Rentrak's building at 7700 NE Ambassador Place near\n\n.\n\nExpanding the boundary of the zone to include Rentrak's building made the company eligible for significant tax breaks, specifically the state's e-commerce tax credit program. The program allows companies to take state income tax credits equal to 25 percent of the total investment in certain qualifying technology.\n\nIn Rentrak's case, that could mean as much as $5 million in income tax credits over five years, said Patrick Quinton, business and industry division manager at the PDC.\n\nChemerow refused to divulge what Rentrak has paid in Oregon taxes.\n\nSome Legislators have no patience for the private-sector demands.\n\n, D-Portland, pointed out that\n\nin October ranked Oregon as the sixth best state in the country in which to do business. The complaint that Oregon is a terrible place for companies \"is just business bologna, it's propaganda,\" he said. \"We're in the lowest 10 states in the country in business taxation.\"\n\nIn the end, local officials felt retaining Rentrak and its 230 jobs was worth the cost. For\n\n, it was an easy vote.\n\n\"It comes down to the jobs,\" Saltzman said. \"These are good jobs, good salaries. We need to keep them in the city. Everything has to be looked at case to case. The $3.5 billion deficit is only going to get worse if we lose more income tax payers. If these people become Washington state residents, then it won't contribute anything at all to the Oregon deficit.\"\n\n--"
