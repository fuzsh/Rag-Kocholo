        "text": "Five Current Providers of Set Top Box Data Invited to Participate\n\nNEW YORK – November 2, 2009 — On November 10, the Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement (CIMM) will meet with the first five in a group of companies that are currently providing set top box data to see how they and CIMM can work together to help foster research innovation in that area. The meetings are a first step in CIMM’s RFP process, which will initially focus on set top box measurement. The group’s other area of focus, cross platform video measurement, will be addressed shortly.\n\nThe five companies are Nielsen, Rentrak, TiVo, TRA and TNS. The meetings will be completely proprietary and will solicit feedback from the organizations about the set top box RFP process and how they would like to work with CIMM going forward. CIMM will also help provide the organizations with more detail on their expectations and discuss potential projects they’d like the groups to consider.\n\nCIMM is holding this first series of meetings to break away from the traditional RFP process of designating one “winner” among multiple proposals across the industry. Instead, recognizing that the development of new measurement systems poses significant challenges, CIMM intends to foster a collaborative relationship with various data and technology providers to help identify and fund multiple projects that meet the group’s criteria."
