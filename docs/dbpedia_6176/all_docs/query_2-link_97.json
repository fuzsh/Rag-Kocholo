        "text": "A less-known fact is that the total hours of primetime viewing across live TV, digital video recorders and VOD services are on the rise, according to Rentrak, a TV and movie measurement firm out of Portland, Ore.\n\nRentrak is firing on all cylinders to capture this data and then resell it to advertisers.\n\nThe key to its rising success: second-by-second measurement of what people watch on 60 million TV sets, whether live, on DVR or VOD. Combined with consumer-behavior data from its partners, Rentrak is able to provide very specific consumer-targeting information that advertisers use to place ads and efficiently manage their ad-spend budgets — something that it maintains that no one in the industry has been able to replicate.\n\n“We merge things like auto registrations with precise TV viewing,” said Bill Livek, CEO of Rentrak. So, when General Motors advertises a particular car, it’s able to target consumers who already own competitive brands and not just 25- to 54-year-olds, he says."
