        "text": "Rentrak Seals Mobile TV Ratings Deal\n\nIn the US, audience measurement firm Rentrak has announced a deal to provide local market mobile broadcast TV ratings to twelve major broadcast networks operating the Dyle mobile television service.\n\nThe Dyle application is run by Mobile Content Venture (MCV) and is active in 35 US media markets, representing more than 90 stations. The application pipes live broadcast programming, including news, sports and entertainment, to devices equipped with the ATSC-Mobile DTV standard.\n\nRentrak's Mobile Essentials and StationView Essentials solutions will be used to give MCV members integrated ratings from traditional TV and broadcast mobile TV. MTV adds: 'as opposed to other measurement services that provide sample-based data, Rentrak will offer MCV members census-level data, giving them insight into the entire population using live mobile TV services.'\n\nSalil Dalvi and Erik Moreno, co-General Managers of MCV, said in a statement: 'Live mobile TV is an emerging medium, so it's critical that we take the necessary steps to ensure it will scale as traditional TV has over the years'.\n\nCathy Hetzel, Corporate President at Rentrak and President of its booming AMI Division, comments: 'With more than 200 station clients, Rentrak is proud to provide members of MCV with the opportunity to capitalize and monetize multi-platform advertising sales opportunities by having broadcast mobile TV performance aligned directly with TV ratings.'\n\nWeb site: www.rentrak.com ."
