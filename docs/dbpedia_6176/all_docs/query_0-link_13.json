        "text": "ComScore has closed the acquisition of Rentrak in a stock-for-stock deal.\n\nThe company said early Monday that it has completed the deal that creates a digital and TV audience measurement powerhouse looking to challenge Nielsen. It vowed to deliver “the future of measurement.”\n\nComScore was founded in 1999 to measure traffic to websites. Rentrak was founded in 1977 to measure more traditional media, including box office and home video sales, and has become a player in measuring TV.\n\n“This merger brings together two great entrepreneurial companies that invented their respective fields and their respective trusted currencies,” said comScore CEO Serge Matta. “Both have been driven to create innovative technology platforms that use massive data scale to measure increasingly fragmented consumer behavior. Together these two principal architects of the multiscreen future will deliver the cross-platform currencies that have been demanded for so long.”\n\nThe larger company reports data in more than 75 countries. In the U.S., comScore will now be measuring behavior on more than 260 million desktop screens, 160 million cellphone screens, 95 million tablet screens, 40 million TV screens, 120 million VOD screens and 40,000 movie theater screens representing well over 100 million moviegoers, the company said.\n\n“The cross-platform world is changing rapidly and this change demands relentless inventiveness, agility and collaborative intelligence,” added Matta. “These are qualities on which both companies have built their success. This proven ability to precisely measure extremely fragmented, dynamic audiences in dramatic, innovative ways, and to quickly report on it, has provided the insights that allow our clients to act with great competitive advantages.”"
