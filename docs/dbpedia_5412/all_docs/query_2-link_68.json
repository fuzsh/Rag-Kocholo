        "text": "Here's the songs included on the playlist:\n\n1 Papa Gene's Blues From The Monkees\n\n2 Sweet Young Thing From The Monkees\n\n3 All The King's Horses From The Monkees (Deluxe)\n\n4 The Kind of Girl I Could Love (Original Stereo Version) (2006 Remaster) From More of The Monkees\n\n5 You Told Me (2007 Remaster) From Headquarters\n\n6 You Just May Be The One (2007 Remastered Version) From Headquarters\n\n7 Sunny Girlfriend (2007 Remastered Version) From Headquarters\n\n8 The Girl I Knew Somewhere (First Recorded Version) (Alternate Mono Mix) From Headquarters\n\n9 Salesman (2007 Remastered Version) From Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.\n\n10 The Door Into Summer (2007 Remastered Version) From Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.\n\n11 Love Is Only Sleeping (2007 Remaster) From Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.\n\n12 What Am I Doing Hangin' 'Round (2007 Remastered Version) From Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.\n\n13 Don't Call On Me (2007 Remastered Version) From Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16 Writing Wrongs From The Birds, The Bees, & The Monkees\n\n17 Magnolia Simms From The Birds, The Bees, & The Monkees\n\n18 Circle Sky (Alternate Mix) From Missing Links, Vol. 3\n\n19 I Won't Be the Same without Her From Instant Replay\n\n20 Don't Wait for Me From Instant Replay\n\n21 While I Cry From Instant Replay\n\n22 St. Matthew (Alternate Mix) From Instant Replay\n\n23 Good Clean Fun From The Monkees Present: Micky, David & Michael\n\n24 Never Tell a Woman Yes From The Monkees Present: Micky, David & Michael\n\n25 Listen to the Band (Alternate Stereo Mix) From The Monkees Present: Micky, David & Michael\n\n26 Oklahoma Backroom Dancer From The Monkees Present: Micky, David & Michael\n\n27 Me & Magdalena From Good Times!\n\n28 Birth of an Accidental Hipster From Good Times!\n\n29 I Know What I Know From Good Times!\n\nThe playlist is purported to be chronological.\n\nSo the missing tracks are likely from Head. Daddy's Song & Ditty Diego - War Chant?\n\nAnd I’ll take the raw energy of the live version, from the film, with the four Monkees playing, over any of the studio takes.\n\nFrom the HEAD sessions there’s also an alternate take of Mike singing “Daddy’s Song,” which of course Davy ultimately sang for the film and soundtrack. But Mike vocal’s been included as a bonus track with HEAD reissues.\n\nBut one of those missing tracks has to be “Tapioca Tundra,” and I’d bet it’s the alternate take of “Auntie’s” as previously mentioned.\n\nPlenty more alternate takes and unreleased (At the time) songs that Mike sang: “I Don’t Think You Know Me,” “Of You,” “Propinquity,” “Nine Times Blue,” “Some of Shelly’s Blues,” “If I Ever Get to Saginaw Again,” “Down the Highway,” “Angel Band,” “Hollywood,” “Carlisle Wheeling,” “The Crippled Lion” and probably more I’m forgetting.\n\nThat’s the CD that also has the instrumental coda tacked back on to “Porpoise Song.”\n\nI’d like to snag that CD for that reason alone. Never liked how the original soundtrack ends the song early. Rhino’s LP and cassette from 1986 added the coda, but never on CD except for that UK edition.\n\nAMEN......saw Mike solo in concert in the early seventies, a pioneer artist..I also like parsons ...an amazing artist...Agree....all know RHF has always been a joke wenner hobby horse vanity press ...he ruins everything, rolling Stone mag in the seventies, the RHF as is the main dude there...\n\nYea, the Monkees should be in the RRHOF but I quit caring about eons ago. I kinda doubt anything will happen at this point for the Monkees getting in.\n\nI visited the rock hall once sometime ago, and it basically reminded me of what you would find in a Hard Rock Cafe, if you've been to one of those. ... It's OK, but it's not all THAT."
