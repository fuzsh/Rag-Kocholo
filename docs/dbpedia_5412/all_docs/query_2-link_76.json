        "text": "This morning let’s put the spotlight on Michael Nesmith, known best as a Monkee but also for his long and influential career in music. He died on Friday at the age of 78.\n\n\"With Infinite Love we announce that Michael Nesmith has passed away this morning in his home, surrounded by family, peacefully and of natural causes,\" his family wrote in a statement posted on Nesmith's website. \"We ask that you respect our privacy at this time and we thank you for the love and light that all of you have shown him and us.\"\n\nFor today’s 9:30 Coffee Break, what Michael Nesmith songs do you want to hear?\n\nTributes and messages have been pouring in about Nesmith:\n\n\"I'm heartbroken,\" his bandmate Micky Dolenz said, in a statement provided by a spokesperson. \"I've lost a dear friend and partner. I'm so grateful that we could spend the last couple of months together doing what we loved best – singing, laughing, and doing shtick. I'll miss it all so much. Especially the shtick.\"\n\nMonkees manager Andrew Sandoval tweeted: \"It is with deep sadness that I mark the passing of Michael Nesmith. We shared many travels and projects together over the course of 30 years, which culminated in a Monkees farewell tour that wrapped up only a few weeks ago. That tour was a true blessing for so many. And in the end I know that Michael was at peace with his legacy which included songwriting, producing, acting, direction & so many innovative ideas and concepts. I am positive the brilliance he captured will resonate and offer the love and light towards which he always moved.\"\n\nBen Gibbard paid tribute on his Death Cab for Cutie Instagram page with a series of covers of songs written by Nesmith including “Different Drum”, “The Crippled Lion”, “Joanne”, “You Just May Be The One” and “Me & Magdalena”. Gibbard said in the post, “Mike Nesmith passed today and I feel completely gutted. I also feel so fortunate to have called him a friend. I believe the best way to mourn the loss of a musician is to play their music. When we do so we keep the beauty of their spirit alive in our hearts. With that said, please enjoy this selection of some of my favorite Nez songs. Rest In Peace, Papa Nez. I am so grateful to have known you. “\n\nBrian Wilson tweeted: “I’m sorry to hear about Mike Nesmith. The Monkees had some great songs, those were fun days. Love & Mercy to Mike’s family and friends, Brian”.\n\nPaul Stanley of Kiss tweeted: \"WOW! Sometimes it's hard to know why someone's passing hits you a certain way but this is another one that hit me. I watch my world change as people that I thought to be timeless pass on, and that is sobering. Lives end and life goes on. RIP Mike Nesmith.\"\n\nSusanna Hoffs, founding member of The Bangles tweeted \"Peace & love, Mike Nesmith\" and covered ‘Different Drum’.\n\nRob Zombie tweeted: \"The great Mike Nesmith has died. He was the coolest. #ripmikenesmith #themonkeesrule #listentotheband\"\n\nStevie Van Zandt tweeted: \"RIP Mike Nesmith. He lives forever in the Underground Garage.\"\n\nSteven Page of Barenaked Ladies tweeted: \"One of the all-time greatest. Rest In Peace Michael Nesmith.\"\n\nRespond with your song ideas in the comments below."
