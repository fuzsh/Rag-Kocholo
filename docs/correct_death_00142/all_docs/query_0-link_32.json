        "text": "John Williams is probably one of the most well known composers in history. If there’s any doubt in anyone’s mind, just think back to some of the most iconic movies of the past (like Jaws, Star Wars, E.T., Schindler’s List, Jurassic Park, Harry Potter, and even Memoirs of a Geisha) and the most striking feature about all of these movies is their amazing soundtracks. They compel and spellbind us; tying magical stories together with even more poignant melodies to captivate the mind’s imagery.\n\nIf you have ever heard of the grateful dead than you will know that Jerry really was a main key to that band. The Grateful Dead Movie ,released in 1977 and directed by Jerry Garcia. This means that he cared about his band. He was such a big part of the band. He wrote most of the songs for the Grateful dead. He worked hard for his band to be successful. He tried so hard to make sure that it meant something to him. I think that you can see the amount of thought and work went into the songs.He was such a big part of this band that they changed the name to Dead and\n\nMusical theater has been filled with countless talented composers. The amount of talent in the theater world is endless, but only few composers gain iconic status. The Gershwins, Rogers & Hammerstein, and Stephen Sondheim come to mind when thinking of the pinnacle of composing. One other man who deserves his permanent place with these others would be Cole Porter. Porter’s extensive library of songs has become classics along with a series of hit musicals that are still done in high mass today. Porter had his share of incredibly tough times, and it simply only makes his rise to the top even more impressive. Cole Porter is without a doubt one of the best composers to ever write for the stage in history.\n\nA composer depends entirely upon the nature of the film for all the clues needed to write a suitable score for a film. Brought into the production after a certain amount of film has been shot, the films concept will dictate how the composer will write the music. Whether based on the story line, or providing information by setting an atmospheric state, film music will always have different purposes between different films. Penguin Ballet by Nigel Westlake was composed to focuses upon the graceful, almost ballet like movements of the penguins underwater. Whereas, Writings on the wall by Sam Smith conveys ideas and messages which will be expressed throughout the film, especially through the use of lyrics. Although positioned within the film to provide contrasting messages, both these songs use similar musical elements to support the piece, and its position with the film. The discussion of this essay is that there are similarities between the musical elements that support the lyrics in a song and the action in a documentary. Through this, we will discuss the musical element’s of pitch, and timbre and texture.\n\nFrom captaining the American Navy’s most prized frigates to being a man every sailor could actively interact with, John Barry established himself to be an exceptional naval leader and hero. He guided his ships and sailors through many successful battles which were key in the establishment of the American Navy. Despite his great influence, Barry never put his personal interests in front of the Navy’s, and his dedication to the service centuries ago created the dominant Navy and Marine Corps team present today. Because he was an expert and popular mariner, a focused individual, and a naval visionary, John Barry was able to earn the title of “Father of the American Navy.”\n\nA few pieces gave me emotional responses .The theme from “Jaws” made me tense up a little, the music reminded me of the movie and made very conscious of my surroundings. I didn’t want anything to happen to me. As I mentioned earlier I enjoy Star Wars and Harry Potter, so when they played the music I was a little excited about these music pieces being played. The highlight musical piece would have to be the Suite from “Star Wars”. All of the pieces were great but,\n\nSome of the most well known composers came to be in the in the classical music period. Ludwig van Beethoven was one of the composers, along with other greats of the time like Haydn and Mozart, which helped to create a new type of music. This new music had full rich sounds created by the new construction of the symphony orchestra.\n\nIn 2001 space odyssey, as formentioned, he uses light classical music juxtaposed with the dark mysteries that surround the mission and the spaceship Discovery One. The music provides a sense of serenity as well as discombobulated feel like one might feel in space. As with all of his films there was great attention to detail and it was visually stunning as well as aesthetically pleasing. One specific shot of beauty is in the beginning of the movie titled “dawn of man” after the apes jump around the monolith, the sun is setting behind a flat topped hill and the moon is juxtaposed right above it with golden clouds all around. Also in this movie, the reoccurring theme of an unsavory character that we are manipulated into sympathizing with is HAL during the\n\nWhen he created the score for A Crimson Tide, he used a large choir and it featured a majestic symphonic score, as well as 3-D sound effects to enhance the film with action and suspense. Despite his choice to take the path less glittered, he still received recognition for A Crimson Tide. He won a Grammy for the score, and received another Academy Award nomination for The Preacher’s Wife. That same year, the performing rights organization BMI presented him with its prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award before Zimmer was 40 years old, which is a great achievement on his part. And in 1998 he received yet another Academy Award nomination on the movie As Good As It Gets (1998). In the late 1990’s, Zimmer accepted a head position of the music division with the Dreamworks SKG studio. While he was there, he supervised for all of their"
