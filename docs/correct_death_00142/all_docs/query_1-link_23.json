He was 75. Goldsmith won five Emmys and was nominated for 17 Academy Awards winning only one.\n\nThe following are just some of the scores he wrote:\n\nMovies:\n\nPlanet of the Apes\n\nAlien\n\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture\n\nThe Omen (for which he won his only Oscar)\n\nPoltergeist\n\nPatton\n\nBasic Instinct\n\nChinatown\n\n*\n\nTV:\n\nThe Man From U.N.C.L.E\n\nThe Waltons\n\nBarnaby Jones\n\nStar Trek: Voyager\n\n*\n\nHis wife, Carol, stated that when asked which score was his favorite, Goldsmith always repied, \"My favorite score is the one I haven't written yet.\"\n\nHe used to lecture his film school students that if they were scoring a scene for a man on a horse galloping away, you don't score the gallop but you score the fear of the rider."
