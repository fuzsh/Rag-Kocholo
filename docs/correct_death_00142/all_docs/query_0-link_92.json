        "text": "Today is Monday, July 21, the 202nd day of 2014. There are 163 days left in the year.\n\nToday’s Highlights in History:\n\nOn July 21, 1944, American forces landed on Guam during World War II, capturing it from the Japanese some three weeks later. The Democratic national convention in Chicago nominated Sen. Harry S. Truman to be vice president.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1773, Pope Clement XIV issued an order suppressing the Society of Jesus, or Jesuits. (The Society was restored by Pope Pius VII in 1814.)\n\nIn 1861, during the Civil War, the first Battle of Bull Run was fought at Manassas, Virginia, resulting in a Confederate victory.\n\nIn 1925, the so-called “Monkey Trial” ended in Dayton, Tennessee, with John T. Scopes found guilty of violating state law for teaching Darwin’s Theory of Evolution. (The conviction was later overturned on a technicality.)\n\nIn 1930, President Herbert Hoover signed an executive order establishing the Veterans Administration (later the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs).\n\nIn 1949, the U.S. Senate ratified the North Atlantic Treaty.\n\nIn 1959, the NS Savannah, the first nuclear-powered merchant ship, was christened by first lady Mamie Eisenhower at Camden, New Jersey.\n\nIn 1961, Capt. Virgil “Gus” Grissom became the second American to rocket into a sub-orbital pattern around the Earth, flying aboard the Liberty Bell 7.\n\nIn 1972, the Irish Republican Army carried out 22 bombings in Belfast, Northern Ireland, killing nine people and injuring 130 in what became known as “Bloody Friday.”\n\nIn 1973, Israeli agents in Lillehammer, Norway, killed Ahmed Bouchikhi, a Moroccan waiter, in a case of mistaken identity, apparently thinking he was an official with Black September, the group that attacked Israel’s delegation at the 1972 Munich Olympics and killed 11 athletes.\n\nIn 1980, draft registration began in the United States for 19- and 20-year-old men.\n\nIn 1994, Britain’s Labor Party elected Tony Blair its new leader, succeeding the late John Smith. Former Senate Republican leader Hugh Scott died in Falls Church, Virginia, at age 93.\n\nIn 1999, Navy divers found and recovered the bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn, and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, in the wreckage of Kennedy’s plane in the Atlantic Ocean off Martha’s Vineyard. Advertising executive David Ogilvy died in Bonnes, France, at age 88.\n\nTen years ago: President George W. Bush sketched out a second-term domestic agenda, telling campaign donors he would shift focus to improving high school education and expanding access to health care. Academy Award-winning composer Jerry Goldsmith died in Beverly Hills, California, at age 75. Richard Bloch (cq), co-founder of H&R Block, the world’s largest tax preparer, died in Kansas City, Missouri, at age 78.\n\nFive years ago: The Senate voted to terminate further production of the Air Force’s topline F-22 fighter jets. Prosecutors in Cambridge, Massachusetts, dropped a disorderly conduct charge against prominent black scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr., who was arrested by a white officer at his home near Harvard University after a report of a break-in. John “Marmaduke” Dawson, a longtime Grateful Dead collaborator and co-founder of New Riders of the Purple Sage, died in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico at 64. Taco Bell mascot Gidget the Chihuahua died in Santa Clarita, California, at 15.\n\nOne year ago: Belgium’s King Albert abdicated after a 20-year reign; his son Philippe took over as the fractured nation’s seventh king. Phil Mickelson won the British Open, shooting a 5-under 66 to match the best round of the tournament and win his first claret jug. Britain’s Chris Froome won the 100th Tour de France."
