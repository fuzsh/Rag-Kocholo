        "text": "NOOOOOOOOO!!!\n\nI have been obsessed (well, almost) with Goldsmith since I was 11. Seriously. When I started spending my babysitting money on music, my first album was a Jerry Goldsmith album (“The Wind and the Lion”). I have collected his LPs and CDs ever since. I don’t know how many I have, but I think I have most of what he’s had in print (missed a few, though). It’s in the hundreds, I am sure. I alwas looked forward to buying his latest CD and looked forward to seeing what he was doing next.\n\nIn 1999 I saw a wonderful concert of his at the Hollywood Bowl. It was great and he seemed so humble and natural. And his music was great.\n\nI always knew that the day would come when he wouldn’t be doing any more CDs, because he’d go to the Big Composer’s Room in the sky, but I hate hearing about it. I hate that the day is here. And I know he’s had a full life and has been so prolific, so it isn’t as if he hasn’t done enough. But damn. Damn damn damn damn.\n\nRIP Jerry. I will miss you, more than anything.\n\nYes, Cervaise, it still pisses me off that Goldsmith only got that one Oscar (for “The Omen”) while other lesser scores kept on winning and winning and winning.\n\nI especially felt the blow of him losing yet another Oscar when he lost for “Under Fire,” probably one of his most outstanding scores. The scuttlebut around town (or at least according to the LA Times) was that “Under Fire” was a sure thing to win, but apparently (the LA Times speculated at the time), everyone assumed everyone else was going to vote for it, so not enough people did vote for it. Or something. All I know is that I was so shocked when he did not win for that one. It was a great score.\n\nAnd yes—“LA Confidential” is also a brilliant score. Other favorites of mine are (let me think . . . ) “Planet of the Apes,” “Patton,” “The Wind and the Lion,” “Criminal Law” (an unusual choice that grows on you), “Link,” (bizarre and a somewhat repetitive, but I loved it), “The Omen” (wonderful), “The Shadow,” The Mummy,\" “Ghost in the Darkness,” “First Knight,” “Gremlins II” (surpisingly good but strange), and on and on and on and on. I was trying to go through his list of credits on IMDb and I realized that I had just too many to pick from.\n\nRight now I’m listening to all the tracks by him that I have in iTunes (which are quite a lot) and I just happen to be hearing the track called “Almost a Wife” from his strange and quirky score to “The Illustrated Man.” Damn. That track always stands out for me because it’s so haunting and poignant. He was (I hate that I have to write “was”) a remarkable composer.\n\nMy family and friends know there won’t me any living with me for a while. I’ll be mainlining Goldsmith scores for a long time to come (as if I didn’t play him frequently enough as it was . . . )\n\nHe also did the theme for Star Trek: Voyager (I’m sure someone else has mentioned that). The thing that amazed me was the theme for Voyager was up for an Emmy for best TV Theme the same year as the theme for Friends. Now, knowing how these things work, I automatically assumed that Friends would win. I mean, it’s a pop song (pop songs or scores seem to often have an edge when it comes to these kinds of awards) and it’s Friends. But, much to my amazement, Voyager won! I was flabbergasted but pleased.\n\nOther themes he did were for Police Story (very catchy, too), the score of which I recently got on CD. He also did Room 222 and Barnaby Jones, which are played in a musical suite on one of his albums and also was played at the Hollywood Bowl concert I went to.\n\nBaker, yes, the theme to Patton is quite something, isn’t it? I heard somewhere (or read somewhere, can’t remember), that the somewhat eerie-sounding echoing triplets on the horn symbolize Patton’s belief in reincarnation, the military march part in the theme symbolizes (obviously) Patton’s military career, and the low organ melody in the theme symbolizes Patton’s deep religious beliefs. You can clearly hear all these elements in this MP3 of the theme. (MP3 from this page.)\n\nHe put so much into the film music (as do most film composers) and the ironic thing is that for a lot of people, the musical score in a film is “transparent” and they don’t really notice it on a conscious level. We should feel fortunate that we do notice it. It’s quite a treat."
