        "text": "Jerry Goldsmith, the influential Oscar-winning composer whose eclectic output encompassed the scores for Star Trek, Chinatown and Basic Instinct, has died at his Beverly Hills home after a long battle against cancer. He was 75.\n\nGoldsmith inspired numerous devotees in a career that spanned six decades and earned 17 Academy Award nominations, eventually winning the Oscar in 1977 for his score to Richard Donner's apocalyptic horror picture The Omen.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles on February 10 1929, Goldsmith attended the University of Southern California and honed his technique under the tutelage of masters like Jakob Gimpel and Miklos Rozsa.\n\nAfter working in the music department at CBS television, he graduated to the big screen and achieved his breakthrough with the avant-garde score to Planet of the Apes in 1968.\n\nOther notable work included Patton, Papillon, Poltergeist, Hoosiers, LA Confidential and The Mummy.\n\nGoldsmith was working on two scores when he died; the Steve Martin comedy Picasso at the Lapin Agile, and drama The Game of Their Lives, which recounts the US football team's 1-0 win over England in the 1950 World Cup.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, five children, six grandchildren and one great-grandchild."
