        "text": "The Sand Pebbles was a 4 year project for Robert Wise. His association with the film began in 1962 while he was in London. At the time, he had been working with the Mirisch organization and he was sent galley proofs of the Richard McKenna novel. Mirisch decided not to carry out the project, but left the film rights with Wise.\n\nThe movie rights to the book were originally sold to United Artists for $300,000. The movie rights were later acquired by Twentieth Century-Fox when Robert Wise was given the go-ahead with the project by Darryl F. Zanuck in September 1962. The search for suitable filming locations, script and other problems would set the project back 3 years.\n\nThe role of Jake Holman was originally offered to Paul Newman, who declined.\n\nSteve McQueen was paid $650,000 to star in The Sand Pebbles.\n\nThe \"San Pablo\" was constructed in Hong Kong for $250,000 (making it the costliest prop ever built for a motion picture at the time). Wise estimated that it would have cost $1 million to construct the ship in the U.S.\n\nPrincipal filming on The Sand Pebbles began November 22, 1965 and completed in May 1966. Wise led a Hollywood cast and crew numbering more than one hundred to Keelung, Tam Sui and Taipei on the island of Taiwan, for initial photography. An additional location in Hong Kong followed with two months of production at the 20th Century-Fox studio in Beverly Hills, California. In August 1966, additional scenes were shot aboard the USS Texas near Houston (see #14). Due to many unforeseen problems, the film ran $3 million dollars over budget. In spite of this, Director Robert Wise delivered the final movie (scheduled for a Christmas release) on time. The film went on to gross $27 million.\n\nThe film company endured an earthquake, several storms and a hotel fire. In addition they were \"interested and disturbed bystanders\" during a 3 day riot. The crew worked under close scrutiny and security because of the military conflict between Formosa (Taiwan) and Mainland China.\n\nThe Sand Pebbles was one of Twentieth Century-Fox's first Panavision films. This signaled the end of an era as Fox transitioned over from using their CinemaScope lens. For a brief history on this period...visit The American Widescreen Museum.\n\nThe role of Jake Holman won Steve McQueen his first and only Oscar nomination for Best Actor.\n\nCandice Bergen was 19 years old when shooting on The Sand Pebbles began.\n\nUpon completion of The Sand Pebbles, the San Pablo was temporarily saved from the scrap heap by an American construction firm which had a contract to rebuild bridges in Viet Nam. The San Pablo eventually changed ownership once again, relocated to Indonesia and renamed the \"Nola D\". Her fate is detailed in \"The Demise of the San Pablo\".\n\nThe engine and engine-room set used in the movie were actually located on a Twentieth Century Fox studio lot (Stage 14) in Burbank and not on the San Pablo. The original engine is currently on display aboard the SS Lane Victory, Pier 94, San Pedro, CA.\n\nThe China Light scenes were filmed at the 'Fox Ranch' (now the Malibu Creek State Park). Although the building survived for a while and was used for various storage, it has since been demolished. Photo taken at the Malibu Creek State Park visitor's center.\n\nThe original opening scene was to have been an establishing shot of a 1925 battleship in the Shanghai harbor. Jake Holman is seen packing his sea bag, has some dialogue, salutes the OOD (Officer of the Deck) and leaves the ship. (The battleship is seen very briefly in the movie trailer). This scene was actually shot near Houston, Texas aboard the USS Texas (August 4, 1966) but was cut from the movie the day before its New York City premiere.

Battle filming, first unit, lasted a month in Sai Kung waters. First unit work completed May 15, 1966.\n\nIn November 1966, Robert Wise screened a \"preview\" version of The Sand Pebbles for audiences in three cities, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Dallas. The preview version was 3 hours and 20 minutes (200 minutes) long.\n\nTo promote the film in New York City Twentieth Century Fox set up a publicity tour for Steve McQueen. McQueen made rare TV appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show (12/18/1966), What's My Line? (12/18/1966) and The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson (12/19/1966).\n\nThe movie premiered on December 20, 1966 at the Rivoli in New York City. Photo of Wise and McQueen at the NYC premiere.\n\nPhoto of ticket sold for the World Premiere of The Sand Pebbles at Rivoli Theater.\n\nThe West Coast premiere occurred on December 28, 1966 at the Fox Wilshire in Hollywood.\n\nThe original road-show running time was approximately 195 minutes. Fox began cutting the length of the film soon after its premiere without notifying Robert Wise. The \"theatrical\" version of the film has a running time of 182 minutes.\n\nComposer Alex North was originally slated to do the music for The Sand Pebbles. He was replaced by Jerry Goldsmith who would receive an Academy Award nomination (Best Music, Original Music Score) for The Sand Pebbles.\n\nThe theme from The Sand Pebbles (\"And We Were Lovers\") was recorded by over 24 different artists in the 1960's.
