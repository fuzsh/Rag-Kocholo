He shared his favorites in a collection called The Timeless Melodies of David Raksin.\n\nOriginally published by Ekay Music in 1996, this extraordinary 112-page, 9\" x 12\" collection of sheet music has long been out of print and hard to find.\n\nA number of years ago, Raksin donated a few copies of this songbook to The Film Music Society for fundraising, and we are happy to offer them for purchase while the supply lasts.\n\n...Continued >>> FROM FMS RESTORATIONS......\n\nRózsa's Jungle Book Available in Short Supply!\n\nFMS releases rare score in celebration of the composer's centenary In celebration of Miklós Rózsa's centennial year, The Film Music Society is proud to re-release Rózsa's historic score for the 1942 classic motion picture, Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book. Nearly two years ago, this popular CD was sold out of its Limited Edition release, and the FMS archived the manufacturer's overage. Due to popular demand by members and nonmembers alike, we decided to celebrate Rozsa's centenary by making our surplus copies available for purchase.\n\nRózsa's music shines on this CD in a way it never has before. Featuring lengthy and authoritative liner notes by Golden Age film expert Rudy Behlmer, this is an album you won't want to miss, skillfully restored and remastered from the last surviving transcription discs. As a bonus track, we've included an excerpt of a rare interview with Rózsa discussing his score with Behlmer in 1974.\n\n...Continued >>> FMS FEATURE...\n\nConversation Piece: An Unvarnished Chat with Bernard Herrmann\n\nFMS restores recording of never-before-released 1970 interview Film music preservation is not just about saving music manuscripts and recordings. It's also about saving the artform's history through writings, photographs and, in rare opportunites, the spoken word.\n\nThe Film Music Society is pleased to present its newest CD release, Conversation Piece: An Unvarnished Chat With Bernard Herrmann.\n\nOn September 26, 1970, Leslie Zador (the son of orchestrator Eugene Zador) and Gregory Rose from classical radio station KFAC interviewed Herrmann in his North Hollywood home on behalf of the Los Angeles Free Press. The interview was transcribed and an article appeared in the Free Press about a month later. Soon after, the sole recording of the interview was stowed away for more than 35 years.\n\nExcerpts of the original transcript were published in the Society's anthology Film Music 1 (1989). The audio tape was recently retrieved and generously donated by Zador to the FMS for historic preservation. Now, with permission from the interviewers and Herrmann's wife Norma Shepherd, this newly restored recording of one of Hollywood's most revered composers will soon be available on CD in its entirety (with the exception of a few imprudent remarks).\n\n...Continued >>> RESTORATION CD SERIES...\n\nThe World War II Documentary Music of Dimitri Tiomkin now available!\n\nTracks Include:\n\nClick select links to hear sample audio tracks.\n\nTUNISIAN VICTORY (1944)\n\n1. 1M1/1M2 2:29\n\n2. 1M3 :51\n\n3. 1M5 2:30\n\n4. 1M8 (outtake) 1:05\n\n5. 3M1 (outtake) 1:02\n\n6. 3M3/3M4 1:34\n\n7. 3M7 (partial outtake) 1:45\n\n8. 8M5 (partial outtake) 2:45\n\nSAN PIETRO (1945)\n\n9.

The tapes remained in the possession of Tiomkin's wife Olivia until earlier this year when they were transferred to digital format for restoration and inclusion on this CD.\n\nAccompanying these recordings is a deluxe 16-page booklet containing never-before-seen photographs and authoritative liner notes by Tiomkin expert Warren Sherk.\n\nThe World War II Documentary Music of Dimitri Tiomkin is a Limited Edition, with only 1,000 copies manufactured. It is available to the public for $20 plus s/h. If you would like to order your copy, please contact us or visit the Merchandise page for more information. But hurry! Stock is running low. The FMS quarterly journal, The Cue Sheet, Vol. 20, No. 4 (October 2005), features an extended version of Warren Sherk's informative liner notes for this important restoration. The issue is available for $7.50 plus s/h, or $6 if purchased with the CD.\n\nPrint this article\n\nFROM FMS RESTORATIONS...\n\nConversation Piece: An Unvarnished Chat with Bernard Herrmann CD\n\nThe World War II Documentary Music of Dimitri Tiomkin CD\n\nRudyard Kipling's Jungle Book soundtrack CD\n\nSPFM Takemitsu Tribute CD – SOLD OUT\n\nSPFM Goldsmith Tribute CD\n\nMusic from CBS Westerns CD\n\nFROM FMS PUBLICATIONS...\n\nFILM MUSIC 1\n\nFILM MUSIC 2\n\nElmer Bernstein's Film Music Notebook\n\nTHE FILM MUSIC SOCIETY NEWSLETTER...\n\nBookmark this page.\n\nThe periodic newsletter, previously sent by US mail exclusively to FMS members, is now right here on the News & Events page of this website.
