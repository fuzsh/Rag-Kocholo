I'm Dave Davies, senior writer for the Philadelphia Daily\n\nNews, sitting in for Terry Gross.\n\nThe trained assassin Jason Bourne has returned to the screen in \"The Bourne\n\nSupremacy,\" based on the spy novel by Robert Ludlum. It's the sequel to the\n\n2002 espionage thriller \"The Bourne Identity.\" Bourne is played by Matt\n\nDamon, one of the most popular actors of his generation. He's starred in such\n\nfilms as \"Saving Private Ryan,\" \"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\" and \"Good Will\n\nHunting,\" for which he also won an Oscar for the screenplay he wrote with his\n\nlongtime friend, Ben Affleck.\n\nTerry Gross spoke with Matt Damon in 2002 when the first Bourne film was in\n\ntheaters. In that film Jason Bourne is adrift in the Mediterranean Sea where\n\nhe's rescued by fishermen. He has amnesia and has no recollection of what\n\nhappened to him or who he is. The only clues are a couple of bullets in his\n\nback and a Swiss bank account number surgically implanted in his hip.\n\nHe goes to the Swiss bank and finds the safe deposit box, which contains lots\n\nof cash, a gun and several passports with his photo but different names. In\n\nthis scene he's talking to a woman, played by Franka Potente, who's helping\n\nhim find his way.\n\n(Soundbite of \"The Bourne Identity\")\n\nMr. MATT DAMON: (As Jason Bourne) Who has a safety deposit box full of money\n\nand six passports and a gun? Who has a bank account number in their hip? I\n\ncome in here, and the first thing I'm doing is I'm catching the sight lines\n\nand looking for an exit.\n\nMs. FRANKA POTENTE (As Marie St. Jacques) I see the exit sign, too. I'm not\n\nworried. I mean, you were shot. People do all kinds of weird and amazing\n\nstuff when they're scared.\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Bourne) I can tell you the license plate numbers of all six\n\ncars outside. I can tell you that our waitress is left-handed and the guy\n\nsitting up at the counter weighs 215 pounds and knows how to handle himself.\n\nI know the best place to look for a gun is the cab of the gray truck outside.\n\nAnd at this altitude, I can run flat-out for a half-mile before my hands start\n\nshaking. Now why would I know that?\n\nDAVIES: Damon trained in boxing and martial arts in preparation for his role\n\nas the buff and agile killer. But for an earlier role, he took a different\n\napproach.\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nYou know, I read that for \"Courage Under Fire,\" when you had to lose weight,\n\nyou not only starved yourself, but you used laxatives. Now that can't be very\n\nhealthy.\n\nMr. DAMON: Actually, laxatives I used after I started eating again, because\n\nI did it unsupervised, and so all I was doing was I would run 13 miles every\n\nday and I would eat chicken and egg whites and vegetables and one to two baked\n\npotatoes every day for my carbohydrates. But I would run six and a half miles\n\nin the morning and then six and a half at night. And by the end of it, when\n\nmy body really started kind of eating itself, like eventually your muscle\n\njust--you're consuming muscle at the end. There's no fat left, really, to\n\nconsume. And I was just so tired, I just remember I would wake up in the\n\nmorning, I would sit up in my bed--we were in Austin, Texas, shooting--and I\n\nwould immediately fall back over because I would get faint. So that was how I\n\nwas working out at the end.\n\nI mean, it was stupid and it was unsupervised. And, you know, look, I mean, I\n\nwas low down on the totem pole. The studio wasn't going to spend, you know,\n\n1,500 bucks for me to have a trainer. I mean, but I also knew that it was a\n\nchance for me to get more work if I played the role, if I was honest and true\n\nin the role, then somebody would take notice, anybody, you know.\n\nGROSS: Did Robert De Niro create this thing, where like after \"Raging Bull,\"\n\nyou had to put on weight or take off weight or physically change in some\n\namazing way?\n\nMr. DAMON: Yeah. I'm sure he--I mean, I grew up, you know, with that, seeing\n\n\"Raging Bull\" and loving that performance in that movie. And, you know, I was\n\n25 when I did \"Courage Under Fire,\" and it was, you know, the young man's kind\n\nof swagger in saying, `Look, you know, this is what I'm willing to do.'\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMr. DAMON: `This is what I'll put my body through. This is what'--because\n\nthe people that you really, you know, idolize did it, too. And it's also this\n\nkind of weird--you know, living out in Los Angeles and not being able to get\n\nacting work, you know, it's a weird way of saying, you know, `No matter what\n\nhappens, nobody's ever going to tell me that there's anybody out here with\n\nmore discipline or who will give up more, you know, will sacrifice more for\n\ntheir job than me.' And I don't know, we kind of cling to it...\n\nGROSS: So what'd you get for it?\n\nMr. DAMON: What's that?\n\nGROSS: What'd you get for it, for all the sacrifice?\n\nMr. DAMON: Sick. I got sick. And, you know, eventually when I went back to\n\nBoston, yeah, the doctor put me on two different kinds of medication, and he\n\nsaid I'd really done some bad things to my body. He checked me out and the\n\nfirst thing he said was, `The only good thing I can tell you is that your\n\nheart didn't shrink.'\n\nGROSS: Jeez.\n\nMr. DAMON: And then he told me I could never do it again.\n\nGROSS: That's an option? Whoa.\n\nMr. DAMON: Yeah. Well, your heart's a muscle, so if I'd kept up with it, you\n\nknow, obviously that's--I mean, that's what happens to people with anorexia\n\nand, you know, eventually their bodies just shut down. But, you know, my big\n\nmaster plan of having people take notice, the movie came out, and I was on\n\nthis medication, and the reviews for \"Courage Under Fire\" came out, and none\n\nof them mentioned me at all. And that was when I just said, `You know what?\n\nThis is ridiculous, you know,' but it was heartbreaking for me. It was really\n\nheartbreaking.\n\nGROSS: Now you met Ben Affleck when you were about 10. Did he want to act,\n\ntoo? I mean, was the desire to act part of the basis of your friendship?\n\nMr. DAMON: Definitely. Well, he was acting. He was known in Cambridge as\n\nthe professional actor, because he was on this PBS series called \"The Voyage\n\nof the Mimi,\" which was an educational TV show...\n\nGROSS: Right. I know that.\n\nMr. DAMON: ...that was on PBS, and they used it as a tool in schools. We\n\nlived two blocks from each other, but we really became friends in high school,\n\nwhen he got to high school. So I was 15 or 16 when he got there, and he was\n\n14. And then we fashioned--yeah--a very, very deep bond, and a lot of it was\n\nbased on what we both wanted to do. I mean, it's a weird thing looking back,\n\nin going and meeting 16-year-olds or meeting 14-year-olds. He and I were\n\nflying to New York together at that age. We--because my parents didn't\n\nsupport the idea that I would do this professionally at that age. They didn't\n\nsay that I couldn't do it. They never did things like that, but they said\n\nthey wouldn't pay for me to go to New York to audition for things. And so I\n\ndid a local commercial in Boston. Ben and I went and got cast in a local\n\ncommercial in Boston.\n\nGROSS: Wait, I'm going to interject. I think it was a TJ Maxx commercial.\n\nMr. DAMON: Yeah, it was. It was.\n\nGROSS: You get the max for the minimum at TJ Maxx.\n\nMr. DAMON: The max for the minimum at TJ Maxx. And we got cut out of the\n\ncommercial, but we still got paid.\n\nGROSS: Did you have to sing or try on coats or what?\n\nMr. DAMON: No. I forget. I think we were sitting at a cafeteria table, and\n\na pretty girl walked by and we had to look at her and then look at each other\n\nlike, `Isn't it great to be back in school?' or something like that. It was\n\nlike a back-to-school ad.\n\nGROSS: Oh.\n\nMr. DAMON: But we opened up a bank account and put the money in, and we\n\ncalled it like, you know, our business bank account. But the money was for\n\ntrips to New York, you know, on the old Pan Am shuttle or on the train.\n\nGROSS: You ended up going to Harvard.\n\nMr. DAMON: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: You grew up in Cambridge. That wasn't far to go.\n\nMr. DAMON: Right.\n\nGROSS: Far to go intellectually, but not geographically.\n\nMr. DAMON: Right.\n\nGROSS: And then you left, I think, during or before your senior year...\n\nMr. DAMON: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...to work.\n\nMr. DAMON: Yeah. I left a few times. I left in the second semester of my\n\nsophomore year to do a TNT movie, and then I came back and then left to do\n\n\"School Ties\" and then came back again and then left to do a movie called\n\n\"Geronimo.\" \"Geronimo\"...\n\nGROSS: I'm one of the few people who saw that.\n\nMr. DAMON: Oh, you're the one. Yeah. Which was a great experience. And...\n\nGROSS: A Walter Hill film.\n\nMr. DAMON: Walter Hill, yeah, yeah.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMr. DAMON: And that was a great experience. I mean, I got to work with\n\nDuvall and, you know, Gene Hackman. I didn't really get to work with Gene\n\nHackman, but, you know, I shook his hand, and he said, `What's your name?' and\n\nI said, `Matt Damon,' and he said, `Mark, great to meet you.'\n\nDAVIES: Matt Damon speaking with Terry Gross. He plays the trained assassin\n\nJason Bourne in the new film \"The Bourne Supremacy.\" We'll continue after\n\nthis break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nDAVIES: Let's get back to Terry's interview with Matt Damon. In 1998 Damon\n\nand his long-time friend Ben Affleck won an Oscar for their screenplay for\n\n\"Good Will Hunting.\" Damon was nominated for an Oscar for his performance in\n\nthe film as Will, a young man from South Boston who works as a janitor at\n\nHarvard but is able to solve seemingly unsolvable math problems left on a\n\nblackboard. Will grew up in foster homes and has a rap sheet. When he's\n\njailed for instigating a fight, a professor who sees Will's genius bails him\n\nout on the condition that he get some counseling. Will's psychologist is\n\nplayed by Robin Williams. In this scene, Will is in the psychologist's office\n\nwhen a painting catches his eye, a painting made by the psychologist.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Good Will Hunting\")\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Will Hunting) The linear and impressionistic mix makes a very\n\nmuddled composition. It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off except you got\n\nWhitey(ph) rowing a boat there.\n\nMr. ROBIN WILLIAMS: (As Sean Maguire) ...(Unintelligible) wasn't very good.\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Hunting) That's not really what concerns me, though.\n\nMr. WILLIAMS: (As Maguire) What concerns you?\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Hunting) It's the coloring.\n\nMr. WILLIAMS: (As Maguire) You know what the real bitch of it is? It's paint\n\nby number.\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Hunting) Is it color by number?--because the colors are\n\nfascinating to me.\n\nMr. WILLIAMS: (As Maguire) Are they really? What about that?\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Hunting) I think you're about one step away from cutting your\n\n(censored) ear off.\n\nMr. WILLIAMS: (As Maguire) Really?\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Hunting) Oh, yeah.\n\nMr. WILLIAMS: (As Maguire) Think I should move to the South of France, change\n\nmy name to Vincent?\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Hunting) You ever heard the saying, `Any port in a storm'?\n\nMr. WILLIAMS: (As Maguire) Yeah.\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Hunting) Yeah, maybe that means you.\n\nMr. WILLIAMS: (As Maguire) In what way?\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Hunting) Maybe you're in the middle of a storm, a big\n\n(censored) storm.\n\nMr. WILLIAMS: (As Maguire) Yeah, maybe.\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Hunting) The sky's falling on your head, the waves are\n\ncrashing over your little boat, the oars are about to snap. You're just\n\npissing your pants, you're crying for the harbor. So maybe you do what you've\n\ngot to do to get out. You know, maybe you became a psychologist.\n\nMr. WILLIAMS: (As Maguire) Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now. You\n\nstill have a minute. Come on.\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Hunting) Maybe you married the wrong woman.\n\nMr. WILLIAMS: (As Maguire) Maybe you should watch your mouth. Why don't you\n\nwrite that, Chief, all right?\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Hunting) That's it, isn't it? You married the wrong woman.\n\nWhat happened? What, did she leave you or did she, you know, (whistles) bang\n\nsome other guy?\n\nMr. WILLIAMS: (As Maguire) If you ever disrespect my wife again, I will end\n\nyou. I will (censored) end you.\n\nGROSS: Let's get to \"Good Will Hunting.\" The movie, I think, is based on a\n\nplay that you wrote when you were still a student at Harvard. What was the\n\noriginal play like?\n\nMr. DAMON: I wrote it--actually, it was a play writing course that this guy,\n\nAnthony Kubiak, taught at Harvard, which is a terrific course, and I wrote it\n\nas a screenplay, you know, in screenplay format. And the original one was 41\n\npages long and, you know, it just had the beginnings of a story. And it\n\nhad--what survived of it was--the one scene that survived from that was the\n\nfirst time that I meet Robin Williams' character in that movie when he\n\neventually grabs me by the neck and throws me up against the wall because I\n\nsay something about his wife. And that scene was verbatim as I wrote in\n\nAnthony Kubiak's class. But nothing else survived.\n\nBut the teacher encouraged me when I finished the class, he gave me an A, and\n\nit was, you know, one of the first times I got an A at Harvard. And I didn't\n\ncare what I got in the class. I had had such a good time in the class. And\n\nhe gave me an A, and next to it, he wrote on the paper, he wrote, you know,\n\n`You should really keep going with this. This really seems like it could be\n\nleading somewhere,' and encouraged me to do it. And so a few months later,\n\nfor spring break I went to Los Angeles to audition, actually, for \"Geronimo:\n\nAn American Legend,\" and stayed with Ben, and brought the, you know,\n\nwork-in-progress thing with me and showed him. And he loved it, and he said,\n\n`This is great. You know, let's--you know, we should do something with this.'\n\nAnd so we agreed, you know. Neither of us knew which way to go with it,\n\nthough, so a little later on I did \"Geronimo\" and then moved in--Ben and I got\n\na place in LA with Casey, his brother.\n\nAnd we were there for like a year before--you know, and this thing was just\n\nsitting on the shelf because neither of us could think of what to do. And\n\nthen one night we were literally sitting around talking. It was probably 1 in\n\nthe morning. And it just started--I think Ben was the first one. He started\n\nsaying something, and the way that things normally work with us is one person\n\nsays a little thing, the next person, and it just starts to rapidly--which is\n\nwhy, you know, we're utterly useless without each other. At least we have\n\nbeen so far. But it happened really in a--it kind of tumbled out and the\n\nscript came really, really quickly.\n\nGROSS: I want to ask you about \"The Talented Mr. Ripley.\" You were really\n\njust terrific in that film, and you were playing somebody who doesn't have any\n\nof the things he wants: friends, a lover, interesting work, interesting life,\n\ntravel, money...\n\nMr. DAMON: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...none of that. And through a little bit of deception, or perhaps a\n\nlot of deception, he's able to kind of change his life and become part of\n\nthis, like, charmed circle of wealthy people...\n\nMr. DAMON: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...revolving particularly around this one couple played by Jude Law\n\nand...\n\nMr. DAMON: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...Gwyneth Paltrow. And the first time you meet them you're meeting\n\nthem--Is it in Italy?\n\nMr. DAMON: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: And you're on the Mediterranean on a beach, and they're all, like,\n\nbronzed and beautiful and you've just arrived from...\n\nMr. DAMON: New York City.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. And you're pale and kind of scrawny. This is one of the...\n\nMr. DAMON: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...roles you lost weight for. And the first time you meet them you\n\nwere in your bathing suit and you just look so wrong.\n\nMr. DAMON: Right.\n\nGROSS: You look so out of place. And it sets the tone beautifully for\n\neverything that's to follow, this physically uncomfortable, out-of-the-place,\n\nwrong-looking person. Can you talk a little bit just about that scene even.\n\nMr. DAMON: Yeah. It was right for--it was just right. I mean, it was right\n\nthere in the script when I read it, and it made total sense. And we wanted,\n\nobviously, when Ripley starts to try to take over Dickie's identity for him to\n\ntry to look more and more like him, so the bigger gap you can leave at the\n\nbeginning, you know, the better that's going to come across. And also we just\n\nloved the awkwardness of it.\n\nYou know, the green bathing suit that I wore was, you know, maybe a little bit\n\nkind of over-the-top. There was a scene, though, that Anthony Minghella\n\nscripted just in case he felt we needed it, where they show me buying the\n\nbathing suit. I see him on the beach, and so I buy the bathing suit, and\n\nthat's the only one they have, which is how I ended up with that bathing suit,\n\njust in case it seemed too kind of goofy that I would have a lime green, you\n\nknow, bathing suit. But, you know, Anthony looked at the movie and didn't\n\nfeel like we needed it. And so, you know, there's Ripley kind of showing up\n\nas pale--I mean, they painted me alabaster for that. They...\n\nGROSS: Oh, really?\n\nMr. DAMON: Yeah. Oh, yeah.\n\nGROSS: You got painted pale.\n\nMr. DAMON: Yeah. And I already was pale. I had stayed out of the sun for,\n\nyou know, months and months, and I was as pale as I could be. But they, you\n\nknow, even put more kind of gook all over me.\n\nGROSS: What did you do internally to get into the character of somebody who\n\nwants so desperately to live this life that he has no access to, that he\n\nfinally ends up not only deceiving but killing for it?\n\nMr. DAMON: It's just that I can really relate. I really related to that\n\ncharacter in a lot of ways. I really related to that.\n\nGROSS: In what way?\n\nMr. DAMON: I don't know. I've had that feeling, you know, in my life of\n\nwanting to belong somewhere and not belonging and--especially kind of in, you\n\nknow, adolescence and in teen-age years. I mean, those are--you feel that\n\nwith such pain and, you know...\n\nGROSS: Yeah. But you already had an agent in New York...\n\nMr. DAMON: Yeah, right. That's right.\n\nGROSS: ...that you could brag about to your friends.\n\nMr. DAMON: Yeah. God. So, yeah, I mean, there was a lot to him, to that\n\ncharacter, that I just really related to and loved. And, yeah, I felt--I\n\nstill feel bad for that character. I got really mad the first time I saw the\n\nmovie, actually, with the final music.\n\nGROSS: Why?\n\nMr. DAMON: 'Cause there was a scene where I'm walking with Gwyneth and I have\n\na razor in my pocket, and the music that, you know, which is perfect for the\n\nmovie, it's right for the movie, but because Anthony was my kind of, you know,\n\npartner in crime the whole time we were shooting it, every time something--you\n\nknow, we would ask some--you know, we'd say, `Well, should Ripley'--I mean,\n\nI'd say, `So I'm going to kill Freddie with this statue?'\n\nAnd he'd go, `Of course you're going to kill Freddie. Freddie's coming and\n\nyou have--Freddie's accusing you of doing--how dare he? He has a lot of\n\nnerve.'\n\nYou know, he was very much my ally, you know, when we were shooting it because\n\nthat was what got me ready for every scene was the fact that what I'm doing\n\nmakes total sense.\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMr. DAMON: It's just--of course I'm going to do this, and this makes--you\n\nknow, so Anthony was a very good kind of sounding board for the Ripley\n\nrationale. But, of course, at the end of the day he's the director of the\n\nmovie, so when he goes to put the music over the scene where I'm walking\n\ntowards Gwyneth with a razor blade, he's not defending Ripley. He's got this\n\nkind of Hitchcockian music over it. And so when I saw it I was like, you\n\nknow, how--you know.\n\nGROSS: He told me I was justified.\n\nMr. DAMON: Yeah, exactly. How dare you? You're supposed to be my friend.\n\nGROSS: What was it like for you when you first became--when you first started\n\nacting in movies with big stars in it and then you became a big star yourself,\n\nand suddenly all the people who you admired when you were young, who seemed so\n\nout of reach, who lived either in the television box or on the big screen,\n\nwere colleagues of yours or friends of yours or people you had access to? Was\n\nit awkward at first to be in that circle, to be in that situation where people\n\nwho were always just these, like, movie figures were now actually\n\nthree-dimensional people and you were working with them or you were talking\n\nwith them?\n\nMr. DAMON: Yeah. Yeah. That was weird. I mean, the only time I really run\n\ninto other people, you know, that I've grown up watching or whatever is at,\n\nlike, a ceremony or, you know, an event or something.\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. DAMON: You know, I haven't really run into too many people, although I\n\nhave an assistant, and I guess, you know, two years ago for Christmas--I guess\n\nI have a habit of talking about Morgan Freeman a lot 'cause I really respect\n\nMorgan Freeman.\n\nGROSS: Oh, he's great. Yeah.\n\nMr. DAMON: So this is going to sound really silly, but for Christmas a couple\n\nof years ago she gave me, as a Christmas gift, dinner with Morgan Freeman.\n\nShe called Morgan Freeman's assistant and I guess he thought it was funny, and\n\nso they kind of agreed. And it was like a, you know, make-a-wish dinner or\n\nsomething where I, you know, was like, you know, Chris Farley on the old\n\n\"Chris Farley Show\" on \"Saturday Night Live,\" like, `Remember that time in\n\nthat movie when you did that thing? That was awesome.' But for the most part\n\nthe most I get to know people is working with them.\n\nAnd I've been incredibly lucky, incredibly lucky to, you know--starting with,\n\nyou know, back with Duvall, and how good he was to me and how--and he didn't\n\nhave to do that. You know, the guy is a living legend, you know, and he\n\ntolerated my questions. And I did \"Courage Under Fire\" with Denzel\n\nWashington, and he was really nice to me. And, yeah, \"Rainmaker.\" And, God,\n\nDanny DeVito. Mickey Rourke was great to me. Mickey Rourke sat me down the\n\nfirst time I met him, kind of forcefully, and said, `Don't screw this up.\n\nDon't do what I did.'\n\nGROSS: Oh.\n\nMr. DAMON: `I was a jerk to people. I'--you know, he said, `Appreciate what\n\nyou have and be polite to everybody you meet and don't ever screw this up.'\n\nIt was pretty, you know, affecting, you know,\n\nGROSS: Matt Damon, thank you so much.\n\nMr. DAMON: All right. Thanks for having me.\n\nDAVIES: Matt Damon speaking with Terry Gross in 2002. He stars as the\n\ntrained assassin Jason Bourne in the new film \"The Bourne Supremacy\" based on\n\nthe thriller by Robert Ludlum.

I'm Dave Davies.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Chinatown\")\n\nUnidentified Man #1: Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.\n\n(Soundbite of footsteps; music from \"Chinatown\")\n\nDAVIES: The tragedy and the romance which filled the screen in \"Chinatown\"\n\nwouldn't have been the same without the lush dark score by Jerry Goldsmith.\n\n(Soundbite of music from \"Chinatown\")\n\nUnidentified Man #2: All right, come on! Clear the area! On the sidewalk!\n\nOn the sidewalk!\n\n(Soundbite of sirens)\n\nUnidentified Man #2: Get off the streets! Get off the streets!\n\n(Soundbite of music from \"Chinatown\")\n\nDAVIES: Composer Jerry Goldsmith died on Wednesday at his home in Beverly\n\nHills. He was 75. Goldsmith was one of the most prolific composers for film\n\nand television. His film scores included \"Chinatown,\" \"Patton,\" \"Star Trek,\"\n\n\"Alien,\" \"The Sand Pebbles,\" \"A Patch of Blue,\" the original \"Planet of the\n\nApes\" and \"LA Confidential.\" He also wrote the TV themes for \"The Man from\n\nU.N.C.L.E.,\" \"Dr. Kildare,\" \"The Waltons\" and \"Barnaby Jones.\" His 1976 score\n\nfor \"The Omen\" won an Oscar. He received another 17 Academy Award nominations\n\nand five Emmy Awards.\n\nTerry spoke with Jerry Goldsmith in 2002. They opened with his score from\n\n\"Patton,\" the World War II movie starring George C. Scott as General George\n\nPatton.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Patton\" theme)\n\nMr. JERRY GOLDSMITH (Composer): People talk about \"Patton\" as a war film. I\n\nnever viewed it as a war film. I viewed it as a personal documentary or a\n\nbiography of a man who was a warrior, yes, but there are two other aspects of\n\nhim, which I did capture in the music. He was a very religious man, in spite\n\nof his profane personality, and he was also a total intellectual and a deep\n\nbeliever of reincarnation and history, and he spoke fluent French, he was\n\ncultured musically; I mean, the dichotomy of the man and, you know, how\n\nprofane he was, but yet there was this depth, though.\n\nSo he was a complex personality, and I tried capturing these three levels of\n\nhis personality in music by the fanfare, which has become sort of well-known,\n\nis meant to represent the archaic part of him, the historical, the\n\nintellectual part of him; the chorale was to represent the religious aspect of\n\nhim and, of course, the military aspect of him. It was designed\n\ncontrapuntally so that all three could be played simultaneously or\n\nindividually or two at a time, whatever.\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nNow you've written the themes for several TV shows--\"Dr. Kildare,\" \"The Man\n\nfrom U.N.C.L.E.\" Both of those are on your new CD.\n\nMr. GOLDSMITH: Mm. And \"The Waltons.\"\n\nGROSS: \"The Waltons.\" Why don't we hear the theme that you wrote for \"The\n\nMan from U.N.C.L.E.\"?\n\nMr. GOLDSMITH: OK.\n\nGROSS: Anything you want to say about it?\n\nMr. GOLDSMITH: I guess during the late '50s and '60s, we all had to be\n\nversatile, so we had to have jazz influence in our music, and so that was what\n\nI sort of tried to do. But to make it more interesting, I originally wrote it\n\nin five-four, which, except for Dave Brubeck, was not really a meter that was\n\nparticularly common in jazz.\n\nAnd an interesting side note of this whole thing was after the first season,\n\nthey wanted to save money, and I had written it for a larger group. It was 20\n\nplayers, and they wanted to cut it down to a little like four or five piece,\n\nbecause they had to pay each year to re-record the theme, so they wanted to\n\nsave money. So I was unavailable, so they hired Lalo Schifrin and Lalo did a\n\nvery hip arrangement of it for a small group, and that's really what they used\n\nfor the years--however long the show was on the air was Lalo's arrangement of\n\nthe theme.\n\n(Soundbite of \"The Man from \"U.N.C.L.E.\" theme)\n\nGROSS: Now I want to talk about another theme that you wrote, and that's the\n\ntheme for \"Chinatown,\" which I think is really just one of the great scores.\n\nLet's talk about the opening theme. Is there a specific part of the movie or\n\na specific emotion within the movie that you wanted that opening theme to\n\nevoke or address?\n\nMr. GOLDSMITH: The story was that the picture had been scored by someone\n\nelse before and they previewed it, and actually the previews in the picture\n\nwere evidently--from what I was told, were not very successful, and the music\n\nwas not very good either. I mean, I must say that when I did see the picture,\n\nI had heard a little of the music and it was Chinese, so it seemed rather\n\ninappropriate for the film.\n\nSo anyway, I was called in to do it, and I had to do the score in 10 days,\n\nwhich is a very short period of time to do it. And the producer, Robert\n\nEvans, had said to me, `We should have a period feel in the music,' period\n\nfeel being the style of the '30s. And I said, `Well, you've got that in this\n\nBunny Berigan recording you're using as--you know, it was coming off the radio\n\nand all that.' And you see that in the cinematography, in the costumes, the\n\nwardrobe and--the whole feel, look of the picture was '30s Los Angeles, and I\n\ngrew up--I was here as a young kid in the '30s. I know what it looked like\n\nand felt like, and that was the amazing thing about this picture was that that\n\nfeel was so true. I said, `So musically, I want to try and go for the tragedy\n\nof the story.'\n\nI finished recording it, and the movie came out like three days later, so we\n\nwere really right down to the wire on it. So I didn't have a lot of time to\n\nthink. I just had to sit down and write a theme for this movie and get on\n\nwith it.\n\nDAVIES: Film composer Jerry Goldsmith died on Wednesday at the age of 75.\n\nOur conversation with him was recorded in 2002.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nDAVIES: Coming up we remember another great musical figure, saxophonist\n\nIllinois Jacquet who died yesterday.\n\nThis is FRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nFiller: By policy of WHYY, this information is restricted and has\n\nbeen omitted from this transcript\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nReview: Matt Damon's new movie \"The Bourne Supremacy\"\n\nDAVE DAVIES, host:\n\n\"The Bourne Supremacy\" is the second in a series of thrillers by Robert Ludlum\n\nfeaturing the amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne. The first in the series,\n\n\"The Bourne Identity,\" was turned into a 2002 hit movie starring Matt Damon.\n\nDamon is back for the sequel, which also features Joan Allen and Brian Cox.\n\nFilm critic David Edelstein has a review.\n\nDAVID EDELSTEIN reporting:\n\nSix months after 9/11, it was weirdly comforting to see \"The Bourne Identity.\"\n\nIt was based on a 22-year-old novel by Robert Ludlum, and it took us back to a\n\nCold War era, when the only people who ever seemed to die were spies and\n\ncounterspies and the occasional overweening party apparatchik. Matt Damon\n\nplayed a guy found floating off the coast of Marseilles with two bullets in\n\nhis back and the number of a Zurich safe deposit box in some sort of laser\n\nbody implant. He had no idea who he was, but he had somehow retained his\n\nlightning martial arts reflexes, his fluency in a handful of languages and the\n\ninstincts of a superspy assassin. It was pretty silly stuff, but the film,\n\ndirected by Doug Liman, was fast, adroit, and like its hero, wonderfully\n\nself-contained.\n\nThe sequel, \"The Bourne Supremacy,\" is better--not better as a story; that's,\n\nif anything, even sillier--better as a piece of grab you by the collar and\n\nfling you all over the place filmmaking. If you'll pardon my French, it's a\n\ntour de force. The English director, Paul Greengrass, made the amazing 2002\n\nmovie \"Bloody Sunday.\" I almost said `the amazing documentary,' because that\n\nfilm, about the Irish civil rights march of 1972 that ended in a massacre was\n\nstaged and shot like combat photography. You weren't watching a re-creation;\n\nyou were right there in the middle of the melee.\n\nAnd Greengrass brings the same verite technique to the patently fictional\n\n\"Bourne Supremacy.\" He puts you in the street with Jason Bourne, scanning a\n\ncrowd that streaks by so fast that your eyes don't quite focus. You only\n\nhalf-catch the guy with the rifle taking aim before the bullet explodes and\n\nthe world is upended. The movie has hand-to-hand fight scenes so close and\n\nblurry and tumultuous that they summon up your fight-or-flight instincts.\n\nIt's like the filmmaker is thinking on his feet with his hero, moving fast so\n\nhe won't miss something, and making you keep up or else. You don't even want\n\nto look down at your popcorn.\n\nBetter yet, you don't have time to think too much about the plot. When the\n\nfilm begins, Bourne is in India, still in hiding, still with Marie, the love\n\nof his life, played by Franka Potente, still trying to piece together his\n\nmemories, especially the memory of a mission, maybe in Berlin, with two people\n\ndead. Why does it gnaw at him? Maybe for the same reason someone has framed\n\nhim for the murder of a couple of spies and is now trying to shoot him. After\n\nhe takes an agonizing leave of Marie, Bourne heads for Berlin, where CIA agent\n\nPamela Landy, played by Joan Allen, leads a team in pursuit. A step ahead by\n\nreflex, Bourne manages to corner Julia Stiles as a minor and surprisingly\n\nunsympathetic functionary. You have to picture Damon and Stiles weaving in\n\nand out of crowds, and agents with headphones, and the editing electric and\n\nthe camera swerving all over the place.\n\n(Soundbite of \"The Bourne Supremacy\")\n\nMr. MATT DAMON: (As Jason Bourne) What were my words? What did I say?\n\n(Unintelligible).\n\nMs. JULIA STILES: (As Nicolette) I did. I swear, Jason, I told them that I\n\nbelieved you.\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Bourne) I'm going to ask you some simple questions.\n\nUnidentified Man #1: ...(Unintelligible) give me something. I need\n\nsomething.\n\nUnidentified Man #2: They're on it, they're on it!\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Bourne) Who's Pamela Landy?\n\nMs. STILES: (As Nicolette) She's a task force chief.\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Bourne) Is she running Treadstone?\n\nMs. STILES: (As Nicolette) No, she's the deputy director.\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Bourne) Why is she trying to kill me?\n\nMs. STILES: (As Nicolette) Last week an agency field officer tried to make a\n\nbuy off of one of her ops. He was trying to sell out a mole or something.\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Bourne) And?\n\nMs. STILES: (As Nicolette) And you got to him before we did.\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Bourne) I killed him.\n\nMs. STILES: (As Nicolette) You left a print. There were partial prints that\n\ntraced back to Treadstone. They know it was you.\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Bourne) That's insane.\n\nMs. STILES: (As Nicolette) Why are you doing this? Why come back now?\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Bourne) Just stop.\n\nMs. STILES: (As Nicolette) Landy is on...\n\nMr. DAMON: (As Bourne) Just stop. Last week, I was 4,000 miles away in\n\nIndia. They came for me. This ends now.\n\nEDELSTEIN: \"The Bourne Supremacy\" improves on its predecessor by telling two\n\nstories. It's not just Bourne running away from police and assassins and\n\npeople in headquarters screaming, `Get Bourne!' although there is a lot of\n\nthat, come to think of it. There's also Joan Allen's Landy, trying to figure\n\nout why so many of her higher-ups want to kill Bourne before he can talk to\n\nanyone. Poor Bourne doesn't know what's going on, and Damon manages to play\n\nbefuddlement without the slightest loss of virility. Impassive as he is, you\n\ncan always see the wheels turning in his head. He turns the gap between his\n\nplodding demeanor and those automatic quicksilver reflexes into something\n\nwitty and moving, even existential.\n\nBut in the end, the movie is a testament to the director's virtuosity and to\n\nhow video and documentary techniques can transform even the most familiar\n\nmaterial into something with astonishing immediacy. Freed from the\n\nold-fashioned studio gloss, \"The Bourne Supremacy\" makes the Cold War thriller\n\nseem born again.\n\nDAVIES: David Edelstein is film critic for the online magazine Slate.\n\n(Credits)"
