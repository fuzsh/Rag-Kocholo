        "text": "Happy Birthday to Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven who turns 86 years young today! üéâ Paul Verhoeven graduated from the University of Leiden, with a degree in math and physics. He entered the Royal Netherlands Navy, where he began his film career by making documentaries for the Navy and later for TV. üì∫ In 1969, he directed the popular Dutch TV series, Floris (1969), about a medieval knight. This featured actor Rutger Hauer, who has appeared in many of Verhoeven's later films. Verhoeven's first feature, Wat zien ik (1971) (trans. \"What do I See?\"), was released in 1971. However, it was his second, Turkish Delight (1973), with its combination of raw sexuality and a poignant story-line, that gained him great popularity in the Netherlands, especially with male audiences. When his films, especially Soldier of Orange (1977) and The 4th Man (1983), received international recognition, Verhoeven moved to the US. üá∫üá∏ In 1985, Verhoeven made his first Hollywood film Flesh and Blood and later had a successful career in the United States, directing science fiction films such as RoboCop (1987), Total Recall (1990), Starship Troopers (1997) and Hollow Man (2000), as well as the erotic thriller Basic Instinct (1992). üî™ In honor of Mr. Verhoeven's birthday, I'm proud to share a performance I conducted of the Main Theme from Basic Instinct by Jerry Goldsmith, played by The People's Orchestra of Nashville! üéµ Basic Instinct is a 1992 neo-noir thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone. The film features a \"did she/or didn‚Äôt she\" plot. I chose this selection to be performed on our 2023 Spooky Symphony Concert because I believe composer Jerry Goldsmith did a masterful job of capturing that feeling of uneasiness and mystery with his music. üé∂ Goldsmith said he had a very difficult time composing the score as he found the story to be convoluted, but felt afterward that it was one of his best scores written because of the director‚Äôs pushing. The Main Theme features strings and woodwinds in an aural exchange, in a way mirroring the on-screen interplay between Douglas and Stone‚Äôs characters. Please enjoy Jerry Goldsmith‚Äôs Main Theme for Basic Instinct! Link to YouTube video of the performance: https://lnkd.in/exZHUWE4 Video of performance is embedded below! üé• I appreciate your ongoing support, thank you for liking/sharing/subscribing to our Facebook pages: The People's Orchestra of Nashville and Joshua Shepherd - Conductor, Educator, Performer and on YouTube at https://lnkd.in/eCx3EjKZ! Are you looking for someone who can curate/conduct a fun and eclectic program (including great, lesser known works like this piece by Goldsmith) for your orchestra's upcoming 2024 Halloween concert? I'm the right person for the job! üôã Just DM me or my manager Eva Adolfo at Eva Artistic Management to discuss details! #PaulVerhoeven #JerryGoldsmith #BasicInstinct #FilmMusic #MovieMusic #HalloweenConcert #OrchestraConductor\n\nA few Octobers ago I came upon Bram Stoker‚Äôs Dracula playing on cable tv. I had never seen the movie before. The movie hit me like a ton of bricks. üß± I was struck by the excellent production values of the movie which included a great script and casting, great cinematography, great acting, great costumes, and of course great music by Polish composer Wojciech Kilar. üéµ This particular telling of the well known Dracula story is different than others in that it leans into the romance aspect of the plot: both the romance between Jonathan and Mina, as well the later ensuing romance between Mina and Dracula. ‚ù§Ô∏è The music by Kilar is a lush, masterful orchestral swirl of dread, beauty, suspense and sensuality. It perfectly supports the surreal gothic masterwork by director Francis Ford Coppola. üé• The film‚Äôs dramatic apex occurs in a scene between Mina and Dracula as she begs him to take her and turn her into a vampire. It‚Äôs very emotional and passionate. The music, ‚ÄúMina/Dracula‚Äù on the soundtrack, matches the scene incredibly well. üíØ I fell in love with the score by Kilar and was thrilled to conduct the ‚ÄúMina/Dracula‚Äù piece with my orchestra this past October on our Spooky Symphony Virtual Concert. üëª I was so happy to share this music with my orchestra and audience because not only is the music fantastic but I'm always looking for opportunities in which to spotlight underrepresented composers in the film music genre, it's a passion of mine. So basically, two birds, one stone! To celebrate Wojciech Kilar, who was born on this day in 1932, I'm proud to share a performance I conducted of his piece \"Mina/Dracula\" with The People's Orchestra of Nashville: https://lnkd.in/eaTtH5yw Video of performance is also embedded below! Have you seen the movie before? Who's your favorite actor in it? Tell me in the comments below! To contact me regarding guest conducting opportunities (film music or otherwise), please DM me or my agent Eva Adolfo at Eva Artistic Management!\n\n\"A bell's not a bell 'til you ring it, A song's not a song 'til you sing it, Love in your heart wasn't put there to stay, Love isn't love 'til you give it away!\" - Oscar Hammerstein II On this day in 1895, Broadway's greatest lyricist, Oscar Hammerstein II was born! üéâ Oscar Greeley Clendenning Hammerstein II (July 12, 1895 ‚Äì August 23, 1960) was an American lyricist, librettist, theatrical producer, and (usually uncredited) director in musical theater for nearly 40 years. He won eight Tony Awards and two Academy Awards for Best Original Song. Many of his songs are standard repertoire for vocalists and jazz musicians. He co-wrote 850 songs. üéµ He is best known for his collaborations with composer Richard Rodgers, as the duo Rodgers and Hammerstein, whose musicals include Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I, and The Sound of Music. Described by Stephen Sondheim as an \"experimental playwright\", Hammerstein helped bring the American musical to new maturity by popularizing musicals that focused on stories and character rather than the lighthearted entertainment that the musical had been known for beforehand. üé∂ He also collaborated with Jerome Kern (with whom he wrote Show Boat), Vincent Youmans, Rudolf Friml, Richard A. Whiting, and Sigmund Romberg. To celebrate Maestro Hammerstein‚Äôs birthday, I‚Äôm proud to share three of his pieces I've conducted with The People's Orchestra of Nashville: People Will Say We‚Äôre In Love (from Oklahoma - featuring soloists Tyler Evick and Ivory Bodnar) Link to video of performance on YouTube: https://lnkd.in/ebU8_y5i If I Loved You (from Carousel - featuring soloists Mark David Williams and Jo Lynn Burks) Link to video of performance on YouTube: https://lnkd.in/eza9jHY5 Selections from The Sound of Music: Link to video of performance on YouTube: https://lnkd.in/eSSiVpde YouTube playlist of all 3 performances: https://lnkd.in/eN4huKZx If you enjoy the performances, please take a quick moment to like/share/subscribe to our pages on YouTube and Facebook--it helps us spread the word! Facebook at: The People's Orchestra of Nashville & Joshua Shepherd - Conductor, Educator, Performer and YouTube at: https://lnkd.in/eCx3EjKZ! I have a deep love and appreciation for musical theatre repertoire: I was lovingly raised on it by my grandma and mother. I believe this music is an integral part of our nation's cultural history and am passionate about conducting it, and sharing the music with musicians and audiences alike. Please keep me in mind for guest conducting engagements of this type of rep for your orchestra's upcoming season!

Hanks's films have grossed more than $4.9 billion in North America and more than $9.96 billion worldwide, making him the fourth-highest-grossing actor in North America. üéû Hanks made his breakthrough with leading roles in a series of comedies: Splash (1984), The Money Pit (1986), Big (1988) and A League of Their Own (1992). He won two consecutive Academy Awards for Best Actor, playing a gay lawyer suffering from AIDS in Philadelphia (1993) and the title character in Forrest Gump (1994). Hanks collaborated with Steven Spielberg on five films: Saving Private Ryan (1998), Catch Me If You Can (2002), The Terminal (2004), Bridge of Spies (2015) and The Post (2017), as well as the World War II miniseries Band of Brothers (2001), The Pacific (2010) and Masters of the Air (2024). He has also frequently collaborated with directors Ron Howard, Nora Ephron and Robert Zemeckis. üé¨ In Hanks' honor, I'm proud to share three selections I've conducted with The People's Orchestra of Nashville of music from movies Mr. Hanks has acted in: Love Theme from Splash (by Lee Holdridge), Forrest Gump Suite (by Alan Silvestri) & Hymn to the Fallen from Saving Private Ryan (by John Williams). üéµ Link to YouTube video of Love Theme from Splash performance: https://lnkd.in/e8SWHaX4 Link to YouTube video of Forrest Gump Suite performance: https://lnkd.in/esSWYNBX Link to YouTube video of Hymn to the Fallen performance: https://lnkd.in/esgpFPps Link to YouTube playlist of all 3 pieces: https://lnkd.in/eyzBTKFH Please take a quick moment to like/subscribe/follow our pages on Facebook: The People's Orchestra of Nashville, Joshua Shepherd - Conductor, Educator, Performer and on YouTube: https://lnkd.in/eCx3EjKZ!

I appreciate the consideration! #TomHanks #SplashMovie #ForrestGump #SavingPrivateRyan #FilmMusic #MovieMusic\n\nHappy Birthday to beloved musical theatre composer Richard Rodgers, who was born on this day in 1902! üéâ Richard Charles Rodgers (June 28, 1902 ‚Äì December 30, 1979) was an American composer who worked primarily in musical theatre. With 43 Broadway musicals and over 900 songs to his credit, Rodgers was one of the most well-known American composers of the 20th century, and his compositions had a significant influence on popular music. üéµ Rodgers is known for his songwriting partnerships, first with lyricist Lorenz Hart and then with Oscar Hammerstein II. With Hart he wrote musicals throughout the 1920s and 1930s, including Pal Joey, A Connecticut Yankee, On Your Toes and Babes in Arms. With Hammerstein he wrote musicals through the 1940s and 1950s, such as Oklahoma!, Flower Drum Song, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I, and The Sound of Music. His collaborations with Hammerstein, in particular, are celebrated for bringing the Broadway musical to a new maturity by telling stories that were focused on characters and drama rather than the earlier light-hearted entertainment of the genre. üé≠ To celebrate Maestro Rodgers‚Äô birthday, I‚Äôm proud to share three of his pieces I've conducted with The People's Orchestra of Nashville.

Feel free to DM me or my manager Eva Adolfo at Eva Artistic Management to discuss potential collaborations!\n\nHappy 90th birthday to preeminent American composer, arranger, producer, jazz pianist, and band leader, Dave Grusin! Grusin has composed many scores for feature films and television and has won numerous awards for his soundtrack and record work, including an Academy Award and 10 Grammy Awards. Grusin is also a frequent collaborator with director Sydney Pollack, scoring many of his films like Three Days of the Condor (1975), Absence of Malice (1981), Tootsie (1982), The Firm (1993), and Random Hearts (1999). In 1978, Grusin founded GRP Records with Larry Rosen, and was an early pioneer of digital recording. One of the most inspiring concerts I‚Äôve been a part of was the ‚ÄúEvening with Dave Grusin‚Äù PBS concert recording in Miami, with the Frost School of Music - Henry Mancini Institute Orchestra! Video of concert here: https://lnkd.in/eD34aFWd To celebrate the big day, I‚Äôm happy to share The People's Orchestra of Nashville‚Äôs performance of Grusin‚Äôs Theme from On Golden Pond, which comes from our Veterans Concert this past November. I included the piece as I was looking to program selections of music which musically depict the different aspects of American nature and wildlife. Link to video on YouTube of performance: https://lnkd.in/edJd8cfa Are you looking for someone to guest conduct your Veterans Concert this coming November? Someone who is passionate about these programs and is eager to share this kind of music with your audience? I‚Äôm your guy!

I'm looking forward to the opportunity in conducting the full orchestra and chamber orchestra, and teaching upper strings applied lessons and music theory--all things I really enjoy! I will be visiting local/state area high schools to help spread the word about the ESU Music Department in the effort to recruit students to attend the university and to participate in the ensembles. In particular, my aim is to strengthen/build up the Emporia Symphony Orchestra (full ensemble) by attracting new string majors. The ESO is a hybrid ensemble: college-community (similar to the make-up of The People's Orchestra of Nashville and similar to what I experienced as an undergrad at Florida Atlantic University). I look forward to bringing that previous experience as I lead the ESO into it's next exciting chapter. üé∂ During my visit this March, I felt a spirit of genuine collegiality between the music faculty and between the students and faculty, as well. We all want the same thing and am striving towards the same goals: to provide the best learning environment for the ESU music students and to challenge them to be their best selves, not only musically but interpersonally. üëç This opportunity at ESU didn't happen overnight and I didn't achieve it alone. I'd like to thank (now retired) Union University Music Professor Mike Mann for seeing the potential I had and for advocating for me to teach at Union University. Mike was helpful in forwarding my application to Dr. John D. Kinchen III for consideration. Thank you to both Professor Mann and Dr. Kinchen for their constant encouragement and support during my time at Union, I really appreciate it and will remember fondly my time at UU. Thank you also to Dr. Jamie Weaver, for helping \"show me the ropes\" and for her being an excellent colleague as we taught upper strings together at UU. üéª The university is supportive of my outside conducting activities: I'll be returning to Nashville for the occasional PON concert and I'll still also be accepting cover and guest conducting engagements. To those that made it to the end of this post, thank you for your patience in reading this long message! I appreciate your prayers as I take this next step in my career--this is a big move from TN to KS, not just physically but professionally. I'm looking forward to the beginning of the school year and can't wait to get started!
