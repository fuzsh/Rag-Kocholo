He began playing piano at the age of six, and broke into the industry through CBS TV series like The Twilight Zone. From the '60s until his death in 2004, Goldsmith wrote the scores for an array of popular and acclaimed films, including the original Planet of the Apes, Chinatown,Alien, Poltergeist, The Mummy and many others."
