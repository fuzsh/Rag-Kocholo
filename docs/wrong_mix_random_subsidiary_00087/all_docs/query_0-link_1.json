        "text": "Public university in Geneva, Switzerland\n\nThe University of Geneva (French: Université de Genève) is a public research university located in Geneva, Switzerland. It was founded in 1559 by French theologian John Calvin as a theological seminary.[1][2] It remained focused on theology until the 17th century, when it became a center for enlightenment scholarship. Today, it is the third largest university in Switzerland by number of students.[3]\n\nIn 1873, it dropped its religious affiliations and became officially secular.[2] In 2009, the University of Geneva celebrated the 450th anniversary of its founding.[4] Almost 40% of the students come from foreign countries.\n\nThe university holds and actively pursues teaching, research, and community service as its primary objectives. UNIGE is a member of the League of European Research Universities (including academic institutions such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Cambridge, Heidelberg, and Milan) the Coimbra Group and the European University Association.[5]\n\nThe university has a diverse student body, with students from over 150 countries. It is also home to numerous research centers and institutes, including the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, the Global Studies Institute, and the Institute of Global Health.\n\nThe university was founded in 1559 as the Academy of Geneva (Académie de Genève) by French theologian John Calvin, as a seminary administered by the Company of Pastors, to be the center of public education in Protestant Geneva.[6] With the goal of educating not only pastors but also magistrates for the republic, in 1565 the academy began the teaching of Law.[6]\n\nDuring the French annexation of Geneva (1798–1813), the school was reorganized into a more universal format, with the introduction of degrees and its division in faculties.[6] This process of modernization continued into the period of national Restoration[6]\n\nThe University of Geneva is located in several districts in the eastern part of the city and in the nearby city of Carouge (on the left bank of the Lake Léman and the Rhône), and the different buildings are sometimes very distant from each other (the Battelle buildings are for instance more than three kilometers away from the Bastions). The oldest building (1559) is the Collège Calvin, and is no longer a university building. Lectures are given in six different main locations, Les Bastions, Uni Dufour, Sciences I, II and III, Uni Mail and Uni Pignon, Centre Médical Universitaire (CMU), and Battelle;[7] as well as in other less important locations. [8]\n\nBuilt between 1868 and 1871, Uni Bastions is the symbol of Geneva's academic life. It is located in the middle of a park and is host to the faculty of Protestant Theology and to the Faculty of Arts.[9]\n\nIts architecture was inspired by Le Corbusier. It hosts the Rectorat and the administration of the university.[10]\n\nIt is Switzerland's biggest building dedicated to social sciences. It currently hosts the Faculty of Law, of Economics and Management,[11] of Psychology and Education and the Faculty of Translation and Interpreting.[12]\n\nThe University of Geneva is structured in various faculties and interfaculty centers which are representing teaching, research and service to society in the various disciplines.\n\nThe university is composed of nine faculties:[13]\n\nFaculty of Sciences[14]\n\nFaculty of Medicine[15]\n\nFaculty of Humanities[16]\n\nFaculty Geneva School of Economics and Management (GSEM)[17]\n\nFaculty Geneva School of Social Sciences (G3S)[18]\n\nFaculty of Law (Geneva Law School)[19]\n\nFaculty of Theology[20]\n\nFaculty of Psychology and Education[21]\n\nFaculty of Translation and Interpreting[22]\n\nThe university is composed of fourteen interfacultary centers. Amongst others:\n\nInstitute for Reformation History (Reformation)\n\nInterfaculty Center for Informatics (computer science)\n\nInstitute for Environmental Sciences (energy policy)\n\nThe Global Studies Institute\n\nInterfaculty Center of Gerontology (gerontology)\n\nSwiss Center for Affective Sciences (affective science)\n\nThe university has also several partnerships with the nearby institutions, where students at the university may take courses.\n\nGraduate Institute of International and Development Studies (IHEID)\n\nBossey Ecumenical Institute of the World Council of Churches\n\nWyss Center for Bio- and Neuro-engineering\n\nSwiss National Supercomputing Centre\n\nArt-Law Centre[23]\n\nCenter for Biomedical Imaging(CIBM)\n\nUniversity Centre of Legal Medicine (CURML)[24]\n\nThe Institute for Work and Health (IST)\n\nThe University of Geneva had a budget of roughly 760 million CHF for the year 2016.[25] It mostly comes from the cantonal subventions, the other notable contributors being the federal state and the tuition fees.[26]\n\nUNIGE's library facilities are spread across four sites.\n\nUni Arve is host to seven libraries: Bibliothèque Ernst & Lucie Schmidheiny, Bibliothèque d'Anthropologie, Bibliothèque du Centre universitaire d'informatique, Bibliothèque Georges de Rham (Mathematics), Bibliothèque de l'Institut des Sciences de l'environnement (ISE), Bibliothèque de l'Observatoire (Astronomy) and the Bibliothèque des Sciences de la Terre et de l'environnement.[27]\n\nUni Bastions hosts the language libraries, as well as the university's libraries focused on history and musicology.[28]\n\nUni CMU is home to an extensive collection of medical issues. Besides, it is also hosts the Centre de documentation en santé (CDS) and the Bibliothèque de l'nstitut de la médecine et de la santé et de l'Institut d'éthique biomédicale (IHMS – IEB).[29]\n\nUni Mail's collection is focused on the following themes: Economics and social sciences, Law, Psychology and Learning Sciences, Translation and Interpreting, European studies, French as a foreign language and Musicology. Besides, it also hosts UNIGE's multimedia library.[30]\n\nThe journal de l'UNIGE is released biweekly. Its purpose is to ease communication inside the university, to inform the students about the research being carried at UNIGE, to convey new opinions and to inform students and teachers of upcoming university events via l'Agenda.[31]\n\nCampus is released monthly with the objective to ease communication between the scientific community and the citizens and to be a \"bridge between science and city\".[32]\n\nTo be enrolled in a bachelor programme, one must hold a Swiss maturity diploma or a secondary diploma considered by the University of Geneva to be equivalent.[33] If the degree was not pursued in French, applicants must pass an eliminatory French language test at the beginning of September, which consists of an oral and a written comprehension test and of a piece of argumentative writing.[34] Tuition fees are of CHF 500 per semester.\n\nUNIGE's academic year runs from mid-September to mid-June. It is divided in two semesters, each one being concluded by an examination session, held respectively at the beginning of January and at the beginning of June. An examination session is held at the end of August and beginning of September as a retake for students who failed their January or June examinations.[35]\n\nDuring the three days before the start of the new academic year, the Journées d'accueil (Welcome Days) are organized by the university to introduce the new students to the city and the facilities, tips are also given on how to succeed at university. A second chapter including city tours, outdoor concerts and animations is also organized by the student association UniAccueil (AUA) to celebrate the new academic year.[36]\n\nBefore 2005, the university applied various very different models, depending on Faculties, and sometimes even on Departments (or \"Sections\"). Some Faculties applied the French education model of granting academic degrees, with some minor differences: demi-licence (two years), trois-quarts de licence (three years), licence (four years), diplôme d'études approfondies and diplôme d'études superieures spécialisées (DEA/DESS) (one–two years), and doctorate (three–five years).\n\nThe university now follows the requirements of the Bologna process: bachelor's (three years), master's (one–two years), in some departments or sections Master of Advanced Studies (one–two years), doctorate (three–five years).[37]\n\nUNIGE offers more than 240 types of diplomas: about 30 bachelor's degrees,[38] 70 masters and 78 doctorates. It also provides more than 200 programmes of continuing education in various sectors.[39]\n\nStudents at UNIGE have the possibility to study abroad for a semester or a year during their degree. Partner universities include Free University of Berlin, Harvard Law School, École Normale Supérieure, Trinity College Dublin, Erasmus University of Rotterdam, Université Libre de Bruxelles, King's College London, McGill University, HEC Montreal, University of Ottawa, University of Oxford, Uppsala University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Michigan, UCLA, University of Southampton, University of Sydney, University of Tokyo.[40]\n\nThe key sectors of research at the University of Geneva are sciences (molecular biology, bio-informatics, etc.), elementary physics, astrophysics, economics, social sciences, psychology, chemistry, biochemistry and biophysics.\n\nUNIGE is home to six national research centers: in genetics (Frontiers in Genetics), in material sciences (MaNEP), in study of emotions (Affective Sciences), in chemical biology (with EPFL), in study of mental illness (Synaptic, with EPFL and Unil), in study of life path (with Unil). UNIGE also carries research in international studies since the creation in 2013 of the Global Studies Institute, in finance with the Geneva Finance Research Institute,[41] and in environmental studies, with the creation in 2009 of the Institut des sciences de l'environnement.[42]\n\nFamous discoveries have been made by researcher working at UNIGE including the discoveries of extrasolar planets by Michel Mayor, and of quantum teleportation by Nicolas Gisin.\n\nThe University of Geneva is consistently ranked one of the top universities in the world.\n\nIn 2023, the University of Geneva was ranked 49rd overall in the world according to the Shanghai Ranking. It was ranked 125th overall according to the QS ranking and 183rd overall according to the THE ranking.
