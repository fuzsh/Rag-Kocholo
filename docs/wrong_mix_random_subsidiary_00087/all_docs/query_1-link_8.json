        "text": "Farewell\n\nThanks for joining us this summer as we revisited some of the 200,000 memorable lives featured in The New York Times’s archive.\n\nWe wandered back into a fatal Alaskan odyssey and over the rainbow. We heard the echoes of shots that reverberated in America and around the world. We mingled with criminals, leaders, protesters, artists and athletes, many who forever changed their professions. We relived the first steps on the moon and the speech that divided India and Pakistan. And we asked Anderson Cooper, Cory Booker, Dominique Dawes, Tom Brokaw and David H. Petraeus whom from our archives they would dine with, and why.\n\nYou can find more fascinating New York Times obituaries, year round, here and on our Twitter feed. Click here for the continuing feature “Notable Deaths of 2016”, and if you want to revisit some of the most momentous obituaries to have appeared in The Times, you might look for “The Book of the Dead,” a compilation of obituaries dating back to the newspaper’s founding in 1851. It will be available for preorder and will appear on store shelves in October.\n\nWe welcome your feedback about Not Forgotten here. We hope you enjoyed it.\n\nPrincess Diana, Who Was Beloved, Yet Troubled by Her Crown\n\nShe died young. She died violently. She was a global celebrity in the broadest sense, a woman of startling charisma who became famous when she married the heir to the English throne and even more famous when she divorced him and embarked on a life of her own.\n\nBut the sudden death of Diana, the Princess of Wales, alongside her lover in a fiery car crash in a Paris tunnel on Aug. 31, 1997, elevated her into something else entirely: a symbol of a nation’s emotional and generational conflicts, a blank slate on which an entire people — and to some extent, the world at large — could project their own fears, prejudices and passions. Britain went a little crazy. For a few disorienting weeks, everything seemed up for grabs, including the monarchy itself.\n\nShe was born Lady Diana Spencer, the daughter of an earl, in 1961. Althorp, her childhood home, was a stately, drafty pile, crammed with priceless works of art. Her childhood was privileged but lonely — her parents had a terrible divorce — and her education indifferent.\n\nIn fact, nothing remarkable at all happened to Diana until, at age 19, she married Charles, the Prince of Wales, in view of thousands of strangers (millions, if you count the television audience), wearing a voluminous puffball of a dress that drowned her slender frame.\n\nIf the wedding was a gossamer fairy tale, the marriage was a real-life nightmare. Diana was emotional, fragile, needy, anorexic, bulimic; Charles came from the stiff-upper-lip school of interpersonal relations and had a longtime (married) girlfriend, Camilla Parker-Bowles.\n\nCharles and Diana had two sons. She eventually found various lovers, too. Their divorce was shocking and unprecedented, but it freed Diana to look elsewhere for love, and she soon took up with a man named Dodi al-Fayed, a rich playboy whose father owned Harrod’s department store. They died together in a high-speed chase in Paris, fleeing from paparazzi pursuing them in cars and motorcycles after a date.\n\nBritain went into deep shock, wondering aloud whether it had helped cause Diana’s death by not appreciating her enough in life. The power of the emotion — and the frenzy whipped up by the tabloid newspapers — all but forced Queen Elizabeth to break with centuries of tradition and protocol and make a public address to the nation. Elton John sang at the funeral. Men, women and children lined the streets and wept as Diana’s coffin went by.\n\nDiana is nearly as vivid a figure in death as in life. She lives on in her sons, William and Harry, who have talked in recent years about her effect on them. William’s wife, Kate, a future queen of England — this would take some time, because both Elizabeth and Charles, the current heir, would have to die before William inherits the throne — wears the massive sapphire and diamond engagement ring that Charles gave to Diana, and that William in turn gave to her.\n\nRead the obituary “Diana Killed in a Car Accident in Paris”\n\nChristopher McCandless, Whose Alaskan Odyssey Ended in Death\n\n“No one is yet certain who he was,” said an Associated Press article that appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 13, 1992. “But his diary and two notes found at the camp tell a wrenching story of his desperate and progressively futile efforts to survive.”\n\nThe young man in question was Christopher McCandless. His identity was not confirmed for weeks, but in time he would become internationally famous as a bold, or very imprudent, figure.\n\nMr. McCandless died alone in an abandoned bus on the Stampede Trail, a desolate stretch of backcountry near Denali, in August 1992. He was surrounded by his meager provisions: a .22-caliber rifle; some well-worn and annotated paperbacks; a camera and five rolls of exposed film; and the diary, 113 cryptic notes on the back pages of a book that identified edible plants.\n\nBefore Mr. McCandless died, from starvation aggravated by accidental poisoning, he had survived for more than 110 days on nothing but a 10-pound sack of rice and what he could hunt and forage in the unforgiving taiga.\n\nJon Krakauer, at the time a freelance writer, heard about Mr. McCandless’s story from an editor at Outside magazine who had read the Associated Press piece. The editor wanted Mr. Krakauer to write a long article about Mr. McCandless on a tight deadline, and he delivered.\n\nBut after the story ran, Mr. Krakauer needed to learn more.\n\n“I decided I wanted to write this book because I felt like there was a lot more to tell; there was a lot I hadn’t discovered,” Mr. Krakauer said in a telephone interview.\n\nOver the next few years he dug into Mr. McCandless’s life and discovered a complicated, compelling story. He chronicled Mr. McCandless’s travels and lonely death in “Into the Wild” (1996), a national best-seller that has since sold millions of copies in the United States. A film based on the book, starring Emile Hirsch as Mr. McCandless and directed by Sean Penn, was released in 2008.\n\nMr. McCandless’s story continues to fascinate, confound and infuriate readers two decades after “Into the Wild” was first published. Mr. Krakauer said it was by far his best-selling work, adding, “I get more hate mail from this book than probably from anything else.”\n\n“He’s this Rorschach test: People read into him what they see,” he said of Mr. McCandless. “Some people see an idiot, and some people see themselves. I’m the latter, for sure.”\n\nMr. McCandless came from a well-off family on the East Coast. He graduated from Emory University with honors, then disappeared in 1990. He donated virtually all the money in his bank account to Oxfam, a charity dedicated to fighting poverty, then drove west before abandoning his car and burning the cash he had left. He deserted his family and a privileged life without looking back.\n\nMr. McCandless canoed into Mexico, hitchhiked north and worked odd jobs along the way. He often roamed alone, but left an impression on many of the friends he made along the way. An older man named Ron Franz even offered to adopt him; Mr. McCandless gently turned him down.\n\nHe never contacted his parents, Walt and Billie McCandless, or his sister, Carine. His parents were worried, but knew that long, improvised jaunts were nothing new for their son.\n\n“He was always an adventuresome, pretty self-contained individual,” Walt McCandless said in an interview. “And it’s important to realize that the trip he didn’t come back from wasn’t his first adventure.”\n\nSome readers see Mr. McCandless’s rejection of materialism and his embrace of the natural world as romantic, taking him for a contemporary Thoreau. Many others, especially native Alaskans, have argued that he must have been mentally ill, suicidal or hubristic, and that it was irresponsible for Mr. Krakauer to glorify his story.\n\nWalt McCandless and Mr. Krakauer both disagreed with that assessment.\n\nIn 2014 Mr. McCandless’s sister Carine published “The Wild Truth,” a memoir that depicted a physically abusive, chaotic childhood that both siblings were forced to conceal.\n\n“Chris made his choices, and he accepted accountability,” Ms. McCandless said in an interview. But she said she does feel her parents should accept some blame.\n\n\"I do hold them accountable for his disappearance,” she said. “I think for him to leave in that extreme way, to go without telling anyone where he was — I do hold them accountable for his disappearance, but not for his death.”\n\nWalt and Billie McCandless said they did not want to comment on the memoir.\n\n“He was a tortured soul; he did what he had to do,” said Mr. Krakauer, who wrote the foreword to “The Wild Truth,” adding: “He suffered as a young man, and he did what he had to do to escape it.”\n\nBy the time Mr. McCandless died, he seemed to have found a measure of peace, according to one of his last notes, scrawled inside a paperback copy of “Education of a Wandering Man,” a memoir by the novelist Louis L’Amour. It said:\n\n“I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD. GOODBYE AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL.”\n\nRead the article “Dying in the Wild, a Hiker Recorded the Terror”\n\nRead the review “Taking Risk to Its ‘Logical’ Extreme”\n\nAn earlier version of this article, using information from Mr. Krakauer’s publisher, misstated the number of copies of \"Into the Wild” that have been sold. It is several million, not “nearly two million.”\n\nLong May He Reign: Michael Jackson, the ‘King of Pop’\n\nWhen Michael Joseph Jackson was born into a large family in a small house in Gary, Ind., on Aug. 29, 1958, no one could have imagined that he would become perhaps the most recognizable entertainer on the planet. On the king of pop’s birthday, Not Forgotten takes you back through his life and music.\n\nJackson’s rise was swift. By the time he was 10, he and his brothers were pop sensations performing as the Jackson 5. The group had four No. 1 Motown hits in a little more than a year, including “I Want You Back,” all of which featured Michael’s ebullient high-pitched voice.\n\nBy 20, Jackson wanted to break away from his overbearing father, his demanding siblings and the Jackson 5 sound. His first solo album, “Off the Wall,” may be the quintessential recording of the disco era. It featured “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” for which Jackson sang with a flirtatious falsetto.\n\nJackson’s next album was “Thriller,” which was released in 1982 and became the best-selling album of all time. It won eight Grammy Awards, spent two years on the Billboard album chart and sold more than 100 million copies around the world. Jackson’s dancing and innovative music videos, especially the one for the title track “Thriller,” helped redefine the medium and open MTV to black musicians.\n\nFive years later, “Bad” was released. It was also hugely successful, with five No. 1 singles and a video for the title track that was directed by Martin Scorsese.\n\nAfter “Bad” the bizarre details of Jackson’s personal life often overshadowed his abilities as a musician and entertainer. His other albums include “Dangerous” (1991) and “HIStory,” and although they all did well commercially they never approached the world-beating success of “Thriller.”\n\nJackson died on June 25, 2009, from an overdose of the anesthetic propofol. There was a worldwide outpouring of grief. Radio stations played marathons of his music. And fans were left to decide which Jackson they would remember, as the pop music critic Jon Pareles wrote in an appraisal in The New York Times:\n\nThe unsurpassed entertainer, the gifted and driven song-and-dance man who wielded rhythm, melody, texture and image to create and promote the best-selling album of all time, “Thriller”? Or the bizarre figure he became after he failed in his stated ambition to outsell “Thriller,” and after the gleaming fantasy gave way to tabloid revelations, bitter rejoinders and the long public silence he was scheduled to break next month?\n\nHow do you remember Jackson? Tell us using #tellnyt.\n\nRead the obituary “A Star Idolized and Haunted, Michael Jackson Dies at 50”\n\nEmmett Till, Whose Martyrdom Launched the Civil Rights Movement\n\nEmmett Louis Till was born on July 25, 1941, on Chicago’s South Side and was nicknamed Bobo because of his fun-loving, cheerful disposition while growing up in the segregated middle-class neighborhood. When he was 14 he went to Mississippi to spend the summer with his cousins, and his mother gave him his father’s signet ring as a gift.\n\nOn Aug. 24, 1955, after an exhausting day of picking cotton in the scorching Delta sun, Till and his cousins went to a local store run by a poor white couple in their 20s, Roy and Carolyn Bryant. Ms. Bryant was working alone in the store when Till went in to buy bubblegum. It is not clear what happened inside, but soon afterward Ms. Bryant stormed out, presumably to get a pistol from her car parked outside. Till, unaware of the danger, whistled, and his cousins, now panicked, quickly drove him away.\n\nMs. Bryant later claimed that Till had flirted with her on a dare. The details would later change depending on when she told the story.\n\nFour days later, around 2:30 a.m., Ms. Bryant’s husband, Roy, and his half brother J. W. Milam pounded on the door of the Wright family home where Till was staying with a pistol. Bryant announced that they were “looking for the boy that did the talking.” Forcing their way in, according to a PBS documentary about Till, they roused Till from sleep, marched him to their car and sped away.\n\nTill’s disfigured body was found three days later, “the most celebrated race-sex case since Scottsboro was born,” the journalist William Bradford Huie wrote in Look magazine. His body was so mutilated that it could be identified only by the silver signet ring, still on his finger.\n\n“Someone is going to pay for this,” Till’s mother wailed, according to an American National Biography web page about her. She demanded that her son’s body be returned to Chicago for an open-coffin funeral. “I wanted the world to see,” she said.\n\nTill’s body, unembalmed, was displayed publicly for four days. People left in tears. Some fainted.\n\nThe murder became a rallying point for the nascent civil rights movement. The Rev. Jesse Jackson called it the movement’s “Big Bang.”\n\n“More than 100,000 people saw his body lying in that casket,” he told The New York Times in 2003.\n\nThe Bryant brothers were found not guilty. After the acquittal, they kissed their wives, lit cigars and posed for pictures. And later, protected from double jeopardy, they boasted about how they had murdered Till.\n\nTill’s mother, Mamie Till Mobley, turned to the federal government to no avail. She tried to meet with President Dwight D. Eisenhower, but he refused. J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the F.B.I. at the time, declined to make the killing a federal case.\n\n“There has been no allegation made,” he said, “that the victim Emmett Till has been subjected to the deprivation of any right or privilege which is secured and protected by the Constitution and the laws of the United States.”\n\nThe Till case became emblematic of a history of violence toward African-Americans and of the country’s legacy of white supremacy. It provoked international outrage and pressure on political leaders in the United States. Young black Americans grasped the precariousness of their own lives, and figures like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Medgar Evers and many others were galvanized to press the fight on the front lines. Ms. Till Mobley became a teacher and civil rights activist herself, as did many whites.\n\nAs Mr. Jackson said, “Emmett’s murder broke the emotional chains of Jim Crow.”\n\nRead the article “Mississippi Jury Acquits 2 Accused in Youth’s Killing”\n\nRead the article “Racial Issues Stirred by Mississippi Killing”\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, a Philosophical Renegade Whose Ideas Endured\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, the rebel of 19th-century philosophy who died 116 years ago on Aug. 25, would probably recognize some of his ideas in modern society.\n\nNietzsche wrote with the confidence and vehemence of any pundit. He posited extreme precursors to moral relativism and self-actualization, two ideas that have become prevalent during the last few decades. His often-aphoristic writing style would be perfect for Twitter, where there are many accounts in his name.\n\nWhether he would be pleased about how his ideas have influenced our culture is another matter, but it would be very difficult to argue that they have not. Perhaps the most well-known example is the frequently made accusation that his writings fostered a sense of Teutonic racial superiority that Germany and then Hitler would use to justify embarking on two world wars, even though Nietzsche himself had repudiated his nationality and claimed to be descended from Polish nobles.\n\nHis ideas might seem more familiar to us now, but at his death they were controversial, even shocking.\n\n“Nietzsche was largely influenced by the pessimism of Schopenhauer, and his writings, full of revolutionary opinions, were fired with a fearless iconoclasm which surpassed the wildest dreams of contemporary free thought,” The New York Times wrote after he died on Aug. 25, 1900. “His doctrines, however, were inspired by lofty aspirations, while the brilliancy of his thought and diction and the epigrammatic force of his writings commanded even the admiration of his most pronounced enemies, of which he had many.”\n\nThose enemies included organized religion, especially Christianity, democracy, mediocrity, nationalism and women. Nietzsche railed against these and other adversaries on pages often densely packed with allusions, symbolism and language closer to romantic poetry than fusty metaphysics. Here is a sampling of his best-known writings:\n\nOut of life’s school of war: What does not kill me, makes me stronger. — “Twilight of the Idols”\n\nWhoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And when you look long into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you. — “Beyond Good and Evil”\n\nGod is dead! God remains dead! And we have killed him! How shall we console our selves, the most murderous of all murderers? — “The Gay Science”\n\nUnlike many of his philosophical predecessors, Nietzsche did not argue for a specific weltanschauung, or worldview, even though his writings may suggest one. He distrusted any thinker who proposed a comprehensive system for interpreting the world, and he often wrote in a manner that allowed for multiple interpretations.\n\nA critical examination of his work in The New York Times in 1910 explained his approach:\n\nNietzsche is not a philosopher in the strict and technical sense of the word. He has no system or consistent body of thought professing to explain all aspects of the universe. He does not expressly deal with epistemology, ontology or, indeed, with metaphysics in general. He concentrates himself on the moral and aesthetic aspects of things, on their “values,” as is now the custom to say, owing to Nietzsche himself, who introduced the term; and he does so with a literary force and artistic power of presentation which makes his writings specially stimulating and is really the cause of his comparative popularity.\n\nNietzsche’s originality may have stemmed from consideration, then renunciation. He was born on Oct. 15, 1844, the son of a Lutheran minister. His father died when he was young, and his mother hoped he would join the church, but by the time he went to the University of Bonn (he later moved to the University of Leipzig) he had decided to study the classics and pursue a career in philology. He earned a professorship in Greek at the University of Basel in Switzerland when he was just 24 and became inspired by Richard Wagner and Arthur Schopenhauer.\n\nBy the late 1870s Nietzsche had retired from his professorship, broken off his relationship with Wagner and tried to wrest his philosophy from Schopenhauer’s shadow.\n\nHe worked tirelessly throughout the 1880s, producing what became “The Gay Science,” “Beyond Good and Evil” and “Thus Spoke Zarathustra,” but his physical and mental health declined. His Times obituary said that when he died he had “been hopelessly insane” since 1889.\n\nBut his ideas endured, and have since intrigued innumerable thinkers. The following description of Nietzsche’s impact, from a Times review of several books about his life in 1915, remains as true now as it was a century ago.\n\n“No thinker of modern times comes more unexpectedly and with less traceable connection with the general lines of European thought: in the philosophic world he is indeed a bolt from the blue.”\n\nRead the obituary “Prof. Nietzsche Dead”\n\nRead the article “The Nietzsche the Nazis Don’t Know”\n\nAaliyah, Whose Soaring Career Was Cut Short by a Tragedy\n\nShe was the princess of R&B, a Grammy-nominated singer and actress whose glassy vocals against synthetic soundscapes pioneered a new genre. But she was also a girl next door, a teenager with her own street style who rose above the vulgarity of other stars.\n\nAaliyah Dana Haughton died 15 years ago along with eight other passengers of a small airplane that crashed in the Bahamas. She was 22, but she had already reached a level of fame few could achieve in a lifetime.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn and raised in Detroit, Aaliyah was raised for stardom. At 11, she sang on stage with Gladys Knight. True to its title, her debut album, “Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number,” was released when she was 15. It was produced by the R&B giant R. Kelly and included chart toppers like “Back and Forth” and “At Your Best (You Are Love).” It went platinum, selling more than a million copies. In one of her more gossip-provoking moments, it was widely reported that she had secretly married R. Kelly, who was in his late 20s. Their marriage was annulled.\n\nAt the beginning of her senior year of high school in 1996, she released her second album, “One in a Million,” with help from the star producer-songwriter duo Timbaland and Missy Elliot. Timbaland’s trademark fusion of hip-hop and electronic music featured twitchy, complex syncopated beats and start-stop rhythms that complemented Aaliyah’s precocious, sultry voice. That album sold two million copies.\n\nThe collaboration with Timbaland took her to new heights in 1998 with “Are You That Somebody,“ recorded for the “Dr. Dolittle” soundtrack. The song, which the critic Simon Reynolds called “the most radical pop single” of the year, earned Aaliyah the first of her five Grammy Award nominations.\n\nIn The Times, Kelefa Sanneh wrote, “Where most divas insist on being the center of the song, she knew how to disappear into the music, how to match her voice to the bass line — it was sometimes difficult to tell one from the other.”\n\nAaliyah’s acting career took off in 2000 with a lead part in “Romeo Must Die.” Her hit single on the soundtrack, “Try Again,” earned her another Grammy nomination. She also had a title role in the film “Queen of the Damned,” which was released after her death.\n\nAaliyah died on her way back to Miami from Abaco Island, where she had finished working on the video for her latest album’s third single, “Rock the Boat,” directed by Hype Williams.\n\nRead the obituary “Aaliyah, 22, Singer Who First Hit the Charts at 15”\n\nRead the review “A Pioneer, Briefly, Of a New Sound”\n\n‘In Cold Blood,’ Truman Capote’s Achievement and Undoing\n\nIn 1959, Truman Capote stumbled on a short article in The New York Times about a gruesome quadruple murder at a Kansas farm. He soon realized that it was the story he had been waiting to write for 20 years.\n\nWhen he began writing professionally, Capote, who died 32 years ago today, theorized that journalism and creative writing could come together in the form of what he called the “nonfiction novel.” The subject had to be right, however; with journalism underpinning such a novel, the pitfall was that it could quickly date itself. Crime, he decided, could be the perfect vehicle.\n\n“The human heart being what it is, murder was a theme not likely to darken and yellow with time,” he told George Plimpton in a 1966 interview in The New York Times.\n\nThe first people he shared his nonfiction novel idea with, he said, thought of it as merely a remedy for writer’s block. Capote disagreed.\n\n“Reporting can be made as interesting as fiction, and done as artistically,” he told Plimpton.\n\nAccompanied by his childhood friend Harper Lee, the author of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” Capote made his way to Kansas to investigate the murders of the Clutter family. Their trip resulted in “In Cold Blood,” which made his name synonymous with the true crime genre.\n\nBy then he was 35 and had already achieved fame and fortune with his fiction, which included “Other Voices, Other Rooms” and “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” But “In Cold Blood,” which reconstructed in stark detail the murders at the Clutter farm, was a radical departure for him.\n\nThe killers, Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, both of them ex-convicts, had intended to rob the family, which they knew to be well-off. But they were surprised to find almost no money in the house; everyone but the robbers, it seemed, knew that the farm owner, Herbert Clutter, paid only with checks.\n\nBefore arriving at the farm, Smith and Hickock had agreed that no witnesses could be left behind, whether or not the robbery was successful. The Clutters were tied up in separate rooms and killed at close range by shotgun blasts. Herbert Clutter’s throat was also slit.\n\n“In Cold Blood” started as a series of articles for The New Yorker, based on six years of research and interviews that, Capote said, were transcribed from memory without the use of tape recorders or notes. Made into a book, it became a national best seller, despite assertions that it is not entirely factual. And it brought Capote even more financial and social success.\n\nThe book, disturbing and gory, took its toll on him, though. He told Plimpton that if he had known what was waiting for him in Kansas, he would have “driven straight on. Like a bat out of hell.”\n\nCapote formed a bond with Perry Smith; though strikingly different, they both had endured turbulent childhoods. “Each looked at each other and saw, or thought he saw, the man he might have been,” Gerald Clarke wrote in “Capote,” his biography of the writer published in 1988. (Philip Seymour Hoffman won a best-actor Oscar for his performance as the title character in the 2005 film “Capote.”)\n\nCapote knew that before he could finish his book, the ending — the executions of the two convicted murderers — had to happen. In 1965, when the killers were hanged, the conflict he felt “tore him apart,” Mr. Clarke said in an email.\n\nCapote told Plimpton: “I’m still very much haunted by the whole thing. I have finished the book, but in a sense I haven’t finished it.”\n\nCapote lived in a “heavy-drinking generation,” as Mr. Clarke described it, but after the publication of “In Cold Blood,” his drinking got worse, and he started using drugs. Once slender, he deteriorated into a “paunchy” man, as his Times obituary noted in 1984.\n\nIn July 1978 Capote was interviewed on Stanley Siegel’s live television talk show (shown at 4:36 below). Siegel, who died last January, asked the obviously inebriated Capote what would happen to him if he did not give up alcohol and drugs.\n\n“The obvious answer is that eventually I’ll kill myself,” he replied.\n\nHe was not able to kick his destructive habits. Six years later, a coroner attributed his death, at 59, to liver failure.\n\nAt a 1984 memorial service, Robert L. Bernstein, chairman of Random House at the time, said Capote had lived “a colorful life, a complicated life, sometimes a turbulent life.”\n\nRead the obituary “Truman Capote Is Dead at 59; Novelist of Style and Clarity”\n\nHero, Criminal or Both: Huey P. Newton Pushed Black Americans to Fight Back\n\nAs many Americans protested the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., two years ago, members of the Huey P. Newton Gun Club carried their rifles on a march in Dallas. And last month, in response to more police shootings, they took them to another rally in Dallas in which five officers were fatally shot by a veteran of the Army Reserve, not a club member.\n\nThe Dallas club began in 2014 after an officer there killed an unarmed black man and wounded a child with a stray bullet but was not disciplined. The club’s members made it their mission to patrol their neighborhoods, keeping an eye on the police and others.\n\nThe name Huey P. Newton can elicit cries of “hero” or “criminal,” and the space in between reflects the distance in racial perspectives that the United States has failed to bridge since Newton helped found the Black Panthers 50 years ago, when the civil rights struggle was moving beyond the South to black neighborhoods in the North and West.\n\nNewton advocated armed self-defense in black communities, where the organization also provided social services. They would patrol the streets, guns drawn, turning them on drug dealers and police officers alike.\n\n“We’ve never advocated violence, violence is inflicted upon us,” Newton told The Times in 1970, one month after a California court overturned his conviction for killing a police officer in Oakland, Calif., where the Panthers originated. “But we do believe in self-defense for ourselves and for black people.”\n\nExpressing a willingness to defend oneself with weapons was hardly revolutionary. When Frederick Douglass was asked in 1850 what he believed to be the best response to the Fugitive Slave Act, he replied, “A good revolver.” And Malcolm X advocated the same.\n\nThe Black Panthers, which never grew beyond a few thousand members, tried to combine socialism and black nationalism. Its charter called for full employment, decent housing, and the end of police brutality.\n\nUnlike black separatists, the Panthers welcomed all races and found wealthy liberals willing to give them money. But the group’s social programs — like a breakfast program for schoolchildren and clothing and food drives — came undone partly by the corruption of the leadership.\n\nHistorians have detailed its mistreatment of female members, extortion, drug dealing, embezzlement and murder. At least 19 Panthers were killed in shootouts with one another, the authorities or other black revolutionaries.\n\nWhile “by any means necessary” became a mantra of the group, J. Edgar Hoover’s F.B.I. also did whatever possible to target the Panthers. As many members went off to prison and the group dwindled, Newton became a despotic and paranoid drug addict, wielding dictatorial powers with a small coterie, and knocking off anyone in his way.\n\nWhile the Panthers’ time of influence ended quickly, Newton never escaped the organization. In 1980, he earned a Ph.D. in philosophy. But he was shot to death on Aug. 22, 1989, in a crack cocaine deal gone bad. He was 47, a victim of the same streets he had once tried to make safe.\n\nRead the obituary “Huey Newton Killed; Was a Co-Founder of Black Panthers ”\n\nRead the article “Huey Newton Symbolized the Rising Black Anger of a Generation”\n\nAlice Coachman, Who Won a Gold Medal but Came Home to Segregation\n\nDuring the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Not Forgotten is resurfacing obituaries about some of the greatest Olympic athletes of all time.\n\n“Go anyplace and people will tell you Wilma Rudolph was the first black woman to win a medal — it’s not true,” Alice Coachman said in 1997.\n\nCoachman was in a position to know. A very good position: 5 feet 6⅛ inches on her first attempt of the high jump at the 1948 Olympic Games in London.\n\nThat set an Olympic record and — because Coachman had achieved it on the first try — earned her the gold medal. Dorothy Tyler of Britain, who cleared 5-6⅛ on her second try, had to settle for silver.\n\nWhen Coachman died in 2014, at 90, the fact that she was the first black woman to win an Olympic gold medal was the salient point of her obituary in The New York Times.\n\nSixty-six years earlier, however, The Times had not even mentioned the fact in its dispatch from London. The correspondent, Allison Danzig, barely noted that Coachman had set a record. In fact, he cast her victory not as a triumph for American women but as a “disappointment” to Tyler’s British fans.\n\nCoachman attributed Rudolph’s pre-eminence in the public mind to the fact that the 1960 Olympics in Rome, where Rudolph won three gold medals, were televised. Viewers could see with their own eyes what newspaper reporters and radio commentators of earlier eras did not necessarily emphasize.\n\nCoachman was treated almost as a nonperson on her homecoming to Albany, Ga., forced to use a side door of the auditorium where she was being honored. The mayor refused to shake her hand.\n\nRacism is not the only explanation for Coachman’s relative invisibility until recent years, however. Some of it had to do with one of her gifts.\n\nModesty.\n\n“From the very first gold medal I won in 1939, my mama used to stress being humble,” Coachman told William C. Rhoden of The Times in 1995. “You’re no better than anyone else.”\n\nAnd Wembley Stadium in London was the end of the line.\n\n“I had accomplished what I wanted to do,” Coachman said in explaining why she retired as an athlete after the London Olympics. “It was time for me to start looking for a husband. That was the climax. I won the gold medal. I proved to my mother, my father, my coach and everybody else that I had gone to the end of my rope.”\n\nAt the Olympics, maybe. The truth is that her career as an exemplar was just beginning.\n\nRead the obituary “Alice Coachman, 90, Dies; First Black Woman to Win Olympic Gold ”\n\nBreaking Bread: Dominique Dawes and Mother Angelica\n\nIf you could have dinner with one person who is no longer with us, and whose obituary was published in The New York Times, who would it be, and why that person? Not Forgotten is asking that question of a variety of influential people this summer in a series of posts called Breaking Bread.\n\nToday we have Dominique Dawes, the first African-American female gymnast to win an individual medal. Nicknamed “Awesome Dawesome,” she went on to compete in three Olympics.\n\nIf I could choose to have dinner with somebody who has passed away, I would choose to dine with Mother Angelica.\n\nMother Angelica was the nun who founded the largest religious network, Eternal Word Television Network, starting with only $200. She is the only woman to have founded and led a cable network for over 20 years.\n\nI’d invite Mother Angelica to my home and have her sit at the head of our table, alongside my husband and two baby girls. The meal I’d cook would be soul food (I grew up on it), consisting of chitlins, collard greens, cheese grits and candied yams. Mother Angelica would understand this meal: She was raised around blacks and poor Italians in a tough Canton, Ohio, neighborhood. She knew people, she understood their plights, she was one of them!\n\nAnd she knew resilience most of all, raised by a single mother from an early age after her father had abandoned them.\n\nI’d ask her to say the blessing, then proceed to ask her a few things about her life and about fortitude. A priest once told me that it’s very difficult to have a relationship with your Heavenly Father after your earthly father has abandoned you. I often wondered how she overcame this abandonment, learned to forgive her father and ultimately trust in God?\n\nShe was a cloistered nun, in a convent, yet she was seen by hundreds of millions of people worldwide as the host of a series on EWTN. How was she able to embrace both of these so very opposite vocations? (I am an introvert by nature, and performing in front of millions during the Olympic Games gave me anxiety, as does speaking at events in front of thousands now.)\n\nOver dinner, I’d be fascinated to hear from Mother Angelica about how she channeled her own pain into a larger purpose. And I would ask her how I might help others, whether they suffer from anxiety, depression, addiction, physical ailments or the pain of abandonment or divorce. Her whole life, after all, was dedicated to helping others, especially the disenfranchised.\n\nMother Angelica, I would ask, how can we here on earth emulate what you did, even in a smaller way, offering help to others in a world that so desperately needs it?\n\nRead the obituary “Mother Mary Angelica, Who Founded Catholic TV Network, Dies at 92”\n\nBabe Ruth, the Slugger Who Went From Boyhood Chaos to Baseball Stardom\n\nThe Sultan of Swat. The Caliph of Clout. The Great Bambino. When baseball fans hear these monikers, nearly 70 years after Babe Ruth died on Aug. 16, 1948, they’re taken back to the golden age of baseball, when one charismatic player ruled the sport by smacking more home runs than entire teams, changing the game in the process.\n\nBut before Ruth tantalized fans with his prodigious power, he was practically helpless. From the time he was 7 years old, Ruth grew up in St. Mary’s Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage for children in Baltimore. He might have amounted to nothing without the help of one dedicated mentor.\n\nGeorge Herman Ruth Jr. was born in Baltimore on Feb. 6, 1895. His mother was the former Katherine Schamberger. He was a rambunctious child who routinely skipped school, drank and taunted local police officers around his home. He became so unruly that his parents sent him to St. Mary’s, a notoriously strict institution, although he pleaded with them not to.\n\nAt St. Mary’s, Ruth had to adhere to a grinding schedule of school, prayer and work, which left no time for carousing. His parents had signed over custodial rights to the school and essentially washed their hands of him, leaving Ruth alone and desperately in need of a father figure.\n\nThen he met Brother Matthias, a brawny, 6-foot-6 disciplinarian and assistant athletic director at St. Mary’s, who took to Ruth immediately. Matthias was widely credited with introducing Ruth to baseball. They spent hours together honing Ruth’s skills, both as a hitter and a left-handed pitcher.\n\n“It was at St. Mary’s that I met and learned to love the greatest man I’ve ever known,” Ruth wrote about Matthias in his 1948 autobiography, “The Babe Ruth Story.”\n\nRuth learned to play during the dead-ball era of the early 20th century, when hitters swung down on the ball, kept it inside the park and relied on speed as their greatest asset. Baseball was strategic, built on grounders, bunts and stolen bases instead of power.\n\nMatthias had a different approach. He belted majestic fly balls deep into the St. Mary’s outfield. The impressionable Ruth copied Matthias’s approach, which led to his unprecedented gift for hitting bombs.\n\nWord of Ruth’s talents spread, and Jack Dunn, owner of the minor league Baltimore Orioles, came to watch him play. Dunn was so impressed that he became Ruth’s legal guardian in order to sign the 19-year-old. On his arrival in the clubhouse, Orioles players referred to the burly Ruth as “Jack’s newest babe,” coining one of the great nicknames in American sports history.\n\nRuth’s career with the Orioles was short. That summer he was acquired by the Boston Red Sox, for whom he would win his first three championships as a pitcher and an outfielder.\n\nBut the Red Sox made a grave mistake when they sold Ruth to the rival New York Yankees in 1920. Many bleacher historians blame this error for the Red Sox’ 86-year championship drought — the so-called Curse of the Bambino.\n\nRuth played 15 seasons with the Bombers, amassing four more championships. His records include a .690 slugging percentage and 714 career home runs, a record that stood until Henry Aaron broke it on April 8, 1974.\n\nRuth’s place in baseball’s pantheon was apparent to anyone who saw him play. He was part of baseball’s first Hall of Fame class, in 1936, the year after he retired. An inveterate cigar smoker, he learned he had throat cancer a decade later and died from the disease on this day in 1948.\n\nHis Yankees teammate Joe Dugan probably summed up Ruth’s larger-than-life stature best, elevating it to myth: “To understand him you had to understand this: He wasn’t human.”\n\nRead the obituary “Babe Ruth, Baseball Idol, Dies at 53 After Lingering Illness”\n\nTeófilo Stevenson, Boxer Who Chose Country Over Wealth\n\nDuring the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Not Forgotten is resurfacing obituaries about some of the greatest Olympic athletes of all time. Before tonight’s gold medal heavyweight match, between Russia’s Evgeny Tishchenko and Kazakhstan’s Vassiliy Levit, we revisit one of Olympic boxing’s most talented pugilists.\n\nMost boxers battle for the title, money and acclaim. Teófilo Stevenson rejected all of that for his country.\n\nStevenson, who stood 6 feet 5 inches, weighed 220 pounds and battered opponents with a deft left jab and a sledgehammer straight right, won three consecutive Olympic heavyweight gold medals for Cuba, in 1972 in Munich, 1976 in Montreal and 1980 in Moscow.\n\nHis 1980 victory made him the first Olympic boxer to earn three consecutive gold medals in the same division. But he might have had a chance for another: Stevenson was still a tremendous fighter when Cuba boycotted the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. He won the last of his three amateur boxing world titles two years later at the age of 34.\n\nAfter his first two medals, boxing promoters were practically slavering at the potential ticket sales of a Cold War-era match between Stevenson, a product of Communist Cuba, and Muhammad Ali, who died in June at 74.\n\nBut athletes in Fidel Castro’s Cuba were not permitted to compete professionally, so Stevenson would have had to defect in order to fight Ali. He was not willing to do so, even though promoters promised him $1 million or more.\n\n“I will not leave my country for one million dollars or for much more than that,” Stevenson said in an article, headlined “He’d Rather Be Red Than Rich,” in Sports Illustrated in 1974. “What is a million dollars against eight million Cubans who love me?”\n\nAli told The New York Times in 1976 that he thought Stevenson was a promising amateur fighter but that he was probably not ready for the pros.\n\n“I saw him get a little tired in round three against the last guy he fought,” Ali said. “Imagine if he had to fight 15 hard rounds against bad people like me or George Foreman or Joe Frazier or Ken Norton, somebody who would put pressure on him.”\n\nAli said that Stevenson’s passing up such a lucrative payday was a big mistake.\n\n“He’s going to fight me, we’re workin’ on it.” Ali said. “He needs money. He’s real poor. If he’s offered $2 million and don’t take it, he’s a damn fool.”\n\nStevenson never took the bait. He had remained a promising amateur at his death, in Havana on June 11, 2012.\n\n(The next Olympic boxer to win three Olympic gold medals in the same weight class was Stevenson’s countryman, Felix Savon, who won the heavyweight medal from 1992 until 2000.)\n\n“I didn’t need the money because it was going to mess up my life,” Stevenson told The Chicago Tribune in 2003. “For professional boxers, the money is a trap. You make a lot of money, but how many boxers in history do we know that died poor? The money always goes into other people’s hands.”\n\nRead the obituary “Teófilo Stevenson, Cuban Boxing Great, Dies at 60”\n\nThe ‘Tryst With Destiny’ Speech That Divided India and Pakistan\n\nWhile the world was consumed with war in the first half of the 1940s, three men were subsumed with growing unrest across India, with the fates of tens of millions of their compatriots in their hands.\n\nThis day — a moment, really — in history belongs to these leaders: Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Muhammad Ali Jinnah.\n\nAt the stroke of midnight on Aug. 15, 1947, power over one-fifth of humanity was transferred from Britain to the newly independent countries of India and Pakistan. But there was a fatal flaw: There were no borders.\n\nIndians had struggled for decades to rid themselves of British rule, galvanized by the nonviolent movement led by Gandhi. Their efforts were kept in check by ruthless military force, but by the end of World War II, Britain lacked the will and the means to defeat the campaign. They reluctantly relinquished India after 200 years, leaving the country at the brink of implosion.\n\nGandhi, Nehru and Jinnah were divided on what should happen once the British left. Gandhi, more an idealist than a realist, wanted an undivided nation; he chose to remain out of government.\n\nThe British negotiated with the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, who believed that a separate state was the only way to protect the rights of Muslims, who were a minority; and the (mostly Hindu) Indian National Congress, led by Nehru, who grudgingly went along with the British decision to divide India on the basis of religion.\n\nCyril Radcliffe, who had never been to Asia, arrived in India 36 days before the date of the partition to draw the lines to split one of world’s largest and most ethnically diverse countries. On Aug. 9, he finished drawing the map, but the British viceroy, his superior, kept it a secret. He didn’t want the British to be blamed for any ensuing violence. But it prolonged the uncertainty for millions and very likely increased the loss of life to come.\n\nShortly before the clock struck midnight on Aug. 15, 1947, Nehru, Gandhi’s successor at the helm of the independence movement and India’s first prime minister, was inside Parliament in New Delhi delivering an address recognized as one of the greatest of the 20th century.\n\n“Long years ago, we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially,” he began.\n\nNearing the conclusion, he said, “There is no resting for any one of us till we redeem our pledge in full, till we make all the people of India what destiny intended them to be.”\n\nThose stirring words met the occasion, but had no effect on the swirling chaos on the ground as mobs sought on their own to determine the religious makeup of towns and villages. Communities that had lived together for centuries viciously turned on each other. The borders were announced two days after independence: Hindu-majority India flanked by Muslim-majority West Pakistan and East Pakistan.\n\nUp to 15 million people moved across the two borders in less than a year, one of the fastest mass migrations in history. Millions of Muslims fled India, most heading west. About the same number of Hindus and Sikhs went mostly east into the new India. About one million people were killed.\n\nOn Jan. 30, 1948, Gandhi, who remained the strongest advocate for peace, was assassinated by a Hindu extremist who opposed his ideology.\n\nGandhi’s death “left all India stunned and bewildered as to the direction that this newly independent nation would take without its ‘Mahatma’ (Great Teacher),” wrote The New York Times. Jinnah, who “brought about, almost single-handed, one of the most sweeping political transformations of the century in Asia,” The Times wrote, died the same year, on Sept. 11, 1948. Nehru ruled for 17 years and died on May 27, 1964.\n\nThose hastily drawn borders by the British became the focus of four wars and seven decades of animosity between India and Pakistan.

His gigs were always rife with frenetic, spot-on impersonations that included Hollywood stars, presidents, princes, prime ministers, popes and anonymous citizens of the world. His irreverence was legendary and uncurtailable.\n\nWe remember Williams with some of our favorite scenes and lines (some of which contain strong language), and encourage readers to do the same on Twitter using #tellnyt.\n\n“Mork and Mindy” — 1978 “NA-NUU, NA-NUU”\n\nWilliams broke through to mainstream audiences on this quirky sitcom, in which he played Mork from Ork, a sweet, goofy alien who befriends a young Colorado woman.\n\n“Good Morning, Vietnam” — 1987 “What is the demilitarized zone? Sounds like something from the ‘Wizard of Oz.’ Oh no, don’t go in there.”\n\nWilliams earned an Academy Award nomination for playing Adrian Cronauer, a chatty Armed Forces Radio host in Saigon in the 1960s. “This is the first role that calls upon me to do what I do best — me,” he said.\n\n“Aladdin” — 1992 “Rick ’em, rack ’em, rock ’em, rake! Stick that sword into that snake!”\n\nHe voiced an unforgettably zany blue genie in the 1992 Walt Disney feature.\n\n“Mrs. Doubtfire” — 1993 “Off your Mercedes, dear, you own that big expensive car out there? Oh, dear. Well, they say a man who has to buy a big car like that is trying to compensate for smaller genitals.”\n\nWilliams played an actor who cross-dressed as a British housekeeper to spend more time with his children in this 1993 family comedy.\n\n“Good Will Hunting” — 1997 “You’re an orphan, right? Do you think I know the first thing about how hard your life has been, how you feel, who you are, because I read ‘Oliver Twist?’ Does that encapsulate you?”\n\nWilliams’s Oscar-winning turn as a therapist working with a troubled prodigy, played by Matt Damon, offered him a rare serious role that took advantage of his wide-ranging talents.\n\n“Death to Smoochy” — 2002 “Even when you’re squeaky clean, you can still fall in the mud.”\n\nWilliams starred in this black comedy as Rainbow Randolph, a children’s TV show host who is fired for taking bribes and replaced by an upstanding performer played by Edward Norton.\n\nRead the obituary “Robin Williams, Oscar-Winning Comedian, Dies at 63”\n\nNo Matter the Game, Babe Didrikson Zaharias Played to Win\n\nDuring the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Not Forgotten is resurfacing obituaries about some of the greatest Olympic athletes of all time.\n\nBabe Didrikson preferred victory to humility. In 1933, after she had won three medals at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, she told The New York Times reporter Arthur J. Daley that there was no other woman “who rivals me very closely as an athlete.”\n\nDidrikson backed up her swagger; There was seemingly no sport she could not master. After her world record-breaking performance at the women’s track and field national championships in 1931, an article in The New York Times described her as a “feminine athletic marvel” who was as adept at “swimming, boxing, tennis, baseball and basketball as she is in track.”\n\nShe was born Mildred Ella Didriksen (she later changed the “e” to an “o”) on June 26, 1911, in Port Arthur, Tex., but went by Babe because, even as a youth, she could supposedly hit a baseball like Ruth.\n\nIn 1932, she competed at the Amateur Athletic Union’s national track and field championships, which, at the time, served as Olympic qualifiers. Some teams had as many as 22 athletes, but Didrikson performed solo in all of the events as a publicity stunt for her sponsor. She won five individual events, tied in a sixth and won the championships single-handed.\n\nAt the 1932 Games, Didrikson won gold medals in both the javelin throw and the high hurdles. In the high jump, she cleared 5 feet 5 inches, the same as gold medalist Jean Shiley. But she was disqualified on her final jump and awarded the silver medal after a judge ruled her technique had violated Olympic rules, even though the issue had not been raised in earlier rounds.\n\nThe fact that Didrikson won only three medals also deserves an asterisk. Women were limited to three Olympic track and field events in 1932, so Didrikson could possibly have won more had she been allowed to compete.\n\nDidrikson’s success at the Olympics had made her internationally famous, but by the time she died, on Sept. 27, 1956, she was also known as a champion golfer. She had only taken up the sport in 1935, but had tackled it with the same drive she brought to all of her athletic endeavors. She met her future husband, the professional wrestler George Zaharias, when they were paired to play golf together at a tournament. She took his surname when they married in 1938.\n\n“At least part of Mrs. Zaharias’ success could be attributed to her powers of concentration and diligence,” her obituary in The Times said. “When she decided to center her attention on golf, she tightened up her game by driving as many as 1,000 balls a day and playing until her hands were so sore, they had to be taped. She developed an aggressive, dramatic style, hitting down sharply and crisply on her iron shots like a man and averaging 240 yards off the tee with her woods.”\n\nAs an amateur golfer, Zaharias once won 14 tournaments in a row. She helped found the Ladies’ Professional Golf Association and won 31 tournaments on tour. She also won 10 majors, including victories at the women’s United States Open in 1948, 1950 and 1954.\n\nZaharias beat Betty Hicks by 12 strokes in the 1954 United States Open, an astonishing margin considering that Zaharias had been treated for colon cancer in 1953 and had undergone a colostomy.\n\nZaharias became a spokeswoman for cancer awareness and toured for as long as she could, but the disease returned. She died from it in September 1956.\n\n“I think that every one of us feels sad that finally she had to lose this last one of all her battles,” President Dwight D. Eisenhower said at the time.\n\nThe Associated Press named Zaharias the Woman Athlete of the Year six times and the World’s Greatest Woman Athlete of the First Half of the 20th Century. Sports Illustrated lauded her as the woman Athlete of the 20th Century in individual sports. These accolades came decades after the sportswriter Grantland Rice first called her “Wonder Girl.”\n\nBut the comedian Bob Hope may have expressed Zaharias’s talents best with a self-deprecating comment he made when they played in a charity tournament together.\n\n“I hit the ball like a girl,” Hope said, “and she hits it like a man.”\n\nRead the obituary “Babe Zaharias Dies; Athlete Had Cancer”\n\nJesse Owens: A Chilly Reception in Nazi Germany, Then Olympic Glory\n\nDuring the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Not Forgotten is resurfacing obituaries about some of the greatest Olympic athletes of all time.\n\nA few seconds, perhaps a fraction of a second, can mean the difference between victory and defeat, between becoming a legend or leaving as a footnote.\n\n“People come out to see you perform, and you’ve got to give them the best you have within you,” the great track and field star Jesse Owens once said. “A lifetime of training, for just 10 seconds.”\n\nYet that lifetime of training, which propelled Owens into the history books with his performance in the 1936 Games in Berlin, seemed for a time as if it might be of little use. With the rise of Nazi Germany roiling Europe, the Amateur Athletic Union remained divided in 1935 over whether to allow American athletes to compete in Berlin; it ultimately approved their participation, but only by a narrow vote.\n\n“I wanted no part of politics,” Owens said. “And I wasn’t in Berlin to compete against any one athlete. The purpose of the Olympics, anyway, was to do your best.\n\nThe A.A.U. wasn’t the only organization involved in a moral tug of war over the Olympics. Owens, who was black, was encouraged by some civil rights groups to boycott the games. After deciding to go, he found a chilly reception in Germany, where claims of Aryan supremacy were central to Nazi ideology. He was called racial epithets and subjected to other mistreatment.\n\nTo the dismay of Hitler and the Nazis, Owens went on to win four gold medals — in the long jump, 100-meter dash, the 200-meter dash and the 4x100 meter relay — more than any other American track and field athlete in a single Olympic Games. His long jump record, of 8.13 meters, would not be surpassed for 25 years.\n\n“I had jumped into another rare kind of stratosphere — one that only a handful of people in every generation are lucky enough to know,” Owens said of his accomplishments.\n\nThe son of a sharecropper and grandson of a slave, James Cleveland Owens was born on Sept. 12, 1913, in Alabama and moved with his family as child to Cleveland. Sickly in his youth, he went by the nickname J.C., and a teacher’s misunderstanding during a roll call would lead to his being called Jesse for the rest of his life.\n\nOwens broke records at the junior high school, high school and collegiate level in the 1920s and ‘30s. But it was his time at Ohio State University that proved crucial in his development.\n\nFor all his record-breaking Olympic success overseas, his return home was sobering. President Franklin D. Roosevelt didn’t acknowledge his achievements, a snub that stung Owens. Unlike modern-day athletes who can be paid handsomely through endorsements and other commercial deals, Owens had to take myriad jobs to support his family. He later became a motivational speaker and public relations representative.\n\nIn 1976, President Gerald R. Ford awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor given to civilians in the United States. Owens died from complications related to lung cancer on March 31, 1980.\n\nSeveral movies have been made about his life, including this year’s “Race,” starring Stephan James. In a review of the film, which he called “studiously uplifting,” Stephen Holden wrote in The Times, “Long before television elevated black sports heroes into gods, there were athletes like Jesse Owens who paved the way.”\n\nIn Rio, the heirs of Owens, like Usain Bolt of Jamaica and Allyson Felix of the United States, are looking to carve their own names in Olympic history, propelled by the chance for glory, pride for country and perhaps, as Owens had expressed, a simple love for the sport.\n\n“I always loved running — it was something you could do by yourself and under your own power,” he said. “You could go in any direction, fast or slow as you wanted, fighting the wind if you felt like it, seeking out new sights just on the strength of your feet and the courage of your lungs.”\n\nRead the obituary “Jesse Owens Dies of Cancer at 66”\n\nAdam Yauch, Who, With His Bandmates the Beastie Boys, Made Hip-Hop Mainstream\n\nFor the nearly 30 years that Adam Yauch’s scratchy voice blared through boomboxes, and later earbuds, he and his hip-hop group, the Beastie Boys, changed the face of music. And four years after Yauch’s death at age 47, they can’t, they won’t and they don’t stop having an influence on their beloved city: New York.\n\nYauch, known as MCA, was born 52 years ago on this day in Brooklyn. He was a “New York kid” with “just enough crazy,” according to his longtime bandmate Adam Horovitz (Ad-Rock), and hung out at Palmetto Playground (renamed Adam Yauch Park) in Brooklyn Heights. He attended Edward R. Murrow High School in the borough’s Midwood neighborhood and spent two years at Bard College in the early 1980s.\n\n“Man, living at home is such a drag/Now your mom threw away your best porno mag (Busted!)/You gotta fight for your right to party”\n\nIn 1983, Yauch’s hard-core punk band, which also included Michael Diamond (Mike D), morphed into an unlikely hip-hop trio: white Brooklynites rapping about girls, vandalism and, of course, their right to party. The Beastie Boys’ slapstick was “greeted by some hip-hop purists as a novelty act,” Jon Pareles, the New York Times music critic, wrote after Yauch’s death. “They were Jewish bohemians, not ghetto survivors; they were jokers, not battlers.”\n\nTheir album “Licensed to Ill” (1986) exposed suburban fans of rock radio to hip-hop. It became the first hip-hop album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard chart, and its hit song “No Sleep Till Brooklyn” became a popular slogan that echoed from radios and appeared on T-shirts across New York.\n\nBorn and bred in Brooklyn the U.S.A./They call me Adam Yauch but I’m M.C.A.\n\nThree years later, the album “Paul’s Boutique” became a hip-hop staple: a “seamless set of provocative samples and rhymes — a rap opera, if you will,” Rolling Stone magazine said at the time.\n\nThe Beastie Boys’ rhymes never became too serious, but they did mature. Yauch became a supporter of feminism and a practicing Buddhist, creating the Milarepa Fund to support Tibetan independence from China. A series of Tibetan Freedom Concerts raised awareness for his cause.\n\nI want to say a little something that’s long overdue/The disrespect to women has got to be through\n\nYauch (pronounced “yowk”) also spoke out against any backlash against Islam in 1998, long before talk of a Muslim immigration ban. “I think that another thing America needs to think about is our racism, racism that comes from the United States towards Muslim people and towards Arabic people,” he said, adding, “The United States has to start respecting people in the Middle East.”\n\nIn 2004, the Beastie Boys offered a post-Sept. 11 tribute to their city with the album “To the Five Boroughs.”\n\nOffstage, Yauch, Horovitz and Diamond were businessmen, too. In 1992, they started Grand Royal, their label and magazine. Yauch also directed many of the Beastie Boys’ music videos and started Oscilloscope Laboratories in New York to produce and distribute independent films.\n\n“I burn the competition like a flame thrower/My rhymes they age like wine as I get older”\n\nIn his 40s, Yauch missed the Beastie Boys’ 2012 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: He had received a diagnosis of salivary gland cancer three years before and remained too ill to attend. He died on May 4, 2012, but was still able to record “Hot Sauce Committee Part Two,” a 2011 album that fittingly references the 1980s New York that gave rise to Yauch and his band of pranksters-turned-legends.\n\nRead the obituary “Rapper Conquered Music World in ’80s With Beastie Boys”\n\nSprung From Poverty, the Tales of Hans Christian Andersen Endure\n\nHans Christian Andersen, whose fairy tales endure more than a century after his death on this day in 1875, had a childhood as difficult as those of his plucky protagonists.\n\nBorn on April 2, 1805, in Odense, Denmark, Andersen grew up in stark poverty, but his father, a shoemaker, cultivated his imagination.\n\n“On Sundays he made me panoramas, theatres, and transformation pictures, and he would read me pieces out of Holberg’s plays and stories from the ‘Thousand and One Nights,’” Andersen was quoted as saying in his obituary in The New York Times. “And those were the only moments in which I remember him as looking really cheerful, for in his position as an artisan he did not feel happy.”\n\nAndersen found beauty in his humble surroundings.\n\n“A single little room, its floor space almost completely taken up by the shoemaker’s workbench, the bed, and the turn-up bench on which I slept, comprised my childhood home,” he wrote in his autobiography, translated as “The Fairy Tale of My Life.” “But the walls were covered with pictures, on the chest of drawers there stood beautiful cups, glasses, and knickknacks, and above the workbench, by the window, there was a shelf with books and songs.”\n\nAndersen was a solitary child who spent most of his time making costumes for puppets and enacting plays on a model stage his father had built for him. He headed for Copenhagen when he was just a teenager.\n\nHis first play was soon produced by a theater there, and he went on to write poems, novels and, of course, children’s stories.\n\nThe hovels of Andersen’s childhood were far behind him, but he retained his gift for spinning magic from the mundane. Many of his stories featured children who persevered in the face of ridicule, ignorance and evil.\n\nVersions of his tales, which include “The Ugly Duckling,” “The Emperor’s New Clothes” and “The Princess and the Pea,” remain childhood favorites. Other yarns inspired films like “The Little Mermaid,” “Thumbelina” and “Frozen,” which was originally and very loosely based on the stories he collectively titled “The Snow Queen.”\n\nIn time, Andersen became famous and traveled around Europe, meeting celebrities like Charles Dickens. So the opening line of his autobiography is hardly hyperbolic.\n\n“My life is a lovely story,” he wrote, “happy and full of incident.”\n\nRead the obituary “Hans Christian Andersen”\n\nHenri Cartier-Bresson, Whose “Decisive Moment” Shaped Modern Photography\n\nWhen Henri Cartier-Bresson first picked up a tiny Leica 35mm film camera in 1931, he began a visual journey that would revolutionize 20th-century photography.\n\nHis camera could be wielded so discreetly that it enabled him to photograph while being virtually unseen by others — a near invisibility that turned photojournalism into a primary source of information and photography into a recognized art form.\n\nCartier-Bresson’s concept of the “decisive moment” — a split second that reveals the larger truth of a situation — shaped modern street photography and set the stage for hundreds of photojournalists to bring the world into living rooms through magazines such as Life and Look. In 1947, he and Robert Capa helped create the photographer-owned cooperative photo agency Magnum.\n\nThough he often focused on the human condition in his photographs, Cartier-Besson would often look at his contact sheets or prints upside down to judge the images separate from any social content. They stood as rigorous compositions on their own.\n\nHis signature shooting technique was to find a visually arresting setting for a photograph and then patiently wait for that decisive moment to unfurl. In his obituary in The New York Times in 2004 — Cartier-Bresson had died on Aug. 3 — the critic Michael Kimmelman noted that Cartier-Bresson was equally adept at responding instantly to changing circumstance.\n\n“Photographers and others who saw him work talked about his swift and nimble ability to snap a picture undetected,” he wrote. “(Sometimes he even masked the shiny metal parts of his camera with black tape.) They also admired his coolness under pressure. The director Louis Malle remembered that, despite all the turmoil at the peak of the student protests in Paris in May 1968, Mr. Cartier-Bresson took photographs at the rate of only about four an hour.”\n\nWith the primacy of digital photography and social media in the 21st century, slow, painstaking image-making is becoming a relic. Photographers and their images now move at a pace as fast as the events swirling around them. Technological advances in cameras and methods of distribution have heralded in a new visual era, not unlike what Cartier-Bresson’s Leica did almost a century ago.\n\nPhotographs are no longer rare artifacts, nor primarily a means of learning about the exotic or unknown. They arrive instantaneously on our phones every day from every corner of the world and from all kinds of people. With a smart phone, everyone is a photographer, and images compete for crowd approval on social media channels like Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook.\n\nWhich raises questions on this anniversary of Cartier-Bresson’s death: Do these changes make a master’s carefully constructed images irrelevant? Or are they even more instructive today?

The Times wrote in his obituary on Dec. 1, 1987:\n\nMr. Baldwin’s prose, with its apocalyptic tone — a legacy of his early exposure to religious fundamentalism — and its passionate yet distanced sense of advocacy, seemed perfect for a period in which blacks in the South lived under continual threat of racial violence and in which civil-rights workers faced brutal beatings and even death.\n\nHere are some of his most prescient lines:\n\nI imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.\n\nWhat is ghastly and really almost hopeless in our racial situation now is that the crimes we have committed are so great and so unspeakable that the acceptance of this knowledge would lead, literally, to madness. The human being, then, in order to protect himself, closes his eyes, compulsively repeats his crimes, and enters a spiritual darkness which no one can describe.\n\nOnly white Americans can consider themselves to be expatriates. Once I found myself on the other side of the ocean, I could see where I came from very clearly, and I could see that I carried myself, which is my home, with me. You can never escape that. I am the grandson of a slave, and I am a writer. I must deal with both.\n\nI was a maverick, a maverick in the sense that I depended on neither the white world nor the black world. That was the only way I could’ve played it. I would’ve been broken otherwise. I had to say, ‘A curse on both your houses.’ The fact that I went to Europe so early is probably what saved me. It gave me another touchstone — myself.\n\nRead the obituary “James Baldwin, Eloquent Writer In Behalf of Civil Rights, Is Dead”\n\nRead the article “If Black English Isn’t a Language, Then Tell Me, What Is?”\n\nAlexander Graham Bell, Who Sparked a New Era of Communication\n\nOn March 10, 1876, Professor Alexander Graham Bell stood in a Boston boarding house holding a receiving device connected to a series of wires that ran into an adjacent room. There, his assistant, Thomas A. Watson, waited patiently, clutching another receiver to his ear.\n\nBell spoke into his end of the contraption, and Watson heard his voice in the receiver: “Mr. Watson! Come here! I want—!”\n\nWatson dashed into the adjoining room gasping: “I heard you! I heard you!”\n\nFrom that experiment using just a few feet of wire would grow an industry that would transform the world. Through the likes of the American Bell Telephone Company and its successor, AT&T (known colloquially as Ma Bell), what was once Bell’s “toy” became a communications goliath made up of billions of dollars’ worth of infrastructure carrying tens of millions of calls every day.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell — who died at 75 on this day in 1922 at his estate in Nova Scotia in Canada — was fascinated by speech, sound and communication from a very young age. He was born on March 3, 1847, in Edinburgh, Scotland, to Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds Bell, who was deaf. He was homeschooled by his father, a phoneticist and the developer of Visible Speech, a series of symbols designed to aid the deaf in oration\n\nBell moved to Boston in the early 1870s and there used methods that he had learned from his father to teach deaf students. His techniques proved so useful that he eventually taught them to others as a professor at the Boston University School of Oratory.\n\nDuring these years he continued his research into sound at the university, experimenting with electricity. He hired Watson, an electrical designer and mechanic, for his electrical expertise. Soon they were collaborating on acoustic telegraphy, hoping to transmit a human voice by means of pulses along a telegraph wire.\n\nBell was granted a patent for the telephone — No. 174,465 — on March 7, 1876. An “Improvement in Telegraphy,” the documents stated. The patent, however, proved controversial from the start.\n\nEven though Bell is known as the father of telephony, his claim as its inventor has been challenged repeatedly in hundreds of legal cases, some of which have appeared before the United States Supreme Court. Throughout, though, Bell’s patent was upheld.\n\n“I may perhaps take credit for having blazed a trail for others who came after me,” Bell, who was humble by nature, once said, “but when I look at the phenomenal developments of the telephone and at the great system that bears my name, I feel that the credit for these developments is due to others rather than myself.”\n\nHe would go on to undertake important work in fields such as hydrofoils and aeronautics; make early advances in the creation of the metal detector; and develop a wireless telephone, called the photophone.\n\nSummarizing the part Bell had played in the building of an increasingly interconnected society, The New York Times in 1947, to signify the 100th anniversary of Bell’s birth, asked readers to jump back and put themselves in the shoes of a mid-1800s parent encouraging a child to imagine the possibilities that might lie ahead.\n\n“If in the middle of the last century,” The Times said, “our fathers had read to their children a tale about a charming princess who summoned an equally charming prince to her rescue over a copper wire with the aid of some wonderful lamps in which magical filaments glowed, there would have been cries of admiration. Well, fairy tales have a way of coming true in science and invention. And Bell’s telephone is one of them.”\n\nRead the obituary “Dr. Bell, Inventor of Telephone, Dies”\n\nYves Saint Laurent, Who Changed the Color of Couture\n\nI often wonder what Yves Saint Laurent, who was born on this day in 1936, would think of the modern fashion world.\n\nThis is in part because his name has been in the news recently, given the upheaval at the brand he built, where yet another creative director will debut a newish vision for the label next month.\n\nBut it’s also because many of the issues currently front and center — not just in fashion but also in the wider conversation about the social contract — were causes that he championed. In fact, he never saw them as causes per se, but rather as simply part of the definition of what it meant to be modern.\n\nDiversity? Saint Laurent was among the first designers to embrace black models on the runway, claiming such women as Iman, Katoucha Niane and Dalma Callado as his muses. Naomi Campbell credits him with getting her her first French Vogue cover.\n\nYet every season, we still seem to have the same discussion about the color myopia of the industry.\n\nThe power of pantsuits? He understood what they could mean for women back in 1966, when he unveiled his first Le Smoking: a tuxedo for women worn with a ruffled white shirt and a satin cummerbund. The idea shocked the world then. The New York socialite Nan Kempner was turned away from Le Cote Basque for wearing hers, only to return having divested herself of the trousers and wearing the jacket as a mini-dress. (That was, somehow, more acceptable to the management.)\n\nBut trouser suits were the dress of choice at the just-concluded Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, and wearing them Hillary Clinton has built the second stage of her public life, taking Saint Laurent’s vision beyond fashion history to history, full stop.\n\nThe democratization of fashion? Saint Laurent popularized the idea of high fashion ready-to-wear, introducing Rive Gauche, his Left Bank boutique and off-the-rack collection, in 1966. He was the first couturier to make his clothes available to consumers beyond the gilded doors of the haute salons. Now e-commerce has moved the dial even further, and for the first time this season three designers (Tom Ford, Tommy Hilfiger and Burberry) will be showing clothes that can be bought the next day, instead of six months down the line.\n\nSo maybe Mr. Saint Laurent, who died on June 1, 2008, would be rolling his eyes. Maybe he would be laughing. Probably he would be both frustrated and proud: at how far we’ve come, and how much further we have to go.\n\nRead the article “Yves Saint Laurent, Giant of Couture, Dies at 71”\n\nOtto Hahn, the Nobel-Winning Chemist Whose Discovery Was Used in Hiroshima\n\n“A new phenomenon in physics” that could generate 200 million volts of energy was reported in a wire service dispatch on Page 2 of The New York Times on Jan. 29, 1939. Otto Hahn, the paper reported, had discovered that the uranium atom could be split, a conclusion, he acknowledged, that “violated all previous experience in the field of nuclear physics.”\n\nBut the breathtaking disclosure was delivered with a major caveat: The practical application of the discovery, if any, would take 25 years.\n\nThat prediction, as it turned out, was off by a long shot. Less than seven years later, as a direct result of Hahn’s discovery, the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan to end World War II.\n\nWhen Hahn died in Germany on July 28, 1968, his Times obituary was featured on Page 1. By then, the significance of the Nobel Prize-winning chemist’s original finding was well established: He had, the article said, “discovered that the atom could be split, paving the way for the nuclear bomb” in a “discovery that changed the course of 20th-century history.”\n\nHahn made his discovery in his laboratory at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, working with his assistant, Fritz Strassmann. (Strassman’s predecessor, Lise Meitner, had been fired by the institute because she was Jewish. Hahn said after the war that he had opposed Nazism.)\n\nBut the process of splitting the uranium-235 atom would not be labeled nuclear fission until later, and Hahn himself, as a chemist rather than a physicist, initially described his discovery in the most equivocal terms.\n\nBy May 1940, it had become clear why scientists were reluctant to discuss the atom-splitting and the energy it released — a development they “regarded as ushering in the long dreamed of age of atomic power, and, therefore, as one of the greatest if not the greatest discovery in modern science,” the reporter William Laurence wrote in The Times.\n\nThe main reason they were silent, Laurence explained, was “the tremendous implications this discovery bears on the possible outcome of the European war,” which by then had already begun.\n\nHahn later said that he had never believed that his discovery would have military implications. “I am a scientist,” he said, “and like all scientists am interested only in discovery and not application.”\n\nHe later became an antiwar activist who opposed nuclear proliferation and expressed his fears in this rhyme:\n\nTo smash the simple atom\n\nAll mankind was intent\n\nNow any day\n\nThe atom may\n\nReturn the compliment.\n\nRead the obituary “Otto Hahn, Nobel Winner, Dies”\n\nGeorge Gallup, Pollster Who Found the Pulse of Democracy\n\nAmerican elections — and the American electorate — grow more complex and confounding every campaign cycle. This year’s presidential contest, featuring one of the most experienced politicians ever to seek the White House and a showman who has never served a day in the military or elected office, has befuddled even the most experienced observers.\n\nGeorge H. Gallup, one of the founders of public opinion research, would have reveled in the challenges presented by the personalities — the two most unpopular major party candidates to win their parties’ nominations — and by the seemingly contradictory views of the public about the state of the nation.\n\nMr. Gallup, who died 32 years ago this week at age 82, could not, and probably would not, tell you who he thought would win in November. But he could tell you what forces were driving public opinion, from fear of crime and terrorism to a widespread unease about rapid cultural and demographic changes.\n\nAnd he most certainly would have pointed out the flaws in a presidential primary system that produced two candidates with such high negative ratings and so many voters in despair.\n\n“Dr. Gallup had a major conviction that the whole election process in the nation was way off on a wrong track, and he argued that the people wanted major reforms — including abolishing the Electoral College, a single national primary, confining campaigning to a month or two in the fall, and national funding of the campaign,” Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Organization, wrote in an email. “He no doubt would be feeling ever more strongly about these convictions in today’s environment.”\n\nMr. Gallup, an Iowan with a commanding presence and a bone-crushing grip, would also undoubtedly have strong feelings about the profound changes roiling the polling industry. His organization pioneered many of the advances in measuring public opinion, including use of the telephone rather than mail or face-to-face interviews. That technology is now under scrutiny, as more and more pollsters are turning to the internet and mobile devices to conduct surveys. (Gallup and The New York Times rely almost exclusively on telephone polling, but are experimenting with reaching the public in other ways.)\n\nLast year Gallup announced that it would not conduct so-called horse race polls (“If the election were held today, … ?”) this election cycle. A Gallup poll famously predicted that Thomas E. Dewey would defeat Harry S. Truman in 1948, and the firm’s final poll in 2012 badly overestimated Mitt Romney’s share of the vote. The company instead is now focusing on the mood of the public, taking, as Mr. Gallup called it in one of his book titles, “The Pulse of Democracy.”\n\nRead the obituary “George H. Gallup Is Dead at 82; Pioneer in Public Opinion Polling”\n\nRead the article “The Man Who Made Polling What It Is”\n\nDorothy Rodham, the Iron Will Behind Hillary Clinton\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton formally clinches the Democratic presidential nomination this week in front of television cameras and a crowd of thousands, one vital influence will be conspicuously absent: her mother, Dorothy Rodham, whose quintessentially American story of resilience is woven into the fabric of her candidacy.\n\n“No one had a bigger influence on my life or did more to shape the person I became,” Mrs. Clinton wrote in her 2014 memoir, “Hard Choices.”\n\nWhen she claimed victory over Senator Bernie Sanders in the race for the nomination, she invoked her mother again, saying, “I wish she could see her daughter become the Democratic Party’s nominee.”\n\nMrs. Clinton’s mother, the former Dorothy Emma Howell, was born on June 4, 1919, into poverty and neglect on the same day that Congress passed the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. (It was sent to states for ratification and took effect 14 months later.)\n\nDorothy’s parents fought violently in the house in Chicago that they shared with four other families. Her father, a firefighter, was granted a divorce and custody of the two children after Dorothy’s mother never showed up in court to fight accusations of abandonment and abuse. Dorothy and her little sister were sent on a cross-country train to live with their grandparents in California. Dorothy was 8, her sister was 3.\n\nTheir grandmother was old-fashioned and strict. She preferred black Victorian dress and tolerated no disobedience — Dorothy was not allowed to attend parties or have visitors. After she went trick-or-treating one Halloween, she was confined to her bedroom for a year, let out only to go to school.\n\nAt 14, Dorothy escaped her grandmother’s strict domain for the unforgiving America of the Great Depression. She cooked, cleaned and nannied for a family in San Gabriel, Calif., in exchange for room, board and $3 a week. She lived in near abject poverty, but in that household Dorothy learned what family was.\n\nWith her adopted family’s support and help from influential teachers, she eventually graduated from high school. Mrs. Clinton would later reflect on the small acts of kindness that helped her mother survive, like the teacher in elementary school who noticed that Dorothy couldn’t afford milk. The teacher brought an extra carton of milk every day, then asked: “Dorothy, I can’t drink this other carton of milk. Would you like it?’”\n\nAfter graduating in 1937, Dorothy was lured back to Chicago by her mother, who told her that her new husband would pay for Dorothy’s tuition at Northwestern University. But her mother lied: She brought Dorothy back to work as a housekeeper. Heartbroken, Dorothy eventually found secretarial work.\n\n“I’d hoped so hard that my mother would love me that I had to take the chance and find out,” Dorothy told her daughter when asked why she returned home. “When she didn’t, I had nowhere else to go.”\n\nIn 1942, Dorothy married Hugh Ellsworth Rodham, a conservative Republican who operated a small drapery business. They raised three children — Hillary Diane, Hugh Jr. and Tony — in the leafy suburb of Park Ridge, Ill. Mr. Rodham exerted a tough influence on his daughter while passing on to her his distinctively boisterous laugh — one that could “turn heads in a restaurant and send cats running from the room,” she wrote.\n\nDorothy Rodham raised her daughter to stand her ground and hit back if necessary, Mrs. Clinton wrote. In 1965, after Hillary Rodham had entered Wellesley College as a civic-minded Republican and had become plagued by doubts about remaining there, her mother bucked her up. “You can’t quit,” she quoted her mother as saying. “You’ve got to see through what you’ve started.”\n\nThe war in Vietnam and the turmoil of the civil rights movement led Mrs. Clinton to undergo a political transformation. She graduated as an antiwar Democrat.\n\nDuring her unsuccessful 2008 campaign for the presidential nomination, Mrs. Clinton was fiercely protective of her mother’s privacy. In the 2016 race, she has made her mother’s struggle part of the emotional core of her campaign.\n\nLater in life, Dorothy Rodham resumed her education by taking college courses. She died on Nov. 1, 2011, while her daughter was secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton wrote:\n\nMom measured her own life by how much she was able to help us and serve others. I knew if she was still with us, she would be urging us to do the same. Never rest on your laurels. Never quit. Never stop working to make the world a better place. That’s our unfinished business.\n\nRead the obituary “Dorothy Rodham, Mother and Mentor of Hillary Clinton, Is Dead at 92”\n\nLong Before Muhammad Ali, Another Cassius Clay Was Larger Than LIfe\n\nThis is the story of Cassius Marcellus Clay — not that Cassius Clay, the heavyweight fighter and luminous worldwide presence best known as Muhammad Ali.\n\nThis story is about the original Cassius Clay: the 19th-century scion of a slaveholding family who became a belligerent emancipationist, globe-trotting statesman, unsparing duelist, early Republican and larger-than-life American eccentric.\n\nIt was for that Cassius Clay, who died on July 22, 1903, at the Kentucky plantation house where he had been born 92 years earlier, that Ali’s father and, by extension, Ali himself were named.\n\nA firebrand publisher, Yale-educated lawyer, Kentucky state legislator, major general in the Union Army, survivor of multiple assassination attempts and the United States minister to Russia under Presidents Lincoln and Johnson, General Clay was as well known for his private activities as for his public ones.\n\nHis obituary in The New York Times, published on July 23, 1903, is remarkable for a level of catty candor rarely seen in American news obituaries of the era — traditionally staid, reverential documents — and, very likely, of any era.\n\n“He was found desperately ill, and has had every care,” the opening paragraph reads. “His children, long estranged by reason of his eccentricities, were again able to be with him, and were at the bedside when death ensued.”\n\nThings get more delicious from there.\n\nThere was General Clay’s prolific dueling, which left him with a tangle of scars on his face and body but left his opponents far worse off: He was said to have slain more men in duels than anyone else in the country.\n\nOn one occasion, caught without his pistol, General Clay was shot above the heart by a would-be assassin. He forestalled further ado by slicing off the assailant’s nose and ears with a Bowie knife.\n\nThen there was General Clay’s precipitate divorce from his first wife of 45 years, Mary Jane Warfield, and his equally precipitate second marriage — made, he insisted, on populist political grounds — to a 15-year-old servant girl. He was 84 at the time.\n\n“In 1837 he had married his first wife, Miss Warfield, a member of an aristocratic family of slave holders,” the Times obituary said. “Years afterward, when he had become an ardent disciple of Tolstoï, he came to the conclusion that he ought to wed a ‘daughter of the people.’ ”\n\nAnd so he did, taking Dora Richardson as his bride in 1894. “Gen. Clay Weds Pretty Dora,” a headline in The Times proclaimed. “His Children Were Unable to Prevent Their Aged Parent’s Marriage.”\n\nYoung Dora, who evidently had little say in the matter of her betrothal, did not take kindly to being yoked to a man more than five times her age. She ran away repeatedly from home and from the boarding school to which her husband sent her.\n\n“The fact that he supplied her with the most beautiful French gowns and lavished money upon her, she did not consider compensation for the teasing she got at the hands of her fellow-pupils,” The Times said. “In two months he had to take her back home, still uneducated.”\n\nAfter four years of Dora’s comings and goings, which were avidly covered in the newspapers, General Clay divorced her.\n\nShe remarried “a worthless young mountaineer,” The Times reported, but after he was killed in a railway accident, the general tried vigorously to win back “his peasant wife,” as he fondly called her.\n\nIn this endeavor, unlike most others, he did not succeed.\n\nThe youngest son of Gen. Green Clay and the former Sally Lewis, Cassius Marcellus Clay was born on Oct. 19, 1810, at White Hall, his family’s mansion near Richmond, Ky.\n\nHis father (1757-1828) had been a hero of the Revolutionary War and was a general in the War of 1812; Henry Clay, the United States senator and statesman, was a cousin. Both of Cassius’ parents were from the Southern landed gentry, making the family among the wealthiest landowners in the state.\n\nAt Yale, Cassius Clay heard a speech by the famed abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison and was converted to the cause. Returning home after earning a law degree in 1832, he established a practice in Lexington, served three terms in the Kentucky General Assembly and was a captain in the 1st Kentucky Cavalry in the Mexican War.\n\nIn 1844, he freed his own slaves and the next year started The True American, an emancipationist newspaper published in Lexington.\n\nHis proposals for gradually ending slavery, which he also promulgated in public lectures, did not go over well in Kentucky. He kept a cannon on hand to protect the newspaper office from looming mobs and weathered several more attempts on his life.\n\nGeneral Clay, who in the 1850s helped establish the Republican Party, was a friend and staunch supporter of Abraham Lincoln. After the outbreak of the Civil War, he organized the Cassius M. Clay Battalion, a corps of several hundred volunteers charged with protecting the White House.\n\nIn 1861, Lincoln appointed him minister to Russia, a post he held through the following year and again from 1863 to 1869. Dispatched to St. Petersburg, General Clay was instrumental in brokering the deal that in 1867 let the United States purchase Alaska.\n\nThe general’s later life was a sorry state of affairs. Barricaded in White Hall with a veritable arsenal beside him, he pined for the faithless Dora and worried obsessively that enemies, real and imagined, were coming to kill him.\n\n“Gen. Clay May Be Insane,” a headline in The Times declared on July 4, 1903, followed, five days later, by the more definitive “Gen. Clay Decreed Insane.”\n\n“Though his sight became so much impaired that he could not shoot any longer,” The Times reported in his obituary, “he kept plenty of firearms at his elbow, and kept trained from a porthole in the wall the same brass cannon he had caused to be built to protect his printing office.”\n\nBut the vital legacy of General Clay’s early life has endured down the years. He fathered a string of children — as many as 10 in some estimates — most with his first wife, although at least one with a St. Petersburg mistress. Two daughters, Mary Barr Clay (1839-1924) and Laura Clay (1849-1941), became leaders of the women’s suffrage movement.\n\nIn 1853, he donated the land for what became Berea College in Berea, Ky. Established two years later, it was the first interracial and coeducational college in the South, open to blacks and to women from its inception.\n\nGeneral Clay was buried in Richmond Cemetery, in Richmond, Ky., and his funeral was newsworthy for the racially mixed crowd in attendance.\n\n“Never was a more striking scene witnessed on the way to Richmond, where the funeral services were to be held,” a contemporary newspaper account read. “From every humble Negro cottage along the roadside and at every cross roads, the mothers and large children carrying those who were too little to walk, the Negroes were lined up to pay their last respects to the man whom they honored as the Abraham Lincoln of Kentucky.”\n\nIn the end, then, its garrulous chronicle of its subject’s peccadilloes notwithstanding, the obituary of Cassius Marcellus Clay is every inch a requiem for a heavyweight.\n\nRead the obituary “Cassius M. Clay Dead”\n\nWhen Men First Walked on the Moon: A Moment Relived\n\nJuly 20,1969 — a date that lives in my memory as the great divide, the B.C. to A.D., in my journalism career. It was the day of the first walk on the moon by humans, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, and I covered the event for The Times from mission control in Houston.\n\nI began my front-page article with a sentence as simple as it was astonishing:\n\nMen have landed and walked on the moon.\n\nTwo Americans, astronauts of Apollo 11, steered their fragile four-legged lunar module safely and smoothly to the historic landing yesterday at 4:17:40 P.M., Eastern daylight time.\n\nNeil A. Armstrong, the 38-year-old civilian commander, radioed to earth and the mission control room here:\n\n“Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.”\n\nJust think, the 50th anniversary of the first moon walk is only three years away. Although I am now 82, my doctors seem to think I have a good chance of still being around for it. I doubt I will be up to the dawn-to-dawn workdays and multiple deadlines of yore, but a bit of the remembered excitement should be a tonic.\n\nSadly, Neil Armstrong will be absent. He died on Aug. 25, 2012. (Mr. Aldrin is living and so is the third astronaut, Michael Collins.)\n\nThe Armstrong obituary I wrote ran above the fold on the front page on Sunday, Aug. 26, 2012. As I wrote it, I felt the old surge of Apollo emotion returning. Ever so briefly, I was young again, responding to a deadline and waiting presses.\n\nIn the obituary, I continued the exchange between Armstrong and mission control:\n\n“Roger, Tranquillity,” mission control replied. “We copy you on the ground. You’ve got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We’re breathing again. Thanks a lot.”\n\nThe same could have been said for hundreds of millions of people around the world watching on television.\n\nOne reader that Sunday was a woman I had known and been fond of more than 50 years ago. She was still a space buff and in an email praised the obit. One thing led to another and in our rediscovery we dispelled creeping loneliness in favor of love. Today we are together.\n\nRead the article “Men Walk On Moon”\n\nRead the obituary “Neil Armstrong, First Man on the Moon, Dies at 82”\n\nA Fighter's Fighter, Bruce Lee\n\nBefore Bruce Lee sprang into martial arts movies in the early 1970s, the average actor in a kung fu film may have been better prepared to deliver a Shakespearean soliloquy than a roundhouse kick.\n\n“In our early action films, we used actors who knew little about fighting,” Raymond Chow, one of the producers behind “Enter the Dragon” and other movies that starred Lee, said in an interview in 1973. “We had to use various camera tricks. But the audiences can tell the difference. It knows a real fighter when it sees one. That’s why Bruce Lee is such a hit.”\n\nBorn in San Francisco and raised in Hong Kong, Lee was a fighter’s fighter. He began studying martial arts in earnest as a teenager, augmenting his fighting with strength training and dancing. In time he developed his own style, Jeet Kune Do.\n\nActing was in Lee’s blood. His father, Lee Hoi-Chuen, appeared in Cantonese opera and films, and Lee started acting as a boy. He appeared in Chinese films and the short-lived 1960s American television series “The Green Hornet,” playing the title character’s assistant, Kato, in their crime-fighting exploits. Kato was a valet and martial arts master, a supporting character who became popular in Hong Kong, where the show was known as “The Kato Show.” Kato’s popularity helped Lee land a movie deal with Chow’s Golden Harvest studio.\n\nLee’s precise, powerful yet seemingly effortless grace and presence before the camera made him an international star.\n\n“Enter the Dragon,” one of the first martial arts movies produced by a Hollywood studio, was Lee’s best-known film. Lee did his own stunts, helped write the script and choreographed the fight scenes. In the film he played a martial arts master who infiltrates a criminal’s island fortress by agreeing to fight in a tournament. The film transfixed audiences around the world and cleaned up at the box office. Here’s one of the movie’s many memorable fight scenes.\n\nLee did not live to see the film’s success. He died at 32 on July 20, 1973, after being found unconscious on the floor of his Hong Kong apartment, just days before “Enter the Dragon” had its premiere.\n\nRumors that he had been murdered by gangsters added to his mystique, but the cause of death was thought to be a brain edema, possibly resulting from an adverse reaction to medication. More than 200 police officers had to bar thousands of screaming fans from his funeral service.\n\nLee’s son Brandon also died in an untimely fashion: He was shot at 28 while filming the 1994 supernatural action movie “The Crow” with a gun that was supposed to contain blanks.\n\n“Enter the Dragon” and the rest of Lee’s career have made an indelible mark on popular cul"
