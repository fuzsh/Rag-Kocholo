        "text": "×\n\nJake has been building websites since the 1990s, and has built award winning web-based solutions for Fortune 100 companies, the U.S. Navy, major universities, and high profile non-profits. His analyses have been quoted on high profile websites like c|net and the Winsupersite.\n\nJake started working with WordPress in 2006 while managing the interactive division of a 100-man contractor. In 2009, while employed as Technology Director at a Providence-based agency, he refocused his professional attention on the platform, releasing free plug-ins, diverting new projects to the platform, and engaging the community. Jake’s leadership helped transform that agency from a 3-man team serving a niche CMS to an open source software agency with 10 employees.\n\nIn February 2011, Jake founded 10up with a vision of a distributed, elite team that could build beautiful, easy to manage websites on the web’s best platform – WordPress. He bootstrapped the company into the team you see today.\n\nBetween leading the charge at 10up, Jake has been a writer and expert reviewer for Smashing Magazine and taught WordPress development at Boston University. Jake has spoken at conferences and events around the country, including CMS Expo, Prestige, Pressnomics, and WordCamps in San Francisco, New York City, Chicago, Phoenix, Philadelphia. He helped organize the first WordCamp Boston in 2010, founded the WordPress Providence Meetup in Rhode Island, and restarted the WordPress Meetup in Sacramento.\n\nJake is a core contributor to WordPress and maintains some of the highest rated plug-ins on the official repository. Cumulatively, they have been downloaded over 1,250,000 times.\n\n×\n\nJohn‘s been working in professional services agencies for over 20 years. Before becoming the CEO of 10up in 2014, he was Managing Director at ISITE Design. Prior to that he was a Senior Director at Optaros, Director of Application Development at PixelMEDIA, and a Director / Principal Consultant at Molecular.\n\nHe has served clients from early-stage startups to the Fortune 50, as well as higher education and the non-profit sector.

Her clients have all been top-tier – Audi, Honda, KFC, Pizza Hut, Unilever, Kimberly-Clark, Tim Hortons – and her projects hugely varied: from custom website and app builds, to editorially-driven native content, to getting the price of that chicken burger changed as quickly as possible.\n\nHaving battled with a lot of clunky, proprietary CMS software, Lily is a full-blown member of the WordPress choir; the creative possibilities afforded to clients through its open-source structure are virtually limitless, and in the age of virtual storytelling, it’s the ideal platform to help brands make sure they remain at the forefront of the narrative.\n\nLily relocated back to the UK a few years ago, and when she’s not working, you’ll probably find her doing really badly at her local pub quiz, bowling a lot of gutter balls, or naming everything her small person points to on their country walks.\n\n×\n\nComing from a background in digital marketing in both agency and corporate settings, Martha brought to 10up experience working directly in production roles, leading interactive B2B and B2C projects (working with CMS platforms, including WordPress) from a project and account management standpoint. From small mom-and-pop shops to Fortune 5 companies, she successfully managed projects from conceptualization to execution to sustainability alongside a full stack team.\n\nAfter joining the team in 2015, Martha rose from her role as a Web Strategist to earn multiple promotions into her current role as the Vice President of Account Strategy. Outside of leading the evolution of the discipline at an executive level, Martha manages a team of Directors and day-to-day Strategists — driving a consultative, solution-based culture, grounded in well understood short- and long-term business goals of 10up’s client partners.\n\nMartha is a proud working mom, and enjoys spending time with her two young boys and husband at their home in Appleton, WI. For fun, and to decompress from the day-to-day grind, Martha likes to cook, watch baseball, visit different MLB ballparks (thanks to her dad for instilling this love in her – she has been to 28 stadiums currently in use, and five that have been knocked down), and catch up with family and friends over a glass of Pinot Noir.\n\n×\n\nMike is an international traveller who fell in love with WordPress in 2010. Hailing originally from South Carolina, USA- Mike has lived on three continents ( North America, Asia & Europe ) and visited many exotic locations.\n\nAlong the way he nabbed a BS in Computer Information Systems, led student-organized Tsunami relief efforts in 2005, served as applications & databases manager at an international security company, started a travel agency, and happened to bump into Paul Clark in Chiang Mai, Thailand. This chance encounter introduced Mike to the wonderful world of WordPress and provided the awesome opportunity to co-build the WordPress tools that are still being used to save lives in Burma today.\n\nSince 2010, Mike worked alongside Paul Clark & Taylor Aldridge at their company, Brainstorm Media, which firmly believed that democratized, open publishing platforms like WordPress can make the web, and the world, a better place. During this time, Mike built and maintained powerful systems with clean interfaces for a number of clients, representing a wide range of industries and non-profit organizations.\n\nIn January 2014, Brainstorm Media joined forces with 10up and Mike was able to add his skills and experience to the incredible pool of talent that resulted from this acquisition.

He has a passion for turning a blank canvas into something incredible. Solving the constantly changing puzzle of meeting client needs propels Taylor to learn about different and more effective web technologies and strategies.\n\nTaylor believes learning is an extremely important part of what keeps web development fresh and fun. When WordPress came onto the scene, he jumped in head first developing plugins and themes for personal and client websites. Taylor’s most popular plugin is Custom Contact Forms; a plugin for creating contact forms that is jam packed with features. It has been downloaded over 1M times.\n\nTaylor was one of 10up’s first employees, joining during its first year, and would go onto become one of 10up’s first Senior Engineers and Technical Leads.

After graduating from college, he cut his teeth as a PHP developer for a bespoke university e-learning framework; an experience that opened his mind to the endless possibilities that diligence and a simple computer can achieve. His next move would be to Habari Media, one of South Africa’s leading digital media houses, where in just one year he worked his way up to lead developer and team manager.\n\nIn 2010, feeling the need to expand his skill set and dive into more self-satisfying projects, Brent founded his own company, Kaira. It was around this time that he also discovered WordPress; since then, he has not looked back. Leveraging WordPress as a CMS, he developed successful websites and campaigns for top advertising agencies across Africa, worked on amazing projects like a web application and CRM for a major charity supplying gifts to over 100,000 underprivileged children. Brent has engineered custom integrations with social media platforms, built intranet networks, and developed successful WooCommerce extensions.\n\nWhen Brent isn’t writing badass code, you can find him hiking up Cape Town’s beautiful Table Mountain, playing guitar, or cooking a delicious vegan meal.\n\n×\n\nChristian has been active in the web industry for over 10 years, filling diverse roles encompassing everything from project management to backend programming. He got his start at an agency building small marketing websites for small to medium sized businesses using WordPress. He quickly set himself apart and was given the opportunity to come on as an engineering consultant for several large companies in the healthcare and travel industries using WordPress.\n\nAfter a few years of consulting, Christian joined a prestigious WordPress centric agency, Lift UX, as a backend developer. Here he was able to concentrate fully on providing robust engineering solutions to major enterprise media companies. As the backend engineer of this user experience design company, Christian embraced newer Javascript technologies like React and Angular to push WordPress into new and uncharted territory. After 2 years with Lift UX, he joined the 10up team through an acquisition.\n\nWhen Christian isn’t writing code, he is out hiking, kayaking, fishing, and enjoying the beach lifestyle in sunny Clearwater, Florida with his fiancée and their dog.\n\n×\n\nDavid’s interest in building code developed the moment he discovered the viewable source code of web pages back in 1998. However, after starting college, he soon realized that what he wanted to learn, wasn’t being taught in the classroom. So David left school behind, and joined a moving company where he traveled the U.S., gained life experience and continued his self-study of web development. Eventually he settled down and started a computer repair company, while also serving as a youth pastor along with his wife.\n\nDavid spent more than a decade building websites, online games, and robots, when eventually the plummeting costs of PCs led him to cease repairing computers and start offering freelance services online. He started out creating solutions for clients, but soon began focusing exclusively on WordPress as his affinity for the platform grew.\n\nAfter years of working solo, David eventually decided to join an agency so that he could work with a team and further refine his skills. It didn’t take long for him to decide on 10up.\n\nDavid’s biggest personal endeavor with WordPress has been creating a plugin to build role-playing games. Now he has his eye on contributing to WordPress core.\n\nWhen David isn’t at the computer, he’s usually either reading about theology, watching cartoons with his two daughters, or pestering his wife with the latest random fact he learned — probably about the late Fred Rogers.\n\n×\n\nDustin’s passion for all things computing began before the advent of the Internet—back when the purpose of a computer was to print Print Shop banners on a dot matrix printer or play Wolfenstein and Oregon Trail. His first experience with the Internet was CompuServe and America Online.\n\nIt wasn’t until he graduated from high school that he received a computer to call his own. In 1998, while studying at the birthplace of Slackware Linux, Dustin installed Linux for the first time. After getting a job at the Fargo-Moorhead Family YMCA, Dustin was able to use Linux for web, email, and VPN services. Later, he used the highly reliable web platform to serve millions of pages per month at Forum Communications Company. Dustin is excited to bring his Linux knowledge to the table at 10up.\n\nWhen Dustin is away from the computer, he can be found with his family, tinkering with his Raspberry Pi and Arduino, or playing video games.\n\n×\n\nFabian is a life long learner, who started his technical journey in school.

Since that time, Ivan has had the opportunity to work with several languages (in addition to PHP), including ASP, ActionScript 3, JavaScript and some C#.\n\nAfter working with numerous Content Management Systems – including one that he built – Ivan discovered WordPress and was instantly hooked. WordPress quickly became his CMS of choice; he even found himself building on it in his free time. Ivan thinks of WordPress as a “canvas,” a “foundation of great masterpieces”.\n\nOver the last seven years, Ivan had the opportunity to lead and work with small to medium sized teams to deliver time sensitive projects to high profile clients like Walmart, and Hilton Grand Vacations.

After college, his passion for web technologies was fueled behind the scenes during careers that were not necessarily technical. Even then, Joe was consistently working in IT and digital marketing – building websites during the table-layout days and using social media before it was a term.\n\nIn 2010, Joe followed his passion for web development and ‘sharpened his blade’ by taking courses in Digital Marketing Strategies, Internet Design, and Interactive Producer at Portland State University.

She has built her career around an impressive book of business — as comfortable working with the principle of a small startup as she is with a VP of a Fortune 50 company — and has always pushed the envelope to bring the best process and strategy to bear in organizing and motivating her teams.\n\nIn recent years, Teal has led teams of polyglot programmers, UX designers, data engineers and project managers, facilitating quality and efficiency in development and delivery using an agile framework. She also has a background in WordPress theme development, which provides her a uniquely rounded perspective from which to facilitate requirements discovery and translate business needs to technical specification.

He picked up a book and has continued to do so still to this day. By 2007 he discovered WordPress and started building handcrafted themes and quickly thereafter, plugins. His experience with WordPress over the last 10+ years has been broad, ranging from basic blog structures to full-on web applications for enterprise-level clients. His experience in the industry found him a seat on the board of advisors for the Santa Rosa Junior College for the last several years where he has helped professors fine-tune their curriculum to position students for job-ready skills after graduation.\n\nOne of his first enterprise-level projects was with Maker Media where he worked on their online magazine, MAKE:, and on Maker Faire where he looked after the API system for their live event mobile app and website. All of which were hosted on WordPress.com VIP. He also loves community, which is partially what has kept him in the WordPress community, he helped start a thriving community for web professionals in his city of Santa Rosa, CA. Cole and others were tired of making the 1-hour drive to San Francisco to meet like-minded programmers and designers so they created their own. By the time he stepped out of leading the community in 2015, there were over 1000 people in the Facebook Group and the monthly meetups would see on average 20+ people which was astonishing for a city that isn’t known for its tech. Later, more focused meetup groups were formed as spin-offs from ours.\n\nHe has a passion for learning and adapts quickly to new concepts. His career has taken him through several different programming languages and tools to keep in his programmer’s utility belt such as Node.js/Express.js, MongoDB, C#, JavaScript, and of course PHP, just to name a few.\n\nOutside of his career, he is a father to a 2-year-old “heart warrior”, a husband, a multi-instrumental musician, frequents concerts, having monthly board game nights at his house, and traveling whenever possible.\n\n×\n\nDaine has been a committed (no Git pun intended) and passionate open source follower for over 6 years now.

He discovered his affinity for WordPress, a platform that lets him do just that, while employed as the lead web developer at a marketing agency in Idaho. Today, Darin is excited to be focusing his career on building top shelf themes and plugins for the platform. A few of his plug-ins can already be found on Github and the plug-in repository, today.\n\nDarin’s attraction to web development was sparked by the notion that he could take a blank canvas and build a fully functional product on top of it. It’s the perfect outlet for his creative impulses and desire to be challenged.\n\nWhen Darin is not up to his elbows breaking order to a digital mess, he loves spending time with his wife and two kids. A sportsman, he can often be found outdoors, usually playing basketball and golf. He lives in Idaho Falls, Idaho, and loves the slow life of a smaller city with all the benefits of the great outdoors.\n\n×\n\nAfter realizing that his passion for photography wasn’t going to pay the bills, Daryll started a BSc in Computing. He graduated in 2012 and has been writing PHP ever since.\n\nDaryll worked for a couple of agencies in his home county of Cornwall, where he progressed from a fresh graduate to lead developer, improving his skills along the way. WordPress became a core component of Daryll’s toolbox which he leveraged to architect solutions whenever possible.

As a Graphic Designer looking for a job, Devin needed a way to showcase his best work. He picked up a book on HTML, and was swept up by its speed and simplicity. No waiting for proofs or validating spot colors, just instant gratification in real time. This small step inspired him to continue his growth as a Developer through self learning.\n\nWhile working for Live to Play Sports, Devin took the lead on 5 in house websites, building content management systems and stylistic frontends. During this 5 year post, he also dabbled in Flash Development, popular at that time, and landed an American Design Award for his production of the Mace Gear website, an urban cycle and lifestyle brand. Since then, Devin has worked for Rethink Canada, Engine Digital, and a small blockchain startup. His latest WordPress build allows authors to create immersive custom interactive stories using an array of flexible components that includes quizzes, slideshows, videos and more.\n\nDevin joins 10up as a Senior Front End Engineer. Here he hopes to continue growing his knowledge of WordPress and Javascript, stretching the possibilities of theme development far beyond a simple blogging platform. He calls himself a “forever student”–one person can’t have all of the answers, so he continues to study and practice his craft. He enjoys pair programming and working with others to solve big challenges.\n\nWhen not writing code, Devin can be found playing ball hockey or soccer with his kids, going for a run, or watching the latest Premier League match in support of Liverpool. On occasion, he’ll pickup the acoustic guitar and jam out on a few simple chords.\n\n×\n\nEduard has always been interested in technology and electronics.

If energy and excitement were something you could monetize, he would have retired long ago. He blends deep experience with passion for the industry to find the best solutions for our clients.\n\nFlynt’s agency origin story begins in college radio (shout out to KCPR, Cal Poly Radio!) where he realized that many creative and technical people don’t enjoy the promotion, logistics, and financial aspects of running a complex organization — they just want to do great work!

During college, a passion for print publishing he found while serving as Campus Life and Photo Editor for the yearbook evolved into a love of web publishing. In 2009, he found WordPress while working on a university online training program; he knew he’d found his calling.\n\nAfter graduating from Auburn University with a degree in Management Information System, he moved to Atlanta where he would spent five years as lead developer for a local agency with clients primarily in healthcare, manufacturing, and real estate.

By the age of 18, he was already familiar with multiple programming languages (PHP, Delphi, Assembler), and was hired by the largest Russian search engine. Throughout the years he worked on a wide range of high-profile projects for large international companies, finally reaching a position of director of IT and security in a local multi-billion dollar company.\n\nIn 2009, fuelled by his passion for web development, he opened his own web agency as a side project. In 2014 he transitioned to WordPress as a free alternative to the pay-to-use local CMS system and in 2015 released his first plugin to integrate WooCommerce websites with a local search engine for online shopping. Finally, in 2017 he made a full transition from IT and landed his first developer position in WPMU DEV, working on Smush and Hummingbird plugins and quickly progressed to a lead developer, and then head of development position.\n\nIn addition to his experience as a developer and mentor, Anton loves to learn new things.

Community taught, he started to gain experience with Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and decided that Front End Engineering was going to be his focus.\n\nHe crafted a real-time tool to manage calls and agents back when there was no Angular or React. After getting some experience, he decided to move to London with his family for some time to expand his career. After a brief gig on a gambling company, he worked at a big agency where he had the chance to work with clients such as Google and Microsoft. Working on the Google promotion with Star Wars or Google Summer of Code revamp (among others), gave him invaluable experience in making websites fast and accessible for everyone. He started to share his knowledge within the company and delivered some talks about Accessibility and how to make it part of your day-to-day toolkit.\n\nAfter his second daughter was born he moved back to Seville, Spain, where he continued working remotely for a different agency. Doing work for Lean In, he helped enhance storytelling to teach about how women are treated differently and raise social awareness. Antonio also had the opportunity to work brands like Billboard and Facebook – he was even part of the recent Billboard redesign. He managed the Front End team and set the basis for the team to grow.

It was there that a passion for WordPress began. In 2014 as part of the rebuild of The Press and Journal website, he helped construct one of the UK’s first two-way content flows between WordPress and their editorial system, which proved to be one of the formative tools for digital-first workflows. This was then adopted across the other newspapers in the business and became the catalyst for a single large WordPress network powering over 100 websites. He takes a great sense of pride in guiding and mentoring friends and colleagues to replace almost everything he built in the subsequent years, before a – rejected! – pull request brought him to 10up.\n\nWhen Cameron isn’t being the company’s resident Wookiee, he can be found sinking hours into a book or two, listening to music, working his way through Star Trek again on Netflix, or playing an immersive RPG on his PS4.\n\n×\n\nThe first time Chandra saw a computer was in 8th standard in school. He was about 13 years old. It was love at first sight and he never missed a chance to use the computer. It stoked his curiosity and as years went by, his uncle told him about an Information and Technology course. As he graduated from school, he wasted no time and was enrolled for a Diploma in IT, at B&B Institute of Technology College. His love for technology and computers just grew deeper as he dived into different programming languages, database systems, and more. He loved writing code, and it became a passion for him.\n\nAfter his Diploma, he pursued his Bachelor’s Degree in IT from Dharamsinh Desai University. He was introduced to a lot of Java, and it was for a while his favorite. Java, ASP. Net and security were things they focused on in the syllabus. In his final year, he attended a session on PHP and his first project was on Joomla. He got introduced to frameworks like CodeIgniter and CakePHP.\n\nSoon he created his first blog on WordPress and even created a custom CMS with CodeIgniter framework. By the end of 2013, he was freelancing and mostly looking for work in Joomla CMS and CodeIgniter framework. He did not get much further and so he dipped his hands into learning WordPress.\n\nIn 2015, he joined rtCamp Inc as a WordPress developer and this is where he was introduced to the power of Open Source, and the WordPress Community. Attending WordCamps and meeting other developers, designers and users shaped his thinking and introduced him to new ideas and approaches towards WordPress. His first contribution was a bit of translation of WordPress in Gujarati language. Over time he has contributed to the WordPress Core and Meta.\n\nAt rtCamp, he has worked in multiple positions from WordPress Developer to Director of Engineering. He has led their internal training program and coached WordPress Development to more than 40 developers hired through campus placement.\n\nOver the years, he has developed a deep love for learning, and hopes to learn WordPress even more “deeply”.\n\n×\n\nChelsea has always been passionate about creating and trying new mediums whether it was coding, cooking, or crafting. She still remembers the first HTML and CSS website she created for a high school club. Upon starting college she spent time delving into other languages than coding, graduating summa cum laude with a double major in English and Humanities. After spending several years managing nonprofit websites, earning a Masters in Public Administration with a focus on communications, and serving on the Tech for Good Board in Denver, CO, she decided to devote herself to web development full time and create products for larger audiences. She completed a Front End Engineering Certificate at a challenging and industry recognized program.\n\nAfter learning the ins and outs of front end web technologies, she took her coding expertise and started working at Revolution Messaging, an agency based out of Washington, DC.

After graduating from University he worked in a wide range of digital disciplines from print design to motion graphics.\n\nDuring that time Chris had a instant passion for the web and shifted his career to focus on web design. Chris started to work as an in-house designer in the finance sector where he built up a strong brand and identity for the company. He then moved into working agency side and built up an award winning creative team for the agency. While working agency side, he was serving clients such as Danone, NHS and Virgin Media.\n\nMore recently in his role as senior digital designer, Chris coached another agencies digital team. His time there allowed him to further strengthen both his skills and theirs. He was able to improve procedures across the board which positively increased the level of the work they put out. This shift allowed the agency to attract high profile contracts purely based on the work they’d seen we had done for other clients. Chris also pushed for the analysis of current work so they could understand the user, user needs, and user characteristics better. This analysis gave the team greater justification for making changes to improve conversions and they were able to be very proactive in presenting ideas for improvement to their clients. This role pushed Chris to get really interested in the User Experience (UX), an intuitive customer journey and constant educated improvements for a digital projects.\n\nAway from analysis and a screen Chris can be found running around the streets as he’s a keen runner. Over the years he has taken part in many long distance runs and half marathons for charity.\n\n×\n\nChris started playing around with websites way back, when platforms like Geocities and MySpace were the platforms to be on. Learning the basics of HTML, designing with table layouts and overzealousness of the marquee tag, he soon discovered a keen interest in building things in the digital world.\n\nIn 2010, Chris decided to leave his current employment and made the jump to being a self employed web developer, following a dream to be a web developer from those earlier days. He gave himself 3 months to study and get up to speed with the front-end. Amazingly and luckily he landed himself a remote developer role for a web agency in Halifax, Nova Scotia and was then introduced to WordPress.\n\nSince then Chris hasn’t taken his foot off the gas, and has worked with many clients, small and large, building solutions for WordPress which make it do anything and everything other than being a simple blogging platform.\n\nIn his previous role as Senior WordPress Developer for a leading UK web agency, he oversaw and developed complex integrations involving third party APIs, large data migrations and custom plugin development. His best work saw him combining Vue.js and WooCommerce, bringing together his passion for high performance front-ends with the fantastic extensibility of WordPress as a CMS.\n\nWhen he’s not at his desk or reading yet another JavaScript book, Chris is Dad to a little boy and enjoys spending as much time as possibl"
