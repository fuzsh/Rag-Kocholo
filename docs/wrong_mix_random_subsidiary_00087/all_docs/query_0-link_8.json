Lebrun's position as a polemicist is interpreted here as a strategy of self-presentation which made possible the controversial birth of the figure of the museum expert. With Lebrun, the Louvre imposed itself as a public space of artistic expertise, where values imported from the market - such as attributionism, materiality, and authenticity - became prominent in the evaluation of paintings.\n\nThe birth of the most important 18th century dental text: Pierre Fauchard's Le Chirurgien Dentiste.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpielman, Andrew I\n\n2007-10-01\n\nPierre Fauchard (1678-1761) is considered the father of modern dentistry. His seminal book, Le Chirurgien Dentiste, ou TraitÃ© des Dents (1728), is the discipline's first complete work. During the five years preceding its publication (1723-1728), Pierre Fauchard sought the opinions, contributions, and \"approbation\" (approval) of 19 of his colleagues: six physicians, 12 surgeons, and one dentist. The first and most important contributor to the manuscript was Jean Devaux, surgeon and mentor to Fauchard. The next six reviewers were illustrious physicians and scientists of the time: Philippe Hecquet, Jean-Claude Adrien Helvetius, Jean Baptiste Silva, Antoine DeJussieu, Raymond Jacob Finot, and Antoine Benignus Winslow. The subsequent 12 reviewers were all sworn-surgeons (certified by St. CÃ´me), including a lone dentist, Laudumiey, surgeon-dentist to His Majesty, Philip V, King of Spain. Fauchard knew that for dentistry to be regarded as a learned profession, and perhaps for Fauchard to be recognized as its leader, he needed the support and approval of the establishment before publishing his book. This is an account of how he attained this endorsement.\n\nUnveiling the origin of HESS J1809-193\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCastelletti, G.; Giacani, E.; Petriella, A.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nAims: The main goal of this paper is to provide new insights on the origin of the observable flux of Î³ rays from HESS J1809-193 using new high-quality observations in the radio domain. Methods: We used the Expanded Very Large Array (now known as the Karl G. Jansky Very large Array, JVLA) to produce a deep full-synthesis imaging at 1.4 GHz of the vicinity of PSR J1809-1917. These data were used in conjunction with 12CO observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in the transition line J = 3-2 and atomic hydrogen data from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey to investigate the properties of the interstellar medium in the direction of the source HESS J1809-193. Results: The new radio continuum image, obtained with a synthesized beam of 8'' Ã 4'' and a sensitivity of 0.17 mJy beam-1, reveals with unprecedented detail all the intensity structures in the field. No radio counterpart to the observed X-ray emission supposed to be a pulsar wind nebula powered by PSR J1809-1917 is seen in the new JVLA image. We discovered a system of molecular clouds on the edge of the supernova remnant (SNR) G11.0-0.0 shock front, which is positionally coincident with the brightest part of the TeV source HESS J1809-193. We determine, on the basis of kinematic and morphological evidences, a physical link of the SNR with the clouds for which we estimated a total (molecular plus atomic) mass of ~3 Ã 103Mâ and a total proton density in the range 2-3 Ã 103 cm-3. Conclusions: We propose as the most likely origin of the very high-energy Î³-ray radiation from HESS J1809-193 a hadronic mechanism through collisions of ions accelerated at the SNR G11.0-0.0 shock with the molecular matter in the vicinity of the remnant.

Based on nearly nine years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) Pass 8 data, we report here on a deep search for the gamma-ray emission from HESS J0632+057 in the 0.1â300 GeV energy range. We find a previously unknown gamma-ray source, Fermi J0632.6+0548, spatially coincident with HESS J0632+057. The measured flux of Fermi J0632.6+0548 is consistent with the previous flux upper limit on HESS J0632+057 and shows variability that can be related to the HESS J0632+057 orbital phase. We proposemoreÂ Â» that Fermi J0632.6+0548 is the GeV counterpart of HESS J0632+057. Considering the Very High Energy spectrum of HESS J0632+057, a possible spectral turnover above 10 GeV may exist in Fermi J0632.6+0548, as appears to be common in other established gamma-ray binaries.Â«Â less\n\nPierre Jean Georges Cabanis (1757-1808): an early nineteenth century source for the concept of nervous energy in European behavioral neurosciences.\n\nPubMed\n\nTurgeon, Y; Whitaker, H A\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe nineteenth century witnessed many advances in neuroscientific concepts. Among the notable are Charles Bell's (1774-1842) and FranÃ§ois Magendie's (1783-1855) identification of sensory and motor pathways, Thomas Henry Huxley's (1825-1895) elaboration of evolutionary theory in the context of comparative neuroanatomy, and Emile Du Bois-Reymond's (1818-1896) and Hermann von Helmholtz's (1821-1894) work in experimental neurophysiology and on the concept of nervous energy. In Germany, the idea that the nervous system consisted of two elements, one that generated nervous energy and another that conducted it throughout the body, had wide currency in mid-nineteenth century. In France, Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis (1757-1808), physician, philosopher, and one of the founders of modern psychophysiology, argued that the brain is the part of the body in which electricity is stored. In his Rapports du Physique et du Moral de l'Homme, published between 1796 and 1802 (translated into German under the title VerhÃ¤ltnis der Seele zum KÃ¶rper (1808)), Cabanis proposed new ideas on brain function, on the brain's own sensibility, on the concept of will, and on the chemical basis of nervous activity. In the Rapports Cabanis proposed a theory of how brain and nerves relate to thought and behavior. Foreshadowing later developments in neuropsychology, he suggested that different parts of the nervous system have separate functions. Despite the fact that Cabanis had many interesting ideas about brain function, he has been largely ignored by historians of neuroscience; e. g., he is mentioned briefly in Clark and Jacyna (1989), in only two footnotes in Neuburger (1897/1981), and not at all in Finger (1994). Cabanis's far-reaching theory of how the brain works helped shape understanding of the general notion of nervous energy in nineteenth-century European neuroscience.\n\nO'Hara Receives 2007 Harry H.

Based on the nonlinear diffusion shock acceleration model, we explore the emission from these two TeV sources, the particle diffusion is assumed to be different inside and outside the absorbing boundary of the particles accelerated in the SNR shock. The results indicate that (1) the GeVâTeV emission from the region of the HESS J1640-465 is produced as a result of the particle acceleration inside the SNR G338.3-0.0 andmoreÂ Â» (2) the runaway cosmic-ray particles outside the SNR are interacting with the nearby dense molecular cloud (MC) at the region of the HESS J1641-463, corresponding Ï{sup 0} decay gamma-ray in protonâproton collision contribute to the TeV emission from the HESS J1641-463.

Previously only one GeV source was reported in this region and was associated with HESS J1640-465. With an increased data set and the improved sensitivity afforded by the reprocessed data (P7REP) of the LAT, we now report the detection, morphological study, and spectral analysis of two distinct sources above 100 MeV. The softest emission in this region comes from the TeV source HESS J1641-463 which is well fitted with a power law of index Î = 2.47 Â± 0.05 Â± 0.06 and presents no significant Î³-ray signal above 10 GeV, which contrasts with its hard spectrum at TeV energies. The Fermi-LAT spectrum of the second TeV source, HESS J1640-465 is well described by a power-law shape of index Î = 1.99 Â± 0.04 Â± 0.07 that links up naturally with the spectral data points obtained by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.).

However, their work is highly relevant for describing and explaining hysteria in the tradition of Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893). Both men had their teacher's clinical perspicacity, which enabled them to accumulate detailed clinical and psychological descriptions. These were published in books that achieved success in their day. From his descriptions, Sollier deduced a pathophysiology of hysteria in which a psychic inhibition led to a functional deficit in sensory-motor areas. This is partially confirmed by current functional brain imaging techniques. As for Janet, he developed concepts which are still valid today, involving personality dissociation, what he referred to as 'fixed ideas', and the subconscious. Sollier and Janet both saw hysteria as a response to the trigger of an emotional shock, specific to certain personalities. While the fundamental work by Joseph Babinski (1857-1932) on hysterical paralysis did much to enrich neurological semiology, Sollier contributed a novel description of the pathophysiology of hysteria, and Janet elucidated its psychopathological mechanisms.\n\nVolcanic rocks cored on hess rise, Western Pacific Ocean\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nVallier, T.L.; Windom, K.E.; Seifert, K.E.; Thiede, Jorn\n\n1980-01-01\n\nLarge aseismic rises and plateaus in the western Pacific include the Ontong-Java Plateau, Magellan Rise, Shatsky Rise, Mid-Pacific Mountains, and Hess Rise. These are relatively old features that rise above surrounding sea floors as bathymetric highs. Thick sequences of carbonate sediments overlie, what are believed to be, Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous volcanic pedestals. We discuss here petrological and tectonic implications of data from volcanic rocks cored on Hess Rise. The data suggest that Hess Rise originated at a spreading centre in the late early Cretaceous (Aptian-Albian stages). Subsequent off-ridge volcanism in the late Albian-early Cenomanian stages built a large archipelago of oceanic islands and seamounts composed, at least in part, of alkalic rocks. The volcanic platform subsided during its northward passage through the mid-Cretaceousequatorial zone. Faulting and uplift, and possibly volcanism, occurred in the latest Cretaceous (Campanian-Maastrichtian stages). Since then, Hess Rise continued its northward movement and subsidence. Volcanic rocks from holes drilled on Hess Rise during IPOD Leg 62 (Fig. 1) are briefly described here and we relate the petrological data to the origin and evolution of that rise. These are the first volcanic rocks reported from Hess Rise. ?? 1980 Nature Publishing Group.\n\nHESS J1640â465 AND HESS J1641â463: TWO INTRIGUING TeV SOURCES IN LIGHT OF NEW FERMI -LAT OBSERVATIONS\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nLemoine-Goumard, M.; Grondin, M. -H.; Acero, F.; ...\n\n2014-09-30\n\nWe report on Î³-ray analysis of the region containing the bright TeV source HESS J1640-465 and the closeby TeV source HESS J1641-463 using 64 months of observationswith the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT).

In other words, the relativistic effects on local gravitational instability are considered for systems whose characteristic velocities and corresponding gravitational fields are higher than those permitted in the Newtonian limit. The dispersion relation for the propagation of small perturbations is found in the post-Newtonian approximation using two different techniques. A new Jeans mass is derived and compared to the standard Jeans mass. In this limit, the relativistic effects make the new Jeans mass smaller than the Newtonian Jeans mass. Furthermore, the fractional difference between these two masses increases when themoreÂ Â» temperature/pressure of the system increases. Interestingly, in this limit, pressure can enhance gravitational instability instead of preventing it. Finally, the results are applied to high-temperature astrophysical systems, and the possibility of local fragmentation in some relativistic systems is investigated.Â«Â less\n\nHESS J1640â465 AND HESS J1641â463: TWO INTRIGUING TeV SOURCES IN LIGHT OF NEW FERMI-LAT OBSERVATIONS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLemoine-Goumard, M.; Grondin, M.-H.; Laffon, H.\n\n2014-10-10\n\nWe report on Î³-ray analysis of the region containing the bright TeV source HESS J1640â465 and the close-by TeV source HESS J1641â463 using 64 months of observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Previously only one GeV source was reported in this region and was associated with HESS J1640â465. With an increased data set and the improved sensitivity afforded by the reprocessed data (P7REP) of the LAT, we now report the detection, morphological study, and spectral analysis of two distinct sources above 100 MeV. The softest emission in this region comes from the TeV source HESS J1641â463 which ismoreÂ Â» well fitted with a power law of index Î = 2.47 Â± 0.05 Â± 0.06 and presents no significant Î³-ray signal above 10 GeV, which contrasts with its hard spectrum at TeV energies. The Fermi-LAT spectrum of the second TeV source, HESS J1640â465 is well described by a power-law shape of index Î = 1.99 Â± 0.04 Â± 0.07 that links up naturally with the spectral data points obtained by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). These new results provide new constraints concerning the identification of these two puzzling Î³-ray sources.Â«Â less\n\nAspects of Hess' Acquisition of American Oil & Gas\n\nEIA Publications\n\n2010-01-01\n\nOn July 27, 2010, Hess Corporation announced that it had agreed to acquire American Oil & Gas, Inc. in a stock-only transaction worth as much as $488 million (based on Hess' closing price of $53.30/share, anticipated number of newly issued shares, and $30 million credit facility extended to American Oil & Gas prior to closing).\n\nSir Karl Popper and Education\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMcNamara, D.

H.E.S.S. has revealed the presence of a very high energy gamma-ray diffuse emission in the central 200 pc, in addition to the detection of a point like source coincident with the supermassive black hole SgrA*. With more than 250 hours of H.E.S.S. data and the continuous improvement of the analysis techniques, a detailed morphology and spectral analysis of the region is now possible. We will report on the new characterisation of the spectrum of the central source down to 100 GeV energies taking advantage of the H.E.S.S.

We will present the recent discovery of a powerful cosmic PeVatron accelerator at the center of our Galaxy as well as a new characterization of the diffuse gamma-ray emission in the central 200 pc of our Galaxy through a detailed morphology study. By analysing the nature of the various components of this emission, the existence of a strong cosmic-ray gradient and thus the presence of a strong cosmic-ray accelerator at the very centre of our Galaxy was found.

HESS J1841-055 is one of the largest and most complex among these unidentified sources with an extension of approximately 1Â°. Follow up observations of the HESS J1841-055 region with Chandra, which is due to its high resolution good suited for searching for X-Ray counterparts and add-on analysis have revealed several X-ray sources spatially coincident with the multiple TeV emission peaks. The search for counterparts brought out the fact that not a single source itself but a bunch of sources of different nature, could be indeed the creators of this complex diffuse emission region; among them the SNR Kes 73, the pulsar within Kes 73, 1E 1841-45 and also the High Mass X-Ray Binary AX 184100.4-0536 and others.\n\n[Medical history impressions of Karl Marx 1983].\n\nPubMed\n\nKaiser, W\n\n1983-12-15\n\nExcerpts of his London era first published on the occasion of the Karl Marx testimonials of 1983 gave rise to extend the memory of the fundamental achievements of Karl Marx to medico-historical aspects.

Whereas Gall and his colleague, Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832), posited correlations between features of the skull and brain development and claimed to have localized character traits, competencies and temperaments in specific cortical regions, Flourens advocated cerebral equipotentiality and provided empirical as well as philosophical grounds for his theories. Flourens has also been recognized for his contributions to the understanding of the cerebellum's role in the coordination of movement, the localization of a respiratory center in the medulla oblongata, the relationship between the semicircular canals and balance, the role of the periosteum in bone growth and regeneration, and finally, the anesthetic properties of chloroform. Less known to historians of neuroscience is the fact that Pierre Flourens was not only a neurophysiologist and SecrÃ©taire Perpetuel of the French AcadÃ©mie des Sciences, he was also a member of the AcadÃ©mie FranÃ§aise, France's most prestigious literary academy. Examining Flourens' contributions as a writer and, at the same time, a prime target for criticism and caricature from journalists, yields a particularly interesting example of the problematic relations between different genres of science writing and their respective publics in mid-nineteenth-century France.

Hadronic and leptonic scenarios (or a blend of both) are discussed in the literature to explain the TeV emission from the object. In 2011, a Î³-ray excess was also found in the neighborhood of the source (HESS J1729-345). Here we present results of an updated analysis obtained with the meanwhile available additional H.E.S.S. data. Beyond HESS J1731-347, the analysis reveals the morphology of the emission of the adjacent TeV source HESS J1729-345 and the emission in between the two sources in greater detail. The results permit us to correlate the TeV emission outside of the SNR with molecular gas tracers, and to confront the data with scenarios in which the TeV emission outside the SNR is produced by escaping cosmic rays.\n\nAdolescent Attitudes Toward Designer Jeans: Further Evidence.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLennon, Sharron J.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nUsed classical conditioning theory of learning to predict attitudes of junior high students toward spending for designer jeans.

It was built to detect Very High Energy (VHE > 100 GeV) cosmic gamma rays. Since 2003, HESS has discovered the majority of the known astrophysical VHE gamma-ray sources, opening a new observational window on the extreme non-thermal processes at work in our universe. HESS consists of four 12-m diameter Cherenkov telescopes (CT1-4), which started data taking in 2002, and a larger 28-m telescope (CT5), built in 2012, which lowers the energy threshold of the array to 30 GeV . The cameras of CT1-4 are currently undergoing an extensive upgrade, with the goals of reducing their failure rate, reducing their readout dead time and improving the overall performance of the array. The entire camera electronics has been renewed from ground-up, as well as the power, ventilation and pneumatics systems, and the control and data acquisition software. Only the PMTs and their HV supplies have been kept from the original cameras. Novel technical solutions have been introduced, which will find their way into some of the Cherenkov cameras foreseen for the next-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory. In particular, the camera readout system is the first large-scale system based on the analog memory chip NECTAr, which was designed for CTA cameras. The camera control subsystems and the control software framework also pursue an innovative design, exploiting cutting-edge hardware and software solutions which excel in performance, robustness and flexibility. The CT1 camera has been upgraded in July 2015 and is currently taking data; CT2-4 have been upgraded in fall 2016. Together they will assure continuous operation of HESS at its full sensitivity until and possibly beyond the advent of CTA. This contribution describes the design, the testing and the in-lab and on-site performance of all components of the newly upgraded HESS\n\nOperations of and Future Plans for the Pierre Auger Observatory\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAbraham, : J.; Abreu, P.; Aglietta, M.\n\n2009-06-01\n\nThese are presentations to be presented at the 31st International Cosmic Ray Conference, in Lodz, Poland during July 2009.

We use 0.5-1 arcmin Mopra CO/CS(1-0) data in conjunction with H I data to calculate column densities towards the HESS J1731 - 347 region. We trace gas within at least four Galactic arms, typically tracing total (atomic+molecular) line-of-sight H column densities of 2-3Ã 1022 cm-2. Assuming standard X-factor values and that most of the H I/CO emission seen towards HESS J1731 - 347 is on the near-side of the Galaxy, X-ray absorption column densities are consistent with H I+CO-derived column densities foreground to, but not beyond, the Scutum-Crux Galactic arm, suggesting a kinematic distance of Ë3.2 kpc for HESS J1731 - 347. At this kinematic distance, we also find dense, infrared-dark gas traced by CS(1-0) emission coincident with the north of HESS J1731 - 347, the nearby H II region G353.43-0.37 and the nearby unidentified gamma-ray source HESS J1729 - 345. This dense gas lends weight to the idea that HESS J1729 - 345 and HESS J1731 - 347 are connected, perhaps via escaping cosmic-rays.\n\nPREFACE Spectral and transport properties of quantum systems: in memory of Pierre Duclos (1948-2010) Spectral and transport properties of quantum systems: in memory of Pierre Duclos (1948-2010)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2010-11-01\n\ncollaborators.

Using the transformation properties of states and interactions under the permutation group S{sub 3} we are able to express the operator coefficients as overlap integrals, without making any assumption on the spatial dependence of the quark wave functions. The general mass operator leads to parameter free mass relations and constraints on the mixing angles that are valid beyond the usual harmonic oscillator approximation. The Isgur-Karl model with harmonic oscillator wave functions providesmoreÂ Â» a simple counterexample that demonstrates explicitly that the alternative operator basis for the 1/N{sub c} expansion for excited baryons recently proposed by Matagne and Stancu is incomplete.Â«Â less\n\nX-ray observations of Galactic H.E.S.S. sources: an update\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPuehlhofer, G.; Eger, P.; Sasaki, M.; Gottschall, D.; Capasso, M.; H.

The spectrum is well described by an exponential cut-off power law with photon index Î = 2.11 Â± 0.09stat Â± 0.10sys, and a cut-off energy of E_c = 6.0^{+2.0}_{-1.2} TeV. The TeV emission is significantly extended and overlaps with the northwestern part of the shell of the SNR G338.3-0.0. The new HESS results, a re-analysis of archival XMM-Newton data and multiwavelength observations suggest that a significant part of the Î³-ray emission from HESS J1640-465 originates in the supernova remnant shell. In a hadronic scenario, as suggested by the smooth connection of the GeV and TeV spectra, the product of total proton energy and mean target density could be as high as WpnH Ë 4 Ã 1052(d/10kpc)2 erg cm-3.\n\nA Pedagogical Look at Jeans' Density Scale\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nChu, Kwang-Hua W.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWe illustrate the derivations of Jeans' criteria for the gravitational instabilities in a static homogeneous Newtonian system for pedagogical objectives.

In order to assure the continuous operation of H.E.S.S. at its full sensitivity until and possibly beyond the advent of CTA, the older cameras, installed in 2003, are currently undergoing an extensive upgrade. Its goals are reducing the system failure rate, reducing the dead time and improving the overall performance of the array. All camera components have been upgraded, except the mechanical structure and the photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs). Novel technical solutions have been introduced: the upgraded readout electronics is based on the NECTAr analog memory chip; the control of the hardware is carried out by an FPGA coupled to an embedded ARM computer; the control software was re-written from scratch and it is based on modern C++ open source libraries. These hardware and software solutions offer very good performance, robustness and flexibility. The first camera was fielded in July 2015 and has been successfully commissioned; the rest is scheduled to be upgraded in September 2016. The present contribution describes the design, the testing and the performance of the new H.E.S.S. camera and its components.\n\nAn X-Ray Counterpart of HESS J1427-608 Discovered with Suzaku\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFujinaga, Takahisa; Mori, Koji; Bamba, Aya; Kimura, Shoichi; Dotani, Tadayasu; Ozaki, Masanobu; Matsuta, Keiko; PÃ¼lhofer, Gerd; Uchiyama, Hideki; Hiraga, Junko S.; Matsumoto, Hironori; Terada, Yukikatsu\n\n2013-06-01\n\nWe report on the discovery of an X-ray counterpart of the unidentified very high-energy gamma-ray source HESS J1427-608. In the sky field coincident with HESS J1427-608, an extended source was found in the 2-8 keV band, and was designated as Suzaku J1427-6051. Its X-ray radial profile has an extension of Ï = 0.'9 Â± 0.'1 if approximated by a Gaussian. The spectrum was well fitted by an absorbed power-law with NH = (1.1 Â± 0.3) Ã 1023 cm-2, Î = 3.1+0.6-0.5, and the unabsorbed flux FX = (9+4-2) Ã 10-13 erg s-1 cm-2 in the 2-10 keV band. Using XMM-Newton archive data, we found seven point sources in the Suzaku source region. However, because their total flux and absorbing column densities are more than an order of magnitude lower than those of Suzaku J1427-6051, we consider that they are unrelated to the Suzaku source. Thus, Suzaku J1427-6051 is considered to be a truly diffuse source and an X-ray counterpart of HESS J1427-608. The possible nature of HESS J1427-608 is discussed based on the observational properties.\n\nJean-Baptiste Labat and the buccaneer barbecue in seventeenth-century Martinique.\n\nPubMed\n\nToczyski, Suzanne\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIf, as the sociologist Pierre L. van den Berghe has suggested, cuisine is a significant expression of man's sociability, one might say that the seventeenth-century missionary Jean-Baptiste Labat was the single most social animal in the Caribbean islands in the 1690s. Although his primary responsibility on the island of Martinique was to serve the island's multiethnic population as a spiritual leader, le pÃ¨re Labat's memoirs chronicle the diverse culinary experiences of the missionary as he literally eats his way around the island, learning to prepare such delicacies as cocoa confit, roasted manatee, lizard en brochette, and parakeet en daube. Positing his unbridled interest in the culinary arts as a mark of his âobedienceâ to the duties assigned him as missionary, Labat's taxonomy of island delicacies and exotic tastes no doubt titillated the curiosity of his mainland readers while nevertheless grounding itself strongly in the values of order, authenticity, and industry so essential to Labat's apostolic mission. This article focuses on two âbuccaneer barbecuesâ as examples of gastronomical experiences through which Labat was able to construct and negotiate new social, cultural, and symbolic meanings, exploring identity politics through the frame of the culinary arts in seventeenth-century Martinique.\n\nJean Comandon Neuroscientist.\n\nPubMed\n\nLorusso, Lorenzo; Lefebvre, Thierry; de Pastre, BÃ©atrice\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe microbiologist Jean Comandon is famous for his studies on the movement of the syphilis bacteria as differentiated in various forms by ultramicroscope.

Galactic plane survey. As an identification criterion, shell morphologies that are characteristic for known resolved TeV SNRs have been used. Three new SNR candidates were identified in the H.E.S.S. data set with this method. Extensive multiwavelength searches for counterparts were conducted. A radio SNR candidate has been identified to be a counterpart to HESS J1534-571. The TeV source is therefore classified as a SNR. For the other two sources, HESS J1614-518 and HESS J1912+101, no identifying counterparts have been found, thus they remain SNR candidates for the time being. TeV-emitting SNRs are key objects in the context of identifying the accelerators of Galactic cosmic rays. The TeV emission of the relativistic particles in the new sources is examined in view of possible leptonic and hadronic emission scenarios, taking the current multiwavelength knowledge into account.\n\n[Karl Sudhoff].\n\nPubMed\n\nKÃ¤stner, Ingrid\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn 1914, from 6th May to 18th October, the International Exposition of book Industry and Graphic Arts (BUGRA) took place in Leipzig, then the world capital of books.

Collaboration\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSupernova remnants (SNRs) are prime candidates for efficient particle acceleration up to the knee in the cosmic ray particle spectrum. In this work we present a new method for a systematic search for new TeV-emitting SNR shells in 2864 hours of H.E.S.S. phase I data used for the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey. This new method, which correctly identifies the known shell morphologies of the TeV SNRs covered by the survey, HESS J1731-347, RX 1713.7-3946, RCW 86, and Vela Junior, reveals also the existence of three new SNR candidates. All three candidates were extensively studied regarding their morphological, spectral, and multi-wavelength (MWL) properties. HESS J1534-571 was associated with the radio SNR candidate G323.7-1.0, and thus is classified as an SNR. HESS J1912+101 and HESS J1614-518, on the other hand, do not have radio or X-ray counterparts that would permit to identify them firmly as SNRs, and therefore they remain SNR candidates, discovered first at TeV energies as such. Further MWL follow up observations are needed to confirm that these newly discovered SNR candidates are indeed SNRs.\n\nHESS J1640-465 - an exceptionally luminous TeV gamma-ray SNR\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEger, Peter; Ohm, Stefan\n\nHESS J1640-465 is among the brightest Galactic TeV gamma-ray sources ever discovered by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). Its likely association with the shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) G338.3-0.0 at a distance of Ë10 kpc makes it the most luminous Galactic source in the TeV regime. Our recent analysis of follow-up observations with H.E.S.S. reveal a significantly extended TeV morphology with a substantial overlap with the northern part of the SNR shell. Furthermore, the source features a seamless powerlaw spectrum over four orders of magnitude from GeV to TeV energies, with a spectral index of Gamma = 2.15Â± 0.10_mathrm{stat}Â± 0.10_mathrm{sys} and a cut-off energy of E_c = 7.3(+2.5}_{-1.8) TeV. These new spectral and morphological results suggest that a significant fraction of the TeV emission is likely of hadronic origin where the product of total proton energy and mean target density could be as high as W_p n_H Ë 4 Ã 10(52}(d/10mathrm{kpc) )(2) erg cm(-3) .

Several French surgeons are recognized as pioneers of the speciality. Pierre Mornard (1883-1929) published numerous articles of plastic and aesthetic surgery between 1925 and 1929 the date of his death. The articles were illustrated with drawings of surgery he had practiced. He described in 1929 the first abdominoplasty with umbilical transposition. Pierre Mornard can be considered a pioneer of aesthetic surgery. Copyright Â© 2016. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.\n\n75 FR 32210 - United States v.

Unique to the building is a roof structure that was specifically engineered to house ten vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) to partially offset the energy demands of the building. Despite extensive atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) wind tunnel tests to predict the flow conditions on the roof before the building was constructed, the Hess VAWTs were eventually removed after allegedly one of the turbines failed and fell to the ground. This talk presents in-situ sonic anemometry measurements taken on the roof of Hess Tower at the former turbine locations. We compare this wind field characterization to the ABL wind tunnel data to draw conclusions about building-integrated wind farm performance and prediction capability.\n\nPossible dark matter origin of the gamma ray emission from the Galactic Center observed by HESS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCembranos, J. A. R.; Gammaldi, V.; Maroto, A. L.\n\n2012-11-01\n\nWe show that the gamma ray spectrum observed with the HESS array of Cherenkov telescopes coming from the Galactic Center region and identified with the source HESS J1745-290 is well fitted by the secondary photons coming from dark matter (DM) annihilation over a diffuse power law background. The amount of photons and morphology of the signal localized within a region of few parsecs, require compressed DM profiles as those resulting from baryonic contraction, which offer Ë103 enhancements in the signal over DM alone simulations. The fitted background from HESS data is consistent with recent Fermi-LAT observations of the same region.\n\nStudies of Cosmic Ray Composition and Air Shower Structure with the Pierre Auger Observatory\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAbraham, : J.; Abreu, P.; Aglietta, M.\n\n2009-06-01\n\nThese are presentations to be presented at the 31st International Cosmic Ray Conference, in Lodz, Poland during July 2009.

Only six of these systems have been discovered. Here we report on a candidate stellar-binary system associated with the unidentified gamma-ray source HESS J1844-030, whose detection was revealed in the H.E.S.S. galactic plane survey. Analysis of 60 ks of archival Chandra data and over 100 ks of XMM-Newton data reveal a spatially associated X-ray counterpart to this TeV-emitting source (E>1012 eV), CXO J1845-031. The X-ray spectra derived from these exposures yields column density absorption in the range nH = (0.4 - 0.7) x 1022 cm-2, which is below the total galactic value for that part of the sky, indicating that the source is galactic. The flux from CXO J1845-031 increases with a factor of up to 2.5 in a 60 day timescale, providing solid evidence for flux variability at a confidence level exceeding 7 standard deviations. The point-like nature of the source, the flux variability of the nearby X-ray counterpart, and the low column density absorption are all indicative of a binary system. Once confirmed, HESS J1844-030 would represent only the seventh known gamma-ray binary, providing valuable data to advance our understanding of the physics of pulsars and stellar winds and testing high-energy astrophysical processes at timescales not present in other classes of objects.\n\nJean Baptiste Joseph Fourier\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSterken, C.\n\n2003-03-01\n\nThis paper gives a short account of some key elements in the life of Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830), specifically his relation to Napoleon Bonaparte.

A.; Zech, A.; Zechlin, H.-S.\n\n2015-02-01\n\nAims: Previous observations with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) have revealed an extended very-high-energy (VHE; E> 100 GeV) Î³-ray source, HESS J1834-087, coincident with the supernova remnant (SNR) W41. The origin of the Î³-ray emission was investigated in more detail with the H.E.S.S. array and the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Methods: The Î³-ray data provided by 61 h of observations with H.E.S.S., and four years with the Fermi LAT were analyzed, covering over five decades in energy from 1.8 GeV up to 30 TeV. The morphology and spectrum of the TeV and GeV sources were studied and multiwavelength data were used to investigate the origin of the Î³-ray emission toward W41. Results: The TeV source can be modeled with a sum of two components: one point-like and one significantly extended (ÏTeV = 0.17Â° Â± 0.01Â°), both centered on SNR W41 and exhibiting spectra described by a power law with index ÎTeV â 2.6. The GeV source detected with Fermi LAT is extended (ÏGeV = 0.15Â° Â± 0.03Â°) and morphologically matches the VHE emission. Its spectrum can be described by a power-law model with an index ÎGeV = 2.15 Â± 0.12 and smoothly joins the spectrum of the whole TeV source. A break appears in the Î³-ray spectra around 100 GeV. No pulsations were found in the GeV range. Conclusions: Two main scenarios are proposed to explain the observed emission: a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or the interaction of SNR W41 with an associated molecular cloud. X-ray observations suggest the presence of a point-like source (a pulsar candidate) near the center of the remnant and nonthermal X-ray diffuse emission that could arise from the possibly associated PWN. The PWN scenario is supported by the compatible positions of the TeV and GeV sources with the putative pulsar. However, the spectral energy distribution from radio to Î³-rays is reproduced by a one-zone leptonic model only if an excess of low-energy electrons is injected\n\nJeans instability in a universe with dissipation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKremer, Gilberto M.; Richarte, MartÃ­n G.; Teston, Felipe\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe problem of Jeans gravitational instability is investigated for static and expanding universes within the context of the five and thirteen field theories which account for viscous and thermal effects. For the five-field theory a general dispersion relation has been derived with the help of relevant linearized perturbation equations, showing that the shear viscosity parameter alters the propagating modes for large and small wavelengths. The behavior of density and temperature contrasts are analyzed for the hard-sphere model in detail. In the small wavelengths regime, increasing the amount of shear viscosity into the system forces the harmonic perturbations to damp faster, however, in the opposite limit larger values of shear viscosity lead to smaller values of density and temperature contrasts. We also consider the hyperbolic case associated with the thirteen-field theory which involves two related parameters, namely the shear viscosity and the collision frequency, the last one is due to the production terms which appear in the Grad method. The dispersion relation becomes a polynomial in the frequency with two orders higher in relation to the five-field theory, indicating that the effects associated with the shear viscosity and heat flux are nontrivial. The profile of Jeans mass in terms of the temperature and number density is explored by contrasting with several data of molecular clouds. Regarding the dynamical evolution of the density, temperature, stress and heat flux contrasts for a universe dominated by pressureless matter, we obtain also damped harmonic waves for small wavelengths. In the case of large wavelengths, the density and temperature contrasts grow with time (due to the Jeans mechanism) while the stress and heat flux contrasts heavily decay with time. For an expanding universe, the Jeans mass and Jeans length are obtained and their physical consequences are explored.\n\nKarl Marx and the Environment\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nShifferd, K.

The observational coverage of the region in very-high-energy (VHE; E > 0.1 TeV) Î³-rays benefits from deep exposure (40 h) of the neighboring open cluster Westerlund 2. The observations have revealed a new extended region of VHE Î³-ray emission. The new VHE source HESS J1018-589 shows a bright, point-like emission region positionally coincident with SNR G284.3-1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6-5856 and a diffuse extension towards the direction of PSR J1016-5857. A soft (Î = 2.7 Â± 0.5stat)photon index, with a differential flux at 1 TeV of N0 = (4.2 Â± 1.1) Ã 10-13 TeV-1 cm-2 s-1 is found for the point-like source, whereas the total emission region including the diffuse emission region is well fit by a power-law function with spectral index Î = 2.9 Â± 0.4stat and differential flux at 1 TeV of N0 = (6.8 Â± 1.6) Ã 10-13 TeV-1 cm-2 s-1. This H.E.S.S. detection motivated follow-up X-ray observations with the XMM-Newton satellite to investigate the origin of the VHE emission. The analysis of the XMM-Newton data resulted in the discovery of a bright, non-thermal point-like source (XMMU J101855.4-58564) with a photon index of Î = 1.65 Â± 0.08 in the center of SNR G284.3-1.8, and a thermal, extended emission region coincident with its bright northern filament. The characteristics of this thermal emission are used to estimate the plasma density in the region as n â 0.5 cm-3 (2.9 kpc/d)2. The position of XMMU J101855.4-58564 is compatible with the position reported by the Fermi-LAT collaboration for the binary system 1FGL J1018.6-5856 and the variable Swift XRT source identified with it. The new X-ray data are used alongside archival multi-wavelength data to investigate the relationship between the VHE Î³-ray emission from HESS J1018-589 and the\n\nIn memory of Jean-FranÃ§ois StÃ©phan\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBlanchet, RenÃ©\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis thematic issue of Comptes rendus Geoscience has been assembled to honor the memory of our late colleague and friend Jean-FranÃ§ois StÃ©phan, whose remarkable scientific and community-directed activity has left a deep imprint on both the French and the International Earth Science communities.
