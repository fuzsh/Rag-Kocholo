The 2010–11 season was Stoke City's third season in the Premier League and the 55th in the top tier of English football.

Stoke spent over £10 million in the summer of 2010 with the arrivals of Jermaine Pennant, Jonathan Walters, Marc Wilson with £8 million spent on forward Kenwyne Jones. Stoke made a bad start to the campaign losing their first three matches against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Tottenham Hotspur, and Chelsea. This was followed by wins over Aston Villa, Newcastle United and Blackburn Rovers. Stoke, however, hit poor form, losing four in a row in October and were knocked out of the League Cup by West Ham United. The club's inconsistency continued as they went through November with three victories and two draws. Poor defeats against Blackpool and Fulham in December prevented Stoke from pulling away from the bottom half of the table.
