        "text": "It was another enthralling and encapsulating season of English League football which saw Manchester United claim an unprecedented 19th league title to knock Liverpool off their perch. Chelsea sacked yet another manager while Arsenal failed to live up to the promise yet again.. Man City will play Champions League football for the first time courtesy a third place finish while Liverpool welcomed back King Kenny after 20 years and hope for the glory days to return next season.\n\nAt the other end of the table, it was a relegation dogfight with as many as six teams fighting for survival on the last day. Wigan, Wolves and Blackburn survived Survival Sunday whereas it was commiserations for boring Birmingham, poor West Ham and entertainers Blackpool.\n\nLets look as the best and the worst for each team through the course of the season.\n\nManchester United:\n\nRemembered For: Winning a record 19th league title to become the most successful club in England.\n\nPeak Point: Beating Chelsea in the potential title decider as well as the 7-1 mauling of Blackburn including a special performance from ‘five-star Berbatov’.\n\nLow Blow: Losing three out of five games in February-March including a 3-1 hammering at Anfield.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Nemanja Vidic for leading by example and being the rock in United’s defense.\n\nCould Have Done With: A better away form.\n\nCould Have Done Without: The Wayne Rooney Saga. And Bebe.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: The season has to be top notch for a team who wins the league title, especially if it knocks its fiercest rivals off their perch. Season Review.\n\nChelsea:\n\nRemembered For: A non-performing record signing and the abrupt sacking of another manager.\n\nPeak Point: Strong start to the season and a late flurry to give United a run for their money after trailing them by as many as 12 points in March.\n\nLow Blow: A 3-0 reversal at the hands of Sunderland at Stamford Bridge that started a run of 11 games without a win for the Londoners.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Petr Cech for once again being safe as a house.\n\nCould Have Done With: A ‘plan B’ in matches, an in-form Michael Essien and more than a goal from Fernando Torres.\n\nCould Have Done Without: The mysterious sacking of Ray Wilkins and offloading Ballack in the summer who could have been crucial while Lampard and Benayoun were out injured.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: Not good enough for the people who matter, but in all honesty finishing 2nd in the league cannot be considering an absolute failure. Season Review.\n\nListened to no one except Roman and yet, got fired!\n\nManchester City:\n\nRemembered For: Ending their 34-year trophy drought.\n\nPeak Point: Victory over Chelsea in the league. The FA Cup semi-final victory over United on their way to silverware was a real high.\n\nLow Blow: Rooney’s goal (of the season), was a kick in the teeth as it virtually ended City’s title aspirations.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Vincent Kompany – rock solid at the back. Carlos Tevez, who shared the Golden Boot with Berbatov was very influential as well and deserves a mention.\n\nCould Have Done With: An Italian manager capable of extracting more from a pool of highly talented players.\n\nCould Have Done Without: Kolo Toure’s drug mishap.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: Most successful season in three decades. Won the FA Cup, qualified for the Champions League. In fact, went one step ahead by securing automatic qualification ahead of Arsenal. Season Review.\n\nArsenal\n\nRemembered For: Yet another meltdown at the end of the season that saw them finish a sixth consecutive year without a trophy.\n\nPeak Point: Beating Chelsea and Man United at home in the league.\n\nLow Blow: Twice surrendering two goal leads against Spurs to gain only one point out of a possible six.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Robin Van Persie – scored 18 goals despite missing a good part of the season through injury.\n\nCould Have Done With: A fit Vermaelen – to sure up a defence that was mostly at sixes and sevens – and a fit Van Persie for the first half of the season.\n\nCould Have Done Without: Manuel Almunia.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: Unsatisfactory to say the least as another promising campaign fell way short of its mark. Season Review.\n\nTottenham Hotspur:\n\nRemembered For: Another exciting season of free flowing football making them one of the most watched teams by the neutrals.\n\nPeak Point: Beating Arsenal at the Emirates coming from a two goal deficit at half time.\n\nLow Blow: Failing to qualify for the Champions League after a great campaign this season.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Luca Modric, ahead of Bale and Van der Vaart, for sheer consistency.\n\nCould Have Done With: A striker who could score 20 goals in a season.\n\nCould Have Done Without: Gomes – The Brazilian was guilty of many horror moments for Spurs which also resulted in loss of valuable points\n\nTHT Season Verdict: Could have finished fourth, if they had put in better performances against weaker teams, especially at White Hart Lane.\n\nLiverpool\n\nRemembered For: Just about clinging on to their mantra – ‘Next season is our season’ – due to resurgence under King Kenny. Also, for being knocked off their perch!\n\nPeak Point: Thrashing champions Man United at home.\n\nLow Blow: Losing 2-0 to Everton in “their best display” that left them reeling in 19th position in the league.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Lucas Leiva for most of the season. Luis Suarez for the second half of the season.\n\nCould Have Done With: Kenny Dalglish from the summer.\n\nCould Have Done Without: An English manager incapable of adapting to a bigger club.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: If finishing sixth in the league has been celebrated, one can say it has been a very disappointing season for the club. Season Review.\n\nEverton\n\nRemembered for: Finishing in the top half of the table with such a small squad and a low budget to work with.\n\nPeak point: Come back against Man United with 2 injury time goals and win over Liverpool.\n\nLow blow: 4-1 defeat at the hands of West Brom at Goodison Park.\n\nMost valuable player: Leighton Baines was by far and away their best player and also played every minute of the league\n\nCould have Done With: A fit Louis Saha (7 goals in 14 games played), but can anybody get one?\n\nCould Have Done Without: Another shoddy start to the campaign and lengthy injuries to key players.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: If one looks at the top six, Everton were not expected to finish above any of them so overall a satisfactory season.\n\nFulham:\n\nRemembered for: Securing 8th position with such a small group of players to work with.\n\nPeak point: Qualifying for Europa League, where they had such a wonderful time in 2009-10, through fair play standings\n\nLow blow: Thrashed at home by Liverpool, Manchester City and West Ham.\n\nMost valuable player: Brede Hangeland was a rock in defence and scored valuable goals at the other end as well.\n\nCould have Done With: More games from Bobby Zamora as the tall striker added a new dimension to the attack whenever he played.\n\nCould Have Done Without: Michael Jackson statue outside Craven Cottage especially with Shankly and Busby standing outside Anfield and Old Trafford, respectively.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: Pretty Good, as a steady season with a top half finish is probably what they would have hoped for at the start of the campaign. Europa League qualification comes as a welcome bonus.\n\nAston Villa\n\nRemembered for: The bright displays by their young kids at the start of the season when senior players were injured.\n\nPeak point: Strong finish to the season with wins against Arsenal and Liverpool and also the relegation of rivals Birmingham City.\n\nLow blow: A 6-0 drubbing at St. James’ Park at the start of the the season.\n\nMost valuable player: Any one of Darren Bent, Stewart Downing or Ashley Young.\n\nCould have Done With: Darren Bent from the start of the season\n\nCould Have Done Without: Signing Robert Pires, who is a shadow of the footballer he was at Arsenal.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: A disappointing start to the campaign left them in relegation fear at one time, but the late flourish saw them finish a respectable 9th position. Yet, the fans would have loved them to finish 7th or 8th.\n\nSunderland\n\nRemembered For: Early season form that threatened to put them amongst the elite.\n\nPeak Point: Thrashing Chelsea at fortress Bridge and finishing above Newcastle.\n\nLow Blow: The 5-1 suffering at the hands of their bitter rivals left the fans hiding their faces.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Welbeck for the first part of the season, new arrival Sessegnon post January.\n\nCould Have Done With: A better medical team with almost half of the squad lying injured at one point of time.\n\nCould Have Done Without: Selling Daren Bent.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: Sunderland got the taste of reality in the latter half of the season after a flying start. They could be in for a tough next season especially with a lot of changes expected at the club.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion:\n\nRemembered For: Laying the tag of yo-yo club to rest by staying up.\n\nPeak Point: Win at Emirates and being the only team to get anything at Old Trafford.\n\nLow Blow: Mid season slump that resulted in sacking of Di Matteo.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Peter Odemwingie – He was one of the best strikers in the league this season.\n\nCould Have Done With: The relegation battling expertise of Roy Hodgson from day one.\n\nCould Have Done Without: Creating the record of no clean sheets for the longest period (29th August ’10 to 9th May’11.)\n\nTHT Season Verdict: West Brom achieved their aim of surviving the league season and they did it by playing an attractive brand of football.\n\nRelegation Specialist\n\nNewcastle United\n\nRemembered For: Coming back from 4-0 down against Arsenal to draw the game and the atmosphere at St. James’ Park which was surely missed last season.\n\nPeak Point: 5-1 win over bitter rivals Sunderland will remain in the fans’ memory for years.\n\nLow Blow: Thrashing at the hands of Bolton, Stoke and West Brom.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Cheik Tiote was a revelation in his first season.\n\nCould Have Done With: Ben Arfa for more than four games.\n\nCould Have Done Without: Sacking Chris Houghton who brought them to the League and was doing a pretty decent job as well.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: Newcastle set out to avoid relegation at the start of the season. So overall a pretty good season.\n\nStoke City\n\nRemembered For: Comment by Andy Gray about them overpowering Barcelona at the Britannia Stadium.\n\nPeak Point: 3-1 win over Arsenal in which Kenwyne Jones did what the Gunners try week in week out – Walk the ball into the net.\n\nLow Blow: Losing 3-0 to West Ham is as low as it can get.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Etherington and Pennant were brilliant as they added a new dimension to their attacking play.\n\nCould Have Done With: A good striker to partner Kenwyne Jones.\n\nCould Have Done Without: Ramsey being booed at the Britannia Stadium.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: Stoke played a physical brand of football that is getting more and more associated with them which also kept them safe from the relegation worries. Not sure about the Barcelona thing though.\n\nBolton Wanderers:\n\nRemembered For: Breaking the mould and playing in an un-Bolton like manner.\n\nPeak Point: 5-1 win over Newcastle on a day they played the most delightful football seen from them in years.\n\nLow Blow: Their disastrous finish to the season caused them to finish at a lowly 14th position in the league.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Elmander before Christmas, Sturridge after it.\n\nCould Have Done With: A better away form as they collected least points on the road.\n\nCould Have Done Without: Injury to young midfielder Holden for the final two months of the season.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: It was nice to see Bolton get out of the Allardyce mode of playing, but it could have been much better for them but for an atrocious away form.\n\nBlackburn Rovers\n\nRemembered For: The takeover by Venky’s and being linked with the likes of Ronaldinho and Beckham.\n\nPeak Point: The first half performance at Molineux to avoid relegation on the last day of the season.\n\nLow Blow: The 7-1 mauling at the hands of United at Old Trafford.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Christopher Samba was inspirational in his performances at both ends of the pitch.\n\nCould Have Done With: Appointing a more experienced manager after the sacking of Big Sam\n\nCould Have Done Without: Sacking Big Sam in the first place.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: They were lucky to survive relegation by scoring just enough points. However, they would need a new manager and a striker other than Santa Cruz.\n\nThe proof of the mauling!\n\nWigan Athletic\n\nRemembered For: Their unpredictability – Kings to Pauper in a matter of days.\n\nPeak Point: Last day heroics at the Britannia. However, the come from behind win against West Ham the previous week was equally important and ten folds more enthralling.\n\nLow Blow: Scoring just one goal in the opening six games.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Hugo Rodallega – the difference between top flight football and the obscurity of Championship.\n\nCould Have Done With: A few hundred more supporters at their games.\n\nCould Have Done Without: Forgetting to defend. Wigan were the entertainers of the league but the art of defending seemed alien to the club.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: Another year in the top flight for Wigan and more thrills and spills in store for the supporters.\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers\n\nRemembered For: Great escape at the end of the season, winning two of the last three games.\n\nPeak Point: Beating United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City at home.\n\nLow Blow: Despite beating the top teams, they were involved in the dog fight up until the last minute.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Matt Jarvis, who also earned an England call on the back of his excellent performances this season.\n\nCould Have Done With: A proper finisher that would have helped them survive relegation easily.\n\nCould Have Done Without: Mick McCarthy’s uninterpretable semi-English.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: They are a much better team than their position in the league suggests. Were difficult to beat, especially at home.\n\nBirmingham City\n\nRemembered For: Taking football to new levels of boredom.\n\nPeak Point: Winning the Carling Cup, beating favorites Arsenal. Winning against defending champions Chelsea on their home turf.\n\nLow Blow: Relegation in the most heart breaking fashion must have felt like a kick in the crotch for the Brum faithful. Pavleychenko must be the most hated guy in Birmingham circles right now.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Roger Johnson was the rock at the back for Birmingham and played his heart out for the Brum but lack of goals upfront finally condemned the Blues to Championship football.\n\nCould Have Done With: An actual striker in their starting XI. Cameron Jerome was one sorry excuse for a football player.\n\nCould Have Done Without: Scott Dan’s injury. The other half of Birmingham’s assured Center Back partnership missed the crucial phase of the league campaign and Birmingham’s season derailed alarmingly.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: Birmingham would be back amongst the big boys pretty soon but hopefully that time, the manager would look to win games rather than avoid defeats.\n\nBlackpool\n\nRemembered For: The quality of their football, their wonderfully exuberant fans and their even more outspoken manager – Ian Holloway. Blackpool were a breath of fresh air and despite not having household names in their squad, they made the English Premier League richer by their presence.\n\nPeak Point: Undoubtedly, the league double over traditional giants Liverpool.\n\nLow Blow: Relegation at the ‘Theatre of Dreams’ on the final day of the season. At one time they led the champions Man United but ultimately succumbed to pressure.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Charlie Adam – scored free-kicks, scored long rangers, scored tap-ins and even scored straight from a corner!\n\nCould Have Done With: A better bench strength; may be a couple of shrewd loan signings during the January transfer window would have ensured safety.\n\nCould Have Done Without: Letting in some cheap goals after dominating games for large periods. Blackpool surrendered some very valuable leads and in the process lost precious points in their quest for safety.\n\nTHT Season Verdict: Credit to the Club for their refreshing approach, it was a delight to have them amongst the elite of English football. All of the neutrals would be hoping for a swift return back to the top flight, but surely they would be stripped off some of their prized assets.\n\nWest Ham United\n\nRemembered For: Being easily the worst team in the league, despite having one of the players of the season as captain.\n\nPeak Point: Victory over Liverpool at Upton Park. The three-goal comeback at West Brom wasn’t bad, either.\n\nLow Blow: Conceding thrice in the second half to Wigan on the penultimate weekend that relegated them, officially.\n\nMost Valuable Player: Scott Parker easily outshone his teammates as he tried to single handedly drag the Hammers from the mire. He was also rewarded with the Writer’s Player of the Year award.\n\nCould Have Done With: At least a couple of centre-backs; and no, Mathew Upson doesn’t really count.\n\nCould Have Done Without: Trusting Avram Grant with unquestionable faith. He needed to be shown the door half-way through the season."
