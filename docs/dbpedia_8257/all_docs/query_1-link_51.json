        "text": "The club\n\nUnofficial motto\n\nAt pilam intendebat (But he was going for the ball). The new Bolton – confounding the critics to stay in the Premier League with a plucky underdog spirit and a previously unappreciated British manager. Like Sam Allardyce's side a few years ago, Stoke should be held up as an example to more vaunted yo-yo clubs of how to stay up after promotion. Subtle it is not.\n\nThe age of austerity\n\nOwned by Peter Coates, a local man who has made his fortune in online gambling, Stoke appear to be the model of a well-run set-up. Coates bought the club in a £10m deal in 2006 and has funded a cautious transfer policy since. Linked with a £12m move for Carlton Cole, which suggests money is there.\n\nWhat they want\n\nFinishing a few places clear of relegation would seem a reasonable ambition for a club with a small budget, but Tony Pulis's achievement of 12th place on the club's return to the top flight followed by 11th last season will fuel ambitions of a top-10 finish.\n\nWhat they get\n\nThat 11th place in the league was augmented by a run to the FA Cup quarter-finals, including wins over Arsenal and Manchester City. Happy to ignore the League Cup.\n\nThe players\n\nCoalition or opposition?\n\nLast season saw a series of bust-ups leaked to an amused media – from the manager allegedly head-butting James Beattie after defeat at Arsenal to Glenn Whelan and Abdoulaye Faye fighting in the dressing room after a 7-0 loss at Chelsea. However, as Pulis points out, spirit cannot be that bad in a side who have done so well.\n\nYoof of today\n\nOutside a large part of north London, Ryan Shawcross has a band of admirers, including Fabio Capello who called him up to an England squad last season despite the fact he had just been sent off for launching into a tackle that shattered the Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey's leg. Still, the 22-year-old centre-back's international hopes could benefit from England's World Cup performances.\n\nMr Stoke\n\nRicardo Fuller is a centre-forward in the Emile Heskey mould – minimum goals, maximum effort. Last season the Jamaican played 35 league games and managed three goals, although he did score in the Cup against Arsenal and Manchester City. He was once sent off for slapping his captain during a match.\n\nWho should have his benefits cut?\n\nHead-butts, fisticuffs, slaps: this is David Cameron's broken Britain writ small. All can, though, be blamed on that old favourite, \"passion\". No such defence is available for the sense of injustice felt by Beattie, who instigated grievance proceedings against Pulis months after their alleged Arsenal bust-up.\n\nEverybody loves…\n\nMatthew Etherington gambled away £1.5m before going into rehab late last year. The winger would lose up to £20,000 in a cards session in his West Ham days and continued spraying his wages around after moving to gambling magnate-owned Stoke. Not any more, though, and last season he was player of the year.\n\nThe manager\n\nLife and times\n\nPulis is on his second stint in charge, having been sacked in 2005 after three years for the unusual error of \"failing to exploit foreign markets\" in his transfer dealings. The owners then were an Icelandic consortium, so Pulis would have had the last laugh even if Coates had not reappointed him in 2006.\n\nMaster tactician or lucky general?\n\nTight at the back and direct up front. The approach attracted sneering criticism on promotion but two hugely impressive years in the Premier League are response enough. Effective it may be, but the attack are over-reliant on Rory Delap's long throws.\n\nRegrets… he's had a few\n\nAs vomiting, hypothermia and severe altitude sickness washed around him Pulis reached the summit of Kilimanjaro in May in the company of comedy's very own Nick Hancock. The charity meander up Africa's highest mountain was hit by conditions ranked by the national park's director as the worst to hit climbers in five years."
