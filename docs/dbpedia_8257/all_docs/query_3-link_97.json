        "text": "Arsenal have spent less than several English clubs between 2010-2015 but does it really matter, if we’re not winning trophies?\n\nAccording to Deloitte‘s review of football finance, Arsenal spent less on transfers between 2010 and 2015 than Manchester City (£466m), Chelsea (£326m), Manchester United (£273) and Liverpool (£211). This doesn’t come as a huge surprise considering we only bought two expensive players during that time: Mesut Ozil (£42.5) and Alexis Sanchez (£31.7).\n\nWhat does come as a shock is the fact that West Ham (£88) and QPR (£90) have spent more as well.\n\nArsenal reportedly only spent £87m between 2010/11 – 2014/15 – only £2m more than Sunderland. Well, I never.\n\nBut honestly: Who cares?\n\nOnce upon a time, we used to pride ourselves on recruiting from within and developing our own talent. We didn’t need the bucks to put together a decent squad; all we needed was one or two big names and the rest we could produce ourself. However, when your closest rivals are spending those big bucks and you’re there finishing fourth and only able to win the FA Cup… Do we really care how little we’ve spent? Does it come as adequate consolation that we haven’t won the Premier League for over a decade?"
