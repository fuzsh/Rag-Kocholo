        "text": "TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR V WEST HAM UNITED\n\nBARCLAYS PREMIER LEAGUE\n\nSUNDAY 25 NOVEMBER 2012\n\nKICK-OFF: 4PM\n\nREFEREE: ANDRE MARRINER\n\nFULL AUDIO AND TEXT COMMENTARY - WEST HAM TV\n\niPHONE APP I TWITTER I FACEBOOK I PODCAST\n\nIntroduction\n\n• West Ham United travel the seven miles to Tottenham Hotspur aiming to clinch back-to-back wins on the road following success at Newcastle United nearly two weeks ago.\n\n• Tottenham Hotspur will be hoping to bounce back from a 5-2 defeat at the hands of North London rivals Arsenal at the Emirates last Saturday.\n\n• The game will kick-off with the Hammers two points clear of Tottenham in a weekend where they could potentially go fifth in the Barclays Premier League, should other results turn in their favour.\n\n• In contrast, Tottenham could find themselves in the bottom-half of the table should they lose to West Ham and other results go against them.\n\n• West Ham's total of 19 points from their first 12 games equals their best return at this stage of a Premier League season, set in 2005-06.\n\n• West Ham's biggest away win at Tottenham came on 2 September 1981, when David Cross scored all of his side's goals in a 4-0 victory.\n\n• West Ham United and Jussi Jaaskelainen have kept the joint-most clean sheets in the Barclays Premier League this season with five. Last Monday's opponents Stoke City have also kept five clean sheets, as have Norwich City.\n\n• Tottenham Hotspur have won seven of the previous ten meetings between the two sides. West Ham United are however unbeaten in the pervious two encounters winning 1-0 on 25 September 2010 with the reverse fixture ending 0-0 at White Hart Lane.\n\nTeam news\n\nWest Ham United\n\n• West Ham United have been boosted by the return of winger Matt Jarvis to training this week. The club's record signing missed the home game with Stoke City with a hip injury. Matt Taylor will also be pushing for a start after coming off the bench against Stoke City following his recovery from a back injury.\n\n• Modibo Maiga and Gary O'Neil both started that game but one or other is likely to make way should Jarvis or Taylor be handed a starting berth.\n\n• Guy Demel and Carlton Cole were also introduced in the second half against Stoke and will have hoped to have done enough to earn a starting place.\n\n• Yossi Benayoun is set to miss out as he continues his recovery from a hip injury. Ricardo Vaz Te (shoulder), Alou Diarra (thigh) and Jack Collison (knee) are all definitely out.\n\n• Stephen Henderson (Ipswich Town), Blair Turgott (Bradford City), Dan Potts (Colchester United), Paul McCallum (AFC Wimbledon), Robert Hall and Ravel Morrison (both Birmingham City) are all out on loan.\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n• Striker Emmanuel Adebayor serves the first match of a three-game ban after being sent off against Arsenal.\n\n• Mousa Dembele is doubtful despite coming off the bench against Lazio. He midfielder is still struggling with a hip injury.\n\nLast time out\n\nMonday 19 November 2012\n\nBarclays Premier League\n\nWest Ham United 1-1 Stoke City\n\nWest Ham United: Jaaskelainen, Reid, McCartney, Tomkins, O'Brien (Demel 77), Nolan, Noble, Diame, O'Neil, Carroll (Cole 85), Maiga (Taylor 85).\n\nSubs not used: Spiegel, Collins, Spence, Hall.\n\nGoal: Gary O'Neil 48\n\nThursday 22 November 2012\n\nUEFA Europa League\n\nLazio 0-0 Tottenham Hotspur\n\nTottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Walker, Caulker, Vertonghen, Naughton, Sigurdsson (Lennon 63), Sandro, Carroll (Dembele 76), Bale, Dempsey (Defoe 63), Adebayor.\n\nSubs not used:Cudicini, Huddlestone, Dawson, Livermore.\n\nLast meeting\n\nWest Ham's last visit to White Hart Lane ended in a 0-0 draw as Spurs' top four hopes suffered a setback. Aaron Lennon and Gareth Bale went closest for the home side as they were denied by the crossbar on three occasions. The point moved Avram Grant's side out of the relegation zone above Birmingham City, West Bromwich Albion and Blackpool and up to 15th in the table. The teams that day were:\n\nTottenham Hotspur: Gomes, Bale, Gallas, Dawson, Corluka (Hutton 77), Assou-Ekotto, Lennon, Van der Vaart (Pavlyuchenko 71), Modric, Sandro, Defoe\n\nWest Ham United: Green, Upson, Da Costa, Bridge, Jacobsen, Parker, HitzlspergerN, Noble, O'Neil, Cole (Obinna 78), Ba.\n\nBackground\n\n• Saturday's lunchtime meeting will be the 137th competitive meeting between West Ham and Tottenham.
