        "text": "(CNN) -- Big-spending Manchester City have crashed out of the FA Cup, beaten 3-1 by Stoke City on Wednesday after their fifth round replay went into extra time.\n\nStoke, who knocked out Arsenal in the previous round, must now maintain their impressive run of form in the competition, as they will travel to holders Chelsea in the quarterfinals next month.\n\nThe home side went ahead with 11 minutes remaining when substitute Dave Kitson fired home afetr a superb 1-2 with Turkish international Tuncay.\n\nBut Craig Bellamy ensured the tie would go into extra time when he converted from close range after Emmanuel Adebayor chested down a Wayne Bridge cross.\n\nThere was further drama before the match went into extra time, when Adebayor was sent off for raising his arms too high on Stoke defender Ryan Shawcross.\n\nAnd it was Shawcross who put Stoke ahead again five minutes into extra time, when he rose highest to head home a trademark Rory Delap long throw.\n\nThe home side made the result safe four minutes later when Tuncay held off two defenders to fire home.\n\nThere were three other fifth round replays on Wednesday, with Champions League-chasing Tottenham and Aston Villa both securing their places in the quarterfinals.\n\nRussian striker Roman Pavlyuchenko, who has been on the fringes for Tottenham this season, followed up his two goals against Wigan on Sunday with another double as Bolton were thrashed 4-0 at White Hart Lane.\n\nBolton goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen and defender Andy O'Brien helped Tottenham on their way with a pair of own goals and Spurs now face a tricky last eight tie away to London rivals Fulham.\n\nMeanwhile, Villa, who face Manchester United in the League Cup final on Sunday, remain on course for a cup double after beating Championship side Crystal Palace 3-1.\n\nNorwegian striker John Carew scored two penalties and Gabriel Agbonlahor headed home an Ashley Young cross to send Martin O'Neill's team into a last eight trip to Reading -- the final Championship side left in the competition."
