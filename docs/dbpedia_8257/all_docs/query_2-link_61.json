        "text": "West Ham United v Chelsea\n\nBarclays Premier League\n\nBoleyn Ground\n\nSaturday 11 September 2010\n\nKick-off: 3pm\n\nReferee: Chris Foy\n\nLISTEN LIVE WITH EXCLUSIVE COMMENTARY FROM THE BOLEYN ON WHUTV\n\nIntroduction\n\n• West Ham United play host to reigning Barclays Premier League champions Chelsea in their second home league match of the 2010/11 season at the Boleyn Ground.\n\n• The Hammers are aiming to kick-start their season after tasting defeat in each of their opening three Premier League fixtures. An opening-day reverse at Aston Villa (3-0) was followed by a disappointing home reverse against Bolton Wanderers on Saturday 21 August (3-1) and a loss at Manchester United on Saturday 28 August (3-0). Avram Grant's side also defeated Oxford United (1-0) in the Carling Cup second round to set up a third-round trip to Sunderland on Tuesday 21 September.\n\n• Chelsea have made a perfect start to the new Premier League campaign, defeating West Bromwich Albion at Stamford Bridge (6-0), winning at Wigan Athletic (6-0) and securing a home win over Stoke City (2-0). Prior to that, the Blues were defeated by Manchester United in the FA Community Shield at Wembley (3-1).\n\n• West Ham United have failed to beat Chelsea in any of their last five Premier League meetings at the Boleyn Ground. The Hammers' last home victory over the Blues came on 3 May 2003, when Paolo Di Canio - a special guest of the club this Saturday - scored the only goal in a 1-0 home victory. Since then, Chelsea have won four and drawn one of their last five visits, scoring 13 goals and conceding three.\n\n• West Ham's biggest home win over Chelsea came courtesy of a 4-0 home Division Two victory on Valentine's Day 1981.\n\nSaturday's team news\n\nWest Ham United\n\n• New signings Lars Jacobsen and Victor Obinna could both make their West Ham United debuts on Saturday after joining the Hammers on transfer deadline day. Denmark full-back Jacobsen has joined the club on a permanent one-year contract from Blackburn Rovers, while Nigeria forward Obinna has linked up with the club on a season-long loan from Italian double winners and UEFA Champions League winners Internazionale.\n\n• Valon Behrami is available again after recovering from the thigh injury that has ruled him out of the start of the season. The midfielder was hurt while on international duty with Switzerland at the start of August.\n\n• Defender Tal Ben Haim could be set for his Premier League debut for the club after starting Israel's opening two 2012 UEFA European Championship qualifiers against Malta and Georgia.\n\n• New arrival Ruud Boffin, a 22-year-old Belgian goalkeeper signed from Dutch side MVV Maastricht, will be challenging Robert Green and Marek Stech this season. Boffin made his full debut for the club in a 1-0 reserve-team friendly win at Leicester City on Tuesday. Radoslav Kovac and Junior Stanislas will also hope to have impressed after playing a full 90 minutes in the same game.\n\n• Manager Avram Grant could be without Thomas Hitzlsperger after the 28-year-old picked up a thigh injury during Germany's international friendly draw in Denmark last month.\n\n• Hungary Under-21 goalkeeper Peter Kurucz has joined Jack Collison and Zavon Hines on the long-term injured list after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament while playing for the reserve team against Ipswich Town on 14 August. Kurucz has recently undergone surgery, while Collison and Hines are regular visitors to Chadwell Heath as they continue their rehabilitation.\n\nChelsea\n\n• Chelsea will hope to welcome back England duo John Terry (hamstring) and Frank Lampard (groin) after both missed the Three Lions' 2012 UEFA European Championship qualifying wins over Bulgaria and Switzerland through injury.\n\n• Portugal full-back Jose Bosingwa could also return after missing his country's 2012 UEFA European Championship qualifying matches against Cyprus and Norway with a knee injury.\n\n• Serbia 2010 FIFA World Cup defender Branislav Ivanovic is definitely out of Saturday's game after being ruled out for six weeks with a back injury that is set to sideline him until mid-October.\n\n• France Under-19 winger Gael Kakuta is out of this weekend's fixture with a back injury.\n\nPrevious meetings\n\n• The most recent meeting between the two sides was on 13 March 2010, when 41,755 supporters saw Chelsea run out 4-1 winners in a Barclays Premier League fixture at Stamford Bridge. Alex put Chelsea ahead on 16 minutes before Scott Parker levelled matters on the half-hour mark with a rasping half-volley. Second-half goals from Didier Drogba (two) and Florent Malouda settled matters.\n\nThe lineups were:\n\nChelsea: Turnbull, Ferreira, Terry, Alex, Ivanovic (Zhirkov 80), Malouda (Kalou 87), Lampard, Mikel, Ballack, Drogba, Anelka (J. Cole 66)\n\nSubs not used: Taylor, Bruma, Deco, Sturridge\n\nWest Ham United: Green, Gabbidon, Upson, Spector, Daprela, Parker, Kovac, Dyer (Cole 68), Behrami, Ilan (Diamanti 84), Mido (Stanislas 68)\n\nSubs not used: Stech, Tomkins, Collison, McCarthy\n\n• Saturday's game marks the 94th time West Ham and Chelsea have faced one another in competitive fixtures, and the 85th in the Football League and Premier League. West Ham have won 36, Chelsea 39 and there have been 18 draws. In this competition, West Ham have won 34, Chelsea 33 and 17 matches have been drawn.\n\nOverall record\n\nv Chelsea (all competitions) W 36 D 18 L 39\n\nLast time out\n\n• West Ham United were beaten 3-0 by Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday 28 August. The tea-time kick-off, which was screened live by ESPN, was evenly-contested until Jonathan Spector conceded a penalty for a foul on former team-mate Ryan Giggs on the half-hour mark, allowing Wayne Rooney to open the scoring from the spot. Second-half goals from Nani and Dimitar Berbatov secured victory for Sir Alex Ferguson's side. The closest the Hammers came to scoring was when Kieron Dyer's low shot eluded Edwin van der Sar and bounced wide off the outside of the Dutchman's post.\n\n28 August 2010\n\nBarclays Premier League\n\nManchester United 3-0 West Ham United\n\nWest Ham United: Green, Gabbidon, Upson, Spector, Ilunga, Faubert (Barrera 62), Parker, Noble, Dyer (Piquionne 76), Boa Morte (Stanislas 89), Cole\n\nSubs not used: Stech, Kovac, Da Costa, McCarthy,\n\n• Chelsea continued their perfect start to the new Barclays Premier League season by defeating Stoke City 2-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday 28 August. Florent Malouda opened the scoring on 32 minutes before Didier Drogba made sure of the Blues' third consecutive league win with a 77th-minute penalty.\n\n28 August 2010\n\nBarclays Premier League\n\nChelsea 2-0 Stoke City\n\nChelsea: Cech, Ferreira, Terry, Alex, Cole, Malouda, Lampard (Kalou 72), Mikel, Essien (Ramires 85), Drogba, Anelka (Sturridge 81)\n\nSubs not used: Turnbull, Zhirkov, Van Aanholt, Benayoun\n\nWest Ham United\n\n• West Ham United could hand debuts to Nigeria forward Victor Obinna and Denmark full-back Lars Jacobsen as new manager Avram Grant seeks his first Barclays Premier League victory of the 2010/11 season. Both have been training with the club this week - Obinna since Tuesday and Jacobsen since returning from international duty on Thursday.\n\n• Scott Parker should play his first game for the club since signing a new long-term contract on Thursday afternoon. The two-time reigning Hammer of the Year joined the Hammers from Newcastle United for £7m in July 2007. Since then, the 29-year-old has made 89 appearances in all competitions, scoring five goals.\n\n• The Hammers brought in eight new players this summer - Obinna, Jacobsen, Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger, Mexico winger Pablo Barrera, France forward Frederic Piquionne, New Zealand defender Winston Reid, Belgian goalkeeper Ruud Boffin and Israel defender Tal Ben Haim, who has arrived on loan from Grant's former club Portsmouth.\n\n• Five senior players left the Boleyn Ground during the summer transfer window - Alessandro Diamanti and Fabio Daprela both joined Italian Serie A new boys Brescia Calcio on permanent contracts. Brazilian Ilan was released at the end of his short-term contract, Egyptian Mido returned to Middlesbrough following the end of his loan spell and has since joined Ajax, while Mexican Guillermo Franco was released at the end of his one-year contract.\n\n• Teenage midfielder Josh Payne was released and subsequently joined Doncaster Rovers before being loaned to Oxford United. Academy graduate Bondz 'Gala has linked up with Plymouth Argyle on a permanent basis.\n\n• Grant managed Chelsea to the League Cup final in 2007/08. The Blues took on Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley, but despite taking the lead through Didier Drogba, a Dimitar Berbatov penalty and Jonathan Woodgate header denied Chelsea the trophy. Later that same season, Grant's Chelsea were beaten on penalties by Manchester United in Moscow in the UEFA Champions League final.\n\n• West Ham possess the tenth-best record in Premier League history. The Hammers have contested 581 matches, winning 195, drawing 146 and losing 240. West Ham have scored 681 goals and conceded 819 in those matches. In total, the Hammers have won 731 Premier League points.\n\nChelsea\n\n• Chelsea go into Saturday's game atop the Barclays Premier League table, having taken nine points from their opening three matches. The Blues have scored 14 goals in that span, conceding none. Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda have both scored four goals in three league starts, while Nicolas Anelka and Salomon Kalou have both netted twice.\n\n• Chelsea have brought in four new faces over the summer. Former West Ham United midfielder Yossi Benayoun has arrived from Liverpool, while Brazil FIFA World Cup midfielder Ramires has been snapped up from Portuguese club SL Benfica.\n\n• Croatian goalkeeper Matej Delac has joined the Blues from Inter Zapresic, being immediately loaned to Dutch club SBV Vitesse. Czech Republic Under-17 international Tomas Kalas has arrived from Sigma Olomouc, but was immediately loaned back to his former club.\n\n• Chelsea allowed six players to leave Stamford Bridge during the summer transfer window on a permanent basis. Michael Ballack moved back to Germany with Bayer 04 Leverkusen, Ricardo Carvalho rejoined former Blues boss Jose Mourinho at Real Madrid CF, while Joe Cole has joined Liverpool. Slovakia forward Miroslav Stoch was allowed to leave for Turkish club Fenerbahce, while Scott Sinclair has moved to Championship side Swansea City and striker Franco Di Santo has joined Wigan Athletic.\n\n• Nemanja Matic has joined new club-mate Delac at Vitesse on loan, while England Under-21 midfielder Jack Cork has been loaned to Burnley and Michael Mancienne has rejoined Wolverhampton Wanderers. Young goalkeeper Rhys Taylor has joined Crewe Alexandra on a season-long loan, while forward Danny Philliskirk has been loaned to League Two new boys Oxford United. Ryan Bertrand has been loaned to Nottingham Forest, while Ben Gordon has joined Kilmarnock on a temporary basis.\n\n• Didier Drogba has scored five goals in eight career appearances against West Ham United. The Ivory Coast striker has scored two hat-tricks in his last four Premier League appearances, and eight goals in his last five league matches dating back to a 2-0 win at Liverpool on 2 May 2010.\n\n• Former Hammer Frank Lampard has scored three times for Chelsea at the Boleyn Ground - including penalties in a 4-0 win in March 2008 and last season's 1-1 draw. Lampard was also sent-off in that 4-0 victory three seasons ago.\n\n• Salomon Kalou appeared at the Boleyn Ground for Ivory Coast in a 1-0 international friendly victory over Italy in August.
