They have also a Football League Cup victory from 1972 and would reach the FA Cup final for the first time in 2011. Some of the most famous player profiles in the club's history are Stanley Matthews, Neil Franklin, Gordon Banks and Ã‚ Jimmy Greenhoff.\n\nHistory\n\nThe football club was founded in 1863 as Stoke Ramblers. It became a member of the Football League at the time of its inception in 1888. Stoke was, however, outvoted after two years and had to play in Football Alliance in the 1890-1891 season before returning to the Football League again the next season. The club faced bankruptcy in 1908 and was forced to leave the Football League once again. They would return to the league in 1919 after several reapplies.\n\nBy Oscar Anderson\n\nAdvertisement"
