        "text": "A new stage adaptation of Company of Wolves\n\nCo-Directed by Theresa Heskins and Vicki Amedume MBE at the New Vic\n\nImaginative staging, evocative soundscapes, spectacular acrobatics and theatrical invention combine to bring Angela Carter’s gripping horror story to life.\n\nA dark night, in the grip of midwinter. A sense of foreboding fills the air. A girl sets off for grandmother’s house. A wolf howl echoes around the forest…\n\nHer fellow townsfolk tell tales of beasts who hunger for blood and darkness, prowling the edges of the forest path, waiting for victims. But Red Riding Hood doesn’t believe in fear. Strong-minded, armed with a carving knife and a cunning mind, she feels invincible. A chance meeting with a huntsman turns an innocent journey into a seductive and terrifying race. Locked in a battle of wills, who will win the race and claim their victim?\n\nIn this rare stage version, The Company of Wolves is filled with danger, desire and suspense – a story of terror and transformation unlike anything you have experienced before\n\nSee the New Vic website for more information"
