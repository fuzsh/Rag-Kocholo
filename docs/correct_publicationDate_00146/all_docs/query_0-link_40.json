        "text": "This play by Angela Carter features Evelyn, a misogynist English university professor who travels to New York, a city at war, in search of Tristessa, an actress of fame with whom he is obsessed. There he finds refuge in Leilah, a young woman he gets pregnant. Fearful of this, he decides to travel to the desert of Arizona, where the incredible \"The Passion of New Eve\" really begins. Here Evelyn is captured by a group of women who are part of a kind of cult in which the figure of \"Mother Goddess\" is the leader. There Mother operates Evelyn, and turns her into a beautiful woman, Eve.Shortly after her recovery, Eve escapes and ends up being kidnapped by Zero, a brutal abuser who has a harem to which he also subjects Eve. Zero accuses Tristessa of his infertility, so he goes with the harem in search of her, and when they find her he discovers that she is a man and forces him to have sex with Eve. Afterwards, there is an encounter with \"The Children\", rich young men who mount their own army to resist the forces of change. After several clashes between the various groups seeking to achieve primacy over each other, Eve will have to decide whether to continue with her new status as a woman, or go back to being the man she once was."
