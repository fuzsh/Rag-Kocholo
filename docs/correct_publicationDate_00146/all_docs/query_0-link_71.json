It is a lot to take in process & just idk...\n\nBasically, in dystopian USA, a sh*tty man runs away & falls into the hands of a goddess Eve where she transforms him into a beautiful woman. He has to live as that women & essentially face all the things that women have to face when dealing with sh*tty men. \n\nSounds like an interesting plot right? \nWell, it‚Äôs not that simple & there are a million subplots & weird things happening that I'm not even going to start to explain....\n\nTrigger Warnings: literally anything you can think of... it‚Äôs in this book - beware!\n\nThis is very much a literary & feminist writing. I feel like you could really deep dive into the symbolism, meanings, themes, & ultimate universal truths of this book. But I didn't want to do that. Carter definitely broke the mold with this one & I really just didn't like the paths she chose through this story.\n\nAll in all, I just didn't enjoy it. However, it didn't turn me off from Carter completely. I have two of her other books (that frankly I'm nervous to read) but I feel like her sweet spot (for me) will be her short story collections. \n\nI think having these boundaries pushed in a shorter capacity will allow me to enjoy the weirdness for what they are instead of getting lost in all the things I can't/don't want to follow.\n\nüî• Have you read any Angela Carter? Do you have any encouraging (or further discouraging) words?\".",
