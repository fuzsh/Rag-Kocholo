        "text": "Angela Carter’s 1977 novel The Passion of New Eve, published when the feminist revisionist myth-making movement was rapidly becoming influential,1 undermines fallacious views concerning gender difference and shows how myths serve misogynistic perceptions. Like Carter’s other subversive works that rewrite the well-known gender myths where women are portrayed as the “Other” in the heteropatriarchal context, The Passion of New Eve offers critical approaches to heteronormative understandings of gendered identities. It is an archetypal re-visionary text2 that aims “to see in another light; to re-envision or to perceive differently; and thus potentially to recast and re-evaluate” (Widdowson 496). In this heterodox work, Carter shows gendered identity construction as more contentious than is generally assumed through the process of subjectivation of the novel’s two main characters, Tristessa and Evelyn. The former is a transgender figure who proves that a male person can be transformed into a representative of the ideal feminine beauty and who helps construct and deconstruct “idealized femininity.” The latter, on the other hand, is a transsexual who possesses the ideal female body, which, according to the dominant normative view, should be seen as the only property needed to acquire gender. The widely accepted perception that gender should be compatible with the body and biological sex is the main issue that is problematized within the plot of Carter’s novel whenever the story stresses the protagonist/narrator’s gender subjectivation. The novel destabilizes the one-to-one relationship between body and gender and [End Page 113] suggests gender transitivity3 and a purely performative model of gender identity. It is a paradigm-shifting narrative, particularly in its conception of gender as performance that later gained popularity in the canon of contemporary women’s writing, both theoretical and imaginative. In her seminal Gender Trouble (1990), Judith Butler bases her gender constitution theory on social performance, claiming that gender identity is culturally constructed through repetitive acts. The Passion of New Eve was published thirteen years before Gender Trouble and eleven years before Butler’s “Performative Acts and Gender Constitution”; we therefore argue that Carter’s novel prefigures the main lines of Butler’s theory of gender as cultural construction through performance and that it is a pioneering text which has not only inspired contemporary women writers4 but has also paved the way for later feminist theoretical works.\n\nCarter’s later novels are read in light of Butler’s gender theory in a number of studies. Joanne Trevenna states that “during the 1990s, Judith Butler’s theories on the performativity of gender identity grew to dominate criticism of Angela Carter’s fiction” (267). This is because the recurring themes of cross-gendering and gender transitivity in Carter’s multiple works show her “credo that life itself is a performance and there is ultimately no distinction between authentic and inauthentic selves” (Andermahr 18). Nevertheless, compared to Carter’s other frequently cited texts, The Passion of New Eve has been given a limited amount of critical attention of the kind that specifically details the way in which this novel anticipates Butler’s theory of gender as performance — limited because The Passion of New Eve, a controversial and evasive text, is not deemed as “subversive” as the other novels in Carter’s corpus.5 One influential study is Paulina Palmer’s “Gender as Performance in the Fiction [End Page 114] of Angela Carter and Margaret Atwood,” which examines the two novelists’ ways of “adopting” Butler’s gender theory and argues that Carter’s later works, particularly her Nights at the Circus, “effectively challenge the traditional view of woman as unresisting victim” (39). Palmer defines Carter’s early works, such as The Passion of New Eve, as products of Carter’s “demythologising” venture. On the other hand, she finds the novelist’s later works more capable of giving way to “alternatives” owing to theatrical space and regards them as more suitable examples of the conceptualization of gender as acting because of their “theatrical motifs and locations” (29). Although Palmer acknowledges that The Passion of New Eve is “avant-garde and looks forward to the poststructuralist approach to gender current in the 1980s and 1990s” (30), she has reservations about its subversive function: she admits that she is not sure “whether, at this stage of her career, [Carter] regards all roles and identities as constructs” (29).6 That is why the scope of her study, covering Carter’s three later novels, The Magic Toyshop, Nights at the Circus, and Wise Children, leaves out The Passion of New Eve as an “anti-feminist” novel.7 The present study, however, aims to show how Carter’s The Passion of New Eve destabilizes essentialist conceptions of sexual categories while interrogating the authenticity of gendered subjectivity through the portrayals of both Tristessa and Evelyn and thus anticipates what Butler would later make the focus of her theoretical analyses. The feminist politics of The Passion of New Eve and Butler’s gender theory can be read as providing indirect commentary on each other. We argue that Carter offers her readers “vague” and gender-blurring identities rather than binary hierarchical oppositions based on heteronormative expectations. In light of Butler’s theory, it is possible to clarify the undecidable condition of Carter’s main characters and regard her work as reimagining gender subjectivation from a poststructuralist feminist view.\n\nThe theories of gender as performance base their arguments on “the conception of womanliness as a mask” as first expressed in Joan Riviere’s 1929 essay “Womanliness as a Masquerade,” a psychoanalytic [End Page 115] case study of “a particular type of intellectual woman” who found herself “flirting and coquetting” to mask her possession of “masculinity” (92).8 Arguing against Freud’s representation of femininity and current ideas of the development of women’s sexual life, Riviere adopts the term “masquerade” in reference to femininity and claims that women wear the mask of womanliness to gain approval and acceptance of “father figures.” She questions “the line between genuine womanliness and the ‘masquerade’” and states that there is no difference (94). Sexual manifestations, then, emerge as constructs rather than unique expressions of the inner reality. This unexpected finding shows both “genuine womanliness” and masquerading as fabrications — an assessment which makes Riviere’s psychoanalytical study a significant reference point for later feminist theorists. Thus, Luce Irigaray likewise offers a critique of Freudian psychoanalysis in her This Sex Which Is Not One, challenging, in particular, Freud’s concept of penis envy and his positioning of women, and claiming “multiplicity of female desire and female language” as opposed to man’s oneness (30). Irigaray shows how female sexuality has been constructed according to “the dominant phallic economy” (24) and hence excluded/silenced behind different masks imposed by that economy. She sees femininity as “a role, an image, a value, imposed upon women by male systems of representation. In this masquerade of femininity, the woman loses herself, and loses herself by playing on her femininity” (84). Like Riviere, Irigaray points to the function of gender masquerading in gaining women acceptance and reassurance in a male-dominated society by means of “recuperat[ing] some element of desire . . . but at the price of renouncing their own” (133): “In the masquerade, they submit to the dominant economy of desire in an attempt to remain ‘on the market’ in spite of everything” (133). Unlike Riviere, Irigaray regards “the masquerade of femininity” or woman’s “playful repetition” as a subversive tool against this silencing because “to play with mimesis” is “to try to recover the place of her exploitation by discourse, without allowing herself to be simply reduced to it” (76). By the same token, Carole-Anne Tyler claims that “male impersonation, too, has been theorized as transgressive” (32). For her, camp’s parodic accentuation of gender is a tool to “deconstruct the identity within” (33). [End Page 116]\n\nIn Gender Trouble Butler distinguishes between performativity and performance in gender identity constitution. “Performativity” is the repetition of acts and enactments of the culturally accepted norms of gender, while “performance” refers to all acts that one is supposed to comply with in terms of social gender norms: “[P]erformativity is not a singular act, but a repetition and a ritual, which achieves its effects through its naturalization in the context of a body, understood, in part, as a culturally sustained temporal duration” (Butler 2010: xv). According to Butler’s premise, masculinity and femininity are imitations that have no origin, fabrications shaped through time. Thus, for Butler, a gender’s reality depends on its theatrical performance, for repetition plays a crucial role in the process of gender constitution:\n\nGender reality is performative which means, quite simply, that it is real only to the extent that it is performed. It seems fair to say that certain kinds of acts are usually interpreted as expressive of a gender core or identity, and that these acts either conform to an expected gender identity or contest that expectation.\n\n(1988: 527)\n\nButler further argues that gender constitution cannot be considered apart from the body,9 and that bodily gestures, imitations, and acts refer to one’s gender constructed on biological sex: “Gender is the repeated stylization of the body, a set of repeated acts within a highly rigid regulatory frame that congeal over time to produce the appearance of substance, of a natural sort of being” (2010: 45). Gendered identity derives its habitualness from society’s expectations; performing gender in compliance with social conventions provides “reassurance” for the self. Performing gender inappropriately, in the wrong way in terms of social norms, on the other hand, leads to punitive consequences, social punishments including social exclusion and feelings of shame. This leads to the exclusion of those who fail to comply with the accepted gender roles; the distinction between man and woman is thus reinforced. Nonetheless, performing gender roles well does not necessarily mean that one’s sex conforms to the gender identity of the inner self. Butler notes that “[g]enders can be neither true nor false, neither real nor apparent, neither original nor derived. As credible bearers of those attributes, however, genders can also be rendered thoroughly and radically incredible” (2010: 193). Therefore, [End Page 117] socially accepted and imposed gender roles are not as stable as they are believed to be, but rather transitive and questionable.\n\nSuch problematization of the seemingly stable (and straightforward) link between biological categories and sexual identities sheds light on The Passion of New Eve and provides a vocabulary for a discussion of Carter’s strategies. Transgressing constructed orders and limits, The Passion of New Eve opens up a new space to reconsider the conventional ways of perceiving the body and gendered identity for subsequent women writers10 and for Carter’s own later fiction. The Passion of New Eve has its reverberations in Carter’s own subsequent oeuvre, shaping some recurring character portrayals and motifs in her later works, particularly in Nights at the Circus and Wise Children, where the challenge to heteropatriarchal scopic economy and gender binaries governs the writer’s feminist stance. Her critical and ironic resistance to heteronormative essentialist discourses in The Passion of New Eve and her strategy of parodic rewriting with a critical distance gives way to a refraction of normative, separatist discourses, although the characters themselves may not be seen as “playing with mimesis” per se. Moreover, although Carter is principally seen as a writer of imaginative writing, narrative for her is nevertheless “an argument studied in fictional terms” (qtd. in Easton 2000: 2). She considers her writing a feminist sort of “answering back” and always as an attempt to reveal how characteristics of gender identities are illusionary. Butler’s stance would also be a response to the strict heteropatriarchal perception of gender in binary oppositions. Her stress on new possibilities of perception of oneself in terms of gender identity would also promote chances of a more open-minded, flexible, and tolerant attitude. Like Carter, Butler would contend that a change in the viewpoint of gender identity could lead to new horizons even in policy-making processes."
