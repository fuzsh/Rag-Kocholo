        "text": "The British novelist and short-story writer, Angela Carter, was a prominent voice in the postmodern and feminist movements of the 1960’s, 70’s, and 80’s. Full of terror and wonder, Carter’s fiction discussed themes such as gender, sexuality, and the nature of stories through the genres of fantasy and horror.\n\nBorn on 7 May 1940 in Sussex Angela Olive Stalker, Carter was immediately impacted by WW2. Fearing for her safety on the southern coast, her parents sent her to live with her grandmother in Yorkshire for the duration of the war. The rest of her childhood and young adulthood was shaped by her father’s journalism career and her own struggle with anorexia nervosa, both of which later influenced her writing career. Early in her adulthood, Carter worked as a journalist while also studying Medieval Literature at the University of Bristol, from which she graduated in 1965. After graduating, Carter publishes her first book, Shadow Dance, in 1966, starting her career as a novelist.\n\nDuring this period, Carter married Paul Carter in 1960. The pair went on to have an unstable relationship, and ended up divorcing in 1970. Because of this split, Carter traveled to Japan to work as a journalist until 1973. It was during this time abroad that Carter formulated her ideas on sexuality and gender after experiencing the gender dynamics of Japan. These ideas would appear later in the decade with her most famous works, The Sadeian Woman and the Ideology of Pornography (1978),and The Bloody Chamber (1979).\n\nIn The Sadeian Woman and the Ideology of Pornography, Carter discusses the sexuality of women in the wake of Marque de Sade’s pornographic writings, arguing that Sade “treats all sexual reality as a political reality” and “declares himself unequivocally for the right of women to fuck” (SW 27). Carter envisions a “moral pornographer” who would apply the art-form to break down the tensions in gender relations, “[penetrating into] the heart of the contempt for women that distorts our culture [in order to create] a world of absolute sexual license for all the genders” (SW 18-20). Although later criticized by other feminist scholars for being simply a “pseudofeminist literary essay,” Angela Carter’s argument offered nuanced ideas on pornography and gender in an era determined to stifle sexuality (Sheets 635-636). These ideas would go on to influence the remainder of her literary work, most notably in The Bloody Chamber, which will be discussed later.\n\nAfter the publication of these two works, Carter began traveling around the world, teaching at institutes like Brown University, University of Adelaide, University of East Anglia, and University of Sheffield. In 1984, she underwent another renaissance period, publishing Black Venus, Come unto These Yellow Suns, and Nights at the Circus, as well as the adapting her story,“The Company of Wolves,” into a movie.\n\nOver the course of her career, her fiction won numerous awards, including the John Llewelyn Rhys Memorial Prize (1967), the Somerset Maugham Award (1969), the Cheltenham Festival of Literature Award (1979), and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize (1984). In 1977, Carter remarried to Mark Pierce, and the couple had a son. Angela Carter sadly died in 1992 due to breast cancer.\n\nEven after her death, however, her legacy lives on through her writings, especially through The Bloody Chamber (1979), which remains Carter’s most well-known work. This short-story collection expands upon the ideas presented in The Sadeian Woman, exploring sexuality and gender dynamics through fairy tales. While deconstructing popular tales by Charles Perrault, Carter shared in an interview that:\n\n“My intention was not to do ‘versions’ or, as the American edition of the book said, horribly, ‘adult’ fairy tales, but to extract the latent content from the traditional stories” (Haffenden).\n\nThe undercurrent of these tales was “violently sexual,” and her stories, which read like pornographic pastiches, reflect that (Sheets 642). Many stories place eroticism front and center, manipulating sexual moments to act as important plot points. For example,”The Company of Wolves” retells the story of Red Riding Hood, but climaxes in the red-caped girl seducing the wolf in order to save herself from being eaten. In these stories, women wield their sexuality for pleasure or for their own purposes instead of simply allowing male characters to impose sexuality onto them.\n\nAlthough these stories draw heavily on the erotic, they do not rely on eroticism for eroticism’s sake. At its heart, The Bloody Chamber strives to break down toxic gender dynamics enforced upon women, as I will explore through a close reading of the story, “The Lady of the House of Love.”\n\n“The Lady of the House of Love” reimagines the tale of Sleeping Beauty as a gothic horror story, transforming the fair princess into a young vampire mistress lurking in an old French chateau. In this story, Carter critiques tradition ideas of female purity by subverting the pantomime structure. A pantomime was a popular British play structure from the 17th to the mid-19th century, surrounding a certain cast of characters: a Harlequin (male hero), Columbine (female love interest), Evil Father (Columbine’s father), Evil Lover (Columbine’s designated future husband), Clown, and Fairy Godmother (Hoeckley). We are going to focus specifically on the Columbine. The Columbine figure traditionally represents purity, piety, and acts as the moral center for the pantomime play. This structure gets applied by many different writers, most notably Charles Dickens, and represents the expectations of femininity up until the 20th century.\n\nThe Lady within “The Lady of the House of Love,” who the young officer character passing by the Chateau calls a “sad Columbine” (BC 129), represents a grotesque reimagining of this figure. When this officer first meets the Lady, he views her as only a form, with the narrator describing how:\n\n“He saw only a shape . . . this shape resolved itself itself into that of, of all things, a hoop-skirted dress of white satin draped here and there with lace, a dress fifty or sixty years out of style but once, obviously, intended for a wedding. And then he saw the girl who wore the dress, a girl with the fragility of the skeleton of a moth, so thin, so frail that her dress seemed to him to hang suspended . . . a self-articulated garment in which she lived like a ghost in a machine” (BC 126)\n\nThis Lady, who the narrator also refers to as “a ventriloquist doll” (BC 129) and a “haunted house” (BC 130), is an empty thing. The characters and narrator treat her like a placeholder or form that occupies space. The Lady is caught in a state of arrested development, forever adorning her wedding dress, despite this form being out of style. Like the wedding dress, Carter argues that the columbine figure is no longer in style. At the end of this passage, Carter combines old and modern images through the ghost haunting the machine, symbolizing that this narrative construction enforced on female characters no longer makes sense or fits.\n\nAlthough the Columbine’s characterization centers around purity, this female character must also carry sexual expectations imposed upon her by male audiences. Everyone expects the Columbine to remain chaste, except for the male hero. Carter approaches this aspect by turning the Lady into a vampire. Because vampires engage with other beings through an exchange in blood, they are interpreted with sexual undertones. Like her ancestors, who “through her, project a baleful and posthumous existence” (BC 117), society expects the Lady to uphold this contradictory archetype, even though she feels a “reluctance to the role” (BC 120). This role, not only unfair to the female character, also harms those that view it. Like the vampiric Lady, it kills them in a moment of supposed intimacy.\n\nThrough the voice of the narrator, Carter argues that her Columbine figure is:\n\n“so beautiful she is unnatural; her beauty is an abnormality, a deformity, for none of her features exhibit any of those touching imperfections that reconcile us to the imperfection of the human condition. Her beauty is a symptom of her disorder, or her soullessness” (BC 119).\n\nThis conception of women is artificial and perverse, an abomination of humanity. It restrains the human connection instead of facilitating it. After presenting this image of what gender dynamics have been for the past few hundred year, Carter seeks to find another structure, having the Lady ask:\n\nAnd could love free me from the shadows? Can a bird sing only the song it knows, or can it learn a new song? (BC 130)\n\nThe Lady’s thought in this moment represents Carter’s core question of The Bloody Chamber: are narratives set and fixed, or can they be changed? Carter seems to suggest that the answer lies in character relationships and archetypes that are less exploitative, and more honest. This story climaxes in an intimate moment of human connection between the Lady and the young soldier, resulting in the Lady becoming human, which is what Carter ultimately wants: female characters to become human again.\n\nAngela Carter’s writings, at times, come across as perverse and grotesque, but they are also incredibly poetic and intimate. Carter offered clarity in areas of darkness, revealing tensions in the sex and gender issues that continue to impact literature and society today. Her stories penetrate into every aspect of life, enrapturing all who pick up her fairy tales.\n\n(Featured Image courtesy of Prospect Magazine)\n\nWork Cited\n\nCarter, Angela. The Bloody Chamber.
