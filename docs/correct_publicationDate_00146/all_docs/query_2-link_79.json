Bookers will be sent a viewing link shortly before the event and will be able to watch at any time for 48 hours after the start time.\n\nThe British writer Angela Carter created some of the greatest reworkings of traditional tales, transforming them with subversive ribaldry, extraordinary imagery, eroticism and sly humour in The Bloody Chamber (1979) and other masterpieces.\n\nOur panel explores the nature of the fairy tale tradition and its ongoing power.\n\nAmal El-Mohtar is an award-winning writer of fiction, poetry, and criticism, who has been the New York Times’s science fiction and fantasy columnist since February 2018.
