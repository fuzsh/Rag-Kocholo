Dans une lignée féministe, Carter déconstruit l’œuvre du poète – qui a atteint un statut mythique dans la culture occidentale – en recontextualisant les divers éléments de l’esthétique baudelairienne. Après avoir éclairé les théories de l’intertextualité ainsi que le concept du « bricolage » tels qu’ils se retrouvent dans le roman de Carter, nous procéderons à une analyse de la façon dont Carter retravaille à divers degrés les éléments clés qui définissent Baudelaire comme auteur canonique. Nous passons de la revisite, retrouvée dans le portrait de la ville, à la modification, à travers l’image du flâneur, pour terminer avec la perversion, dans l’exagération du dandy précieux. Cependant, la pratique de Carter ne rejette pas complètement le canon. Plutôt, ce que nous révélerons dans cet article est le rapport ambigu et complexe que l’écrivaine féministe entretient avec son prédécesseur masculin.",

        "text": "“The scrap-yard of Western Europe” : Carter and bricolage\n\n6 Gérard Genette,“Structuralism and literary criticism,” in Figures of Literary Discourse, translated (...)\n\nThe nature of bricologe is to make use of materials and tools that, unlike those of the engineer, for example, were not intended for the task at hand. The rule of bricolage is “always to make do with whatever is available” and to use in a new structure the remains of previous constructions or destructions, thus making the specific manufacture of materials and tools unnecessary, though at the cost of a double operation of analysis (the extraction of various elements from various already-constituted wholes) and of synthesis (the forming of these heterogeneous elements into a new whole in which none of the re-used elements will necessarily be used as originally intended).\n\n4The structure created by this rearrangement is not identical to the original structure, yet it functions as a description and as an elaboration of the original by the very act of rearrangement. Simply put, the bricoleur breaks down literary works into themes and motifs and inserts these components into new contexts. Consequently, elements of playfulness, improvisation and sometimes, juxtaposition, reside in the bricoleur’s work.\n\n5Indeed, Carter’s approach embraces multiplicity over singular influence, bricolage over deferential citation. As Carter explains in an interview :\n\n7 John Haffenden, “Angela Carter,” Novelists in Interview, London, Methuen, 1985, p.92.\n\nI have always used a very wide number of references because [I tend] to regard all of Western Europe as a great scrap-yard from which you can assemble all sorts of new vehicles… bricolage. Basically, all the elements which are available are to do with the margin of the imaginative life, which is in fact what gives reality to our own experience, and in which we measure our own reality.\n\n8 The Passion of New Eve is the story of a journey – one that involves both physical displacement and corporal transformation. A young Englishman, Evelyn, arrives in America in an undetermined, apocalyptic time. After mistreating a young woman and abandoning her in New York City – modeled after Baudelaire’s Paris – he rejects his life as a flâneur and flees to the desert. There he is captured by a cult of women and undergoes an involuntary sex change and becomes Eve. Reborn as a woman, enslaved and sexually abused, Eve confronts her misogynist past. She meets the retired film star Tristessa, who embodies yet subverts Baudelaire’s dandy. Now able to empathize with her, Eve no longer sees Tristessa as an object of male desire. Throughout this experiment in feminist renversement, Carter plays with Baudelaire.\n\n“Paris change ! mais rien dans ma mélancolie / N’a bougé !” : Part I, the city\n\n11Baudelaire dedicates one section of Les Fleurs du mal (1857), “Parisian scenes,” to life in the capital. At the heart of the Baudelairean interpretation of the city lie two contradictory impulses : the intention to describe and understand the city, on the one hand, and on the other hand, the wish to escape from its reality to a carefully constructed artificial paradise. Baudelaire produces formalized, rather than realistic depictions of Paris ; few specific landmarks indicate that the city he refers to is Paris. Through this strategy, the city is represented as an unreal wasteland, suspended in a void between the past and the present. In “Paris Dream,” Baudelaire describes the chaos that is the new Paris :\n\n15 Translation by Keith Waldrop, The Flowers of Evil, Middletown, Connecticut, Wesleyan University Pre (...)\n\nThis terrible landscape, such as mortal never witnessed – again this morning its image, vague and far-off, enraptured me […]\n\nBabel of staircases, of arcades, an infinite palace it was, teeming with basins, with cascades tumbling into rough or burnished gold,\n\nponderous cataracts hanging like crystal curtains, dazzling, on metallic walls.\n\nColonnades, rather than trees, surrounded still pools in which gigantic naiads, like women, admired themselves.\n\n12The poet sees Paris as a confused mass of architecture, a “Babel of staircases, of arcades,” conjuring up the image of the labyrinth. Moreover, the city is dehumanized, a sterile landscape composed of “metallic walls,” a place so wholly artificial that colonnades, not trees, grow there.\n\n13Baudelaire’s conception of the city as a place of chaos is taken up by Carter in her depiction of the apocalyptic New York City. The rational project underlying the city of New York is obscured by its progressive deterioration. “A city of visible reason – that had been the intention” (p.16), Evelyn remarks. New York is instead “an alchemical city. It was chaos, dissolution, nigredo, night” (p.16). New York, like Baudelaire’s Paris, loses nearly any topographic features of the real city. Evelyn has no point of reference for New York. “Nothing in my experience had prepared me for the city,” (p.10) he says. Where he had imagined a “clean, hard, bright city,” he finds “lurid, Gothic darkness that closed over my head entirely and became my world” (p.10). Carter’s New York City is a figure of imprisonment, an area of endemic violence and dehumanization.\n\n14Into this place of chaos, Decay and Rot sow their seeds. Putrefaction is a cherished theme of Baudelaire’s. In “Une Charogne” (signifying literally a carcass, but also meat or flesh), the poet describes in a language at once lavish and terrible, a body he encounters one morning on a walk :\n\n16 Waldrop, op. cit., p.42. In the original French the excerpt is as follows: « Le soleil rayonnait su (...)\n\nThe sun beat down on that rotten meat, as if to be sure it was well done, and to render unto Mother Nature a hundredfold all she had joined together.\n\nAnd the sky watched that superb carcass blossom like a flower, the stench so strong you thought you might fall in a faint on the grass.\n\n15Similar imagery of decay applies to New York in The Passion of New Eve. A reincarnation of “Une Charogne” occurs in Evelyn’s first impressions of New York. He says : “It was July and the city shimmered and stank […] I was astonished to see so many beggars in the rank, disordered street, where crones and drunkards disputed with the rats for possession of the choicest morsels of garbage.” (p.11). The animal imagery carries over into Carter’s interpretation: Baudelaire’s chienne that devours the rotten flesh transforms into fierce dumpster rats, vying for their share of trash. In both cases, animals feed off of human remains – whether it be flesh or refuse – in a grotesque display of carnivorism.\n\n16Furthermore, the city is quite literally crumbling around Evelyn. The revolutionary activity of the “blacks” and the “Women” inflicts destruction (they blow up wedding shops and universities) and puts a stop to services (the sewage system breaks down). All the while, the only creatures that seem to thrive are the rats, growing “fat as piglets and vicious as hyenas” (p.17). Chromatically, New York exhibits the colours of decay : it is “black,” its skies are “acid yellow” and “bitter orange,” and at the same time, “mineral green,” the colour of oxidized copper. Evelyn comes to the realization that : “The city had become nothing but a gigantic metaphor for death […]” (p.15).\n\n17 In her depiction of the city of New York, Carter transposes essential elements of Baudelaire’s conception of metropolis. Carter’s re-inscription of Baudelaire’s perception of the city would be categorized by French semiotician Laurent Jenny as a form of “weak” intertextuality. Carter makes no direct citation or reference, only allusion. However, the reappearance of the city as seen by Baudelaire (as a place of chaos and decrepitude) cannot be cast off as mere coincidence. Baudelaire is implicit in Carter’s New York City, and so the scene is set for the particular characters who inhabit Baudelaire’s city to emerge in Carter’s.\n\n“Multitude, solitude” : Part II, flânerie\n\n18 Waldrop, op. cit., 112. The original of “Le soleil” reads: « Le long du vieux faubourg, où pendent (...)\n\nAlong the old outskirts of town, where Venetian blinds in hovel hide secret lecheries, when the cruel sun strikes with redoubled ray town and country, rooftop and wheatfield, I go to practice by myself my whimsical swordsmanship, sniffing at any corner for chance rhymes, tripping over words like curbs, bumping sometimes into lines long sought in dreams.\n\n20 Keith Waldrop translation, “The Crowd” in Paris Spleen. Little poems in prose, Middletown, Connecti (...)\n\nIt is not given to everyone to blend into the multitude : enjoying the crowd is an art, and only he can gain a stroke of vitality from it, at humanity’s expense, whose good fairy at his cradle bequeathed a taste for travesty and masque, along with hatred of home and passion for travel.\n\nMultitude, solitude : equal and convertible terms […]\n\nWho walks alone with his thoughts draws a singular intoxication from this universal communion.\n\n20The flâneur indulges in the crowd, drawing from it “une ribote de vitalité,” an orgy of vitality, and finding within it the means to satisfy his “goût du travestissement et du masque.” However, intoxication with the crowd and fascination without engagement are constant reminders that the flâneur is ultimately a solitary being.\n\n21For Baudelaire, the flâneur was necessarily two things : unemployed and male. This 19th century city-traveler reappears in The Passion of New Eve in the form of Evelyn. Unemployed, Evelyn certainly is, but male – not for long. From the very first pages of the novel, Carter presents Evelyn as a wanderer. He moves from London to New York. His activities correspond with the displacement essential in flânerie. Throughout his time in New York, he is in continual motion, from banal, everyday activities – “I went to the drugstore […] to buy cigarettes” (p.19), to the climatic pursuit of the seductive Leilah through the streets at night : “We had walked for hours, for miles” (p.24). Evelyn’s impressions of New York take place exclusively at the street level, through what he sees and engages with on foot.\n\n22In another trait characteristic of the flâneur, Evelyn experiences the city from the perspective of an outsider. Despite all the upheaval happening around him, he is not a participant, he is merely an observer, dependent on his sense of sight and his sense of hearing : “I saw a team of plump and energetic rats the size of six month babies hurl themselves on a German shepherd […]” (p.17). Evelyn also gathers information by hearsay : “Dreadful tales of the exploits of their militants [the blacks] circulated the lunch-counters where I ate a midday sandwich” (p.16). Evelyn reinforces the divide between himself and his fellow city-dwellers, becoming suspicious of others : “I knew that all about me was mined ; I learned to trust nothing and nobody, not even the cop on the corner, least of all the panhandler whining for spare change as he stretched out his trembling, murderous hand.” (p.15). Like the flâneur, Evelyn widens the distance between himself and others, becoming more and more a recluse, until eventually, after the murder of his only friend the alchemist Baroslav, he realizes his near-complete solitude: “Now I was quite alone in the city” (p.18).\n\nI would go to the desert, to the waste heart of that vast country, the desert on which they turned their backs for fear it would remind them of emptiness – the desert, the arid zone, there to find, chimera of chimeras, there in the ocean of sand, among the bleached rocks of the untenanted part of the world, I thought I might find that most elusive of all chimeras, myself (p.38).\n\n24However, like Baudelaire’s flâneur who can never truly leave the urban metropolis, Evelyn cannot fully rid himself of the clutches of the city. The desert is no escape : “I was possessed. I had entirely succumbed to the dementia which had seized the city” (p.40).\n\n25 Carter takes up Baudelaire’s idea of the flâneur and removes it from its original intention as a mode of existence in the fin-de-siècle European city, only to reappear in America, in a time of apocalypse and revolution. Carter calls attention to the gender of the city ambler, who, in Baudelaire’s vision, was taken-for-granted as male. The flâneur character in The Passion of New Eve is indeed a man (and a misogynist one, at that), but as soon as he leaves the city to travel in the desert, he undergoes a physical transformation and becomes female. The desert is a feminine space for Carter, ruled by a tribe of women and created in opposition to the decaying city. The flâneur is literally emasculated once he leaves the urban space, loses his individuality and becomes a member of the collectivity, of the tribe of Beulah. Carter demonstrates that Baudelaire’s flâneur cannot exist outside of the city as a man. It is in the desert that we meet a third Baudelairean figure, that of the dandy.\n\n“La femme est… le contraire du Dandy” : Part III, the dandy\n\n26 Baudelaire, “My heart laid bare,” translated by Andrea Gogrof-Voorhees, Defining Modernism: Baudela (...)\n\nWoman is the opposite of the Dandy. Therefore she should inspire horror. Woman is hungry, and she wants to eat ; thirsty, and she wants to drink. She is in rut and she wants to get laid. What admirable qualities ! Woman is natural, that is to say abominable. Thus she is always vulgar ; the opposite, in fact, of the Dandy.\n\n29 In the desert, the new Eve crosses paths with Tristessa, a retired Hollywood film star who had been Evelyn’s object of desire in his childhood. As an actress, she indulges in a performance of highly stylized, painstakingly constructed selfhood. She corresponds to the aspect of dandyism that is utter theatrical construct, existing only in the eyes of the public and not beyond. Before his transformation, Evelyn grapples to define the actress : “Tristessa. Enigma. Illusion. Woman ? Ah” (p.6). Tristessa is a creature of theatre, disguise, and rerouted sexuality – we in fact discover later that she is a man. Like that of the dandy, her biological nature, that is to say, her virility, remains indecipherable to her audience, concealed by careful arrangement of makeup and dress.\n\n31 In Tristessa, Carter has created a caricature of dandyism. Tristessa exaggerates all aspects of the dandy : she is not just theatrical, she is melodramatically so, thus making a mockery of the dandy’s flair for the dramatic. Whereas the dandy presents himself to the world as a work of art, Tristessa transforms into an object of mass consumption, produced by Hollywood, thereby blurring the boundaries between “high” and “low” cultural products. The dandy, according to Baudelaire, is a superior, singular being and therefore cannot be reduced to a sum of money, yet if we understand Tristessa as dandy, we are confronted with a commodified dandy, the antithesis of the icon of “art for art’s sake.” Carter’s ironic re-contextualization of fragments of dandyism in the character of Tristessa opens up a space to deflate Baudelaire’s poetics by negating the uniqueness of the dandy.\n\n32 Carter corrupts Baudelaire’s dandy : Tristessa, as a man, goes beyond the general confines of dandyism, the absolute limit being androgyny, into producing a fully-fledged appearance of womanhood. Dandies would never cross-dress to the extent of becoming women, women being, as Baudelaire wrote, both too “natural” and too vulgar, for the sophistication of the dandy. In Carter’s feminist revisioning, the masculine unity of the dandyian figure is broken down and its integrity is compromised. In reincarnating a perverted version of the dandy in the character of Tristessa, Carter hijacks Baudelaire’s prized creation that epitomized the 19th century artistic temperament."
