        "text": "1940-1992\n\n\"A fairy tale is the kind of story in which one king goes to another king to borrow a cup of sugar.\"\n\nBirthplace\n\nSussex, England\n\nEducation\n\nBristol University, England (literature)\n\nOther jobs\n\nJournalist, critic (her Sadeian Woman is a surprisingly kind take on the Divine Marquis), translator (Fairy Tales of Charles Perrault).\n\nDid you know?\n\nIn 1992-3, there were more requests for Ph.D. funding on Angela Carter than on the whole of the eighteenth century.\n\nCritical verdict\n\nWith the rise of feminist theory, reclamation of folktale and world domination of magical realism, Carter became a canon in her own right. Her work developed from quirky SM faerie to looser, more accessible narratives with an interest in masquerade and transformation.\n\nRecommended works\n\nEarly Carter is well represented by The Bloody Chamber, her collection of Jungian fairy tales; Nights at the Circus, the story of Fevvers, a music-hall twirl with wings, is at once bawdy, serious and moving. See also her collection of essays inspired by her stay in Japan, Nothing Sacred.\n\nInfluences\n\nPoe, Baudelaire, the brothers Grimm, de Sade.\n\nNow read on\n\nMarina Warner's From the Beast to the Blonde plays with the theory of fairy tales as Carter plays with the practice; Jeanette Winterson's Sexing the Cherry shares Carter's dreamlike fabulism.\n\nAdaptations\n\nNeil (Crying Game) Jordan adapted Carter's short story The Company of Wolves in 1984 as a hyperreal, enticing nightmare.\n\nCriticism\n\nFlesh and the Mirror: Essays on the Art of Angela Carter, ed. Lorna Sage"
