        "text": "The present paper attempts to closely study Virginia Woolf’s Orlando in terms of Judith Butler’s concepts of gender, performativity, and agency. Woolf examines women, their struggles and positions in literary history, and their needs for independence. Themes in her works consist of gender relations, class hierarchy, and the consequences of war. In most of her novels, she moves away from the use of plot and character and, instead, emphasizes the psychological aspects of her characters. In Orlando, the protagonist lives through centuries and Woolf allows her character to transform into a female halfway during the novel. The novel is directly engaged in the women’s position and mentality through the lines, dialogues, and events. The principal question of the present study focuses on the perspectives through which gender is presented and the way it could be observed in relation to Butler’s theory of gender as performance. The current survey is further concerned with the angles through w...\n\nThis paper investigates how the age-old masculinity is subverted and interrogated by Angela Carter in her novel The Passion of New Eve. Carter rebels against patriarchy by transforming the sexual identity of the major protagonist (Evelyn), from male to female. Carter presents most of her female characters as strong and powerful where males are feeble and forced to sustain in the women' autonomy. Gender is constructed not natural which is verified through Tristessa's bogus presentation of femininity because, in fact, this character is a male. Depending on the theoretical acumens of, primarily, Foucault, Butler, Bakhtin and many other critics, the paper vindicates that gender is patriarchal product where the females are always given vulnerable positions. Teaching Evelyn a lesson means giving the novel on the hands of patriarchy by using the transgender narrative.\n\nOrlando's masculine identity is constituted through the repetition of his courageous feats of swordsmanship, his princely manners and his behaviour of a nobleman which are endowed by charismatic personality of his handsome body, his social position at the top of stratification hierarchy and his access to the privileges and power of the state. By contrast, reiteration of the conventional feminine norms of bursting into tears on slight provocation, feeling shocked at odd events and smiling involuntarily in vanity consolidate Orlando's feminine identity during the process of her becoming a woman which is geared up by her dressing in a complete outfit of an Englishwoman. What counts after all is that subjected to gender, but subjectivated by gender, Orlando's gender identity emerges only within and as the matrix of gender relations themselves.\n\nIn the presented thesis I focus on the topics related to gender in Virginia Woolf’s essay A Room of One’s Own (1929) and novel Orlando (1928). I aim to establish whether and how Woolf offers a solution to 20th-century female writers’ problems, and to decide if the offered model is effective in the fight against patriarchal oppression. Proceeding from the historical sources and literary criticism I set out the conditions of living in England in the interwar period, social relations and sex hierarchy, as well as outlining the aims of the feminism movement. Analysis of the chosen works enables me to validate whether the author follows her own advice given in A Room of One’s Own. The thesis draws on Judith Butler’s ideas regarding gender classification and the issue of performativity. I analyse the character of Orlando through the prism of Butler’s research and the situation of women, their opportunities and possibilities. It is concluded that Woolf offers women a model of society in which the qualities characteristic of female and male sex intermix. It allows women having a lifestyle typical of men, which would provide them with freedom and equality. Moreover, performativity proves that gender identity is not acquired naturally, but it is shaped culturally and socially, and undergoes changes in time and space.\n\nThis paper analyzes the deconstruction of the gender myths in Angela Carter's The Passion of New Eve. The research mainly focuses on examining the portrayal of gender as a social and cultural construct resulting from performativity. Also, the researcher centers on exploring the hollowness of the patriarchal credo that has defined and controlled the entire socio-cultural realm. In this paper, the researcher uses the theoretical frameworks of Judith Butler and Simone de Beauvoir, highlighting the notion of gender as a performance and a social construct. The paper analyzes the roles and performances of the characters and their journey of sex changes, focusing mainly on the lead character, Evelyn. Furthermore, by examining the deconstructionist approach, this paper discloses an avant-garde idea of Carter to define and remodel femininity, to accentuate the imaginary of women not limited as commodities and maternity, and to give women stand points to express their repressed power and voices."
