They decide to do something different shall we say! Then Evelyn is found in a dystopian New York.\n\nThen after a bit of trouble, he runs away the desert where he is captured by a female tribe living in the underworld city of Beulah.\n\nThis is a journey, a wild and dangerous ride through aspects of human sexuality and surrealism in cities you won’t recognise."
