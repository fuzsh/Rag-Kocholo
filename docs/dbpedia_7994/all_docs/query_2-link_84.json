        "text": "Today in History\n\nToday is Friday, Nov. 17, the 321st day of 2023. There are 44 days left in the year.\n\nToday’s Highlight in History:\n\nOn Nov. 17, 2003, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Austrian-born actor who had become one of America’s biggest movie stars of the 1980s and ’90s, was sworn in as the 38th governor of California.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1800, Congress held its first session in the partially completed U.S. Capitol building.\n\nIn 1869, the Suez Canal opened in Egypt.\n\nIn 1917, French sculptor Auguste Rodin (roh-DAN’) died at age 77.\n\nIn 1947, President Harry S.
