        "text": "Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger (born July 30, 1947[1]) is an Austrian-American former professional bodybuilder, actor, film producer, screenwriter, and director. He was the governor of the American state of California from 2003 to 2011. He currently lives in Los Angeles, California.\n\nAfter serving in the army, Schwarzenegger moved to Munich, where he often slept in a gym because he did not have anywhere else to live.\n\nSchwarzenegger then moved to the United States in 1968 and eventually became an actor. He has been in several big budget Hollywood movies including The Terminator series. He eventually stopped acting in order to run for governor of California in 2003. In 2003, Governor Gray Davis was removed as governor and Schwarzenegger was elected. His term ended in early January 2011, and he was replaced by Jerry Brown.\n\nBefore becoming an actor, Schwarzenegger was also a bodybuilder and had won both the Mr. Olympia and Mr. Universe titles over 7 consecutive times. Schwarzenegger has also set up his own official competition, Arnold Classic.\n\nIn 1971, Schwarzenegger's younger maternal half-brother Meinhard died in a car accident due to driving while drunk.\n\nIn 1986, Schwarzenegger married Maria Shriver, but they separated and divorced in 2011. They have 2 daughters, Katherine and Christina, and also 2 sons, Patrick and Christopher. Schwarzenegger also has a son with another woman. Some people think that Arnold had cheated on his wife but, such statements have not been proven."
