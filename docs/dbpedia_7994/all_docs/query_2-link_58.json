        "text": "It will share good regional environmental practices from Lower Austria with the rest of the world\n\nYesterday, Arnold Schwarzenegger opened the Austrian World Summit Solutions Hub in Asparn an der Zaya, a small town in the Federal State of Lower Austria. The action actor, who was born in Austria, collaborated with state authorities to create the centre aimed at sharing best practice examples.\n\nAccording to a statement from the state governor Johanna Mikl-Leitner, Lower Austria has 200 wind power plants currently under construction or preparation, 15,000 new PV systems and 20 new biomass projects.\n\nShe emphasised the attractiveness of the region to start-ups and small companies and collaborations with public authorities and citizens to find creative solutions for the future. The Solutions Hub in Asparn would help accelerate these practices and reach out further.\n\nWe breathe the same air, drink the same water and we need to come together\n\nThe Hollywood actor turned California governor turned climate activist was quoted by the ORF, explaining that one of the most important aspects of fighting climate change is outreach - to change peopleâ€™s minds and how they think about the problem.\n\nAt the same time, he pointed out that environmental pollution can carry a myriad of health risks due to the excessive use of fossil fuels. These include an increased likelihood of asthma in children or cancer, both highlighting the importance of finding ways for a green and sustainable living."
