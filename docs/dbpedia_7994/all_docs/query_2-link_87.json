        "text": "Vienna, Austria – Officials in Arnold Schwarzenegger’s hometown of Graz quietly and under cover of darkness removed giant metal letters spelling out his name on a soccer stadium.\n\nThe California governor had asked for his name to be stricken from the 15,300-seat arena after critics in his birthplace, where opposition to capital punishment runs high, scorned him for refusing to block this month’s execution of convicted killer Stanley Tookie Williams.\n\nLate Sunday night or early Monday, authorities in the southern Austrian city unbolted the 20 letters spelling out the action star-turned-politician’s name from Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium.\n\nThey timed the work to take advantage of the Christmas lull to avoid attracting attention “and keep the media from taking photos,” a local city hall official who declined to be named told Austrian television.\n\nCapital punishment is illegal in Schwarzenegger’s native Austria, where many people consider it barbaric.\n\nOpposition had run especially high in Graz, whose official slogan is “City of Human Rights.”\n\nAfter Williams’ Dec. 13 execution triggered a firestorm in Europe and reignited calls for Graz’s stadium to be stripped of Schwarzenegger’s name, the governor opted for a pre-emptive strike: A week ago, he dashed off a letter to local officials ordering that his name be removed and said he was returning an ornate ring of honor that Graz officials gave him in 1999.\n\nWith the Hollywood star’s name gone, the sign atop the main entrance to the stadium in Graz, about 120 miles south of Vienna, read simply, “Stadion Graz-Liebenau,” as it was known before it was renamed in Schwarzenegger’s honor in 1997.\n\nSchwarzenegger was born in 1947 in the village of Thal just outside Graz, where he began his bodybuilding career."
