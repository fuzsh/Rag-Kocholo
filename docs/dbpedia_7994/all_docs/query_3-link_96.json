        "text": "ARNOLD Schwarzenegger is an Austrian-born living legend.\n\nFrom body building, to acting and US politics - it seems that Arnie has managed to fit three lifetimes into one. We've got everything you need to know about the star...\n\nWho is Arnold Schwarzenegger and where is he from?\n\nArnold was born on July 30, 1947, making the muscly star 73 years old.\n\nBorn in Thal, near Graz, Austria, Arnold started out as a bodybuilder.\n\nHe was known as Austrian Oak due to his incredible size and height - standing at 6 foot 2 inches.\n\nLeagues ahead of his Austrian competition and with a Mr Universe win under his belt, Arnold moved to California in 1968 to compete in world-renowned bodybuilding competitions.\n\nThere, he won four more Mr Universe titles and then the prestigious Mr Olympia title six years in a row.\n\nBut Schwarzenegger didn't stop there.\n\nHe had always wanted to be an actor and finally landed his first role in 1970 movie Hercules in New York.\n\nBut his acting career was really consolidated with his roles in The Terminator franchise.\n\nAs if being the world's best bodybuilder and a Hollywood actor wasn't enough, Arnold became increasingly active with the Republican party after getting his American citizenship in 1983.\n\nThe young actor accompanied then–Vice President George H. W. Bush at a campaign rally during the 1988 race.\n\nIn 2003 he was elected governor of California in a recall election.\n\nThe wealthy star refused his Governor's salary and started out with record high approval ratings. But he left office in 2003 with some of the lowest ratings ever seen.\n\nSchwarzenegger is also the owner of Arnold's Sports Festival, an annual fitness expo held in Ohio.\n\nHe is also a savvy investor, and has launched several business ventures in the past, including opening his own restaurant in 1992.\n\nHow many children does Arnold Schwarzenegger have?\n\nSchwarzenegger married television journalist Maria Shriver, niece of President John F. Kennedy in 1986 and the pair went on to have four children.\n\nTheir first child, Katherine Eunice Schwarzenegger was born on December 13, 1989.\n\nThe second, Christina Maria Aurelia Schwarzenegger was born on July 23, 1991.\n\nThe pair went on to have two sons, Patrick Arnold, on September 18, 1993, and Christopher Sargent, on September 27, 1997.\n\nBut in 2011, it was revealed that Schwarzenegger had fathered a child, Joseph Baena, with an employee in their household, Mildred Patricia \"Patty\" Baena, 14 years prior.\n\nMaria and Arnold separated soon after the revelation\n\nWho is Arnold Schwarzenegger's girlfriend Heather Milligan?\n\nHeather Milligan is a physio who is twenty-eight years Arnold's junior.\n\nThe couple have been together since 2013 after they were spotted kissing in Santa Monica.\n\nAccording to Heather’s Twitter account, the physical therapist has her own practice called Elite Ortho Sport, where she treats professional athletes for their sports injuries.\n\nShe has even participated in Schwarzenegger’s famous strength competition, the Arnold Strongman Classic, by treating some of the participants.\n\nWhat are Arnold Schwarzenegger's most famous films?\n\nSchwarzenegger's most famous film is undoubtedly The Terminator, directed by James Cameron.\n\nThe film was such a success that he went on to star in four more films in the franchise: Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Terminator Genisys and Terminator: Dark Fate.\n\nHis face was CGI added to Terminator Salvation as he was unavailable for filming due to being California governor.\n\nHe has starred in other popular sci-fi films including Total Recall, Predator and The Running Man.\n\nYou also might have seen Arnie in Commando, True Lies, Twins, Junior and Kindergarten Cop.\n\nSchwarzenegger lends his voice to character Trench in The Expendables.\n\nWhat is Arnold Schwarzenegger's net worth?\n\nThe actor's net worth is reported to be at $400million dollars (£296million).\n\nThis comes as no surprise, since he has starred in some of the highest-grossing movies and franchises to date."
