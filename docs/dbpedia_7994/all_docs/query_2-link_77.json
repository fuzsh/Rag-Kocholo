        "text": "WHO IS ARNOLD SCHWARWENEGGER?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is a famous actor, bodybuilder and politician. He is best known for his career in bodybuilding, where he has won numerous major titles, including Mr. Olympia and Mr. Universe. He later also made a name for himself in the film industry, becoming one of Hollywood's most highly paid and appreciated actors. His best-known roles include the Terminator series and films such as Predator, Total Recall and True Lies. Schwarzenegger was also governor of California, serving from 2003 to 2011, and was elected to the Republican Party. In addition to his public career, Arnold Schwarzenegger has also had a tumultuous personal life, including his marriage to journalist Maria Shriver and the controversy surrounding the discovery of a child with another woman. He is considered one of the most influential figures in entertainment and politics.\n\nBIRTH AND FAMILY\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was born on 30 July 1947 in Thal, Austria, into a modest family. His father, Gustav Schwarzenegger, was a policeman and World War II veteran, and his mother, Aurelia Schwarzenegger, was a housewife. Arnold was the second of four children. According to Schwarzenegger, his parents were stern: \"Austria was a different world in those years. If we did something bad or disobeyed our parents, the nanny knew about us.\" He grew up in a family of devout Roman Catholics who attended church services every Sunday.\n\nCHILDHOOD AND CAREER IN BODYBUILDING\n\nFrom an early age, Schwarzenegger showed an interest in sports and bodybuilding. At the age of 14, he began bodybuilding training and quickly developed a passion and skill for the sport. \"I started weight training when I was fifteen, but I had already been participating as an athlete, in football, for four years. Although I was thin, I was well developed enough to allow me to start going to the gym and lifting weights at a competitive level.\" At the age of 20, he won the Mr Universe title, the youngest winner in the history of the competition. He went on to achieve success in bodybuilding, winning the title of Mr. Olympia, the most prestigious competition in the field, several times. Alongside his bodybuilding career, Schwarzenegger expressed a desire to become an actor.\n\nEMIGRATING TO THE UNITED STATES\n\nIn 1968 Arnold emigrated to the United States, where he won the Mr. Universe title five times and seven Mr. Olympia titles, giving up his bodybuilding career in favour of acting. He is granted American citizenship.\n\nFILM CAREER\n\nUnder the pseudonym Arnold Strong, Schwarzenegger appeared in his first film, \"Hercules in New York\", in 1970, quickly gaining fame among Hollywood actors. In 1977, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association awarded Arnold Schwarzenegger the Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year for his role in Stay Hungry.\n\nIn 1984, Arnold Schwarzenegger made cinematic history with his role in American director James Cameron's sci-fi thriller \"Terminator\". The film was a huge success, with Arnold Schwarzenegger threatening \"I'll be back!\", a phrase that quickly became popular around the world. He made good on his promise and returned with his second film \"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\" (1991) also directed by James Cameron. The series was completed in 2003 with \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\", this time directed by Jonathan Mostow.\n\nBetween 1985 and 2006, Arnold Schwarzenegger also consolidated his position in film history with other memorable films, including \"Commando\" (1985), \"Predator\" (1987), \"Twins\" (1988), \"Total Recall\" (1990), \"True Lies\" (1994), \"Eraser\" (1996), \"Collateral Damage\" (2002) and \"Cars\" (2006), among others.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, after a three-year hiatus, Arnold Schwarzenegger re-entered the film world in a big way: Terminator Salvation (2009), The Expendables (2010), The Expendables 2 (2012), Last Redemption (2013), Escape Plan (2013).\n\nPERSONAL LIFE\n\nIn 1986, Arnold Schwarzenegger married journalist and writer Maria Shriver, with whom he has four children: Katherine (b. 1989), Christina (b. 1991), Patrick (b. 1993), Christopher (b. 1997), and Joseph Baena (b. 1997), a child that Arnold learned in 2011 that he has with a former employee. In 2011, the news that he had another child, with a former employee, prompted Arnold Schwarzenegger's wife to separate from him and file for divorce.\n\nGOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA"
