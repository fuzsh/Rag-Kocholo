        "text": "I hope you did your homework and that your fear lost some of its power when you completed your risk assessment. I also know there is another fear that comes with failure. No, you won’t die. Yes, you’ll probably be right back where you started instead of falling off a cliff like you imagined. But we are social creatures, and even once you realize you’ll be safe, you’re probably horrified of being embarrassed of taking a big swing and missing. This is why the second step to conquering your fear of failure is being very honest with yourself.\n\nTerminating pollution shouldn’t be a political issue. Approximately 7 million people die from pollution around the world every year. More of our kids have asthma than ever before. We can do better than that. That’s why we bring together world leaders, but also business leaders and youth leaders. I have always wanted our summit to be an action summit where we say things people are afraid to say at the big summits, and I think when you watch my speech and, hopefully, stick around for some of the panels, you’ll agree with me!\n\nToday, I want to talk about fruit. No, not the berries I eat with my granola and yogurt. I want to focus on the difference between high-hanging fruit and low-hanging fruit. I’m sure most of you have heard the metaphor, but just so we are all on the same page: low-hanging fruit is the easy stuff.\n\nI know on a lot of the internet, people just talk about how great their life is. That’s bullshit. In the village, we are real. I think a lot of the anger we see in the world comes from that. First, like I’ve told some of you at our live meetups, bottling up your feelings is a mistake that will lead to an explosion at some point. And second, when all we share is our victories, other people start to think they are failing because they aren’t doing that well, even though they’re only seeing a snapshot of our life. I’m very proud that we don’t do that here. I try to show the way by sharing my comebacks from heart surgery and my challenges, but some of you have absolutely blown me away with the bravery you have shown as you face your struggles.\n\nToday, I want to talk about the importance of connection. We have all read articles about the loneliness epidemic, and we’ve talked many times about how part of being healthy is connection — being a part of something, belonging to something. As we’ve shared before, in an 85-year study conducted at Harvard (yes, 85 years!), social connection and belonging were some of the strongest indicators of a happy and healthy life. Here at the Pump Club, we believe that being fit and healthy isn’t just about what you do in the gym — it’s about what you do in life.\n\nYesterday was Memorial Day in America. It’s an important day for everyone. We remember all the men and women who gave their lives to make this country what it is. But it is very important to me. You all know I say I’m not self-made. I was born in Austria, made in America. I am filled with gratitude for the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice to make this country the beacon it was to me and so many others. You cannot write my life story without them.\n\nWhen was the last time you put something off because of fear? We all have big dreams, goals, and visions. But too many people find reasons not to pursue them because of what it might mean to fall short of their goals. So, I want you to think about how to start removing your obstacles and going all-in on what you want to accomplish.\n\nI’m back. Back in the gym, cleared by my doctors to start training after my pacemaker procedure. Back to filming FUBAR, with the whole gang reunited and pumped up for an even bigger second season. Since I’m making a few of my own, I thought today was a good day to talk about comebacks."
