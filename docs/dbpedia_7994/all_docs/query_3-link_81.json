        "text": "Before he was ever the Terminator or Dutch from Predator or twin brothers with Danny DeVito, Arnold Schwarzenegger was arguably the greatest bodybuilder of all-time.\n\nSchwarzenegger, one of the most famous actors on the planet who became the Governor of California in the 2000s, was Mr. Olympia seven times and Mr. Universe three times. He took lifting and bodybuilding to new popularity in the famous documentary \"Pumping Iron.\"\n\n(Apologies to Lou Ferrigno for bringing it up).\n\nArnold Sports Festival: Daily highlights beyond bodybuilding and heavy weights\n\nColumbus mask mandate: Columbus prepares to lift mask mandate, but not until after The Arnold closes\n\nAnd in 1989, in the City of Columbus, the Arnold Classic was born. It started as a bodybuilding competition and has evolved into what is now the Arnold Sports Festival.\n\nThe 2020 event was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic and 2021's event was limited to one day and was in September.\n\nHere's what you need to know the 2022 Arnold Classic and Arnold Sports Festival:\n\nWhy is the Arnold Classic, Arnold Sports Festival in Columbus, Ohio?\n\nIn the 1970s, Worthington Mayor Jim Lorimer agreed to host bodybuilding competitions.\n\nFrom the Columbus Dispatch in 2019:\n\n\"It's important to know that our relationship next year will be 50 years (old),\" Schwarzenegger said. \"It was 1970 when Jim and I met. That was the most important event of my life. It was the first bodybuilding show in which I defeated a very important competitor, Sergio Oliva, and I did it on neutral ground â€” Columbus.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger was so impressed by the show that he formed a handshake agreement to put on bodybuilding shows in Columbus starting in 1976, originally including such events as the Mr. Olympia competition.\n\nAfter a few years, the two realized they could hold a show specifically based in Columbus, and the Arnold Classic was born.\n\n\"But we never intended to have a sports festival and an exposition,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"Columbus can take a lot of credit for this, for nurturing this.\"\n\nWhere is the Arnold Sports Festival held in Columbus?\n\nThe event is held at the Columbus Convention Center.\n\nHow has Arnold Schwarzenegger not played Jim Lorimer in a movie?\n\nLorimer has been a long proponent of health and fitness along with being a local politician. But he was also an FBI agent. The now 95-year-old detailed his made-for-the-movies story in 2017:\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger will be at the Arnold Sports Festival 2022\n\nWhen an entire multi-sport competition is named after Arnold Schwarzenegger, you better believe the star of \"Conan The Barbarian\" will be there.\n\nLogan Paul will be there too\n\nYes. Logan Paul will be at the Arnold Sports Festival. He and Schwarzenegger are judging a slapping competition.\n\nYes, you read that right. No word yet if Michigan basketball coach Juwan Howard is competing.\n\nWhat is the Arnold Classic?\n\nThe Arnold Classic was the original event and one of bodybuilding's most prestigious competitions.\n\nHowever, the Arnold Classic is just one of the events at the Arnold Sports Festival. In 2019, there were 80 different events.\n\nThis year there are athletes from 64 countries and more than 1,000 vendor booths at the Arnold Expo.\n\nWho has won the Arnold Classic\n\nHere's a list of all the past champions.\n\n1989: Rich Gaspari\n\n1990: Mike Ashley\n\n1991: Shawn Ray\n\n1992: Vince Taylor\n\n1993: Flex Wheeler\n\n1994: Kevin Levrone\n\n1995: Michael Francois\n\n1996: Kevin Levrone\n\n1997: Flex Wheeler\n\n1998: Flex Wheeler\n\n1999: Nasser El Sonbaty\n\n2000: Flex Wheeler\n\n2001: Ronnie Coleman\n\n2002: Jay Cutler\n\n2003: Jay Cutler\n\n2004: Jay Cutler\n\n2005: Dexter Jackson\n\n2006: Dexter Jackson\n\n2007: Victor Martinez\n\n2008: Dexter Jackson\n\n2009: Kai Greene\n\n2010: Kai Greene\n\n2011: Branch Warren\n\n2012: Branch Warren\n\n2013: Dexter Jackson\n\n2014: Dennis Wolf\n\n2015: Dexter Jackson\n\n2016: Kai Greene\n\n2017: Cedric McMillan\n\n2018: William Bonac\n\n2019: Brandon Curry\n\n2020: William Bonac\n\n2021: Nick Walker"
