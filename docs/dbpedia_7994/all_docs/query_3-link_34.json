For me, this is not only a museum, it is also a symbol of will. Everyone has a chance.\"\n\nHundreds of fans, many dressed in the leather biker outfit of his cyborg character, gathered to catch a glimpse of the 64-year-old.\n\nThe ex-governor of California, who began his career as a bodybuilder, unveiled a bronze statue of himself, which he commissioned himself earlier this year."
