        "text": "As I went through the revision of Sva-likhita-jīvanī, I spent a lot of time putting in footnotes, since I recognized that many of the names would be unfamiliar to readers, especially his Bengali contemporaries. Of course, these notes are brief and in some cases entirely inadequate. Here is one, for instance, that simply could not have been included in full, so I thought I would put it here.\n\nWhen Bhaktivinoda Thakur's first wife died in 1861, he writes that this poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow helped him. \"I endured this grief like a warrior according to the 'Psalm of Life'.\"\n\nNo doubt it was Rev. Dall (also a New Englander) who introduced BVT to Longfellow). Somewhat ironically, it seems that it was the New England Unitarians and Transcendentalists who appealed the most to Bhaktivinoda rather than their British equivalents like Wordsworth. I think that Longfellow's lyrical style appealed to him more.\n\nI think that anyone reading this and knowing the Thakur's poem to Haridas Thakur will recognize similarities in style and even substance. So for the record, for comparison's sake and for the pleasure of my readers, I have included the two poems he wrote in Puri in 1871 on the sāragrāhī theme, which was one of the main ideas supporting his \"progressive\" concept of religious development and shed light on that important concept.\n\nA Psalm of Life\n\nWhat The Heart Of The Young Man Said To The Psalmist.\n\nTell me not, in mournful numbers,\n\nLife is but an empty dream!\n\nFor the soul is dead that slumbers,\n\nAnd things are not what they seem.\n\nLife is real! Life is earnest!\n\nAnd the grave is not its goal;\n\nDust thou art, to dust returnest,\n\nWas not spoken of the soul.\n\nNot enjoyment, and not sorrow,\n\nIs our destined end or way;\n\nBut to act, that each to-morrow\n\nFind us farther than to-day.\n\nArt is long, and Time is fleeting,\n\nAnd our hearts, though stout and brave,\n\nStill, like muffled drums, are beating\n\nFuneral marches to the grave.\n\nIn the world’s broad field of battle,\n\nIn the bivouac of Life,\n\nBe not like dumb, driven cattle!\n\nBe a hero in the strife!\n\nTrust no Future, howe’er pleasant!\n\nLet the dead Past bury its dead!\n\nAct,— act in the living Present!\n\nHeart within, and God o’erhead!\n\nLives of great men all remind us\n\nWe can make our lives sublime,\n\nAnd, departing, leave behind us\n\nFootprints on the sands of time;\n\nFootprints, that perhaps another,\n\nSailing o’er life’s solemn main,\n\nA forlorn and shipwrecked brother,\n\nSeeing, shall take heart again.\n\nLet us, then, be up and doing,\n\nWith a heart for any fate;\n\nStill achieving, still pursuing,\n\nLearn to labor and to wait\n\nBhaktivinoda;s poems were written ten years later, in 1871 when he took his duties in Jagannath Puri. The theme of a sāra-grāhī were dominant in his early thought and is indeed a concept that anyone following him should be familiar with.\n\nSaragrahi Vaishnava\n\nAlas, for those who spend their days\n\nIn festive mirth and joy.\n\nThe dazzling, deadly, liquid forms\n\nTheir hearts fore'er employ.\n\nThe shining bottles charm their eyes\n\nAnd draw their heart's embrace;\n\nThe slaves of wine can never rise\n\nFrom what we call disgrace.\n\nWas man intended to be\n\nA brute in work and heart?\n\nShould man, the Lord of all around,\n\nFrom common sense depart?\n\nMan's glory is in common sense\n\nDictating us the grace,\n\nThat man is made to live and love\n\nThe beauteous Heaven's embrace.\n\nThe flesh is not our own, alas,\n\nThe mortal frame a chain;\n\nThe soul confined for former wrongs\n\nShould try to rise again.\n\nWhy then this childish play in that\n\nWhich cannot be our own;\n\nWhich falls within a hundred years\n\nAs if a rose ablown.\n\nOur life is but a rosy hue\n\nTo go ere long for naught;\n\nThe soul alone would last fore'er\n\nWith good or evil fraught.\n\nHow deep the thought of times to be!\n\nHow grave the aspect looks!\n\nAnd wrapt in awe become, O, we,\n\nWhen reading Nature's books.\n\nMan's life to him a problem dark,\n\nA screen both left and right;\n\nNo soul hath come to tell us what\n\nExists beyond our sight.\n\nBut then a voice, how deep and soft,\n\nWithin ourselves is felt,\n\nMan! Man! Thou art immortal soul!\n\nThee Death can never melt.\n\nFor thee thy Sire on High has kept\n\nA store of bliss above,\n\nTo end of time, thou art Oh! His-\n\nWho wants but purest love.\n\nO Love! Thy power and spell benign\n\nNow melt my soul to God;\n\nHow can my earthly words describe\n\nThat feeling soft and broad?\n\nEnjoyment, sorrow-what but lots\n\nTo which the flesh is heir?\n\nThe soul that sleeps alone concludes\n\nIn them it hath a share.\n\nAnd then, my friends, no more enjoy\n\nNor weep for all below;\n\nThe women, wine, and flesh of beasts\n\nNo love on thee bestow.\n\nBut thine to love thy brother man\n\nAnd give thyself to God,\n\nAnd God doth know your wages fair-\n\nThis fact is true and broad.\n\nForget the past that sleeps and ne'er\n\nThe future dream at all,\n\nBut act in times that are with thee\n\nAnd progress thee shall call.\n\nBut tell me not in reasoning cold\n\nThe soul is made alone\n\nBy Earth's mechanic lifeless rules\n\nAnd to destruction prone.\n\nMy God who gave us life and all\n\nAlone the soul can kill,\n\nOr give it all the joys above\n\nHis promise to fulfill.\n\nSo push thy onward march, O soul,\n\nAgainst an evil deed,\n\nThat stands with soldiers Hate and Lust-\n\nA hero be indeed.\n\nMaintain thy post in spirit world\n\nAs firmly as you can,\n\nLet never matter push thee down-\n\nO stand heroic man.\n\nO Saragrahi Vaishnava soul,\n\nThou art an angel fair;\n\nLead, lead me on to Vrindaban\n\nAnd spirit's power declare.\n\nThere rest my soul from matter free\n\nUpon my Lover's arms-\n\nEternal peace and spirits love\n\nAre all my chanting charms.\n\nI think the line of influence is quite clear -- the reference to heroism in particular, just as in Longfellow's poem.\n\nOn Haridas Samadhi [A Saragrahi Vaishnava]\n\nO! Born of Moslem parents, Haridas!\n\nAnd trained in youth in Moslem creed,\n\nThy noble heart to Vaishnava truth did pass!-\n\nThy holy acts thy candour plead!\n\nIs there a soul that cannot learn from thee\n\nThat man must give up sect for God?-\n\nThat thoughts of race and sect can ne'er agree\n\nWith what they call Religion broad?\n\nThy love of God and brother soul alone\n\nBereft thyself of early friends,-\n\nThy softer feelings oft to kindness prone\n\nLed on thyself for higher ends!!\n\nI weep to read that Kazees and their men\n\nOft persecuted thee, alas!\n\nBut thou didst nobly pray for th' wicked then!\n\nFor thou wert Vaishnava Haridas!!\n\nAnd God is boundless grace to thee, O man!\n\nUnited thee to one who came\n\nTo save the fallen souls from Evil's plan\n\nOf taking human souls to shame.\n\nAnd he it was who led you all that came\n\nFor life eternal, -holy, -pure!\n\nAnd gave you rest in Heaven's enduring name\n\nAnd sacred blessings ever sure!\n\nThy body rests upon the sacred sands\n\nOf Swargadwar near the sea,\n\nOh! Hundreds come to thee from distant lands\n\nT' enjoy a holy, thrilling glee!\n\nThe waters roar and storming winds assail\n\nThy ears in vain, Ah! Vaishnava soul!\n\nThe charms of Brindaban thy heart regale,\n\nUnknown the wheel of time doth roll!!\n\nHe reasons ill who tells that Vaishnavas die\n\nWhen thou art living still in sound.\n\nThe Vaishnavas die to live and living try\n\nTo spread a holy life around!\n\nNow let the candid man that seeks to live\n\nFollow thy way on shores of time,\n\nThen posterity sure to him will give\n\nLike one song in simple rhyme!\n\nDespite the various controversial issues I have highlighted about Bhaktivinoda Thakur's life, which would certainly make it seem as though I am making an attempt to undermine his reputation, I don't see things that way. I continue to think of him as a really amazing person and definitely one of those highly accomplished individuals who manages to juggle a responsible career with copious intellectual creativity on the side. In short, an inspiration to me spiritually.\n\nThose who worked in the Indian Civil Service were frequently such accomplished men, whether British or Native. Bhaktivinoda Thakur's appeal to his employers consisted of far more than his academic credentials -- for he had few. It seems that he was able to converse with them in an intelligent way.\n\nHe was writing English poetry in a very sophisticated classical style even at 17, He wrote his Poriade in two parts and published it, and proudly gave it to whomever he met, like Raj Mehtab of Burdwan, and Alexander Duff..\n\nHis reading was very extensive. He pretty much went through everything that was available. It does not seem that British India was very far behind developments in English thought and literature of the time,\n\nIt is something of a wonder that he did not go the way of all the people who surrounded him, contemporaries like Keshub Chandra Sen, Dwijendranath Tagore, Satyendranath Tagore, Nabagopal Mitra,, etc., and become a figure remembered by Bengalis to this day as a part of the Bengal Renaissance. For most Bengalis, Chaitanya Vaishnavism was part of the problem, something that belongs to the superstitious past and is certainly not something that reveals the highest ideals or concepts of human development.\n\nWell, that is our subject when we talk about Bhaktivinoda. As people who take the essence through the natural revelation that comes through sahaja-samadhi, we are bound to extract the essence from Gaudiya Vaishnavism. That is the intellectual task that he set for us. He would accept, I should think, the critiques as necessary for progressive thought.\n\nSee also this article from 2007,"
