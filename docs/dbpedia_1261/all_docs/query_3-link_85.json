        "text": "To the people’s surprisein 2006, when the Left Front under the leadership of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee won a decisive mandate, many believed that the Left ruling seemed to be impossible to change. Mamata Banerjee virtually became the face of the anti-Left movement in the state. In the 2011 state assembly election, the All India Trinamool Congress(TMC), under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee, won a majority and the TMC-Congress alliance winning a 3/4th mandateended the 34-year rule of the Left Front government. Congress though soon broke away from TMC. In all the subsequent elections, TMC has virtually swept the field. Now in 2016, the Congress-Left alliance has suddenly come up as a big challenge to the TMC in the West Bengal legislativeassembly election. Just a quick look, to say, legislative assembly election just ended on 5th May 2016 and counting is few days left, where 6.55 crore voters will decide the luck of the 294 members of the State Assembly in West Bengal. This 2016 Election has distinguished features in many aspects that need to be mentioned here.\n\nThe West Bengal TMC government will look to highlight its achievements. Some of its achievements have been the establishment of relative peace and tranquillity in the Jangalmahal and hilly areas of the state. The once volatile Gorkhaland movement has now significantly subsided and the Maoist stranglehold in the tribal belt has been loosened. Besides, there are many things to show the people of the West Bengal, schemes like Kanyashree (for women empowerment), Yubashree (for youth empowerment), Sobuj Sathi (cycle distribution to students), Kisan Mandi (Farmer’s special market) etc. have had some positive impact.\n\nOn the downside, due to TMC government's rigid land acquisition policies, industry hasn't really gotten any fillip. It has been a difficult phase for the state and even Finance Minister Amit Mitra, who was once part of the corporate echelon, hasn't managed to do much. The opposition is always eager to point out this lacuna, alongside their allegations of a reign of terror unleashed by the Mamata Banerjee where the police act as a silent or, in some cases, a willing accomplice. Besides, Sarada scam, Narada sting scam, Onging-construction Bridge collapse in Kolkata, Syndicate, Group conflict within TMC, Congress-Left alliance, Farmers dissatisfaction, service man’s dissatisfaction over many issues including DA issue and compulsory presence on the day of Bandh, Collections by either police or party men from the traders, businessmen or commercial vehicle owners, unruly behavior in institutions like Colleges and Universities, all needs to be counted.\n\nScams are important issue in 2016 election campaign. The Sarada scam, in which the names of several top TMC leaders surfaced, some were questioned, some in jail, was also touted to be a big electoral issue. The Narada sting operation, which showed five Lok Sabha and One Rajya Sabha TMC MPs and some MLAs allegedely accepting cash from representatives of a fictitious company.\n\nThe Narada sting operation has led to complications for TMC as party leaders are in dilemma about taking legal course against the news portal responsible for it and how to handle the controversy. Soon after the release of the Narada sting video footage in circulation, it was said from the TMC party that the video footage was as manufactured.\n\nTMC chief national spokesman Derek O’Brien said, while responding a question regarding this, “There is nothing to ask. We are busy with elections — the first phase is just few days away. This is not the time to give in to any attempt to disrupt the campaign. We will not digress from the agenda of development.” The party also asked its members to stay away from the media.\n\nTMC MP Sugata Bose have been among those vocal about the image the sting has left the party with. TMC vice president Dinesh Trivedi was of the view that the party members should get its name cleared. To mention, Trivedi has faced action earlier for going against the party. He was sacked from his railway minister's post by Mamata Banerjee during the UPA-II regime, within hours of hiking fares in the railway budget without the consent of the TMC chief Mamata Banerjee. This time, both Trivedi and Saugata Bose disobeyed party orders and stayed away from a protest agitation against the government at the Gandhi statue in Parliament premises. Mamata Banerjee has got into a damage control mode, after party MP and former railway minister Dinesh Trivedi spoke out publicly against the Narada sting scam.\n\nMathew Samuel, the journalist who shot the sting video, was employed with Tehelka during much of the period over which it was made, rejected video footage manufactured theory and submitted all the documents to the Calcutta High Court which asked while listening a PIL case.\n\nThe collapse of an under-construction bridge in Girish Park area of North Kolkata in March 2016, which resulted in the death of 26 people, became a major national event with the army called in for rescue operations. Though the construction of the bridge started during the Left era, questions are still being asked about why the Mamata administration didn't take cognizance earlier. The Congress and BJP have hit out at the state government.\n\nIndividuals like Ambikesh Mahapatra, a chemistry professor at the Jadavpur University, working against the TMC who was arrested in April 2012 for circulating a spoof on the chief minister. He is Contesting as an Independent candidate from Behala East. He has formed 'Aakranta Aamraa' (We the Victims), a forum of alleged victims of human rights violations and atrocities under TMC’s rule. Question arises, how much impact it has on the ruling party TMC, but to mention that Mahapatra is not alone in his fight against Mamata Banerjee. Not only his fellow victims but almost the entire opposition - the Left Front and the Congress as well as civil society members - have extended support to him.\n\nMuslim voters matter. Mamata Banerjee has been carefully nurturing the community since she came to power. She offered salaries to the Imams and Muazzins even after fighting a legal battle. Muslims comprise around 27 per cent of the total population in west bengal, being the second-largest community and also the largest minority group.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal_Legislative_Assembly_election,_2016 - cite_note-15Three districts in the state have Muslim majority votes, Malda, Murshidabad, and North Dinajpur whereas in districts like Birbhum, Burdwan, North and South 24 Paraganas, Nadia and Cooch Behar it is more than 25 percent. Altogether out of 294 assembly seats 95 seats are such in the state that have a sizeable deciding Muslims with about 30-40 percent of voters. TMC forged alliances with Muslim outfits like the Jammat-e Ulema-Hind (JuH) to an extent that the influential general secretary of the JuH Siddiqullah Chowdhury contesting on TMC ticket from Mongolkote constituency of Burdwan district, although JuH has its own political outfit, the People’s Democratic Conference of India (PUCI). Abdul Razzak Mollah, former veteran from the fold of CPI(M), switched sides and is contesting from Bhangor, his old constituency in South 24 Paraganas. The theory of personality in leadership is important factor, but the way they were fielded, the personality factor may not work there. Mamata is aggressively targeting the Modi-led central government during her last days of campaign in Burdwan, Birbhum and Malda. She has been vicious towards “Modi” and the “recent national issues” that can polarize minority votes in her favour.\n\nThe West Bengal Assembly Election 2016 has taken a dramatic turn. The Left Front and the Congress have buried their hatchet to come together with the aim of ousting the Mamata Banerjee government. The Congress and Left alliance is widely known as “Manusher Jot” (Peoples alliance) reminds the famous quotation of Karl Marx, “you have nothing to loose but chains…” is applicable as the Left has nothing to loose, but possible gains, as they are not in a position to fight against TMC, so everything is fair in politics. Whatever be the case this alliance is a great challenge to the ruling party TMC. Just after this alliance came into existence, in almost all the political campaign of TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee most of her time she spents on attacking the Congress-Left alliance, saying as unholy alliance and reminds the historical conflict between the Congress and the Left.\n\nIt is claimed that the Congress – Left alliance has \"disturbed the poll arithmetic\" of Trinamool Congress and that is why it has sought shelter from BJP. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhary, the state Congress president alleged that in order to save her party from corruption cases from \"Sarada to Narada, she has taken shelter in the BJP camp. The BJP is shielding them (TMC) in corruption cases. Both are playing a fixed match and trying to fool the people\".\n\nTo say, all surveys so far have predicted that TMC is slated to win the elections. But the gap in vote share between the ruling party and Cong-Left alliance is extremely thin. If the alliance worked on ground and if there is an effective transference of vote (Left voters supporting Congress and vice-versa), an upset cannot be completely ruled out. In the Lok Sabha elections, TMC got 39 per cent votes, Congress 9 per cent and the Left got 30 per cent. But the fact that the Left and Congress fought separately led to a landslide for TMC. That scenario may change completely this time. To keep in mind the above issues from Sarada to Narada and the Congress-Left coalition, and the role of Election Commission – so far done well as they claimed, it seems difficult, if not impossible to retain the power for the ruling party. We have to wait till 19th may 2016 when the counting begins, to see in which way the wind blows and who laughs at the end.\n\nAssistant Professor, Department of Political Science, Chandidas Mahavidyalaya, Khujuti Para, Birbhum, The University of Burdwan, West Bengal.
