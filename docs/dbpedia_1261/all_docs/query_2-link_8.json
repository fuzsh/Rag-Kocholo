Most important our HOD and assistant professors are very student-friendly. Their teaching method is very simple. They have taken regular classes and many extra classes. They are very communicative, adaptable, and dedicated to teaching us. We had one main exam every year. Because in our time, the system was 1+1+1. The exams were difficult if you don't study.\n\nCourse Curriculum Overview :\n\nI have chosen this course because this course and subject was many careers in future and job the national language in my country.
