        "text": "About Us\n\nChandidas Mahavidyalaya was established in 1972 at the village Khujutipara under Nanoor Police Station in the district Birbhum with a motto to educate the youth for making them employable, socially responsible and ethically correct for their holistic development with the pace of changing local as well as global perspective. The college was named after the medieval poet of Humanity of 14th Century, Chandidas, who was famous for his lyrics in Vaishnava padavali. It grew out of the long-standing desire and struggle of the people of this underdeveloped area for higher education. The sapling they planted has now branched out in many directions, now blossoming forth with colours and fragrance. The college has since its inception steadily evolved in terms of its human and infrastructural resources. It is affiliated to the University of Burdwan. It breathes natural air of human relations among students and the staff beyond the boundary that prides in it. The college has been accredited by NAAC in 2011 & 2016."
