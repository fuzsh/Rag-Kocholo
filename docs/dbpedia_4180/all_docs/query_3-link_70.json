        "text": "About the CECM\n\nThe Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics (CECM), a Simon Fraser University research centre within the Departments of Mathematics and Statistics and Actuarial Science, is located at SFU's Burnaby Campus in British Columbia (Canada).\n\nCECM's mandate is to explore and promote the interplay of conventional mathematics with modern computation and communication in the mathematical sciences. The Centre provides a sophisticated but easy to use computational environment for research and collaboration in the mathematical sciences. Its resources are available to all its members and, where possible, to other interested individuals both at Simon Fraser and elsewhere via associate memberships and the Internet.\n\nInformation about Graduate Studies in Mathematics at SFU.\n\nCECM News\n\nCECM '04; A day of Mathematics and Computation.\n\nCECM '04 was held in the Halpern Centre at SFU, July 27th, 2004. We had four invited talks by George Labahn (University of Waterloo), Roman Nedela (Slovak Acadamy of Sciences), Victor Flynn (University of Liverpool) an Richard Crandall (Centre for Advanced Computation, Reed College). A talk on the new Maple release, Maple 9.5 given by Michael Monagan (CECM) and Allan Wittkopf (Maplesoft). Ten posters were presented. Four poster prizes were awarded to Ben Ong, Jennifer de Kleine, Mohammad Ebrahimi and Frank Chu.\n\nCECM's Researcher Wins Major Award.\n\nAdrian Lewis, director of CECM's Analysis and Applied Optimization Group, has been awarded the prestigious Lagrange Prize in Continuous Optimization for 2003. This honour was awarded jointly by the Mathematical Programming Society and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics at the 18th International Symposium on Mathematical Programming, Copenhagen, August 18, 2003."
