        "text": "Eleanor in the Village contends that Eleanor Roosevelt's association with New York's Greenwich Village and the friends she made there had a major impact on the formation of her personal identity outside of her marriage to Franklin. I had hoped to learn details about her activities in the Village.\n\nJan Jarboe Russell gives readers a brief biography of Eleanor's entire life, which for a reader like myself who has read numerous books on Eleanor and Franklin was a recap of known history. She does give space to the many friendships Eleanor made with Village friends, particularly lesbian friends who were very special to her. She shared her private getaway Val Kill with one lesbian couple, and taught in a school opened one of the partners. A female journalist became her close friend and lived in the White House for a time.\n\nRussell mentions the activities that spurred Hoover to open a secret FBI file on her: support of unions and workers and civil rights activities considered communist or socialist in those days. Pages of those files are still unlocked.\n\nI wanted to know more about her activities in the village. I was disappointed by the lack of depth. Russell mentions that Eleanor knew writers living in the Village, like Thomas Wolfe. I sure wanted to know more about this!\n\nAn interesting point is Russell's interpretation of Eleanor's relationships with both lesbian friends, like Lorena Hick, and men she loved, including her body guard, doctor, and Joe Lash. As she does also with Franklin's relationship with Missy LeHand, his 'office wife'. Most biographers admit there is no concrete evidence that any of these relationships were sexual in nature or romantic on the Roosevelts' side. Russell is surer.\n\nWhat is clear is that after Eleanor discovered her husband's affair with her personal secretary, she formed her own 'families' to love, becoming closer to these people than her own children.\n\nEleanor's story of personal growth is inspiring. That the 'ugly' child from a dysfunctional family, whose mother-in-law ruled her home and life, and whose husband betrayed her, turned out to be a respected, world renowned humanitarian leader could be a fairy tale. But there was no magic involved. With dear friends and strength of will, Eleanor transformed her life.\n\nI would recommend this biography to those who are not familiar with Eleanor Roosevelt. In fact, it would be a good first biography for young adults.\n\nI received a free egalley from the publisher through NetGalley. My review is fair and unbiased.\n\nEleanor in the Village: Eleanor Roosevelt's Search for Freedom and Identity in New York's Greenwich Village\n\nby Jan Jarboe Russell\n\nScribner\n\nPub Date March 30, 2021\n\nISBN: 9781501198151\n\nhardcover $28.00 (USD)\n\nfrom the publisher\n\nA vivid and incisive account of a mostly unknown yet critical chapter in the life of Eleanor Roosevelt—when she moved to New York’s Greenwich Village, shed her high-born conformity, and became the progressive leader who pushed for change as America’s First Lady.\n\nHundreds of books have been written about FDR and Eleanor, both together and separately, but yet she remains a compelling and elusive figure. And, not much is known about why in 1920, Eleanor suddenly abandoned her duties as a mother of five and moved to Greenwich Village, then the symbol of all forms of transgressive freedom—communism, homosexuality, interracial relationships, and subversive political activity. Now, in this fascinating, in-depth portrait, Jan Russell pulls back the curtain on Eleanor’s life to reveal the motivations and desires that drew her to the Village and how her time there changed her political outlook.\n\nA captivating blend of personal history detailing Eleanor’s struggle with issues of marriage, motherhood, financial independence, and femininity, and a vibrant portrait of one of the most famous neighborhoods in the world, this unique work examines the ways that the sensibility, mood, and various inhabitants of the neighborhood influenced the First Lady’s perception of herself and shaped her political views over four decades, up to her death in 1962.\n\nWhen Eleanor moved there, the Village was a neighborhood of rogues and outcasts, a zone of Bohemians, misfits, and artists. But there was also freedom there, a miniature society where personal idiosyncrasy could flourish. Eleanor joined the cohort of what then was called “The New Women” in Greenwich Village. Unlike the flappers in the 1920s, the New Women had a much more serious agenda, organizing for social change—unions for workers, equal pay, protection for child workers—and they insisted on their own sexual freedom. These women often disagreed about politics—some, like Eleanor, were Democrats, others Republicans, Socialists, and Communists. Even after moving into the White House, Eleanor retained connections to the Village, ultimately purchasing an apartment in Washington Square where she lived during World War II and in the aftermath of Roosevelt’s death in 1945.\n\nIncluding the major historical moments that served as a backdrop for Eleanor’s time in the Village, this remarkable work offers new insights into Eleanor’s transformation—emotionally, politically, and sexually—and provides us with the missing chapter in an extraordinary life.\n\nI listened to the audiobook of Home Fire by Kamia Shamsie which I purchased through Chirp. I congratulate the narrator for her clarity and her ability to voice the characters so clearly and elegantly.\n\nThe story begins when a British Muslim woman, Isma, is studying in America and runs into a man she knew about from home, the son of a man prominent in British politician who has dissociated himself from his Muslim heritage; he was also responsible for the death of her father who had become a jihadist. With the death of her mother, Isma raised her younger twin siblings Aneeka and Parvaiz. Now they are grown, she is finishing her studies.\n\nIsma comes to like Eamonn, although his wealth and privilege has protected him. He is recalled to Britain where he meets the beautiful Aneeka, who makes use of his attraction to insinuate herself into his life. For she has need of power to bring her twin brother home after he was groomed and lured into the jihadist world.\n\nA modern retelling of Antigone, the story is a wonderful exploration of family bonds versus the political and societal prejudices that force immigrants to choose between their cultural and religious heritage and assimilating into Western society.\n\nHome Fire\n\nby Kamila Shamsie\n\nread by Tania Rodrigues\n\nPenguin Random House\n\nRelease Date: August 15, 2017\n\nUnabridged Audiobook $15.00\n\nPUBLISHER DESCRIPTION\n\nLonglisted for the 2017 Man Booker Prize\n\nThe suspenseful and heartbreaking story of an immigrant family driven to pit love against loyalty, with devastating consequences\n\nIsma is free. After years of watching out for her younger siblings in the wake of their mother’s death, she’s accepted an invitation from a mentor in America that allows her to resume a dream long deferred. But she can’t stop worrying about Aneeka, her beautiful, headstrong sister back in London, or their brother, Parvaiz, who’s disappeared in pursuit of his own dream, to prove himself to the dark legacy of the jihadist father he never knew. When he resurfaces half a globe away, Isma’s worst fears are confirmed.\n\nThen Eamonn enters the sisters’ lives. Son of a powerful political figure, he has his own birthright to live up to—or defy. Is he to be a chance at love? The means of Parvaiz’s salvation? Suddenly, two families’ fates are inextricably, devastatingly entwined, in this searing novel that asks: What sacrifices will we make in the name of love?\n\n*****\n\nI have seen I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith mentioned as a favorite by many across social media. I picked up the 1948 edition at a library sale, and after seeing the movie based on it, decided I needed to read this book this winter as an anodyne to the anxiety of the pandemic.\n\nThe novel consists of journal entries by a young woman on the verge of womanhood who observes her family and her surroundings with great insight, with love, but also objectivity. She is able to dissect and identify the foibles of her family. Her self-awareness is quite remarkable as she struggles with her desires, her relationships, and even her faith (or lack of faith).\n\nI think the intimacy of the novel allows so many readers to identify with the heroine.\n\nThis is not a novel of big ideas or high adventure, twists, or thrills. It is human in scale. Smith writes with an awareness of human frailty; her scenes of great amusement and humor do not diminish her characters. These are characters we care about. They are original, vivid, and conflicted.\n\nI can see why so many have enjoyed this novel. It certainly was a balm.\n\n*****\n\nThe opposite of a comforting read is Hamnet: A Novel of the Plague by Maggie O'Farrell. The story of William Shakespeare's wife and family makes for the best kind of historical fiction, a literary gem that transports readers into another world that is alien and yet very familiar, thanks to the depth of the characters.\n\nO'Farrell imagines William meeting and falling in love with Agnes, a strange woman who practices herbal remedies and wanders alone through the fields and woods with her pet falcon.\n\nWilliam's unhappiness with rural life inspires Agnes to suggest he expand his father's business in London, where he becomes involved with he theater. He supports his family and visits several times a year, while Agnes raises their children.\n\nO'Farrell follows the path of the plague across the world until it reaches Agnes's twin children. Hamnet's protectiveness of his twin leads to dire consequences.\n\nThis story of grief is one more 2020 book whose timing was serendipitous. At a time when millions mourn, O'Farrell has given us a luminous story of grief.\n\nHamnet is a Top Ten Best Books of 2020 by the New York Times, and winner of the Women's Prize for Fiction.\n\nI purchased a copy of the book.\n\nI know the story well.\n\nFirst, because I had read James Tobin's biography The Man He Became: How FDR Defied Polio to Win the Presidency. And from reading numerous other books about Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nAnd yet, I felt the tension and expectation stirring as I read Tobin's middle school biography of how Franklin Roosevelt met the challenge of infantile polio with extraordinary perseverance.\n\nAs Al Smith pressured FDR to run for governor of New York State in a desperate bid to maintain Democratic votes for his presidency, Missy LeHand, FDR's secretary and 'office wife' whispers \"Don't you dare!\" for she knew what was at stake.\n\nWith more time in therapy at Warm Springs, FDR might walk again. If he returned to his home state and full time work, his chances to walk without crutches or braces was nil.\n\nFDR had to choose between his personal goal to beat polio and his political hopes. The moment was now--was it worth the cost?\n\nTobin's ability to describe the medical information about polio and how it affected FDR's body is excellent. Young readers will understand the science and the emotional and social impact of the disease. FDR being 'crippled' meant he had to defy compartmentalization by society, politicians, and especially by voters.\n\nThere was no hiding his disability. He had to wear heavy leg braces, use crutches, canes, and wheelchairs, and had to be lifted into cars.\n\nHe turned the indignity into a demonstration of his strength and positive energy. He lifted his head, smiled, kept an upbeat attitude, communicating that being 'lame' did not affect his mind and his ability to work hard. In fact, he inspired people.\n\n\"Through those twelve dark years of pain and upheaval, Roosevelt's leadership was the beacon in the darkness. Because he evidently believed that all would be well in the end, people took hope. And it was no small thing that they knew he had come through a great personal ordeal.\"~Master of his Fate by James Tobin\n\nTobin informs about FDR's failings, including his troubled marriage, his distance as a father, times he became angry. He was not perfect. But that is the wonderful thing--imperfect humans can impact and change the world for the better.\n\nThe book is also a political history, tracing FDR's career and how his political relationship with Al Smith, and his nomination speech, brought him to public attention.\n\nFranklin Roosevelt is consistently rated as one of our greatest presidents for leading the country through perilous times and for social programs that we take for granted today.\n\nYoung readers will understand how polio changed FDR's life and made him a better person, and that we can rise above the cards we have been dealt.\n\nI was given a free ebook by the publisher through NetGalley. My review is fair and unbiased.\n\nMaster of His Fate: Roosevelt's Rise from Polio to the Presidency\n\nby James Tobin\n\nMacmillan Children's Publishing Group\n\nHenry Holt and Co. (BYR)\n\nPub Date: March 23, 2021\n\nISBN : 9781627795203\n\nhardcover $19.99 (USD)\n\nfrom the publisher\n\nMaster of His Fate by James Tobin is an inspiring middle-grade biography of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, with a focus on his battle with polio and how his disease set him on the course to become president.\n\nIn 1921, FDR contracted polio. Just as he began to set his sights on the New York governorship—and, with great hope, the presidency—FDR became paralyzed from the waist down. FDR faced a radical choice: give up politics or reenter the arena with a disability, something never seen before. With the help of Eleanor and close friends, Roosevelt made valiant strides toward rehabilitation and became even more focused on becoming president, proving that misfortune sometimes turns out to be a portal to unexpected opportunities and rewards—even to greatness.\n\nThis groundbreaking political biography richly weaves together medicine, disability narratives, and presidential history.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nJames Tobin is an award-winning biographer and the author of the adult book The Man He Became: How FDR Defied Polio to Win the Presidency, as well as the children's books The Very Inappropriate Word and Sue MacDonald Had a Book. He won the National Book Critics Circle Award in biography for Ernie Pyle’s War and the J. Anthony Lukas Work-in-Progress Award for To Conquer the Air: The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight. He teaches narrative nonfiction in the department of media, journalism, and film at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.\n\nRelated books about FDR and his life that I have reviewed\n\nThe Gatekeeper: Missy LeHand, FDR, and the Untold Partnership that Defined a Presidency by Kathryn Smith\n\nhttp://theliteratequilter.blogspot.com/2016/09/fdrs-office-wife-and-many-loves-of.html\n\nFrank and Al: FDR, Al Smith, and the Unlikely Alliance That Created the Modern Democratic Party\n\nby Terry Golway\n\nhttps://theliteratequilter.blogspot.com/2018/09/frank-al-fdr-al-smith-and-unlikely.html\n\n\"I don't know how to explain to her that I am cornered by memories, caged in my recollection.

The officials. The contact at a magazine who publishes her writing.\n\nShe is recognized as 'other', Arab, Muslim. She is a refugee in England. People fear her. Or, they want to know things she holds close, the people lost and the atrocities of war and her escape across Europe. The experiences that left her enveloped by silence.\n\nTrauma took her voice. Communicating only in the written word, she becomes \"The Voiceless.\"\n\nThe only reasonable response was to fill myself up with silence.~from Silence is a Sense by Layla AlAmmar\n\nShe looks out the windows of her apartment and observes the occupants of the other apartments. She knows their secrets. But she keeps apart until a horrendous crime evokes a response that frees her.\n\nLayla AlAmmar's novel Silence is a Sense brilliantly delves into the soul of a woman who has lost everything, first by the war that destroyed her world, and then by her harrowing flight across borders, only to find there is no safe harbor even in freedom.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe's fable Silence informs the work, the narrator committing it to memory. \"My heart pounds to the rhythm of his cadence,\" she thinks as she recites it in her head.\n\nFront-piece in Vol. Seven of the 1904 Commemorative Edition of The Works of Edgar Allan Poe\n\nI picked up my grandfather's set of Poe to read the fable and noted images that appear in AlAmmar's novel. Poe describes a place where giant water lilies shriek in a yellow river, and forests quake in windless skies, and a crimson moon lights the view. A being in desolation is subjected to beating rain and roaring hippopotami, then by a profound silence by the Demon who tells the tale. The man hurriedly flees in terror.\n\nThe fable speaks to the narrator who has also been terrorized and left in silence.\n\nFor AlAmmar's protagonist, silence is the only sane reaction to atrocity. We don't need detailed descriptions of what she endured, for her reaction tells us all we need to know.\n\nWhat do we see when we look at refugees, immigrants, people who look different from us, or who worship differently from us? Do we think of their legacy of losses?\n\nOur immigrant ancestors kept their stories quiet, they did not tell us of the death camps or the burned villages, the rape and torture when they were powerless. We wrap these things in silence.\n\nWe demand stories and hope to hear pretty tales, happy endings.\n\nAt the end of the novel, our heroine speaks her name, has found her voice. There is hope of healing.\n\nI received a free ARC from the publisher in exchange for a fair and unbiased review.\n\nSilence Is a Sense\n\nby Layla AlAmmar\n\nAlgonquin Books\n\nPub Date: March 16, 2021\n\nISBN: 9781643750262\n\nhard cover $25.95 (USD)\n\nfrom the publisher\n\n“Lyrical, moving, and revealing.\"~Tracy Chevalier, bestselling author of Girl with a Pearl Earring\n\nA transfixing and beautifully rendered novel about a refugee’s escape from civil war—and the healing power of community.\n\nA young woman sits in her apartment, watching the small daily dramas of her neighbors across the way. She is an outsider, a mute voyeur, safe behind her windows, and she sees it all—the sex, the fights, the happy and unhappy families. Journeying from her war-torn Syrian homeland to this unnamed British city has traumatized her into silence, and her only connection to the world is the column she writes for a magazine under the pseudonym “the Voiceless,” where she tries to explain the refugee experience without sensationalizing it—or revealing anything about herself.\n\nGradually, though, the boundaries of her world expand. She ventures to the corner store, to a bookstore and a laundromat, and to a gathering at a nearby mosque. And it isn’t long before she finds herself involved in her neighbors’ lives. When an anti-Muslim hate crime rattles the neighborhood, she has to make a choice: Will she remain a voiceless observer, or become an active participant in a community that, despite her best efforts, is quickly becoming her own?\n\nLayla AlAmmar, a Kuwaiti-American writer and brilliant student of Arab literature, delivers here a complex and fluid book about memory, revolution, loss, and safety. Most of all, Silence is a Sense reminds us just how fundamental human connection is to survival.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nGrowing up in Kuwait, I often – some might say too often – found solace in the pages of a book; and if it was a really good book, it would soon become more of a best friend—lovingly read over and over again.\n\nI also began writing at a very early age, from poems to articles to bits and pieces of stories, and I always had this vague, ethereal idea of being published one day.\n\nI completed an MSc in Creative Writing from the University of Edinburgh in 2014 and soon after completed my first full-length novel. I began a PhD on the intersection of Arab women’s fiction and literary trauma theory in 2019.\n\nI’ve had short stories published by the Evening Standard, Quail Bell Magazine, Aesthetica Magazine, the St Andrews University Prose Journal, and in the collection Underground: Tales for London (Borough Press 2018). My story \"The Lagoon\" was shortlisted for the Aesthetica Magazine Creative Writing Award 2014. I was British Council International Writer in Residence at the Small Wonder Short Story Festival in 2018.\n\nMy debut novel, THE PACT WE MADE, which deals with the lives of young women in Kuwait, was published by Borough Press in March 2019. My second novel, SILENCE IS A SENSE, was published in Spring 2021 (Borough/Algonquin).\n\nMy home is filled with heirlooms and mementos, each associated with a person or time from my past. Wherever we moved, settling these things into the house transformed it into a home.\n\nSome of these things make me a little sad, but most make me happy. I have good memories of the student lamp from Great-Grandma's house, the 1842 ogee clock we bought at our first auction, the cracked glass miniature vases Mom set on her knick-knack self, the fourth generation back heirloom Blue Flow soup bowls, the embroidery mom made for me, the Japan figures gifted to my husband on his birth.\n\nVery few people look at these things and feel the things I feel when I see them.\n\nBut...what if the emotions people feel could attach to their things and be sensed by others? What if these emotions changed those who encounter the objects? What if some people could sense this emotional baggage and use it for harm or health?\n\nKim Neville's debut novel The Memory Collectors imagines people with the special ability to sense the emotions that cling to things.\n\nEv tries to control it, suppressing the effects of the 'stains' on things. She saw how her father fell victim to dark stains. She was unable to save her parents from the evil that overtook him. She has tried to protect her younger sister, Noemi, who flits in and out of her life.\n\nHarriet has hoarded these stained things. They are overwhelming her and affecting her neighbors, too. Perhaps she could make a museum filled with good feelings, a place of healing? When she mets Ev, she knows she has found the person who can help her.\n\nWe can hide from the past, suppress it, reject it. We can become enslaved to the past so it inhibits our growth. We can shape the past into works of art. And we can rise above the past to become changed and whole people.\n\nThe Memory Collectors is a fantastic story that uses fantasy to explore our common human struggle with the past and the lingering emotions that inhibit our growth.\n\nI received a free ARC from the publisher in exchange for a fair and unbiased review.\n\nThe Memory Collectors\n\nKim Neville\n\nExpected publication: March 16, 2021\n\nAtria Books\n\nISBN: 1982157585 (ISBN13: 9781982157586)\n\nPaperback $17.00\n\nfrom the publisher\n\nEv has a mysterious ability, one that she feels is more a curse than a gift. She can feel the emotions people leave behind on objects and believes that most of them need to be handled extremely carefully, and—if at all possible—destroyed. The harmless ones she sells at Vancouver’s Chinatown Night Market to scrape together a living, but even that fills her with trepidation. Meanwhile, in another part of town, Harriet hoards thousands of these treasures and is starting to make her neighbors sick as the overabundance of heightened emotions start seeping through her apartment walls.\n\nWhen the two women meet, Harriet knows that Ev is the only person who can help her make something truly spectacular of her collection. A museum of memory that not only feels warm and inviting but can heal the emotional wounds many people unknowingly carry around. They only know of one other person like them, and they fear the dark effects these objects had on him. Together, they help each other to develop and control their gift, so that what happened to him never happens again. But unbeknownst to them, the same darkness is wrapping itself around another, dragging them down a path that already destroyed Ev’s family once, and threatens to annihilate what little she has left.\n\nThe Memory Collectors casts the everyday in a new light, speaking volumes to the hold that our past has over us—contained, at times, in seemingly innocuous objects—and uncovering a truth that both women have tried hard to bury with their pasts: not all magpies collect shiny things—sometimes they gather darkness.\n\n\"With these facts I made my way home, thoroughly convinced that a Negro's life is a very cheap thing.\"`~from A Shot in the Moonlight\n\nSeveral years ago I went to a local church to hear a Metro Detroit fiber artist talk about her quilt. The quilt was huge, a stark black with thousands of names embroidered on it.\n\nApril Anue, the artist, told us how God hounded her to make this quilt, and what it cost her, the anguish and tears that accompanied every name she embroidered. She talked about the horror of making the nooses that ornament the quilt.\n\nThe 5,ooo names on the quilt are those of African Americans who had been lynched in America between 1865 and 1965. The title of the quilt is Strange Fruit.\n\nStrange Fruit by April Anue\n\nFive thousand human beings, beaten, tortured, and murdered. Anue researched every name, now memorialized for all to read.\n\nIn the Jim Crow South there were black Americans who were harassed, beaten, their homes and livelihoods taken from them, their families traumatized; they were denied protection under the law by the authorities and the courts. How many tens of thousands have been forgotten, their names lost?\n\nBen Montgomery has brought one man back to life. A freed slave whose white neighbors gathered on moonlit night to demand he leave his hard-earned, modest home and farm. Twenty-five men who claimed to be 'friends.' A man who disguised his voice and wore a handkerchief to hide his identity called to him to come out of his home. When this black man had the audacity not to comply, shots bombarded his home, wounding him. And to protect his home and family, this man shot out his window into the crowd, killing a white man.\n\nHis name was George Dinning. He fled into the fields to hide as the white men took their fallen comrade away. The next morning, Dinning's house and barn were burned to the ground. George turned himself into the authorities when he heard that he had killed a man.\n\nThe story of that night, Dinning's trial, and what happened afterwards is devastating and moving. And, it is perplexing, for the story of Dinning protecting the sanctity of his home brought a surge of support, including that of a prominent veteran of the Confederate Army who built memorials to Confederate heroes while supporting organizations to benefit freed slaves. He was \"foremost in work of charity among our race,\" one black minister said.\n\nA Shot in the Moonlight incorporates historic documents in a vivid recreation of the events of that night, the trial, and the unexpected twists of fortune afterward. Dinning stood up to power in the courtroom, asking for reparation for his loss. Everything was stacked against him, and when he was denied justice, a deluge of editorials were printed in his defense.\n\nIn his book What Unites Us, Dan Rather talks about building consensus on the shared values we all hold dear. The sanctity of home and a man's right to protect his home and family raised sympathy of for Dinning, for every American could sympathize with protecting one's home and family.\n\nThis is an amazing story of a brave man, a horrendous tale of hate and racism, and a revelation of race relations in America that brought chills and tears.\n\nI received a free book from Little, Brown Spark. My review is fair and unbiased.\n\nI previous read Montgomery's book The Man Who Walked Backwards: An American Dreamer's Search for Meaning in the Great Depression, which I reviewed here.\n\nA Shot in the Moonlight: How a Freed Slave and a Confederate Soldier Fought for Justice in the Jim Crow South\n\nby Ben Montgomery\n\nPublication January 26, 2021ISBN-13: 9780316535540 hardcover USD: $28/CAD: $35\n\nISBN-13: 9780316535564 ebook USD: $14.99 /CAD: $19.99\n\nfrom the publisher\n\nThe sensational true story of George Dinning, a freed slave, who in 1899 joined forces with a Confederate war hero in search of justice in the Jim Crow south. “Taut and tense. Inspiring and terrifying in its timelessness.”(Colson Whitehead, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Underground Railroad )\n\nNamed a most anticipated book of 2021 by O, The Oprah Magazine\n\nNamed a \"must-read\" by the Chicago Review of Books\n\nOne of CNN's most anticipated books of 2021\n\nAfter moonrise on the cold night of January 21, 1897, a mob of twenty-five white men gathered in a patch of woods near Big Road in southwestern Simpson County, Kentucky. Half carried rifles and shotguns, and a few tucked pistols in their pants. Their target was George Dinning, a freed slave who'd farmed peacefully in the area for 14 years, and who had been wrongfully accused of stealing livestock from a neighboring farm. When the mob began firing through the doors and windows of Dinning's home, he fired back in self-defense, shooting and killing the son of a wealthy Kentucky family.\n\nSo began one of the strangest legal episodes in American history — one that ended with Dinning becoming the first Black man in America to win damages after a wrongful murder conviction.\n\nDrawing on a wealth of never-before-published material, bestselling author and Pulitzer Prize finalist Ben Montgomery resurrects this dramatic but largely forgotten story, and the unusual convergence of characters — among them a Confederate war hero-turned-lawyer named Bennett H. Young, Kentucky governor William O'Connell Bradley, and George Dinning himself — that allowed this unlikely story of justice to unfold in a time and place where justice was all too rare.\n\nAbout the author\n\nBen Montgomery is author of the New York Times-bestselling 'Grandma Gatewood's Walk,' winner of a 2014 Outdoor Book Award, 'The Leper Spy,' and 'The Man Who Walked Backward,' coming fall 2018 from Little, Brown & Co.
