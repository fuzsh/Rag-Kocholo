        "text": "Our History\n\nFrom Queen's College to National University of Ireland, the University's past is intertwined with the history of Galway and Ireland. Click below to watch a timeline of 175 Years of Memorable Moments.\n\nEarly Beginnings\n\n‌\n\nThe Quadrangle first opened its doors to 68 students on 30th October 1849 and the University, then known as Queen's College was born. The University was one of three Queen's Colleges, the others located in Cork and Belfast.\n\nThe Quadrangle building, built in local limestone in a Tudor Gothic architectural style, is modelled on Christ Church at the University of Oxford. The 'Quad' still stands proudly at the heart of the University today as a testament to its past. It is now used primarily for administrative purposes and houses the offices of the President and the Vice-Presidents.\n\nIn the first academic year, 1849 -1850, the University began with three faculties, Arts, Medicine and Law but there were also schools of Agriculture and Engineering. Female students later joined the student body and in 1906 Alice Perry graduated from the college, believed to be the first female engineering graduate in the world to receive a first class honours degree in civil engineering\n\nThere are many historical buildings on campus, such as the James Mitchell Museum, established in 1952. This geological museum contains high quality collections sampling a significant diversity of the planet's geology, with a fine display of fossils, minerals and rocks.\n\nChanging with the Times\n\nThe University has had four different names:\n\nIn 1849, it was called Queen's College Galway\n\nIn 1908, it was changed to University College Galway, or UCG for short\n\nIn 1997, it was changed again to National University of Ireland Galway, or NUI Galway for short\n\nIn 2022, it was renamed to University of Galway\n\nNewer parts of the University sprang up in the 1970s, including the iconic Arts/Science Concourse designed by architects Scott Tallon Walker. The 1990s also saw considerable development including the conversion of an old munitions factory into a student centre.\n\nSince 2000, the University has invested €400 million in new buildings and facilities across campus. The early 2000s saw the addition of the Cairnes Building, Áras Moyola and the award-winning Engineering Building, all located in the north campus.\n\nIn recent years, we have added:\n\na new Biomedical Science research centre\n\nthe Institute for Lifecourse and Society\n\nthe O'Donoghue Centre for Drama, Theatre and Performance\n\nand the new Human Biology building\n\nAs the capital development programme draws to a close, we are adding new residences on campus for over 900 students, as well as developing the Quadrangle - our very first building - into a centre for public and civic engagement.\n\nUniversity Presidents through the Years\n\nProfessor Ciarán Ó hÓgartaigh - 2018-\n\nProfessor Ó hÓgartaigh's term of office commenced in January 2018.

Browne - 2008-2018\n\nAn Engineering graduate of NUI Galway, Dr Browne is a former Dean of Engineering and Deputy-President of the University. Under his leadership the university expanded dramatically in terms of student recruitment, capital development, research output and international reputation. The campus was transformed with the addition of new facilities for teaching and research, including a state-of-the-art biomedical science complex, an award-winning Engineering building, a Human Biology building, medical academies in Galway, Castlebar and Letterkenny, an Arts & Humanities research facility to house the University's expanded archives, and a Centre for Drama and Theatre Studies, among others. Two SFI research centres specialising in medical devices and data analytics - CÚRAM and INSIGHT - were established here, our research community achieved over €100 million in EU Horizon 2020 funding and we climbed over 200 places in international rankings to be counted among the Top 1% of universities worldwide.
