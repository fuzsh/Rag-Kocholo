Republicans will not respect him. And the public, though approving of his job performance, will not hold him in high personal regard. ...\n\nHe is perhaps the most chronicled president in modern history, his strengths and failings analyzed in books, novels, documentaries and movies, his most obscure and deeply personal characteristics bared for a nation to see. It is at times of public humiliation, some analysts said, that Clinton summons his most fervent desire to succeed.\n\n\"Here's a guy who's entire career has been a roller coaster,\" said Fred Greenstein, a presidential scholar at Princeton University.

I've been on the staff of the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research since its inception, and to this day, people still ask us why it's here. They assume, perhaps, that such a center has to be located where there are frequent earthquakes.\n\nActually, center research focuses on buildings and on finding ways to improve their performance during earthquakes. That doesn't mean the earthquake hazard in the eastern United States is negligible. In fact, the largest U.S. earthquakes on record occurred along the Mississippi River in 1811, centered near the little town of New Madrid, Mo.\n\nNew Madrid was back in the news a few years ago, when a professional prognosticator named Iben Browning predicted that a massive quake would again strike there. He didn't shrink from stating a date and a time.\n\nBrowning, of course, was a charlatan. ...\n\nBrowning owed his credibility to the opinion of literally just one seismologist, who gave the prediction an imprimatur of sorts. It wasn't two schools of scientific thought pitted against each other, but one maverick against his assembled colleagues.\n\nI see a similarity in the current debate on global warming. A handful of the same skeptics are repeatedly quoted concerning the issue and have created the misleading impression that the experts are seriously divided over global warming. One must look, however, at the number and stature of experts on each side of this supposed debate. It is plain that the skeptics constitute a decided and less-distinguished minority. The most outspoken of them, moreover, have well-documented ties to industrial lobbies or conservative think thanks.\n\nThat segment of the scientific community most closely involved with the issue now overwhelmingly accepts the reality of human-caused global warming. Indeed, the very purpose of the world's most authoritative body of experts on global warming, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is to synthesize the findings of a large number of researchers and produce assessments reflecting scientific consensus.\n\nAs J.D. Mahlman of the NOAA Geophysical Lab at Princeton University put it, \"A good guideline for evaluating 'expert' opinions on global warming is whether they use the IPCC science as a point of departure . . . If we disagree scientifically with the IPCC, we should explain why.\"\n\nLos Angeles Times\n\nCopyright 1998 Times Mirror Company\n\nSeptember 16, 1998\n\nHEADLINE: PAKISTAN, INDIA NUCLEAR CLAIMS CALLED INFLATED\n\nBYLINE: ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER\n\nIn a game of nuclear bluff, both India and Pakistan exaggerated the number and size of the nuclear weapons each nation detonated earlier this year, overstating the power of the atomic bombs by a factor of four, according to the first independent scientific accounting of the controversial tests.\n\nTwo of the five nuclear explosions announced by the Indian government may never have taken place, the analysis released today concluded. Only two in the series of nuclear tests that the Pakistan government announced actually involved real nuclear explosions, according to the study. At different times Pakistani officials have claimed up to seven devices were tested.\n\n\"This is quite clearly a case where governments tested for a political reason rather than scientific reasons, so we have to be suspicious of what they say,\" said Terry Wallace, a noted authority at the University of Arizona on the use of seismology to analyze nuclear explosions. ...\n\nExperts at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Princeton University and the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology, a consortium of 90 research universities that operates a global network of 100 seismic monitoring stations, endorsed the new study's conclusions about the nuclear blasts in India and Pakistan. ...\n\nAt Princeton, physicist Frank von Hippel, who until recently was the assistant director for national security in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said of the Wallace study: \"It seems pretty convincing to me.\"\n\nThe New York Times\n\nCopyright 1998 The New York Times Company\n\nSeptember 16, 1998, Wednesday\n\nHEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths\n\nPIEL, WILLIAM\n\nPIEL-William.

Steve Tosches, the football coach, was there watching the Mercer Wrecking Company's giant claws rip apart the grandstand and today he recalled those moments from December 1996.\n\n\"Down it came,\" he said. \"The concrete was like sand. The wreckers said it was one of the easiest jobs they'd ever had.\"\n\nThe moment also justified the decision by university officials to abandon expensive preservation of Palmer and build a new facility, a decision mourned, if not questioned, by many sentimental alumni.\n\nThat this was the right decision will be affirmed and celebrated on Saturday, when the new Princeton Stadium is dedicated and the first game, the Tigers against Cornell, is played.\n\nFor $45 million, a small sum relative to that of stadiums being built for National Football League teams costing at least four times as much, Princeton gets a lot in a facility that is clearly different. ...\n\nFinancial Times\n\n1998 The Financial Times Limited (London)\n\nSeptember 15, 1998, Tuesday\n\nHEADLINE: Market turmoil 'threatens open economies'\n\nWARNING BY FORMER NY FED CHIEF:\n\nBYLINE: By Stephen Fidler in Washington\n\nA former head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said yesterday that turmoil in international financial markets presented a serious threat to market-oriented economies all over the world.\n\nGerald Corrigan, now a managing director with Goldman Sachs, said the financial turbulence constituted an important threat \"to the cause of open and free political and economic institutions around the world\".

They claim -- based on their study, released last week -- that racial preferences result in more overall gains for American society than losses for students denied admission.\n\nBut the data and analysis of their study notwithstanding, a policy of disbursing benefits by race is likely to collapse from the weight of its own internal contradictions -- as the lawsuit against Wayne State University filed by a Hispanic student last month demonstrates.\n\nCritics of racial preferences have long maintained that lowering admission standards to admit more minorities, especially in elite schools, is unfair to the more qualified candidates and counterproductive for the intended beneficiaries.\n\nMinority students admitted under relaxed standards, the critics contend, find it difficult to cope with the demands of elite institutions and therefore exhibit a disproportionately high dropout rate. Meanwhile, other students better equipped to deal with rigorous curricular requirements are consigned to settings that fail to adequately engage their talents.\n\nThe study -- conducted by Derek Bok of Harvard University and William G. Bowen of Princeton University -- challenges both of these arguments. Blacks -- the main focus of the study -- who enter elite institutions have lower average test scores than whites and graduate at lower rates, they acknowledge. Yet their study found that blacks who do graduate perform slightly better than whites: Proportionally more black students obtain advanced degrees than whites. ...\n\nElectronics Times\n\nCopyright 1998 Miller Freeman PLC\n\nSeptember 14, 1998\n\nHEADLINE: The search for a flexible friend\n\nFlexibility is the keynote in any future design of electronic displays. Nadya Anscombe reports on the hunt for the ultimate bendy technology\n\nThe first company to commercialise truly flexible displays will make a fortune. There are currently hundreds of product ideas out there, but no technology commercially available to make them a reality.\n\nRoll-up TV screens, emissive newspapers, curved screens on car dashboards, electronic books, disposable displays - the list is endless. Unfortunately, so is the list of problems which must be overcome before flexible displays come onto the market. ...\n\nBut researchers at Princeton University in the US say commercialisation of flexible displays is a long way off.\n\nPaul Burrows, a Princeton research scholar, said: \"We've come a long way, but I can't sell you a flexible display yet and neither will anyone else in the very near future if they're honest about it.\"\n\nHe has been working with Universal Display to develop roll-up displays using organic LEDs (OLEDs). In contrast to CDT's technology which is based on polymers, Universal Display's technology is based on small organic molecules.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nCopyright 1998 The New York Times Company\n\nSeptember 14, 1998, Monday\n\nHEADLINE: The Facts About Affirmative Action\n\nA new study of elite colleges provides striking confirmation of the success of affirmative action in opening opportunities and creating a whole generation of black professionals who are now leaders in their fields and their communities. No study of this magnitude has been attempted before. Its findings provide a strong rationale for opposing current efforts to demolish race-sensitive policies in colleges across the country.\n\nThe study has been published as a book, \"The Shape of the River\" by William Bowen, former president of Princeton University and now president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and Derek Bok, the former president of Harvard University. It draws on data compiled by the Mellon Foundation that closely tracked the academic records, careers and attitudes of 30,000 students of all races who entered 28 elite public and private colleges and universities in 1976 and 1989.\n\nThe study looks at very selective colleges because it is primarily at these institutions that race-sensitive admission policies are an issue. \"Race sensitive\" means considering race as one factor among many others, like grades, test scores, extracurricular activities, where a student comes from and alumni connections, in determining admissions. The analysis focuses mostly on black-white comparisons because African-Americans have been at the heart of the debate and because they provide a better data pool than other minority groups.\n\nThe evidence collected flatly refutes many of the misimpressions of affirmative-action opponents. For example, black students who were admitted to the most selective schools with S.A.T. scores that were lower than those of their white counterparts, instead of becoming more discouraged by keener competition, had higher graduation rates than blacks who had the same test scores but went to less-competitive schools. ...\n\nThe New York Times\n\nCopyright 1998 The New York Times Company\n\nSeptember 14, 1998, Monday\n\nHEADLINE: I. E. Segal, 79, Mathematician Who Disputed the Big Bang\n\nBYLINE: By FORD BURKHART\n\nDr. Irving E. Segal, an influential mathematician at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who embraced many unpopular notions, including the view that there was no Big Bang at the dawn of the universe, died on Aug. 30 after he collapsed while walking near his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 79.\n\nThe cause was cardiovascular disease, the university said.\n\nDr. Segal parted company with almost all mainstream cosmologists in his belief that the universe is not expanding and that the astronomical phenomenon of \"red shift\" can be fully explained by his own novel interpretation of principles of mathematical symmetry. ...\n\nEarlier in Dr. Segal's career, his work in quantum theory developed a set of axioms that concisely expressed the theories of the physicists Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrodinger and the mathematician John von Neumann, Dr. Strauss said. Dr. Segal worked briefly at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., with von Neumann and a group of rising young stars in mathematics who left their marks in a broad range of fields.\n\nDr. Segal's initial impact was on functional analysis, a kind of calculus involving algebra and sometimes geometry and on nonlinear waves, which do not have the traits of linearity found in light and sound.\n\nIrving Ezra Segal was born in the Bronx, attended schools in Trenton and received a bachelor's degree from Princeton University in 1937 and a doctorate from Yale in 1940, both in mathematics. He then joined the Army and conducted ballistic research at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. ...\n\nThe Record\n\nCopyright 1998 Bergen Record Corp. (Bergen County, NJ)\n\nSeptember 14, 1998; Monday\n\nHEADLINE: BACKING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION\n\nBYLINE: The Record\n\nA NEW study details the most obvious benefits of several decades of affirmative action at the nation's top colleges and universities: a growing black middle class and social interaction between the races that might not have happened otherwise.\n\nConsidering the sharp decline in the percentage of blacks and Hispanics admitted to California's top schools following the end of their affirmative action programs, the fight to preserve affirmative action is vital.\n\nBut a dual if not larger focus should be on improving the urban public school systems that are failing minorities long before they reach college age.\n\n\"The Shape of the River: Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions\"was written by Princeton University economist William Bowen and Harvard political scientist Derek Bok. It studied 45,000 students who enrolled at 28 of the most selective universities in 1976 and 1989.\n\nThe study documents anecdotal information that has existed for years. Of the 700 blacks admitted to the 28 schools in 1976, 225 earned professional degrees. Seventy of the 700 became doctors, 60 earned law degrees, 125 became business executives, and 300 became civic leaders. ...\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle\n\nCopyright 1998 The Chronicle Publishing Co.\n\nSEPTEMBER 14, 1998, MONDAY\n\nHEADLINE: Complicated New Social Theory\n\nBYLINE: Jon Carroll\n\nUSUALLY, AWARE THAT I am working for a mass-circulation newspaper whose readers are sometimes not that interested in the technical side of the social sciences, I try to write articles free from confusing facts, or, indeed, any facts at all.\n\nSometimes, however, a story comes along that is both so bizarre and so complicated that I must perforce explicate the specifics. I have limited room; I urge those confused by my all-too-brief summary to consult the source documents.\n\nThus: In a long, statistics-filled book from Princeton University Press by a Harvard political scientist and a Princeton economist, the assertion is made that, contrary to everything that seems \"natural\" or \"true,\" black students who get good educations at good schools lead happy and prosperous lives.\n\nFurther, these same students, many of them beneficiaries of the discredited social engineering matrix popularly called \"affirmative action,\" become leaders in their communities and inspire others of similar racial backgrounds to greater achievements in the academic and economic spheres.\n\nAlso, in contradiction to the self-evident truths found in books like \"The Bell Curve,\" black graduates of prominent schools go on to get graduate degrees at the same rate as white students. They were slightly more likely than their white counterparts to obtain professional degrees in law, business and medicine, and substantially more likely to get involved in civic activities.\n\nThe professors suggest that the presence of black students on college campuses helps the process of integration, improves racial relations and leads inevitably to greater civility, harmony and understanding.\n\nThank God we're dismantling these programs before something really gets out of hand. ...\n\nAsbury Park Press\n\nCopyright 1998 Asbury Park Press, Inc.

Not so. The debate has been carried along on emotion, bias and assumption.\n\nNow, along comes a solid report that bolsters the arguments of those who say that affirmative action in college admissions is good for the nation --- not just for recipients. In an exhaustive study, Derek Bok, former president of Harvard University, and William Bowen, former president of Princeton University, found that college affirmative action programs not only have created the backbone of a newly affluent black middle class, but they have also taught white students the value of diversity.\n\nThe significance of the study lies in its extensive research. While Bok and Bowen admit that they are proponents of affirmative action, they conducted rigorous research, collecting data on 45,184 individuals who entered college in 1976 and 1989. Their report --- titled \"The Shape of the River: Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions\" --- is a formidable rebuttal to those who claim affirmative action wreaks havoc with the vaunted, if narrowly defined, concept of \"merit.\" ...\n\nWhile those affirmative action beneficiaries had lower graduation rates than their counterparts, those who did graduate earned advanced degrees in professions such as law and medicine at the same rates as their white classmates. (After all, black students entering schools like Harvard have high scores on the Scholastic Assessment Test, just not as high as the average white kid entering the same school. The difference may be between an SAT of 1200 and an SAT of 1350, both very good scores.) Those black graduates did well in their chosen careers. And they were more likely than their white counterparts to be active in civic affairs. ...\n\nBusiness Times\n\nCopyright 1998 Times Media Limited (South Africa)\n\nSeptember 13, 1998\n\nHEADLINE: LUCKY-DIP STOCK LORE RULES\n\nBYLINE: John Authers\n\nThe public believes in stocks, but they don't understand why.\n\nThese are the words of Peter Lynch, the legendary US fund manager. They sum up a bizarre situation in which the Wall Street professional investing community is looking with dread at US retail investors, whose huge buying in past years has left them with a big chunk of the market. If small investors were to sell, prices would take a beating.\n\nMutual fund companies and retail stockbrokers report that small investors did nothing drastic the week Wall Street started its dive. They did not buy in force as they did during the last sharp downturn in October, but neither did they sell. Not that small savers were unconcerned.

HICKS\n\nLooking slightly wilted after an afternoon of door-to-door campaigning, Assemblywoman Gloria Davis paused among the tidy, suburban-looking homes in the Charlotte Gardens section of the Bronx to take stock of her re-election effort.\n\n\"I've had races before, with a lot of different opponents over the years,\" said Ms. Davis, a 61-year-old who is known for being blunt. \"And this time, I don't just want to beat my opponent. I want to whip him.\"\n\nMs. Davis, an 18-year veteran of the Assembly who has easily won re-election, is facing what may be her most formidable opponent in many years in the Democratic primary on Tuesday. Her challenger, Frankie Cruz, is a 32-year-old cable television show host who has worked as an aide to Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic Party leader.\n\nThe race is being watched closely not only because it pits one of the Assembly's most senior members against a young, well-financed opponent making his first bid for elected office, but also because it features a black politician, Ms. Davis, running against a Puerto Rican one, Mr. Cruz, in a district that has steadily become more Hispanic.\n\nMr. Cruz has his strengths, too. Through his cable television program, \"The Frankie Cruz Show,\" on which he invites a wide array of public officials and others to discuss the events of the day, he has become far better known than the typical political newcomer.\n\nAnd he has raised nearly $75,000, both through a network of friends from his days at Princeton University and through contacts he made while working for seven years with Prep for Prep, a youth development program supported by large corporations. He said he had organized nearly 200 workers to help him on Election Day. ...\n\nThe Post and Courier\n\nCopyright 1998 The Post and Courier (Charleston, SC)\n\nSeptember 13, 1998, Sunday\n\nHEADLINE: OBITUARIES\n\nCHARLES N.

Whittington. Keith E. Whittington is an assistant professor of politics at Princeton University and is the author of \"Constitutional Construction,\" to be published in the spring.\n\nFor the past several weeks, many members of Congress have evaded answering questions about the Clinton scandal by saying that they must wait for independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr's report and for a time when \"all the facts are in.\" Now that Starr has turned over his report, Congress must begin to make the hard decisions on whether and how to proceed with an impeachment inquiry. Ironically, this also means Starr's report will become increasingly less important.\n\nThe most serious issue to be resolved at this point is not what the president did, but how Congress should respond to his actions. If an impeachment process is to begin, Congress must start developing that argument as to why this president is damaging his office.\n\nThe impeachment of high federal officers--president, justices, cabinet officials, senators--raises completely different problems from the relatively common removal of judges. Clear evidence of criminal or abusive activity by these officials has almost always led to a rapid resignation, rendering an impeachment unnecessary. Richard Nixon in 1974, Sen. William Blount in 1876 and Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876 all left office when the evidence of their criminal activities became plain. The officials who have fought their impeachments--Justice Samuel Chase in 1804 and president Andrew Johnson in 1868--faced very different situations. The core dispute between them and Congress was not over the facts, but over the significance of those facts. This is increasingly the situation facing President Clinton as well.\n\nBefore going forward with impeachment proceedings, congressional critics must build a case that leaving the president in office would threaten the constitutional order. The constitutional requirement of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" takes on a particular significance when the official under discussion is the president of the United States. On the one hand, presidents must meet the highest expectations in their personal and official conduct. On the other hand, removing a president is itself extremely damaging to the republic. The unfortunate consequence is that a disreputable president can thrust the nation into a crisis, as Congress is reluctant to impeach but does not want presidential misdeeds to set a precedent for the future. ...\n\nAmerica\n\nCopyright 1998 America Press Inc.\n\nSeptember 12, 1998\n\nHEADLINE: I suspect America readers will be interested in knowing just how mainstream the culture of death has become; dubious appointment of Peter Singer to Princeton's Center for Human Values\n\nBYLINE: Golway, Terry\n\nAccording to The Chronicle of Higher Education, \"the troops\" at Princeton University's Center for Human Values are \"rallying\" to the support of a certain Peter Singer, who will join the university's staff as a professor of bioethics next fall. Professor Singer is something of a celebrity in certain circles, particularly in academia: He is among the founders of the animal-rights movement, a very hip cause on campus these days.\n\nIt seems there's been a bit of controversy surrounding Professor Singer's appointment, according to The Chronicle. And the university, in the name of academic freedom, is preparing to defend Professor Singer from critics who, in the words of Princeton Professor George Kateb, \"haven't done their homework.\"\n\nProfessor Kateb apparently was talking about me.\n\nThe Chronicle rather dismissively noted that I have written in \"scathing\" terms in The New York Observer about Professor Singer's appointment, and that I have been \"lambasting the professor for writing that not all human lives are necessarily worth living.\" Imagine that! What nerve! How could any educated person speak ill of a man who has written: \"When the death of a disabled infant will lead to the birth of another infant with better prospects for a happy life, the total amount of happiness will be greater if the disabled infant is killed.\" ...\n\nCalgary Herald\n\nCopyright 1998 Southam Inc.\n\nSeptember 12, 1998, Saturday\n\nHEADLINE: Composer Oesterle wins Leger Prize\n\nBYLINE: HERALD NEWS SERVICES\n\nComposer Michael Oesterle has won the Canada Council's Jules Leger Prize for New Chamber Music.\n\nThe annual award, worth $7,500, goes to Oesterle for Reprise, a work for solo cello and flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, trumpet, trombone and double bass commissioned by the Little Chamber Music Series That Could in Vancouver.\n\nBorn in Germany in 1968, Oesterle immigrated to Canada in 1982, studying at the University of British Columbia and Princeton University.

Publishing Co.\n\nSeptember 12, 1998, Saturday\n\nSECTION: EDITORIAL\n\nHEADLINE: AFFIRMATIVE EVIDENCE; RACIAL PREFERENCES HELP, NOT HARM, BLACK STUDENTS\n\nSupporters of affirmative action in education will not be surprised by a new study that shows the programs have been profoundly successful in improving the life chances and the lives of thousands of African Americans, and by extension, society as a whole.\n\nThe proponents - including this newspaper - have been arguing just that for years. But now it is not just a philosophical position based on intuition and instinct. The numbers are in and the evidence is overwhelming.\n\nDo not expect, however, that the debate over affirmative action will be won or lost on the basis of statistics. Political and ideological questions are not resolved with science. But at least the arguments should be well-founded and the public discourse should take place within the context of real-world facts.\n\nThe study, which examined grades, test scores, majors, graduation rates, careers and attitudes of 45,000 students at 28 of the most selective schools in the nation over a period of 20 years, supplies a mother-lode of facts. Two former Ivy League presidents, William Bowen of Princeton University and Derek Bok of Harvard University, wrote a book using the information, called \"The Shape of the River: Long-term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions.\n\nBoth men favor using race-based admission criteria, but they said they undertook the study to test the assumptions on which they based their views.\n\nThe argument that is most quickly knocked down by the new data is the notion that affirmative action cheats blacks as well as whites. Many argue that African-American students accepted to elite institutions despite lower test scores are being set up for failure, and that they would do better in a second-tier school. ...\n\nThe Plain Dealer\n\nCopyright 1998 Plain Dealer Publishing Co.\n\nSeptember 12, 1998 Saturday\n\nHEADLINE: JAMES MCCAHEY JR., POLITICAL ACTIVIST\n\nDATELINE: BRATENAHL\n\nJames B.

And in the mornings and afternoons, when school starts and ends, cars snake along the winding roads at the suburban Brooklandville campus.\n\nBut administrators and alumni say that in all the most important ways, the school has not changed. It may be bigger and the students may be wealthier, but that doesn't alter the sense of family, the quality education or the strong ties to the Episcopal Church. ...\n\nIn honor of the sesquicentennial, the school has commissioned a recent alumnus, Angelo Otterbein, '91, to write a history of the school. Otterbein, a 1996 graduate of Princeton University, has been raiding various archives for information, but his best material comes from old-timers like O'Connell with strong ties to the school.\n\n\"Really, the archives are dispersed among several hundred people,\" he said. \"There are a lot of pack rats out there and they really love keeping everything.\" ...\n\nThe Christian Science Monitor\n\nCopyright 1998 The Christian Science Publishing Society\n\nSeptember 11, 1998, Friday\n\nHEADLINE: Resisting a World Recession\n\nBYLINE: David R.

But hygiene aside, the Greensboro fair no longer can be called the ''unfair.''\n\nIn the past quarter of a century or so, the fair seems to have cleaned up its acts, including bye-bye to midway pickpockets and to girlie shows that were a throwback to the days when fairs were heavy on vaudeville. The fair no longer books acts with insensitive names such as the ''Kawana Japs: A Brilliant Trio of Oriental Equilibrists,'' who played here in 1931.\n\nThe annual harvest-time extravaganza of wild rides, games, candy apples and cotton candy, cows and corn opens for a 10-day run today in the parking lot and Special Events Center of the Greensboro Coliseum.\n\nThis year's event is being billed as the 100th coming of the Greensboro fair, and you'll just have to take the word of the promoters that the numbers add up to three digits. Overlook evidence at the Greensboro Historical Museum that indicates the fair was founded in 1900.\n\nWhy quibble over a couple of years? What can't be denied is the claim by the fair's longtime owner, New Jersey impresario George Hamid Jr., whose father learned the trade under the tutelage of straight-shooting Annie Oakley, that no entertainment event has ever been as loyal to Greensboro for as long as the fair. ...\n\nToday, at 79 and in good health, the Princeton, N.J., resident limits his holdings to the Greensboro fair and the Hamid Royale Circus, which plays indoor arenas all over the nation. He says he held on to the Greensboro operation because after so many years, the place seems like home.\n\nGeorge Hamid Sr., a dapper man with a pencil-thin mustache, eventually quit performing to become an entertainment promoter, staying active until his death in 1971. He became rich enough by the 1930s to send George Jr. to prep school and to Princeton University, where the young man majored in economics and English and played on the football team. One of his teammates was a student from Greensboro, Richardson Preyer, the former congressman who still lives here. ...\n\nThe San Francisco Examiner\n\nCopyright 1998 The Hearst Corporation\n\nSeptember 11, 1998, Friday\n\nHEADLINE: Firm facts on affirmative action\n\nCOLUMN: ROB MORSE\n\nSOURCE: EXAMINER COLUMNIST\n\nEVERY ONCE in a while a book comes along that transforms a national debate, and I'm not talking about special prosecutor Ken Starr's report to Congress.\n\nThe former presidents of Princeton and Harvard, William G. Bowen and Derek Bok, respectively, have written a book that would have been nice to have two years ago.\n\nRemember the polemic-fest about affirmative action? It's hard to forget at UC-Berkeley. Because of the UC Regents' 1996 ban on taking race into account in admissions, the number of black and Latino freshmen has been cut in half, from not nearly enough to nearly nil.\n\nBowen and Bok's book, \"The Shape of the River,\" released Thursday by Princeton University Press, shows us what the UC system, the state and the nation will be missing by not considering race when admitting students.\n\nThis isn't 1996's abstract debate about \"fairness,\" \"merit\" and what might happen to black students admitted to elite universities despite lower SAT scores than whites.\n\nThe book is about what really has happened to almost 50,000 black and white students admitted to 28 elite colleges and universities. Twenty years of their lives, incomes and contributions to the nation have been charted in a database developed by the Mellon Foundation.\n\nBowen, an economist, is now president of that foundation. When I spoke to the authors by phone on Thursday, Bowen said with both pride and understatement: \"We've gotten beyond the anecdotal level.\"\n\nI'll say they did. There's no tired talk about the mythical \"level playing field.\" This book is packed with data, charts and sober analyses of the things that happened in the lives of black and white students admitted to top colleges and universities. ..."
