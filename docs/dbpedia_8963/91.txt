The German Democratic Republic (GDR; German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik or DDR), commonly known as East Germany (German: Ostdeutschland), was a socialist state established by the USSR in 1949 in the Soviet zone of occupied Germany, including East Berlin of the Allied-occupied capital city. The GDR borders Czechoslovakia to the south, West Germany to the south and west, Poland to the east, and the Baltic Sea to the north.

Overview[]

"There's nobody more fanatic than a convert". Though the Eastern German troops are fighting almost exclusively with Soviet equipment, their infantry is indoctrinated and trained separately until they reach the excellence imposed by their Soviet brothers. Moreover, as it is their task to monitor the majority of the Iron Curtain, the East Germany armies place stock in their scouting units and intelligence services.
