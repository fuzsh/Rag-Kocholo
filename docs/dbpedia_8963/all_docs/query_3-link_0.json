        "text": "In our timeline both germanies went with pretty generic names because they explicitly did not want to establish the distinct identities @Reflection is talking about and hoped for reunification under their terms. For the BRD this is very unlikely to change, but the GDR was controlled by outside influences to a much a greater degree in this regard, so you might actually get the decision to go with a more distinct name, but still likely steeped in \"communisty\" adjectives. Something like a peoples democratic republic of Sachsen-Anhalt might be in the cards, but the possibilities here are very broad indeed.\n\nIn our timeline both germanies went with pretty generic names because they explicitly did not want to establish the distinct identities @Reflection is talking about and hoped for reunification under their terms.

Something like a peoples democratic republic of Sachsen-Anhalt might be in the cards, but the possibilities here are very broad indeed.\n\nYeah, realistically this wouldn't happen. Both governments saw themselves as the true successor to Germany and the other as illegitimate, with propaganda often smearing each other as such (West labeling East as a Soviet puppet and a socialist dystopia, East labeling West as being the successor to the Nazis and overall decadent). In fact it wasn't until 1972 where they each officially recognized each other. Thus, they avoided trying to make a distinct identity for themselves as something other than German.\n\nKeep in mind, Austria only did it because they literally had to after Austria was forbidden by international law from uniting with Germany again after WWII. Thus they forged their identity by emphasizing what made them different. Beforehand it wasn't uncommon for Austrians to consider themselves to be German. But in this case, both sides always had the hope of a reunification with their governments being the baseline. It just so happened that the West defeated the East in the end."
