        "text": "Catalog Accompanying the Exhibition\n\nBetween anti-fascism, socialist utopia and religious life: What did it mean to be Jewish in the GDR?\n\nAfter the Shoah, many Jews made the conscious choice to live in East Germany, to be part of building a new, more equitable socialist society, hoping for greater justice and to overcome antisemitic structures.\n\nWith personal stories and articles by scholars from different fields of studies this book accompanies the exhibition Another Country. Jewish in the GDR. It provides a close look at how Jewish life was newly constituted in small communities, how the social upheavals affected the self-image of Jews in the GDR, and at what became of their ideals.\n\nDetails\n\nAnother Country.

Open the flap and you discover the entire image. The visibility of Jewish life in the GDR, one of the main themes of the exhibition, is also addressed in the design,” says the designer Siyu Mao. The book’s design as a whole captures the longings and illusions, the personal memories, and the surrounding historic and political conditions that were also presented in the exhibition.\n\nYou can order this publication from a bookstore, or from the museum by contacting\n\nBavaroi Onlineshop\n\neinkauf@bavaroi.de\n\nExhibition Another Country.
