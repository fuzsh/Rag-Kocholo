        "text": "Transcript\n\nNARRATOR: 1945 - Germany after the capitulation. The cities are in ruins. The future of the German people lies in the hands of the Allied Forces. At war's end the country is divided into four zones. In the Soviet zone, German communists returning from exile are supposed to implement the plans for rebuilding their cities. Party leader Ulbricht warns his comrades that the new buildings should not be too flashy.\n\nWOLFGANG LEONHARD: \"And then Ulbricht said 'This is how I want the positions filled.' And someone asked 'But what about our comrades?' Because there were so few communists there, and then he said 'Naturally, it must appear democratic, but the control has got to be in our hands.'\"\n\nNARRATOR: In early 1946, the coalition of the KPD and SPD parties also use this tactic on the Socialist Unity Party. In the SED the Social Democrats are increasingly marginalized.\n\nERICH LOEST: \"For me, as I saw it, it was a forced coalition. The KPD was the smaller, but more powerful party. The Soviet command was behind them. And then the larger SPD said 'People, there's nothing we can do. Whoever tries to defend himself will surely fall within their radar.'\"\n\nNARRATOR: In May 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany is founded in the west, cornering the leadership of the SED. Now a socialist German state can only exist in the Soviet zone. Under instruction from Moscow the SED Politburo decides to create its own state in the east.\n\nKLAUS HERDE: \"It was obvious, as in a game of chess, that one move must be followed by another.\"\n\nNARRATOR: On October 7, 1949, the Soviet occupiers hand over power to a provisional German government. It is the birth of the GDR. Despite the absence of democratic elections, much hope is invested in the new state.\n\nKURT MAETZIG: \"We hoped that this young state would realize our dreams of socialism which we were striving to build, if not across all of Germany then at least here.\"\n\nNARRATOR: The youth organization FDJ celebrates the founding of a better Germany. The political stalemate between East and West leads to the division of the German nation. No one could guess how long it would last.\n\nHELLMUTH KARASEK: \"The fear was that Germany would be split forever. And I must admit, up until one year before the reunification, I couldn't have imagined that a solution would be found.\"\n\nNARRATOR: In October 1989 the SED administration celebrates the 40th anniversary of the GDR - for the last time. Weeks later, The Wall comes tumbling down."
