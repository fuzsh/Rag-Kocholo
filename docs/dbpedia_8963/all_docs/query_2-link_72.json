        "text": "From the very beginning the MfS was the \"Shield and Sword of the Party\" – and at the same time an ancillary organ of the KGB, the Soviet secret service. To this end the MfS recruited \"secret informers\" and \"secret employees\" from the population, later referred to as \"IMs\" (unofficial employees), who operated conspiratorially under aliases. With its far-reaching authority, the Stasi systematically inspected the mail, observed and eavesdropped on citizens who were critical of the regime, broke into their apartments secretly, intimidated dissidents and \"disrupted\" opposition groups. In popular parlance the Stasi was also described as \"Listen and Look,\" but it did more than just snoop. The MfS was also responsible for the criminal investigations of presumed enemies of the state, who were referred to in Stasi jargon as \"hostile negative elements.\"\n\nErich Mielke was appointed Minister of State Security in 1957 and ultimately held the rank of a military general. He remained in this position until November 7, 1989. His employees saw themselves as \"Chekists\" – a common term at the time for the secret police agencies in the eastern bloc that had modelled themselves in the tradition of the first Russian secret service chief, Feliks E. Dzierzynski. The Stasi regiment responsible for protecting the buildings of party, government and MfS was named after Dzierzynski in 1967. The term \"Chekist\" is derived from the Russian word \"Tscheka\", which was coined by Lenin in 1917. The abbreviation stood for \"Tschreswytschainaja Komissija po borbe s Konterrewoljuzijej, spekulazijei i sabotaschem\" (Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage).\n\nThe MfS grew larger with each year. By 1988 it had more than 91,015 full-time employees and 189,000 unofficial collaborators who made it possible for all of East German society to be kept under total surveillance."
