        "text": "Eastern bloc, group of eastern European countries that were aligned militarily, politically, economically, and culturally with the Soviet Union approximately from 1945 to 1990. Members included Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was effectively expelled in 1948, and Albania withdrew in 1961. The remaining Eastern bloc countries constituted a “sphere of influence” of the Soviet Union, which maintained high oversight and varying degrees of direct and indirect control over bloc members until the revolutionary uprisings of 1989. During the years of the Eastern bloc’s existence, its member countries traded primarily with the Soviet Union, aligned their military and foreign policies with those of the Soviet Union, received large quantities of humanitarian and economic aid from the Soviet Union, maintained one-party socialist governmental systems modeled on that of the Soviet Union, and were ruled by communist elites who had been sanctioned by the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Eastern bloc originated at the end of World War II. At the 1945 Yalta Conference, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin pledged to hold free and fair democratic elections in eastern European countries that the Red Army had liberated. Rather than carrying out this promise, occupying Soviet forces supported takeovers by local communist parties and the restructuring of eastern European governments and economies according to the Stalinist model. The U.S.S.R. also facilitated the rise to power of former communist partisans in Albania and Yugoslavia, who quickly allied themselves with the Soviet Union.\n\nThe purpose of the Eastern bloc’s formation was primarily to protect Soviet military interests. Eastern European countries formed a “buffer zone” for the U.S.S.R., mitigating the potential consequences of invasion from the West. The formation of the Warsaw Pact in 1955 codified the military alignment of the bloc.\n\nIn addition to their military alliance, both the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc countries enjoyed favourable trade relations with one another, and the Eastern bloc was a large market for Soviet goods. Eastern European countries had been devastated by the destruction of World War II, and Soviet aid was central in rebuilding and developing their economies. Nonetheless, the countries of the Eastern bloc struggled to reach the goals for trade output and industrialization set by the Soviet Union. Furthermore, though both sides received some benefits from their alliance, these benefits were unequally distributed, favouring the U.S.S.R., and were not great enough for the bloc to maintain its existence.\n\nSoon after the Eastern bloc was formed, its first crack appeared. At a Cominform conference in 1948, the Josip Broz Tito-led Yugoslavia was expelled from that organization and formally denounced by the Soviet press. Diplomatic relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union were broken soon after. Ideological differences were identified as the cause of the rift, but post-Soviet scholarship has indicated that foreign policy and territorial ambitions on both sides played a large role. In response to the threat to unity and ideological cohesion posed by the Tito-Stalin split, a series of purges and persecutions took place throughout the Eastern bloc. Local party officials employed secret police, torture, and show trials to find and persecute those deemed guilty of Titoism.\n\nAfter Stalin’s death, de-Stalinization triggered popular unrest in the Eastern bloc. The Soviet Union sent troops into East Germany in 1953 to put down protests and into Poland in 1956 to end the Poznań Riots. The most notable post-Stalin unrest in the bloc was the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, which resulted in government reform followed by military intervention by the Soviet Union and brutal repression of Hungarian dissidents.\n\nThe bloc’s next challenge was the departure in 1961 of Albania, which aligned itself with China after the Sino-Soviet split. However, Albania’s location on the periphery of the bloc made its exit a less significant loss than that of Yugoslavia. The prospect of losing Czechoslovakia in 1968 was far more threatening to Soviet interests.\n\nThe Soviet Union viewed the liberalizing reforms of the Prague Spring as too risky to be allowed to continue, and Warsaw Pact troops invaded Czechoslovakia to install a government more tractable to Moscow’s directions. The Brezhnev Doctrine (named for Leonid Brezhnev, who took control of the leadership of the U.S.S.R. in the mid-1960s) was then instituted, identifying the limits of what the Soviet Union would tolerate from Eastern bloc governments and justifying Soviet military intervention when those limits were exceeded."
