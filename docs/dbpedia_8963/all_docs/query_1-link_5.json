        "text": "BERLIN — After the Berlin Wall came down, the West Germans liked to call the East Germans Ossis, or, better still, Jammer-Ossis. It was a derogatory term, meant to characterize East Germans as whiney and ungrateful. The East Germans, for their part, called the West Germans Besser-Wessis, a pun on the word Besserwisser, which means ‘know-it-all’. But they felt inferior to the West Germans, so when they said Besser-Wessis, they usually sounded disgruntled rather than condescending.\n\nNowadays, name calling isn’t so common, and some would argue that the process of reunification has run its course. East Germany, they say, has largely been Westernized. Millions of young East Germans who entered the job market after 1990 have since adopted the lifestyles of their West German compatriots. Many have moved to Western cities. There are upscale neighborhoods in East Berlin, Leipzig and Dresden that look just like trendy parts of, say, Hamburg. And thanks to their lingering sexy Socialist grunginess, they may be even trendier.\n\nRe-energizing the nation\n\nBut entire regions of East Germany are still in tatters. Many East Germans remain suspicious of the free-market economy. They vote for Die Linke, the legal successor to the GDR’s governing party, and they don’t trust Western institutions such as NATO and, to a lesser extent, the EU. They feel that Russia was largely within its rights when it invaded Crimea and fomented separatism in Eastern Ukraine. They may not like Russian President Vladimir Putin, but they aren’t prepared to side with the West either.\n\nMost of the above is true of many West Germans, too. Which begs the question: How much East is there in the reunified nation?\n\nMore than 25 years have passed since East German protesters took to the streets in what has since been dubbed the Peaceful Revolution. They famously changed their tune from “We are the people” to “We are one people,” but a typical mass uprising it was not. The movement only gathered steam once the Soviet empire crumbled and the Hungarian border opened up — the Peaceful Revolution wasn’t exactly hard won.\n\nThe magic of reunification wore off quickly. Enthusiasm for the blessings of consumer capitalism gave way to disillusionment as thousands of East German companies were liquidated, jobs disappeared and brands vanished. An entire economy went down the drain, inducing nostalgia for a quaint, cozy GDR that never existed. At its best, Ostalgia — the nostalgia for all things East — was tempered by irony. The hit 1999 comedy Good Bye Lenin! depicts an East German woman who falls into a coma and wakes up months later, subsequently failing to realize that socialism is dead because her kids go to absurd lengths to hide the truth.\n\nWest Germans, on the other hand, felt no need to glorify the past. Reunification was a takeover, not a merger. Or so they thought. But now a physicist from East Berlin is running the country, a priest from Rostock is president, and there are countless other East Germans in politics, sciences, and the arts who owe their success at least in part to their East German past. Growing up in a country that no longer exists toughened them, making them more versatile than their western peers. Germany would be a different and far more boring place without them. Reunification has re-energized the nation.\n\nThe same goes for the political left. Although the fall of the Berlin Wall is taken as the definitive victory of capitalism over communism, Germany’s leftist party Die Linke is doing just fine. Running on an anti-capitalist platform, the party is a mix of East and West. Remnants of the former East German governing party joined ranks with leftist Social Democrats disappointed by Gerhard Schröder’s economic policies. They’re part of the political mainstream now, with as much as a quarter of the vote in the former East Germany and up to 10 percent in the West.\n\nLeft-wing views that would have been taboo in the old West, are now widespread. According to a recent survey by Free University Berlin, 59 percent of East Germans believe socialism is a good idea in want of proper execution, compared to 37 percent in the former West Germany. Free-market liberals, on the other hand, represented by the hapless FDP, are struggling to overcome the 5 percent hurdle to gain representation in German parliaments.\n\nLeft-wing views that would have been taboo in the old West, are now widespread. According to a recent survey, 59 percent of East Germans believe socialism is a good idea in want of proper execution\n\nA similar case of East-meets-West can be found on the political right. Late last year, thousands of East Germans took to the streets of Leipzig and Dresden.\n\nPegida (or the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West) started out as an anti-immigration movement, attracting a wide range of citizens from working-class types to doctors and lawyers. Then, after Christmas, its numbers dropped. Now, with rising temperatures, attendance at the organization’s rallies is up again. Just a couple of weeks ago, 10,000 people gathered in Dresden to hear Dutch right-wing populist Geert Wilders speak.\n\nIslamization and immigration aren’t Pegida’s only concerns. The group also opposes EU sanctions against Russia. “Help us, Putin,” one banner read at a recent protest. That message is inadvertently ironic, given that it wasn’t too long ago that Russian soldiers occupied East Germany, when Putin himself was a KGB agent in Dresden. Most East Germans resented the Soviets back then. But now that the Cold War is flaring up again, they aren’t prepared to side with the West either.\n\nCommon ground\n\nPegida protesters have rediscovered the battle cry of the Peaceful Revolution. “We are the people,” they chant. The fact that this time their words are directed at a democratically-elected government, not a dictatorship, doesn’t seem to phase them. They feel that political elites, specifically the mainstream media, are out of touch. Pegida leaders even advised their supporters not to speak with journalists. But when a cast member of the heute-show – a German adaptation of the US’s satirical Daily Show – posed as a reporter for Russia Today, people on the street willingly slammed the German press for being liberally biased, far from free, and no more objective than the state-controlled media of the GDR.\n\nSome observers have been quick to interpret Pegida’s rise as a purely East German phenomenon, and, therefore, as evidence that the East-West divide persists. But though Pegida didn’t gain much of a foothold in Western cities, most of its main themes resonate in the former West. Fear of immigration is not the only example. The backlash against the media also unites East and West Germans. According to a December survey by the weekly Die Zeit, nearly 50 percent of Germans believe that big media organizations have a political agenda. (The number is higher in the former GDR but not by much.) German public television, in particular, came under fire for its reporting on Ukraine, which many Germans believed was biased against Russia.\n\nTime for introspection\n\nWhich brings us back to Putin. The popular interpretation of events here is that Russia acted in self-defense after NATO started encroaching on its old territory. Helmut Schmidt, Helmut Kohl and Gerhard Schröder have all voiced some measure of understanding for Putin, and a large proportion of Germans would agree with their former chancellors. They believe that both sides are equally to blame for the conflict. In a geopolitical struggle that pits NATO against Russia, many Germans know exactly where they stand: somewhere in between.\n\nWhen the reunified nation celebrates its 25th anniversary on October 3, there will be, no doubt, lots of beer drinking and sausage eating. There will also be some time for introspection. What has become of Germany now that reunification has receded into the past? It should be remembered that Germany arrived late to the club of liberal democracies. It was never as firm an ally of the West as other European powers. The ties were strongest during the Cold War, of course, but they were limited to an entity called West Germany that no longer exists. Reunification wasn’t a takeover, after all. It was a merger.\n\nKonstantin Richter is a regular contributor to Die Welt and the author of Bettermann and Kafka was Young and He Needed the Money."
