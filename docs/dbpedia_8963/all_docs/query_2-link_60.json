        "text": "Introduction\n\nSince unification in 1990, a major goal of German policy has been to create equal living conditions in the “New Länder”—the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) and East Berlin—and the “Old Länder”—the federal states of the former Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and West Berlin. In fact, quite a range of objective living conditions in East Germany have slowly converged to the West German conditions. Despite some problems related to the system, the West German welfare state model, including generous social protection regulations, was transferred to the new federal states. Although income and pensions rose especially for pensioners who held the lowest status in the former GDR, average incomes still differ between the old and new states (Hauser 1995; Statistisches Bundesamt, StBA 2004).\n\nFurther positive changes of particular relevance for older people concern housing and mobility options: housing stock has improved substantially through the modernisation of existing buildings and construction of new residential areas. About 83% of all dwellings now have central heating in both parts of Germany, and only a minority of East Germans reported their buildings to be still in need of complete renovation (7% compared to 2% in West Germany). Home-ownership increased substantially from 24% in 1994 to 32% in 2002, but has yet to reach the level of 43% in West Germany (StBA 2004). Furthermore, the range and quality of goods and services which are suited to support independent living in old age have increased. East German households are now almost as well equipped with technological devices as are West German households. A car is available in 72% of East German households, compared to 78% in the West, which represents a substantial “catching up” (StBA 2004; for the situation of elder households in 1991, see Mollenkopf and Hampel 1994). Travel opportunities are no longer restricted.\n\nHowever, fewer improvements appear to have occurred in the domains of health and emotional well-being. Whereas 1993 German Welfare Survey data (Zapf and Habich 1996) showed health impairments or a lack of social contacts to be a feature of West Germans’ lives only from about 75 years on, such unfavourable conditions were already found in noticeable numbers in the age group 65–74 years for East Germans (Mathwig and Mollenkopf 1996). In 2002, clear differences between East and West German elders still existed with respect to difficulties in performing activities of daily living, feelings of depression and subjective health, although the latter has slightly improved between 1992 and 2002 (StBA 2004).\n\nAverage data, however, often mask regional differences (Scharf 2001). One can assume that large urban–rural differences exist, and that East–West differences persist more strongly in remote rural areas neglected by economic development. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on whether the general trend towards improved living conditions described above also applies to the situation of older people living in rural areas. Hence, in a first step, we investigate and compare the living conditions of older adults in rural areas in East and West Germany with respect to socio-structural, personal and environmental resources which are important for autonomy and well-being in old age. Considering that objective characteristics have often been shown to exert a modest impact on well-being (e.g. Veenhoven 1996; Diener et al. 2003; Krause 2004), objective conditions will be related to subjective evaluations of neighbourhood, services, and the possibilities to be mobile and pursue leisure activities.\n\nFrom a social policy perspective, it is also important to know whether and how prevailing living conditions and their appraisal affect older people’s quality of life: does the so-called paradox of actual versus perceived life conditions, suggesting that older people may adapt their needs and expectations to unfavourable conditions in order to maintain subjective well-being (Kivett 1988; Staudinger 2000; Oswald et al. 2003), also hold true for older people in East and West German rural areas? Or do unfavourable conditions—if they exist—result in lower satisfaction? Therefore, in a second step, the potential impact of both the prevailing conditions and the rural elders’ subjective evaluation of these conditions for their general life satisfaction will be investigated.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe research is based on the European project “MOBILATE. Enhancing Outdoor Mobility in Later Life” (Mollenkopf et al. 2005), funded by the European Commission, and pays special attention to the cultural and structural differences in various European regions. An essential focus of this study was on how environmental resources impact on the living conditions of older adults. Patterns of activity and the corresponding personal and environmental conditions were examined in a survey conducted in 2000 in urban and rural regions of five European countries. In view of the diverging national conditions of the countries in terms of spatial extension, settlement structure, and population density, we decided not to impose identical standards when selecting suitable cities and rural areas. Instead, in order to take into consideration the specific national peculiarities, medium-sized cities were chosen in proportion to each country’s characteristics and, within rural regions of each country, villages or areas were chosen which can be regarded as characteristic for that country.\n\nResearch areas\n\nThe German part of the rural study was conducted in the districts of Jerichow (Saxony-Anhalt, East Germany) and Vogelsberg (Hesse, West Germany). Both areas are so-called “Ländliche Kreise im Regionstyp II” (rural districts in region type II; Bundesamt für Bauwesen und Raumordnung, BAfBR 1999). The district of Jerichow is a lowland area, located about 200 km to the west of Berlin. As such, it does not benefit from the capital’s economic development. With its 101,200 inhabitants in an area of 1,337 km2, it is comparatively sparsely populated. Despite its rural character, most economic activity takes place in the service sector; only 4.2% of economically active inhabitants were engaged in agriculture, forestry and fisheries in 1999. Due to major economic changes following unification, the unemployment rate was high (17.8%).\n\nThe district of Vogelsberg is a hilly area, located in the middle of the state of Hesse in central Germany. With its 119,000 inhabitants in an area of 1,459 km2, it is about as sparsely populated as the East German region chosen in this study. Only 1.4% of economically active inhabitants work in agriculture, forestry or fisheries. The area had an unemployment rate of 9.6% in 1999 (BAfBR 1999).\n\nSample\n\nThe rural sample included 762 men and women aged 55 years or older, disproportionately stratified according to gender (almost equal shares of men and women) and age (55–74 and 75 years and older respectively) (Table ). However, as the focus of this paper is on possible East–West differences, we abstain from this age and gender differentiation in the presentation of data, and mention gender and/or age differences only if they revealed high significance, or if we found diverging East–West patterns between subgroups.\n\nTable 1\n\nNumber of participants (n)Rural area, West Germany (District of Vogelsberg, Hesse)Rural area, East Germany (District of Jerichow, Saxony-Anhalt)55–74 years75+ yearsTotal55–74 years75+ yearsTotalMales1177419111773190Females1157719211475189Total232151383231148379\n\nRespondents were chosen by a random route procedure in villages of at most 5,000 inhabitants. Sample sizes were almost equal in the eastern and western German regions (nWest=383; nEast=379). Dropout rates were 39% in the West German rural area and 44% in the corresponding East German area. As the main reasons for dropping out were refusing without giving detailed reasons (about 10%), not being reachable (13%) or having no time (12%), and only a minor percentage (5.4%) of potential participants mentioned health reasons, we assume that the sample does not show a strong distortion towards very healthy persons.\n\nMeasures\n\nParticipants were interviewed in their homes by specially trained interviewers from a commercial research institute (USUMA, Berlin). Standardised questionnaires were used to assess individuals’ socio-demographic, health and social resources, and essential features of the community.\n\nSocio-demographic indicators included age, education (years of full-time education including school attendance, occupational training and university study), income (pseudo-metric net income per person in the household, derived from a list of 14 categories for overall net household income) and occupational status.\n\nHealth-related indicators included self-rated functional health: the ability to perform 10 selected activities of daily living without difficulty, with difficulty, or not at all (e.g. bending down, climbing stairs, doing light/heavy housework; derived from Lawton and Brody’s (1969) ADL scale), and visu-motoric functioning (the Working Memory/Digit Symbol Test; Oswald and Fleischmann 1995). To assess emotional well-being, the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS; Watson et al. 1988) was employed, asking for the frequency of 10 positive emotions (e.g. feeling proud, inspired, active) and 10 negative emotions (e.g. feeling distressed, nervous, ashamed) experienced during the preceding 12 months (score of 1=not at all to 5=very often).\n\nWith respect to social network aspects, household composition, parenthood and the number of children were assessed. Moreover, information was collected relating to various categories of persons who were particularly important for emotional or personal reasons (e.g. relatives, friends, colleagues, professional helpers), and who were not living in the same household as that of the respondent. The values given may be an underestimation because they were obtained by adding up the “important persons” subcategories, and not by documenting the absolute number of persons in the individual categories.\n\nIndicators related to the immediate living environment included information on the kind of house occupied by respondents (e.g. a free-standing house or a block of flats), as well as his or her housing tenure. Basic comforts of the dwelling such as central heating, bathroom or shower, and toilet inside the dwelling were aggregated to form a sum score ranging from 0 (none of the comforts available) to 3 (all given comforts available). Attachment to one’s home, an overall evaluation of the emotional and cognitive bonding towards the home, was assessed on an 11-point Likert-type scale from 0=not at all to 10=very high.\n\nTwo lists, the one including 21 service facilities (e.g. food store, post office, doctor, hairdresser), the other 10 desirable neighbourhood features (e.g. quiet residential area, cultural opportunities in the vicinity, good medical care) were used to assess the availability of features of the community which can be considered as essential for daily necessities and neighbourhood quality.\n\nIn order to depict patterns of everyday life, various kinds of mobility (e.g. the availability of private or public transport modes) and of activities (derived from a list of 18 outdoor activities such as going for a walk, gardening, visiting cultural events) were assessed. The individual importance attributed to being out was measured with an 11-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0=not important at all to 10=very important. Outdoor motivation was further measured by a self-evaluation rating on an 11-point bipolar scale (0=if I had a choice, I would always stay at home, 10=if I had a choice, I would always be on the go).\n\nSatisfaction with housing, with the living area and other important life domains as well as with life in general was assessed on an 11-point Likert-type scale used also in the German Welfare Survey and by the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP; score of 0=lowest satisfaction to 10=highest satisfaction; Zapf and Habich 1996).\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nDue to the sample stratification, all subsequent analyses were carried out using weighted data to correct for oversampling of older persons and males. Tests for mean group differences in continuous variables used the t-statistic; group-wise frequency counts for categorical variables were analysed using chi-square statistics. To explore which actual conditions prevailing in the two rural regions explain variance in general life satisfaction, and especially whether the impact of these predictors differs substantially between regions, we included both indicators from a variety of life domains as well as the corresponding interaction terms with the West vs. East regions in a multiple regression analysis for the pooled German sample.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe comparison of living conditions which are important for autonomy and well-being in old age showed a range of similarities in the West and East German rural areas studied, but also considerable differences. For one, they differed with respect to socio-demographic aspects in that older adults in the eastern region had more years of education, less employment, and lower income than was the case for the western region–all well-known prevailing East–West differences which exist not only in rural areas but also between the old and new German states in general (StBA 2004). In addition, East German rural elders seem to be equipped with more health-related resources. They performed better in activities of daily living (ADL) and visu-motoric coordination, and revealed higher subjective health and more positive (but also more negative) affect than did their West German contemporaries. Such differences in functional and subjective health were not found in a similar study conducted in two other rural areas in 1999 (Mollenkopf et al. 2001; Oswald et al. 2003). This study, however, included larger localities (up to 20,000 inhabitants) and the selected East German region comprised some former industrial areas, which may explain the diverging findings.\n\nWith respect to social resources, we found both similarities and differences. Parenthood (having children), the number of children, and social network variety were almost the same in the two regions. In the West German area, however, a larger proportion of older persons was living alone. Contact frequency with important confidants was substantially higher in the western than in the eastern area. The latter finding seems to reflect general socio-cultural habits, as it is in line with data from general population surveys (SOEP, Mathwig and Mollenkopf 1996; Alters-Survey, Scherger et al. 2004) based on which social contacts were repeatedly found to be less frequent in East than in West Germany.\n\nDifferences between East and West German rural elders’ activity patterns also emerged in relation to outdoor activities. The East Germans pursued a much smaller variety of activities than did their West German contemporaries. These findings are again consistent with the German Alters-Survey (Scherger et al. 2004) and general survey data showing lower activity rates even among young East Germans (aged 17–25 years; StBA 2004). We cannot clarify with our data whether the smaller range of outdoor activities in the East German rural area is due to less favourable opportunities or whether it is rooted in socio-cultural differences. Still, the East Germans’ low satisfaction with their leisure possibilities reflects unfulfilled needs. Nevertheless, mobility options seem to have improved since the 1990s because, at least on average, similar conditions were found regarding car availability and satisfaction with mobility possibilities in general, and satisfaction with public transport was even higher among the East German elders.\n\nA differentiated picture arose once again with respect to environmental resources. Home-ownership, the type of buildings, years of residency and attachment to home were almost equal in both rural areas. However, significant differences to the disadvantage of older people in the East German countryside continue to exist particularly when it comes to housing amenities, shops, services and other important neighbourhood features. These basic environmental components, constituting major preconditions for an autonomous living especially in old age when physical and sensory abilities to be mobile are decreasing, were significantly less available in the East German rural region compared to the situation in the West German study area. A limitation of this study is that it was restricted to only two—albeit carefully selected—areas and therefore, any generalisations should be made with caution. Large deviations may exist in both positive and negative directions because of a region’s specific geographical or structural conditions. Motel et al. (2000), for instance, found that in 1996 environmental indicators like shops, medical services and public transport were, on average, even less available in small West German villages than in East German villages of the same size. This corresponds with our findings regarding public transport, but not with those regarding shops and services.\n\nThe objectively prevailing disadvantages in living conditions are reflected in the East German elders’ lower satisfaction with their finances, housing and services in the vicinity, with the area they live in, with their possibilities to pursue leisure activities and, finally, with life in general. Thus, our findings do not support the so-called paradox of actual versus perceived life conditions suggesting that older people may be particularly capable of adapting their needs and expectations to unfavourable conditions in order to maintain subjective well-being (Kivett 1988; Staudinger 2000; Oswald et al. 2003). Instead, in this East–West comparison, less favourable conditions resulted in lower appraisal and, vice versa, better conditions were accompanied by higher satisfaction (the only exception being satisfaction with health). This interpretation should be taken with caution, however, because cross-sectional data are not appropriate for “cause–consequence” statements. More insight into the possible impact of, on the one hand, individual resources and, on the other, environmental resources on subjective quality of life can be gained from the predictor variables explaining the rural elders’ general life satisfaction.\n\nStudies in quality of life have consistently shown that health—subjectively perceived health, in particular—and an individual’s economic situation are the most important factors affecting satisfaction with life in general (e.g. Barresi et al. 1983–1984; Lamb 1996; Veenhoven 1996; Fernández-Ballesteros et al. 2001; Diener et al. 2003; Oswald et al. 2003). This was also the case for the German rural elders. Findings of regression analysis revealed similar impacts of subjective evaluations of basic human conditions in both rural areas. A satisfactory financial situation and perceived good mental health constituted the main factors of older rural adults’ life satisfaction in the East and West. In the West German area, in particular, satisfaction with finances exerted a strong impact—a finding which corresponds well with that of earlier work in East and West German rural areas (Mollenkopf et al. 2001; Oswald et al. 2003).\n\nOther socio-demographic aspects like age and gender affected life satisfaction much less. Why satisfaction increases with age, and why women are more satisfied with their life than are men are interesting questions which, however, must remain open.\n\nSocial network aspects (living together, network variety) showed no impact at all on rural elders’ satisfaction. This somewhat surprising result is, however, in accordance with findings based on the German Socio-Economic Panel, showing that living together with a spouse or partner contributes to satisfaction with life in younger age groups but not in old age (70 years and older; StBA 2004).\n\nIn addition to economic and health-related aspects, environmental conditions—with the exception of housing amenities—constitute significant predictors of life satisfaction among elders in rural Germany. Inadequate environmental conditions in terms of a restricted number of facilities necessary for daily living nearby seriously diminish the life satisfaction of older people, whereas high satisfaction with the residential area increases their subjective quality of life.\n\nSatisfaction with leisure possibilities also constitutes an important domain-specific appraisal in both study areas, confirming the findings of other research that activity and health contribute significantly to general life satisfaction (Fernández-Ballesteros et al. 2001). Mobility options seem to be another crucial component in older rural people’s subjective quality of life—an aspect which has often been emphasised in research on mobility in old age (e.g. Carp 1988; Marottoli et al. 1997; Coughlin 2001; Cvitkovich and Wister 2001; Owsley 2002) but has largely been neglected in satisfaction research. An exception is Farquhar’s (1995) study of older people’s definitions of quality of life, in which the ability to go out was associated with a better quality of life whereas immobility and being housebound were found to decrease quality of life (Farquhar 1995). In the East German rural area, in particular, the ability to actively drive a car and satisfaction with opportunities to be mobile in general appeared to have a positive impact on older people’s life satisfaction. Under unfavourable neighbourhood conditions, as found in the rural areas of eastern Germany, it is understandable that good mobility options contribute to satisfaction with life in general more strongly than if basic needs related to the living environment are fulfilled, as was the case in the West German countryside—at least in the area included in our study.\n\nThus, we can conclude that, 10 years after unification, there exist some basic similarities in East and West German rural elders’ objective life circumstances and subjective needs and evaluations but that, at the same time, a range of conditions associated with ageing well continue to differ. On the one hand, this is due to structural and environmental resources which were shown to be less favourable in the East German than in the West German area. The study’s limitation to two selected regions and some findings diverging from previous studies point, however, to the necessity stressed by Scharf (2001) to consider the high diversity and heterogeneity of rural areas. On the other hand, our study highlighted diverging social and activity patterns which may in turn reflect deep-rooted socio-cultural habits. Hence, despite its limitations, the study contributes to drawing both a differentiated and comprehensive picture of the many facets of older people’s lives in East and West German rural areas."
