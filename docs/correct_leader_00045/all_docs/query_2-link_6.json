Sustained criticism of existing practices, combined with needs arising from the aftermath of World War I, led Belgium to officially opt for the merit system, with the adoption of the General Statute for State Civil Servants in 1937. Under the authority of the Minister of Public Administration, various structures, within the administration or on its periphery, were also gradually set up to meet ‘in-service’ training needs common to all departments. At the beginning of the 1990s, a process of renewal and transformation of the administrative function was initiated. This so-called Copernican Reform was based on a new vision of human resources management, the setting up of new organisations, the introduction of a new management culture and a new way of working based on New Public Management ideology. Despite difficulties in implementing the reform and undeniable failures, successive federal governments have not reconsidered its main principles."
