        "text": "BSA offers complete diagnostic imaging services with state-of-the-art technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), nuclear medicine, ultrasound and X-rays.\n\nMRIs\n\nThe BSA MRI department has the highest field-strength Open MRI available. This allows for breast imaging as well as imaging of patients with pacemakers.\n\nNuclear Medicine\n\nThe Nuclear Medicine department has four cameras with advanced technology that allows for many imaging options not available anywhere else in the Texas Panhandle. This includes the only Spect-CT in Amarillo, which allows more accurate detection of abnormalities. BSA technology also includes the Dual Source CT, one of the most high-tech instruments available. Additionally, BSA uses the dual-energy chest X-ray, which has the potential to increase the chances of catching irregularities in earlier stages.\n\nBi-Plane Specials Lab\n\nBSA Health Systemâ€™s bi-plane specials lab is reducing the need for invasive surgery for patients suffering from blockages and aneurysms. The system includes cameras and imaging software with enhanced image quality, allowing for more precise diagnosis, better interventional treatment plans, less procedure time and less radiation absorption. A bi-plane system utilizes two rotating cameras, placed on either side of the patient, to capture real-time 3D X-rays. These X-rays assist the radiologists and surgeons in making accurate diagnoses of blockages or aneurysms to create a minimally-invasive treatment plan.\n\nAs compared to traditional surgery, patients who receive interventional care experience faster recovery times and smaller scars. Interventional care also reduces the need for future invasive surgeries, minimizing healthcare costs for patients."
