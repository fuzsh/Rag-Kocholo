        "text": "The Ministry of Defence (Dutch language: Ministerie van Landsverdediging , French, German language: Ministerium der Verteidigung) is the Belgian ministry responsible for national defence and the Belgian military.\n\nAs a result of the first Verhofstadt Government's plans to modernise the federal administration, all other ministries were transformed into Federal Public Services (FPS) but in August 2007 there still was no Royal Order creating the FPS Defence, although that name is already in use on official websites. The Ministry of Defence is responsible to the Minister of Defence, Pieter de Crem (Christian Democratic and Flemish).\n\nThe Chief of Defence (CHOD) is the highest official in the Ministry of Defence. General August Van Daele is the Chief of Defence since 1 January 2003. The CHOD is assisted in the exercise of his functions by a Vice-Chief of Defence (VCHOD) and a Secretary-General.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence is organised into multiple staff departments and directorates-general. The Armed Forces are subordinate to the Assistant Chief of Staff (ACOS) Operations and Training, who heads the Staff Department for Operations and Training. He is assisted by two Deputy Assistant Chiefs of Staff (DACOS), one for Operations and Planning and one for Training and Support.\n\nAnother staff department is the Staff Department for Intelligence and Security, which is led by the ACOS Intelligence and Security. This staff department is also known as the General Intelligence and Security Service and is responsible for military intelligence and security.\n\nMinisters of Defence[]\n\nYear Minister Party 1831 Albert Goblet d'Alviella Liberal 1831 Charles d'Hane de Steenhuyze Liberal 1831 V. de Failly Liberal 1831–1832 Charles de Brouckère Liberal 1832 Félix de Merode Liberal 1832–1836 Louis Evain ? 1836–1840 Jean-Pierre Willmar Liberal 1840–1842 Gérard Buzen Liberal 1842–1843 Henri de Liem Liberal 1843 Léandre Desmaisières Liberal 1843–1846 Pierre Dupont Liberal 1846 Jules Joseph d'Anethan Catholic 1846–1847 Albert Prisse Catholic 1847–1850 Félix Chazal Liberal 1850–1851 Mathieu Brialmont Liberal 1851–1855 Victor Anoul Liberal 1855–1857 Léonard Greindl ? 1857–1859 Edouard Berten Liberal 1859–1866 Félix Chazal Liberal 1866–1868 Auguste Goethals Liberal 1868–1870 Bruno Renard None (technical expert) 1870–1873 Henri Guillaume None (technical expert) 1873–1878 Séraphin Thiebault None (technical expert) 1878–1879 Bruno Renard None (technical expert) 1879–1880 Jean-Baptiste Liagre None (technical expert) 1880–1884 Guillaume Gratry None (technical expert) 1884–1893 Charles Pontus None (technical expert) 1893–1896 Jacques Brassine None (technical expert) 1896–1899 Jules Vandenpeereboom Catholic 1899–1907 Alexandre Cousebandt d'Alkemade None (technical expert) 1907–1912 Joseph Hellebaut None (technical expert) 1912 Charles de Broqueville Catholic 1912 Victor Michel None (technical expert) 1912–1917 Charles de Broqueville Catholic 1917–1918 Armand De Ceuninck None (technical expert) 1918–1920 Fulgence Masson Liberal 1920 Paul-Emile Janson Liberal 1920–1923 Albert Devèze Liberal 1923–1925 Pierre Forthomme Liberal 1925 Albert Hellebaut None (technical expert) 1925–1926 Prosper Kestens None (technical expert) 1926 Prosper Poullet Catholic 1926–1931 Charles de Broqueville Catholic 1931–1932 Léon Dens Liberal 1932 Paul Crokaert Catholic 1932 Georges Theunis Catholic 1932–1936 Albert Devèze Liberal 1936–1940 Henri Denis None (technical expert) 1940–1944 Hubert Pierlot Catholic *1942 Henri Rolin POB-BWP 1944–1945 Fernand Demets Liberal 1945–1946 Léon Mundeleer Liberal 1946–1949 Raoul de Fraiteur None (technical expert) 1949–1950 Albert Devèze Liberal 1950 Henri Moreau de Melen Christian Social Party 1950–1954 Etienne De Greef None (technical expert) 1954–1958 Antoon Spinoy PSB-BSP 1958–1961 Arthur Gilson Christian Social Party 1961–1965 Paul-Willem Segers CVP 1965–1966 Ludovic Moyersoen CVP 1966–1968 Charles Poswick PLP 1968–1972 Paul-Willem Segers CVP 1972–1979 Paul Vanden Boeynants PSC 1979–1980 José Desmarets PSC 1980 Charles Poswick PRL 1980–1981 Frank Swaelen CVP 1981–1985 Alfred Vreven PVV 1985–1988 François-Xavier de Donnéa PRL 1988–1992 Guy Coëme PS 1992–1994 Leo Delcroix CVP 1994–1995 Karel Pinxten CVP 1995 Melchior Wathelet PSC 1995–1999 Jean-Pol Poncelet PSC 1999–2007 André Flahaut PS 2007-current Pieter De Crem CD&V\n\nSee also[]\n\nMilitary of Belgium\n\nDefence Diplomacy\n\n[]"
