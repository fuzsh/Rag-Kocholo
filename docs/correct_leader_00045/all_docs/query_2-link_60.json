Her research projects on institutions for collective action (a.o. “United We Stand” and “Common Rules”) deal with the emergence, evolution and functioning of various institutions and their relationship with changes in economic growth and the household composition in Early Modern Europe. She has worked extensively on early modern marriage patterns, on which she organized an international conference in 2010, and which ties into her new NWO-funded project “Nature or Nurture?

Her recent publications include a book chapter, “Telling the Truth about Vocation: The Death Notices of the Visitandines in Brussels, 1683-1714,” in A Linking of Heaven and Earth: Studies in Religious and Cultural History in Honor of Carlos M. N. Eire, eds. Emily Michelson, Scott Taylor, and Mary Noll Venables (Ashgate 2012), and a second essay on the Visitandines’ assertion of spiritual authority and collective identity through epistolary exchange is forthcoming in 2014. Her book manuscript in preparation, Defining Community: Convent Writings in the Seventeenth-Century Spanish Netherlands, examines the biographical accounts, correspondence, obituaries, and convent chronicles of the Discalced Carmelite, Visitandine, and English Benedictine nuns in Brussels. Through the lens of the lives, aspirations, and struggles of ordinary nuns from three distinctive linguistic, spiritual, and cultural traditions, Defining Community reveals in broad terms how the community furnished the conditions for individual self-expression and how individuals shaped their own destiny by upholding collective values. By exploring the mutually reinforcing relationship between individuals and their community, her work integrates female monastic experience into a broader historical discussion of individual-community dynamics in early modern Europe. Research for this project has most recently been funded by a competitive grant from the Ohio University Research Council.\n\nCordula van Wyhe (University of York)\n\nCordula van Wyhe is Lecturer in the History of Art and Chair of Graduate Studies at the University of York.

She is currently a Research Fellow with the Swiss National Science Foundation, hosted at the University of Antwerp and the Rubenianum. Her primary research interests center on cultural production in the Counter-Reformation Southern Low Countries, with foci on women’s patronage, material culture, religious art and architecture, public performance, authorship, and image theory. She is also especially interested in questions of historical methodology and in the potential of interdisciplinarity to open up new areas of research.\n\nDr. Moran maintains a major focus on the visual culture of the early modern Low Countries Beguines, who were the subject of her dissertation and will be the topic of her first book, Unconventual Women: Visual Culture at the Court Beguinages, 1585-1794 (in preparation). She has published articles and essays on the Beguines as well as on the domestic environments of the early modern Antwerp elite and on Cornelis de Bie’s poetic art treatise The Golden Cabinet.

She received a bachelor’s degree from Wake Forest University, an MA at the University of Leiden, and a PhD from Rutgers University, the State University of New Jersey. Her recently published book, Rape in the Republic, 1609-1725: Formulating Dutch Identity (Brill 2013), reveals the significance of sex and gender in the construction of Dutch identity during the period of the Revolt of the Netherlands and beyond by examining depictions of rape in pamphlets, plays, poems, and advice manuals. She has also published articles on seventeenth-century Dutch culture in the Journal of Early Modern History and in Tijdschrijft voor Geschiedenis.\n\nHer new book-length project, tentatively titled: Dissenting Daughters: Early Modern Dutch Women’s Engagement in Political and Religious Disputes, looks at the surprising ways women took on some of the most volatile topics of their day. This book will focus on Protestant women who published polemic texts in Dutch between roughly 1638 and 1750, their male supporters and detractors, and how their literary talents allowed them to take part in public debate.\n\nPaul Vandenbroeck, Royal Museum of Fine Art, Antwerp\n\nPaul Vandenbroeck has worked with the Collection Research Department since 1980 and he has held a part-time professorship with the Social Sciences Faculty of KU Leuven since 2003.
