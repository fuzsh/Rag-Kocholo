        "text": "Founded in 1959, the Student Bar Association (SBA) is the student government of the University of Connecticut School of Law. Membership consists of students elected annually by the Day, Evening, and LLM Divisions of the Law School. The SBA manages a budget derived from student activities fees to support various student organizations, fund community activities, and to promote the quality of student life. In addition, the SBA selects students to serve on faculty committees, provides feedback to the administration, and is active in a multitude of issues affecting students at the Law School.\n\nMission\n\nWe, the students of The University of Connecticut School of Law, do hereby establish the Student Bar Association and its governing Board, whose purposes shall include:\n\nThe promotion of such activities as may be of interest to the student body;\n\nThe promotion of cordial and effective relations among students, faculty and administration of the Law School, and with the University at large, other law schools and the community; and\n\nThe expression and representation of student opinion on matters pertaining to the law, to the Law School and to the Student Bar Association.\n\nExecutive Board 2024-2025\n\nPresident: Haley Anderson\n\nVice President: Maurice Maitland Jr.\n\nChief Administrative Officer: Deven Pierre\n\nChief Financial Officer: Jase Olavarria\n\nParliamentarian: Lallane Guiao-Seng\n\nABA Representative: Nayeli Contreras\n\nStaff Advisor: Julian M. Torres\n\nBlack Law Students Association\n\nMission\n\nThe Black Law Students Association (BLSA) articulates and promotes the professional needs and goals of Black law students. Our mission is to provide a comfortable environment and support system where students can share ideas, help each other during their law school experience, and ensure that our voice is heard on the law school campus. The main focus of BLSA is to promote the success of people of color in the legal community, on the law school campus, and in society as a whole.\n\nOur organization works to instill in Black law students a greater awareness of their role as lawyers in the Black community. BLSA is committed to fostering and encouraging professional excellence among Black attorneys and the American legal profession as a whole. Members also work to encourage law schools, legal fraternities, and associations to use their expertise and influence to bring about change in the legal system in order to make it responsive to the needs of the Black community.\n\nLike many student groups on campus, we serve as a social support system as well as a political machine that seeks to continue dialog on issues revolving around race and the law and to prevent and fight racism in all sectors of society.\n\nOfficers 2024-2025\n\nCo-Presidents: Farah Jean & Joshua Maddox\n\nVice President: Jhada Close\n\nSecretary: Shakira Gray\n\nTreasurer: Darlene Maxilus\n\nParliamentarian: Maurice Maitland\n\nAcademic Chair: Arianna Fleuriot\n\nEvents Coordinator: Aaliyah Kerr\n\nSocial Media Coordinator: Henry Seyue\n\nCommunity Service Chair: Tori-Ann Gayle\n\nAdvisor: Willajeanne McLean\n\nInquiries\n\nPlease direct any questions to blsa@uconn.edu\n\nLike UConn Law BLSA on Facebook.\n\nAmerican Constitution Society (ACS) is the \"left-leaning equivalent of the Federalist Society.\" ACS believes that law should be a force to improve the lives of all people. ACS works for positive change by shaping debate on vitally important legal and constitutional issues through development and promotion of high-impact ideas to opinion leaders and the media; by building networks of lawyers, law students, judges, and policymakers, dedicated to those ideas; and by countering the activist conservative legal movement that has sought to erode our enduring constitutional values.\n\nMission\n\nACS presents a compelling vision of core constitutional values such as genuine equality, liberty, justice, and the rule of law. It is quickly debunking conservative buzzwords such as “originalism,” \"textualism,\" and “strict construction,” that use neutral-sounding language, but all too often lead to conservative policy outcomes. One of ACS’s principal missions is nurturing the next generation of progressive lawyers, judges, policy experts, legislators, and academics. In addition, ACS has led the charge to promote up-or-down votes on judicial nominations by engaging key decision makers.\n\nOfficers 2024-2025\n\nPresident: Kenny Redmond\n\nVice President: Chris Torre\n\nSecretary: Deven Pierre\n\nTreasurer: Kellen Voland\n\nEvents Coordinator: Peter Jones\n\nSocial Media & Outreach Coordinator: Molly Meyer\n\nDEI Chairs: Laiba Qureshi & Sashel Marquis-Wedderburn\n\nAdvisor: Joseph MacDougald\n\nFor More Information\n\nFor more information contact lawacs@uconn.edu\n\nThe Federalist Society at UConn Law helps add to the on-campus discussion of legal and policy issues. The local chapter hosts speaker events and debates to help promote a well-rounded legal education where multiple perspectives are explored in order to promote academic and intellectual diversity.\n\nThe Federalist Society is a 501(c)(3) organization which is non-partisan and not for profit; The Federalist Society does not endorse political candidates, policy initiatives, or policies in general.\n\nMission Statement\n\nThe Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies is a group of conservatives and libertarians interested in the current state of the legal order. It is founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be. The Society seeks both to promote an awareness of these principles and to further their application through its activities.\n\nThis entails reordering priorities within the legal system to place a premium on individual liberty, traditional values, and the rule of law. It also requires restoring the recognition of the importance of these norms among lawyers, judges, law students and professors. In working to achieve these goals, the Society has created a conservative and libertarian intellectual network that extends to all levels of the legal community.\n\nOfficers 2024-2025\n\nPresident: Tal Arkin\n\nExecutive Vice President: Henry Seyue\n\nVice President of Finance: Dominic Nazzaro\n\nVice President of Special Events: Olivia Kappel\n\nVice President of Membership: Jack Rubino\n\nAdvisor: Kiel Brennan-Marquez\n\nFor More Information\n\nFor more information please contact federalistsociety@uconn.edu\n\nThe International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) organizes law students and lawyers to develop and enforce a set of legal and human rights for refugees and displaced persons.
