        "text": "W.J Mangold Memorial Hospital and Cogdell Clinics Adopt New Patient-Friendly Cardiac Digital Health Solution for Early AFib Detection and Diagnosis\n\nW.J. Mangold Memorial Hospital has integrated innovative wearable ECG technology from Cardiac Insight, Inc., expanding its offerings to patients to better diagnose atrial fibrillation (AFib or AF), the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia, both in-office and through telehealth. An estimated 2.7 to 6.1 million people in the U.S. live with this arrhythmia. While AFib itself is typically not life-threatening, complications from AFib include increased risk for heart problems and heart failure, and increased risk for stroke.\n\nThe Cardea SOLO™ disposable wearable ECG sensor is applied to the patient at our Clinic. After a seven-day wear period, the patient returns the sensor to our office by mail or in person. Cardea SOLO's algorithm-based software automatically analyzes ECG data to detect abnormal rhythms including AFib. Within five minutes of connecting the patient's sensor to the Cardea SOLO, a comprehensive report is produced to direct clinical decision-making and begin treatment, if required, as soon as possible.\n\nFor more information, please contact Elvia Holguin, Clinic Manager or make an appointment to see your primary care provider in Lockney at 806-652-3373 or Silverton at 806-475-5800.\n\nNew ER/Hospitalist Physician Joins W.J.

Mangold Memorial Hospital and the Cogdell Clinics have revised some of the business office policies to strengthen the ability to collect past account balances and continue to provide services to residents of our community. At any time that the patient has an outstanding patient account balance from previous services and regular minimum payments are not being made, patient will be required to make one minimum monthly payment along with their current co-pay/deductible/coinsurance prior to service being rendered. If patient is unable or unwilling to do so, they will be asked to re-schedule their appointment for a later time when they are able to make such required payments. If the accumulated outstanding balances exceed $500, and regular minimum monthly payments are not being made, they will be required to visit with the Chief Financial Officer, Butch Forrest, about their outstanding balance prior to receiving treatment and appointment will be rescheduled for a later date. Copies of these policies can be viewed under the \"About Us\" section of this website under Business Office Policies.\n\nMANGOLD MEMORIAL INFUSION CENTER SCHEDULED TO OPEN\n\nW.J.
