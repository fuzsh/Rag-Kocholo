        "text": "CTCG Activities and achievements\n\nCTCG Workplan | pdf\n\nJuly 2022\n\nTwo new advice pilots to improve clinical trials in Europe\n\nThe Accelerating Clinical Trials in the EU (ACT EU) initiative is today launching two advice pilots aimed at improving the quality of applications for clinical trials, the foundation for the development of safe and effective medicines in Europe.\n\nACT EU is a collaboration between the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Heads of Medicines Agencies (HMA) in the Member States and the European Commission (EC), which seeks to transform how clinical trials are initiated, designed, and run.\n\nThe first pilot offers developers of medicinal products scientific advice on clinical trials and on requirements for marketing authorisation applications (MAA). Assessors of clinical trials are not consistently involved in scientific advice procedures for MAAs, and vice versa. In this pilot programme, the Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP), coordinated by EMA, and the Clinical Trials Coordination Group (CTCG), managed by HMA, will be the bodies assessing incoming requests of a scientific nature. The SAWP is responsible for advice on marketing authorisation applications and the Member States represented at CTCG oversee clinical trial applications (CTA). This pilot consolidates the views of these two groups to minimise avoidable divergences. It is the first time that both entities are providing joint scientific advice on clinical trials.\n\nThe second pilot is coordinated by the CTCG and provides technical and regulatory support on the dossier of a CTA prior to its submission through the Clinical Trials Information System. Before this pilot, applicants could only receive technical and regulatory support at national level from the Member State evaluating the application. The pre-CTA pilot will provide consolidated views of the Member States concerned on pre-submission topics. The scope of this pilot covers a number of areas such as advice on regulatory aspects of low interventional clinical trial status and submission of trials with decentralised elements or complex designs, to name a few.\n\nStarting today, developers of medicinal products who wish to receive advice on the requirements for a MAA or a CTA may apply to these pilots. The duration of both pilots will be evaluated over time based on data and feedback collected from applicants. All this information will inform a possible change of scope and a final decision from the ACT EU steering group on how to optimise clinical trial support in the future.\n\nBy strengthening the coordination of the European medicines regulatory network, these advice pilots offer applicants additional support to enhance the quality of their applications for marketing and/or clinical trial authorisation.\n\nGuidance for applicants: pre-CTA advice pilot\n\nGuidance for applicants: SAWP CTCG pilot on scientific advice\n\nSimultaneous National Scientific Advice (SNSA)\n\nSNSA is intended to be used in situations where an applicant wishes to obtain national scientific advice from more than one NCA at the same time. The format is intended to enhance the quality and consistency of such advice. Following endorsement by the Heads of Medicine Agencies (HMA), phase 2 of the SNSA pilot will run for a two-year period until the end of 2024.\n\nIn conjunction with the ACT-EU initiative, this phase of the SNSA pilot will have a specific focus on scientific advice to facilitate clinical trials (CT) within Europe. It will facilitate sponsors / developers to obtain clinical trial-related national scientific advice from National Competent Authorities (NCA) in Member States (MS) where they intend to perform clinical trials. The experience gained during the SNSA pilot will be used to further develop the process and the provision of clinical trial-related advice as part of ACT EU Priority Action 7 (ACT EU PA7).\n\nThe following are examples of scenarios where developers may choose to seek SNSA:\n\nIn preparation for clinical trials (CT) applications to be performed in more than one MS. Where during the SNSA the involved NCAs agree that the questions raised would benefit from discussions at the Clinical Trial Coordination Group (CTCG) level, it is also possible to obtain CTCG-coordinated clinical trial expert feedback as part of the SNSA procedure.\n\nPrior to applying for funding grants to support non-commercial clinical trials (academic researchers).\n\nTo inform the early-stage development of innovative products for which clinical trials are planned, e.g. phase I/II clinical trials, especially where there is limited existing regulatory guidance. EMA scientific advice should continue to be used for scientific advice related to the suitability of the proposed clinical development to support a centralized marketing authorisation application.\n\nPrior to clinical trials intended to facilitate repurposing of authorised medicinal products e.g. to support new innovative therapeutic indications.\n\nMore detailed information on how to apply for SNSA and additional documents and information can be found at Heads of Medicines Agencies: EU-Innovation Network (EU-IN) (hma.eu) (search for SNSA).\n\nIn order to clarify the scope of scientific advice activities, ACT EU mapped information on voluntary procedures available within the European medicines regulatory network: Accelerating Clinical Trials in the EU (ACT EU) | European Medicines Agency (europa.eu) (look at PA 7).\n\nDecentralised Clinical Trials (EU DCT)\n\nSince March 2022, the Clinical Trials Coordination Group (CTCG) is responsible for the project management of the EU Decentralised Clinical Trials (EU DCT) project.\n\nThe EU DCT project is part of the priority actions conducted in the context of the Accelerating Clinical Trials in the EU (ACT EU), which started at the same time as the launch of the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) and the implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (CTR).\n\nThe DCT project represents a broad collaboration across the European Medicines Regulatory Network with a cross-disciplinary project group including amongst others clinical trial authorisation experts, ethical experts and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) inspectors across Member States.\n\nIt aims to provide a harmonised and transparent approach for the use of DCT elements in clinical trials. To this end, a Recommendation paper on the use of DCT elements in clinical trials is planned to be published by the end of 2022."
