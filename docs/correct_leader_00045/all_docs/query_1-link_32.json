He obtained a Licenciate degree in applied economics from Antwerp University (Belgium), an MA in sociology and a PhD in management of organizations from Columbia University, where he studied with doctoral fellowships from the Ford Foundation (U.S.) and ICM (Belgium). He was elected a fellow of the Strategic Management Society and a fellow of the Academy of Management.\n\nHis research has focused on the role of strategy-making in firm evolution. In particular, he has studied the strategy-making processes involved in how companies enter into new businesses and exit from existing ones to secure continued adaptation. In 2003 he received an honorary doctorate from the Copenhagen Business School for his contributions to the study of corporate innovation and entrepreneurship. Professor Burgelman has been on the faculty of Antwerp University, New York University, Harvard Business School (as a Marvin Bower Fellow), and Cambridge University (as a Visiting Professor of Marketing Strategy and Innovation at the Judge Business School). He has been elected a fellow of the Strategic Management Society and a fellow of the Academy of Management. He has published many articles in leading academic and professional journals, as well as some 200 case studies of companies and organizations in many different industries."
