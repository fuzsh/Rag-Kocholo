        "text": "It has already been dubbed “the kamikaze coalition”: Belgium’s incoming government, which is to be sworn in at the royal palace on Saturday 138 days after federal elections, could be the most combustible administration in the country’s history.\n\nThe government will be led by Charles Michel, 38, the country’s youngest prime minister since 1841 and a scion of a liberal political family.\n\nHis MR party is the only French-speaking one in a precarious coalition with three Flemish parties. The imbalance appears to be made greater still by the presence in government for the first time of the separatist Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie (N-VA).\n\nThe others are the Flemish Christian democrat CD&V and the Flemish liberal Open VLD.\n\nThe tensions are likely to be further strained when the coalition attempts to roll out radical economic and social reforms. The main task will be to balance the budget: at just over 100% of GDP, Belgium’s net debt is one of the highest in the eurozone. As well as lowering taxes, the new government plans to raise the pension age from 65 to 67 in 2030, and tighten immigration and asylum rules.\n\nThe proposals, contained in a 207-page coalition programme, have already triggered protests from Belgium’s socialist parties and trade unions. Marc Goblet, the secretary general of the country’s second biggest union, ABVV/FGTB, has talked of a “permanent guerrilla campaign” against the coalition.\n\nThe French-speaking socialist PS party of the outgoing prime minister, Elio Di Rupo, said the plans “will hit citizens hard, they’ll work more to earn less”. It has also been critical of Michel, who said in the runup to last May’s elections that he would never partner with the N-VA.\n\nPhilippe Van Parijs, a politics professor at the Université catholique de Louvain, said strikes and other industrial actions were inevitable. “The main problem of the government will be less the relationship of the language communities and more the relationship with the trade unions,” he said.\n\nMichel’s MR party came third in the May elections, with 9.3% of the vote, winning 20 out of 150 parliamentary seats. The N-VA was the largest party with 20.4% and 33 seats, but no Francophone party was ready to work in an administration headed by the separatists. N-VA’s leader, Bart De Wever, will remain mayor of Antwerp and not join the coalition.\n\nThe 14-strong cabinet has by law to be split evenly between French and Flemish speakers, giving MR seven ministers, with party stalwart Didier Reynders staying on as Foreign Minister. On the Flemish side, N-VA grabbed three key ministerial positions with finance, defence and the interior, while the CD&V gets the justice ministry and Open VLD has social affairs.\n\nMichel has enjoyed a rapid rise to power in the shadow of his father, Louis Michel, a former foreign minister and European commissioner. He became a barrister in 1995 at 20 after studying law in Brussels and Amsterdam, but was already involved in politics as a teenager. Elected to provincial council at 18, and to the Belgian parliament at 23, Michel became a minister in the Walloon government at 24, and joined the federal government for the first time in 2007, when he became development aid minister. He is also the mayor of the nearby town of Wavre.\n\nMichel will be the first prime minister appointed by King Philippe, who ascended to the throne in July last year. Although he is only Belgium’s second French-speaking prime minister in 40 years, Michel can claim impressive cross-cultural credentials: the Michel family has roots in Hoegaarden, the Flemish town famed for its wheat beer. And his family’s political stronghold is Jodoigne, just over a mile from the line between Wallonia and Flanders.\n\nStill, the auguries are not in his favour. Michel will be Belgium’s first francophone liberal prime minister since 1938. The government of the last, Paul-Émile Janson, survived for just five months."
