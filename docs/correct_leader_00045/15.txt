‘Janson has the multidisciplinary and multilingual approach that is necessary in Belgium and at the border of different cultures.’

‘Long-lasting collaboration with the same people builds confidence and improves the quality of the advice they give.’

‘One of the largest litigation teams in the Belgian market, and a reference in corporate disputes. Built around Dominique Blommaert, who is the absolute rainmaker of Janson.’

‘Dominique Blommaert: fierce courtroom fighter, strong negotiator. Jens Bennoot: up and coming.’

‘Pragmatic, efficient, complementary, reacting very quickly, always searching for the best solution for clients.’

‘Dominique Blommaert and Ruth Declerck are very reactive, no-nonsense, think out of the box, and are very convincing. The feeling is that they really defend our rights in a very constructive and intelligent way without wasting any time.’

‘A team that is available and responsive. They are to the point and don’t waste time with pointless discussions.’

‘Jens Benoot and Lydie Van Muylem particularly stood out as they are client-driven and good practitioners who know their subject and know how to use the right arguments in litigation matters.’
