Since 2013, the Tourist Office has been located in place Paul-Emile Janson in a building displaying striking Louis XVI-style façades and which stands above medieval caves of the 12th century, today an exhibition space.

Whether you are a passing tourist or a resident of Tournai, push the door of this new establishment to pick up the best information about Tournai and the rest of Picardy Wallonia.
