Located at the corner of Avenue Louise and Rue Paul Émile Janson, a few meters from the Horta House, an Art Nouveau masterpiece, the Edition building is situated in a particular urban context where architectural and patrimonial richness are combined. The building itself, dating from the 1960s, also displays a certain architectural value, notably through its load-bearing Silex concrete facade, specific to that period. It seemed obvious that this Brussels heritage should be preserved and enhanced during the renovation.

The main objective, guiding the whole design of the project: "to make new out of old". On the façade, the character of the original building is preserved, while adding contemporary aesthetic and functional touches. On the interior, we transform, particularly in terms of the building's functionality. While the first floor retains its original commercial functions, the office floors become quality housing.
