Walter Ganshof van der Meersch, son of a Brugge lawyer, attended schools in Brugge and – after World War I, where he served as a volunteer – the UK and France. He graduated in law from the University of Bruxelles in 1921 and worked in the law firm of future Belgian Prime Minister Paul-Émile Janson. Ganshof van der Meersch was subsequently appointed deputy attorney in Bruxelles, deputy attorney at the military court and, eventually, Attorney General at the Court of Appeal. During this time he was also a lecturer in the department of law at the University of Bruxelles, notably in the French as well as in the Flemish speaking sections.

In early 1940, Ganshof van der Meersch became Attorney General at the military court and was commissioned to oversee cases of collaboration with the Germans in Belgium. Under the German occupation he was imprisoned three times for several months each and was subject to disbarment. Following another imprisonment in March 1943, he went into hiding and escaped to London. There, the Belgian exile government appointed him High Commissioner for Legal Certainty, who was responsible for the co-ordination of resistance activities and the prosecution of collaborators. After the war, he returned to his post as Attorney General.
