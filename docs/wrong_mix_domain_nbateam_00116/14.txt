Every season, games between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics are one of the most anticipated matchups fans like to see. Both teams will be facing each other for the first time this season, and some of their former players decided to show up at the TD Garden to watch the game.

Kevin Garnett and Metta World Peace are in attendance to witness the showdown of the NBA's greatest rivalry, something that they were both a part of in 2010 when the Lakers beat the Celtics in the Finals.

Both teams have had their share of struggles this year, but the Celtics seem to have figured things out and are playing great as of late. They are currently on a five-game winning streak and are primed to make a deep run in the playoffs.

The Lakers on the other hand are slowly falling down the Western Conference playoff race. After ending 2018 as the fourth best team in the conference, they are now in the tenth place after a couple of losing streaks for the month of January.

Nevertheless, the Lakers-Celtics rivalry is still expected to make headlines. This is the first time that former teammates LeBron James and Kyrie Irving will be part of this historic matchup. Both teams have young, promising stars that would like to show who's better over the other.

Most importantly, one of these teams could be the potential landing spot of All-Star forward Anthony Davis this summer.

Regardless of the standings, the win-loss records, the rumors, and everything else, the Lakers and Celtics are expected to put on a show.
