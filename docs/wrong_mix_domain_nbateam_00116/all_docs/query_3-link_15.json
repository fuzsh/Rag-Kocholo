        "text": "Metta World Peace, the player formerly known as Ron Artest, won his first and only NBA championship with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2010, when he famously hit the dagger 3-pointer against the Boston Celtics in Game 7 of the Finals.\n\nFor those that need a reminder of what that looked like, here’s a clip.\n\nIt truly never gets old.\n\nOnce the Lakers secured their championship, Artest was able to drop his single “Champions” in time for the team’s championship parade on June 21. The song didn’t break any records, nor did it get serious radio play, but it was a fun song for Lakers fans to celebrate to. I’ll say this much: it is objectively the best song about the Lakers winning a championship in 2010 that’s ever been made.\n\nIt’s been 10 years since the song’s release, but apparently there’s a second part to the song that hasn’t been released yet. In an interview on the “Dan Patrick Show,” World Peace said that Dr. Dre produced “Champions, Part Two” in 2010, but it never saw the light of day:\n\n“I went to the studio, Dr. Dre recorded me ... My record ‘Champions’ came out, so Dr. Dre actually produced ‘Champions, Part Two,’ which, I never put out. It’s tucked away somewhere in his hard drive.”\n\nArtest’s decision was probably influenced by the reception the song got, but I, personally, like to think that he had it loaded up in case the Lakers won again in 2011. Whatever the reason was, that was 10 years ago — the song is a Lakers fan favorite now, and now that this is public knowledge, “Champions, Part Two,” has to be released.\n\nIf not for me, then for those who make going hard a lifestyle."
