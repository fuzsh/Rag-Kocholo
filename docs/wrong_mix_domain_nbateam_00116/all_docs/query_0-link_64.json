        "text": "Metta World Peace on his support for Dwight Howard this season: “Of course because you never know what somebody is going through in their life, you never know what somebody is going through physically, mentally, you never know if somebody is not ready for this pressure, you never know what anybody is going through. All you can do is support. Even as a teammate, a fan, a coach or whatever, you just have to be there by their side. I learned that from playing with Derek Fisher. I learned that just being egotistical early in my career. You gotta be there for your teammates because all you have is each other. I know that for a fact. You’re not going to win with just one person. At the end of the day, when you win, it says the Lakers champions or the Heat champions last year, it doesn’t say one name. We need everybody, even the 12th man.”\n\nWorld Peace, who has been suspended by the league 11 times since 2003, laid out why he shouldn’t be blamed for his latest transgression. And perhaps many of them too. “I came to the NBA in ’99. I started watching NBA basketball, like, in ’95. The Knicks, Miami, I was a fan of those type of playoff series that took place in the NBA on TV and I wanted to play in that atmosphere,” World Peace said. “So as a young kid I had to make a decision: I’m not going to be scared to play in that type of game. That’s my mind frame. You look at [Michael] Jordan against Detroit, Jordan had to grow. They were bullying him. so I’m like, ‘OK, that’s never going to happen to me. When I get to the league, I dare somebody from, like, the Detroit Pistons to try to bully me.’ “I was in the league when I was a rookie, I remember Alonzo Mourning saying, ‘You come in here again, young fella, blahblahblah.’ I went in there again. Nineteen years old. Do it.”\n\nMetta World Peace didn’t want to talk. No way. No comment. Of course, he couldn’t help himself and began a 16-minute discourse on a variety of topics. First and foremost: The NBA isn’t doing enough to protect Lakers teammate Dwight Howard. “Dwight gets fouled a lot intentionally. Dwight goes up, they push him in the back,” World Peace said Saturday. “So I’ll let you guys do your research from here on out, just monitor how Dwight gets fouled. Is it an intentional foul or not? Because y’all aren’t looking for those things unless it’s brought to your attention. “I’m not complaining. Sometimes he gets hurt. Those are intentional fouls. He’s getting hurt. He got hurt when he got pushed in Orlando [last season]. These guys are coming down on his back. He had to get surgery as a result of that. And he missed games. He’s not complaining. He’s a little upset but he goes out there and plays. And those [fouls] are multiple occasions.”\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward Metta World Peace put on his Cookie Monster pajamas and came to the rescue of his nephew and brother who had been detained by police outside his condo complex earlier this week, according to the Los Angeles Times. Unknown to World Peace, three men working for his Artest Media Group were shooting a scene about life on the streets and were staging a shootout with fake guns when the police showed up. “I’m in my underwear, and my son says, ‘Hey Dad, there’s police at the door,'” World Peace told the Times on Wednesday. “So I jump out. I’m nervous. I see these police with rifles and scopes. I’m like, ‘What happened?’ I don’t know what’s going on at this point. ‘What happened, what happened?’ And then the police was like, ‘The building is being taken over by guys downstairs.'”\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, Metta World Peace was awakened to a bizarre scenario. “I’m in my underwear and my son says, ‘Hey dad, there’s police at the door,'” World Peace said in an interview with The Times after the Lakers beat the Boston Celtics on Wednesday evening. “So I jump out, I’m nervous. I see these police with rifles and scopes. “I’m like, ‘What happened?’ I don’t know what’s going on at this point. ‘What happened, what happened?’ And then the police was like, ‘The building is being taken over by guys downstairs.'”"
