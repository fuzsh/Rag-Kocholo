        "text": "BOSTON — Metta World Peace said he knew going to New York would be “an adventure’’ and it is living up to the billing.\n\nThe Queensbridge product has not only found himself out of the rotation but has found himself mentioned in trade talks that could send him to Toronto in a package for point guard Kyle Lowry. Sunday is when he can be traded under NBA bylaws regarding free agents who signed over the summer.\n\nWorld Peace played 11 seconds in Friday’s 90-86 loss in Boston.\n\n“Actually the reason I came to New York is because I wanted to try to win a ring in New York,’’ World Peace said. “That was the only reason. That’s my goal. My goal never changes. It was a risky goal. I didn’t weigh all my options. I didn’t weigh nothing. It was a challenge. That said, I’m ready for whatever is presented.’’\n\nWorld Peace had spent his whole career wondering if he ever would get to be a Knick. But the general manager who signed him, Glen Grunwald, was fired four days before training camp.\n\n“There’s nothing to deal with,’’ World Peace said of the trade reports. “It’s like, ‘What am I dealing with? I’m getting paid to play basketball.’ Some guys take trade rumors more personal. What am I dealing with? I work hard. I still can play. I love challenges. All the teams that called me, I wanted an adventure — China, Knicks, Arena Football. This is an adventure. This is good. You have to be ready for the unpredictable. I’m glad I can go through unpredictable situations.’’\n\nAsked how tough it would be to go to a rebuilding situation in Toronto, the former Ron Artest said: “Whatever team I’m on, you’re never rebuilding. When you get Metta World, you’re officially a championship mentality when you get World Peace. Talking about the division, I heard that a lot. But that’s not Metta World. He brings championship [hopes]. That’s what I do.’’\n\nWorld Peace started in Cleveland on Tuesday, but when Kenyon Martin returned, he was a DNP Wednesday in the win over the Bulls. He has been out of the rotation in three of the last four games.\n\n“The team is stacked,’’ World Peace said. “I knew coming into the season, it wasn’t going to be the same but I was ready.’’\n\nCeltics president Danny Ainge had an interesting remark in the Boston Globe, saying he would prefer not to make the playoffs if the club sputtered in below .500. The Celtics were in first place entering Friday’s match with the Knicks at 10-14.\n\n“Making the playoffs is not a goal,’’ Ainge said. “I need to explain that a little bit.’’ He went on to say he’d rather not be a playoff team if the club isn’t playing well and have no chance of doing well.\n\nThere’s a lot of speculation teams prefer missing the playoffs for this superdraft. However, the supposedly rebuilding Celtics haven’t yet fielded their full team with point guard Rajon Rondo.\n\nIman Shumpert played after suffering a bruised left knee against Chicago."
