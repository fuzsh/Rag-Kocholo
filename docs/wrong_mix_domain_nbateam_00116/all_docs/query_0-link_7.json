        "text": "The man behind one of the more infamous shots in Boston Celtics history would be willing to step in as head coach. Former NBA All-Star and champion Metta World Peace took to Twitter on Sunday to let the world know that if the Boston Celtics came calling he would pick up the phone.\n\nWith Brad Stevens moving to president of basketball operations to replace the retiring Danny Ainge, the Celtics have a head coach vacancy this offseason. World Peace would be willing to make peace with Boston fans after his heroics in the 2010 NBA Finals:\n\nWhoever does end up landing the Celtics job will have a supporter in World Peace."
