        "text": "Right before the 2013 playoffs, a friend of mine—a Knicks fan—was talking big about his team's chances at the title. His case consisted mostly of all the improvements the Knicks had made, how far they had come in the last few years. The reasoning was startling, revealing, and practically begged a comeback.\n\n\"Just because the Knicks get better, it doesn't mean they're automatically awarded a title,\" I said. \"They still have to beat other teams.\"\n\nIt's too easy to chalk this attitude, one not uncommon among the orange and blue faithful, to New York narcissism (basketball or otherwise). Nor is it an odd combination of Stockholm Syndrome and Dolan Fatigue. Rather, this view of the Knicks provides a crucial insight into the franchise. The Knicks just have to be good enough for the city to take pride in them. Like no other team in basketball, maybe even in all of sports, the franchise is a cultural institution as much as an athletic one. Only the Red Sox, back when they were wandering in the wilderness and prevented by metaphysics from bringing home the bacon, have been in a similar position.\n\nThat's why the Knicks' signing of Metta World Peace, formerly of the Lakers and the name Ron Artest, has so much resonance. Artest (sorry, still can't) is arguably the best player to come of New York City in the last ten, maybe even twenty, years. Really, think about it. Speaking as a major Lamar Odom fan, who even attempted to defend the Kardashian period by calling Khloe \"the complicted one,\" I'd still say Artest has netted out with the strongest legacy. Marbury's a disaster area. Roy Hibbert? Too soon. [Editor's note: Lance Stephenson! He's practically Ron Ron Jr.—tough, unruly, great D, master of the ill-advised three!]\n\nThere have been great highs and lows to Artest's career, from his recent work advocating mental health awareness in under-served communities to The Malice at the Palace. But basketball, people, basketball! Before the brawl, Artest was the most dominant defensive force in basketball and an adept enough scorer to pass himself off as the Pacers' top option—a Pacers team considered serious contenders at the time.\n\nBut that was a lifetime ago. The Artest coming to New York is, at best, a vocal leader and automatic importer of extra toughness. Other than that, he's a bulky swingman too old to stick with speed and never big enough to play a power game. He's a chucker without much of a shot. Everybody loves Artest today, if only in a look-at-the-crazy-athlete kind of way. As a player, though, his greatest asset is his personality. Or, to split the difference between German philosophy and seventh grade cheerleading, his spirit.\n\nNowhere does this aspect of Artest ring out as clearly as in New York. And really, it's of more interest to the fans than his teammates. Artest, regardless of whether you agree with my assessment of his basketball track record, is unmistakably New York. He's a product of Queensbridge, the housing project immortalized by generation upon generation of rap legends, from Marley Marl to Mobb Deep and Nas. Japanese tourists take bus ferried pilgrimages there. There are t-shirts and hoodies.\n\nPoint is, Queensbridge is legendary and Artest is its patron saint of sports. In mealy-mouthed sports circles, \"thug\" is the ultimate NBA pejorative. Artest, though, is a \"thug\" in the every-single-rap-song-to-come-out-of-his-home-turf way: a rugged, colorful, unpredictable, loyal and abrasive guy whose presence is undeniable.\n\nMaybe I'm romanticizing the term or granting it more depth and flexibility than it was ever meant to have. But the ways that Artest can be described positively seem to always track back to hip-hop: \"gully\" and the bottomless \"real\" spring to mind. That's the place his game springs from, but above all else, it's an ethos, an assertion—real or imagined—of Ron Ron's personality.\n\nIf basketball at its best is inextricably linked to personality, it can often be reduced to it. And basketball-as-personality inevitably leads back to culture. Hence the overly broad Ron Artest-hip-hop nexus. And the ways that Artest is a perfect fit for the Knicks, a homecoming that counts for something when sports homecomings almost invariably go wrong. The Knicks stand for New York even when the team couldn't have less to do with the so-called \"City Game\" or all the life that surrounds it.\n\nIn fact, Pete Axthelm's seminal book of that name chronicles the 1970's Knicks and, in parallel, the street ball kings that ruled the city courts at the same time. Those Knicks couldn't have been less street. Sure, Clyde Frazier had his flamboyant fashions, and Earl Monroe was a legend on playgrounds up and down the East Coast. But the team played a highly cerebral, understated brand of basketball that remains lionized by purists to this day. Clyde's game was strictly meat and potatoes and Earl the Pearl's New York tenure was defined by his ability to tone down his game for the good of the system (much to the chagrin of Knicks lifer Woody Allen, for one).\n\nSyllogism, fallacy, call it what you will. The connection between the Knicks and the rest of the city—basketball and otherwise—is inviolate. The Mecca may refer to the Garden or the city itself. Who even knows anymore.\n\nThat's why Artest to the Knicks is such a perfect story. It doesn't even matter if he can play. All the world needs is that Knicks jersey with his name on it. This isn't the prodigal son come home, it's Artest going to the only place where, as an athlete, he can be lauded for things other than his on-court performance. Maybe it's a distraction from trying to win. But the team is good enough to worry about its other responsibilities. Across town, in Brooklyn, they're winning the arms race and gunning for the title. The Knicks have a duty to their city that goes beyond that.\n\nWhen I brought up the Artest with the friend from the beginning of this piece, he grinned ear-to-ear. There was nothing to say, no debate to have, no hot take to support. Artest is Artest. New York is New York. And it was good."
