        "text": "In 2011, the man formerly known as Ron Artest had a dream. And that dream was to bring peace to the world.\n\nTo help with this goal, Artest, then of the Los Angeles Lakers, decided to change his name. And so “Metta World Peace” was born, or “Loving Kindness World Peace” if you translate the name fully into English.\n\nBut Metta’s drive for Peace on Earth has met with mixed results, so he is shifting his focus to a new pursuit.\n\nPanda bears.\n\nAccording to Chinese news outlet China Daily, World Peace has signed a one-year deal worth $1.43 million US to play for the Sichuan Blue Whales. To commemorate the occasion, World Peace said he is changing his name to “Panda Friend.”\n\nMany people were skeptical that this report was correct. And they were proved right when Metta chimed in on Twitter.\n\nThe man now called \"The Panda’s Friend\" will likely make his Chinese Basketball Association debut in late November."
