        "text": "LOS ANGELES – Metta World Peace didn’t remember the foul probably because the referees didn’t call one when he inadvertently elbowed Denver’s Kenneth Faried during Monday’s loss in Denver. The NBA, however, didn’t let the play go unnoticed and retroactively slapped World Peace with a flagrant-2 foul Thursday.\n\nThe incident occurred late in the third quarter, when World Peace appeared to have hit Faried’s head as both players went for a rebound of Corey Brewer’s miss.\n\nEven watching a replay of the final seconds of the third quarter didn’t jog his memory. World Peace and teammate Dwight Howard lead the league in flagrant fouls with fiveapiece. If either player commits even a flagrant-1 foul, the lesser offense, he will receive a one-game suspension. Another flagrant-2 foul would result in a two-game suspension.\n\n“I seriously don’t remember that,” he said in a pregame interview in which he claimed not to remember much of anything, including how he got teeth marks on his elbow. “The only thing that I really remember is having children.”\n\nWorld Peace was reluctant to say anything regarding the foul during the 16-minute pregame chat for two reasons. One, he said he wasn’t in the mood to complain or point fingers at opposing players who guard him closely.\n\n“I don’t want to complain for guys coming up my back and smashing because then I have to complain. I feel I’m tougher than that,” he said, referring to fellow NBA players who have suffered bloody mouths and noses without calling for a foul.\n\n“It’s hard for me to talk about it.”\n\nSecondly, World Peace said he simply is doing his job, so what else is there to say?\n\n“You box a guy out, what are you going to do? I don’t know what to say but I’m still going to play hard,” he added.\n\nThe Lakers forward was suspended one game earlier this month after a review of a flagrant-1 foul he received for an incident in a game against Detroit. He was forced to sit after he grabbed the Pistons’ Brandon Knight around the neck and hit him in the jaw.\n\nCoach Mike D’Antoni didn’t seem too concerned with World Peace’s latest foul, saying the league “obviously felt it was warranted.”\n\n“He just has to stay away from that, just like Dwight and Kobe (Bryant) with technicals. They have to understand that we can’t afford to lose them, have to understand the gravity of each game and stay away from it,” D’Antoni said.\n\n“But at the same time, they can’t back down and play scared. They have to play their game.”\n\nBLAKE’S CONTRIBUTION\n\nThe Lakers are 10-5 since Steve Blake returned from an abdominal injury, a fact that has not gone unnoticed by D’Antoni.\n\nThe coach credited Blake’s leadership and a set rotation for the bench’s inspired play during the Lakers’ recent run. The Lakers have won 11 of their past 16 games thanks in part to Blake, who is averaging 4.9 points and 3.3 assists, Antawn Jamison, who leads the second unit with 8.9 points and 4.5 rebounds, and Jodie Meeks at 7.8 points and 1.9 rebounds.\n\nOn Thursday, the bench combined for 52 points in the Lakers’ 116-94 victory against Minnesota.\n\n“(The bench) is getting a little more confidence by playing through some tough situations,” D’Antoni said. “Having Steve come back settled the second team down. They have played really well.”"
