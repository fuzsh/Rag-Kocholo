        "text": "Metta World Peace is a phenomenon. A remarkable force that inexplicably occurred in nature. It would be easier to guard him on the hardwood than to define the enigmatic star. For 17 NBA seasons, the bruising forward was never coy, always candid, and relentlessly true to himself.\n\nNow the former All-Star is contributing to the game in a different way. His holdings company, Artest Management Group, is starting a business aimed at connecting athletes and sports enthusiasts. Monday afternoon, the former Laker sat down and shared stories from his playing days and discussed his vision for his new business.\n\nFirst Question, Queensbridge. What does that neighborhood mean to you?\n\nIt means a lot because it’s somewhere that made a lot of legends. It hits you later, and you’re like, “Oh wow, I really am from there.”\n\nWho is the best basketball player to come out of New York City?\n\nJoe Hammond.\n\nBill Walton was featured prominently in your documentary, Quiet Storm: The Ron Artest Story. What is your relationship like with his son Luke?\n\nMe and Luke played together in the finals. I had a good relationship with him. I was really surprised to see his dad on the doc. I didn’t know his dad did that many interviews, but it was great.\n\nYou were a unique player - strength, size, skill. Is there a current NBA player that reminds you of yourself?\n\nEverybody is so different. So, I would say Kawhi Leonard.\n\nYou wore the following numbers in the league: 15, 23, 91, 93, 96, 37, 51. Which number was the best version of you as a player?\n\n91 with the Indiana Pacers. I wasn’t in my prime yet, but I was really good.\n\nIf Yao Ming and Tracy McGrady stay healthy during the 2009 Western Conference Semifinals, do the Rockets beat the Lakers?\n\nWe would have had a better shot (laughs). If we had T-Mac and Yao, we would have had a better shot at winning the finals.\n\nOn a more somber note, I know you and Kobe were like family. How are you holding up after such a devastating loss of a good friend?\n\nIt still feels like he’s alive. I still feel his energy. Everybody deals with it differently. But it still feels like he’s here, which is a good feeling.\n\nYou were Kobe’s teammate for five seasons. In what ways did he rub off on you?\n\nKobe rubbed off on me with my coaching. He taught me a lot of moves that I didn’t know. Now I’m able to teach those.\n\nIf you don't make the put-back against the Suns in Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals and the dagger against the Celtics in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, do the Lakers still win the 2010 NBA Finals?\n\nI think we still win, but I think without that put-back we go back to Phoenix down. That’s not good.\n\nRecently you tweeted that Andrew Bynum was one of the Lakers best centers of all time. He’s been quiet since retirement. When was the last time you heard from him?\n\nI haven’t heard from Andrew in a long time. But the work that he put in made him a dominant center. If you measure it to where all other centers were when they were 23 years old or 22, I think he was 22 or something like that when I played with him. But he was a dominant center.\n\nSo, he grew frustrated by not having the option – he wanted to be a number one option or a number two option. But he was very good. But I always want to show my respects because he was a Hall of Famer, definitely.\n\nYou are missing from a few NBA 2K classic teams. Are we going to see your avatar on that game anytime soon?\n\nRight now, I’m into building a digital marketing solutions and third-party solutions; eventually, I get to our own products. But I’ve been so focused on marketing, and google analytics, Facebook business, Facebook ads, and all this other stuff.\n\nWhereas, when I’m on the game, it reminds me of being an influencer. I’m not trying to be an influencer. Sometimes my Instagram live will have like 20 people on it, and I do that on purpose. I do that to stay out the way. Sometimes I need a break. I don’t need every day people being like, “Oh I just saw you on the game, oh that was a great game, or oh you were a great player.”\n\nI don’t need that every day. And that game is such a big game, I want a couple more years or rest without someone hitting me with “Oh I just played with you in the game.”\n\nSo, we shouldn’t expect it in the near future?\n\nMaybe in like five years or something.\n\nYou played under the best coach of all time, the Zen Master, Phil Jackson. What was something he taught you that you can apply to life?\n\nOh Zen, the whole meditation, mindfulness, it’s so big to have someone like that in your corner in your team’s corner and teaching you different things about control and being centered, so it was amazing.\n\nYou were the first professional athlete I can ever remember speaking candidly about mental health. There has been a lot of progress since that time. Do you think you helped get the ball rolling on that issue all those years ago?\n\nI think Dennis Rodman started it when he was on Oprah. He was so outspoken. He inspired me to be yourself. Find yourself. Be yourself.\n\nSo, now you have a new business. It’s called XvsX Sports. It’s like a LinkedIn for basketball, and a great tool for organizing basketball games at a court near you. Could you tell me more?\n\nIt’s for people who want to play sports and find each other. You can build a profile and post your games on your feed. Your wins and losses will pop up on your profile.\n\nAlso, you can connect and engage with other sports enthusiasts involved in other sports operations. So, it’s connecting the everyday player with sports enthusiasts who have the same interests.\n\nWhy did you build XvsX Sports?\n\nThere is not a lot of opportunity for athletes to get involved at an understandable level, meaning you want to get into e-sports, or sports nutrition, or sports fashion - how do you go about that? What platforms can you use that’s not so difficult? What type of people can you work with that’s not going to try to overcharge you, that’s more into the collaboration? Our platform is meant to help athletes – pro and recreational - connect with others.\n\nIf you had an iPhone and XvsX Sports growing up, how would it have changed your experience?\n\nIt would have changed a lot. I would have been posting a lot on social media. I would have been doing everything they are doing now. I think it’s a really great time. Although technology is isolating, at the same time it can be fun. You can still engage with others offline just by building communities or meeting up with your friends and having a good time. I think online is great also.\n\nHow can this app help basketball players?\n\nIn basketball it’s hard to get exposure. And it’s hard for teams to find players. With our platform you can follow a player from his or her infancy to when they blossom. You can also find a coach that you want to play for, or sports owners, leagues, and teams. That can help you get to the level you want to get to. We also have the option for people who just want to play recreational ball.\n\nHow do you envision XvsX Sports changing the basketball world?\n\nI don’t think it’s going to change the basketball world, I think it will add to the basketball world. XvsX will compliment, not change it. Things are great for sports, but we do want to become a pipeline and give more access to people who wouldn’t have necessarily receive the access and exposure to get involved – not just playing but the operations and business side of sports and all the enthusiasm that comes with sports.\n\nLast question, Metta World Peace - Family man, basketball player, mental health advocate, entrepreneur, coach, author, documentarian - what do you want your legacy to be?\n\nReally, nothing. I’m like an all or nothing guy, I’m either going to be the best or I’m not going to be anything. At this point it’s nothing. I literally don’t care."
