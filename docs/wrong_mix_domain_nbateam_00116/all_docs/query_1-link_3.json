        "text": "Metta World Peace had a number of infamous moments over the course of his 18-year NBA career, but there’s one in particular that likely sticks out for Boston Celtics fans.\n\nBack in 2005, when MWP was known as Ron Artest and played for the Indiana Pacers, he took his stingy defense to the next level by pulling down Paul Pierce’s shorts. The pantsing didn’t seem to bother The Truth much, as he nailed a 3-pointer right over Artest despite his trunks being below his waist.\n\nDuring a Monday morning appearance on FOX Sports 1’s “Undisputed,” Metta World Peace explained the logic behind trying to de-pants Pierce. While the former forward is known for being pretty out there, his explanation wasn’t too outlandish.\n\n“When I pulled Paul Pierce’s shorts down, I was like, ‘Ok, what can I do to not get ejected, but to bother Paul because he’s killing me right now,” he said. “I figured that was the best thing I could do, no tech, and he still hit the three. Oh my goodness. With his shorts down, unbelievable.”\n\nWe’d love to know where Pierce’s head was at while Artest incorporated his unorthodox defensive tactics."
