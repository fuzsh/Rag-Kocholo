        "text": "The Lakers’ fan favorite appears assured of staying on the roster at least through training camp. But for a player that has won an NBA championship, collected defensive accolades and rehabilitated his image, Metta World Peace has higher aspirations.\n\nHe does not just hope to stay on the Lakers’ roster on a non-guaranteed contract for a second consecutive season. The 36-year-old World Peace enters his 17th NBA season and 18th playing professionally overall hoping he can log at least three more years on the hardwood.\n\n“I want to finish off strong,” World Peace said. “It’s not about what it will mean to me. It’s about, ‘Can I get there?’ ”\n\nFirst things first. World Peace must first prove he can survive several rounds of roster cuts before the NBA regular season starts later this month.\n\n“We didn’t expect him to make the team last year and he made it,” Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak said. “The same thing can happen this year.”\n\nLast year, the Lakers became concerned with World Peace’s durability after he spent one season playing overseas in Italy and China. As World Peace said, “I just had to show I was in pretty good shape.”\n\nThen the Lakers found value that World Peace could provide in a mentorship role.\n\nThis year, the Lakers acquired several other veterans, including Luol Deng and Jose Calderon. But with Deng sidelined in Friday’s exhibition against Denver at Staples Center with a bruised left knee, Lakers coach Luke Walton started World Peace at small forward instead of rookie forward Brandon Ingram.\n\nWalton said he “absolutely” considered starting Ingram before choosing otherwise to ensure the same bench rotation.\n\nDespite sitting World Peace in select portions of practice and in the Lakers’ preseason opener, Walton gushed about World Peace’s conditioning and veteran presence.\n\n“Metta is very professional,” Walton said. “There’s a lot of help having him around and having him at camp.”\n\nWill the Lakers think the same thing for the regular season?\n\n“My concern is having a good time. There’s nothing to overcome,” World Peace said. “I’m a hell of a basketball player. That’s the hard part, becoming a good basketball player. Once you do that, you don’t have to worry about nothing else.”\n\nStill, World Peace could not resist smiling during the team’s first film session. Then, the reality hit him that World Peace would play for Walton, who is nearly eight months younger than his former teammate.\n\n“I zoned out and was smiling. We literally sat next to each other in the film sessions,” World Peace said. “It felt good to see him up there coaching the Lakers.”\n\nIt will also feel good for World Peace to continue to play for the Lakers this season and beyond. But first things first.\n\n“If he goes to the 28 days of camp and we decide not to keep him, he understands,” Kupchak said. “Those 28 days are going to pay huge dividends for this organization.”\n\nBounce back\n\nThe Lakers’ loss to Denver featured a controversial finish. Lakers forward Thomas Robinson appeared to make a 3-pointer at the buzzer and drew contact as time expired. Had Robinson made the foul shot, the game would have gone into overtime. But officials determined Robinson did not release the shot before the clock expired. They also did not call a foul.\n\nLakers second-year point guard D’Angelo Russell provided a team-leading 21 points while shooting 7-of-14 from the field and 4-of-8 from 3-point range in 24 minutes. Russell also added five assists and four rebounds, though he also committed four turnovers. Russell also held Nuggets guard Emmanuel Mudiay to four points on 2-of-10 shooting.\n\nLakers guard Jordan Clarkson added 15 points, while Larry Nance Jr. had 11 points. Nuggets guard Will Barton led the team with 20 points, while center Jusuf Nurkic added 18.\n\nPopularity contest\n\nThe compliments have sounded as loud as the music Walton plays during practice. The Lakers endlessly have praised Walton’s laid-back personality, basketball intelligence and teaching style.\n\nYet, Walton sounded aware of an unavoidable reality.\n\n“There’s going to be plenty of times where players are not happy with me or happy with the staff,” Walton said. “I know it’s coming. As long as the foundation and relationships are there, you can get through there no problem.”\n\nStill, the Lakers believe Walton can build a sturdier foundation than former cocah Byron Scott, whose stern style received mixed feedback in the organization.\n\n“I can’t talk about B. Scott other than when I played for him. I really enjoyed playing for Coach Scott,” said Walton, who played for him during his final NBA season in Cleveland (2012-13). “I like the guys to enjoy themselves. I like to get active on defense, get out and run as often as possible and put a value on how much the ball is moving.”\n\nMeeting of the minds\n\nTheir presence will never fade with their retired jerseys and endless highlight reels. Lakers Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Gail Goodrich also provided something else, spending time with the Lakers during a film session and imparting wisdom in what Walton called an “intimate setting.”\n\n“I loved it,” Walton said. ”They both talked and the players asked questions. It was a good little 15-minute segment we had with some of the all-time greats.”\n\nAbdul-Jabbar and Goodrich provided more than just platitudes on the upcoming 2016-17 season. Abdul-Jabbar also demonstrated his skyhook and post-up moves.\n\n“That’s unbelievable to have Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, No. 1 scorer in NBA history, teaching you his signature move and his thoughts about the game,” Lakers backup center Tarik Black said. “You can’t buy that.”"
