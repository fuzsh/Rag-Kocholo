        "text": "The first usage of the concept of anti-system party in a comparative perspective can be traced back to a seminal book chapter by Giovanni Sartori published in 1966, and on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary it is time to ask whether the concept enjoys good health in terms of theoretical consistency and analytical power in addition to longevity. This article aims, firstly, to review the existing conceptualizations critically by emphasizing their theoretical shortcomings and the subsequent problems for empirical analysis. Secondly, it provides a minimal definition of a revisited concept of anti-system party by focusing on two constitutive dimensions: the ideological orientation of a party towards the status quo and its visible systemic interactions. Although my revisited conceptualization differs from classical approaches to anti-system parties (Capoccia Reference Capoccia2002; Sartori Reference Sartori1976, Reference Sartori1982) in several respects, it shares with the latter an emphasis on the importance of conceiving the positive term ‘system’ and its negation ‘anti-system’ as ‘neutral’ and ‘relative’ terms. This is a point worth emphasizing as in the scholarly debate the terms ‘anti-system’ and ‘anti-democratic’ are often considered to be synonyms, yet this represents a serious misconception, often bemoaned by Sartori himself throughout his writings (e.g. Sartori Reference Sartori1982: 300).\n\nWhereas terms such as ‘populist’, ‘extreme’ or ‘radical’ refer only to the ideological profile of political parties, my revisited concept of anti-system party is a multidimensional concept assessing not only the ideological features of an actor but also its functional role in the party system.1 Significantly, the relationship between two such crucial dimensions is only superficially explored in the classical Sartorian perspective and is subject to problematic assumptions in Giovanni Capoccia’s (Reference Capoccia2002) approach to anti-system parties. At the same time, a bi-dimensional perspective also characterizes the vast majority of the alternative ‘anti’ concepts introduced by scholars, such as anti-establishment (e.g. Abedi Reference Abedi2004), challenger (e.g. Hobolt and Tilley 2016), outsider (e.g. McDonnell and Newell Reference McDonnell and Newell2011) and protest parties (e.g. Smith Reference Smith1989). However, such competing concepts fail to clarify what an ‘anti’ party becomes if a variation occurs in only one of the concepts’ constitutive properties, and they appear to be inadequate from a terminological point of view (cf. Gerring Reference Gerring2012: ch. 5).\n\nThe article subsequently develops a typology with four categories for political parties – anti-system, pro-system, halfway house and complementary parties – and enabling their classification across space and time. It then illustrates the payoff of my revisited conceptualization in comparison with existing approaches by assessing their different classificatory power and analytical utility in the analysis of controversial cases from Greece, Hungary and Italy. Using my typology, it is possible to sharpen our analytical tools in the study of party systems, especially if we adopt a comparative perspective, and to shed light on party stability and change. Significantly, my revisited concept of anti-system party and the broader typology of political parties can be employed to tackle important research questions by following a new and rigorous perspective, and to open new research avenues, particularly in relation to two crucial phenomena of interest for party politics scholars: the overcrowding of Sartori’s systems of moderate pluralism (see Mair Reference Mair1997), and the increasing number of populist parties achieving integration in national political systems (cf. Mudde Reference Mudde2016b: 16)."
