        "text": "As the conflict in Syria entered its fourteenth year, the “tragic reality” was that developments are going in the wrong direction across all fronts, the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the country warned the Security Council today, as members echoed his urgent calls on Damascus and other actors to unblock the persisting political impasse.\n\n“I am alarmed at the trajectory of events, and the lack of progress in reversing them,” Geir O. Pedersen, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria, told the Council, pointing to a deterioration across the country’s security, humanitarian, human rights, economic and political spheres. Acute violence continued across many fronts, as did regional spillover, he said, outlining an uptick in violence across the country, including Israeli strikes, one of which reportedly killed a member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He called for an urgent de-escalation of the conflict in Gaza and an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, pointing to concerning regional ramifications. As well, he called for a de-escalation of the conflict in Syria, progressing towards a nationwide ceasefire.\n\nNoting the presence of six — not five, as used to be the case — foreign armies in the country, with millions of Syrians split across various lines of control, he reported a “loud and clear sense of dismay” over these trend lines in discussions with Syrian civil society actors, including his Deputy’s engagements in Istanbul through the Civil Society Support Room. On the political track, he outlined recent engagements with Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad, Syrian Negotiations Commission President Badr Jamous, and other actors, stressing: “My message was clear: the political track, blocked and dormant, needs to be unstuck.”\n\nAlso briefing was Joyce Msuya, Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, who painted an alarming picture of steep and mounting humanitarian needs, with more than 7 million people displaced and more than half of the population needing food assistance. “More people need humanitarian aid in Syria now than at any point in the crisis,” she observed, “and yet, funding for our humanitarian appeal has fallen to a record low.” The 2023 humanitarian appeal received less than 40 per cent of the required funding, she said, adding that the consequences were “devastating”. She therefore urged sustained and unhindered humanitarian access through all modalities, and the necessary funding to sustain life-saving aid and expand early recovery.\n\nIn the ensuing debate, Council members reiterated the Special Envoy’s calls for de-escalation and a renewal of the political process. Speakers were near unanimous in expressing alarm over the grave and worsening humanitarian situation, with many delegates underscoring the need for sustained and unrestricted humanitarian aid, while some blamed the deleterious effects of sanctions.\n\nAmong them was the delegate of the Russian Federation, who assailed “the suffocating pressure of sanctions from Western countries” on the humanitarian situation. He also expressed concern over the “extremely negative” impact of Israel’s actions in Gaza on the situation in Syria, and its air strikes on civilian targets in Syria, including along the Blue Line, adding: “Such irresponsible actions risk dragging Syria and a number of its neighbours into a full-fledged regional confrontation.”\n\nThe delegate of the United States asserted that sanctions imposed by his country would remain in place until Damascus made concrete, measurable progress towards a political solution. Recalling that, for the past six months, the residents of Sweida have been calling for a peaceful political transition in line with Council resolution 2254 (2015) and for accountability for those who opened fire against protestors, he called on Council members to support Syrians’ right to peaceful assembly.\n\nIn a similar vein, France’s delegate said: “Today, France and the European Union see no reason to lift sanctions or finance the rebuilding of a country that is, in large part, destroyed by its own Government and its allies.” However, he added that those decisions are reversible based on real progress in the political process and that the bloc would continue to support Syrians through humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe representative of Algeria, also speaking for Guyana, Mozambique and Sierra Leone, was among many delegates urging relevant parties to overcome the deadlock regarding the convening of the ninth meeting of the Constitutional Committee. “At this critical juncture for Syria, the Syrian-led and Syrian-owned process must continue towards a lasting resolution of the crisis,” he stressed.\n\nFor his part, the representative of Syria asserted that Western permanent Council members promoted “a false narrative on the terrorist war” in his country to cover up their acts of aggression, occupation and economic blockade. Such actions were aimed at destabilizing Syria, he said, calling for sanctions imposed on his country to be immediately lifted. Addressing concerns over humanitarian access, he stated that terrorist organizations are preventing the crossline delivery of humanitarian assistance and are confiscating cross-border aid, underlining the need to “grant UN agencies in Damascus full power to discharge their mandate across Syria in complete coordination with the Government”.\n\nSpeakers from countries in the region also took the floor, with Iran’s representative calling for the immediate withdrawal of all uninvited foreign forces from Syria. Assailing certain countries who have violated Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and supported terrorist groups since the start of the conflict, he stressed that “there is no military solution to the Syrian crisis”. Meanwhile, Türkiye’s delegate warned against subcontracting the fight against Da’esh to the “so-called Syrian Democratic Forces”, who were neither Syrian, nor democratic. He also called for a change of attitude on the Syrian-led political process to enable it to be revived, emphasizing the need for all actors to support the reconvening of the Constitutional Committee, the only platform where Syrian parties can produce a negotiated solution to the conflict and shape the country’s future.\n\nBriefings\n\nGEIR O. PEDERSEN, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria, said that, after 13 years of conflict in Syria, the tragic reality is that developments are going in the wrong direction, including in the security, humanitarian, human rights, economic and political spheres, adding: “I am alarmed at the trajectory of events, and the lack of progress in reversing them.” On security, the conflict continues with acute violence on many fronts and continued regional spillover, he said, outlining a slew of concerning events taking place in the past month, including further Israeli strikes, including one that Iran says killed a member of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps; further rocket fire from southern Syria into the occupied Syrian Golan; an uptick in violence in Idlib, where pro-Government air strikes and now drone strikes resumed after a relative hiatus; further Turkish drone strikes in north-east Syria; and new attacks by Da’esh which killed civilians, including, once again, large numbers of civilians searching for truffles in the desert.\n\nMoreover, he voiced concern over the conflict in Gaza and its regional ramifications, calling for de-escalation and an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. As well, he called for an urgent de-escalation of the conflict in Syria, progressing towards a nationwide ceasefire. On the humanitarian front, a “staggering” 16.7 million people need humanitarian assistance — the highest number at any point in 13 years — he said, emphasizing the need for aid to reach them through all modalities. He also voiced concern over massive challenges to basic State services across the country, stressing that its long-term impacts for State functioning, and on reaching a political solution, were concerning. As well, he voiced concern over the estimated 100,000 people who are arbitrarily detained, forcibly disappeared, or missing, calling for their releases at scale, and for information about their fate.\n\nMore than half Syria’s pre-war population continues to languish in displacement or exile, for over a decade in many cases, he went on, noting that they are not returning due to unaddressed concerns related to protection and livelihood. Meanwhile, women’s activists report increased harassment and threats of physical violence, he said, pointing to the recent murder of a local council member in north-west Syria, and calling for their protection. As well, he outlined other concerning signs, including protestors taking to the streets in various parts of the country, and the presence and activities of six — not five, as used to be the case — foreign armies in the country, including a multitude of armed actors. “Millions of Syrians are split across these lines of control,” he said, noting a “loud and clear sense of dismay” over these trend lines in discussions with Syrian civil society actors, including his Deputy’s engagements in Istanbul through the Civil Society Support Room.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, he noted engagements with Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad, as well as with Syrian Negotiations Commission President Badr Jamous, and with Russian, Iranian, Turkish, Chinese, Arab, American and European counterparts, adding: “My message was clear: the political track, blocked and dormant, needs to be unstuck.” On the Constitutional Committee, recalling that the Syrian Government did not accept an invitation to reconvene in Geneva in April, he urged it to start engaging in a deepened and concrete dialogue. “But a way out of the crisis also needs the contributions of international actors who play an outsized role in Syria today,” he said, adding: “And it needs compromises from all Syrian and international players.” He therefore called for preparatory talks on a comprehensive compromise across interlinked tracks, with a view to ending the suffering of the Syrian people and realize Council resolution 2254 (2015).\n\nJOYCE MSUYA, Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that Ramadan in 2024 marks 13 years of conflict in Syria, as humanitarian needs mount, more than 7 million people remain displaced and more than half of the population requires food assistance. Acute malnutrition among children under five has surged threefold in the past five years and, as a result, more than 500,000 children will need life-saving treatment for acute malnutrition in 2024. “More people need humanitarian aid in Syria now than at any point in the crisis,” she emphasized, adding: “And yet, funding for our humanitarian appeal has fallen to a record low.” Further, women and girls continue to grapple with the worst impacts of the humanitarian crisis, and she recalled that her colleagues in Syria recently met with several women who were marking the start of Ramadan in Aleppo.\n\nShe reported that one — a mother of five who now also cares for five orphaned grandchildren — said that it has been almost a year since her family had meat or cheese. Another said that she is often forced to make painful choices, such as between food and medicine for her children. And, in Idlib, a mother of 12 said that she has been living in a tent since being displaced from her home five years ago, spending her days with her children at a landfill looking for materials to sell to buy food. “Despite these enormous needs, the humanitarian community’s ability to provide assistance is severely limited,” she stressed, and the 2023 humanitarian appeal received less than 40 per cent of the funding required. Underscoring that “the consequences are devastating”, she reported that the World Food Programme (WFP) can only reach a third of the most severely food insecure.\n\nShe also stated that outpatient therapeutic feeding programmes for malnourished children have been forced to close, about half of the total nutrition rapid-response teams have suspended operations and food prices and the cost of living continue to climb to record highs. Vital health services are also being reduced and the prices of medicine have surged 200 per cent in two years and, in the north-west, 49 health facilities partially or fully suspended their operations at the end of 2023. In the north-east, referral services provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) for people who need more advanced health support will be suspended at the end of March. Such services supported 8,000 to 10,000 patients per year — 70 per cent of them women.\n\n“We are doing what we can to bridge the gap,” she stressed. However, while the UN allocated $20 million to Syria through the Central Emergency Response Fund in February, far more is needed to meet such massive need and avert even more painful cuts in vital support. Underscoring that the scarcity of resources reinforces the importance of delivering aid through all available routes, she said: “For the 4.2 million people in need in north-west Syria, the cross-border response from Türkiye continues to play an indispensable role.” At the same time, the expansion of cross-line deliveries throughout Syria remains a top priority. Concluding, she called for respect for international law, sustained and unhindered humanitarian access through all modalities and the necessary funding to sustain life-saving aid and expand early recovery. “Our appeals are familiar,” she observed.\n\nStatements\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation voiced concern over the “extremely negative” impact of Israel’s actions in Gaza on the situation in Syria. The sharp rise in tension on the Syrian-Israeli border is amplified by active external interference coupled with the ongoing illegal foreign presence in the north and north-east of Syria. The intensification of air strikes by the Israeli Air Force on civilian targets in Syria, including along the Blue Line, is also worrisome. “Such irresponsible actions risk dragging Syria and a number of its neighbours into a full-fledged regional confrontation,” he warned. Israeli strikes negatively impact the timely humanitarian response of UN structures. The hypocrisy of the United States and its satellites is particularly glaring vis-à-vis humanitarian access in Syria, he observed, noting that “the suffocating pressure of sanctions from Western countries contributes to the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in (the country)”.\n\nThe representative of the United States noted this month’s “grim milestone”, which marked 13 months since Syrians’ calls for a Government that respected fundamental rights and freedoms was met with deadly force. Despite that, Syrians in the country and in the diaspora continued to raise their voices for change, refusing to be forced into submission. The residents of Sweida have, for six months, been calling for a peaceful political transition in line with Council resolution 2254 (2015) and for accountability for those who opened fire against anti-regime protestors, he said, calling on Council members to support Syrians’ right to peaceful assembly. On the political track, he called on the Syrian regime to engage in the political process in good faith, pointing to the “human cost of inaction”. Underlining the vital importance of the work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in Syria, he welcomed the UN’s investigation of their actions in Gaza, as well as an independent review of neutrality practices. On sanctions imposed by his country, he noted that they would remain in place until the Syrian Government made concrete, measurable progress towards a political solution.\n\nThe representative of Switzerland called on the parties — and those with influence over them — to work towards a ceasefire, respect their international-law obligations and commit to preventing even-more-serious regional escalation. For its part, the Council must play an important role in the fight against impunity — necessary for lasting peace — and, to this end, he expressed support for the Human Rights Council’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria and the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism for Syria. Also stressing that dialogue must be conducted at all levels, he said Switzerland will continue to make Geneva available to host all efforts aimed at promoting lasting peace in Syria. Turning to the humanitarian situation — for which Switzerland is the penholder — he stressed that all aid modalities “remain necessary to meet humanitarian needs”. Further, all parties are obliged by international law to facilitate the passage of aid to and through areas under their control.\n\nThe representative of Algeria, also speaking for Guyana, Mozambique and Sierra Leone, urged the relevant parties to overcome the deadlock regarding the convening of the ninth meeting of the Constitutional Committee. “At this critical juncture for Syria, the Syrian-led and Syrian-owned process must continue towards a lasting resolution of the crisis,” he stressed. To reach a credible political solution, restore Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and facilitate the safe and dignified return of refugees, the involvement of Syrian women and youth is essential. Rejecting all external interferences, he voiced concern over the repeated attacks on the Golan Heights. Such actions only perpetuate insecurity and will potentially fuel terrorist activities in the region, he observed, calling for coordinated action to combat terrorism in Syria.\n\nTurning to the dire humanitarian situation in the country, he said that more than 90 per cent of Syrians now live in poverty. Accordingly, he called for sufficient and predictable funding for the Syria Humanitarian Response Plan, noting that its underfunding has forced humanitarian agencies to reduce food assistance and suspend health services. However, Syria should not continue to rely solely on humanitarian funding, he said, emphasizing the importance of investment to reduce external assistance dependency and revive Syria’s economic growth. He also stressed that sanctions on Syria must be lifted.\n\nThe representative of Ecuador stated that 13 years into the conflict in Syria, sustainable peace is a “distant horizon”, despite the efforts of the international community and regional actors. He echoed the call of the Special Envoy on all actors to lay down their arms and for all international humanitarian law obligations to be upheld. The only possible path to peace entails reactivating political dialogue, he said, calling for political will to be restored so the Constitutional Committee can reconvene, stressing: “The political process needs to be unblocked.” Voicing concern over the “fragile” security situation, he called for a common approach to address terrorist groups and to dismantle threats looming over the country and the region. As well, the Council must address the plight of the 16.7 million Syrians needing humanitarian assistance, the 13 million in need of food assistance, the 6.8 million internally displaced persons and the 5 million more Syrians who have sought refuge in third countries, almost half of whom are women and girls.\n\nThe representative of France pointed out that, since March 2011, the Damascus regime “has not paid the least attention to the demands of its people” — on the contrary, it has responded with repression and remains unwilling to compromise. “Today, France and the European Union see no reason to lift sanctions or finance the rebuilding of a country that is, in large part, destroyed by its own Government and its allies,” he said. But those decisions are reversible based on real progress in the political process and, meanwhile, France and the bloc will continue to support Syrians through humanitarian assistance. He stressed, however, that those present must observe that such assistance is “almost exclusively financed” by Europe, the United States, Canada and Japan. Adding that France is multiplying its efforts to prevent regional escalation, he expressed concern over the resurgence of Da’esh and the rapid increase in Captagon trafficking, both of which “feed instability and the complicity of the Damascus regime”.\n\nThe representative of Malta underscored the need to agree on a date and venue for a resumed Constitutional Committee. The continued air strikes and artillery shelling each month result in the killing, injury and maiming of dozens, she observed, noting that “such reports represent only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to grasping the suffering of the civilian population”. Voicing grave concern over the humanitarian funding gap vis-à-vis the UN’s response to support the 16 million Syrians in need, she said that, without providing bsuch groups support and protection, there will be a reduction in medical, protection and education services. While welcoming the continued authorization of the border crossing points, Bab Al Hawa, Bab Al Salam and Al-Rai, she reiterated the need to facilitate aid via all modalities in Syria, including that of crossline.\n\nThe representative of the United Kingdom recalled that it has been 13 years since the Assad regime launched a ruthless campaign of violence that continues to this day. As a result, over 500,000 people have died and over half of the Syrian population have been forcibly displaced. Underscoring the importance of resolution 2254 (2015), he said that the regime failed to take the steps the Council called for. He stressed that the international community must increase its humanitarian support and contribute to early recovery, noting that London has contributed over $4 billion since 2011. In a time of constrained resources, all parties must enable principled, sustainable and unhindered access, including cross-border access to vulnerable communities in the north-west. He further warned that the Assad regime continues to profit from the illicit trade of Captagon, fuelling its oppression of the Syrian people, noting his Government’s commitment to seek coordinated global action on the scourge.\n\nThe representative of Slovenia noted that the conflict in Syria has entered its fourteenth year, as the country experiences spillover effects from the region, and generates spillover effects of its own. Syria remains in turmoil, with a whole generation of young Syrians having only known their country in conflict. He underscored the urgent need for a Syrian-led, Syrian-owned political process to resume and for disagreements over the venue of the next meeting of the Constitutional Committee to end. On the humanitarian front, he underlined the need to ensure predictable aid flows across the country, and for all modalities of delivery to be utilized. Strikes on water and electricity facilities in north-east Syria exacerbate the humanitarian situation and must cease immediately. As well, he stressed the need for accountability on the issue of detainees, abductees and missing persons. “It is time to act,” he stressed, calling for an immediate ceasefire and full respect for international humanitarian law.\n\nThe representative of China, against the backdrop of the ongoing conflict in Gaza, called on all parties to exercise restraint and avoid exacerbating tensions. Further, major countries outside the region should play a constructive role in de-escalating the situation, and the international community must redouble collective efforts to manage the conflict in Gaza. “Support from regional countries can give new impetus to the political settlement of the Syrian issue,” he continued, calling on the international community to uphold the principle that such a solution must be owned and led by Syrians. Stressing that terrorism is a persistent threat to the political process, he welcomed the Government’s efforts to maintain stability and called on the international community to “fight all terrorism in Syria with zero tolerance”. Additionally, the parties concerned must actively cooperate to facilitate crossline deliveries, the international community should provide adequate, non-earmarked early-recovery support and foreign forces should immediately end their illegal military presence in Syria.\n\nThe representative of the Republic of Korea said that — as armed conflict continues throughout the country — the number of Syrians in need has amounted to 16.7 million. Accordingly, consistent and predictable humanitarian assistance to Syria through all available border crossings is critical. In this troubling situation, it is crucial “to prevent the Syrian issue from being put on the back burner in terms of emergency and readiness”, particularly facing the constant threat of spillover from Gaza. Stressing the need to ensure a ceasefire and the Syrian-led, Syrian-owned political process, in line with resolution 2254 (2015), he called on the relevant parties to agree on the venue of the Syrian Constitutional Committee and to engage in a genuine discussion on a political solution. “As the situation is stalled, it is the Syrian people that continue to suffer the most,” he asserted.\n\nThe representative of Japan, Council President for March, speaking in his national capacity, noting that the Syrian conflict entered its fourteenth year this month, reiterated that, with active hostilities and a devastating humanitarian situation, the only sustainable solution is an inclusive Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process under UN auspices in line with Council resolution 2254 (2015). Japan calls on all Syrian parties, in particular Damascus, to engage more seriously towards achieving tangible results through the political process. The Constitutional Committee must be resumed at an agreed venue as soon as possible, he added. On the humanitarian front, given immense needs, he underlined the need for assistance to be conducted through all modalities, cross-border and crossline, and for early recovery projects to be carried out. On that, he spotlighted new partnerships by his country with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to improve livelihoods, and with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to enhance education and protection services for earthquake-affected Syrians.\n\nThe representative of Syria said that, in March each year, Western permanent Council members promote a “false narrative on the terrorist war that Syria is witnessing”. These statements are made to cover up such States’ acts of aggression, occupation and economic blockade, which aim to destabilize his country, undermine development achievements, prejudice national choices and weaken its regional role to serve the Israeli occupation. Western bias and support has emboldened the occupying authorities to pursue repeated aggression against Syria and, in this context, he reaffirmed the content of the letters his country has sent to the Secretary-General and the Council asking them to “immediately intervene to end the hysterical Israeli aggression”. Further, he warned the Israeli occupying authorities against “the consequences of their criminal actions, which jeopardize regional and international peace and security”.\n\n“Contrary to the claims of some Western States”, he went on to say, “the Syrian Government has adopted an array of measures aimed at promoting stability and security and meeting the needs of Syrians throughout the country”. However, such States prefer to ignore these steps. For its part, the Government is committed to pursue constructive cooperation with the UN and remains hopeful that the Organization will address the concerns repeatedly raised by Damascus. On that, he said that terrorist organizations are preventing the crossline delivery of humanitarian assistance and are confiscating cross-border aid, underlining the need to “grant UN agencies in Damascus full power to discharge their mandate across Syria in complete coordination with the Government”. He also called for the immediate, unconditional lifting of unilateral coercive measures and reiterated his Government’s rejection of linking humanitarian funding to political conditions.\n\nThe representative of Iran observed that since the start of the conflict in 2011, certain countries have pursued their political agenda in Syria through military solutions. To this end, they disregarded basic principles of the Charter of the United Nations, violated Syrian sovereignty and territorial integrity, and supported terrorist and separatist groups. The same countries are now resorting to sanctions to achieve objectives they failed to attain through military or diplomatic channels. However, “there is no military solution to the Syrian crisis,” he stressed, noting that the politicization of humanitarian aid, obstruction of the return of refugees and displaced persons and imposition of unilateral sanctions only worsen the suffering of the Syrian population. Accordingly, he called for the immediate withdrawal of all uninvited foreign forces from Syria. Furthermore, the restoration of Syria’s territorial integrity demands relentless efforts to combat all terrorist groups.\n\nHe strongly condemned the ongoing Israeli military attacks in Syria as both unlawful and provocative, serving only to escalate tensions. While providing immediate aid is crucial, it is not a sustainable solution in the long term. Instead, efforts must focus on rebuilding critical infrastructure, creating conditions for the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons and advancing the political process. In this context, he called for the immediate lifting of unilateral sanctions, stressing that the continuous use of such inhuman measures violates the fundamental human rights of the Syrian people. In addition, the alleged humanitarian exemptions within sanctions frameworks often prove ineffective, given these sanctions’ complex and extensive nature. He also supported the resumption of the meetings of the Constitutional Committee as an effective mechanism for advancing the political process."
