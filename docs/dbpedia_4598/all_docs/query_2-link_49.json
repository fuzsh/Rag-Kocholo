        "text": "Forward cares more about solving problems than being right. Good ideas come from the left, right, and center—or from completely new directions. Data, research, and a commitment to development should drive our discussions, and policy should be enacted with measurable outcomes.\n\nAt the Forward Party, we believe that personal responsibility includes duties to care for our families however we define them, uplift our communities, and contribute to the greater good. It is through balancing our liberty with our duty to others in which the true American spirit thrives.\n\nForward believes in approaching one another with respect for the dignity that lives in each of us. Our policies and campaigns will seek to elevate and empower people to seek their unique version of the American Dream.\n\nForward leaders, members, and candidates are expected to act ethically and with integrity. That said, we are all fallible and make mistakes. At Forward, we are expected to admit them and work to rectify any harm we have caused.\n\nOur current election system creates the partisan division we see today by design. When voters can only pick one or the other, the “other” becomes the enemy. Voters are forced to pick between two bad choices because they’re told that if the other team wins, it’s the end of democracy as we know it. Convincing someone to never vote for your opponent is as effective as getting them to vote for you. Then, when a third option tries to come along and give voters a better choice, they’re a spoiler who will pull votes from the “good” candidate. All of this is caused by our “first past the post” voting system.\n\nOur current primary system has a number of drawbacks. Partisan gerrymandering has resulted in the vast majority of districts being “safe,” meaning the winner of one party’s primary is the overwhelming favorite to win the general election because of the makeup of the electorate in that district. And since only a small percentage of party voters show up for primaries in those districts, those primary voters get to decide who wins in November. These voters are often the most partisan, meaning the candidate that wins the general election is the one that most appeals to the partisan members of their party.\n\nOver 80% of Congressional districts are considered ‘safe’ seats—they are either clearly Republican or clearly Democratic. This reality is why Congress has a reelection rate of over 90% even though its approval rating is in the teens. This mismatch has been purposely engineered through gerrymandering—politicians picking their voters by drawing maps that have a very large share of their party’s voters, instead of voters picking their politicians. When the politicians can choose who gets to vote for them, they can ensure that they will continue to win, even if they’re unpopular. Voters should get to choose who represents them, not the other way around."
