        "text": "Formerly a British colony, the Maldives became an independent nation in 1965. The country’s constitution has been amended a total of six times—the most recent of these, in 2008, was an attempt to improve democratic norms, the rule of law, and judicial independence. That same year the country saw its first freely elected president, Mohamed Nasheed. After 2013, Maldives experiences a period of increasing authoritarianism, including the withdrawal from the Commonwealth over foreign criticism of the status of the country’s democratic institutions, individual freedoms, and the rule of law. In 2018, the political crisis worsened over President Abdulla Yameen’s refusal to comply with a judicial ruling ordering the release of political dissidents from prison; many had also disappeared or been killed. That same year, opposition parties united in a successful effort to oust Yameen from power. The new government has made strides in improving democratic norms and strengthening the rule of law. In 2020, it rejoined the Commonwealth after evidence of successful reforms.\n\nCorruption is frequently a major issue in the Maldives, as numerous leaders have been implicated in various money laundering and bribery scandals in recent years, including a former president. Issues of religious identity have also divided Maldivian society, as the Parliament has taken steps to solidify Islam’s status as the state religion. Gender Equality has significantly improved in recent years due to progress achieved through laws and measures promoting gender equality such as the National Gender Equality Action Plan, which aims at reaching the Sustainable Development Goal of Gender Equality, or an amendment to also extend the Sexual Offences Act to married couples. Nonetheless, long-standing provisions remain discriminatory against women, also regarding their political representation and gender-based violence is widespread. Another concern is rising religious fundamentalism as well as discrimination and arrests targeting LGBTQIA+ individuals.\n\nIt will be important to watch whether recent improvements continue, especially as significant human rights concerns persist. Recent incidents of prisoner torture and life-threatening conditions in Maldivian custody are of concern. Additionally, plans to reinstate the death penalty and failures to enacts critical reforms for Freedom of Expressions remain worrying. The country has also seen progress in several key areas, especially with regards to countering violent extremism and labor rights. Furthermore, attention should be paid to the country’s measures and initiatives to increase climate resilience as it is one of the most heavily impacted by the effects of climate change, particularly rising sea levels, beach erosion, severe weather events."
