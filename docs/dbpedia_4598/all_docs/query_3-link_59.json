        "text": "Four non-State armed groups and the Syrian Government Forces, including the National Defence Forces and pro-government militias are all listed in the annexes of the SG’s latest annual report on CAAC for various grave violations against children. According to the report, Syria remained among the situations with the highest numbers of verified grave violations against children in 2023, with 1,574 grave violations. Recruitment and use was the most recurring violation, with 1,073 children verified as having been recruited and used. Other grave violations included 475 children killed and maimed, sexual violence against one girl, the abduction of four girls, 20 attacks on schools and hospitals, and one incident of the denial of humanitarian access. At the end of 2023, over 800 children remained detained for alleged association with armed groups and approximately 29,000 children with suspected family ties to Da’esh continue to be deprived of liberty in north-eastern Syria. In June, the opposition Syrian National Army, including Ahrar al-Sham and Army of Islam, and their aligned legions and factions, signed an action plan with the UN to end and prevent the recruitment and use and the killing and maiming of children. The Security Council should:\n\nDemand that all parties uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law (IHL) and human rights law (IHRL), taking concrete measures to prevent child casualties, and call for all perpetrators of grave violations to be held accountable;\n\nUrge all listed parties, including Syrian Government Forces to develop, sign, and implement action plans to end and prevent violations against children, and call on the Syrian Democratic Forces and the opposition Syrian National Army, including Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam, to promptly and fully implement their respective action plans;\n\nRecall that all children formerly associated with armed forces and armed groups should be treated primarily as victims, including those allegedly associated with armed groups designated as terrorist by the UN and those who may have committed crimes; their reintegration should be prioritized, and detention should only be used as a last resort and for the shortest appropriate time; call on all parties to facilitate meaningful and regular access to children deprived of libertyfor UN and other independent monitors;\n\nUrge Member States to facilitate the return of their nationals, including children of their nationals, held for their or their family members’ real or perceived association with ISIL, and undertake individual, rights-based needs assessments, consistent with the principle of non-refoulement; provide reintegration and recovery support in line with international law and standards, prioritizing the child’s best interests; and prevent children from becoming stateless.\n\nSWITZERLAND IS THE SECURITY COUNCIL PENHOLDER ON HUMANITARIAN ISSUES IN SYRIA.\n\nThis information is based on Watchlist’s Children and Armed Conflict Monthly Update – August 2024.\n\nIn November, the Working Group received the SG’s fourth report on the situation of CAAC in Syria (S/2023/805), covering July 2020 to September 2022. The CTFMR verified 5,219 grave violations against children, representing a 10 percent increase in verified violations as compared to the previous reporting period. Recruitment and use was the most prevalent verified violation – which more than doubled compared to the previous report. The UN verified 910 children had been detained for their or their family members’ alleged association with armed forces or armed groups, while around 31,000 children are among the 55,500 persons who continue to be deprived of liberty in Hawl and Raj camps in NE Syria. Child casualties (1,891 children) also increased by 30 percent compared to the previous report, and explosive ordnance was the primary cause, followed by ground-based shelling, and IEDs. Rape and other forms of sexual violence continued to be underreported. While attacks on schools and hospitals and denial of humanitarian access decreased, the military use of schools and hospitals increased. Abduction more than doubled – the vast majority of cases were attributed to Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham. The Working Group should:\n\nStrongly condemning the scale, severity, and recurrence of grave violations against children in Syria, demand that all parties uphold their obligations under IHL and IHRL, and call for immediate and concrete steps to hold all perpetrators accountable;\n\nCall on all parties to immediately end all recruitment and use of children, release all children from their ranks; urge all listed parties, including Syrian Government forces, to develop, sign, and implement action plans to end and prevent all grave violations against children, and call on the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to promptly and fully implement their action plan;\n\nRemind all parties that children associated with armed groups should be treated primarily as victims, including those children actually or allegedly associated with groups designated as terrorist and those children who may have committed crimes; their reintegration should be prioritized in line with international juvenile justice standards; and detention of children should only be used as a last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time;\n\nUrge Member States to facilitate the return of their nationals, including children of their nationals, held for their or their family members’ actual or alleged association with ISIL, following individual, rights-based needs assessments, provide reintegration support in line with international law and standards, prioritizing the child’s best interests, and prevent children from becoming stateless;\n\nCall on all parties to immediately cease attacks or threats against schools, medical facilities and transport, their personnel, and other civilian objects; and urge the Government of Syria to take concrete measures to mitigate and avoid the military use of schools and hospitals, and to ensure attacks on these institutions and their personnel are investigated and those responsible duly prosecuted."
