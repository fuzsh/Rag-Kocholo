        "text": "The president, who dominates the executive branch, is empowered to appoint and dismiss the prime minister and cabinet. In May 2021, President Bashar al-Assad won a fourth seven-year term, with the government reporting that he won 95.1 percent of the vote. Syrians living abroad largely refrained from voting. Balloting was conducted in government-controlled areas, but not in rebel- or Kurdish-held areas.\n\nThe election was affected by an uncompetitive slate of candidates. In early May 2021, the Supreme Constitutional Court allowed only three aspiring candidates, including Assad, to contest the election. Opposition candidates were also affected by a law requiring candidates to have lived within Syria for 10 years, effectively disqualifying those in exile. Major democratic states denounced the election as illegitimate.\n\nIn June 2020, Assad dismissed Imad Khamis, who had served as prime minister since 2016, and appointed Hussein Arnous, then the water resources minister, to replace him.\n\nThere is no transparency or accountability surrounding the official electoral process. The executive authorities, acting through the military-security apparatus, effectively grant or withhold permission to participate in elections in government-held areas. Although some provisional local councils outside government-controlled areas have organized rudimentary elections since 2011, ongoing attacks by progovernment forces and militant groups have made such processes untenable.\n\nThe government and opposition groups have met with the intention of drafting a new constitution, though a UN special envoy reported that an October 2021 round of talks was unproductive.\n\nKurdish-held areas have a provisional constitution that allows local elections, but the Democratic Union Party (PYD) exercises ultimate control.\n\nThe largely Alawite-led regime presents itself as a protector of that and other religious minorities. In practice, political access depends not on sect but on proximity and loyalty to Assad and his associates. Alawites, Christians, Druze, and members of other smaller sects who are outside Assad’s inner circle are politically disenfranchised. The political elite includes members of the Sunni sect, but the country’s Sunni majority makes up most of the rebel movement and has borne the brunt of state repression as a result.\n\nThe opposition’s dwindling territory is divided among Turkish-backed rebels, Islamist militias, and radical jihadist militants, with varying implications for ethnic and religious minorities. The PYD nominally ensures political representation for Arabs but has been accused of mistreating non-Kurdish residents.\n\nWomen have equal formal political rights, holding 11.2 percent of the legislature’s seats after the 2020 elections as well as some senior government positions. However, they are typically excluded from political decision-making and have little ability to organize independently amid state and militia repression. All leadership positions in Kurdish-held areas are reportedly shared between a man and a woman, though they have limited autonomy outside PYD-led structures.\n\nThe regime and its allies are said to control much of the Syrian economy. The civil war has created new opportunities for corruption among the government, loyalist armed forces, and the private sector. Foreign allies have also benefited from government contracts and trade deals. Basic state services and humanitarian aid are reportedly extended or withheld based on recipients’ demonstrated political loyalty to the Assad regime. COVID-19-related movement restrictions created more opportunities for corruption, as those with means paid bribes to circumvent the rules.\n\nIndividuals in government-held territory who seek to expose or criticize official corruption face reprisals including dismissal from employment and detention.\n\nCorruption is also widespread in opposition-held areas. Turkish-backed militias have been accused of looting, extortion, and theft. Local administrators and activists complain that little of the international aid reportedly given to opposition representatives abroad seems to reach them, raising suspicions of graft.\n\nThe government has long operated with minimal transparency and public accountability, and conditions have worsened during the civil war amid the rise of militias that are nominally loyal to the regime but often free to exploit the population. Officials have broad discretion to withhold government information, and they are not obliged to disclose their assets. Independent civil society groups and media outlets are harshly suppressed and cannot influence or shed light on state policies.\n\nThe regime allegedly worked to suppress independent information about the COVID-19 pandemic in Syria when it emerged, in part by warning medical workers not to share their experiences or speak with foreign media outlets. Evidence of strains on the health-care system and an increase in burials suggested much larger numbers of cases and deaths than were reflected in official data.\n\nThe constitution nominally guarantees freedom of the press, but in practice the media are heavily restricted in government-held areas, and journalists who report critically about the state are subject to censorship, detention, torture, and death in custody. All media must obtain permission to operate from the Interior Ministry. Private media in government-controlled territory are generally owned by figures associated with the regime. Media freedom varies in territory held by other groups, but local outlets are typically under heavy pressure to support the dominant militant faction in the area. Journalists are vulnerable to censorship or intimidation over reporting on COVID-19.\n\nJournalists face physical danger throughout Syria, especially from regime forces and extremist groups. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), 139 journalists were killed between 2011 and 2021. Another 9 were missing as of December 2021.\n\nWhile the constitution mandates that the president be a Muslim, there is no state religion, and the regime has generally allowed different confessional groups to practice their faiths as long as their religious activities are not deemed politically subversive. The government monitors mosques and controls the appointment of Muslim religious leaders. Jehovah’s Witnesses are banned, proselytizing is restricted, and conversion of Muslims to other faiths is prohibited. The dominance of extremist groups in opposition-held areas of western Syria has threatened freedom of worship for local residents and displaced people.\n\nIS, which persecuted religious activity that did not conform to its version of Sunni Islam, was militarily defeated in Syria but reportedly remains active as a terrorist and guerrilla force, and it continues to recruit from and intimidate the roughly 62,000 IS suspects and family members held in Kurdish-controlled camps in eastern Syria.\n\nAn estimated 500,000 people have been killed in the civil war since 2011. While the fighting subsided following the defeat of IS in 2019 and the 2020 Idlib cease-fire, the regime and insurgent groups frequently target civilians, including through indiscriminate bombardment, extrajudicial killings, and torture of detainees, with the government responsible for most abuses. Regime forces have detained and tortured tens of thousands of people since the war began, and many have died in custody or disappeared.\n\nThe regime has been accused of repeatedly using chemical weapons on civilian targets, including during its 2019–20 offensives into Idlib Governorate. Those offensives had killed hundreds of people and displaced hundreds of thousands by the time a cease-fire was declared.\n\nDespite a nominal regime victory in Daraa Governorate in 2018, as well as a Russian-brokered reconciliation agreement, violence involving regime forces and local insurgents continued into 2021. The regime launched a siege against Daraa al-Balad, the old quarter of the city of Daraa, in June. Regime and rebel forces engaged in heavy fighting there beginning in July. In September, the government took control of Daraa al-Balad after agreeing to a deal negotiated with Russian assistance. Some 36,000 were internally displaced by the fighting as of September. A general deterioration of the rule of law has also reportedly contributed to violent criminality in the area.\n\nAlthough IS lost control of its last population center in 2019, the group has since resorted to guerrilla and terrorist tactics to attack security forces and local civilian leaders. Separately, Turkish military operations in northern Syria have displaced tens of thousands of people and posed a serious threat to civilians living in the affected area.\n\nInternally displaced persons (IDPs) are at risk of violence. In September 2021, Save the Children reported on incidents where children in the al-Hol and Roj camps were murdered or sexually assaulted.\n\nCapital punishment can be applied expansively. In October 2021, the regime executed 24 people it claimed were responsible for wildfires in 2020, accusing them of terrorism.\n\nFamilies and networks with ties to the ruling elite receive preferential treatment in legal matters, and are disproportionately Alawite, though Alawites without such connections are far less likely to benefit from any special advantages. Similarly, the armed opposition is overwhelmingly Sunni Arab, and members of this group are consequently likely to face discrimination by the state unless they enjoy close ties with the regime.\n\nThe Kurdish minority has faced decades of state discrimination, including restrictions on the Kurdish language and persecution of Kurdish activists, though conditions for Kurds have improved dramatically in areas controlled by Kurdish militias since 2011.\n\nWomen are subject to legal and societal inequities, including gender-based disadvantages in social benefits and a severe gender gap in labor force participation. Official mechanisms meant to safeguard women’s rights are reportedly not functional, and the general deterioration of law and order has left women exposed to a range of abuses, particularly at the hands of extremist groups that impose their own interpretations of religious law.\n\nSyrian law discriminates against LGBT+ people. According to the 1949 penal code, “unnatural sexual intercourse” is punishable with up to three years in prison. Individuals suspected of same-sex relations are at risk of execution in areas held by extremist groups.\n\nOngoing combat and the proliferation of regime and militia checkpoints have severely restricted freedom of movement. The regime imposed curfews and other constraints on travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, though enforcement was uneven due to bribery and other factors. Movement restrictions persisted during 2021. In April, the PYD imposed a lockdown within the territory under its control, in an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19 during Ramadan.\n\nThe Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees reported that 6.7 million IDPs were present in Syria in December 2021. Another 5.5 million Syrians have sought refuge abroad. Some Syrians have begun returning to their homes in areas where fighting has subsided, though the 2019 government offensive in Idlib and the 2021 clashes in Daraa displaced large numbers of residents.\n\nPerpetrators of “honor crimes” can receive reduced sentences under the penal code, and rapists can avoid punishment by marrying their victims. Women cannot pass citizenship on to their children. Personal status laws for Muslims put women at a disadvantage regarding marriage, divorce, and child custody. Church law governs personal status issues for Christians, in some cases barring divorce. Early and forced marriages are a problem, with displaced families in particular marrying off young daughters as a perceived safeguard against endemic sexual violence or due to economic pressure. Personal social freedoms for women are uneven in areas outside government control, ranging from onerous codes of dress and behavior in extremist-held areas to formal equality under the PYD in Kurdish areas. However, the defeat of IS, setbacks for other extremist groups, and a decline in the scale of fighting over time has reduced the population’s exposure to the most egregious violations of personal social freedoms."
