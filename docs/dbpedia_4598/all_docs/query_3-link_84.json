Internships and fellowships allow students the opportunity to explore federal careers and offer valuable work experience.\n\nWork as an Intern or a Fellow at USAID\n\nThe work assigned to an Intern or a Fellow varies in complexity by educational experience and may include:\n\nResearch\n\nWriting program memoranda\n\nDrafting documents\n\nFacilitating meetings and special events\n\nAttending program discussions in the Agency, at the Department of State, or on Capitol Hill\n\nCommunicating about program issues with USAID field Missions abroad, and with USAID’s many stakeholders and the general public\n\nParticipating in employee engagement and mentoring events\n\nKeep Me Informed\n\nYou can receive notifications for open USAID positions by setting up a saved search in USAJobs.\n\nFirst, sign up for a USAJobs account.

Internships offer students invaluable hands-on experience and exposure to careers in the public service and international development.\n\nInternships run for the fall, spring, and summer semesters. During the school year, interns are permitted to select from a 20-hour, 25-hour, and full-time work schedule; in the summer interns generally work full-time. These positions are temporary and do not convert into permanent positions. The new Career Internship Program offers the students the opportunity to work until they graduate from their educational programs. Students who successfully complete the program may be eligible for conversion to a permanent job in the Civil Service, though this is not a guarantee.\n\nAnnouncements are posted on USAJobs several months before the internship start date to give students the opportunity to obtain the required security clearances before starting.\n\nEligibility Requirements\n\nMust be a U.S. citizen, national or legal permanent resident.
