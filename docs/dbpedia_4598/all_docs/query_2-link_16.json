        "text": "‘[P]rogressive alliances are now essential, not just because that is the only way we can beat the Tories, but because that is the way we will make better decisions and take more of the country with us. Frankly, I want to be in government with Caroline Lucas, not against her – and certainly not in permanent opposition’.\n\nAs the fortunes of political parties wax and wane, new lines of political conflict arise, and with them new possibilities for co-operation. Challenged by a powerful new rival, long-standing adversaries may find reasons to co-ordinate, now aware of what they have in common. Faced with a newly salient set of public concerns, parties may seek partners to bolster their position, or to secure their political breakthrough. Electoral realignment, and the institutional rigidities it can expose, creates fertile conditions for the pursuit of alliance.\n\nBut what normative considerations might guide such relations? On what grounds is it reasonable for parties to make common cause, and what standards should such arrangements be held to? The ethics of political alliance is a topic largely unstudied. While the political theory of partisanship is growing, its concerns to date have been elsewhere: on the norms of adversarialism on the one hand, on intraparty ties on the other.Footnote 2 Political science has a wealth of material on electoral pacts, yet has tended to focus overwhelmingly on just one manifestation of alliance – the government coalition – and has made normative considerations a secondary concern, generally restricted to questions of voter choice.\n\nThis neglect of the normativity of alliance is problematic on several counts. Pacts are for one thing quite common, across a range of political settings.Footnote 3 The forms they take may vary, but a marginal phenomenon they are not. Moreover, they are typically significant events in the life of a party, as times of great possibility, also of risk. They promise to augment a party’s capacity to effect change, yet threaten to dilute what it stands for. And beyond those directly involved, alliances have systemic effects for the electoral field. Both for those on the inside and the outside, they are generally consequential and contentious. An analysis of the normativity of alliance has the potential to extend our theories of democracy in an important new direction, thereby contributing to the political theory of institutions.Footnote 4 Equally, it may be revealing in an empirical sense. Only by reflecting systematically on the arguments that alliance can support will we grasp the real-world disagreements that decisions to enter, maintain or exit such arrangements tend to produce.\n\nThe article begins by examining the concept of alliance and its normative dimensions. It distinguishes between the externalities and internalities of alliance relations, focusing the discussion on the latter – on the implications of alliance for those directly involved. The following sections identify two kinds of argument that may be advanced to justify alliance participation – one that treats it as an intrinsic good, another that defends it for instrumental reasons. Based on an analysis of such arguments in more than one form, the suggestion is that alliances can be justified on instrumental grounds, and only these. In the final section, the article moves to consider the relations between allies once their pact is established, examining the norms by which arrangements of this kind may be circumscribed.\n\nAs the opening quotation suggests, Britain is one country in which the prospect of alliance formation is a live question. With increasing frequency, the idea of a ‘progressive alliance’ has been proposed by partisans of the left and centre-left, for reasons that mix opposition to one party in particular with notions of the intrinsic appeal of partnership among like-minded parties. Similar discussions have arisen in other European countries, including Spain, France, Germany, Norway and Sweden, in the context of the fragmentation of bipartisan politics, increasingly frequent grand coalitions, emerging challenger parties, and / or the strengthening of the far Right.Footnote 5 Alliances are also a recurrent theme in non-Western democracies, notably in Argentina and India. The article seeks to bring to light some of the normative considerations in play, and in so doing advance a constructive dialogue between the political science and political theory of partisanship. The analysis should further shed light on the more general question of the normativity of alliance, relevant to contexts beyond party democracy.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWhile pacts between political parties are common, analyses of the normative questions they raise are rare. Like alliances in other domains, from international relations to the world of business, those in party democracy are typically approached as problems of bargaining strategy or system balance. The ethics of alliance are neglected, and not without cost. The distinctive structure of an alliance, as an association of associations that retains divisibility, leads to a unique set of questions beyond those of partisanship itself. The promise of such pacts is to augment the party as a mode of citizenship and an agent of political change. At the same time, such arrangements threaten to dilute its normative purpose. For anyone interested in the reformative and transformative potential of parties, as well as the controversies that partisanship gives rise to, the ethics of alliance demands attention.\n\nAs I have argued, it is possible for the committed partisan to endorse the prospect of alliance participation. Though the tension between the two forms of association is real, and creates tendencies both to dissolution on the one hand and merger on the other, it need not be fatal. Yet resolving the tension depends on seeing the worth of alliances as instrumental rather than intrinsic. Rather than as a form of epistemic enrichment or democratic inclusion, they should be valued as a means to advance programmatic ends where principled agreement exists, and as a way to counter the imperfections of political institutions. The norms to which an alliance should be held centre on ensuring that the pursuit of these second-order ends does not undermine the first-order ends that motivate allegiance to the parties in question.\n\nAs an effort to introduce new perspectives on an under-theorized practice, this article necessarily leaves a number of issues for future research. I have discussed alliance in largely general terms, but clearly there is more to be said on the different forms it can take. When, for instance, are tightly co-ordinated kinds of co-operation – for example, open primaries to select joint candidates – to be preferred over looser arrangements such as pacts of non-aggression? What kinds of organizational structures, either within or across parties, are most consistent with the norms examined, including the ones best able to counter the elitist tendencies inherent in pacts? What type of institutional recommendations for an electoral system might one distil from the analysis? If alliances between parties have instrumental rather than intrinsic worth, how might institutions be configured to reflect this? And are the normative considerations the same for transnational alliances? I leave these questions for future research. In the meantime I hope to have shown why such questions invite further study. Political alliance is a practice of normative significance. There are bad reasons to form pacts, but also some good ones, and where an alliance is worth having there are standards it should be held to."
