        "text": "Iraqi Kurds last month backed independence from Baghdad in a controversial referendum that has heightened regional tensions.\n\nIndigenous to a mountain region in the northern Middle East, the Kurds are the largest stateless nation in the world. The fourth largest ethnic group in the Middle East, around 25 million Kurds live in a territory that spans the borders of modern-day Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia.\n\nKurds have a distinct community, united by race, culture and language – although several dialects exist. Due to the cross-border nature of their nation since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Arabic and Turkish are also widely spoken.\n\nThey have a long history of political marginalisation and persecution, and have repeatedly risen up, particularly in Iraq and Turkey, in pursuit of greater autonomy or complete independence.\n\nThe destabilisation of Iraq, the war in Syria, and the rise of the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) have presented new challenges for the Kurds, as Kurdish forces have played an increasingly important role in the battle against ISIL.\n\nHistorical background\n\nAt the end of World War I, the Treaty of Sevres was drafted to deal with the dissolution and partition of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe treaty bolstered Kurdish national aspirations by providing for a referendum to decide the issue of the Kurdish homeland.\n\nThe Treaty of Sevres was rejected by the new Turkish Republic, and a new treaty (the Treaty of Lausanne) was negotiated and signed in 1923.\n\nThe Treaty of Lausanne gave control of the entire Anatolian peninsula, or Asia Minor, to the new Turkish Republic, including the Kurdish homeland in Turkey.\n\nThere was no provision in the new treaty for a referendum for Kurdish independence or autonomy. Kurdish hopes for an autonomous region and independent state were dashed for the next few decades.\n\nFrom the end of World War I to the Gulf War in 1990, the Kurds in Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria fought separate campaigns to achieve autonomy.\n\nAll of the campaigns were forcibly put down and the Kurdish people suffered greater suppression each time.\n\nOPINION: Iraqi Kurdistan – Playing the independence game\n\nWho are the Kurds in Iraq?\n\nAfter decades of military and political struggle, Kurds in Iraq secured constitutional recognition in 2005 of an autonomous Kurdish region in the north of the country.\n\nPrior to 2005, the Kurds of Iraq launched successive rebellions aimed first at the British and later at the government in Baghdad.\n\nSuccessive Iraqi administrations, particularly starting in the late 1970s, forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands of Kurds from northern Iraq, through a policy known as “Arabisation”, and repopulated the areas with Arabs from central and southern Iraq.\n\nThe scale of the displacement of Kurds in the north during the mid-1970s was immense, displacing the entire Kurdish population from an area reaching from the town of Khanaqin, close to the Iranian border, to the Syrian and Turkish border areas around Sinjar.\n\nIn the 1980s, Saddam Hussein’s government destroyed at least 4,000 villages and forcibly moved their residents to collective towns. In 1988, Hussein unleashed a campaign of vengeance on the Kurds that included a poison-gas attack on Halabja.\n\nThe Iraqi High Criminal Court later charged Hussein with genocide for attempting to annihilate the country’s Kurds through military operations in 1988 that killed at least 50,000 civilians and destroyed thousands of homes.\n\nThe first glimpse of autonomy came in 1991, during the first Gulf War, when the US-led coalition fighting Hussein established a partial no-fly zone in northern Iraq. The stability allowed Kurdish forces to steadily gain control of the territory and paved the way for the 2005 constitutional agreement.\n\nAnd while Iraq’s autonomous Kurdish areas, also known as Iraqi Kurdistan, largely escaped the chaos and destruction that existed in the lead-up to and after Hussein’s removal in 2003, major tensions remain.\n\nThe Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) has not yet defined its boundaries. Many Kurds are hoping to expand the current borders to include “contested” areas, many of which were Arabised under Hussein, including the Kurdish-majority city of Kirkuk – an oil-rich province the Kurds consider their “Jerusalem”.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, as ISIL forces swept across large swaths of Iraq, Kurdish Peshmerga forces pre-emptively moved into the city to prevent it from falling into the group’s hands.\n\nTensions also exist between the two main political parties, the Patriotic Union Party (PUK) and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), who fought a civil war from 1994 to 1997.\n\nKRG President Massoud Barzani (KDP) announced in July 2014 that his government planned to hold a referendum on independence from Iraq. The declaration caused alarm in neighbouring countries, who were fearful that their own restive Kurdish populations would follow suit.\n\nResults of the September 25 referendum showed that a majority of Iraqi Kurds supported secession.\n\nAfter the Gulf War\n\nAfter the 1990-1991 Gulf War and the no-fly zone enforced by the United States in Iraq’s Kurdish region, Iraqi Kurds had autonomy.\n\nIn 1992, an alliance of political parties, the Iraqi Kurdistan Front, held parliamentary and presidential elections.\n\nAs a result, the Iraqi Kurdistan Front established the KRG, an autonomous government for Iraq’s Kurdish region.\n\nToday, at least 5.2 million people live in Iraq’s Kurdish region, according to the KRG.\n\nThey have their own parliament, military (the Peshmerga), borders and foreign policy.\n\nIn 1994, a power-sharing arrangement between the PUK and the KDP collapsed.\n\nIn 2003, the US invaded Iraq and the Peshmerga joined in the fight to overthrow Hussein.\n\nAfter Hussein was driven from office, the Iraqis, in a national referendum, approved a new constitution. The new constitution recognised the KRG and the Kurdish parliament.\n\nIn 2006, the PUK and KDP arranged to unify administrations under Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani.\n\nKurds remain dependent on their neighbours for access to markets and to export oil, the Kurds’ main economic resource.\n\nKurds in Turkey\n\nHalf of the Kurdish nation resides in Turkey, where they make up about 20 percent of the local population.\n\nModern Turkey’s constitution denies the existence of distinct ethnic sub-groups, and since the country’s founding, any expression by Kurds or other minorities of their unique ethnic identity has been repressed. The Kurdish language, spoken by millions in Turkey, was outlawed until 1991.\n\nAnkara has consistently shut down Kurdish attempts to politically organise, and any action that hints at Kurdish nationalism is considered an offence punishable by imprisonment. The Turkish government has also been accused of systematically withholding resources from the country’s Kurdish areas.\n\nAbdullah Ocalan established the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in 1978, calling for an independent state inside Turkey.\n\nIn 1984, the PKK launched an armed struggle against the Turkish state, which eventually left between 30,000 and 40,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced, according to the International Crisis Group.\n\nThe PKK launched attacks against government property, government officials, Turks living in Kurdish areas and Kurds it accused of collaborating with the government.\n\nIn 2012, the Turkish government and the PKK began peace talks, and in 2013 a ceasefire was agreed on, although clashes continued.\n\nIn July 2015, the ceasefire collapsed a few days after a suicide bombing blamed on ISIL killed at least 33 young activists in the mainly Kurdish town of Suruc, near the Syrian border.\n\nThe United Nations said in a report this year that at least 2,000 people, including 1,200 local residents and 800 members of the security forces, have been killed in the latest wave of violence.\n\nThe PKK has attacked Turkish soldiers and police, while the Turkish government has launched what it called a “synchronised war on terror” against the PKK and ISIL.\n\nSince then, air strikes on PKK camps in northern Iraq and clashes have killed hundreds of people.\n\nWhat is the situation in Syria?\n\nIn Syria, the Democratic Union Party (PYD) is one of the most prominent Kurdish opposition parties. It comprises a major part of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish, Arab, Assyrians, Armenian, and Turkmen groups that was established in October 2015.\n\nThe PYD was founded in 2003 as an offshoot of the PKK, to which it remains closely tied. The PYD’s armed wing is the People’s Protection Units (YPG). The group has coordinated with both Syrian rebels and government forces in different parts of Syria to further its interests.\n\nDuring the Syrian conflict, it managed to carve out a mini-state in three provinces in the country’s north – Aleppo, Raqqa and Hassakah.\n\nBacked by US coalition air strikes, the US-backed SDF have been fighting ISIL in an effort to recapture Raqqa, the armed group’s self-declared capital."
