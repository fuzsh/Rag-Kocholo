        "text": "Ensuring national security, increasing influence among its Arab neighbours and securing the return of the Golan Heights, have been the primary goals of the Syrian Arab Republic's foreign policy. At many points in its history, Syria has seen tension with its neighbours, such as Turkey, Israel, Jordan, Iraq, and Lebanon. Syria enjoyed an improvement in relations with several of the states in its region in the 21st century, prior to the Arab Spring and the Syrian Civil War.\n\nUntil 2018, due to the Syrian civil war, the Syrian Arab Republic's government was partially isolated from the countries in the region and the wider international community. Diplomatic relations are severed with several countries, including Turkey, Canada, France, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, the United States, the UK, Belgium, Spain, Mexico, Qatar, Georgia, and Ukraine.[1] In 2011 and 2012, Syria was suspended from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and Union for the Mediterranean. Syria is also a full member of the Arab League. Syria is a candidate state of the new Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).[2][3]\n\nSyria continues to foster good relations with its traditional allies, Iran and Russia. Other countries that presently maintain good relations with Syria include China, North Korea, Vietnam,[4][5] Fiji, Singapore, Sri Lanka,[6] Laos,[7] Myanmar,[8] Cambodia,[9] Thailand,[10] Philippines,[11] India,[12][13][14] Pakistan,[15] Bangladesh,[16] Malaysia,[17] Indonesia[18] Brunei,[19] Armenia,[20] Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,[21] Kyrgyzstan,[22] Uzbekistan,[10] Turkmenistan,[10] Mongolia,[23] Tajikistan,[24] Greece, Cyprus, North Macedonia,[25] Czech Republic, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary,[26] Serbia, Montenegro,[27] Vatican City and Belarus.[28]\n\nSyria does not maintain diplomatic relations with Israel and South Korea, but has diplomatic relations with Abkhazia and South Ossetia.[29] Syria also maintains relations with autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan.[30]\n\nOn 26 February 2023, Bashar al-Assad met with Iraqi, Jordanian, Palestinian, Libyan, Egyptian and Emirati lawmakers, as well as representatives from Oman and Lebanon after more than a decade of isolation in the region. Arab states contributed significantly to the relief effort after the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake. A week before, Al-Assad travelled to Oman for his first foreign visit since the quake.[31]\n\nDiplomatic relations\n\n[edit]\n\nList of countries which Syria maintains diplomatic relations with:\n\n#

With the end of the war in August 1988, Syria began a slow process of reintegration with the other Arab states. In 1989, it joined with the rest of the Arab world in readmitting Egypt to the 19th Arab League Summit at Casablanca.\n\nThis decision, prompted in part by Syria's need for Arab League support of its own position in Lebanon, marked the end of the Syrian-led opposition to Egypt and the 1977–79 Sadat initiatives toward Israel, as well as the Camp David Accords. It coincided with the end of the 10-year Arab subsidy to Syria and other front-line Arab countries pledged at Baghdad in 1978. Syria re-established full diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1989. In the 1990–1991 Gulf War, Syria joined other Arab states in the US-led multinational coalition against Iraq. In 1998, Syria began a slow rapprochement with Iraq, driven primarily by economic needs. In this period, Syria continued to play an active pan-Arab role, which intensified as the Israel-Palestine peace process collapsed in September 2000 with the start of the second Palestinian uprising (Intifada) against Israel. Though it voted in favor of UNSCR 1441 in 2002, Syria was against coalition military action in Iraq in 2003. However, the Syrian government accepted UNSCR 1483 (after being absent for the actual vote), which lifted sanctions on Iraq and established a framework to assist the Iraqi people in determining their political future and rebuilding their economy.\n\nAfter start of the war in 2011, much of the Middle East condemned Syria's handling of the civil uprising, with only a few countries in the Middle East supporting Syria, most notably Iran, Iraq and Lebanon.\n\nCountry Formal Relations Began Notes Abkhazia 4 September 2018 See Abkhazia–Syria relations\n\nSyria has an embassy in Sukhumi.\n\nAbkhazia has an embassy in Damascus.\n\nAfghanistan 18 November 1951\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 18 November 1951 when has been accredited Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of Afghanistan to Syria (Resident in Bagdad) Mr. Mir Amanullah Rahimi.[305]\n\nTaliban and Syrian officials met for the first time to discuss cooperation in 2023.[306]\n\nArmenia 6 March 1992 See Armenia–Syria relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 6 March 1992.[307]\n\nArmenia has an embassy in Damascus and a consulate general in Aleppo.[308]\n\nSince 1997, Syria has an embassy in Yerevan.[309]\n\nThere are around 120,000 people of Armenian descent living in the Syria (See Armenians in Syria).[310]\n\nAustralia 12 May 1975\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 12 May 1975 when first Australian ambassador to Syria Mr. P.

Lebanon was part of Ottoman Syria until 1926. The presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon dates to 1976, when President Hafez Al-Assad intervened in the Lebanese civil war on behalf of Maronite Christians. Following the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Syrian and Israeli forces clashed in eastern Lebanon. The late U.S. Ambassador Philip Habib negotiated a cease-fire in Lebanon and the subsequent evacuation of PLO fighters from West Beirut. However, Syrian opposition blocked implementation of the 17 May 1983 Lebanese-Israeli accord on the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. Following the February 1984 withdrawal of the UN Multinational Force from Beirut and the departure of most of Israel's forces from southern Lebanon a year later, Syria launched an unsuccessful initiative to reconcile warring Lebanese factions and establish a permanent cease-fire. Syria actively participated in the March–September 1989 fighting between the Christian Lebanese Forces and Muslim forces allied with Syria. In 1989, Syria endorsed the Charter of National Reconciliation, or \"Taif Accord\", a comprehensive plan for ending the Lebanese conflict negotiated under the auspices of Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and Morocco.\n\nAt the request of Lebanese President Hrawi, the Syrian military took joint action with the Lebanese Armed Forces on 13 October 1990, to oust rebel Gen. Michel Aoun who had defied efforts at reconciliation with the legitimate Government of Lebanon. The process of disarming and disbanding the many Lebanese militias began in earnest in early 1991. In May 1991, Lebanon and Syria signed the treaty of brotherhood, cooperation, and coordination called for in the Taif Accord, which is intended to provide the basis for many aspects of Syrian-Lebanese relations. The treaty provides the most explicit recognition to date by the Syrian Government of Lebanon's independence and sovereignty.\n\nAccording to the U.S. interpretation of the Taif Accord, Syria and Lebanon were to have decided on the redeployment of Syrian forces from Beirut and other coastal areas of Lebanon by September 1992. Israeli occupation of Lebanon until May 2000, the breakdown of peace negotiations between Syria and Israel that same year, and intensifying Arab/Israeli tensions since the start of the second Palestinian uprising in September 2000 have helped delay full implementation of the Taif Accords. The UN declared that Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon fulfilled the requirements of UN Security Council Resolution 425. However, Syria and Lebanon claimed that UNSCR 425 had not been fully implemented because Israel did not withdraw from an area of the Golan Heights called Shebaa Farms, which had been occupied by Israel in 1967, and which Syria now claimed was part of Lebanon. The United Nations does not recognize this claim. However, Lebanese resistance groups such as Hezbollah use it to justify attacks against Israeli forces in that region, creating a potentially dangerous flashpoint along the Lebanon-Israeli border.\n\nIn 2005, Syrian troops withdrew from Lebanon after the assassination of Lebanese Sunni Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on 14 February 2005. In December 2008, The Syrian Embassy was opened in Beirut for the first time in history since both countries gained their Independence during the 1940s. In March 2009, Lebanon followed and opened its embassy in Damascus. On 19 December 2009, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Al-Hariri visited Syria, and stayed in Damascus for three days meeting with President Bashar Al-Assad & breaking the ice between the two sides.[365]\n\nMalaysia 1958 See Malaysia–Syria relations\n\nSyria has an embassy in Kuala Lumpur[366]\n\nMalaysian embassy in Damascus is closed since August 2012, due to the Syrian Civil War.[367]\n\nMalaysia has an honorary consulate in Damascus.[368]\n\nMongolia 31 July 1967\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 31 July 1967.[369]\n\nMongolian delegates from the then-ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party traveled to Syria in 1978, 1982 and 1985.\n\nSyrian Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party delegates visited Mongolia in 1983 and 1986.\n\nBilateral relations between Mongolia and Syria (in Mongolian)\n\nMyanmar 15 June 1972 See Myanmar–Syria relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 15 June 1972.[370]\n\nNew Zealand 5 December 2006\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 5 December 2006.[371]\n\nNorth Korea 25 July 1966\n\nSee North Korea–Syria relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 25 July 1966.[372]\n\nSyria has an embassy in Pyongyang.[373]\n\nNorth Korea has an embassy in Damascus.[374]\n\nNorth Korea is one of Syria's closest allies.[374]\n\nIn September 2015, the Syrian government paid tribute to Kim Il Sung in a ceremony for a new park in Damascus named in his honor.[375]\n\nOman 19 December 1987 See Oman–Syria relations\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 19 December 1987.[128]\n\nSyria has an embassy in Muscat.\n\nOman has an embassy in Damascus.\n\nSince the start of the war, Syria and Oman have been strategic allies.[376]\n\nBoth countries are members of Arab League.\n\nPakistan 1948 See Pakistan–Syria relations\n\nSyria has an embassy in Islamabad.\n\nPakistan has an embassy in Damascus.\n\nBoth countries were on the silk route through which civilizational exchanges took place for centuries, Islamic missionaries that introduced Islam after 711 AD were from Syria.

Syrian–Turkish relations have long been strained even though Turkey shares its longest common border with Syria and various other geographic, cultural, and historical links tie the two neighboring states together.\n\nThis friction has been due to disputes including the self annexation of the Hatay Province to Turkey in 1939, water disputes resulting from the Southeastern Anatolia Project, and Syria's support for the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA), but relations have improved greatly since October 1998; when PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan was expelled by Syrian authorities.\n\nSyria had embassy in Ankara[398] and two consulates–general in Istanbul[399] and Gaziantep.[400]\n\nBoth countries have been full members of the Union for the Mediterranean and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), although Syria's membership in the former was suspended in 2011[401][402][403] as well as from the latter in 2012.[404]\n\nBecause of the Syrian civil war relations between Syria and Turkey have become increasingly tense. Turkey closed its embassy in Damascus on March 26, 2012,[405] as well as its consulate–general in Aleppo.[citation needed] In April 2012 it hosted the second meeting of the Friends of Syria, the Arab-Western coalition in support of the Syrian opposition.[405]\n\nTurkey has been taking in refugees from Syria, although abuse and injustice towards the Syrian refugees has been reported. Relations have further been degraded due to a serious incident that occurred with the Syrian downing of a Turkish military training flight in June 2012. Relations worsened further in May 2013 following a border incident involving two car bombs exploding in the town of Reyhanlı, Hatay Province, Turkey. At least 43 people were killed and 140 more were injured in the attack. The car bombs were left outside Reyhanlı's town hall and post office. The first exploded at around 13:45 local time (10:45 GMT)[40] and the second exploded about 15 minutes later.\n\nThe issue that cemented the crack in the relations was Turkey's reported dealings with the Islamic State (an enemy of the Syrian government) in oil and weapons by various sources. A video surfacing of the Islamic State being unopposed by Turkish security as they traveled across the border between Syria, questions more of Turkey's alleged role of simply fighting terrorism.[citation needed]\n\nTurkish Military troops attacked the Kurdish backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) on October 8, 2019, after the acting US President [Trump] recalled US military troops from Syria the previous day.

The regional normalisation effort had caught the U.S. and its European allies by surprise, as they were opposing an \"Arab-led political path\" in solving the crisis. According to the statement, al-Assad would be allowed to the meeting on 19 May 2023, if \"he wishes to do so\". The new political process in Syria was described as the \"Jordanian Initiative\".[543]\n\nNevertheless, Syria remains under international sanctions after millions of Syrians had been displaced or sought refuge in Arab and European countries during the war.
