        "text": "As Passed by the Young Democrats of America Biennial Convention\n\nAssembled this 21st day of June 2023, in Las Vegas, Nevada\n\nPARTY STRUCTURE AND CORE VALUES\n\nWe Believe:\n\nAmerica’s strength derives from people coming together and working for the common good. Acceptance of diverse viewpoints is fundamental to a well-functioning democracy and an inclusive society where we stand up for antiracist, feminist, and workers’ legislation. We are proud of our values, especially in the face of opposition. There is no campaign we cannot win, and there is no issue we must sacrifice in the fight for our nation’s future.\n\nWe the Young Democrats of America Will:\n\nSupport implementation of a nationwide campaign approach, leaving no Democrat, no voter, and no young person behind. As there are Young Democrats in every state in the Union, we will never concede their political futures to Republican domination but will instead proudly carry our shared message of hope and progress into every state and territory.\n\nSupport recruitment of Democratic candidates for all 535 voting seats and the 6 non-voting seats of The United States Congress. Support recruitment of Democratic candidates for the congressional representation of U.S. Territories.\n\nSupport Young Democratic candidates who are running in local and state office races, so that no election goes uncontested and no chance to build young leaders is missed. To do this, we must recruit, fund, and train those candidates, while helping local chapters find races in which to run young candidates.\n\nIncrease peer-to-peer communication by speaking with progressive and democratically allied issue groups, by locating new voters in our local communities, by speaking out to our friends and family members, and by taking our message for the future to the people.\n\nBuilding of strong, lasting relationships among local Democratic clubs, labor unions, and other progressive organizations; accept and encourage the role of progressive and grassroots organizations with common goals in guiding our party, and welcome their involvement in both primary and general elections.\n\nDemand inclusion at all levels of the Democratic Party, including state and local executive committees and as party delegates, allowing the voice of the future leaders of the Democratic Party to be heard and listened to.\n\nHelp recruit and support Democratic candidates who reflect the very best of their local character and values.\n\nEnsure Democratic organizations, including labor unions, national, state, and county committees, political campaigns, and other allied organizations are actively recruiting and hiring individuals from underrepresented populations who reflect the communities they serve.\n\nGOVERNMENT AND ELECTORAL REFORM\n\nWe Believe:\n\nFree and Fair elections are fundamental to democracy in our country. Young people often find themselves disenfranchised due to residency laws, lack of education, and the transitory nature of youth. The federal government should encourage young people to participate in the democratic process. We further believe the federal government should set realistic and reliable standards for election administration to ensure fair, accurate, and accessible vote casting and counting, coupled with federal grants to state and local governments to assist with compliance. We reject collusion with foreign entities and oppose any foreign interference in the fair administration of our elections, as fair elections are the very core of our democracy.\n\nWe Support:\n\nFair and free elections.\n\nEarly voting, same-day registration, no-fault absentee voting, and vote by mail.\n\nVoting systems that ensure accuracy, fairness, and transparency while safeguarding privacy and accessibility.\n\nThe formation of independent, non-partisan commissions to draw district lines that are an accurate representation of a diverse electorate and compliant with the Voting Rights Act.\n\nCampaign finance laws that ensure that ideas, not money, are the deciding factor in elections.\n\nCampaign finance solutions that mitigate the influence of large corporations in favor of more equal funding power for all constituents, such as equal democracy dollars to all Americans and public campaign finance options.\n\nExpanded implementation of the National Voter Registration Act, which requires federal agencies to provide voter registration opportunities.\n\nEfforts by states to restore voting rights to citizens that have been convicted of crimes and who have served their sentences.\n\nEfforts and policies which help to close the voter registration gap between communities of color and white voters.\n\nStatehood and all of its rights and privileges for the District of Columbia, including full congressional representation, self-rule, and the abolition of the tyrannical practice of taxation without representation.\n\nIncreasing pay/compensation nationally of poll workers/election workers.\n\nStrict penalties for people who impede access to polling places, buy votes, intimidate voters, and purposefully distribute false information about voting procedures.\n\nReasonable efforts to ensure there are adequate, well-staffed polling locations serving all areas where voting occurs, and that these polling locations are accessible to all voting populations, including, but not limited to, college campuses, rural populations, and Native American reservations.\n\nWe believe Congress must act on the will of the people of Puerto Rico and approve an enabling act with terms for Puerto Rico’s admission as a state of the Union. The people of Puerto Rico have exercised their right to self-determination, resulting in overwhelming support for Statehood. Thus, we support granting the full admission of Puerto Rico as a state of our Union.\n\nBarriers to fraudulent or deceptive third-party voter registration.\n\nTransparency in government and rigorous compliance with the Freedom of Information Act and state-level public records laws.\n\nExtension of Section Four of the Voting Rights Act to cover all jurisdictions within the United States, thus allowing Section Five to be fully used once again.\n\nThe creation of a federal holiday on Election Day to allow an equal opportunity to vote.\n\nAutomatic voter registration of eligible voters and allowing the opportunity to opt out.\n\nThe reunification of Democratic caucuses and factions within state legislatures and localities in the United States to prevent rogue factions from denying Democrats the majority in these legislative bodies and preventing progressive legislation from being passed by these bodies.\n\nPartnerships with organizations who seek to make the following more accessible under current policy: (i) vote casting; (ii) voter education; (iii) community discussion on propositions/measures/candidates; (iiii) and voter confirmation of ballot receipt from the appropriate states or county election offices.\n\nAll federal campaigns with more than 10 paid staffers to be accessible to persons with disabilities by having a 508/ADA Coordinator and/or an Access Coordinator.\n\nThe abolition of the congressional filibuster in its current state, as it exists as a tool of undemocratic legislative obstruction.\n\nThe ceasing of the Electoral College system in favor of a national popular vote as the method for electing the President of the United States.\n\nThe implementation of ranked-choice voting in elections where feasible to better ensure democratic representation and vote equity.\n\nAllowing undocumented immigrants or noncitizens to vote in their local, state, and federal elections in the state they reside in.\n\nForming an Independent Commission Against Corruption.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nVoting impediments, voter intimidation, and voter fraud.\n\nAny law that would require identification to vote or register to vote.\n\nAny politically-motivated attempt to purge voter rolls.\n\nCorruption, to include taking bribes, kickbacks, nepotism, or any other uses of public office for personal gain.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling, and reject the idea corporations are living, breathing human beings, and the idea that money is free speech.\n\nThe inclusion of a citizenship question on the census survey or any other similar scare tactic aimed at suppressing minority representation.\n\nAny and all dishonest attempts, whether foreign or domestic, to discredit the validity, fairness, or results of fairly-administered and free elections in the United States.\n\nTaxation without representation for those who are taxed by American entities regardless of where they reside.\n\nECONOMIC POLICY\n\nWe Believe:\n\nFree and fair trade offers a course for sustainable growth throughout the global economy to the benefit of the United States, our allies, and the impoverished nations of the world.\n\nWe Support:\n\nIncluding rigorous labor and environmental standards in all trade agreements to improve the living and working conditions throughout the world.\n\nInvesting in the creativity of American workers and businesses to maximize the competitiveness of the United States in the global economy.\n\nRetraining American workers who are displaced by trade liberalization so that they can quickly return to the workforce, by focusing on future technologies such as manufacturing and clean energy jobs.\n\nPassing the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) Act to measure economic success by factors of total annual economic benefits for personal consumption expenditures; consumer durables; publicly provided goods/services; higher education & workforce skills; leisure time; unpaid labor; infrastructure; ecosystem services of natural areas. In addition, it will also include factors of total annual economic costs for income inequality; underemployment & unemployment; homelessness; domestic abuse; crime; pollution; land/soil degradation; greenhouse gas emissions; depletion of ozone; traffic and motor vehicle accidents.\n\nThe creation of public banks.\n\nNew trade agreements and existing deals that open agricultural markets to American farmers.\n\nEnding subsidies to companies that outsource American jobs.\n\nThe implementation of universal basic income.\n\nDeclaring that an economic partnership with Mexico and Canada is most important for the United States; that economic partnership must be maintained.\n\nMore tax cuts for lower-income and needy Americans.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nAny and all abuses and violations of workers’ rights, labor policies, and environmental standards, particularly by large multinational corporations.\n\nThe efforts of all nations to manipulate currency and dump cheap goods into the market.\n\nTax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Trickle-down economics does not work!\n\nLABOR\n\nWe Believe:\n\nIn expanding collective bargaining throughout our modern, service-based economy to maintain economic flexibility and to build economic opportunity, while vigorously defending a century’s worth of hard-fought progress and protections won by the American worker united in purpose and organized in action.\n\nWe Support:\n\nThe right of

projects in this country.\n\nPolicies to protect the pensions of workers.\n\nEnsuring that workers have the ability to accrue Paid Sick Time at a reasonable rate so a worker will never have to choose between their livelihood and their family’s health.\n\nImplementing fair workweek scheduling legislation so workers will have advance warning of their schedule and will not be penalized or terminated if the schedule is not workable.\n\nEncouraging and incentivizing employee-owned, democratically-managed businesses through worker cooperatives to retain and create jobs, strengthen communities, expand economic growth, guarantee safe workplaces, and increase wealth for a broad sector of workers.\n\nThe Davis – Bacon Act which guarantees a prevailing wage in federal construction work.\n\nEconomic tax breaks, directly proportional to a minimum wage increase, to small businesses who employ no more than eight (8) individuals.\n\nThe decision of political workers in organizations, parties, legislatures, and campaigns who seek to unionize, as well as the voluntary recognition by their respective managers of their right to collective bargaining.\n\nCo-determination

under-the-table employees.\n\nAny preemption laws that block the passage of minimum wage, sick leave, fair scheduling, terminations without cause, non-discrimination protections, and other worker-friendly laws at the local level.\n\nAny policies that attempt to expose undocumented workers, such as the employment verification screenings imposed by Florida.\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY\n\nWe Believe:\n\nSocial Security has been the most successful and visionary social program in American history. We are proud to claim its legacy and its compact with the American people as our own, and we will fight to ensure that Americans enjoy the benefits of this program for generations to come, defending it from all efforts to weaken the social safety net and to render the system any less secure.\n\nWe Support:\n\nA Social Security system that protects the funding, benefits, and long-term viability that Social Security provides for all Americans.\n\nThe elimination of the income cap on the payroll tax, to ensure fiscal stability and maintain the system’s progressive character.\n\nIncreasing Social Security benefits for recipients.\n\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI), a monthly Social Security benefit that disabled and/or blind low-income Americans receive.\n\nTitle IV-E funded programs, which includes Adoption Assistance and Guardianship Assistance.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nThe privatization of Social Security.\n\nAny reduction of Social Security benefits that would break the trust and expectations of the American worker.\n\nReducing benefits to beneficiaries during national economic distress.\n\nTHE FEDERAL BUDGET\n\nWe Believe:\n\nLeadership requires responsible stewardship of public resources on behalf of our nation’s future that restrains growth in government spending while protecting the adequacy and sustainability of government revenue. We believe that an individual’s tax burden should be tied directly to his or her ability to pay, progressive in character and in spirit, with reasonable checks within the system to avoid fraud and abuse.\n\nWe Support:\n\nContinued and increased Federal investment in our country’s aging infrastructure and in alternative energy.\n\nPassing tax cuts that benefit middle-class and low-income Americans; not the wealthiest Americans.\n\nEnacting long-term budget plans that are designed to balance the Federal budget over the course of the business cycle, offsetting deficits during economic slowdowns with surpluses during periods of growth.\n\nA broad-based, progressive tax system that fully funds all of the functions of the Federal Government.\n\nA restoration of the estate tax, which is vital both to restoring balance to the federal budget as well as ensuring that wealth does not become concentrated in too few hands.\n\nA Carbon Tax to provide the revenue necessary to fund research into alternative energy sources and provide incentives for sustainable growth.\n\nTransparent and accountable government budgeting.\n\nDetailed disclosure of congressional office expenditures in the federal budget.\n\nA closure of loopholes in corporate tax codes and off-shore tax havens, ensuring hidden profits made by hedge funds and private equity managers are accounted for, requiring government contractors pay their full taxes, and the creation of a more efficient and fair tax code.\n\nImplementation of a federal financial transaction tax, which would place a small fee on all transactions occurring within a domestic financial market.\n\nTax cuts for middle and lower-income individuals in order to create a vibrant middle class in which we all prosper.\n\nAbolishing the debt ceiling.\n\nEfforts to strengthen the stability of our economy by replacing regressive and excise taxation mechanisms — such as sales and payroll taxes — with equitable ones — such as progressive income taxes and land value taxes.\n\nThe implementation of universal basic income.\n\nPaying off US debt repayments.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nUsing off-budget spending and undisclosed earmarks to circumvent proper channels and to avoid accountability and oversight.\n\nThe use of accounting gimmicks to conceal the true costs of policies and programs.\n\nDefaulting on US debt repayments.\n\nPOVERTY\n\nWe Believe:\n\nGovernment is a valuable tool in addressing and ultimately eliminating the worst forms of economic hardship in modern society. We believe the government has an indispensable role in empowering individuals with the tools to take responsibility for bettering themselves. Moreover, through investment in education, community building, and targeted efforts to expand economic opportunities for children from impoverished backgrounds, we believe government can be a powerful force in alleviating the destructive cycle of poverty that traps so many in hopelessness and despair from too young an age.\n\nWe Support:\n\nIncreasing the minimum wage, and passage of federal, state, and local living wage legislation to help Americans rise out of poverty.\n\nSection 8 housing programs, which provide alternatives to traditional public housing projects.\n\nVocational training, financial education, and adult education to provide opportunities for the disadvantaged to better their lot in life.\n\nThe promotion and implementation of microlending practices aimed at high-poverty areas.\n\nThe recognition of housing as a basic human right and a necessity for families and individuals to move forward in life; therefore, we support housing subsidies based on need relative to the cost of living in their community.\n\nFood stamps, WIC, and TANF which provides financial assistance to Americans who require it.\n\nWelfare reform as long as this reform provides comprehensive job training, child care, and significant federal support in the transition from welfare to work.\n\nPrograms that provide communities the resources to fight food deserts through the development of farmers markets, urban farms, and public-private partnerships for grocery stores and grocery delivery.\n\nAn expansion and improvement of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Care Tax Credit to ensure that working families are able to support themselves and that workers are incentivized to find employment.\n\nWelfare reform as long as this reform provides comprehensive job training, child care, and significant federal support in the transition from welfare to work.\n\nPassing federal unconditional survival checks to the American people to provide a Guaranteed Income Tax Credit of $1,200/mo to all low and middle-income adults and $600/mo to minors by 2028, and funding basic income pilot programs nationwide and making permanent the American Rescue Plan’s expansion of the Child Tax Credit.\n\nFree school lunches for all students who attend public K-12 schools.\n\nUniversal basic income for lower-income and needy Americans.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nPredatory lending practices, especially those that feed upon lower-and middle-income families.\n\nRedlining, which prevents financial mobility of low to moderate-income communities.\n\nAny HUD or Government Assistance Policy that negatively impacts people based on the basis of race, socioeconomic status, gender, gender identity, familial status, age, religion, sexual orientation, ethnic background, national origin, or disability.\n\nRequiring that Americans work or be employed to avoid poverty.\n\nCriminalizing poor Americans for fees they cannot afford.\n\nHOUSING\n\nThe cost of housing has made it too expensive to live a secure and stable life in many of the nation’s urban and rural areas, centers, leading to skyrocketing homelessness and financial insecurity. We demand the government take swift action to fund the construction of affordable housing built near accessible public transit lines, along with the return of strong rent control to stabilize communities. We demand that this is done in a way which prioritizes low-income and marginalized minority population’s needs over the financial interest of developers. Housing is a human right.\n\nWe Support:\n\nThe creation of attainable housing.\n\nRent Control initiatives, including: Maximum Rent, Percentage Rent Increases (Indexation), Attainable housing (i.e. Affordable housing), Capping late fees, Eliminating Daily Rent Price Changing, Ending Predatory Rental Promotions, restricting so-called “renovictions”, eliminating any and all pet fees, landlords must have facilities that are ADA compliant.\n\nThe increase in funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nThe expansion of safe outdoor sites.\n\nHousing first policies.\n\nRReforming zoning laws and expediting permit processes to make it easier to develop Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), Multiplex, Permanent Supportive Housing, and Multidwelling units (MDUs). To create more affordable housing, and curb the housing crisis across the nation.\n\nThe removal of restrictive group living ordinances.\n\nTenant Protections such as Just Cause Eviction, Tenant Right to Due Process, Tenant Right to Repair, Tenant Right to Organize, and Tenant Right to Privacy Laws.\n\nGuaranteeing the right to shelter for homeless individuals and families; offering supportive housing with a continuum of care and social assistance programs to help chronically homeless individuals become permanently housed; and building meaningful community partnerships that provide social support to people who have experienced homelessness.\n\nEmpowering statewide or countywide entities to properly ensure their constituent cities build and maintain adequate housing stock — which may include overriding local zoning restrictions or approval processes — and prioritize transit-oriented, walkable communities.\n\nShelter investment.\n\nPublic-private partnerships to build affordable and sustainable housing, such as Mutual Housing California.\n\nCreation of market-rate affordable and permanent supportive housing in areas of high need.\n\nHousing and social assistance programs to house and keep housed Americans who experience homelessness.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nThe criminalization of homelessness including camping bans, bans on public feeding, and bans on sleeping in a car.\n\nUtility shut-offs.\n\nEvictions without defense.\n\nRidiculously high Junk Fees such as: Late Fees, Credit Card Processing Fees, Application Fees, and Amenity Fees.\n\nStigmatization, demonization, and victim-blaming of homeless individuals; NIMBYism and the gentrification it inevitably causes; and exclusionary zoning, which is a mechanism of institutionalized racism.\n\nSystemic racism in home appraisals.\n\nINTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL SECURITY\n\nWe Believe:\n\nUS foreign policy should promote liberty, democracy, human rights, minority rights, women’s rights, LGBT rights, and opportunity throughout the world in a truly collaborative fashion with our allies, shunning unilateralism and living up to our responsibility to the global community as the leading liberal-democratic superpower. The 21st century has witnessed the United States bogged down in “forever wars” and the tide of freedom and democracy challenged by newly expansionist illiberal and undemocratic foreign world powers. Soft power, including diplomacy, economic development, and international institutions, is the surest way for the United States to advance its strategic interests, to provide leadership in the global community, and to advance our values worldwide. For the sake of those values, our like-minded partners around the world must have confidence in American support for our common task of building a better world for everyone. The dictators of the world are not our friends, and they are not to be emulated.\n\nGlobally:\n\nWe Believe:\n\nIn the right of all peoples to self-determination, and the resolution of all territorial conflicts according to the democratic will of the populations of the territories in question.\n\nThat Democracy is the only legitimate form of government, but that it cannot be imposed militarily by foreign intervention.\n\nIn the primacy of America’s diplomatic corps rather than the military as the instrument of foreign policy.\n\nWe Support:\n\nThe basic political rights of all people, including the right to free speech, to free association, and to vote in free and fair elections.\n\nThe rights of refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nForeign and development aid to the developing world, including NGOs and IGOs sponsoring microloans.\n\nEnhancing economic, political, and social cooperation with countries that uphold democratic values, fair working conditions, workers’ rights, and a living wage.\n\nPrograms promoting equal access to opportunities for women throughout the world.\n\nIncreased international efforts to address the broad health, social, economic, and political effects of all known and future pandemics, including making generic medicines available to underdeveloped countries, especially US assistance with global vaccination.\n\nGiving underdeveloped nations the tools they need to confront the challenges faced by poverty, hunger, starvation, and disease.\n\nA strong commitment to the concerns of human rights, labor, religious freedom, environmental, and health issues in the negotiation and implementation of all international agreements.\n\nEfforts by the United Nations and other intergovernmental organizations to further peace and justice in the global community.\n\nUnrestricted, universal access to Long Acting Reversible contraceptives and information about family planning methods in order to reduce the spread of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS, improve worldwide health, and raise the standard of living.\n\nGlobal cooperation on the climate crisis, and to curb sea level rise, including the Paris climate agreement.\n\nThe War Powers Act, stating that the president must receive authorization from Congress to start a military conflict or war.\n\nThe rights and welfare of indigenous communities around the world.\n\nThe right of refugees to request and receive asylum without imprisonment, discrimination, and/or abuse from the country(s) they are entering.\n\nThe right of those fleeing natural disaster, climate change, poverty, or other devastating phenomena to enter countries in which they will be safe.\n\nIncreasing funding for the State Department to retain our best diplomats.\n\nIncreasing soldier pay and veterans’ benefits.\n\nInternational cooperation to prevent terror attacks at home and abroad.\n\nThe “Build Back Better” World Partnership to develop global infrastructure, and to counter the Chinese “One Belt One Road” initiative.\n\nThe “Summit for Democracy” initiative to rally the democratic nations of the world to form a geopolitical bloc in favor of democracy and human rights, and against authoritarianism.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nDictatorship, the criminalization of peaceful political opposition and of criticism of governments, and interference with the right of democracy.\n\nThe proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.\n\nThe allocation of money to support outdated and unnecessary weapons systems.\n\nContinued violations of UN resolutions.\n\nThe interference of the United States of America in the free and fair elections of sovereign nations.\n\nForever Wars.\n\nThe Mexico City Policy on Abortion Access.\n\nAny efforts by the United States, its allies, or any other global powers to reject, reduce, or limit vaccines or any other medical supplies to any countries as measures of international relations policies and negotiating powers.\n\nIn the Western Hemisphere:\n\nWe Believe:\n\nAmerica must be a genuine partner for peace, stability, and economic growth in the Western Hemisphere, acknowledging the mistakes of America’s past relationship with Latin America and bringing about a new era of cooperation. We reject the false dichotomy of neoliberalism or socialist dictatorship, and believe that every country in the region is entitled to political freedom and economic security.\n\nWe Support:\n\nA trade bloc with Canada and Mexico that harmonizes regulations across the three countries and guarantees rigorous labor rights, human rights, and environmental protections.\n\nSignificant commitment of US government resources to support Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvidor, including food security, climate adaptation, education and workforce development, and public health access in order to address the root causes of the poverty and violence that causes people to flee these countries for the United States.\n\nThe aspirations of all peoples of the Americas, including Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, for freedom and democracy, including the right of self-determination and to choose elected officials free of external interference.\n\nThe language, territorial, sovereign, environmental, and cultural rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nPrioritizing Mexico and Canada as two of our primary economic partners.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nThe dictatorial regimes of Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, and their crackdowns on basic political and human rights.\n\nViolent crackdowns on the right to protest, including in Colombia and Chile.\n\nDemocratic backsliding and authoritarian “caudillismo” politics.\n\nThe US embargo of Cuba.\n\nThe deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest and violence committed against communities that reside in and safeguard this critically important biome.\n\nIn Europe:\n\nWe Believe:\n\nNorth America and Europe are two of the biggest pillars of the liberal democratic world. We share with Europe profound economic and political ties. We believe strongly in the transatlantic alliance, and in a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Europe, safe from threats both within and without, and in particular from rising domestic illiberal nationalism and from Russian aggression.\n\nWe Support:\n\nThe NATO alliance. While Europe must also contribute to its own defense, we believe that America’s commitment to defend our NATO allies against aggression by Russia or any other power must be unshakable, for the sake of both our values and our interests.\n\nA strong European Union. A more centralized Europe can better defend itself and can better act as a fellow liberal democratic superpower, partnered with America in our joint pursuit of a peaceful and free world order.\n\nThe struggle of the people of Eastern Europe, particularly Ukraine, and Belarus, to free themselves of Russian domination, and the struggle of the Russian people themselves for freedom and democracy against the Putin regime.\n\nUkraine in its war for survival against the Russian invasion, and US and other foreign material support for this cause. We are proud to serve, as we did in WWII, as an arsenal of democracy.\n\nLong-term aid and support for Ukraine to recover from the damage inflicted by Russia’s invasion.\n\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.\n\nUrging NATO to admit Georgia and Moldova as member states, and Ukraine after the cessation of hostilities with Russia.\n\nThe NATO open door policy.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nThe illiberal, anti-LGBT, far-right democratic backsliding in countries such as Poland and Hungary, including the restriction of reproductive rights.\n\nThe brutal suppression of democracy by the Lukashenko regime in Belarus.\n\nThe abetment of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by the material support of drones from Iran and munitions from China and North Korea, used in the terror bombing of Ukrainian cities.\n\nAttempts to halt aid to Ukraine in Congress.\n\nRussia:\n\nWe Believe:\n\nRussia under the Putin regime has continued, out of a desire for resurgence as a global superpower, to menace its neighbors, to launch a brutal, terroristic, imperialist, and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, to threaten the peace and stability of Europe and the Middle East, and to directly attack the United States. Vladimir Putin is not America’s friend. He is a war criminal.\n\nWe Support:\n\nStrong and punitive sanctions of other retributive actions against Russia for aggression against Ukraine, and their cyberattacks against the United States during the 2016 election.\n\nThe protests of the Russian people against the Putin Regime, and the basic rights of political dissidents in Russia.\n\nThe defense of our NATO allies in Eastern Europe against possible Russian invasion.\n\nAid to Ukraine in the defense and recapture of its territory from Russian invasion.\n\nThe Magnitsky Act and other legislation to freeze assets of human rights violators operating with the blessing of the Putin regime and other oppressive governments.\n\nThe removal of the Russian Federation from the UN Security Council.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nRussian cyberattacks on US domestic infrastructure. This is a direct hostile attack on the people of the United States.\n\nRussian political interference in US elections and affairs.\n\nRussia’s illegal occupation of Crimea and eastern Ukraine, and its continued aggression against Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s maintenance of “frozen conflicts” in Transnistria and the Caucuses.\n\nRussia’s military presence in Syria.\n\nRussian efforts to destabilize the European Union, including but not limited to its covert support for Brexit and for far-right eurosceptic movements in France, and its attempts to use the supply of covid vaccines as a geopolitical wedge.\n\nRussia’s anti-LGBTQIA+ policies and its inhumane treatment of activists and communities fighting for equality.\n\nPutin and the Russian government’s targeting and persecution of political rivals and Russia’s suppression of free speech.\n\nRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including massacres and torture chambers as have been uncovered in Bucha, Izium, Kherson, and Chernihiv.\n\nRussia’s large-scale abduction and deportation of Ukrainians and particularly children, rivaling in scale the forced deportations of ethnic minorities conducted under Stalin.\n\n“Russia’s self-declared “annexation” of Crimea, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk after sham “referenda.”.\n\nFreedom of Russia Legion.\n\nIn Africa:\n\nWe Believe:\n\nAmidst rapid growth in both population and economy, the 21st Century has the potential to be an African Century. Africa’s relationship with the US and the rest of the world must be a fair and equal one, free of neocolonialism and dept-trap diplomacy.\n\nWe support:\n\nUS aid in the fight against AIDS, COVID-19, Malaria, and other infectious diseases.\n\nThe right of the Sahawari people to self-determination.\n\nInternational efforts to stabilize countries and regions experiencing war and violence, including UN peacekeeping missions, in countries such as Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and across the Sahel region.\n\nWe oppose:\n\nThe ethnic cleansing of Oromo people by Ethiopia.\n\nThe continued genocide in Darfur by Sudan.\n\nThe terrorist insurgency of Boko Haram in Nigeria, and in particular its abhorrent attacks on schoolgirls, and the attempt by the Janjaweed, now styling itself as the “Rapid Support Force” to overthrow the Sudanese government.\n\nInternational efforts to stabilize countries and regions experiencing war and violence, including UN peacekeeping missions, in countries such as Sudan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and across the Sahel region.\n\nIn the Middle East, South, and Central Asia:\n\nWe Believe:\n\nAmerica’s large-scale forever wars and indifference to human rights abuses, including those of our allies, have failed to adequately serve our interests or our values. Rather than contributing to instability, the US should approach the Middle East with soft power and moderation.\n\nWe Support:\n\nThe withdrawal of US forces from Iraq and Syria. The post-9/11 project of attempting by force of arms to transform foreign countries into liberal democracies has failed, has squandered millions of lives and trillions of dollars, has failed to achieve US interests, and has even directly harmed such interests.\n\nUS diplomatic engagement in long-term peace and a settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, lest it continue to claim lives and to be exploited by the questionable ambitions of regional powers like Russia and Turkey.\n\nThe peaceful development of democracy throughout the region.\n\nContinued sanctions on the Assad regime in Syria.\n\nSelf-determination for the people of occupied and disputed territories, including but not limited to Kurdistan, Kashmir, East Turkestan, and Tibet.\n\nA combination of sanctions and diplomacy with respect to Iran to curb its nuclear program and address its destabilizing influence across the region.\n\nA two-state solution in Israel and Palestine, including a fully sovereign and free Palestine, alongside Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish-majority democratic state, with equal rights for all inhabitants, and with borders established by mutual agreement. The United States should take an even-handed approach to the conflict, including by upgrading our diplomatic ties to Palestine, and US aid policy towards Israel should reflect this goal, and should be used as leverage to incentivize Israel to engage in the peace process in good faith, rather than being dispensed unconditionally.\n\nDiplomatic and economic efforts to stabilize Lebanon, including the disarming of paramilitary groups outside the control of the Lebanese government.\n\nIranian women in their fight for human rights, democracy, and freedom from the oppression of the Iranian government.\n\nThe anti-regime protests and the Freedom Movement in Iran.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nRegime change as an objective of US policy.\n\nUnrestricted US drone warfare in endless undeclared wars, including, but not limited to, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Somalia.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s brutal war in Yemen, and US military support thereof.\n\nThe gross human rights abuses of the Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. The US must reduce its carbon dependence for the sake of our ability to represent our values with respect to these oil-exporting countries.\n\nRussian military presence in Syria.\n\nIran’s military presence in Iraq and Syria, its attempts to develop nuclear weapons, its support for Houthi rebels in Yemen, its supply of drones for Russian terror bombing in Ukraine, and its violent stifling of civil society and women’s, human, and political rights domestically.\n\nThe continuing brutality of the Assad regime in Syria, and its allies.\n\nTurkey’s suppression of the Kurds and its occupation of Northern Cyprus.\n\nIsrael’s occupation of the West Bank, and the denial of civil and political rights on an equal basis in the territories it militarily occupies.\n\nThe continued and expanding Israeli settlement enterprise in the West Bank and the forced displacement of Palestinians, which jeopardizes a two-state solution.\n\nIndia’s crackdown in Kashmir, including attempts to disconnect Kashmir from the internet, and on India’s own democratic institutions.\n\nIn East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific:\n\nWe Believe:\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region is of vast importance to the United States. Asia contains the majority of the world’s population, and this region has the potential to drive world events both present and future. President Obama’s “pivot to Asia” was farsighted and ahead of its time. America must engage in Asia to safeguard both its values and its interests, and to confront emerging geo-strategic threats to the world order.\n\nWe Support:\n\nTrade relations with the countries of the Pacific Rim on the basis of rigorous labor rights, human rights, and environmental protections.\n\nOpen navigation in the South China Sea.\n\nUS commitment to the defense of Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.\n\nDiplomatic efforts for peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula.\n\nFreedom and democracy for the people of Burma/Myanmar.\n\nDemocratic self-determination for West Papua and Bougainville.\n\nVigorous competition with the “One Belt One Road” initiative, a neocolonial effort that seeks to bind the countries of Africa and Asia economically to China.\n\nDemocratic self-determination for Taiwan, East Turkestan, and Tibet.\n\nDemocracy and political freedom in Hong Kong, including the freedom of peaceful protest.\n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act of 2021, and the Export Controls on Advanced Computing and Semiconductor Manufacturing Items to the People’s Republic of China.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nAn economic relationship with the Pacific Rim on the basis of “race to the bottom” competition against the interests of labor conditions.\n\nNorth Korea’s nuclear program and its imprisonment of its population under a totalitarian regime.\n\nThe military dictatorship in Burma/Myanmar, and the genocide of the Rohingya people.\n\nDemocratic backsliding and human rights abuses in the Philippines.\n\nThe genocide of the Uighur people by China in East Turkestan, including the imprisonment of millions of people in concentration camps.\n\nThe continued Chinese occupation of Tibet.\n\nChina’s debt-trap diplomacy in Asia and Africa, and its tactical rewarding of corruption in the Global South, for the sake of exploiting natural resources at the expense of the long-term interests of the countries involved.\n\nThe large-scale construction by China of artificial islands in the South China Sea and of significant military installations upon them, in a marine region through which more than half of the world’s commercial shipping passes.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nWe Believe:\n\nThat the United States must continue to stand as a beacon of hope for those yearning for freedom and opportunity around the world. We are proud of America’s history and tradition as a nation of immigrants and believe it essential to our vitality and character that we maintain our openness and our welcoming spirit to those from every walk of life who come seeking the promise for which our country stands. Discrimination has no place in the laws of our country, especially in determining who is permitted to immigrate. Nevertheless, we believe secure borders and enforcement of labor laws are absolutely essential if the United States is ever again to have a functional immigration system. Liberal immigration policies bring benefits both economical and cultural, but we believe these benefits will not be enjoyed to their fullest without immigration policies that are more reliable, fair, and secure than in their present form.\n\nWe Support:\n\nHumanizing and dignifying immigration laws so that they reunite families and allow immigrants to seek work, a better life for their families, and a commitment to the United States.\n\nImmigration laws that are not discriminatory, including equal human rights for immigrants and a path to citizenship.\n\nTemporary legal status for undocumented higher education students through direct support of the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act.\n\nThe rights of undocumented immigrants to remain united with their families.\n\nIncreasing immigration quotas to bring them more in line with reality.\n\nA path to citizenship through service in the United States military and demand the immediate apology and the automatic granting of citizenship to those fellow veterans that have been deported from the United States of America solely based on their legal status of residency.\n\nCommon-sense immigration reform that includes provisions for foreign guest workers and an opportunity to bring the 11 million undocumented immigrants out of the shadows and into society, and immediate overhaul of our immigration.\n\nThe demilitarization of immigration enforcement and patrolling.\n\nThe rights of individuals to report crimes without facing criminal retribution for undocumented status.\n\nAny and all efforts of state and local officials to develop and create programs for immigrants who currently live within their communities to achieve citizenship through local government-sponsored programs that will help them meet the requirements to be a U.S. citizen with complete anonymity.\n\nThe de-privatization of immigration detention centers and the eventual eradication of such centers, such that these dehumanizing and demoralizing institutions cease to exist.\n\nAbolishing ICE (i.e. the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.).\n\nThe right for municipalities and states to declare “sanctuary” status without the fear of federal and state reprimands.\n\nThe creation of an amnesty program that allows undocumented people to live in the US, work in their communities, gain access to government programs and resources, and vote in elections while pursuing citizenship.\n\nLegal status for all undocumented immigrants in the United States.\n\nIncreasing funding for the processing and adjudication of asylum-seekers and undocumented immigrants without detention and surveillance.\n\nThe regulated and regular flow of traffic and commerce along the southern border.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nHuman Trafficking in all of its forms.\n\nImmigration laws directed at penalizing children.\n\nStates and municipalities unconstitutionally enacting their own immigration policies- particularly the permission of officers to behave like federal immigration agents. We oppose 287g contracts.\n\nAbuse and exploitation of undocumented workers.\n\nThe hiring exploitation of undocumented immigrants in order to avoid paying market wages and further burdening taxpayers with the cost of health care.\n\nPenalizing victims of human trafficking for unwilling participation in prostitution.\n\nThe continued use of the obsolete federal E-Verify program, which will offshore jobs, hurt the agricultural industry, and hurt American security.\n\nFamily separation at the border.\n\nAny effort to prevent people from seeking asylum at the border.\n\nAll minute men and private militias involvement with immigration.\n\nClosing and militarizing the Southern border and keeping out immigrants who seek entry into the United States and the unfair treatment of detained individuals.\n\nHOMELAND SECURITY\n\nWe Believe:\n\nThat the concept of homeland security extends beyond terrorism to include natural disasters, maintaining and improving critical infrastructure, and citizen education. Our government must fulfill its obligation to protect its citizens from foreign and domestic dangers while upholding the freedoms and ideals on which this nation was founded and on which it still stands.\n\nWe Support:\n\nFunding homeland security operations in states and localities in proportion to the risk that is faced therein.\n\nPolicies that take affirmative steps to ensure the safety of America’s public and infrastructure.\n\nRaising the level and quality of inspections at all points of entry into the United States, including commercial shipping ports.\n\nEnsuring adequate funding of and preparation for evacuations of populous areas in the event of an attack on the homeland or natural disaster.\n\nProperly funding, training, and equipping first responders to deal with large-scale emergencies.\n\nFull funding of the Army Corps of Engineers levee building programs to protect our citizens from natural disasters.\n\nIncreasing investments in programs and systems that protect public and private entities from threats to cybersecurity, foreign and domestic.\n\nThe use of diplomacy over war, especially when nuclear arms may be used.\n\nThe Iran Nuclear Deal.\n\nTorture or any acts that harm terrorist suspects or terrorists.\n\nGeneralizing groups of people as terrorists or as a threat to our society.\n\nLAW AND JUSTICE\n\nLaws are the foundation of an orderly society and abiding by them is often beneficial to all Americans and essential to the functioning of a civil society. However, laws are not inherently just purely by their nature of being laws. Legality and morality are not always synonymous, and what we know of the laws in our nation — whether past or present — is that they are not always congruent with what we know to be just. Therefore, we are committed to ensuring the United States is a nation of equity and justice, in laws and in lives. We also recognize that there are currently more people incarcerated in the United States than in any other nation in the world. We strive to create a society where laws are applied with consistency and equality, and with rehabilitation, not incarceration, as the primary focus. We support the expansion of restorative justice programs.\n\nWe believe in the importance of acknowledging the systemic and institutional racism beholden since the foundation of this nation, and seek to remove such explicit and implicit racism; inasmuch, we proclaim that black lives matter, and that the actions of police brutality disproportionately impact marginalized and underrepresented populations.\n\nWe Support\n\nPolice forces that use the least intrusive methods of investigation necessary to uphold the law.\n\nIncreased training of police and law enforcement officials, especially regarding mental illnesses with an emphasis on conflict de-escalation techniques and disabilities that affect communication.\n\nOur safety and law enforcement professionals and recognize their services to a safe and secure America.\n\nThe individual right of every law-abiding citizen to own and possess firearms, as established by the Second Amendment and upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nStrict background checks prior to any firearm purchase, including purchases at gun shows and mandatory waiting periods for all gun buyers.\n\nFirearm safety training prior to the first firearm purchase.\n\nCalling on the federal government to invest the necessary resources to accomplish instant background checks.\n\nThe legalization, regulation, and taxation of marijuana, in a manner similar to that of tobacco or alcohol. We also support prioritizing social justice by expunging any cannabis-related criminal records and helping those communities hit hardest by the so-called “War on Drugs.”.\n\nThe housing of juveniles convicted of criminal offenses separately from adults and the establishment of juvenile justice commissions that ensure that juveniles are neither unfairly prosecuted nor fall victim to corruption in the justice system.\n\nPrograms focusing on the rehabilitation of juvenile offenders rather than mere incarceration.\n\nLaws that ensure that all incarceration facilities are safe and clean.\n\nTreating enemy combatants held by the US Government in a manner consistent with international human rights standards.\n\nReforms in the sentencing procedure that allow greater judicial flexibility regarding sentences, alternative punishment, and community or victim redress, particularly for non-violent offenders.\n\nThe repeal of the portions of the Patriot Act that violate civil liberties and Fourth Amendment protections.\n\nThe reinstatement of voting rights for offenders who have completed the terms of their sentence, including parole or probation.

Additionally, we support fresh start legislation for one-time offenders of current marijuana laws who have been negatively impacted.\n\nThe de-privatization of Federal and state prisons.\n\nProviding mental health and other services at a local level so police officers are not the first call for non-law enforcement problems.\n\nVoting rights should never be revoked due to a criminal conviction.\n\nA minimum wage for those incarcerated in the prison system who engage in voluntary or mandatory labor. Laws that ensure all incarceration facilities are safe and clean and that allow inmates a meaningful opportunity to challenge human rights violations.\n\nComprehensive sentencing reform that allows greater judicial flexibility to allow for more lenient and non-punitive sentences, alternative punishment, and community or victim redress, particularly for non-violent offenders. We also support second-look legislation to reevaluate the length of sentences for people currently incarcerated.\n\nLegislation requiring affirmative consent, given by words or actions, to engage in sexual activity.\n\nExpansion of post-conviction remedies to prove innocence, including mandatory video recording of interrogations, access to DNA testing, strict regulation of jailhouse informant testimony, and adequate funding for indigent representation.\n\nCompensation for those wrongfully convicted.\n\nPolicies which allow for trained medical and/or mental health professionals to respond to emergency calls in certain situations, thereby both increasing community health standards and decreasing police response necessity to non-criminal emergency calls.\n\nBanning questions regarding arrests or convictions from individuals seeking employment and/or housing.\n\nA robust public defense system, ensuring that all Americans are provided a fair trial and sound representation in the judicial system.\n\nThe Stop Cop City Movement/ Oppose the building of the Atlanta Police Training Facility.\n\nDefunding the police, investing in research and funding for alternative crisis response systems, and investing in marginalized communities through social services and wraparound community services.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nAny statute that criminalizes assisted suicide by a medical professional.\n\nThe use of secret evidence being used in connection with any criminal proceedings.\n\nPolice brutality and corruption, and we support programs that prevent and punish such actions.\n\nThe use of national security to justify the widespread violation of constitutional rights in the United States and abroad.\n\nThe predatory nature of “Stand Your Ground” laws anywhere they are practiced and consider these laws to be a gross violation of human rights.\n\nPolicies that seek to circumvent gun control laws in the states that have more stringent rules and regulations on carrying weapons.\n\nA repressive bail system that forces individuals to spend time in jail simply because they cannot afford to pay bail. We oppose cash bail.\n\nExcessive legal financial obligations and interest rates.\n\nThe continued existence of “sundown towns” in the country, and we oppose any policies which allow for communities of state-sanctioned racial violence.\n\nSystemic racism in policing and incarceration. Black Americans are killed by police at the highest rates among all racial groups. Black Americans are incarcerated at the highest rates among all racial groups.\n\nCIVIL JUSTICE\n\nWe Believe:\n\nThat all Americans should have the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. We recognize, however, that systematic discrimination continues to plague our country.\n\nWe Support:\n\nLocal, state, and federal laws which promote justice for oppressed or disadvantaged people by prohibiting discrimination, based on race, socioeconomic status, gender, gender identity, age, religion, sexual orientation, ethnic background, national origin, or disability.\n\nAffirmative action programs which enable institutions to address systemic discrimination and inequity.\n\nThe safety and protection of sex workers.\n\nThe right to legal counsel in civil proceedings.\n\nCalling for the U.S. government to study and enforce means to provide reparations to African Americans.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nTort reform legislation that unduly burdens a citizen’s right to redress in the judicial system.\n\nThe use and promotion of disparaging mascots, symbols, logos, or other imagery.\n\nCIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nWe Believe:\n\nAll Americans deserve equal rights and equal treatment under the law. We are a pluralistic society where all people should be treated with respect and dignity.\n\nWe applaud the work of the Obama Administration and the United States Supreme Court in working to recognize that basic human rights should be attributed to all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression. We also understand that those protections do not go nearly far enough in protecting LGBTQ individuals.\n\nWe will fight for the continued development of legislation protecting Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender individuals in the areas of employment, housing, healthcare, education, marriage, and adoption, and will actively lobby our legislators to do the same.\n\nWe recognize the contributions of the Transgender Community to the gay rights movement and stand firmly behind transgender individuals. We will challenge people to respect all individuals, regardless of gender identity and expression. We will stand up for the protection of Transgender youth, both at home and in the classroom.\n\nWe are concerned about the rise of antisemitism and Islamophobia. We stand in solidarity with anyone facing oppression, and will fight to defend them. We oppose all forms of prejudice and bigotry.\n\nWe Support:\n\nUpholding the religious freedoms set forth in the First Amendment.\n\nPassage of legislation that acknowledges the fundamental injustice of slavery and establishes a commission to study slavery’s effect on U.S. society and the residual effects of slavery.\n\nExtension of official U.S. recognition of Native Hawaiian political rights similar to the status held by Native American and Alaska Native groups.\n\nEqual and compassionate treatment for those living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nProtection of LGBTQ Americans from discrimination, including the rejection of so-called “religious freedom” legislation; protection of marriage equality, as decided by the US Supreme Court in Obergefell v.

Also, whereas trans military personnel have been on the front lines of America’s fight against terrorism, we support trans individuals’ right to serve honorably in our nation’s armed forces.\n\nA Carcieri fix to allow more fee land be placed into trust.\n\nAn Oliphant fix allowing tribes full criminal jurisdiction within Indian country.\n\nAll rights reserved in treaties signed by the Tribes and the United States.\n\nResources to address the epidemic with murdered and missing indigenous women.\n\nElecting more Inidigious candidates to Congress.\n\nAccess to gender-affirming care.\n\nWe Oppose:\n\nAll efforts to align public policy around the tenets of any specific religion or to discriminate against elements of our citizenry based on religious doctrine.\n\nAll efforts to undermine the separation of church and state as it is essential to defending religious freedom for all Americans.\n\nThe use and promotion of disparaging mascots, symbols, logos, or other imagery.\n\nBanning non-heteronormative behavior in public settings.\n\nFAMILY\n\nWe Believe:\n\nOur society and government should treat all families equally, whether traditional or non-traditional, and support them to build stronger communities.\n\nWe Support:\n\nQuality childcare and preschool for every American child.\n\nAdoption and foster parenting laws that do not discriminate based on the attributes of sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status.\n\nDaycare programs for federal employees, and encourage all employers to create such programs for their employees.\n\nStrict sentencing for convicted domestic violence offenders.\n\nParental involvement in children’s education and development of life and social skills.\n\nCreating a culture that values balancing family time with work.\n\nThe value of faith as a driving principle behind our nation’s highest ideals such as kindness, family values, grace, self-sacrifice, and community service.\n\nFamily values that include moral principles that are guided by choices of fairness and tolerance. 9.

We believe in universal access to affordable, quality health care, reflecting patient preferences and sensitivities, and the fierce protection of the gains made in this area under President Obama.\n\nYDA supports Planned Parenthood and their efforts to provide high-quality, affordable reproductive healthcare through its health centers. With millions of individuals across the country receiving services, it is important to continue and expand federal and state funding for their efforts. No person facing one of the hardest decisions of their life should be without safe access to legal abortion services. All people deserve the right to access birth control, reproductive health care, other preventive care, sex education, methods to prevent sexual assault, and reliable and accurate information.\n\nWe Support:\n\nAn increased focus on preventative and clinical care.\n\nAn individual mandate for health insurance, with subsidies for those who have difficulty affording insurance.\n\nA government health plan to compete with private insurers and provide Americans with a low-cost option that increases competition in the markets producing better products and lower costs and that covers areas where private insurers have withdrawn from markets.\n\nMedicare 5.

We further believe that all contraceptive methods should be included in medical coverage with no copay required. We believe that reforms are necessary to protect the individual while ensuring that skilled medical professionals may continue to practice and maintain affordable malpractice insurance.\n\nThe Constitutional right of a woman to safe, legal, and accessible abortion. We believe that decisions regarding reproduction, contraception, and abortion are private decisions between a woman and her doctor.\n\nThe creation of a single-payer healthcare system that provides for adequately- funded, universal, affordable, competitive, quality healthcare for all Americans.

That climate change demands a massive-scale mobilization–a green new deal–to halt, reverse, and address its consequences and causes. That in order to achieve net-zero global emissions the United States must de-carbonize by 2030 due to the historically disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions emitted by our nation. That human activity is the primary cause of climate change over the last century. That a warming climate is causing sea levels to rise and an increase in wildfires, storms, droughts, and numerous extreme weather events that pose a threat to every aspect of our economy, society, communities, and infrastructure. That global warming at or above 2 degrees Celsius beyond pre-industrialized levels will cause mass migration, a massive loss in annual United States economic output, and a risk of extensive damage to public infrastructure and coastal real estate in the United States. That climate change is a direct threat to national security. That climate change and related, contributing activities have and will continue to disproportionately affect frontline communities, including but not limited to young people, indigenous peoples, people of color, lgbtq+ peoples, and the poor. Through tackling climate change we must ensure that clean air, clean water, and healthy food are basic human rights and that everyone who wants one has access to a good, livable-wage job. We further believe that increased environmental protections can be achieved in ways that create jobs and benefit all levels of the economy.\n\nWe Support:\n\nUnited States de-carbonization by 2030.\n\n100 percent of United States energy sourced from renewable and or zero-emissions power through a just transition for all communities and workers.\n\nThe creation of millions of good, livable-wage green jobs.\n\nUpgraded, energy-efficient buildings.\n\nUniversal access to clean water.\n\nThe decarbonization, repair, and overhaul of the nation’s infrastructure through investment in high-speed public rail and clean, affordable, and accessible public transit.\n\nJob training and economic development for a just transition for workers in frontline communities who will be most affected by climate change and the transition to a clean energy economy.\n\nBuilding energy-efficient power grids throughout the United States.\n\nDecarbonizing manufacturing and implementing regenerative agricultural practices.\n\nFunding massive investment in the drawdown and capture of greenhouse gases.\n\nRestoring and protecting threatened, endangered, and fragile ecosystems.\n\nCollaborative work with farmers and ranchers to remove greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector including the support of family farming and investment in land-use practices that increase soil health.\n\nPolicies that encourage the adoption of these goals to make the United States a leader in green technology, industry, and products to create exports that would assist transitions for other countries and benefit our economy.\n\nA just transition to a new, sustainable energy sector for regions of the country with economies dependent on fossil fuel extraction and production, including providing incentives for new sustainable energy producers to locate jobs in formerly fossil fuel-dependent communities, investment, and business development initiatives for communities impacted by a transition to sustainable energy, and the funding of education and career retraining initiatives for fossil fuel workforces.\n\nThe commitment to repair any and all antiquated tracts of infrastructure that are produced with lead-based materials, to ensure that these materials do not harm the health and well-being of the public trade.\n\nPolicies that promote energy independence and aggressively protect our natural resources, including our air, water, soil, forests, biodiversity, wetlands, and open spaces.\n\nPolicies designed to promote environmentally responsible business practices, such as tax incentives for green businesses, as well as aggressive enforcement of existing environmental statutes.\n\nReform of environmental statutes to make penalties for violation more costly than the expense of compliance.\n\nEfforts to promote environmental justice, including increased federal funding of Superfund programs and revitalization of brownfields.\n\nIncentives to encourage environmentally- sustainable farming practices including water conservation, methane capture, and land use that balances food and energy needs.\n\nPolicies that encourage domestic carbon sequestration through the establishment of strong carbon caps, detailed standards for verification of sequestration, and economic policies that reduce atmospheric carbon at a net economic benefit to the country.

That rural communities, which cover the overwhelming majority of our country’s landmass and serve as America’s breadbasket and powerhouse, hold an irreplaceable position in our cultural consciousness and shared history. As the party of working people, we support a policy agenda that preserves and maintains a vibrant rural way of life.\n\nWe Support:\n\nEfforts to encourage the development of small businesses that are positioned to serve the needs of rural communities.\n\nMeasures to protect the unique character of rural communities, including smart growth policies that preserve farmland and open space while expanding economic opportunity for community residents.\n\nMeasures to encourage community involvement in the development process to ensure it benefits the community in the best way possible.\n\nThe development of confidential medical services, including mental health, and urgent care in rural areas so that needed medical care is available as quickly as possible and to provide reproductive medical care as well as drug and alcohol treatment in establishing clinics.\n\nThe right of every law-abiding citizen to own guns for hunting and sport.\n\nExpanding broadband Internet access that does not interfere with licensed users of the radio spectrum, to bridge the digital divide, attracting young professionals to raise families, and business investment to create more economic opportunity.\n\nEfforts to encourage the development of arts and culture programs in rural communities.\n\nExpanding public transportation opportunities to rural communities.\n\nIncrease funding for advanced warning systems for natural disasters.\n\nIncrease access to VA facilities inclusive of mental health in rural areas.\n\nEducational tools for all students in rural communities.\n\nFederal funding to allow rural areas to sustain current emergency facilities, and to allow communities to expand access to care for residents for the purpose of safety and overall health.\n\nHealthcare legislation which considers, protects, and prioritizes the financial viability of rural hospitals and addresses the deleterious impact of Medicare’s presently inadequate reimbursement rate.
