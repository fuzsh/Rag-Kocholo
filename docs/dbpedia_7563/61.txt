About 15th Anniversary of Croatia's Membership in NATO

After establishing democracy over three decades ago, Croatia has, along with joining the European Union, identified membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as one of its strategic priorities in achieving national interests and establishing secure conditions for the continuous development and strengthening of the Croatian state and society.

After the victory over the aggressor and the defense of freedom and democracy in the Homeland War, Croatia embarked on its path towards this political-military and defense alliance as a key factor of peace and security in the Euro-Atlantic area and as a community of free and democratic states sharing the same values.
