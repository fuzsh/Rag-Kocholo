        "text": "Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has fundamentally changed the security environment in Europe. National and collective defence have become significantly more important once again. Germany’s security is indivisible from that of its allies. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is the key pillar for Euro-Atlantic security and the world’s most important security alliance.\n\nNATO’s Strategic Concept Collective defence, crisis prevention and management, and cooperative security\n\nNATO’s three core tasks are collective defence, crisis prevention and management, and cooperative security. They are anchored in the Alliance’s Strategic Concept 2022, which, after the North Atlantic Treaty, is the prime document the Alliance uses to define its policies, military capabilities and operational action.\n\nCollective defence lies at the heart of the Alliance and means that NATO members protect each other in the case of an external attack. It is also vital to deter potential attackers so that an attack is not carried out in the first place. To this end, NATO has nuclear, conventional and missile defence capabilities, which are backed up by space and cyber capabilities. These capabilities are defensive in nature, proportionate, and in line with NATO member countries’ international obligations.\n\nWithin the scope of crisis prevention and management, the NATO Allies strive to foster stability and conflict management. The aim is to prevent crises that could adversely affect Allies’ security and to respond to such crises. One example is the NATO Mission Iraq (NMI), in which the Alliance supports the Iraqi Government in furthering stability and improving security in the country."
