        "text": "NATO members gained another ally in March when Sweden overcame the last major hurdle toward NATO membership and became the alliance’s 32nd member country.\n\nSweden petitioned to join NATO nearly two years ago with Finland, but while the latter quickly gained NATO membership, Hungary and Turkey opposed Sweden’s admission. Turkey shifted its stance, throwing its support behind Sweden in July 2023, and Hungary’s parliament has now approved the application. This addition will reinforce the eastern region of the alliance and increase NATO’s presence around the Baltic Sea.\n\nHere are the other countries Sweden now calls an ally.\n\nWhat countries are in NATO?\n\nWith the addition of Sweden, there are 32 established member countries known as the NATO Allies. The full list includes:\n\nAlbania\n\nBelgium\n\nBulgaria\n\nCanada\n\nCroatia\n\nCzechia\n\nDenmark\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nHungary\n\nIceland\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMontenegro\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorth Macedonia\n\nNorway\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nRomania\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nTurkey\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited States\n\nWhy was NATO formed?\n\nAccording to NATO, the alliance was formed for three purposes: In response to threats from the Soviet Union, to forbid a nationalistic militarism revival \"in Europe with a strong North American presence on the continent, and to encourage European political integration.\"\n\nNATO spawned after World War II, the deadliest international conflict in history.\n\nUnlike the destruction caused during World War I, which was largely confined to battlefields, countries and cities were decimated across Europe. Estimated damages amounted to more than $1 trillion, according to Britannica.\n\nAs a result of this mass destruction, European nations required heavy aid to rebuild their economies. They largely looked to the U.S. to help in their recovery efforts because of its economic prosperity.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Marshall proposed a large-scale economic recovery program called the \"European Recovery Program,\" also known as the \"Marshall Plan.\" The Marshall Plan, enacted in 1948, intended to facilitate European economic integration and promote a shared idea of cooperation between Europe and the U.S. The program, which provided $15 billion in economic aid to Europe, was also meant to halt the spread of communism in Europe.\n\nThe Soviet Union was invited to join the Marshall Plan but refused. This added to the growing divide between Eastern and Western Europe and became a catalyst for the formation of NATO, according to History.com.\n\nIn April 1949, the 12 founding member countries signed the North Atlantic Treaty. These countries were:\n\nBelgium\n\nCanada\n\nDenmark\n\nFrance\n\nIceland\n\nItaly\n\nLuxembourg\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nPortugal\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited States\n\nWhat does NATO stand for?\n\nNATO stands for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It is a collective of member states that work toward shared political and military security through alliance.\n\nGraphics explain: How much do NATO allies really spend on defense?\n\nJust Curious for more?
