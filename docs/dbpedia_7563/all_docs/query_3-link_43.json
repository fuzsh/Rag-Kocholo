        "text": "EXERCISE 2 HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE VARIOUS EU COUNTRIES?\n\nImagine you work for a national tourist board. Choose the two EU countries that you know best and write a short text about them for tourists. For example, how many people live in these two countries and what are their capital cities? What do they have to offer to visitors (food, culture, language and so on)?\n\nThe EU treaties contain the rules that guide the work of the EU. They are amended from time to time, for example when new countries join or when there are changes to how the EU works. The most recent treaty is the Lisbon Treaty, which was signed in the Portuguese capital in 2007.\n\nFind out more about the EU treaties: europa.eu/!gy77mf\n\nThe Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union came into force with the Lisbon Treaty. It set out the rights and freedoms that all people living in the EU enjoy, such as personal, economic and social rights. To reflect modern society, the charter includes newer fundamental rights, such as data protection and guarantees on bioethics. It also includes specific provisions on the rights of under-18s, ensuring that childrenâsÂ rights are part of the human rights that the EU and its Member States are obliged to comply with and protect.\n\nFind out more about the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU: fra.europa.eu/en/eu-charter and the EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child: ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/rights-child_en\n\nHow did it all begin?\n\nAfter two destructive world wars in the first half of the twentieth century (1914â1918 and 1939â1945), people were determined that nothing like that should ever be allowed to happen again.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1950, some European politicians, including Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer, Alcide De Gasperi and Winston Churchill, began the process of creating the European Union we live in today. Their vision was to unite European countries economically and politically in order to secure lasting peace and prosperity.\n\nOn 9Â May 1950, Franceâs Foreign Minister, Robert Schuman, proposed merging European production of coal and steel. At the time, these were the raw materials used for warÂ â coal as an energy resource, and steel for weapons and machinery. By pooling their production, no one country could secretly arm itself against the others. Following this proposal, the European Coal and Steel Community came into being in 1952. It was founded by six neighbouring countriesÂ â Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the NetherlandsÂ â and laid the foundations for the EU we know today.\n\nNew members\n\nIn 1973, Denmark, Ireland and the United KingdomÂ (*) joined the European Economic Community. A few years later, with the end of right-wing dictatorships in southern Europe, three countries became eligible to apply for membership. The first of these was Greece, which joined in 1981. Portugal and Spain followed in 1986. In 1993, the European Union was created and Austria, Finland and Sweden joined 2Â years later. This brought the EUâs membership to 15.\n\nSoon after the Second World War, Europe was split into east and west by the âiron curtainâ as the 40-year-long Cold War began. The Berlin Wall was a symbol of this division as it split the city of Berlin in two. After the fall of communism in 1989, the formerly communist central and eastern European countries started a process of democratisation and applied to join the EU.\n\nIn 2004, eight countries from central and eastern Europe joined the EU: Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. In the same year, the Mediterranean islands of Cyprus and Malta also became members. In 2007, Bulgaria and Romania joined, followed by Croatia in 2013.\n\nThe addition of new EU members has expanded the common market and helped maintain peace and prosperity in Europe. Any new member must be prepared to sign up to the treaties and take on board the full body of EU law. It must respect the EUâs values, such as the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nBeyond its own borders, the EU also maintains strong relationships with neighbouring countries. The European neighbourhood policy supports the security, stability and prosperity of the countries to the immediate east and south of the EU. In addition, the EUâs enlargement policy covers potential new members. Beyond the âneighbourhoodâ region, the EUâs global relations are usually based on trade deals, partnerships and multilateral cooperation.\n\n(*)The United Kingdom left the EU in 2020.\n\nThe six founding countries are Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom joined the European Union on 1 January 1973, raising the number of Member States to nine. Greece joined in 1981, followed by Portugal and Spain in 1986. In 1995, Austria, Finland and Sweden joined the European Union. The biggest enlargement took place in 2004, when 10 countries joined the EU: Cyprus, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007, and Croatia was the last country to join the EU in 2013.\n\nEXERCISE 4 WHAT DOES THE EUROPEAN UNION MEAN TO YOU?\n\nAs we have seen, the European Unionâs origins date back to the early 1950s, when it was founded by people who had experienced the atrocities of one, or even two, world wars. These wars resulted in tens of millions of deaths across the continent. At the time, the ambition to unite countries and people that had so recently been in conflict was visionary.\n\nBy the time you and your friends were born, the EU had already enjoyed more than 50Â years of peace and prosperity, although you may have heard or read stories about difficult experiences in other parts of the world during this time. As young people, what do you think about this long-lasting peace in Europe? Do you take it for granted or do you sometimes worry about the future? Is democracy alone enough to guarantee peace? Discuss this with your classmates."
