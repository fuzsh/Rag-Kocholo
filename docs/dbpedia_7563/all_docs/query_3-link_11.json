Congratulations and welcome to our family, De Hoop Scheffer told reporters. The 26 NATO member states extended the invitation to Croatia at a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which was also attended by Croatian President Stjepan Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader. A membership invitation was also extended to Albania, while Macedonia's invitation was blocked by Greece over the former Yugoslav republic's name. NATO leaders authorised their ambassadors to extend a membership invitation to Macedonia as soon as the name dispute is settled (HINA)\n\nPress releases"
