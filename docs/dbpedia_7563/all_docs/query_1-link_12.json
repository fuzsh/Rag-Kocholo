        "text": "Weekly Briefing, Vol. 18, No. 1 (HR), May 2019\n\nCroatia marks 10 years of NATO membership\n\nSummary\n\nCroatia joined NATO in 2009, marking the achievement of one of its two strategic national objectives. The other one was membership in the EU. In 2019 Croatia marks a tenth year anniversary of membership in NATO. Its political and military leaders are in unison that NATO membership renders security and stability and thus Croatia is committed to the alliance.\n\nThe full-fledged support to NATO is not, however, to be found among all its members. After NATO lost its main adversary with the end of the cold war, the future of the alliance was seriously questioned. With new emerging threats, NATO is reinventing its purpose. US President Trump became the most vocal challenger of the alliance, questioning American commitment to trans-Atlantic security and demanding that NATO members increase burden sharing.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War, the continent where both world wars in the twentieth century started – Europe – was split between the East and the West. The two sides were dominated by two different ideologies – communism and democracy respectively, represented by two opposing countries – the United States and the Soviet Union. Except for a number of non-aligned countries, the world was split and dominated by these two super powers. Although they did not necessarily want a complete destruction of the other, the establishment of domination over the other side was clearly the goal of both United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Soviet military had advantage in manpower, tanks and armored vehicles after the Second World War. When the Soviets detonated their first nuclear weapon in 1949, Americans and western European politicians decided to strengthen their military cooperation to face the challenge the Soviet Union posed. NATO alliance (initially having twelve members) was created in 1949. The Warsaw Pact, a collective defense treaty among communist countries of Eastern Europe was created in 1955 as a reaction to NATO. The balance of power during the cold war guaranteed that any crises, some of which were quite serious, would not escalate into a new world war.\n\nThe Berlin Wall, a symbol of the cold war, collapsed in late 1989. Two years later, on December 26, 1991, after 70 years of existence, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Earlier that year, in the summer of 1991, the Warsaw Pact dissolved. The countries of the Warsaw Pact changed their political regimes and economic models – they replaced communism with democracy and state-run economy with market economy. The demise of the cold war and old ideological rivalries led to some authors claiming the end of history as all countries in the world would, sooner or later, chose liberal democracy and market economy as their preferred political and economic model.\n\nNATO found itself in a peculiar position. It lost its main rival and purpose of existence leading to questions if NATO was needed. However, new security threats led NATO to redefine its mission and discover new purpose for its existence.\n\nToday, in 2019, NATO consists of 29 member countries and it is dedicated to fight, among else, international terrorism and violence all around the world.\n\nCreation of the Croatian army\n\nHaving declared its independence from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1991, Croatia was attacked by the Yugoslav Peoples’ Army and paramilitary formations of Serbs in Croatia. At that time Croatia was organizationally and operationally influenced by the Soviet cold war doctrine, which requires large amounts of soldiers and equipment. NATO’s military doctrine was very different.\n\nSince independence in the early 1990s, Croatia’s political and military leadership had full consensus that they wanted the country to join the NATO alliance. To do so it was necessary to replace the existing Soviet-inspired military doctrine with the military doctrine of NATO.\n\nNATO doctrine requires smaller and more mobile armed forces that attack enemy lines from multiple directions. The performance of the Croatian armed forces was demonstrated in 1995, when they waged two decisive military operations – Bljesak (Flash) in May 1995 and Oluja (Strom) in August 1995, which effectively ended the war in Croatia.\n\nTherefore, one can safely say that the Croatian army was created in the process of defending the country. Today, Croatian army is a small, modern and effective military force with recent combat experience, which makes it quite unique among NATO members.\n\nPost-war reforms of armed forces\n\nThe coalition government led by social democrats took office in 2000. This government started a reform of armed forces whose main goal was to further align Croatian army with NATO standards and prepare it for NATO membership. The number of troops were drastically reduced, followed by acceleration of other reforms.\n\nIn 2000, Croatia joined Partnership for Peace, marking the beginning of the formal relationship between Croatia and NATO. Initial reforms that began during the mandates of defense ministers Jozo Radoš and Željka Antunović, focused on military staff training, the supply of new military equipment and improving accommodation (military bases) for soldiers.\n\nThe new government took over in 2003, reiterating commitment to NATO. The goal of membership remained and thus modernization and professionalization of the armed forces, aligned with NATO standards, continued. The reforms led to a decision to abolish a mandatory military service in Croatia for young men. Croatia today has a professional army in which both men and women serve.\n\nBy the end of 2008, most NATO members have ratified the Protocol on the Accession of the Republic of Croatia to NATO alliance. One stumbling block was a border dispute between Slovenia and Croatia or more precisely, the maritime demarcation in the Bay of Piran which the two countries share. Slovenia threatened to block Croatia’s negotiations with NATO, but this was eventually avoided. At 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, Croatia was officially invited to join the alliance.\n\nDespite a full political and military leadership consensus on joining NATO, not all Croatian citizens necessarily supported this goal. Several civil society organizations asked for consultations with citizens and even announced a referendum on joining NATO. However, the Croatian government refused to hold a referendum, arguing that NATO membership did not result in a loss of sovereignty and that security, political and even economic benefits of NATO membership prevailed over any negative consequences.\n\nCroatia and NATO\n\nCroatia joined NATO on April 1, 2009 together with Albania. North Macedonia (FYROM or simply Macedonia at the time), was also invited to NATO, but due to Greek blockade did not join the alliance. It is expected that it will become the 30th member after the historical agreement, reached by Greek and Macedonian prime ministers Tsipras and Zaev in 2018, was ratified in the parliaments of both countries by early 2019. The agreement on the name change removed a decade-long blockade on Macedonian accession to NATO and the EU. Croatia actively participates in all discussions regarding NATO future, including its enlargement. In that sense, the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (MFEA) on its website states that NATO enlargement in Southeast Europe is one of key Croatian objectives.\n\nMFEA also underlines Croatia’s participation in NATO missions. It contributed to NATO mission in Afghanistan even before it officially joined NATO. With specific experience of a country that faced invasion, insurrection and rebellion, it believes its contribution to training Afghan troops and police is valuable. At present (2019), it has 300 soldiers deployed under German command. Croatian military police participates in NATO mission to Kosovo. MFEA also lists NATO mission to Libya as the one in which Croatia participated. Currently, Croatian troops are also deployed in Lithuania and Poland in an operation called Forward Presence.\n\nModernization of the Croatian military (army, navy and air force) is conducted in line with NATO standards. It has acquired some of the most modern weapon systems with the help of other NATO members, most notably Germany and the United States. Some of the new weapons include 200 new PATRIA armored vehicles (Finland), 16 Pzh 2000 self-propelled artillery system (Germany), 200 mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles (USA), 16 Kiowa helicopters (USA), two Helsinki-class patrol crafts (Finland), 10.000 VHS (Croatian made assault rifle) and in the near future twelve new fighter jets (possibly F-16) will be acquired for the Croatian air force.\n\nThe decision to purchase new fighter jets came after years of deliberation, since it is a no small matter for Croatia to financially commit to purchase new jets. Weighing between Swedish Grippens and US F-16s, the government decided in 2018 to purchase Israeli upgraded F-16s. However, this decision had to be cancelled once it was revealed that Israel was not allowed to sell altered US-made jets. For the time being (2019), jets procurement is on hold, but Croatian Ministry of Defense assures public that modernization of air force will happen in near future.\n\nCroatia’s commitment to the EU may be strong, but it seems that Croatia’s NATO commitment is even stronger. Although Croatia takes part in discussions on European defense, it gives priority to NATO and does not prioritize the creation of the European Army.\n\nFuture and Conclusion\n\nA decade of NATO membership helped Croatia build a modern, well-equipped military which employs well-trained military personnel.\n\nAlthough mandatory military service was abolished in 2007 due to NATO’s need to increase conventional forces, Croatia considers re-introducing mandatory military service as the current number of 12.000 troops is by no means sufficient.\n\nThe acquisition of new fighter jets is currently on hold, but the government confirms that they will be purchased because supersonic fighter jets will be the most powerful weapon that Croatia will have in its arsenal. Since the decision to purchase them was already made, the government plans to implement the decision."
