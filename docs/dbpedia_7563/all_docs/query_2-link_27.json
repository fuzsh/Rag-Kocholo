Furthermore, there will be discussion on the implementation of earlier decisions related to strengthening NATO’s deterrence and defence, and as at all NATO summits, there will be discussion on the contribution of member states to the Alliance for defence purposes.\n\nIn the scope of the summit, there will be a regular meeting of members and partner states from Asia and the Pacific (Japan, Australia, Republic of Korea and New Zealand) as well as representatives of the European Union. This will be the last summit for the current Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg as he will be replaced on 1 October this year by former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.\n\nOn Tuesday, 9 July, the first day of the summit, a festive programme will mark 75 years of the existence of NATO, whose foundation was launched in Washington, D.C. on 4 April 1949. Croatia joined NATO in 2009 and marked 15 years of membership this year.\n\nDuring his stay in Washington D.C., President Milanović will meet with Croatian emigrants at a reception in the Embassy of the Republic of Croatia in Washington, D.C."
