        "text": "NATO’s primary purpose is to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its members through political and military means, and to guarantee the freedom and security of all member countries.\n\nIn 1949, twelve states acceded to the North Atlantic Treaty: two in North America and ten in Europe. NATO was established in 1951 as a permanent organisational application of the North Atlantic Treaty. The North Atlantic Treaty, also referred to as the Washington Treaty, is NATO’s founding document.\n\nAt the heart of the North Atlantic Treaty is the collective defence of the member countries, which means that the Alliance’s member countries have mutual defence obligations towards each other and engage in collective defence planning. This collective defence is based on the right to individual and collective self-defence that every country has in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n\nPrinciples and articles of the North Atlantic Treaty\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty also contains other principles that the member countries undertake to follow, such as the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and the desire to live in peace with all peoples and governments. The Treaty also declares its Parties’ determination to secure the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of their peoples, which are based on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law. The Parties seek stability and well-being in the North-Atlantic area.\n\nIn Articles 1 and 2 of the Treaty, the Parties undertake, as set out in the Charter of the United Nations, to settle any international disputes by peaceful means and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. The Parties will contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly international relations. They will seek to eliminate conflicts in their international economic policies and will encourage economic collaboration.\n\nIn Article 3, the Parties under take to, separately and jointly, by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.\n\nArticle 4 stipulates that the Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or Article 5 sets out the collective defence obligations that are the core of NATO’s collective defence. Under the Article, an armed attack against one or more of the Parties in Europe or North America will be considered an attack against them all.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty consists of 14 articles and can be read in the Government bill on Sweden’s NATO membership (Govt. Bill 2022/23:74).\n\nNATO’s work and organisation\n\nNATO is an intergovernmental organisation with both a political and a military dimension. NATO’s core tasks consist of deterrence and collective defence, civilian and military crisis prevention and management and security cooperation.\n\nNATO’s member countries have undertaken to cooperate on these three core tasks so as to resolve security challenges, build trust and prevent conflicts. If diplomatic efforts for peace are inadequate or fail to achieve the desired effect, NATO can carry out crisis management operations.\n\nAll decisions in NATO are taken by consensus, which means all NATO member countries must agree unanimously to take decisions.\n\nThe North Atlantic Council is NATO’s highest decision-making political body\n\nNATO’s highest decision-making body is the North Atlantic Council. For Council’s ordinary business, the member countries are represented by their Ambassadors to NATO. The Council meets several times a year, with meetings of defence ministers, foreign ministers and heads of government or states. Normally, one NATO Summit, two Meetings of NATO Ministers of Foreign Affairs and three Meetings of NATO Defence Ministers are held each year. The Secretary General is the Alliance’s top international civil servant and Chair of the Nordic Council.\n\nSeveral bodies and committees have been established under the Council.\n\nNATO has a special Nuclear Planning Group that is responsible for its nuclear policy.\n\nThe Resilience Committee is the senior NATO advisory body for resilience and civil preparedness. The Committee is responsible for strategic and policy direction, planning guidance, and general coordination of resilience activities at NATO.\n\nNATO’s organisational structure\n\nThe Military Committee is the senior military authority in NATO\n\nThe Military Committee is an essential link between the political decision-making process and the military structure. It is responsible for military planning, advising the Council on military matters and translating Council decisions into military planning. The Military Committee also gives direction to the Supreme Allied Commander (SACEUR), NATO’s top military officer.\n\nThe Committee answers directly to the North Atlantic Council and is made up of senior military officers from NATO member countries. For ordinary business, the member countries are represented in the Committee by military representatives.\n\nThe responsibilities of the military leadership structure, from the strategic level down to the higher tactical level, include NATO capacity planning, operational planning and generating forces. NATO’s two strategic military headquarters, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) and Allied Command Transformation (ACT), are located in Mons, Belgium and Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nNATO does not have its own military forces. The member countries contribute forces for readiness or operations at the request of SACEUR and following necessary political decisions in the relevant member country.\n\nNATO headquarters in Brussels\n\nNATO headquarters is located in Brussels. International civilian and military personnel work there. NATO headquarters is the Alliance’s top political and administrative centre and the seat of the North Atlantic Council. All member countries have a permanent representation at NATO headquarters."
