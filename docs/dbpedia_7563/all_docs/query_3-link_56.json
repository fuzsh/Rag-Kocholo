        "text": "This report is a part of #CCPinCEE, a series of reports published by the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) analyzing Chinese influence efforts and operations across the nations of Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nGoals and objectives of CCP malign influence\n\nSince Croatia and China established diplomatic relations in 1992, the two governments have organized several meetings to establish stronger economic and cultural ties. China’s overall presence in Croatia, particularly its malign influence, is limited compared with some other CEE countries as well as Western Balkan countries. There has been nothing in the public record indicating China has attempted to discredit Croatia’s electoral system or influence its domestic and international policy.\n\nThe relationship between the two countries focuses on economic cooperation, which has intensified since 2017. In June 2017, Croatia obtained $394 m from the European Commission to build the Pelješac Bridge in the south of Croatia, which amounted to 85% of the construction cost. In January 2018, the construction contract was awarded to China’s state-owned China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) for $340 m. Media reports said the Chinese company bested its competitors by committing to complete the project faster and for less money. The bridge was of special interest to China, as it would give reference to Chinese companies for further bids for EU-funded infrastructure projects. Siniša Malus, head of communications of the Chinese Southeast European Business Association, said the project was a way for China to enter the European market.\n\nThere are some other relevant investments and proposed projects, such as a potential bridge to connect the island of Pašman, near Zadar, with mainland Croatia. The project would also indirectly connect the island of Ugljan, which is linked with Pašman via a short bridge, to the mainland. Croatia hopes to receive EU funds for the project, but if that fails, a public-private partnership is an option. CRBC has offered to help fund the project and hopes to stay in the Balkans, avoiding having to ship its equipment and workers back to China.\n\nIn late December 2021, the Croatian government and the city of Rijeka signed a contract for the construction of a wastewater treatment plant. The work will be carried out by the China Energy Engineering Group Jiangsu Power Design Institute and Sumec Complete Equipment and Engineering. The cost of the project, a bit more than $7 m, is 71% co-financed with EU funds.\n\nIn 2019, Norinco, a Chinese company, acquired 76% of the Croatian Energija Projekt company for $35 m, allowing it to build and operate the Senj wind farm for 23 years and presenting China as an actor in the green transition. Work on the wind farm started in July 2019 and finished in December 2021. At an estimated cost of $253 m, it is the first large greenfield investment by China. At a ceremony testing the operation of the wind farm, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković said the project reflects his country’s good relations with China and demonstrates Croatia’s commitment to meeting its goals of climate neutrality by 2050.\n\nAdditionally, in 2018, a company backed by Chinese investors obtained a 76% stake in Zadar port in central Dalmatia. Another Chinese consortium was interested in the port of Rijeka, but in early 2021, Croatia annulled a tender in which that group of companies had made the lowest bid, apparently under pressure from the US and the EU.\n\nApart from energy and infrastructure projects, Chinese investors have shown interest in tourism and technologically innovative companies, such as electric-car maker Rimac Automobili, in which the Chinese Camel Group invested $33 m in 2017. The following year, the two companies opened a factory in China that produces components for electric cars and buses for China’s market. The joint venture cost $158 m, of which Rimac Automobili put in $5.5 m, while its partner bears the remaining cost. Rimac Automobili gets 40% ownership of the factory.\n\nThe main platforms for cooperation are annual study visits for Croatian journalists, which have been suspended since COVID-19 struck. Academic, business, and expert exchanges have also taken place, but were put on hold during the pandemic.\n\nSince a Confucius Institute was established at the University of Zagreb in May 2012, its free language courses have grown increasingly popular, with enrollment hitting about 2,000 In 2019. The institute supports the university’s Sinology Department, which was established in 2004. Since 2021, the Confucius Institute has focused on tourism, creative industries, and digital transformation.\n\nIn May 2013, China and Croatia signed a three-year agreement to organize student exchanges and offer yearly scholarships to Chinese and Croatian students, with the Chinese side granting tuition for various educational fields. China pledged 200 government-funded scholarships from 2013 to 2018 to promote youth exchanges and educational cooperation between the two countries.\n\nFurthermore, to mark the Chinese New Year in 2016, Zagreb’s main square hosted 80 terracotta warrior sculptures, inspired by the famous Terracotta Army (or the Terracotta Warriors and Horses) discovered in the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. The Croatian president, prime minister, mayor of Zagreb, and other dignitaries attended the New Year celebration, where students at the university’s Confucius Institute performed the dragon dance. Several months later, the institute organized the first Dragon Boat Festival, also known as the Duanwu Festival, on Jarun lake in Zagreb. The now-annual festival includes activities such as a boat race, kite making, paper cutting, and calligraphy.\n\nSources: The World Factbook 2022, (Washington, DC: Central Intelligence Agency, 2020), https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/; World Bank, The World Bank Group, 2022, https://www.worldbank.org/en/home; “Interparliamentary Friendship Group Croatia – China,” Croatian Parliament, retrieved June 27, 2022, https://www.sabor.hr/en/parliamentary-friendship-groups-membership/interparliamentary-friendship-group-croatia-china-10-term\n\nReach of influence measures\n\nFormal institutional cooperation between Croatian and Chinese media organizations is minimal. The Croatian News Agency (Hrvatska izvještajna novinska agencija, or HINA) exchanges news with the Xinhua agency. Media stories on Chinese projects are positive or neutral, strictly relating facts. Analytical pieces on China’s activities or general presence in Croatia are rare, and the public seems to have little interest in these topics. Chinese commercial advertising, with the exception of Huawei, is also minimal.\n\nChinese influence in Croatia is primarily focused on high-ranking officials in government. Chinese diplomats regularly meet with ministers, mayors, and MEPs. Also of interest are former high-ranking officials and relevant figures from business, sports, and academia.\n\nIn June 2022, the Chinese ambassador to Croatia gave a long interview to the Voice of People’s Diplomacy magazine marking 30 years of relations between China and Croatia. He underlined mutual trust and respect, and both countries’ wish for closer friendship and cooperation.\n\nIn April 2019, China’s prime minister, Li Keqiang, visited Croatia with a 250-strong delegation as part of a summit of the 16/17 +1 initiative. Li met with the Croatian prime minister, the president, the speaker of the parliament, and other officials and signed six agreements related to railways, agriculture, digital technology, and tourism. The two sides signed a memorandum of understanding on investments; Huawei Croatia signed a memorandum to encourage cooperation in digitization, and China and Croatia signed a memorandum on cooperation in sports. Since 2019, Huawei has sponsored the Seeds for the Future program in cooperation with Croatia’s Central State Office for the Development of the Digital Society. The program was meant to include annual study trips to China for Croatian students, but because of the pandemic, the only trip so far was in 2019. In three years, 36 Croatian IT students have gone through Seeds for the Future.\n\nIn November 2018, the Croatian National Tourist Board opened an office in Shanghai, barely two months before officials proclaimed 2019 the year of Croatian-Chinese culture and tourism.\n\nDuring the 16/17+1 summit, which Croatia hosted in the city of Dubrovnik, participating countries adopted “The Dubrovnik Guidelines for Cooperation between China and CEE Countries.”\n\nPhoto: Chinese President Xi Jinping (2nd L) speaks during a meeting with Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic (R) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, October 14, 2015.

Cooperation has focused on economic relations, taking into account the significant power asymmetry between the two countries. As a member of the EU, however, Croatia must align its foreign policy with the European foreign and security policy. If European and broader Western relations with China continue to strain, this dynamic will be also reflected in Croatia’s position toward China."
