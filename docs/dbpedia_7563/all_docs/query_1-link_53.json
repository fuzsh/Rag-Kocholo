        "text": "In the midst of the Ukraine crisis comes a surprise military maneuver — a Croatian confusion operation.\n\nPresident Zoran Milanović made headlines Tuesday when he declared the country would withdraw its troops from NATO forces in Eastern Europe if there’s an escalation of tensions with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nBut Milanović, a former leader of the country’s social democrats, was then contradicted by Foreign Minister Gordan Grlić-Radman of the country’s center-right government.\n\nAnd it soon emerged that Croatia’s forces in Poland had already returned home earlier this week at the end of a routine deployment — as documented on the website of the Croatian defense ministry.\n\nThe NATO battle group in Poland tweeted a few days ago that it would “soon” welcome a new Croatian contingent. But Croatian newspaper Jutarnji List then reported that the country was not scheduled to send a new unit this year — so there would be no forces to withdraw if there’s a Russian invasion of Ukraine in the coming weeks or months.\n\nMilanović has an acrimonious relationship with the center-right government of Prime Minister Andrej Plenković and has clashed repeatedly with its members.\n\nMilanović’s comments also caused confusion because, although the president serves as commander in chief of the Croatian military, NATO deployments are handled by the defense ministry, with the approval of parliament.\n\nAccording to several local media reports, Milanović declared on a visit to a confectionery factory that Croatia would not be involved in the crisis between Russia and Ukraine. “Croatia will not send any troops in case of an escalation. On the contrary, it will recall all troops, to the last Croatian soldier,” he said.\n\n“All that is happening in the antechamber of Russia,” Milanović also said. “One must reach a deal that will take account of the security interests of Russia,” he added.\n\nHe said there are other ways to preserve Ukraine in “its entirety or 99 percent of its territory” and “to help it economically.”\n\nBut Grlić-Radman, the foreign minister, said Milanović’s comments had nothing to do with the government’s position. He told a reporter for Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that “the president does not speak for Croatia, but for himself. We are and will remain a loyal member of NATO. Everything we do, we do in consultation with our partners.”\n\n“In times like these, it is particularly important to show solidarity among partners, and Croatia will do so in the EU and in NATO,” he added.\n\nUna Hajdari contributed reporting."
