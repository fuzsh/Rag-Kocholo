Cyril & Methodius and St. Raphael, where the first Croatian parish on the U.S. East Coast was founded in 1913.\n\nJandroković told those present that Croatians in the U.S., as well as elsewhere abroad, were a bridge between Croatia and the world playing an important role in promoting Croatian traditions, heritage, and culture. He said he was especially glad that the Croatian community in the U.S. had managed to integrate Croatian identity into the broad spectrum of American cultural diversity.\n\nOn Monday, Jandroković is scheduled to meet with New York City Mayor Eric Adams."
