        "text": "Profile\n\nWilliam IV (21 August 1765 - 20 June 1837) was the third son of King George III and Queen Charlotte. He was made Duke of Clarence in 1789 and became King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and King of Hanover on the death of his brother George IV on 26 June 1830.\n\nThe Sailor King\n\nPrince William Henry was born at Buckingham House on 21 August 1765, the third son of King George III and Queen Charlotte.\n\nAs the third son, he never expected to become King, and at the age of 13, he embarked on a career in the navy. On 14 June 1779, William joined HMS Prince George as a midshipman under Admiral Digby. Henry Majendie, later Bishop of Chester, was appointed William's preceptor, to instruct and supervise him while at sea.\n\nWilliam worked up through the ranks to take command of his own ship, HMS Pegasus, in 1786. He served under Lord Nelson in the West Indies and the two became great friends. He was promoted to Rear-Admiral in charge of HMS Valiant in 1789, but retired from active service the following year.\n\nHe was made an Admiral in 1798, but the rank was in name only, as was the title of Admiral of the Fleet, which he was granted in 1811.\n\nClarence House, which stands beside St James’s Palace, was built for William between 1825 and 1827, to the designs of John Nash. The interior of the house was plainly decorated and the final costs were around £22,000. William continued to live here rather than at Buckingham Palace after he became King.\n\nThe reign of William IV (1830-1837)\n\nWilliam had not expected to inherit the throne, but both his older brothers died before him without legitimate, living issue. Princess Charlotte, George IV’s only child, died in 1817, and then Frederick, Duke of York, died, childless, in 1827, leaving William heir to the throne.\n\nWilliam became King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and King of Hanover on 26 June 1830 at the age of 64, on the death of his brother George IV.\n\nFrugality\n\nWilliam was much more frugal than his brother George IV had been and this gained him popularity. He insisted on a coronation that cost a tenth of what his brother’s had cost.\n\nPolitical reform\n\nThe reign of William IV saw great political reform. The general election of 1831 led to the formation of a Whig government under Lord Grey who was committed to the extension of the franchise. Against considerable opposition in the House of Lords, the First Reform Act was passed in 1832, increasing the number of people who could vote and redistributing Parliamentary seats more equitably.\n\nAbolition of slavery and other social reforms\n\nIn 1833, after years of campaigning from William Wilberforce and others, slavery was abolished throughout the British Empire. Other laws were passed prohibiting young children from working in factories and establishing workhouses for the poor. In 1836, compulsory registration of births, marriages and deaths was introduced.\n\nDeath\n\nWilliam died at Windsor Castle on 20 June 1837 without surviving legitimate children. He was succeeded on the throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland by his niece, Victoria, and by his brother Ernest, Duke of Cumberland, as King of Hanover.\n\nRachel Knowles writes faith-based Regency romance and historical non-fiction.
