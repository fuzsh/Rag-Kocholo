Of those 11, just three have been men—Prince George (married to Queen Anne), Prince Albert (married to Queen Victoria), and Prince Philip (married to Queen Elizabeth II). The titles of the male consorts have been inconsistent over the years; George was the Duke of Cumberland, Prince Albert was \"Prince Consort,\" and Prince Philip was the Duke of Edinburgh. However, for the eight women, they are automatically styled as Queen, and given the title Queen Consort.\n\nBefore the United Kingdom, there were Scottish royal consorts, English royal consorts, and Irish royal consorts, but for our purposes, we will focus on those who have been queen consort since the union of England and Scotland in 1707, and therefore queen consort of the United Kingdom."
