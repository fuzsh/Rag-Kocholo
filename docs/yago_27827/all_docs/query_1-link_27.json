        "text": "Ancestors\n\nProfile last modified 16 Jan 2021 | Created 22 Mar 2014\n\nThis page has been accessed 3,527 times.\n\nBiography\n\nFather George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen\n\nMother Princess Louise Eleonore of Hohenlohe-Langenburg\n\nAdelaide was born at Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany. She was baptized Adelaide Amelia Louise Theresa Caroline. Her father George I was Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, a small state of 423 square miles. Her mother was Princess Louise Eleonore of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. [1]\n\nIn 1817, upon the death of the only child of the English Prince Regent and Princess Caroline, the line of succession to the English throne was in doubt, so all the unwed younger sons of George 3rd were urged to marry.[2]\n\nOn July 11, 1818, William Henry, Duke of Clarence, 53, was married to Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, who was almost twenty-six and had only met William about 9 days before.[3] The marriage was arranged as an attempt to continue the House of Hannover. Although Adelaide may not have been William's first choice, the marriage was by all accounts a good one. She was amiable, quiet, and much loved by both the public and William.[4] However, the marriage failed to provide an heir to the throne. Daughter Charlotte died in infancy, she miscarried, daughter Elizabeth died in infancy, and twins were stillborn.[5]\n\nEventually, Victoria, the Queen's favorite, was acknowledged by the royal couple to be their presumptive heir. On Sept. 8, 1831, William was crowned king and Adelaide queen. The King despised the whole ceremony, mocking its entirety. Queen Adelaide, meanwhile, earned the praise and adulation of everyone around for her \"dignity, repose and characteristic grace.\" William's reign was short. He died in 1837 and was replaced by his niece Victoria, who would remain on the throne until 1901.[6]Adelaide died during the reign of her niece Queen Victoria on 2 December 1849[7] of natural causes at Bentley Priory in Middlesex and was buried at St. George's Chapel, Windsor. [8]\n\nNotes\n\nThe city of Adelaide, Australia, is named after the queen. In 1836 the first settlers arrived in South Australia and the new Governor, Captain John Hindmarsh, requested permission to name the new city after King William. The King suggested it be named “Adelaide” after his Queen. The main street, however, was named King William Street in his honour. Had the king not insisted the city of Adelaide might have been called Wellington after the Duke of Wellington who assisted the passage of the South Australian Colonisation Act of 1834 through the British parliament.[9]\n\nAlmost all the European royal families were inter-related and Adelaide and William, were no different. Apart from being husband and wife, they were also third cousins, once removed via Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha and Altenburg, and his wife, Elisabeth Sophie, Duchess of Saxe-Altenburg.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Remembering_Queen_Adelaide\n\n↑ \"Who was Queen Adelaide?\" The Queen Adelaide Society.\n\n↑ Williamson, D.
