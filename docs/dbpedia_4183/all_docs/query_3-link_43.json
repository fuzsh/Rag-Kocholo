        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nSouth Africa has the highest burden of HIV infection in the world (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2019), with 7.7 million individuals living with HIV (UNAIDS, 2019), including one in four women of childbearing age and an estimated 260,000 children (UNAIDS, 2019). Over the past decade, the scale-up of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) has decreased the vertical transmission rate to 0.9% (Republic of South Africa Department of Health, 2018), resulting in over 3.2 million children in South Africa who were perinatally exposed to HIV, but not infected (UNAIDS, 2018). It is known that children living with HIV (CLHIV) face significantly increased rates of mortality, morbidity, and neurocognitive and physical disabilities (Wachsler-Felder & Golden, 2002; Van Rie et al., 2007; Phillips et al., 2016). However, less is known about the health and developmental outcomes of children who are perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (CHEU). A number of recent studies have suggested that CHEU may be more likely to experience delay or disability in neurocognitive or language development compared to children who are HIV-unexposed and uninfected (CHUU) (McHenry et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018; le Roux et al., 2018, 2019; Wedderburn et al., 2019; Mukherjee et al., 2019). However, conflicting evidence from methodologically similar studies indicates that developmental scores among CHEU do not differ from those of CHUU (McHenry et al., 2019; Springer et al., 2018, 2019; Boivin et al., 2018; Desmonde et al., 2016). Many of the studies to date have been limited by small sample size, differing recruitment and eligibility criteria for the CHEU, CHUU and CLHIV groups, and/or lack of adjustment for potentially confounding variables, such as household food insecurity or lower education. Recent systematic reviews have called for further studies to address this issue (McHenry et al., 2018; Desmonde et al., 2018).\n\nFor global and national health systems to support the optimal health of children in the future, especially in regions with high HIV prevalence, it will be essential to better understand the unique health and developmental trajectories of CHEU (Siberry, 2018). The objective of the current study is to assess the neurodevelopment of CHEU in a peri-rural community in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa in relation to CHUU and CLHIV drawn from the same population-based sample, while accounting for a battery of potential confounding factors. This study compares cognitive and language developmental outcomes using multiple validated measures between CHEU, CHUU and CLHIV at ages 4–6 years in peri-urban communities in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, one of the regions most heavily impacted by HIV in the world (Kharsany et al., 2018).\n\nMETHODS\n\nStudy population, setting and data collection\n\nWe conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Asenze cohort study, a population-based study based in five resource-poor peri-urban communities in Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa. All children aged 4–6 years living in the study area were eligible to participate along with their primary caregiver. Using door-to-door recruitment, 88% of eligible families were enrolled; of those, 87% (n=1581 child-caregiver pairs) completed a clinical assessment visit in 2008–2010. At the assessment visit, experienced bilingual mid-level psychological assessors administered cognitive and language measures to children in their native language, isiZulu, and rapid HIV testing was offered for children and caregivers. Children completed a comprehensive medical assessment. Caregivers provided demographic and health information about the participating child, caregiver and household. The present analysis uses data from this initial study visit. Detailed information on Asenze cohort study methods has been published previously (Ajayi et al., 2017a, 2017b; Knox et al., 2018; Uwedimo et al., 2014; Chhagan et al., 2011).\n\nOur analysis included children whose birth mother was their primary caregiver (67%). We excluded those with a non-maternal primary caregiver since maternal HIV status was often not known reliably in those cases. Though maternal HIV status could be inferred for four- to six-year-old CLHIV, we also excluded the 20 CLHIV with a non-maternal primary caregiver in order to ensure comparability of the CHEU, CHUU and CLHIV groups. We also excluded any other children for whom HIV status was unavailable for either the child, mother, or both. The final sample included 922 mother-child pairs with complete HIV data. Informed consent was obtained from the caregiver for all child-caregiver pairs. This study was approved by the University of KwaZulu-Natal Biomedical Research Ethics Committee and the Columbia University Institutional Review Board.\n\nCognitive development measures\n\nThe Grover-Counter Scale of Cognitive Development (GCS) was used to assess child cognitive function. This measure was developed and validated for use in South Africa. Intended for children ages 3–10 years, it requires minimal verbal interaction, as it is designed to measure cognitive function even among children with expressive or receptive language impairment. Validation studies have confirmed construct validity of the GCS, finding that it is highly correlated with established screens for cognitive development (Grover & Sebate, 2000).\n\nSubscales from the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (KABC-II) were used to measure specific aspects of cognitive function, including conceptual thinking, working memory (the Hand Movement test) and learning (the Atlantis subscale). The KABC-II is designed for children ages 3–18. It was chosen for its demonstrated reliability and cross-cultural functionality, including use in other African countries and pilot testing results of the isiZulu language version in South Africa (Kaufman & Kaufman, 2004; Ajayi et al. 2017a; Debeaudrap et al., 2018; Boivin et al., 2018, 2019).\n\nThe Reynell Developmental Language Scales (RDLS) Third Edition consists of two subscales measuring verbal comprehension and expressive language abilities in children ages 18 months to 7 years (Edwards et al., 1997). It has been widely used globally, including in low- and middle-income countries (Knox et al., 2018). It was translated into isiZulu for the Asenze study and back-translated to ensure correct interpretation.\n\nOn each cognitive development measure, children who were unable to undertake the assessment activities due to impairment were given a score of zero; those who were unable to complete the measure for other reasons, such as illness or behavioral issues (e.g., hyperactivity) were coded as missing for that scale.\n\nHIV status\n\nHIV status of children and primary caregivers was determined by rapid test (94% of children and 65% of mothers) or by caregiver report of prior testing. Testing was made voluntary for participants due to ethical considerations, such as individuals’ emotional readiness to test, social stigma, and the feared risk of intimate partner violence for those testing positive. For participants who consented to HIV testing for themselves and/or their child, two rapid HIV tests were conducted for each individual. Those who tested newly positive, inconclusive or discordant on the rapid tests were referred for confirmatory testing and care. Those who neither tested nor reported HIV results, as well as those with inconclusive or discordant rapid test results, were classified as HIV status unknown and were excluded from this analysis.\n\nChildren were classified in the CLHIV group if both mother and child were living with HIV, CHEU if the mother was living with HIV but the child was not, and CHUU if neither the mother nor child was living with HIV. Of note, due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, we did not have complete data on the HIV status of mothers at the time of pregnancy. It is possible that some of the mothers of the CHEU group did not seroconvert until after the child was born, resulting in some CHUU being misclassified as CHEU. We conducted a sensitivity analysis (described in the analysis section) to address this issue.\n\nDemographic and clinical variables\n\nCaregiver questionnaires collected data on child and household sociodemographic information, including the child’s sex, child’s weight at birth, alcohol use during pregnancy with the child, whether the child was ever breastfed, whether the child ever attended crèche or preschool, and the total number of children (<18 years old) living in the household. Mothers previously diagnosed with HIV were asked if they had received ART during or after pregnancy with their child, and whether the child had ever received ART.\n\nMothers were asked to report their highest level of education completed and the education level of the child’s father; these responses were dichotomized for analysis as completion of Grade 9 or higher compared to less than Grade 9. Household assets were assessed using questions from the South Africa Demographic and Health Surveys, and an asset index was then constructed using methods previously validated in India, Indonesia, Nepal and Pakistan (Filmer & Pritchett, 2001; Ajayi et al., 2017b). Scores across the full Asenze cohort were divided into thirds; the poorest third of households was denoted using a binary variable. Food insecurity was measured by asking “How many days in the last month has your family run out of food completely?” Any response greater than zero was coded as positive for household food insecurity on a binary variable.\n\nTo identify stunted growth, children’s height-for-age was calculated; scores more than two standard deviations below the WHO Child Growth Standards median were defined as stunting on a binary variable (WHO, 2006). Results from the hearing exam indicating impairment in one or both ears were coded as positive for hearing impairment.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nTo compare developmental outcomes between CHEU, CHUU and CLHIV groups, we used simple linear regression models to compare the groups’ mean scores (GCS total, RDLS subscales and total, and KABC-II subscales), followed by multivariable linear regression models adjusting for confounding variables.\n\nPotential confounders were identified from the literature and included breastfeeding, preschool attendance, maternal ART during pregnancy or perinatally, child ART, maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, poverty, food insecurity, and parental education level (McHenry et al., 2018; Ajayi et al., 2017a, 2017b). To select confounding variables for inclusion in the final models, we used bivariable analyses (t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for categorical variables, and Spearman’s correlation for continuous variables) of each potential confounder by HIV exposure group and by each outcome variable; covariates associated (p<0.10) with both HIV exposure and the selected outcome variable were tested in the multivariable model using a forward selection approach. Variables that resulted in more than a 10% change in the beta coefficient for the HIV exposure-developmental outcome relationship when included in the model, as compared to the simple regression, were retained; the final adjusted models included preschool attendance (all outcomes) and household food insecurity (Kaufman Hand Movement and RLDS Expressive Language only). For maternal ART, we assessed the bivariable association between this potential confounder and each outcome variable within the CHEU and CLHIV groups individually. We also assessed the association of child ART with developmental outcomes within the CLHIV group.\n\nIn sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of potential misclassification of CHUU into the CHEU group, we reclassified various proportions of the highest-scoring CHEU (the top 4%, 5% and 10% in the CHEU group on each outcome measure; a highly conservative assumption since only top scorers were reclassified) into the CHUU group, and then repeated the multivariable analyses. To assess potential bias due to the exclusion of caregiver-child dyads with a non-maternal primary caregiver or lack of HIV status data, we compared the excluded group to the mother-child dyads included in the analysis on key demographic variables using chi-squared tests and t-tests.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn a population-based sample of children in a high HIV-prevalence setting, we found that CHEU scores were not significantly different from those of CHUU on any measure of cognitive development at ages 4–6 in children whose caregivers are their biological mothers. CHEU were also significantly less likely than CLHIV to experience cognitive and language delay. This suggests that peri- and neonatal exposure to maternal HIV infection did not significantly delay children’s neurocognitive and language development in this population.\n\nOur results align with those of several previous studies in sub-Saharan Africa (Boivin et al., 2018; Chaudhury et al., 2017), Asia (Jahanshad et al., 2015), and the US (Sirois et al., 2016; Nichols et al., 2016; Rice et al., 2013). However, the current literature on cognitive development in CHEU contains disparate results. Some studies have identified cognitive and language delay in CHEU groups relative to CHUU (le Roux et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018; McHenry et al., 2018) and to population norms (Rice et al., 2013, 2018).\n\nOne possible explanation for some of these conflicting results is the age at which outcomes are measured. Many of the studies that have found differences between CHEU and CHUU, particularly for language outcomes, have focused on children younger than four years (Wederburn et. al, 2019, le Roux et al., 2019, Desmonde et al., 2018; McHenry et al., 2018), suggesting the possibility that cognitive delays observed in very young CHEU may improve with age. Our findings of no cognitive delay in 4–6-year-old CHEU are consistent with this explanation.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested exposure to maternal ART during pregnancy as a biological mechanism that may account for at least some of the poorer outcomes previously observed in CHEU compared to CHUU children (Chaudhury et al., 2017). Thus, varying rates of ART usage and specific drug agents in different populations are another potential explanation for mixed findings in the literature. In fact, a recently published study of RCT data from Malawi and Uganda by Boivin et al. (2019) even suggests that mothers being maintained on triple ART pre- and post-partum may be protective for CHEU development, while less intensive treatment regimens result in poorer outcomes. However, in our study, in which only early therapies (primarily Neviripine alone) were available to participants, we still observed no differences in development between the CHEU and CHUU groups. Furthermore, maternal ART was not significantly associated with any developmental outcomes within the CHEU group, nor did it appear to be associated with these outcomes within the CLHIV group. The lack of observed association may have been due to the small number of women receiving ART perinatally at the time cohort children were born (2002–2006). It is also possible we did not see an association because effects differ by dose, timing, or duration of ART medication. We did not have detailed data on ART usage, so we were unable to explore heterogeneity of this exposure.\n\nFinally, in the present study, all participants were enrolled from a single population-based sample using identical criteria and recruitment methods, which allowed us to compare CHEU and CHUU groups that were equivalent on most measured sociodemographic variables. In most prior studies, CHEU and CHUU were drawn from different source populations. Our finding that CHEU did not differ from CHUU in their cognitive and language abilities at ages 4–6 may simply reflect sufficient similarity of comparison groups on key social, economic, and environmental factors that affect cognitive development.\n\nStrengths and Limitations\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first population-based cohort study to compare the neurodevelopment of CHEU, CHUU and CLHIV in a high HIV-prevalence setting. Most prior studies have recruited participants from medical facilities, an approach that is not likely to result in a study that is representative of the full population in the area of interest. Furthermore, some studies have used different criteria and source populations for the enrollment of different HIV exposure status groups; in most of these cases, the CLHIV children were clinical trial participants. In contrast, the mother-child pairs in the Asenze study were enrolled from a single population using identical criteria and methods across all HIV exposure status groups. An additional strength is the use of a full cognitive assessment battery that allowed us to assess development based on both measures developed and validated locally (the GCS) and a global measure widely used in sub-Saharan Africa (the KABC-II). These measures were also based in two different theoretical approaches to child development, those of Piaget (Grover & Sebate, 2000) and Vygotsky (Kaufman & Kaufman, 1997).\n\nA limitation of this study is the lack of more rigorous HIV exposure data at the time of pregnancy. It is likely that some of the women in the study contracted HIV after their child was born, resulting in children being misclassified as CHEU when they should have been in the CHUU group. If the children who were truly exposed scored lower on average than the truly unexposed children and such misclassification did occur, CHEU group scores would be inflated and appear closer to the CHUU group scores, resulting in bias towards a null finding for the CHEU-CHUU comparison. Sensitivity analyses indicated that our findings were reasonably robust to misclassification, even under extremely conservative assumptions.\n\nAdditionally, we relied on self-reported HIV status data from participants who declined testing but provided HIV status information on study surveys. Some false negative responses may have occurred due to concerns around privacy and stigma; however, participants were given the option to decline the question. If such misclassification did occur, the CHEU-CHUU and CHEU-CLHIV comparisons could have been biased towards null findings. Future studies should obtain clinical data on HIV status whenever possible, though in population-based studies such as this one, it is generally necessary to allow participants to opt out of testing for ethical reasons.\n\nAnother limitation is that a substantial proportion of the original 1581 children in the study could not be included in this analysis, either because the child’s primary caregiver was not the child’s biological mother, or because HIV status data was unavailable for child, mother, or both. Both scenarios may be more likely among children who are exposed to or living with HIV. However, there is no reason to believe that either would be independently associated with the child’s cognitive outcomes. Additionally, an analysis comparing the included and excluded dyads showed that although excluded children had lower average birthweight and were less likely to be breastfed, they were equivalent to the included children on key variables, including age and sex, stunted growth, hearing impairment, and preschool attendance. We would thus not expect this limitation to significantly bias our findings.\n\nImplications\n\nWe found that CHEU had equivalent cognitive and language outcomes to CHUU children at ages 4–6, in contrast to CLHIV who had significant developmental delays. The observation that CHEU did not appear to be at higher risk is promising. It indicates that the emerging success of PMTCT programs in high HIV prevalence areas may positively impact child development, in addition to reducing other HIV-related morbidities and mortality. There is a need for future epidemiologic research that includes longitudinal assessment of perinatal HIV exposure status and later child developmental outcomes."
