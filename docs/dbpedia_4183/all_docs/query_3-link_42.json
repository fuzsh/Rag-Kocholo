        "text": "Justin Coetzee stunned a Test team with a ten-wicket haul long before he made his first-class debut. Playing for the Western Australia 2nd XI in a warm-up game, Coetzee dropped the Pakistanis with figures of 5 for 66 and 5 for 23, and then added another five in a one-day game. A tall left-armer who first played cricket in South Africa, he earned a rookie contract in 2005-06 and has been part of the Academy. He had to wait until 2009-10 for his maiden first-class appearance and over the past two summers has been an occasional part of the Warriors' limited-overs side.\n\nCricinfo staff October 2010"
