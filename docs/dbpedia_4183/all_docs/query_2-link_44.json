        "text": "Tribute to my Grandfather, Marcellini A. Cusano:\n\nA little over a year has passed since God called you home, but yet I still feel your presence as if you were right here with me. I remember growing up as a kid, the stories you would tell me about the places you had been and seen, and the stories you would tell me about your time in Europe. I didn't get the chance to say I love you before you left us, but if you could hear me now, please know how dearly you are missed. You were the one who came home, and laid the foundation for our family, and helped mold it into what we are today. As 3rd generation, I hope that my experiences with you and the wisdom you have left us will continue to be passed on to your great grandchildren who never got the honor of your presence. Rest assured, it will be carried on, and they will know all about you, and the wonderful man that you are. Although you are gone, you will live forever in my heart as you were more of a father to me than a grandfather. I thank you for the time you gave me, and know how much I love you. Sleep well, until we meet again.\n\nTribute to my Father, Donald Masterman Smith, USN:\n\nBorn in 1911 at home on Chamberlain Ave. in Portland Maine. He joined the Maine Citizens Military Training Camp at Ft. McKinley in 1928 at the age of 17. He retired as the oldest enlisted man in the US Navy in 1972 after 44 years of faithful service to his beloved America. Commended for devotion to duty while under fire and bombing during the evacuation of Singapore in 1942. He served in both the Europe, Pacific theaters and continued during the Korean and Vietnam wars. He was Chief Master At Arms for president Kennedy's visit to China Lake Naval Ordnance Test Station in California in June of 1963. Chief Smith served on the Senior Staff of the USS Chicago CG-11, Flag Ship for the USS Kitty Hawk Aircraft Carrier. My father passed away at home in January 1974 and under the direction of the 11th Naval District, Smitty' as his fellow shipmates called him, was buried at sea with full honors from the USS Hepburn DE-1055 in January of 1974. Accompanying this event with, 'All hands on deck, was the crew of his last sea duty, the USS Chicago and the USS Kitty Hawk on their voyage and WestPac tour to Asia. Having navigated the 7 oceans of the world and devoting his entire life to serve freedom wherever he was needed, A good and kind man, I am so very proud to say he was my father. Any person who ever shook his hand never forgot him and in doing so, knew they were in the presence of a friend. Although many years have slipped by since his passing..I can feel the goodness of his spirit as strong as ever. I am pleased to honor his memory at this time, for as America moves on, we should cherish and bring forward the good of the past and leave the rest in the backwash of history Chief Smith's ancestors are interred at Evergreen Cemetery in Portland Maine and there is a monument there in remembrance to his life and service. Donald Masterman Smith was and is a true Maine American Hero.\n\nTribute to my Father, Thomas H. MacDonald:\n\nMy father was in the Army Air Corp and served in Europe. He was a navigator on a bomber flying from Italy to bomb the city of Dresden, Germany. On his last mission in November 1944, his plane was shot down over Czechoslovakia. A farmer picked him up and brought him to a village office. The Germans sent SS officers to transport him to Berlin for interrogation. All of the soldiers on his plane made it home safely from the war though my father did not see any of them until many years later, in the 1990's in Florida (he had a ME FORMER POW license plate.\n\nWhen my father arrived in Berlin, he was questioned many times and then placed in solitary confinement for about 2 months. He said that this was the most difficult time, little human contact. Then he was moved to several concentration camps in Germany and Poland. This was near the end of the war and there was very little food or fuel to keep warm. But he said life was better being with other soldiers. Also, he commended the German people who worked in the camps \"as good people just like us\". My Dad did not talk about most of his experience until the last decade of his life. He said to me, \"War is awful and confusing\". He described the bombing of Dresden as horrific, \"the sky was black with bombers flying under radar, then blasting the city in clouds of smoke.\"\n\nAt the end of the war, Hitler ordered that all prisoners of war be killed. He was then in a camp with several thousand prisoners and only a few hundred Germans working there. The prisoners told the guards that they were out numbered and that the prisoners would revolt and kill the guards if necessary. It was not necessary.\n\nWhen World War II ended, my dad's camp had still not been liberated. It was in a location such that the Russians would be liberating them. My dad did not like that idea so he just walked out of the camp with the German workers and no one stopped him. Before he left he had the foresight to tear his detailed prison record from the official records so he could prove that he had been imprisoned.\n\nNext, he tried to find Americans and hid in several Polish manor housed. He said that he observed Russian troops coming to liberate the prison camp. Eventually he met up with some allied soldiers just as they were liberating Bergen Belsen death camp. He saw the survivors being removed in wagon. He said that they looked like death, like skeletons yet they were alive. This was indeed the most horror that he witnessed. He could not understand how this could have happened and why God, if there was one, let it happen. From that moment on, he did not believe in a God. I did not know this until 1997 about a year before his death of chronic leukemia.\n\nMy father was a man who returned from the war damaged in ways we never knew. He would never lock his cars or the places where we lived. He enjoyed life to the fullest and never focused on the negative, often to the point of self-centered behavior. He was a gifted athlete and was nicknamed \"moose\" when in Army training because he would carry the guts packs when they could not.\n\nHe was very active before and after the war, up until his death in August 1998. He played golf in Florida and at Sugarloaf until 3 weeks before his death. He loved downhill skiing and we skied together when he was 75. He loved playing football in high school (Madison HS), at MCI and at the University of Maine after the war. In high school he was the goalie on the state champion team for Madison. He was a great tennis player and was on Madison's team when it won the state championship. He was a school teacher in Madison for many years and a ski instructor at Sugarloaf for 20+ years. One of his first trips after the war in the winter of 1946, was to camp out at the bottom of Sugarloaf mountain and climb several miles to the summit with skins on his skis to ski down the Winter's Way trail.\n\nHe loved to fish at Moose Head and at Chesuncook Lake, canoe in the Allagash and climbed Mount Kathadin many times. He taught many Madison Junior High School students to ski when he was a gym teacher. He encouraged me and those around him to be active, to be the best at whatever you do, and to enjoy life to the fullest everyday. He was and is my hero."
