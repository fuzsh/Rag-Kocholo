        "text": "BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\n\nThe activist, administrator, social worker, poet, scholar, educator, playwright, and one of the figures of the renowned Black Arts Movement, Useni Eugene Perkins, was born in Chicago on September 13, 1932 as Eugene Perkins. His parents were the Chicago sculptor Marion Perkins and his wife, Eva. Throughout his life Useni was always around the arts while being taught to embrace his African American culture and heritage. When he was ten, his father took him to see Paul Robeson play the lead role in Shakespeare’s ‘Othello’. Useni credits the experience as an influential one in his decision to become a writer. He published his first poem in the Chicago Tribune at the age of eleven.\n\nPerkins attended Wendell Phillips High School where he was editor of the newspaper wherein he also wrote creatively. In the early 1950s Perkins joined the US Air Force and was honorably discharged after serving three years. His collegiate experience carried him to Knoxville, Tennessee and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He returned to Chicago to attend George Williams College where he graduated with a degree in group social work in 1961. Useni went on to earn his Masters of Science in administration from the same school in 1964. He furthered his education by earning 28 credits toward a Master of Science in Public Administration from DePaul University. Perkins has two children, Julia and Russell.\n\nMost of Perkins’ professional life before retiring was centered on the social development of urban youth. For nearly two decades (1966-1982) he worked as the Director and Executive Director of the Better Boys Foundation Family Center in Chicago. The center was a large social organization dedicated to community development. In addition to and during his work with Better Boys, Perkins published “Home is a Dirty Street: The Social Oppression of Black Children” (1975). The book was praised and promoted by historian Lerone Bennett, Jr. Perkins later served as the Chief Executive Officer of the Urban League of Portland, Oregon, Interim President of the DuSable Museum, Professor and Project Director of Chicago State University Family Life Center. Perkins also served as the chairperson of “Artists for Harold Washington” during Washington’s election campaign to become the first African American mayor of Chicago and he was the co-founder and first president of the Chicago Black Theater Alliance (1974) and the Midwest Black Theater Alliance (1975).\n\nThe bulk of these Useni Eugene Perkins Papers contain draft manuscripts that are typed and handwritten original plays. Included here are children’s musicals, poems, and Perkins’ nonfiction work, as well as four archival boxes of his business communications. In viewing this collection as a whole it is clear that Perkins worked wonders to fuse his professional career as a social worker with his creative expression as a writer. His plays were primarily focused on presenting positive role models and lessons geared toward urban youth.\n\nPerkins’ role as a social worker poet-playwright represents a subplot to many of his historical verses and dramas that were written for young people. One of his primary messages was for teens to aim higher than the realities of the streets and soar far above the stereotypical images of those too often offered by Hollywood. His book of poetry “Black is Beautiful,” and his plays about “Image Makers”, Ida B. Wells, Paul Robeson, Fred Hampton, Jean Baptiste DuSable, Haiti and Tulsa, Oklahoma are but a small example of the culturally specific subject matter Useni chose to write about.\n\nIt should be further noted that: “Image Makers” was performed in Nigeria during FESTAC in 1977 and was highly acclaimed. “Black Fairy and Other Plays,” published by Third World Press 1993 was also well-regarded. Some of the plays were performed locally as well as nationally. Perkins’s play “If We Must Die,” about the 1921 Tulsa riots, earned him an award from The Black Network for Excellence in Playwriting in 2002.\n\nUseni’s creative work was greatly influenced by the Black Arts Movement which was a cultural program that grew out of the Civil Rights and Black Power movements of the 1960s and 1970s. He was an early and influential activist in OBAC, the Chicago-based expression of the Black Arts Movement. Perkins was listed with, hired and recognized by the largest Black talent agency in Chicago in the form of Abena Joan Brown’s “eta” (Ebony Talent Association Inc.). Also among Perkins’ accomplishments are his appointments. These include the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs Advisory Board (1984), the Chicago Board of Education Task Force on Gangs (1981), and Illinois Governor James Thompson’s Special Task Force on Troubled Youth (1980).\n\nSources\n\nAndrews, William L., Foster, Fances Smith and Harris, Trudier.
