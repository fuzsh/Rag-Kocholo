The special ceremonial meeting will be in order. The invocation will be given by the Reverend Daniel P. Coughlin, Chaplain of the House of Representatives. The Chaplain of the House of Representatives, the Reverend Daniel P. Coughlin, offered the following invocation: Lord God, this is a day of history. Bless this exceptional joint meeting of the 107th Congress which commemorates the tragic events that occurred here last September 11. The gaping hole left in this city tore into the fabric of this Nation, but there was no greater suffering than in New York. Once again, we commend to Your loving mercy, the victims, survivors, and their families. We also honor those public servants and ordinary citizens who joined professionals in healing wounds and rebuilding lives in this proud city of life and diversity. Gathered in this historic place, You alone can renew us as You have in the past. May the vision of the Founding Fathers come alive again in this body politic to preserve the balance of power and assure the freedom of the law-abiding people of this Nation. The Bible here, used by George Washington when sworn in as President, speaks to Your consoling word: ``I am with you.'' Lord God, today is Rosh Hashanah. The traditional Jewish New Year prayer is for a good and sweet year. Many things You send us, Lord, are good, but they may hurt or are hurried. So with our Jewish brothers and sisters we pray today not only for a year of good things, but a year of sweetness, a chance to relish the blessings of the world and the freedoms You give us, and to enjoy the sweet kindness and love of one another. May this be a good year for all Americans of all faiths, backgrounds, and traditions. We pray for a good year for America and for the world. Amen. Pledge of Allegiance The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes the Honorable Jerrold Nadler, Representative from New York, and the Honorable Harry Reid, Senator from Nevada, to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance to our flag. Mr. Nadler and Senator Reid led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. The SPEAKER. Our national anthem will now be sung by LaChanze. The national anthem was sung by LaChanze. The SPEAKER. My colleagues, we are here in Federal Hall in New York, NY, pursuant to H. Con. Res. 448 of the 107th Congress to conduct a special ceremonial meeting in remembrance of the victims and the heroes of September 11, 2001, and in recognition of the courage and the spirit of the City of New York. When representatives of the New York delegation introduced in the House and the Senate in 2001 concurrent resolutions that suggested the Congress convene outside the seat of government to symbolize the Nation's solidarity with New Yorkers who epitomize the human spirit of courage, resilience and strength, my initial reaction of support was tempered by the realization that under article 1, section 5, clause 4 of the Constitution, ``Neither House shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn to any other place than that in which the two houses shall be sitting.'' There is no precedent for the convening of an actual session of Congress outside the seat of government, but on one special occasion the Congress engaged in ceremonial functions outside the seat of government. Members of both houses traveled to Philadelphia on July 16, 1987, for organized festivities surrounding the bicentennial anniversary of the Constitution pursuant to a similar concurrent resolution. On the strength of the precedent of the uniquely historical and national significance of that occasion, it is appropriate to dedicate another ceremonial gathering to a matter of transcendent importance at another place of basic institutional relevance to the Congress. Thus, we are gathered in Federal Hall where the First Congress met in 1789 before moving the third session of that Congress to Congress Hall in Philadelphia, PA, in 1790. Ladies and gentlemen, we are, therefore, meeting here under that precedent. The Chair recognizes the Honorable Richard B. Cheney, the Vice President of the United States and President of the U.S. Senate. Vice President CHENEY. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Each time Congress meets, we are mindful of the great charge that we have all been given as public servants. Assembled today in Federal Hall we are reminded of the ones who served before us and those who served first. It is a humbling experience to stand on the site where the First Congress met, where the first President was sworn in, where the Bill of Rights was introduced. Every Member of the House and Senate and every citizen of this country can draw a straight line from the events in Federal Hall to the life we all know today. When Congress convened here, America was a Nation of scarcely 4 million souls. The tallest structure in the city was Trinity Church, which still stands at the corner of Broadway and Wall Street. The roll call of that First Congress included signers of the Declaration of Independence and men who marched in George Washington's army. Two gentlemen from Virginia still in their 30s served in that Congress. Their names were Madison and Monroe. All the Members knew that great responsibilities had come to them. As Vice President John Adams observed, ``A trust of the greatest magnitude is committed to this legislature and the eyes of the world are upon you.'' In their actions, the Members of the First Congress met that test. And although this city was the Nation's Capital for only a short time, from those early days, the eyes of the world have continued to be on New York. One year ago, this great center of history, enterprise, and creativity suffered the gravest of cruelties and showed itself to be a place of valor and generosity and grace. Here, where so many innocent lives were suddenly taken, the world saw acts of kindness and heroism that will be remembered forever. When President Bush introduced Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki at the joint session last September, it was, said one New Yorker, as if the Members of Congress had recognized that these two men had come directly off the battlefield. Today, Congress gathers near that battlefield to honor the character and the courage shown in New York these last 360 days, and to remember every innocent life taken in the attacks of September 11. Since the hour of those attacks, we have been a Nation at war called once again to defend our liberty and our lives and to save humanity from the worst of wars. As a Nation born in revolution, we know that our freedom came at a very high price. We have no intention now of letting it slip away. The Members of the First Congress shaped events long into the future. The same is now asked of us. In the principles we stand for, the values we uphold, and the decisions we make we will set the course of this Nation and with it the future of human freedom and the peace of the world. It is not given to us to know every turn of events to come. We know, however, that we are the elected servants of a good, a just, and a decent people. May we always act in that spirit, confident in our founding principles, clear in our purposes, choosing wisely and bowing only to divine providence. The SPEAKER.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, leaders of the House and the Senate, on behalf of Ben Gilman, Senator Schumer and Senator Clinton, and the entire New York congressional delegation, we would like to thank you for your support of this resolution that gives us in New York an opportunity to say thank you for the way you responded to the attack on our city and our State. You give our mayor and our Governor an opportunity to be here on this historic event to say you did not treat us like New Yorkers, you treated us like Americans. The text of the concurrent resolution was read as follows: Representative RANGEL. ``Whereas on September the 11, 2001, thousands of innocent people were killed and injured in a combined terrorist attack involving four hijacked aircraft, the World Trade Center, and the Pentagon; ``Whereas in the aftermath of the attacks, thousands more were left grieving for beloved family and friends, livelihoods were compromised, and businesses and property were damaged and lost;'' Representative GILMAN. ``Whereas the greatest loss of life, personal injury, and physical destruction occurred in and was sustained by the City of New York; ``Whereas Government and the American people responded decisively through the bravery, sacrifice and toil of the fire and rescue workers, law enforcement, building trades, caregivers, Armed Forces, and millions more who through their many expressions of care and compassion brought forth comfort, hope, and the promise of recovery;'' Senator CLINTON. ``Whereas the City of New York attended to the aftermath of the destruction of the World Trade Center with profound respect for the victims and compassion to the survivors; and ``Whereas the City of New York has invited the Congress to meet at the site of the original Federal Hall, where the First Congress of the United States convened on March 4, 1789: Now, therefore, be it'' Senator SCHUMER. ``Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That, in remembrance of the victims and the heroes of September 11, 2001, and in recognition of the courage and spirit of the City of New York, the Congress shall conduct a special meeting in Federal Hall, New York, New York, on September 6, 2002. Passed by the House of Representatives, July 25, 2002. Passed by the Senate, July 26, 2002.'' The SPEAKER. Without objection, the Members present, on behalf of themselves and the Congress of the United States, do hereby affirm the aforesaid concurrent resolution. Would Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Pataki please come forward and accept the concurrent resolution. Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Pataki of New York accepted the concurrent resolution. The SPEAKER.

The plaque is inscribed as follows: ``Commemorative Joint Meeting of the Congress of the United States of America in Federal Hall, New York, New York, this Sixth Day of September, Two Thousand and Two.'' Representative FOSSELLA. ``Convened in remembrance of the victims and heroes of September 11, 2001, and in recognition of the courage and spirit of the City of New York. ``This gift to Federal Hall from the Congress of the United States of America was made from a section of Aquia Creek, VA, sandstone and used as an original building material of the United States Capitol. It was removed on the East Central Front extension in 1958.'' The SPEAKER. Director Mainella, please come forward and accept the commemorative plaque. Director Mainella accepted the commemorative plaque. The SPEAKER. Billy Collins, Poet Laureate of the United States of America, will now read a poem written for this occasion entitled ``The Names.'' Reading of ``The Names'' by Billy Collins, Poet Laureate of the United States Mr. COLLINS. This poem is dedicated to the victims of September 11, and to their survivors. ``The Names'' Yesterday, I lay awake in the palm of the night. A fine rain stole in, unhelped by any breeze, And when I saw the silver glaze on the windows, I started with A, with Ackerman, as it happened, Then Baxter and Calabro, Davis and Eberling, names falling into place As droplets fell through the dark. Names printed on the ceiling of the night. Names slipping around a water bend. Twenty-six willows on the banks of a stream. In the morning, I walked out barefoot Among thousands of flowers Heavy with dew like the eyes of tears, And each had a name-- Fiori inscribed on a yellow petal Then Gonzalez and Han, Ishikawa and Jenkins. Names written in the air And stitched into the cloth of the day. A name under a photograph taped to a mailbox. Monogram on a torn shirt. I see you spelled out on storefront windows And on the bright unfurled awnings of this city, I say the syllables as I turn a corner-- Kelly and Lee, Medina, Nardella, and O'Connor. When I peer into the woods, I see a thick tangle where letters are hidden As in a puzzle concocted for children. Parker and Quigley in the twigs of an ash, Rizzo, Schubert, Torres, and Upton. Secrets in the boughs of an ancient maple. Names written in the pale sky. Names rising in the updraft amid buildings. Names silent in stone Or cried out behind a door. Names blown over the Earth and out to sea. In the evenings--weakening light, the last swallows. A boy on a lake lifts his oars. A woman by a window puts a match to a candle, And the names are outlined on the rose clouds-- Vanacore and Wallace, (let X stand, if it can, for the ones unfound) Then Young and Ziminsky, the final jolt of Z. Names etched on the head of a pin. One name spanning a bridge, another undergoing a tunnel. A blue name needled into the skin. Names of citizens, workers, mothers and fathers, The bright-eyed daughter, the quick son. Alphabet of names in green rows in a field. Names in the small tracks of birds. Names lifted from a hat Or balanced on the tip of the tongue. Names wheeled into the dim warehouse of memory. So many names, there is barely room on the walls of the heart. The SPEAKER. The Chair now recognizes the Honorable Richard Gephardt, Representative from Missouri and Democratic Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives. Representative GEPHARDT. Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, and my fellow colleagues of the U.S. Congress, today we speak of the unspeakable, we remember the unimaginable, and we reaffirm our utmost resolve to defend the birthright of this land and our gift outright to this world: Ideals of liberty and tolerance that will never die. Today, we say to the families who look to this September 11 and know that they will know the pain of their piercing loss all over again, we are with you as one, as the family of America. We pray that, for you, memory will bring hope as well as tears. We have faith that love outlasts life, and you prove it every day as you carry on the dream of a lost husband or a wife, for the child that was both of yours and, in the truest sense, always will be. We think of those last calls on cell phones from a doomed building or plane. Those last goodbyes. Yet the life of a good person is like a wellspring that does not run dry. Nothing reminds us more powerfully of that than the rescuers of September 11, so many of them taken too, who rescued our national spirit and, amid the smoke and the darkness at noon, sent a flickering light that became a shining beacon for America. So we have wept together, we have prayed together, given to each other, and stood side by side since September 11 in common humanity and national purpose. The sorrow has been matched by strength. America is on a mission. Not retribution or revenge, not just to defeat terrorism, but to show once again that good can triumph over evil and freedom can overcome fanaticism, as we did in different forums in a global arena twice before in the past century. Some say that September 11, 2001, is another date that will live in infamy. Surely that is true, but it is also true that we have never known an assault like this, not just on our Armed Forces, but on our people. Not just on our buildings and our possessions, or even on the principles that we profess, but on the very foundation of this open, diverse, democratic society. We have grown accustomed, too accustomed, to war and slaughter in our world. But most always it was ``over there.'' One place it came before in the heartland was the homegrown terrorism that struck in Oklahoma City. Today, our caring and thoughts are there as well. And they are a half a world away with the young Americans who are on the front lines of freedom from fear. For all our differences, how remarkably one we are all today. From Ground Zero to a sacred field in Pennsylvania, to a shattered but now rebuilt wing of the Pentagon, and all across this broad land. On the fatal flights of September 11, courage and resistance knew no bounds of party or race or status. They included a young father, a conservative columnist, and a gay man. E Pluribus Unum. So while we discuss and debate the next decisions, on the fundamental issue let there be no doubt. In this great and faithful struggle there are no Republicans, there are no Democrats, there are only Americans. None of us, no matter how long we live or what else marks our time, will ever forget September 11. And all of us, in the name of those who were lost for a concept of liberty that must never be lost, and in the cause of civilization itself, are as determined as an earlier generation of Americans to gain the inevitable triumph, so help us God. The SPEAKER. The Chair now recognizes the Honorable Trent Lott, the Senator from Mississippi and the Republican Leader of the U.S. Senate. Senator LOTT. Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress, and distinguished guests, on behalf of the Senate and a united Congress, it is truly an honor to stand in this place in this city, New York City, today. We are here to remember and to continue to mourn those who lost their lives, those innocent men, women, and children who were killed in that horrible event, September 11, a year ago. We are here to show our continued appreciation for those who struggled so mightily to free and to save those who were trapped in the aftermath of the experience here in New York City and at the Pentagon. But we are also here to express our recommitment to the people of New York and Pennsylvania and Virginia that we are with you. We will continue our efforts to help you to rebuild physically and spiritually, and to recommit ourselves to do everything in our power to make sure that America is secure against this horrible event or anything like it ever happening again. Over the years, New York City has been called many things, from New Amsterdam to the Big Apple. Today, the Congress of the United States, Congressman Rangel, call it home. We are here, we are comfortable here. We are here to stand with the people in this city because it is symbolic of how we stand together all across America. We came here a year ago, the week after the infamous date. We expressed our commitment and we have been working every since to keep that commitment, and we will continue to do so. This is a special place, as has already been said, because the First Congress began the work here that we continue to this day. The work of ordered liberty, preserving, expanding the freedoms that now, as then, are the inalienable right of every person. Two centuries ago, there were those who thought this was all nonsense. In their ignorance and arrogance, they called America a doomed folly. But history overtook them and their crowns and armies are part of the dustbin of history. There are those like them today who cannot see beyond the limits of their own hatred. It is so hard for us in America to even understand why there would be this hatred. They do not understand that in the unending struggle against tyranny, divine providence by whatever name we use is always on the side of freedom. When the First Congress was meeting here in New York in January 1790, President Washington asked its Members for ``the cool and deliberate exertion of your patriotism, firmness and wisdom.'' As we face today's challenge to our country, we pledge to the people of New York just what we ask of them and all Americans: The cool and deliberate exertion of your patriotism, firmness, and wisdom. We have seen it in this city. We have seen it in America, and we are here to do our part in that effort. The duration of our present conflict and its eventual price may be in doubt, but there can be no doubt as to its outcome. From this city's day of horror, out of all the loss and sorrow, has come a strength. I have seen it all across America. A resolve. A determination which, from Manhattan, to Mississippi, now binds us together for the mighty work that lies ahead. Thank you very much. The SPEAKER. The Chair now recognizes the Honorable Tom Daschle, the Senator from South Dakota and majority leader of the U.S. Senate. Senator DASCHLE. Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, distinguished visitors and my colleagues, the U.S. Congress has come here to commemorate a shattering experience. One that has transformed America. The poet Yeats, after a moment of violent upheaval in his own country, wrote: ``All is changed. Changed utterly. A terrible beauty is born.'' As we near the first anniversary of September 11 with profound sadness, our hearts ache for those who died and for their families and loved ones. At the same time, we are filled with an abiding sense of gratitude to the people who live and work in this great city, especially the courageous workers and rescuers, for the way they inspired and stunned a wounded Nation. In their countless acts of heroism and compassion, a terrible beauty was born. In an hour of horror and grief, they showed us how to go on. Here in New York, at the Pentagon, and in that lonely field in Pennsylvania, the wounds the terrorist inflicted were deep. But America's resolve was even deeper. Let history record that the terrorists failed. They sought to destroy America by attacking what they thought were our greatest strengths, but they did not understand that the true strength of America is not steel, it is not concrete, it is our belief in the ideals enshrined in our Constitution and in our Bill of Rights. It is in our shared faith in liberty and our unwavering commitment to each other. So what happened on September 11 did not diminish our strength. It renewed it. We stand united today as proud citizens of the oldest and strongest democracy on Earth. Our faith in that democracy and in our future is absolute and unshakable. Next Wednesday, September 11, an eternal flame will be lit in Battery Park. That flame will symbolize our determination never, ever to forget. We will never forget the heartbreaking loss. We will never forget the selfless heroism. We will never forget the terrible beauty that was born here 1 year ago. Thank you. The SPEAKER. The Chair now recognizes the Honorable Eliot Engel, Representative from New York. Representative ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise first to thank all my colleagues for voting to bring the Congress here to New York. It's been more than 200 years since Congress last met in New York City. It is a fitting tribute that Congress has returned here at this most sorrowful time. The past year has been a tragic and very difficult time for me and my fellow New Yorkers. We watched in horror as terrorists hijacked two commercial airliners and slammed them into the World Trade Center. We watched in horror as the Twin Towers came down and dust and debris blanketed lower Manhattan. We watched in horror as the names of the more than 3,000 people murdered that day were announced. But, in the days and weeks that followed, we New Yorkers experienced something else. We felt the hopes and prayers of millions of Americans flow over us. We felt the pride of being an American swell and invigorate us all. We felt the determination of the greatest Nation the Earth has every known renew itself and commit to rebuilding. The terrorists intended many things with their attack. They sought to grievously wound our Nation. And we were--we paid with the blood of our fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, and brother and sisters. They sought to disrupt our economy. And they did--billions of dollars have been lost and will be spent on recovery. The terrorists also sought to incite fear into the hearts and souls of every American. But they failed. Instead, they inspired a Nation of freedom-loving people to stand up to those who would seek to deny them their liberties, their justice, and the American way of life. They inspired us to fight back, so that our children's children will grow up in a world where they can safely speak their views, engage in the political system, and worship in their own way. As we meet here, in this historic location, I am reminded of one of our country's greatest Presidents, Abraham Lincoln. His words, spoken more than a century ago, are most fitting today: We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this Nation shall have a new birth of freedom; and that this government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth. The SPEAKER. We are gathered here today in this ceremonial session to pay tribute to the people of New York and to the people of New York City who have suffered great loss, but persevered in the face of adversity. In doing so, we pay tribute to the American spirit. It is altogether appropriate that we meet here today in Federal Hall. After all, it was here that the First Congress met to ratify the Bill of Rights and to inaugurate our first President of the United States, George Washington. As in 1789, when ordinary Americans did extraordinary things to create a new Nation conceived in liberty and dedication to freedom, on September 11, ordinary Americans exhibited extraordinary courage in fighting a horrific evil. New York lost hundreds of sons and daughters in that brutal attack on our Nation's freedom. She lost firemen and custodians, stockbrokers, police officers, construction workers and executives. We also suffered a great loss in Virginia when a plane slammed into the Pentagon, and in Somerset County, PA, when another plane that was headed for Washington, DC, was brought down by the efforts of brave passengers. We still feel the loss of every single person who perished on that fateful day. But as we lament the loss of life, we can marvel at the bravery of those who rushed in to help. Such bravery was on display when Battalion Chief Orio J. Palmer and Fire Marshal Ronald Bucca of the New York Fire Department climbed to the 78th floor of the World Trade Center to organize a rescue. Their efforts saved the lives of dozens of people. Bravery was also on display when several passengers of United flight 93 decided that they would not let the terrorist complete their plans. They sacrificed themselves rather than let the terrorists win. Stories of uncommon heroism were common on September 11. The genius of America could be found in the sacrifices of these brave martyrs of freedom. As we remember September 11, we must look forward to the day when we complete the task at hand, when we vanquish once and for all the terrorists who seek to take away our Nation's freedom. We thank those Americans who serve in our Nation's Armed Forces who fight to preserve our freedom and still work to bring terrorists to justice. We elected Members of the 107th Congress, like those Members gathered in this location of the First Congress, simply reflect the desires of a people who cherish liberty and are willing to fight for freedom. Let us always remember those we lost on September 11, and may God continue to bless America. Thank you. ``God Bless America'' Sung by Chamber Choir, Stuyvesant High School, New York City The SPEAKER. The Stuyvesant High School Chamber Choir will now sing ``God Bless America.'' The Chamber Choir, Stuyvesant High School, sang ``God Bless America.'' The Members and guests sang ``God Bless America.'' The SPEAKER. Ladies and gentlemen of the House and the Senate, this concludes the special ceremonial meeting of the Congress. Members are asked to remain in their seats and make their exit with the colors. The Chair will assure that the record of these proceedings will be printed in the Congressional Record. The proceedings are closed. The Colors were retired by the Color Guard composed of members of the New York City Fire Department, New York City Police Department, New York State Unified Court System Officers, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police, and the U.S. Capitol Police. [Whereupon, the commemorative joint meeting of the Congress was adjourned.] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T3000.003 Photograph by Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times. Luncheon Hosted by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg Mayor BLOOMBERG. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Mike Bloomberg, and I'm pleased to be the mayor of the City of New York. Thank you. There is an expression that you will hear in New York frequently at this time of the year that you may or may not be familiar with. It sounds like ``chana tova,'' which means ``happy new year.'' And for those of you who care, happy new year. Speaker Hastert, Majority Leader Daschle, Minority Leader Gephardt, Minority Leader Lott, distinguished Members of Congress, including the dean of New York State's delegation, the Honorable Charles Rangel, and our two great Members of the Upper Chamber, Senators Schumer and Clinton, good afternoon. I am delighted to welcome you to New York for this truly historic occasion. Today, we hearken back to the early days of our republic, when the First Congress convened in New York and George Washington was inaugurated as our President. Many of our Founding Fathers lived in New York in those days, including Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, John Hancock and others. So many others, in fact, that the painter of ``The Declaration of Independence,'' the famous canvas that hangs in the Capitol Rotunda, had to move to New York to finish his work. It's often been pointed out that the decision Congress made to move the capital from New York to a new site on the banks of the Potomac, in effect, gave the United States two capitals. We now have one capital in Washington, DC, for the government, and one here, for business and culture. Rather than feel slighted, New York has always embraced its role. Today's joint session, for however briefly, made New York the Nation's Capital once again. But now we'll just have to revert to our regular status: as capital of the free world. I would like to acknowledge an institution without which this day would not have been possible, the Annenberg Foundation. The foundation generously donated $1 million to cover all the travel, food and security expenses associated with today's wonderful show of support for freedom. We are blessed to have with us today, from Pennsylvania and from California, Lee Annenberg. Would you please stand and let us say thank you? Congress' decision to return to New York symbolically closes a circle at a crucial time in our history. It brings Congress back to its first home, if only for 1 day, to send a message to the Nation and the entire world: The spirit of this city and the spirit of this country remains unshaken. We are as united today as we were when the First Congress met in lower Manhattan more than 200 years ago, because our commitment to freedom has never been stronger. As a Nation, and as a city, we learned a lot about ourselves on September 11, when the unimaginable became a reality. What happened down the street from here wasn't just an assault on New York, it was an attack on our Nation and on all freedom-loving people around the world. That day, as the world watched, our rescue teams battled the smoke and the chaos. It didn't matter whether you came from Astoria or Atlanta or Australia, from Queens or Kansas or Kenya; New York was everybody's hometown that day. The stakes for our Nation were raised. Someone placed a big bet that they could destroy New York, a city that has contributed immeasurably to building the greatest democracy on Earth. This city has responded. This Nation has responded. America is a Nation founded on a particular set of ideas: the right to express yourself as you see fit, the right to worship God in your own way and the right to live without fear. What happened on September 11 was not only an attack on our people, but on those freedoms and our basic way of life. And all Americans understand that. New Yorkers recognize that we would not have made it through the darkest days in our city's history without our Nation's help. It poured in from around the country in the form of food, equipment and volunteers, and through emotional and moral support beyond value. And I want all Americans to understand that we know you were there for us when we needed you, and we will be there for you if you ever need us. Congress has also stood with us. More than we ever had a right to expect, you helped and are continuing to help New York to rebuild and recover. And on behalf of all New Yorkers, it is my honor to say, ``Thank you.'' As you know, our work is not done yet, not by any means. But the recovery that began on 9/11 and the work we've done since simply could not have happened without your support. And let me also convey our appreciation to President Bush for his courageous leadership in a time of crisis, for coming to New York to share our grief and to share our determination to not just endure the tragedy visited upon us, but to emerge stronger from the events of September 11. I am pleased to report that, with your help, we have made triumphant progress since that day. Because of remarkable bipartisan cooperation among all levels of government, labor and the private sector, we finished the recovery work at the World Trade Center site ahead of schedule, under budget, and with no additional loss of life. This happened while the search for the remains of our loved ones went forward with dignity and honor. We created a temporary memorial in Battery Park, where the sphere sculpture from the World Trade Center Plaza now sits. Next Wednesday, during the 1-year commemoration of that fateful day, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and our Secretary of State, Colin Powell, along with the heads of state from around the world, will join a ceremony there. At that observance, an eternal flame will be lighted near the base of the sphere in honor of those we lost, and to show that democracy and freedom will always endure. We also honor those we lost by building a better city for the future. With Congress' help, we are doing just that. Largely due to an economic incentive program which you have funded, many companies that were displaced plan to rejoin those, such as American Express, Merrill Lynch and Dow Jones, that have already moved back and made long-term commitments to staying in lower Manhattan. Because of a residential incentive program you have funded and because lower Manhattan is a great place to live, more than 90 percent of the housing in lower Manhattan is currently occupied. And the federally funded liberty bonds program will spur billions of dollars in construction in lower Manhattan for new commercial spaces and housing. The Federal, State and local governments have forged a genuine partnership to revive lower Manhattan and to rebuild our essential transportation, telecommunications and energy structures. Just last month, FEMA granted us unprecedented flexibility to spend Federal funds to create a transportation center for the 21st century that will make lower Manhattan more accessible than ever. The future of lower Manhattan is promising, as is the future of all New York City and indeed of the entire country. Here, our city continues to be the safest large city in the Nation. We have committed increased resources to combat the new threats we now face from enemies foreign and domestic. We've strengthened our counterterrorism and intelligence operations. And as they take on new burdens, our police department continues to drive crime down. New York has no intention of relinquishing its title of capital of the free world. New York is a city of big ideas, big projects and big events, and that will never change. For example, in the year since the September 11 attack, New York City has been host to a World Series, the New York City Marathon, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square where I was inaugurated, the World Economic Forum, a new international film festival, the Fourth of July fireworks spectacular which was telecast nationally, the U.S. Tennis Open which is currently going on, and last night's Times Square kick-off of the NFL season, where I met Jon Bon Jovi. We even held a world-class grand prix bicycle race right here on Wall Street this summer. Since we're not the type to rest on our laurels, we are trying to convince both the Republican and Democratic National Committees to hold both conventions here in the year 2004. As a matter of fact, this joint session is a perfect opportunity to go after both at the same time. How bipartisan can you be? We are also pursuing a Super Bowl and the 2012 Summer Olympics. I see Nancy Pelosi is here from our fellow Olympic finalist San Francisco: Do you want me to arm wrestle for it, Nancy? I better start training though. After all, Nancy, you are the minority whip. But that's just the kind of ambition you'd expect of this city. And, if anything, 9/11 has made us even more committed to demonstrating the energy and vibrant cultural life of our city. We will create a memorial on the site of the World Trade Center that everyone can be proud of: a memorial that not only honors those that were taken, but reaffirms the values that triumphed on that day and the days after. In our actions, in our passion, we can do great things and show that we do not allow our lives to be ruled by fear, but are guided by the very principles of democracy which you, the Congress, represent and which the terrorists found so threatening. When you look at New York today, when you look at the city where people from all parts of the world live next to each other, where more than 120 different languages are spoken and where virtually every religion in the world is practiced, you realize what makes America and what makes New York great. We thrive because of our diversity, because of our respect for one another and because a free society is a strong society. In conclusion, let me recall what our President said about that September morning. He described it as a battle between fear and freedom. By convening in our city, you, the U.S. Congress, have demonstrated to all New Yorkers and all the world that fear can never prevail as long as freedom is strong. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Please be seated. One of our Founding Fathers, an eminent New Yorker, Alexander Hamilton, wrote in the Federalist Papers, ``Energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good government.'' New York State is fortunate to have an energetic chief executive who has wisely and skillfully guided our city and State through the crisis created by the attack of 9/11. Our next speaker is the great Governor of the wonderful State of New York, the Honorable George E. Pataki. Governor PATAKI. Thank you very much, Mayor Bloomberg. And thank you for those inspiring words on behalf of the people of New York City. To Speaker Hastert, Leader Daschle, Leader Gephardt, Leader Lott, ladies and gentlemen of the 107th Congress, welcome to the greatest city in the world. It's been 212 years since Congress last gathered here, only blocks away from where we're assembled right now. It was here that America's First Congress met, here that George Washington took the oath of office and here that the Bill of Rights was ratified, protecting the freedoms of American citizens. So it is altogether fitting that you, the men and women of the 107th Congress, have returned here to affirm once more our Nation's commitment to preserving those freedoms from those who would seek to destroy them. We meet nearly 1 year after the worst terrorist attack ever launched against the United States. Our Nation is 226 years old, but the vigilance needed to preserve our liberty and to protect our democracy must be eternal. It was in this spirit, fueled by our love for America and our reverence for freedom, that New Yorkers responded in the early morning hours of September 11. And in times of crisis, there are no stronger people than the people of New York. Police officers, firefighters, court officers, port authority officers, EMTs, construction workers, volunteers and citizens from all backgrounds rushed to the scene in a demonstration of extraordinary courage and sacrifice. We met adversity with resolve. We answered terror with strength. We responded to evil with good. We defeated hatred with tolerance. Your assembling here today sends a powerful message to the people of the world, to our allies and to our enemies. Inspired by the strength, perseverance and compassion of our heroes and the people across America, our unity and our resolve has only grown stronger. We will remember. We will rebuild. And we will move forward with the unity and confidence of a free people. Our sadness from the images of destruction and our memories of those we lost on September 11 will forever be embedded in our minds. Yet when we look back on that fateful day, we will look back not just in sadness, but also with pride, in the actions of New Yorkers and of Americans across this great land, who stepped forward in our cities in our Nation's hour of adversity. And to President Bush, and to this united Congress, you stepped forward for New York and for America, helping families and helping this city to recover, to rebuild and to reclaim its destiny. You came to Ground Zero. You saw the destruction. And like so many other Americans, you responded and did your part. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I'd like to say thank you. Freedom is our legacy and our inalienable right as citizens of this great Nation. It is our heritage. It is our birthright that was established here by the First Congress 212 years ago, and then reaffirmed today by this Congress 212 years later. Your presence here today means a great deal to all Americans, but especially to New Yorkers. It shows we have not forgotten, nor will future generations of America forget. A century from now, they will know that the terrorists failed. They will know that in the face of destruction--we faced destruction with determination. We turned despair into hope. And we turned tragedy into triumph. We are united in our fight against terror. And in our defense of freedom, we are vigilant, we are strong, we are New Yorkers, we are Americans. Thank you. God bless New York. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Mayor BLOOMBERG. Fourteen days after September 11, New York's newspaper, the Daily News, first proposed New York's hosting of a joint congressional session. It wrote that such a session would be a symbol, ``of unity, strength and resolve such as the world has never seen.'' Now I would like to introduce the earliest governmental champion of that idea, the dean of New York's congressional delegation, Charlie Rangel. Representative RANGEL. You people look beautiful. Thank you, Mr. Mayor and Governor. On behalf of our New York delegation, and especially Ben Gilman, who has been my friend for over 30 years, who leaves us--where are you, Ben?, and our entire delegation, which I hope would rise at this time, the supporters of our resolution--I want to thank the leadership in the House and the Senate for supporting this resolution, Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Pataki for giving it its political support, Ms. Annenberg for giving us our financial support, and most important all of you who took time from your busy schedules, and indeed our legislative schedules, to come to our great city to give us an opportunity to say thank you. History is a strange thing when you're making it. You're just not aware of the courage you may have or the shortcomings that you may have. And as the mayor, in telling you about the attributes of New York, it could be perceived that most of us from New York City have a little more self- esteem than we really need to get by. But when we were hit, we were afraid, we were scared. We didn't know whether we were going to be hit again. And Jerry Nadler, whose district was hit, was one of the first to get there. And as Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Pataki said, people came from all over. Not just our heroic policemen and firemen and emergency workers, but kids came, flags were there, food was there, doctors were there. Everyone wanted to help. Most of the New York congressional delegation in the city were there because it was a primary day. And so when we got back to Washington, we didn't know what to expect. We went by car. We went by bus. We went by train. And when we saw our colleagues there, singing ``God Bless America,'' we recognized that we were not just New Yorkers; that we were Americans. It wasn't just our great city that was hit, it was our great country that was attacked. And we did come together, not as Republicans and Democrats and liberals and conservatives, but we came together in support of our President and our legislative leaders to let all of our foes know that we were united in our resolve to make certain that we would do all that we could to see that this does not happen again. And even now as we gather to praise those who fought so hard for our country, who became our heroes, we send a message to our enemies that it is our resolve to say once again: ``Don't tread on the United States of America; we are prepared to do whatever is necessary to seek out and to destroy those who seek to destroy our way of life.'' And we come back to where Congress met over 200 years ago, and I cannot help but be emotionally involved in believing how proud our forefathers should be of us, to come back after 200 years, and to see what we have done with their Constitution, how much we treasured it, how much we expanded it, and how much today as we meet are we prepared to protect it. How little did they know that those who picked cotton during those days, those that would come into our country to build our roads and our railroads, those who would come from foreign countries seeking religious and economic freedom, would be coming here as a part of the U.S. Congress 200 years later. U.S. history is strange because not only are we living it, but to give New Yorkers an opportunity to say thank you to our colleagues in the House means that we're saying thank you to America. We are basically saying, as New Yorkers, ``God bless this great country that gives us an opportunity to have our diversity. We will continue to believe that a part of the legacy that we are going to leave to those who follow us is that we're not going to allow terrorism to instill terror in our hearts. Our basic commitment has to be that while we would not allow an enemy to intimidate us, we're not going to allow terror to take away our basic freedoms. We're not going to strike any unknown country without knowing where the enemy actually is. The opportunities that we have been given as a people--education, Social Security, health care--we're going to make certain that, as we protect this country, we protect those civil liberties that have been passed on to us so that when the next Congress meets, no matter where they meet, they will be saying that we protected the Constitution that was given to us over 200 years ago.'' My mother, your mother, everyone always said that during times of pain you'd have to seek and you can find some good in it. But the truth of the matter is that when we were struck, it was hard to believe that we could find some good. But there was good that we found: America gave us an opportunity to say thank you to each other. America gave us an opportunity to see how blessed we were; that we could look at each other without seeing color, without seeing party label, without seeing where we came from, and recognize that we had an obligation to protect what we have. Mr. Governor, Mr. Mayor, thank you for giving us the support of bringing us together. And now we can say that we really owe a lot to each other, because we need each other. We hope this never happens again, but thank you, Congress, for helping us when we needed you, and not withstanding our attitude, we deeply appreciate the opportunity. Mayor BLOOMBERG. More than 2,800 people lost their lives at the World Trade Center, but the toll could have been far, far worse if it were not for the valor and professionalism of our local and regional firefighters, police officers and emergency service personnel. Showing tremendous courage, they effected the rescue of more than 25,000 people from the World Trade Center, the largest and most successful emergency evacuation in modem history. Their heroism inspired the Nation. Three hundred and forty-three members of the Fire Department of New York City gave their lives for freedom on 9/11. We will never forget their bravery and their sacrifice. It is now my privilege to introduce Susan Magazine. She is the assistant commissioner in charge of the fire department's family assistance unit. She is also a woman who lost her husband Jay, who worked at the World Trade Center. Susan. Ms. MAGAZINE. Thank you, Mayor Bloomberg. Mayor, Governor Pataki, distinguished Members of Congress, honored guests, I am honored to have been asked to come here this afternoon to speak with you. I came here because I think it's very important that you, our Nation's leaders, hear directly from someone who lost a loved one, a family member, last September 11. As the mayor said, my husband Jay was one of the more than 2,800 people who perished at the World Trade Center on that day. Jay and I spent our entire adult lives together. On the 17th of next month, we would have celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary. We have two children. Melissa is 14 and Andrew is 11. Melissa starts high school next week, and Andrew starts middle school. Jay was the catering sales manager at Windows on the World, the spectacular restaurant at the top of the North Tower. One of our favorite shared family memories was all of us--Jay, me, Melissa and Andrew--going up to the restaurant all wearing hard hats during the construction work to reopen Windows on the World. What a beautiful restaurant it was. When you were up there you felt like you were on top of the world. And Jay loved it. He loved working at Windows. He loved working in the Trade Center. He loved the vibrancy of downtown Manhattan. I recently attended a dinner for a hunger relief organization that Jay was involved with to present the first annual Jay Magazine Award of Excellence. The recipient of the award was Jay's friend, Michael Lomonaco, who was the chef at Windows. When Michael accepted the award he told a story about how he and Jay would meet almost every morning in the Windows cafeteria for coffee. And every morning as they were leaving, Jay would turn to Michael and say, ``You know, we're the luckiest guys in the world to be working here.'' When our kids went to visit Jay, which was often, they would look out of his office window. You felt like you could see all of New York City from there. And he would tell them that if they looked really, really hard uptown that they could see our apartment. It was so magical up there. Now, like thousands of other families, Melissa, Andrew and I are trying to figure out how to move on and how to live our lives. That doesn't mean that we will ever forget. It doesn't mean that we're trying to get back to normal. Normal does not exist anymore for any one of the families who lost someone that they loved on that day. It means that each one of us has to find a new normal. We have no choice. And my family is doing that. We're surrounded by incredible family, wonderful friends and support of communities. And we're doing it with the assistance of our neighbors, of our communities and you, our policymakers. And we are extremely thankful for all of the support that we have received from people everywhere. Let me illustrate with a personal story. Our family held a memorial service for Jay at the end of September. Jay had always been in the catering and restaurant businesses and had many friends, colleagues and clients all over the country. At that service blank cards were distributed with envelopes addressed to our children. People were asked to write down their memories of Jay, to tell us stories about the Jay that they knew. The response was unbelievable. Hundreds and hundreds of cards have come back from people who knew Jay. And then, we got cards and letters from people who didn't know Jay, but had heard about him and had heard about our family, and wanted to somehow try to connect and try and give some comfort to an individual family. Experiences like that continue to be repeated every day for the families who have been affected by September 11. As our Nation's leaders, you should know that at the family assistance unit of the fire department, we spent hours each day responding to letters and gifts from all over the country: from your States and your districts. And we respond to each one of them. We received cartons of letters from schools, camps, houses of worships, individual people from all over the country, teddy bears, quilts, pictures, books, offers of weekends away for family members, paintings, scholarships for children, songs, poems, prayers. Whatever it is that people have to give, they want to reach out to individual family members and somehow try and make a difference to each family. And these are the people who you represent. Please tell the men and the women and the families in your home districts and your States how much it means to us that so many Americans have offered us their generosity and their kindness. The events of September 11 were an attack on our Nation and they were attacks on individuals and individual families. Every one of the people who perished on that day was a husband, a father, a son, a wife, a mother, a daughter, a brother, a sister, a neighbor, a friend. Over 2,800 individual people were lost on that day. And it's been remarkable to me how many Americans truly understand that each of us were real people, were real families who have experienced this enormous tragedy in very individual, very personal and very immediate ways. Every day the people who work for the City of New York go to enormous lengths to do whatever they can for us, for the families. The city, the State and the entire Nation have given us their support. Thank you. And when you go home, thank your constituents for their kindness, for their generosity and for never, ever letting anyone forget. Thank you. Mayor BLOOMBERG. Susan, thank you. And to you and to all the families, all we can really say is, ``Those we lost are in our prayers and God bless.'' For the terrorists, the attack on the World Trade Center, as devastating as it was, was a failure. It did not accomplish what they hoped it would. It did not weaken us. Instead, it united us. It brought us together as a Nation determined to defend our freedoms and to punish those responsible for this despicable act. Ordinary Americans showed the goodness in their hearts. They responded to 9/11 as if their own home communities had been attacked. An unprecedented outpouring of support flooded into New York from across the Nation. The following video you're about to see is our way of saying, ``Thank you, America.'' (Videotape presentation). Mayor BLOOMBERG. I want to thank the Interpublic Sports and Entertainment Group chairman, Mark Dowley, for producing that video and donating their services. The power, majesty and proud heritage of the United States are expressed in our national symbol, the American bald eagle. On behalf of the people of New York City, I am pleased to memorialize this historic joint session of Congress in our city by presenting a commemorative Steuben glass eagle to the House of Representatives. Minority Leader Gephardt. Thank you on behalf of all New Yorkers. Representative GEPHARDT. Thank you so much. I accept this on behalf of all of our Members. And, Charlie, I don't think you have an attitude at all. Thank you. Mayor BLOOMBERG. The city is also proud to present a commemorative eagle to the Senate. Minority Leader Lott, would you come up to the podium, please? On behalf of all New Yorkers, thank you, sir. Senator LOTT. Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. On behalf of the U.S. Senate, we express to you our appreciation for all you've done, and for this. Senator Daschle and I will find a special place for this great eagle. Thank you. Mayor BLOOMBERG. Thank you. The SPEAKER. And Tom Daschle. Representative HASTERT. On behalf of the U.S. Congress, we have a unique gift: a token of that day, and a token of the strength of this Nation. Over the Capitol of the United States flew the flag of the United States of America. And on September 11, we took that flag down. We kept it. We weren't sure exactly how we were going to use that flag. But we think it's very appropriate today to give it to the City of New York as a memento of what this Congress believes in: the ability and strength of the people of New York. The spirit of the people of New York is truly the spirit of America. Thank you. Senator DASCHLE. On September 11, when the people of South Dakota saw what happened, they dropped everything. One ranch couple, themselves struggling right now, sold 100 head of cattle, and donated the proceeds to the victims and their families. A class of second graders collected pennies, thinking that they might be able to collect or raise a couple of hundred dollars. They raised $1,776.05. I'm sure you could find similar stories from Speaker Hastert's constituents in Illinois, Senator Lott's in Mississippi, Congressman Gephardt's in Missouri. But in reaching out to help the people of New York, we realized it was the people of New York who were helping us. Your courage helped steady a wounded Nation. So today, I join Speaker Hastert on behalf of all of those you inspired, to present you with this flag. We hope it'll find a home in the memorial you build to the victims of September 11, to let all New Yorkers know that they didn't just inspire a city, they inspired a nation. Mayor BLOOMBERG. Dick, would you come up? And, Trent, and if you could come up here as well. Thank you. Earlier, I proudly, perhaps boastfully but accurately, referred to New York City as the Nation's cultural capital. I will now demonstrate that this was not an idle boast. It is my great pleasure to introduce a great composer, arranger, conductor, musician, and in my book most importantly an educator. The winner of the Pulitzer Prize for music, and the artistic director of jazz at Lincoln Center, Winton Marsalis. (Musical presentation.) Mayor BLOOMBERG. As to my boast about culture, I will rest my case. Thank you. Well, thank you for joining us for this historic event. The Members of Congress will now exit en masse to visit Ground Zero and to pay their personal respects to the more than 2,800 people who died for freedom. Governor Pataki and I will go with them. But to facilitate their orderly departure, I would ask that all other guests please remain seated until the Members have left for the ballroom. Thank you for your cooperation. And thank you for showing your support for the greatest city on Earth. In the House of Representatives of the United States Monday, September 9, 2002 Hon. Philip M. Crane of illinois Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in the House and Senate in commemorating the victims and heroes of September 11, 2001, during our special session of Congress held in Federal Hall in New York, NY. On the days following the attacks on September 11, Americans across the country came together to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of this great country. It is in that same spirit that we stand together today--both Republicans and Democrats--to reaffirm that strength and resiliency by showing a strong bipartisan expression that we are first and foremost Americans and are committed to protecting the freedoms and values that make this country great. As we go through this week and revisit some of the darkest moments in our Nation's history, we must remember that our Nation has always been one that has triumphed over adversity. At times of great despair, America has consistently risen to its greatest hours. In remembrance of those lives lost on September 11 and to heroes that emerged on that fateful day, I would like to close with some words from President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address: that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this Nation shall have a new birth of freedom; and that this government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth. May God bless America. Hon. Bob Etheridge of North Carolina Mr. Speaker, it's hard to believe that it's been almost a full year since that awful day. On September 11, 2001, all the world saw the very face of evil. And on that day and every day since, we have felt the heartbeat of America. For me, the most enduring image of 9/11 was the sight of the Pentagon on fire after the terrorists crashed American Airlines flight 77 into our Nation's military headquarters. A thick black smoky cloud oozed from the Pentagon and hung over the banks of the Potomac River. I will never forget seeing with my own eyes that proud building engulfed in flames. Then the whole world watched television in stunned disbelief as the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center came crumbling down in a fiery wreck of twisted steel. On that day, America was changed forever. But, the test in life is not whether or not you ever get knocked down. The true test is whether you have the courage, pride and determination to get back up again. Every day since September 11, the people of this country have gotten back up. We Americans from all walks of life have pulled together like never before. We have stood united to tell our enemies that the spirit of America will never be broken. We will not rest until we have eliminated Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network. In the year since 9/11, we have come to treasure the service and sacrifice of ordinary Americans as extraordinarily heroic. The selfless devotion of the firefighters, police, EMS and other public servants in New York City and the Pentagon have given us new appreciation for our hometown heroes whose everyday service does so much to strengthen our communities. The dedicated professionalism of our men and women in uniform renew our pride in our country and make us thankful for our many, many blessings. And the incredible story of the passengers of the hijacked plane who fought back and prevented the tragic events of that day from being even worse inspires us all to take charge and give back to our country. September 11 taught us anew the immeasurable strength of the uniquely American ideal of ``We, the people.'' As we memorialize the lives lost 1 year ago, let us also celebrate the renewed spirit of America that has been reinvigorated by the service and sacrifice of so many ordinary citizens and inspirational heroes. Hon. Robert A. Borski of pennsylvania Mr. Speaker, and my fellow colleagues of the U.S. Congress, we are here in the City of New York as representatives of a United States that is bound together as never before. It is a tragic bond, as it came at a cost of immeasurable suffering to the people of this great city, and to those who lost their loved ones in the Pentagon or on flight 93 that ended in Shanksville, PA. Today we are gathered in remembrance of the events that pierced our hearts 1 year ago. On September 11, the terrible and violent acts perpetrated against our homeland took the lives of so many innocents. In the days after the attacks, the courage and strength of our rescue workers lifted the spirits of our Nation. In the weeks and months following, an outpouring of generosity from every corner of our Nation showed that we stand together. Thousands lined up to give blood in a gesture that Americans would share the essence of life with no regard for whom the recipient might be. The continuing work of the young men and women in our Armed Forces is a declaration that those responsible for such cowardly acts will not escape justice. Today, 1 year later, we can say that our wounds are healing. Our Nation has overcome a great deal, and it is unity that has helped us overcome our grief. We, as public servants, have come together to realize an even greater responsibility to our Nation. These memories are a reminder that we must remain vigilant while we rebuild and that we must never allow our greatest treasure, our liberty, to be vulnerable to the will of our enemies. We will never forget the innocent victims. We will never forget the heroes. It is with their memory in our hearts that we live each day with a greater sense of purpose and a deeper appreciation for the gifts that we in this Nation share. Hon. Peter T. King of new york Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride as an American and as a New Yorker that I commend my colleagues for taking part in this special joint meeting of Congress in historic Federal Hall. By meeting in this venerable hall in lower Manhattan--just blocks from where the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were destroyed less than 1 year ago--the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have demonstrated our Government's lasting commitment to the people of New York. And by fighting back and emerging stronger than ever, New Yorkers have demonstrated their grit, their courage and their determination. On September 11, 2001, New York took our enemy's best shot and never wavered or faltered. The police officers, firefighters and all the rescue workers who raced into the inferno demonstrated unsurpassed courage and set the tone and standard for our Nation and the world. Just as significantly, the families of the brave men and women who were murdered that day just because they went to work in the World Trade Center have demonstrated a class and dignity that defy comprehension. None of us will ever forget where we were or what we were doing when we first heard the news of the terrorist attacks of September 11--the attack on the World Trade Center, the attack on the Pentagon and the bringing down of flight 93 in Pennsylvania by uncommonly heroic passengers. Nor will we forget how our Nation rallied behind President Bush as he commanded the war against international terrorism. That war will be waged on many battlefields and in many ways for many years to come. But we know that America will prevail. It will prevail in large part because of the fighting spirit that rose from the flames and smoke which engulfed lower Manhattan. And it is that spirit that the U.S. Congress has honored and acknowledged by holding this extraordinary session in Federal Hall. God bless America. Hon. Tammy Baldwin of wisconsin Mr. Speaker, today we gather here in Federal Hall to honor and recognize the courage and determination of the survivors of the horrible terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. It is fitting that we do so. It was here in Federal Hall that the new Congress of the United States first met in 1789 to govern our new Nation. It was here in New York that our Founding Fathers passed the laws that are the foundation for our democratic political system. From this solid foundation, our Nation has grown and prospered. Our people have excelled in science, in the humanities, in art and culture. We have grown to be a great Nation, home to a great people, with tremendous hopes and incredible dreams for the future. And it all began right here in Federal Hall. One year ago, terrorists attacked America. Their targets were not simply the buildings they destroyed and the people they murdered. They were attacking the very ideals that define what it means to be an American. They wanted to drive us apart and make us afraid. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that they failed. Faced with tragedy and destruction, the people of the United States, and particularly the people of New York, came together as one community. We gathered the emotional resources to survive and heal, and we pulled together the financial resources to rebuild. This has not been easy. It takes incredible courage to move forward after a tragedy like 9/11. But we did find that courage within ourselves. That is why it is so fitting that we are here in New York today. One year after September 11, we are rededicating our Nation. The terrorists have not won. They have lost. Our Nation is stronger and more united. Our freedom, our courage, our determination, our unity, our diversity, our charity and our democracy are our strengths. New York has exhibited all of these strengths in abundance in the last year. And these strengths are everywhere in America. Hon. Jerrold Nadler of new york Mr President, Mr. Speaker, today marks a historic occasion for New York and for the U.S. Congress. This is the first Congress that has convened here in New York since the First Congress convened here to watch President Washington take the oath of office and to pass the Bill of Rights. We join here today not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans. The symbolic gesture of our joint meeting is both solemn and celebratory. It is solemn because we come here today to honor a city devastated by the most terrible single attack on American soil in our history, and the thousands of innocent people lost in that attack. As the elected Representative for the area of New York most directly impacted by the attacks of September 11, 2001, I can tell you that my constituents are grateful for the act of solidarity with New York that we show here today. I can also tell you that they are even more grateful that Congress has rallied to help this city for the past year. Our joint meeting today is also celebratory. One year ago, a group of vicious and heartless terrorists sought to cripple this city and"
