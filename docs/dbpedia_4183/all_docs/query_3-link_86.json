        "text": "Each order has a handcrafting time of 2 – 3 working days, which only begins once payment has reflected on our system as stated above.\n\nOnce your payment reflects, your order will enter our workshop to begin its handcrafting time.\n\nAfter the final day of handcrafting time, your order will be dispatched with our courier partner by the close of business. Tracking information will be sent to you.\n\nDuring the festive season, Valentine’s Day or other important celebrations our manufacturing time may be extended without prior notice due to an increase in orders.\n\nWe are unable to accommodate special requests to expedite orders or guarantee exact days on which items will arrive with you. We strive to adhere to our manufacturing deadlines and guide you accordingly.\n\nPublic Holidays: Orders are not processed, dispatched or delivered on public holidays. A public holiday will delay the delivery of your order by at least one additional day.\n\nIf your order is “in query” it impacts the turnaround time. We will contact you to clear any details or order related queries with you. The sooner this is resolved, the sooner your order returns to the workshop to continue being manufactured. If your responses are delayed or our calls and attempts to communicate with you go unanswered, we are unable to expedite the order when you do eventually make contact.\n\nThis service is available by special request only at a quoted fee or is listed per product when available. To qualify for this service all orders have to be placed with payment reflecting by no later than 10am the day prior to dispatch. The order is not made and dispatched on the same day, but rather placed and dispatched by close of business the following day if your payment reflects accordingly. This service is available from Monday to Thursday for a dispatch date within the same week. Order requests on a Friday will only leave the following week. We do not offer this option during exceptionally busy periods such as Mother’s Day and the festive season. Silvery cannot be held responsible for any delays in delivery once your order has been dispatched and left us and is in the possession of our courier partner.\n\nOrdering from Silvery:\n\nFor additional insight please review our detailed Terms and Conditions.\n\nAgreement when Placing Order:\n\nSilvery strives for excellence and in turn wants you to be happy with your purchase. Due to the nature of our business which is linked to personalisation, it is very important to be aware of our Standard Return Policy and matters related to exchanging items. Upon placing your order you are required to tick the box “I have read and agree to the website terms and conditions*” which is a mandatory field prior to being able to complete your order. It’s your responsibility to read the Terms and Conditions. We are unable to enter into discussions if you openly admit to not having read our Terms and Conditions.\n\nOrder Processing & Delivery:\n\nManufacturing and handcrafting of your order will begin processing once payment has been received and it has cleared. Payments can take up to two days to reflect.\n\nWe process orders and allocate payments once a day, therefore orders are not immediately allocated to manufacturing, even if you bank with FNB.\n\nYou will receive email notifications at the various stages of your order progress.\n\nOrder Placement Tips:\n\nPaying via credit card is the swiftest method of payment.\n\nView the emails that we send you for guidance on order progress.\n\nDelivery Address:\n\nPlease note that our courier partners are unable to deliver to P.O. Box addresses. Silvery will not be held responsible or liable for incorrect delivery details supplied by customers when checking out. When selecting our courier option, it will be necessary for someone to sign to acknowledge the receipt of the parcel upon delivery.\n\nOnce your order has been dispatched we are unable to update your delivery address. Please ensure you fill it in correctly and accurately when placing your order.\n\nCondition of Goods:\n\nIn the unlikely event that items are delivered damaged or with defects and there is no clear damage to the item from the courier company, you will be required to take photos of your items within 24 hours of receiving your goods. Photos are to be emailed to: [email protected].\n\nUpon receipt of the details we will investigate the matter. Should it be found that the items were sent to you in the condition shown upon receipt or such damage occurred in transit, Silvery will replace the items that you have ordered. If the items are not reported as damaged / defective within 24 hours of receiving them, we will not be able to refund or exchange your order.\n\nYou will be required to return the damaged items to us, upon which a new order will be sent to you. You will not be permitted to keep the damaged items."
