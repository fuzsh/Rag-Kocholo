        "text": "The intimidating gospel of our time left me crippled for over 30 years. Paul Ellis’s message of grace has been the key to my freedom. I have now boldly stepped out into a missionary adventure carrying this message.\n\n– José A., missionary, San Juan, Puerto Rico\n\nI used to suffer badly from depression and anxiety. I was an atheist and I couldn’t imagine God being able to help me. I was recommended Escape to Reality and it was Paul’s article on the good news that truly saved me.\n\n– Nath C., Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom\n\nI have been a Christian for nearly 50 years and a pastor for 10 years, but until I began reading Escape to Reality I never really understood God’s amazing grace. Paul Ellis has really opened my eyes. Now I use what I am learning to teach this amazing grace myself.\n\n– Earl H., pastor, Fort Pierce, FL\n\nThank you, Paul for changing my thinking. After 40 years of wrong preaching and problems, I am now preaching the truth found in the grace message. Your weekly email teaching surely changed my ministry.\n\n– Con B., pastor, Durban, South Africa\n\nThe Holy Spirit speaks through Paul Ellis’ writing. How do I know? He has spoken to me. When I first encountered E2R, I’ll admit I was wary; its message seemed too… appealing. But Jesus shone through the words and began to melt away my legalistic perceptions. And then it was just me and him, and I finally grasped grace.\n\n– Rachelle R., caregiver, Hunter Valley, Australia\n\nMy 30 years as a Christian had been utterly miserable because I had been taught a false grace. I believe our Father brought me to E2R. Grace taught here will blow your mind; it has mine. If you have faulty foundations then pure grace starts to dig them up and lays right foundations. I spent 15 years away from church. If I was at Paul’s church I’d be banging on his door and asking for a service every day.\n\n– Bill G., finance director, Winchester, UK\n\nI had been searching the net for my intended sermon against “hyper-grace” theology. I found E2R and got convicted about mixing grace and works in my preaching for the last twenty years. Yes, I had read books on grace before but it was through the writings of Paul Ellis that God could finally reveal his true character to me. Since then something has changed in the deepest core of my identity. Shame got replaced with “I am the righteousness of God in Christ.” What else has changed? Ask my wife!\n\n– Reinhard L., pastor, Velbert, Germany\n\nWow! I consider myself a lifelong student of God’s incredible power and grace. Although there are many preachers of grace, I have found none more articulate and clear about the message than Paul Ellis.\n\n– Michael M., real estate investor, Birmingham, AL\n\nPaul Ellis is today’s voice crying in the wilderness, proclaiming the beauty and freedom of grace in a world bound up with law. His insights have led me to a deeper understanding of what Jesus did for me 2000 years ago. His writing has demolished confusing teachings that plagued me for decades.\n\n– Mike L., MSgt, USAF (ret.), Orlando, FL\n\nGod bless you brother. You have brought me back to Jesus Christ. He is the only way! Grace has saved me. Thank you for being a teacher of grace and showing the way by the truth written in the bible! Amen! Amen! Amen!\n\n~Al Gentry, Detroit, USA\n\nI want to tell you that I am truly encouraged by your posts and your posts encourage millions of new covenant believers around the world.\n\n~ Chin San Soh Singapore\n\nMy grace journey began with your blog being one of the first i found…i find it absolutely captivating!!\n\n~Michael Reichert, Dover, USA\n\nI have learned more truth in my less than one month’s time following this blog than I have learned in 21 years of religion.\n\n~Sally Ann Fisher, Missouri\n\nIn a world that preaches mixture and law, I am left astounded and speechless by the amazing grace that Paul shows. He beautifully goes against cultural-Christian thinking to display the unconditional love of a Dad who wants us just as we are; a Dad that showers us with grace, blessings, favor and love just because we’re his. I know now that I am a child rather than a slave because of leaders like Paul!\n\n– Jessi C., college student, Yakima, WA\n\nE2R has been instrumental in my escape from the bondage of legalism and into the freedom of grace. Now my children are learning from Paul Ellis as well and I couldn’t be happier.\n\n– Krista F., homeschooling mom, McKinney, TX\n\nI love E2R. I lived under legalistic and bondage teaching for many years. Then I happened to stumble upon E2R at the perfect time in my life. I get excited every time I see an E2R email in my inbox.\n\n– Deborah L., cleaner, Hurdle Mills, NC\n\nThis may sound strange but reading new covenant messages on E2R made me feel like I’ve been born again again. Thank you Paul for re-introducing the gospel.\n\n– Luis S.J., real estate broker, Malolos City, Philippines\n\nEscape to Reality’s presentation of the good news is so simple, even a twelve year-old could understand it. Paul Ellis’s gospel is highly contagious and whole-heartedly recommended!\n\n– Omotola O., software developer, Lagos, Nigeria\n\nWhen I came across the works of Paul Ellis I wanted to cry, jump around, and dance all at the same time. Finally someone else was speaking the pure, unadulterated grace of our Lord Jesus. This is what the world needs to hear! This is what the world is hungry for!\n\n– Tori C., college student, Spokane, WA\n\nI found Escape to Reality after reading The Gospel in Ten Words. What an eye-opening view of the gospel and our heavenly Father! Now I understand that the gospel truly is Good News and I have a Father in heaven who loves me with an unending love no matter how badly I screw up here on earth!\n\n– Anne G., bookkeeper, Chelsea, OK\n\nI have been greatly blessed by E2R. The clarity of Paul Ellis’s explanations and the fixed focus on Jesus just makes me shout “wow!”\n\n– Evans D-M., businessman, Tema, Ghana\n\nI’ve been a Christian for 13 years but I didn’t truly know God until I was exposed to the gospel of grace. Thank you Paul, for proclaiming this truth so boldly on E2R! It has transformed my life and I’m forever grateful.\n\n– Opeyemi P., medical student, Nashville, TN\n\nPaul Ellis does what every great author does – he makes you think outside your box and challenges you to see Jesus in a new way. His message of amazing grace is not only clear but accurately portrays the message the apostles and Jesus died for.\n\n– Zach M., youth pastor, San Antonio, TX\n\nE2R has changed me from religious to gracious, revealing more of Jesus in my life. Kudos brother Paul!\n\n– Jeremiah M., student, Nairobi, Kenya\n\nI have been reading E2R for the past few years. I always look forward to the next post or book! Paul Ellis has a very special gift in writing. The message of the cross is all about grace and Paul captures this essence. I love that he is willing to refute those who oppose in ignorance, yet with grace and love.\n\n– Maryann P., nurse, Clinton, NC\n\nThe name of your website has been just that to me, an escape to reality. I have been a Christian for over 30 years. By God’s grace and your website, I have been able to rest in God’s amazing grace.\n\n– Robert H., store manager, Greensboro, NC\n\nBy God’s grace I discovered Escape to Reality. Paul’s presentation of the gospel message is such good news, as the gospel should be. I thoroughly enjoy his writing style and wit which keeps me engaged and always returning for more. God has given him a great gift to share with the world!\n\n– Sandy M., homemaker, Gresham, OR\n\nI was in a dark place when I found Escape to Reality.

Jesus has saved me!\n\n– Grant W., student, Cleveland, OH\n\nIn reading Paul’s writings I found that I was living under mixture. Through his ministry God has totally liberated me and now I have a far greater understanding of the gospel of grace.\n\n– Dennis E., scrub nurse, Beckley, WV\n\nI find Escape to Reality so helpful. I had asked God, “Please, help me learn more about your grace.” I had walked away out of fear and ignorance but his grace found me. I praise God for Paul’s ministry\n\n– Nicomedes C., heavy equipment driver, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\n\nBefore I found Escape to Reality, I had no peace, and I felt guilty and condemned in regard to demands of law.

I thank God for Paul’s ministry!\n\n– Santhosh, computer technician, Chennai, India\n\nI love Paul’s commonsense explanations of the Scriptures, and the way he peels away all the bad teachings that have come up over the years. So much religious dogma has entered the church making the simple gospel complicated. I appreciate Paul’s sense of humor, too, and enjoy sharing the good news with our ladies Bible study. Thanks Paul.\n\n– BJ Brown, retired, Grand Junction, CO\n\nI have been extremely blessed and greatly encouraged by the writings of Paul Ellis.

Thank you so much. The Truth is Jesus, and he will set you free!\n\n– Aimee F., Whitehall, PA\n\nEscape to Reality has been a wonderful blessing in my life. Because of the years of wrong teaching, I have needed to hear the message of grace many times and in many ways. Grace truly is the message of Truth which sets us free! I share Paul’s messages with others all the time. I have given his books to heaps of people. E2R has a far wider outreach than you can imagine. Paul, I often thank God for how he speaks through you!\n\n– Kathleen A., teacher, Wellington, New Zealand\n\nMy wife and I grew up in the traditional Christian church with its teachings of saved by grace, live by law. We have found Escape to Reality to be a real blessing. Finally, we’re hearing the gospel of grace without the religious teaching of rules and commands.\n\n– Michael D., writer, Columbus OH\n\nFor almost five years I have being reading Paul’s articles. His teachings are kind, strong, and easily consumed. Through Escape to Reality, Jesus has set me free from many fearful beliefs that I had held since childhood—doctrine and Christian ideology that had me tied up in knots. After I stumbled across E2R, the lies began to unravel and I was exposed to the fantastic, enormous grace of Jesus. I am eternally grateful for Paul’s role in helping me discover the truth.\n\n– Connie-Louise A., public relations, Toowoomba, Australia\n\nE2R has been such an encouragement to me. It has helped me change my entire perception of how to successfully walk this new creation life and, in turn, relate that to my congregation. Lives are being changed! Thanks Paul for all that you do!\n\n– Andrew B., pastor, Fenton, MI\n\nWhen I first began to understand the grace of the gospel of Jesus, I found that there were some scriptures that seemed contradictory. Paul Ellis tackles these difficult verses head-on and explains them through the lens of grace. I am extremely grateful to Paul for helping me to get a revelation of grace that makes more sense than any law-based message ever did.\n\n– Bryan B., software engineer, Fort Worth, TX\n\nPaul Ellis and his books and blog are great blessings, especially with my questions about God, grace, and Christianity.

I am 70 in 2 years, but am being set FREE from all sorts of bondages. Thank you God. Thank you Paul.\n\n~ Linde Nicolay, Preston, UK\n\nThank you all @ Escape to Reality. I have spent my life until this point under self persecution/shame and condemnation over the lack of proper theology on grace/works. But… over the past week I’ve read every article and searched the word and now my faith is more alive then ever, I actually “feel” as if I’ve been saved, before it was head knowledge, but now it’s heart assurance! Thank you so much for being obedient to the faith and withstanding the constant religious backtalk from people like my old self. Grace to you and yours!\n\n~ Jonathan Gould via Facebook\n\nThere is one problem I have with your blog – I can’t stop reading it! I was up half the night last night sharing your blog with some of my minister friends. Man, we are greatly blessed. I can tell much time has been put into your blogs because every word is potent. Whenever I go to the verses you refer, it causes me to not only believe in grace because of your blog but because it’s in the bible. Thanks again.\n\n~ Presley Watson, Hartselle, USA\n\nI just want to thank you for all your writing and posts. I’m always very alert to your posts, because I know that it will be inspiring and revealing. Just want you to realize that you do make a difference or your yielding to the Holy Spirit in you as you would probably say. Keep the good work and may God bless you and your family in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n\n~ Mike Davis, Fayetteville, USA\n\nHi Paul, I really love your site, and have learned a lot. You are gifted at nailing ‘sacred cows’… Keep on with your excellent ministry-we all need to be challenged!\n\n~ Ken Eden, Teignmouth UK\n\nPaul what can I say- you have surpassed yourself with this blog, it is so refreshing to read “truth” and let’s talk confession, without getting into a debate! You have given expression to letting go of pride by “chucking out” all your pre conceptions and to heck with what man will say because I taught and preached the opposite for years. It does not take guts to do what you have done: It takes a true deep love for Jesus and He expressed himself in this blog through you. Awesome, thank you my friend. I just love this website and I have sent the address worldwide, especially darkest Africa. Keep going Paul and a heartfelt thank you for the true Gospel message.\n\n~ Keith Blond, Durban, South Africa\n\nThank you, Paul, for another post full of grace and truth!! I found E2R when I was desperately searching for the correct interpretation of 1 John 1:9 several months ago. I have been in many “Christian” churches throughout my life and I have been taught wrong in every one of them. They all mix in law and condemnation with grace to one degree or another. Thanks to your faithfulness I am finally understanding the truth. I am 56 years old. Because of the wrong things I have been taught since childhood, I developed severe depression and OCD/scrupulosity. You may well have saved my life from a tragic end. Bad doctrine badly hurts sincere seekers, but the Truth really does set us free. Thank you, my brother!!\n\n~ David Goodreau, North Scituate, USA\n\nMy son found your site when he googled after hearing his dad make a comment on a verse from a song being sang at a memorial service. You guessed it, the phrase ‘He gives and takes away’. My husband noticed that the verse doesn’t make sense. I am so glad men (I generally believe so) are so not religious because we found your site because of that observation!!! For 2 years now, the Lord has been opening our eyes to see how religious the church as we know it has become and He has been teaching us about His love and it has been exciting as well as lonely at times because we can’t find too many who could understand what we are seeing that sometimes I couldn’t help wondering if we’re off the truth. I’m so glad we found your site. You outline the points you are trying to make so well. Thank you for taking time to write.\n\n~ Janet Medalla, Cebu, Philippines\n\nI love the simplicity of this blog and I love the simplicity of the gospel. We have it all through Jesus and are complete in Him. Amen!\n\n~ Vic Cameron, Carstairs, UK\n\nThanks, Paul! You make sharing the Good News so easy. I am able to share the Gospel with my sphere of influence just by sharing your posts. You make it easy to understand and it is written to regular folk! Be encouraged… you are a blessing to the world! Abundance of Grace is yours today and always!\n\n~ Chris Esters, Charlotte, USA\n\nThese posts are awesome. This is what we need on Facebook – the truth. Bless you. Look forward to more posts and have shared several on Facebook. I live in Redding and go to Bethel…Pastor Bill Johnson. 🙂\n\n~ Paula, Redding, USA\n\nHappy Birthday (E2R)!!!! You don’t know how much this site helped me and is still blessing me! Keep them coming 🙂 You are truly a blessing!!! Blessings to you always!!!!\n\n~ Susan Vivas, Cayman Islands\n\nPaul, your material is excellent and very timely, since the church today seems to be growing ever more “religious”. The pendulum appears to have swung the other way for now, but thank the Lord, sites like yours are sprouting up to offset the ‘leaven’. Please keep the articles coming!\n\n~ Ken Eden, Hungerford, UK\n\nGracias SENOR por tu gracia.\n\n~ Marco Diaz, Las Vegas, USA\n\nI have been greatly blessed, my heart rejoices because of what God did for me. What a wonderful Savior. Thank you for explaining it so well. I found this site at a time when a Pastor told my husband to come in the church and confess all his sins. I asked him, why do you have to confess what was forgiven and forgotten by God? I will share this site with my husband and we will go through each scripture verse. God bless you.\n\n~ Lilyan, Toronto, Canada (5 Jan 2011)\n\nPaul, you put it so beautifully! I can’t get enough of this message:) I only wish I had the words to share as you do with my friends and fellow believers. Thanks for doing this site!!\n\n~ Judi Hinson, Ocoee, USA\n\nThank you, Paul, for the messages of God’s grace that you bring to us. That Jesus finished the work on the cross once for all is truly THE good news. Amen. Abundant love, peace and grace to you all.\n\n~ Dave Rumfelt, Stockbridge, USA\n\nJust want to say, thank God for you, Paul! In the internet it is easy to find misleading information, which together with a fleshly mindset, focuses us on our sin and our own ability to try to live righteously. Trying to live by the law brings death. However I am glad that God led me to find your website, which reminds me to focus on Jesus, who is the Way, the Truth and the Life! Do keep on blogging, because it encourages me, which in turn helps me encourage others to look to Jesus!\n\n~ Benjamin Seow, Singapore\n\nHi Paul, Thanks for these great truths! Clear as Jesus! I like that!\n\n~ Mike Laabs, UK\n\nHi Paul, I was just searching the web to find some background information for a sermon on the Church of Laodicea. So blessed to come across your articles and discover someone who views things from a GRACE position. God bless you and keep blogging.\n\n~ Richard Kerridge, Melbourne, Australia (13 Nov 2011)\n\nProfound! Powerful! Well written! Paul you are a trained warrior… The Holy Spirit is giving you some awesome insights into the depths of Grace and Righteousness, thanks for your obedience in sharing them with us. Loving your stuff my friend, keep them coming!\n\n~ Andre van der Merwe, Johannesburg, South Africa\n\nTHANK YOU for this Paul…You were always instrumental in getting my head around problem areas for me and praise God and how amazing that you are continuing to do so. Don’t think I ever thanked you enough and doubt that you even knew so I am thanking you now. Much love to you and Camilla.\n\n~ Shirley Jenkins, London, UK\n\nI just visit E2R every morning, even if it means revisiting previous posts. That’s great of you Paul Ellis. Keep it up. Be encouraged.\n\n~ Kintu, Kampala, Uganda"
