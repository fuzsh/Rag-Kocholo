Currently, Bill services as the District Youth Service Chair. He has also been active volunteering in many ways including SCORE and the Eddy House.\n\nRotary has a long history of providing service to youth. Each year, more than 300,000 young people participate in Rotary programs like Interact, Rotary Youth Exchange, and Rotary Youth Leadership Awards (RYLA). Many club and district mentoring programs, immunization efforts, job training programs, literacy projects, and other initiatives also help young people or other vulnerable populations.\n\nUnfortunately, no organization or program is invulnerable to abuse or crises. They can and do occur in even the most seemingly positive settings. Predators often seek teaching, coaching, or other positions that give them access to children and teenagers. Others who are committed to working with youth sometimes find it hard to believe that some adults will abuse the trust placed in them,so they may not notice the signs. Rotary takes youth protection very seriously, and it relies on Rotarians to foster safe environments that prevent abuse and to respond appropriately when it occurs.\n\nJanuary 9, 2019 Program: Rotary District 5190 Youth Protection Policy 2019-01-09 08:00:00Z 0\n\nDecember 2, 2019 Program: Andy Gebhardt, Truckee Meadows Water Authority\n\nAndy Gebhardt, Director of Operations & Water Quality for Truckee Meadows Water Authority, provided an overview of the Authority's operations and mission to provide clean water to its growing service area.\n\nTruckee Meadows Water Authority (TMWA) is a not-for-profit, community-owned water utility, overseen by elected officials and citizen appointees from Reno, Sparks and Washoe County.

Yet, if this small commitment is practiced consistently, will bring about a positive change in your life. Pfilates is a combination of both Yoga and Pilates moves that generate proven efficient and productive results.

Everyone has a unique story behind it, sometimes simple, and sometimes very heartfelt and complex. He loves each and every one of the meanings behind his clientâs pieces.\n\nTattoos and tattooing in general has taken a huge turn in society. It has become a legitimate contributor to the economy and the business world. High level professionals are wearing beautiful pieces of work underneath an exterior of their professional lives. The concept is poetic on its own. People are expressing themselves with tattoos because they feel comfortable with the acceptance in their lives.\n\nMark will share with us expressions tattoo artists today are taking with their work - realism, water color, pop artâ¦a precision art that has been honed through years and years of dedicated passion.\n\nFebruary 14, 2018 Program: Mark McKinnon, The Passion Behind Tattoos 2018-02-14 08:00:00Z 0\n\nFebruary 7, 2018 Program: Washoe County District Attorney Chris Hicks\n\nChristopher J.
