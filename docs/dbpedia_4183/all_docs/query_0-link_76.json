UNCLE ROSS' was not a relative - it was an honorary title because he was such a beloved man. He was truly 'a gentle giant' being tall, rather lumbering and with huge shoulders 'n long arms. Everyone loved him very much. He liked to go to Brite's Spring - SE of town and spend the summer in a very old, 2 room log cabin on the banks of Flat Creek where crawdads and crows and wildflowers were his neighbors. When I was young, I never could keep the family-relationship-titles correct; Many in the family picked up on my childhood mistake and endearingly called him: 'AUNT ROSS' (and his wife was 'Uncle Mable'.)As Uncle Ross aged, his hearing failed and he carried a vintage brown-metal, battery-operated hearing aid in his shirt pocket with a wire tendril hanging from his earpiece. It was always more fun to 'TRY' to converse with Uncle Ross when the aid was not in use; THEN, you could act out the messages, like telling him: 'Don't miss your favorite Boxing Show on TV!' (I'd dance around the room with my fists up and he would roar with laughter, never mind what I was trying to explain!)He had a short fruit tree at the end of his garden. Once, Uncle Ross took me by the hand and led me to the small tree, picked me up in his arms and pointed to 'a little home in the tree' - it was a robin's nest, plastered inside with tan mud by the expert craftsmanship of wings 'n tail feathers; it also held a pair of pastel eggs. The most profound memory I have of him -- I was about 7 or 8 years old, sitting on a small footstool listening to him tell adventure-like stories about being a youth riding a steam train out West. Then, he leaned down to me perched on the stool, cupped my face in his care-worn hands and intoned very seriously that I was to 'REMEMBER'. Then, Uncle Ross Blankenship recounted seeing 'a White Buffalo'. It was viewed from his train window somewhere far away and long ago - just some distant place out on the plains. Uncle Ross knew the rare, colorless beast was 'Sacred to the Indians'. He also believed witnessing it was such an important event, it should never be forgotten. HE told ME - and even today - the story continues because now YOU know too...- Someone Who Cares...26 Dec. 2008 Census\n\nNote\n\nPhyllis Long\n\nPhoto\n\nJay Trace BOWEN, Ancil V.

Memories written by Juanita Hudson, daughter of Shirley (Childress) Hudson, found on findagrave.com. - First of all my name is Juanita Hudson (maiden name). I am Shirley (Childress's) eldest daughter. She was a daughter of George T. Childress son of Dan Childress, Nettie's husband. So that would make Nettie my great grandmother. We lived in the Kansas City area when I was a small child, about 2-3 times per year our family would travel to \"the Ozarks\" to visit relative's there including Nettie and Dan. I was very young when Dan died but I do remember him. What I remember most is about the way they lived. They lived in basically a 2-3 room house which sat in a hollar with a spring fed creek running right behind the house. You could walk out on the back porch (stoop) and practically be at the creek. The house was sloped down from the narrow and winding ozark road. They took their water from a pipe that was directly fed into a spring that fed the creek. The pipe wasn't that long, you had to walk to the pipe to get the water. The spring water was cool delicious. Everyone drank water from a bucket with an old ladle. No one seemed to get ill from drinking from the same ladle. There was an outside bedroom if I recall that had an exterior door off the front porch. I don't recall ever going into that room. Maybe once I slept in there when I was very very young. In the main room in the house stood an old \"pot-bellied\" stove. If I recall she had it going everyday no matter what the season. I remember her spitting into that stove. I \"think she dipped a little snuff now and then\". I still smell the aroma of wood burning deep in my mind as I write this. Her son Homer Childress was always there when we went to visit. He was interesting and loved to make paper boats. Which we as children liked. What child wouldn't like a paper boat to float in the creek? One time I was snooping around and I let their chicken's out. That was the only time I remember Dan correcting me. I know they had other animals but the only ones I remember were chickens. I loved going to grandma and grandpa's house by the creek. Note\n\nPhyllis Long\n\nPhoto\n\nJay Trace CHILDRESS, Ruby V.
