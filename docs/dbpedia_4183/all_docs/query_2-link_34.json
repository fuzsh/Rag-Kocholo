        "text": "2019\n\nDewain Barber Given New Honorary Title: Dean of Scholastic Chess!\n\nWritten by WGM Jennifer Yu Simul\n\nAugust 3-6, 2019\n\nWGM Jennifer Yu, current Champion of the US Chess Women’s Championship, conducted a FREE 23 board Simul to begin the US Open in Orlando, Florida on Saturday, August 3. Participants were players from the Denker, Barber and Haring National Girls Tournament of Champions (Haring NGTOC) with up to seven participants from each of the three events. There was a special guest participant: Minnie Mouse. All the participants and parents had their pictures taken with the lady from the “Mouse House.” There were no wins. Because of the high ratings of the players there were 9 draws. One was to Minnie Mouse who was coached by WGM Jennifer Shahade. Minnie had to leave early because she had a lunch date with Mickey at the Cheese Factory. Congratulations to the following players: Best Game-Hayes Goodman (RI) and Longest Game-Cindy Jie (FL).\n\nGame Analysis and a Meet and Greet\n\nThe Texas Tech University (TTU) students, WIM Iryna Andrenko, a graduate in Horticulture Science, GM Andrii Baryshpolets, graduate in Agricultural & Applied Economics Ph.D. and Jennifer Yu were available for game analysis and a Meet and Greet party for players. WGM Jennifer Shahade, 2 time US Women’s Champion and US Chess Women’s Director was also on hand to meet the players and help with game analysis.\n\n2018 Barber Results\n\nWritten by Dewain Barber\n\nAugust 3-6, 2018\n\nCongratulations to CM Robert Shlyakhtenko (CA-S), rated 2394 who scored 5/6 for a tie for First Place. He received the $5,000 College/University Scholarship to the school of his choice on tie-break provided by the Barber Fund. The other Co-Champion was FM Jason Wang (OH). There was a seven way tie for 3rd Place involving FM Shunkai Peng (OR), NM Danila Poliannikov (MA), CM Samrug Narayanan (MN), NM Dimitar Mardov (IL), NM Raghav Venkat (FL), NM Gus Huston (NY) and IM Arthur Guo (GA) with a score of 4.5/6. There was a field of one IM, 2 FMs, 2 CMs and 10 NMs.\n\nNM Dimitar Mardov (IL) was the winner of the $500 Barber K-8 Camp Award for best result under the age of 12.\n\n2019 Barber Standings\n\nSee the full article in US Chess Story\n\n2018\n\nDean of Scholastic Chess\n\nWritten by Dewain Barber\n\nSeptember 8, 2018\n\nAs I sit at home thinking about all of the activities that took place at the 2018 US Open in Middleton, Wisconsin, I “Awonder” if it was skill or luck. Thank you to Awonder Liang for playing in the 2013 Barber Tournament of K-8 Champions as a young person. This year he became a Grandmaster and presented a simultaneous exhibition for participants in the Denker, Barber and National Girls Tournaments. This event was part of the opening activities of the 2018 US Open.\n\nThe story really began back in 1984 with a phone call that changed my life. We all will have these moments, but I could not have imagined back then all that would happen. I received a call from GM Arnold Denker, who was later to be named the Dean of American Chess. GM Denker simply said to me, “I want to do something for the kids.” At first, I thought he was going to donate his time to do a simultaneous exhibition or volunteer to pass out trophies at one of the Nationals. But as it turned out, he wanted to do a whole lot more than I expected.\n\nHe provided an idea or two suggesting an event that brought together every state high school champion. The question was how to select deserving players who would want to travel to this event. Would it be the highest rated player who qualified? Would it be based on age or something else?\n\nAs it turned out, we agreed to invite the champion from the high school tournament of each state to play. But, when? Since I was acquainted with the scholastic schedule, I knew that many of the months that might be considered would be out. Fall was the start of the school year, winter would present problems with travel, and spring was devoted to competing in state events and the Scholastic Nationals. The end result was a decision by both of us that summer would work best. But, where? There were few scholastic events available during the summer because most families were on vacation. This would mean starting a new event with no support. Arnold suggested the US Open as a possible site. He had been US Champion and had played in the US Open for many years so it seemed a possibility. The US Open was a very prestigious event with many strong players at all levels and ages wanting to compete so the fundamental question was, “Would the US Chess Federation accept a bunch of high school kids playing at their event?” Maybe yes, maybe no.\n\nBecause GM Denker was well known to the adult chess community and the Delegates, he created a motion that I co-sponsored and the delegates agreed by acclimation after he said the words, “This is good for chess.” This action created what is today known as the GM Arnold Denker Tournament of High School Champions.\n\nThis event has hosted 1,011 high school players, fourteen of which have gone on to become Grandmasters. One of those GMs was Alex Fishbein who won the first Denker event in 1985. What is unusual is that this year he played in the first National Senior Tournament of Champions in which he tied for first. In addition, Alex’s son, Mitch played in this year’s Denker! The Denker Legacy is alive and well.\n\nFour events have followed this initial Invitational offering: GM Polgar Girls, Dewain Barber Tournament of K-8 Champions, National Girls Tournament of Champions and the National Senior Tournament of Champions. It has been quite a story over these last 34 years. I have been pleased to have been a part of this Legacy with the sponsorship of the US Chess Federation. I would also like to thank the US Chess Trust for their support.\n\nThe future is very bright for Scholastic Chess. We are all poised, youth and adult, to fulfill the mandate given to us by the Delegates of US Chess when they revised the mission of our Federation to focus on education of both youth and adults. To carry out the change in the mission mandated by the delegates, in the words of our Executive Board president, Allen Priest, “We have a legal and moral responsibility to change.” This movement of change to an educational organization for all ages started in 2008 with the delegates’ mission restatement. It continued with the filing of revised Articles of Incorporation in 2009. And the IRS recognized the change by granted US Chess 501(c)3 status in 2014, retroactive to 2009.\n\nTo further support this change, all we have to do is look at what Allen saw when he visited the US Chess Championship in St. Louis. He stated, “This is a very American Event with merit and opportunity for American participants who represent a diversity from around the world. We are an American institution. Just visit one of our National events and you can see who we really are.”\n\nI have no problem embracing this future. As a retired school teacher with 30 years of experience, I had the pleasure of hosting a chess club at my school. During one of those years we had been planning to attend the US Chess National Junior High Championship when I received a note from the office to see the principal. I stopped by his office and was informed the trip was off. I was shocked to learn the reason why: The US Supreme Court had ruled that all public schools could not have events that were not “curriculum-based”. I then went into the Curriculum of the California Common Core State Standards and located 14 statements that supported what chess teaches. I presented the information to the school board of my district and our chess club was designated a “curriculum-based” chess club, the first in California to be given that designation. We were then able to take our trip. Chess can be an important educational component if the chess advisor chooses that direction.\n\nIn their Mission Statement one of the core values of US Chess is “Education. Chess is an educational tool aiding in the learning of planning, cause and effect relationships, pattern recognition, and research, all key skills for success in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics).”\n\nAnother area of concern is the development of a strong Scholarship Program for Youth. President Priest said, “We now have in place a program that can support scholarships that are earned by scholastic players.” I look forward to working to assist with this goal. I hope that many colleges/universities continue to support scholarships for our chess youth. In addition, we need to seek out donors who clearly see that by donating to the US Chess Scholarship Program, we will be using these funds to support this goal. These funds will be separated and maintained for the future.\n\nI would like to thank the Executive Board and Delegates of the US Chess Federation for honoring me with the title: “Dean of Scholastic Chess”. I will continue to work with everyone to promote scholastic chess.\n\nFlorida, SoCal and New York Tie for First in Team Competition\n\nCongratulations to Florida on their First Place tie-break finish (13/18) with a team average of 2138.

If you want to know why this man has been so determined, read his story about Sergei Sazonov below. I cannot recall meeting someone so skilled at weaving a story, so the answers I recorded on the printed page below cannot do him justice. I can accurately tell you this. He does chess out of love. He does it for free.\n\nPT: So, tell me about a junior high teacher who up and decided to change youth chess in America.\n\nDB: Way back in the last century my principal said he wanted all the teachers to have an activity on Friday afternoon. I finally settled on a games club…checkers, chess, monopoly…sharing an opportunity to play different games…It became the chess club…I ended up providing time during lunch hour and the break in the morning. This was around 1972-73– Bobby Fischer time. The kids wanted to take it to the next level. I didn’t know what the next level was. In 1974, I went to a meeting at the Orange firehouse (a retired building) and met a few scholastic chess organizers. I became the rookie in the newly organized Orange County Chess Association. We hosted a free scholastic chess tournament K-12, playing only kids in your own grade. The kids enjoyed themselves. There were no championship trophies 3 ft. high.\n\nPT: What else can you tell us about that time?\n\nDB: We needed chess sets. Leo Cotter at Mission Viejo High School said there was a guy in Massachusetts, who sold them. So, we called Steven Dann. “Can you provide me 20 sets.” “They only come in boxes of 40. You must buy 40.” Twice the number we needed. They were a dollar a set with free shipping. “Man, that’s a lot of money. I have to check with my wife!” (in charge of finances) We would charge a dollar a set. As for the boards, that became an adventure. Leo told me, “We have thin vinyl stuff for 20 x 20 chessboards. We can make chess boards by silk screen.” My wife asked, “You have a roll 48” wide 20-30 ft. long. How will you do that?” “I’ll get my straight edge.” So here I am with my box knife…On my hands and knees I made up 50 pieces of material…got the silk screen…went to the high school…I’d never used it before nor had Leo.…We put ink on, etc., white and dark squares were solid green! We failed to ask how to do silk screening! We improved to blotches, then finally got it right.\n\nNow our problem became 150 orders. Dollar a board, dollar a set. We had only 40 sets. Dann sent some more. We started to sell chess equipment to schools. Then people asked, “What’s a good book?” “What’s a good clock.” I didn’t know what a chess clock was in 1978. We found Jerger clocks in Germany. Our production of sets increased. My wife said we had to start a company. So, in 1982 we started American Chess Equipment.\n\nPT: Do you still do that as well?\n\nDB: We sold the business to Shelby Lohrman. We had $530,000 in sales that last year and never got out of our 3 car garage.\n\nPT: How were you enjoying chess back then?\n\nDB: I took teams to the national championship. I taught at Buena Park Jr. High School. That original tournament we started 43 years ago is still running. I make sure to return every year to direct it. There was this episode with the Supreme Court case. I was about to take our team to the national junior high championship. The principal said I couldn’t take the team as it was not authorized by the school board. We were not an official group according to a court case, and we were not curriculum based. I went through the California state curriculum for mathematics and cited line by line the deductive reasoning section. We were allowed to go…the first chess club in California to do so.\n\nPT: Were there others that helped out in a big way?\n\nDB: Yes, we named that tournament the Morrison Scholastic after Bernard Morrison, who was originally from New York. He was 80 years old when I met him. He would always call me up and tell me, “You’ve got to get excited.” I would drive him to and from after school programs where he taught chess as a volunteer. I always thought that if I could do 20% of what Bernie did for chess I would consider myself successful. About 50 years later, I think I’ve caught up with him.\n\nPT: How did things go from there?\n\nDB: In 1985, I, living in Anaheim, got a phone call from a lady in Florida. “I want to start a chess program at my school. I’m a teacher. Tell me What do I have to do?” I replied that there were about 500-600 hours of instruction involved down the road, but her first step should be to put a note in the school bulletin to come to Room 20. She called back. “Another question. What do I do with the 80 kids?” That’s when I sat down and wrote A Guide to Scholastic Chess. It’s been revised 11 times. Tim Just is the most recent editor. It’s always been free of charge and can be found online. It’s been sent to 40,000 school teachers, administrators or districts. From the simplest initial questions: “What do I do first?” “Do I need to know chess?” It was in such a language that a non-chess player could open the door. That was the key answer: just open the door. The kids will do the rest.\n\nPT: How did you get involved with Arnold Denker?\n\nDB: (he pauses) I get emotional when I talk about it. A friend of mine never leaves the stage at the opening ceremonies. If I get choked up, he’ll take the spot.\n\nArnold called me on the phone. I didn’t know him. I wasn’t the USCF president. I was just a guy. He was direct: “I want to do something for chess.” I figured he meant a simul or a talk. He wanted to create a brand new event. Questions came up. What time of year is best? The schedule is crowded. We could do a tournament, bringing together all the state champions. Where? Arnold suggested the US Open. In my mind, a bunch of old guys would not be tolerating a bunch of kids at the tournament. Arnold replied, “I’ll take care of them. You take care of the scholastic committee.” In 1984, at the US Open, I met with the scholastic people who wanted to give it a try. The motion appeared on the floor of delegates. I got up and explained that we’ll have a championship of champions. Dead silence. You have to understand that back then that most of the delegates had no connection to scholastic chess. It was adult this adult that. Arnold got up. “This is good for chess.” Then he turned around and walked away from the mike…no rah-rah speech. The question was called and every single hand had been raised…unanimous approval. I was thunderstruck. Then Arnold told me to write the rules. One child from every single state plus parents. I wrote 13 rules. 27 Kids from 26 states came. I required that the host state provide an alternate to play any state champion who would have gotten a bye. No champion should get a bye. We needed to go from the original five rounds to six on a 1-2-2-1 schedule over four days so the kids could play in the US Open. Arnold donated $100 to every participant who completed the tournament. The Chess Trust stepped up to donate a $500 prize fund.\n\nPT: Did it catch on right away.\n\nDB: One player didn’t come because the participants weren’t high enough rated, but we still went from 33 to 38 states, then 40 and 46, and finally all 50 states.\n\nPT: So, it has been a huge success.\n\nDB: Question trivia how many persons have played Denker since 1985 to 2016 –1038!! Plus 48 this year. Follow up question. How many became GMs–10. The first Denker winner was future grandmaster Alex Fishbein.\n\nPT: Where did UTD come in?\n\nDB: The University of Texas Dallas contacted us. Actually, Tim Redmond contacted us. “We like what you’re doing in the Denker. We’ll offer a 4 year all expenses paid scholarship to the Denker champion.” That’s about $140,000 in today’s money. We had a 4 way tie one year! I held my breath. No way we would get that. They contacted us: “Gentlemen ALL of you have scholarships to UTD.” The Denker matured with the quality of players. IMs are entered now. 16 or 17 masters now, 24 last year. 3 IMs.\n\nPT: That takes care of the high school tournament. How did the rest come about?\n\nDB: As the tournament prestige built up, we started getting calls from parents of 7th and 8th graders. “My son is the best. I want my kid to play in the Denker.” No, just high school. So, Arnold and I talked it over….why don’t we have a grades 6-8 tournament (Jr. high tournament) plus K-6. All different schools had different definitions of grades. I decided to go to the delegates for a K-8 tournament. 7 years ago. I went before the delegates with a K-8 tournament. Arnold got up once more, and once more his speech was “This is good for chess.” In the back of the room there was a motion to amend. I didn’t like the sound of that. From Minnesota David Kuhns go up and said, “I want to name it the “Dewain Barber K-8 Championship.” I was overwhelmed.\n\nImage\n\nPT: What else pops into your mind from those years?\n\nDB: In 2009 I got the list of participants who would be coming. All of a sudden, I noticed the name Abby Marshall. There were a few girls before 2009 for Denker. Abby was special at Orlando in 2009. We noticed the girl moving up the tables to board one in round six. For several rounds, she was a King’s Gambit player!! Had the boys bamboozled. They didn’t know how to handle it. She won the 2009 tournament. Abby graduated from an Ivy League school… The Denker medallions…one day I was watching the Olympics and their big thick and heavy medallions. Every one of these chess kids is a champion so why can’t our Denker and Barber champions get something so unique, solid metal with brilliant gold finish. The provider made sure it was at least 2.5 inches across with the knight taken from the “Ultimate Chess Set” which I designed. The Denker got the knight…Another time I noticed that Olympic soccer players trade their t-shirts with the other team. Wouldn’t it be nice if each kid came to play bringing six souvenirs from their city or state to give one to each opponent. What a beautiful experience to take home. We’ve done that six years now…Once 3 kids from Hawaii showed up holding their hands behind their back and said, “We’re from Hawaii. Mr. Guy Ontai (organizer of scholastic chess), wants you to have this pineapple. This year Mr. Ontai had his kids present me with chocolate covered macadamia nuts in a beautiful box. He’s fond of saying, “Never worry. Hawaii will be there.”\n\nPT: So, it’s more than just a tournament?\n\nDB: Oh, yes. One year a mother called to say that they couldn’t afford airline tickets to fly the family from Mississippi to Vancouver, Washington. I encouraged them to find a way. A few weeks later, the mom called to say they were driving all the way from Mississippi. I still wear the “Mississippi” pin he gave me. Another year a young man named Matthew Parshall from Alaska called and said that they didn’t have a state championship. Are you the highest rated? Nope. After everyone was on board with Matthew representing Alaska, he showed up. I still remember him holding the state flag like a cape. It’s never been about ratings. It’s about a young person who steps forward. Awonder Liang sent me a lovely thank you note. Never got one before that.\n\nPT: What do these tournaments teach?\n\nDB: They’re about building character, bringing the beauty of chess forward. I usually tell this story. Imagine the following scenario: old gentlemen in a rocker. Who comes in his room but his grandson. “I learned this new game pieces move around I know you’ll like it.” “That sounds exciting.” Grandfather goes into chest of drawers…”Let me show you something, grandson.” I know it will happen. Same with grandmother. Let me tell you about chess. It’s not about a bunch of kids moving pieces.\n\nPT: The girls finally get a tournament of their own. How did that come about?\n\nDB: In 2002, we were in a restaurant for breakfast in Nashville, and who walks in but GM Susan Polgar with her husband, Paul. They saw us and came over: “Tell me about the Denker. Can we do this for girls?” I became a co-author again! In support, I stood up at the delegates meeting and said, “We need to do this to promote girls’ chess.” Now, we had the Denker, Polgar and Barber. I was chair of the Polgar Committee for six years. In no time, she went to 40+ states. Then, the unpleasantness with the dispute between the USCF and Polgar emerged. Susan came to Anaheim where we had a heart to heart talk about how I couldn’t continue on her committee. She understood.\n\nPT: What happened then?\n\nDB: We had a big void financially. Texas Tech had withdrawn its financial support as well. A new woman, Isabel Minoofar from Beverly Hills stepped up and said we needed to have a girls’ events. We didn’t want to be in competition with Polgar, so, at Maureen Grimaud’s, suggestion, changed the National Girls’ Invitational Tournament to the National Girls Tournament of Champions (NGTOC). At the delegates meeting, Arnold showed up, “It’s good for chess.” I don’t think you’ll have a problem guessing a vote. I realized I had co-authored four national invitational championships. It took an hour to do it. I just kept cloning our original Denker rules. Jennifer Shahade had friends in Pennsylvania, Robert and Barbara Schiffrin. She asked them if they would agree to a $5,000 college scholarship to a college of their choice, and they consented. UTD had also withdrawn their scholarships, since, in 14 years, only four students had opted for that school. I personally provided $5,000 and asked the Chess Trust for matching funds. I am also donating $21,000 each year for four years to establish a trust for the future of the Barber Tournament.\n\nPT: How did you get to be so determined?\n\nDB: I was never a good student—pretty much average. I went through school knowing I had to read everything three times to understand it. I had to have that determination. I couldn’t quit. I went to nine summer schools from sophomore year in high school through graduate school. One year, in grad school, I had heard about Dr. Downum’s historical research course. There were only six of us there. An old man, 80 years of age, in a trench coat down to his ankles put an old, weathered, valise on his desk and reached down to pull out 3×5 cards. He laid them across the table and said, “Come up and pick a card.” “Your assignment is to list every book this person is in. See you in 18 weeks.” I looked at my card: Sergei Sazonov. So, I figured let’s get this out of the way and went to the library. I told the librarian I was looking for him. “You’re in Downum’s class, aren’t you?” No Sazonov, no Encyclopedia Britannica article, no card catalogue entry, no internet. I went back to the librarian. “It looks distinctly Russian. Check out the Russian books on the 2nd floor.” I found 400 books and had to check each index. I found him in one book, then six books more out of 430, but not much else. Then, I found a footnote in one of the books. He had written “My Life Story” for NYU Press in 1927. There were only two copies in existence in the US: NYU and Berkeley. I was in northern Arizona! We couldn’t get an inter-library loan. The book was too rare. I went to Berkeley. I didn’t have their student ID card, so they wouldn’t let me look at the book. I begged the librarian, “I have been through more pain than you can believe. I will sit ten feet away and you can watch me treat it carefully with white gloves.” She relented. I found 11 references. I said thank you and went back to Arizona and felt blessed with a B-. What is the significance of this story? I refused to quit. This is the same belief that drives me here in chess. Sazonov taught me never to quit. Years later, my wife and I, who do a lot of travelling, got off a cruise ship in Nice, France and went to find the cemetery where Sazonov was buried. We went to the main office and indicated the plot we wished to see. I wanted to pay homage to the man who had given me the determination to never quit. As we stood in the office, the man said, “The Russian Orthodox cemetery is not open today!” We had come thousands of miles for this, so we walked over to the cemetery and stood at the iron gate and peered through. I knew where it was– just on left hand side 3 up 4 to the left. I couldn’t see the inscription, but knew it was there.\n\nPT: So that’s what drove you all these years?\n\nDB: When I look back on my chess experience and career, I am driven by a legacy called Denker, and driven by a man called Sazonov. I can’t stop I’ve got to go on. Someone asked me if I get sick will I come to the tournament. I will be the only person on a gurney pushed in to the opening ceremony. It’s all about the legacy. Maureen Grimaud, and Jon Haskel know this about me. Other people, as I’ve mentioned, step up as well. Just to mention one more: Sunil Weermantry and Pete Nixon, who had teams to coach, came to the rescue at the 1987 national junior high tournament in Buena Park when the computer crashed and hand-paired the whole tournament! Eight rounds. 400 player tournament. How many people can pair by hand?\n\nPT: You must like the recognition you get.\n\nDB: Last year, I received the US Chess Lifetime Achievement award. I was surprised…it’s a lifetime and I’m still going. You know I don’t accept money…I know there are people who make a living and I’m good with that. I’ve been blessed not to have to worry about that. I always want to pay it forward. Coming back from Sidney, Australia to L.A., I played chess with two Romanian guys and told them to keep the magnetic sets we had (and I had designed)—for a price. The price was when they went home to Romania, they had to find 100 children and teach them how to play chess.\n\nPT: Is there anything we’ve missed?\n\nDB: I wrote the chess part of the script for Mighty Pawns, the movie. Wonderworks program created stories. I got a call: “We’re doing a story about three kids who get in trouble and end up in detention where the teacher says if you want to get out of here you have to learn chess. Can I send you the script?” The original writer had no clue about chess, so rewrite was necessary. We used Buena Park Performing Arts Center and the kids as extras and pulled it off. I created a tournament scene and prepped the extras how to behave as chess players. It was shown as a TV afternoon movie.\n\nPT: What advice do you have for everyone in chess?\n\nDB: Chess players can become very isolated. Meet and engage people about chess. If players are insular and don’t share, chess doesn’t advance. Volunteer teaching chess. Provide a tournament. Go to community centers. Each chess player is responsible to promote chess in their own way. Pay it forward, no matter your rating or skill level.\n\nPT: And remember Sazonov research!\n\n2017 Super Nationals - The Big Show\n\nWritten by Dewain Barber\n\nJune 14, 2017\n\nAs I boarded the plane to fly to Nashville, TN, I knew I would be attending the largest rated chess event in the world. The statistics were out and this SuperNationals would be bigger than any of the previous five I had attended. The number was really big—5577 participants!\n\nEvery four years since 1997 the SuperNationals had been held with the attendance increasing each time. Below you will find some pictures that were taken at the tournament.\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nSince this event is held on Mother’s Day weekend I decided to provide some recognition for the Chess Moms who were at the event. We passed out Golden Keychain Queens to 160 of our Chess Moms and I wished I had more Queens to give to our Moms. Thanks to Karis Bellisario, a Chess Mom from Arkansas for helping out.\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nOne of the photos taken at the tournament says, “We are all in for our chess kids.” As you can see below, exhaustion over took many a parent. Note the Golden Keychain Queen beside the sleeping mom.\n\nImage\n\nI want to take this opportunity to thank US Chess for providing the GM Denker and Barber banners. I had the chance to talk to many young people about playing in the Denker and the Barber as well as the National Girls Invitational.\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nI spent a lot of time in the skittles room at the booth that was assigned to me. I had additional Golden Keychain chess pieces and spent time playing some of the young chess stars who were in the room. My rules were simple: 1) If you win the blitz game, you receive a Golden Keychain piece. 2) If you draw the blitz game, you receive a Golden Keychain chess piece. And 3) If you lose the blitz game, you receive a Golden Keychain chess piece. In addition, I met Steven who was the 2016 Denker representative from Arkansas. We took some time and looked at the game that he had just completed.\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nFinally, I am happy to say I had a chance to see GM Timur Gareyev, the World Record holder in Blindfold Chess. I appreciate the t-shirt he gave.\n\nImage\n\n2016\n\n9-11 Chess Board\n\nBy Dewain Barber\n\nRevised September 11, 2016\n\nImage\n\nIt was a clear day in LA and the weather was comfortable. My wife, Susan had left to teach school that morning as she had since the start of the school year a few days before.\n\nAs I got up to check for orders and begin the packing process of chess equipment for some reason still unknown to me I turned on the TV and there before me was one of the worst days in our nation’s history unfolding with terrible consequences. That day 15 years ago is now known simply as 9/11 and it was upon us with tremendous ferocity.\n\nAs memorials and funerals took place for the many people who died in that disaster, I decided to do something that chess players would recognize as a remembrance of that day. I created the commemorative 9/11 chess board. I printed 1,000 copies of this board and contacted many vendors and distributors of chess equipment. I made a simple statement to them, “Please take these boards at no charge to you and sell them at your chess tournaments. With all of the money you receive, whether donations or the price you charge, send that money to the local fire departments in your communities. Tell these first responders that these donations should be forwarded to the families of those killed in this terrible event.”\n\nOn this 15th anniversary every player who purchased or gave a donation for this board should take it out and play a game in memory of those who died.\n\nI would like to make note of information that came to me shortly after I gave away these boards: That morning several of our chess instructors in the area of the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and the Pennsylvania sites were providing chess lessons for some school students. It was later learned that some of the parents of these students perished in this tragedy. As with other traumatic events in our nation’s history, we should always remember, “United We Stand and Never Forget.” A copy of this board is currently in the Chess Hall of Fame Museum in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nParking It In Chess\n\nBy Steven Burroughs\n\nJuly 8, 2016\n\nAs I rode along the street, I noticed the park on the right. As most parks go, it has a fair amount of trees and green grass to accommodate many activities. I entered the gate, and after parking I walked up to a group of tables under a shelter to set up a row of many chess boards. I opened the demonstration board, and just then Dewain Barber (age 70) handed me the tripod. The chess sets were being set up, and I was about to do something that I haven’t done before. I had invited 13 students from my homeschool chess group to come and play in a tandem simultaneous. This is not an easy task because one of the presenters was age 16 (me), and the other was age 70 (Mr. Barber). I had trust in myself at age 16, but that old guy looked like he could forget where he put his car keys. Only time would tell.\n\nAs the young people began to show up, I introduced Mr. Barber, and we agreed in advance that he would talk about the basic idea of controlling the center. I would follow by talking about development of the pieces to good squares. This worked out fine, and it was now time to play the simul. We explained to the kids that if you touch a piece, you must move it. We also told them that Mr. Barber would come to each board individually, make a move, then they would wait until I showed up to make their move. Once the kids’ faces produced the expression that a gunshot had just gone off, they understood the instructions. “You’re gonna play 13 games of chess all at once?!” “Yes, John Mark, 13 games of chess.” So the games started, and Mr. Barber shook each of the kid’s hands, and he made the first move on each board. Once he got about half way, I followed by shaking each kid’s hand, they made their move, then I would make mine. “Control the C file…”, I repeated in my head.\n\nImage\n\nIf there was one thing that I learned from Mr. Barber, it was to control the C file. Of course, after making my moves on each board, I would come back to the same board, and Mr. Barber would have made some super crazy move on the board. I’d think, “Um, Mr. Barber, I thought I had a queen on d3.” “What queen?” I guess he must have forgotten he was playing chess, and not sleeping on the couch. So we kept making our moves, and about half the kids were saying something like, “Oh, I didn’t see that knight.”, and I’d pause for a second, then I’d say, “Yes Liam, sometimes I forget about my right hand too. Move on.” Pieces on each board started to vanish slowly but surely. The look of confused faces began to steadily grow, and kings became more and more claustrophobic with the surrounding pieces sneaking closer and closer. Games started wrapping up. “That’s checkmate, my friend.” “Wow, I didn’t see that knight there on F3.” I’d say “Good game, man!” then hand them a golden queen.\n\nImage\n\nDown to the last couple of games, kids wondered who’d be the last one to survive. Up to this point, Mr. Barber and I won each game, so it became their contest to see who could survive the longest. And as I was looking over the last two boards, I noticed one player set up a very strategic defense. I then shortly found a very small mistake the player made after Mr. Barber made his move, and took advantage of it, which ended the game. With one player left, Mr. Barber and I cracked our knuckles, and focused our sights on the last player. Nobody had beaten us to this point. The last player was down material, so he needed to focus as hard as he could. We alternated turns, taking chunks of material out of the player as often as we could. Finally, a pawn passed, and it was over. All of the kids watched the last game with their golden queens on their boards. We shook the last player’s hand, and congratulated him on being the “last one to survive”. “Good game, we have our winner!” We shook his hand, and gave him… the golden king. We all agreed that we had a good time. The sun was shining, and it was a beautiful day outside. The day had only just begun, so we decided to enjoy the rest of the day, and park it in chess.\n\nImage\n\n2014\n\nA Chess Penny For Your Thoughts\n\nby Dewain Barber\n\nI just returned home from Washington State. Our trip north started in Anaheim, California, and our major stop was the 2012 US Open in Vancouver, Washington. Vancouver was a great city to host this year’s event, right on the banks of the Columbia River where Lewis and Clark traveled over 200 years ago. Portland, across from Vancouver, was equal to the task of providing a big city atmosphere for those who traveled south over the bridge.\n\nAs I walked in the park with my wife, Susan, and a friend outside the hotel thinking of the great quality and quantity of players in the US Open, the Denker, the Barber and Girls Junior events, I looked down and saw a penny. Not wanting to miss a lucky chance I picked up the penny that was face down. When I turned it over I saw the year: 1985. In everyone’s life there are monumental events that change their view and future. That was true of this penny.\n\nImage\n\nThe year 1985 was the first year of the Denker Tournament of High School Champions. This event has grown into a very prestigious event that now attracts many of the strongest high school players from around the country. The progeny of this event is the Barber Tournament of K-8 Champions which fields some of the best younger players from throughout the United States. The Barber had its first tournament in Orlando last year. I had expected about 32-35 participants representing their state affiliates, but we saw 44 show up and enthusiastically support the Barber event with Masters in the top slots of the field. I never expected Master strength players to be a part of the Barber. Likewise, this year’s Barber once again found Master strength participants on the top boards with a field of forty-seven vying for honors.\n\nNow we have a recent addition which once again caused me to reflect back on 1985. The USCF Delegates have authorized the creation of a National Girls Tournament of Champions (NGTOC) that will take place in 2013 at the US Open along side the Denker and Barber.\n\nI would like to invite everyone to the 2013 US Open in Madison, Wisconsin. It is rumored that some cheese chess hats will be available.\n\nAmerican Queen Riverboat Chess\n\nby Dewain Barber and Frank Welsh\n\nImage\n\nI have always enjoyed traveling by riverboat. My trips on the Nile, Danube, Rhine, and Mississippi Rivers have always been a relaxing pleasure. On several of these trips I have encountered passengers who also enjoyed playing chess. On this occasion I was on the American Queen steamboat that sailed from Memphis to New Orleans on the Mississippi River.\n\nAs I walked through the Mark Twain Gallery on board the American Queen, I noticed a gentleman who was seated looking at a chess set made of glass. I recognized the set and paused to see what was happening. He turned to me and commented, “I would play on this set, but the dark colored squares have lost their color and you cannot easily see the difference between the squares.” I agreed and asked if he played a lot of chess. Frank introduced himself and said, “I used to play in the past when I was in the military.” I made further inquiries, and he answered, “Here are my recollections on how I learned to play chess back in the early 1960’s.\n\nI was stationed at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kansas as a brand new Lieutenant assigned to the 381st Strategic Missile Wing. The Wing’s mission was to man, maintain and operate 18 Titan II missiles that were situated around the city of Wichita, some as far as 50 miles away. Each missile site was made up of one in-ground missile silo and a 3-story underground control center positioned about 150 feet away. Once they became operational in mid-to-late 1963, they were continuously manned by a 4-man crew consisting of two officers and two enlisted men. This was at the height of the Cold War where nuclear deterrence through a strategy of Mutual Assured Destruction (with a very appropriate acronym of MAD) was the national defense policy of our country.\n\nAnother Lieutenant by the name of Jack Cullen and I went through missile school together and became friends. It was he who got me started playing chess. So when we got assigned to our respective crews, we would check our work schedules to see when we would be pulling an alert tour, which were 24 hours long, on the same day. On those days we would be sure to take a chess set out to the missile site with us with the idea that as free time became available during the tour we would get a chess game started via normal telephone connection from silo to silo.\n\nAlthough each crew member would normally get between 4 to 6 hours of sleep during the 24-hour stay, it was not always at the easiest time to catch some shut-eye. At least one officer and one enlisted man had to be alert and ready to copy the launch message at all times. I found that planning my next chess move was a big help in keeping my mind alert during the wee hours. Usually we would be able to complete one game during the 24 hours as long as our sleep schedules were somewhat compatible.\n\nAs you might imagine, this way of playing chess did not prepare one for playing tournament chess where time was an important factor. I, for one, have always been known as a slow chess player, and I blame it on these inter-silo chess games where one could literally take hours to execute your next move. Jack and I continued this mode of chess play for most of 1964 until it became impossible due to changes in our work situations. Of course, we would try to get a game in when we were off duty whenever we could.”\n\nFrank’s story was completely unexpected as most persons learned from a brother, friend or school teacher. I told him that I had a folding magnetic set in my cabin. He agreed to play a game of chess and I made a new friend. As was pointed out, Frank was a slow, deliberate and accurate player. The game continued with me winning a couple of pawns and the game. I sent him six of my issues of Chess Life. How appropriate that we met and played chess on the American Queen!\n\nBarber Medallion\n\nby Dewain Barber\n\nImage\n\nIn the Olympics, each country is invited to participate and winners receive medallions. I created the Barber Medallion to honor all participants who represent their state affiliate in the Dewain Barber National Tournament of Middle School State Champions.\n\nI remembered seeing a show that did an interview with one of our Olympic Gold Medal winners. As the interview proceeded, the commentator asked to see the medallion that had been presented to our national representative. As he held the medallion in his hand, the commentator said, “I did not realize how heavy this is.” I thought that if we presented medallions they should not be the thin, small award that is found in many scholastic events.We needed a medallion that had some size and weight to it.\n\nI located a company that could make our Barber Medallion, but now the challenge was what design should I use? Would it be a king, rook, bishop, knight or pawn? Everyone knows the king is the most important piece in the game of chess so I started looking at different designs for the king figure. Using the chess figurine charts I came across many kings that were highly decorative and some that were ultra-modern. This simple task had now become very complicated. So, how did I decide?\n\nAt this point I decided to contact several members of the GM Arnold Denker Tournament of High School Champions Committee. I asked them to think about a design for the Barber Medallion that would look similar to the Denker Medallion provided by my company, American Chess Equipment, but have its own unique features.\n\nAs each suggestion came in, I realized that once again I was up against the challenge of what would work. Everyone agreed that the basic design should be a king, but king figures can be very fancy, especially the cross on the top. I did receive some very decorative and unusual designs, but something told me that these were all wrong.\n\nI began to think about chess sets that are used in beginning and intermediate tournaments. The Staunton design is very plain and easy for a young player to identify. Thousands of these sets are used each year for all grades especially K-8. Thus, I concluded that the design would be a simple Staunton king. Since that time, ACE has provided a Barber Medallion to every player who steps forward when his or her name and state are called.\n\n2013\n\nI'm From the Bronx!\n\nby Dewain Barber\n\nOne of the things that has always fascinated me during my chess travels in one hundred twenty countries and all the States of the Union is the people who engage in chess and their cultural identity. I would like to share one story that is true and it happened on a trip that my Buena Park Junior High Chess team from California took to the National Junior High Championships.\n\nI have always taught that introducing yourself to your opponent and shaking hands is important. It shows respect for your opponent and the game. This was the case when one of my players sat down at his assigned board before the start of his first round game. He leaned over the board and introduced himself when he said, “Hi, my name is Bill. I am from California.” His opponent shook hands and replied, “My name is Jamal and I am from the Bronx.”\n\nAt this point Bill began to ponder using his geographic knowledge. “Humm, I do not recall a state in the United States called Bronx.” As he prepared to make his first move, Bill spoke up and said, “Oh, you are from New York!” Jamal replied, “No, man I am from the Bronx, the Bronx!” Bill was taken aback by the strong reply and decided to carry on with the game.\n\nUpon the conclusion of the game Bill returned to the team table and addressed me with a question, “I met this guy from the Bronx in my last game and he said he was not from New York, but the Bronx. I am confused.” I began to laugh knowing as a history teacher this was a good lesson to teach to my young players that went beyond chess.\n\nI had them all sit down and began to explain the identity relationship that some persons have with where they live. I said, “Jamal sees his identity tied to the Bronx, a borough which is a section in New York City. That identity is very strong and no matter where he goes to live or relationships he has with other people he will always be from the Bronx.”\n\n2012\n\nA Chess Hero\n\nby Dewain Barber\n\nUpon reflecting on my nearly forty years in Scholastic Chess, I have sometimes wondered how I got to this point in my chess life. Then, I think of Bernard Morrison of Stanton, California. Bernie, as some of his friends called him, came to Southern California from Poland by way of New York and New Jersey. He arrived in the US in 1923 at the age of 18 as a musician with a passion for chess.\n\nHe raised a family, and upon retirement, he became more active in providing chess instruction in the local schools. I will readily admit that at this point I could be describing one of ten thousand chess instructors in the United States. So how was Mr. Morrison different, and a chess hero to me? Let me go back a few years to 1973 when I first met him at a meeting of all the chess organizers in Orange County, California.\n\nThe group met in the old firehouse in the City of Orange, and there in the meeting sat an old man wearing a suit and tie. I would judge him to be in his late ‘60s with quite a distinguished look. I was later introduced to him and found he was very intense and excited about kids and chess.\n\nAt the meeting we created the Orange County Chess Association and agreed that a free K-12 chess tournament would take place every year on the Saturday before Thanksgiving. Later, that event would be called the Bernard Morrison Scholastic Chess Tournament.\n\nAs I continued to work with students at my school in the chess club, I also continued to stay in touch with Mr. Morrison. He began to get up in years and had to give up driving due to several health issues, one of which was his failing eyesight. This impacted his ability to go to schools and provide chess instruction to the eager third and fourth graders who assembled in a classroom to listen to this grandfather tell stories about faraway places and a game that is hundreds of years old.\n\nOne day I was grading papers in my classroom when I got a call from the office. I asked them for the number, and I returned the call. The voice at the other end was Bernie. As he spoke I realized that he had a concern he wanted to share with me. As I listened he said, “Dewain, you will not believe the opportunity WE have! I have just been invited to a school near my home to teach chess every week on Wednesday afternoon after school.” I replied, “So, how can I help you?” I was figuring he needed some chess equipment or a one-time drop off. But instead, he asked me to drive him to the school and pick him up each week after the lesson which would take an hour. That amount of time after school every week was a challenge for a full-time teacher. I knew that Bernie was also involved in the Gifted Program in several school districts and had been working with the Braille Institute to promote chess for the blind among youngsters in Orange County. So, I reluctantly agree to help out. But, the story does not end there.\n\nI stopped by his house, not having seen him for several months, and knocked on the door. He opened the door and invited me inside. It was a home that had seen better days. As I stepped in and prepared to collect the chess equipment we would take to the school that afternoon, he said, “Come here to the demonstration board. I want to show you a position that I will teach today.” He stepped over to the demo board and I followed. At that point I noticed he had his eyes about one inch from the board reviewing the position. I was shocked. He was nearly blind, and yet he insisted on teaching these kids in a school setting.\n\nI realized then that my dedication to scholastic chess was a small contribution in comparison to this man’s continued dedication. To this day I have said to others, that if I could do even 10% of what Mr. Morrison could do, then I would be a success. He passed in August, 1983, but he is certainly my Chess Hero.\n\nBarber K-8: The Beginning\n\nby Dewain Barber\n\nMay 12, 2012\n\nWhen GM Arnold Denker asked me to assist with the creation of the Denker Tournament of High School Champions in 1984, I had many questions that needed to be answered. We were able to get the motion to create the event before the U.S. Chess Federation Delegates and it was approved. One question lingered in the back of my mind and it had to do with this comment: GM Denker said, “This is an event for High School Champions.” I asked several times the question, “What if a Grade 8 or below were to win the State Championship?” He replied, “We will select the highest finishing 9-12 player.”\n\nUsing the words, “High School Champions” is a very distinct group and back at that time stronger young players were showing their skills. Thus, we proceeded with the Denker and as it turned out that tournament has seen 847 players compete in the Denker Invitational at the US Open from 1985 till 2013. Our Denker Alumni reflects the Masters and GMs that appear today in many of our tournaments.\n\nAbout three years ago I was reviewing how we could create a “Denker style” event for the lower grades. Several parents over many years have asked us to have their child play in the Denker when their child did not qualify based on grade. I continue to support GM Denker’s wishes and spoke to several persons in the Scholastic community about several invitational events for K-6 and 7-8. We settled on a K-8 event. It was approved by the USCF Delegates and the first installment of the Dewain Barber Tournament of K-8 Champions was held at the 2011 US Open in Orlando. Besides prize funds the First Place finisher on tie-breaks for the Barber event is qualified for the World Youth Championship.\n\nI look forward to greeting the Barber K-8 Champions from each state at the US Open year after year. I know some of them will also play in the Denker event in the future. Thanks again to GM Denker for being the driving force behind a great idea!\n\n2011 and Earlier\n\nDewain’s First Chess Lesson\n\nby George Dwight Barber Jr.\n\nMy brother Dewain was first introduced to the game of chess by me. I returned from spending a day visiting our father, who taught at a Navy School in Norman, Oklahoma, where we all lived. On my visit to the Navy School, one of the sailors asked me if I would like to play some chess. After showing me how to move some of the pieces, we played a game. He won and then laughed. I learned later that he was a prankster and would use a Fool’s Mate on unsuspecting individuals. Our father heard about the prank and told me about the sailor. I was really mad and determined to learn how to play chess.\n\nAs brothers, Dewain and I have always been very close. When I got home, I told him what the sailor had done. At that point we both really wanted to learn chess. Our father bought us a chess book and set. We both studied the book and started to play chess together. This was in the fall of 1955. Dewain was 9 years old at the time. He was later to travel to his first tournament in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nWay Up North\n\nby Dewain Barber\n\nImage\n\nIn the course of my travels, I had an opportunity to visit my sister who lives in Wasilla, Alaska. As part of that trip, my wife and I flew up to Barrow, Alaska, to see the northernmost school district in the United States and visit the town.\n\nWe were given a tour of the town and a ride in the local tour bus which was also the school bus.We saw the local Mexican restaurant (to my knowledge the northernmost Mexican restaurant in the US or probably anywhere), the Bowhead whale exhibit, a location where seal meat was drying, and the Town Hall.\n\nImage\n\nI asked the tour guide if they had a chess club in Barrow and he replied, “Steve Culbertson has a chess club for his 7th and 8th grade students at the school.”\n\nAfter I returned home to Southern California, I contacted the Barrow school and ended up speaking to Steve.I asked if he would be interested in a match between his students and my students from Buena Park Junior High.He said, “Yes, but how are we going to exchange moves?”Since this was before the Internet, I suggested we fax the moves.We agreed that each week we would fax moves with 8 games to be played.No player was allowed to consult or be helped with his choice of moves.\n\nEverything progressed nicely until March when I received a phone call from Steve. He said, “Our North vs South match will have to be postponed for two weeks.”\n\nI asked, “Are you going to be on spring break, or do you have a personal problem?”\n\nHe replied, “No, nothing like that.It’s just that all the kids will be seal hunting and helping out with family chores so the school will be closed.”I was truly surprised at first, but recovered and then I wondered how I would explain this to my chess team of junior high players who lived in sunny Southern California.\n\nI got the team together and explained that the match with Barrow would be postponed for seal hunting.I dare say that it was the most unusual adjournment in scholastic chess history!Chess truly has no boundaries.In case you are planning a trip to play some chess in Barrow, you will find the temperature for February 17, 2009 to be -15 degrees F with a Low of -36 degrees F.\n\nDewain's Lecture at the Citrus College Chess Club\n\nby Stephanie \"Passion\" Mendez\n\nNovember 7, 2010\n\nOn Nov. 4th, The Chess Club had the privilege of experiencing a wonderful lecture by a wise man named Dewain Barber. Dewain is the owner and CEO of American Chess Equipment and has previously been a teacher in High School and Middle School. Dewain has traveled most of the world and over 71 countries! He was talking about playing chess in other countries and that it didn’t matter what language he spoke or they spoke because chess is a language of its own. He has played in chess in countries such as China and Mexico.\n\nHe gave the chess club members some very helpful strategies and guidelines to success in the game of chess. Dewain stated, “Do you know I speak two international languages. The first one is Chess and the other one is Smile.” He was telling us that those two languages were all that he needed when he traveled the world! He then went on to talk to us about Chess strategy and really emphasized on having fun. Sometimes, having fun is the one rule that some players can tend to forget!\n\nIt’s important to not be so hard on ourselves and to learn from our mistakes as Mr. Barber had pointed out. He said to “Lighten up with your games.” The next tip or advice that he gave us was to make sure we control the Center! It’s very important to control the center and he mentioned that a lot of chess players forget that. He also stated, “If you ignore the center you are committing your own chess suicide!”\n\nDewain went on to some more advice about improving your endgame. Studying chess should be focused on studying the endgame. If you really know how to end the game, you can win mostly every time.\n\nDewain was telling us stories about his ventures in chess throughout the lecture. He told us many fascinating stories about him competing with Chess Masters but one that was really interesting and a story that most can relate to was a story about when Dewain had gone to a Simul with 64 other people to play against GM Walter Browne. GM Browne is a 6-time US Chess champion and he played against all 65 players at one time during this simul. As most of us have experience a simul, this one was definitely at another level. Dewain was very happy to report that in this match against Walter Browne he had the opportunity to draw; not too bad for playing against a 6-time US Chess Champion!\n\nThere was such a wealth of information at this lecture and I was glad to have attended. Dewain Barber was an excellent guest who was funny, kept us interested and provided so much helpful information for future games. In the future, if you unfortunately missed this lecture, I recommend that next time Dewain visits us everyone should attend.\n\nYou can view the original publication here\n\nSeptember 2018: Do You Know Carlsen?\n\nDo You Know Carlsen?\n\nImage\n\nI was in Hellesylt, Norway with its gorgeous waterfall that divided the town in half. This occurred during the Norway Chess event. When I left the ship, I asked the Cruise Director where I might find the elementary school. She pointed to a white building near the dock. I easily found the road to the building and walked inside to locate the office. There were two students whom I observed just inside the entrance. Since I did not speak Norwegian I tried to keep it simple. I said, “Office?” They both looked at me and then looked at each other. No success.\n\nThen, I said, “Teacher?” They quickly left. I had no idea what would happen. Shortly, a teacher arrived to greet me and I said, “I stopped by and wanted to donate a heavy weighted chess set to the school.”\n\nShe said in English, “Let us go up to the second floor where the office is located.” They were very pleased to accept the chess set and the teacher and I returned to the first floor. As I was departing she said, “Do you know Magnus Carlsen?”\n\nI replied, “Not personally, but his name is very familiar to American chess players.”\n\nI have left chess sets in many parts of the world including the Amazon, India, South Africa, Peru, Egypt, Guatemala, China, Sicily, Myanmar, Nepal, Kenya and Botswana. Now, there is one residing in Norway. This makes my wife happy because it creates some extra room in my suitcase for some souvenirs.\n\nJune 2018: Mees' Story - A New Friend\n\nMees' Story - A New Friend\n\nIt was my pleasure to cruise on the MS Rotterdam out of its home port. We were headed for Norway, the Land of the Midnight Sun, moose, trolls, fjords, waterfalls, and the North Cape. I knew it would be another wonderful adventure for this Chess Travelor.\n\nAfter getting on board, we found our way to the Explorations Café where most of the chess action would be taking place. My wife, Susan, was looking for the jigsaw puzzles and had a few of her own that she wanted to leave on board.\n\nAs I walked around the Café, I noticed a lot of chess sets, certainly more than I expected. The pieces and boards were all wood and a good size for a chess player. Of course, I checked to see if they were weighted. Sure enough they had that extra heft that every chess player appreciates.\n\nI decided to go to my cabin and return with my Ultimate set. When I originally created this set, one of the main features was the weight. Weighing 3.5 pounds made it ideal for blitz as well as classical games. This Ultimate came from a new mold and the king was slightly taller than before. Therefore, this new feature would get tested out to see if it could take the action I expected.\n\nI sat down and began setting up the pieces looking out of the corner of my eye to see if anyone stopped or slowed down on their journey to the coffee stop. Sure enough a gentleman stopped by and asked for a game. I introduced myself and asked where he was from. He remarked that he was Dutch and lived just outside of Rotterdam. As I was to learn, the Dutch were well represented on board as they too wanted to enjoy the sights of Norway.\n\nA group of six players gathered on sea days in the afternoon. I found out that we had a Canadian, a few Americans and some Dutchmen, but everything would change for me when I meet Mees.\n\nImage\n\nAs you can see, Mees Keijzer was a young man confined to a wheelchair. He stopped by the table and began watching a game I was playing with one of the other Dutch passengers. His concentration was very focused, but it was difficult for him to control his body movements.\n\nWhen I concluded my game, I asked his father if his son would like a game. He translated this offer into Dutch and Mees became very animated and excited. I think that meant yes.\n\nHis father remained at his side as we explored the opening. Mees would point to one of his pieces and his father would indicate that was the piece he wanted to move. It was then mentioned to me that I should point to a square that the piece could possibly move to and Mees would make a small sound. I figured out that one sound meant “yes” and another vocalization meant “no”.\n\nI had never played a player with such a disability, but we overcame it with concentration and focus.\n\nAs we proceeded, I was about to ask Mees’ father a question when I noticed that he had left the area. Now it was just Mees and myself.\n\nA calm came over me as I focused on the board and the moves that were made. Mees was a solid “B” player and knew his stuff. I looked for a way to break through and just did not see anything. As the game progressed I was finally able to find an attack that led to a win. I then did the most important thing in chess which was “smile”. He smiled back at me. I noticed his father had returned. I commented to his father, “Mees is a good chess player. Thank you for helping us get started.”\n\nUnfortunately there were few sea days in our cruise, so I did not have a chance to play Mees again. I look forward to returning to Rotterdam and playing Mees on another trip.\n\nJune 2018: Elizabethan Chess\n\nElizabethan Chess\n\nI have traveled many a mile onboard some of the finest cruise ships in the world. Without exception I have found people who are interested in a game of chess. The chess is casual with most games taking place during the days at sea. Many cruise ships have nice wood sets, but many years ago you would find the hollow red and black plastic pieces gracing a not so elegant board. Regardless of the sets the ship provides, I enjoy bringing a set or two and using them along with my vinyl board. Since I never take any sets home at the end of the cruise, I give away my sets to the people I play. In addition, I leave sets at some of our ports-of-call when I find a local who knows the game or at a school with a staff member who is willing to teach the game to young people. Some of the places I have left sets for schools are Ireland, Peru, Brazil (Amazon River village), Poland, China, Costa Rica and Egypt.\n\nThus, I approached my latest cruise with great enthusiasm because I had just received the newest edition of the set I invented along with the assistance of Jay Blem, who recently passed away. The Ultimate Chess Set was produced many years ago, but just as I was about to sell my company, American Chess Equipment, the Chinese company that produced the set went out of business. Only recently, with the help of the ACE manager, Shelby Lohrman, and Wood Expressions, was the set reproduced.\n\nSo, with the Ultimate set in hand I went up to the Explorations café on board the ship. This café is beside a library with its many books and maps of the world. My first step was to list myself in the register that informs people that chess will be played in the afternoon on sea days. Then, I set up my set and waited, reading a copy of Chess Life in the mean time.\n\nMany people walked by, and it did not take long before someone stopped to inquire if I would care for a game. One thing I have found on cruise ships is that there are periods when everyone has a lot of time on their hands. Sure enough Paul was one of those persons. During the cruise we dueled many times over the board with both of us trading wins, losses and some draws.\n\nOne afternoon, a young lady came by and stopped for a moment. She said, “I play chess, but I want to be better. Will you teach me more about the game?”\n\nI replied, “Certainly, please have a seat.” Thus, began an adventure for both of us. Her name was Elizabeth, and she and her husband, Viktor, were traveling on the longer portion of this cruise around the world. My wife and I were only traveling from Hong Kong to Cape Town, South Africa. Elizabeth lives in\n\nImage\n\nI began the lesson by checking to see if she understood the letters and numbers on my newest board. The mousepad chess board is ideal for traveling because you can fold it in any direction you want and there will be no creases when you open it.\n\nElizabeth was a fast learner. I discussed the importance of the center and development of pieces, especially the knights and bishops. In addition, I wanted to emphasize the importance of protecting the king. King safety often includes castling the king, and Elizabeth was able to grasp these major points with ease.\n\nWe played several games and then I suggested that she record a game. She was very receptive to the idea because she knew that she could go over the game later and study the ideas. It was a pleasure working with her. I know Elizabeth will enjoy the Large Magnetic set as well as the Ultimate Set that I gave her. She recently e-mailed me to say she would be attending the Rotary International Conference in Toronto. While there, she hopes to put her newly acquired chess skills to the test.\n\nFinally, I never say goodbye because I never know where I will be in the world when someone will come up to me and say, “Care for a game?” It could even be someone I have met before, like Julian Cummings.\n\nSeptember 2017: Great Wall Chess\n\nGreat Wall Chess\n\nHaving traveled to 108 countries on this planet, I was excited once again to be headed back to China. My wife, Susan, and I enjoyed visiting China once before, but this trip was special in another way. I was going to meet a Chinese-American student of mine, Alex Wang.\n\nAlex has family in China and spends much of the summer visiting with them and has played in local chess tournaments. This summer he chose to play in a FIDE event. His mother, Sarah invited us to visit them in Beijing..\n\nI have coached Alex from the age of 4, and currently at the age of 9 he is a smiling, gregarious young man who has grown up in two cultures. I have enjoyed working with him on his game, always emphasizing that chess should be a fun activity. I think he has followed that mantra.\n\nI would like to mention that when I saw the Chess Life story about the University of Texas, Dallas Chess Club visiting the Great Wall in 2008, I knew I wanted to have the same opportunity to see this Wonder of the World.\n\nWe were met at the airport by Sarah and Alex. Sarah drove us to our hotel as it was late and we were going to be busy in the morning. Bright and early the next morning we traveled to the Great Wall.\n\nImage\n\nLooking up from the parking lot, I could see the Wall that went for miles through the mountains. We walked up a long distance and came across the Great Wall map and then the China Stone Museum. Then, we took the Ropeway, the name given to the tram up the rest of the way. Upon arriving at the top of the hill, we stepped out of the tram on to an observation deck and walked a short distance to the entrance of the Great Wall.\n\nImage\n\nI had decided months ago that I wanted to honor four persons who had influenced my involvement in chess: Chess Journalist Hermann Helms, GM George Koltanowski, GM Arnold Denker and GM Arthur Bisguier. Beginning in 1943 Helms was the first of four persons to be recognized as the “Dean of American Chess”. He was followed by Koltanowski, Denker and Bisguier. I asked Dan Lucas, the editor of Chess Life if he could provide me with the Chess Life cover photos of Helms and Koltanowski. I had Denker and Bisguier covers already. Thanks to Dan, I was set to share with the world four persons who held the highest honor in US Chess.\n\nI especially wanted to remember GM Arnold Denker because his GM Denker Tournament of High School Champions just completed its thirty-third year of competition with over one thousand participants and former participants, some of whom have played multiple times in his event.\n\nAlex and I set up the chess set and positioned the four photos. A wind came up, but Alex and I held down the pages and began playing. In a few seconds a crowd began to form and watched us play.\n\nImage\n\nI really hoped that there were few chess players in the audience because Alex was winning and the old guy was crying on the Great Wall. As we finished the game I said to myself, “The Chess Adventure Continues!”\n\nMarch 2016: Jesus Chess\n\nJesus Chess\n\nI have talked about many of my travels in the pages of this website. Each time I have an opportunity to play chess with wonderful people I marvel at the enjoyment that they get from moving the pieces. This experience was no different from many others except that the Ocean Princess, a cruise ship which was traversing the Atlantic Ocean was facing off against two large storms and moving through 20 foot waves.\n\nWe were expecting to board the ship in Rome, but our connecting flight was late and so we started in Genoa, Italy. Once aboard we got settled in and I approached the Cruise Director, Adam Love. That really was his name. I asked, “Can you place in your daily announcements that chess players can meet in the Card Room for casual play?” He agreed so I proceeded to the Card Room at the appointed hour on days when we were at sea to meet fellow chess enthusiasts.\n\nI found some of the traditional red and black plastic sets, but I set up mine as well. The first person to arrive was a fellow from Sweden. Jockum, age 69 was from Stockholm. I learned very quickly that this cruise was going to be a chess challenge. Jockum was one of those players who came up with unusual openings and interesting ideas. We went back and forth; winning and then losing to each other followed by a draw and then back to winning and losing.\n\nLeo Wang, originally from Taiwan was another participant in our circle of chess. Leo was just as challenging as Jockum. I found Leo to be a strong opponent with the black pieces and he never failed to show up for our chess sessions.\n\nMost of the cruises I take involve senior citizens and retired persons. It is not often I meet someone who is in their 20’s. The young person in question was Jesus Rodriguez originally from Tampico, Mexico, but he now lives in Texas. He was the final member of our group of four. I asked Jesus if he had taken several cruises before. He replied, “No, this is my first time.” I was quite surprised because of the length and location of this trip. I would have thought he might have chosen something shorter and closer to his home. That aside, he was skillful and his game continued to get better.\n\nAfter we had played several days during the cruise, I suggested that we have a real challenge. I felt that Jesus was strong enough to play a simultaneous against Jockum, Leo and myself. Since this was his virgin voyage and he was the youngest member of our group, it would be a great challenge for him.\n\nThe day of the simul it was very stormy and windy. The waves were around 15 feet high so we were rocking and rolling. The photo below shows just how bad it was, but we played on.\n\nThe results of the simul were two wins for Jesus and one loss, but the story does not end there. We had another guest come to sign-in and he looked at the wallchart I had prepared for our casual play: Player 1-Jesus, Player 2-Jockum, Player 3-Dewain and Player 4-Leo. His comment was certainly classic, “You mean I have to play Jesus Christ? That is not fair.” He chose not to play chess with us. The chess adventures continue.\n\nMarch 2016: Amazonia Chess\n\nAmazonia Chess\n\nBy Dewain Barber\n\nMarch 10, 2016\n\nIguazu\n\nIn the southwestern corner of Brazil bordered by Paraguay and Argentina you will find a waterfall beyond belief called Iguazu Falls. This location is a far cry from the teaming rainforest of Amazonia. It is in fact a place where you will find the largest series of waterfalls in the world. At its highest point the falls drop from a height of 269 feet, a total of 275 individual falls (cataracts) covering a distance of 1.7 miles.\n\nWhen we met our guide, Marcos Duarte, he explained that our helicopter trip over Iguazu would be best done that day, so off we went to the helipad.\n\nWhat you see in the picture above is only a small part of Iguazu Falls. It clearly was one of the largest waterfalls I have seen. I have been to Victoria Falls, on the Zambezi River at the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe and Niagara Falls, but nothing prepared me for this place. It seemed that there was water everywhere I looked.\n\nMarcos picked us up from the helipad, and I mentioned that I played chess and wondered if he knew someone that I could play. He mentioned a friend, but as things sometimes happen, his friend was not available. The next day when we walked the trail along the falls, he volunteered to learn the game after our stroll.\n\nIn the picture above we came across a wooden walkway that leads out into the river just below the falls. It is called the Devil’s Throat. As you can see it would get anyone soaking wet if they ventured out. We walked only a short distance and turned back.\n\nI left the chess set with Marcos and asked him to give it to a student who wanted to learn the game with him. I had now completed my first chess experience in Brazil at a location that few have seen and likely fewer have ever played a game of chess next to this waterfall.\n\nRio and Beyond\n\nRio de Janeiro will be hosting the 2016 Olympics in August of this year. The town was filled with excitement because we arrived during Carnival. This is the happiest time of the year for Brazilians. The picture below says it all. We sat in the stands as the groups called schools passed by. The color and skills of the dancers and wonderful music are judged and the best schools are invited to the finals.\n\nAmazonia-The Heart of Brazil\n\nAmazonia is one of the states of the Amazon Basin and is sometimes referred to as a jungle. It is in fact a rainforest with a canopy of trees and home to many species of plants and animals. I got there on a cruise ship.\n\nI had been informed that we would be stopping at a village called Boca da Valeria that was on one of the smaller rivers that flow into the Amazon River. It took several days of sailing before we reached the village. The ship had to anchor in the river because the water was too shallow near the village. Our ship lowered tender boats and they took us to the village. I took my chess set with me as I had decided months before that I would introduce chess to the young people of this village.\n\nAs I stepped on land my wife, Susan, and I were greeted by children who took our hand and acted as our guides. Susan’s guide was a young girl named Diane.\n\nWe proceeded through the village and came to the school house. It was elevated because of the flooding of the river.\n\nImage\n\nWe walked up the steps and entered the school and found a teacher who was accepting gifts from the cruise ship passengers. I looked for a table and laid out the chess board and began setting up the pieces. Diane, my wife’s guide, walked over and sat down opposite me. I did not speak Portuguese and Diane did not speak a word of English. I made the move e4 and pointed to the black pawn and she replied with e5. Then, she mirrored my moves. After a few moves I stopped and set up the pieces to the starting position. I then pointed to my pieces and she moved the white’s pawn to e4. She continued until she had repeated all the moves exactly as I had shown her.\n\nImage\n\nI left the chess set in the school and indicated that it was for the children. I found out later from some other cruise ship passengers that some of the children who knew how to play chess were using the set.\n\nChess On The Amazon River\n\nAfter dinner, I went up to the library and met Bob Michie from Austin, Texas. He and I had been playing some casual games just before we reached the village. Bob is a PhD physicist who mainly studied and worked applying physics to unsolved engineering problems and a pilot with a passion for travel. We shared many stories about the places we had been. It was a pleasure to play several times over the remainder of the trip.\n\nImage\n\nOne evening as I returned to the library, I noticed an elderly lady leaning over a chess board and across from her was what looked like a teenager. Most of the cruises have senior citizens with few children onboard. As I approached, I paused and observed a game in progress. I watched the game with no comment until Kathleen Olinger, the grandmother, said, “You must be a Master at chess?” I replied, “No, I simply love to play the game, and I see you are playing a young man.” She replied that he was her 12 year-old grandson, Diego Dos Santos, and they were just moving the pieces around and learning the game. I do not recall ever seeing on any cruise ship I have sailed on a grandmother play chess with her grandson.\n\nI asked Kathleen, “How does it happen that your grandson is sailing on this cruise ship?” She replied, “He is on a trip to visit his father’s country. He was born in Los Angeles and has dual citizenship-USA and Brazil.” I offered to share a lesson with them.\n\nJust as I felt that Brazilian chess and the Amazonian experience were at its peak, I met another chess player onboard who showed me it was a small world. Wendell Bollinger from St. Louis, Missouri is a charter member of the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of St. Louis, the most recognizable chess organization in the United States.\n\nHe happened to be seated at one of the chess sets in the library during the last few days of our trip. I stopped and asked if he played chess and would he care for a game. He eagerly accepted. The action was fierce and challenging. Although I won the first game, I learned that his skill came from his previous chess playing many years ago. I lost the second game, but losses are learning opportunities for the future. Chess is never ending no matter where in the world you happen to be. It is still an international language.\n\nOn The Way Home\n\nJanuary 2016: Paying It Forward with Chess\n\nMy Chess Journey: Paying It Forward with Chess\n\nBy Shrey Gandhi\n\nJanuary 14, 2016\n\nI am a US Chess member. I have enjoyed playing chess and the past few months received the privilege to learn playing chess from Mr. Barber. Seeing his passion for chess and wanting to teach chess has truly inspired me. The last three birthdays, I decided to not accept any gifts or presents from friends and family, but instead I requested they give me a check or cash. Instead, I donate to a charity organization called Sewa Rural in rural India to help serve the under-privileged.\n\nI decided to do something special for my 10th birthday. I decided to play and teach chess to the physically handicapped and under privileged kids in India. During my visit to Ahmedabad, India this last summer, I visited a place called Pearl School for the Disabled. The school admits kids and makes them think that they are capable of doing anything.\n\nI went to talk with some teachers at the school. After that, one of the teachers took me to the class to play chess with one of the students. When I reached the classroom, I asked, “Does anybody want to play chess?” Only one person named Nilesh raised his hand. I taught him that you are supposed to shake hands at the beginning of a game and at the ending of a game. Then, we started playing a game.\n\nI thought he was pretty good although I won the first two games we played. I observed in the third game that he was skilled at the opening, but weak in the endgame.\n\nWhile everybody gathered around Nilesh to watch us play, I quickly finished the game and then taught the other people how to play chess. Two of the people started playing chess after we finished and I guided them while they were playing. I had a lot of fun, I hope to go there again, and had an incredible and stupendous time. When I left the school, I donated chess sets that Mr. Barber had given me.\n\nI also went to a place called Sewa Rural where they have a charity hospital to serve the medical needs of poor people and played two games of chess. In addition, we decided to have some fun so we played a couple of games of suicide chess, a game in which you have to lose your pieces instead of winning them.\n\nThe third place I visited was called Apang Manav Mandar. In this place they have an all-day hostel for kids who have diseases, are disabled and sent to this place when their families are not able to care for them. Since the kids understood only the local language (Gujarati), I had to first learn what the pieces were called in their local language. I played and explained some chess moves in their language so they could understand. I played with two people and then when they had a chance to checkmate, I asked if they could recognize it. Having enjoyed playing and teaching chess, I also went to the same place again the next day. I played with four students, two of whom were very good and they actually beat me. After this, the two students who had beaten me played each other and the person who won received a magnetic chess set.\n\nWe took a picture of me and the winner holding the magnetic chess set and then I said good-bye to the fourteen people who had been there to play chess and I hope to go there again and play new people. I hope more and more people learn chess so that I can share the game with them. We donated multiple chess sets here as well. Teaching chess to others not only taught me to play better, but has increased my respect for the game. It has given me an immense joy of helping somebody else to learn the value of the game.\n\nMay 2015: Real Sicilian Chess\n\nReal Sicilian Chess\n\nBy Dewain Barber\n\nMay 21, 2015\n\nAs our plane prepared to land in Sicily, I knew we would be in for some walking. The European experience of walking on cobblestones was not lost in this beautiful location. I have walked on many cobblestone streets in my travels, but I was not prepared for these streets because Sicily is very mountainous. So, where would I find my game of chess? Would it be at a sidewalk cafe, in a store filled with many souvenirs or some other location that would create the momentum for a brief moment or two with Cassia?\n\nWe met our guide, Marina, and found out that she was a true Sicilian. She was born and raised in Palermo, which is located on the western side of the island so we knew we were going to have a real local experience and not just see the tourist traps that many groups visit. One of our excursions was to visit Corleone, home of the Godfather. While we were there we visited an art museum where we learned about the history of the Sicilian mob. We also went to a restaurant where we had a cooking class.\n\nI helped make Bruschetta (grilled French bread rubbed with garlic and topped with chopped tomatoes and olive oil) and fried eggplant while my wife, Susan worked on pizza dough.\n\nWe started out on the eastern side of the island staying in the resort town of Taormina which gave us a view of Mt. Etna. At one time this town and the surrounding areas were occupied by the Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Normans, Spanish and French before finally becoming part of Italy. We saw the ruins of many Greek amphitheaters and temples on our journey.\n\nAs we walked through the old part of the city, I carried my chess set with me to see if I could get a game with one of the locals. After our excursion, we headed back to the hotel in Taormina, we stopped for some pizza at the Ristorante Gambero Rosso, located in a narrow passageway. I asked the waiter if I could have two tables, one for our dining pleasure and one for my chess set. We displayed the set and put out a sign that said, “Open for a game.” We had several people look and some of our tour group actually stopped to have dinner, but there were no takers. As I was finishing dinner, I thought maybe a member of the restaurant staff might like to learn the game. As it turned out, there was a brave young man, Slah, who volunteered to sit down. He did not know much about the game, so I made a few moves and explained some of the basic ideas.\n\nAfter five days in Eastern Sicily, we drove west to see our last location, Palermo. As I have done in the past, I asked Marina if she knew of anyone who played chess. She asked if I was looking for a club or a casual game at a coffee house. I replied, “I just want to play chess with one of the local citizens for an hour.”\n\nShe responded, “I think I may have two young people who will be interested.” She commented further that her son, Enrico, and his friend, Leonardo, were both chess players and she would see if they could come to the hotel on the afternoon of the following day where I could meet them. Both enjoyed playing chess. Leonardo had played in a local tournament just a few days before.\n\nJanuary 2015: KwaPitela Chess\n\nKwaPitela Chess\n\nBy Josh and Celyne Hernandez-Camen\n\nJanuary 10, 2015\n\nLast Spring, Angel Jochi Hernandez-Camen (or Josh as he is more commonly called) learned that he qualified to play for the US team in the U14 section of the 2014 World Youth Chess Tournament. The tournament was held in Durban, South Africa on September 19-29. Josh and his mom, Celyne, raised money for the trip through fundraisers and scholarships. When they were planning their South African journey they came across a backpacker’s lodge in the Drakensberg Mountains that ran a volunteer program at a nearby village primary school. After some back and forth with the lodge owners and the school’s headmaster, Josh was able to arrange to start a chess program at the school. Following are his accounts (and some writing from his mom) about their experiences while volunteering at the school.\n\nOn the way to Himeville and KwaPitela\n\nIt is hard to say who learned more in the two days I taught chess at KwaPitela Primary school. I hope I started them on the road to playing chess at least. But more on that later… The morning after the World Youth Chess Tournament ended, we rented a small car, bought some groceries, and drove 218 kilometers to Himeville, a small town in the Drakensberg mountains. It would be my first sights outside of the city of Durban and into the country. Suddenly there were bulls and goats in the roads and small villages of rondavels which are traditional Zulu homes made of cow dung, reeds and plaster. We would live in one in the backpacker’s lodge we would stay at.\n\nIn our trunk were a dozen chess sets donated by Dewain Barber, who hosts the Barber Championship chess tournament which I participated in last summer, and other chess equipment, souvenirs, and photos from Coach El Mekki and the Paul Robeson Chess Club in Philadelphia. I was on my way to jump start a chess program and exchange at a small rural school that had never seen a chess program, that only just got electricity in one building and had no heating, a school of students who were English learners but whose first language was Zulu and who I was told knew little or nothing about chess. I had no idea what to expect or how I was going to teach them and I had been so busy with World Youth that I felt poorly prepared. I figured I could teach chess basics though, had some ideas of how to begin, and figured after the first day’s assessment I could make appropriate lesson plans. I also attempted to learn some Zulu which is a really interesting and musical language with the clicks.\n\nDay 1\n\nOn our first morning at the Sani Pass Lodge we woke up to a cool morning. We took a short nature hike, ate a breakfast of muesli, homemade yogurt, and bread with blackberry jam, and then got ready to meet the students at KwaPitela school. For more information about the school, and the volunteer program Russell and Simone have organized, please see: http://www.sanilodge.co.za/DAvolunteering.html\n\nOn the first day we packed our trunk with the chess sets from Dewain Barber and the gifts from the Paul Robeson Chess Club and gave a ride to a teacher who was visiting from Austria and who had volunteered to assist with the English classes for a week. The drive to KwaPitela from Sani Lodge and our cozy rondavel was about ten minutes up a winding unpaved mountain pass along which we spotted white heron and other birds mixing with the livestock in the pastures. We parked our car and walked up the dirt drive toward the corrugated iron roofed buildings that comprise the school.\n\nA goat greeted us, and the students were at recess playing on the playground and running in the yard. The mountains stood in the distance. As I wrote earlier, the school facilities and materials are quite basic. There is limited electricity and no heat in the classrooms. Each room has blankets to wrap around the students for when it gets really cold. I imagine you need to be pretty dedicated to learning school lessons shivering under blankets in an uninsulated building. We were there at the beginning of Spring, but in the Winter, temperatures can drop below freezing.\n\nHeadmaster Ndlovu and the teachers identified twelve students who were interested in learning chess. I taught them for two days from the time their recess and lunch ended until the end of the day — about four to five hours, I guess. On the second day — a rainy and cold afternoon — headmaster Ndlovu dismissed school early, but all the students in my chess class said they wanted to stay and we did.\n\nOn the first day I taught them how to move the pieces, how to take with each piece, how to set the board, etc. Then I had them play a game (or two) with each other. Despite the language barrier, they seemed to understand a good chunk of what I was teaching them.\n\nI would however see many games where one side mysteriously had two same-colored bishops, and it was definitely not because of under-promotion! I did forget to teach them about castling…but would do that on day 2. Their teacher, Ms. Purity, learned along with them. She really liked the idea of chess and said she wanted to include it as part of the school’s sports program. She said other schools in the area played chess and they would be able to play against them also. It all seemed promising. That whole night I examined my chess databases for a game that would be suitable for beginners, as I wanted to show them an example of an actual game and notation. I decided on a Paul Morphy game that I thought would show them the concept of development and the attack on the weak, undefended, uncastled king. I realized that the game didn’t involve castling… but I would show this as an example of when you didn’t castle when you should have.\n\nDay 2\n\nImage\n\nOn the second day we took Russell and Simone’s daughter with us who plays chess and she helped a lot by walking around the classroom and making sure the students understood what I was explaining. I showed them the game and notation on the chalkboard as they followed along over their own boards playing the sides against each other…overall it went well. I stopped the play every now and then and explained the important moves in more detail. I feel like maybe they got a better feel for how the pieces move and some basic ideas. But really they just loved to play and that was good. It was enough to just instill the love of the game in them. Later they could learn to play better, and better, and better…. On this day a chess player who is a member of the local Zulu community and who offered to be the team’s coach came and taught along with me, translating some of the more complicated concepts into Zulu. With him and Russell and Simone’s daughter helping it all went well. I think he’ll do a good job continuing the program, though I hope other chess players will come through and help also. Ms. Purity attended for some of the class also. My mom assisted by writing most of the notation on the board and taking the photos and videos. It definitely took a group and will continue to need involvement from the local and chess community to sustain this program and bring these enthusiastic new players to a competitive level. I think it can be done though and that regardless of the outcome the skill of chess will be helpful to the students. It’s certainly been a great skill for me to have learned in so many ways and has become such an important part of my life. I honestly can’t imagine not playing chess.\n\nWe also shared photos and a letter of greeting from Coach El Mekki and the students of Paul Robeson Chess Club, New Jersey chess coach Malik, and a letter written by a player on the US World Youth team. I think the students really enjoyed looking at the photos and knowing that other youth like them exist around the world to one day meet and play chess with. They also had fun choosing the colorful chess piece key rings that the Paul Robeson students sent as mementos.\n\nIt is Josh’s and my wish to continue to correspond with the students and their teachers, to sustain the program, to help them with their chess and other goals, and to build an exchange between students in the U.S. and the KwaPitela students. Coach El Mekki and the Paul Robeson Chess Club are sponsoring this exchange and we hope others in the community will participate as well. The school recently got a library in the form of a large shipping container, specially amended and prepared with doors, windows, shelves and fully stocked with books. We would like to donate a collection of chess books for their new library and are working on the logistics of this. If anyone wants to help with this, has other ideas or wants to get involved with moving this project along you can contact us at Click here to show email address. Also if you are visiting South Africa and want to volunteer at the school you can do so by contacting Sani Lodge Backpackers (http://www.sanilodge.co.za/DAvolunteering.html ).\n\nThis article is taken from excerpts of a blog written by me and my mom about our experiences in South Africa. It is a work in progress and we will be adding updates as we can. If you want to read the complete blog and keep up to date you can link to it here: http://jcsouthafricatrip.blogspot.com/\n\nOur visit was greatly enhanced by the remarkable spirit of the KwaPitela students and their teachers, the dedication and love Russell and Simone Suchet have for the community where they live, the unconditional support of Coach El Mekki and the Paul Robeson Chess Club, Stephen Shutt’s prolific ideas and suggestions, Dewain Barber’s generosity and interest in spreading chess, Florri Middleman and the contributions from the Watermark Foundation, Grandpa Clyde and his unwavering affection, encouragement and care for Josh and me, and all our friends who bought tamales, donated money and cheered us along the way.\n\nDecember 2014: Irrawaddy Chess\n\nIrrawaddy Chess\n\nBy Dewain Barber\n\nDecember 30, 2014\n\nMyanmar (formally Burma) has become more available to tourists in the last several years. My wife, Susan and I were intrigued by what we had read about this country. The main river is the Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy). Its source is in the Himalaya glaciers going south to the Andaman Sea, a distance of 1,348 miles. Although we traveled on the Viking Mandalay riverboat from Mandalay to Yangon, the trip was long enough for me to meet the people of this diverse country and play a few games of chess.\n\nWe saw hundreds of Buddhist temples and stupas, visited monasteries, schools, an orphanage, went shopping in the produce market, wore local clothing, learned a native dance, enjoyed a life-sized elephant puppet dance, and bought some souvenirs and gifts.\n\nMy first chess encounter was with a fellow passenger, Gary Nichols, originally from Brooklyn, NY, who now resides in Charlotte, North Carolina. He approached me after I set up my board and pieces on the Sundeck and asked if I was the “chess guy”. I confirmed that I played, and he replied that he had a problem. He said, “I have played my son many times, and I just can’t beat him. Could you help me improve my game?” I told him that I would be happy to help out and that we could play a game so I could see how well he played.\n\nOur first game showed the normal weaknesses of a casual player. He did not develop his pieces nor attempt to control the center and delayed many moves before castling. We worked on these ideas as well as discussing pins, forks and skewers. I had an extra folding magnetic set which I gave one to Gary so he could play his son when he got home.\n\nGary was a quick learner and was able to integrate these ideas. I shared an idea with him that I learned from GM Isaac Kashdan. When I was at a scholastic event in Los Angeles, he was the honorary tournament director. I approached him to ask for some advice that I could share with my students in the school chess club that I sponsored. He said, “Learn to count in the endgame.” At first I did not understand what he meant because it seemed too simple. After more endgame study, I realized what GM Kashdan m"
