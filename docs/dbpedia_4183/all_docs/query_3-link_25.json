Currently, I am a graduate student in Professor Stuart Campbell's lab, where I am studying arrhythmias using iPSC-derived engineered heart tissues. Outside of science, I play the piano (mostly classical, a bit of jazz and musical theater), compose, and enjoy road biking.\n\nI graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with a double major in Biological Engineering and Brain & Cognitive Sciences. In the past, I studied infant social cognition using functional near-infrared spectroscopy in the Saxe Lab at MIT. At the Mayo Clinic, I led a protein engineering project working with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) to alter the inhibitory profile toward cancer biomarkers, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Moving forward, I will continue to pursue cancer research, specifically tumor immunology, immunotherapy, and neuro-immunology. Fun fact: I was invited to train at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, CO for volleyball!\n\nAfter completing her undergraduate degree at Georgia Tech, Ann spent 9 months in India conducting public health research with a Fulbright research fellowship. Ann plans to continue public health research during her PhD with a mixed-methods approach. Ann enjoys spending time hiking and outdoors.\n\nI grew up in the U.S. Virgin Islands on St. John and went to undergrad at the University of the Virgin Islands on St. Thomas, where I graduated with a B.S. in Biology. I am currently interested in research in tissue engineering here at Yale and would like to pursue a degree in Biomedical Engineering in addition to my medical degree. In terms of hobbies and interests, I enjoy playing tennis and guitar and telling people who see my height and ask about the weather that being 6'5\" does not cause colossal microclimate differences.\n\nI was born in Tallahassee, Florida, and raised on a small farm near Greensboro before moving to Homestead in South Florida. Afterward, I returned to north Florida for college and graduated Summa Cum Laude from Florida State University with a degree in Chemical Engineering and a focus in Biomedical Engineering in December 2018. My passion for cancer research was kindled by personal experiences and nurtured by my mentor, Dr. Jeremy Chambers, with whom I worked on understanding mitochondrial JNK signaling in cancer during high school, through the Florida International University Summer Research Internship program. Fascinated by the intricate complexity of cancer biology, I continued to pursue cancer research throughout my undergraduate years, exploring various topics in cancer research at FSU, the Wistar Institute, and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center. Throughout my research experience, I have employed systems biology approaches, analyzing the graphs/network states from high-dimensional -omics data, including transcriptomics, proteomics, somatic mutations, and metabolomics, to study these highly organized cellular processes. I have gained expertise in bioinformatics techniques in conjunction with \"wet lab\" cell biology experimentation, in the labs of my mentors Drs. Amy Sang, Timothy Logan, David Speicher, and Vito Quaranta. My senior design project (with now InnoHealth Diagnostics) piqued my interest in point-of-care diagnostics and the challenges of developing rapid, cost-effective nucleic acid amplification testing. We developed a simple, disposable prototype device and protocol that could detect pathogen DNA in a urine sample through a colorimetric DNA intercalator that was detectable (without additional instrumentation) after loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of the target sequence. Our team was awarded the FSU Jim Moran Micro Grant, the 2019 Mark K. Scott Infinity Fund Prize InNOLEvation Challenge Award, and competed in the 2019 ACC InVenture competition, with special thanks to the mentorship of Drs. Cesar Rodriguez and Emily Pritchard. Presently, I am pursuing translational cancer research questions in Dr. David Rimm's lab at Yale, surrounding HER2-low cancer and emerging antibody-drug conjugates. Overall, my research interests include discovering biomarkers for treatment response and characterizing drug-tolerant or immune-repressed states in patient tumors. In this area of research, I am utilizing my expertise in data science and bioinformatics while expanding my knowledge of statistics and machine learning to investigate these complex problems. I am also intrigued by the engineering hurdles in creating robust diagnostic assays and systems to deliver fast, accurate, and reliable results to guide patient care. In the future, I aspire to blend these elements in my research career as a physician-scientist and engineer. When I am not in the lab, I enjoy playing golf (having competed in the US Kids Tour in Florida), programming, and indulging in science fiction.\n\nI was born in Calcutta India, and moved to Edison, New Jersey for high school. I then attended Boston University, majoring in Biology and Philosophy. My interest in research began during a summer internship at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where I studied daily changes in mitochondrial numbers. Upon coming back to Boston, I began working on the biochemistry of circadian rhythms at Harvard Medical School, studying the native, endogenous structure and function of the transcription factor responsible for regulating all mammalian cellular circadian rhythms. I also spent a summer at the EPFL in Switzerland investigating robotics and its application in the diagnosis and treatment of psychosis. As an MD-PhD student at Yale, I want to learn how to rigorously think about science and become the best physician that I can be. Outside of school, I love to read philosophy/ethics, eat good food, pursue my love for stand-up comedy, and listen to classic rock.\n\nI grew up in Aurora, Colorado, and spent time at the University of Colorado before coming to Yale.
