        "text": "What if Lloyd George did not push and encourage the Greek cause so much after the Treaty of Sevres and in the Greco-Turkish war? So no promises of additional lavish arms and aid for Venizelos government, no encouragement for the Greeks to push offensives beyond the Smyrna enclave gained by the Treaty of Sevres, after occupying the straits no attempts to punitively compel recalcitrant groupings of Turks to sign the Treaty.\n\nDoes Venizelos proceed with a big Anatolian offensive without such support anyway, or does he have a better understanding of his limits and national war-weariness from the beginning?\n\nDo the Turkish nationalist forces coalesce and regroup and fall in line under Ataturk, Inonu and company as thoroughly as in OTL and cast off the Sultan and old rump Ottoman parliament with the same popular legitimacy as OTL?\n\nWith less pressure in western Anatolia, and the axis of attack toward Ankara, how are the Turkish fronts versus Armenia, Mosul, and Cilicia/Syria effected?\n\nDoes the lack of major Greek offensives under the Venizelists, eventual overextension, and defeats, shield Venizelos from national war-weariness in the election of 1920 and keep him in power? Is Venizelos (or any other Greek government) better able to rally to successfully oppose an emerging Turkish threat by 1920, 21, 22, 23 to the Greek occupied Smyrna enclave, or Gallipoli and eastern Thrace?\n\nWould the lack of a failed Greco-Turkish adventure prevent the eventual Chanak Crisis of 1922, that saw the Dominions, Italy, France, and British public opinion balk at facing war to defend Constantinople from the resurgent Turks, and led to the Conservative break with Lloyd George?\n\nIf Lloyd George is not humiliated in such a way, what does his future hold? And if the Chanak Crisis does not occur to expose Canada (and by extension other Dominions') weariness at following Britain into wars, what will this mean for future intra-Dominion relations and the Statute of Westminster, and London's confidence?\n\n......Or is my PoD too late, is a Greco-Turkish war, including a successful Turkish war of independence and confrontation with Greeks and Britons too weary to keep fighting, baked in as soon as a Treaty of Sevres is forced on Turkey that includes provisions like a Greek Smyrna enclave, and possibly even the Greek eastern Thrace and internationalized Constantinople?\n\nAnother long-term negative of the British-backed pro-Greek terms of Sevres, I would add, was the assignment of the Smyrna enclave to Greece further alienated Italy, which felt entitled to a sphere of influence in the same area as part of larger southwest Anatolia as part of the Treaty of London, as further clarified in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_of_Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne.\n\nI usually characterize Great War as a relentless melee between armies set on maximalist programs, followed by an one between diplomacies every bit as fierce just to attain the minimalist ones.\n\nIn such a context I don't think there's a way out of the pernicious overlap: the British need an enforcer to secure their gains, Greece is willing to commit their army and thus wants to obtain as much as possible, while the geography is such that the Turks can only keep pushing or die. Oh, and of course Italy is not going to help, no matter how you slice it, they simply don't have the resources for it even if Greece for some reason decides to treat them respectfully.\n\nThe only realistic way out is a purposeful screw that either allows Greece to enforce its goals or never even attempt them.\n\nWhat I am puzzled about is what Lloyd George really thinks he is getting for *britain* with all this Megali aggrandizement of Greece. (A Greece that is actually less solid under the surface than it appears to be, given war fatigue and national schism). I mean Britain was contesting Mosul with the Turks, but does it need *all* this western Turkey hubbub going on just to keep the Turkish flank busy? France and Italy had maximalist ‘ideas’ with regard to Anatolia, but when the Turks showed spine, and France had enough friction in Syria, they both dropped those aims on the double. Lloyd George wants not just Mosul but Kurdistan and an international straits just that much, huh?\n\nHmm. Here you go I believe\n\nI like that. It was a good read. And, I found your argument persuasive that the outcome of the war could get Greece Thrace and Constantinople with only a small amount of further butterflies on Turkey and Greece and the wider European situation.\n\nActually you have substantial knock-ons for the Greek political situation, mostly along the lines of making it happier and healthier, with a reduction of the national schism and monarchism and dictatorship. I will take your word on that stuff, since I am non-expert on it.\n\nI will also take your word on Ataturk, and his basic secular nationalist ideas (but still using Muslim heritage identity as the key national marker) staying intact and in charge of Anatolian Turkey. With his regime maybe just being a little angrier, whining more about great power back-stabbing, and a little more tempted by revanchist ideas down the line.\n\nFrom summer of 1923, does Mussolini really have any way to immediately exploit this quick and decisive round of fighting that he had been cheerleading? Can he use it to grab Corfu? Or is it all over too soon? Anything else he can grab? Maybe just solidify hold on Dodecanese by treaty?\n\nWould Turkey a little more bitter at the western powers over 'letting' Greece smack them in 1923 get any substantively closer to the USSR, would it? It wouldn't go Communist, or let the Communist Party get genuine influence, or abet Communist activity in Bulgaria or Persia in any real way, would it?\n\nWould bitter Turkey behave more assertively/aggressively on any of its other borders? Perhaps holding out for more during the Mosul dispute or really making a go at claiming that far northern piece of Iraq? Or might it seek to 'improve' its border with French Syria, getting Alexandretta/Antioch much earlier than 1938/39? Either in the 1923-24 timeframe, or trying to leverage French distress during the Syrian revolt of 1925-27 to extort it from France?\n\nMuch later on, would Turkey get involved in WWII, or still, like OTL, think better of it, and stay stubbornly neutral, carefully tilting toward the winner of the moment? If it joined the Axis, what would it be seeking militarily? Would Thrace/Constantinople be its primary objective or one of them? And if revisionist, how much more would it have armed itself?\n\nAnd as we got to WWII, we would have a larger Greece, with a longer border with Bulgaria to worry about defending. It might benefit from avoidance of bouts of dictatorship - maybe. But assuming Greece, now with Thrace and Constantinople, is still Axis-occupied, is Stalin still content to assign Greece 90% to Britain in the infamous percentages agreement, and brush Red Army forces completely to the north and past the prewar Greco-Bulgarian border? Or will he be just too tempted to have the Soviet Army occupy Thrace and Constantinople and establish an ELAS-fronted, KKE-controlled government set up for Greece or at least that Thracian region giving Moscow strategic control over at least half of the straits?\n\nI like that. It was a good read. And, I found your argument persuasive that the outcome of the war could get Greece Thrace and Constantinople with only a small amount of further butterflies on Turkey and Greece and the wider European situation.\n\nActually you have substantial knock-ons for the Greek political situation, mostly along the lines of making it happier and healthier, with a reduction of the national schism and monarchism and dictatorship. I will take your word on that stuff, since I am non-expert on it.\n\nNot certain I would be writing it exactly the same today, with all the reading accumulated in the intervening 16 years, frex I've seen Pangalos grandson writing his grandpa planned to have in the peace treaty a return to the Sevres border in Thrace not actually taking Constantinople as I have it in the TL. If I ever do a rewrite... in the meantime you can stick with my Lost Monkeys about what a Greek victory in Asia Minor would had plausibly looked like.\n\nI will also take your word on Ataturk, and his basic secular nationalist ideas (but still using Muslim heritage identity as the key national marker) staying intact and in charge of Anatolian Turkey. With his regime maybe just being a little angrier, whining more about great power back-stabbing, and a little more tempted by revanchist ideas down the line.\n\nKemal to put it bluntly was ruling as a dictator in a regime with external fascist trappings, in the 1920s and 1930s when fascism was in vogue and not anathema his regime was often compared with Mussolini and was anything but shy about assassinating the occasional political opponent like Ali Sukru bey in 1923. The difference was HE was clever and was lucky in his successor being Inonu who was clever enough to stay out of WW2 and reposition Turkey post 1945 as a western nation.\n\nFrom summer of 1923, does Mussolini really have any way to immediately exploit this quick and decisive round of fighting that he had been cheerleading? Can he use it to grab Corfu? Or is it all over too soon? Anything else he can grab? Maybe just solidify hold on Dodecanese by treaty?\n\nIn the summer he was hinting at actually supporting Greece. My guess is that a Greek offensive would be over too fast for him to do anything, the Greeks would likely be secure at Catalca in two to three weeks. Which means a frustrated Mussolini playing games very much like OTL in autumn.\n\nWould Turkey a little more bitter at the western powers over 'letting' Greece smack them in 1923 get any substantively closer to the USSR, would it? It wouldn't go Communist, or let the Communist Party get genuine influence, or abet Communist activity in Bulgaria or Persia in any real way, would it?\n\nThe leadership of the communist party was massacred in early 1921, it never quite recovered. Going fascist with the pro-fascist elements like Recep Peker taking over instead of Inonu at the time of Kemal's death in 1938 looks to be rather more plausible.\n\nWould bitter Turkey behave more assertively/aggressively on any of its other borders? Perhaps holding out for more during the Mosul dispute or really making a go at claiming that far northern piece of Iraq? Or might it seek to 'improve' its border with French Syria, getting Alexandretta/Antioch much earlier than 1938/39? Either in the 1923-24 timeframe, or trying to leverage French distress during the Syrian revolt of 1925-27 to extort it from France?\n\nMuch later on, would Turkey get involved in WWII, or still, like OTL, think better of it, and stay stubbornly neutral, carefully tilting toward the winner of the moment? If it joined the Axis, what would it be seeking militarily? Would Thrace/Constantinople be its primary objective or one of them? And if revisionist, how much more would it have armed itself?\n\nFunnily enough that's to a large degree what I have Turkey doing in Lost Monkeys. Of course we are talking a MUCH more embittered Turkey there...\n\nAnd as we got to WWII, we would have a larger Greece, with a longer border with Bulgaria to worry about defending. It might benefit from avoidance of bouts of dictatorship - maybe. But assuming Greece, now with Thrace and Constantinople, is still Axis-occupied, is Stalin still content to assign Greece 90% to Britain in the infamous percentages agreement, and brush Red Army forces completely to the north and past the prewar Greco-Bulgarian border? Or will he be just too tempted to have the Soviet Army occupy Thrace and Constantinople and establish an ELAS-fronted, KKE-controlled government set up for Greece or at least that Thracian region giving Moscow strategic control over at least half of the straits?\n\nFirst you need to have EAM/ELAS in the first place. Which needs a Metaxas regime and return of the monarchy embittering the Greek centrists (the Venizelist parties) enough that during the early occupation they care more about the return of the king and thus giving space to EAM to dominate the resistance. Arguably not happening TTL. If for no other reason because the Constantinople Greeks are voting in Greek elections TTL and the Asia Minor/Thrace refugees were voting by 80-90% margins for the Venizelists. Which means a Venizelist victory in the 1933 elections and no restoration of the monarchy."
