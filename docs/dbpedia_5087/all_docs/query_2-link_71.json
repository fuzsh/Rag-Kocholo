        "text": "The popularity of the series has led to its adaptation into Hollywood film, another example ACG globalization. Silent Hill (2006, Christopher Gans) is a retelling of the first video game and was met with mixed critical reception. Silent Hill Revelation 3D (2012, Michael Bassett) was released recently as a sequel to the first film, and served as a retelling of Silent Hill 3, and met with overwhelmingly negative reviews. Though the later games and films weren’t warmly received, it cannot be denied that exporting Silent Hill has extended its reach to further audiences.\n\nSilent Hill Multimedia\n\nSilent Hill is largely held to be a defining and innovating video game in the survival horror genre. The first game has been hailed as one of the scariest games of all times. It is highly influential in its genre, with many games sharing similar elements, like usage of atmosphere, reminiscent of art house and Japanese horror films like Ju-on (2000, Takashi Shimizu). The Siren series, developed a member of the now defunct Team Silent, Keiichiro Toyama, shares a dark atmosphere. Alan Wake is compared to Silent Hill 2 due to similarities in the dark atmosphere and in the plot in looking for a wife (though I must admit, dead wife sending a letter takes the cake for being much more macabre).\n\nSoundtracks and art books have been produced. Akira Yamaoka, a fan favorite, composed soundtracks for the franchise (except for Downpour). Art books, like Drawing Block: Silent Hill 3 Program,filled with screenshots from the games were released as well. Lost Memories: The Art and Music of Silent Hill was released in 2003, including all of the soundtracks, creature galleries, music videos, and trailer collections.\n\nThe series has found itself adapted to different mediums including print media, films, and spin-off video games. A series of comics based on the Silent Hill series was released from 2004-2008, with all but two written by American author Scott Ciencin. Light novel adaptations of the first two games, written by Sadamu Yamashita, have been produced as well. As mentioned before, the films, though not particularly well received, have made the series more open outside of the gaming community and the exposure has introduced new fans to the games. Most people are now aware of Silent Hill as “the one where that one girl gets her skin ripped off.” Silent Hill: The Arcade was released in 2007, a departure from survival horror into a basic rail gun shooter. Silent Hill: Orphan and Orphan 2 were point and click games released for the mobile phone. Silent Hill’s impact on ACG culture can be felt through multimedia convergence and through its influence on the survival horror video game genre.\n\nConclusion"
