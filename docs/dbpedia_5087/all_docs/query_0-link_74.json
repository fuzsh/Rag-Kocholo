        "text": "I’ve been recently revisiting gaming theme songs that are often deemed classics of their respective genres. Halo’s angelic choir set the stage for a space epic, while Uncharted’s more light-hearted, upbeat theme signaled the call to adventure. However, one theme song from a popular horror gaming series that I feel is somewhat overlooked for its tremendous technicality and impact is Silent Hill. Composed by Akira Yamaoka, Silent Hill’s theme song is truly evocative, despite being one of the most subtle pieces of music I’ve heard in a game. Here’s why.\n\nSilent Hill isn’t your average horror game, that’s for sure. Everything from its ingenious, and now iconic, world design to the various nightmares that inhabit it all stem for a deep psychological fear of isolation, grief, and terror in the face of the unknown. We’ve seen this theme tackled before in video games, but it was Silent Hill that made it a core component of the experience. It made the task of creating a theme song quite tremendous for Yamaoka, who had to capture all of this in audio. Safe to say, he had done it, and in a spectacular fashion.\n\nThe eerie theme song comprises of intentionally out-of-tune guitars strummed in light, rapid plucking. This musical arrangement, and short intro to the song, has become instantly synonymous with the Silent Hill games, encapsulating its morbid beauty, mystery, and horror all at once. The song then transforms into a soft rock ballad instrumental that would feel right at home in any 90s supernatural television show, but it never rises above being anything more than deceptively simplistic – its greatest strength. Unlike a majority of theme songs that feel the need to excessively build upon its stinger melody with needless orchestra and battle themes that shift in tone, Silent Hill’s theme song is kept relatively one-note in its execution. We don’t hear any drastic dips or bombastic orchestras over the course of the entire song; instead, it introduces a melancholy melody (say that twice as fast) that digs itself into your mind.\n\nThe track also features a very gritty layer that sounds like it’s being played on a dusty record player. It gives the song this dark, potent aesthetic that adds to the production value. Furthermore, it keeps the theme low-key, never feeling like a polished, expensively produced piece of music that wouldn’t feel out of place in an orchestra concert. You’d be better off hearing this theme song in a dingy, dark alley at night, adding to the horror of the uncertain and the fear of being vulnerable.\n\nYamaoka clearly wanted to portray the level of psychological horror that Silent Hill imposed through music, and he managed to do that with how off-kilter and disturbing the song actually is, despite also being a soft rock piece that’s somewhat relaxing, yet unsettling. The real beauty of this composition is how it subtly builds during its final minute; a violin enters the track that lingers in the background. You can’t quite pin one specific melody to its erratic, yet tragic disjointedness, as if someone is experiencing an overwhelmingly sad feeling amidst horrific thoughts. This lends itself to the structure of the Silent Hill games, which also features characters that undergo psychological changes, usually spiraling into insanity or overbearing grief.\n\nA quick listen of the song wouldn’t instantly take you to Silent Hill, but it works hand in hand with creating an atmosphere that’s unsettling, mysterious, and effectively scary. The theme song has been revised countless times for newer games, but the original song for the first game remains a timeless classic that demonstrates the power of subtlety; how you don’t really need to complicate a theme song with pointless orchestra and high-production value. All you need is a simple melody, a creative vision, and a keen understanding of the game to craft an audible masterpiece."
