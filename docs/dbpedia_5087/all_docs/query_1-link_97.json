        "text": "Fantastic news for Silent Hill fans: The franchise is set to return to the silver screen with Return to Silent Hill, an adaptation of Konami’s classic horror game Silent Hill 2. While the film was originally announced in March, we now have a preview of the infamous Pyramid Head courtesy of Variety.\n\nChristophe Gans, director of the 2006 Silent Hill film, is returning to the fog-filled universe with a script co-written by Sandra Vo-Anh and William Josef Schneider.\n\nAccording to the synopsis, Jeremy Irvine will play James, \"a man broken after being separated from his one true love,\" played by Hannah Emily Anderson. He returns to Silent Hill to find her, but the town is \"transformed by an unknown evil\" he must battle as he tracks down his lost love.\n\n“Return to Silent Hill is a mythological love story about someone so deeply in love, they’re willing to go to hell to save someone,” Gans tells Deadline. \"I’m delighted to have the wonderful talents of both Jeremy Irvine and Hannah Emily Anderson take us on this journey into a psychological horror world that I hope will both satisfy and surprise fans of Silent Hill.\"\n\nProducer Victor Hadid notes that he and Gans have been working closely with Konami and promises \"iconic monsters\" paired with new designs."
