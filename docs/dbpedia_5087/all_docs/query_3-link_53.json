        "text": "BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n©2021, by M. Keith Booker\n\nSupernatural horror lies at the very heart of horror itself. It is also central to the cultural history of humanity. The sense that there might be other realities out there than our own, peopled by unknown and potentially monstrous entities with powers beyond ours, has been a part of human culture from the very beginning. Almost all religions posit the existence of monstrous Others, with Judeo-Christianity’s (and Islam’s) Satan standing at the very forefront of such beings. Because the rich legacy of myths, legends, superstitions, and religious visions provides fertile material for the imagining of supernatural horror stories, it should come as no surprise that supernatural horror lies at the very roots of horror cinema. Supernatural horror is not only one of the oldest, but also one of the richest veins in the horror tradition. In addition, many other types of horror subgenres contain supernatural elements. Vampires, in particular, are almost always envisioned as supernatural creatures, while even slashers such as Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees (and especially Freddy Kreuger) clearly have certain supernatural characteristics. This discussion, however, will focus on three particular kinds of horror films that draw their energies from almost entirely supernatural sources: ghost stories (including haunted house films), stories about witches, and stories about demons (including demonic possession and demonic cults). It should be noted, however, that there are other forms of supernatural horror and that many supernatural horror films could be placed in more than one of these categories. For example, Rosemary’s Baby, one of the greatest of all supernatural horror films, could be considered a witchcraft film, but it could also be considered a film about demonic possession or about a demonic cult. It is discussed here.\n\nThe kinds of stories covered in these categories have strong roots in religion and superstition that are quite ancient, while their modern form grows particularly out of the Gothic tradition that arose in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. With all this background, it is not surprising that the modern supernatural horror film (that is, the horror film in the sound era) is essentially as old as sound film itself[1]. Actually, what is surprising is that supernatural horror wasn’t more prominent in the early sound era. Apart from the fact that the first horror film of the sound era, Dracula (1931), had strong supernatural elements, early directors of horror films in the sound era seemed to be a bit squeamish about moving into supernatural horror, perhaps for fear of offending Christian audiences or perhaps simply for fear that such films would be too frightening for audiences with little experience of such things.\n\nBefore proceeding to outline the historical development of the supernatural horror film, I should note that there are numerous potential sources of horror imagery than the primarily Christian sources around which this chapter is structured. Native American mythology is rich in supernatural imagery, for example, though it has thus far been underutilized in horror film. It has occasionally appeared, though, as in the case of Larry Fessenden’s Wendigo (2001), which employs the Native American supernatural creature of the title as a key motif. On the other hand, the Wendigo of this film really features only in the (very unsatisfactory) ending to what is otherwise a fairly effective hillbilly horror film. Here, a family from New York City travels into the Catskills for an outing in the country, having been loaned the use of a friend’s country home. There, they are tormented by a crazed local who has a grudge against the owners of the house, which he regards as his rightful heritage. He ends up killing the father of the family, then is himself badly hurt (possibly fatally) after an apparent encounter with a Wendigo.\n\nAmong the strangest supernatural entities to have featured in horror films are the “kratts” of the 2017 Estonian film November. This film features a village of nineteenth-century Estonian peasants who lived in a world saturated with magi, heavily populated with supernatural entities, including ghosts, werewolves, and witches. But the most striking supernatural creatures are the “kratts,” which are distinctive entities derived from Estonian folk culture. A kratt can be built of almost any materials, as when the kratts of the film are weirdly cobbled together from leftover household junk, with results that are weird-looking to the extreme. A kratt can then be animated by the Devil in exchange for three drops of blood from the kratt’s owner, who can then employ the kratt as a sort of servant. Given all the magic in this world, it is not surprising that the characters of the film attempt to solve their problems via magic—not, however, with very good results.\n\nThe recent rise to global prominence of South Korean horror film has, predictably introduced supernatural motifs with a distinctively Korean spin. One of the most interesting of these is The Wailing (2016), directed by Na Hong-jin. Here, a series of strange (and bloody) events in a remote Korean town are at first a total mystery to the local authorities, especially the film’s protagonist, policeman Jong-goo (Kwak D-won). At first, Jong-goo seems a rather comic figure, afraid of his own shadow, which complicates the decoding of the film as it goes forward. There are also several important twists and turns that seriously complicate our own understanding of what is going on. Ultimately, the central event of the film is the possession of Jong-goo’s young daughter Hyo-jin (Kim Hwan-hee) by an evil spirit, ultimately causing her to kill her entire family, including her father. The exact nature of the evil spirit is never made entirely clear, though Satan himself (in the form of a Japanese man who has come to town) might be involved, with some of the locals as minions. There are also some Catholic priests, though they are of little help and have little impact on the plot, which does not necessarily depend upon a Christian mythology, though the film does begin with a Biblical epigraph. And, though there is certainly no Christ to be found in the film, there might be an Antichrist. Long, slow, and absolutely demented, The Wailing essentially makes up its own mythology from a stew of ingredients from both Christianity and Korean folklore. Many horror films have been accused of over-explaining their offbeat elements; no danger of that here.\n\nFinally, just as a reminder that other cultures might have other sorts of supernatural entities, I might mention in some detail the 2013 film Djinn, made in Abu Dhabi with money from the U.A.E. and featuring mostly Arab actors, but directed by American Tobe Hooper. Hooper, of course, is a near-legend in horror-film circles, having directed such horror classics as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Poltergeist (1982), and the producers of the film clearly hoped that bringing him aboard would lend legitimacy to their project, which premiered at the 2013 Abu Dhabi Film Festival and was designed to help put Arab horror films on the map of global culture. Made very much within the confines of the Western genre of horror, but drawing its supernatural elements from the Islamic mythology of the djinn, the film features dialogue in both English and Arabic, thus furthering it status as an example of East-West cross-cultural exchange. At the same time, the use of this mythology presents the film with an opportunity for cross-cultural education. Americans whose image of djinn derives largely from the genies of the television series I Dream of Jeannie (1965–1970) or the Disney film Aladdin (1992) might certainly be surprised by the menacing jinn of Djinn.[2]\n\nThe plot of the film has cross-cultural elements as well. It begins as a young married Arab couple, Khalid (Khalid Laith) and Salama (Razane Jammal), have just suffered an unspecified personal trauma in America, where they have lived together for the past several years. Despite Salama’s reluctance, they then return to the U.A.E. (where her family still lives) to get a fresh start, after Khalid arranges for his company to transfer him there. The two are put up in a posh company-furnished apartment in a brand-new (and still largely empty) high-rise building, constructed on the site of an ancient fishing village that seems to be located in the middle of nowhere—a company-supplied car and driver take Khalid back and forth from work each day in what amounts to a four-hour round trip.\n\nThe building, of course, turns out to be haunted by the djinn who had inhabited the fishing village before the high-rise was constructed there. This motif has strong allegorical resonances, as the jinn and their village can be taken to represent forces of tradition in conflict with a modernity that is reflected in the high-rise, an extremely modern building that is made more, rather than less, so by the fact that its interior décor seems designed to recall classic Arabic architecture—or perhaps the architecture of Moorish Spain. In fact, the styling of the arched doorways and other design features is so reminiscent of earlier Islamic models that it seems ostentatiously artificial, making the building a sort of postmodern pastiche of traditional Islamic design, imprinted upon the basic matrix of a modern high-rise, thus combining elements from the architectures of two different historical periods in the signature mode of postmodern architecture.\n\nMore than an authentic Arab structure, the high-rise seems like a simulacrum of an Arab structure, something that might be found in Las Vegas or a Disney theme park. The Las Vegas comparison might be especially apt given the setting in the U.A.E., given that cities such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi are artificial constructions sprouting out of the desert as miracles of modern capitalism, much like Las Vegas itself. Certain elements of the high-rise, meanwhile, are reminiscent of the Morocco Pavilion in Disney World’s Epcot Center. Elements of the high-rise are also reminiscent of a sort of Disneyfied Alhambra, the ninth-century castle-fortress built in Moorish Spain, which is especially interesting given that the high-rise itself is called Al Hamra (the Arabic version of the Spanish “Alhambra”). On the other hand, this name derives directly from that of Jazirat Al Hamra, an actual abandoned fishing village in the Emirate of Ras al Khaimah that is supposedly haunted by djinn.[3]\n\nIf much of Djinn thus derives quite directly from local lore in the U.A.E., the basic premise of the filmalso has much in common with Poltergeist, in which a modern suburb has been constructed on the site of an old cemetery. Both Poltergeist and Djinn thus generate their horror from a sort of return of the repressed, from revenge taken by tradition (in the form of supernatural ghosts or djinn from the past) against modernity (in the form of a contemporary family) for the destruction wrought by modernity on traditional ways of life. To add still another international element to Djinn, the nebulous, scurrying, black-cloaked djinn of the film are visually reminiscent of the ghosts in Japanese horror films such as Ju-On: The Grudge (2002). But the echoes of American horror films are particularly strong in Djinn, as when the nearly-deserted high-rise is in many ways also reminiscent of the Overlook Hotel in The Shining (1980). What the film is most reminiscent of, though, is Rosemary’s Baby (1968), especially as supernatural babies are central to the plot. Khalid, it turns out, is the son of a djinn mother, and he and some creepy neighbors in the building are central to Salama’s undoing, just as Rosemary’s husband conspires with devil-worshipping neighbors in Rosemary’s Baby. It even turns out that the personal tragedy that occurred to Salama and Khalid in America involved Salama’s killing of their first baby when it began to manifest djinn characteristics.\n\nDjinn was largely panned by critics, especially in the West. Jay Weissberg of Variety found the film “cheesy” and “ham-fisted,” while Ronan Doyle declared it to be “terrible” and “shoddily-shot.” Such critics have objected, especially, to the extent to which Djinn echoes predecessors such as Rosemary’s Baby, finding that these echoes made the film derivative and uninventive, thus missing an opportunity to inject new energies into the horror genre via the Middle Eastern setting and the Islamic mythology. Some in the Middle East objected to the Western texture of the film as well, and it was rumored (though never confirmed) that the two-year gap between the close of filming and the release of the film came about either because U.A.E. officials thought the film’s representation of the U.A.E. was objectionable or simply because the horror genre as a whole was so foreign to local tastes that the entire project came to be viewed as problematic.[4] That said, the film did get some positive reviews in the Arab world, who felt that its use of Middle Eastern mythology might appeal to Arab viewers in a way that Western horror films couldn’t, especially given its focus on a modern Arab couple whose life experiences might mirror those of many Arab viewers. On the other hand, while Djinn supplies a bit of Quranic mythology as background to the djinn motif, in practice the djinn of the film seem pretty much the same as the ghosts and demons American audiences have already seen so many times.[5]\n\nFinally, one Western horror film that doesn’t fit well within my categorization scheme is Andy Muschietti’s It (2017), which grossed over $700 million worldwide and thus became the top-grossing horror film of all time. It is essentially the story of a haunting, but in this case an entire town, rather than a single house, is haunted. And the haunting entity, the “It” of the title, is a supernatural, dimension-hopping, shape-shifting clown who does not quite seem to be either a ghost or a conventional demon. In any case, this film, based on Stephen King’s 1986 novel of the same title, details the way in which It haunts the town of Derry, Maine, returning every twenty-seven years for a rampage of killing, especially of children. “It” is an ideal horror film monster: though its default identity is Pennywise the Dancing Clown, It can manifest itself in different ways as well, showing a special proclivity for taking on the form of whatever frightens a specific victim the most.\n\nIn the film, which begins with a prologue set in the fall of 1988 but is mostly set in the summer of 1989, It again attacks Derry, but is this time defeated by a combined effort of marginalized early teens who call themselves the Losers’ Club. They are a quintessential group of young teen outsider “types.” Their leader is Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher), a stutterer whose six-year-old brother is killed in the prologue. They also include a sickly kid whose obese mother nurtures his illnesses (Eddie Kaspbrak, played by Jack Dylan Grazer), a Jewish kid (Stan Uris, played by Wyatt Oleff), and even (gasp) a girl (Beverly Marsh, played by Sophia Lillis). Beverly is marginalized both by her gender and by her (undeserved) reputation for promiscuity. Several of the kids, in fact, are doubly marginalized. Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor) is both fat and the new kid in school; Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs) is both black and home-schooled; the bespectacled Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard) is also a loudmouth clown who seems desperate for approval. All are in one way or another hampered by their family situations, the most troubling of which in the film involves Beverly’s incest-inclined father. They are also seriously oppressed by a gang of local bullies, so that It is definitely only one of their problems.\n\nIndeed, It is as much an exploration of what it is like to come of age in a small town in the late 1980s than it is a horror film. Its focus on the 1980s, including heavy use of period music in the soundtrack, has a nostalgic air, as the kids tool about town on their bikes in what appears to be a simpler age. In this, It participates in a wave of recent films that have been dominated by eighties nostalgia, including such entries as Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One (2018). At times, the film seems almost Spielbergian, in fact, except that it refuses to paint the 1980s in entirely rosey hues: most of the character, in fact, have pretty terrible lives. Probably the most interesting thing about the film’s treatment of 1980s nostalgia, meanwhile, is the fact that King’s novel, written just over 30 years before the release of the film, is filled with 1950s nostalgia, which is then moved forward to the 1980s in the film. That novel, meanwhile, is also set partly in the 1980s, when the children are roughly 40, another 27-year cycle having passed. It deals only with the earlier segment of the novel. The later segment will be dealt with in a sequel, It: Chapter Two, scheduled to be released in late summer, 2019.\n\nThe Rise of Supernatural Horror Films\n\nMost horror films of the 1930s only touched on supernatural elements, while focusing on more down-to-earth materials such as mad scientists. For example, Edgar G. Ulmer’s The Black Cat (1934), an early horror masterpiece that features both Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, the two biggest stars of early horror films, is primarily a mad scientist film. However, it also stipulates that Karloff’s Hjalmar Poelzig, though clearly a mad scientist type, is the leader of a Satanic cult, thus placing the film in contact with the kinds of supernatural horror films with which I am concerned here.\n\nIt is also the case that (just as early horror films were, more often than not, set outside the United States) early supernatural horror films often tended to focus on non-Western and non-Christian mythologies, perhaps to avoid potential controversy. For example, Paul Wegener and Henrik Galeen’s German silent film The Golem (1915) and its successors drew upon Jewish mystical traditions and are rooted in the Middle East. Golem films never really took off in the sound era, though they have continued to appear here and there[6]. Voodoo has also served as a source of exotic horror, as in Victor Halperin’s White Zombie (1932), which is often considered the first zombie film, though it has very little in common with the later kind of zombie film made prominent by George Romero. The zombies of White Zombie are old school Haitian voodoo zombies, essentially ghosts with bodies. Meanwhile, the zombies themselves are more victim than monster, created by the evil voodoo sorcerer Murder Legendre (Bela Lugosi), somewhat like the beastmen of Island of Lost Souls are created by Moreau. Even Madeleine Short (Madge Bellamy), the female lead, is turned into a zombie by Legendre so he can make her do his bidding (with possible sexual implications), but Legendre himself is killed, and Madeleine is saved. There is a fair amount of racial and gender stereotyping here, but this is one that can be read against the grain with just a little effort to potentially produce a critique of those stereotypes. It’s also really creepy in places.\n\nEgyptian mythology was central to one of the first major American horror film to focus on almost entirely supernatural materials. Universal’s The Mummy (1932), released five months after White Zombie, has been described as essentially being a remake of Dracula from the year before, and it pretty much is—with a Transylvanian vampire replaced by an Egyptian mummy mystically raised from the dead and come to England to seduce a British woman. In this case, the mummy is one Imhotep, played by Boris Karloff, and the woman is Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann), whom Imhotep believes is the reincarnation of his old love from ancient Egypt, Princess Ankh-es-en-amon. This notion is supported by the fact that Helen’s mother is Egyptian, though this convenient fact also probably made the notion of a romance between an Egyptian man and a British woman more palatable for audiences at the time. This film differs from Dracula, though, in that Imhotep, while suitably spooky, is at least partly sympathetic, due to the theme of lost love as well as to Karloff’s compelling performance. Ultimately, Imhotep is struck down by the same magic that resurrects him, and we see him age thousands of years in seconds, ultimately turning to dust in a conceit that would be repeated in many a subsequent film. In this film, the Orientalism that underlies many a classic horror film is openly displayed front and center, and the film participates in a wave of Orientalist fascination that swept the West after the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922. Still, the sympathy shown for Imhotep and the fact that Helen is half-Egyptian both complicate the film and make it a lot less racist than it might have been.\n\nThe Mummy was the founding text of a whole franchise of Mummy movies, though it had no literal sequels. Instead, it was rebooted in The Mummy’s Hand (1940), which then had several sequels of its own, including The Mummy’s Tomb (1942), The Mummy’s Ghost (1944), and The Mummy’s Curse (1944). The franchise then joined Universal’s comedy-horror crossover parade with Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy (1955). Meanwhile, with the full implementation of the Hollywood Production Code in 1934, it became even harder to produce supernatural horror films, even though the Code had very little to say about the supernatural itself.\n\nVoodoo returned as a key topic in King of the Zombies (1941), from Poverty Row studio Monogram Pictures. This film is a combined zombie/World War II film that features virtuous Americans doing battle with unscrupulous Nazis. However, it was released more than six months before the U.S. entered the war against Germany. It thus joins other works of American culture in 1941 (the famous comic book cover of Captain America punching out Adolf Hitler in the spring of 1941 is perhaps the best-known case) in anticipating the war, thus undermining the now-popular notion that the U.S. was blindsided by Pearl Harbor and somehow previously had no idea what was going on in the world. Here, a plane carrying an American agent crashes on a Caribbean island where a German mad scientist (played by Henry Victor, who had played the strongman Hercules in Freaks, though the role was originally meant for Bela Lugosi), is attempting to use voodoo and zombies to extract secrets from a captive American admiral. Silly as it sounds, it’s played fairly straight, except for the presence of the bug-eyed, ever-frightened Mantan Moreland as the agent’s black manservant, who provides the comic relief in a racist mode that, in retrospect, makes the Americans seem uncomfortably similar to the Nazis. Moreland, though, has a certain amount of on-screen charisma and actually makes his character more interesting and sympathetic than he has any right to be. This turkey actually garnered an Academy Award nomination (for best score), and it’s definitely watchable—if only to see what outrageous and offensive thing they’ll do next. There’s even a sequel, the 1943 Revenge of the Zombies.\n\nBy the 1940s, most of the energies of the “horror” genre were going into the emergent phenomenon of film noir, even though the film industry itself didn’t even realize it yet. This situation was addressed to some extent when RKO charged the young, unknown Russian-born producer Val Lewton with the task of making horror movies for them. It was one of the best decisions anyone in Hollywood ever made, and Lewton turned out a string of horror classics that have, by now, gained near legendary status. The first, and possibly best, of these was Cat People (1942), directed by French-born Jacques Tourneur, who would subsequently work with Lewton on I Walked With a Zombie (1943, again with supernatural zombies) and The Leopard Man (1943) as well, though he is perhaps best known for the film noir classic Out of the Past (1947). Cat People is a stylistic and atmospheric tour-de-force that, among other things, serves as a prime example of the lush black-and-white cinematography that would set Lewton’s horror films apart from their contemporaries, giving them something of the look of the best noir films. Thematically, it’s largely a collection of clichés, including a link between feminine sexuality and big cats that had already been seen in the Panther Woman Lota in Island of Lost Souls. It’s also an entry in the evil-comes-from-the-primitive-Balkans sub-genre of horror film (which dates back to Dracula), mixed with the all-cats-are-evil motif so commonly found in American film. Here, a Serbian woman (played by a French actress on the theory that any European can serve to signify foreignness) comes to America, feeling lost, but falls in love with and marries an American man. The relationship seems promising at first, but then it all goes terribly wrong, partly because she hails from a village with a legacy of devil worship and so might be bearing a curse that turns her into a dangerous cat if she gets too passionate. All of that might sound like a hackneyed B-picture. It isn’t, though. It’s a brilliant masterpiece of a B-picture, despite how any plot summary makes it sound. It truly has to be seen to be believed. It was remade in 1982 with Nastassja Kinski as the cat woman (and with a great song by David Bowie). The remake was in lurid, living color, which is probably one reason why it is not nearly as good as the original.\n\nOf all the Val Lewton horror films, The Seventh Victim (1943), directed by Mark Robson, is probably the one that seems most like a fairly straight film noir. However, it does feature a Satanic cult that in some ways anticipates the one in Rosemary’s Baby. Lots of twists, though, including the fact that the cult members are pledged to nonviolence, which puts a bit of a damper on the horror. Moreover, as one would expect of Lewton, it’s not really about the scariness of Satan or anything supernatural. This one is about the fundamental strangeness and scariness of other people, no matter how well we think we know them. Of course, that’s largely true of Rosemary’s Baby, as well.\n\nThe Lewton-produced Curse of the Cat People (1944) was Robert Wise’s first real directorial effort, though he took over the film midway when the original director was fired for working too slowly. Such is the world of low-budget film. But this one is a gem. It has absolutely nothing to do with Cat People (or cat people), and very little to do with conventional horror (though it has a ghost of sorts). But it captures very nicely the genuine horror of being a child in an adult world. In this sense it is typical of Lewton, whose horror films often only pretend to be about supernatural phenomena, but are really very much about the terrors of daily life in the modern world. They sometimes seem simply to express or even endorse fear of things like feminine sexuality or nonWestern cultures, but just a little interpretive twist can produce critique. This one is particularly powerful as an antidote to all those horror films in which various demon children are terrifying to adults. If kids scare us adults, just think how we look to them.\n\nAs horror film moved into the 1950s, American horror came to be dominated by science fictional monster movies, while British horror was dominated by reboots of the Universal monster franchises. Near the end of the 1950s, however, there were signs of a turn toward horror films of the type I am concerned with in this chapter. This new trend began with ghost stories, but witches and demons were not far behind.\n\nGhost Stories\n\nMost cinematic ghost stories before World War II turned out only to look like ghost stories—but ended up supplying a rational explanation for what had seemed to be supernatural events or simply to treat the ghosts as comic motifs. The Uninvited (1944) was an important deviation from this trend in that it featured real ghosts that were treated seriously. It still isn’t really scary, though, at least not by today’s standards, though it does feature some superb cinematography. And there is some genuine emotional tension at the center of the story, as young Stella Meredith (Gail Russell) is caught in the middle of a struggle between two ghosts, one her natural mother, one her adopted one. Though an American film (made by Paramount) with American actors[7], The Uninvited is set in a haunted house on the west coast of England, continuing the early tendency to set horror films outside the United States. The film was shot, however, in California and Arizona, England at the time being subject to German bombing during World War II.\n\nGenuine ghost stories remained rare in American film, however, until the end of the 1950s, when a flurry of such films began to appear from both Britain and America. Still, even House on Haunted Hill (1959), one of the best-known of the horror films directed by William Castle, the P. T. Barnum of late-1950s horror film directors (and later, oddly enough, the producer of Rosemary’s Baby), actually involves a fake haunting. This one is an excellent atmospheric haunted house film in many ways, even if the haunting turns out to be fake, part of a mundane murder plot (and counter-plot). The film is best-known, though, for the promotional gimmick known as “Emergo,” which basically involved running a plastic skeleton on a wire over the heads of the audience at a key moment in the film when a skeleton (which also turns out to be fake) emerges from a pit of acid to wreak revenge on its “killer.” It’s also known for featuring Vincent Price as millionaire Fredrick Loren, who offers $10,000 each to a group of individuals if they can manage to stay in the haunted house for one night. It’s not that badly done, though the best part is the financial angle, which offers the possibility of reading the whole film as an allegory about the cutthroat nature of capitalism. Here, the needy have to be willing to do anything or suffer any indignity to obtain money, while the rich pull their strings.\n\nThe Innocents (1961) is a British adaptation of Henry James’s The Turn of the Screw, via William Archibald’s 1950s stage adaptation of that novella. Here Deborah Kerr plays Miss Giddens, the governess who is hired to go to a remote country estate to take care of two children whom she becomes convinced have been possessed by the ghosts of two former servants who died in the house. The beauty of this film is that it manages (like The Turn of the Screw) to maintain an undecidable tension between this supernatural explanation for events and a more down-to-earth one (that the governess is insane). This tension might arise from the original novel, but it is possibly reinforced by the fact that director Jack Clayton wanted to emphasize the supernatural aspects of the story, while main writer Truman Capote wanted to emphasize the psychology of the repressed governess as the source of the seemingly supernatural events she witnesses. Whatever the source of the tension between these two emphases, this one is a jewel, one of the great haunted house movies ever made. Kerr is terrific as the governess, and the excellent cinematography (by Freddie Francis, who shot or directed a number of the Hammer horror films, among many other things) helps to create a genuinely disturbing atmosphere. The ending is especially strong and especially creepy. Just as it seems that the film is finally going to opt for a genuinely supernatural focus, the governess makes one last gesture that throws everything into doubt.\n\nTzvetan Todorov points to The Turn of the Screw as a central example of what he calls the “fantastic,” a narrative in which it remains undecidable whether seemingly supernatural events are really supernatural or actually have a rational explanation. That sort of uncertainty is rare in films, which generally (as with House on Haunted Hill) resolve into a rational, non-supernatural interpretation (what Todorov calls the “uncanny”) or into a genuinely supernatural interpretation (what Todorov calls the “marvelous”). The Haunting (1963) veers decidedly into the territory of the marvelous. Though a British-made film, The Haunting was directed by American Robert Wise and based on an American novel, Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House (1959), one of the classics of the genre (and an important influence on people like Stephen King)[8]. Here, paranormal investigator Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) leads a group to check out the reported haunting of a creepy old mansion. Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris) and Theodora (just Theodora, played by Claire Bloom) are the central threatened females in the group, with Eleanor seeming particularly vulnerable, though her own psychological problems (traceable to her domineering mother) may also be the source of some of the manifestations she thinks she experiences. Terrified through much of the film, she nevertheless clearly welcomes the attention she seems to be getting from the haunted house, having basically experienced nothing previously in life except the dominance of her mother. In the end, she is killed in a car crash while fleeing the house, which possibly allows her to join the house’s ghosts … forever. Lots of very creepy atmosphere make this one quite effective, while also providing a good demonstration that scary things you can’t see in movies are scarier than things you can see. This one, in fact, is widely regarded as one of the scariest movies of all time. It was listed at No. 1 on Martin Scorsese’s 2009 list of the scariest horror movies.\n\nWhere The Haunting is elegant, American movies about ghosts were a bit more raw in the early 1960s. However, Herk Harvey’s Carnival of Souls (1962) is a very effective film that is in many ways the quintessential cult horror film. Made on a shoestring budget with low production values and mostly amateur actors, the film got very little attention on its initial release. It wasn’t, in fact, even copyrighted and went straight into the public domain. In subsequent years, however, it has gained a growing audience (largely because of its effective creation of a genuinely creepy atmosphere), and has even been released on a Criterion Collection DVD. Candace Hilligoss plays Mary Henry, who is ostensibly killed in a drag racing accident at the beginning of the film, as the car in which she is riding plunges off a bridge into the river. Then she seems inexplicably to emerge from the river virtually unscathed, though a bit shaken up. Subsequently, she seems weirdly out of phase with the people and things around her, while experiencing strange and disturbing hallucinations (not to mention the attentions of the truly noxious would-be Romeo with whom she shares a boarding house). All of this ultimately leads to a scene in a very disturbing abandoned amusement park where a group of the walking dead follow Mary to the nearby beach and take her down. Afterward, the cops find tracks in the sand (terminating in the middle of the beach), but nothing else. Then, in the film’s final scene, the original car is pulled from the river, and we see that Mary’s is among the corpses in the car. Hilligoss, one of the few professional actors in the film, is quite good as Mary, while Sidney Berger is a hoot as the Romeo. Most of the other actors are quite bad, but that’s actually good, because it nicely enhances the sense of strangeness and unreality with which Mary finds herself surrounded. Of course, it doesn’t help that she moves to Salt Lake City to take a job as a church organist right after the accident, which would make anybody’s life seem strange, but we are left to wonder in the end whether the bulk of the film was simply Mary’s dying fantasy, whether she somehow unnaturally escaped death in the river and then had to be brought back to the other side by death’s minions, or what. Doesn’t really matter, because the whole point of the film is its atmosphere and Mary’s sense of estrangement, which of course makes her emblematic of life in late capitalism as a whole. This one definitely deserves its cult status. And it anticipates a number of “I didn’t know I was dead” movies, such as The Sixth Sense (1999).\n\nSpeaking of low-budget horror, Roger Corman was the king of low-budget filmmaking in the early 1960s. The Terror (1963) features Corman directing a young Jack Nicholson (as he did multiple times), along with Dick Miller, Sandra Knight (Nicholson’s then-wife), and even Boris Karloff. It’s not the greatest movie in the world, but it’s fun to watch Karloff (then 76 and about as rickety as the cheap sets) and Nicholson (then 26) together. The greatness of years past meets the greatness of years future. Anyway, set mostly in a cheesy-looking castle somewhere in nineteenth-century Europe, the film features Knight as the apparent ghost of the former young wife of the now-old Baron von Leppe (Karloff), who supposedly caught her in flagrante and murdered her many years earlier. She now haunts the castle, trying to lure the Baron to his doom. There are lots of twists and turns and mistaken identities, but the details don’t much matter. In the end everybody gets killed except Nicholson’s Andre Duvalier, a French officer who just happens on the castle after riding his horse along the beach. Then he ends up creeped out after he rescues the “ghost,” thinking she might be a real girl, only to have her dissolve into goo for reasons that are not entirely clear, though she may simply be a sort of golem created by a local witch, her usefulness now over. There is also a great scene in which the castle starts to flood and collapse and large chunks of “stone” fall into the water and float. Corman understood very well that sometimes such things just don’t really matter in a certain kind of movie.\n\nIn 1965, Kwaidan put Japanese film on the ghost-movie map, anticipating the later prominence of Japanese films in that category. It doesn’t much resemble later films like Ringu or Ju-On, however. Instead, it’s an anthology of four different meditative, dreamlike ghost stories (based on Japanese folktales) that runs for more than three hours. There is actually quite a bit of action, but much of the film is spent building atmosphere—and quite effectively so. Roger Ebert described it as one of the most beautiful films he had ever seen, and he saw a lot of films. This one, in fact, is well worth watching just for the hallucinogenic visuals, even if it proceeds almost in slow motion by the standards of today’s horror films.\n\nLike The Haunting, John Hough’s The Legend of Hell House (1973) is a British haunted-house film based on an American novel, this time a novel by Richard Matheson, who also wrote the screenplay for the film. Actually, The Legend of Hell House resembles The Haunting in a number of ways, including the basic plot, which involves a team of paranormal investigators who have come to try to determine whether the house in question is truly haunted. Indeed, The Legend of Hell House reads almost like a more sensational and pop cultural remake of The Haunting, perhaps showing a bit of the influence of the Hammer Horror visual style (though Legend is not, itself, a Hammer film).\n\nAmong the many important developments in 1970s horror, Japanese horror really began to show its versatility with the 1978 film Hausu (“House”). Here, a gaggle of giggling Japanese schoolgirls go to spend summer vacation at the remote home of the aunt of one of the girls. But the aunt turns out to be some sort of ghoul and the house turns out to be demonically possessed, killing off the girls one by one. But that brief summary of the film’s completely banal plot does not begin to capture what this bizarre film is like. Many of the scenes look like crazy Japanese TV commercials, or maybe music videos. Indeed, director Nobuhiko Obayhashi had worked extensively in TV commercials before this film. Meanwhile, the strange visuals are accompanied by a whimsical and often upbeat soundtrack that is completely out of sync with the subject matter of the film. One reviewer called this one a “retarded hybrid of Rocky Horror and Whispering Corridors,” but it definitely has a style of its own and needs to be experienced on its own. Hausu well deserves the cult status it has gained since its release in American theaters in 2009.\n\nIt took that long for Hausu to have a big impact in America, though the original film was released at a time when American horror itself was about to experience a sort of Renaissance. The period from the release of Halloween in 1978 through the early years of the 1980s is known primarily for the slasher film explosion of that period, but other forms of horror were booming as well. In fact, American genre film as a whole was experiencing quite an upswing at this time. American science fiction film enjoyed a decade of unprecedented commercial success, beginning with the colossal triumph of Star Wars in 1977. The science fiction boom of this decade spilled into horror, including horror/science fiction crossovers like the first two Alien films and the first Terminator film. But supernatural horror got a boost from this phenomenon as well, beginning especially with The Amityville Horror in 1979. Based on Jay Anson’s 1977 novel, which was itself supposedly based on real events, The Amityville Horror (1979) was successful enough to become the founding film in a whole franchise, even though it’s really a pretty banal supernatural thriller, in retrospect. Here, the Lutz family moves into an old house whose previous owners were all murdered, maybe because the house itself is somehow evil, though the film seems a bit confused about the source of this evil. Apparently, the house was built on the site of an old Indian burial ground, à la Poltergeist a few years later. Or maybe it’s on the site of an old devil worship shrine; and maybe it’s somehow related to the phenomenon of Salem witchcraft. In any case, the evil forces in the house seem really hostile to Catholicism, as a Catholic priest (played by Rod Steiger), quickly finds out when he tries to help. The ineffectuality of priests is by now a staple of supernatural horror movies. Eventually, the family survives to flee the house (even managing to save the family dog), just as the forces in the house seem to be getting increasingly incensed at their presence.\n\nThe Amityville Horror was followed by a prequel, Amityville II: The Possession (1982), which is really more of a possession/exorcism film than a haunted house film, as its title indicates. In many ways, it has less to do with The Amityville Horror than with The Exorcist, but it’s a pretty bad film in any case, filled with lurid and cheesy special effects and not much else. Amityville 3-D in 1983 added some technological gimmickry, as the franchise continued to expand without distinction. But, even before this first sequel, haunted house films received a tremendous boost in 1980, with the release of two of the greatest such films of all time—starring two of the greatest actors of their generation. Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining, featuring Jack Nicholson, is discussed in detail here.. Meanwhile, Peter Medak’s Canadian film The Changeling, starring George C. Scott, was also released in 1980. Scott plays John Russell, a noted musician/composer whose wife and daughter are killed in an auto accident at the beginning of the film. Attempting to restart his life, he moves cross-country to Seattle to teach music theory at a local university. While there, he rents a huge old mansion from the local Historical Society. The mansion, of course, is haunted—by the spirit of a sickly young boy who was murdered there by his own father seventy years earlier—as part of a plot to secure a vast inheritance by substituting a healthy son for the sickly one. The ghost apparently feels Russell’s experiences might make him sympathetic, so it manifests itself to get his attention. It works, too, and Russell becomes obsessed with investigating the background of the ghost, uncovering the whole plot and leading to the demise of the substitute son, now a powerful senator who attempts to suppress the investigation but is overcome by the power of the ghost. Scott puts in his usual reliable performance, and there is lots of interesting stuff here, including some creepy moments in the haunted house, though these are tempered by the fact that the ghost is mostly sympathetic, if dangerous, until it finally loses patience in the end. The best part, though, is the underlying implication that the real horror haunting America is unscrupulous rich people, who might have acquired their wealth by nefarious, inappropriate means.\n\nJohn Carpenter’s The Fog, also released in 1980, has no A-list stars (though Carpenter is an A-list horror director, and there are also some famous horror actors involved). It’s also a fine ghost story. It focuses on a California coastal town that was founded 100 years earlier using gold recovered from the wreck of a ship that the town’s six founders intentionally lured to its doom on the rocks off the coast just so they could recover the gold. Then, as it turns out, the gold was used to build the town church. The rest of the town had to build itself, while the local priest melted the remaining gold down and made it into a large gold cross. Now, 100 years later, the ghosts of the crew come ashore in the midst of a supernatural fog, seeking murderous revenge and also trying to get their gold back, which they finally do by obtaining the cross. The whole premise has the feel of a tall tale, as is indicated by the frame narrative in which an old sea captain (John Houseman) tells a ghost story (basically the story of the movie) to a group of boys around a campfire. It works, though, partly due to a number of small touches. Among other things, the film features both Jamie Lee Curtis and her mom Janet Leigh, though neither of them really has all that much to do. Town DJ Stevie Wayne (TV heartthrob Adrienne Barbeau, then Carpenter’s wife, in her first film role) is really more important. But, as it turns out, the most important character (though he doesn’t have as much screen time) is the current priest, the hard-drinking Father Malone (Hal Holbrook), who is the grandson of the priest involved in the original conspiracy. Finding his grandfather’s journal, he figures out what is going on and gives the cross to the ghosts, presumably appeasing them, though they also kill him (as well as five others, for a total of six, one for each of the original conspirators). Like many Carpenter films, this one is very watchable and is actually better than it sounds, even if it falls short of his best work. It was remade in 2005 (with Carpenter as a co-producer), with much less salubrious results.\n\n1982 saw the release of the Steven Spielberg-produced (and co-written) Poltergeist, with which supernatural horror truly reached the commercial mainstream. Nominally helmed by Texas Chain Saw director Tobe Hooper, Poltergeist is nothing like that film, partly because of Spielberg’s influence. Indeed, it has long been rumored that Spielberg largely directed the film. In any case, Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams play Steven and Diane Freeling, a suburban couple who live with their three kids in a planned development where the houses are nice enough, but bland. They’re also new, unlike the typical old haunted house. However, these new houses were also built on the site of an old graveyard, while the developer just left the buried corpses in place to save development costs and built right over them. And we all know what that leads to. Poltergeist contains some of the best-known scenes (and lines) in all of horror film. It also gains some scares from the threatened-child motif—especially the little girl who famously gets sucked into the TV. It also includes some potentially interesting commentary on the lack of respect for tradition on the part of capitalist modernity (and how that can come back to bite you in a kind of return of the repressed), though any simple allegorical reading of the film is complicated by the fact that the spirits from the graveyard (and their boss, the Beast) seem to use television (that ultimate tool of capitalist modernity) as their favorite portal into this world. One message is clear, though: television is evil—and apparently there was a reason why your parents didn’t want you to sit too close to the set.\n\nThe Entity (made in 1981 but not released until 1983, and supposedly based on a true story) is an unusual haunted house film in all sorts of ways. For one thing, the haunting takes place in a very modest lower-middle-class home, rather than in a vast old mansion. For another, though the “entity” of the title is never really identified, the film hints that it is a visitor from another dimension, rather than a ghost or other supernatural creature, meaning that The Entity might also be regarded as science fiction. It is also particularly sexually explicit, as the eponymous entity is mainly interested in attacking (and raping) protagonist Carla Moran (Barbara Hershey), though there is never any explanation for why such an entity would be interested in sex with human women. Then again, it seems mainly interested in dominating, humiliating, and terrifying Moran rather than in actual sex—which of course makes the whole motif a rather explicit allegorization of rape in general. Meanwhile, the choice of Moran (a single mother who is identified early on as a strong, independent woman who does things her own way without relying on the help of men) is interesting as well, making the entity a sort of Reagan-era fantasy of revenge against the threat posed by such women—and making the film a critique of such fantasies (which, of course, are alive and well today). The entity proves too much for various earthly experts to manage (even with high-tech science fictional equipment), but Moran keeps it under control to some extent by simply standing up to it and refusing to be humiliated, whatever it does to her. That’s meant to be a positive, pro-feminist ending, I think, though it does suggest that rape is easier to deal with than it really is.\n\nThe Keep (1983) is notable primarily as an early effort of director Michael Mann and for an amazing cast that includes such luminaries as Ian McKellen, Jürgen Prochnow, Gabriel Byrne, and Scott Glenn. It also features impressive visuals and an effective electronic soundtrack from Tangerine Dream. The story, though, is something of a mess. Nazis roll into a Romanian village in 1941 and occupy the nearby ancient castle, thereby awakening an evil supernatural entity that has been imprisoned there for hundreds of years. The entity then contrives to try to escape the confines of the castle so it can take over the world, but Glenn’s character, a supernatural hero figure, arrives in the nick of time and locks it safely back down. Mostly, though, the narrative is pretty incoherent, as the film careens from one scene to another with little in the way of connecting logic. Luckily, the scenes themselves are interesting enough to make The Keep highly watchable.\n\nSupernatural horror experienced a bit of slowdown in the late 1980s and most of the 1990s, but the ghost story The Sixth Sense was all the rage when it was released in 1999, seeming to announce M. Night Shyamalan as the next great horror director. It’s a gimmick film, though, and as such it has not retained its status, given that it has diminished appeal for audiences who already know the trick. But it is also shot through with a streak of sentimentality that, in retrospect, probably did not bode well for Shyamalan’s future as a horror director. Still, it’s a cleverly constructed film in which most viewers, unless alerted beforehand, would not realize that Bruce Willis’s Malcolm Crowe goes through most of the film dead but unaware of it. In some ways, what is most impressive about the film is how obvious it is that Crowe is dead on repeat viewings without spoiling that first viewing. But what is really impressive is the Oscar-nominated performance of young Haley Joel Osment as the nine-year-old boy who “sees dead people” and whom Crowe, a child psychologist when alive, helps to cope with his condition as a “freak.”\n\nStir of Echoes (1999) is a relatively big-budget (but also rather pedestrian) horror thriller loosely based on a 1958 novel by Richard Matheson. It got far less attention than did The Sixth Sense, however, partly because it was so overshadowed by that film in terms of popular buzz.In Stir of Echoes, Kevin Bacon plays Tom Witzky, a telephone lineman in Chicago, who suddenly has his latent psychic powers activated by a posthypnotic suggestion. Then he starts having visions and dreams that eventually drive him to start digging up his yard and destroying his house, until he finally finds the body of a teenage girl, murdered a year earlier in the townhouse he now occupies, who has been contacting him from beyond the grave. Then Witzky almost gets killed by one of the killers (and the killer’s dad), but the dad of the other killer kills them instead. As the films ends, Witzky’s family drives away to a new home, his young son (who has inherited his psychic powers) being tormented by the thoughts (presumably of both the dead and the living) that he hears all around him.\n\nWhat Lies Beneath (2000) is another mainstream Hollywood ghost story, this time featuring A-list actors Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford in the lead roles, which accounts for the fact that it was a commercial success despite being something of a mess. Here, Ford plays brilliant genetics professor Norman Spencer, while Pfeiffer plays Claire Spencer, a once-brilliant musician who gave up her career to try to be the perfect wife to Norman. Norman, though, being a professor, is deeply flawed. As the plot unfolds, we learn that he had once an affair with a student, whom he subsequently murdered—and whose ghost may or may not be haunting the Spencers. When Claire learns of that murder, Norman tries to murder her as well, but she is (possibly) saved by the ghost of the student. What Lies Beneath is clearly not all that interested in its own ghost-story plot, though, and seems to want to be more of a Hitchcockian psychological thriller—as evidenced by the liberal echoes of Rear Window that are built into the first half of the film. Director Robert Zemeckis, though, is no Hitchcock, and What Lies Beneath never really rises to its potential.\n\nSmaller-scale supernatural ghost stories also made a mark at the beginning of the new century, with efforts such as Brad Anderson’s Session 9 (2001), an extremely effective atmospheric psychological thriller that combines the slasher film with a chilling ghost story. It’s also a real movie, not just a bloodbath, with real characters and a real story that addresses some real issues. The atmosphere is provided largely by the setting in a huge abandoned mental asylum, founded in the 1870s but closed in the 1980s in the midst of the Reagan-era budget cuts, as well as a major lawsuit from the family of a patient whose “repressed memories” of satanic rituals, recovered during treatment at the asylum and very damning to the family, turned out (apparently) to be false. The film was shot in the actual Danvers State Hospital of Danvers, Massachusetts, a facility that has a rich and strange history of its own. The basic story of the film involves a cleanup crew that is hired to rid the huge facility of its asbestos so that it can be reopened as the new headquarters of the local government. It’s one of the few American movies that actually deals centrally with work, as we see the crew in the midst of the job through much of the film. And we get to know the workers and their problems, especially the boss, Gordon Fleming (Peter Mullan), who has (as we eventually learn), been under considerable personal pressure at home and financial pressure with the cleanup company, which is on the verge of going under when they get the job to clean up the asylum. Though he is the boss and owner of the company, Fleming is very much a working-class character, who works right alongside his men and lives in very modest circumstances. David Caruso plays Phil, Gordon’s right-hand man, while Stephen Gevedon plays Mike, a law-school dropout who serves somewhat as the group’s intellectual. Meanwhile, there is tension within the group because another worker, Hank (Josh Lucas), has recently stolen Phil’s girlfriend. In order to get this job, Gordon has promised to get the cleanup done in an unreasonably short time, so the entire crew works under pressure—with the promise of a bonus if they succeed.\n\nUnfortunately, things gradually unravel, partly due to the tension between Phil and Hank, and partly because Mike discovers some old files and tapes of patient interviews and begins spending most of his time studying those. In particular, he becomes fascinated with the case of Mary Hobbes, Patient 444, from 1974. Mary seems to have suffered from multiple personality disorder, which had been central to her commitment to the facility after murdering her entire family when she was still quite young, though the exact details of her case remain vague. In particular, one of her apparent personalities, known as “Simon,” seems to have been the principal force behind her turn to murder, but the film also leaves open the possibility that Simon may be some sort of malignant spirit who possessed Mary and who now continues to haunt the asylum. As Simon tells the doctor on the tape listened to by Mike, “I live in the weak and the wounded.”\n\nSimon, in fact, may be central to the breakdown that leads Gordon to murder the rest of the crew (and apparently his wife and infant daughter as well). Or it might simply be that Gordon was already unstable and that the creepy atmosphere of the asylum has driven him over the edge. There are lots of serious issues here concerning things such as the collapse of the American mental health system in the 1980s and the economic pressures that constantly weigh down on working-class individuals and families. This thing completely tanked at the box-office, possibly partly because it was released just before the 9/11 bombings, which left people in no mood for such a film, though it wasn’t doing well even before that. It’s really very good, though, and has gained something of a following over the past decade. Highly recommended.\n\n2001 also saw the release of Spanish director Alejandro Amenábar’s English-language film The Others (2001), an extremely well made, brooding, atmospheric ghost story involving small children and a central plot “trick.” Something like The Innocents meets The Sixth Sense, The Others stars Nicole Kidman as the mother who lives with her two small children in a spooky mansion on the isle of Jersey, when they are all seemingly threatened by a family of ghosts. Then they hire some new servants, but they all turn out to be ghosts as well. Then to top matters off, the mother and children turn out actually to be ghosts, and the other family turns out to be the ones being haunted. The plot is lame and Kidman’s performance is overwrought, yet the film nevertheless manages to be very effective and occasionally even scary (there’s a moment when the mother confuses her daughter and one of the “others” that is guaranteed to produce a few chills), largely because Amenábar does an excellent job of creating a slowly building mood of dread. There’s also some Nazi material (Jersey was occupied by the Nazis during WWII, and the children’s father was killed in the war), but that never really comes to much. More style than substance, but still one of the better haunted-house films out there.\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s The Devil’s Backbone (also released in 2001) is another Spanish ghost story that features a visually striking ghost but that otherwise lacks most of the visual flair we have come to associate with del Toro’s. It makes up for that lack in other ways, though. In particular, this is a film that does an especially good job of using the ghost story as a mode of commentary on the historical past—something the subgenre should be perfectly suited for, even if few films do it well. Here, the literal ghost is that of a small boy killed in the fascist bombing of a Spanish orphanage during the Spanish Civil War, but the real ghost is the Civil War itself, and the film provides abundant haunting reminders of that dark moment in Spanish (and world) history, when the Western powers stood idly by while Spain was overrun by fascist forces, opening the way for the broader fascist expansionism that led to World War II.\n\nIn a more conventional horror film mode, The Ring (2002) is big-time, (relatively) big-budget Hollywood horror, featuring some heavyweight talents. For one thing, it was the last film directed by Gore Verbinski before he moved into the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. For another, it was the first film featuring Naomi Watts after her spectacular performance in Mulholland Drive had propelled her to stardom. The film itself is well made and highly watchable, especially when Watts is on the screen, which luckily is most of the time. On the other hand, The Ring is nothing special as a film, partly because its whole premise is a bit muddled, confusing, and not very believable. Basically, a little girl on an island is so evil that her own mother kills her by dumping her down a well, after which the dead girl takes revenge by somehow making a weird video tape that causes anyone who watches it to die seven days later. Maybe this is why no one watches video tape anymore. Anyway, Watts’s character is a newspaper reporter who views the tape early on, then spends the rest of the film using her investigative skills to uncover the secret behind the tape. She manages to save herself and her son (by making copies of the tape and passing the curse on to others, which is about as believable as anything else in the film), but this is a film that depends more on atmosphere and visuals (and Watts’s performance) than on plot.\n\nThe Ring is a remake of the 1998 Japanese horror film Ringu, and it was successful enough at the box office (it made $250 million worldwide, off a budget of $48 million) that American remakes of Japanese horror films became a thing for a while, including The Grudge (2004, with Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Dark Water (2005, with Jennifer Connolly). Of these, the former was more successful, helping to inspire a whole Grudge franchise. This franchise, of course, looks back to Ju-On: The Grudge (2002), which is probably both scarier and just plain better than the American remake, though not greatly so, perhaps because the remake, produced by Sam Raimi, has the unusual distinction of being directed by Takashi Shimuzu, director of the Japanese original. The Japanese ghost mythology seems a bit more coherent in the original, though the ghosts themselves look and sound pretty much the same in both versions, which means they both look and sound pretty scary. The American version is even set in Japan. The biggest difference between the two versions is probably that the American film tries to foreground the character played by Gellar (American exchange student Karen Davis), while the Japanese film foregrounds the ghosts themselves, featuring a whole series of characters who are of roughly equal importance, which, again, is more consistent with the mythology, which has to do with those suffering horrific deaths becoming vengeful ghosts who visit such deaths on others, who then become vengeful ghosts who visit such deaths on others, and so on, in an ongoing series.\n\nDespite trying to highlight Gellar’s character (and to cash in on her considerable post-Buffy horror cred) The Grudge (2004) doesn’t really give Davis all that much to do. Mainly, she just looks on as weird happenings (including periodic appearances by a strange dead little boy, his evil dead father, and his really creepy dead mother) kill off inhabitants of and even visitors to a Japanese house that is haunted by the legacy of an enraged husband murdering his wife and child, then killing himself, a few years earlier. This one definitely has some scary visuals, including the weird jerky movement of the ghosts, since widely imitated, though it is built on particularly Japanese ghost mythologies, meaning that it probably made more sense in the Japanese original. As it is, it’s a bit nonsensical, and can be plodding, but it’s not awful. It also has a cliffhanger ending in which the murdered woman’s ghost may be about to possess and/or kill Davis, but of course we have to wait for the sequel to find out.\n\nThat sequel, The Grudge 2 (2006), was also directed by Shimizu, but was less successful than its progenitor, both commercially and critically. Alas, Davis does get killed by the ghost early in the film, leaving her younger sister Aubrey (Amber Tamblyn) to carry the rest of the film. Aubrey, though, doesn’t survive the film, either. Japanese ghosts are pretty deadly. The Grudge 3 (2009), directed by Toby Wilkins, continued the downward slide of the franchise and was released directly to video. A series of Japanese sequels to Ju-On has also been released, including Ju-On: The Beginning of the End (2014), intended as a reboot of the franchise, which also includes a number of novels and manga. A reboot of the American franchise, still produced by Raimi but now set in America, is scheduled for 2020.\n\nBack in America, 1408 (2007), directed by Mikael Håfström, is a haunted hotel movie based on a story by Stephen King, which I suppose makes it a sort of followup to The Shining. Here, John Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a writer who investigates and writes about paranormal phenomena—in which he doesn’t really believe. However, when he checks into a supposedly “evil” room (the room 1408 of the title) in a New York hotel, all hell literally breaks loose. And that’s part of the problem. For about half an hour, during the setup, this film is quite good. And, once Enslin gets in the room and it starts to wreak havoc on him, there’s certainly a lot of action. A little too much, in fact, not much of which is really all that believable, though the film does rightly point to the basic spookiness of hotel rooms, on which it builds. There’s no time for anticipation as Enslin deals with nonstop threats, though Cusack is pretty good at making Enslin a sympathetic central character with whom we can identify. Still, in the terminology often used for the genre, this film quickly becomes all “horror” proper (reaction to shocking events) and no “terror” (fear in anticipation of potential shocking events). Meanwhile, its Inception-like attempts to entangle different levels of reality doesn’t help much. Samuel L. Jackson is effectively mysterious as hotel manager Gerald Olin, though his exact relation to the evil room is unclear. He seems here almost like a Satan figure, the overseer of the room, though in the original version of the film he seemed more like an enemy of the room. (In the original cut, Enslin was killed in the room, though he takes it down with him, leaving Olin to carry the denouement; bad audience reaction caused a change to a “happy” ending in which Enslin defeats the room and escapes, leaving Olin nothing to do.)\n\nLake Mungo (2008) is an unusual Australian ghost story that has gained something of a cult following in recent years. Presented as a documentary concerning the drowning of teenager Alice Palmer (Talia Zucker) and its aftermath, the film concerns the grasping attempts of her family to find evidence of the ongoing existence of Alice’s ghost in their house. Ultimately, though, the only ghost detected (prior to the ending credits) is one that turns out to have been detected by Alice herself shortly before her death—as a sort of premonition of that death. The film really deals more with the grief of the living than with manifestations of the dead, and it does so effectively enough to have drawn a number of rave reviews.\n\nCo-produced and co-written by Guillermo del Toro, Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark (2010) is a variant on the haunted house story in which a crumbled mansion is haunted not by ghosts, but by faeries. But these are ugly, vicious, scurrying, rat-like faeries that you definitely don’t want to meet in the dark. Based on a 1973 television movie of the same title (in which the house is infested with goblins), Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark has some of the visual flair for which del Toro is so well known, though its look no doubt also owes a great deal to its director, comic book artist Troy Nixie. Much of the film is focused on the attempts of the faeries to lure ten-year-old Sally Hurst (Bailee Madison) into their lair beneath the mansion being renovated by her father, Alex Hurst (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend, designer Kim Raphael (Katie Holmes). Much of its scariness thus results from the motif of the threatened-child-whom-no-one-will-believe that has worked so often in horror films. This film definitely has its moments, even though it ultimately fails to produce anything special with its unusual mythological materials, which were derived from the horror stories of Arthur Machen (who is, in fact, hat-tipped within the film itself).\n\nThe Awakening (2011) is a reasonably effective old-style British haunted-house movie. In fact, it’s set back in 1921, just after years of wars and disease had caused so many deaths that there was a dramatic increase in the ghost population, or so the film would suggest. Oddly enough, though, the ghost of the film was killed many years earlier, but the suggestion of a recent increase in the ghost population is not entirely gratuitous because the film’s protagonist, ahead-of-her-time liberated woman Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall), is a scientist who has made a name for herself by debunking various recent reports of hauntings. (In the process of her work, she has to overcome not only charlatans who fake hauntings to make money, but also things like overbearing males who suspect that she may be insane because her woman’s brain can’t handle all the education she has stuffed into it.) In the film she is called to a boarding school where there have been several ghost sightings. The ghost there turns out to be real, of course, and we gradually learn that the boarding school had once been Cathcart’s childhood home—until her father was driven nuts by his nagging wife, subsequently killing her and himself with a shotgun. In the process, he also attempted to kill young Florence but missed and instead killed her half-brother, an illegitimate child whose existence was the source of the mother’s nagging. Anyway, Cathcart has suppressed memories of all this, but they come back in the process of hunting this ghost, which turns out, of course, to be the half-brother. It’s all a bit slow and predictable, but Hall’s performance is terrific, which makes it more than watchable. And it definitely has a couple of scary moments.\n\nJames Watkins’ The Woman in Black (2012) is an interesting ghost story that features the attempts of struggling solicitor Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) to make sense of the papers left by the recently-deceased owner of the most haunted-looking house you ever saw. Set around 1910 (and based on a 1983 novel by Susan Hill), The Woman in Black is a stylish evocation of Edwardian England. It can also be quite spooky at times, though it contributes relatively little that is new to the ghost-story genre—the house itself, the superstitious (and hostile) locals, and the fleeting glimpses of ghosts have all been done many times. The film does have an interesting “happy” ending, though.\n\nAndy Muschietti’s Mama (2013) got a lot of buzz when it was originally released, partly because it was executive-produced by del Toro. And it certainly is stylish, though it could be conceived as misogynistic with all the devouring mother imagery. Nevertheless, it manages to be one of the creepiest and scariest films of recent years, punctuated by some genuine spine-tingling moments. It’s largely a collection of clichés, both thematically and visually, but they’re pretty effective clichés, and it’s definitely interesting to look at—though it really looks less like something from del Toro than like a Japanese horror film made by someone heavily influenced by Tim Burton. Lots of waving tentacles of hair and dark shapes moving suddenly and jerkily, that sort of thing. And moths. Possibly the most original visual effect has to do with putting actress Jessica Chastain in a short black wig, heavy eye-liner, and tattoo sleeve, which transforms her into a hard-edged rocker chick. But then her interaction with the film’s two little girls (lost in the woods at ages 1 and 3, then raised there for five years by the ghost of a crazy woman who lost her baby more than a century earlier) brings out her nurturing side, allowing her to at least save one of the little girls from the ghostly title character. It sounds lame, but it’s definitely better than your average horror film, even if it fails to address larger social issues in the way the best horror films do, other than (very) vaguely suggesting that there might be some problems with our social services system for the care of orphaned or abused children. You’d have to work some, but I suppose you could also find some general commentary here on the way childhood can be genuinely frightening, with children so often at the mercy of forces larger than themselves, with far less in the way of legal rights and protections than are typically afforded to adults. Mostly, though, it’s just a scary entertainment.\n\nDel Toro himself returned to the ghost story form with Crimson Peak (2015), which features some of the most visually gruesome ghosts ever put on film. The ghosts, though, are relatively benevolent and mainly just issue warnings. The real villains are a live (and very incestuous) brother-and-sister team (played by Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain), who prey on a series of innocent young women, including (in the case of the main plot of the film), a wealthy American woman, Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska). Chastain, one of the most important actresses in twenty-first-century horror, does the Goth thing very well, in a sort of evil version of her character in Mama. Anyway, the brother marries Edith and lures her back to the preposterously Gothic home he shares with his sister in England. The plan is to get her money to help finance the brother’s contraption for mining clay, but that sounds much more down-to-earth than the film really is. But this is Gothic romance, rather than true horror, so the brother falls in love with Edith and helps her escape alive (though he doesn’t). As one would expect from del Toro, there are lots of fascinating visuals in this one, but much of the film doesn’t really make sense.\n\nIvan Kavanaugh’s The Canal (2014) is an Irish horror film that more than makes up for a somewhat nonsensical plot with loads of creepy atmosphere. Here, young David and Alice) (Rupert Evans and Hannah Hoekstra) move into a creaky old house that turns out to have been the scene of some gruesome events over the years. Things go fine for a while, though, until David discovers that Alice is having an affair and then she turns up dead soon afterward. David is suspected, then cleared, then suspected again, and he begins to unravel psychologically as the film proceeds. Indeed, this film is another example of the Todorov’s “fantastic,” because it is never entirely clear whether the strange events of the film are a result of David’s worsening psychological state or whether they are genuinely supernatural. Then the film appears to veer into the marvelous, but only in it very last moments.\n\nThe spate of highly intelligent supernatural horror films in the 2010s also inspired a number of imitations that were not so intelligent. Blumhouse’s Ouija (2014), for example, draws upon the popular Ouija board (which shows up in many horror films, perhaps most famously in The Exorcist)[9]. It seems to have very few original ideas, though it made a lot of money. Which is why it is not surprising that a 2015 prequel film, Ouija: Origin of Evil, was made. What is surprising is that the prequel is actually much more original, perhaps because the prequel was directed by Mike Flanagan, one of the hottest young directors in contemporary horror film. Once again, a Ouija board is crucial to communication with ghosts (this time of concentration camp prisoners tortured to death by a Nazi mad scientist). This time, though, there are very clear and specific echoes of The Exorcist, (a priest tries—and fails—to save the day, a possessed little girl does a gravity-defying spider walk) which helps to solidify the Ouija-board connection to that film.But perhaps the most interesting part of this film is its visual style. Set in 1967, it employs a style and color palette that strongly evoke that period, making the film much more interesting to watch than it might otherwise have been.\n\nAnother recent Ouija board film that has gotten considerable attention is Verónica (2017), from Spanish director Paco Plaza (best known for the REC zombie films(along with Jaume Balagueró). Significantly better than the Blumhouse Ouija films, Verónica profits from a terrific performance by Sandra Escacena as a fifteen-year-old Madrid girl who participates in a séance with a Ouija board during a full solar eclipse. Bad idea. Verónica is trying to contact her recently deceased father, but instead inadvertently unleashes a demon. This one suffers from a lack of originality in places, but it can definitely be scary at times and is made more so by the fact that Verónica and her three younger siblings are constantly being threatened by the demons. It also gains some traction from supposedly being based on real events, though it is only loosely so (as is perhaps signaled by the fact that some of the key events occur on Friday the 13th in June 1991, even though June 13, 1991, was a Thursday).\n\nOne particularly stylish recent ghost story is Lights Out (2016), which features a deadly ghost with no tolerance for light (she’d been allergic to light even when alive), so that she can only attack her victims in the dark. There’s a convoluted back story involving suicide and depression—and a shocking ending in which a woman commits suicide to disable the ghost (because she had been the tether connecting the ghost to our world). This one requires a bit more suspension of disbelief than even the usual ghost story, but it is unusually well made and highly watchable if you don’t try to make too much sense of it all. It grossed nearly $150 million off of a budget of less than $5 million, making it another of many recent horror movies to have huge profit ratios—thus providing a practical explanation for the current boom in horror film production, but also suggesting that there must be something about the current zeitgeist that makes horror particularly attractive to mass audiences.\n\nWitches and Witchcraft\n\nWitches, in horror films, take a variety of forms. For one thing, while witches are almost always female, there are some cases in which they are male, though male witches are generally referred to as warlocks. In some films—such as the much-maligned The Covenant (2006)—there is little or no distinction between warlocks and male witches. Warlock films have certainly been less successful than films about witches, though the 1989 entry Warlock was successful enough to inspire sequels in 1993 and 1999.\n\nPerhaps the classic warlock film, however, is The Haunted Palace (1963), one of the numerous collaborations between director Roger Corman and star Vincent Price, though this one is notable for also featuring Lon Chaney, Jr., in a supporting role. This one may, however, be most interesting for the way it was marketed (by AIP, over Corman’s objections) as Edgar Allan Poe’s The Haunted Palace in an attempt to cash in on the success of the other Corman-Price Poe adaptations, even though this one was actually based on a story by H. P. Lovecraft (then presumably a less marketable name, though that has probably changed by now). The film did take its title from a Poe poem, however. In any case, this one is fairly banal stuff, as Price returns to the small New England town of Arkham as the great-great-grandson of a warlock burned there at the stake a hundred years earlier. Price’s character, Charles Dexter Ward, is soon possessed by the spirit of his ancestor, Joseph Curwen, and immediately sets out trying to get revenge on the town. Chaney, meanwhile, plays his loyal retainer, who somehow has been alive all this time, caretaking the titular family palace (which nevertheless looks pretty spooky and rundown) in preparation for his return. In the end, the palace is burned and the villagers triumph (with the aid of Ward’s wife Anne, played by Debra Paget). Or do they? The aging Chaney is still very good as the creepy-but-sad servant, but Price’s performance is the centerpiece here. This may not be one of his better films, but it nicely illustrates his ability to be effectively scary even as he self-consciously parodied himself and his spooky on-screen image. It’s not always entirely clear that Price is in on the joke when his films turn into self-parody, but here he very obviously is.\n\nThere also a variety of films concerning practitioners of magic who are not identified as witches, but who have powers similar to those often displayed by witches in films. These include a variety of films featuring wizards, including such high-profile franchises as Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings.Magical powers (especially the ability to apply curses) are also sometimes attributed to those from other cultures, including a variety of movies involving Caribbean voo-doo[10] or gypsy curses[11].\n\nAt least as far back as The Wizard of Oz (1939), witches in films can be either good or bad. In this film (and in a number of others) good witches are coded as beautiful (often blonde) and bad witches as ugly (often dark). Witches of either the good or the evil persuasion can be seductive, though the bad ones generally lure men to their doom. In I Married a Witch (1942), a beautiful (good) witch turns out to make a fine wife, though not without a few romantic comedy twists and turns[12]. Often, however, marriages between mortal men and witches are a bit more problematic.\n\nBurn, Witch, Burn (1962) is the U.S. title of the British film Night of the Eagle, though it’s a film with lofty American writing credentials, being based on a novel by Fritz Leiber with a screenplay by Twilight Zone writers Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont. It features Peter Wyngarde as sociology professor Norman Taylor, a man so British his entire body is stiff, not just his upper lip. Anyway, much of his teaching seems to involve the debunking of superstitions about things like witchcraft, so he is rather taken aback when he finds that much of his considerable professional success seems to have been enabled by the mumbo jumbo conjured up by his witchcraft-practicing wife. So he gathers all her witchy accoutrements and destroys them, which (of course) causes all hell to break loose. His devoted wife (played by Janet Blair) tries to save him by sacrificing herself, to which he responds by trying to save her, but it’s all complicated by the spells being cast by the wife of an academic rival to try to get Taylor out of the way. And then there’s a stone eagle that comes alive and an awful lot of hurrying about, but the Taylors apparently emerge victorious at the end. It’s actually fun in places and certainly can be read as an allegorical lampoon of academic rivalry and in-fighting, though it oddly seems to place most of that sort of dirty business in the hands of academic wives, rather than the academics themselves, who are mostly just pawns in the hands of their witchy wives. Best part is the opening voiceover in which Paul Frees (seemingly trying for all the world to sound like Orson Welles) intones a spell to protect the audience from the evil that is to follow. There are two American films based on the same Leiber novel (Conjure Wife): Weird Woman (1944) and the more comical Witches’ Brew (1980).\n\nOther British witchcraft film have more specific roots in either British history or British folk horror. Witchfinder General (1968), for example, is a history-based account of witch-hunting during the English Civil War in the mid-seventeenth century. This film is genuinely horrifying and clearly sympathizes with those being hunted (as well as providing a nice reminder that some of the most horrific things in Western history have generally been done in the name of Christianity). In the U.S., incidentally, this film was released as “The Conqueror Worm,” taking its title from a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, in an attempt to link it to AIP’s earlier Vincent Price Poe cycle, though this one is not really related to any of Poe’s writings. It’s also an interesting performance by Price as Matthew Hopkins as the witchhunter of the title, ruthlessly trying to root out and execute witches, while trying to score with a few comely maidens along the way. Price is superb as the pompous-but-smarmy Hopkins, though he doesn’t really dominate the film as he sometimes does, spending long segments off the screen while Keith Carradine lookalike Ian Ogilvy gets most of the screen time as Richard Marshall, Hopkins’s eventual nemesis. Hilary Dwyer is quite good as Sara Lowes, Marshall’s love interest and one of the victims of Hopkins in his roles as both sexual predator and sadistic torturer. Indeed, the final scene in which Sara is tortured by having an icepick repeatedly plunged into her back is pretty powerful even now (in the heyday of torture porn horror films) and was considered absolutely shocking in 1968. Price makes Hopkins completely despicable (just as he should), in an excellent, if unusual performance. He also shows himself as particularly adept at the time-honored Hollywood practice of creating the illusion of a British accent by simply speaking priggishly and pretentiously. In any case, while the historical details aren’t always accurate, this reminder that the most horrifying things imaginable have already actually been done in reality is definitely worth a look. The production values are quite high by AIP standards, and it’s quite a good historical drama, horror film or not. It was quite successful and triggered a new cycle of AIP horror films featuring Price, made in Britain and without Roger Corman, who was by then off doing his own thing.\n\nGeorge Romero’s Season of the Witch (1972) gives witchcraft the low-key, realistic treatment that Romero would later give to vampirism in Martin (1978). Romero made this film quickly and on a low budget, but then experienced difficulties with the distributor, who recut it and marketed it as soft-core porn under the title Hungry Wives. Luckily, Romero was finally able to get the film released with his original vision and with its current title, taken from Donovan’s 1966 hit song, which is also included within the film. In the film, Joan Mitchell (Jan White) is a bored, unfulfilled, unappreciated suburban wife whose husband Jack (Bill Thunhurst) is a blustering, posturing boor whose favorite move is to threaten to “kick some ass.” Joan turns to the study of witchcraft to try to find some meaning in her life; she is eventually initiated into a coven, though it is not at all clear that the witches have any actual supernatural power. Joan also doesn’t get much of a boost from a brief fling with a local college teacher who has also been having a fling with Jack and Joan’s nineteen-year-old daughter. (Her seduction of the teacher might possibly have been furthered by magic, but that isn’t clear either.) In any case, Joan’s eventual empowerment comes only when she shoots and kills Jack, thinking he is an intruder after he unexpectedly returns early from a business trip. Not the best-looking or best-acted film ever, Season nevertheless delivers a pretty strong feminist message. And includes a clever allusion to Rosemary’s Baby.\n\nPerhaps the greatest of all witchcraft films (at least in an aesthetic sense) was produced in neither the U.S. nor the U.K., but in Italy, where Maria Brava’s Suspiria (1977) is perhaps the greatest single horror film ever produced in that country (which has quite a rich horror film tradition). Here, a young American woman, Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper), travels to Germany to study at a dance academy that turns out to be the home of a mysterious coven of witches. Much more interested in creating atmosphere through spectacular and richly-colored visuals (enhanced by a notable progressive rock soundtrack supplied by the band Goblin) than in the actual narrative, Suspiria has achieved near legendary status over the years. Suspiria was remade by Luca Guadagnino in 2018; the excellent remake adds some elements (such as German guilt over the Nazi past) and uses dance more effectively as an element of the film than did the original. That it received such mixed responses from critics is partly a testament to its own strangeness and partly a testament to the towering achievement of the original, which it doesn’t quite match in overall impact.\n\nSuperstition (made in 1982, but not released until 1985) is an American film that shows a strong influence of Italian horror films, especially in the bloody special effects. Here, a witch, executed (by Catholics, for some reason) for practicing witchcraft in Salem in 1692, returns in the modern world to wreak revenge on the descendants of her original tormentors, almost in slasher-film fashion. In any case, the witch is unequivocally identified as an evil minion of Satan and the revenge is particularly bloody, involving things like chopping off a guy’s head, then microwaving it until it explodes. Or closing a window sash on a guy trying to climb out the window, cutting him in two and leaving the two halves wriggling about after death. The revenge particularly focuses on a family that moves into a house haunted by the witch, making this a sort of haunted house story as well. Indeed, this one seems very confused about just what kind of film it actually is. This is not one of those movies that treats witchcraft as a mode of feminine empowerment; it’s mostly here just a mode for producing gory visuals.\n\nWitches plot to conquer the world in Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), which really has nothing to do with the first two Halloween films, though it has everything to do with Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It’s even set in the small (fictional) California town of Santa Mira, as was Body Snatchers. Now, though, rather than alien seed pod replicants, the plot involves Gaelic witches and their army of robot drones, who plan to zap lots of kids with special Halloween masks (each laced with a chunk of magic rock from Stonehenge), simultaneously releasing hordes of poisonous insects, spiders, and snakes, spreading death throughout the world in a massive blood sacrifice that will help initiate a new era of human history dominated by witchcraft. Meanwhile, Doctor Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) seeks to derail the plot, aided by the beautiful Ellie Grimbridge (Stacey Nelkin). Of course, he (like Dr. Miles Bennell in Invasion of the Body Snatchers)has trouble getting anyone to listen, and even Ellie gets replaced by a robot replicant and has to be violently dismantled. The film ends as Challis cries out, hoping to get someone to listen before it’s too late and the evil TV jingle of Silver Shamrock Novelty Company can ignite the masks. This is all pretty ridiculous, of course, but also pretty fun, especially if you recognize the parallels with Invasion of the Body Snatchers. In the meantime, the machinations of Silver Shamrock can also be taken as a commentary on the efforts of consumer capitalism, aided by television advertising, to take over our minds and turn us into robots. The whole plot doesn’t make much sense, and the film as a whole has little to do with the original Halloween, though Challis does catch a glimpse of that film as it plays on TV on Halloween. The film also doesn’t really do that much with witchcraft, though its mixture of modern robotics and ancient magic is rather interesting, and it does at least indicate the variety of films that have appeared with witchcraft as an important component. It reads more like a sort of undeveloped version of John Carpenter’s later great science fiction satire They Live (1988). Carpenter, incidentally, co-produced Halloween III, though the film was written and directed by Tommy Lee Wallace.\n\nOne of the highest-profile witchcraft films ever to appear was George Miller’s The Witches of Eastwick (1987), a big-budget production based on a novel by John Updike. The Witches of Eastwick is also largely comical, but it actually does make such a contribution to the legacy of witchcraft in film. In particular, this film suggests that the power of witchcraft can be liberating to women who have been forced to repress their desires under modern patriarchal society, allowing them to express both their sexuality and their creativity in ways that had been hitherto impossible. Of course, the film is particularly effective in this sense because of its extremely strong cast, including Cher, Susan Sarandon, and Michelle Pfeiffer, who play the three eponymous witches, Alexandra, Jane, and Sukie. Trapped in boring and unfulfilling lives in the Rhode Island town of Eastwick, the three women suddenly have their lives invigorated by the appearance of one Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson), a Satanic figure who introduces them all to a new world of sensual pleasures, causing so much jealousy and animosity among the locals that the women decide to break off their relationship with Daryl. He tries to force them to stay, but by this time they have gained enough magical power under his tutelage that they defeat him in a final standoff. On the other hand, he has also by this time impregnated them all, and the film’s code reveals that all three infant boys are beginning to show the influence of their Satanic father, despite the fact that he has seemingly been banished.\n\nThe Witches of Eastwick is no Rosemary’s Baby, though, and Nicholson’s bravura turn as Daryl makes him seem more mischievous than evil. Indeed, Nicholson pretty much steals the film (despite its Girl Power theme) in an outrageous performance that seems almost a rehearsal for his turn as the Joker a few years later, with echoes of his performance as Jack Torrance a few years earlier. The film is, in fact, primarily a comedy. Itwas also successful enough to contribute to the appearance of a wave of witchcraft movies over the next decade or so. Some of the films that appeared during this period were not really horror films at all, such as Disney’s Hocus-Pocus (1993), a film that features lots of horror iconography, from Salem witchhunts, to zombies, to Halloween celebrations. It also features lots of witches, but only comical ones. The whole thing is entertaining enough, in its own way, but it makes little or no real contribution to the tradition of horror films about witches.\n\nThe comic aspects of The Witches of Eastwick, incidentally, are not unusual in films about witches, who are often cast in a rather lighthearted mode. One thinks, for example, of the Disneyfied witchcraft of Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971), which is used (of all things) to defeat a platoon of invading Nazis in England. Even evil witches can be comical in popular culture, of course, as in Nicolas Roeg’s The Witches (1990). Based on a novel by Roald Dahl, this film contains the typical Dahl motif of a story nominally designed for children that nevertheless contains a number of extremely dark elements—including a bevy of fiercely evil witches who are dedicated to doing in children—such as by lacing candies with a potion that will turn any children who eat them into mice.\n\nAndrew Fleming’s The Craft (1996) has become something of a teen cult classic, though it was actually fairly successful in its initial theatrical run as well. It draws upon the ensemble-cast motif used so successfully in The Witches of Eastwick, but applies it to teen girls—though the girls here lack the feminine solidarity of the Eastwick ensemble. The Craft features a group of three outsider teenage girls who dabble in witchcraft, then get really into witchcraft when they are joined by a fourth girl, who is a “natural witch” and whose powers greatly enhance their own. There’s a certain celebration of outsiders and of female empowerment as the girls’ abilities grow, but The Craft seems to have a bit of trouble deciding exactly what message it is trying to deliver. For one thing, the girls use their powers mostly for pranks and petty revenge against those who have slighted them. For another, the girls spend much of their time fighting among themselves. There are some funny moments, but things get more serious when people begin to die. Meanwhile, the new girl, Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney), remains an outsider among outsiders and never quite fits in with the group, leading eventually to a magical showdown in which the leader of the group, Nancy Downs (Fairuza Balk) is defeated by Sarah, stripped of her powers, and apparently driven insane, confined to restraints in a mental asylum. The other two girls, Bonnie Harper and Rochelle Zimmerman (Neve Campbell and Rachel True), also lose their powers (for misusing them) and are spurned by Sarah. Campbell plays a secondary character in this one, but she would rise to horror stardom in Scream, released seven months later.\n\nPractical Magic (1998) used the feminine solidarity motif more effectively, though the there are only two central witches here, the sisters Sally and Gillian Owens, played by A-list Hollywood stars Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. Sally and Gillian have to overcome a family curse, the prejudices of the locals in their small Massachusetts town, and Gillian’s abusive boyfriend, but they emerge triumphant, not only because they stick together but because they rally the other women of the town to their cause. On the other hand, in a film that centers so strongly on the theme of feminine solidarity, they also need an assist from a kindly male detective (played by Adrian Quinn), so the film is a bit problematic as a feminist manifesto, even if Quinn’s characters does at least protect the film from appearing anti-male. All in all, the very serious problems posed in Practical Magic are solved a bit too easily, and the film was not a big success, despite its impressive cast.\n\nThe legacy of Salem witchcraft has loomed over the American witchcraft film from the very beginning, and it remains influential well into the twenty-first century. Rob Zombie’s The Lords of Salem (2012) draws directly on that legacy as it tells the story of a witch and her followers who were executed, but not before putting a curse on Reverend Hawthorne (Andrew Prine), their persecutor, ensuring that his bloodline will eventually produce the spawn of Satan. Fastforward to the present-day, and Hawthorne’s descendent, Adelaide Hawthorne (Sheri Moone Zombie) becomes haunted by the executed witches and then apparently gives birth to Satan’s child. Unlike Rosemary’s Baby (an obvious influence) this film gives us a look at that child, a grotesque, wriggling, many-tentacled creature that no one could mistake for human. The unseen infant in Rosemary’s Baby"
