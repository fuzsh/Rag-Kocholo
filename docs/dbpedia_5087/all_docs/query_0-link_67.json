        "text": "So I made a post yesterday talking about trying to figure out what new horror movies I should watch for Halloween Month and @i-am-negan-trash suggested we swap movie recommendations and I thought that was a great idea <3 I love suggesting movies and I want everyone to feel free to send their suggestions as well! I’m always looking for something new to watch :D\n\nI’m going to try my best to make this list more semi-obscure just because I feel if I recommend my popular favorites (Nightmare on Elm Street) more people will have already seen them and that doesn’t really help people find new movies.\n\nJacob’s Ladder (1990)\n\nI rewatched this one last month actually and it was as amazing as I remembered. This one is a great psychological horror film about a man who suffers from PTSD after coming home from the horrors he faced in the Vietnam war. This is also a film that inspired the creators of the Silent Hill games, especially with some of its macabre and surreal imagery (especially the shakey head effect). So if you like those games, especially Silent Hill 2, you’ll love this one. One warning is that there is a really harsh strobe effect during a dance party scene in the movie, so if you’re sensitive to that then I would suggest turning away during that scene.\n\nWishmaster (1997)\n\nI would classify this film (and it’s sequel) as really fun horror films. They have just that perfect blend of horror and a bit of dark humor. The film revolves around an ancient Djinn who is looking to destroy the world as we know it, but he can only achieve it if he grants three wishes to the one who summoned him, but of course he always turns his wishes back around on his victims. There’s a lot of horror icon cameos in this film (Robert Englund, Kane Hodder, and Tony Todd) which adds to some of the humor in the film.\n\nAll Cheerleaders Die (2013)\n\nThis one is a really great horror dark comedy about a group of cheerleaders who die in a car accident after being run off the road by some jocks and are resurrected by their witch friend to get revenge on the men that wronged them. If you’re up for a movie that includes wlw, vampire/succubus combos, and revenge plots then this movie is for you! The only bummer is that the film ends on a cliffhanger for a sequel that was never filmed, but besides that, it is such a great film.\n\nOrphan (2009)\n\nI have a lot of fond memories of watching this one at sleepovers when I was in high school. I’m not sure how remembered it is today but it is one that I still enjoy a lot. Esther, a sweet girl who is adopted by a loving family, is discovered to be much more than they bargained for. I really loved the twist of this movie a lot.\n\nSisters (1972)\n\nThis film is about a reporter who sees a murder happen from her window in her apartment complex, but because of her continuous whistleblowing on the cops, the cops don’t believe her and refuse to help her, so she must solve the crime herself. This one leans more towards horror/thriller, and is hugely inspired by Alfred Hitchcock (there are many sequences similar to Psycho and even the composer is the same).\n\nUrban Legend (1998)\n\nThis is another great horror film with an awesome twist to it. The film centers around a serial killer who is obsessed with urban legends and bases their murders on them. I don’t hear this one talked about often, which is a shame because it’s a lot of fun and watching how the killer pulls off the different urban legends was really interesting.\n\nRepo! The Genetic Opera (2008) / The Devil’s Carnival (2012) / Alleluia! The Devil’s Carnival (2016)\n\nThese three are going under the same entry because they’re done by the same man Terrance Zdunich (who plays both Grave Robber and Lucifer respectively), and they share a similar theme: Horror Movie Musical. If you’re a fan of Rocky Horror Picture Show, then you’re sure to love these three films. Repo! focuses on a future where surgery is a fashion statement and if you can’t keep up on your payments then you’ll get a visit from the repo man to take away those organs. The Devil’s Carnival series focuses on the growing war between heaven and hell, with Lucifer and God each struggling for power.\n\nHenry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986)\n\nThis one is a favorite of mine, as baby Michael Rooker (in his first film role) delivers one of the most sincere and creepy performances of a serial killer that I can think of. Based on the rumored crimes of real life serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, the film follows Henry on his daily routine as he stalks and murders whoever he pleases. This is definitely a film that will leave you depressed after watching it, that’s for sure."
