        "text": "1. CONVENTIONS OF HORROR SETTINGS  Small communities or isolated places. For example dark streets, narrow alleyways large alleyways or ghost towns.  Often places with a dark history. For example abandoned houses, hotels and insane asylums.  Examples of good horror settings include; lakes, farms, woodlands, graveyards, science labs, basements and many others.  In general you want the theme of isolation, being alone or claustrophobia to be dominant throughout the movie.\n\n3. TECHNICAL CONVENTIONS  .Camera work is generally unnatural-high and low angles shots can infer fear and nightmares, often used with sudden cuts of jagged movement to show anxiety of vulnerability. ExtremeCloseUps(ECU) are often used to portray the feelings of a horror victim through aiding the viewer identify with the final moments, as well as adding surprise and fear at no longer being able to see the perceived threat.  Point of view shots(POV) are often important to increase tension as they allow the audience a glimpse into the personality of the “monster” this viewpoint is often horrific displaying bloody weapons or an indication of stalking the next victim.  Handheld shots are used to create a sense of fear and confusion as it is far more difficult to make out what is happening. The Blair Witch Project is a notable example of this, the fear and confusion generated through constant shifting viewpoint truly generates shock and fear throughout the movie.  Framework uses the depth of the setting e.g. a long shot to bring awareness of a hostile presence to the viewer but withholding clarity of location of the beast or murderer. This is often used when the protagonist is being stalked.  Disturbing sounds are prevalent throughout horrors. The ambience of diegetic footsteps or the crunch of leaves in combination with non-diegetic sounds such as breathing or a heartbeat can cause fear and confusion amongst viewers.  Editing is generally very fast paced, leading to the convention of a surprise or horrific moment occurring after a moment of respite or relaxed pace.\n\n5. SYMBOLISM AND RECURRENT THEMES.  The visual style normally consists of shades of green, red and black. Normally the darker shades to connote evil, decay, danger, death, blood and other dangerous or abhorrent aspects.  Lighting is expressive and unnatural. Low key lighting is often used to create dark shadows and unfamiliar shapes in the gloom, leaning on the instinctual fear of the unknown. Lighting in horrors could be present only as a diegetic presence, such as bonfires or fireplaces.  Props are often used to provide the identity of a horror, identifying props with certain characters is often used. Jason with the Machete, Scream with the Knife and Freddy Kruger with Claw Hands for example. Others include Chainsaws, Costumes and Firearms.  The appearance of the monsters, such as Vampires, Mummies, Frankenstein and Werewolves helps connote fear, disgust and horrific disbelief. This is done to transfer the fear of the cast to the audience through the horrific visage before them.\n\n7. NARRATIVE STRUCTURE  The narrative structure does little to break from the norm as to create a horror it normally follows an almost formulaic approach, especially in Slasher films. An event that causes the killer to lose their grip on sanity; such as an abusive or unusual childhood, bullying, or even psychotic medical trauma or illness. Normally returning to their hometown and nearly always preying on teenagers. These teenagers represent immorality or pressure as caricatures of social castes and are often stupid or ignorant. Usually they start the horror in the first place, as the children who bully Jason and drown him in Friday the 13 th, or making fun of a relative of the Final girl in Scream 4. They are also killed off quickly through lack of judgement, and it often supports the convention of a “Final Girl”  Normally the story leaves room for sequels to build a franchise, such as seeing the killer looking on in the background or stirring from “death”.  Always a heroic protagonist, a man or “Final girl” in the film. A well used convention of the genre. The Narrative norm  Normally follows the Hero on a mission or quest to kill or solve problems.  The younger of the protagonists is usually portrayed as being the most inept or inexperienced due to age or arrogance.\n\n9. CHARACTER ARCHETYPES  The Protagonist-the Victim or Hero of the film. Often the one with a developed back story or the only character apart from the monster that recurs.  The Villain-A serial killer, Alien, monster or a mutated freak, often explained partially throughout the course of the story or the story itself is based around discovering the identity of the killer.  The stupid/immoral teens that act as fodder for the murderer.-sub-types include stalker, weirdo, jock and cheerleader among others.  Creepy or strange children. Often linked with the supernatural or knowing such as the small boy in The Ring.  Police officers-Often linked with good and bad, normally are killed towards the end or revealed as evil henchmen.\n\n11. THEMES  The typical themes associated with horror are…  Good versus Evil-Typically the Hero battling against an evil cult or monster are regularly seen.  Depression- This can often be shown through poverty, famine or abuse, often used as source for psychotic break in Villain.  Religion-Shown normally with a sinister twist, such as a demonic cult, Satanists are commonly used.  Childhood Trauma- Abuse, bullying and neglect are often used for a Villains back story, such as Billy in Scream, who was abandoned as a Child.  Revenge- Often used predominantly by the Evil characters, normally when a character perceived as good pursues revenge they are the next to die. Due to rash or poorly planned actions.  Supernatural- Used to create fantastical and unrealistic monsters. This theme is commonly explored and strongly linked to the fear of the unknown. As it is unexplained throughout the majority of the film.  Beyond Death- The idea of life after death is often warmed for horrific purposes, for example zombie films such as the Walking Dead. Or reanimated villains such as Friday the 13th.  Science gone wrong-The idea of “Playing God” has often been used as a negative and horror films often show the extremes of what could happen., Frankenstein is a classic example of such an event.  Zombie Apocalypse- Another theme commonly explored, a heavily infectious disease as well as depicting the emotions attached to a survivor having to re-kill as zombified version of a well known friend or relative.\n\n12. THEMES  Nightmares, Madness and Insanity- These themes are often explored through the “Strange” or introverted character in the group, often resulting in a psychotic break with the character either attacking the rest of the group or fleeing the group resulting in being murdered or simply killing themselves. This is done to disturb or unnerve the audience without involving the monster, making the characters more believable as you can see how they are coping.  Lust- Used especially in Teenage Horror films, the Villain could be depicted as an estranged lover or recluse infatuated with the final girl, or more disturbingly a murderer or serial killer garnering a form of arousal from the killing or abuse.  Self consciousness-This makes the audience question what is real and what is not, used often in psychological or supernatural films such as The Woman In Black.  Envy- Often used for Villains, can be used as motivation for murder, killing a boyfriend of an object of desire or perhaps somebody who is better off or worked with the killer, feeling cheated or misled in some way is often used as motivation for murder.  Suicide-Often linked to insanity, a notable challenge of this convention is in the Saw series of movies, the victims often end up killing themselves through lack of foresight or a mere accident, using unintentional suicide. Unexplained suicides are also common for contextual filler in a horror film."
