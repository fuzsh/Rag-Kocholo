        "text": "“A gory disappointment of a film based on a once beloved video game franchise based on psychological horror tropes and paranoia, now depicted through generic horror themes”\n\nWhere do I begin with this film? Okay, first of all, the first film was pretty decent. It wasn’t great, but it shown promise and wasn’t boring, but also made some sense. The best thing about the first movie was actually to do with the good pacing in the first half of the film, which mainly focuses on psychological horror and the protagonist’s desire to rescue her daughter.\n\n“Fan favourite monsters return from the first film, like Pyramid Head and the Nurses”\n\nThis time around, the daughter is grown up to be 18, and lives with her father, husband of the protagonist from the first film. Sharon has had recurring nightmares of Silent Hill for many years still, and is being hunted down by weird cult members from Silent Hill in order to use her to save them from their hell or something. Honestly, I couldn’t grasp the story that well, since the film done an awful job at keeping the story in the spotlight, but would randomly remind us that there was a story during boring scenes of dialogue. Instead, the film makers thought it’d be best to just throw in as many different types of monsters as possible within their probably low budget.\n\nSomehow, the scenes with the monsters in are just as boring as the dialogue. One genuinely terrifying monster from the first film literally only has 4 seconds of screen time and does nothing, while some spider like abomination, made from the once human now plastic mannequin body parts, manages to get somewhat longer screen time, despite how much it doesn’t fit in at all with the theme of Silent Hill. Not to mention, it’s not even a scary design, and looks too clean in comparison to the grungy, dull, warm coloured theme of the majority of the film.\n\nFan favourite monsters return from the first film, like Pyramid Head and the Nurses. While there is a good scene with the Nurses in a room with Sharon and her lover (who I’ll get to talking about in a moment) while he is tied to a table, the scene still feels like it was forced in just to please fans. Another act of fan service was the inclusion of the Nurses moaning oddly sexually, despite them having no mouths. Say what? Anyway, Pyramid head gets a boring scene towards the end where he fights against some female assassin monster who looks like a female Wade Wilson.\n\nPutting forced in monsters aside, what are the characters like? Well, Sharon spends the majority of the film being jump scared by anything and everything, even though she randomly decides to act like a confident individual when she feels like it, which doesn’t help me understand her character all too well. In fact, because of her random alterations in personality, this made some scenes appear unorthodox or just plain stupid. For instance, the film builds up towards the return of dark Sharon, but Sharon didn’t really know anything about this until her lover boy (that’s what I’m calling him) spent 5 minutes in a hotel expressing boring exposition about how he was part of the cult but sought to help her. In response to Dark Sharon being face to face with Sharon, Sharon suddenly talks like she is Count Dooku and somehow manages to implode Dark Sharon in under 4 minutes. Say what again? This film just throws too much, but mainly in exposition that I ended up not caring about.\n\nHer lover, Vincent, is such a crap character. He fancies Sharon for no reason, who by the way was actually called Heather, for some safety anti cult reason, for a grand majority of the film, but is randomly referred back to Sharon by all the characters later into the film. His appeal to her makes no sense, and he is only there to give a reason for her to visit Silent Hill, as well as her father being help hostage there. Vincent is so 1 dimensional, only really wanting to be her boyfriend, despite no chemistry or similarity being made at all. He’s just there, literally, just there. Also, why does he look gorgeous? He’s from Silent Hill! A place known to keep scary looking people! I love his hair though…\n\n“Characters who are built up to seem important are quickly killed off”\n\nWhat the film ultimately fails in is its overall change in horror theme. The first film captured the essence from the classic games, while this film decided to be more action orientated, which sucks. Due to this, this film was mostly full of generic horror tropes, like jump scares, which were purposely absent from the first film to deliberately create a cleverly creepy atmosphere. That is not visible here, as everything is thrown into your face in quick succession. Even characters who are built up to seem important are quickly killed off, only leading to confusion to why they had their introductions but then died anyway.\n\nOne final thing I have to point out is how awesome the credits are! The beginning of the credits show an amazing, high budget montage of some of the CGI monsters stationary from every angle possible, similar to the intro credits from Spiderman. Honestly, the camera smoothly swoops close up to every detail of the monsters you may have missed in the film, which actually helps make the monsters feel more dynamic and appear more detailed than what is actually shown. what the heck, film!\n\nOverall, this is not a scary film, but is actually as boring as heck. Even worse, it teases a sequel at the end, which I know can’t be any good. Characters are lazily written, monsters are rushed into unnecessary scenes, and the story is not engaging. Acting from the cast is relatively good, except from whoever plays Vincent, but there isn’t too much to complain about with acting, since all actions made by humans and monsters seem believable too. I don’t recommend watching this film, and would recommend watching the first film instead. It had promise, but felt too rushed.\n\nKIWI’S MOVIE RATING:"
