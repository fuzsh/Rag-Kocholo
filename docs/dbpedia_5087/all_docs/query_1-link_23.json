        "text": "*Author note: Given the subject matter of this article, I would like to state that I absolutely acknowledge everyone has their own experiences with mental illness. What I go through may not be what you go through and vice versa. Please note that the personal experiences below are my own, and do not necessarily reflect everyone’s experiences.\n\nVery few works of media have struck me in the way Silent Hill 2 does. As much as I adore this game, it also provides me an air of misery that’s difficult to ignore. A darkness that both fascinates and chills me. A haunting depth that is intriguing to observe, but also, eerily relatable.\n\nThere are numerous retrospectives that cover Silent Hill 2’s history (perfect given that the game just celebrated its 20th anniversary). This feature is not a retrospective, this is something much more personal (though there are aspects of the game I will be revisiting and exploring).\n\nIf you’re familiar with any of my writing, then you know I have a strong passion for psychological horror. Silent Hill 2 isn’t just my all-time favorite work of psychological horror, it’s my favorite work of horror in general. I am blown away when I think about what the game accomplishes thematically through both its narrative and gameplay structure; the level of detail provided throughout its runtime, as well as its breathtaking horror are masterful. It’s an experience that touches upon a great fear I have felt, one that invaded my younger life (while still popping up from time to time as an adult).\n\nI’m far removed from the person and actions that make up protagonist James Sunderland – but what the town of Silent Hill does to his mind – that’s a hell I am familiar with.\n\nAmong the many elements that have cemented Silent Hill 2’s legacy are its thematic depth and exploration. The craft of the video game narrative has reached greater heights since that of 2001; Silent Hill 2 however, was something beyond that of its contemporaries. It not only provides a story of heavy and mature subject matter, but details its themes and characters in a nuanced manner. It also uses its environment to further elevate its themes – the thick, ominous fog and decrepit landscape intensifying feelings of dread.\n\nAt its core, Silent Hill 2 is about grief and trauma. Shifting away from the cult-driven supernatural horror of the first game, Silent Hill 2 embraces psychological horror – said horror coming in the form of exploring the psyche of its protagonist James. Spoilers incoming. After the death of his wife Mary – who suffered from an illness – James gets a letter from her, inviting him to the town of Silent Hill (once considered their special place). As James ventures through the town, meeting its various monsters and other people within, layers of James’ mind begin to peel back. It is only later that the player finds out that, in his frustrations over Mary’s suffering, James actually killed her.\n\nIn portraying the mental state of James, the game utilizes an extraordinary and chilling blend of supernatural and psychological framing. One comes to find out as they play that this version of Silent Hill contains a mystical power – one capable of drawing in damaged people and warping their minds. The monsters James combats are physical manifestations of his inner struggles, be it: anger, repression, guilt, and so on. They are almost literal interpretations of his inner demons.\n\nThis physical manifestation of James’ psyche is what has captivated me for all these years and is a major reason why I love Silent Hill 2. The framing of monsters and environments to represent internal suffering has always been a fascinating concept to me. It’s very much the reason I fell in love with films such as The Babadook and Relic. The mind is a difficult terrain of horror not just to navigate, but to portray to others. Much more so in the past, stories pertaining to mental anguish or mental illness have relied on over-the-top presentations; someone dealing with a manic episode, schizophrenia, or depression is shown throwing themselves and banging their head against a wall. Now this isn’t to say that Silent Hill 2 doesn’t have its moments where it goes a little over the top, but throughout its overall presentation, it provides a much more subtle and intimate portrayal of what one’s own lonesome hell may be like.\n\nThe town of Silent Hill turns the mind of the individual on itself; it forces them to endure grueling, terrible monsters and environments that pull from their trauma and suffering. The town’s power forces these people to confront themselves and exist within a madness – a horror that I used to fear greatly.\n\nI absolutely believe that my mental illness has played some role in my passion for horror; that my difficulties have created an added bond of sorts with that of the macabre. A reason I have been drawn to art and entertainment of the dark, if you will, is because said art almost feels validating to my existence. Not the zombie infestation or slasher fests sort of dark, but those works pertaining to psychology. There are several disorders portrayed in cinema, games, and literature that I don’t have – but to see a representation of mental struggle, it makes me feel seen.\n\nI’ve written other articles speaking to my troubles with depression, but the most brutal of my uphill battles has always been OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is an… interesting disorder in our cultural discourse. I think that, among all the other mental illnesses that exist, it is by far one of the most used in terms of jokey statements. “I am very OCD, organization is super important to me.” Let alone these types of statements being ignorant, they also have the means to detract from what else OCD is capable in dealing out to those afflicted with it. In particular, the aspect that involves intrusive violent thoughts.\n\nIt shocked me some years ago when I came across an article from The Atlantic that actually talked about this form of OCD, only because it’s a side of OCD you don’t commonly hear about. While the thoughts are different from person to person, what this side of OCD does is spring abrasive and abrupt thoughts and visuals within one’s mind – specifically, something violent and/or shocking. This creates an immediate sense of repulsion and disturbance within the person, for these thoughts always pertain to something they would never do or think. Many of these thoughts may involve causing some sort of violence to a person, sometimes a loved one. It could be something like a thought where the individual lashes out and attacks someone with a weapon; perhaps the image of a random kitchen knife sets off an intrusive thought of violence, the OCD then working its way to layer on a fabricated narrative that the individual wishes to enact something cruel. The abrasive nature of said thoughts takes over the individual, the trigger kicking off the Compulsive component to OCD. The person will strive to go about a ritual that aims to rid them of such repulsion; this action is meant to not only reassure themselves of who they are, but may also serve as a repentance of sorts for feeling such shame.\n\nI am someone who has struggled with such OCD and horrific violent visuals, and every time something like this has come up, I’d repeat over and over that I am not a monster or some evil person. I’d repeat over and over that, I was sorry and repeat that I would never do such things. The thing is though, regardless of such awareness of myself, the initial repulsion also kicks off the Obsessive component to OCD; I’d become so disgusted with myself that I couldn’t let go of the thoughts. I’d allow them to linger and damn myself, saying that I was worthless and vile. The disorder tricks one into believing they are some kind of monster – it gaslights one to question their own sanity. In my case, a loving family and a therapist couldn’t convince me all the time that I wasn’t some vile bastard – my OCD had a hold of me.\n\nDuring those years where my OCD was at its worse, there were times I felt horribly alone within my head. Thankfully, over time with love, support, and finding community and art, I began to develop strong coping mechanisms and live a much happier life.\n\nIn the horror that I watch, read, and play, I’ve seen very few reflections of this sort of agony – that is, until Silent Hill 2.\n\nSilent Hill 2 isn’t about OCD, it isn’t even explicitly about mental illness – what it is about, however, is a story of a person who is suffering. Someone who is broken so badly, that their world and mind are turned inside out. Now, I’ve always viewed the events of Silent Hill 2 as James being punished for his actions, Silent Hill drawing him in and making him see the error of his ways; the parts of himself that have turned ugly. But in seeing James’ world transformed and him losing himself, that idea of disconnect chilled me (still chills me to this day). Granted, there are leagues of difference between James and I – but in a somewhat thematic, parallel line I can draw between the two – the game gets me to think back to my younger years. Those moments where my OCD was super rough, a particularly graphic thought striking and upsetting, and how I believed that I was cursed. What the town is doing to James, though fantastical, hits incredibly close to home regarding my sense of mental imprisonment.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the grueling things about OCD is the game it plays with one’s mind; how it ensnares someone in a warped reality that bashes them with negativity, tricking them into believing that there is something wrong with them. I’ve gone on to meet numerous people in my life with similar OCD, and in no way shocking, not one of them has a violent bone in their body. But that hasn’t stopped the disorder from attacking them and pushing a false narrative onto them.\n\nThat idea that I was some horrid person, that I was capable of harming people, that I deserved punishment – it all consumed me. When I was a kid and my OCD was really bad, I had this tremendous fear that not only was I actually this disgusting person, but that I would be forever trapped in this mentality. Plagued by horribly violent and cruel visuals, destined to be aware of my sense of self, but to also feel that my sense of self was a lie.\n\nIn experiencing how the town of Silent Hill manipulates James, I feared that a similar horror may happen to my mind. Not that I would stumble into a cursed mystical town that would mess with me, but that I was not actually aware of my reality and would reach a point of mentally snapping; having to live in a spiral of denial, hiding myself from the freak I was. In the way that James hides from his actions, hides from who he is – and to see how Silent Hill punishes him for that – I was afraid that would happen to me with my OCD.\n\nThe town of Silent Hill and that of the OCD-ridden mind have quite a lot in common; their cold indifference seek to take over, to immerse a person in a terror in which they must navigate on their own. Because when I think about the dark streets and corridors that make up Silent Hill, when I think about the monsters that are tucked away, waiting behind corners for James to turn – I think about the loneliness of it all. The player and James left to confront his mind with no sense of comfort. And when I think about all that, I think about one of the shittiest thoughts that one might struggle with when it comes to mental illness – that at the very end of the day, when you’re awake at night, you’re all alone in your head – you’re all alone in your personal hell.\n\nI’m in a much better place today, though, mental illness never completely goes away. At best, one learns ways to help them through life. In some quiet moments, I reflect on that isolating place OCD has put me in, the kind of place it can still bring me into from time to time. But when I also reflect on Silent Hill 2, rather than it triggering a great negativity out of me, I come to find a twisted sense of clarity.\n\nIn my younger years, with some exceptions, I went to horror for thrills. Some people do sports, I do slashers and demons. The darkness thrilled me and still thrills me to this day. It was very escapist, until I started to think more deeply into what some of that darkness meant.\n\nAs I’ve seen with myself and through others, horror has a means to heal. Through monsters, characters, and set pieces, horror has the means to touch upon subjects that may very much reflect our own reality. The losing of a loved one, the battling of addiction, the agony brought on by mental illness – the genre tackles these and so much more when it comes to the horrors that may take place in our lives. As an artist once told me some time ago, the fantastically grim can aid us in better processing life.\n\nAnd that’s why for as much as I can find Silent Hill 2 depressing, it doesn’t break or scare me. I used to fear some bizarre reality where my mind would take over and trap me into living horrifying intrusive thoughts – where I am trapped in a reality where I believe I am some kind of monster. But, I know all of that is just a bunch of anxiety bullshit. I could have let OCD consume me – wrapping myself up in a world of panic and second-guessing – but I didn’t. When I think about Silent Hill 2, it actually proves to me how far I’ve come as a person. The rawness I’ve experienced from Silent Hill 2 has provided me with strength; strength to look deeper in myself, strength to go to loved ones, strength to ask for help.\n\nThere are very few video games that even come close to the nuanced psychological depth that Silent Hill 2 offers. In the cannon of psychological horror, Silent Hill 2 stands as one of the genre’s most significant and fascinating works. In revisiting Silent Hill 2, its atmosphere of despair grips me; its characters, particularly that of James, still unnerve me. For me, it’s so much more than a brilliant video game – it’s true horror. Horror I can feel – horror that, to some degree, I can relate too.\n\nPersonally speaking, when living with mental illness, one may sometimes feel they are destined to be doomed. That there is no way out of one’s hell. Silent Hill 2 very much leans into this pessimistic side of things – but that doesn’t mean it’s true. Ironically, Silent Hill 2 makes me feel seen and aware of my being. I love how far down into the darkness the game goes; how willing it is to guide the player into such haunting, intimate terrain. This game is one of those works that makes me feel alive. To me, it is horror that heals.\n\nSilent Hill will always be my special place.\n\n‘Alien: Romulus’ is right around the corner, so it’s the perfect time to check out ‘Lily C.A.T.,’ an anime body horror classic that’s a gory tribute to ‘Alien’ and ‘The Thing’.\n\n“Confine them? We’re on a ship. We’re practically confined ourselves.”\n\nRidley Scott’s Alien is an iconic horror/science fiction hybrid that’s had its ups and downs as a film franchise, but remains an essential genre film 45 years later. Alien is such a tried and true property with limitless potential that it’s kind of remarkable that there hasn’t been an Alien animated series or in-universe anime that’s in the vein of The Animatrix that translates this iconic sci-fi horror property into animated madness where it can really let loose and not be confined by live-action’s limitations. An unreleased Alien vs. Predator anime is the closest thing that audiences have gotten to this, which is actually fully mixed and completed as of 2016.\n\nDisney is currently just sitting on the finished product as of its acquisition of 20th Century Fox and it’s unclear if they’re ever going to do anything with it at this point. There are so many horror films that try to make waves by being “Alien, but on a ….,” or “It’s like The Thing, only it’s set in a …” These copycat horror films understandably have mixed results. For every Life, Event Horizon, Contamination, and Galaxy of Terror, there’s an Inseminoid, Xtro II: The Second Encounter, and Critters 4. Somehow, one of the smartest Alien rip-offs is an ‘80s anime that mashes the Ridley Scott film together with another revered science fiction creature feature classic.\n\nLily C.A.T. an anime OVA – original video animation that’s akin to a direct-to-video movie – from 1987 that’s basically Alien meets The Thing. A bunch of astronauts awake from cryo-sleep and learn that a shapeshifting monster is taking them out, one-by-one, with little means of recourse. Over time, the crew learns that The Syncam Corporation, the company who is behind their mission, has betrayed them and set them up for failure, just like Ripley and her team in Alien. Lily C.A.T. is a rewarding sci-fi/horror anime that’s heavily inspired by Alien, but proves to be so much more. Fede Álvarez’s Alien: Romulus is set to revolutionize the flailing film franchise, along with Noah Hawley’s upcoming Alien: Earth FX series.\n\nThat being said, Lily C.A.T. is the Alien reimagining that you didn’t know you needed.\n\nLily C.A.T. is a unique property who was directed by Hisayuki Toriumi, who previously did extensive directing on Gatchaman, 1979’s Ultraman, and Battle of the Planets. Lily C.A.T.’s writer, Hiroyuki Hoshiyama, also cut his teeth writing for many mecha and giant robot series, such as Blue Comet SPT Layzner, Transformers: Super-God Masterforce, Patlabor, Future GPX Cyber Formula, and Turn A Gundam, not to mention all ten episodes of the Dirty Pair OVA. Toriumi and Hoshiyama’s mecha experience feels evident in Lily C.A.T., even if there are no giant robots present in the OVA. Their past experience is expressed through Lily C.A.T.’s grungy cyberpunk aesthetic and 23rd century setting. There are several shots and examples of technology on the central ship, Saldes, that feel like direct homages to Carpenter and Scott’s early film oeuvre. Additionally, the OVA’s monster designs come from Yoshitaka Amano, who may be no H.R. Giger, Stan Winston, or Rob Bottin, but he’s someone who’s established an impressive reputation and is best known for his artwork in Vampire Hunter D and the Final Fantasy games.\n\nLily C.A.T. has become more obscure in recent years, but it did have an English dub that was produced by Carl Macek and distributed by Streamline Pictures, who were a major player in the dubbing industry during the late ’80s and ’90s, handling Robotech, Macross, and some of the decade’s biggest dub releases like My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki’s Delivery Service, Akira, and Fist of the North Star. Lily C.A.T. was a notorious VHS release during the ’90s and became a bigger cult classic through its prominent airing on the Sci-Fi Channel Saturday Anime block. It was finally released on DVD in 2014, where an official Japanese with English subtitles version was available for the first time. Unfortunately, the DVD is now out of print and it’s since become a rare, expensive collector’s item (the VHS alone sells for anywhere between $40 and $90 on eBay), which is a testament to the ’80s OVA’s reputation and staying power.\n\nLily C.A.T. quickly stands out through its inspired editing that keeps its central mystery alive, the tension taught, and the audience on the edge of their seats. There’s such a tight story that immediately gets moving and essentially has zero filler because of the OVA’s relatively short runtime. This tight, well-paced narrative is complemented by graphic kills and ridiculous transformation sequences. The first transformation scene is a gory, bloody spectacle that genuinely catches the audience by surprise. Biological viscera mingles with extraterrestrial acids so that the whole display feels truly otherworldly in nature. A cat’s ribs separate and explode as it’s turned into some surreal, monstrous hand puppet that’s immediately evocative of the dog’s transformation sequence in The Thing. Lily C.A.T. only gets more outrageous as it moves forward. Organs splatter and paint the ship’s interior like biological fireworks. The subsequent transformation sequences are even more disturbing and gruesome. There’s a truly gonzo moment when one of the crew members flamethrowers a cat until it’s willed into submission, only for the feline’s face to peel off and reveal its robotic insides. It’s such a gloriously anime visual that in many ways is even more extreme and over the top than anything that’s in the original Alien.\n\nThe threat of a biological virus that spreads through the Saldes ship intensifies its terror through evocative shots of tight, sterile corridors that are dense in steam, shadow, and danger. Lily C.A.T. is careful to not overextend itself and it understands the value in how less can be more. This makes it all the more unfortunate that this effective title has slipped through the cracks and remains relatively obscure and unknown, despite it absolutely nailing what it’s going for. It’s one of the most genuinely unnerving anime movies and OVAs to come out of the ‘80s, which was a decade that was absolutely rampant with ultra-violent body horror content, like Wicked City and Demon City Shinjuku.\n\nLily C.A.T. is so much better for saying what it has to in a concise 67 minutes, instead of being drawn out into a longer movie with an unnecessary extra act. It’s easy to picture a modern adaptation of Lily C.A.T. that’s told as a limited series. A longer, serialized venture of this nature could potentially work, especially if it were to put an even greater focus on its characters, but a Lily C.A.T. series runs the risk of ruining the OVA’s magic and wrecking the tension that’s effectively created in this tight production. It’s for the best that Lily C.A.T. is what it is – and that it’s not even adapted from manga source material – rather than being one piece of a greater whole.\n\nIn fact, director Toriumi, had been vocal about his desire to create an anime version of the popular “bakeneko” subgenre of horror films that focus on yokai/demon cats – who often have shapeshifting abilities – and the terrors that surround them. A cat, Jonesy, is of course central to Alien and another way in which Alien and Lily C.A.T. are alike (and The Thing builds a major centerpiece out of its shapeshifting dog). It’s curious to note that Lily C.A.T.’s whole concept came out of a desire to riff on the bakeneko subgenre, rather than an attempt to reverse-engineer Alien elements.\n\nProductions like Lily C.A.T., Alien, and The Thing often live or die based on their cast of characters and how successfully they connect with viewers. Lily C.A.T. introduces a varied group of archetypal figures on the Saldes who almost feel like they’re ripped out of Street Fighter. They’re appropriate types of cannon fodder for a story of this nature. One of Lily C.A.T.’s greatest joys is how this cast quickly grows on the viewer and how easy it is to actively root for them by the film’s final act. Lily C.A.T. makes you genuinely care for these characters, even if they may initially come across as one-dimensional, and this helps the film really stick the landing with its ending. It’s all-too easy for Alien and Thing copycats to have disposable characters who are of little consequence when they finally bite the dust. Every death in Lily C.A.T. hits hard and the film’s ending is reminiscent of Ripley and Newt’s triumphant escape during Aliens’ finale.\n\nIn addition to the shapeshifting terror that threatens Saldes’ crew, Lily C.A.T. also explores the idea that two people on the ship may be imposters, specifically “time escapees.” These are individuals who commit crimes, sneak on a ship, use its cryosleep to get away for 40-60 years, only to return to Earth where they’re now able to operate freely because no one remembers what they did half-a-century ago. It’s actually a really creative concept and the type of idea that you’d find in the best works of Philip K. Dick or Isaac Asimov. This beautifully illustrates how criminals can take advantage of technological advancements for their own selfish gains.\n\nLily C.A.T. could simply coast on ghoulish visuals and grisly murders alone, but there’s some deeper material in play as Saldes’ crew ruminate on the inherent loneliness of their work. Their mission rips them from their lives and turns them into missing pieces of a puzzle that they no longer fit into anymore. It’s appreciated that Lily C.A.T. explores these heavier questions and the mental toll that all this puts on its characters, even before they’re exposed to this shapeshifting, murderous bacteria. Lily C.A.T. isn’t nearly as deep as Alien and is limited by its length, but it does attempt to get in its cast’s head in a slightly more invasive manner than Ridley Scott’s film.\n\nLily C.A.T. concludes with an epic finale that’s on par with Alien, yet it’s even more daring and graceful in some respects. The characters are prepared to sacrifice themselves for the greater good so that the Saldes doesn’t return to Earth with this deadly bacteria in tow and liable to contaminate the entire planet. There are some brutal moments where the crew contemplate their ends and taking the easy way out instead of confronting the horrors of this monster. Ultimately, they rise to the occasion and consider a more noble end. During the film’s final moments of success, a melancholy Jiro prompts a question to Nancy: “Do you think the beautiful butterfly finds it repulsive that it was once a caterpillar?” It’s a poetic query that encapsulates the philosophical tug of war that’s in play in Lily C.A.T. and it casts the heroes’ victory in a darker, uncomfortable light. It’s a powerful, thought-provoking conclusion that beats out many modern science fiction and horror stories – anime or otherwise.\n\nMore than 35 years later, Lily C.A.T. is still an extremely satisfying companion piece to Alien: Romulus that should be added to everyone’s Alien binge list before they check out the new film.\n\n‘Lily C.A.T.’ is currently available to stream for free on The Roku Channel."
