        "text": "“An interesting psychological thriller with less horror than you might expect”\n\nSilent Hill was once a widely popular video game franchise that rivaled with the classic Resident Evil games, of which were also based on horror aspects. Whilst Resident Evil games, and movies, focused on action and more of a simple story, the Silent Hill franchise decided to focus on the cleverly ambitious theme of psychological thriller intended to stir your mind and emotions up with cleverly designed horror gameplay. It only makes sense Silent Hill would have created a film to rival with the Resident Evil films, but sadly, this film came too late, as the franchise was losing popularity as of 2006, as the games released around that time were not as memorable as the classics that made Silent Hill a recognizable title.\n\nAlthough I have never played a Silent Hill game, I have seen playthroughs of some games that have taught me some knowledge of the series. Furthermore, because of my limited knowledge, I watched this film with low expectations and acted as if I didn’t know any of the iconic enemies or locations.\n\nFirst of all, the games are based around survival horror, so its only fair to see the film as that sort of style too. For the most case, this film actually does realistically portray what a lonely character would do in a foggy, unknown location like Silent Hill. Our protagonist, Rose, ends up losing her adopted daughter in Silent Hill, who she soon learns is the spitting image of some weird “devil” child who controls the darkness that attacks Silent Hill, but only when the ingeniously terrifying World War 2 Air Raid siren goes off. With that being said, the film never makes it clear why the darkness creates living nightmares in the first place. Don’t get me wrong, when the siren does go off, it serves as a clever way to alert the audience that all hell is going to break loose, much like the original purpose of the siren in World War 2, as if bombing planes would swiftly swoop over above. Then again, the darkness is what makes this film so interesting, since when the darkness approaches, it transforms the already creepy looking town into a rusted, industrial hell full of tortured looking enemies that are designed to be genuinely scary in a real life scenario through an amazing effect. Although I wasn’t ever really scared of any scene in this film, I could understand the fear I’d have in real life, since the monsters of Silent Hill are true to their video game counterparts, but actually do not work well in film form. When playing the video game, it is going to be more scary because there is your life at risk with you in control, but in the film, we know Rose is going to survive every threat, so there’s no fear in losing her. She’s too good at running away from every situation.\n\n“The monsters of Silent Hill are true to their video game counterparts”\n\nArguably, what this film does really well is use great sound design to create creepy atmosphere, and actually never aims to fall flat trying to jump scare you, even though I was expecting to receive a jump scare around particular scenes. Not to mention, the locations all look genuinely scary and haunting. At first, Silent Hill is just a foggy, quiet town that looks abandoned, which allowed for slow pacing to justify the size of Silent Hill. Arguably as well, what the film doesn’t do very well is wok with an interesting story. At first, the adopted daughter, Sharon, is shown to commonly sleep walk and dream about Silent Hill, a place not found on any maps but is weirdly known locally. Sharon draws dark crayon drawings over her original cheerful drawings that now represent locations in Silent Hill she dreams of. Rose thinks it is best to visit Silent Hill to hopefully let whatever memories Sharon has will come out, whilst Rose’s husband disagrees thinking there’d be better use giving Sharon psychiatric care, which leads to Rose driving off with Sharon looking for Silent Hill without his help. Not all goes to plan as Rose ends up crashing her car in Silent Hill whilst trying to avoid a “Grudge like” character walking in the way of the road. Not to mention, a female police officer decides to chase her due to the fact Silent Hill is supposed to be close off due to an underground coal fire causing harmful fumes to cover the entire place. While this brief backstory is welcomed, it only made me think that the whole story was pointless, as all the characters could just be high from the fumes, reminding me of the classic Simpsons episode were people pray around a statue because they believe a God is replying to their prayers, but is actually due to nearby gas leak making them hallucinate.\n\n“The second half of the film twists around as much as a newspaper does when being rolled into a bat”\n\nWhile Rose greets herself as a relatable character, who traditionally runs away from almost every situation in the first half of the film, I actually respected her courage to go through all this hell to bring Sharon back to safety. Sadly though, the film weirdly doesn’t build up too much character development, and instead pushes us straight into the action. Also, this film could have easily featured only female characters, since the only male characters seem to be the husband and the odd resident of Silent hill, or monster, who are all actually terrifying and simple minded. Whereas, the female cast are all represented as smart, strong and knowledgeable. Surprisingly, this film also breaks the mold by making the protagonist a non brunette female protagonist in a horror film, since it is a cliche to feature such a design character to host most of the screen time. Kudos to Silent Hill for not following cliches. Laurie Holden (Andrea from The Walking Dead) plays Cybil, the cop who also ends up in Silent Hill with Rose as a character who is meant to resemble a laughably stereotypical tough, yet good looking cop who at first is dedicated to her duty, but quickly softens up to Rose’s attitude to finding Sharon. Heck, Cybil is the only character with a gun, and she even proves the lack of power it grants when she eventually tries to fight off the supremely terrifying Pyramid Head monster.\n\nThen again, with that being said, the monsters in this film are actually more terrifying since no one actually manages to kill any, except for the weird looking bugs that attack any living thing in huge numbers, like a colony of ants feasting on a cookie. In the end, I really appreciate that choice, since many films feel the need to include a badass scene with a badass character defeating a monster that was once so feared, much like in Alien. Again, kudos to Silent Hill for breaking the mold. Sadly though, the second half of the film twists around as much as a newspaper does when being rolled into a bat. The second half delves into the reasoning for Sharon’s connection to Silent Hill, explaining how this twin child, Dark Sharon, is pretty much the darkness that transforms Silent Hill into hell, and too be honest, this is where I lost interest. You see, the notion of this added the reason for a random cult finding safety in a church Sharon drew about in her dreams who believe in witches because of their leader being a controllable liar to her people. The church is somehow the only place in Silent Hill which is protected by the darkness, but contains just as much evil inside. For instance, the cult leader casually likes to burn witches, or so she concludes to be a witch with no proof other than her shouting “WITCH”. To be honest, I couldn’t help but laugh every time she commanded her 1 dimensional people to stupidly attack Rose and Cybil for somehow being witches. Despite this, this also leads to Rose using their help to locate Sharon, which ends up being Dark Sharon who enters Rose’s body to unleash hell when she returns to the church to somehow save real Sharon by making Dark Sharon a monstrous barb wire limbed creature attacking the cult as if she was a kraken ripping apart people sized seaweed. Simply put, the second half is confusing and plays too quickly.\n\nThe movie ends on a depressing note, which I won’t spoil, but is not ultimately explained too well. For what the film does right is the scenes with the monsters and expertly designed locations that both emit a well cared for sense of horror. While the first half focused on loneliness and adventure, which was what made this film interesting, the second half just turns into a revenge plot that seems forced in to spruce up the story. The scenes with the monsters are by far the best moments. Especially the scene with the mysteriously clothed faced female nurses with weirdly supposed to be sexy bodies. Say what you want about the design, but I thought they were super creepy with their stiff movements and fast lunges. There is actually a small scene were Rose has to drop her torch to manage her way through and in between at least 30 of these nurses wielding small weapons, and their movements actually made them more terrifying as they tried to sniff out and sense whether Rose was near or not. Not to mention, the iconic Pyramid Head uses his massive blade at one point to attack Rose and Cybil, but also get a scene later were he epicly rips a person in 2 as if they were made of paper. Without a doubt, there is a lot of gore in this film, and indeed some decent special effects. Acting is also good, except from Cybil at times, but that is expected since she was Andrea from The Walking Dead.\n\nOverall, this is a good film based on a video game. There are not a lot of good video game films out there, but this one is decent. It was building up to be great, but became too confusing and actually boring, since I didn’t actually care much for the characters in the end. If the film stuck to the atmospheric horror from the first half, then the adventure would have been more welcomed. A good film, but gets messy towards the end. Only watch if you want a twist on modern horror films. In the end, its just okay.\n\nKIWI’S MOVIE RATING:"
