        "text": "Well, I thought that I’d talk briefly about one of the more easily-overlooked elements of the psychological horror genre today. I am, of course, talking about settings and/or location designs. This was something that I initially ended up thinking about whilst playing the Game Of The Year Deluxe edition of “The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion” (2006) and stumbling across the 2007 expansion “Shivering Isles”.\n\nTo my surprise, far from just being another fantasy adventure, this expansion is actually a surprisingly creepy psychological horror game in disguise. Although a fair amount of the unsettling horror comes from the creepy characters, from giant insect monsters and from some moments where the game pushes your character to do evil things – one of the main sources of psychological horror is the setting itself. The game set on an island in the “Realm Of Madness” and – if you’ve ever played “American McGee’s Alice” (2000) – then you might feel a very familiar sense of creeping unease here.\n\nGiant plants aside, the reasons why the locations in both of these psychological horror games are so creepy are because of contrast, symbolism and unreliable reality. For starters, both games use “beautiful” surreal location designs in order to contrast a feeling of magic and wonder with the unsettling horrors that lie within these locations. This contrast creates a brilliant tension between curiosity and cautious dread in the audience.\n\nFor some great cinematic examples of this sort of thing, I’d recommend watching art-horror films like Tarsem Singh’s 2000 film “The Cell” or Dario Argento’s 1977 masterpiece “Suspiria“.\n\nGoing back to the two games I mentioned earlier, symbolic location design is also a major part of both games – with the locations symbolising a disturbed mind. In “American McGee’s Alice”, this symbolism usually takes the form of background details related to the main character or the fact that many locations are “evil” versions of places Alice has visited before (eg: in Lewis Carroll’s “Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland”), reflecting her tragic past and inner turmoil. In “Shivering Isles”, the island in the expansion is divided into the bright and verdant realm of “Mania” and the gloomy, grim world of “Dementia” – emphasising the game’s psychological themes.\n\nThe concept of “unreliable reality” is also a great way to use a location to evoke psychological horror. This is where the world itself cannot be trusted and/or doesn’t quite follow the “ordinary” rules of reality. Although this type of location design does have to follow some “rules” in order for the story/setting to feel coherent, this can take the form of dream logic or something like that.\n\nThe very best example of this type of location design can actually be found in the first four “Silent Hill” games – where the game’s cold, abandoned and/or fog-shrouded locations will sometimes suddenly change into a nightmarish rusty “otherworld” version of themselves. This also reflects Freud’s concept of “The Uncanny” – where something is both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time, and therefore disturbing.\n\nAnd, talking of the older “Silent Hill” games, they also serve as a great example of another way to use locations to evoke psychological horror. I am, of course, talking about bleakness, desolation and loneliness. Typically cold and utilitarian locations and/or abandoned places are good for this – but the goal is to create an eerie feeling of a dead, uncaring world that is bereft of warmth or joy.\n\nOn a side-note, this screenshot also shows yet another way to use locations to create psychological horror. I am – of course – talking about claustrophobia. If a location feels cramped, windowless etc… or a character is trapped somewhere scary, then this can create a subtle feeling of suspense and oppressive unease. This works especially well in the sci-fi horror genre, where characters can end up being trapped on spaceships – such as in Ridley Scott’s classic 1979 film “Alien” or the – much scarier – 1997 film “Event Horizon“.\n\nBut, most of all, the very best way to use settings to evoke psychological horror is to make the setting a character in it’s own right. Whether this involves a plot-critical location that appears regularly, a location that reflects the life of an unseen character, a location with a disturbing history or even a location that has paranormal elements, the best way to use settings in the psychological horror genre is to make them a character in their own right.\n\nThe very best examples of this can be found in ghost stories – such as in Shirley Jackson’s 1959 classic “The Haunting Of Hill House“, James Herbert’s overlooked 1988 masterpiece “Haunted” or – to a lesser extent – Susan Hill’s excellent 1983 gothic novel “The Woman In Black“.\n\nSo, yes, if you are creating something in the psychological horror genre, be sure to think about the settings you are going to use.\n\n————————\n\nAnyway, I hope that this was useful 🙂"
