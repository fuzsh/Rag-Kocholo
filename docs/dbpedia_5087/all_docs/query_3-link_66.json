        "text": "Konami, the Japan-based developer has hinted that more Silent Hill remakes are in the works other than the already known Silent Hill 2. This comes from the latest earnings results announced by Konami for April 1 and September 30, 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKonami confirmed last year that it is working on reviving the popular horror franchise and announced that new games are in the works alongside a PS5 exclusive Silent Hill 2 remake from Polish developer Bloober Team.\n\nKonami’s Latest Earnings Call Hints at Silent Hill “Remakes”\n\nIn a statement with its financial results for six months its current plans, title releases for the future, and what it hopes to achieve in the coming future. A part of this statement was the multiple “remakes” that are potentially in the works alongside the Metal Gear series. This has sparked speculation that there could be a potential trilogy in the works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKonami said that it is working on Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater which will bring the game’s beloved game with modern graphics and revealed its plans for “remakes” in the iconic horror franchise. It stated:\n\nAs for ongoing efforts, we are working diligently on Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater, which faithfully recreates the story, characters, and game design of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, one of the most beloved entries in the Metal Gear series, and updates its graphical style to modern graphics for the current generation, as well as remakes and completely new entries in the Silent Hill series, which gained popularity as a psychological horror game.\n\nHowever, there are chances that this statement could be an error as well and the company simply wanted to state “remake”, it still raises the possibility of multiple Silent Hill remakes that could be in development at the moment.\n\nKonami also stated in a special note in the press release that the statements are based on assumptions and beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Here’s what it said:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis document contains “forward-looking statements,” or statements related to future events that are based on management’s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties.\n\nWhen relying on forward-looking statements to make investments, you should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Actual results may be affected by a number of important factors and may be materially different from those discussed in forward-looking statements.\n\nSuch factors include but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions affecting our operations, market trends, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the value of the Japanese yen, the U.S. dollar, and the Euro.\n\nEarlier this year, developer Bloomer Team stated that the Silent Hill 2 Remake was almost complete. Silent Hill 2 is one of the most popular games in the franchise and introduced Pyramid Head. The remake is being developed using Unreal Engine 5 and will bring new combat mechanics and set pieces with an over-the-shoulder camera, for extra creeps.\n\nTwo other games in the franchise are under development including Silent Hill Townfall which is in development at NoCode and will be published by Annapurna Interactive and Silent Hill F is being developed by NeoBards Entertainment and will be published by Konami.\n\nSilent Hill F has been described as bringing a “completely new story set in 1960s Japan featuring a beautiful, yet horrifying world.” Konami recently released Silent Hill Ascension which had a disastrous launch and has fallen flat only a few days after release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe game has been criticized for several aspects with the microtransactions taking the top spot. It is an “interactive streaming series” where players vote on choices together which shapes the canon of Silent Hill."
