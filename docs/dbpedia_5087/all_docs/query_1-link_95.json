        "text": "Well, for this article in my series about horror videogames, I thought that I’d take another look at the second and third “Silent Hill” games. In particular, how both of them handle the theme of memory in some interestingly creepy and incredibly clever ways.\n\nNeedless to say, this article will contain MAJOR SPOILERS for both games (plus, “Silent Hill” (1999) – and both the 2018 and 1977 versions of “Suspiria” too) and, since these are psychological horror games, DISTURBING CONTENT too.\n\nLet’s start with “Silent Hill 2” (2001), which begins with one of the best introductory sequences you will ever see in a horror videogame. After a moody scene showing a weary-looking man – James – staring at himself in a dirty mirror in a dilapidated roadside bathroom, he walks outside and looks out over a grey, fog-shrouded forest at a mysterious town in the distance.\n\nThen, in a voice-over, we hear his wife Mary talking fondly about her memories of going on holiday to the resort town of Silent Hill with him. She says that she is waiting for him in their “special place”. Then James takes over the voice-over to explain that was remembering a letter that he got from Mary recently. However, Mary died three years earlier from an unspecified disease. Yet, even though he’s sure that the letter can’t be real, he still has to visit the town in case she is somehow there.\n\nOne of the most interesting parts of this introduction is the excellent use of visual contrast to show the passing of time and the difference between memory and reality. When James remembers Mary’s letter, the emotional tone is a lot warmer and more nostalgic – yet the first thing that the player sees of this rose-tinted resort town is a cold, bleak and harsh landscape.\n\nThis is further emphasised when the peacefully bittersweet guitar music suddenly gives way to eerie, echoing ambient noise as soon as the voice-over ends. The game is set in the same place that both James and Mary remember, but the passage of time has changed it from something warm and joyous to something cold and empty. If you’ve ever revisited somewhere that you felt nostalgic about, only to find that it is different to what you remember – then you’ll probably understand how expertly the game captures THIS feeling.\n\nThis theme is further emphasised when James meets another character called Maria. She is similar to his late wife, Mary, but she is also different in both visual and character terms. Whilst Mary dressed conservatively, Maria wears more of a “party” outfit. Whilst Mary had slightly faded light brown hair, Maria has bleached blonde hair. Their personalities are also subtly different too – with Maria being more care-free, expressive and seductive. There’s a very strong implication that Maria is the kind of person James wanted Mary to be. As well as being a brilliant example of Freud’s concept of “The Uncanny“, Maria is a literal manifestation of James’ rose-tinted memories… whilst the manifestation of his real memories of Mary literally turn into a vengeful monster at the end of the game. Why “vengeful”? Well, read on…\n\nOf course, the theme of memory in this game goes a lot deeper than this. As fans of the game will already know, Mary was ill but didn’t die of a disease. She was murdered…by James. However, James has repressed his guilty memories so much that he genuinely believes that she has succumbed to the disease until – in a shocking plot twist, foreshadowed in all sorts of clever subtle ways – he finally remembers everything. It is a game about extreme guilt and self-loathing, about the gulf between rose-tinted memory and bleak reality. And this is probably one of the main reasons why it’s such a deeply unsettling and memorable horror game.\n\n“Silent Hill 3” (2003) is also very much a game about memories too, but it handles them in a slightly different – and arguably more clever – way. The main character, Heather Mason, is an ordinary teenager who begins the game by having a nightmare about a rusty, dilapidated monster-filled fairground before waking up at a café table in an ordinary shopping centre. She calls her father and is about to return home, when a creepy private detective tries to talk to her. She hides in a bathroom – but notices a strange occult symbol painted on the mirror that seems oddly familiar to her. She makes a comment about how much she hates mirrors. Then, after climbing out of the window, the world around her slowly begins to turn into a distorted nightmare-world, not unlike the one in her dream….\n\nAlthough the plot of this game only fully makes sense if you’ve played “Silent Hill” (1999) first – the general point of it is that Heather is a reincarnation of a character from that game. A young girl called Alyssa who was raised by a mysterious cult and who slowly died in agony after suffering horrendous injuries in a fire. Heather has completely repressed her memories of being in a cult or her painful death, yet – as the game progresses – more and more of these memories begin to emerge. At one point, she looks in a mirror and sees a bloodstained/burned Alyssa-like reflection of herself surrounded by tendrils of blood… before the blood gradually begins to appear on the other side of the mirror, symbolising her repressed past seeping into her present. Later, she actually has to fight that reflection in a challenging boss battle.\n\nThis game is one of the best expressions of introspection and how bad memories can linger. Heather is also literally infected with her past – eg: a creepy parasite that has taken up residence inside her body – and the scene where she gets rid of it is kind of a metaphor for dealing with bad memories. She also suddenly has “strange” reactions (eg: when using save points, looking at mirrors etc…) that she cannot initially explain and has to learn about via a journey of self-discovery.\n\nBecause of the game’s focus on introspection and on processing and conquering bad memories, it is a very scary – yet also weirdly “feel-good”- kind of horror game at the same time. One of the only other things I’ve found that uses this exact style of horror is Luca Guadagnino’s 2018 remake of Dario Argento’s 1977 art-horror masterpiece “Suspiria“.\n\nGuadagnino’s remake makes some major changes to the plot of Argento’s original and one of the best ones is that a powerful ancient witch – Mater Suspiriorum – isn’t just a random horror villain that the main character fights shortly before the end credits, but is instead… the main character herself. Like Heather Mason, the main character in this film (Susie Bannion, played by Dakota Johnson) comes from a stifling cult-like religious background and has repressed the fact that she is a reincarnation of this character.\n\nSeriously, in a weird way, the 2018 “Suspiria” remake is perhaps the very best adaptation of “Silent Hill 3” that I’ve ever seen. It even stars Tilda Swinton, who was the main inspiration for the original voice-acting/visual design of one of the villains (Claudia) in “Silent Hill 3” too – and she plays a vaguely similar type of character in “Suspiria” (2018). Yes, the film is different in a lot of ways – but, thematically speaking, it is a much better adaptation than “Silent Hill: Revelation” (2012) was. But, I’m getting side-tracked….\n\nAnyway, “Silent Hill 2” (2001) and “Silent Hill 3” (2003) are perhaps the absolute highlights of the series because of the really intelligent, nuanced and complex way that they use the theme of memory as both a central source of horror and drama. They are extremely well-written games.\n\n—————–\n\nAnyway, I hope that this was interesting 🙂"
