        "text": "Greetings horror fans! In the previous post we discussed about the use of color in the horror genre. Different colors evoke different emotional responses: red, black and grey tend to give you the creeps or get you pumped, while blue and green are best used in quiet and calming situations. With the proper use of color, a horror creator can play up with the emotions of the viewer the way he wants. To give an example of this, we will compare and contrast two horror videogames from the same series: Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill Homecoming.\n\nSilent Hill 2, developed by the japanese Team Silent, was originally released in 2001 and has since gained universal acclaim and a much deserved cult following for being one of the scariest horror games of all time. It had the perfect blend of atmospheric thrills and creepy monster design, and set the bar for all horrors game to follow. The more recent Silent Hill Homecoming, on the other hand, was developed by american based Double Helix, and the critical and fan reaction to it was, to put it simply, lukewarm. The most common complaint was that the game wasn’t really scary, or at least it wasn’t compared to previous Silent Hill releases. It had probably something to do with the general shift in tone (from psychological horror to full-blown gore) and the less imaginative monster design. But one of the elements that it struck out the most to us was the choice of colors.\n\nIf you take a look at Silent Hill 2, you can clearly see that the predominant tones were blacks, greys, reds and browns. The colors of darkness, fog, dried blood, rusting metal and bodily functions. As we mentioned in the previous post, these hues are greatly implemented in horror due to the emotional response they cause, and in this case they were used masterfully. The town itself looked like it was alive and rotting at the same time, giving you the impression of walking inside a bigger, scarier monster. These colors served the purpose of frightening the player, and boy were they effective.\n\nNow, take a look at Homecoming. Sure, the game is still very dark, but the reds, greys and browns have been replaced by various tones of blue and orange. Blue and orange are also ubiquitously used in cinematography, especially in the recent years since computers made color filtering much easier. Orange is the closest approximation to a white human’s skin tone, and human characters are the things you will look at the most while watching a movie. To give balance to the image, you then have to use teal and light blue, the contrasting colors of orange. It makes for a pleasing color palette, and filmmakers will sometimes filter entire movies through blue and orange.\n\nThe designers of Homecoming took this concept of color contrast and applied it to their game. As you can see in this review of Homecoming, made by Silent Hill connoisseurs (and nerd rage artists) Twin Perfect, the entire game has a grey blue, peachy orange look to it. Outside areas are blue, inside areas are orange, even the fog is grey blue and the rust is orange.\n\nIf you like 2-hour long reviews explaining in excruciating detail everything that's wrong with the recent Silent Hill games, you have found home.\n\nBlue and orange are easy on the eyes, and there’s nothing wrong with that: this blog has a similar color scheme. The question is why would you use a pleasing color palette in a game that is supposed to be terrifying and unsettling. Blue is a calming color, orange is energetic and it’s associated with warmth and joy, and using them throughout a horror game doesn’t reinforce the feeling of fear and tension. Silent Hill Shattered Memories, the following game developed by Climax Studios, had a similar problem: whenever you find yourself in the “cold” version of Silent Hill, everything shifts towards an icy blue. These are also the only moments in the game when monsters attack you. Your brain receives contrasting signals, and the emotion of fear quickly vanishes.\n\nAn example of good use of color, on the other hand, would be the indie horror game Lone Survivor by Jasper Byrne. Abandoned apartments and corridors are dark, rusted, and full of brown monsters. Despite the low fidelity pixelated artstyle, they all feel pretty scary. The only safe place (your apartment) is instead, you guessed it, a relaxing blue.\n\nYou can’t make a good horror experience only using color, of course. But the color mood association effect is powerful and can make a difference in our response to a visual stimulation. And if you choose the right colors, you can make a scary scene even scarier."
