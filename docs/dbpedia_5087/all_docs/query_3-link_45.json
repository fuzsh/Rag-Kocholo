        "text": "Horror is a genre that aims to elicit negative and frightening reactions in viewers through scenes involving their fears. Supernatural and macabre themes are common, often involving evil forces like vampires or demons. The history of horror films began in the late 1890s with early silent films and continued to evolve through the decades. Key developments included Universal Studios' classic monster films of the 1930s-40s, the rise of psychological horror and slashers in the 1960s-80s, self-aware parodies in the 1990s, and renewed popularity of franchises, psychological horror and zombie films from the 2000s onward."
