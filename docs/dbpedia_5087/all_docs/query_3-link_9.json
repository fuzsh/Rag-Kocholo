        "text": "There's a few reasons for this, and I was actually talking about this in a Resident Evil discord the other day but also about Fatal Frame (which sells even worse) and Dead Space.\n\nResident Evil has always been the king of horror games in pure terms of sales, it outsells nearly all of its competition by a pretty severe degree. There's a few games that get close to touching its top selling numbers, but it still has the highest and most consistent of the lot. It's not even the action co-op games that sell a lot, for example Resident Evil 2 has sold over 5 million copies, Resident Evil HD Remaster has sold over 2 million copies at this point, Resident Evil 7 has sold over 5 million copies at this point, etc. This also sort of talks about the modern 'wall' of horror games, I think the exact maximum that a horror game has sold is around 6 million copies, which means that's the 'max' number of copies a horror game has sold at this point and most don't get close to that number. This isn't all doom or gloom though, as also within the last 8 years or so I don't think there's been a bigger budget horror game that hasn't gone on to sell at least 2 million copies down the line - I also will note that horror games seem to have much longer tails than most other genres, less sales at the forefront and more down the line, and I believe there's a few reasons for this (not the least is exposure and spread for reputation), and I think more horror developers should try to keep longer value for their titles.\n\nThe Silent Hill series did well for itself, and to note you're missing European and other sales as I know for a fact that Silent Hill 1 & 2 ended up selling over 1 million copies. That said, horror games are kind of weird that many don't actually go on to sale that much, not back in the day and they're still not the top sellers. Even some of the BIGGEST horror games of this day and age don't sell as much as you might expect, for example the first Five Nights at Freddy's game is still under 2 million sales despite it at this point even being in bundles and such.\n\nFatal Frame fairs even worse, I don't think a Fatal Frame game has ever exceeded 1 million sales, in Japan the sales are consistently around 30,000-70,000 through the whole franchise, and I can't imagine US sales are much better. And yet Fatal Frame games have kept being made to the point the series has 6 unique entries, one entire remake, and two enhanced ports.\n\nI think the real key here is that survival-horror games are not that expensive to make. Silent Hill 2's budget for example was estimated to be be $7-10 million, even if it was the maximum of $10 million they definitely did earn back more than they spent. I figure the Fatal Frame games must be really cheap to produce as well for them to keep on being made despite never really selling that great (and the short credits at the end of each FF title would definitely allude to this). Hell, even the RE series can be noted for this, REmake had a small team going by the credits and it is known that making REmake only took around 1.6 years. These games also back in the day did not take very long to be made either, Resident Evil 1-3 released over 3.5 years for example. Silent Hill 1-4 released over the course of 5 years as well.\n\nHorror is weird because more often it's talked and alluded about more than it actually sells through. Horror games have grown more popular in the internet age actually, and I don't think that's coincidence. And it's not coincidence a good number of the top 100 YouTubers made their name almost entirely through playing horror games. There's a lot of people who haven't or don't play the genre but are curious and enjoy watching them, horror games usually have a bigger focus on story, atmosphere, and moment-to-moment gameplay than most other genres, they're usually more involved watching than a lot of other genres due to this. It makes me a bit sad as a horror enthusiast, but it's definitely to be noted.\n\nResident Evil did some wise things to make its name so well known. Love or hate the live-action films, they definitely boosted Resident Evil's reputation and sales. Silent Hill did this to some extent, but Konami did not fully cash in on this and frankly the SH series marketing has always been worse than Resident Evil's. Add to this RE had an initial sales boost due to being one of the first 'scary' games (Clock Tower was Japan-only despite coming earlier is something to note). Resident Evil also came at a time where video games were starting to really grow and evolve, it was at the right place at the right time and the sequel RE2 was marketed and received well to make some fans for life. Both Resident Evil 1 & 2 were out (and RE2 out a whole year) before Silent Hill 1 even released.\n\nRE also compared to any other horror series keeps up consistent releases. and ends up in news cycles due to innovations. Something the RE series is really, really good at in its history is reinventing itself at the right moments.It has kept the ability to adapt and change. In hindights, Konami did a lot of unwise marketing moves for SH, but you have to keep in mind that the series started by mishaps in the company who Konami put on one last project they didn't aid at all (and actively hindered) and totally didn't expect it to succeed. Konami never treated the Silent Hill franchise well, and this extends to their marketing.\n\nI guess it's also worth mentioning that the first three Resident Evil games came out before/right when Silent Hill 1 came out. Silent Hill sold better than a lot of other horror game franchises though, so it's not just the 'psychological horror sells less' bullcrap. Resident Evil is a behemoth in the genre even compared to shlockier more action-stuff, and Silent Hill sells more than the rest of them as well even back in the day.\n\nThere's a lot more I could say, and probably will but this is starting to bloat and I want to post this and read replies I haven't seen (as I started writing this when there was only the OP post). I love, love, LOVE horror games, but many people need to learn later in life they like them. I think ResetEra shows many here don't really play horror games for example, just look at ResetEra Twitch Streams channel and among literal 100-200 streamers here on ResetEra, only about 4-5 of them (including me) list that they play horror games. Most people haven't really delved into horror games later in their life to uncover they like them, and I notice many people have the wrong impression of what horror games are about, IE you can tell who and who isn't a horror gamer by seeing what they think horror games are about. Most people who don't play them think it's all about scaring people, but anyone who actually plays a good number of them absolutely knows that's not what horror games are about. A game that scare you can be nice, but many of the best horror games aren't actually that scary in actuality and are beloved for other reasons. But I think it highlights part of why horror games are harder to market and their current sales cap; though this sales cap may increase in the next few years, because a lot of those teens who grew up watching people play horror games are becoming adults themselves."
