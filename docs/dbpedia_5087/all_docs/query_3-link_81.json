        "text": "2. STYLE  In the opening sequence of ‘Silent hill’, low-key lighting and dark colors were used to create a dark tone which connotes evil and death which is usual in horror movies.  Windy noises and high pitched string music were used when something scary/evil appeared/happened. It was used to build tension and create an element of enigma.  Long shots were used to show the setting and to emphasize how small the lady is compared to her location. It also emphasizes the danger and evil lurking around.  A fast dolly was used to frighten the audience because it was moving into a place which resembled hell. It was used to draw the audience into a new world.\n\n3. STYLE  In the opening sequence of ‘Evil dead’ close ups of the females neck, leg and blood dripping from her hand was used to create mystery because the audience doesn’t know where the bruises and the blood came from.  The grey and white rays of light created a cold and dull mood while the use of black around the trees and outer part of the frame connotes danger and evil  A Shallow focus was used to isolate the girl while she faced the villain which showed the evil surrounding her  The loud thud noise was used to surprise and scare the audience. It also represents the way evil lurks and surprises people\n\n4. COMPARISON Silent hill and Evil dead used low-key lighting dark black and dark colours to establish its horror genre because it has connotations involving evil, death and darkness. The windy sounds used were also something the films had in common and it gave the films the same eerie mood horror films are supposed to create. Evil dead used close ups and loud thuds to create mystery while Silent hill used high pitched string instruments to build tension and create an element of enigma. Silent hill used a fast dolly to show the difference in worlds while a shallow focus was used to show the difference in character.\n\n5. NARRATIVE AND PLOT Silent Hill: The film follows Rose, who takes her adopted daughter Sharon to the town of Silent Hill, for which Sharon cries while sleepwalking. Arriving at Silent Hill, Rose is involved in a car accident and awakens to find Sharon missing; while searching for her daughter, she fights a local cult while uncovering Sharon's connection to the town's past. This is plot usually used for horror movies because it involves the unravelling of secrets with hidden or unknown links and ties with the main character. The use of a cult is to make the film more deadly and scary because cultists aren’t something people wish to come across. Films with a similar plot with silent hill are: The ring and The exorcist\n\n6. NARRATIVE AND PLOT Evil Dead: Five friends head to a remote cabin, where the discovery of a Book of the Dead leads them to unwittingly summon up demons living in the nearby woods. The evil presence possesses them until only one is left to fight for survival.

Films with a similar plot to Evil dead are The cabin in the wood and Drag me to hell.\n\n7. SETTINGS  Silent hill used a suburban house as its first location to establish that the people are ordinary. This is done to scare the audience more because the weird things happened in their house.  It also used a forest as another location which is normally seen in horror movies because they are isolated, dark and dangerous which connotes evil.  They used a cliff and waterfall to show the distance between life/earth and death/hell.\n\n8. SETTINGS  Evil dead used a forest as its location in the opening scene which was used to connote evil and darkness. It was also used to show the amount of evil around because it was a big forest.\n\n9. THEMES Common themes in horror movies are:  Revenge  Justice  Good versus Evil\n\n10. CHARACTERS Silent hill introduced a mother, father, child and demonic a demonic child in the opening sequence.  The mother, father and child was used to show the normality of the victims. The fact that it was a little child that was the main victim shows how evil has no limits and can come after anybody.  The demonic baby was introduced to show that the victim and the villain were of the same age.\n\n11. CHARACTERS Evil dead introduced a female as the victim and two men as the villains into their opening sequence  The female was used because females are stereotypically more vulnerable compared to men so it would be easier to harm a girl because she is less likely win a fight.  The two men were introduced because they are usually the bad guys in horror movies"
