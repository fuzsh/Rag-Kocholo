        "text": "Early horror video games are full of cheesy experiences, embracing the gore and violent elements found in slasher flicks. In their camp appeal, these earlier games lacked the depth to convey a sense of fright or emotion. While many may look to Resident Evil as a big jump in horror gaming, the genre would forever be changed by Silent Hill.\n\nIt was 20 years ago back in 1999 that Silent Hill made its debut on the PlayStation, introducing gamers to a whole new level of horror.\n\nThe action-survival title changed the industry in its emphasis on storytelling, weaving in puzzle solving and more dramatic elements to differentiate itself from other games. Given the game’s approach to atmosphere and narrative, along with the innovative use of mechanics, many of today’s popular horror titles owe thanks to the groundwork laid down by Silent Hill.\n\nToday we look back on a horror classic; we will tread through the ashes, wandering along the streets of the nightmarish Silent Hill.\n\nA Story of Ghosts and Fear\n\nThe team behind Silent Hill, Team Silent, wanted to step away from the B-horror movie elements found in previous games. Taking on a more “Hollywood” approach, the team found inspiration in UFOs, the occult, and David Lynch films. Focusing on the “fear of the unknown,” it was decided that Silent Hill would take on a psychological horror approach.\n\nAs the player, you control Harry Mason, who arrives at the titular town searching for his young daughter Cheryl. As he wanders he comes into contact with a variety of characters; from police officer Cybil Bennet to the fortune telling cultist Dahlia Gillespie, the cast of Silent Hill all contribute to its brilliant atmosphere and grim story. Harry eventually discovers the underlying occult plan at work, attempting to save his daughter’s life from eternal suffering.\n\nCompared to other popular video game protagonists, Harry stands out like a sore thumb; rather than be some solider, Harry is just a regular guy. Playing as someone with no combat training brings an extra sense of tension to the gameplay; unlike some powered up being, Harry can’t take a lot of damage; he also can’t handle heavy weaponry. Due to this, players have to be careful where they go, conserving gun ammo and running away from enemies when possible.\n\nEven after 20 years the dialogue and cinematic cutscenes still have an eerie chill. Who can forget about nurse Lisa and the sequence where blood is pouring down her face? Against the shadowy background of the scene, she stumbles towards you, calling out for help. That moment still brings out the goosebumps on my arms.\n\nThe horror of Silent Hill is one of feeling; even though there are monsters and physical violence, the game goes into the psychological and spiritual to keep players in a state of unknown. With little context to help guide you from objective to objective, the game leaves the player alone to solve each puzzle that comes their way. This gameplay makes for a more intimate experience of isolation, for the characters you come across bring little comfort in such a hopeless place. Together, the story and mechanics make Silent Hill a work of art that breathes dread, uncertainty, and madness.\n\nThe Horror of Design\n\nThe world of Silent Hill is depressing; beyond the human characters you’ll come into contact with from time to time, the town is a lonely hell hole. From bland streets to decrepit buildings and thick fog, Silent Hill does a tremendous job making you feel alone. The grotesque, disfigured creatures only add to this misery. Silent Hill‘s monsters are that of pure nightmares. From horrific creatures that look like demon children to giant insects and bat-like creatures, the game’s collection of monsters is as upsetting to look at as they are interesting.\n\nOne of the more fascinating elements while playing Silent Hill is that of the fog; for in the fog’s immensity, it represents two essential factors of the game. In one regard, the fog helps to establish the emotional tone of Silent Hill. The bland blobs of gray exude dread, cloaking the abandoned buildings and streets. Then there’s the technical purpose behind the fog, specifically how the developers implemented it to maintain a consistent framerate while playing. The player is only able to see so far beyond the fog, having to move forward to see what lies past it. This fog allowed the developers to have the game run smoothly on the PlayStation, utilizing all its graphical power. On an interesting note, the limitations of the PlayStation would end up aiding Silent Hill’s visual presentation; due to pushing the game’s look, Silent Hill has a lot of grainy textures. These textures actually made the look of the game and its surroundings more unsettling to look at, adding to the psychological discomfort. The graphical power is what would also allow for the more personal, fully flesh out cutscenes (further pushing the medium of video game storytelling).\n\nGoing back to the emotional factors of the game, Silent Hill is one of the predecessors of cinematic gaming. Along with its visual design is that of its score and sound design; your footsteps echo off the pavement as you run up and down streets, the cries of monsters in the distance. The score is mesmerizing in its hauntingly somber appeal. Beautiful guitar chords bring out melancholy vibes, with dissonant drones layering on a tense thickness.\n\nConsidering all of this, along with the game’s story, Silent Hill is one of the first significant examples of how games can work as slow-burn emotional experiences. Like an atmospheric film or record, Silent Hill’s journey also allows room for introspection; players can both enjoy playing the game for the narrative it offers, all while finding something deeper to absorb. With the game embodying such elements as loneliness, isolation, and exuding depressive tones, the player can take on a mindful experience of playing something that can connect on a human level.\n\nA World of Nightmares Come To Life\n\nSilent Hill is one of the most important video games in history (for both the horror genre and game industry as a whole). While the series would go on to have its ups and downs, the first installment initiated a new direction for gaming; this path would open the minds of developers all around the world, unlocking the potential for new and innovative ways of telling stories.\n\nIt also goes to say that Silent Hill was one of the first genuinely emotional horror experiences; forgoing the campy traits previous horror games had before its release, Silent Hill is a work of art that has more too express than scares. Its story is one that crawls under the skin and slowly digs inward, creating a pocket of dread and coldness. Silent Hill was and is an elevating experience for video games, proving how the medium can present rich stories.\n\nIn all of Silent Hill’s achievements, one of its greatest qualities is how its experience can linger on a player long after finishing. The haunting music nestles within one’s eardrums; the shadows tucked into the corners of their mind, sprawled and breathing unease. As one closes their eyes going to sleep, it’s the darkness of Silent Hill that weighs on them, beckoning back to tread the ghostly town.\n\n‘Alien: Romulus’ is right around the corner, so it’s the perfect time to check out ‘Lily C.A.T.,’ an anime body horror classic that’s a gory tribute to ‘Alien’ and ‘The Thing’.\n\n“Confine them? We’re on a ship. We’re practically confined ourselves.”\n\nRidley Scott’s Alien is an iconic horror/science fiction hybrid that’s had its ups and downs as a film franchise, but remains an essential genre film 45 years later. Alien is such a tried and true property with limitless potential that it’s kind of remarkable that there hasn’t been an Alien animated series or in-universe anime that’s in the vein of The Animatrix that translates this iconic sci-fi horror property into animated madness where it can really let loose and not be confined by live-action’s limitations. An unreleased Alien vs. Predator anime is the closest thing that audiences have gotten to this, which is actually fully mixed and completed as of 2016.\n\nDisney is currently just sitting on the finished product as of its acquisition of 20th Century Fox and it’s unclear if they’re ever going to do anything with it at this point. There are so many horror films that try to make waves by being “Alien, but on a ….,” or “It’s like The Thing, only it’s set in a …” These copycat horror films understandably have mixed results. For every Life, Event Horizon, Contamination, and Galaxy of Terror, there’s an Inseminoid, Xtro II: The Second Encounter, and Critters 4. Somehow, one of the smartest Alien rip-offs is an ‘80s anime that mashes the Ridley Scott film together with another revered science fiction creature feature classic.\n\nLily C.A.T. an anime OVA – original video animation that’s akin to a direct-to-video movie – from 1987 that’s basically Alien meets The Thing. A bunch of astronauts awake from cryo-sleep and learn that a shapeshifting monster is taking them out, one-by-one, with little means of recourse. Over time, the crew learns that The Syncam Corporation, the company who is behind their mission, has betrayed them and set them up for failure, just like Ripley and her team in Alien. Lily C.A.T. is a rewarding sci-fi/horror anime that’s heavily inspired by Alien, but proves to be so much more. Fede Álvarez’s Alien: Romulus is set to revolutionize the flailing film franchise, along with Noah Hawley’s upcoming Alien: Earth FX series.\n\nThat being said, Lily C.A.T. is the Alien reimagining that you didn’t know you needed.\n\nLily C.A.T. is a unique property who was directed by Hisayuki Toriumi, who previously did extensive directing on Gatchaman, 1979’s Ultraman, and Battle of the Planets. Lily C.A.T.’s writer, Hiroyuki Hoshiyama, also cut his teeth writing for many mecha and giant robot series, such as Blue Comet SPT Layzner, Transformers: Super-God Masterforce, Patlabor, Future GPX Cyber Formula, and Turn A Gundam, not to mention all ten episodes of the Dirty Pair OVA. Toriumi and Hoshiyama’s mecha experience feels evident in Lily C.A.T., even if there are no giant robots present in the OVA. Their past experience is expressed through Lily C.A.T.’s grungy cyberpunk aesthetic and 23rd century setting. There are several shots and examples of technology on the central ship, Saldes, that feel like direct homages to Carpenter and Scott’s early film oeuvre. Additionally, the OVA’s monster designs come from Yoshitaka Amano, who may be no H.R. Giger, Stan Winston, or Rob Bottin, but he’s someone who’s established an impressive reputation and is best known for his artwork in Vampire Hunter D and the Final Fantasy games.\n\nLily C.A.T. has become more obscure in recent years, but it did have an English dub that was produced by Carl Macek and distributed by Streamline Pictures, who were a major player in the dubbing industry during the late ’80s and ’90s, handling Robotech, Macross, and some of the decade’s biggest dub releases like My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki’s Delivery Service, Akira, and Fist of the North Star. Lily C.A.T. was a notorious VHS release during the ’90s and became a bigger cult classic through its prominent airing on the Sci-Fi Channel Saturday Anime block. It was finally released on DVD in 2014, where an official Japanese with English subtitles version was available for the first time. Unfortunately, the DVD is now out of print and it’s since become a rare, expensive collector’s item (the VHS alone sells for anywhere between $40 and $90 on eBay), which is a testament to the ’80s OVA’s reputation and staying power.\n\nLily C.A.T. quickly stands out through its inspired editing that keeps its central mystery alive, the tension taught, and the audience on the edge of their seats. There’s such a tight story that immediately gets moving and essentially has zero filler because of the OVA’s relatively short runtime. This tight, well-paced narrative is complemented by graphic kills and ridiculous transformation sequences. The first transformation scene is a gory, bloody spectacle that genuinely catches the audience by surprise. Biological viscera mingles with extraterrestrial acids so that the whole display feels truly otherworldly in nature. A cat’s ribs separate and explode as it’s turned into some surreal, monstrous hand puppet that’s immediately evocative of the dog’s transformation sequence in The Thing. Lily C.A.T. only gets more outrageous as it moves forward. Organs splatter and paint the ship’s interior like biological fireworks. The subsequent transformation sequences are even more disturbing and gruesome. There’s a truly gonzo moment when one of the crew members flamethrowers a cat until it’s willed into submission, only for the feline’s face to peel off and reveal its robotic insides. It’s such a gloriously anime visual that in many ways is even more extreme and over the top than anything that’s in the original Alien.\n\nThe threat of a biological virus that spreads through the Saldes ship intensifies its terror through evocative shots of tight, sterile corridors that are dense in steam, shadow, and danger. Lily C.A.T. is careful to not overextend itself and it understands the value in how less can be more. This makes it all the more unfortunate that this effective title has slipped through the cracks and remains relatively obscure and unknown, despite it absolutely nailing what it’s going for. It’s one of the most genuinely unnerving anime movies and OVAs to come out of the ‘80s, which was a decade that was absolutely rampant with ultra-violent body horror content, like Wicked City and Demon City Shinjuku.\n\nLily C.A.T. is so much better for saying what it has to in a concise 67 minutes, instead of being drawn out into a longer movie with an unnecessary extra act. It’s easy to picture a modern adaptation of Lily C.A.T. that’s told as a limited series. A longer, serialized venture of this nature could potentially work, especially if it were to put an even greater focus on its characters, but a Lily C.A.T. series runs the risk of ruining the OVA’s magic and wrecking the tension that’s effectively created in this tight production. It’s for the best that Lily C.A.T. is what it is – and that it’s not even adapted from manga source material – rather than being one piece of a greater whole.\n\nIn fact, director Toriumi, had been vocal about his desire to create an anime version of the popular “bakeneko” subgenre of horror films that focus on yokai/demon cats – who often have shapeshifting abilities – and the terrors that surround them. A cat, Jonesy, is of course central to Alien and another way in which Alien and Lily C.A.T. are alike (and The Thing builds a major centerpiece out of its shapeshifting dog). It’s curious to note that Lily C.A.T.’s whole concept came out of a desire to riff on the bakeneko subgenre, rather than an attempt to reverse-engineer Alien elements.\n\nProductions like Lily C.A.T., Alien, and The Thing often live or die based on their cast of characters and how successfully they connect with viewers. Lily C.A.T. introduces a varied group of archetypal figures on the Saldes who almost feel like they’re ripped out of Street Fighter. They’re appropriate types of cannon fodder for a story of this nature. One of Lily C.A.T.’s greatest joys is how this cast quickly grows on the viewer and how easy it is to actively root for them by the film’s final act. Lily C.A.T. makes you genuinely care for these characters, even if they may initially come across as one-dimensional, and this helps the film really stick the landing with its ending. It’s all-too easy for Alien and Thing copycats to have disposable characters who are of little consequence when they finally bite the dust. Every death in Lily C.A.T. hits hard and the film’s ending is reminiscent of Ripley and Newt’s triumphant escape during Aliens’ finale.\n\nIn addition to the shapeshifting terror that threatens Saldes’ crew, Lily C.A.T. also explores the idea that two people on the ship may be imposters, specifically “time escapees.” These are individuals who commit crimes, sneak on a ship, use its cryosleep to get away for 40-60 years, only to return to Earth where they’re now able to operate freely because no one remembers what they did half-a-century ago. It’s actually a really creative concept and the type of idea that you’d find in the best works of Philip K. Dick or Isaac Asimov. This beautifully illustrates how criminals can take advantage of technological advancements for their own selfish gains.\n\nLily C.A.T. could simply coast on ghoulish visuals and grisly murders alone, but there’s some deeper material in play as Saldes’ crew ruminate on the inherent loneliness of their work. Their mission rips them from their lives and turns them into missing pieces of a puzzle that they no longer fit into anymore. It’s appreciated that Lily C.A.T. explores these heavier questions and the mental toll that all this puts on its characters, even before they’re exposed to this shapeshifting, murderous bacteria. Lily C.A.T. isn’t nearly as deep as Alien and is limited by its length, but it does attempt to get in its cast’s head in a slightly more invasive manner than Ridley Scott’s film.\n\nLily C.A.T. concludes with an epic finale that’s on par with Alien, yet it’s even more daring and graceful in some respects. The characters are prepared to sacrifice themselves for the greater good so that the Saldes doesn’t return to Earth with this deadly bacteria in tow and liable to contaminate the entire planet. There are some brutal moments where the crew contemplate their ends and taking the easy way out instead of confronting the horrors of this monster. Ultimately, they rise to the occasion and consider a more noble end. During the film’s final moments of success, a melancholy Jiro prompts a question to Nancy: “Do you think the beautiful butterfly finds it repulsive that it was once a caterpillar?” It’s a poetic query that encapsulates the philosophical tug of war that’s in play in Lily C.A.T. and it casts the heroes’ victory in a darker, uncomfortable light. It’s a powerful, thought-provoking conclusion that beats out many modern science fiction and horror stories – anime or otherwise.\n\nMore than 35 years later, Lily C.A.T. is still an extremely satisfying companion piece to Alien: Romulus that should be added to everyone’s Alien binge list before they check out the new film.\n\n‘Lily C.A.T.’ is currently available to stream for free on The Roku Channel."
