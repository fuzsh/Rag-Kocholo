        "text": "It’s still the dog days of summer, but already people are looking to the fall. With the colder months comes not only Halloween but also a new sort of setting perfect for watching horror movies. With the punishing wind whipping chill into the air outside, and the crisp leaves keeping fireplaces ablaze and blankets at the ready, the fall is just right for inviting fear into your home and snuggling up with something spooky.\n\nFortunately for indie movie fans, there are dozens of low-budget chillers (and in the case of Luca Guadagnino’s “Suspiria,” not-so-low-budget thrillers) waiting to be streamed on Netflix, Hulu, Max, Peacock, AMC+, Showtime, Shudder, Amazon Prime Video, and a variety of other streaming platforms right now. From contemporary horror classics (see Robert Eggers’ “The Witch” or Bryan Bertino’s “The Strangers”) to beloved horror anthologies (“Southbound,” “Tales From Halloween”) and non-English language movies (“Train to Busan,” “Piggy”), the major streaming platforms offer no shortage of great indie horror movies.\n\nThe best indie horror movies are the ones that totally envelop viewers in their nightmarish fantasies while impressing cinephiles with their bold vision, original stories, and commitment to craft. Practically synonymous with indie horror, A24 makes a sizable contribution to this list with the aforementioned Anya-Taylor Joy starring “The Witch” appearing alongside Rose Glass’ “Saint Maud” and Ti West’s “X” and “Pearl,” as well as Ari Aster’s “Hereditary” and “Midsommar.” Other studios — chiefly, Neon — also appear with some frequency on this list. But so do one-off projects championed by individual auteurs, from Adrian Tofei’s “Be My Cat: A Film for Anne” to Damien Leone’s gleefully gory “Terrifier.”\n\nWhether you’re interested in watching an indie horror favorite or want to take a chance on something new, use IndieWire’s streaming guide below to find the best frights streaming in summer and fall 2024. The following films are listed in no particular order and represent 50 of the best (critical distinction!) indie horror movies currently streaming. Also check out IndieWire’s complete guide to the best horror movies ever made.\n\nWith editorial contributions by Alison Foreman, Ryan Lattanzio, and Kate Erbland.\n\n[Editor’s note: This list was published in October 2019 and has been updated multiple times since.]"
