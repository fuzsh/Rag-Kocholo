        "text": "I'm genuinely curious. I haven't watched many horror movies, especially one that tick as much horror trope boxes as possible because I find that lazy and boring.\n\nI watched both movies and thought they were totally stupid, Babadook especially. They both have a few good, scary scenes and ideas, but all in all, they completely don't deserve the hype and praise in my opinion.\n\nBut, considering how hard it is to find a good horror movie that's not a jump-scare-fest or gore porn, maybe horror lovers are starving for some alternatives and are easily satisfied.\n\nI also recently watched The Blairwitch Project for the first time and let me tell ya, now that's a good, atmospheric horror movie that doesn't rely on chip tricks for scares. (although, that's maybe the one good thing I can say for Baba and Follows too, for the most part). I do like that they try and focus on the psychological horror in a somewhat interesting way.\n\nI find the psychological aspects of horror to be more appealing and interesting, so sometimes psychological thrillers fill that horror spot a lot better, something like Hannibal or The Shining...\n\nI'm also recording a Let's Play of Outlast (the only way I could force myself to play a horror game is to record it and have a semi obligation to do it regularly), but after I got used to the shock and got over my initial fear it's just a cheap lasagna of jump scares and gore... The interactivity certainly helps.\n\nI also played through SOMA and that game was excellent! The psychological horror of the ideas between robots and humans and consciousness was amazing! (not a fan of the few drown out segments with the monster hide and seek tho)\n\nI think I'll try Goodnight Mommy movie next, and if I don't like that, maybe horror is just not for me.\n\nSo, with all that being said, can you explain to me why you did or didn't like those 2 movies, and recommend some others to me, video games too? I really didn't watch many horror movies or played a bunch of horror games, so it shouldn't be to hard to recommend some good ones.\n\nI only watched The Babadook. I didn't think it was scary at all - there was only one scene in the movie that even came close to spooking me (the first scene where they're flipping through the book). There are certain parts of the movie that just felt disjointed or sort of needless and didn't really add anything to the story as a whole. For example, there's a male character that's prominent in the first half of the movie but vanishes in the second half with no real explanation why. Some scenes went overboard with the horror cliches in a way that made me laugh. For example, the flickering lightbulbs and the creaking floorboards at night - who the fuck is honestly scared by that any more? It came across as lazy more than anything. The main actress was great at portraying a dishevelled and frustrated single mother, but when it came to \"okay, act scared/cry/scream\", I wasn't buying it. The little kid put on the most convincing acting in the entire movie, I thought it was an excellent performance.\n\nI appreciate that the movie attempted to comment on mental illness and grieving. I actually felt that I was the target demographic of this movie, considering I was raised in a household that has had to deal with those exact issues. That being said, nothing about this movie was moving at all. The only significant thought lingering around in my mind after watching the movie was \"great, this seems like a good movie to show 15 year olds so they can write a paper about it in English class because the themes and symbols are so obvious and easy to write a paper about\".\n\n@sravankb: You're assuming in the term 'horror movie' that the audience is always the one supposed to be scared. You wouldn't watch a romance and complain that you didn't fall in love. Horror films use fear as a means to convey a theme. Often times that fear is uncomfortable for the audience as well as the characters in the film, but that's entirely subjective. Nobody is wrong for being scared while watching It Follows, just as It Follows isn't less of a horror film because I didn't jump out of my seat.\n\nI digress.\n\nIt Follows was well liked largely because it is aesthetically very well done. It's a small film that broke out of art theaters and entered the mainstream consciousness. I think people like to like that movie. It looks and sounds good. It's interesting that it approaches teen sexuality in a way that's a little more complex than \"stab kids having sex.\" A little. I also think this film has a lot of problems with muddling its themes between sexually transmitted disease, sexual positivity, and romantic/physical attachment. There are times when it cares less about what it is saying than it does its slick aesthetic. It's an interesting movie, and fun to talk about, but I have my reservations.\n\nThe Babadook is pretty slavish to its theme of grief, right down to the way the monster behaves: Babadook never leaves, you just learn to live with it. I think horror audiences appreciate a film that intelligently conveys its message. So often that stuff gets muddled while trying to achieve an aesthetic, or cool kill, or just making a monster somebody wants to dress up as on Halloween. The Babadook isn't entirely innocent here, there are a few things that I don't know contribute at all to the greater narrative (the moment they show the monster felt out of place, the stuff with the dog doesn't make much sense to me), but for the most part it seems well constructed.\n\nAs someone who liked both Babadook and It Follows, and really dislikes Blairwitch... I'm not sure I can make any recommendations you'll like.\n\nBabadook deals with the tragedy and terror of mental illness. While It Follows is a new twist on the old teens-having-sex-and-getting-murdered trope. I think both are well liked because they are slightly different takes on old ideas. It doesn't hurt that they are well made movies either. Despite being smaller budgeted films they have good acting and slick production values. They don't fit into the typical gore-a-thons either and for me that's a plus. I always found gore to be a cheap trick in horror movies. Guts aren't scary... just gross.\n\nI don't really think that all horror movies have to be a jump-scare fest either. Suspenseful thrillers with supernatural elements can easily fit into that genre as well. Horror is a pretty broad stroke to be fair. Honestly, I don't find many movies or games to be scary. If some form of media can leave me feeling somewhat unsettled then I feel like it did the job, but that's about as far as it goes these days. After watching Pet Cemetery and Poltergeist as a kid, the horror bar is set pretty high. The Shining is also an example of a great horror movie that I didn't find scary as much as disturbing. Especially if you read up on some of the hidden themes in the film that Kubrick worked in.\n\nMixed Feelings on the Babadook, did not really like how the story went and the conclusion is weird. Definitely scary at times though, although i'm talking less about the few genuinely good horror scenes and more about the adult kinds of fears it evoked in me like being the parent of an unlikeable noisy troublemaker or going crazy when stressed beyond the point of exhaustion.\n\nIt Follows was a great callback to 70ies 80ies Horror that was mostly beautifully shot and scored. Story was alright, and conceptually more creepy than scary.\n\nAs for geniunely smart and/or scary horror movies....hmm.\n\n[REC] isn't really smart, and in a way somewhat predictable, but it uses the Found Footage format (of which i'm personally fan of, even though i easily admit it's a subgenre where like 95% percent of it all is really bad) to great effect and has really great timing and setups. I should be \"to cool\" for it, but i find it genuinely scary. (As for Found Footage, also check out V/H/S 1 + 2, anthology movies i initially had a bit of issue with due to being at times very very amateurish, but grown on me eventually for having some smart subversions in thier stories and a connecting theme per whole movie that lift the sums of thier parts into something more interesting that has interesting views on the genre as a whole. Stay away from V/H/S 3 though.)\n\nAlso, Alien (the first one, always the first one) is one of my all time favorite movies due to the (probably more than then now) more grounded take on a future with space flight and above all its intense atmosphere and designs.\n\n(And talking about atmosphere, another one of my all time favorite movies is the 80ies Remake of the Thing, it can be a bit goofy at times, but the concept, the isolated setting and a John Carpenter score at its very best make this an absolute must watch.)\n\nAs for scary and smart, i really find the remake of the Fly a great source. It does not get you alot with jumpscares, and it's gross out factor is beyond intense, but there is something about the inevitability and gradual about what happens in the movie and how it is shown (both from the side of the Afflicted and his partner) that is pretty scary in a surprisingly relatable way.\n\nAnother great movie in that regard is Marebito, although i guess i should warn that the movie has some imagery of a...let's say sexual nature that is the wrong kind of creepy and may be a turn off for some. Yet, it's somewhat rambly narrative and the mixture between very sober imagery mixed with short moments that go into the surreal got under my skin HARD.\n\nEDIT: That said, i really really don't like Blair Witch Project, even though it is one of the originators of the Found Footage genre as is (yea, i know it's preceded by some things, decades ago when taking Cannibal Holocaust into the mix, but you know). I thought it was kind of stupid and annoying since outside of the admittedly well made ending, it leaned too hard on dumb decision making and over-the-top hysteria for me. But well, to each thier own.\n\nwell, it doesn't sound like you don't get why ppl like em, you just didn't like em yourself that much right? hype is always a dangerous thing to go into anything with so it could have played a part. i saw these right when they were released, i would say, before the hype reach its peak and i really liked both, especially It Follows.\n\nThe Babadook was the director's (Jennifer Kent) first feature and It Follows was only the director's (David Robert Mitchell) second and they were both incredibly confident and well constructed films that easily worked on multiple levels. They were also tiny movies, budgets estimating at only $2 million for each film (which is ridiculously low). The independent scene gets excited about young new filmmakers with obvious talent and exceptional potential. The thing is, these are small movies for niche audiences but the internet blows any hype out of proportion and a lot ppl come out disappointed because there aren't really meant for the general movie goers. the more you're into films, the more you'll appreciate these movies because you're judging aspects of films that most ppl either don't care or don't notice.\n\nIt sounds like what you want and you're expectations of what a horror movie is or should be is fairly narrow and these didn't land where you want them to.\n\nThis is not a horror movie but maybe check out The Gift which came out this year. It's mostly considered a thriller or mystery but it works also as a psychological horror.\n\nI actually didn't know that both movies were so hyped and well-liked to the point where someone would say that either is overrated. Anyway, I saw both within one week. Personally, I liked and enjoyed It Follows, but was disappointed by The Babadook. I'm not a big fan of horror movies and I didn't watch either of them for the scares, and as such, I wasn't upset to find out that neither of them was particularly terrifying. Although, I found some of the early parts of The Babadook to be somewhat disturbing.\n\nI liked It Follows because it uses and subverts horror genre tropes in unique ways. For example, I think not explaining the nature of \"it\" was a good decision. Also, somehow the movie resonated with me to some extent, mainly due to the the themes it explores. As for The Babadook, I thought the first half was promising, but I hated the back half when it devolved into a rather cliched symbolic struggle against grief. Also, bear in mind that unlike the majority of mainstream horror movies these days, It Follows and The Babadook were reasonably well-written and directed.\n\nEdit: If you're up for a slightly different type of horror, I recommend watching Under the Skin, directed by Jonathan Glazer and starring Scarlett Johansson, who gives a great performance by the way. It's an arthouse sci-fi horror. It doesn't rely on jump scares (or any types of scare for that matter), but I found it be haunting, and I remember one scene being deeply unsettling. The movie is visually stunning and has a fantastic score.\n\nI liked Babadook because it went in a totally different direction than what I was expecting, and the titular creature was fun to watch do its thing. I mean, it's not Oscar material by any means, but it was enjoyable and creative. Plus it was the director's first feature, which is always worth keeping in mind.\n\nIt Follows, on the other hand... it had some cool ideas, but I couldn't take the \"sexually transmitted ghost\" plot seriously. I still giggle every time I type \"sexually transmitted ghost\". That movie just did nothing for me.\n\nThe thing about horror is that it's an incredibly wide genre. If you're looking to dip your toes into it and find your niche, try Patrick's list over at Kotaku. It's not perfect, but it's a good primer that covers a decent percentage of horror subgenres.\n\nGoing by what you listed as liking, I'd suggest Lake Mungo, The Innkeepers, slow burn ghost stories like those. (and don't let Goodnight Mommy be your \"horror enjoyment test\". It's not what the trailers make it out to be. It's a horror movie, but barely)\n\nI always get frustrated at the \"I didn't like it because it wasn't scary\" argument. That completely undermines what horror movies can do, and have been doing for many many years. The genre isn't called \"scary movies,\" it's called \"horror.\" Horror movies are meant to be horrific.\n\nThe Babadook explores ideas of grief, loss, and depression in disturbing, grotesque ways. Is that not horrific to you? Now, you can go on about the craftsmanship or say \"the ideas weren't conveyed well\" and that's totally fair so long as you explain your point. I also really don't get the \"the kid was annoying\" argument. That's the point. Without that, the movie doesn't work.\n\nAs for It Follows, that movie is clearly a throwback to 70s or 80s horror movies complete with a synth soundtrack. THIS is the one where the craftsmanship really shines and I'd have to strongly disagree and argue with anyone who says otherwise. The directing and cinematography in It Follows is absolutely masterful.\n\nand for the record, I wasn't all that scared by these movies. The Babadook had me on the edge of my seat and tensed up a few times but I've seen much scarier. It Follows was more a creepy trance. This brings me back to the bottom line though:\n\nHorror movies do not and never have to necessarily be that scary"
