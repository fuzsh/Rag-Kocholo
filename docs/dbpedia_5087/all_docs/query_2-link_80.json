        "text": "If there is anyone I would want to choose what movies I watch this Halloween weekend (besides Stephen King or Wes Craven), I'd want it to be Oscar winning director Martin Scorsese. He's a genius filmmaker and I'm sure he knows great horror when he sees it. I think this would've been much better coordinated if his new movie Shutter Island was actually out in theaters (damn you Paramount), but either way this is a great list. The Daily Beast asked Scorsese to choose some horror movies for Halloween and he came up with his own list of the 11 Scariest Horror Movies of All Time. Read on to see what great classics he chose!\n\n1. The Haunting (Robert Wise, 1963)\n\n2. Isle of the Dead (Mark Robson, 1945)\n\n3. The Uninvited (Lewis Allen, 1944)\n\n4. The Entity (Sidney J. Furie, 1981)\n\n5. Dead of Night (Alberto Cavalcanti, 1945)\n\n6. The Changeling (Peter Medak, 1980)\n\n7. The Shining (Stanley Kubrick, 1980)\n\n8. The Exorcist (William Friedkin, 1973)\n\n9. Night of the Demon (Jacques Tourneur, 1957)\n\n10. The Innocents (Jack Clayton, 1961)\n\n11. Psycho (Alfred Hitchcock, 1960)\n\nScorsese provides a brief bit of commentary on each of them over on The Daily Beast. He mainly mentions, for most of them, that it's not about what you see, but what you don't see. For example, his thoughts on The Shining: \"I never read the Stephen King novel, I have no idea how faithful it is or isn't, but Kubrick made a majestically terrifying movie, where what you don't see or comprehend shadows every move the characters make.\" For anyone that saw Paranormal Activity, that was why that movie was so scary. I hope this has given you some good ideas for great films to watch, whether it be for Halloween this weekend, or anytime."
