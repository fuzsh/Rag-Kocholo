        "text": "Look, I know that on the surface this doesn’t look like a horror game but trust me when I say this, looks can be very deceiving, and if you have not played Doki Doki Literature Club then I suggest that you turn away because this analysis contains spoilers.\n\nDoki Doki Literature Club is a game that came out for free on Steam in September of 2017 and took the internet by storm. So many YouTube Let’s Players were asked countless times by their fans to play this game and they were confused about why it was such a popular demand. On the surface, it looked like another dating simulator visual novel where the objective is to win the affection of one of the cute girls, but if you pay very close attention, you’ll see that the game is in the genre of psychological horror, and before the main menu appears, there is a warning that this game is not suitable for children and people who are easily disturb.\n\nIt sparked some controversy when it appeared on BBC News in the UK stating that this game is a risk to children and young people who are emotionally vulnerable. Accusing the game to be aiming towards kids because of its cutesy art style while showing violent imagery of the characters harming themselves. This commotion was caused by a father blaming the game for the suicide of his 15-year-old son which became a bit of hot topic in the news media spreading the awareness of the game’s content to parents.\n\nDespite the controversies, Doki Doki Literature Club became a cult classic. It was downloaded over 2 million times around the time it came out, and won awards for Most Innovative, Best Story, Best PC Game, and Best Adventure Game from People’s Choice IGN Awards 2018.\n\nDoki Doki is Japanese for the sound of a heart beating which is associated with romance and horror, and in some ways, the game tells a tragic horrifying love story. One of the things that makes the game unique is that you’re not playing a faceless protagonist, but instead, you are the protagonist. You are the main character of the story, and Doki Doki Literature Club is kind of your own personal episode of Black Mirror.\n\nSo, what is a visual novel? Well, it is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a novel with visuals. You read text along with illustrations. Don’t confuse it with graphic novels because the difference between the two is that graphic novels are physical books that can tell one constructive story while visuals novels are purely digital and has a combination of gameplay that can branch its story to multiple paths that can lead to different outcomes.\n\nVisual novels started out as text adventure games back in the late 1970s in Untied States. In those games, you interact with the story through words. The game would tell you where you are and what’s happening, and you had to type a basic command. Very much like Dungeons and Dragons. The games inspired Yuji Horii (the creator of Dragon Quest) to create his own text adventure game, but with visuals, and introducing it to Japanese audiences, he ended up creating what most otakus considered it to be one of the first visual novels of its kind, and that was The Portopia Serial Murder Case. Released on the Famicon (Japanese version of the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System)) in 1985, it’s a first-person point of view game where you can play as a detective solving a murder mystery and have to gather clues by interacting with the characters with a series of questions.\n\nThe game did pretty well, selling over 700 thousand copies and followed by imitators that made their own adventure games, but it wasn’t until the 1990s when a gaming studio called Leaf define visual novels with their games that putted more emphasis on visuals. Games like Shizuku and Kizuato which were horror mysteries. One of the games they made gained major popularity, it was called To Heart. It was a high school romantic comedy, and the objective was to win the love and affection of one of the girls.\n\nVisual novels were only exclusive to Japan for a long period of time, and while some of them did manage to come over to the west like Hideo Kojima’s cyberpunk detective noir Snatcher for the Sega CD, it wasn’t until the late 2000s and early 2010s that visual novels were starting to get attention in this side of the planet. Since the anime community in the United States has become larger since the 1990s, there was a demand for visual novels to be brought over. Japanese video game developers and publishers saw a new potential market and started bringing them over and since then, visual novels became this sort of odd medium in the gaming community.\n\nIt’s safe to say that this type of game is not for everybody. Visual novels are a different form of action-adventure role playing games, but certainly not like Final Fantasy. In the majority of the time, you just read texts which is understandable why it can turn some people off.\n\nAs I mentioned before, Doki Doki Literature Club is kind of your personal episode of Black Mirror, and the reason I said that is because in that show the main characters get into some kind of trouble when they interact with a device that creates a blur between realities. The show warns the viewer about the dangers of advance technology and how technology can bring out the worst parts of humanity. It’s not saying that technology is bad, but it shows the consequences when it’s used irresponsibly. Doki Doki Literature Club on the other hand is not about the dangers of technology, but more about being a satire of visual novels and anime tropes. Since this game is a satire of visual novels, it makes sense that it takes place in a literature club. The reason why visual novels are made to be in the first-person point of view and have character interactions is because the player (you) can talk to the computer.\n\nIn Doki Doki Literature Club, you play as a faceless high school boy (you can give him any name you want, but I’m just going to refer to him as MC (Main Character)) who joins a literature club that’s filled with extremely cute girls. At first, nothing seems to be out of the ordinary. Everyone is exchanging poems and making plans for the upcoming school festival, but things get very dark at the end of act one when it’s revealed that these characters have more layers of depth in them.\n\nSayori is a parody of Bakadere characters like Yui from K-On. Both of them are airheads, clumsy, extremely nice towards everybody and bursting nothing but joy most of the time, but it’s revealed that Sayori has a serious case of depression and feels she’s not good enough for MC. In her poem, Dear Sunshine, she expresses her feelings towards MC and there is a hint of her depression. Saying that he is her sunshine and if weren’t for him she would sleep forever. Her second poem, Bottles, shows that her depression has gotten worse and that she is on the edge of a breakdown. At the end of the first act, Sayori commits suicide by hanging herself and if you look closely, you can see that her hands are covered in blood. Monika (the antagonist of the game) explains that Sayori didn’t have enough height for her neck to break and she ended up slowly suffocating to death. She tried to break free when her survival instincts kicked in but failed. Sayori’s name means ‘small lily’ which is a flower used in funerals.\n\nNatsuki is a parody of Tsundere characters like Taiga from Toradora. Both of them act mean towards the main character but over time they show their gentle side. Natsuki loves to read manga but doesn’t express her passion for it outside of the club because most people viewed manga to be childish and she is afraid to be judged. Natsuki keeps her manga in the closet of the club room because her father is abusive and disapproves it so she can’t keep them at home.\n\nIn the first act of the game, MC has a conversation with Natsuki about one of her mangas called Parfait Girls which foreshadows the psychological horror of the game. MC explained to Natsuki that he isn’t into slice of life manga’s because they don’t have much of a plot, but in her response, she assures MC that something will happen later on. The beginning doesn’t seem much, but it gives the reader the time to get to know the characters before the actual story begins.\n\nYuri is a parody of Yandere characters like Yuno from Mirai Nikki. Both of them seem to be nice people but they have an unhealthy obsession with the male lead character. Yuri is a shy girl who loves to read novels and drink tea, but she is also fond of knives and gets sexual pleasure from cutting herself. She’s obsessed with MC to the point that leads her to stalker territory. At the end of act two, after Yuri confess her love towards MC, she commits suicide by stabbing herself a couple of times and you are forced to watch all the colors slowly leaving her body. Monika explains that there are some people who are into yanderes because they like the idea of being obsessed by someone else and willing to do anything for that person, but in this game, it shows how horrifying the situation can be.\n\nThere is not much to talk about MC because he doesn’t have much depth as the other characters. In fact, there is no illustration of him. So, we don’t know what he looks like. Although maybe there is a reason for that. In other dating simulators, usually the main guy is a faceless protagonist who’s just an average Joe who (for some reason) has a great number of cute girls attracted to him. The reason why these guys have a lack of depth is because of their purpose, they are a vessel for the player to see themselves in these situations. MC joined the Literature Club not because he enjoys reading, but because it’s filled with cute girls. His reasons are the same as any other person who play this type of games.\n\nSo far, the characters of Doki Doki Literature Club are not the anime archetypes we usually see. They are a lot more complex, and the creator of the game, Dan Salvato, explained in an interview with Kotaku that the game was born from a love hate relationship with anime. The trope of ‘cute girls doing cute things’ can be both an asset and detriment to anime shows. There are some people who enjoy watching these type of shows while turning other people off because of how unrealistic they are. Monika gives her criticism to the trope in the third act saying “Are people really attracted to these weird personalities that literally don't exist in real life? I'm not judging or anything! After all, I've found myself attracted to some pretty weird stuff, too... I'm just saying, it fascinates me. It's like you're siphoning out all the components of a character that makes them feel human and leaving just the cute stuff. It's concentrated cuteness with no actual substance.\"\n\nGoing back to Natsuki’s manga for a bit, according to the Urban Dictionary Parfait Girl is described as a complex female with many unseen layers and is full of surprises. Pretty much, every single female character in the game.\n\nFinally, there is Monika. Monika is not like Himiko Toga from My Hero Academia, a character you can obviously tell she’s crazy by first glance, Monika is more like Joe Goldberg from Netflix's You. Like Joe, Monika doesn’t seem to be the type of person you think had any potential to be dangerous because she is the most popular girl in the whole school. She is extremely talented, receives the best grades, incredibly gorgeous, and is kind towards the people around her. But under the surface, Monika is a sociopath, she is willing to do whatever it takes to be closer with the person she desires and feels no remorse of the murders she committed. Monika’s appearance creates this false security, she seems like the nicest person you have ever met, but when she starts corrupting the game to make the club members look bad and starts killing them off, it’s incredibly shocking and disturbing.\n\nLooking back there were a few hints of Monika being the antagonist. In the original page on Steam, if you look at the bio, Monika introduces herself and talks about how much she is looking forward to seeing you becoming a new member of her club. In the game, when she gives one of her writing tips of the day, she breaks the fourth wall and tells the player to save his or hers progress because something bad is going to happen soon. But the most significant details before her reveal is her green eyes and her white ribbon.\n\nMonika’s green eyes always grabs my attention whenever she is on the screen because green is one of the easiest colors for the human eyes to perceive. It’s one of the reasons why it’s used for traffic signals, and honestly, I didn’t know the color of the other characters’ eyes until I started writing this analysis.\n\nRed is usually the color to give indication of danger, but in Monika’s case, while green can represent nature and innocence, it can also represent jealousy and destruction and in the game, Monika is upset that she doesn’t have a route, therefore, she deletes all her friends.\n\nNow that I think about it, the other club members’ eye color has their own significant meaning. Sayori’s eyes are blue which can represent her going through depression, Natsuki’s eyes are pink which can represent her femininity and being harmed by her abusive father, Yuri’s eyes are purple which can represent her erotic nature towards knifes and MC.\n\nTo go along with Monika’s green eyes, there is her white ribbon. In western culture, white represents marriage, but in eastern culture, white represents death. These nice little details make Monika a lot more terrifying because she’s basically death herself and destroys anything she sees as a threat. She is also the yang to Sayori’s Yin.\n\nI know I mentioned before that red represents danger, but it can also represent life. Red is associated with blood and fire, things that can cause death but also give life. Sayori wears a red bow, and she has a fun energetic personality that holds the club together and after Monika deletes her, the club falls apart. These two are the polar opposite of each other, Sayori is willing to sacrifice her own happiness for the people she cares about while Monika sacrifices the people around her to archive her own happiness, and at the end, Sayori becomes corrupt when she becomes the club president and Monika has to delete the game when she realizes there is no happiness to be found in the literature club. Just like there is no happiness to be found in visual novels. There is nothing wrong with playing these types of games, but they shouldn’t be substitutes from finding actual people to be involved with, because if you do, what waits for you is more sadness and misery. At the end of the day, these games are only for entertainment.\n\nThis is what makes Monika such a memorable villain because this is something we all can relate to. Monika represents the player’s desire to find love, the desire to find happiness. Monika explains that she’s aware of the reality she lives in is fake and that she feels alone. She’s trapped, isolated, and her only friends are fictional characters that don’t know they have no freedom of will. When you play the game and join the literature club, Monika falls in love with you because you’re an actual person. All of her poems are about her love towards you. You’re in a world she wants to be part of. The real world. Monika wants to be with you because she thinks you and her are the only real people in the game, but she can’t because it’s out of her reach.\n\nI think we all had a couple of moments in our lives when we wanted to escape the reality we live in and be part of a different world as in movies, shows, games, and books we consider to be more adventurous, exciting, and not as dark, complicated, and uncertain as our world. Especially after everything that has happened in recent years with all the drama that has been happening in the government, social media, and the COVID-19 pandemic. But the sad truth is that we all have to accept that this is the reality we are living in, almost the same way as Monika had to accept the reality, she’s living in. In her song, Your Reality, despite all of her efforts, Monika can’t be with the player because they don’t exist in the same world, and she doesn’t know how to love the player properly.\n\nUnlike the names from the other club members that are Japanese, Monika’s name is Latin which means ‘advisor’. Makes sense since she is the club’s president and gives writings tips, but her name also means ‘alone’ in ancient Greek.\n\nMonika respected the player’s decision to not want to be in a relationship with her and the game is over. However, there is an alternative ending which is considered to be the Good Ending. In order to get this ending, you need to see all the CG scenes with Sayori, Yuri, and Natuski all in one playthrough. To archive this, you need to save your game when you’re writing your poems. Write a poem for one girl, and then go back, and write another poem for a different girl. Once you see all the CG scenes before the act ends, save, and go back. Lather, rinse, and repeat. At the end of the game, instead of Sayori getting corrupted, she thanks the player for trying to spend time with everyone and make them feel happy. After the credits, instead of receiving a letter from Monika, there’ll be a message from Dan Salvato. In his message, Salvato expresses his love for games that challenges the status quo and visual novels to tell stories that can’t be told in traditional storytelling, and Doki Doki Literature Club is his love letter to those games.\n\nAfter all that, the moral message of the game is that reality sucks and can be extremely scary, and during these scary times we’re all going through different ranges of mental health issues, but instead of losing ourselves in a fictional world, we ought to reach out towards actual people, help each other out, and spread happiness to the world as much as we can. At least, that’s my interpretation of the game.\n\nBefore ending this analysis, I do want to talk about the side stories. At first glance, it seems to be a prequel. It shows how the characters met and became friends, but I do have a theory that the side stories are not a prequel but a sequel. Let me explain. Sayori mentions MC planning on joining the Anime Club which contradicts the beginning of the main game. In part six (which is the final instalment before the epilogue) titled Self-Love, Natsuki and Yuri talks about the sad feeling when you are at the end of reading a really good book. At the very end of the side stories, I was expecting Monika to say something sinister or do something scary, but she doesn’t do any of those things. Also, if you recall from the events of the main game, when Sayori got deleted the game restarts and no one has any recollection of her. Same thing happens when Monika got deleted. So, it’s possible that when Monika deleted the game their whole world reset, and all of them don’t remember what happened to them. In a way, you can say that the girls get a happy ending. They created a bonding friendship with each other and finally come up with plans for what to do for the school festival.\n\nOverall, Doki Doki Literature Club is amazing and a unique visual novel. This is one of those games that a lot of people won’t forget about in a long time and I want to thank Dan Salvato for creating such a great game.\n\nSources\n\nThe BBC News\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8OoWS1rBtU\n\nThe Origins of Visual Novels by Bowl of Lentils\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wOtv-J7tOI&t=1289s\n\nWhat Are Visual Novels, and Why Are They a Thing? by Get In The Robot\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GajXQ-25Y5s\n\nEpisode 3 of High Score\n\nWhy Are Visual Novels Becoming Popular? by The Anime Man\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EEOkxjqJ5c\n\nDan Salvato interview with Kotaku\n\nhttps://kotaku.com/doki-doki-literature-clubs-horror-was-born-from-a-love-1819724999\n\n16 Dere Types You Will Find in Anime and Manga by GOJINSHI\n\nhttps://www.gojinshi.com/popular-dere-types-in-anime-and-manga/\n\nDoki Doki Literature Club Wiki: Books and Literature\n\nhttps://doki-doki-literature-club.fandom.com/wiki/Books_and_Literature\n\nThe Psychology of Color in Film (with examples) by Jon Fusco\n\nhttps://nofilmschool.com/2016/06/watch-psychology-color-film\n\nThe Meaning of Red in Movies by Now You See It\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Tg5iwK9dKQ\n\nMonika name meaning from Charlies Names\n\nhttps://charlies-names.com/en/monika/#:~:text=Meaning%20of%20Monika,to%20advise%2Fto%20warn).\n\nSayori name meaning from Google\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=sayori+name+meaning&sxsrf=AOaemvJsy8d2_ezZHV__j3Qc0iLmFFiC7g%3A1640810403498&ei=o8fMYcLGHY2xggeirqqoDQ&ved=0ahUKEwiCpPmJ74n1AhWNmOAKHSKXCtUQ4dUDCA4&uact=5&oq=sayori+name+meaning&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQhgMyBQgAEIYDMgUIABCGAzIFCAAQhgMyBQgAEIYDOgcIIxCwAxAnOgcIABBHELADOgcIABCwAxBDOgcIIxCwAhAnOgQIABANOgYIABAHEB46BggAEA0QHjoICAAQDRAFEB46CAgAEAgQDRAeSgQIQRgASgQIRhgAUP0IWJsaYKUhaAFwAngAgAFmiAGtA5IBAzQuMZgBAKABAcgBCsABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz\n\nSymbolic Meaning of Funeral Flowers by Marine Florists\n\nhttps://www.marineflorists.com/sympathy/funeral-flowers-meaning\n\nDoki Doki Literature Club!
