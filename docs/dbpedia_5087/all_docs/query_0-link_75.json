        "text": "Universal Studios will be featuring the “Silent Hill” video game and motion picture franchise in a haunted maze at the Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood’s Halloween Horror Nights.\n\nRelated: The Future of Theme Park IP? Disney App Makes Splash in China / Haunted Attractions: How to Tell a Scary Story – Making Nightmares Come True in the UK, US and Asia\n\nThis will be the first time that a video game will used as inspiration for the Halloween Horror Nights events, which have been consistently rated the nation’s best over the last 20 years. Highlights of the events include highly-themed, disturbingly real, haunted mazes and specially trained real life “scareactors.”\n\nJim Timon, Senior Vice President of Entertainment at Universal Orlando Resort, said, “This is our first partnership with a video game property and we are very excited to create an unparalleled, all-new level of horror for our guests. We can’t wait to watch our guests actually walk into the hell that is Silent Hill.”\n\nThe “Silent Hill” series revolves around a psychologically-charged, horrific plot where characters battle knife wielding demons in an attempt to escape from the nightmarish ash covered town of Silent Hill. The “Silent Hill” franchise has been enormously successful with:\n\nOver seven million “Silent Hill” video game copies sold worldwide,\n\nEarnings of more than $100 million at the box office with the first film, “Silent Hill”, and\n\nA hit comic book series and graphic novels.\n\n“Creating a realistic three-dimensional world based on the disturbing Silent Hill video games and films elevates Halloween Horror Nights to the next generation of twisted entertainment. It’s incredibly imaginative and highly unsettling characters and environments make it the ideal fit for our event where the property can continue its reign of terror and fully immerse guests in its psychological horror, ” said John Murdy, Creative Director for Universal Studios Hollywood.\n\nA sequel to the original film, “Silent Hill: Revelation 3D” from producer Samuel Hadida and his company Davis Films will be released nationwide on October 26 – just in time for Halloween – by Open Road Films."
