        "text": "An evening of music and conversation with Scott McCloud – (Soulside, Girls Against Boys, Paramount Styles, New Wet Kojak).\n\nScott McCloud has been at the helm of the American DC punk / alternative community since the80’s. Starting his first band when he was just 14 and going on to become an MTV darling in the 90s with his band Girls against Boys, signing a major record deal, then to be left in legal limbo with the label leaving the band no option but to split up. Scott has a rich and varied history and is putting it together for a forth coming memoir. He will chat about his life and career so far, the ups and downs of the music biz and play some of his own songs and acoustic versions of songs synonymous with the early days of the DC punk /alternative scene.\n\nNight Moves.\n\nAn innovative & dynamic programme designed to provide new & engaging night time cultural experiences across Drogheda & East Meath.
