        "text": "4 out of 5\n\nLabel: Beggars Banquet\n\nProduced by: New Wet Kojak?\n\nAs GVSB was gearing up for major label stardom, Scott and Johnny’s New Wet Kojak side project continued to find its own legs, developing into something that could be identified as its own band, and perhaps only linked to the GVSB sound via Scott’s distinct raspy croon. And then Freak*On*Ica failed, and New Wet Kojak released its greatest album, ‘Do Things.’ Whether or not it’s a coincidence, ‘Do’ is by no means a response to the world of GVSB: its frustrated lounge-group act was an organic progression from the group’s shamblingly punky start, it just so happens that NWK eventually found the balance between edgy and effected effete, resulting in a disc that exudes a laid back, hazy charm while kicking into overdrive at the same time. Opening pair ‘Go’ and ‘The Overkill’ exemplify this, with the former establishing a delightfully skronky and slinky late-night club vibe until the latter jumps in with a forceful key riff and suddenly pummeling drums. The meter sometimes slips into silly or aimless, like Scott’s Musings about Marilyn Manson on ‘Punxnotdead,’ the sheepishly dumb jabs on closer ‘Show Business,’ or ‘Def con Soul’s open-ended construction, but in every case those songs are surrounded by incredibly strong tracks that twist the formula into a successful variation on the blast of calm and cool GVSB crafted way back on Venus Luxure – though, again, the sound is only linked by the players: where GVSB was raw rock, NWK is polish played by drug-addicts. The years would catch up with both groups again after this release, but it was awesome having something to turn to in the wake of Freak (even though, as I’ve often stated, I don’t mind that disc) and know that these dudes were still in possession of some mighty talent, and might have further surprising ways of letting it out in the future."
