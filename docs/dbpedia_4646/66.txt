New Wet Kojak

This Is The Glamorous (Mantra/Beggars Group)

By: Alex Steininger

Jazz-influenced, well-produced pop songs that stray off into art-rock territory, filled with the sassy, zany saxophone, which dominates the album. The soulful-ness of New Wet Kojak's This Is The Glamorous may not be that of a Stax recording, but This Is The Glamorous is steeped in soul, as much as it is jazz. Here are eleven songs of smooth, yet experimental, risk-taking songs that veer off on tangents and come back, find themselves, and sound all that much better for doing so. The unbeatable live feel, the smoky, improvisational playing, and the controlled, glossy pop infusion make for a real adventure. I'll give it a B.
