New Wet Kojak was formed in 1993 by guitarist/singer Scott McCloud and bassist Johnny Temple during a lost weekend in Amsterdam. With idle time on their hands at the end of a Girls Against Boys tour of Europe, the duo descended, somewhat disheveled, into a small studio in the Red Light District, and emerged with a few loose acoustic-style songs with sleazy bass lines. There was no plan. The project picked up steam a year later in Washington, DC, after a Girls Against Boys show at the (original) 9:30 Club. McCloud and Temple used alcohol to con three DC friends into doing some more recording: Geoff Turner (Gray Matter) and Charles Bennington (High Back Chairs) joined on lead guitar/keyboards and saxophone, respectively, along with drummer Nick Pelliciotto (Edsel). Four more songs emerged, as well as a loose band aesthetic of raw, late night experimentation. It was a wildly erratic combination of difficult personalities and musical arrogance, with a pitch perfect balance of brilliance and confusion. They were aware that having a saxophonist in the band could be problematic. In 1995, the five-piece ensemble had completed their debut full-length recording, New Wet Kojak, which was released on Touch and Go Records. Most of the post-Amsterdam songs were recorded at Turner and Benningtonâs WGNS Studios. The bandâs second full-length LP, Nasty International, was released by Touch and Go in 1997, and garnered more positive reviews, including in Vice and Pitchfork, which gave the album a glowing 9/10. New Wet Kojak began to play live concerts during this period, in the US and more extensively in Europe. Do Things, the bandâs third LP, was released by Beggars Banquet US in 2000, followed by an EP titled No. 4 and another full-length recording, This Is the Glamorous (also on Beggars). The band last played live together in the summer of 2002. Other than a five-song set at the Black Catâs fifteenth-anniversary celebration in DC in 2014, these will be the first New Wet Kojak shows in more than twenty years.
