        "text": "Condition: 8/10 Little wear to the front of the collar. Small error to the hem on the lower front\n\nSize: Children's\n\nChest Measurement: 29-31 Inches / 74-79 CM\n\nManufacturer: Adidas\n\nColour: Red, white - black - gold trim\n\nMaterial: Polyester\n\nSeasons: 1995/1996\n\nPlayer: N/A\n\nPatches: N/A\n\nOfficial Adidas Liverpool home football shirt from the 1995/96 season.\n\nCondition of this original football jersey is 8/10 - Little wear to the front of the collar. Small error to the hem on the lower front (see photos).\n\nHaving paid a national record £8.5million for Nottingham Forest striker Stan Collymore in the close season, Liverpool were many people's favourites for the league title in 1995–96 – especially as defending champions Blackburn Rovers had failed to significantly add to their squad and runners-up Manchester United had sold three key players but begun the season without a single major signing.\n\n1994–95 had arguably been Liverpool's best season of the post-Dalglish era, as they had finished fourth and won the Football League Cup. They already possessed some of the country's finest young talent in the shape of prolific striker Robbie Fowler and talented midfielders Steve McManaman and Jamie Redknapp. Fowler would end the season as the second highest goalscorer in the country, behind Alan Shearer, while McManaman was the leading goal assists maker in the country, with 25 assists in the Premier League alone."
