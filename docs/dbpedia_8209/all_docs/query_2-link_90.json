        "text": "Liverpool could lose one of their most important players late in the summer transfer window.\n\nThe Reds have not made any new signing under manager Arne Slot and fans have been patiently waiting for some good news on that front.\n\nIt could get worse for the Liverpool faithful as according to Football Insider, the Merseyside club could be tempted to sell star player Mohamed Salah this summer if they receive an offer of £100m for him.\n\nThe 32-year-old Egyptian attacker has been a brilliant servant of the club and has played a massive part in their success in the Champions League and the Premier League.\n\nHowever, his time at the club could soon be coming to an end as the Reds would find an offer of £100m too good to refuse.\n\nSaudi Arabian clubs are interested in signing the Premier League star and they are expected to make a move for the prolific goal scorer once they find out the their budget.\n\nAs per the report, the European league could face a mass exodus soon as the Saudi Arabian clubs are still deciding their budget for the transfer business.\n\nSalah was linked with an exit from Anfield last summer but the Reds rejected a huge bid from the Middle East.\n\nThe attacker has now entered the final year of his contract at the club and instead of losing him for free next season, this could be the ideal time to cash in on him.\n\nMo Salah was impressive for Liverpool last season\n\nIn 32 Premier League matches last season, Salah scored 18 goals and provided 10 assists. These are great numbers for any player in the world but even after such great output, if felt like the attacker had an underwhelming season.\n\nThis shows the greatness of the Liverpool star who has consistently performed every single season for the Premier League giants.\n\nAt his age, players often start declining but Salah has shown he is still at the top of his game and his potential move to Saudi Arabia would be the best advert for the league since the move of Cristiano Ronaldo to Al-Nassr."
