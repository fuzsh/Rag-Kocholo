        "text": "The 24/25 kit overview\n\nFootball shirts for the 2024/25 season are gradually being released so we have started compiling a list of all next year's kits so you can stay up to date.\n\nOur list includes confirmed shirts from the Premier League, La Liga, the Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1, as well as all the international releases.\n\nThey are even some leaked 24/25 kits for you to check out. And we'll keep updating this list as more clubs release the jerseys they'll be wearing next season.\n\nRight, let's get into it - new season kits.\n\nManchester United 2024/25 adidas third kit\n\nOh my – the Manchester United third shirt is a thing of beauty. The devil crest, the chest bands of colour. It's a winner. The trefoil is back!\n\nShop United shirts here.\n\nArsenal 2024/25 adidas third kit\n\nIt's a bold design that gives even the shirts from the early to mid 90's Arsenal stock a run for their money. No doubt it'll prove a firm favourite with Arsenal fans the world over.\n\nReal Madrid 2024/25 adidas third kit\n\nReal have gone for all out elegance here. The premium all-over 'RMCF' monogram pattern, the polo collar – it's sleek and smart. We want one.\n\nBayern Munich 2024/25 adidas third kit\n\nInter 2024/25 Nike away kit\n\nSome nice accents, here - the cuffs and two tones of blue running under down the side panels. But it's just a bit too conservative and inoffensive for us.\n\nAjax 2024/25 adidas away kit\n\nWe very much like Ajax's home and away shirts for 2024/25 - and while this isn't quite to the same standard, it's certainly not ugly. Light grey with a sort of early-onset-migraine recurring graphic. A solid seven out of ten.\n\nMan City 2024/25 Puma away kit\n\nIt's not the first time Man City have resurrected the look and feel of the shirt they wore when they beat Gillingham to get promoted out of the third division back in 1999 - but 25 years on from that famous match, Puma are well within their rights to do so again. It's a decent enough effort - but no new version will ever come close to the original, which we recently listed as one of the 50 greatest shirts of all time.\n\nShop City shirts\n\nRoma 2024/25 adidas away kit\n\nA kind of faded red wine stain, post the application of several dollops of Vanish, adorns the front of Roma's away kit for next season. Nice enough, though.\n\nJuventus 2024/25 adidas away kit\n\nWe like the look of Juve in yellow - it harks back to the days of Didier Deschamps and Fabrizio Ravanelli. Our only minor concern with this is it reminds us of that awful yellow away kit Newcastle wore a decade or so ago.\n\nAthens Kallithea FC Kappa home kit\n\nPSG 2024/25 Nike away kit\n\nCan't help feeling this looks like a really bad concept kit, produced by some spotty 13-year-old with too much time on his hands. The brush stroke Eiffel Tower is just a bit obvious.\n\nChelsea 2024/25 Nike away kit\n\nIt seems to be getting a lot of love, this. And if we're completely honest, we aren't entirely sure why. The Nike collar still looks bad. The badge and swoosh look good, to be fair. As for the rest, it's ok. Sort of.\n\nMan City 2024/25 Puma third kit\n\nSome things just work - and City in burgundy is one of them. The gold detail on the logo, badge and sponsor is a nice touch, too. We like this one.\n\nAtletico Madrid 2024/25 Nike away kit\n\nWe can't shift the feeling that this should have been a Liverpool away kit. But hey ho, it's a nice looking thing nonetheless. The red and white badge, which matches the collar and cuffs, is a masterstroke.\n\nREAD: the 50 greatest football shirts of all time\n\nMan United 2024/25 Adidas away kit\n\nGiven the quality of some of the adidas away kits for 2024/25, you would have hoped for something a little more daring for United. Alas, the three stripes have played it safe with a decent but inoffensive navy blue kit.\n\nAC Milan 2024/25 Puma away kit\n\nYeah, nice this. AC Milan should always have a white kit in their armoury and this is a very clean addition to the 2024/25 suite.\n\nReal Madrid 2024/25 Adidas away kit\n\nA welcome return to orange for Real Madrid. Some nice additional touches in the graphic on the front, too. Bellingham, Mbappe and Vinny Jr are gonna look great in this next season.\n\nNewcastle United 2024/25 Adidas third kit\n\nWell this is nice, isn't it? The colours take their cue from the 1999/2000 away kit, as worn by Sir Bobby Robson's Newcastle United, while the badge is a throwback to the Magpies' crest in the 80s. What's not to like?\n\nLeeds United 2024/25 Adidas away kit\n\nOK, let's cut to the chase - that badge is sensational. Leeds's away shirt is based on the club's 1974 kit, which featured the extremely retro looking 'smiley' badge. Adidas have brought it back and it absolutely makes this jersey.\n\nInter 2024/25 Nike home kit\n\nLooks a bit like a migraine attack but in this case that's no bad thing. According to the vacuous copy on Inter's website, the kit represents the Nerazzurri's past achievements and future ambitions. This would have been a solid eight out of ten but it loses points for the depressing sponsor.\n\nAston Villa 2024/25 Adidas home kit\n\nAston Villa in the Champions League wearing a pretty nice adidas kit, you say? What strange times we live in. A very decent jersey, this one.\n\nBarcelona 2024/25 Nike home kit\n\nTo mark their 125th anniversary, Barcelona have gone back to their beginnings and paid homage to the club's first ever shirt. The 24/25 jersey is half blue and half maroon, similar to the shirt worn in Barca's inaugural season. The scaled-back Spotify logo is a nice touch.\n\nArsenal 2024/25 Adidas away kit\n\nArsenal get their second black away kit in three years with this little beaut from Adidas, produced in collaboration with London menswear label Labrum. To be fair, that canon logo would make any jersey special.\n\nRoma 2024/25 Adidas home kit\n\nA tidy little shirt, this one. The pinstripes look great, while the colour matching sponsor logo isn't too intrusive.\n\nMLS third kits\n\nMajor League Soccer and adidas have unveiled the adidas x MLS Archive Collection, which includes third jerseys worn by five clubs throughout the remainder of the 2024 season.\n\nThe five clubs kicking off the adidas x MLS Archive Collection are LA Galaxy, LAFC, Inter Miami CF, Portland Timbers and Sporting Kansas City. As this throwback-inspired series begins, MLS and adidas will explore expanding which clubs have a third jersey in 2025 and beyond.\n\nDrawing on the nostalgic look of sports broadcasting, advertising, magazines and catalogs, the adidas x MLS Archive Collection creates a unique narrative for each club. The collection features jerseys, jackets and Gazelle shoes that lean into a retro theme of each club’s city.\n\nWerder Bremen 2024/25 Hummel kit\n\nInspired by the Bremen flag, Werder's new Hummel kit is a visual feast. We're big fans of green kits in general - they're nearly always great - and this is another one for the list.\n\nEverton 2024/25 Castore home kit\n\nThe last shirt to be worn at Goodison Park should have been a firecracker. But this isn't anything close. Aside from some nice detailing on the collar and all-over print, this is just a bit bland.\n\nBayern Munich 2024/25 Adidas away kit\n\nApparently, Bayern's new away jersey showcases 'the club's connection to its homeland with a special play of colours inspired by the Bavaria'. The real question though is this: will Harry Kane win anything wearing it?\n\nChelsea 2024/25 Nike home kit\n\nNike's latest drop is this eye catching stunner designed for Chelsea's latest campaign in the Premier League. The template is very similar to the South Korea away shirt currently being worn by the Taegeuk Warriors. We like the no sponsor look, showing off the design in all its glory, however we are expecting for this to be ruined come the start of the season when the inevitable betting/investment sponsor gets slapped across the front with complete disregard to any design elements.\n\nBlackburn Rovers 2024/25 Macron third kit\n\nMacron are at it again with what we think is another stunner. Forget the slightly ugly WR sponsor and focus instead on the chunky collar and cuffs with symmetrical crest and logo printing.\n\nShop all UK Club shirts\n\nLas Palmas 2024/25 Hummel home kit\n\nThis latest hummel release is a beautiful throwback to the Canarian team's 1996-98 Puma kits. The collar and sleeve pattern are a joy. We approve.\n\nLas Palmas 2024/25 Hummel away kit\n\nAnd the away version is just as clean. Somehow, evn that side sponsor works here.\n\nFC Basel 2024/25 Macron home & away kits\n\nFC Basel's new home and away kits have freshly dropped and it's fair to say that these two will certainly divide opinion amongst the fanbase of the Swiss club and the wider football shirt community.\n\nHellas Verona 2024/25 Joma home kit\n\nA beauty from Joma. Hellas's new home shirt has a minimalist design with gorgeous yellow pinstripe - and we love a pinstripe at CK HQ. The shirt pays homage to the team's Scudetto success in the 1984/85 season.\n\nIpswich Town 2024/25 Umbro home kit\n\nAn absolute belter, this. The pin stripes evoke memories of Ipswich's kits during their early 80s glory years, while the shield behind the badge harks back to the Blues' 92-94 Umbro jersey. This will look very nice in the Premier League next season.\n\nIpswich Town 2024/25 Umbro away kit\n\nThe Super Blues' away kit next season takes inspiration from their claret-coloured shirt of the early naughties. The gold detail on the sponsor logo, Umbro logo and badge make the jersey pop. We like.\n\nWrexham 2024/25 Macron home kit\n\nA solid effort, this, for American TV's AFC Wrexham. Macron are making some serious moves right now.\n\nLeicester City 2024/25 adidas home kit\n\nAdidas are really going through the motions with this 'effort' for Leicester City. It's blue. And that's all there is to say about it.\n\nNapoli 2024/25 EA7 kit\n\nLight blue with a nice collar. Inoffensive, solid, unspectacular.\n\nLeeds United 2024/25 Adidas home kit\n\nReally struggling to have much of an opinion on this one - which is probably not a good thing. Hard to spot many differences from last season's shirt - apart from the Red Bull logo, which is an unwelcome addition.\n\nAS Monaco 2024/25 Kappa home kit\n\nAS Monaco have revealed their new Kappa home jersey for the 2024/25 season - and it's obviously lovely. The kit marks the club's centenary, paying tribute to the prestigious history of the Rouge & Blanc. In fact, the shirt takes a detail from each of the eight jerseys worn during their title-winning seasons, which we reckon is a lovely touch.\n\nClub America 2024/25 Nike away kit\n\nClub America and Nike triumph once again! Massive centred badge and swoosh accompanied with a delicious repeat Club America badges from across the club's history, what more do you want? This gets the nod from us - we're giving this beauty an 8.5. Beautiful.\n\nShop Club America kits\n\nWest Ham United 2024/25 Umbro home kit\n\nThe Hammers' new kit is inspired by the club's golden era in the 1960s, a decade in which they enjoyed European and domestic success. It's all very easy on the eye. Textbook Umbro.\n\nWest Ham United 2024/25 Umbro away kit\n\nIt's back to black for West Ham's away shirt next season. This has been named 'The Cockney Kit' due to the graphic representation of the iconic St Mary-le-Bow woven into the fabric. Decent enough.\n\nManchester United 2024/25 adidas home kit\n\nShop Manchester United kits\n\nTottenham Hotspur 2024/25 Nike away kit\n\nThe new Spurs away kit takes inspiration from the club's change kits of the early 80s, which is nice. The printer-running-out-of-ink style kinda works, too. A solid seven out of ten this, which feels about right for Tottenham right now.\n\nShop Spurs kits\n\nNewcastle United 2024/25 adidas home kit\n\nA return to adidas for the Geordies and it's a solid start. In fact, this might be one of the nicest of the new Premier League kits. Rumours abound that the away shirt will pay homage to their burgundy and navy hooped shirt from 1995/96 - let's hope so because it remains one of the great Premier League kits.\n\nShop Newcastle shirts\n\nCrystal Palace 2024/25 Macron home kit\n\nCorrrrr, this is nice. Palace's new home kit marks a return to the club’s trademark red and blue stripes, with embedded repeated eagles nesting within the contrasting sections and a fine red, white and blue trim sported around the collar and sleeves, with matching shorts. As part of the club’s celebrations to mark 100 years since the official opening of Selhurst Park, the kit also features a commemorative ‘stamp’ on the back collar of the shirt.\n\nShop Palace kits\n\nLEAKED Arsenal 2024/25 adidas third kit\n\nThis leak comes from Mr Jersey - and we are praying it's accurate because that is a thing of god damn beauty. The trefoil badge - widely expected to adorn all adidas's third kits next season - combined with the stripped back canon badge is glorious, while the northern lights-inspired colourway is positively dreamy. We very much like.\n\nShop Arsenal shirts\n\nBrazil Nike 1998 reissue\n\nWe're not sold on reissues but when they're of one of the most famous Brazil kits we can make an exception. Whether a remake of the jersey worn on that night in Paris by R9 is worth £125 is up for debate, though.\n\nUNAM Pumas 2024/25 Nike home and away kits\n\nIf you know Cult Kits, you'll be aware of our love of Mexican shirts, in particular UNAM Pumas, who always have incredible jerseys. And we're happy to announce that next season's home and away are insanely beautiful, especially the home, which takes it cues from the 1997/98 away kit.\n\nChivas 2024/25 Puma home kit\n\nA nice neckline on this one for Chivas from Puma. The various sponsors using the same tone of red for their logos helps retain a sense of consistency in the aesthetic.\n\nShop Mexico club shirts\n\nJamaica 2024/25 adidas home and away kits\n\nA couple of absolute belters from adidas for Jamaica. There's some lovely detailing on the home shirt but the away is absolute chaos... glorious, beautiful chaos.\n\nReal Madrid 2024/25 adidas home kit\n\nA really nice houndstooth pattern adorns the new Real Madrid shirt, representing the cleanest home kit design to grace the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in recent memory.\n\nShop Real Madrid shirts\n\nTottenham 2024/25 Nike home kit\n\nA slightly more adventurous Spurs kit than we've seen from Nike for a while. The detailing on the sleeve cuffs are great and Tottenham's cockerel logo remains one of the best in the business.\n\nShop Spurs kits\n\nAjax 2024/25 adidas home shirt\n\nVery neat and tidy, this. Single button on the collar, three white stripes to match the sleeves, nice gold detailing on the stars above the badge. All very agreeable.\n\nAjax 2024/25 adidas away kit\n\nAjax have been treated to some really nice garbs by adidas in recent seasons and their 2024/25 away kit continues the tradition nicely.\n\nShop Ajax shirts\n\nCeltic 2024/25 adidas home kit\n\nA fairly sold effort from adidas for Celtic. The addition of the detailing on the collar helps lift this from 'alright' to 'bit better than alright'.\n\nShop Celtic kits\n\nAC Milan 2024/25 Puma home kit\n\nWe reckon this might just be Puma's best AC Milan shirt yet. The white collar and cuffs are a great addition, as is the underarm paneling. The Rossoneri are going to look great in 2024/25.\n\nShop AC Milan kits\n\nSporting 2024/25 Nike home kit\n\nThe addition of black hoops on Sporting's home shirt is quite a statement from Nike - but we think it looks great.\n\nBorussia Dortmund 2024/25 Puma home kit\n\nPuma haven't been helped by the return of an ugly sponsor logo (why is it square?) but this is a decent effort. The black sleeves are a nice touch, while the pinstripe gives off some retro vibes.\n\nShop Dortmund kits\n\nBologna 2024/25 Macron home kit\n\nNo one does red and navy stripes better than Bologna. Their 2024/25 shirt, from Macron, is an absolute triumph, helped in no small part by a lovely sponsor and the club's gorgeous crest.\n\nMan City 2024/25 Puma home kit\n\nAfter some fairly underwhelming shirts in recent seasons, Puma have delivered a really nice jersey for Man City next season. A classic look with superb flourishes on the collar and cuffs - a kit fit for champions.\n\nShop Man City kits\n\nArsenal 2024/25 Adidas home kit\n\nBig early 90s vibes with the new Arsenal x adidas shirt. The navy detailing helps with the nostalgic aesthetic. If rumours are to be believed, the Gunners' new third kit will be even easier on the eye.\n\nShop Arsenal kits\n\nLyon 2024/25 Adidas home kit\n\nLyon have been treated to some great shirts by adidas in recent seasons - and this is another to add to the list.\n\nShop French club shirts\n\nFiorentina 2024/25 Kappa home kit\n\nA Fiorentina and Kappa combo can't really go wrong, can it? And while this is on the fairly conservative side, it's still great.\n\nLiverpool 2024/25 Nike home kit\n\nThe design for next season's Liverpool kit is a modern take on the shirt worn by the Reds to European Cup glory in Rome 40 years ago. The collar is a bold statement - although we're not sure if that's a good thing.\n\nBayern Munich 2024/25 adidas home kit\n\nBayern are back in red and it feels like the world is a little bit more normal again. Maybe a return to traditional colours will be the catalyst for Harry Kane to finally win a medal.\n\nJuventus 2024/25 adidas kit\n\nDon't say it looks like the Newcastle kit, don't say it looks like the Newcastle kit, don't say it looks like the Newcastle kit...\n\nAtletico Madrid LEAKED 24/25 Nike home kit\n\nThis has kinda faded deckchair vibes and we're fine with that. The new Nike collar sort of works here, too. If this is what Los Colchoneros' new home kit is next season, it's a definite 7 out of 10."
