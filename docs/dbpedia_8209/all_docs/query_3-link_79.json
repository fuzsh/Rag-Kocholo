        "text": "Rob Halligan 27/06/2020\n\nAs many of you will have seen, there have been many comments posted on concerning the Liverpool fans' celebrations of their long-awaited Premier League trophy win the past two nights, following their title victory. Michael Kenrick asked me to do a fan piece on all things Red Shite fans. (I don't know if he was joking or not??)\n\nAgainst my better judgment, and after thinking it was not a good idea, I have decided to do a thread on my opinions of the Red Shite fans. Some of you on here think I absolutely despise everything RS, and you'd be right, although I think we all despise them. Even the mere sight of a red shirt makes my blood boil, no more so than when I'm away on holiday, knowing full well the rat inside the shirt is probably not a Scouser.\n\nSo where do we begin? 1985 is probably the best year. Even though I'd never liked RS fans before 1985, I think this is when it all changed. On 15 May, I travelled to Rotterdam, along with 25,000+ other Blues, for the Europeean Cup-Winners Cup Final. A great day was had by all, with not a single arrest to be seen.\n\nFast forward just two weeks, and our dreams of European dominance were shattered. \"It was not our fault\" came the cries from all those in red. \"It was Chelsea, West Ham and Millwall fans, it was the fault of Uefa, it was the fault of the police, it was the fault of the Belgian FA, but it was definitely not our fault.\"\n\nFuck me, me and a couple of mates were in the pub the following night, when a few reds we know who had been to Heysel, actually came into the pub on their return, gloating about the number of deaths to Juventus fans. Definitely not Scouse humour at its best.\n\nThe following year, or whenever it was, they produced the Steaua Bucharest banner. Did the morons not realise the irony of the banner? Because of their actions at Heysel, we were all given a five-year European ban. Theirs, if I remember, was longer (maybe seven), but somehow they seemed to be the first club allowed back in.\n\nThey always sing to us \"Where's your European Cups\". Well, I think we know... buried amongst the rubble that was once the Heysel Stadium. As Neville Southall says in Howard's Way, we would have gone on to dominate Europe for many years if it weren't for the ban.\n\nI have been all over Europe watching us and, although there have been one or two minor skirmishes, there has been nothing worth writing home about regards trouble, yet somehow it seems to follow them around, either at home or abroad.\n\nEvery time they are involved in anything, it's always (and this is what annoys me the most) \"The bloody Scousers causing mayhem again\". The whole country tarnishes us with the same brush as them.\n\nThe way the media, BBC, Sky, BT Sport fawn over them makes me sick. I remember back in the 70s and early 80s, the papers were always full of everything Man Utd, something the kopites hated despite Liverpool being the most dominant team back then. Now, they love it, and they think the whole world loves them, when in fact the whole world despises them.\n\nEven the fact they hadn't won the Premier League for 30 years, the media treat them as if they'd won it every year. Why are there so many ex-Liverpool players as pundits, be it Sky, BT Sport or the BBC, they are everywhere. Do no other clubs have ex-players worthy of being a pundit?\n\nI'll miss out a lot of what I would like to say, and come up to date. We've known pretty much since last December they would win the Premier League. Then came this terrible coronavirus. Had their luck finally run out, and would the Premier League season be declared null and void? The answer is obviously No, but we've all been told to stay away from stadiums and avoid mass gatherings.\n\nI've watched most of the Premier League matches since its return, and there's only one stadium with a banner draped over the seating saying \"Stay safe and support us at home\". No prizes for guessing which stadium that is. It seems that club can't even trust it's own supporters.\n\nSo on to last night. I'm a born and bred Scouser, and have lived here all my life. I am proud to be a Scouser, and proud we have a magnificent city, yet today we are seeing images of a moron firing a rocket launcher at the Royal Liver Building, and the area all around the Pier Head knee-deep in rubbish, and also hearing of attacks on the police. All this will be shown around the world football not just in this country, and guess what, we'll all be tarnished with the same brush, because it will be The Scousers, and not the Red Shite. Steve Rotherham, the Liverpool retro mayor, has been quoted as saying he fully supports the police in issuing a Section 34 Dispersal order.\n\nI just wish they would all fuck off back to Norway, London and the home counties, and wherever else they come from, and leave the proper Scousers to support a proper Scouse club, the number one club in the city of Liverpool....\n\nEVERTON FC\n\nCOYB...
