        "text": "Frank Lampard had just struck an equaliser for West Ham United against Crystal Palace when the floodlights at Upton Park failed, plunging the ground into darkness and forcing the abandonment of the game.\n\nAs football fans in east London cursed their luck, 6,500 miles away in Malaysia members of an Asian betting syndicate celebrated a six-figure payout.\n\nThe syndicate had \"arranged\" for the lights to go out, they repeated their scam during a Wimbledon v. Arsenal game. But, when they tried for a third time, at a Charlton v. Liverpool match, their plan was foiled. The security guard who had been bribed to trip the electrics using a remote control told a colleague of the plan and he alerted the police. Four men â€“ two Malaysians, a Chinese man and the Charlton security supervisor were subsequently jailed for between 18 months and four years.\n\nWest Ham United were asked by the police to postpone the Carling Cup first-round tie with Aldershot Town\n\nThe club were contacted the evening before the game was due to take place and told that all major public events in London were to be rearranged because of the need to focus police resources elsewhere. Whilst neither the club or police anticipate any issues around the game taking place, the club had to comply with the police request.\n\nThe Club confirmed that Matchday programmes would not be sold to the general public and that all copies were being destroyed.\n\nAs we now know a handful escaped the destruction order which immediately catapults this programme into the most wanted West Ham United Home programme of the last Decade."
