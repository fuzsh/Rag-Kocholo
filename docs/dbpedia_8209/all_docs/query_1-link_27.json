        "text": "Liverpool are working to sign Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad.\n\nAnd according to recent reports, the 25-year-old midfielder is not the only La Liga star who could make his way to Anfield.\n\nInterestingly, Spanish outlet Fichajes claim the Reds, led by new manager Arne Slot, have emerged as one of the ‘main suitors’ to offer Rodrygo a way out of Real Madrid following Kylian Mbappe’s recent arrival.\n\nRodrygo could seek Real Madrid exit following Kylian Mbappe arrival\n\nAlthough the Brazilian has been a mainstay in Carlo Ancelotti’s side since he arrived from Santos in 2019, the 23-year-old now faces an uncertain future following the signing of Mbappe from PSG earlier this summer.\n\nThe Frenchman’s capture on a free transfer is undoubtedly a major coup for Los Blancos but Ancelotti must work out how best to include the superstar in his preferred lineup.\n\nThe 2018 World Cup winner’s reluctance to play as a number nine will likely force Madrid to play him on the wing. The problem this creates for Rodrygo is that teammate Vinicius Junior is virtually undroppable.\n\nThe Brazilian is a candidate to win this year’s Ballon d’Or, and although he is likely to miss out on the prestigious award to Manchester City midfielder and favourite Rodri, the South American remains one of Europe’s most prolific wide-attackers.\n\nAnd that could force Rodrygo to take on a more squad-focused and rotational role — something he has not yet experienced at the Santiago Bernabeu after making 53 La Liga starts in the past two seasons.\n\nLiverpool and Man City ‘main suitors’ for Brazilian\n\nConsequently, and likely to welcome the challenge of playing in the Premier League, Rodrygo has been linked with a high profile transfer to two of England’s biggest clubs.\n\nIn addition to Liverpool, Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City are also credited with having an interest. The Cityzens are on lookout for an attacking replacement for Atletico Madrid-bound Julian Alvarez after the Argentine agreed a transfer worth a reported £82 million (€90 million).\n\nReal Madrid are believed to value Rodrygo at £77.5 million (€90 million) and could begin negotiations for their number 11 before the close of the summer transfer window."
