Cabas gymnasium. There is also a Salem High School Athletic Hall of Fame Facebook page and an upcoming individual website that is devoted to honoring all inductees. Nominations for the Athletic Hall of Fame are accepted by the public each year and can be submitted via email or through the Facebook page.\n\nFollowing are the career highlights of the 2024 selections, who will be also recognized at halftime of the home opening football game on Friday, Sept. 6 against East Liverpool.\n\nWILLIAM PAULINE\n\nHigh School\n\nClass of 1958\n\nBasketball\n\nWilliam Pauline has been celebrated for his significant contributions to the school’s athletic legacy both on and off the court. In 2007, Pauline was rightfully inducted into the Salem High School Athletic Hall of Fame as a contributor with his dedication to Salem athletics, serving as the head scorekeeper for the Salem boys basketball team for over 30 years. He also served as an official at high school track meets and coached Little League baseball teams for several years. However, Pauline achieved equally great success as a Quaker athlete.\n\nA two-year starter in basketball, Pauline’s leadership was instrumental in guiding his team to a 14-4 record during his junior year. As a senior, the co-captain emerged as the team’s leading scorer, amassing 331 points, including standout performances with a season-high 24 points against Ashland and 23 points against Girard. The Quakers completed an 18-0 regular season, the only team to achieve an undefeated regular season in school history, before finishing with a 20-1 overall record. Throughout his high school career, Pauline scored a total of 550 points.\n\nPauline’s talents on the court earned him a scholarship to Michigan State University, where he continued his basketball journey and made several appearances as a sophomore.\n\nHis induction follows that of his classmate and teammate, the late James “Moe” Meissner, a fellow SHS Athletic Hall of Fame inductee from the Class of 2013. Pauline, a retired USPS Postmaster of East Palestine, currently lives in Lutz, FL with his wife of over sixty years, Nancy. They have five children (all Salem graduates), 15 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren, with two more on the way.\n\n1957-58 Boys\n\nBasketball Team\n\nThe 1957-58 Boys Basketball Team, under the exceptional leadership of legendary head coach John Cabas (SHS Athletic HOF Class of 2006), is remembered as a monumental yet often overlooked group in Salem High School’s athletic history. In the shadows of the 1958-59 team who achieved state-runner up status the following year, the remarkable 1957-58 team holds the distinction of being the only undefeated regular-season basketball team in school history, achieving a flawless 18-0 record and finishing the season with an impressive 20-1 overall record.\n\nThe starting five players were pivotal to the team’s success: junior Lou Slaby (SHS Athletic HOF Class of 2009) at center, senior William Pauline (SHS Athletic HOF Class of 2024) and junior Clyde Marks at forward, and seniors Robert “Butch” Platt and Jim “Moe” Meissner (SHS Athletic HOF Class of 2013) at guard. The depth of the team was demonstrated by the contributions of sixth man, junior Woody Deitch (SHS Athletic HOF Class of 2019), along with other lettermen consisting of seniors Darryl Adams and John Sturgeon, and sophomore Dan Krichbaum (SHS Athletic HOF Class of 2014).\n\nThe team’s offensive prowess was evident as they consistently had at least two players score in double figures in every game. Their high-scoring games included surpassing the 90-point mark on three separate occasions. The consistent offensive explosions propelled them to break the school record for most points in a season, amassing a total of 1459 points, surpassing the record set back in the 1955-56 season. The undefeated Quakers finished the season ranked 5th in the state in the final Class AA AP poll. However, their season came to an end in their third game of the tournament, a 54-49 loss to Youngstown South.\n\nThe 1957-58 team will not only be remembered as the lone undefeated regular season team in school history, but also as the last Quaker team to play their season at the “old” Salem High School (currently Kent State Salem City Center). Their extraordinary success additionally set a foundation for the future. The very next year, while ushering in a brand new (and still current) high school, the 1958-59 basketball team (SHS Athletic HOF Class of 2006) went on to finish as the Class AA state-runner up, the farthest a Salem basketball team has ever advanced in school history.\n\nMitch Maroscher\n\nSalem High School\n\nClass of 2012\n\nTennis\n\nMitch Maroscher carved out a remarkable tennis career, earning him a well-deserved place as the first boy’s tennis player inducted into the Salem High School Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nAs a junior, Maroscher helped the Salem tennis team finish with a 14-5 record and an All-American Conference White Tier championship under head coach Jeff Mooney. Maroscher experienced postseason success and became the first-ever state qualifier in school history. Furthermore, He became only the second Columbiana County tennis player to advance to the Boys OHSAA Division II State Championships, and the first since 1990. After setting a school record for most wins in a single season, the touted Quaker demonstrated extraordinary talent and determination at the state level before losing a hard-fought three-set match in the round of 16.\n\nIn his senior year, Maroscher continued to excel, becoming a two-time district qualifier by winning a sectional championship. His leadership and skill contributed to the team’s impressive 12-6 overall record and 9-1 record in Salem’s first year in Northeastern Buckeye Conference play.\n\nThe successful Salem netter would continue his tennis career collegiately at Scottsdale Community College in Arizona. He posted an outstanding 8-0 singles record and 7-1 doubles record, while being ranked as the 34th best junior college player in the nation. As a sophomore, he transferred to Grand Canyon University and played #1 singles and #2 doubles for two years. As a junior, he was named second-team All-Western Athletic Conference while playing 19 matches at #1 singles and leading GCU to a 13-7 overall record and a WAC championship. In his senior year, Maroscher transferred to Youngstown State University, where he played #1 singles and #1 doubles, achieving a 16-8 singles record, a 21-10 doubles record, and an 18-6 record in dual play during the spring of 2017. For his efforts, he was voted first-team All-Horizon League while contributing to the best team in YSU history.\n\nIn 2023, Maroscher returned to his alma mater and became the Salem High School Boys Tennis Coach, leading the team to an 11-5 record in his first year. This past season, he guided the boys’ tennis team to a 17-1 dual match record and an Eastern Buckeye Conference championship, earning him the title of 2024 EBC Coach of the Year.\n\nMaroscher, the first member of the Salem Athletic Hall of Fame from the class of 2012, is the son of Vic and Sherrie Maroscher. He currently resides in Salem with his daughter, Emerson, and is employed with MM Industries and the Salem Racquet Club.\n\nRyan Bush\n\nSalem High School\n\nClass of 2013\n\nBasketball\n\nRecord-breaking performances and a dedication to excellence have helped Ryan Bush leave an indelible mark on Salem High School’s basketball history, securing his place among the school’s greats in the athletic hall of fame.\n\nBush was a three-year starter under head coach Rich Hart, demonstrating his scoring prowess early. As a sophomore, he averaged 14.6 points per game, which increased to 18.4 points per game as a junior. His impressive junior year earned him First Team All-Area and Second Team All-Northeastern Buckeye Conference honors.\n\nIn his senior year, Bush set a new school record for points in a game by scoring 47 points in an 83-64 win over Liberty, surpassing the previous record of 45 held by Walt Deshields (SHS Class of 1979 and SHS Athletic Hall of Fame Class of 2011). Averaging 21.9 points per game throughout his senior campaign, he also set a school record for most points in a season with 569 points in 26 games, breaking the record of 500 previously held by Bill Beery (SHS Class of 1963 and SHS Athletic Hall of Fame Class of 2007).\n\nUnder the leadership of Bush and nine other seniors, the 2012-13 team achieved a 19-7 overall record (9-5 in the NBC), tying for the sixth most wins in school history. The Quakers’ successful year was only their third winning season in the previous 15 years and the team advanced to the Division II Boardman district final before losing 61-46 to Youngstown Mooney.\n\nThe standout Quaker finished his high school career with a school record 1313 points, surpassing the school record of 1168 held by Beery set back in 1963. Bush also scored in double figures in 64 out of 69 career starts. His senior year accolades include being named First Team All-County and All-NBC, Columbiana County Player of the Year, First Team All NEO-Inland District, Division II All-Ohio Special Mention, and playing in the Ohio North-South All-Star Game.\n\nIn addition to his basketball success, Bush was also a three-year letter winner in track. He achieved a personal best high jump of 6’2″ as a junior and was part of two state-qualifying 4×400 relay teams.\n\nCollegiately, the record-breaking Quaker attended Eastern Mennonite University, where he appeared in 18 career games over two seasons on the hardwood. He later transferred to Florida Gulf Coast.\n\nUniversity, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Finance.\n\nBush joins his classmates and basketball teammates, track athletes Anthony Shivers (2023) and Zack Wukotich (2024) in the Salem High School Athletic Hall of Fame. The son of Tim and Jane Bush, Bush is currently employed with Pulte Homes as a sales consultant and resides in North Port, Florida, with his fiancee, Ruby Trujillo.\n\nZack Wukotich\n\nSalem High School\n\nClass of 2013\n\nTrack and Field\n\nSeeming to soar to new heights at every opportunity along the way, Zack Wukotich has once again reached the top, this time as a member of the Salem High School Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nA two-time Columbiana County high jump champion, Wukotich especially showcased his exceptional talents throughout his senior year. The Quaker high jumper achieved a jump of 6-6 at regionals, securing a second-place finish and entering the state meet for the first time with the third best jump in the state. With modest expectations, Wukotich achieved a personal best jump of 6-8 at the 2013 Ohio Division II State Meet, earning him the position of state runner-up. The historic moment was witnessed by Coach Todd Huda, who only a mere seconds later was able to watch in awe fellow Quaker Tony Shivers win the state championship in the discus with a state record-breaking throw of over 203 feet.\n\nWukotich became the first Salem jumper to place at the state meet in the high jump since school record holder Tim Cope (SHS Class of 1976 and SHS Athletic HOF 2018) jumped a 6-9.5 at the state meet for a third-place finish. Wukotich further demonstrated his prowess with a fifth-place finish in the summer at the 2013 Midwest Meet of Champions in Indiana with a jump of 6-7.\n\nCollegiately, Wukotich continued his high jump journey at the University of Mount Union, where he achieved more success. He was the Ohio Athletic Conference Indoor high jump champion as a sophomore and senior while earning second place honors as a freshman and fifth place as a junior. He also garnered OAC Outdoor high jump honors with third place finishes as a sophomore and senior. He attained NCAA All-American status three times with a fifth-place finish as a freshman, a sixth-place finish as a sophomore, and a seventh-place finish as a senior. The former Quaker also set a Mount Union school record with a jump of 7-1/4″ (2.14 meters) as a senior, placing him in the top 20 all-time in Division III for indoor track and field.\n\nWukotich joins classmates and fellow athletes Tony Shivers (2023 track) and Ryan Bush (2024 basketball) in the Salem High School Athletic Hall of Fame. The son of Mark Wukotich and Lori Wukotich, he is currently employed with CTM Labeling Systems and resides in Austintown.\n\nCoach Frank Parks\n\n1985-2001, 2013-14\n\nCross Country\n\nCoach Frank Parks, a pillar of Salem High School’s cross country and track programs, left an indelible mark on the school’s athletic history with a coaching career that spanned several decades. Already inducted as coach of the 1993 Boys State Championship cross country team in the inaugural class of the Salem Athletic Hall of Fame in 2005, his individual contributions now receive the recognition they so richly deserve.\n\nCoach Parks led both cross country teams from 1985 to 2001 and then again from 2013 to 2014. His coaching prowess was evident early on, and from 1989 to 1998, he had either the boys’ or girls’ teams at the state meet nine times, with seven of those teams finishing in the top five. In addition to numerous county and conference championships, this remarkable period included the following notable state achievements:\n\n–1989: Girls team finished fourth in the state, with Theresa Kaine (SHS Athletic Hall of Fame Class of 2006) placing fifth overall.\n\n–1990: Boys team finished eighth in the state and Kaine placed ninth overall.\n\n–1991: Boys team finished second in the state, with Mike Rea (SHS Athletic Hall of Fame Class of 2011) finishing second overall and Kris Kornbau (SHS Athletic Hall of Fame Class of 2015) placing seventh. Girls individual team member Amy Heineman placed 25th overall.\n\n–1992: Boys team finished third in the state, with Jason Julian placing ninth overall. Girls individual team member Jenni Brown (SHS Athletic Hall of Fame Class of 2005) became the Division I State Champion, winning by 40 seconds and setting a state record with a time of 17:15, which stood for nearly a decade.\n\n–1993: Boys team won the Division III State Championship (the first team state title in Salem since 1931 Boys Cross Country team), Individual members Julian, Dan Nye, and Mark Rea placed sixth, 12th, and 14th respectively.

Zornick placed third in the 800-meter and Nye placed seventh in the 1600 meter. Brown placed sixth in the 3200-meter girls’ race.\n\n–2000: Bauman placed third in the 1600-meter race.\n\n–2001: Lizzie Jesko (SHS Athletic Hall of Fame Class of 2017) placed eighth in the 100-meter dash.\n\n–2002: Jason Greenamyer placed fifth in the 300-meter hurdles.\n\nCoach Parks’ impact on the Salem community was immeasurable as he spent nearly 50 years as a science teacher at Salem High School. His spirit lives on through the many athletes and students he coached and mentored while helping nurture and guide them to achieve their full potential.\n\nSadly, Parks passed away at the age of 83 in February, leaving behind his wife and fellow coach, Yvonne, their three children, and five grandchildren. He joins many of his former athletes and peers in the Salem High School Athletic Hall of Fame, solidifying his legacy as a transformative figure in Salem athletics forever.\n\n2009 Football Team\n\nThe 2009 Salem High School Football Team is remembered as a juggernaut in the school’s athletic history, achieving unprecedented success and setting numerous records. Under the leadership of first-year head coach Mike Kopachy, the team finished with an impressive 9-3 record, a playoff appearance for the first time in school history, and the most wins in a season since 1960. Their remarkable achievements and trailblazing success captured the hearts of the community and set a new standard for excellence within the Salem High School football program for years to come.\n\nThe season began with a high scoring 42-34 home loss to the eventual 11-1 Girard Indians. However, the Quakers quickly bounced back and found success in a week two 62-16 dominating home victory over United. Despite trailing 14-0 early, Salem scored 62 consecutive points in route of the visiting Eagles. The win snapped an 11-game losing streak, dating back to the 2007 season finale against East Liverpool. The Quakers won again the very next week, defeating rival West Branch 28-26 on the road. After a tough 42-0 loss to eventual 10-2 Hubbard in week four, Salem won their final six games, achieving an 8-2 regular season record (their best performance since 1994) while competing in the All-American Conference White Division.\n\nThe 2009 squad became the first football team in school history to qualify for the postseason, earning the fifth seed in the Ohio Division III Region 11 playoffs (which had expanded to eight teams per region in 1999). In their playoff debut, Salem faced Granville (9-1), who were making their third consecutive postseason appearance. In a dramatic game, trailing 31-28 with only one second remaining, senior Ben Eisel (SHS Athletic Hall of Fame Class of 2022) kicked a 34-yard field goal to send the game into overtime. Junior quarterback Trent Toothman (SHS Athletic Hall of Fame Class of 2021) led the team to a historic 38-31 victory on the road, rushing for over 130 yards and three touchdowns and throwing for another 252 yards and two touchdowns. The first playoff victory in school history resulted in a matchup with defending state runner-up Steubenville the following week. Despite a valiant first half effort where the Quakers found themselves with a 10-6 halftime advantage over the heavily favored Big Red, Salem’s dream season came to an end with a 34-10 loss.\n\nOne of the most successful seasons in school history resulted in many accolades and several new school records established. The Quakers set a new single-season scoring record with 358 total points in twelve games (342 total points in 10 games in 1998). Coach Kopachy was named All-Ohio Division III Coach of the Year and coached in the 2009 Ohio North-South All-Star Game. He led the Quakers to another playoff appearance in 2010, before finishing his tenure at Salem in 2011 with a 22-11 overall record in three years. Toothman set school records for passing yards (2026) in a season and rushed for over 1000 yards, becoming the first player in school history to pass for over 2000 yards and for 1000 yards in a season. He also scored 32 total touchdowns and earned Division III All-Ohio Special Mention. The next year, the dynamic quarterback would set then career school records for touchdown passes (42), rushing touchdowns (37), and passing yards (5400).\n\nEisel, a team captain and wide receiver, set school records for receptions (74), receiving yards (1111), and touchdowns (10) in a season. Career school records achieved included 130 total receptions, 1797 receiving yards, and 17 touchdowns. Defensively, he led the team with five interceptions throughout the season. For his efforts, he was named Division III All-Ohio First Team. Other notable players on the 2009 team who earned First Team All-Conference and All-County honors included sophomore wide receiver Zach Penick, who caught 37 passes for 563 yards and six touchdown, senior linebacker Matt Taylor, who had a team high 73 tackles, and junior defensive lineman Mike King, who led the team with five sacks. Other Quakers earning First Team postseason honors at the conference level included sophomore offensive lineman Steve Manypenny while junior offensive lineman Chad Bash and junior defensive lineman Travis Leyman were named All-County.\n\nRon Pierce\n\nJoe Kelley Spirt of Salem\n\nWith over three decades of coaching experience at the youth level, Ron Pierce has influenced countless young athletes, instilling in them the values of discipline, hard work, and fundamental skills. His dedication and commitment to coaching youth sports in Salem, particularly in the sport of baseball, have helped make him a cornerstone of our athletic community and being named this year’s Joe Kelley Spirt of Salem award winner.\n\nRon Pierce began his youth coaching career at the grassroots level when he coached tee-ball for his son, Tyler, in the early 1990’s. He then advanced to the U8 and U10 coaching levels, where he helped lay the foundation for future Quaker baseball players for years to come.\n\nKnown for his old-school, disciplined approach to coaching, Pierce emphasizes repetition and teaching the fundamentals and basics, believing that mastery of these core skills is essential for athletic success. His philosophy is centered around preparing young athletes for high school and varsity play, viewing all their early experiences as crucial practice. His approach has inspired many young athletes to strive for excellence and to appreciate the value of hard work and dedication.\n\nSharing similar coaching philosophies yet contrasting coaching styles, one of Pierce’s most cherished memories is his 18-year coaching partnership with good friend, Sid Ravelli. Together, they consistently created a strong, cohesive environment for their players.\n\nHis versatility and passion for coaching extended beyond baseball, as Pierce also contributed to the development of young athletes in other sports. He announced and coached for the Little Stars football program and served as an assistant coach, head coach, and equipment manager for the Salem Little Quakers football team. He also briefly coached youth soccer.\n\nRon Pierce’s dedication to youth baseball and his players is evident in the 31 years he has invested as a volunteer. He insists this past season was his last, however, time will tell. What is certain is his impact on the Salem community goes beyond any wins and losses and his commitment to coaching and other significant contributions to Salem’s youth sports will not be forgotten.\n\nPierce resides in Salem with his wife of 42 years, Deb. They have five adult children (all Salem graduates) and eight grandchildren. After retiring in 2006 from a 40-year career at GM Lordstown, Pierce has remained active with Salem schools as a substitute bus driver the past 17 years.\n\nNEWSLETTER\n\nToday's breaking news and more in your inbox"
