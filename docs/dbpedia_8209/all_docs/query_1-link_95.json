        "text": "Hi all. Hope this thread might be of some interest here in this forum, cataloging all the goals and assists from United player since 1987-88 season to today.\n\nI guess lots of stuff can be found on wikipedia or similar sites (http://www.mufcinfo.com/ is awesome in that regard) -- well, not assist stats -- but being in one thread, on our own forum, without the need to go elsewhere, surely cannot be that bad. Will go season by season adding stat tables, and maybe some other stuff, and at the end will post various misc tables.\n\nAnyway...\n\n========================================\n\n1987-88 Brian McClair\n\n1988-89 Mark Hughes\n\n1989-90 Steve Bruce & Gary Pallister\n\n1990-91 Dennis Irwin\n\n1991-92 Ryan Giggs\n\n1992-93 Eric Cantona\n\n1993-94 Roy Keane\n\n1994-95 Lee Sharpe, Andrei Kanchelskis & Paul Ince\n\n1995-96 Paul Scholes\n\n1996-97 Ole Gunnar Solskjær\n\n1997-98 Andy Cole\n\n1998-99 Dwight Yorke & Teddy Sheringham\n\n1999-00 David Beckham\n\n2000-01 Gary & Phil Neville, Nicky Butt\n\n2001-02 Ruud van Nistelrooy\n\n2002-03 Wesley Brown & Mikael Silvestre\n\n2003-04 Cristiano Ronaldo\n\n2004-05 Wayne Rooney\n\n2005-06 Darren Fletcher & John O'Shea\n\n2006-07 Michael Carrick\n\n2007-08 Louis Saha & Carlos Tévez\n\n2008-09 Rio Ferdinand & Nemanja Vidić\n\n2009-10 Patrice Evra & Park Ji-Sung\n\n2010-11 Dimitar Berbatov & Javier Hernández\n\n2011-12 Antonio Valencia & Luis Nani\n\n2012-13 Sir Alex Ferguson\n\n2013-14 Robin van Persie & Danny Welbeck\n\nTop Goalscorers and Assisters of All-time\n\nTop Goalscorers and Assisters at the end of season\n\nCombined Goals and Assists\n\nTop combinations\n\nGiggs, Beckham and Rooney's assist combinations\n\nNon-assisted goalscorers\n\n==============1987-88==============\n\nFirst full season with Sir Alex Ferguson in charge. United finished second in the league, behind only the formidable Liverpool, who won their 17th title with only two losses. League also saw the relegation of Chelsea, which is always nice. For some reason there have been 21 teams in the Division 1 then, though, reason actually might be simple, slow decrease to 20 which happened in 1988-89 and lasts until today (1986-87 had 22 teams).\n\nReached Round 5 in both FA and League Cups, losing 1-2 to Arsenal in former, and 0-2 to Oxford in latter. Couple more years of no Europe for all English teams.\n\nFergie signed three players that season: Viv Anderson, Brian McClair and Steve Bruce. Anderson played more or less regularly in this season, but in next three had just 31 more appearances. McClair's and Bruce's United careers have gone much better.\n\nAbout assists...\n\nBasically, same as today's fantasy footballs and optas and transfermarkts of the world are doing them. Though, with slight differences.\n\n• shot on goal that was saved, blocked, or hit the woodwork, aka 'rebound'\n\n• final pass or shot that makes the opposing player score an own goal\n\n• foul for a free kick or penalty from which the goal is scored (directly from free kick)\n\nAnd of course...\n\n• final pass to a goal scorer\n\nThis is where I slightly differ from others, and with what I think is a bit fairer (or what I just like to believe).\n\n1) After the pass, the scorer has to have three ball touches at most before shooting -- it's a bit arbitrary number, yeah, but feel it's still much better than nonsense such as Fabregas' \"assist\" (second video, at around 5:25) to Hazard in Chelsea's game vs Leicester or last season's Rooney's \"assist\" to RVP in a 4-1 win over Swansea. Feels just silly to brand those as assists, yet, they have been by...some weirdos.\n\n2) If the pass is deflected, often from crosses for example, and the trajectory of the ball is altered by more than 45 degrees, the assist is not given. Less, assist given. 45 ain't bad, right?\n\nNothing official of course, just my take on that.\n\nUsed a lot of season reviews dvds and youtube videos, and Fergie's 2000 goals anthology. It was worth it, as I saw some absolutely brilliant goals, brilliant plays, brilliant passes. In these 27 seasons I did, some situations weren't clear after watching the vidoes, Caftards helped with some, old match reports from BBC, Guardian, Indy, and others helped with others, but still eight situations remained unclear. Think that's not bad, eight in 27 seasons. Anyway, if you think you might help, check this post: https://www.redcafe.net/threads/any-experts-on-1992-93-season.394530/page-2#post-16288685 . All that's left. Completist in me would love to have that done.\n\nNotable departures\n\nPlayer focus\n\nBrian McClair\n\nSir Alex Ferguson's second Manchester United signing. Already a prolific scorer in Scotland, he immediately showed his skill by scoring 31 goals in his debut season. Wasn't as prolific later, but did have two more 20+ seasons. After United, played a year in Motherwell, then went coaching. Been our academy coach in three instances, and currently is an academy director I believe.\n\nAll McClair's goals in 1987-88 season (it's from awesome Fergie's 2000 Goals dvd).\n\n==============1988-89==============\n\nThis was a disappointing season, which saw us finishing in 11th place. The title race itself was extremely close, with Arsenal claiming the title in 91st minute of last game, against direct competition for the title, Liverpool.\n\n6th round of FA Cup and 3rd round of League Cup for us as well.\n\nAlmost signed Gascoigne, but he decided to go to Tottenham instead. We got Mark Hughes back though, and he had an excellent season getting Player of the Year award. Jim Leighton was also an addition, goalkeeper that allowed only 35 goals in the league season, with 15 clean sheets. Fergie also bought 17-year old Lee Sharpe, and gave a debut to another youngling, 19-year old Mark Robins who was with us since 1986.\n\nPlayer focus\n\nMark Hughes\n\nWhen I was watching and re-watching all those United goals for this project, the thought I had in mind seeing Mark Hughes' goals was \"jeez, just how hard was that!\". Never an extremely prolific scorer, but you'll remember his goals. After United played for Chelsea among others, and once playing career was finished, jumped into coaching. Currently manager of mighty Stoke City.\n\nSome of his beauties in first ever highlight video featuring non-crap music.\n\n==============1989-90==============\n\nAnother disappointing league finish, this time 13th, but who cares! WE WON A TROPHY! First one in an amazing career of Sir Alex Ferguson, FA Cup. Heroes -- Mark Robins and Lee Martin. First one not only for his winning goal against Oldham in semi-final replay, but also for a winning goal against Nottingham Forest earlier in the Cup. Apparently, some reporters speculated that defeat then might've been too much for the board who'd be under lots of pressure to release Fergie. As said, speculations, but if there's a bit of truth in it...thanks a bunch, Robins! (if anyone has some more info about that, would love to know it, please share)\n\nLeague Cup again 3rd round reached.\n\nAlso, we were also almost sold for half a Carroll, actually, a whole Downing, right before the start of season.\n\nPlenty of new signings. Gary Pallister, who'll form an immense partnership with Steve Bruce. Paul Ince and Neil Webb, fellow midfielders, with winger Danny Wallace and the one and only Mike Phelan.\n\nNotable departures\n\nPlayers focus\n\nSteve Bruce and Gary Pallister\n\nMan.\n\nBruce is currently manager of Hull, while I'm not sure what's Pallister's been doing lately.\n\n==============1988-89==============\n\nThis was a disappointing season, which saw us finishing in 11th place.

Why have I never heard of this?\n\nI remember those seasons well I had a LMTB at Old Trafford and travelled around a fair bet too.The football was quite dire around the late 80s, we didn't know what was going on in the background regarding scouting and attempting to rebuild the club as Fergie was doing,but on the pitch results were poor. 'Fergie out' and 'Bryan Robson's red and white army' was quite often aired.At the time it seemed only a matter of time before Sir Alex was sacked but that cup run was incredible, I was fortunate enough to get to every game and if ever the term Name on the Cup could be used it was for us that season .\n\nThat Nottingham Forest game where it was said Robins saved Fergie's job we had loads of injuries ( sound familiar ? ) and Jimmy Hill wrpte us off before the game .The team was outstanding on the day and the fans more so cheering the boys on to a famous win.\n\nWould he have been sacked if we'd lost ? I don't think so I think his saving grace was the lack of outstanding candidates to replace him.I think he'd have been relieved of his duties at the end of the season and maybe , with the success that the dippers were enjoying with Dalglish as player manager we may have been tempted to give Robbo a go or maybe have gone for Bobby Robson after that summers exploits in the world cup.\n\nAs it was Robins did score and a dynasty began.\n\nGreat thread by the way must have taken you ages to research this, very interesting, great memories.\n\n==============1990-91==============\n\nMovin' on up. Finished the league in 6th place, even after a deduction of one point for a brawl. Ok, champions that season, Arsenal got a deduction of two points for the same brawl...and still finished 24 points ahead! Our time will come, gunners, no worries. Here's the \"brawl\" btw...\n\nAfter a fantastic FA Cup last season, this time we fell in the third round, but almost won the League Cup. Sheffield Wednesday with Ron Atkinson beat United in the final unfortunately. Still, the season ended on a high. UEFA ban on all English clubs ended, and as the winners of FA Cup last season we were able to play in Cup Winners Cup. First season back in Europe was excellent, Pécsi Munkás, Wrexham, Montpellier, Legia Warsaw and finally Barcelona fell against the mighty Reds.\n\nNotable signings were Dennis Irwin, a full back who could play either on the right or on the left, with a fantastic set piece execution skills, be it free kicks, penalties or corners. Also Les Sealey, goalkeeper who got a permanent contract after already being in United on loan. Though, he left after just one season...maybe for the better, as Big Dane joined next season.\n\nOh yeah, forgot that guy, Ryan Giggs. Got a professional contract, and a debut in this season.\n\nNotable departures\n\nPlayer focus\n\nDennis Irwin\n\nBest ever SAF's signing? At least that's the saying. Nevertheless, he WAS an amazing signing, integral part of 7 times England champion, winner of 3 FA Cups, 1 League Cup, 4 Charity Shields, Champions League and Cup Winners Cup winner, plus he added also Intercontinental and Super Cup in his list of honours. We need more Dennis Irwin groupies.\n\n==============1991-92==============\n\nWe were involved in a fierce battle for championship with Leeds United. On April 18th we were still in first place, with 75 points and four games left to play, while Leeds were behind by two points and had three more games to play. But, as it happened, we lost our next three games, including one against the already relegated West Ham United, while they have won all of theirs. At the end, four points was the difference. We'll never win anything with this squad!\n\nWell, save for League Cup. In the final on Wembley we beat Nottingham Forrest. They'll have the last laugh though, as eight days later, they featured in one of the three mentioned losses above.\n\nIn FA Cup we got only to round 4 (still, beat Leeds in 3rd), and in Europe, Cup Winners Cup, Atletico Madrid eliminated us in second round (Athinaikos was the opponent in first round).\n\nWith League Cup we have won a trophy for a third season in a row, while Gary Pallister and Ryan Giggs won PFA Players' Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year, replicating the success of Mark Hughes and Lee Sharpe from previous season.\n\nBiggest signing of the season was definitely Peter Schmeichel, \"bargain of the century\". He'll stay with United for eight years, with his final game being a Champions League triumph against Bayern Munich. Also signed was Paul Parker, right back, who spent five seasons with United. These days can be seen hatin' on Waybe Rooney.\n\nAnother player was \"new\" this season, Ukranian sensation Andrei Kanchelskis. Though, he was signed in latter half of previous season, and even actually played in next to last game of the season. But in this one he had a \"proper\" debut.\n\nNotable departures\n\nPlayer focus\n\nRyan Giggs\n\nThis whole project started when I saw the post claiming that Giggs had astonishing 284 assists in his career. Surely, that's hogwash, with his goals, how could he be directly responsible for almost 25% of all United goals? Ridiculous. 100-150 at most I'd say. Didn't help that first two seasons I watched and counted the stats were 1992-93 and 1998-99. He had 5 and 7 in those.\n\nNeedless to say, I was dead wrong.\n\nWhat an astonishing career for the most decorated player in MUFC & English football history. I'd say he was the best United player ever. It was popular on Cafe to say that Giggs never reached the highs Bale did for instance. I'll never agree with that. Especially after watching and re-watching his career in the past month or so. Skilled and fast, a real menace to opponents. And he did it for 20+ seasons.\n\nIn the sea of highlight videos, this one really isn't all that bad. More goals oriented though. He was much more than just that.\n\n==============1992-93==============\n\nAnd finally, the long wait is over.\n\nIn the inaugural season of Premier League, Manchester United fought of Aston Villa, Blackburn and Norwich city, to claim the first league title in 26 years. Did it in style, by not losing in last two months, and winning last seven games. One of the most memorable games from that period was against Sheffield Wednesday, where Steve Bruce had two fantastic headers in last few minutes which won the game and put us back in first place in the league. At the end we finished with 10 more points than runner-ups Aston Villa.\n\nCup runs weren't as successful. Round 5 in FA Cup, round 3 in League cup, and first round exit against Torpedo Moscow in UEFA Cup on penalties, after goalless 180 minutes (and I guess 30 more extra time).\n\nNotable signings of the season were Dion Dublin from Cambridge United and Eric Cantona from Leeds United. Dublin didn't have a great United career as couple of weeks after his debut, he suffered a broken leg which sidelined him for six months. After recovery, United already signed Cantona, who established nice partnership with Hughes in front, so Dublin didn't play as much. All in all, two seasons with just 17 appearances. He did quite well for Coventry and Villa afterwards though.\n\nWe'll talk about King Cantona a bit later.\n\nNotable departures\n\nPlayer focus\n\nEric Cantona\n\nSpent just five years at the club before his shock retirement in 1997, but only few United fans wouldn't call him a club legend. Catalyst of our early success and a great leader. Though, not that there weren't problems...but we all know about his long ban from football, no need to post again about it.\n\nHere's 15 minutes of Cantona.\n\n==============1994-95==============\n\nA bit of a miserable end to this season. We were in it for both the league and FA Cup, but first we failed to win at West Ham United (again them - if we won both times, who knows, might've been a 4th title in a row --- then again, would we have seen then the \"can't win with the kids\" season?), making Blackburn the champions, and then in the FA Cup finals, we succumbed to Everton at Wembley 0-1.\n\nBeginning of the season wasn't great as well. First we lost Captain Marvel, Bryan Robson, who went to Middlesbrough to manage and play for them. Clayton Blackmore also left after missing whole 1993-94 season, and finally Mike Phelan left.\n\nLeague Cup saw us reach only round 3, and in an inaugural year of the Champions League, we were 3rd in the group, behind Barcelona and IFK Göteborg who actually headed the group. That's the time when I started supporting United. Glory hunting at its best, saw the 2-2 game with Barcelona, Sharpe's backheel, and just knew that's it.\n\nDavid May was the only signing at the beginning of the season, brought to be an eventual replacement for Steve Bruce. Certain Andrew Cole joined as well, but later, in January. Good timing as couple of weeks later Cantona had a infamous bust-up with the racist Crystal Palace fan.\n\nNotable departures\n\nPlayers focus\n\nLee Sharpe\n\nAndrei Kanchelskis\n\nPaul Ince"
