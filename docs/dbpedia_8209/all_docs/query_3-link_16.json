        "text": "Three-goal hauls at Old Trafford, second-season syndrome and more stats from Martin...\n\nMartin Tyler's stats and facts column continues!\n\nSky Sports' voice of football and his back-up team of experts are here to answer your questions and queries on all things statistical and historical from the Premiership, Football League, international scene or European competitions.\n\nIf you have spotted something from a game or have been stumped by a pub quiz question, simply mail it in and Martin will do his best to answer...\n\nE-mail Martin here with a question\n\nTYLER'S STARTING STAT - WANDERERS' RETURN\n\nI was back at The Emirates for the FA Cup on Sunday to see Bolton extend their unbeaten run against Arsenal to five games, in all competitions. They have won three and drawn two of those and have in fact, only lost one of their last eight games against the Gunners, the 2005 FA Cup quarter-final when El Hadji Diouf was sent off early and Freddie Ljungberg scored the only goal. The game was also a triumph, in a way, for self-confessed Liverpool fan Kevin Nolan, who at least gained some measure of revenge for Arsenal's recent cup wins at Anfield. Having scored the last Bolton goal at Highbury, he has of course, scored their first FA Cup goal at The Emirates.\n\nFAMILY AFFAIR\n\nHi Martin, with Darren Ferguson taking the reins at Peterborough United, I was wondering if this is the first time a father and son have managed in the league at the same time? Dan Higgins, Dartford\n\nMARTIN SAYS: It has happened on at least one occasion before Dan, and not only did the father and son in question manage at the same time, they also came up against each other in a game - albeit in the cup. In the 1970 FA Cup first round, Bill Dodgin Snr took his Bristol Rovers side to Fulham, who were managed by one Bill Dodgin Jnr. For the record dad got the upper hand with a 1-0 win and just to add a personal note, Bill Dodgin Snr took over the local sweet shop where I grew up in West Byfleet and&nbsp;on meeting my father - also a West Byfleet shopkeeper - and hearing about my love for football, promptly gave me a load of football programmes which I still have to this day!\n\nHOME COMFORT\n\nHi Martin, after another weekend of FA cup action, I was wondering whether any team has ever won the trophy having been drawn in home ties in every round (except obviously the semi-final and final) and also whether any team has ever won the trophy without having to play a top flight club? Thanks, Trav\n\nMARTIN SAYS: Well Trav, starting with teams winning the cup without playing top-flight opposition, as far as I can see, it hasn't happened as yet. But there have been a few incidences of clubs making the final without playing top-flight opposition, not least Millwall in 2004, when they finished as runners-up to Manchester United, West Ham (1923), Blackpool (1948) and Bolton (1953). But the closest to the achievement you talk about is probably the Bolton Wanderers side of 1926, who got to the final by beating Accrington Stanley (Div Three North), Bournemouth (Div Three South, after a replay), South Shields (Div Two), Nottingham Forest (Div Two, after two replays and, as they were known then, Swansea Town (Div Two) in the semi-final. But as is often the case, a top-flight team - Manchester City - were their opposition in the final. For the record, Bolton won with a goal from David Jack (his fifth in the cup campaign). As for a team winning the FA Cup having been drawn at home in every round before the semi-finals and final, Manchester United did it in 1999 as part of their treble - although they did have a replay at Stamford Bridge in the quarter-finals. They beat Middlesbrough, Liverpool, Fulham and Chelsea before beating Arsenal in that famous semi-final and Newcastle 2-0 in the final - the Toon also having made it to Wembley on the back of home draws between rounds three and six. In 1956 Birminham reached the final having been drawn away from home, while in 1948, due to bombing damage to Old Trafford in the war, Manchester United played all their 'home' games at Maine Road and went on to win the FA Cup - incidentally the only time a club has done so by beating top-flight opposition in every game.\n\nMIND THE GAP\n\nHi Martin, if I remember correctly not too long ago Manchester United were also 13-15 points clear in the league by January and Arsenal did the double over them to come back and overhaul the gap to win the league by four points. Am I remembering correctly or just having big dreams for a Gunners comeback? Jason, Johannesburg, South Africa\n\nMARTIN SAYS: You are close enough Jason, but in case you get too excited, it was just the 13 points back in 1997-98 and not 15 - and that was in December, not January. Also, to say Arsenal did the double to overhaul Manchester United is not strictly true because they had beaten them in September before that 13-point gap was established. And - sorry to be pedantic - but Arsenal went on to win the Premiership by just a solitary point. That 13-point gap remains the biggest overhaul in Premiership history, eclipsing&nbsp; the12 points United overturned in famously pipping Kevin Keegan's Newcastle side in 1995-96. The gap before Arsenal beat United at The Emirates recently was a whopping 15 points, so they will need to go some way to catch them this year. But keep on dreaming by all means Jason, because they've done it before!\n\nBOLD TRAFFORD\n\nHi there Martin. I was playing Football Manager 2007 earlier and I somehow managed to beat Manchester United 4-2 with my Newcastle team at Old Trafford. I was astonished considering my team were similar to the Newcastle team today - full of injuries - but I was just wondering, how many teams have scored three or more at Old Trafford, and also has anyone from the opposing side ever scored a hat-trick at Old Trafford. Love the column. Jamie Spreng - Edinburgh\n\nMARTIN SAYS: Well, first of all congratulations on your victory Jamie! I have had a quick thumb through the record books and only taking the Premiership years into account - I have to commentate on Wednesday night! - I can tell you that on 10 times visiting Premiership teams have scored three goals in league games at Old Trafford. Strangely enough, two sides, Middlesbrough and Chelsea have managed it three times, while Fulham, Newcastle, Southampton&nbsp;and Everton have also done it, the latter managing three goals in the first ever Premiership game played at Old Trafford. During that same spell, it has happened five times in the Champions League, and York City did it in the League Cup back in 1995. Of those 16 games, Manchester United have lost nine, drawn five and won two - against Newcastle and that famous game against Real Madrid, when Ronaldo scored a hat-trick and was applauded off. As for the last visiting player to score a hat-trick in the league you have to go back to New Year's Day 1991, when Dennis Bailey managed it in QPR's 4-1 win. Since then David Bentley managed it last season and Egil Ostenstad thought he'd done it for Southampton at the Dell in that 6-3 win in October 1996 - only to lose one of his goals to the dubious goals panel. Just for the record, here are those three-goal hauls from the visitors since 1992-93...\n\nTHEATRE OF VISITING DREAMS DATE TEAM RESULT COMPETITION 19th Aug 1992 Everton Won 3-0 Premiership 20th Oct 1993 Galatasaray Drew 3-3 Champions League 20th Sept 1995 York City Won 3-0 League Cup 5th May 1997 Middlesbrough Drew 3-3 Premiership 16th Sept 1998 Barcelona Drew 3-3 Champions League 19th Dec 1998 Middlesbrough Won 3-2 Premiership 25th Sept 1999 Southampton Drew 3-2 Premiership 19th April 2000 Real Madrid Won 3-2 Champions League 23rd Sept 2000 Chelsea Drew 3-3 Premiership 17th Oct 2001 Deportivo La Coruna Won 3-2 Champions League 1st Dec 2001 Chelsea Won 3-0 Premiership 23rd Nov 2002 Newcastle Lost 3-5 Premiership 23rd Apr 2003 Real Madrid Lost 3-4 Champions League 25th Oct 2003 Fulham Won 3-1 Premiership 11th Feb 2004 Middlesbrough Won 3-2 Premiership 10th May 2005 Chelsea Won 3-0 Premiership"
