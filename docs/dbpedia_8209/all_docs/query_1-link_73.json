        "text": "Manchester United's recent collapse is a major cause for concern, and it's unlikely to get any better soon with a trip to Anfield to take on Liverpool up next.\n\nUnited lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich on Tuesday and were ultimately dumped out of the Champions League, finished bottom of Group A.\n\nAnd now their next clash against Liverpool on Merseyside could not come at a worse time, it seems.\n\nIt is certainly not a happy hunting ground for Man United, who were demolished 7-0 on enemy territory last season.\n\nThe Reds ran riot and the result inflicted United's joint-heaviest ever competitive loss, their biggest defeat since December 1931.\n\nAnother worry is the lack of goals Erik ten Hag's side has managed against Jurgen Klopp's troops away from home over the years.\n\nMan United have, in fact, not scored in their last four trips to Anfield - their joint longest run of matches without an away league goal against any opponent since the 1970s.\n\nThe last time they did find the net at Anfield was a 3-1 loss, and it spelled the end of Jose Mourinhoâ€™s reign as United manager almost five years ago to the day in 2018.\n\nAnother heavy defeat and, who knows, perhaps Ten Hag's days in the Red Devils dugout are over, with what could be the final nail in the coffin for his Old Trafford reign.\n\nEven more worryingly, United are facing a rampant Liverpool side led by an in-form Mohamed Salah, fresh off the back of scoring his 200th goal for the club in Liverpool's 2-1 comeback win over Crystal Palace.\n\nThe 31-year-old is also on a run of 16 successive home matches in which he has either netted or assisted a goal.\n\nA goal or assist on Sunday would make that run the second-longest in Premier League history, behind Alan Shearer for Blackburn from March 1995 to February 1996.\n\nSalah has managed 12 goals against United - more than he has netted against any other opponent and the most by any Liverpool player against them.\n\nUnited will no doubt need to brace themselves for what could be yet another potential drubbing at the hands of their fiercest enemy."
