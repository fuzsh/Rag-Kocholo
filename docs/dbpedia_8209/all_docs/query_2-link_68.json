        "text": "The kit is exactly as pictured with really nice badges. I order one size up and it´s perfect. Shipping time was little bit longer, but not to much.\n\nI´m satisfied with my order and I only can recommend the others!\n\nI did encounter a few concerned reviewers who had voiced concerns that left some hesitation - I was happy to find out they were wrong (at least for us)!\n\nThe kit came exactly as advertised with quality crest, sponsor and adidas logos. Sizing was also framed correctly and we ordered a size up as recommended. (For us, just one size above the normal was enough to achieve the ‘retro’ look). Shipping may take longer than other sites but the tracking information kept us informed while in transit. And given the quality of the product I had no problem waiting for arrival.\n\nVery happy with the kit - much recommended!\n\nThe appearance of the jersey is indeed highly authentic. The advertisements and numbers are of high-quality craftsmanship. However, a downside is that the jersey is quite thin, resulting in a less satisfactory texture when worn. Disappointingly, the Premier League arm badge is of poor quality and disproportionately small.\n\nAdditionally, the size chart for the jersey is not very accurate, leading to the delivered jersey being wider than expected. Moreover, the shipping was quite slow, taking three to four weeks to receive the jersey. This makes me hesitant about making another purchase."
