Since then, 25 players have won it as of the 2021/2022 season.\n\nHow is the Golden Boot winner decided?\n\nThe PL Golden Boot award goes to the player with the most goals at the end of a season. However, two or more players can share the prize if they tie on goals. The accolade has been shared four times since its inception. Meanwhile, in tournaments like the World Cup, when players score the same goals, assists are used to determine the winner.\n\nA list of footballers with 500 or more goals: Goal-scoring machines\n\nFootball\n\nFirst 10 Golden Boot winners in Premier League\n\nTeddy Sheringham was the first player to win the award in the 1992/93 season.

Jamie Vardy - 1\n\nThe English striker was one of the stars behind Leicester City's Premier League triumph in the 2015/2016 season.

Alan Shearer - 3\n\nPortugal World Cup Squad 2022: Is Cristiano Ronaldo playing this World Cup?\n\nFootball\n\nShearer, an inductee into the Premier League Hall of Fame, is considered the best EPL striker of his generation.

Wayne Rooney is second with 208, while Harry Kane is closing in with 200 as of 6 February 2023.\n\n3. Mohamed Salah - 3\n\nThe Liverpool winger won the EPL top scorer award in 2017/2018, 2018/2019, and 2021/2022 seasons. His 32 goals in the 2017/2018 season put him among the highest scorers in a league season. Salah's Golden Boot record makes him one of the best strikers in PL history. He also won one EPL title and a Champions League with the Reds.\n\n2. Harry Kane - 3\n\nDespite winning three Golden Boot awards (2015-16, 2016-17, 2020-21), Kane is yet to lift a trophy with his club, Tottenham Hotspurs. He has excellent passing and playmaking skills, making him one of the best strikers of his generation.

Harry Kane is following closely with 16 goals in 21 games, while Brentford's Ivan Toney has 13 in 18 appearances.\n\nMany football fanatics expect Haaland to break the Premier League record for most goals in a season (34) by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer. The City striker only needs to score ten goals in the 18 matches to eclipse the mark.\n\nGermany World Cup squad 2022: Which players will be representing Germany this World Cup?\n\nFootball\n\nAs observed, the list of Golden Boot winners in the Premier League history consists of purely strikers and forwards.
