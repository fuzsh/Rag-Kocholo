        "text": "1990/92\n\n1990/91 was a disappointing season for the red devils, Alex Ferguson was in his 4th year in charge and only had 1 FA cup to his name. Manchester United finished 6th that season with defender Steve Bruce finishing top scorer for United in the league along with Brian McClair on 13.\n\nThe club wore the same kits across these two seasons, with that iconic blue and white Adidas originals away shirt. This away shirt was notably worn in the 6-2 win at Arsenal, and the 1992 League Cup final, where a goal from Brian McClair helped United beat Notts Forest 1-0 at Wembley after losing to Sheffield Wednesday in the final the previous season. The Home Shirt was a classic red kit with subtle graphics on the front which was very ahead of its time for the early 90s.\n\n91/92 The side were playing much better football, just missing out on the league title to Leeds by 5 points. Key to their improvement was unknown danish signing Peter Schmeichel who went on to make 40 appearances in his debut season and helped the side concede just 33 goals, the best in the league.\n\n1992/93\n\nThe 1992/93 season is where Manchester United started their all out assault on Silverware winning the english first division for the first time in 26 years and the first ever edition of the English Premier League, beating out Aston Villa & Norwich.\n\nThe club changed jersey manufacturers with Umbro taking over from adidas. They went with a red lace up collared home shirt with the white Sharp sponsor and opting for another blue away shirt, this time a blue and black design with a black collar opposed to the use of white the previous season. These shirts were Eric Cantona’s first with the red devils having joined from Leeds, the first person to do so for 9 years.\n\nThe club also introduced the famous gold and green third shirt based on one of the first jerseys the club wore in the 1800s when they were known as Newton Heath. The jersey was worn as Cantona scored with a fantastic first touch and volley against Wimbledon in the FA Cup.\n\n1993/94\n\nThe 1993/94 season saw Manchester United use the same Home and 3rd kits, but adopting a new away Jersey. For the first time ever United went with a black away shirt which was made famous by Eric Cantona the next year. The shirt was a black base with yellow and blue accents on the collar and sleeve\n\nManchester United went back to back at the beginning of the premier league, helped by the most expensive english club signiner ever Roy Keane costing 3.7 Million Euros. United beat out Alan Shearer and Blackburn to retain their Champions status with Catona scoring 18 goals for the season.\n\n1994/95\n\nManchester United changed up their home and 3rd kits for the 94/95 season, ditching the lace but keeping a collar on the home and having a design of Old Trafford on the back and front.\n\nThe new 3rd kit was another blue and white design, pulling inspiration from the 90-92 away jersey, the jersey also had every player's name to play for the club watermarked on it. The away kit was the same as the previous year, and Eric Cantona gave us another Iconic moment, this time for the wrong reasons, jumping into the crowd and kung fu kicking a fan.\n\nUnited weren’t able to win three titles in a row, missing out by 1 point to Blackburn Rovers thanks to a 34 goal season from Alan Shearer.\n\n1995/96\n\nThe 1995/96 Premier League season saw the introduction of one of the most infamous jerseys in the club's history. The new away kit was only ever worn for one half before Sir Alex Ferguson told the players to take it off because he thought they were invisible in it.\n\nUnited continued with the same home and 3rd kits for the 95/96 season, becoming the first side to ever win the FA Cup and League double twice. Ferguson had used the likes of Beckham, Gary & Phil Neville, and Paul Scholes for the first time regularly this season.\n\n1996/97\n\nThe 1996/97 jerseys are some of the most recognisable in the club's history. The red home jersey had a button up collar, with the club crest moving into the middle for the first time since the 80s. The home shirt is probably most famous for the Cantona chip against Sunderland and his iconic celebration.\n\nUnited went for traditional colours for their away and 3rd jerseys with white and blue respectively. David Beckham won the PFA young player of the year and Ole Gunnar Solskjær had a breakout season scoring 19 goals as United won another title.\n\n1997/98\n\nIn 1997/98 the club kept the same Home and 3rd Jerseys, switching up the away, adding more details to the relatively plain white jersey from the previous season. The club looked well on track for a third premier league title in a row, with a 12 point gap between them and 2nd place Arsenal.\n\nArsene Wenger's men went on a 10 game winning streak to pip Manchester United by a point. This was United’s first season without captain Cantona with Roy Keane picking up the Armband.\n\n1998/99\n\nThe 1998/99 season is seen as one of the greatest seasons of all time by an English side. United completed the treble, winning the League, FA Cup and Champions League. United competed in the league with a new Home jersey and third Jersey. The Home kit was complete with a zip up collar, and Umbro shoulder tape, giving us one of the most Iconic kits of the premier league era.\n\nThe Away Jersey remained the same as last season with the club going with a black 3rd shirt with green accents, a nod to their Newton Heath past.\n\nThe red devils also wore a special European shirt in the Champions League with a gold crest. The club wore this Jersey in their historic win over Bayern Munich in the final of the competition, injury time goals from Sheringham and Solskjær sealed a historic treble for United.\n\n1999/00\n\nUnited kept the same home shirt for the 99/00 season after having so much success in it the previous season, the Umbro kit did the business again with United grabbing another Premier League title.\n\nManchester United did switch up the Away and 3rd shirts, going with an unusual dark navy Away Jersey with white stripes and a relatively plain white & navy 3rd shirt.\n\nUnited won their 6th league title in 8 years, as Dwight Yorke banged in another 24 goals for the season and Aussie shot stopper Mark Bosnich was back between the sticks for United having impressed at Villa.\n\n2000/01\n\nManchester United started the new millennium with new jerseys and an all new sponsor for the first time in nearly 20 years. Vodafone had taken over from Sharp on the front of all the new Umbro Jerseys with a fairly traditional red home jersey with a black & white collar & sleeve cuffs. The Away Jersey was essentially just the 3rd jersey from the previous season with a change of sponsor and the 3rd was a nice navy and red design.\n\nUnited picked up the 2000s where they left off in the 90s, grabbing a 3rd premier league title in a row. Teddy Sheringham had well and truly found form at United, scoring 21 goals in all competitions.\n\n2001/02\n\nThe 01/02 season was a disappointing one for Manchester United, finishing 3rd which was remarkably their lowest finish in premier league history at the time. One of the few positives that season was Ruud Van Nistelrooy who came in and netted 36 times in all competitions following his 19 Million EUro move from PSV.\n\nUnited kept the same Home shirt but went all out with the away and 3rd shirt, combining them in a reversible design. The Away Shirt was White & Navy and when turned inside out revealed the gold design of the 3rd shirt.\n\n2002/03\n\nManchester United returned for the 2002/03 season 3 fresh kits and a new kit manufacturer. The first Nike Home was a much more modern design but not dissimilar to the previous years, using a red base with black accents and a white vodafone sponsor logo. The away shirt featured a smart black collar with touches of red along with a traditional all blue 3rd shirt.\n\nThe Red Devils had a much better season than last, regaining the title off of Arsenal with Van Nistelrooy smashing in another 44 goals in all competitions. This was David Beckham's last season at the club after having a dressing room bust up with Sir Alex which ended up with a boot to the head for becks.\n\n2003/04\n\nNo changes to the Home shirt were made this season, as it was common for a home jersey to last 2 seasons at the time. The club did get a new away & 3rd shirt though, going with an all black away kit and a white 3rd Jersey with thin red and black stripes.\n\nUnited slipped back down to 3rd place being bested by the Arsenal Invincibles side. The club did however win the FA cup for an 11th time, beating Tim Cahill and his Millwall side in the final. Van Nistelrooy reached 30 goals in all competitions for a 3rd successive season and the club signed a young Portuguese winger named Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\n2004/05\n\nNike used the t90 template for the new Manchester United Home Jersey, which was also used for clubs like Arsenal, Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund. The United version was a red base with touches of white around the neckline and left sleeve.\n\nThe 2004/05 season was a disaster for United, finishing trophyless for just the fourth time in the Premier League. The club did find a positive this season though, with teenage new signing Wayne Rooney finishing top scorer for the club.\n\n2005/06\n\nNike added the t90 template to Manchester United’s away shirt with a predominantly blue Jersey with touches of red, the club kept the same white jersey for the 3rd kit, introduced in 03/04. This would be United's 3rd season without a Premier League title, finishing second behind Jose’s Chelsea outfit.\n\nThe club did pick up a trophy this season though, beating Wigan 4-0 in the League Cup final with goals from Rooney & Ronaldo with the young duo starting to dominate English football.\n\n2006/07\n\nNike introduced all new kits for 06/07 with a classy red gold and white home kit using a retro inspired badge and included a new shirt sponsor with AIG replacing Vodafone. The away jersey was a white, gold and black version of the away and the club stuck with a blue & red 3rd kit.\n\nThis was the season Cristiano Ronaldo announced himself to the world stage, scoring 23 goals for the season and picking up the numerous individual awards including the PFA player of the year & young player of the year. The Rooney & Ronaldo combination fired United to their first Title in 4 seasons beating Jose’s Chelsea by 6 points.\n\n2007/08\n\nThe new home shirt for the 07/08 season was a classic all red design with a white Nike swoosh & AIG sponsor. The Home Jersey came with a new black Away Jersey, keeping the white away shirt from last year as this year's 3rd kit.\n\nUnited enjoyed a fantastic season, completing a Champions League & Domestic League double. The Premier League season went right down to the wire, with United piping Chelsea by 2 points thanks to 31 league goals from Cristiano Ronaldo. The two English sides also battled it out in the Champions League final, with John Terry famously slipping and missing his penalty, gifting United the trophy.\n\n2008/09\n\nIn the 2008/09 season the club received new away & 3rd jerseys. The all blue 3rd shirt commemorated the 40th anniversary of the clubs first European cup win against Benfica with the date embroidered around the club crest.\n\nThe club won another Premier League Title in the red Nike home jersey, finishing 4 points ahead of rivals Liverpool. United also nearly became the first club since Milan in the 90s to win back to back European cups however they lost to Guardiola’s Barcelona 2-0 in the final thanks to Leo Messi.\n\n2009/10\n\nNike produced one of the biggest changes we’ve seen to a United Home jersey, adding a black v across the chest of the otherwise all red home shirt. The Away Jersey featured the same design except with a black base and blue V. The 3rd jersey for this season was last year's away Jersey.\n\nThis was Manchester United's first season without Cristiano Ronaldo, following his record move to Real Madrid. Wayne Rooney was determined to make up for Ronaldo’s absence, scoring 26 goals in the league. United finished just 1 point behind Chelsea in the premier league but won the League cup, beating Aston Villa 2-1 in the final.\n\n2010/11\n\nThe 10/11 season was Manchester United’s first with new shirt sponsors AON after four years with AIG. Along with the new sponsor were new home and away shirts from Nike, both receiving a major change up. The Home jersey ditched the black V and introduced a classy white collar and white taping down the sleeves for a smart looking home shirt. The Away was a white base with black and red patches on the sleeves completing a very nice jersey set.\n\nTo go along with the very nice jerseys was some very nice football, with United clinching the title over Chelsea. Rooney also produced one of the most iconic premier league moments in the home jersey, scoring a bicycle kick against Manchester City in the derby. The club also made it to the final of the Champions League, losing to Barcelona for the 2nd time in 3 years.\n\n2011/12\n\nNike stripped the United home jersey right back for the 11/12 season, it was just a red base with a smart white and black collar. The Away Jersey was a blue and black striped number, pulling inspiration for the 92/93 Away shirt. Wayne Rooney enjoyed his best goal scoring season in the Premier League in these Jerseys, smashing in 27 goals for the season, 3 behind golden boot winner Robin Van Persie.\n\nThe 2011/12 season was one of the most exciting ever, with Manchester United thinking they had wrapped up the title after beating Sunderland and Manchester City trailing to QPR. Stoppage time goals from Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero snatched the title out of United’s clutches and denied them of a 20th Premier League trophy.\n\n2012/13\n\nNike gave us another memorable home jersey for the 12/13 season with chequered design for Sir Alex Ferguson's last season in charge. The Home shirt was combined with an all white away jersey with red collar & sleeve cuffs. United signed last season's golden boot winner, Robin Van Persie for a massive tilt at the title.\n\nManchester United bounced back from their disappointment the previous season, with van Persie firing them to their 20th league title. Following their league triumph, Ferguson announced his retirement as the most successful manager in the history of football with 38 trophies.\n\n2013/14\n\nThe 2013/14 season saw Nike introduce another two fresh jerseys, the home shirt with a button up black collar and the away jersey another blue and black shirt, this time a chequered design, similar to the previous seasons home jersey.\n\nThis season saw the Champions suffer a dramatic fall from grace under David Moyes, finishing 7th which was their worst performance in the league since the 80s. Wayne Rooney continued his goalscoring form, scoring another 27 goals in all competitions.\n\n2014/15\n\nNike had their last season with Manchester United in 2014/15, giving us three new kits. It was also the first season for new shirt sponsor Chevrolet The Home Jersey had similarities to last season, but with just a single button up collar and black and white sleeve cuffs. The Away Jersey was all white with a black collar and the 3rd kit was all blue.\n\nLouis Van Gaal took over at United after David Moyes and restored them to the champions league places. This was the first season since 89/90 that Manchester United did not compete in any european competition after their disappointing finishing the previous season.\n\n2015/16\n\nadidas were back with Manchester United after spending over 20 years apart. The first 3 Jerseys back with the club were well received, with the home having white sleeve cuffs and the three stripes running down the shoulder. The Away was a white & red version and the 3rd black & red, probably the pick of the bunch.\n\nDisappointment in the league continued for United finishing 5th, 15 points off title winners Leicester. The Red Devils did however have some domestic success, winning the FA Cup for a 12th time, thanks to a Jesse Lingard extra-time goal.\n\n2016/17\n\n2016/17 saw adidas introduce a bit of a boring gradient red home kit. The Away kit however was much nicer, with a blue & black mixed base again taking inspiration from the 92/93 Umbro jersey. It was a mixed bag of jerseys this season, with the 3rd kit being white & grey with a honeycomb pattern on the sleeve which was not well received.\n\nThe 2016/17 season also saw the introduction of ex Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho. He led the side to the League Cup, Europa League & Community shield trophies, giving him a treble of sorts. It was another poor finish in the league however, finishing 6th with Zlatan Ibrahimovic leading the goal scoring with 28 in all competitions. The 16/17 season was Wayne Rooney’s last at the club, leaving the club as the all time leading goal scorer, 5 time Premier League Champion and having won the Champions League.\n\n2017/18\n\nadidas produced probably their best two home & away jerseys of their second stint with the club so far. The home jersey was super clean with white & black sleeve cuffs and a two button up collar. The Away was the best kit of the lot, a black base with the iconic all-over pattern from the 1990-92 away jersey. The 3rd jersey was part of a competition from adidas to design the kit and they went with a graphic of the trinity statues on a light grey shirt.\n\nIn 2017/18 United enjoyed their best points tally & highest finish since Sir Alex Ferguson placing 2nd, 19 points behind Manchester City. Despite a decent league placing, the club failed to win any silverware this season.\n\n2018/19\n\nThe Jerseys for the 2018/19 season were strange. The Home Jersey was probably the worst the brand had produced for the club, with a bizarre black and red design base. The away shirt wasn't much better, with pink being used for the first time in the club's history. The third jersey wasn’t too bad, a navy and gold design made from ocean plastic with the adidas parley logo.\n\nThe 18/19 season was a bit of a disaster for the red devils, slipping down to 6th place, making it 6 years without a Premier League Trophy. They were knocked out in the early rounds of the League Cup and the quarter finals of both the FA cup & Champions League. With just 7 wins from the first 17 games, Jose was sacked and replaced with club legend Ole Gunnar Solskjær.\n\n2019/20\n\nThe Home Jersey for 2019/20 was a beauty, paying homage to the 99/00 treble winners kit being the 20th anniversary. The jersey came with an all new gold and black badge, with the date of the treble achievements on the side of the jersey. The minutes of the famous stoppage time goals against Bayern Munich scored by Sheringham and Solskjær can also be found on the bottom of the jersey. The away jersey was a plain beige colour with a mosaic pattern inspired by the mosaics that can be found in Manchester's creative district. The third shirt was also a great kit, a black base with a rose pattern, inspired by the Manchester rose, which was worn when the club won the 1909 FA Cup final.\n\nDespite the good looking jerseys, Manchester United had their third trophyless season in a row, the first time that had occurred since 1989. The club were knocked out in the Semi-Finals of the League Cup, FA Cup and Europa League. The Red Devils finished 3rd in the league, just the 33 points behind Liverpool.\n\n2020/21\n\nThe 2020/21 Home Jersey was inspired by the club crest itself, with a yellow and black fabric print on top of the red base. The name of the club is also subtly printed into the shirt, visible through the use of different tones of red. The away shirt was dark green colour based supposedly based on away fan journeys using a range of transport, and the feeling of togetherness when joining other fellow supporters on the road. adidas went all out for the 3rd kit, creating the infamous ‘zebra’ design. The black and white striped shirt was based off of Jersey’s the club wore in the early 1900s.\n\nUnited improved on last year, finishing 2nd in the league behind Manchester City. The club were also runners up in the Europa League, losing to Villareal in the final. The Red Devils were also knocked out in the latter stages of the domestic cups, making it 4 years without a trophy. Bruno Fernandes had his first full season with the club and finished top scorer with 28 in all competitions.\n\n2021/22\n\nAhead of the new season adidas and Manchester United have unveiled all new Home and Away Jerseys with an all new shirt sponsor, TeamViewer. The Home Shirt is a red striped design which references the first time adidas and Manchester United teamed up in the 80s. The White collar and thick white sleeve cuffs also reference the side of the 1960s which became champions of Europe.\n\nThe Away Jersey is another reference to the Iconic 1991/92 Away shirt. The famous snowflake design is reworked into a blue and white optical art pattern which is engineered into the fabric. This is the second time in recent memory we've seen a remake of the 91/92 shirt with Pharrell using it for inspiration in his 20/21 Human Race collection.\n\nWill these Jersey's be the ones that United break their almost decade long title drought in? Or will it be four trophyless seasons in a row for Manchester United?\n\nShare this:"
