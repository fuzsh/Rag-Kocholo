        "text": "The AFC includes a who’s who of quarterbacks — Josh Allen, Tua Tagovailoa, Aaron Rodgers, Lamar Jackson, Joe Burrow, C.J. Stroud, Justin Herbert … and that Patrick Mahomes fella. So if you’re an AFC defense, you might want to stack up as many quality cornerbacks as humanly possible to at least attempt to slow down these opposing passers.\n\nPer normal, some teams have done a better job than others heading into the 2024 NFL season. The good in the AFC comes from teams like the New York Jets and Cleveland Browns. The not so good? Well, the numbers below should tell that story.\n\nI dissected the cornerback groups across the league in my latest positional study, with this post focused on the AFC.\n\nHere’s a look at the statistics (via TruMedia, Pro Football Focus and Pro Football Reference) for each team and player:\n\nDefensive production rating\n\nOpposing passer rating\n\nPass breakups (PBU) or passes defended\n\nInterceptions\n\nTouchdowns allowed\n\nThe player rankings come for those who had at least 200 pass coverage snaps in 2023. The blue shades in the graphics point toward stronger statistics; red points toward weaker statistics.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nHow do AFC pass rush groups stack up heading into the 2024 season?\n\nAFC East\n\nBuffalo Bills\n\nRasul Douglas tallied four of his five 2023 interceptions with the Bills after a midseason trade from Green Bay. And he improved from a 109.0 passer rating allowed in seven games with the Packers to 38.6 in nine games in Buffalo. Christian Benford also held his own last season, in his first year as a full-time starter. Then there’s Taron Johnson, who earned a second-team All-Pro nod — even without an interception.\n\nNow, does 2022 first-round pick Kaiir Elam fit in the picture? If he does, it’s likely only for depth at this point given his rough two-year stretch.\n\nMiami Dolphins\n\nJalen Ramsey needed just half a season to rightfully earn another Pro Bowl bid in 2023, after coming back from a knee injury suffered in training camp. With Xavien Howard still unemployed as a free agent, the Dolphins will turn to Kendall Fuller as the primary starter opposite Ramsey. Fuller struggled mightily last season, with a glaring opposing passer rating (120.4). In 2022, that number was 87.1, which tracked along the same line as the previous two seasons.\n\nMiami will gamble that last year was a fluke for Fuller. Same goes for Kader Kohou, who tallied an 81.7 rating allowed as a rookie in 2022.\n\nNew England Patriots\n\nThe return of 2023 first-rounder Christian Gonzalez should make this group a whole lot better. Before a labrum injury ended his rookie season, he picked off one pass and allowed an 86.1 passer rating in four games. Marcus Jones returns, too, after a shoulder injury limited him to two games — he had a stellar rookie campaign in 2022 (two interceptions, 75.4 opposing passer rating).\n\nThose setbacks left Jonathan Jones in a bit of heap last year, so the return of the young duo will help the typically stable veteran. I’d expect the ugly charts above to calm down in 2024.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nPatriots training camp: One thought so far on every defensive player\n\nNew York Jets\n\nAdd it all up and the Jets possess one of the better cornerback trios in the league. Sauce Gardner saw his opposing passer rating increase a bit, up from a 62.7 mark his rookie season, but he was still All-Pro material. D.J. Reed has halted his trend of being on a new team every third season, and the seven-year veteran is coming off another good showing.\n\nPlus, here’s a look at Michael Carter II’s opposing passer ratings from his first three seasons, starting in 2021: 100.9, 75.3, 70.6.\n\nAFC North\n\nBaltimore Ravens\n\nMarlon Humphrey headlines the deepest group in football — and the Ravens are hoping injuries calm down for the three-time Pro Bowler. Brandon Stephens certainly excelled in a starting role last season. His opposing passer ratings from 2021 to 2023: 128.8, 88.9, 80.6.\n\nThen, take your pick at nickel with either Arthur Maulet, Kyle Hamilton, Ar’Darius Washington or Damarion Williams. Maulet’s opposing passer rating improved by nearly 40 points after he posted a 105.5 rate with Pittsburgh in 2022. Where does 2024 first-rounder Nate Wiggins play? Options aplenty for Baltimore.\n\nCincinnati Bengals\n\nThe output for Cam Taylor-Britt points to possible Pro Bowl status, if he can maintain similar production and stay healthy. It started getting shaky for 2023 second-rounder DJ Turner around Week 14 last season, including a perfectly imperfect 158.3 opposing passer rating against Minnesota in Week 15.\n\nMoving safety Dax Hill to cornerback will be an interesting twist — he’ll challenge Turner. Meanwhile, Mike Hilton only gets better with age. His past three passer ratings allowed, by year: 99.8 (2021), 78.8 (2022), 66.5 (2023).\n\nGO DEEPER\n\n2024 fantasy football draft kit: Rankings, cheat sheet, player projections, sleepers and more\n\nCleveland Browns\n\nGet to know Martin Emerson Jr., a 2022 third-round pick. With 29 passes defensed in two seasons, he’s already molded into a defender you might not want to test. That’s saying something, given the Browns already employ Denzel Ward and Greg Newsome II (even though Newsome hasn’t practiced yet during training camp because of a hamstring injury). It’s incredible that Ward’s highest single-season opposing passer rating isn’t north of 80.0 (2023 was his best season, FYI).\n\nI mentioned the Jets as one of the better trios in the league. This one in Cleveland might actually be the best. Enjoy this group, Browns fans.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\n\nJoey Porter Jr. started making his own name in Pittsburgh with a solid rookie season in 2023. Here’s a glimpse at Porter’s opposing passer ratings in weeks 13-18: 46.9, 77.9, 56.2, 74.6, 89.0, 39.6.\n\nCameron Sutton’s eight-game suspension will leave the Steelers with an obvious void, even though his opposing passer rating skyrocketed in Detroit last year, up from a 65.3 mark with Pittsburgh in 2022. His absence likely will force the Steelers to ride with Donte Jackson, who’s coming off the worst opposing passer rating of his career.\n\nAFC South\n\nHouston Texans\n\nNo “saucy” nickname — just shutdown corner play from Derek Stingley Jr. last season. Stingley playing in just 20 regular-season games over two years, though, understandably leads to durability question marks.\n\nThe rest of those numbers in the chart show why Houston took Kamari Lassiter in Round 2 of April’s draft. Lassiter is challenging first-round picks turned vagabonds Jeff Okudah and C.J. Henderson for the starting job. Optimally, it will be Lassiter’s. Okudah wasn’t awful the past two years, split between Detroit and Atlanta, but there’s a reason why this will be his third team in three seasons.\n\nIndianapolis Colts\n\nKenny Moore II’s stats are a mixture of “Wow!” and “Whoa!” — three interceptions (two returned for touchdowns) and five TDs allowed, which accounts for the disparity between the slot corner’s defensive production and opposing passer ratings.\n\nJulius Brents, a 2023 second-round pick, played only nine games last season. He yielded a 158.3 opposing passer rating in Week 18 against Houston, which dampened a previously solid rating. Jaylon Jones, a 2023 seventh-round pick, seems primed to start after an up-and-down rookie season. The Colts added 2024 Day 3 picks Jaylin Simpson and Micah Abraham.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\n\nTyson Campbell recently hit the cornerback jackpot, earning a lucrative contract extension heading into Year 4. His Year 3 opposing passer rating could raise a red flag, however, even though he battled a lingering hamstring issue that sidelined him for six games — his rating was 50.5 points better in 2022 (78.0).\n\nThe Jags will be Ronald Darby’s fourth team in five seasons. Still, an opposing passer rating hovering below 70.0 in each of the last two seasons (69.9 in five games with Denver in 2022) shouldn’t be dismissed. Jacksonville also drafted Jarrian Jones and Deantre Prince.\n\nTennessee Titans\n\nThe Titans essentially tore down their cornerback group by adding L’Jarius Sneed and Chidobe Awuzie. Given the red splattered across the chart, the reconstruction was very necessary. Sneed is coming off arguably his best NFL season last year. Awuzie? Not as much — his 2022 opposing passer rating (53.4) was 60 points better than last year’s performance. He’s been dealing with a calf injury to start camp.\n\nHoldover Roger McCreary improved mightily in Year 2 of his career, with a 20-plus-point improvement in opposing passer rating from Year 1. He allowed no TDs last season after surrendering six in 2022.\n\nAFC West\n\nDenver Broncos\n\nPat Surtain II has become a little more vulnerable since his outstanding rookie season. His opposing pass rating allowed has climbed from 61.3 to 82.6 in 2022 and then 88.2 in 2023. He’s still one of the best players on the Broncos’ roster, without question.\n\nThe Broncos snagged former Steelers corner Levi Wallace in free agency, and he brings the most experience for the wide-open No. 2 job. Before last season, Wallace yielded opposing passer ratings of 72.6 in 2021 and 73.0 in 2022. But Riley Moss and Damarri Mathis should compete for the starting job, with Ja’Quan McMillian primed for the nickel role.\n\nKansas City Chiefs\n\nMoving on from Sneed puts a heavy emphasis on Trent McDuffie to become the undisputed top cornerback in Kansas City. He carries with him a first-team All-Pro accolade from last season. The 2022 first-rounder certainly is a disruptor on defense, but Kansas City should hope for better coverage rates.\n\nBehind him, there’s a slew of contenders vying to replace Sneed, including Joshua Williams and Jaylen Watson. Meanwhile, Nazeeh Johnson might be the starter opposite McDuffie if he’s able to fully recover from the ACL tear he suffered in last year’s camp.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nScoop City: What you should know from training camps today\n\nLas Vegas Raiders\n\nThe Raiders should be pleased with their midseason acquisition of Jack Jones. The corner produced a 63.0 opposing passer rating in seven games in Las Vegas, a far different story than his five games in New England last season (106.1 rate).\n\nNate Hobbs is a given to man the nickel spot once again. The role opposite Jones seems wide-open, with Jakorian Bennett and Brandon Facyson squarely in the midst of the position battle. Bennett’s numbers in the chart aren’t very encouraging, while Facyson played only 44 defensive snaps in 2023 because of a shin injury.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers\n\nAsante Samuel Jr. has improved every season, becoming the Chargers’ top cornerback heading into Year 4 of his career. Samuel’s opposing passer ratings the past three seasons: 96.8 (2021), 95.3 (2022) and 87.4 (2023).\n\nAdding Kristian Fulton fills a hole at the No. 2 cornerback spot, but Fulton’s coming off easily his worst year in the NFL with the Titans. His opposing passer rating jumped nearly 32 points from an 82.8 rating in 2022. At nickel, Ja’Sir Taylor improved his opposing passer rating by nearly 20 points, after a 97.9 mark in his rookie season in 2022.\n\n(Photo of Sauce Gardner: Nick Cammett / Diamond Images via Getty Images)"
