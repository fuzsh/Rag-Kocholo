        "text": "Welcome to the latest edition of the Transfer DealSheet, your weekly guide to what is happening in the summer window.\n\nOur team of dedicated writers, including Adam Leventhal and David Ornstein, will take you inside the market to explain the deals being worked on, the players who could arrive and the ones who are on their way out across the Premier League and beyond. In last week’s edition, we looked at Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s situation and Manchester United’s interest in Noussair Mazraoui.\n\nThe information found within this article has been gathered according to The Athletic’s sourcing guidelines. Unless stated, our reporters have spoken to more than one person briefed on each deal before offering the clubs involved the opportunity to comment. Those responses, where they were given, have been included in the Transfer DealSheet.\n\nThis week, we examine Liverpool’s midfield situation, look at Manchester United’s interest in Sander Berge and analyse one of the options Tottenham Hotspur have in their pursuit of a new striker.\n\nWe aim to bring you analysis you can trust about what is happening at Europe’s leading clubs and the latest information we’re hearing from across the market.\n\nThis article is long but detailed, so enjoy it all — or search for the club or player you want to read about.\n\nDavid Ornstein’s One To Watch\n\nLiverpool have now returned from their pre-season tour of the U.S. They take on Sevilla in a pre-season game at Anfield on Sunday, and for fans in attendance, as it stands, it will only be familiar faces on the pitch.\n\nArne Slot is yet to welcome a new arrival since taking over as Liverpool’s manager but has been calm about the situation.\n\nHowever, Slot used Wataru Endo, Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch in the No 6 position during their tour — in which Liverpool won all three of their games. Despite Slot praising Gravenberch’s performance in the friendly against Manchester United, Liverpool have now identified a target in that position.\n\nIt is worth keeping an eye on that situation this week, with Liverpool pursuing a specialist No 6 from outside of the Premier League.\n\nThey have turned down bids for Endo this summer, in part because of the tricky market in that position, but are now moving ahead with a signing for that role.\n\nWhat else we’re hearing\n\nBrighton are interested in Celtic midfielder Matt O’Riley. Brighton would not have a problem agreeing personal terms for the 23-year-old, but no fee has yet been agreed between the two sides. Denmark international O’Riley began his senior career at Fulham before a season and a half at MK Dons. He joined Celtic in January 2022 and has won the Scottish Premiership three times since his arrival. (Peter Rutzler and Andy Naylor)\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers want €10million for Daniel Podence. The 28-year-old spent last season on loan at Olympiacos, while there is interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia. Podence would be open to a move. Wolves are yet to receive an offer from anywhere and they have been impressed by his conduct in training and around the club — it is now a possibility he could stay. Steve Madeley\n\nBesiktas and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are reviewing options for the former Liverpool midfielder to move back to the Premier League. The Turkish club are open to a sale as they restructure their squad and cut their wage bill. All parties are aiming to find an amicable solution and allow him to return to the UK. Clubs are currently exploring the terms of a potential permanent or loan deal. Adam Leventhal\n\nFulham defender Tim Ream was granted permission to travel to the United States on Monday to complete his transfer to Major League Soccer side Charlotte FC. Talks between Charlotte and Fulham have been at an advanced stage for some time, with The Athletic reporting in June that an agreement was close. Ream did not travel with the Fulham squad to Portugal last week as part of the club’s pre-season preparations. However, on Sunday, the west London club confirmed the €6.3million (£5.4m) signing of Villarreal central defender Jorge Cuenca, which has paved the way for Ream to depart. He will undergo a medical before completing the transfer, which will bring his nine-year stay at Craven Cottage to a close. Peter Rutzler\n\nLorient have made Jean Victor Makengo available for transfer after their relegation from Ligue 1 last season. The former Udinese midfielder joined the French club last season and they will now review options for a departure via loan or permanent transfer for the 26-year-old. He is contracted until 2027. Adam Leventhal\n\nStade Reims are prepared for heightened interest in midfielder Amir Richardson. The Morocco international is now free to proceed with a move after being defeated 2-1 in the semi-finals of the Olympics against Spain. Leicester are one of the clubs who have closely tracked the 22-year-old’s progress and are considering a move. Reims value Richardson in the region of £13million and Serie A clubs have already registered interest in proceeding with a deal. Adam Leventhal\n\nArsenal\n\nWhat has happened this week?\n\nThe final group of players who participated at Euro 2024 have now returned to training. Arsenal have welcomed back William Saliba, David Raya, Declan Rice, Bukayo Saka and Aaron Ramsdale ahead of friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and Lyon.\n\nArsenal completed the sale of Emile Smith Rowe to Fulham for a possible total fee of £34million, while they have also fielded another offer from Marseille for Eddie Nketiah.\n\nDo Arsenal look short in any positions after pre-season?\n\nNumbers-wise, Arsenal look in decent shape. The issue may have more to do with quality and reliability. Unless the club plan to play Declan Rice in holding midfield, the duo of Thomas Partey and Jorginho may need reinforcing with a younger, more athletic profile.\n\nAnother potential area to explore is backup for Bukayo Saka. Fabio Vieira played that role during the U.S. tour but is not a natural wideman.\n\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\n\nCentral midfield remains a focus. Arsenal hold an ongoing interest in Real Sociedad midfielder Mikel Merino.\n\nThe 28-year-old is hugely admired by Mikel Arteta, but Arsenal are still exploring their options in the midfield market. The Spanish international has an offer to stay with Sociedad but would be keen to join up with Arteta if an agreement can be reached.\n\nAttacking reinforcements would most likely depend upon further outgoings.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nAs well as Nketiah, Reiss Nelson and Aaron Ramsdale are players who are looking for regular first-team football. The expectation is that they will be allowed to leave Arsenal before the end of the window. After the acquisition of Riccardo Calafiori, Arsenal may also sell a defender to balance out the squad.\n\nHaving signed a new contract earlier this summer, goalkeeper Karl Hein is expected to leave on loan. With Raya and Ramsdale now back in training, those conversations have begun, with League One Charlton leading a race against Barnsley in trying to sign Hein.\n\nJames McNicholas\n\nChelsea\n\nWhat has happened this week?\n\nThis week has been dominated by the club’s attempt to resolve Conor Gallagher’s future at Stamford Bridge, with the midfielder now looking to finalise a move to Atletico Madrid.\n\nChelsea had a third contract offer rejected by Gallagher on Wednesday that would have put him on similar wages as fellow midfielder Enzo Fernandez.\n\nHowever, as the extension amounted to just another two years plus the option of another 12 months, Gallagher was unwilling to agree to the terms. Doubts over how much he would play under head coach Enzo Maresca were part of the thinking behind the club’s offer and the player’s decision to say no.\n\nWhile reports of being banished from training were rejected by Chelsea, the club did make it clear that they could not afford to let him leave as a free agent when his current deal expires next summer. For his part, Gallagher did not threaten to do that either.\n\nTwo unnamed Premier League clubs made an approach, but it did not progress any further than that. Gallagher had to choose between two options: to sign a new deal to stay or leave for Atletico. The La Liga club set a deadline of close of play on Sunday and Gallagher agreed to make the switch just before time ran out. Gallagher is not the only midfield target Atletico have been exploring and it remains to be seen whether a deal goes through.\n\nMeanwhile, Chelsea surprisingly reentered the race for Napoli striker Victor Osimhen despite categorically ruling him out as a possibility earlier in the window.\n\nWill Chelsea replace Gallagher or are they happy with their options?\n\nNever say never when it comes to Chelsea, but it would be surprising if they brought in another midfielder.\n\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall joined from Leicester City for £30million last month, so you could say Gallagher’s spot in the squad has already been filled.\n\nA sign of Chelsea having too many players to choose from in this department came with Andrey Santos rejoining Strasbourg on a season-long loan.\n\nChelsea had initially earmarked him for a squad place this season but decided he would be better off playing regularly in France given the amount of competition ahead of him at Chelsea.\n\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\n\nNothing has changed in this regard. One or two attacking players are still the priority. Osimhen was taken off the wishlist a few months ago because he was deemed too expensive.\n\nWith long-term admirers Paris Saint-Germain unwilling to pay Napoli’s asking price, Chelsea have opened talks with the Serie A club over a loan deal with an option to buy.\n\nBefore the Gallagher situation came to the fore, Chelsea were speaking with Atletico Madrid over their promising young striker Samu Omorodion. The developments on Alvarez have softened Atletico’s stance on selling Omorodion, with Chelsea pursuing the deal. A deal for Omorodion is independent of their talks over Osimhen, which are expected to continue.\n\nChelsea are still in talks with Gremio over Brazil Under-20 international Gabriel Mec. Reports in Brazil that a fee being agreed worth £20.5million with add-ons has been dismissed as premature by the club. Chelsea do not intend to pay that much for the teenager, who turns 18 in 2026.\n\nThey are also negotiating with Belgium club Genk over 18-year-old goalkeeper Mike Penders. Should a price be agreed, he will spend at least one season on loan back at Genk.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nChelsea have quite a long list. The pursuit of Osimhen is tied to Napoli’s strong desire to sign Romelu Lukaku. The Belgium international has two years left on his contract at Stamford Bridge, but neither he nor Chelsea want him to play for the club again. Chelsea have put a release clause worth £38million on his head.\n\nTrevoh Chalobah was left out of Chelsea’s pre-season tour to the USA and knows he is low down in the pecking order. He has plenty of interest from clubs in the Premier League and abroad and while he does not want to leave, it is increasingly likely he will do so.\n\nGoalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga would like to return to Real Madrid, where he spent last season on loan, but it depends on Andriy Lunin, a goalkeeper Chelsea have been keen on, leaving.\n\nSeveral clubs across Europe have made enquiries about goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic, who is up for sale following the signing of Filip Jorgensen.\n\nChelsea may consider selling Ben Chilwell for the right price amid doubts about his suitability for Maresca’s style of play. His wages and price tag are a stumbling block.\n\nArmando Broja, Cesare Casadei and David Datro Fofana will be sold if Chelsea are presented with acceptable offers. A significant number of younger players are also waiting to finalise loan moves, including Alfie Gilchrist — who is on the cusp of joining Sheffield United — Harvey Vale, Alex Matos and Leo Castledine.\n\nSimon Johnson\n\nLiverpool\n\nWhat has happened this week?\n\nIn the two recent momentum-boosting friendly victories against Arsenal and Manchester United, Fabio Carvalho got himself on the scoresheet.\n\nIt has been a very encouraging pre-season for the 21-year-old, who started all three U.S. tour friendlies. Liverpool have rejected a £15million offer from Southampton for Carvalho.\n\nThey value the versatile attacker, who has played predominantly as a left-winger under new head coach Arne Slot, much higher and they are also unwilling to sanction another temporary departure.\n\nLiverpool are also in no rush to make a decision on Bobby Clark’s future. The young midfielder made a breakthrough into the first team last season, making 12 appearances. He missed the U.S. tour due to a back injury.\n\nRed Bull Salzburg, now managed by former Liverpool assistant manager Pep Lijnders, have had a £6million bid rejected. The 19-year-old is valued at around £12million. He is also subject to plenty of loan interest from the Championship, which looks the likelier move.\n\nIt was also revealed that a deal for Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon for £75million and Joe Gomez to move in the opposite direction for £45million was close at the end of June.\n\nNewcastle’s profit and sustainability (PSR) problems meant they needed to sell, but the deal was shelved when the £35million sale of Elliot Anderson to Nottingham Forest and Yankuba Minteh’s £30m move to Brighton & Hove Albion gave them the £60m they needed before the PSR deadline.\n\nWhy is No 6 a key position in this window?\n\nIn the three friendlies played on tour, Liverpool have used Wataru Endo, Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch in the No 6 role. The latter two looked much more comfortable than Endo as the Japanese international struggled to get to grips with Slot’s more patient possession-based approach.\n\nAsked specifically on whether he was looking to add a holding midfielder to his squad, Slot said: “I think Ryan (Gravenberch) did really well in that position (against Manchester United) and we have other options as well.\n\n“The best way to judge it is when we have all the players back and we still haven’t, but a club like Liverpool always keeps its eye open to see what’s available, players who can strengthen the squad and that is what we — Richard (Hughes) mostly — but me as well are looking to do. That is not particular to one position. We constantly evaluate the squad.”\n\nThe No 6 debate among supporters has not stopped since Fabinho’s form dipped. Alexis Mac Allister looks well suited to the role in Slot’s system, which requires a controller rather than a destroyer, but it is an area that could be improved. It therefore makes sense that Liverpool are chasing a new No 6 from outside the Premier League.\n\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\n\nAnthony Gordon remains a player Liverpool have interest in and there were fears the winger’s head had been turned earlier in the summer when a potential deal was discussed.\n\nHowever, Newcastle are no longer under FFP strain this summer and don’t want to sell one of their key players. They are also set to open talks about a new deal for the 23-year-old to reward him for his form last season and ward off interest.\n\nLiverpool have been considering defensive options since the departure of Joel Matip. Discussions over adding a holding midfielder and an attacking wide player have also taken place.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nInterest is growing in a number of Liverpool’s players and decisions will be made on their futures in the coming weeks.\n\nIn terms of sales, departures will be dependent on the size of the offers made. Sepp van den Berg, Carvalho, Nathaniel Phillips, Endo and Bobby Clark have all been subject to offers that Liverpool have rejected, with the club standing firm on their valuations.\n\nIt remains to be seen if clubs return with offers that meet Liverpool’s asking prices. Others including Tyler Morton and Ben Doak are attracting interest.\n\nLiverpool are not actively looking to sell Gomez. He remains part of Slot’s plans, but the versatile defender has other suitors beyond Newcastle.\n\nCentre-backs Rhys Williams and Billy Koumetio, who were left out of Liverpool’s pre-season tour to the United States, are expected to move on.\n\nAndy Jones\n\nManchester City\n\nWhat has happened this week?\n\nCity and Atletico Madrid were in talks over Julian Alvarez moving to the Spanish capital, although both teams were far apart on their valuations. Although no bid was made, Atletico value the Argentinian at an initial €55million plus bonuses, although City are wanting much closer to €70m up front, with bonuses on top. Paris Saint-Germain are also in the running, with some reports saying they have made bigger transfer and salary offers, although Atletico are Alvarez’s preference at the moment.\n\nOther than that, there is not much going on. Pep Guardiola confirmed a couple of times that City will probably only buy if somebody leaves, which has quietened down the rumour mill somewhat, although it does open up the possibility that they enter the market if Alvarez leaves.\n\nWill City give youngsters opportunity rather than doing business?\n\nOverall, yes, with players like Oscar Bobb and Rico Lewis expected to see more action this season. In terms of Alvarez in particular, it is an interesting question because it may open the door for James McAtee, who Guardiola says will be in the squad this season.\n\nThe 21-year-old has spent the past two seasons on loan at Sheffield United and he looked impressive in pre-season. Alvarez’s departure may thrust him even further up the pecking order if City decide not to replace the Argentinian, if they cannot agree a deal for a replacement, or if they decide to reinvest the money elsewhere in the squad.\n\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\n\nCity know they need a holding midfielder to lighten the load on Rodri and they tried to sign Bruno Guimaraes, but they were not willing to meet Newcastle’s valuation.\n\nIf money is made available from any Alvarez sale, they may decide that with Phil Foden, Bernardo Silva, Kevin De Bruyne, McAtee and their options on the wing, they could either go back to Newcastle with a bigger offer for Guimaraes — unlikely if it is a question of value rather than finance — or pursue an alternative at the back of midfield.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nOther than Alvarez, it is pretty quiet overall. As reported in the Transfer DealSheet a couple of weeks ago, City feel that their valuations of players means that few, if any, will leave and it is accepted that De Bruyne and Bernardo will be City players next season.\n\nIt appears that Ederson is in the same boat. It may even be the case for Alvarez, but there are at least ongoing conversations to change that.\n\nA potential move to Saudi Arabia for Matheus Nunes was mooted at the start of the summer, but so far there has seemingly been little movement on that front.\n\nSam Lee\n\nManchester United\n\nWhat has happened this week?\n\nUnited have seen a joint bid for Noussair Mazraoui and Matthijs de Ligt rejected by Bayern Munich, to the surprise of people connected to the proposed deal. But United are expected to return given the German club made both players available at the start of the summer.\n\nThe injuries to Leny Yoro and Rasmus Hojlund have become clearer. United expect Yoro to miss three months with a metatarsal fracture and Hojlund six weeks with a hamstring issue.\n\nWest Ham are continuing talks with United over Aaron Wan-Bissaka, although a fee has yet to be agreed.\n\nFulham made a bid of around £20million for Scott McTominay, but United are holding out for at least £25m. United are considering midfield options and one player under consideration is Sander Berge, who Burnley are prepared to sell.\n\nWill United move to replace Yoro or Hojlund?\n\nErik ten Hag was emphatic when asked if those two absences affect United’s approach in the market. “No, this will not change anything,” he said. “We have a plan and we stick to the plan.”\n\nClearly, though, De Ligt and Mazraoui were part of the plan regardless and United pressed ahead with a formal offer for both. Bayern are holding out for more, possibly in the case of De Ligt because they feel Yoro’s absence does increase the need for United to get another centre-back in. United finished the final pre-season game against Liverpool with Casemiro and Rhys Bennett in defence, after substitute Will Fish was forced off with a knee injury.\n\nVictor Lindelof and Jonny Evans had started the game, with Harry Maguire left out as a precaution. Lisandro Martinez is back at Carrington, so should be available, but United’s strength does not run particularly deep in that area with Yoro out.\n\nIndependent of Hojlund’s injury, United had a mind to try for a centre-forward at the end of the window should they make a major sale. Ivan Toney and Dominic Calvert-Lewin were two names discussed, but nothing has moved on. Ten Hag said he could play Jadon Sancho or Bruno Fernandes up front, with Joshua Zirkzee now also training at the club.\n\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\n\nBerge, 26, has emerged as a surprise midfielder on United’s list of options and club officials have made contact with his camp. The Norway international was relegated with Burnley last season but ranked highly in a series of metrics including dribbles and pressured pass accuracy. Berge had a very good game at Old Trafford last season, albeit making the mistake that gave Antony the ball for United’s goal.\n\nHe is 6ft 5in (195cm), but according to the Premier League hit a top speed of 35.90km/h, the 10th fastest of all players last campaign.\n\nBerge made 37 appearances last term. United are looking at a new No 6 and held talks over Manuel Ugarte, but Paris Saint-Germain would want around €60million and as things stand United are pursuing other targets.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nWan-Bissaka’s exit holds the key at right-back. West Ham have shown willing to meet United’s £18m price tag and offer the player wages within reach of the club’s top earners. But negotiations are on at United to find a financial agreement with the 26-year-old to exit. United wish to add this potential payment to West Ham’s transfer fee, and the overall package has not yet been agreed.\n\nWan-Bissaka is also of interest to Inter in a potential swap deal with Denzel Dumfries, which is still a live situation, although Ten Hag’s apparent preference for Mazraoui is a factor.\n\nWan-Bissaka went off in the 83rd minute against Liverpool in South Carolina, with a suspected dead leg having also been poked in the eye, but he is not injured so there is no impediment to a transfer. His contract expires next summer, having not been offered fresh terms since signing for the club in 2019, so United need to sell him now to recoup a significant fee.\n\nLaurie Whitwell\n\nNewcastle United\n\nWhat has happened this week?\n\nNewcastle played two pre-season fixtures in the stifling humidity of Tokyo. Their work in the transfer market hotted up, too, with Paul Mitchell, the club’s new sporting director, travelling to Japan with the first-team squad and holding regular meetings with Eddie Howe, the head coach, and chief executive Darren Eales at their Hilton Hotel base.\n\nThe outcome: agreeing an initial £10million fee with Sheffield United for William Osula, the Denmark Under-21 striker, and opening talks with Crystal Palace over Marc Guehi, the centre-half, who performed brilliantly for England at the European Championship. Newcastle have now submitted an opening bid for the defender.\n\nWhile Osula, 20, is regarded as a promising talent, a player Howe believes he can develop at St James’ Park, signing Guehi would represent a statement of intent. The 24-year-old, whose contract expires in 2026, has been linked with several of Europe’s biggest clubs.\n\nAs The Athletic reported last week, Newcastle are to begin contract negotiations with Anthony Gordon now the winger has returned to training following an extended summer break. Gordon is a target for Liverpool, his boyhood team, and the two clubs held discussions about a potential sale in late June as Newcastle scrambled to raise funds before the PSR deadline.\n\nSelling Gordon was always a last resort and they now hope to reward him for his stellar contribution last season, although Liverpool’s interest has not gone away. The player’s attitude will be key.\n\nHow can Newcastle afford players like Guehi?\n\nLet’s rewind to a little over a month ago when Newcastle, who theoretically have the wealthiest owners in football and have designs on winning everything, were scrabbling around like paupers, briefly contemplating selling their best players as they looked to plug a £60million deficit.\n\nIt is one of the oddities of modern football; Newcastle are both rich and hemmed in financially, restricted by the demands of PSR. Another oddity; having sold Yankuba Minteh and Elliot Anderson as the PSR deadline approached, the calendar then reset on July 1, meaning they could spend again. Even so, Guehi is an ambitious and costly target.\n\nThere will have to be compromises and balance and there will be more departures this summer. There have to be given Newcastle’s splurge on new signings since the takeover in October 2021 and the difficulty they have found in selling. They are determined never again to leave themselves in such a difficult position as they were a few weeks ago.\n\nNewcastle were last in Japan in the summer of 1996 when the club set a new world record with the £15million signing of Alan Shearer. In Tokyo, Howe was asked how far away Newcastle are from being able to make signings like that again.\n\n“A blockbuster like that might be difficult,” he said. “The rules have changed with transfers, I hope not permanently. I hope in time we will improve our position to enable us to sign that calibre of player, but that’s currently difficult for us, so we’re navigating a period where we’re having to be very aware of what we’re doing financially and having to plan ahead.”\n\nAs Newcastle become better and grow bigger, they will bring in more money from commercial and sponsorship opportunities, which will help alleviate this position. This is partly why they are in Japan, a strong market for Adidas, their new kit sponsors. In these terms, it is still early days.\n\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\n\nA right-sided centre-half and right-winger have always been priorities this summer, with Newcastle also seeking cover in attack and another possible addition in goal, which might seem counter-intuitive given the number of goalkeepers already at the club.\n\nHowe was asked about his interest in AC Milan defender Malick Thiaw, a player the club have been tracking for some time, during the trip to Japan and said “he’s a very good player”, but Newcastle were already moving for Guehi at that point. They had also discussed signing Liverpool’s Joe Gomez when selling Gordon was mooted.\n\nOsula would tick the forward box, leaving right wing as the next big position to fill should Guehi arrive. Howe has been keen to bring in a new face for several windows but has already missed out on his leading target, with Michael Olise instead joining Bayern Munich. They also have an interest in Anthony Elanga of Nottingham Forest, Chelsea’s Noni Madueke and Nicolas Gonzalez, Fiorentina’s Argentina international.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nNone of the big ones; that, at least, is Howe’s firm hope, which explains why Newcastle are moving swiftly to tie Gordon down to an enhanced deal. Gordon, Alexander Isak, Joelinton and Bruno Guimaraes, whose £100million release clause expired in June, are regarded as the crown jewels, but there is a need to cut costs, bring in revenue and reduce the average age of the squad.\n\nKieran Trippier has been a standard-bearer for Howe’s Newcastle, but the England man turns 34 in September and a potential move to Saudi has been in the offing for months. Miguel Almiron is another first-team stalwart whose playing time would be restricted if a new winger arrives.\n\nMartin Dubravka is expendable and Callum Wilson was also expected to seek a new club this summer, but a back injury that will see him miss the start of the season complicates matters. Howe loves Sean Longstaff’s contribution to the team, but the midfielder only has a year left on his contract and there is a decision to be made one way or the other.\n\nRyan Fraser and Isaac Hayden do not have a future at Newcastle. Jamal Lewis spent last season on loan at Watford but has travelled to Japan and played, with Howe saying: “Ultimately it will depend on what he wants. He wants to play football and it might be difficult to guarantee him that.”\n\nGeorge Caulkin\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nWhat has happened this week?\n\nIt has been a quiet week in the market at Tottenham Hotspur: the first team have been in South Korea for the conclusion of their summer tour, flying back on Sunday night to prepare for their final pre-season friendly against Bayern Munich this Saturday.\n\nAll that happened last week were a few low-profile departures: academy product Yago Santiago left for Elche and Bryan Gil went back to Spain and to Girona on loan.\n\nBut beyond that, it has been a quiet week, with Spurs fans left waiting for further reinforcements with just two weeks left before they start their Premier League campaign\n\nPostecoglou wants a striker — who could be of interest?\n\nAnge Postecoglou has been very clear that Spurs are looking for a centre-forward in the market this summer. Richarlison’s return has been patchy since he arrived from Everton in 2022, and even Dejan Kulusevski has been tried as a No 9 in pre-season.\n\nSpurs are interested in Dominic Solanke from Bournemouth — he scored 19 Premier League goals last season — but he has a £65million release clause. If Spurs spent that much money on him, it would be a club-record fee.\n\nThere has been interest from the Saudi Arabian league in Richarlison, but a move for Solanke would not necessarily be dependent on players going out first.\n\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\n\nTottenham have also been looking at a new No 8, an energetic midfielder to play alongside James Maddison.\n\nAt the start of the window, they worked on a potential move for Jacob Ramsey, but they could never agree a fee with Aston Villa, who ended up selling other players to help them comply with PSR. Postecoglou has been a big admirer of Conor Gallagher and Spurs have always had an eye on his situation at Chelsea, but he is now going to Atletico Madrid instead.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Spurs will look for another option in this area of the pitch in the final weeks of the window.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nTottenham have already made good progress with departures this summer, moving on many of the fringe players from last year, creating room in the wage bill in doing so.\n\nThere are not many such players left, although Emerson Royal is still at Spurs and playing an active role in pre-season. He has been subject to offers from AC Milan this window and could end up leaving.\n\nGiovani Lo Celso has one year left on his contract and was discussed as a potential makeweight in a deal for Jacob Ramsey that never happened.\n\nJack Pitt-Brooke\n\nWould Solanke fit Spurs?\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that Solanke’s 2023-24, in which he scored nine more Premier League goals than he managed in 96 previous appearances, wasn’t just a flash in the pan.\n\nAndoni Iraola’s system worked wonders for Solanke, who was already working hard off the ball under previous managers, as he stayed closer to the penalty area. His 17 non-penalty league goals came from an xG of 17.3, which suggests his improved form had more to do with service, tactics and positioning rather than unsustainable overperformance.\n\nA comparison of Solanke’s numbers from last season with Richarlison’s (11 goals in 28 league games) brings up some similarities, while also suggesting that Richarlison marginally overperformed expectations.\n\nRicharlison, like Solanke, was effective in positioning himself between centre-backs to score from cutbacks, though he was not as keen as Solanke to attack the six-yard box. The Brazilian, however, contributed defensively, a key requirement in Ange Postecoglou’s system.\n\nRicharlison averaged more interceptions (0.5 vs 0.2), tackles (0.97 vs 0.62) and tackling success (68 vs 48 per cent) per 90 minutes. Solanke, however, was more effective in the air, winning 42 per cent of his aerial duels compared to Richarlison’s 31 per cent. Additionally, they both averaged 0.8 possessions won in the final third per 90, while Solanke’s 1.2 possessions won in the middle third was more than Richarlison’s 0.6.\n\nIn terms of link-up play, Richarlison’s 2.3 progressive passes and 1.3 passes into the final third per 90 were ahead of Solanke’s 1.6 and 0.9 respectively, though Solanke was the better dribbler (37 per cent take-on success vs 27 per cent).\n\nSome of this also has to do with Richarlison averaging nearly 11.0 more touches per 90 than Solanke and the latter’s role in Bournemouth’s system. Solanke averaged more touches in both boxes, while Richarlison was ahead in touches in the middle and final third.\n\nSolanke also played in all of Bournemouth’s league matches last season, which gives him the edge in availability.\n\nHis link-up play is the only unknown commodity, but Postecoglou’s strikers barring Richarlison have traditionally had few touches and high impact. Solanke fits that mould well and could elevate Spurs’ attack next season.\n\nAnantaajith Raghuraman\n\nBarcelona\n\nWhat has happened this week?\n\nThere is a tense calm in the arrivals department because as much as Barcelona sources, kept anonymous to protect relationships, insist they are still in and waiting for Nico Williams and Dani Olmo, no breakthrough has been made.\n\nThey are still waiting for Nico Williams to communicate his final decision. The Spain international returned to Bilbao last Sunday ahead of the start of his pre-season. With Olmo, the club insist they are negotiating with RB Leipzig, but both sides are too far apart to reach an agreement.\n\nWhere we have had news, though, is on the departures list. Oriol Romeu left the pre-season tour in the United States last week after Barcelona and Girona agreed terms to loan the 31-year-old back to his former club.\n\nGirona are expected to announce Romeu’s arrival in the coming hours. This will put an end to one of the open issues Barcelona were dealing with this summer.\n\nIs Olmo now the key target for the window?\n\nAt least, he is the one target they can start being active on with negotiations and talks — and that’s what they are doing.\n\nBarcelona sources admitted last week that they were getting more pessimistic regarding Williams’ final decision. As a result, they decided to focus on the deal for Olmo.\n\nThe 25-year-old is very well-liked by new manager Hansi Flick and sporting director Deco. Barcelona are aiming to get Olmo for a fee lower than the €60million release clause RB Leipzig had inserted into his contract. Leipzig are not keen on this. However, the player’s camp has admitted there is a huge desire from Olmo to join his boyhood club Barcelona.\n\nOn top of all this, there is still the €100million financial hole in their budget that Barcelona need to resolve before being in a position to register new players under La Liga rules. Can they sign players? Technically yes, they can. Will they be able to play? If they don’t fix their situation before August 15, no new signing, as well as Inigo Martinez and Vitor Roque, could feature in the La Liga opener in two weeks.\n\nBarcelona sources, though, feel confident that Olmo’s desire to join the club will mean the 25-year-old is ready to wait for all those issues to be solved.\n\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\n\nThe main focus is on bolstering the attacking line. Williams is still the top target because sporting director Deco views the left-wing role as the one to upgrade in the transfer window.\n\nDani Olmo, as much as he is not an out-and-out winger, can perform as well in that position and is seen as a key player for the project in the coming years.\n\nThe other position Barcelona have been looking at since the start of the summer was in holding midfield, but there’s been a slight change in their stance there. The promising displays from La Masia starlets Marc Bernal (17) and Marc Casado (20) have given Flick some hope that they can be the players to solve his midfield problem. As things stand, it would not be too surprising to see some of them starting in the La Liga opener at Valencia on August 17.\n\nPlus, one of the targets they had for this position, Real Sociedad’s Mikel Merino, is progressively getting out of Barcelona’s reach given Arsenal’s interest.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nThe first two pre-season games have shown us that 19-year-old striker Vitor Roque won’t have an easy path to first-team minutes next season and club sources admit his future is still up in the air.\n\nRoque arrived last January after a €30million deal, plus €31m in add-ons, but has failed to impress either of the two managers he’s worked with, Xavi and Flick. The emergence of former Barcelona Atletic striker Pau Victor in pre-season, scoring three goals in two games and showing more promising glimpses than Roque, has not done the Brazilian a favour either.\n\nIt is difficult to see which other players can leave the club. As much as Barcelona’s board members would sanction the departures of names such as Frenkie de Jong, Raphinha or Andreas Christensen, no senior figure in the squad wants to leave the club — and they do not need to do so to pursue a new contract.\n\nOther fringe players such as Clement Lenglet or Ansu Fati, who are on heavy wages, will need to be offloaded as well before the end of the transfer window.\n\nPol Ballus\n\nReal Madrid\n\nWhat has happened this week?\n\nWhile travelling in the United States for the summer tour, Real Madrid have relaxed their movements in this transfer market.\n\nIn his first press conference, Ancelotti responded to a question about the squad: “It’s closed. We have no idea of signing other players.”\n\nIt could be mere posturing on the part of Ancelotti, but behind closed doors, the club’s board is repeating the same message: “No signings are going to be made.”\n\nAs The Athletic reported, Madrid tried to sign Leny Yoro and, after failing to land him, the option of signing Aymeric Laporte to reinforce the centre-back position was considered.\n\nHowever, now everything is at a standstill. Senior sources, kept anonymous to protect relationships, deny that they are going to go for Laporte and claim that the squad is closed “barring any surprises”.\n\nBut what do they mean by that?\n\nIs Ancelotti happy with his options?\n\nMadrid’s coaching staff thought they needed a centre-back after the departure of captain Nacho Fernandez to Saudi Arabia’s Al Qadsiah and the sale of academy player Rafa Marin to Napoli.\n\nWhat’s more, Ancelotti’s staff liked the option of signing Laporte. It was seen as a very complex operation financially.\n\nThat’s why the Madrid head coach — who saw Tchouameni as an alternative in defence even before the end of the season — understands the club’s position and is going to do what he can with the squad he has.\n\nThat’s what happened last season and the team won the Champions League and La Liga.\n\nWhich players could be leaving?\n\nAncelotti was also very explicit earlier this summer: “They (the players) all want to stay.”\n\nIt’s a position endorsed by Madrid’s management, who don’t expect any departures except for Dani Ceballos. According to senior sources, he did ask to leave the club at the beginning of the summer, but now it seems that he has not found an offer that satisfies him.\n\nManagement also doubt Mario Martin and Nico Paz can stay in the first team as they have too many midfielders.\n\nBeyond that, the other issue that is not resolved is the future of goalkeeper Andriy Lunin. With Thibaut Courtois fully recovered and performing at a good level on the U.S. tour, Lunin does not have much chance of playing as much as he would like.\n\nThat’s why his camp is not completely shutting down the possibility of a move. However, it will not be easy because Madrid are asking for a high price — and several clubs have contacted his camp recently.\n\nWhat positions/players are they looking at?\n\nAlthough the club’s intention is not to move in the market at the moment, if Lunin ends up leaving, Madrid could still make the return of Kepa Arrizabalaga a reality.\n\nThe Chelsea goalkeeper has not travelled on their American tour. His camp say all options are still open and that nothing can be ruled out, but his preference is to stay in Madrid.\n\nThe option of a move to Saudi side Al Ittihad has vanished — they have signed Mallorca goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic.\n\nBut, regardless of this hypothetical situation, Madrid are adamant that they are not going to make a signing and deny that they have made an offer to River Plate for the 16-year-old midfielder Franco Mastantuono.\n\nGuillermo Rai\n\nJuventus\n\nReading too much into friendlies is an annual pitfall. The results are less important than the experiments a new coach runs through.\n\nDefinitive conclusions are few and far between unless they are drawn from an analysis of who isn’t playing.\n\nJuventus played out a 2-2 draw with Brest at the weekend and, with the exception of the injured Fabio Miretti, the big names left out of the squad generated more interest than the friendly itself.\n\nNew coach Thiago Motta confirmed that the players who didn’t travel can be considered on the market. It is quite the list.\n\nGoalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, defenders Mattia De Sciglio, Daniele Rugani and Tiago Djalo, midfielders Arthur Melo, Hans Nicolussi-Caviglia and Weston McKennie, wingers Filip Kostic and Federico Chiesa, and striker Arkadiusz Milik.\n\nSome have already come close to leaving. Szczesny, who has been replaced by Monza’s Michele Di Gregorio, was in talks with Al Nassr. McKennie was one of the bargaining chips in the deal that sent Samuel Iling-Junior and Enzo Barrenechea to Aston Villa.\n\nMost intriguing of all, however, is the future of Chiesa, who is out of contract at the end of next season. The 26-year-old Italy international’s performances have lagged behind the unrelenting social media hype these past 18 months, in part because of a serious knee injury. Juventus paid €50m for Chiesa in 2020. His current valuation is roughly half that figure.\n\n“We were clear internally,” Motta said. “We spoke with each of them. We’ve got good players who are used to playing regularly. The club is trying to find solutions for them and, for their own good and the good of everyone, they too have to find solutions as soon as possible.”\n\nJames Horncastle\n\n(Top photo: Getty Images)"
