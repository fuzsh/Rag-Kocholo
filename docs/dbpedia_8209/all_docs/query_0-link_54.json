        "text": "Stephen Blackford\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n8 min read\n\n·\n\nJan 20, 2022\n\n--\n\nLiverpool FC Season(s) 1997–98 through 2002/2003. An end of season extravaganza and seasonal extra, just for you!\n\nWelcome to Part 11, and indeed final part of my scrapbooking odyssey on the football team my dear old Mum “persuaded” me to follow when just a small boy and around the mercurial times of Kenneth Mathieson Dalglish, winnings cups in May and seemingly always holding that beautiful gleaming trophy with the “Big Ears”. This edition is slightly different from the previous 10 as in finally, at the age of (deleted by Editor), I finally hung up scrapbooking scissors and glue. So rather than a season by season scrapbook journey, this is a 5 season extravaganza of my final cuttings, a lament at a missing scrapbook and a box of programmes and a whole load of precious memories.\n\nI attended my first Liverpool game as a 10 year old on 8th August 1982 when the Reds formed a “triangle” of pre-season friendlies with Coventry City and Ipswich Town and all hosted by my hometown club of Portsmouth. I was already a Red as far back as 1980 and I have no idea how my Mother achieved such a feat but she bought me the “Hitachi” home shirt and one I proudly wore as an 8 year old to a very stuffy, best bib and tucker occasion at Portsmouth Guildhall as I met the Lord Mayor after winning a painting competition with my entry, naturally entitled, “The Football Match”. So of course I was going to attend this Gala event as an 8 year old in my Liverpool shirt. What self respecting Red at that age wouldn’t?\n\nSo I’m not a Scouser (though I envy those with that particular birthplace) and I’m an “out of towner”. But please allow me to very briefly give you some bona fides as to the veracity of my support for this wonderful football club.\n\nMy first game was 1982 and my last was 2012. In the 30 years in between I have followed the Reds at over 55 league grounds in England and Wales as well as 7 European grounds and I’ve probably travelled to see them 300+ times. Not an idyll boast, nor is it overly ground breaking. I’ve been incredibly lucky as well as being incredibly skint watching the Reds! I became a season ticket holder in the season before the first lock down after being on the waiting list since 1998 . I had the crest tattooed on my arm as a 15 year old, I’ve sat on a cold coach for days going to Switzerland for a 2nd Round Cup Winners Cup tie, I watched *that* goal in *that* 1996 FA Cup Final on a tiny Casio TV outside “our” end of Wembley without a ticket.\n\nWell, I had a ticket, but that’s a whole other story for another day.\n\nSo I’m a Southern born Red with a lot of scrapbook cuttings to share and maybe the occasional commentary to go along with them too. I hope you enjoy sharing them with me.\n\n“Allez! Allez! Allez!”\n\nDisclaimer — All pictures contained within this blog will be almost certainly from the “main” UK publications of the day but more importantly perhaps wholly contained within some loved, if dusty, scrapbooks of a 30 year vintage and placed here purely for enjoyment purposes and I hope that this disclaimer meets everyone’s needs. If not, thank you www.guardian.comwww.dailymail.co.ukwww.thetimes.co.ukwww.mirror.co.ukwww.telegraph.co.ukwww.liverpoolecho.co.uk et al for entertaining this Pritt Stick and scissors wielding young child/spotty teen/tall and gangly late teenager and young adult who should’ve stopped ripping and cutting up newspapers long before he hung up his scissors! All programmes shown here are from my personal collection.\n\nDisclaimer II — This is far from a fully comprehensive review of the season and purely the contents and selected pages from my scrapbooks and boxes of football programmes. I was nicknamed by my Liverpool match going pal as “The Cutter” in reference to an Echo and the Bunnymen song and so hence, here are my cuttings.\n\nDisclaimer III — There will be images from a certain reviled newspaper that I will not name and I only include them (where available) as they represent the cuttings at that time. I despise that “newspaper” and when I used to “go the match” I always wore my Hillsborough Support Group scarf and a white sticker imploring everyone not to buy that unnamed “newspaper”.\n\nSo onto the good stuff for the final time! I sincerely hope these scraps from my books jog a memory of the match concerned or of the era, the city in general or your life at that time.\n\nHuman memories are a precious commodity. I hope you enjoy.\n\nI sincerely hope you’ve enjoyed this final ramble along “Scrapbook Lane” and if you have, or indeed had a memory jogged of a particular game, the city of Liverpool or the twisted fates of a life’s journey, please consider the previously and recently released season by season “Scrapbook Lane” editions below and my special edition of “A Lifetime of Southampton Away”.\n\nA lifetime of “Southampton Away”\n\nand how I got into an argument with Jamie Redknapp that almost resulted in a bloody St Valentines Day massacre!\n\nmedium.com\n\nA stroll through Scrapbook Lane and around the Fields of Anfield Road — Part 1\n\nLiverpool FC Season 1987–88.
