Everybody knows that English club Liverpool FC was dressed by Adidas for many years in history, and most of you know the most iconic LFC Adidas jerseys. Today we take a look at the full Adidas collection for Liverpool that was created for the 1995-1996 season, the last before Reebok became responsible for the LFC jerseys (1996-2006). Thanks to Classic Football Shirts for the images.

Liverpool x Adidas

Adidas did not only design three player kits and goalkeeper jerseys for The Reds in 1995-1996 but also a range of lifestyle and training items.

Adidas' 95-96 Liverpool FC collection includes a rather standard yet classy home kit as well as a rather unknown yellow third kit -the most iconic player kit today of that season is definitely the Adidas Liverpool 95-96 away kit with its white and green quarters.

Adidas' Liverpool FC collection also brought different 'Predator' goalkeeper kits that are true 1990s pieces of art.

The probably most iconic 1990s track jacket of today (that green one with the big large white 3 stripes) was also part of the collection, which included sweatshirts as well.

Today, there is a high demand for all those Liverpool FC 1995-96 items, and therefore the prices for all those items have reached unimaginable prices. In example, the 1995-96 Liverpool Adidas Track Jacket retails at 300 GBP at Classic Football Shirts [(Excellent) L/XL], and the kits are not available for less than 100 GBP.
