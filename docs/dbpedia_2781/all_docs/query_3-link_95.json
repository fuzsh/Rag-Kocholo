I didn't watch them yet. They are in Stereo only on Surround.\n\nThanks for the heads up, Shawn. Now I won't have to transfer my VHS copies over to DVD-R.\n\nThanks for the Kiss info, though I already own both videos.\n\nXtreme/Konfidential since 2001 and Kiss my A** since 2003.\n\nBoth were released previously to the US in several countries.\n\nAnd how's the quality? I was just about to pick these!\n\nThey look Ok, not an important improvement over the VHS tape. But they're better.\n\nThere's no extra stuff, though. Just simple menus to choose songs on Konfidential and Kiss my a**. Get them."
