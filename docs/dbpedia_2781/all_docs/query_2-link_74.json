        "text": "Multiple tornadoes caused extensive damage in Iowa on Tuesday during severe weather that storm trackers across the region captured live on video.\n\nReports of tornadoes and damage started coming in Tuesday afternoon while a \"Particularly Dangerous Situation\" Tornado Watch was underway for parts of the Midwest.\n\nNearly two dozen tornadoes ripped through western and central parts of the Hawkeye State.\n\nTORNADOES CAUSE DESTRUCTION IN IOWA AS DEADLY STORMS RACE ACROSS STATE\n\nStorm chaser Brandon Copic's cameras started recording a massive tornado that developed in western Iowa.\n\n\"It's definitely a multi-vortex tornado in progress,\" Copic told FOX Weather Meteorologist Ian Oliver.\n\nMeanwhile, Vince Waelti captured another video of a twister touching down on the ground in Corning, Iowa.\n\nThe images below were recorded by a weather watcher about 2 miles north of Corning as the tornado touched down.\n\nSome of the most catastrophic tornado damage happened in Greenfield. The NWS in Des Moines said the Greenfield tornado was at least an EF-3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. However, storm surveys are ongoing.\n\nThe close-up video below shows the strong tornado moving toward Greenfield.\n\nDrone video revealed much of the town was destroyed. At least two deaths and several injuries were reported there.\n\nCopic was among the first on the scene after the tornado hit. He said search and rescue efforts were underway Tuesday because people were trapped in their homes.\n\n\"Most of this town is gone. There's no other way to put it,\" Copic said.\n\nFirefighters searched the area on Tuesday evening as residents began emerging from their tornado shelters to see the destruction caused by the powerful tornado, including destroyed homes and flipped cars. But Iowa State Patrol officials said they believe everyone is accounted for.\n\nAs of Tuesday night, Greenfield was closed to everyone besides residents and those who live there were required to show identification to get past checkpoints.\n\nIn southwest Iowa, a tornado outside of Prescott ripped down a wind turbine, causing a fire.\n\nThe video at the top of this story shows dark smoke billowing from the broken wind turbine after the twister moved through the area.\n\nFOX Weather producers on the ground near Carl, Iowa, documented the turbine still burning and nearby silo that was damaged in the storm."
