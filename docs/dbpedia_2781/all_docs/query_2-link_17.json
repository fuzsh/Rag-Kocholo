We proudly hold the top position in the Midwest for James Hardie siding installation, roofing expertise, window installation, remodeling, and more. When it comes to your home’s exterior, if you can dream it, we’re here to bring it to life.\n\nHome Visualizer\n\nWe do not charge for estimates and in most cases we are able to provide a quote the same day. We also provide our customers with a visualizer tool that allows them to see what different products and styles would look like on their home before they buy!\n\nIt depends on a lot of factors like the type of siding and the size of your home. Most of our siding projects are between $15,000-$30,000 with some being as much as $90,000! Vinyl siding tends to be less expensive than fiber cement but can be just as costly if you add foam backing to help lower your energy bills. A no pressure free estimate can help you determine which siding is the right fit for your home and budget.\n\nThis is will depend entirely on the type of project and the availability of materials. We are able to start MOST projects within 4-6 weeks.\n\nObviously we strive to eliminate accidents but they do happen. In these rare instances, we have a general liability insurance, workers compensation insurance and an umbrella policy. Rest assured that if anything were to happen on your project, Xtreme Exteriors would have you covered!\n\nEvery project is assigned a project manager that will check on the job throughout the project and keep you informed. Our project managers have many years of hands on experience and also understand how stressful it can be to have your home under construction. We strive to over communicate and answer any questions you may have leading up to and during your project.\n\nBeyond just our many 5 star google reviews we have our recent projects with photos mapped out so you can see what projects your neighbors have had us do! Check that out here! (link to the recent projects tab) We can also provide you additional references upon request."
