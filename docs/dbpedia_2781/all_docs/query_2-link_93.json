Extreme heat is a period of high heat and humidity with temperatures above 90 degrees for at least two to three days.

Extreme heat is responsible for the highest number of annual deaths among all weather-related hazards.\n\nOlder adults, children and people with certain illnesses and chronic conditions are at greater risk from extreme heat.\n\nHumidity increases the feeling of heat.\n\nPrepare for Extreme Heat\n\nImage\n\nLearn to recognize the signs of heat illness.\n\nDo not rely on a fan as your primary cooling device. Fans create air flow and a false sense of comfort, but do not reduce body temperature or prevent heat-related illnesses.\n\nIdentify places in your community where you can go to get cool such as libraries and shopping malls or contact your local health department to find cooling options in your area.\n\nCover windows with drapes or shades.\n\nWeather-strip doors and windows.\n\nUse window reflectors specifically designed to reflect heat back outside.\n\nAdd insulation to keep the heat out.\n\nUse a powered attic ventilator, or attic fan, to regulate the heat level of a building’s attic by clearing out hot air.\n\nInstall window air conditioners and insulate around them.\n\nIf you are unable to afford your cooling costs, weatherization or energy-related home repairs, contact the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for help.\n\nBe Safe DURING\n\nImage\n\nNever leave people or pets in a closed car on a warm day.\n\nIf air conditioning is not available in your home find a cooling option.\n\nTake cool showers or baths.\n\nWear loose, lightweight, light-colored clothing.\n\nUse your oven less to help reduce the temperature in your home.\n\nIf you’re outside, find shade. Wear a hat wide enough to protect your face.\n\nDrink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.\n\nAvoid high-energy activities or work outdoors, during midday heat, if possible.\n\nCheck on family members, older adults and neighbors.\n\nWatch for heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\nConsider pet safety. If they are outside, make sure they have plenty of cool water and access to comfortable shade. Asphalt and dark pavement can be very hot to your pet’s feet.\n\nHeat waves may cause you to lose power. Visit Power Outages to learn how to stay safe.\n\nHeat-Related Illnesses\n\nKnow the signs of heat-related illnesses and ways to respond. If you are sick and need medical attention, contact your healthcare provider for advice and shelter in place if you can.

Call your healthcare provider if symptoms get worse or last more than an hour.\n\nSummer Break\n\nWhile the kids are home for the summer, get the whole family prepared.\n\nImage\n\nMake a family communication plan and include the whole family.\n\nPractice evacuation plans and other emergency procedures with children on a regular basis.\n\nTeach kids when and how to call important phone numbers like 9-1-1.\n\nMake sure the kids have an emergency contact person and know how to reach them.\n\nCreate a family password or phrase to prevent your child from going with a stranger.\n\nKeep the kids occupied with online emergency preparedness games.\n\nDownload the free Prepare with Pedro activity book to help kids learn to prepare.\n\nDecide on a family meeting place you can go if separated.\n\nAssociated Content\n\nExtreme Heat Information Sheet (PDF)\n\nExtreme Heat Safety Social Media Toolkit\n\nChildren, Pets and Vehicles (weather.gov)\n\nYou Can Help Prevent Hot Car Deaths (NHTSA)\n\nProtective Actions Research for Extreme Heat\n\nNational Weather Service Heat Safety Tips and Resources\n\nNational Weather Service - Heat Illnesses\n\nNational Integrated Heat Health Information System (heat.gov)\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Extreme Heat\n\nWarning Signs and Symptoms of Heat-Related Illness"
