NO FUEL SURCHARGES from us. We strive to offer the most competitive rates and the best customer service of all watersports in Destin. We’re natives of Destin, Florida so we know all the hot spots and best places to see what you’re after.\n\nWhile parasailing high above crystal clear waters, renting a pontoon boat, or riding a Jet Ski / Waverunner you will often see manta rays with wingspans of over 6 feet, or a playful pod of dolphins (we have baby dolphins sighted daily)! We can take you there. Also, check out our sister companies Destin Water Fun and Destin Parasailing for your next trip to Destin, Florida!\n\nFrom our unique location you can be on Crab Island or out of the NO WAKE zone in less than 2 minutes. That is because we are the only watersports company not located in the Harbor.\n\nNO IDLE TIMES: With other companies, you will spend 15 minutes idling out of the harbor and another 15 minutes on the way back. That’s half your riding time! Don’t you think you should get the Jet Ski / Waverunner for the entire time you paid for it? We do! That’s why we offer no idle times! Take off from our launch and keep on moving!\n\nWe do recommend that you call a day ahead for your Xtreme H2o parasail, Jet Ski / Waverunner , dolphin tour via waverunner, or pontoon boat reservation at the beginning of your trip! We do accept walk up customers as well, but reservations will guarantee that when you arrive we will have the Xtreme H2o parasail, dolphin tour via Waverunner, Jet Ski, or pontoon boat rental waiting for you so you don’t have to wait on them."
