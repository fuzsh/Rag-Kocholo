        "text": "In life I always try to bend over the negative into the positive, however I do understand for some people and their business this has been a horror scenario.\n\nAdvertisement\n\now do they view the Nail Industry in Belgium and Europe in general?\n\nThe Nail Industry in Belgium and Europe is completely different from the industry in the United States or any where else in the world. It’s a niche branch of the beauty industry and it’s very fast evolving when it comes down to trends, shapes, techniques and art.\n\nWhile in my beginner Nail Tech years which is about 15 years ago, the inspiration found was from Nail Technicians located the United States, Japan and Singapore we see nowadays that the nail trends and styles are influenced by Eastern-European artists that have taken over.\n\nEastern-European Technicians have a great skill for art just like the Russian Nail Technicians as art is one of their main courses while being in school during childhood they have a great eye for color combinations and drawing. In Belgium and Europe they definitely set the trend.\n\nHow has COVID 19 affected your business and/or clientele?\n\nEven though for many people COVID 19 has been a negative experience to their business for me as an entrepreneur it came as a blessing. Doesn’t that sound crazy to you?\n\nSee in January 2020 I had decided to implement high-tech storage elevators because we did not have enough storage room to store all different SKU’s we have in stock. As this high-tech storage elevators had to be connected to our ERP-system my cousin and I have worked hard so the entire system could be run simply by clicking the button on your iPhone. COVID 19 gave me time to work very closely on programming and implementing this system step-by-step. If the industry by the time COVID hit us would not have slowed down, I would not have been able to do the full implementation and automatization of our warehouse.\n\nIn life I always try to bend over the negative into the positive, however I do understand for some people and their business this has been a horror scenario. I was very blessed and lucky being able to twist this situation into my advantage. This does not mean that I do not care about all the life’s that have been lost. For everyone that has lost a loved one and has suffered a lot of misery from it. All I can say is that I am sorry for your loss of this surreal pandemic! Whatever you do, please keep the faith!\n\nWere you forced to shut down your supply business\n\nCOVID-19 has also hit our industry very bad here in Belgium. Nail Techs, Beauticians, Hairdressers as well as beauty supplies, have been forced to shut down their businesses for months in a row. Being in lock down 3 times I am sure this will leave its economical and emotional scars.\n\nWe’ve seen how hard independent nail technicians and beauticians have had it during lock down. They had to find a way to make a living and pay the bills. After lock down 2, we’ve seen that a certain percentage of our customers decided they did no longer wanted to be a puppet on a string. They were forced because of economical reasons to give up their dreams and hopes they have worked for all their life. For those I truly hope they will find back the strength to restart in the future.\n\nWhat changes are you making to ensure the safety of your business and/or employees at ASAP Nails & Beauty Supply?\n\nSince February 2020 our staff has permanently worn masks while operating. During lunch breaks we had to break up the team to eat individually from each other as a prevention measure. We have installed many sanitations station so all hygiene rules are/were met!\n\nFor our customers we allowed only a few people inside the store in time slots of 30 minutes. To prevent our shop from being too crowed and risking the transmission of the virus. Shopping baskets were sanitized in between customers. Even though by taken these prevention measurement our company has faced a COVID outbreak where about 25% of our staff tested positive. While no government organizations that could advise us what to do… I took the decision to shut down the store and put everyone in quarantine for 10 days. Meanwhile our online-store was going crazy and there was no other choice than to keep going. My husband, myself and 2 non-positive employees processed all orders as fast as possible so the customer would not have to deal with our issues. We have been very fortunate that none of our employee was badly struck by COVID-19 and that everybody was able to resume their job after quarantine.\n\nFrom one point of view COVID-19 to me was a pause-button from the other side I have experienced from very closely how hard and tough things can get when COVID hits you.\n\nWhat was the most difficult part of this crisis in respect to your own Nail Upkeep?\n\nMy own Nail Upkeep was not so much of my worries at that time. As for me the most difficult part was to see that many talented people just broke down in tears, got depressed, and lost their drive and passion for the industry.\n\nSocial Media did no good to people as there was a moment where all negativity was posted on walls and everybody got really depressed… They forgot that being creative does not always need to be by doing nails… They lost their hunger… for life, for work, for their passion and their dream. From our side we have always tried to continuously inspire people, doing FREE Training via Instagram Live… so the Nail Techs had something to live up to!\n\nHow long have you been in business?\n\nThis September ASAP Nails & Beauty we will celebrate our 15th Anniversary.\n\nWhere exactly are you located? How long have you worked there?\n\nWe’ve seen how hard independent nail technicians and beauticians have had it during lock down.\n\nASAP Nails & Beauty Supply is located in Brugge, Belgium. It’s also called the Venice of the North. Bruges is known because it has best-preserved medieval architecture of Europe. It’s UNESCO World Heritage, Bruges is the capital and largest city of West Flanders in de Flemish region of Belgium.\n\nCan you explain you Abstract® Professional Products line?\n\nI have personally developed the Abstract® Professional Products line in 2014. Initially it the intension was to fill the gaps in the industry. As many manufacturers stopped the production of Color Gels in a jar and while in our country people were not ready yet to jump into a brush-in bottle system in a heartbeat, Abstract® Professional Products all started with a line of highly pigmented UV/LED Color Gels which anno 2021 has become a complete product line.\n\nAs a renowned educator a multiple champion I have had the opportunity to work with many brands and leaders of the industry. I am very passionate about what I do and how I want things to work out for\n\nme. With the background of a Nail Tech, I set the bar very high when it comes to my expectations for products’ performance and quality. For no manufacturer I work (ed) with listened to the needs, ideas or thoughts… I decided to create Abstract® Professional Products.\n\nThe biggest focus of Abstract® Professional Products is creating high-end products, ad value, improve techniques and enable the technician to be able to create great nails on a time-saving and efficient way.\n\nWinning the Nail Design Magazine Reader’s Choice Awards in each category year after year confirms that our Abstract® Professional Products is not about bragging, praising and glorifying. Its facts and results! You can not force anyone to like and vote your products to be the best…winning these awards really pushes me harder and forward to only create the best!\n\nAwards Won:\n\nBest Traditional Gel Products (2017 / 2018 / 2019 / 2020)\n\nBest Traditional Acrylic Products (2018/2019/2020)\n\nBest Acrylic Gel Product (2018/2019/2020)\n\nBest Gel Polish Product (2017/2018/2019/2020)\n\nMost Innovative Product (2018/2019/2020)\n\nBest Color Gel Product (2017 / 2018 /2019/2020)\n\nBest Acrylic Color Product (2018/2019/2020)\n\nBest Product for Natural Nail Care (2018/2019/2020)\n\nBest Nail Art Product (2018/2019/2020)\n\nBest Product Of The Benelux (2018/2019/2020)\n\nFor the demanding Lashionista’s out there… Abstract® Professional Products also created a Lash and Brow range which was brought to the public in 2019. Next to my nail obsession I am passionate about gorgeous lashes and brow… and only the best is good enough. The lash and brow business is exploding and I’m not done yet!\n\nAnd much more to come…\n\nHow did you get started into this 6 ½ Billion dollar industry?\n\nAs a teenager I always wanted to become hairdresser or beautician, however my mom wanted me to study. She said, study first and you can become whatever you want after you graduate. So I studies Secretary-Languages, got my degree and soon started working as a Production Planner for Belgian Precision Metal Processing Company where I worked for Caterpillar Inc. So nothing to do with beauty at all. Let’s say that I loved my job, however in this male-dominant industry I wanted to do something more girly. While chatting at the nail table from my dear friend at nail tech Brigitte Devos, she said…why don’t you take a nail styling class, you will soon find out if it’s something you will like or not!\n\nSo while still working as a production planner I took my first nail classes in 2004 -2005. Nail styling really turned my hobby and my outlet. As there were no platforms like You Tube, Instagram or Zoom to learn more skills than what I have learned during nail styling classes, I travelled the world to learn from the best in the industry.\n\nCustomers came back, brought a friend and asked me if I wanted to teach them how to do nails. Soon the demand was so high that I started earning a solid income from doing nails, so I decided to take a jump and quit my job as a production planner in 2006.\n\nWhile doing nails, teaching nails and continuously growing into this industry, I started to sell nail art products on a small scale from my nail salon.\n\nBeing self-employed meant that every single minutes or second that I was not doing nails or teaching, I was out on the street selling our Nail Art Products to professional salons. My salon became a small shop (+/- 30m²) for nail art products and soon I got picked up from major distributors who wanted to work with me or other that threatened me as they did not know what my plans were.\n\nBecause the ongoing and continuously growing success I moved to bigger facilities twice, because I wanted to have a location which was located more central in the country to be able for customers from all over the country could stop by and purchase their favorite products. I remember doubling and tripling the square footages of our store. I had one co-worker which worked alongside me doing nails and soon she had to take over the nail salon as my business exploded and I had to do all purchases, sales, marketing, and maintenance of the website…\n\nAs I worked closely with beauty schools as their main supplier the demand kept growing and again moving out was a necessity if I wanted to grow my company bigger.\n\nToday, 15 years after the first jump I took, I am grateful for everything I have been able to accomplish. Our facility now is about 1500m². Our storefront is 500m² and our training facility is about the same size. We have a fully automated inventory system which hold about 15.000 different SKU’s. 3 other warehouses to store manicure tables, beauty beds, beauty cases… good for a total of another 1000m² and 16 full time employees… who would have thought the hobby of mine would become my life!\n\nLooking back I have to say that I am very grateful to my mom that forced me to become a secretary first. Without her forcing me to study… I might not have had the skills to be the CEO of my company, not to forget Brigitte my nail tech who said try it!\n\nTrust me when I say there have been many obstacles and bumps along my way… If you can dream it, you can achieve it!\n\nAs an Educator & Judge, you have done some amazing competing around the world (London, Madrid, Brussels, Hardenberg, etc. Can you talk about that?\n\nAs a little girl I used to be a gymnast at the highest and most competitive level there was. In between going to school and taking music classes I trained 24 hours a week and being prepared for, because I wanted to be the best. Ever since I was little, the competition drive runs through my veins.\n\nWhen doing nails became more than just a hobby … it came very naturally to test my skills on the competition floor. What did I have to lose? Nothing… I could only learn how to cope with managing my nerves in stressful situations and see how my skill would adapt to those situations. Because doing Nail Art I always became 4th, I decide to specialize in Pink & White as it was judged on skill not on the judges personal preferences. I was a machine in competing focused on the job and even when I was not 100% happy with the end result, consistency prevailed and I won competition after competition. I has thought me more about myself and the discipline required to obtain the goals you want to achieve…\n\nWinning these competitions was affirming my skill and was a great way to promote my academy. When winning time after time was is not challenging enough anymore, I started training and motivating students to compete. My vision was to train these numerous students to become better than me…learning them all about competitions, tips and tricks which are not found in books nor on You Tube. Great is the feeling when your team wins the Team Trophy during Nailympics London and to have had the opportunity to train these people to achieve this goal.\n\nAfter ticking all those boxes I have often been a judge in schools and competitions. I have a clear an open view I will always judge with the mentality to inspire people and to help competitors or students to work hard and harder every time. I have climbed the ladder and experienced it all and I have enjoyed all of it! I have never, ever had one day in my life that I said to myself… I’m too tired, I don’t feel like practicing… You know the saying: “Do what you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life” that saying is written on my body!\n\nTalk about ASAP Nails (shop hours, type of service, staff, prices, etc.?)\n\nASAP Nails & Beauty Supply is One Stop Shop and academy. We have a range of about 15.000 different SKU’s from nails to lashes, from facial products to depilatory and pedicure products. Furniture, Electrical appliances, all available from stock.\n\nOur Academy achieved its first Qfor-label in 2013 and has maintained its superior score of average 9.5/10 ever since. Qfor is a quality label which ensures the students they are being training according the highest level of education. This quality label is recognized by the government and gives the student the opportunity to request a scholarship from the government to learn and master the skill they want to learn.\n\nOur physical store is open from Mondays to Saturday. While or online store is open 24/7. Our goal is to provide the customers with the best customer service possible along with giving them the best advice while shopping.\n\nWhen winning time after time was is not challenging enough anymore, I started training and motivating students to compete.\n\nDo you service many X’treme Nailz Patrons?\n\nBelgium is more conservative in nail style, however we do service some great artists which could definitely be or become X’treme Nailz Patrons?\n\nWhat’s your personal philosophy/motto about X’treme Nailz?\n\nI would say the motto of Abstract® Professional Products would really suit X’treme Nailz as well. “Be bold or italic, never regular.”\n\nWhere do you see ASAP Nails & Beauty going in the next 10 years?\n\nAs we know the ASAP Nails & Beauty Supply-store concept is a true success story even during hard recession and pandemic times… we have always sustained and grown year after year. The aim is to be expand our store concept throughout Europe first. A dream come true would be opening a stores throughout the USA.\n\nGetting things done, one step after the other… that is how a run my business so who knows where this dream might take me.\n\nIs it correct that you do Nails, Manicure, and Pedicure Nail Art and Designer tips?\n\nYes, it’s correct. I used to do nails, manicures, pedicures, nail art. also sell hair removal and facial products along with lashes and make up.\n\nAre you doing any exporting of services outside of Belgium?\n\nOur company is well-known well in the industry. We sell our products throughout Europe and abroad, we even have a small amount of customers from USA, Iran & Egypt.\n\nWhat additional services do Abstract ® Professional Product provide?\n\nNext to the very extensive product range Abstract® Professional Products offers. The brand also provides students with the best and most profound training there is available. Our manuals and trainers are always on-trend and this is what makes our brand very successful… Knowledge is the key to success…\n\nIn America we occasionally put on Major Nail Seminars and Expos. Do they do the same thing in Belgium? If so, can you explain how that looks?\n\nYes also in Belgium there are Nail Seminars and Expo’s held. Twice a year there is Estetika Beauty Show, where all wholesalers are presenting the latest trends in the nail and beauty industry. When I compare trade shows in America versus Belgium you can say that the level of professionalism of the stands is far beyond what I have experiences in during Orlando Premier a few years ago.\n\nAs for Seminars, our company is known for its seminars as well as hosting the bigger events. A few\n\nyears ago we’ve done a national exam which we hosted for about 100 students + model. Also we introduced the Abstract® Ambassador competition, where the best nail tech are chosen to compete against each other to achieve the title of Abstract® Ambassador and being able to work with me very close. We give them a platform to get more media attention and making sure there get recognition for their talent.\n\nOverall how do you feel about the X’treme Nailz Movement that’s going on?\n\nTo be very honest, I had not heard of the X’treme Nailz Movement when I received your request to tell you more about my company. I do feel there is a lot of progress and future this movement can make."
