For the other 3 Kiss fans out there...the DVD's of Konfidential/X-treme Closeup (both on one DVD)) & Kiss My *** were released on Tuesday. I had no idea until I went into the store. I didn't watch them yet. They are in Stereo only on Surround.

Thanks for the heads up, Shawn. Now I won't have to transfer my VHS copies over to DVD-R.

Thanks for the Kiss info, though I already own both videos.

Xtreme/Konfidential since 2001 and Kiss my A** since 2003.

Both were released previously to the US in several countries.

And how's the quality? I was just about to pick these!

They look Ok, not an important improvement over the VHS tape. But they're better.

There's no extra stuff, though. Just simple menus to choose songs on Konfidential and Kiss my a**. Get them.
