X-treme Gymnastics does NOT close with any of the local school districts, as the roads are usually cleared by the time we open for evening classes. If you are ever in question, be sure to check our website, Facebook or Instagram. If nothing is posted online stating that we are closed, we are still open. If we close due to inclement weather, Recreational classes will receive a make up class. However, if we are open and you choose to not attend you must follow our cancellation policy in order to be eligible to receive a make up class. No call/no shows will NOT receive a make up class. Please see our cancellation policy for more information.
