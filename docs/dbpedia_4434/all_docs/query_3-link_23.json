        "text": "For half a century Centreville, the oldest surviving town in Wayne County, was also seat of justice. That changed in March of 1873 when a Circuit Court ruled Richmond the new county seat because it was the population center despite the fact Centreville was geographically more centrally located. As soon as the new courthouse was ready in August, county records were removed from the county seat to Richmond. All that remained was to dismantle the Centre Township jailhouse and the iron fence around it, and to transport the materials to Richmond.\n\nWork crews began the task in October, but found the work hampered when unidentified vandals destroyed the equipment.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Oct. 28, seven armed guards from Richmond paced to Centreville to occupy the sheriff’s jailhouse residence in order to watch over the contractor’s equipment. At around 11 p.m. a mob gathered in front of the jail and began firing pistols and demanding entrance, which the guards refused. Not satisfied, “Centreville ruffians” hauled out Black Betty, a six-pound cannon used to fire salutes on Independence Day. After filling it with iron scraps, nails and bolts, they aimed squarely at the jail. Two canon blasts erupted. The door of the jail was blown from its hinges. The face of the jail was marred with brick chunks blasted away.\n\nThe Richmond deputies retreated further into the recess of the jail, where they remained until about 4 a.m. when they were forced to surrender.\n\nThe guards were unceremoniously marched to the edge of town and ordered to “git” back to Richmond.\n\nThe “conflagration” made the front page of The New York Times, and the scars of the encounter are still visible on the front of the old sheriff’s residence, which is now the Centerville and Center Township Public Library.\n\nOver the front door are the holes in the wall made by the canon.\n\n►MORE OUT OF OUR PAST: Early days of Centreville, the oldest surviving town in Wayne County\n\nCentreville unfortunately had lost its county seat status. According to the Richmond Telegram, the pent-up wrath of the populace in the final moments as materials were loaded into wagons “unraveled and became unsanctified,” finding occasional utterances in incessant “groans and damns.”\n\nThe dispute was over. Yet the former county seat remains preeminent historically.\n\nCenterville residents have fought in all American wars and conflicts. Crown Hill Cemetery is testament to this.\n\nCivil War generals Ambrose E. Burnside and Lew Wallace are biographically tied to Centerville, as is George W. Julian, Wayne County’s only vice presidential candidate for the second highest office in the nation.\n\nSix U.S. governors spent their developmental years in Centreville.\n\nJames B. Ray, fourth governor of the state of Indiana and the youngest ever to hold the job, was a Wayne County prosecutor in 1819 who practiced law in Centerville from 1837 to 1840. John A. Burbank was born in Centerville in 1827 and later became Governor of the Dakota Territory. Joseph H. Kibbey was born in Centerville on March 4, 1853, and became the 16th Territorial Governor of Arizona. Whitewater native Ambrose E. Burnside came to Centerville about 1840 and worked as an assistant in a tailor shop; he later became a Union General in the Civil War and governor of Rhode Island. Lew Wallace was born in the upper Whitewater Valley in 1827 and attended Centerville’s Whitewater Seminary. He credited Centerville teacher Samuel K. Hoshour with instilling in him an ability to write, which served him well when he penned ‘Ben Hur: A Tale of the Christ’ as governor of New Mexico Territory from 1878 to 1881.\n\nGovernor Oliver P. Morton was born in Salisbury on August 4, 1823. He practiced law in Centerville and was Indiana’s famous Civil War governor.\n\nMorton led Indiana during the Civil War with no tax support for two years, which is unprecedented. Early on he raised men in arms and hundreds of thousands of dollars through loans and donations on his good name. President Lincoln said, “Had it not been for Governor Morton sending money and men to the front when most needed, the war probably would have been lost by the North.”\n\nMorton’s home in Centerville still exists.\n\nThe greatest athlete in Wayne County history was born in Centerville. A rambunctious little colt foaled there on April 4, 1910, humbly entered the world without benefit of human assistance. The ungainly little specimen was dubbed Single G. The ragged little horse was a super-horse hailed as “the greatest pacer of all time” and “the most marvelous piece of horseflesh every foaled.”\n\nThe Inter-State Publishing Company’s 1884 ‘History of Wayne County, Indiana’ comments on the former county seat by saying, “Rarely does it fall to the lot of any small place to be the home of so many eminent men, conspicuous in the affairs both of state and the nation, as have lived in Centreville.”\n\nWhat was said then is true now.\n\nAlthough Centreville has reversed its “re” to “er”, Centerville is home to people of imminence and dignity.\n\nThe once muddy ground surveyed as a town and recorded on Jan. 2, 1815, just 215 years ago this week, is hallowed ground not just for east central Indiana but also for the nation.\n\nContact columnist Steve Martin at stephenmonroemartin@gmail.com."
