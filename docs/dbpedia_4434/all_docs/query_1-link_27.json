For the unincorporated community in Georgia, see Merrillville, Georgia.\n\nTown in Indiana, United States\n\nMerrillville ( MAIR-əl-vil, locally [ˈmɛərvɪl]) is a town in Ross Township, Lake County, Indiana, United States. The population was 35,246 at the 2010 census. Merrillville is in east-central Lake County, in the Chicago metropolitan area. On January 1, 2015, Merrillville became the most populated town in Indiana, as Fishers in Hamilton County was converted from a town to a city. The town serves as a major shopping hub for Northwest Indiana.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Merrillville has a total area of 33.26 square miles (86.14 km2), of which 33.22 square miles (86.04 km2) (or 99.88%) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) (or 0.12%) is water.[4]\n\nThe town is centered on the intersection of U.S. Route 30 and Interstate 65.\n\nThe Lincoln Highway runs through Merrillville. The original alignment of Lincoln Highway is known as 73rd Avenue (also called Old Lincoln Highway) in Merrillville, while the current Lincoln Highway (US 30) is known as 81st Avenue. State Road 53 (Broadway) and State Road 55 (Taft Street) traverse the town from north to south.\n\nMerrillville's asymmetric shape results in numerous boundaries with other municipalities. It is bordered by Gary and unincorporated Calumet Township, Lake County, to the north; Hobart to the northeast; Union Township, Porter County, to the east; Winfield and Crown Point to the south; Schererville to the west; and Griffith to the northwest.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMerrillville occupies what used to be woodland belonging to the Potawatomi Indians. In 1834, a clearing was created for ceremonial purposes and called McGwinn Village. A year later, a white man, Jeremiah Wiggins, settled in the place; McGwinn Village became Wiggins Point.[5]\n\nWiggins Point became a well-known stop for wagon trains heading to Joliet, Illinois along the Sauk Trail (also called the Sac Trail), an old Indian trail. At one time, 16 trails radiated outward from Wiggins Point. In 1838, Wiggins died. Sometime afterward, local settlers renamed the place Centerville. Later still, it was renamed Merrillville after the brothers Dudley and William Merrill.[5] Dudley Merrill operated a hotel and store in Centerville, and his son John P. Merrill was a Township Trustee.[6]\n\nNearby, in the same former Potawatomi hunting grounds, other settlements had sprung up. Near Deep River creek was a settlement named Deep River; near Turkey Creek was another settlement with that creek's name. Others included Ainsworth, Lottaville, and Rexville. At one time, the post office for the area was named Lottaville.\n\nIn 1848, all of these settlements, including Merrillville (that is, the old McGwinn Village) were collected into one and called Ross Township. As time went by, bits and pieces of Ross Township were taken by Hobart and Crown Point when those towns incorporated.\n\nIn 1971, the area officially became Merrillville (which now includes the old Merrillville as well as other settlements nearby) and was incorporated as a town under Indiana law.[5] During this time, the majority of the town's growth was due to white flight from Gary.[7]\n\nIn 1993, Merrillville tried to annex unincorporated Winfield Township to get more land. The residents blocked Merrillville by creating the town of Winfield.[8]\n\nIn 2009, a pedestrian bridge at Hidden Lake Park collapsed, injuring at least 25 people[9][10] The catastrophe occurred around 10 PM after the annual Fourth of July fireworks display,[11] when several dozen people attempted to cross the wood suspension bridge.[12] Police officers stationed at either side of the bridge were unable to stop the advancing parkgoers, and with numerous people jumping up and down the 30-year-old bridge collapsed, sending somewhere around 50 people into the waters of Hidden Lake.\n\nThe Morgan-Skinner-Boyd Homestead and John Wood Old Mill are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.[13][14]\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nMerrillville is a hub for retail trade in Northwest Indiana. The US 30 corridor between Taft Street and Colorado Street harbors a large concentration of big-box retailers, hotels, restaurants, and automobile dealerships.\n\nAmeriplex at the Crossroads, an industrial and technology park, opened at Broadway between 93rd Avenue and 101st Avenue in 2005. The development is designated an Indiana Certified Technology Park and includes a business incubator and technology center operated by the Purdue Research Foundation.\n\nHeavy industry such as steelmaking and petroleum refining, which characterizes the economy of northern Lake County, does not have a significant presence in Merrillville. The town is home to the corporate headquarters of Fortune 500 energy company NiSource, hospitality management firm White Lodging, and Centier Bank, Indiana's largest privately owned independent bank.[15]\n\nMerrillville's nearest commercial airports are Griffith-Merrillville Airport in Griffith and Gary/Chicago International Airport in Gary.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 197015,918—198027,67773.9%199027,257−1.5%200030,56012.1%201035,24615.3%202036,4443.4%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the census[16] of 2020, there were 36,444 people and 15,176 households living in the town.
