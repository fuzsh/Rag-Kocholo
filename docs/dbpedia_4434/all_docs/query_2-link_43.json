        "text": "FIREFIGHTER TAKEN TO REID HEALTH AFTER CALL TO SW 4th STREET AREA\n\n(Richmond, IN)--One firefighter was taken to Reid Health after a call to South West 4th Street in Richmond Wednesday morning. Firefighters got the call at just before 9 o’clock and arrived to see smoke coming from the roof and windows. Shortly after efforts to get the fire under control began, a firefighter was reported as down. That firefighter was taken by ambulance to Reid Health for non-life-threatening injuries. No other injuries were reported. There’s no word yet on what caused the fire or the dollar amount of the damage.\n\nONE DEAD AFTER CRASH ON I-70\n\n(Wayne County, IN)--One crash in a slew of recent accidents on I-70 in Wayne County was a fatal one. It happened at 10:15 Wednesday morning just east of the Williamsburg Pike exit. Investigators say Rachel Ross of Richmond had slowed or stopped for construction in the westbound lanes when she was hit from behind by the driver of a pickup. Ross was sent to Reid Health. The driver of the pickup, who was from Maryland, was flown to Miami Valley Hospital where he was pronounced dead. His passenger also went to Reid with non-life-threatening injuries. Both westbound lanes of 70 were shut down until about 1 o’clock. The eastbound lanes were also shut down for a short time to allow a medical helicopter to land.\n\nOVERPASS DECK POURING TO TAKE PLACE THURSDAY\n\n(Richmond, IN)--The next major step in the Depot Overpass demolition and rebuild project is now set to take place Thursday. Crews will be pouring concrete for the new bridge deck. That means that North E Street and Elm Street will be closed between 2 and 10 o’clock Thursday morning. Residents in that area will need to move their vehicles by Wednesday night. The overpass is expected to reopen to traffic in a couple of months, although the entire project won’t be complete until the middle of next year.\n\nMAN JAILED ON STALKING CHARGE\n\n(Richmond, IN)--Early Wednesday morning, a Richmond man was taken to the Wayne County Jail and charged with felony stalking. 37-year-old Dwayne Cox was arrested in the 1500 block of South 9th and booked into jail at 3 o’clock Wednesday morning. He’s now being held on a $25,000 bond. He’s also charged with criminal trespass. Details of what led to the charges have not been released.\n\nORGANIZERS SUGGEST EARLY ARRIVAL FOR BRIDGE RENAMING SERVICE\n\n(Richmond, IN)--Wednesday afternoon is when the memorial service to rename the Chester Boulevard bridge over I-70 as the Seara Burton Bridge takes place. The ceremony takes place not at the bridge, but at the Richmond Police and Fire Training Center located at the south end of South 8th. The public is invited, but organizers are suggesting that members of the public arrive in advance of the 1 o’clock start time. Primary parking will be available on South 8th.\n\nCHAMPION TARGET CLOSES RICHMOND PLANT\n\n(Richmond, IN)--A Richmond manufacturing facility has closed its doors. Last week, according to an employee, the doors were closed at Champion on Industrial Parkway with little or no notice. Monday, a spokesperson from the parent company, Revelyst, confirmed the closure. It did not, though, specifically say why the plant is closing. In a prepared statement, a Revelyst spokesperson said that they had made the difficult decision to cease operations at the facility in Richmond and that they are exploring options to sell the plant. The statement does not provide the number of employees affected, but most industry websites indicate it is under a dozen.\n\nIU EAST BUSINESS SURVEY SHOWS MOSTLY POSITIVE RESULTS\n\n(Richmond, IN)--The IU East Business and Economic Research Center has released the results of an online survey that was taken nearly a year ago. 124 businesses responded across the Whitewater Valley. Here are some of the highlights: The single most eye-opening response is that 94% of local businesses said they had experienced a rise in the cost of doing business in the last year. Most of the other results were encouraging. Nearly all said they planned on maintaining or increasing capital investments this year. The majority of businesses said they would maintain or expand their employment. Two-thirds said they maintained or improved their profitability.\n\nTREE GROWN FROM SEEDS THAT TRAVELED AROUND THE MOON PLANTED AT ARBORETUM\n\n(Richmond, IN)--A tree has been planted at Hayes Arboretum with origins that are out of this world. A sweetgum tree was recently planted. The seeds of that tree traveled 270,000 miles to the moon and back as part of the Artemis I mission on a trip that took nearly a month to complete. The tree is cordoned off by fencing and is located near the Hayes History Museum and Nature Center.\n\nFOUCHE RESIGNS AS CORONER; RIPS INTO COUNTY LEADERS\n\n(Richmond, IN)--Kevin Fouche has resigned as Wayne County’s Coroner, but not before ripping into county leaders about how he perceives the value they place on the office. In his resignation letter, Fouche said \"I can no longer continue to serve in a role that is so blatantly undervalued and unsupported by those in power.\". Fouche had made a push to make the coroner’s position full time due largely to the fact that the case load had nearly doubled in the last two years. The Wayne County Coroner makes about $28,000 per year, but coroners with similar caseloads in other counties make at least twice that. A Republican caucus of precinct committeemen will pick Fouche’s replacement in the next couple of weeks.\n\nMAN CHARGED WITH DOING 90 MPH ON CHESTER BLVD WITH BAC OVER .15\n\n(Richmond, IN)--A man was taken into custody Monday night after allegedly doing 90 miles per hour down Chester Boulevard in Richmond with a blood alcohol content of at least twice the legal limit. 25-year-old Jayce Sheehy was finally stopped and taken into custody near the Dollar General at the southern end of Chester Boulevard near where the road is blocked for overpass construction. Sheehy’s alcohol content was over .15 when he was booked into jail at 8 o’clock Monday night, and that’s after he went to Reid Health first. He’s charged with felony intimidation and other OWI offenses.\n\nMAN WHO STABBED UTILITY WORKER FOUND GUILTY BUT MENTALLY ILL\n\n(Connersville, IN)--There’s a verdict in a Connersville attempted murder trial. In February of 2021, Devin Franklin stabbed a utility worker in an incident on Vermont Avenue. That worker sustained life-threatening injuries but recovered. Late Friday, Franklin was found guilty but mentally ill on one count of attempted murder. It was the third time Franklin had been charged with attacking someone. That includes July of 2020, when he was charged with battery resulting in injury to a public safety officer. In May of this year, Franklin was found competent to stand trial.\n\nCOOPER THE DOG REUNITED WITH OKLAHOMA FAMILY\n\n(Richmond, IN)--Cooper the dog is being reunited with his family. Earlier this month, Cooper’s family, who is from Oklahoma, made a camping stop in Richmond. Cooper ran away and could not be located. The family searched, but eventually had to return to the Tulsa area. Cooper’s picture and story then began to spread on social media and gained a wide following. Finally, after weeks on the loose, Cooper was secured over the weekend. His family arrived back in Richmond Sunday night to pick him up.

It happened Thursday morning in the 2000 block of South 15th. SWAT Team members and narcotics investigators executed a search warrant there and recovered 20 grams of fentanyl, meth, cocaine, heroin, and handguns. Three people were taken into custody, including 45-year-old Buddie Davis. Davis now faces 11 various dealing charges.

RPD Chief Kyle Weatherly said that investigators had been alerted to the drug operation by concerned neighbors.\n\nSATURDAY MARKS TWO-YEAR POINT SINCE SEARA BURTON SHOOTING\n\n(Richmond, IN)--Saturday marks the two-year point since RPD Officer Seara Burton was shot in the line of duty in an incident that would ultimately take her life. Thursday night, her department announced what’s called the Seara Burton 140 Challenge. It’s a 5K event that is intended to provide scholarships for local students to pursue higher education. It’s set to take place on September 28th at IU East. Meanwhile, the Chester Boulevard bridge over I-70 is set to be officially named for Seara in an event next week.\n\nTHREE CRASHES OCCUR IN THREE HOURS ON I-70 IN WAYNE COUNTY\n\n(Wayne County, IN)--There were three separate crashes on I-70 in Wayne County within a two-hour stretch Thursday afternoon. The first happened at 2:30 near the Mineral Springs Road overpass when a U-Haul driver went into the median. An hour later, three vehicles were involved in a crash in the eastbound lanes near the Chester Boulevard exit. Then, an hour after that, a semi crashed on I-70 near the Round Barn Road overpass. No serious injuries were reported in any of the crashes, although traffic was affected in each of them.\n\nSTATE INVESTIGATION INTO COLLEGE CORNER FINANCES CONTINUES\n\n(College Corner, OH)--It was a packed house Thursday night in College Corner as two new city council members were sworn in after four members of the previous council and multiple members of the village’s administration walked off the job. It all started in January, when newly-elected mayor Molly Cason was refused access to village offices and to financial records by village administrator Mike Sims and his daughter, Jennifer Woods. Now, there’s a state Ethics Board investigation into the town’s finances. Sims and Woods are two of the village officials who have resigned.\n\nGOLF CARTS ALLOWED ON MOST WINCHESTER STREETS\n\n(Winchester, IN)--Golf carts are about to become more prominent in Winchester for a couple of reasons after the Winchester City Council took action this week. First, council members voted to allow golf carts on any city street with a speed limit of 30 miles per hour or less. But, they can’t cross U.S. 27. Secondly, council granted approval for the Winchester Police Department to purchase its own golf cart to add to the city’s fleet of law enforcement vehicles. A department member told council that the golf cart will allow officers to more easily patrol events like fireworks and the upcoming Labor Day softball tournament.\n\nSURVEYING ERROR ADDS ONE MONTH TO EAST MAIN CONSTRUCTION TIME\n\n(Richmond, IN)--An error that added a month to construction time on East Main Street in Richmond will be addressed by the city’s Board of Public Works Thursday. The error means not only extra construction time, but a longer time that Uptown businesses must deal with the street closure. According to a change order in the original contract, design elevations in the original survey had conflicts at the site that added 33 days to the length of the project. The estimated completion date is now September 9. The city will pay $16,000 to have the area re-surveyed. That money will then be reimbursed by the design firm.\n\nTWO ARRESTED AFTER FIGHT INVOLVING WEAPONS\n\n(Richmond, IN)--What began as a shots fired call Wednesday night ended with the arrest of two men on identical felony charges. A fight escalated between 61-year-old Roy Brumfield and 53-year-old Robert Epps in the area of the 3900 block of National Road West at just after 6 o'clock Wednesday night. No one was shot, but both men were jailed on charges that include intimidation with a deadly weapon and battery. There’s no word yet on what led to the dispute.\n\nRICHMOND TEACHER NAMED FINALIST FOR TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n(Richmond, IN)--A Richmond Community School teacher has been named a finalist for Teacher of the Year by the Indiana Department of Education. She’s Shelly Swain, who is a teacher at Starr Elementary. There are more than 65,000 teachers in public schools across Indiana and Swain is now one of ten finalists. None of the other nine finalists for teacher of the year are from our area.\n\nMURDER TRIAL OFF; SUSPECT TO PLEAD GUILTY\n\n(Richmond, IN)--A bench trial in a Richmond murder case that was supposed to have begun this coming Monday is now off. That’s because 68-year-old Tommy Earl has filed notice of intent to plead guilty. Earl was charged with slashing the throat and killing 59-year-old Michelle Peacock in June of last year at a gazebo outside the Merle Henderson Apartments on South 14th. According to an affidavit, the two had been arguing about the gazebo. Earl told investigators that he had no regrets and would do it again. He is now set to be sentenced in October.\n\nSMITH HILL'S NEXT STEP IS DEVELOPMENT PLAN\n\n(Richmond, IN)--Richmond Mayor Ron Oler has talked about the next steps now that zoning has been approved for the Smith Hill residential development on the city’s southeast side. \"The next step will be the detailed development plan. During this step, a detailed drainage plan and a traffic impact study will be required among other additional details pertaining to the development,\" Oler said. That’s the first of three steps. And, Oler said this to the people who live nearby: \"I want to assure the public that our professional planning department and engineers will work diligently to ensure that the development does not negatively impact the neighborhoods surrounding it.\" Nearby residents overwhelming oppose the project, while city and business leaders favor it.\n\nRECREATIONAL POT SALES NOW LEGAL WITHIN 25 MILES OF RICHMOND\n\n(Oxford, OH)--As of Tuesday, recreational marijuana can now be legally and easily purchased 25 miles from Richmond. Tuesday marked the first day that marijuana can be purchased in Ohio without any type of medical designation.
