        "text": "Centerville’s council authorized a $55,800 study of the town’s water system to find lead pipes and discussed implementing an extra $125 fee for property owners if lawns aren’t maintained.\n\nWater lines\n\nDuring its May 9 meeting, council unanimously approved a proposal from Lochmueller Group to conduct Phase 1 of a lead line inventory before an approaching federal deadline.\n\nBecause of previous contracts, Lochmueller already has records related to the town’s water works. Thus, Council President Dan Wandersee said Lochmueller will be faster and cheaper than hiring another firm.\n\nThe town replaced some of its oldest service lines two years ago for about $2.2 million. At that time, full replacement could have cost $10-$15 million.\n\nOnly three of the town’s subdivisions were built after the 1990s, and some of those might even have lead lines.\n\nThe town is already gathering lead samples from residents as required. So far, they have been under the acceptable limit, but the level could be lowered in the future.\n\nLawn maintenance\n\nSome Centerville officials want to charge an additional $125 administrative fee beyond the fines now being issued to “repeat offenders” who haven’t mowed their grass this year.\n\nGerald Millsaps, who oversees code enforcement, said the fee would cover employees’ time and costs for visiting the property, invoicing the owner, and adding liens.\n\nHowever, an administrative fee would be waived if owners quickly pay the fee—up to $2,500—and resolve the concern.\n\nIf vegetation is at least 8 inches tall, owners now receive a warning letter and 10 days before fines are issued. The last two fines were $250 each.\n\nMillsaps estimates cleanup of one property blighted by honeysuckle and 3-foot-tall grass will cost $1,000.\n\nTown Manager Kevin Slick said some communities already charge an administrative fee.\n\nBecause ordinance(s) might need amending, council will consult town attorney Ed Martin before the 7 p.m. May 30 work session (a public meeting).\n\nBefore or after receiving a letter, Millsaps urged residents struggling to maintain properties to contact him at (765) 855-5515 and he’ll find someone to mow it.\n\nAnd, if contacted, Jack Bodiker said some of his fellow councilors might seek volunteers to help someone in need.\n\n“Don’t ignore (notices),” Millsaps said. “Give the office a call and we’ll work with you, not just grass, but any violation. We’ll work through it.”\n\nIn other business"
