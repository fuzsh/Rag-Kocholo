        "text": "Beautifully decorated sugar cookies from Saturday night's banquet at the Macedonia Christian Church in Okeana, Ohio, symbolize Saturday's spring day that began early in Spiceland, Indiana, and included some interesting stops.\n\nI decided to make a full day of it on Saturday. New Castle English teacher, author, and friend Annette Goggin had an early-morning reading and book signing at the Spiceland, Indiana library, and invited me to attend.\n\nI wanted to hear her speak and enjoy the company of those attending at this sweet little library so capably managed by Kathy Painter. The only problem was I had an early-evening banquet in Ohio, and the structure of the day would leave me with an odd amount of extra time, yet it didn't make sense to drive back home only to head in the opposite direction again so quickly.\n\nSo I decided to make a day of it, and meander my way to Ohio. And isn't extra time a beautiful and rare commodity, no matter the amount?\n\nAfter Annette's enjoyable program, she and I enjoyed a nice catch-up lunch here, in Cambridge City.\n\nMain Street Sweets Cafe & Ice Cream Parlor, formerly known as The Pour House, is an ideal spot for a soup-and-sandwich lunch. Thank you, Annette, for treating me! But you didn't need to.\n\nAs I looked around the cafe, moments before Annette arrived, I spotted her collection of life stories, Home: Three Houses, beautifully displayed (and for sale). And of course when she arrived, a photo was in order.\n\nAnnette with her book in Main Street Sweets in Cambridge City. What a lovely display.\n\nAfter a nice lunch and even nicer chat, Annette headed home to get some things done, and of course, grade papers. An AP high school English teacher's work is never done! But OH! How I love English teachers. Some of my favorite people are English teachers.\n\nIf you haven't been to Cambridge City in a while, you should go. The downtown is absolutely charming and thriving with an abundance of quality antiques and gift shops as well as places to eat and visit. The downtown was hopping Saturday.\n\nWith the luxury of time on my hands, I slipped next door to one of my favorite stores, Building 125, and browsed around at the lovely displays created by owner and town benefactor Norma Bertsch. Whether buying antiques, accessories, or gathering inspiration, I always find those things here. Saturday, I picked up some of my perennial favorites from this store: beautiful vintage-inspired dish towels.\n\nAnd outside, at the entryway, are twin urns so beautifully styled...\n\nBy the time I left Building 125, we were solidly into the afternoon. I could do more shopping before traveling on to Ohio, but I had other things on my mind. While I didn't have stacks of English papers to grade, I did have a tote bag in the back seat loaded with projects.\n\nSo I did what I often do when I have a chunk of alone time. (And here is my little secret.) I found a quiet, sunny spot, preferably in a church parking lot somewhere, rolled down my windows, stretched out in my car's back seat, and (ahhhh!) got to work.\n\nHere's why I like a quiet, remote spot. I prefer to revise my programs by reading them aloud. It's the best way to weed out wordiness. So I read and reworked the evening's program, Bloom Before You're Planted.\n\nI had more work in that bag. There was the final lesson before summer break for Bible Study Fellowship, due Monday, and notes and photos that need condensed and placed in order for Wednesday's (6:30 a.m.!!) program to the New Castle Morning Optimists. This one is a debut of what it was like to cover the presidential inauguration. Unfortunately, time has a way of evaporating and I didn't get to those before I meandered on to ...\n\nPeople think of Indiana as flat. Being from Union County, where it is suddenly not, I never thought of the Hoosier state that way until I moved farther west.\n\nWhen you travel from non-flat Union County toward Brookville, and then southwest into Ohio, oh my! It is anything but flat. As per instructions from Judy Leary, who invited me to speak at the Macedonia Christian Church's spring women's banquet, I took the back roads to get to the Macedonia Christian Church.\n\nThere was no good place to pull over to capture the beautiful views, the ribbons of road, and the emerging green that filled my windshield, but I sure did enjoy the drive, with Judy's instructions through the back roads landing me perfectly here ...\n\nI know ... isn't it lovely?\n\nAnd inside, the loveliness continued ...\n\nAnd even a poster announcing my program ...\n\nAfter a pitch-in meal featuring delicious soups, fresh vegetables, dips, and desserts, I presented my newly revised program to a wonderful group of attentive women with cheerful smiles and encouragement beaming from their faces.\n\nJudy was in the front, and I watched her smiling face as I continued. They were all so kind and welcoming. In fact, a companion poster to the above, welcomed me personally! It was so much fun.\n\nJudy sent me home with this \"purse\" of succulents.\n\nI left the church at 7 with the sun shining brightly as I enjoyed the peaceful evening drive back to Indiana, then northwest toward home. It was solidly dark by the time I rolled into home, dozed off during my evening bath, and was sleeping by 10.\n\nThank you Annette, Judy, and the Macedonia Church women for this scrapbook-look at the last Saturday in April. And thank you, Lord, for more memories to treasure from this season of life.\n\nThe Fishers United Methodist Church Book Club is an author's dream as the members come to the discussion with notes, comments, and even ideas for a sequel or new series.\n\nDuring this life season as a regional author, there is no greater treat than for a book club to feature one of mine and then invite me in for the wrap-up discussion.\n\nThis honor came last night at the Fishers United Methodist Church when its book club discussed That Sweet Place: At Home in the Heartland as the monthly pick.\n\nIt was beyond my pleasure to join the group members. They had read my first book, Sweetland of Liberty Bed & Breakfast, a couple years ago, and I got to attend that discussion too.\n\nIt’s interesting how these opportunities present themselves. Since the bulk of Brian’s career was spent at Fishers Junior High, you’d think his connections created my link to this group. Or, maybe it had to do with our daughter-in-law, Allison, being from Fishers, or son Sam and Allison making their home there ...\n\nBut no, it all came about through a friend in New Castle, Mary Malone, who gifted my first book to her bestie, Rita. Rita in turn shared the book with her Fishers book club that consists of retired Fall Creek Elementary School teachers. One of the members, Kay, also shared the book with her second book club at church and the connection was made!\n\nAs with discussion of the first book, this group had an hour and a half of questions and comments, delving into plot, character, theme, and opinions. They “got” my books. One member shared how she laughed aloud at the chicken-coop-home-tour scene. Another said she thought Oh, don’t do it without consulting Sam! when Stan was offered a special opportunity.\n\nOne said his favorite character was Joy, the boarder. Another had a complaint. He said with a minor character, Krista, I switched back and forth from Kris to Krista, and he found it confusing. (I didn’t tell him that while I did that on purpose, and maybe shouldn’t have, I kept forgetting if the character’s name was Krista or Kristin!)\n\nThe same gentleman had an idea for a new series whereby I would write short stories about guests who come stay at the inn.\n\nI thanked them for their thoughtful questions, their time caring about the books and the characters and the town as well as for their ideas. One lady gently said, “We care about your characters.”\n\nThank you to so many – to Mary, Rita, Kay, the facilitator Kim, and to everyone who took the time to read and comment and care about these books. It was a lovely evening.\n\nA book club’s laser-like focus is a reminder of the privilege and the thrill of seeing one’s stories in print and living this dream and this season of wherever this journey takes me.\n\nLast night’s stop was in Fishers, but the ride home was on Cloud Nine.\n\nThree black urns with greens inside add a little color and life to the front of our garage doors. The tiny trees are in full-on growth mode right now.\n\nThis is just the time of year that makes me antsy. Every day, the trees and shrubs have filled out significantly more than the day before. The grass looks like a lush, Irish-green shag carpet, and once again, the ash tree survives the nasty ash borer disease that has taken down many a beauty in recent years.\n\nWe have plenty of yard work needing done. Our side of the white vinyl fence behind our property needs washed, there is weeding, and pruning, and plenty more to do if we were ambitious about such things.\n\nBut what calls my name are the vacancies at the end of the black chains dangling on the back porch as well as on my topiary-styled pole on the front. I want to pick up a bridal veil for its designated spot by the front door (the most ideal spot for this plant that could possibly exist and I take full advantage of it yearly). And I want to fill the back porch with huge Boston ferns.\n\nThose Bostons have been taunting me at a particular grocery store where I can get them cheaper than at several other locations. So I’m playing beat the clock. Will they be sold out by the time I feel sure the weather will cooperate with their outdoor digs?\n\nI wish somebody would just say when, and I would know that the time had come.\n\n“Have you got your ferns yet?” a friend asked a week or more ago. I don’t dare yet. I looked at the weather for the next week and it looks promising. But that takes me only to April 29 and then I remember my mother saying to hold off with outdoor annuals until May 10.\n\nOthers say May 1 or Mother’s Day. But my mother seemed to know best. True, the porch is covered. But still. I don’t want to buy them only to see them turn brown and ratty, and then go to the trouble and expense of having to replace them with the second, inferior wave of smaller Bostons.\n\nToday, the neighbors and Brian played beat the clock and mowed and worked their yards, getting a jump on not only the weekend but the rain said to move in tomorrow. I did some landscape weeding.\n\nThe plastic bin resembled a salad bowl with green trimmings piled high. A couple weeks ago I bought tiny cone-shaped evergreens for the black urns in front of the garage doors. I like the greens in the urns but they tend not to last beyond a couple of years so I didn’t invest too much. For now they are growing like, well, weeds.\n\nI’d rather have a sunny Saturday tomorrow than rain, as though I got to decide such things. But the rain is needed and will encourage the growth and nourish the soil.\n\nSo, I’ll wait patiently for the Bostons to take their places, for the bridal veil to welcome front-door guests, and for May 10 to hit the calendar, assuring me, as did my mother all those years, that the time has come.\n\nYessir, patience.\n\nThat is, unless of course, I cave.\n\nA bin of clippings yanked from the landscaping. Kind of looks like a salad bowl of greens.\n\nThis lovely plant was a gift from the Henry County Extension Homemakers. It's under cover on a stand on the back porch.\n\nWESTWARD-HO! The view as I headed west toward home on The National Road (U.S. 40) after visiting Centerville Thursday night.\n\nLast night’s stop took me to Centerville, Indiana, for an evening with the Opportunity Extension Homemakers Club. We met in the local senior center. It was an easy drive taking the back roads after work at the newspaper in New Castle.\n\nThe club’s president, the soft-spoken Peggy, allowed me a thoughtful courtesy, an offer to give my talk early in the meeting and then leave whenever I wished while club business unfolded.\n\nThe ladies were attentive and several picked up books, for which I’m grateful. It’s the second time I’ve given a program in this town where I don’t suppose I truly know anyone here anymore, but I know the place well. Consider:\n\nAlthough they had passed on long before I was born, both my maternal grandparents were from Centerville. The homes where they lived more than a century ago still stand – one a regal two-story brick back a short lane next to the old Abington School – and the other a blue, two-story on The National Road in town, practically across the street and a little east of the home of Indiana’s Civil War governor, Oliver P. Morton.\n\nThe Centerville home of Indiana's Civil War Governor Oliver P. Morton.\n\nThere remains no family remnant of my own in the town where two branches of my family tree merged, but my grandparents are buried in the town’s large cemetery.\n\nWhenever I go to Union County, I take the country road through Abington so I can pass the one-time farm home of my maternal grandfather. My mom often spoke of the threshing dinners, draft horses and fun she had staying with her grandparents there in the summer. Of course it’s been out of her family for decades, but I stare all the same.\n\nCenterville has unique, preserved architecture with unique arches and well-kept homes that sit with no frontage on The National Road. Back when I spent more time in antiques stores, I enjoyed the bounty in this town.\n\nDusk is falling as I roll west out of town on The Old National Road. The homes are distinctively Centerville.\n\nAnd let’s be frank! As a teen I liked to chase boys in this town. We’ll leave it at that.\n\nIn more recent years, my friend Gay and I took our summer girlfriend getaway to Centerville. We stayed at the gorgeous Lantz Inn, which now appears as a private residence. We also visited Warm Glow Candle, The Enchanted Sled and tried to get the attention of the Midwest Living scout who was there researching the topic of girlfriend getaways. One of these days I’ll have to share that story on this blog. The fun thing is we ended up in Midwest Living anyway when I wrote about our time there and they printed what I wrote along with a photo!\n\nFor years this was The Lantz House Inn. My friend Gay and I stayed there one weekend -- the same weekend Midwest Living was visiting.\n\nSo a trip to Centerville, a town my mother loved for her memories visiting grandparents on their farm, is also a trip down memory lane of another kind for me.\n\nOnce my part Thursday night was finished, the business meeting resumed and after a bit I decided to go ahead, pack up, and leave. I didn’t want to interrupt the women for photos so instead, I took these few on my way out of this town -- a town distinctive to me for roots – and for memories in the making.\n\nUntil next time ...\n\nI'll be back soon to Centerville. Next time, it's a book signing during the spring open house at the beautiful Warm Glow Candle complex from 10-6 Friday, May 5. Stop by and say hi.\n\nWhen my hairdresser moved my appointment from 10 to 11:30 this morning, I was happy. I thought I could fly through the day-off to-do list before settling into the chair.\n\nSurely I’d have time to straighten the house (I am officially the messy one in this household); tinker with my script for tomorrow night's program about this writing journey; to whip up a blog (which I’m doing as we speak) and to squeeze in a couple of other chores such as finding a recipe online for an Easter dish my daughter-in-law requests I make, rescheduling a dental visit and starting my week’s Bible Study Fellowship lesson.\n\nClearly, I over-estimated what I could accomplish, and under-estimated the time it takes, as I tell Brian, “to be me.”\n\nI seem to work best mornings, then get a new burst of morning energy at night. Today I’ve got to get busy this afternoon too because this morning won’t cut the must-do list, let alone the more ambitious want-to-do one.\n\nI could scrap the blog post today, and who would care? As much as I enjoy having people tell me they read my blog or someone I would least expect will make a reference to a post, I suppose that the answer is, I would be the one who would care if I didn't post.\n\nThis is my twice-a-week sharing of randomness about what’s going on around these parts.\n\nIf you are a writer yourself, you’ve probably read articles or even books about what a writer or author should do to promote his or her work. The general name for this is “building a platform.” That means creating a place where your readers connect with your writing, get to know you, and hopefully, want more.\n\nBlogging is a huge expectation within a platform, and a big no-no is to leave readers hanging. We are to be consistent in posting. So if you read this out of curiosity, are just stopping by for the first time, or have been reading my columns in the New Castle Courier-Times for years, welcome and please visit again.\n\nIf you want more information about the speaking programs I offer or where I’ll be on this promotional road (spring is by far my busiest season) check out the CONTACT tab above. Maybe we’ll connect along the way.\n\nUntil then – or until my next post – I’d best get busy and try to get at least one more thing done before these roots get covered!\n\nBy the way, if you are a blogger and read my posts, would you please take a moment and share your links and plug your own blogs and websites? I’d love sharing those with my readers and also check out your work for myself.\n\nIt’s been a cold, windy few days. But then, that’s part of the season. Still, spring cannot be held back.\n\nI felt certain the wind would strip off the lavishly beautiful display on our backyard tree. Yet those blossoms are hanging on for dear life. I noticed a while ago the layers of color in the setting: the lovely green of the grass, the vibrant blue sky, the blossoms and white fence.\n\nYesterday Brian and Sam ran off to The Great American Ballpark to see the Cincinnati Reds play and win. I was concerned for them with the wind and possible rain but they weren’t complaining as they dressed for the occasion in layers and added rain gear on top. They had a good time.\n\nThen last night, Bob Jenkins, whose career as an auto-racing broadcaster took him all over the world covering every kind of auto sport you can name, gave a charming presentation at the Henry County Historical Society. I wanted to go because Bob is from my hometown of Liberty, and so I covered it for our paper. When I was mentioned to him as from his hometown, he took a moment to connect the dots and mentioned that his brother and mine were best friends and to tell my brother, Tim, hi for him. It was a good night.\n\nEven though I’m not an avid race fan, many in my family are, and it was fun to hear his stories and I was also reminded of the spectacular month of May in Indiana, which I associate with the Indy 500 and a great time of year to be a Hoosier.\n\nTomorrow Pendleton friends and family will say goodbye during the celebration of life for Tim Redmond at Ovid Community Church. Tim’s wife Patty is a member of my life group, The Midlife Moms, and we’ll be helping out with the dinner as well as attending the memorial service for a wonderful man.\n\nFor now, there are Friday chores to see to. The sun is shining, the dog is napping and we’re off to the grocery store. What are you and yours up to this weekend?"
