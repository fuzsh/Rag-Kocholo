        "text": "Welcome to Jason Stewart State Farm Agency located in Centerville, Indiana. I grew up in Darke County, Ohio where my wife, Shelby, and I currently reside with our son Colson and dog, Maggie. After graduating from Wright State University in 2017 with a financial services degree I decided to start my career with State Farm Insurance. I opened my office in December, 2021 after taking over for State Farm agent Jim Bertch in Connersville, Indiana. Our local State Farm office is happy to help you with your car insurance, renters/ home insurance, rental property insurance, boat insurance, fleet insurance, business, electric vehicle, farm/ranch, financial services, liability, motorcycle, auto, and life Insurance. Our office is licensed in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky so we can help your friends and family out of state. We also offer Gainsco Auto Insurance and can help with state minimum liability policies including Sr-22 insurance. We also can help with Flood Insurance policies, offer Certificate of Deposit accounts, and many other options. Reach out today!\n\nMy team consists of Jessica Gabbard and Harrison Seybold. We are excited to get involved in our local communities to help make a difference every day. Stop by for a cup of coffee and let us check your insurance to make sure you have the right insurance coverage for you and your family as well as make sure you have all the discounts you qualify for.
