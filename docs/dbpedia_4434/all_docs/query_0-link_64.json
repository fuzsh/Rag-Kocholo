Here’s a short overview of some of the things Merrillville, Indiana, has to offer you and your family:\n\nLocation\n\nLocated in the east-central portion of Lake County in the Chicago metropolitan area, Merrillville is home to nearly 35,000 people. The city is located conveniently right off U.S. 30 and I-65, giving visitors and residents easy access to shopping malls, restaurants, expressways, and much more. Merrillville is only a 45-minute drive from Chicago, making it a great city for commuters or Chicago sports fans.\n\nOne of our favorite aspects of Merrillville is that it offers the best of both worlds. To the north and west, you’ll find one of the greatest metropolitan areas in the country.

Whether you’re spending a day in the heart of Chicago or heading out on the water in Lake Michigan just a handful of miles away, Merrillville is the perfect city for those who want a little bit of everything.\n\nDirections/Map: Google Maps — Merrillville\n\nHistory\n\nThe first residents of the Merrillville area were members of the Potawatomi tribe. In 1834, a cleared portion of the forested area was used for ceremonies and was called McGwinn Village. Once the first European settlers to the area set up camp here to make a waystation for wagons en route to Joliet, the village’s name was changed to Wiggins Point.\n\nIn 1838, settlers in the area changed the name to Centerville, and sometime after, the brothers Merrill played an important part in the community. To honor them, the town was named Merrillville. In 1848, Merrillville and the surrounding settlements were collected under the name of Ross Township until 1971, when all the township was given the name Merrillville. Today, the city stretches across 31 square miles, with 53rd Avenue as its northern border, 101st Avenue to the south, and Whitcomb Street and the county line serving as the west and east boundaries, respectively.\n\nOutdoor Recreation\n\nThere is certainly no shortage of outdoor activities in the Merrillville area.
