It was dedicated as Wernle Orphan’s Home on May 4, 1879 after a bequest made in the name of Rev. Carl Wernle, Lutheran Pastor in Galion, Ohio. Children have always been the focus of Wernle’s ministry. A commitment to providing the quality care that enables growth and success has defined who we are. Wernle has transitioned from a historic children’s home into a residential treatment facility that offers help to youth in Indiana and Ohio.Wernle serves emotionally and behaviorally handicapped youth of all religious, social, economic, racial and ethnic backgrounds. Most have been victims of abuse, neglect, abandonment, sexual exploitation, and family substance abuse. Many suffer from a variety of psychological and psychiatric problems. For some of them, Wernle literally represents their last, best hope of acceptance and assistance. The treatment philosophy focuses on a child’s ability to learn to live successfully outside the treatment environment. Wernle’s continuum of care includes therapy, education, and independent living and job skills training. We have served thousands of residents over the years in Richmond. As a non-profit, we continue to help our youth through the generosity of others through Annual Fund donations, Gift in Kind donations, and Event Sponsorships.\n\nMaps\n\nGoogle Map – Map of Hagerstown"
