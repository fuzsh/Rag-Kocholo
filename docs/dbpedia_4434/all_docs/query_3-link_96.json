        "text": "Fortis College, formerly known as RETS College, is located in Centerville, Ohio, which is approximately eight miles south of Dayton, Ohio. The College occupies one building, which is a 56,800-square foot building on a modern, nine-acre campus. All residential-based classes and labs are held at this location, which include high fidelity simulation, HVACR, medical assisting, nursing, dental assisting, and science labs. There are over 200 computer workstations and over 2,000 volumes and periodicals.\n\nAt Fortis College, we are dedicated to providing quality, career-ready training in several of today’s emerging industries. We prepare our students not only for future careers but for individual growth as well. Through written and interpersonal communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving competencies, Fortis College graduates are ready for whatever future opportunities they choose to pursue in their selected fields of study.\n\nFortis College currently offers residential and hybrid programs. The diploma program in Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration (HVACR) is offered in a fully residential format with classes taught at the campus. The diploma programs in Medical Assisting, Dental Assisting, and Practical Nursing are offered in a hybrid delivery format, where portions of the program are offered both on campus and online.\n\nThe Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) program prepares students for entry-level positions as a registered nurse (RN). According to the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (www.bls.gov), employment of RNs is expected to grow much faster than the average for all occupations over the next 10 years from 2014-2024. This growth trend for RNs will occur for a number of reasons, including an increased emphasis on preventive care, growing rates of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and obesity, and demand for healthcare services from the baby-boom population, as they live longer and more active lives. Medical assisting is a solid career choice for those who want to work in the healthcare field. Medical assistants work mostly in primary care, a steadily growing sector of the healthcare industry. Medical assistants perform clinical and administrative duties in doctor’s offices, group practices, clinics, and healthcare facilities. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of medical assistants is expected to grow much faster than the average for all occupations over the next 10 years. As access to healthcare expands and as the population ages, physicians will hire more assistants to perform duties, which will allow physicians to see more patients.\n\nThe Dental Assisting program at Fortis College prepares students for entry-level positions assisting dentists chair-side and in the dental office. As dental practices continue to grow, more dental assistants will be needed. Job opportunities for dental assistants nationally are expected increase over the next 10 years according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As the large baby-boom population ages, and as people keep more of their original teeth than did previous generations, the need to maintain and treat teeth will continue to increase the need for dental care.\n\nJob opportunities nationally for HVAC and refrigeration technicians and installers are expected to be excellent over the next 10 years according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which also indicates that a growing number of HVACR technicians are receiving postsecondary instruction from technical and trade schools, like Fortis College. The College’s HVACR program will prepare students for entry-level positions in this growing career field. The increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and pollution reduction is likely to increase the demand for HVACR installers as climate-control systems are retrofitted, upgraded, or replaced entirely.\n\nPrograms\n\nNursing\n\nAssociate Degree in Nursing\n\nWith advancements in medicine and our aging population, there will be continuous need for nurses for years to come. At FORTIS, you can develop the personal, academic and clinical skills to care for patients of all ages, ethnicities, and cultural groups in a variety of clinical settings.\n\nPractical Nursing\n\nWith advancements in medicine and our aging population, there will be continuous need for nurses for years to come. At FORTIS, you can develop the personal, academic and clinical skills to care for patients of all ages, ethnicities, and cultural groups in a variety of clinical settings.\n\nSkilled Trades\n\nIn our skilled trade programs, you will learn the knowledge and hands-on skills that will allow you to make a difference doing something you love to do. Our comprehensive skilled trades program curriculum combines traditional classroom instruction with situational and practical learning experiences to prepare students for an entry-level position.\n\nHVACR\n\nAs today’s heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration systems become more complex, trained HVAC technicians are critical to maintaining healthy, comfortable environments in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings.\n\nHealthcare / Medical\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, healthcare and medical career opportunities are forecast to grow over the next decade, due in part to our aging population and increased need for healthcare. Fortis offers a variety of medical and healthcare training programs to help meet this need.\n\nMedical Assisting\n\nMedical assistants fill a critical role in the healthcare system. Working directly with doctors and nurses, and often directly with patients, medical assistants can be employed in a wide variety of healthcare settings including physicians’ offices, clinics, hospitals and even rehabilitation centers and long-term care facilities.\n\nDental\n\nThe dental assisting and dental training programs at Fortis Colleges and Institutes help students acquire the skills and knowledge they need to demonstrate competency required for relevant licensing and getting started on a new career. Dental assistants and dental hygienists are critical members of the healthcare team and Fortis’s dental training programs can help prepare you for a new career.\n\nDental Assisting\n\nWhile specific duties may vary, dental assistants are an integral part of the dental office. The Fortis Dental Assisting program will prepare students for entry-level positions in this growing healthcare field.\n\nGraduate Testimonials\n\nGraduate Testimonials\n\nThe atmosphere at Fortis was really good because it was a smaller classroom setting for me and that is what I needed in order to be able to focus.\n\nTarin M.\n\nGraduate Testimonials\n\nThe foundation that Fortis has laid for me has allowed me the knowledge and the clinical skills to be published in a book as one of the worldwide healthcare leaders of America.\n\nValeshia M.\n\nGraduate Testimonials\n\nFortis College changed my life and gave me so many opportunities I never would have gotten otherwise.\n\nStephanie T.\n\nGraduate Testimonials\n\nThe IT security skills that I learned at Fortis are coming right into play, and I enjoy what I get to do on a day- to-day basis.\n\nSimon I.\n\nGraduate Testimonials\n\nWhat I do now is I worked for a skilled nursing facility here in Utah and I just love the people, I love being able to take care of the people and help them and their families.\n\nBeth S.
