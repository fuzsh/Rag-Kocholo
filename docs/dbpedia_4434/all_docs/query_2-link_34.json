The candle store spans 22,000 square feet and sells over 60 fragrances of candles, home decor, chocolates, gourmet food, bath and body products, jewelry, Indiana craft beer and wine and local crafts,\" the Silly America says.\n\n\"There’s even a cafe (Stone Hearth Cafe) to stop in for a snack and they pride themselves on having the best restrooms on I-70. Stop by the store during the day to check out the world’s largest candle outside and do a little souvenir shopping inside. If you stop by at night, after store hours, you won’t be able to shop, but you can see the roadside attraction glow.\n\n\"While the wick of the giant decorative pillar-style candle doesn’t actually get set on fire (the candle itself is not actually made of functioning candle wax, it’s merely a statue), external lights beamed onto its surface give it the feeling of a real, warm, flickering candle.\"\n\n\"Mammoth decorative pillar-style candle attached to the exterior of a candle store. Not a real candle, of course, but still imparts that cozy atmosphere to the outdoors,\" the Roadside America says.\n\n\"The billboard reads \"Candles! And so much more!\" The so much more consists of a garden shop with a giant rooftop watering can, a pen full of ugly female peacocks, and a mini airplane museum in the men's restroom. The Model-T collection is gone -- only one remaining vehicle rusts away in the bushes. The three smaller giant candles at the entrance were pretty cool.\n\n\"The World's Largest Candle is impressive. Visited during an overnight stop in the area. The candles at the entrance are equally impressive.\"\n\n\"Midwesterner Alan & Jackie Carberry created Warm Glow Candle Company in the basement of their home in 1994. Their goal was to create their vision of a perfect candle. After many tedious months of working with several combinations, they finally accomplished their goal and succeeded in creating a candle that is highly fragrant, long lasting, clean burning, and cost effective. They had a candle they were proud to give the name, “Warm Glow.”\n\n\"In 2000, Warm Glow Candle Company purchased Sweet Liberty Candle Company, originally founded in Lancaster, PA. The quality and primitive look of these candles appealed to the public and the owners of Warm Glow. The pairings and ultimate blending of these two companies was a positive step in the growth of business,\" the official website says.\n\n\"Warm Glow has kept the original ideas of the Sweet Liberty Company and incorporated new and enhanced scents to the expanding product line. In addition, Warm Glow continuously tests and develops new fragrances to fulfill our growing customer requests.- With the tremendous growth of business and popularity of Warm Glow candles, the company expanded production. Warm Glow is now housed in an 80,000 Sq. Ft. facility with the capacity of producing up to 15,000 candles per day.\"\n\n\"If you’ve ever headed north and then along I-70 around Richmond and Centerville, Indiana, you’ve likely seen signs for the Warm Glow Candle Company Outlet. This candle outlet near Cincinnati is known for many things and truly is a great stop during a road trip or as a destination on its own. Visit one of the world’s largest candles, as well as its 22,000-square-foot store and be charmed by this roadside attraction near the Queen City,\" the Only In Your State says.\n\n\"The Warm Glow Candle Company Outlet is a charming, albeit quirky, roadside attraction near Cincinnati that's worth a trip to I-70. Visit for the selection of candles and decor (and don't forget to check out the restrooms) and plan a return trip, since you're bound to fall in love with this candle outlet near Cincinnati.\n\n\"Warm Glow Candle Company offers their candles in retailers all over the country but nothing beats a visit to their candle outlet near Cincinnati. It’s a warm, friendly place with quirky attractions and plenty of candles, decor, gourmet foods, and more, making this stop along I-70 a worthy destination from our city.\"\n\n\"Serving rural Indiana since the early 2000s, Warm Glow Candle Company produces oddly textured candles that seem like they’re from an ancient era of life,\" the Atlas Obscura says.\n\n\"The gigantic candle that sits outside the shop not only serves to stir curiosity among passersby but also acts as a preview for what visitors will find inside: thousands of lumpy candles, big and small, with quirky scents ranging from “Ma & Pa Kettle Corn” to “Hansel & Gretel.”\n\n\"Exploring the area around the shop, guests will also find seating areas, a koi pond, a coffee café, artisan crafts, and a cage filled with live, cooing peafowls. For many visitors, what may begin as a quick rest stop off of I-70 could easily turn into hours of exploring whimsical sights, sounds and of course, smells.\"\n\n\"Warm Glow has a wonderful wholesale program and has acquired many valuble partnerships throughout the years. Warm Glow attends trade shows and has a perminent show room in the AmericasMart International Gift & Home Market in Atlanta Georgia. Warm Glow also provides a fundraising program for schools, churches, community organzinations and not-for-profit groups,\" the Travel Indiana says .\n\n\"The Warm Glow store opened in 2001 and is a vast area of 22,000-square-feet, and attached to one of the largest candles in the world. Warm Glow serves as a shopping mecca and a unique tourist attraction. The store offers over 60 fragrances of candles and products, home decor, floral, chocolate, gourmet food, bath and body, jewelry, Indiana made wine and so much more.\n\n\"Warm Glow also offers the best restrooms on I-70, and nestled in the center of the store is the Stone Hearth Café.The Carberrys expanded once again in 2012 and created The Watering Can, the sister store to the Warm Glow store. The Watering can offers a unique array of garden theme home decor and garden accessories. The outside pavilion offers outdoor decor, statuary and lawn and garden accessories. They have a large selection of fairy gardens, accessories, and offer fairy garden workshops.\"\n\nReviews from TripAdvisor\n\n\"This place looks like a huge candle from the outside!!! All the candles in there are wonderfully scented and had many viraties to choose from. They are also seasonal scents that you can catch on clearance if you are lucky,. There is also a cafe there that serves some really good food there as well. Nice stop to take a break and smell some candles.\"\n\n\"A roadside stop on a long vacation trip turned out too be a pleasant surprise experience. Strolling in thru Bigfoot metal works to section after section of seasonal yard art, then a craft building with many unique items. A series of buildings connected you to visual experiences in what turned out to be a massive mall of a store. After about 20 minutes we made it to the main candle store and I could barely make out the other end of the building there was so much merchandise on display.\"\n\n\"Love this place!! Great place for buying gifts for any occasion!\"\n\n\"This store was very fun to stop at and sells much more than just candles. They have a lot of different home goods and decor as well. Their candles are super unique and smell amazing. As soon as you open the door you can smell the fresh candles. Definitely recommend stopping here if you pass by them on the highway like we did!\"\n\n\"Love this place. Get a candle or two. The garden shop is also nice and the shop next door with handmade local items.\"\n\n\"I'm a regular for trips on I-70 and have become a regular here once I was amazed by both the store and outlet offerings that go well beyond the best scented and quality candles I've come across! The local beer, wine, snacks, and crafty knickknacks are all worth the trip and I consider this an Indiana visit must do.\"\n\nWorld’s Largest Candle Sculpture: Centerville, Indiana\n\nAddress: 2131 N.
