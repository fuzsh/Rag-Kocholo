        "text": "Animal Care Alliance is hoping to relocate to a property located at 2264 South Centerville Road. Its 8 plus acres and existing pole barns would allow us the room we need to provide veterinary care for pets of Centerville residents and local communities. We have requested a zoning variance from the Centerville Board of Zoning Appeals and are being met with resistance from some local residents.\n\nFact\n\n*Animal Care Alliance is very Centerville friendly and two of its five veterinarians have Centerville addresses.\n\n*One ACA vet recently donated $500 toward the purchase of the new playground equipment in the Centerville park.\n\n*In the last six months, ACA vets have spayed/neutered 31 alley cats in Centerville FREE OF CHARGE to prevent increases in stray cat populations.\n\n*Since January of 2014, over 600 pets belonging to Centerville residents have received rabies and distemper vaccinations, thus creating a healthier pet population in the Centerville area.\n\nFiction\n\n(Concerns voiced at the zoning meeting held in Centerville on Nov. 2nd .)\n\n*ACA rehabilitates wildlife and are planning to have lions and tigers on the Centerville property.\n\n(The truth is that ACA is permitted by the Indiana DNR to rehabilitate orphaned and injured squirrels, raccoons, rabbits, and small mammals. The release site for these animals is in northern Wayne County. More than 20 Centerville residents brought wildlife creatures to ACA in 2015 asking that we accept the animals and care for them.)\n\n*Traffic on S. Centerville Rd. will increase dramatically.\n\n(The truth is that, based upon current ACA business, we estimate that approximately 10-12 additional vehicles per hour will travel on S. Centerville Rd.)\n\n*Property values of surrounding home owners will decrease if ACA occupies the property described above. (The veterinary clinic, Animal Hospital of Centerville, 1100 E. Main, was formerly known as Family Pet Health Center. Construction began on the upscale subdivision of Winding Brook, which lies next door to and behind the veterinary clinic, when a thriving practice existed there. Property values have not suffered.)\n\n*A commercial grade septic system will have to be installed on the Centerville Rd. site which may not be sufficient to handle the vast amounts of animal waste. (The truth is that animal waste is not thrown into the toilet! Do you scoop your litter boxes and clean feces from your yard and throw it in your toilet? NO. You put in the trash and it is hauled away!)"
