It is the job of the Treasurer to collect all property tax dollars from the property owners in the county. These dollars are monitored and invested by the Treasurer in addition to working closely with the County Auditor to distribute these funds to each of the entities which depends on these funds to operate. The funds collected by the Treasurer fund not only County Government but also local cities and towns (such as Richmond and Hagerstown), local townships (such as New Garden Twp. Or Abington Twp.), and School Systems which are the largest recipients of the property tax dollars next to the County Government.\n\nThese dollars fund the maintenance of roads, buildings, social services, law enforcement, the county courts, parks and recreation, and kindergarten through twelfth grade education and services.\n\nThe Wayne County Treasurer's Office has a staff of five including the elected official. The office processes close to 40,000 parcels (pieces of property) worth of tax collection. In addition the collection of InnKeeper's Taxes.\n\nThe County Treasurer is also charged with the maintenance of property tax records open to the public for review.\n\nIn addition to collection of funds and the maintenance of the records of those collections, the Treasurer invests the money collected. These funds can be invested in local banks in Certificates of Deposit, Money Market Accounts etc. The investment is necessary due to the fact that the funds are technically collected twice each year and therefore need to be making money while they are held in accounts before being used to run the government. Investment of funds allows the county to keep the tax rate down and taxes lower for the taxpayer. In a time of good investment rates a government entity can keep from raising taxes if the income from investment is good."
