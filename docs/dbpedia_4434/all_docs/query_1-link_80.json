        "text": "CENTERVILLE, Ind. — Historic. Inspiring. Memorable.\n\nIf you were to describe Centerville baseball’s season in one word, you could use any of these, and you’d be correct. Hundreds of others would work as well. In fact, just about any positive adjective would probably do the trick.\n\nIn the same way, there were countless moments worth reliving, which made it difficult to narrow them down to just 10. Here are the top 10 moments from the 2022 Centerville baseball season:\n\n10. Senior (almost) surprise\n\nBryce Robertson tore his labrum during football season and couldn’t throw a ball, meaning he wasn’t going to be able to play catcher during baseball season. Instead, the senior was the Bulldogs’ designated hitter all year.\n\nRobertson’s parents had an idea to surprise their son for senior night May 9, and head coach Tracey Crull loved it. The plan was to start him at catcher and have him catch the first inning of the game. Crull had Robertson warm up the starting pitcher to get him in full catcher’s gear, but Robertson was not happy about doing this on senior night. That’s when Crull came clean and told him about the plan. Robertson freaked out because he didn’t have his equipment. They worked it out, and Robertson walked away from his senior night with a special memory and a win.\n\nMore: Bryce Robertson can't throw, but he can hit, and Collin Clark has been great at catcher\n\n9. Down goes No. 1\n\nThe Bulldogs went into their April 20 game at No. 1 Wapahani having just lost both games of a doubleheader at Jay County. Those were their first two losses of the season, and they were hungry to get back in the win column, especially against the top-ranked team in Indiana Class 2A.\n\nSenior Keegen Schlotterbeck and sophomore Kollyn Peed both homered, Schlotterbeck pitched 5.2 innings without allowing an earned run and the Bulldogs took a 9-6 victory.\n\n8. Wandersee no-hits Winchester\n\nJunior Jacob Crowe and senior Logan Drook had just combined to shut out Winchester in the first game of a doubleheader April 30. Junior Alex Wandersee took the mound in game two.\n\nWandersee went on to strike out nine batters without allowing a run or a hit over five innings. The only blemishes on his line were a pair of walks. The Bulldogs’ offense kept Wandersee from needing to pitch the last two innings, scoring 10 runs to earn the win by run rule. Wandersee was a part of that as well with one hit and two RBIs at the plate.\n\nMore: It’s easy to have fun when you win, and Centerville baseball has done a lot of both\n\n7. Pamplin x 3\n\nAfter April 23, it was safe to say the Bulldogs found their cleanup hitter. In the second game of a doubleheader, a 14-0 win at Cowan, senior Jamari Pamplin blasted three home runs over the fence.\n\nThey were Pamplin’s first homers of the season. Before that game, the Bulldogs had only two home runs as a team, and Pamplin surpassed that mark himself in the matter of a couple hours. Pamplin ended the season as the team leader in home runs (six), batting average (.425), RBIs (29), hits (34), doubles (nine) and triples (three).\n\n6. These boys are legit\n\nThe Bulldogs entered the season ranked in the Indiana Class 2A top 10, and they stayed there throughout the entirety of the year. On April 4, they were ranked fifth, and they were hosting No. 3 Monroe Central for their season-opening game.\n\nCrowe pitched the first four innings, holding the Golden Bears to two runs, and two runs were all they would get. Drook took it from there, striking out five batters in the last three innings. The offense manufactured five runs to give the Bulldogs a 5-2 win, showing they belong in the conversation for best team in the state.\n\n‘It’s a big deal’: No. 5 Centerville baseball takes down No. 3 Monroe Central\n\n5. Third time’s the charm\n\nCenterville beat Hagerstown three times in 2021 but was in jeopardy of doing a complete 180 in 2022. The Tigers beat the Bulldogs twice earlier in the season, and the two teams met again in the sectional championship May 30.\n\nThe Bulldogs jumped out to a 5-0 lead in the first inning and went on to win 14-8 to earn their second consecutive sectional title. Drook sprained his right wrist and ankle sliding into home plate in the first inning, but he toughed it out to pitch four scoreless innings before giving up a few in the fifth.\n\n‘We came to win’: Hagerstown baseball stays true to itself to win Wayne County Tournament\n\n‘The job is not finished’: Centerville baseball wins second straight sectional title\n\n4. The team meeting that changed everything\n\nThe Bulldogs had just won 11 games in a row. On May 10, they lost 2-1 to Hagerstown. Two days later, they lost 10-0 to Lapel. Two days after that, they lost 3-2 to Hagerstown again.\n\nDuring that week, the Bulldogs held a team meeting about accountability. They knew something needed to change, and they wanted to be pushed harder. That’s when everyone’s mindset shifted, and they didn’t lose again until the state championship.\n\nMore: A day as a member of state-bound Centerville baseball: Same fun, goofy group you've seen all year\n\n3. Bulldogs make history at regionals\n\nCenterville made program history June 4, becoming the first Bulldog team to ever win a regional game. The Pamplin twins, Jamari and Javontae, both hit home runs — the first time they’d ever homered in the same game — to power the Bulldogs to a 6-3 win over Cascade. Drook twirled five scoreless innings on the mound, still toughing out his injuries from the week prior.\n\nMore: Logan Drook and the Pamplin twins lead Centerville baseball where it’s never been before\n\nLater that day, the Bulldogs made more history with an 8-2 win over Heritage Christian in the regional championship. Crowe pitched a complete game, Peed was a ball magnet on defense and the offense played small ball to perfection to earn the victory.\n\n‘We ain’t done yet’: Centerville baseball wins regional title, advances to semi-state\n\n2. Pamplin punches ticket to state\n\nSchlotterbeck got hit by a pitch with the bases loaded in the Bulldogs’ semi-state game against Linton-Stockton June 11. That brought Jamari Pamplin to the plate with one out in a tie game with a spot in the state championship on the line.\n\nEveryone at the ballpark wearing Centerville blue knew what was about to happen. Pamplin hit a ball over the right fielder’s head to bring home the game-winning run in walk-off fashion. Crull fell to his knees as the ball hit the ground, and the team dogpiled on top of Pamplin between second and third base. The 6-5 win marked the first time any athletic team from Centerville had ever made it to a state championship game.\n\n‘We ain’t finished’: Centerville baseball is heading to the IHSAA 2A state championship\n\n1. Hoist it high, you made it\n\nThe Bulldogs fell 10-1 to Illiana Christian in the state championship June 17. While they weren’t able to complete the mission they set out to accomplish before the season started, they did make it to the last game, which was quite the achievement in itself. With a big smile on his face, Pamplin held the state runner-up trophy high above his head to the sea of Centerville blue at Victory Field.\n\nAfter the game, Schlotterbeck was awarded the L.V. Phillips Mental Attitude Award, which was as close to winning the state championship they could possibly get without doing it. The impact the Bulldogs made on their community and area teams back home was more than they could imagine in the moment. They go down as the greatest team in Centerville history.\n\n‘It’s a brotherhood’: Centerville baseball reflects after coming up short in state championship"
