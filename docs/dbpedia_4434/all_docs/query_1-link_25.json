        "text": "Former resident writes\n\nI just found your website while out \"surfing the net.\" You can take a guy out of Centerville, but you can't take Centerville out of a guy!!\n\nCongratulations to Inezetta Eliason Stiver on her 90th birthday. It's great to know that some folks I knew are still with us. With no family left in Centerville I occasionally feel out of touch.\n\nThanks for your website and your Centerville news. It is greatly appreciated!!\n\nGreg Armstrong, CHS 1961\n\nand a descendant of area families who settle the Doddridge Chapel community in April 1814\n\n4/6/06\n\nCenterville-Abington Senior Center\n\nby Jay Klehfoth\n\nFive years ago when my wife and I moved to Centerville, we were urged to visit the Centerville-Abington Senior Center. Us? We were too young to belong to a \"senior center!\"\n\nWhen Promote Centerville kicked off three years ago and needed a place to meet, the Centerville-Abington Senior Center was suggested. Our group began meeting monthly at the Center and so our relationship began. Doris Sprouse, a wonderful sprite of a woman, met us at the Center to open the building for our meetings and we soon developed a relationship with her and the Center and eventually joined, paying the $5 dues.\n\nThe Centerville-Abington Senior Center is a real asset to the community. Beginning its 10th year in September, the first meal at the Center was served in September, 1996 and home delivery began a few days later. Area 9 sponsors the meals at the Center Monday-Friday at 11:30 a.m. for a donation of $1.50. Twelve to fifteen meals are delivered to homes weekly for the same donation. Meals are planned a month in advance and are posted at the Center and in the Center's monthly newsletter.\n\nActivities at the Center include art classes, library outreach, Fun and Fitness, cards, pool, scrap-booking, bingo and the new Hobo Band. (Did you cath the Hobo Band float in the Archway Days Parade -- their first public debut!\n\nThe dues of only $5/year include the monthly newsletter with infomation on \"goings on\" at the Center, local news of interest and news of friends and fellow members.\n\nTo sustain the Center, several fund-raising projects are held each year. The main room of the Center is available for parties providing a current Center member is sponsoring the group. A small donation is required. Groups that meet regularly include Kiwanis, Lions Club, MS Support group and Promote Centerville. To reserve the Center for a meeting or an event, contact Pat Tremps, kitchen supervisor and activities director, at 855-5651.\n\nWhile regular memberships are for those aged 55 and older, if you are younger than that (or don't want to admit your age) you can get an associate memberhship for the same amount. And September is their annual membership drive -- so join now. You won't be sorry.\n\nCenterville-Abington Senior Center\n\nHours: 8 a.m. - 1 p.m.\n\n111 South 2nd Street\n\nCenterville, IN 47330\n\n765-855-5651\n\nLetter of Thanks from PCI\n\nPromote Centerville would like to thank the following persons who devoted their time, energy and expertise on Sunday, May 20, 2007 to retrieve from storage, place and plant flowers in 40 big, heavy flowerpots on historic US 40 in downtown Centerville. It was a big job done well by a great group of people. If you see one of these people, please tell them thank-you for making our town look beautiful! White River Architectural Salvage & Antiques donated the pots to Promote Centerville in 2006. If you would be interested in sponsoring a flowerpot ($25), please contact Promote Centerville.\n\nCharlie Bane\n\nMyra Baldwin\n\nAshley and Krista Bumbalough\n\nBecky and Ron Cole\n\nJoe Elstro\n\nPaul and Marie Elstro\n\nConnie Gareiss\n\nRachel Grinstead\n\nRuth Hickman\n\nRoger & Kate Johnson-Keep\n\nBarbara Klehfoth\n\nBill and Mary Senters\n\nSteve Slonaker\n\n5/25/07\n\nFamily becomes life member of Historic Centerville\n\ncomment: We're sending a check for $550 to become LIFE members of Historic Centerville Inc. My father was Howard Bertsch formerly of Cambridge City, IN. My paternal Aunt was Evelyn (Bertsch) Railsback formerly of Centerville, IN. Second to my hometown of Phoenix AZ, Centerville is number one in my book! My cousins, Shirley (Railsback) Cheek, Paul Railsback, Marvin R Railsback, and Beverly Railsback (of Trenton NJ) all live right there. We proudly submit our application for LIFE membership. Would more towns across our US be more like historic Centerville IN!\n\nRespectfully, Sid & Katrina (Bertsch) Lilly Phoenix, AZ\n\n4/8/06\n\nMystery of envelopes solved\n\nYour letter arrived today and I really appreciate receiving it. I did not know how she had gotten these envelopes since she never lived in Indiana. However since I received your letter I now know the connection. My Aunt Irma Greeley was I believe the Director of the YWCA in Richmond IN back in the late 60's, early 70's. I know she was there in 1971 when we were on a trip across country and I talked to her. She has since died several years ago. My Mom died last year at 98. She was a stamp collector and her mother collected pictures of covered bridges.\n\nMy other half's brother lives in New ALbany. Dick graduated from Purdue.\n\nOur best friends are coming from Arlington, TX next Thurs for a visit.\n\nWe may get toCenterville sometime, looks like a very interesting town. We are in process of selling our house and moving to NC. Tired of the cold weather and CT is a very expensive state to live in.\n\nThanks again.\n\nEva\n\n4/7/06"
