So what does \"Midwestern\" mean exactly? While personal meanings vary, Midwestern refers to the middle region of the United States. But the term Midwestern is often associated with friendly neighbors and a way of living that's a little bit slower and a lot more fun. From big cities to small towns, Indiana bleeds Midwestern values, and it's all showcased in this amazing Midwestern town. Let's take a look at some of the fun things to do in Bloomington, Indiana.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBloomington, Indiana is a city in the southern part of Indiana known as \"The Gateway to Scenic Southern Indiana.\" You'll find some of the best traits of Indiana within this town's borders.\n\nOne of the main attractions of Bloomington is the main campus of Indiana University. IU is one of Indiana's top universities, bringing Hoosiers together through sports, arts, and academia.\n\nBloomington also has its fair share of popular bar dives with awesome food, like BuffaLouie's on Indiana Ave.\n\nYou'll also find the popular Oliver Winery in this Midwestern haven. Sample some of the best wines, meads, and ciders in the Hoosier state.\n\nOf course, this city contains plenty of rural land to explore, and Bloomington actually houses some of the Hoosier National Forest, one of the most beautiful forests in the state.\n\nDowntown Bloomington is large enough to keep your interest, but small enough to walk around. You'll find incredible shops ranging from local, charming stores to funky, eclectic shops and restaurants worth investigating.\n\nBloomington is definitely one of the most Midwestern cities and offers visitors an incredible glimpse of life in the Hoosier state.\n\nHave you ever visited the wonderful town of Bloomington, Indiana? Is there another town in Indiana with this much Midwestern spirit? Share your favorite places in Indiana with us in the comments.
