FOR the first time, a ''test-tube'' baby, conceived in a laboratory dish, has been born in an American hospital. Elizabeth Jordan Carr, weighing 5 pounds 12 ounces and described as ''perfectly healthy,'' was delivered yesterday morning at Norfolk General Hospital in Norfolk, Va.

The birth, which came two weeks ahead of schedule, brings to at least 15 the number of babies born in this manner. The rest were in Britain and Australia, although one was born to American parents in England. About 100 women have become pregnant through the same procedure, five of them in the United States.

At least five American clinics are treating infertile women in this way, but so far with meager success. Nevertheless, reliability seems to be improving rapidly. The time when it becomes standard treatment for several causes of infertility may be drawing near.

The Dec. 5 issue of the British medical journal Lancet suggests editorially that the procedure may become simple and reliable enough to be handled as a ''day-care and outpatient service.''

The parents of the newborn baby are Judith Carr, a 28-year-old schoolteacher, and her husband, Roger Carr, 30, of Westminster, Mass. The technique, known medically as in vitro (''in glass'') fertilization and called colloquially, ''test tube'' conception, was conducted at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk by Dr. Howard Jones and his colleagues, who were the first to try it in the United States.

An egg cell removed from Mrs. Carr was fertilized in a laboratory dish with sperm from her husband. The resulting embryo was then inserted into her womb for normal gestation and birth.
