On July 25, 1978 in Manchester, England, Dr. Robert Edwards and his medical team wheeled a 30-year old pregnant woman into an operating room.

"This is Mrs. Brown who is now 38 weeks pregnant...."

Lesley Brown had been Dr. Edwards' patient for a little over a year.

"All our tests have shown that the growth of the baby is satisfactory..."

Dr. Edwards performed a quick, confident Cesarean section on Lesley Brown. And in the grainy video taken in the operating room, you see Dr. Edwards reaching gently into Lesley Brown's womb, as he says...

"This was a girl, as was expected... baby's in pretty good condition after birth."

Robert Edwards died this week at the age of 87.

Today, America's first test-tube baby joins us for a look back at the earliest days of in-vitro fertilization here in Massachusetts.
