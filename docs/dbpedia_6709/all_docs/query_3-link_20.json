Test tube baby or IVF can help you fulfil your dream of becoming parents\n\nTo them we want to say you are not alone, around 60-80 million couples face infertility every year worldwide, and about 15-20 million (25%) are in India.\n\nReasons can range from poor food choices and lifestyle choices to genetics and many more. If you find yourself in this position, then there’s no need to be hopeless. Many couples have been where you are, and majority have ended up conceiving and giving birth to healthy babies – thanks to medical breakthroughs like Test tube baby treatment or IVF – in vitro fertilization.\n\nOwing to its high success rate, Test Tube Baby (or IVF) is one of the most recommended treatments for couples with infertility problems. In fact, a significant number of babies born in India every year come through IVF. This has made parenthood possible for many childless couples and has brought hope and faith for many struggling out there.\n\nUnfortunately, the term “test tube baby” is often misunderstood due to a lack of knowledge. Some believe that the process is unnatural and may involve a different kind of ART procedure different from the conventional IVF treatment.\n\nWe hope to resolve the confusion and answer all the questions you may have concerning Test Tube Baby.\n\nLet’s start with the most important item…\n\nWhat is Test Tube Baby?\n\nThe first use of the term “test tube baby” was in 1978. And this was after the birth of the first test tube baby, Louise Joy Brown. Today, over 7 million healthy babies have been conceived and born via the test tube baby treatment process. As the name suggests, a test tube baby means the child is conceived outside the woman’s body.\n\nTo be more specific, the eggs and sperm are collected and fertilized in a laboratory. This process is formally known as IVF.\n\nSurprisingly, in the early days when the test tube baby was rare, the lab instrument used was a test tube instead of a Petri dish, so that the name might have actually been misleading. However, today, the Petri dish is used for the process instead of the test tube. There is no difference between Test tube baby treatment and IVF.\n\nIVF is generally known as Test tube baby.\n\nIt is worth noting that test tube baby treatment can also be done with donor sperm and eggs if the couple has problem with self egg or sperm.\n\nTest Tube Baby Cost in India\n\nAlthough Test tube baby treatment is generally considered expensive, the average cost in India is significantly lower compared to other countries like the US, UK and Canada. Interestingly, India still records a high success rate despite the lower cost – thanks to cutting-edge technology and highly skilled doctors. This makes India a preferred destination for fertility treatments.\n\nThat said, the expected cost of test tube baby will depend on factors such as the amount of medication, the technology employed, the experience of the fertility specialist, as well as the location.\n\nIt’s worth noting that test tube baby is not a one step treatment. Each cycle involves several treatments and procedures which may be different for individual cases.\n\nIn most cases, the couple will conceive after the first Test tube baby cycle. In this case, the test tube baby treatment cost may range from Rs. 75,000 – 2, 50,000 depending on the individual and the fertility drugs administered. At Aveya – Test tube baby / IVF cost starts from 50,000 Rs. and goes upto 2.5 Lacs depending on medical and other factors.

In this case, the cost of treatment will be significantly higher. At Aveya – we provide a multiple cycle test tube baby treatment package at Rs. 2.5 Lacs around.\n\nBelow is a table that shows the average cost of test tube baby in the 10 top cities in India.\n\nTest Tube Baby Process\n\nToday, many clinics often adopt different techniques, but the core process for test tube baby treatment is the same. We discuss these steps below:\n\nStep 1: Ovulation Stimulation / Super Ovulation\n\nFrom the second day of menses Gonadotropins or injections with the follicle-stimulating hormone are given. This results in the growth of the follicles and the production of multiple eggs in the ovaries. Another injection Antagonist is added to prevent spontaneous rupture of the eggs\n\nA fertility specialist may do a scan and other tests required to monitor the process. To achieve the final maturity of the eggs, the woman is injected with HCG36.\n\nStep 2: Egg Retrieval\n\nThe matured eggs are then retrieved through a minor procedure called “follicular aspiration” from both ovaries. During the egg retrieval process for test tube baby, the woman is given some sedative to prevent pain or discomfort. The number of egg varies. Generally anything from 10-12 is considered good.\n\nThe couple may also decide to use Frozen or donor eggs.\n\nStep 3: Semen Collection\n\nLikewise, a semen sample is required, and the male partner will be asked to provide a sperm sample for further processes. Afterward, the sperm is “washed” to concentrate it. This needs to be done on the same day of Egg retrieval for test tube baby treatment process. If the husband is not able to provide the semen sample, same can be take from TESTH.\n\nStep 4:Fertilization\n\nNext, the retrieved eggs are mixed with the sperm in a Petri dish, and then stored in a growth medium for at least 48 hours. An embryo is formed during this time.\n\nIn a situation where the sperm is less motile (low motility), a special technique known as ICSI is used to directly injects it into the egg.\n\nThe couple may also decide to use sperm collected through a testicular biopsy process if required and suggested by the doctor.\n\nWho needs to opt for the Test tube baby process :\n\nSome medical conditions that might require this procedure include:\n\nWOMEN\n\nFailing to conceive after 1 yr or more of trying\n\nOlder age\n\nDamaged fallopian tubes\n\nEndometriosis (usually in chronic cases)\n\nA problem with the womb (uterine cavity/ovaries) such as uterine fibroid\n\nOvulation disorders (Irregular ovulation or no ovulation)\n\nUnexplained infertility\n\nHormonal Imbalance\n\nIrregular Cycle\n\nChange in cycle duration\n\nOther health issues like PCOD / PCOS\n\nMEN\n\nLow sperm motility or low sperm\n\nNil sperm count\n\nInability to have intercourse\n\nErectile dysfunction\n\nVaricocele\n\nChromosome defects\n\nInfection such as gonorrhea, epididymitis, and orchitis\n\nUnexplained infertility\n\nRetrograde ejaculation\n\nTumors\n\nRisk factors such as substance abuse and tobacco smoking\n\nPrior surgeries\n\nAnd other fertility problems\n\nIt is always suggested to consult with IVF and fertility specialists to know the exact reason and further treatment process.\n\nDifference between Test Tube Baby and IVF\n\nIf you’re like most people, you may wonder what the difference between IVF and test tube baby is. Well, both terms are somewhat related. In fact, they are the SAME THING. In other words, there’s basically no difference except for their names.\n\nTest tube baby is actually the layman term used to refer to an IVF procedure many years ago. It’s still being used today. They are the same thing.\n\nThe term was concocted as a result of the notion that an embryo is formed in a “test tube” instead of the natural process where the embryo is formed in the woman’s womb or fallopian tube. However, as earlier indicated, a Petri dish is actually used (not a test tube), hence the term “in-vitro.”\n\nMany people still think test tube babies are entirely grown in a test tube, which often comes with a social stigma. Even the birth of the first and second test tube baby in the late 90s was under heavy criticism.\n\nThankfully, the table has shifted today, and IVF is now generally accepted in India.\n\nImplantation\n\nThe grading of embryo is usually done on the basis of rate of growth, symmetry of cells & fragmentation. After fertilization, the formed embryos are examined by an experienced embryologist. The best ones are identified and placed back in the woman’s uterus using a catheter. 1 or 2 embryos are usually transferred.\n\nBefore implantation, the woman may be given HCG or progesterone supplements to help strengthen her uterine lining and increase the likelihood of implantation.\n\nChecking for Pregnancy\n\nTwo weeks after implantation has occurred, a pregnancy test is done to know whether the test tube baby treatment was successful or not. If successful, the woman goes through the normal phase of pregnancy. In this case, the remaining embryos can be frozen and kept for future use or donated to other couples with fertility problems.\n\nOn the other hand, if the pregnancy test comes out negative, then test tube baby was unsuccessful. In this case, the couple may need to go through another cycle. Success Rate of Test tube baby generally ranges from 40-70%\n\nFirst Test Tube Baby in India\n\nThe first test tube baby in India, “Durga” as she’s popularly known was delivered by doctor Subhash Mukhopadhyay, on October 3rd, 1978. This was also the second successful IVF treatment in the world following the birth of Louise Joy Brown in the same year.\n\nSince 1978, over 4 million test tube babies have been delivered.\n\nUnfortunately, the birth of Durga, also known by the name, Kanupriya Agarwal, came with a lot of controversy. As a result, Doctor Subhash didn’t receive recognition at first, and was denounced by the government for creating history.\n\nJust eight years after the birth of Durga, the second test tube baby, Harsha, was delivered by Indira Hinduja, a gynecologist at a state hospital in Mumbai, in 1986.\n\nLike Durga, Harsha’s birth came with a lot of public criticism and controversy, as well as social stigma for an unnatural process that initiates life in a “test tube”.\n\nToday, IVF or test tube baby is generally accepted in India, with over 400 clinics offering treatment to both couples in the country and others from the world.\n\nCurrently, around 10 percent of couples in the country is estimated to have fertility issues. Test tube baby has consequently become the mainstream treatment available for such couples owing to its high success rate."
