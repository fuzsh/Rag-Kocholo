        "text": "Canada's first test tube baby welcomed his own little bundle of joy in a London hospital on Tuesday.\n\nIt was much like the everyday miracle of birth when baby Clark Wilson Rankin was born around 6 a.m.\n\nStill beaming, his father Colin Rankin says \"This guy cmoing out, I mean it was the best moment of my life.\"\n\nHealthy and strong, Clark came into the world at seven pounds, 12 ounces, just a week before he was due.\n\nBut when his father was born - along with his twin brother Gregory - 32 years ago, it was a birth that made international news.\n\nIt was March 1982 when the pair became Canada's first test tube babies.\n\nTheir births were watched with great interest, with several follow up stories as the boys grew up - among the first test tube babies in the world.\n\nAt the time, the twins' mother Catherine Rankin said \"By the time they're old enough to know what the difference is and understand it, they won't be different. I hope there will be many, many babies born to people who couldn't have children by the method we used.\"\n\nSince then, thousands of babies have been born through in vitro fertilization, but Clark isn't one of them.\n\nHis mother Sarah Rankin says \"Fortunately, we were really lucky, in that we didn't have any issues. Very fortunate.\"\n\nOf course, just because Clark was conceived in a more traditional way, doesn't mean chemistry wasn't involved.\n\nColin says \"Sarah and I went on a date, and just right then I knew I wasn't going to be in Winnipeg for much longer.\"\n\nAnd he wasn't, Colin moved to London, Ont. and the couple quickly married. Clark has arrived just a few years later, but the Rankins hope he won't be the last.\n\n\"Three or four, two or three...definitely more than one - give Clark a brother or sister,\" Sarah says.\n\nIt's a happy family moment that truly began in a petri dish more than 32 years ago.\n\nSarah and Clark are both doing very well. There were no complications with the delivery and mom and baby should be heading home very soon."
