        "text": "The babies born through an IVF treatment are often called “test-tube babies.” This treatment is used to assist infertile couples in conceiving. So, the term “test-tube baby” simplifies a child born through IVF. Therefore, there is no differentiation between an IVF baby and a test-tube baby.\n\nThere are several IVF Centres in Mumbai which offer test tube baby services. But when it is about the best test tube baby treatment in Mumbai that you are looking for, Saraogi Hospital is assuredly one of the top test tube baby centre in Mumbai.\n\nTest tube baby or IVF treatment in Mumbai at Saraogi Hospital has years of experience and has delivered thousands of babies.\n\nThe term “test-tube baby” is a non-medical term for IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) that was popular decades ago. The term “test-tube baby” came about due to the widespread belief that an embryo is created in a test tube instead of a woman’s fallopian tube.\n\nThe egg and sperm are fertilized in a petri dish. Hence the term in-vitro refers to the process of fertilization within a glass culture dish instead of in-vivo, which relates to fertilization within a living body.\n\nTherefore, there is no difference between an IVF and a test tube baby treatment. It is important to understand that whether the baby is referred to as a test tube baby or an IVF baby, he or she is human and as natural as any other baby in every way."
