        "text": "Difference Between IVF and Test Tube Baby: A Complete Guide\n\nIVF treatment and test tube baby are the most commonly referred medical terms when a couple is unable to conceive. Since both the terms are distinct, it is obvious to assume their meanings would be different too, often confusing people who are planning to seek suitable fertility treatment options. However, both these terms mean the same thing as IVF treatment and test tube babies are not different.\n\nBanker IVF Women’s Hospital is the best IVF centre in Ahmedabad and this blog discusses the difference between IVF treatment and test tube baby!\n\nTable of Content\n\n1.0 What is the difference between IVF and test tube baby?\n\n2.0 What is IVF Treatment?\n\n3.0 Who Requires Test Tube or IVF Treatment?\n\n4.0 What is the IVF Treatment Process?\n\n5.0 Benefits of IVF Treatment\n\n6.0 Alternatives of IVF Treatment\n\n7.0 A Perfect Parenthood Dream with Banker IVF Treatment in India\n\nWhat is the difference between IVF and test tube baby?\n\nThe terms IVF treatment and test tube baby are interchangeably used in the medical world. In reality, there is no difference between the two. Test tube baby is a non-medical term used to describe a baby conceived through IVF treatment. This term is used because the fertilization of the egg and sperm takes place in a laboratory dish, outside of the woman’s body.\n\nSo, in essence, IVF treatment is the process of creating a test tube baby. Because the terms are so closely related, they are frequently used interchangeably. However, it is important to note that the term test-tube baby is not medically accurate, as the fertilization process does not actually take place in a test tube.\n\nWhat is IVF Treatment?\n\nIVF treatment also known as in vitro fertilization is a process of assisted reproduction aimed at helping couples conceive. The IVF treatment involves the extraction of eggs from a woman’s ovaries and the fertilization of these eggs with sperm in a laboratory setting.\n\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF) is a complex and expensive medical procedure but there have been prominent IVF success rates in recent years. The IVF treatment can also involve the use of donor eggs or sperm if necessary. It is a well-established and effective assisted reproductive technology, offering hope to those struggling with infertility, genetic disorders, or other reproductive challenges.\n\nEspecially if it is performed by an IVF specialist such as Dr Manish Banker at their IVF clinic in Ahmedabad.\n\nHere are some promising numbers regarding IVF success:\n\nIn 2021, there were 91,906 live births in the United States from IVF. (Source: CDC)\n\nThe use of IVF treatment is particularly high among women in their late 30s and early 40s. (Source: HFEA)\n\nA 2014 study published in the journal JAMA Paediatrics found that IVF children were no more likely to have autism than naturally conceived children. (Source: Jamanetwork)\n\nIndia has one of the highest numbers of IVF clinics, with around 2500 functional IVF centers. (Source: TOI)\n\nOn average around 2-2.5 lakh IVF cycles are performed in India which is expected to rise to 5-6 lakh cycles annually. (Source: CNBCTV)\n\nWho Requires Test Tube or IVF Treatment?\n\nTrouble with Fallopian Tubes\n\nIf your fallopian tube is damaged or blocked, then it will be difficult for the egg to travel to the uterus and begin fertilization.\n\nEndometriosis\n\nA woman suffering from endometriosis will develop tissues outside of the uterus on ovaries, tubes and even on the bladder or intestines. This makes it difficult for the patient to get pregnant.\n\nUterine Fibroids\n\nUterine fibroids are a type of tumour found in women during their fertility years. They can cause interference with implantation and fertilization.\n\nOvulation Disorders\n\nOvulation disorders result in poor quality and quantity of eggs. This can be a reason behind infertility.\n\nPoor Sperm Production\n\nAbnormality with sperm such as unusual sperm count, poor sperm motility, size and shape can be a reason for infertility.\n\nUnexplained Infertility\n\nWhen no solid underlying issue of infertility is found then it is considered unexplained fertility. For this, you will have to seek IVF treatment.\n\nPrior Tubal Sterilization or Removal\n\nTubal ligation is a type of sterilization that includes permanently preventing conception by cutting or closing the fallopian tubes.\n\nGenetic Disorder\n\nCertain disorders are at risk of genetically being passed onto the offspring if one or both of the partners are suffering from it. To prevent this IVF is an option.\n\nMust Read Who needs IVF treatment?\n\nWhat is the IVF Treatment Process?\n\nConsult with an IVF Specialist:\n\nDuring the IVF treatment process, it is crucial to seek guidance from an IVF specialist to ensure the best possible outcomes. In Ahmedabad, Dr. Manish Banker is a renowned IVF specialist who can provide expert consultation and support throughout the procedure.\n\nBaseline bloodwork and ultrasound:\n\nBefore initiating the IVF treatment, the woman undergoes baseline bloodwork and ultrasound examinations. These tests help the IVF specialist assess the woman’s reproductive health, hormone levels, and the condition of her ovaries.\n\nOvarian stimulation:\n\nThe woman’s ovaries are stimulated with hormones to produce multiple eggs. This is done by injecting the woman with fertility drugs during the IVF treatment.\n\nEgg retrieval:\n\nOnce the eggs are mature, they are retrieved from the woman’s ovaries using a thin needle inserted through the vagina.\n\nSperm collection:\n\nA semen sample is collected from the male partner. The IVF treatment involves the assistance of both partners.\n\nFertilization:\n\nIn a laboratory dish, eggs and sperm are mixed together. The sperm will fertilise the eggs, resulting in the formation of embryos.\n\nEmbryo culture:\n\nThe embryos are kept in a controlled environment for a few days to allow them to develop.\n\nEmbryo transfer:\n\nThe selected embryos are transferred into the woman’s uterus. The procedure is usually performed without anaesthesia and involves passing a thin catheter through the cervix and into the uterus. The embryos are carefully placed into the uterine cavity.\n\nLuteal Phase Support:\n\nFollowing the embryo transfer, the woman may be given hormonal medications to support the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. These medications help create a favorable environment for implantation.\n\nPregnancy test:\n\nTwo weeks after the embryo transfer, the woman takes a pregnancy test to see if the procedure was successful. During this period the guidance of the IVF specialist in Ahmedabad is required.\n\nMust Read IVF treatment procedure – Know step-by-step process of IVF\n\nBenefits of IVF Treatment\n\nIVF treatment is undoubtedly a complex procedure, however with the expertise of an IVF specialist in Ahmedabad such as Dr Manish Banker, the IVF success rate increases. Let’s take a look at some of the benefits IVF treatment has to offer:\n\nIVF treatment can help people who would otherwise be unable to have children. This includes people with blocked or damaged fallopian tubes, endometriosis, unexplained infertility, male infertility, same-sex couples, and single women.\n\nIVF treatment can offer a chance to screen for genetic disorders. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) can be used to test embryos for genetic disorders before they are transferred to the uterus. This can help to reduce the risk of having a child with a genetic disorder.\n\nIt allows people to have children with their own genetic material. This is important for people who want to have children with their own biological children.\n\nIVF treatment can give people control over their fertility. People can choose when to have children and how many children to have. This means becoming a parent even in your late 40s and 50s is possible with the help of IVF treatment.\n\nMust Read A Complete Guide to IVF By an IVF Specialist – Dr Manish Banker\n\nAlternatives of IVF Treatment\n\nIntrauterine insemination (IUI):\n\nThis procedure involves placing the sperm directly into the uterus, bypassing the cervix and increasing the chances of fertilization. IUI is often used for couples with male factor infertility, such as low sperm count or motility.\n\nIn vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI):\n\nThis procedure is similar to IVF, but instead of placing the sperm near the egg, the sperm is injected directly into the egg. ICSI is often used for couples with severe male factor infertility.\n\nFertility preservation:\n\nThis involves freezing eggs, sperm, or embryos for future use. Fertility preservation can be an option for individuals or couples who are facing cancer treatment or other medical conditions that could affect their fertility.\n\nBanker IVF Centre in Ahmedabad not only offers IVF treatment but many more such fertility options to help couples conceive.\n\nA Perfect Parenthood Dream with Banker IVF Treatment in India"
