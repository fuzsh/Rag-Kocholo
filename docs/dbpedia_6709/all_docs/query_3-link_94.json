        "text": "“In Vitro” means “within the glass” and comes from Latin. It more broadly refers to whatever takes place in a lab environment. Therefore, the expression “in vitro fertilization” refers to fertilization that happens inside a glass tube rather than inside a human body.\n\nAfter fertilization, the resulting embryo is transferred to the uterus to continue growing. Then, the embryo further develops inside the human body, and the baby born through this process is called a test tube baby. Thus, there aren’t many differences between those two except that the technique is known as in vitro fertilization, and the child born as a consequence is known as a test tube baby.\n\nTest tube babies, or those conceived through IVF and ICSI, are generally as healthy as naturally conceived babies. There is a slightly higher risk of birth defects and pregnancy complications, such as preterm birth and low birth weight, but these risks are minimal. Long-term health outcomes for ART-conceived children are typically similar to those of naturally conceived children. Parental health, genetics, and environmental factors play significant roles in the health of all babies, regardless of conception method.\n\nThe ideal age for women to undergo test tube baby (IVF) treatment is between 20 and 35 years old. IVF success rates are highest in women under 30, with live birth rates around 40%. Success rates start steadily decreasing once a woman reaches her mid-30s. By age 40, live birth rates drop to just 6%. While IVF is sometimes used as a last resort for women over 40, the chances of success are much higher the younger the woman is. The upper age limit for IVF in Pakistan is currently 50 years for women.\n\nThe main difference between a test tube baby and a naturally conceived baby is the method of conception, with the former conceived via assisted reproductive technologies (ART) like IVF or ICSI. Both types of babies are generally healthy and develop similarly, though test tube babies may have a slightly higher risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and minor birth defects. ART also allows for pre-implantation genetic testing, potentially leading to a healthier baby."
