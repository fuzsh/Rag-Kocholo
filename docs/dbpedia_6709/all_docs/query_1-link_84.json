Her birth will bring\n\nhope to thousands of\n\nchildless women, as\n\nAustralia now leads the\n\nworld in this important\n\nresearch field. But your\n\nhelp is needed for\n\nresearch to continue\n\nIn a room charged with emotion and\n\nexcitement, Candice Elizabeth Reed,\n\nAustralia's first so-called test tube\n\nbaby, entered the world with a whimper\n\nthat quickly grew to a yell.\n\nAfter a night that at times seemed\n\nendless to her 26-year-old mother, Linda\n\nReed, Candice was born normally at 7.09\n\non a grey winter's morning, June 23, at\n\nMelbourne's Royal Women's Hospital\n\nfamily birth unit.\n\nAs Candice was drawn slowly into the\n\nhands of obstetrician Mr Ian Johnston,\n\none of the team that made her possible,\n\nhe said delightedly: \"It's just miracu-\n\nlous! We're all immensely relieved.\"\n\nJohn Reed, 30, beside his wife\n\nthroughout her labour, kissed Linda and\n\nheld her, as Candice was gently placed on\n\nher chest. Linda and John wept with joy.\n\nand even members of the nursing staff\n\nshed some silent tears.\n\nCandice was born as a result of the\n\nhospital's programme of in vitro fertiliza-\n\ntion and ovum transfer (known as\n\nPIVOT) and present at the dramatic\n\nbirth were the programme's team mem-\n\nbers, obstetrician Mr Ian Johnston, Dr\n\nAlex Lopata, Dr Andrew Speirs, and Dr\n\nIan Hoult. Pediatrician Dr Ken Moun-\n\ntain was also in the delivery room. After a\n\nbrief cuddle, Candice was handed to Dr\n\nMountain for examination.\n\n\"Has she got everything?\" Linda jj\n\nasked anxiously. Dr Mountain replied j\n\nCONTINUED ON PAGE 4 '\n\nnone Help\n\nAt the birth\n\nof a miracle\n\nFROM PAGE 2\n\njubilantly, \"She is a perfect baby.\"\n\nCandice, weighing a beautiful 3.58kg (71b\n\nL4oz), was sponged with warm water,\n\nwrapped in a blanket and returned to her\n\nparents. It was then that she met her\n\nfour-year-old brother, Daniel.\n\nDaniel, sitting on the bed. was allowed\n\nto hold her. But it was debatable whether\n\nhe was more delighted with her or the red\n\nplastic skateboard which he confidently\n\ninformed everyone she had brought with\n\nher for him.\n\nCandice was born five days before her\n\ndue date. \"She did it herself,\" Linda said\n\nhappily. It may have helped, however,\n\nthat on the afternoon Linda's membrane\n\nruptured (or, as it is commonly described,\n\nher water broke) the family went for a\n\nride on a Melbourne tram.\n\nThe tram was crowded and no one\n\nstood up to offer Linda a seat. Shortly\n\nafter returning to their motel near the\n\nhospital Linda \"began to feel some\n\naction.\" John and Daniel drove her to the\n\nhospital and she was admitted about 6pm\n\non Sunday, June 22. Linda chose to have\n\nher very special baby in the hospital's\n\nfamily birth unit, which was opened last\n\nOctober.\n\nThe hours dragged by, with John\n\nleaving Linda's side only momentarily to\n\nstretch his legs or check on Daniel.\n\nLinda's contractions began in earnest\n\nabout 5am and after an examination -\n\nand encouraging words - Mr Johnston\n\nexplained that Candice was in an occipito\n\nposterior position (in other words she was\n\nfacing upwards rather than downwards).\n\nMost babies turn 180 degrees during\n\nbirth, correcting the position.\n\nCandice was not doing this and Linda\n\nwas in increasing pain. At 6.30am, Mr\n\nJohnston decided she should have an\n\nepidural. He rang the hospital's director\n\nof anaesthesia, Dr John Paull, who\n\narrived within minutes to administer the\n\npain-numbing drug to Linda.\n\nNear the end of her labour, it became\n\nnecessary for Mr Johnston to use forceps\n\nto gently turn the baby into the correct\n\nposition for birth.\n\nIt was about this time that the Reed\n\nfamily became the stars of their own film.\n\nA film crew from Channel 9's 60 Minutes\n\nfilmed the birth to provide Mr Johnston\n\nand the hospital with a documentary.\n\nCandice is a second miracle for the\n\nattractive young couple who married\n\nbelieving they could never have children\n\nof their own. Daniel was their first.\n\nLinda's tubes had been damaged\n\nduring a childhood case ol' appendicitis\n\nand doctors had told her she could never\n\nhave a baby.\n\n\"Then one day. after we'd been\n\nnone Help\n\nAn unforgettable moment for Linda\n\nand John with Daniel, 4, and newly\n\nborn Candice Elizabeth.\n\nPictures:\n\nDon McPhedran and Neville Waller.\n\nmarried a couple of years, I had the\n\nfeeling I was pregnant,\" Linda recalled as\n\nwe sat in the family's immaculate,\n\nmodern brick house one day last summer.\n\nLinda did her own pregnancy test at the\n\nhospital and was astounded to find it\n\n\"positive.\"\n\nLinda's pregnancy with Daniel was\n\nnormal - just as her second one with\n\nCandice was - but he came into the\n\nworld feet first, a breech birth.\n\nIn the few years after Daniel's birth.\n\nLinda suffered with three ovarian cysts,\n\nuntil finally her chances of ever again\n\nconceiving by normal methods were\n\nabsolutely nil.\n\n\"Then we read about the test tube\n\nbaby in England . . . and finally plucked\n\nup courage to go to our family doctor and\n\nask if any similar work was being done\n\nhere. He referred us to Mr Ian Johnston\n\nat the Royal Women's Hospital,\" Linda\n\nsaid.\n\nAfter a \"trial run,\" Linda was called\n\nback to Melbourne at the end of last\n\nSeptember so that her impending ovula-\n\ntion could be closely monitored. On\n\nOctober 1, she was admitted to thc\n\nhospital.\n\nLinda spent three days in the hospital\n\nwaiting for her egg, fertilized with John's\n\nsperm, to be implanter! And then \"on\n\nFriday, October 5, they came to me and\n\nsaid 'We've got to put it back'.\"\n\nShe then had to spend 24 hours lying\n\nflat on her back, \"terrified of sneezing!'\n\nIt was. after that, a very long drive back\n\nhome to Churchill.\n\nChurchill is a town of 4500 people in\n\nthe Latrobe Valley. John, who grew upin\n\nthe area, is a primary school teacher.\n\nShortly after Candice's birth, while\n\nLinda lay peacefully breastfeeding her\n\ndark-haired daughter, John walked out\n\nin the Melbourne cold (eight degrees) in\n\nhis shirtsleeves. \"I don't need a coat. I\n\nwon't even feel it!\" he laughed.\n\nAs he left, he shook Mr Johnston'sand\n\nMr Lopata's hands. \"Thank you.\" he\n\nsaid. \"Good on you, Johnno,\" Mr\n\nJohnston replied.\n\nAfter a day etched forever on her\n\nmind, Linda slept soundly, waking only\n\nto feed her daughter, a daughter her\n\nthrilled mother says looks \"so like Daniel\n\nat that age that it could be him.\"\n\nJohn and Daniel were back with\n\n\"their girls\" at the hospital after a solid,\n\n12-hour sleep at their motel. While\n\nDaniel sat propped with cushions on a\n\ndivan, holding Candice and gently\n\nstroking her hair, Linda said: \"I'm glad\n\nit's over - but it's still hard to believe.\n\nAlthough I had a lot of pain during\n\nCandice's birth, I'd do it all over again\n\neven if I had twice as much pain.\"\n\nLinda said that for nine months, she\n\nnone Help\n\nhad never considered the possibility of\n\nthere being \"something wrong\" with\n\nCandice. \"And then when my contrac-\n\ntions started, I spent about 10 minutes\n\nlying there worrying whether she'd have\n\nan extra arm or something.\"\n\nJohn did not share her concern. \"At\n\nleast I was relaxed about that,\" he\n\nlaughed. \"All the tests Linda had had\n\nduring her pregnancy showed that\n\nCandice was all right.\"\n\nJohn, who was not permitted to be\n\npresent at his son's birth, could not find\n\nwords to describe his feelings at the first\n\nsight of his daughter. \"I just want to\n\nmake a recommendation to all fathers\n\nthat they should be présent when their\n\nbabies are born,\" he said.\n\nJohn admitted to having some doubts\n\nabout Daniel being present in the\n\ndelivery room, but now says he and Linda\n\nare glad he was there.\n\nDaniel has now decided that he wants\n\nto be a doctor when he grows up. He has\n\nspent a lot of time with a stethoscope in\n\nhis ears listening to his sister's and\n\nmother's heartbeats.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be wonderful if they were\n\nboth doctors and worked together in the\n\nsame kind of medical field that made\n\nCandice possible?\" Linda said, smiling.\n\n\"I think what you wish for your\n\nchildren is a little more than what you\n\nhad for yourselves.\"\n\nCopyright. Any reproduction in whole or in part is\n\nexpressly forbidden.\n\nCANDICE: S5¡3T\n\nthe million dollar baby\n\nCandice Elizabeth Reed is a name\n\nthat will be forever noted in the\n\nannals of medical history. For she\n\nis the world's third \"test tube\" baby and,\n\nimportantly, the first to be born outside\n\nthe United Kingdom where the method\n\nof in vitro fertilization had its initial\n\nsuccess.\n\nHer safe arrival makes Australia the\n\nleading nation in in vitro (meaning \"in\n\nglass,\" hence \"test tube\") fertilization,\n\nsince the UK programme has been\n\nvirtually discontinued.\n\nCandice is the culmination of a\n\ndecade's research and work for two major\n\nMelbourne hospitals and their university\n\naffiliates. The unique collaborative study\n\nthat led to her birth was carried out by\n\nmedical teams from the Royal Women's\n\nHospital and the Queen Victoria Medical\n\nCentre, together with Melbourne Univer-\n\nsity and Monash University.\n\nThis million dollar baby - the pro-\n\ngramme has cost all that and needs more\n\nmoney to continue - is mainly the result\n\nof the combined work of Mr Ian\n\nJohnston, Dr Alex Lopata, Dr Ian Hoult\n\nand Dr Andrew Speirs, at the Royal\n\nWomen's Hospital.\n\nMore than 100 women have already\n\nbeen involved in what is known as the\n\nProgramme of In Vitro Fertilization and\n\nOvum Transfer (PIVOT), and there are\n\nstill 150 on a waiting list spanning five\n\nyears at PIVOT's present rate.\n\nEarly attempts at in vitro fertilization\n\nwere disappointing. It wasn't until 1978,\n\nwhen the success of Mr Patrick Steptoe\n\nand Dr Bob Edwards in the UK resulted\n\nin two healthy, live-born \"test tube\"\n\nbabies, that the Australian team decided\n\nto make at least one major change to its\n\nmethods.\n\nIt stopped priming patients with drugs\n\n- so that development of one or more\n\neggs was assured and a time for collecting\n\na ripe egg could be preplanned - and\n\nbegan relying on the woman's own,\n\nnatural cycles.\n\nAbout the same time, Dr Alex Lopata\n\nachieved a major breakthrough in his\n\nlaboratory process.\n\nDr Lopata produced a culture media\n\nwhich enabled 90 percent of a woman's\n\nripe eggs to be fertilized in the labora-\n\ntory. This made it possible for a high\n\nproportion of the fertilized eggs to grow\n\nnormally for three to four days in an\n\nincubator in preparation for their trans-\n\nfer to the patient's uterus.\n\nMr Ian Johnston and Dr Andrew\n\nSpeirs, relying on a patient's natural\n\ncycle, used three-hourly urine tests and\n\nultrasonic scanning of the ovaries to\n\nI-_\n\ndetermine when the ëgg?T~wéise- ready.\n\nTiming is of vital importance. Locating\n\nthe right egg is done with the patient\n\nunder general anaesthetic by making a\n\nsmall incision and using a laparoscope\n\n(an instrument used for internal examin-\n\nations, which emits a strong light).\n\nOnce located, the egg is gently picked\n\nup with an aspirating needle - a delicate\n\nsuction instrument.\n\nA couple of hours before the operation\n\nto remove an egg, the patient's husband\n\nhas prepared sperm in a nearby room.\n\nThe egg is washed in a special fluid and\n\nplaced with a droplet of the sperm.\n\nWhen the egg is fertilized, the embryo\n\nstarts to grow. The embryo is eventually\n\nplaced in a purified paraffin oil which\n\nprotects it during the critical time it is\n\nbeing examined to decide whether it is\n\nnormal before transfer into the uterus by\n\nway of the vagina.\n\nUntil now, women with blocked or\n\ndamaged fallopian tubes - like Linda\n\nReed's - have had no hope of ever\n\nbecoming pregnant. Tubal damage usu-\n\nally prevents the man's sperm from\n\nfertilizing the egg during the woman's\n\novulation.\n\nSurgery can be done to correct tubal\n\nblockages, but the operation is extremely\n\ndelicate and not always successful.\n\nAlthough the fallopian tubes are ap-\n\nproximately the size of a straw, their\n\ninner passageways are only about the size\n\nof thin sewing thread.\n\nThe tubes connect the fimbria, which\n\ntake the egg from the ovary and pass it\n\ndown the tube to the uterus. Inside the\n\ntubes is the normal meeting place of\n\nsperm and egg, where conception takes\n\nplace. The tubes are responsible for the\n\nsurvival of the fertilized egg during the\n\nthree days it takes to reach the uterus.\n\nDuring the journey, the egg takes\n\nnourishment from highly specialized cells\n\nalong the tubal passage. This is vital,\n\nbecause the egg must be strong enough to\n\nmake its niche in the lining of the uterine\n\ncavity.\n\nWith in vitro fertilization, the egg is\n\nremoved by laparoscopy, fertilized in the\n\nlaboratory, kept alive in an incubator for\n\nthe period when it would normally be\n\nmoving down the fallopian tube, and\n\nthen re-implanted as a microscopic\n\nembryo in its mother's womb.\n\nAll this might sound straightforward,\n\nbut it is not. Only dedicated team effort,\n\nwith some members on constant call day\n\nand night, has made Linda Reed's in vitro\n\nfertilization possible.\n\nThe Australian medical team's\n\nCONTINUED OVERLEAF\n\nCANDICE:\n\nthe million dollar baby\n\nFROM PREVIOUS PAGE\n\nsuccess with PIVOT is a direct result of\n\nits own experiments and studies.\n\nIt was during 1979 that the PIVOT\n\nteam began using women's natural\n\ncycles. Until then, patients had been\n\ngiven drugs to artificially stimulate egg\n\ndevelopment.\n\nIt has been - and still is - exhausting\n\nwork for the PIVOT team which must be\n\non call 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n\"We believe the programme is import-\n\nant,\" Mr Johnston said. \"Research into\n\nconception has the natural off-shoot of\n\nproviding information about contracep-\n\ntion. It is also valuable in studying\n\nhuman abnormality.\n\n\"Now we feel it is up to the commun-\n\nity to indicate whether it wants us to\n\ncontinue with our work.\"\n\nAlthough Mr Steptoe visited Mel-\n\nbourne shortly after the world's first\n\n\"test tube\" baby, Louise Brown, was\n\nborn in England, none of the crucial\n\nscientific aspects of his work with Dr\n\nEdwards was made available. It still has\n\nnot been fully documented in medical\n\njournals.\n\nThe PIVOT team, which has been\n\nvisited by numerous doctors involved in\n\nsimilar programmes overseas, is planning\n\nto publish its findings in medical\n\njournals.\n\nThe Australian work on in vitro\n\nfertilization actually began 10 years ago\n\nas a result of failure of another research\n\nproject at the Queen Victoria Medical\n\nCentre, which was an artificial fallopian\n\ntube - a plastic device designed to\n\nreplace a diseased or damaged tube in a\n\nwoman.\n\nThe device failed, but in presenting a\n\npaper on it at the Australian Society of\n\nReproductive Biology in Melbourne,\n\nProfessor Carl Wood and colleagues met\n\nan animal reproductive biologist, Dr Neil\n\nMoore, who suggested the possibility of\n\nexamining egg collection, laboratory\n\nfertilization, and transfer of the early\n\nembryo back to the patient.\n\nProfessor Wood spent a week examin-\n\ning Dr Moore's work on fertilization of\n\nsheep and was convinced of the possibil-\n\nity of using the technique for human\n\nreproduction. It was already known that\n\nMr Steptoe and Dr Edwards were\n\nattempting similar feats in the UK.\n\nIn 1971, the Royal Women's Hospital\n\nbecame interested in vitro fertilization\n\nafter Mr Ian Johnston heard Dr Edwards\n\naddress the International Infertility\n\nSociety Meeting in Tokyo.\n\nIt was with mutual interest and aim\n\nthat the two hospitals (the Queen\n\nVictoria and the Royal Women's) and\n\ntheir university affiliates, began working\n\non the programme that has made\n\nAustralian - and world - history.\n\nnone Help\n\nLinda and John with their baby and the PIVOT team that helped their dream bil\n\na reality, from left, Dr lan Hoult, Mr lan Johnston, Dr Alex Lopata, Dr Andrew Spjj\n\nnone Help\n\nnone Help\n\nHelp the test tube' baby researc\n\n\"What's all the fuss about?\"\n\nJohn helped Linda through her labour\n\nThe Programme of In Vitro Fer-\n\ntilization and Ovum Transfer\n\n(PIVOT) is in danger of ending.\n\nUnless funds are quickly raised to keep it\n\ngoing, there will be no more \"test tube\"\n\nbabies born in this country.\n\nThis means that many thousands of\n\ninfertile Australian women will be denied\n\nthe chance of ever having a baby.\n\nIt also means that a spin-off from the\n\nprogramme, vital research into methods\n\nof contraception, will end.\n\nFor these reasons, The Australian\n\nWomen's Weekly is launching a public\n\nappeal for funds to keep the programme\n\noperating.\n\n\"We need at least $100,000 a year to\n\ncontinue our research at its present\n\nrate,\" said Mr Ian Johnston, leader of\n\nMelbourne's Royal Women's Hospital\n\nPIVOT team.\n\nMr Johnston has asked the Federal\n\nGovernment and the Victorian State\n\nGovernment for financial aid. In both\n\ninstances, it is \"under consideration.\n\nAlthough more equipment - incuba\n\ntors and microscopes - is needed, M:\n\nJohnston says \"we desperately neec\n\nsalaries.\" Highly qualified scientists are\n\ncurrently working up to seven days s\n\nweek for $15,000 a year.\n\nThe team has been working with ont\n\nincubator, costing $4000, and one $6(XX\n\nmicroscope.
