        "text": "Stomach cancer develops when cells in any part of the stomach grow and divide abnormally. Tumours can begin anywhere in the stomach but most begin in the glandular tissue on the stomach's inner surface. This type of cancer is an adenocarcinoma of the stomach (gastric cancer).\n\nRare types of stomach cancer include small cell carcinomas, lymphomas, neuroendocrine tumours and gastrointestinal stromal tumours.\n\nStomach cancer is a relatively common cancer in Australia, however the number of people diagnosed has been falling.\n\nIt is estimated that more than 2,580 people are diagnosed with stomach cancer every year. Men are almost twice as likely as women to be diagnosed with stomach cancer. It is more common in people over 60, but it can occur at any age.\n\nDiagnosis of stomach cancer\n\nIf your doctor thinks you may have stomach cancer, you will be referred for further tests. The main test is an endoscopy (also known as a gastroscopy). The doctor will use a thin, flexible tube with a camera (endoscope), which passes into the mouth, down the throat and oesophagus into the stomach in order to look at the digestive tract.\n\nIf any suspicious-looking areas are detected, a small amount of tissue from the stomach lining may be removed (biopsy) and examined under a microscope. Less commonly used is an endoscopic ultrasound where the endoscope has an ultrasound probe at the end.\n\nAfter a diagnosis of stomach cancer\n\nAfter being diagnosed with a stomach cancer, you may feel shocked, upset, anxious or confused. These are normal responses. A diagnosis of a stomach or oesophageal cancer affects each person differently. For most it will be a difficult time, however some people manage to continue with their normal daily activities.\n\nYou may find it helpful to talk about your treatment options with your doctors, family and friends. Ask questions and seek as much information as you feel you need. It is up to you as to how involved you want to be in making decisions about your treatment.\n\nWhat should happen next?\n\nThis resource can help guide you and your loved ones after your diagnosis.\n\nTreatment for stomach cancer\n\nStaging\n\nAfter stomach cancer is diagnosed, one or more of the following tests are used to determine the extent of the cancer (its stage):\n\nblood tests\n\nCT scan\n\nultrasound scan\n\nPET-CT scan\n\nlaparoscopy\n\nendoscopic resection\n\nmolecular testing\n\nTypes of treatment\n\nThe main treatment for stomach cancer is surgery - a total or partial gastrectomy (removing all or part of the stomach). Chemotherapy may be given before surgery to shrink larger tumours. It can also be used after surgery to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.\n\nPalliative care\n\nIn some cases of stomach cancer, your medical team may talk to you about palliative care. Palliative care aims to improve your quality of life by alleviating symptoms of cancer.\n\nAs well as slowing the spread of stomach cancer, palliative treatment can relieve pain and help manage other symptoms. Treatment may include radiotherapy, chemotherapy or other drug therapies.\n\nTreatment Team\n\nDepending on your treatment, your treatment team may consist of a number of different health professionals, such as:\n\nGP (General Practitioner) -\n\nlooks after your general health and works with your specialists to coordinate treatment.\n\nGastroenterologist -\n\nspecialises in diseases of the digestive system.\n\nUpper gastrointestinal surgeon -\n\nspecialises in surgery to treat diseases of the upper digestive system.\n\nRadiation oncologist -\n\nprescribes and coordinates radiation therapy treatment.\n\nMedical oncologist -\n\nprescribes and coordinates the course of chemotherapy\n\nCancer nurse -\n\nassists with treatment and provides information and support throughout your treatment.\n\nOther allied health professionals -\n\nsuch as social workers, pharmacists, and counsellors"
