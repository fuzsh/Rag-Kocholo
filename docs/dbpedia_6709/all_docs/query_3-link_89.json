        "text": "Some people think IVF and Test tube baby are the same, and some think they are different. Read this blog to permanently close this debate and know the difference between IVF and Test Tube Baby- If any.\n\nWhat is the difference between In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Test Tube Baby?\n\nTechnically, there is no difference between In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and test tube baby. The test tube baby is a non-medical term used alternatively for IVF or In-Vitro Fertilization.\n\nThe term “test-tube baby” came into being because, during the IVF treatment, an embryo is formed in vitro, a petri dish or a test tube instead of the woman’s fallopian tube.\n\nA test-tube baby is produced with the IVF process outside a woman’s body. However, later, the matured embryo is transferred into the woman’s womb by implantation.\n\nIVF and test-tube babies are the same. It is just that doctors use the term IVF instead of test-tube babies.\n\nDo You Know?\n\nIn India, infertility affects approximately 10% – 15% of married couples. With the declining fertility rate, more couples are seeking infertility treatments making In-Vitro Fertilization OR test tube baby culture popular fertility treatment these days.\n\nWho requires IVF or Test Tube Baby Treatments?\n\nThere are various reasons why a couple chooses to conceive through IVF. Due to lifestyle changes and pollution, couples sometimes face difficulty conceiving or processing normal childbirth.\n\nOther reasons why a couple needs IVF treatment-\n\nBlocked fallopian tubes\n\nUnexplained Fertility\n\nEndometriosis\n\nReduced fertility in men and women.\n\nUterine fibroids.\n\nTo eliminate the fear of genetic disease. Fertilization will only take place through genetically fit egg cells.\n\nIf the male partner suffers from\n\na painful erection\n\nhas difficulty producing sperm, or\n\nhas a low sperm count, the couple can hire a sperm donor whose sperm can fertilize the eggs of the female partner.\n\nProcess of IVF and Test Tube Baby\n\nSince there is no difference between IVF and test tube baby, their In-Vitro fertilization process is the same. The steps can be enumerated as\n\nExamination- First, the doctor checks the ovarian reserve and reproductive health of the female partner. A USG is done to examine the condition of the ovaries and other reproductive organs.\n\nOvarian Stimulation- At the beginning of the cycle, hormonal medications are prescribed to stimulate the ovaries of a woman to produce a large number of eggs. The follicles are then monitored with the help of blood tests and ultrasounds.\n\nEgg Retrieval- Also known as follicular aspiration, is a surgical procedure to collect eggs. In this, a needle is inserted into the ovaries via the vagina and eggs are suctioned and retrieved.\n\nFertilization- Once the eggs are retrieved, they are sent to the lab for fertilization. The fertilized eggs are matured in a controlled lab setup for 3-5 days. The mature embryo is, called a blastocyte, ready for transfer.\n\nEmbryo Transfer- The embryo is very carefully inserted into a woman’s uterus using a catheter, which is slowly passed through the cervix and into the womb with the intent of conception.\n\nIVF Pregnancy-It is recommended to get a pregnancy test after 12 days to 2 weeks of embryo transfer.\n\nCost of IVF and Test Tube Baby in India\n\nThe cost of IVF in India varies in different locations and depends upon multiple factors.\n\nIf you are seeking an IVF treatment, choose a fertility hospital or clinic first. Talk to the doctors and faculty and understand the overall cost and everything it includes and excludes.\n\nIn some cases, medications, testing, and additional procedures may be included in the treatment cost, whereas in other places, it doesn’t.\n\nIn India, on average, IVF costs ₹1,10,000 to ₹4,00,000 per cycle.
