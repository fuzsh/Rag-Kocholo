        "text": "Your child’s poop (stool) must be tested so we can plan the treatment for your child. You will need to collect some stool (a specimen) at home, then bring it to a Nationwide Children's Hospital Laboratory Service Center.\n\nYou Will Need\n\nThe right container(s) for the test(s) ordered (examples shown in Picture 1). Not all tests use the same containers.\n\nA tongue depressor or plastic spoon\n\nFor an older child, a toilet hat (Picture 2) or plastic wrap\n\nA label to put on the container\n\nDisposable exam gloves (optional)\n\nLabel the Specimen\n\nChild’s full legal name – full first and last names correctly spelled\n\nOne of the following unique identifiers:\n\nDate of Birth or\n\nPatient’s ID or\n\nNationwide Children's Hospital medical record number\n\nDo steps 1 and 2 before starting the collection.\n\nDate of sample collection (MM/DD/YYYY) - write this after the collection.\n\nTime of sample collection (include a.m. or p.m.) - write this after the collection.\n\nNationwide Children's Clinics may give you an EPIC registration label to put on the container(s).\n\nCollect the Specimen\n\nCollect the specimen even if your child has loose, runny stools or diarrhea.\n\nWash your hands before and after handling your child's stool. Stool can contain germs that spread infection. Disposable gloves may be used, if desired.\n\nFor the test to be accurate:\n\nThere should be no creams or ointments on your child's bottom. However, if your child has diaper rash, it is okay to use cornstarch, petroleum jelly (Vaseline®), or Resinol®. These products will not affect the test.\n\nThe stool must not mix with pee (urine).\n\nDo not collect the stool from the toilet.\n\nInfants\n\nTake the stool out of the diaper. If your child has loose or runny stools, put the plastic side of the diaper next to the skin. Leave the diaper on this way just long enough to collect enough stool.\n\nToddlers\n\nIf your toddler is toilet trained, you can use a clean, dry training potty, training pants, or a diaper to collect the stool.\n\nOlder Children\n\nUse a clean, dry toilet hat to collect stools (Picture 2). Place the toilet hat on the back rim of the toilet bowl, just under the toilet seat.\n\nIf using plastic wrap, loosely drape a long section of plastic wrap over the rim on both sides of the toilet bowl. The stool can drop onto the dip in the plastic.\n\nPrepare the Specimen\n\nBefore you put stool into the specimen container, see pages 4 and 5 to know the exact amount, timing, and other special instructions for the type of test.\n\nCheck the label to be sure that it has your child's full legal name, and date of birth, patient ID number, or medical record number. Then, write the date and time of the collection. Please note, the specimen will not be tested if the patient's name and at least one other patient identifier are not on the label.\n\nUse a wooden tongue depressor (Picture 3) or a plastic spoon to place the right amount of stool into the specimen container for the test ordered.\n\nSecure the lid on the container(s), then place them in a resealable bag.\n\nThrow the tongue depressor or plastic spoon away.\n\nBring the stool specimen to a Laboratory Service Center as soon as possible. If you cannot bring it right away, some specimens may need to be refrigerated or frozen.\n\nIf you are collecting specimens for more than one child:\n\nWash your hands before getting stools from each child.\n\nMake sure the label on each container is filled out completely.\n\nPut all of each child's specimens in a separate resealable bag.\n\nDrop-off Options\n\nFor business hours and locations, please call Laboratory Services at (800) 934-6575 or visit NationwideChildrens.org/Lab\n\nDuring the day, drop the specimen off at:\n\nAny Laboratory Service Center or Nationwide Children's Close To Home™ Center.\n\nNationwide Children's Orange Laboratory located at 555 S. 18th Street, Columbus, Ohio 43205.\n\nIn the evening:\n\nNationwide Children's Hospital Admitting Department on main campus.\n\nPlease do not drop off stool specimens at the Emergency Department.\n\nFor questions, call Laboratory Services at (800) 934-6575 or your health care provider.\n\nStool Collection Chart\n\nFor more information regarding test availability or specimen requirements, please call (800) 934-6575 or visit NationwideChildrens.org/Lab.\n\nStool Collection Guidelines (PDF),\n\nHH-III-141 | ©2016, revised 10/2022 Nationwide Children’s Hospital"
