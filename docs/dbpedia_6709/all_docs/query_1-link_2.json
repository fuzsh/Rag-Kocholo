        "text": "Edinburgh: a dark winter evening. There's a bitter wind blowing off the Firth of Forth; all sane citizens are safely sheltered behind closed doors. The city is shutting down for the night. A perfect time, then, for film crews to begin work. Say what you like about Scotland's lack of winter daylight, but it makes organising a night shoot a damn sight easier.\n\nThe motley bunch of technicians, drivers and \"artists\" loitering in a square in the Stockbridge area of the city may not know it, but in a small way they're breaking new ground. Not simply because the film they're shooting is the directorial debut of 40-year-old Glaswegian Bernard Rudden; no, this movie, called Daybreak, is being nursed into existence by a much talked-about but as yet untested new film-making agency, the FilmFour Lab.\n\nThe Lab's central purpose is to pick up the slack left by Channel 4's ever-burgeoning feature film division. As FilmFour's production budgets drive relentlessly upwards, the Lab intends to nurse low-budget, riskier films that might otherwise be left behind. \"This time last year,\" explains Robin Gutch, the enthusiastic unit head, \"FilmFour felt there was no attention or energy in the area of creative, high-risk, low-budget film-making. The Lab was intended to focus on that area, and try and work with film-makers who are mostly at the emergent part of their career. Investing in these people early is actually very good commercial practice.\"\n\nGutch is essentially interested in films that cost no more than Â£1m. Twelve projects are in development; four will be put into production this year. Daybreak is the first; two more have just been announced - Large, a Birmingham-set comedy to be directed by Justin Edgar, and This Filthy Earth, from Andrew \"Gallivant\" Kotting. These are the kind of films to which the commercially oriented British film industry of the 90s has been particularly unkind, and Gutch sees the Lab as a way of building on the small-scale activities of the now defunct BFI Production and Channel 4's own independent film and video department, which he once headed.\n\nDaybreak has set up office in an industrial unit wedged among the tenements on the east side of town; the gloomy towers of Hibs' Easter Road stadium squat in the near distance. A tiny office contains hard-at-it production assistants; in the same building, over three floors, are sets in various states of preparedness.\n\nIt's here that James Mackay and Jim Hickey, Daybreak's producers, explain how their movie ended up with the FilmFour Lab. Mackay and Hickey, longtime friends, are working together for the first time. They have very different pasts. Mackay is veteran of a string of Derek Jarman films, culminating in the valedictory Blue in 1993. Hickey is on his first feature after a long stint as director of the Edinburgh film festival - but he brought the talent with him, as he produced Rudden's award-winning short The Hunger Artist in 1995.\n\nMackay is vociferous about the funding crisis that has faced experimental film-making in recent years. \"By the time we got to the end of Blue, funding just seemed to disappear completely. Channel 4 had got new management in, there was nowhere to send a project. The BFI was being wound down. The lottery in England was cash-rich, but they committed 90% of it to the film production franchises, making it very difficult for individual projects. In the 80s, I found strong support from British Screen for The Last of England and The Garden. In the 90s they only wanted something very safe and costumey.\"\n\nDaybreak actually began life in January 1996, when Rudden's script won financial backing from the Scottish Arts Council. But the very qualities that attracted Mackay and Hickey - Rudden's adventurous visual style and his determination to let improvisation determine much of the storyline - scared off backers. Just as the Arts Council's two-year deadline was running out, Daybreak forced its way into the FilmFour Lab's attention - not least, it seems, because of the director's willingness to take on the hot medium of digital video.\n\n\"Bernard was very keen to work that way,\" says Hickey. \"Some years ago, he saw that digital offered him a possibility of getting a first feature made - it offered him a chance to get the vision he was developing for the project on to the screen.\" Gutch concurs, but emphasises that Daybreak won't simply be a retread of the stripped-down camcorder aesthetic that underpinned the likes of Festen and The Idiots. \"What Daybreak will show, I think, is that digital can be amazingly beautiful.\"\n\nAnd what of the director? Rudden is a friendly soul, relaxed and good-humoured on set, cracking jokes as his French cinematographer stomps unhappily over the Edinburgh cobbles. Talking about his film, though, he becomes almost bashful. He's grateful to FilmFour because \"they came in early and stuck with it\", and is excited about the possibilities offered by digital film-making. He wasn't an instant convert, but it was a case, after considerable experimentation, of \"getting to textures that I liked. It was different from cinema, but not video. But you still have to know in your mind what the image and the resolution are, what the aesthetic is, how it interacts with the subject matter. A celebration of wilful amateurism can only take you so far.\""
