        "text": "Audio Bullys - Kazahkstan\n\nWe did it!.\n\nAgainst the odds. We did it. No. I dont mean we made and played the show after thirty two hours and seven flights (one missed! Thanks Lufthansa..!)\n\nNo. I mean we went the whole weekend without mentioning Borat!...Nice!\n\nBorat was actually filmed in the Romanian countryside. Kazahkstan is suprisingly oriental. It actually borders Tibet, China, Siberia and Mongolia.\n\nWe played the Kazahkstan National Football stadium where England will be playing a world cup qualifier later in the qualifying stages. I hope they clean the toilets . I cant imagine posh taking a dump in there and that was the best dressing room\n\nSee if you can spot what may ruin the atmosphere of the show?!! Answer later...\n\nSecurity was lapse. 500 machine gun toting army and police!!!\n\nLOOK BEHIND YOU!!\n\nI gave my usual press conference\n\nMy sister and also No. 4 pr....... Stop!!\n\nWe tried on Kazak hats. As you do!...Rickey (Sound Engineer)\n\nNot my sister...!\n\nShabby (Monitors) Terry (Drums)\n\nAnswer to earlier question.\n\nThere was an international match the next day so no-one was allowed on the pitch!!\n\nWhere we went wrong!!\n\nLazing on Sunday Afternoon. I aint got no worries .\n\nPerfect Sunday afternoon. Sushi and cider for breakfast with the Sunday papers.\n\nNo change there.\n\nI havent blogged at all recently, basically because I havent had time and Im starting to think it's a bit selfcentered. People have got their own lives and problems. Who wants to read about mine???. Anyhow, with Lilleth we were always on a boring plane, train or bus ride to somewhere with nothing to do but tap away until your battery ran out!\n\nIm tour managing the Audio Bullys at the moment and even though they don't like touring and just do long weekends and festivals, I always seem to be busy fixing or sorting out another problem for someone. Weve recently done Soulcrusher, Wireless and Glastonbury. I felt like the page three girl in Capitalist Monthly by getting a cab back from Glastonbury to Brighton for the measly sum of £300.00. It was 4am, no-one was answering or hearing their phone. I went back to our tour bus and Tom had set up his decks and was DJing to a packed party. With nowhere to sleep and the days of waking up on a cider soaked duey pillow behind me. As if by magic a white taxi cab seemed to glide towards me from the VIP area. Where to mate Brighton £300 Get in. I lovely ride home watching the sun come up with Mac our LD.\n\nNEW FRIENDS\n\nB4Now\n\nThe Del Strangefish Show\n\nIm not giving up drinking.\n\nIm not giving up FUN\n\nIm going out now.\n\nGonna take lots of drugs .\n\nWe left Brighton before the cock had a chance to crow and arrived in Bolton seven hours too early at the first of two 'City Invasion' shows. The padlock was already off so the joy of the stare was denied. To the pubmobile . I wish we were still Banned from the Pubs cos the few and far between pubs that we visited in Bolton left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter a good old Pissed and Proud test tube set it was back to Banjos pub The Thatched House in Stockport for an all night lock in, completed in true original test tube style by Dave and myself.\n\nWe had to stop off somewhere off the M6 for someones wake on the way to London. Didnt get to see the body though.\n\nAfter another pub stop and some beautiful blackcurrant cider we stepped over a few hypocritical long faces into the bus and had a great crash out until we woke up outside the Islington Academy for show two of the City Invasion Tour.\n\nOverall a quality fun filled weekend with the test tube party stylee in full effect.\n\nA few thanks Everyone who came and had a laugh with us at the bar, Vinnie from the Agnostics (Still younger than Charlie Harper!), all our American friends, Nuria from Madrid for her gifts and most of all, Banjo for looking after us in the depressed northwest.\n\nCheers!\n\nDel\n\nBand of the Weekend: Random Hands\n\nThe Del Strangefish Show\n\nGood Evening and it is with a heavy heart that I bring you the sad news of the inevitable demise of 'Melty the Snowman'. Doctors say he may not make it through the night.\n\nApril 08\n\nLittle Paedophile Victim 2\n\nRight. Let me tell you where I'm at.\n\nThis is my page. This is my opinion.\n\nJoe Strummer must be spinning in his grave. I didnt start a punk band so I could help fund the American multi million dollar porn industry.\n\nWhat has pornography got to do with punk rock? Zilch!\n\nI urge people who would go and see this type of movie to boycott it!\n\nI was not consulted about the use of my music in this film and to my mind that is no way to conduct a business.\n\nSo for that reason...... I'm Out.\n\nApril 2008\n\nThe Del Strangefish Show\n\nWhich unlucky location will have the displeasure of our company this month......?\n\nThe city of Athens, Greece.\n\nThe Limousine driver seemed strangely familiar.\n\nStraight to the restaurant mmmm which dog shall I choose?\n\nThe show went well..! All together now...Elvis had a heart attack...\n\nNight cap. Next stop Lewisham!\n\nSee you in the bar!\n\nDel x\n\nPicture of the Month\n\nHrvatska\n\nThat's Croatia to you. Zagreb. Population 779,145 wait a minute. Make that 779,146.\n\nReceived international recognition 15th January 1992.\n\nMission: to get drunk and get paid.\n\nIt`s the first festival of the year. 7:00 AM and were off to Gatwick.\n\nThis brings back memories. Shoes off, computer out, free whisky tasting.\n\nHold on, make that free Mojito tasting.\n\nAfter a heavy Friday night it was up early for Saturday morning TV.\n\nOnions Turpin....No, it`s not a 12 string!!\n\nDave and I get into the festival spirit\n\nand beers...\n\nWe attempt to rock!\n\nThe girls like me the best!\n\nBand and crew, pockets filled with Croation Kunas line up for a photo in front of some traditional old Croation scaffolding.\n\nMission accomplished!!\n\nH`s Review:\n\nI woke up at 6:00AM on Friday morning. Took a 10mg Valium and had a brandy coffee. Next thing I know, I`m being dropped off Sunday night covered in bruises!!!!\n\nPicture of the Week\n\nWhen Brewery Bears Attack!\n\nDel Xxxx\n\nThe Del Strangefish Show\n\nNOSTRADELMAS PREDICTS...\n\nThis was my prediction on Steve Mcclueless's initial appointment\n\nMay 2006\n\nWell, not since Graham `Turnip` Taylor have the FA made such a monstrous decision as to employ Steve `plenty of chances `McClaren` as England manager. We all new he was a crap tacticianer when Middlesborough lost 7-0 to Arsenal. Or when he lost the final of the UEFA cup trying the same `4 up front` idea, that fluked him through the quarters and semi`s after being three down at half time. The FA think they are clever by hiring Terry Venables as their `get out of jail free card`. So when McClaren fucks up as predicted, they can bring in El Tel to placate the fans.\n\nBuffoons!\n\nPretty close really, apart from the El Tel bit...\n\nUnfortunatley, due to Mcclarens stubbornness Venables was never given a chance.\n\nMore accurate predictions, for 2008, next month\n\nOVERRATED OVERPAID AND UNDERPERFORMING\n\nThree reasons why I`m glad England did not qualify...\n\n1. Mcclaren would still be manager had we scraped through!\n\n2. The peoples of Austria and Switzerland will be spared from English thuggery.\n\n3. People will now wake up to the real root of the problem. The Dinosaurs at the FA!\n\nThe recent 2-3 defeat at wobbly stadium brought to the surface some long time unanswered questions. ??? Why didn`t the rich pampered primadonnas try? Thinking about which Ferrari to buy next? How will this affect my endorsements? Selfish and greedy with no hunger. Who should be the next manager? Klinsmann? Another spoilt tosser. Mourinho? Wouldn`t touch it! Capello? Too arrogant, can`t speak English and in it for the money once again! My choice would be Harry, but why would he take it? What's the point? It`s a bit like the test tubes at the moment. No European Championships, No record deal, just pointless friendlies next summer!!\n\nHeres an idea. As there are hardly any english players in the premiership. Throw out the likes of Derby, Wigan and Bolton and get in Madrid, Barcelona. Bayern, Juve, Celtic or Rangers. Call it the European Premiere League and make the Championship the English Football League Division One and limit the amount of foreign players. That way we don`t have to suffer the Gillette/Pepsi ads or the WAG`s and our young players will get a chance to develop.\n\nAway from fatball and over to a real British working class hero. Come on Ricky smash the shit out of mouthy Floyd Moneyfeather!\n\nMore sport when it becomes interesting...\n\nTwo Uninteresting and Unrelated Stories this month...\n\n1 . I'm walking across Victoria station. Still spangled from the night before. When a young lady dressed as an Orangutan approaches me off guard. \"Got any shrapnel sir!\" I surrender two pence. That's all I could find. Honestly. I fumbled away in my pockets breathlessly. Her orange fur was strangely beautiful! I began to have visions of a beautiful tree house together. You know that feeling when a couple of seconds last an hour. Then you panic. Oh my god. I'm drifting away from reality. I may never come back. The fear of straight jackets and 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos' nest begin to haunt me. Then. !SNAP! Oh shit! You're back in the station! The whole world is depending on me! I quickly release the two pence peace into the bucket. She's still smiling.\" I hope the Orangutans survive\" I mumble as I shuffle on to the train (to be continued)\n\n2 .I'm on the train and desperate to go into the toilet. There's somebody in there. I wait. A heavily pregnant woman gets in the queue behind me and smiles.I start to feel guilty. She's probably busting for a piss and I'm not even legitimately going to the toilet. We hear the flush. \"Would you like to go first?\" I told you I was a good bloke! \"No you go ahead\" Oh no! Even guiltier. I go into a flap trying to sort it all out before she gives birth. £50 notes are falling like confetti. I get the job done and lift the toilet seat. Disaster!! Someone's pissed all over the seat. Bastard, She'll think it's me!!\n\nSo the moral of these completely uninteresting stories are .Never fall in love with an Orangutan, you will be cleaning up piss for the rest of your life!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nFinally...\n\nI was digging in the garden when I came across this!!!\n\nMerry Christmas\n\nGroundhog Del Xxxx\n\nLast Updated.... December 2007\n\nDel's Old blogs\n\n`The Del Strangefish Show`\n\nHot Off The Press....... Cave Man Dave Joins .......... 'Chelsea'\n\nAgainst Their Wishes!!!\n\nHi Everybody,\n\nHands up who hated it when the pink panther started talking!...and in that stupid upper class english accent....pink pratt!\n\nI have to apologise once more for my absence but I have been laid up with another bout of lazycuntitis\n\nLily got her US visa revoked, so while I was supposed to be in Las Vegas watching Britney wandering around the stage like a zombie with her gut out.....Instead I was in Brighton wandering around the back garden like zombie with my gut out. At least I wasnt being televised..or was I..? Who knows these days..?\n\nSo a whole lovely month off. What have I been up to? Well apart from the boring stuff like catching up with the accounts, filling out tax returns and being thrown out of award ceremonies. I have been quietly busy writing and recording some tracks.\n\nHere are some recent comments posted on my MySpace page.......\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/thedelstrangefishinexperience\n\nhake Myself A\n\n30 Sep 2007 11:36\n\nHey I Really like your music!\n\nEspecially \"Shake Myself Awake\"!!!

It's great to hear some great music from somebody that WAS there and STILL is! You'd better watch it, or the 'Hot Topic' crowd may latch onto you (although anything by Flesh for Lulu is safe, as they're not too big on looking into the past to find that history only repeats itself). Hope things aren't bad between you and the rest of the guys from Flesh (I saw that you both had new album/songs, and too much VH1 'Bands Reunited...) Anyhow, keep it up! And I hope you find your lost black sock- if not, my wife has lost several dozen over the last ten years (all of increasing sentimental value), and I've got them all! Kind of like being a kidnapper with a hostage (or 36 +/-)- you need something for leverage (or to just drive someone crazy). Her socks are yours, especially with the Lily Allen connection. It's great to hear something from the past come back, but new, and make you remember that the future could still be better.\n\nwes\n\nWes- (you remember, UWM w/Gene Love Jezebel in '87, Eagles Club in Milwaukee w/P.I.L. in '89? Jk, I remember and it's awesome to have some of those memories back, with more to be made. Let there be song and socks for all.\n\n30 Sep 2007 10:13\n\nyou are the shit, I love you\n\nComment Back - Send Message - Block User - Delete My Comment\n\n*Carey*\n\n30 Sep 2007 22:22\n\nThere is nothing better to prepare you in the morning than listen to 'shake myself awake', plus it also can accomodate to a bitta dancing. *Carey*xx\n\n30 Sep 2007 20:44\n\nsuch great music here.\n\nhow are you?

September 2007\n\nMy Unlucky Day\n\nEx\n\ncuses,\n\nPicture of the Month\n\nCU NEXT MONTH\n\nDEL XxX\n\nGood Evening and Welcome again to\n\n`The Del Strangefish Show`\n\nHOT OFF THE PRESS....Mark Verrion aka Skweech/Scab...Has left the Masked Raiders to start a new life in California. Bookies favourite, Paul ' H ' Henrickson is set to be named as his replacement!!\n\nSorry about contracting lazyblogitis.\n\nSo wadbinappenin!!\n\nA Quiet Night In!\n\nTired but Inpsired\n\nenough to write this anyway.\n\nWent to Spain on Sunday only to discover that my electricity had been cut off. Took a couple of days to sort that out (191.00) Euros. I foolishly decided to take the 'skin of your teeth express` to Gibraltar. (3.75 Euros). I am missing the big feria in my village this week to do Japan and Australia, so I had a few drinks in the `El Gecko` to make up for it before I left. Another mistake. Got the train with a bottle of Bornos, but, as if by surprise, developed the famous Bornos blackout and left my bag when I got off. Itch, itch, itch. I got a taxi driver to overtake the train and got my bag at the next station. After a spot of cash point hunting (50.00 Euros) and bit of car trouble I finally arrived at Gibraltar airport to discover they had closed the gate. The plane was still on the runway but I`m sure everyone has been there before . No way! .God my bites itch! So, after paying for another flight (200.00 Euros) I decided to find an English pub with Wi Fi (or Wiffy as the Spanish call it!)\n\nAfter a quick airport search ' The Lord Nelson' popped up and they did a fine pint of Scrumpy Jack or six. (36.00 Euros but worth it!..not per pint Total!..Der!!)\n\nOoh my bites still hurt from sleeping rough whoops! nearly gave the middle of the story away there!\n\nSo here I am sitting in the 'Naeba Princes Ski Resort at Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, finishing a can of strongbow and about to hit the festival with the girls and boys!\n\nAnyway in true Tarantino style , rewind and fast forward to the present. Just got in and had a great festival laugh. Ricky from the Keiser Chefs ( Yes..I know, it was deliberate!) was pushing me on the big fast spin around swingy thing when he trod in a puddle got a bootful and fell over and grazed all his arm up.\n\nThey should rename the Gatwick Express, `The Gatwick Tortoise.' Feel like pushing the emergency button and running along beside it. Bet I get to Victoria first!!\n\nIdeas That Will Never Happen Pt IIIV\n\nWe are on at the same time as the Keisers but on different stages (obviously ed!) Piss off your fired. So we came up with this idea. After synchronising watches. We are both gonna stop at the same time and Ricky`s going to shout 'Day Oh!'...and Lilys gonna shout from the other stage 'Day Oh!'..and then the whole festival is gonna sing. 'Daylight come and I wanna go home!!.\n\nForget that Shit sir I just wrote Mr hyde is here again, Fuck th Goddamm 'for the goodness. Anbyway we rabbitted foer hours then felled asheepeep\n\n321, your back in the room.\n\nSo back to Thursday. Got thrown out the pub and decided in a drunken haze that I`d wasted enough money, so I was gonna sleep rough until check in at 6:20 AM. Another bad decision as I have now been bitten to within an inch of my life by mosquitos and an idiot thought it would be funny to try and piss on me . One swift right hand jab and the guy rolls down the bank and hits is head on a palm tree, as you do! The police arrive Ola Ola Ola\n\nThat's where the word 'gibberish` comes from, you know. Gibraltan and English. A sort of mixture of Spanish and English. Seeee . informative AND entertaining!\n\nAfter foolish decision number 237 in a series of ten million I have plotted up on a nice grassy bank between a couple of Burt Lancasters palm trees. A glorified gutter if you wish! I explain to the police that I`ve missed my flight and I`m just killing time `til the next one etc\n\nSuddenly the unconscious guy gets up and legs it?\n\nThe Gibraltan police give chase. I go back to sleep in my million star hotel. Only to be woken at 5AM by a gang of Gibraltan girls, rebelling against thier parents, for having to grow up on a huge piece of concrete modelled after Canning Town!\n\n\"What you doing 'ere mate!.\n\nI`m waiting to got to Japan.\n\n\"What you going there for?\"\n\nDoing a festival. I work for a singer.\n\n\"Ooo?\"\n\nLily Allen.\n\n\"Liar!. We love `er\"\n\nTokyo.\n\nPresent Day\n\nJust pissed off an American. He walked away in mid conversation. Didn't like my views on Iraq. Prefered CNN version.\n\nTravelodge Marelybone No Show!... (120.00 Euros)\n\nAfter a couple of dabs, me, my broken finger and the girls decide to go to a 24 hour diner in La Linea, where they serve Spanish style G&T`s. Always thought that was a great name for a Spanish costal town \"The Line\" itch itch!\n\nOops I did it Again!\n\nDaylight come and I nearly miss plane again!\n\nWho`d employ me?\n\nAnyway I make it but I`m fog bound. Well the plane is.\n\nAll aboard the Gatwick Tortoise (20.00 Euros) and then into London traffic in a taxi (75.00 Euros). After much lying and cheating and pushing in, I make it to the gate for my flight to Japan with two minutes to spare. Lily rings me to tell me off for being late. If only she knew. and then tells me I stink of alcohol and piss and look like I slept rough last night.\n\n..and this is only the stuff I can remember!\n\nAfter a successful show at the Fuji Rock Festival. We returned to my local in Tokyo. The Dubliners Irish pub. The perfect pint of Guinness and some traditional fish and chips with wasabi sauce and air conditioning.\n\n\"Mr Del. It`s time to go home. I think you`ve had enough. See you tomorrow!\"\n\nAnyway fed up of typing with a broken finger and two million mozzie bites..itch!\n\nIf I wake up screaming. I`ll let you know!\n\nWho`d be me!!\n\nMade it back to my secret location holiday via Tokyo, Perth, Melbourne, Sydney, Heathrow, Gatwick and Gibraltar. Spent the week chilling and getting over jet lag. Laying in the hammock writing this blog while listening to some reggae with a nice glass of Frexeneit. This is what life's all about.\n\nWent to see my fiend Marcus play at Messas bar last night.\n\nSorry for my nonappearance at the Rebellion festival this weekend. This was due to other touring commitments that didn`t happen in the end. Plus the fact, H, has just had a baby (Medical first!). His name is Lenny.\n\nWe`ll be back next year!\n\nHeres a quick quiz.

The Manufacturer Recommends a Relaxed Mood, a Couple of Cans and a Spliff)\n\nDREAM TEAM BECOME NIGHTMARE !*\n\nSo, just to let you know that the shows in Southampton and Brighton have been cancelled due to the implosion of Peters Dream Team ( A phrase coined by AD). Word on the grapevine is said to have Walnut resigning in a red faced rage at Concrete Jungle last weekend. While Andy Aggros stylist has advised him against another visit to the red light district of Southampton after what happened `last time`!!!\n\nPIPELINE EMPTY!*\n\nAfter the collapse of the Locomotive Record Deal due to unconceivable differences between Peter and the aforementioned record company. Regular checks around the corner for a deal heading the bands way have proved fruitless. Anyone who was bored of waiting in the queue before we finally decided to go with Locomotive Music may no return with their wheelbarrow filled with Euros.\n\nBIRD LANDS ON WINDOW CILL THEN FLIES OFF!!\n\nAs I was doing the washing up when something caught my eye. A bird had landed on the window cill! I assumed it must have sensed that I was watching and instantaneously decided to fly away as quickly as possible. I could not have caught it through the glass anyway and even if I was quick enough and had what would I have done with it??\n\nMore Highly Offensive Top Hot Gossip Next Month!!!\n\nThis month I`ve been to New York. Where the native New Yorkers failed to seize the moment and exploit this great photo opportunity!\n\nI put on a rousing private performance for Ms Lily!\n\nThat`s about it for tonight. So I`ll say goodbye and leave you with a joke...\n\nOh Well. I thought It was funny!\n\nSee you next time!\n\nDelx\n\nDel's blog, old stuff\n\nRecent entries you might have missed, we delete the old crap.\n\nBob Woolmer to Replace McClaren as England Number One.......\n\n......Buffoon!!\n\nGreat Idea No1\n\nFootball\n\nWell, not since Graham `Turnip` Taylor have the FA made such a monstrous decision as to employ Steve `plenty of chances `McClaren` as England manager. This is not in hindsight. We all new he was a crap tacticianer when Middlesborough lost 7-0 to Arsenal. Or when he lost the final of the UEFA cup trying the same `4 up front` idea, that fluked him through the quarters and semi`s after being three down at half time. The FA think they are clever by hiring Terry Venables as their `get out of jail free card`. So when McClaren fucks up as predicted, they can bring in El Tel to placate the fans.\n\nBuffoons!\n\nGreat Idea No2\n\nCricket\n\nCan` t any one see it except me?\n\nIt` s obvious. Pakistan put all the money on them losing their opening game against the West Indies. This would be less suspicious then throwing the Ireland game.The plan was to lose to the Windies (who haven` t been playing particularly well lately) and are the home team. Then cruise through in second place against the unfancied Irish. One problem, Bob Woolmer and the Pakistani team did not expected the Irish to put up such a spirited performance and send them home.\n\nHence strangulation!!"
