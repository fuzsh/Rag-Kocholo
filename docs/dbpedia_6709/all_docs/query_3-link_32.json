        "text": "When scientists produced the first embryo in a Petri dish, no one was quite sure it wouldn't have two noses or an extra spleen. Some worried that it might be nothing short of the Creature from the Black Lagoon.\n\nTo make things more complicated, plenty of critics claimed it was immoral to mix sperm and eggs in the laboratory. The former movie star in the White House even refused to fund research into in-vitro fertilization.\n\nTimes change, as revealed in \"Test Tube Babies,\"a fascinating new PBS documentary that airs Monday night, Oct. 23, as part of the \"American Experience\" series.\n\nNot even a quarter-century after the first test-tube baby was born in the U.S., some 400,000 other children have joined her in this country. Somehow, the rip-roaring debate over in-vitro fertilization -- almost acarbon-copy of today's battles over stem-cell research and cloning --\n\nhas completely vanished.\n\nThrough interviews with doctors, the parents of the first American test-tube baby and a couple who lost their chance at parenthood due to a freaked-out hospital administrator, \"Test Tube Babies\" sheds light on how American society came to accept the once-unthinkable.\n\nGenerative AI Has a 'Shoplifting' Problem.

To get there, the breaking community had to figure a way to objectively judge the subjective, while letting the dance remain a dance.\n\nThe Physics of Cold Water May Have Jump-Started Complex Life\n\nWhen seawater gets cold, it gets viscous. This fact could explain how single-celled ocean creatures became multicellular when the planet was frozen during “Snowball Earth,” according to experiments.\n\nThe 17 Top New Android 15 Features\n\nAndroid 15 is creeping closer to its release date. Here are the notable features and upgrades Google has in store.\n\nInside the Dark World of Doxing for Profit\n\nFrom tricking companies into handing over victims’ personal data to offering violence as a service, the online doxing ecosystem is not just still a problem—it’s getting more extreme.\n\nNo, the Seine Cleanup Wasn’t a Failure\n\nThe goal of the Seine-cleansing project is to produce swimmable conditions for the people of Paris for years to come—the Olympics was just a milestone in getting there.\n\nThe Best Chromebooks for Every Budget\n\nChoosing the right Chromebook for your needs can be a tough decision.
