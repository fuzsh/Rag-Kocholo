        "text": "One source that has been found to cover this topic is a recorded documentary aired on PBS entitled \"Test Tube Babies\". This documentary includes examples of how doctors and other professionals attempted to complete in vitro fertilization before it was done successfully. An example included in the video was Dr. Landrum Shettles who attempted human egg fertilization in 1973 but was unsuccessful in producing a child from the method (Test Tube Babies). This account and others like it, help to display the struggle that took place within this scientific study until the adequate amount of time, and research had been reached.

Showing both the good and the bad sides of the story helps to prepare a balanced and non biased evaluation. Thirdly, another online article was analyzed. The article was released by New York Daily News two days after the first test tube baby was born. It describes the birth of the baby and the parents' reactions. This article should be considered semi-reliable because it is a first hand record of the events that happened through a reporter including quotes from the parents and doctors. These quotes and facts help to make the source reliable, however the article could have included possible bias when it stated that the birth of Louise Amoy Brown \"…sent waves of joy and wonder around the world\" (Edelson).
