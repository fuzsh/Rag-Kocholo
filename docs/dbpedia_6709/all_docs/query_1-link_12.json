        "text": "IVF is a life-changing medical treatment for so many women. While access to it is becoming more difficult on the NHS, the success rate of IVF has tripled over the last 20 years, changing the lives of so many families.\n\nIt's a really crucial part of the fertility journey for so many women, which is why it's truly amazing that a Netflix film is being made to honour it.\n\nJoy was written by Enola Holmes scribe Jack Thorne and directed by Sex Education's Ben Taylor. It will span from 1968 to 1978 as important medical advancements are made toward the conception and birth of a “test tube baby.”\n\nHere's everything we know so far, including the first look Netflix just dropped.\n\nWhat is Joy about?\n\nAccording to a synopsis for the Netflix film, it will follow three “trailblazers” – a young nurse, a visionary scientist and obstetrician, a gynaecologist and a surgeon – that are facing opposition to their work in producing the world's first “test-tube baby” Louise Joy Brown.\n\nWhat is the true story that Joy is based on?\n\nIt follows Jean Purdy, Robert Edwards and Patrick Steptoe, the three reproductive medicine pioneers who were involved in the development of the first “test tube baby”, Louise Joy Brown, who was the first human to be born from in vitro fertilisation on 25 July 1978. It has been described as “the most remarkable medical breakthroughs of the 20th century”.\n\nRobert Edwards was even awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 2010.\n\nJoy cast\n\nThomasin McKenzie (Eileen, Last Night In Soho) will play the nurse and embryologist Jean Purdy, James Norton will play scientist Robert Edwards and Bill Nighy will play the surgeon, Patrick Steptoe.\n\nCharlie Murphy (Peaky Blinders, Happy Valley), Do Revenge's Rish Shah, Cecily Cleeve and Eoin Duffy will also star.\n\nWhat have the team behind Joy said about it?\n\nScript writer Jack Throne and director Ben Taylor have both spoken out about the impact of their personal experiences of the IVF process, and what an honour it has been to bring its creation to the screen.\n\n“I am a lifelong Jack Thorne fan, and it has been such a thrill to work with him and Rachel on my first feature film,” Taylor has said. “As the proud father to two boys only made possible by IVF, this is a story extremely close to my heart. It’s an honour to bring to life the journey of this heroic trio, whose world-changing work was only achieved in the face of unimaginable opposition.\n\n\"Thomasin, James and Bill – together with the rest of the cast – are an embarrassment of riches. I’m delighted that Pathe, Wildgaze and Netflix entrusted me with this brilliant story.”\n\nJack also opened up about him and his partners' IVF journey and Joy's “incredible story”.\n\n“It took Rachel and I seven rounds of IVF to have Elliott, so when the opportunity came to tell the story of the pioneers, I jumped at the chance and suggested Rachel might like to jump too,” he said. “The more we discovered, the more amazed we were, at the audacity of the science and the lack of support from the scientific community. It is an incredible story. Working on this with our incredible cast, wonderful director Ben and the brilliant producers at Wildgaze, Pathe and Netflix has been a joy.”\n\nThe 17 best TV shows of 2024, from Palm Royale and The Regime to Bridgerton season three\n\nGallery17 Photos\n\nView Gallery\n\nWhen is the release date for Joy?\n\nIt's likely to be later this year, as the film is in post-production stages.\n\nIs there a Joy trailer?\n\nNetflix has just dropped a first look!
