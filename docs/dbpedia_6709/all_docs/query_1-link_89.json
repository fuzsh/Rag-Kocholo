        "text": "1. On July 25, 1978, Louise Brown, the world’s first test-tube (in vitro fertilisation) baby, was born at Oldham General Hospital...\n\n2. ...Five years later, on July 25, 1983, the world’s first test-tube baboon was born in San Antonio, Texas.\n\n3. As the first non-human primate conceived in a laboratory dish, it was named ET (standing for Embryo Transfer).\n\n4. In 1948, 30 years before Louise Brown was born, a film called Test Tube Babies was made in the US.\n\n5. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the phrase “test-tube babies” dates back to 1935.\n\n6. In 1999 Louise Brown’s sister Natalie, who had also been born by IVF, became the first test-tube baby to give birth naturally to a baby of her own.\n\n7. When referring to science experiments, the phrase “test tube” has been used since 1846.\n\n8. Michael Faraday (1791-1867) has been credited with inventing the test tube. Until his time, wine glasses were often used for storage by chemists.\n\n72-Year-Old Woman Becomes First Time Mother Through IVF\n\n9. IVF procedures are generally performed in a Petri dish, not a test tube.\n\n10. Worldwide, more than five million babies have now been born by IVF."
