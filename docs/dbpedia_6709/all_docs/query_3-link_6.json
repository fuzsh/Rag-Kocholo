        "text": "Today, in vitro fertilization (IVF) is practically a household word. But not so long ago, it was a mysterious procedure for infertility that produced what were then known as \"test-tube babies.\" Louise Brown, born in England in 1978, was the first such baby to be conceived outside her mother's womb.\n\nUnlike the simpler process of artificial insemination -- in which sperm is placed in the uterus and conception happens otherwise normally -- IVF involves combining eggs and sperm outside the body in a laboratory. Once an embryo or embryos form, they are placed in the uterus. IVF is a complex and expensive procedure; only about 5% of couples with infertility seek it out. However, since its introduction in the U.S. in 1981, 1.9% of all babies in the U.S. are bornÂ through IVF and other assistedÂ reproductive technologies (ART).Â\n\nIVF is never the first step in the treatment of infertility except in cases of complete tubal blockage. Instead, it's reserved for cases in which other methods such as fertility drugs, surgery, and artificial insemination haven't worked.\n\nIf you think that IVF might make sense for you, carefully assess any treatment center before undergoing the procedure. Here are some questions to ask the staff at the fertility clinic:\n\nWhat is your pregnancy ratio per embryo transfer?\n\nWhat is your pregnancy rate for couples in our age group and with our fertility problem?\n\nWhat is the live birth rate for all couples who undergo this procedure each year at your facility?\n\nHow many of those deliveries are twins or other multiple births?\n\nHow much will the procedure cost, including the cost of the hormone treatments?\n\nHow much does it cost to store embryos and how long can we store them?\n\nDo you participate in an egg donation program?\n\nWhat Can I Expect From IVF?\n\nThe first step in IVF involves injecting hormones so you produce multiple eggs each month instead of only one.You will then be tested to determine whether you're ready for egg retrieval.\n\nPrior to the retrieval procedure, you will be given injections of a medication that ripens the developing eggs and starts the process of ovulation. Timing is important; the eggs must be retrieved just before they emerge from the follicles in the ovaries. If the eggs are taken out too early or too late, they won't develop normally. Your doctor may do blood tests or an ultrasound to be sure the eggs are at the right stage of development before retrieving them. The IVF facility will provide you with special instructions to follow the night before and the day of the procedure. Most women are given pain medication and the choice of being mildly sedated or going under full anesthesia.\n\nDuring the procedure, your doctor will locate follicles in the ovary with ultrasound and remove the eggs with a hollow needle. The procedure usually takes less than 30 minutes, but may take up to an hour.\n\nImmediately following the retrieval, your eggs will be mixed in the laboratory with your partner's sperm, which they will have donated on the same day.\n\nWhile you and your partner go home, the fertilized eggs are kept in the clinic under observation to ensure optimal growth. Depending on the clinic, you may even wait up to five days until the embryo reaches a more advanced blastocyst stage.\n\nOnce the embryos are ready, you will return to the IVF facility so doctors can transfer one or more into your uterus. This procedure is quicker and easier than the retrieval of the egg. The doctor will insert a flexible tube called a catheter through your vagina and cervix and into your uterus, where the embryos will be deposited. To increase the chances of pregnancy, most IVF experts recommend transferring up to three embryos at a time. However, this means you could have a multiple pregnancy, which can increase the health risks for both you and the babies.\n\nFollowing the procedure, you would typically stay in bed for several hours and be discharged four to six hours later. Your doctor will probably perform a pregnancy test on you about two weeks after the embryo transfer.\n\nIn cases where the man's sperm count is extremely low or there is poor motility (movement of the sperm), doctors may combine IVF with a procedure called intracytoplasmic sperm injection. In this procedure, sperm is taken from semen -- or in some cases right from the testicles -- and inserted directly into the egg. Once a viable embryo is produced, it is transferred to the uterus using the usual IVF procedure.\n\nWhat Are the Success Rates for IVF?\n\nSuccess rates for IVF depend on a number of factors, including the reason for infertility, where you're having the procedure done, whether eggs are frozen or fresh, whether eggs are donated or are your own, and your age. The CDC compiles national statistics for all assisted reproductive technology procedures performed in the U.S., including IVF, GIFT, and ZIFT, although IVF is by far the most common; it accounts for 99% of the procedures.\n\nThe latest report, from 2018, shows that 50% of IVF procedures in women ages 35 and under resulted in a live birth. For women ages 42 and older, 3.9% of the egg transfers resulted in a birth.Â\n\nAre There Other Issues With IVF to Consider?\n\nAny embryos that you do not use in your first IVF attempt can be frozen for later use. This will save you money if you undergo IVF a second or third time. If you do not want your leftover embryos, you may donate them to another infertile couple, or you and your partner can ask the clinic to destroy the embryos. Both you and your partner must agree before the clinic will destroy or donate your embryos.\n\nA woman's age is a major factor in the success of IVF for any couple. For instance, a womanÂ under age 35 who used her own eggsÂ hadÂ a 37.6% chance of having a singleton (oneÂ baby) using IVFÂ in 2018, while a woman between ages 41 and 42 hadÂ an 11% chance. The success rate climbs with more egg transfers.\n\nThe CDC reports that the success rate of IVF is increasing in every age group as the techniques are refined and doctors become more experienced.\n\nWhat Are The Costs of IVF?\n\nThe average cost of an IVF cycle in the U.S.Â costs $12,000 to $17,000, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Â This price will vary depending on where you live, the amount of medications you're required to take, the number of IVF cycles you undergo, and the amount your insurance company will pay toward the procedure. You should thoroughly investigate your insurance company's coverage of IVF and ask for a written statement of your benefits. Although some states have enacted laws requiring insurance companies to cover at least some of the costs of infertility treatment, many states haven't.\n\nAlso be aware that some carriers will pay for infertility drugs and monitoring, but not for the cost of IVF or other artificial reproductive technology. Resolve: The National Infertility Association publishes a booklet called the \"Infertility Insurance Advisor,\" which provides tips on reviewing your insurance benefits contract."
