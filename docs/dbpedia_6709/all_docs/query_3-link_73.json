        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nIn common, most people are unsure about the relationship between IVF and test tube babies. They have several questions, like what is IVF and test tube baby? Are they the same? What are the processes during the treatments?\n\nAccording to recent research, about 10–15% of Indians have difficulty getting pregnant naturally. They visit fertility clinics to get pregnant through assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs).\n\nIn Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is the preferred method of ART suggested to patients who didn’t get pregnant from other ARTs. Read this article to learn all about IVF and test tube babies.\n\nDifference between IVF and Test Tube Baby\n\nAre IVF and test tube babies the same? The answer is yes. A test tube baby is a non-medical term used to refer to babies born through IVF procedures.\n\nWhen the IVF procedure was first developed, doctors termed it a “test-tube baby” because the babies were fertilized outside the uterus.\n\nThough the name has “test tube,” the sperm and eggs were fertilized in a petri dish.\n\nThe fertilized egg’s growth is monitored for 3–5 days and then transferred into the uterus to develop further and result in a successful pregnancy.\n\nOn July 25, 1978, Louise Joy Brown, the first test tube baby, was born. This was a major progress in the development of ARTs and has thus helped millions of people around the world.\n\nIVF Or Test Tube Baby Process\n\nThe procedure that patients should undergo during the IVF procedure is given below.\n\nOvarian stimulation\n\nThe ovaries naturally produce only one to two mature eggs every month during the menstrual cycle. Before IVF, a series of hormonal injections are administered to stimulate the ovaries and mature all eggs produced at once.\n\nThis will give more eggs for the doctors to collect and fertilize, thereby increasing the chances of a successful pregnancy.\n\nEgg & sperm retrieval\n\nWhen the eggs are matured, a tiny needle is injected into the ovaries through the vagina to collect them. The patients will receive mild anesthesia, so there is no need to be concerned about pain.\n\nOn the same day as egg retrieval, men’s sperm are collected in a lab container. They are then sent for a semen analysis to determine the count, motility, and quality of the sperm.\n\nFertilization and embryo culture\n\nThere are two ways to fertilize the eggs: traditional IVF and ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection).\n\ntraditional IVF treatment, the eggs are placed in a petri dish with thousands of sperm, where they are fertilized.\n\nDuring ICSI, a single, high-quality sperm is chosen and injected into the egg's cytoplasm. This procedure is typically used when the sperm cannot fertilize the eggs on its own.\n\nThe fertilized eggs are then observed for five to six days. On average, about 50 to 60 percent of fertilized eggs reach the blastocyst stage and are ready for embryo transfer.\n\nEmbryo transfer\n\nThis is the last step of the IVF procedure. Once the embryos reach the blastocyst stage, the best one or two among them are chosen and transferred into the uterus.\n\nThere are two types of embryo transfers:\n\nFresh embryo transfer, where the embryos are transferred into the uterus within 5–6 days of egg retrieval.\n\nFrozen embryo transfer, where the embryos are frozen and preserved for later use.\n\nPatients have the liberty to choose which type of embryo transfer they want. But most fertility clinics prefer frozen embryo transfer because it has about 15–20% higher chances of success than fresh embryo transfer.\n\nIs a test tube baby healthy?\n\nThis is one thing that worries parents the most. Will a test tube baby be as healthy as a naturally conceived baby?\n\nThe simple answer is yes. Test tube babies are no different than naturally conceived babies. They will be healthy and strong as a normal baby.\n\nThe main difference between a test tube baby and a normal baby is that test tube babies are born with external assistance from doctors. In contrast, normal babies are born through natural intercourse between a couple.\n\nEmbryos go through a lot of tests and analyses before they are transferred into the uterus. This prevents any disease or health conditions from being passed on from the parent to the infant.\n\nWho All Needs the IVF or Test Tube Baby Treatments?\n\nIVF is generally recommended for couples who can’t have a baby naturally or through other ARTs.\n\nOther reasons include fertility problems in men and women like\n\nblocked fallopian tubes,\n\nendometriosis,\n\nreduced fertility in men and women,\n\nuterine fibroids,\n\nazoospermia (low or no sperm count),\n\nerectile dysfunction, and\n\ngenetic conditions in parents.\n\nConclusion\n\nIVF is a painless yet complicated process. So, predicting whether a couple’s IVF treatment will be successful or unsuccessful is challenging. For some couples, a healthy baby can be delivered on the second or third IVF cycle.\n\nIt is best for patients to consult their fertility doctor and discuss what treatments they can undergo for their fertility issues. They can also consult counsellors to get through the emotional strains of IVF treatments.\n\nFAQs\n\nThe sole distinction between IVF and conventional methods is that with IVF, sperm and eggs are fertilized in a laboratory under the supervision of skilled medical professionals. Instead of the fallopian tube, sperm and eggs are fertilized in a petri dish.\n\nThough test tube babies have given new hope to infertile couples, they do have some disadvantages. Below are some of them.\n\nMultiple births. This happens when multiple embryos are transferred into the uterus during a single cycle.\n\nPremature delivery\n\nLow birth weight\n\nOvarian\n\nhyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)\n\nMiscarriage\n\nEctopic pregnancy\n\nThis solely depends on the eggs and sperm used during fertilization. If the eggs and sperm belong to the intended parents, then the baby born will look like them.\n\nIf donor eggs or sperm are used, the chances of the babies resembling their parents are low.\n\nWith in vitro fertilization, women in their 20s and 30s had the highest success rates. The oldest possible age for women is 50, while the oldest possible age for men is 55.\n\nDr. Geetha Haripriya\n\nDr. Geetha Haripriya is a renowned Obstetrician & Gynaecologist, specializing in reproductive medicine and laparoscopic surgery.
