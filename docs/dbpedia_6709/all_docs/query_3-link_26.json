        "text": "What is IVF?\n\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF) is a type of assisted reproductive technology (ART) where sperm and an egg are fertilized outside of the human body. IVF is a complex process that involves retrieving eggs from ovaries and manually combining them with sperm in a lab for fertilization. Several days after fertilization, the fertilized egg (now called an embryo) is placed inside a uterus. Pregnancy occurs when this embryo implants itself into the uterine wall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWhy is IVF performed?\n\nPeople choose IVF for many reasons, including infertility issues or when one partner has an existing health condition. Some people will try IVF after other fertility methods have failed or if they’re at an advanced maternal age. IVF is also a reproductive option for same-sex couples or people who wish to have a baby without a partner.\n\nIVF is an option if you or your partner has:\n\nBlocked or damaged fallopian tubes.\n\nEndometriosis.\n\nLow sperm count or other sperm impairments.\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other ovarian conditions.\n\nUterine fibroids.\n\nProblems with your uterus.\n\nRisk of passing on a genetic disease or disorder.\n\nUnexplained infertility.\n\nAre using an egg donor or a gestational surrogate.\n\nHow long is the IVF process from beginning to end?\n\nIVF is a complicated process with many steps. On average, you can expect the process to last four to six weeks. This includes the time before egg retrieval, when a person takes fertility medication until they’re tested for pregnancy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow common is IVF?\n\nApproximately 5% of couples with infertility will try IVF. More than 8 million babies have been born from IVF since 1978. It’s one of the most effective assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) available.\n\nWhat is the difference between IVF and IUI (intrauterine insemination)?\n\nIntrauterine insemination (IUI) is different from in vitro fertilization (IVF) because in an IUI procedure, fertilization occurs in a person’s body. A sperm sample is collected and washed so only high-quality sperm are left. This sample is inserted into your uterus with a catheter (thin tube) during ovulation. This method helps the sperm get to the egg more easily in hope that fertilization will happen.\n\nWith IVF, the sperm and egg are fertilized outside of your uterus (in a lab) and then placed in your uterus as an embryo.\n\nIUI is less expensive and less invasive than IVF. IUI has a lower success rate per cycle.\n\nWhat are the steps of IVF treatment?\n\nIVF can be broken down into the following steps:\n\nBirth control pills or estrogen\n\nBefore you start IVF treatment, your healthcare provider may prescribe birth control pills or estrogen. This is used to stop the development of ovarian cysts and control the timing of your menstrual cycle. It allows your healthcare provider to control your treatment and maximize the number of mature eggs during the egg retrieval procedure. Some people are prescribed combination birth control pills (estrogen and progesterone), while others are given just estrogen.\n\nOvarian stimulation\n\nDuring each natural cycle in a healthy person of reproductive age, a group of eggs begins to mature each month. Typically, only one egg becomes mature enough to ovulate. The remaining immature eggs in that group disintegrate.\n\nDuring your IVF cycle, you’ll take injectable hormone medications to encourage the entire group of that cycle’s eggs to mature simultaneously and fully. This means, instead of having just one egg (like in a natural cycle), you may have many eggs. The type, dosage and frequency of medications prescribed will be tailored to you as an individual based on your medical history, age, AMH (anti-mullerian hormone) level and your response to ovarian stimulation during previous IVF cycles.\n\nThe other steps in the ovarian stimulation process include:\n\nMonitoring: Your ovaries’ response to the medications is monitored by ultrasounds and blood hormone levels. Monitoring can occur daily or every few days over two weeks. Most stimulations last between eight and 14 days. At monitoring appointments, healthcare providers use ultrasound to look at your uterus and ovaries. The eggs themselves are too small to be visible with ultrasound. But, your healthcare providers will measure the size and number of growing ovarian follicles. Follicles are little sacks within your ovaries that should each contain a single egg. The size of each follicle indicates the maturity of the egg it contains. Most follicles greater than 14 millimeters (mm) contain a mature egg. The eggs contained within follicles less than 14 mm are more likely be immature and won’t fertilize.\n\nTrigger shot: When your eggs are ready for final maturation (determined by your ultrasound and hormone levels), a “trigger shot” is given to finalize the maturation of your eggs in preparation for egg retrieval. You’ll be instructed to administer the trigger shot exactly 36 hours before your scheduled egg retrieval time.\n\nEgg retrieval\n\nYour healthcare provider uses an ultrasound to guide a thin needle into each of your ovaries through your vagina. The needle is connected to a suction device used to pull your eggs out of each follicle.\n\nYour eggs are placed in a dish containing a special solution. The dish is then put in an incubator (controlled environment).\n\nMedication and mild sedation are used to reduce discomfort during this procedure.\n\nEgg retrieval is done 36 hours after your last hormone injection, the “trigger shot.”\n\nFertilization\n\nThe afternoon after your egg retrieval procedure, the embryologist will try to fertilize all mature eggs using intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI. This means that sperm will be injected into each mature egg. Immature eggs cannot have ICSI performed on them. The immature eggs will be placed in a dish with sperm and nutrients. Immature eggs rarely finish their maturation process in the dish. If an immature egg does mature, the sperm in the dish can then attempt to fertilize the egg.\n\nOn average, 70% of mature eggs will fertilize. For example, if 10 mature eggs are retrieved, about seven will fertilize. If successful, the fertilized egg will become an embryo.\n\nIf there are an exceedingly large number of eggs or you don’t want all eggs fertilized, some eggs may be frozen before fertilization for future use.\n\nEmbryo development\n\nOver the next five to six days, the development of your embryos will be carefully monitored.\n\nYour embryo must overcome significant hurdles to become an embryo suitable for transfer to your uterus. On average, 50% of fertilized embryos progress to the blastocyst stage. This is the stage most suitable for transfer to your uterus. For example, if seven eggs were fertilized, three or four of them might develop to the blastocyst stage. The remaining 50% typically fail to progress and are discarded.\n\nAll embryos suitable for transfer will be frozen on day five or six of fertilization to be used for future embryo transfers.\n\nEmbryo transfer\n\nThere are two kinds of embryo transfers: fresh embryo transfer and frozen embryo transfer. Your healthcare provider can discuss using fresh or frozen embryos with you and decide what’s best based on your unique situation. Both frozen and fresh embryo transfers follow the same transfer process. The main difference is implied by the name.\n\nA fresh embryo transfer means your embryo is inserted into your uterus between three and seven days after the egg retrieval procedure. This embryo hasn’t been frozen and is “fresh.”\n\nA frozen embryo transfer means that frozen embryos (from a previous IVF cycle or donor eggs) are thawed and inserted into your uterus. This is a more common practice for logistical reasons and because this method is more likely to result in a live birth. Frozen embryo transfers can occur years after egg retrieval and fertilization.\n\nAs part of the first step in a frozen embryo transfer, you’ll take oral, injectable, vaginal or transdermal hormones to prepare your uterus for accepting an embryo. Usually, this is 14 to 21 days of oral medication followed by six days of injections. Typically, you’ll have two or three appointments during this time to monitor the readiness of your uterus with ultrasound and to measure your hormone levels with a blood test. When your uterus is ready, you’ll be scheduled for the embryo transfer procedure.\n\nThe process is similar if you’re using fresh embryos, except embryo transfer happens within three to five days of being retrieved.\n\nThe embryo transfer is a simple procedure that doesn’t require anesthesia. It feels similar to a pelvic exam or Pap smear. A speculum is placed within the vagina, and a thin catheter is inserted through the cervix into the uterus. A syringe attached to the other end of the catheter contains one or more embryos. The embryos are injected it the uterus through the catheter. The procedure typically takes less than 10 minutes.\n\nPregnancy\n\nPregnancy occurs when the embryo implants itself into the lining of your uterus. Your healthcare provider will use a blood test to determine if you’re pregnant approximately nine to 14 days after embryo transfer.\n\nIf donor eggs are being used, the same steps are taken. The egg donor will complete ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval. After fertilization takes place, the embryo is transferred to the person who intends to carry the pregnancy (either with or without various fertility medications).\n\nThere are many factors to take into consideration before starting IVF treatment. To get the best understanding of the IVF process and what to expect, it’s important to consult with your healthcare provider.\n\nWhat do you do to prepare for IVF treatment?\n\nBefore starting IVF treatment, you’ll need a thorough medical exam and fertility tests. Your partner will be examined and tested as well. Some of the preparation you’ll go through includes:\n\nIVF consultation (meet with healthcare providers to discuss the details of the IVF process).\n\nA uterine exam, up-to-date Pap test and mammogram (if over 40).\n\nA semen analysis.\n\nScreening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other infectious diseases.\n\nOvarian reserve testing, and blood and urine tests.\n\nInstructions on how to administer fertility medications.\n\nGenetic carrier screening.\n\nSign consent forms.\n\nUterine cavity evaluation (hysteroscopy or saline-infused sonography (SIS)).\n\nYour healthcare provider will have you start supplementing with folic acid at least three months before embryo transfer.\n\nWhat can you expect after IVF treatment?\n\nThere are some mild symptoms that you can experience after embryo transfer:\n\nMild bloating and cramping.\n\nBreast tenderness from high estrogen levels.\n\nSpotting.\n\nConstipation.\n\nMany people will return to normal activities right after their egg retrieval procedure. However, you shouldn’t drive for 24 hours after having anesthesia. Around nine to 14 days after the embryos are transferred, you’ll return to the clinic for a pregnancy test using a blood sample.\n\nHow do IVF injections work?\n\nDuring your IVF cycle, you’ll take injectable hormone medications to encourage the entire group of that cycle’s eggs to mature simultaneously and fully. Your healthcare provider will determine the type of drug, frequency and dosages you need for your treatment. This is based on your age, medical history, hormone levels and your response to previous IVF cycles if applicable. You can expect to inject fertility medicine for around eight to 14 days.\n\nWhat medications are used for IVF?\n\nSeveral medications can be used during a cycle of IVF. Some are taken orally, while others are injected, absorbed through your skin or placed in your vagina. Your healthcare provider will outline the exact dosage and timing depending on your treatment plan.\n\nDuring the ovarian stimulation phase, you can expect to be given injectable hormones:\n\nFollicle stimulating hormone (FSH): These hormones work to stimulate your ovaries to produce eggs. You may be given one or a combination of both during your treatment. This is done for approximately right to 14 days.\n\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG): Usually given as one final shot to trigger your eggs to mature and set ovulation in motion.\n\nLeuprolide acetate: A type of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (initiates a response) that’s given as an injection. It can help control the stimulation process or be used as a trigger shot.\n\nYou may be prescribed birth control pills or injections before starting IVF. This provides a level of control over your cycle and allows all of your eggs to start simultaneously. Most people are given estrogen supplements to take before and after embryo transfer. This hormone helps thicken the lining of their uterus. Progesterone is also added to improve the chances of an embryo implanting and growing into a successful pregnancy. Most continue this throughout their first trimester. These medications are either oral, injectable, transdermal or vaginal.\n\nWhat is assisted hatching in IVF?\n\nAssisted hatching is a technique used in IVF treatment. It involves making a hole in your embryo’s outer shell before embryo transfer into your uterus. This hole helps your embryo “hatch” from its outer shell more easily. To get pregnant, your embryo must hatch and attach to the lining of your uterus. Think of assisted hatching like giving your embryo a head start and increasing its chances of hatching and implanting in your uterus. Assisted hatching is used primarily for those who’ve had several failed IVF cycles.\n\nHow much does IVF cost?\n\nThe average cost of an IVF cycle in the United States is $15,000. This doesn’t include the cost of medication, which can cost approximately $5,000 per cycle. It’s hard to give an exact amount because the cost depends on your health history and plan for treatment, insurance coverage (certain states may cover treatment) and the treatment center itself."
