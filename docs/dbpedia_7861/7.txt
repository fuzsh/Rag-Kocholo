BROOMFIELD, Colo. – Olivia Newton-John is set to host a benefit concert celebrating the late John Denver as he becomes the first inductee of the Colorado Music Hall of Fame on April 21.

Newton-John, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Lee Ann Womack and John Oates are among those scheduled to perform at the concert, which will be held in the Denver suburb of Broomfield. Newton-John sang backing vocals on his 1975 song “Fly Away.”

Composer Lee Holdridge will lead the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra in a tribute performance, and some of Denver’s hits will be performed by collaborators Bill Danoff, who co-wrote “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” and John Sommers, who wrote “Thank God I’m A Country Boy.”

Denver, who owned a home in the Aspen area, died in 1997 when the experimental aircraft he was flying crashed into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.

Some proceeds from the concert will benefit the Cousteau Society, Windstar Foundation and the University of Colorado’s music school.
