        "text": "I'll disagree with that assessment. I like JD but he was an outsider and that was the way he was treated. I watched Charlie Rich burn that card when it happened. He was drunk and pissed off. The ironic thing to me is that of all people to be upset it was Rich, an artist that wasn't a traditionalist in any way shape or form who could have been accused of selling out country himself. Also I think Stuart's early career is very important to cover as seen by how things concluded in the final episode. And ELH is another of those artists that serve as links to weave the story together. Her importance can't be underestimated. I think her story was very important to tell. Campbell I can see the need to tell more about but Kenny, is a good example of country pop that was told by others. He wasn't essential in my view.\n\nThe thing to me is that the documentary when looked at as one not 8 did a great job telling the story of Country Music. Often the complaints people have expressed after a particular episode were resolved in a later episode.\n\nI didn't get that at all from the 2nd episode that featured Dolly, the first yes. Heck he did a lot for Dolly. He gave her a job, produced her, encouraged her to write, actually recorded her songs etc. He was her boss and sure he could be heavy handed, but he wasn't the bad guy. He did let her go without suing her. I'm sure there were contracts and arrangements had to be renegotiated and those can cause a lot of conflict. But Dolly seemed gracious and appreciative of what Porter did for her. Oh and rumor has it that he literally was what you called him. There is a story about George Jones attacking him while he is taking a leak at the Opry one time because he thinks he is running around with Tammy and he can't match his size!\n\nGeorge Hamilton IV is from Winston-Salem ...............................North Carolina.\n\nI love a good conspiracy theory.\n\nI watched it happen live too and as a huge fan of Charlie Rich, it was no great surprise when his wife Margaret Ann filed divorce papers the following day. Charlie was having a meltdown of sorts and was obviously drunk and probably mixed it with pain pills as well, according to his son, Charlie Rich Jr., who has vehemently argued on his own website that his father felt horrible about the whole incident and tried to track John Denver down when he was in Aspen one time in order to apologize and explain the whole incident. Charlie was sort of rejecting the international superstardom that enveloped him after so many years of struggle with a very up and down career and a bout with alcoholism. Margaret Ann quickly withdrew the divorce proceedings and of course they remained with each until the day he passed away. Here is Charlie Rich Jr.'s own quote from his website regarding how his father felt must have felt about the surrounding controversy:\n\n\"For those of you that assume Charlie thought John wasn't country enough, I'm sorry but I disagree. If you feel that way fine, but that wasn't my father's general point of view. Anybody that knows much about the history of my father will know that it wasn't in his mind set to judge someone for not being \"country enough\", \"blues enough\", or \"anything enough\". It went against his philosophy. He started out as a rockabilly, then did R&B for several years, then he migrated to Jazz, and finally to country. For years people said my father wasn't country enough.\"\n\nAs someone said earlier on the doc, it is the Music \"business\"! Porter shouldn't be made out to be a \"dick\" because he was basically Dolly's boss and there were contractual obligations that she either had to honor or had to renegotiate with Porter having the leverage. Everybody loves, Dolly, I love Dolly. I can't stand her pop music but who can't love her. When everybody loves Dolly I guess someone has to be the bad guy but that isn't fair to Porter."
