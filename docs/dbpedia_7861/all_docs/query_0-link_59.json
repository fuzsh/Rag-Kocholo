        "text": "Beyoncé's game-changing “visual albums” — her eponymous 2013 effort and 2016's “Lemonade” — sent the music industry into a frenzy. While Queen Bey's releases qualify as pop-culture milestones, the concept of setting an entire album to video was not revolutionary: three decades prior, Olivia Newton-John got visual for 1981's multi-platinum “Physical.”\n\nNewton-John, set to perform Thursday at the State Theatre in Easton, filmed clips for all 10 “Physical” tracks. In the pre-MTV era — the music channel debuted in August 1981 — the British-born, Australian-bred singer/actress shot videos for 1978's “Totally Hot” album, and starred in the big-screen musicals “Grease” and “Xanadu.” However, it was the home video “Olivia: Physical,” with its mix of performance and plot-driven clips, that broke ground in the medium of music video.\n\n“I had the idea, along with the director, to do a whole album on video, the first one,” Newton-John said. “I particularly like all the ones on that album.”\n\nDirector Brian Grant helmed each “Physical” video, though it was the monster title cut — at 10 weeks, the longest reign atop Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart in the 1980s — that had the most impact. Newton-John immediately recognized the song's potential, even if the racy lyrics — among them, “There's nothing left to talk about, unless it's horizontally…” — raised concerns for the singer.\n\n“I thought it was very catchy, commercial. I recorded it and then I had a panic attack. I said, ‘I'm not sure about this song. Let's do a video and make it about exercise.’ Of course, it took it to a whole other level. The director did an amazing job.”\n\nNewton-John, Grant recalled, “came up with the notion of setting it in a gymnasium. The idea was to play on the word ‘physical’ and not illuminate the seductive meaning of the lyrics. She spends most of the video getting fat men into shape and turning them into gorgeous, hunky men. Adding the twist in which they all turn out to be gay was a way of undercutting expectation, whilst keeping the humor in the piece.”\n\nWith the hunks only into each other — a move that likely cemented Newton-John's loyal gay following, with the singer just as devoted, playing pride events and supporting marriage equality — Newton-John's left with the last “fatty.” The singer, who laughed when discussing the video's ending, later updated “Physical” for a 2010 episode of Fox's “Glee.”\n\nMore than ‘Physical’\n\n“Olivia: Physical,” which won the second-ever Grammy for Video of the Year, also featured the singles “Make a Move on Me” and “Landslide.” Two other clips showcased Newton-John's passion for environmental and animal-rights issues. In “Silvery Rain,” she emerges from a protective bubble to see ill children and polluted water, a result of aerial application of pesticides, and in the video for the self-penned “The Promise (The Dolphin Song),” the singer swims with the aquatic mammals.\n\n“I care; I care a lot for animals,” Newton-John said. “I've always been trying to advocate for many things I do. I protested to stop the killing of dolphins in Japan many years ago.”\n\nBeyond “Olivia: Physical,” Newton-John revisited environmental issues in her later work. For the late-'80s “Olivia Down Under” TV special, Grant and Newton-John shot a clip for “Let's Talk About Tomorrow,” which examines the state of the planet.\n\nGrant, who shot nearly 200 music videos, thinks Newton-John deserves more credit for her video work.\n\n“She was in the vanguard of artists who embraced the brand-new world of music video. Given how unknown it was and how much we were all learning, I think she was very adventurous. She always allowed me to experiment, and actively encouraged a bold approach. Olivia was considered a mainstream artist and therefore the perception was that she was not likely to take risks. That early work signaled to other artists what the possibilities were and I think that success definitely influenced many of them.”\n\nVeteran pop-music journalist Paul Grein, who writes the Chart Watch blog for Yahoo.com, believes Newton-John's global profile heightened her video appeal.\n\n“Olivia was a real trendsetter in the music-video world, probably because she was an international artist — videos were big in the international market before they became important in the U.S. I don't think Olivia gets her due as a video pioneer. I don't think many people are aware that she had a video album 34 years before Beyoncé did much the same thing with ‘Lemonade.’”\n\nThough “Physical” may be her video opus — the clip, part of the early-'80s fitness craze, also helped popularize gym wear as casual attire — Newton-John reflects fondly on other videos, including the Grant-directed “‘Shaking You,” shot on the streets of Venice, and “Livin' in Desperate Times,” filmed in the London fog. “They're all different little movies,” Newton-John said, adding that “I laugh now, as we all do” looking back at the 1980s hairdos.\n\nCountry to pop\n\nEven before “Physical,” Newton-John helped shape music trends. Five of her early cross-genre hits, including “Let Me Be There” and “If You Love Me (Let Me Know),” cracked the top 10 on both the Billboard Country and Hot 100 singles charts. The songs helped set the pace for 1970s crossover acts, not to mention the likes of Shania Twain, who acknowledged Newton-John as a crossover influence in her 2011 biography “From This Moment On,” plus Faith Hill and Taylor Swift.\n\n“I think Olivia had a big impact in helping take down the wall that separated pop from country,” Grein said. “Country isn't as isolated from other genres as it was before Olivia and such other country/pop crossover artists as John Denver and Glen Campbell.”\n\nElysa Gardner, former music writer for Rolling Stone and USA Today, enjoyed Newton-John country ballads like “I Honestly Love You” and “Please Mr. Please” during her youth in suburban New York. “Olivia Newton-John was as close to country as I got,” she said. “She didn't have the kind of power a Faith Hill/Reba McEntire/Martina McBride had, but she was an early example of someone who found an audience in country, crossing over into pop easily and having a strong feminine presence. A womanly presence, that's maybe more important overall in country than it is in rock and roll.”\n\nNewton-John's brand of country-pop also left an impression on recording artist Chely Wright. “I used to sing all of her country hits in my country band when I was a kid. Then, she and I became friends when we were both on MCA Records. She just keeps getting better, if that's even possible.”\n\nNewton-John's country success — which also included Academy of Country Music, Country Music Association and Grammy awards, among others — angered country purists. In Craig Rosen's “The Billboard Book of Number One Albums,” Newton-John broke down the Nashville controversy: She was Australian, performing country music she didn't write, with production by an Englishman, Bruce Welch, and an Australian, songwriter-producer John Farrar. Newton-John heard about the fuss much later, which was fine, as she told Rosen “it would have been upsetting to me. I don't like people to think badly of me when I didn't do anything wrong.”\n\n‘Let me hear your body talk’\n\nAside from impacting music videos and country-pop, Newton-John — thanks to “Grease” girl-next-door-turned-spandex-and-leather-clad Sandy Olsson — also became a sex symbol. Grein, who wrote the liner notes for Newton-John's 2005 “Gold” compilation, believes she helped pave the way for female artists to express their sexuality in the “B.M. (Before Madonna)” era.\n\n“Olivia was one of the first female artists to be frank about sex,” he said. “Her '70s peers, singers like Karen Carpenter, Helen Reddy and Anne Murray, sang love songs, but almost never sang songs that were sexual in nature. They certainly never put out a record like ‘Physical.’ That was a risk in 1981. The record seems tame now, but at the time it pushed the envelope. I think it helped pave the way for Madonna, whose first No. 1 hit, ‘Like a Virgin,’ came out three years later.”\n\nWhile Madonna was a first-year-eligible inductee into the U.S. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame — tirelessly challenging society's views on gender, politics, race and sexuality — Newton-John has yet to be nominated, possibly because she was not, by nature, a button-pushing, in-your-face artist. Gardner believes her beauty, poise, and pure, light soprano voice stood in contrast to rock-and-roll ideology.\n\n“She never really had that rebel image. That may be why Sandy in ‘Grease’ was such a breakthrough role for her. She was so wholesome and girlish, and then she proved she could turn that around and be sassier and stronger.”\n\nGardner added that “there was a softness, sweetness about Olivia that I think limited the extent to what she could really be. She was almost like a princess. Olivia resonated with me how Barbie resonated with little girls. As I got older, I came to see her as more. I understood how much power she brought to those songs, by not oversinging them and being true to the lyrics.\n\n“So many pop singers today would do well to study her discretion, tenderness, gentle warmth,” Gardner continued. “There can be power in that subtlety. With all the voice contests, everybody's so drunk on melisma. She was the antithesis of that.”\n\n‘Liv On’\n\nWhile Newton-John may not have intended to become a music icon and sex symbol, the singer has clear aspirations for her current album. “Liv On,” a collaborative effort with Beth Nielsen Chapman and Amy Sky, features songs to help anyone grieving or working toward health and recovery.\n\n“Liv On,” which Newton-John calls “an album of love,” may help the singer on her own healing journey; in 2013, older sister Rona succumbed to brain cancer. Newton-John has faced trying times before: in 1992, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Right after her diagnosis, she started writing songs; she released the resulting album, “Gaia: One Woman's Journey,” in 1994.\n\n“The experience inspired me. I had always written songs, one to two tracks on an album, but I was surrounded by so many talented musicians. I had great singer-songwriters around me. Being in Australia, by myself, the songs just came through me.”\n\nThe cancer survivor, who prefers the word “thriver,” continues to promote the importance of early detection. Her endeavors include Liv Aid, a self-examination tool, and the Olivia Newton-John Cancer & Wellness Centre, and the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute, which opened in 2012 and 2014, respectively, in Melbourne.\n\nGrein stresses his respect for Newton-John, noting that “she's been up and down, hot and cold. It's not easy to be an entertainer, with the demands and pressures. We've seen many performers who couldn't handle it. So just for surviving, I give her a lot of credit. And Olivia has had her share of problems, from a bout with cancer to the strange disappearance of a boyfriend. She doesn't feel sorry for herself or crumble in adversity. She keeps going.”\n\nThough “Liv On” comes as the latest in a handful of new-age recordings, Newton-John will not settle into a musical box. After her trio album, “I did a Christmas record with John Farnham in Australia that was a big success. I never limit myself. I never know what's going to happen.”\n\nIn December, Newton-John concluded her 2014-2016 residency, “Summer Nights,” at the Flamingo Las Vegas. After her current series of concerts, the singer, who resides in Southern California and has a farm in Melbourne, has no definitive plans regarding the next phase of her career.\n\n“I don't know yet. I'm going to take a little more time off. I'm thinking of holidays, playing with my horses, dogs, chickens and cats.”\n\nLegacy, music and beyond\n\nWith Newton-John's future music plans unknown, the singer-songwriter — inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association Hall of Fame in 2002 — reflected on a catalog that includes nearly 30 studio albums. She chose one song, written with Sky, to represent her, artistically and personally.\n\n“One I'd like to be remembered for is ‘Grace and Gratitude.’ It's an anthem, and also on ‘Liv On.’ It's a thank you for life, everything.” Newton-John also has gratitude for longtime collaborator Farrar, who's “written the most beautiful songs of my career,” including “Have You Never Been Mellow” and “Don't Stop Believin',” among others. Some of those Farrar songs, along with other hits, will feature in Thursday's concert.\n\nWith some 45 years of stardom — which includes highlights like “Grease” and performing at the 2000 Sydney Olympics — Newton-John believes her legacy extends beyond entertainment.\n\n“My cancer and wellness center will be my legacy,” she said. “I want to see an end to cancer, alternate ways to treating cancer. Not just treatment for the body, but to help the whole person through, bringing programs to people to help heal them, body and mind. I feel if you can help, if your name helps draw attention to things ... I'm not an expert, but I can help with that, and it's important to give back. I'm sure I got that from my mother.”\n\nRead about Olivia Newton-John's legacy as the 'Soundtracks Queen'.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: On May 30, 2017, Newton-John postponed her June U.S. and Canadian concert-tour dates. The back pain that initially caused her to postpone the first half of her tour turned out to be breast cancer that metastasized to the sacrum. The singer, who instantly embarked on a cancer-to-wellness journey, returned to performing just a few months later.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nAn Evening with Olivia Newton-John\n\nWHEN: 7:30 p.m. Thursday\n\nWHERE: State Theatre, 453 Northampton St., Easton\n\nCOST: $67 and $57\n\nINFORMATION: 800-999-7828, 610-252-3132, statetheatre.org\n\nKEY NOTES: Olivia Newton-John\n\nBorn: 1948, Cambridge, England; raised in Melbourne, Australia\n\nFamily ties: Youngest child of Brinley Newton-John, a professor, and Irene, daughter of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Max Born; sister of Hugh and Rona; mother of Chloe Rose Lattanzi; wife, since 2008, of Amazon Herb Co. founder “Amazon John” Easterling\n\nInfluences: Dionne Warwick, Cilla Black, Joan Baez, Ray Charles, Dusty Springfield\n\nRoad to stardom: Won a trip to London on the 1960s Australian TV series “Sing, Sing, Sing”; member of girl group Sol Four and the duo Pat & Olivia; musical films “Funny Things Happen Down Under” (1965) and “Toomorrow” (1970)\n\nFirst album: “If Not For You” (1971); the title track, a Bob Dylan cover, was her first of 27 top 40 singles on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, with 15 going top 10 and five hitting No. 1.
