        "text": "The best 70s songs? It’s an impossible task, surely. There was simply too much going on throughout the world to accurately reflect the best music of the 70s. That said, we’ve done our best in this introduction to the decade.\n\nWe’ve chosen to separate things into a variety of loose genre categories and to limit things to one song per artist, just so we could include as many different folks as possible. As you’ll see below, there was an enormous amount of great music being produced, so take this list as a starting point for future exploration. The best songs of the 70s do the same, pointing the way to music and art that demands your attention.\n\nBuild your 70s music collection on vinyl with classic titles and under–the–radar favorites.\n\nRock\n\nIt’s kind of hard to believe, but rock was nearly two decades old by the time the 70s rolled around, which meant that things had come a long way from “Rocket 88.” The elements that made it great, however, remained much the same: Electric guitars and a love of the blues underpinned so much of what Eric Clapton, Janis Joplin, The Rolling Stones, and many others had to say. As the decade progressed, however, rock ‘n’ roll began to see more and more influences seep in. Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” and Electric Light Orchestra’s “Mr. Blue Sky” borrowed liberally from classical and opera. But while the leading lights of rock music’s early 70s contingent would continue to expand their horizons, things usually came back to a core type: Great songs about the fragility of human relationships. Whether it’s Lindsey Buckingham’s “Go Your Own Way” from Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours or Bruce Springsteen’s “Born to Run,” the 70s saw some of the best rock songs of the genre’s history.\n\nThe Kinks – Lola\n\nJanis Joplin – Me and Bobby McGee\n\nRod Stewart – Maggie May\n\nDerek & The Dominos – Layla\n\nEric Clapton – Cocaine\n\nThe Rolling Stones – Brown Sugar\n\nThree Dog Night – Joy to the World\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash, & Young – Ohio\n\nBruce Springsteen – Born to Run\n\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers – American Girl\n\nThe Velvet Underground – Sweet Jane\n\nNeil Young – Heart of Gold\n\nPink Floyd – Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2\n\nWings – Band on the Run\n\nThe Beatles – Let It Be\n\nFleetwood Mac – Go Your Own Way\n\nQueen – Bohemian Rhapsody\n\nThe Doobie Brothers – What a Fool Believes\n\nElectric Light Orchestra – Mr. Blue Sky\n\nThe Beach Boys – Surf’s Up\n\nThe Jam – The Eton Rifles\n\nMusic from Africa\n\nThere had already been incredibly popular music coming from Africa for decades, but the 70s saw a few singular artists emerge that would have an enormous impact. Fela Kuti pioneered Afrobeat with legendary drummer Tony Allen, while Mulatu Astatke mixed jazz, Latin music, and his native Ethiopian sounds into a complete unique concoction. Perhaps the most far-reaching song of all, however, was Manu Dibango’s “Soul Makossa,” which has since been interpolated by Michael Jackson and Rihanna in various forms.\n\nFela Kuti & Africa 70 – Zombie\n\nLadysmith Black Mambazo – Hello My Baby\n\nOrchestre Poly–Rythmo De Cotonou – It’s a Vanity\n\nWilliam Onyeabor – Atomic Bomb\n\nMulatu Astatke – Mulatu\n\nLijadu Sisters – Come On Home\n\nEbo Taylor – Heaven\n\nAmara Toure – El Carretero\n\nBembeya Jazz National – Petit Sekou\n\nManu Dibango – Soul Makossa\n\nAOR (Album/Adult Oriented Rock)\n\nPeople often mistake softness for weakness. Listen to “Big Yellow Taxi” or “Deacon Blues,” however, and you’ll understand that plenty of the best 70s AOR music has a bite to it. The songs below often showcase the complexity of love, whether it be the banquet of Patti Smith’s “Because the Night” or the attention-seeking Pretenders. But perhaps the most famous song of all was an ode to rock ‘n’ roll heroes, Don McLean’s “American Pie.”\n\nEagles – Hotel California\n\nChicago – If You Leave Me Now\n\nJames Taylor – Fire and Rain\n\nPatti Smith – Because The Night\n\nDon McLean – American Pie\n\nThe Pretenders – Brass In Pocket\n\nJoni Mitchell – Big Yellow Taxi\n\nDebby Boone – You Light Up My Life\n\nThe Commodores – Three Times a Lady\n\nTony Orlando & Dawn – Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round The Ole Oak Tree\n\nThe Carpenters – (They Long To Be) Close To You\n\nSteely Dan – Deacon Blues\n\nVan Morrison – Moondance\n\nJim Croce – Bad, Bad Leroy Brown\n\nTodd Rundgren – Hello It’s Me\n\nCheck out our playlist of the best 70s music on Spotify.\n\nFunk\n\nIt’s hard to imagine a more vital genre in the 70s than funk. Songs from Black artists all over the United States were busy soundtracking dance floors the world over. The intent was often simply to make folks move: “Haven’t You Heard,” “Boogie Oogie Oogie,” and just about everything James Brown put to wax, for instance. But just as much music was intent on saying something about the world we lived in. “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.” “War.” “For the Love of Money.” The best funk songs of the 70s often did both. And, as the decade rolled to a conclusion, there was one song that signaled the beginning of something new that would slowly conquer the world: “Rapper’s Delight.”\n\nIsaac Hayes – Theme From Shaft\n\nThe Brothers Johnson – Strawberry Letter 23\n\nRoy Ayers Ubiquity – Everybody Loves the Sunshine\n\nEdwin Starr – War\n\nKool & the Gang – Summer Madness\n\nBetty Davis – They Say I’m Different\n\nWar – Low Rider\n\nWild Cherry – Play That Funky Music\n\nGil Scott–Heron – The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\n\nFunkadelic – Maggot Brain\n\nPatrice Rushen – Haven’t You Heard\n\nA Taste of Honey – Boogie Oogie Oogie\n\nParliament – Flash Light\n\nKC & The Sunshine Band – Get Down Tonight\n\nThe Staple Singers – I’ll Take You There\n\nMandrill – Fencewalk\n\nSly And The Family Stone – Family Affair\n\nThe Isley Brothers – That Lady\n\nThe O’Jays – For the Love of Money\n\nJames Brown – Get Up Offa That Thing\n\nMichael Jackson – Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough\n\nStevie Wonder – Superstition\n\nCurtis Mayfield – Move On Up\n\nThe Temptations – Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone\n\nSugarhill Gang – Rapper’s Delight\n\nPunk\n\nPunk, in the popular imagination, swept away everything bloated and old before it. It’s not quite as simple as that, but it likely felt that way during the last few years of the 70s. How else to explain the vital energy that produced “God Save the Queen” and “Blitzkrieg Bop”? What’s often lost in all of that talk about punk is the musicianship of some of its earliest stars. You’d be hard-pressed to find guitar playing more beautiful than Television’s “Marquee Moon” or more ferocious than The Stooges’ “Search and Destroy.”\n\nThe Clash – London Calling\n\nSex Pistols – God Save The Queen\n\nNew York Dolls – Personality Crisis\n\nThe Ramones – Blitzkrieg Bop\n\nRichard Hell and the Voidoids – Blank Generation\n\nTelevision – Marquee Moon\n\nBuzzcocks – Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn’t’ve)\n\nThe Cramps – Human Fly\n\nThe Stooges – Search and Destroy\n\nBlack Flag – Nervous Breakdown\n\nMusic from Brazil\n\nThe seismic impact of the Tropicália movement hung over Brazil’s musical output in the 70s. Artists were either continuing to build on its revolutionary fervor or trying to build something different in its wake. Tropicália artists like Gal Costa and Caetano Veloso released some of their best songs in the 70s. Tim Maia and Erasmo Carlos, meanwhile, had been making music for many years by the time the 70s rolled around, but truly started to hit their stride.\n\nGal Costa – Pontos De Luz\n\nTim Maia – Réu Confesso\n\nCaetano Veloso – You Don’t Know Me\n\nErasmo Carlos – Gente Aberta\n\nJorge Ben Jor – Taj Mahal\n\nMilton Nascimento – Tudo Que Você Podia Ser\n\nNew Wave / Power Pop\n\nThe best New Wave and power pop artists in the 70s wrote songs that simply didn’t quite fit into the established narratives of the decade. Many of these artists embraced technology in unconventional ways. (Gary Numan, 10cc, and Blondie were all at the cutting–edge in terms of sound.) But just as many were simply exceptional at the craft of writing songs, Elvis Costello, Big Star, and The Cure among them.\n\nElvis Costello – Alison\n\nBlondie – Heart Of Glass\n\nMarianne Faithfull – Broken English\n\nThe B–52’s – Rock Lobster\n\nTalking Heads – Psycho Killer\n\nThe Cure – Boys Don’t Cry\n\n10cc – I’m Not in Love\n\nGary Numan – Cars\n\nXTC – Making Plans For Nigel\n\nSqueeze – Up The Junction\n\nThe Knack – My Sharona\n\nBig Star – September Gurls\n\nJazz\n\nJazz was a many splendored thing throughout the 70s. The best songs, however, found artists stretching at the confines of the genre, pressing forward into uncharted territory. Alice Coltrane, Miles Davis, and Don Cherry all pushed things in strange, exciting new directions. Some jazz got cosmic, other folks used music as a vehicle for protest. One of the major genres to emerge was the sometimes–abstract sounds of jazz fusion. But just as many artists embraced pop music, like George Benson and Donald Byrd. And then there was the best–selling piano recording of all–time, a solo concert by Keith Jarrett. In short, there was something for just about everyone when it comes to jazz in the 70s.\n\nMiles Davis – Pharaoh’s Dance\n\nAlice Coltrane – Journey in Satchidananda\n\nDon Cherry – Brown Rice\n\nSun Ra – Door of the Cosmos\n\nPharoah Sanders – Black Unity\n\nArchie Shepp – Attica Blues\n\nKeith Jarrett – The Köln Concert, Pt. 1\n\nHerbie Hancock – Chameleon\n\nFreddie Hubbard – Red Clay\n\nJaco Pastorius – Donna Lee\n\nPat Metheny – Bright Size Life\n\nMahavishnu Orchestra – You Know, Know\n\nWeather Report – Birdland\n\nGeorge Benson – Breezin’\n\nBobbi Humphrey – Harlem River Drive\n\nDonald Byrd – Where Are We Going?\n\nPost-Punk\n\nWhere do you go when you feel like everything has been destroyed? Even further out, seemingly, in the case of post-punk artists like Suicide, Throbbing Gristle, and The Slits. The best post-punk songs of the 70s threw away all the rules and emerged with some of the most vital music of the decade. Perhaps just as important, it was some of the most inspiring music of the decade. More than a few folks that listened to Delta 5’s “Mind Your Own Business” went out and formed their own band.\n\nBauhaus – Bela Lugosi’s Dead\n\nJoy Division – Transmission\n\nGang Of Four – Damaged Goods\n\nIggy Pop – Lust For Life\n\nThe Slits – Typical Girls\n\nSuicide – Ghost Rider\n\nThrobbing Gristle – Hot on the Heels of Love\n\nDelta 5 – Mind Your Own Business\n\nBrian Eno – Needles In The Camel’s Eye\n\nMusic from and inspired by Jamaica\n\nThe influence of Jamaica on popular music is hard to overstate. The 70s is the decade that some of the best songs from the island had a massive international impact, like Jimmy Cliff’s The Harder They Come and Bob Marley’s “Three Little Birds.” On the island itself, Lee Perry was pioneering dub techniques, helping to bring together The Congos’ masterful “Fisherman.”\n\nJunior Murvin – Police & Thieves\n\nToots and the Maytals – Funky Kingston\n\nThe Abyssinians – Satta Massagana\n\nLee Perry & the Full Experiences – Disco Devil\n\nThe Congos – Fisherman\n\nAlthea & Donna – Uptown Top Ranking\n\nBob Marley & The Wailers – Three Little Birds\n\nDillinger – Cokane in My Brain\n\nJimmy Cliff – The Harder They Come\n\nMusic from Japan\n\nMusic from Japan in the 1970s proved just how far and wide rock music from America and the UK had spread in the 1960s. Groups like RC Succession became massively popular in Japan as they interpreted the genre through the music they grew up listening to. The Sadistic Mika Band churned out classic rock-influenced pop jams and even styled their band name as a play on the Plastic Ono Band. Pop acts like Yumi Ari and the mononymous Alice proved that pop music had a home in places outside of the US and UK, while Kaientai grew to be one of the biggest bands in the country thanks to their brilliant blend of traditional Japanese melodies and modern instrumentation.\n\nRC Succession – Slow Ballad\n\nKai Band – HERO\n\nSadistic Mika Band – Time machine ni onegai\n\nYumi Arai – Vapor Trail\n\nOFF COURSE – Sayonara\n\nAlice – Fuyuno Inazuma\n\nHiroko Yakushimaru – Main Theme\n\nKaientai – Okuru Kotoba\n\nYosui Inoue – Yumeno Nakae\n\nYellow Magic Orchestra – Firecracker\n\nCountry / Folk\n\nCountry music was truly hitting the national stage throughout the 70s. The best songs from the genre led the breakthrough, with Dolly Parton’s “Jolene” and Loretta Lynn’s “Coal Miner’s Daughter” among them. Underneath the surface of the mainstream industry, the outlaw country movement was beginning to surface, with Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings ensuring that mammas would never feel comfortable letting their babies grow up to be cowboys. Elsewhere, experiments with country and folk sounds continued, with Leo Kottke and John Fahey proving just how strange and wonderful the guitar could sound.\n\nConway Twitty – Hello Darlin\n\nCrystal Gayle – Don’t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\n\nDon Williams – Tulsa Time\n\nJohn Denver – Take Me Home Country Roads\n\nGlen Campbell – Rhinestone Cowboy\n\nKenny Rogers – The Gambler\n\nLoretta Lynn – Coal Miner’s Daughter\n\nDolly Parton – Jolene\n\nWillie Nelson and Waylon Jennings – Mammas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\n\nLeo Kottke – Eight Miles High\n\nJohn Fahey – Voice of the Turtle\n\nDisco\n\nEveryone, seemingly, made a disco record by the end of the 70s, but that wasn’t necessarily a good thing. The best disco songs of the 70s, though? Perfection. The partnership between Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder delivered some of the finest disco of the decade. And, of course, there’s also the Bee Gees, who made one of the best–selling records of all–time. Dig a little deeper, though, and you’ll soon get to the great non–disco artists making incredible one-offs (ABBA, Diana Ross).\n\nDiana Ross – Love Hangover\n\nCerrone – Supernature\n\nGiorgio Moroder – Chase\n\nBee Gees – Stayin’ Alive\n\nAndy Gibb – Shadow Dancing\n\nDonna Summer – I Feel Love\n\nChic – Le Freak\n\nABBA – Dancing Queen\n\nGrace Jones – Pull Up The Bumper>/h3>\n\nThelma Houston – Don’t Leave Me This Way\n\nMusic from Germany\n\nFor a long time, they called the best songs to emerge from Germany in the 70s krautrock, but that’s simply because it was impossible to find a word for what was happening. While so many styles of music went big and loud, Neu!, Can, and Kraftwerk locked in on a groove and simply let the thing play out into infinity. In the process, they created an entirely new language that has influenced generations of musicians in Germany and beyond.\n\nNeu! – Hallogallo\n\nFaust – It’s a Rainy Day, Sunshine Girl\n\nCan – Vitamin C\n\nTangerine Dream – Phaedra\n\nKraftwerk – Autobahn\n\nSinger–Songwriter\n\nSongs are all about communication. The best singer-songwriters of the 70s, however, had very different concerns. It was simple representation for Helen Reddy. Elton John and Bernie Taupin wanted to capture the feeling of being in a new place, one that you didn’t quite understand. John Lennon, meanwhile, just wanted you to imagine a different world. Whatever the message, the songs below are some of the very finest of the decade.\n\nNick Drake – Pink Moon\n\nSimon and Garfunkel – Bridge Over Troubled Water\n\nLeonard Cohen – Famous Blue Raincoat\n\nHelen Reddy – I Am Woman\n\nKate Bush – Wuthering Heights\n\nBob Dylan – Tangled Up in Blue\n\nElton John – Tiny Dancer\n\nCarole King – It’s Too Late\n\nCarly Simon – You’re So Vain\n\nJimmy Buffett – Margaritaville\n\nGeorge Harrison – My Sweet Lord\n\nJohn Lennon – Imagine\n\nPaul McCartney – Maybe I’m Amazed\n\nFilm Scores and Soundtracks\n\nMore and more pop music began to be used in films throughout the 70s and, as a result, some of the best songs of the decade have iconic visual memories attached to them. Who can forget Rocky and “Gonna Fly Now”? Or the intro to the Bond classic Diamonds Are Forever? Film composers were also producing some of the most iconic music of the decade as well. Little new can be said about Nino Rota’s Godfather “Love Theme” or John Williams’ world-famous Star Wars theme.\n\nBernard Herrmann – Main Title (from Taxi Driver)\n\nJohn Williams – Star Wars Main Title\n\nNino Rota – Love Theme\n\nShirley Bassey / John Barry – Diamonds Are Forever\n\nBill Conti – Gonna Fly Now\n\nJohn Travolta & Olivia Newton-John – You’re The One That I Want\n\nBarbra Streisand – Love Theme From A Star Is Born (Evergreen)\n\nHard Rock / Prog\n\nAs rock ‘n’ roll entered into its adolescence, many of the artists that picked up guitars were looking for something louder and complicated. Sometimes both. Bands like Black Sabbath and Deep Purple marked the beginnings of metal, while Rush and Genesis created elaborate concepts to undergird their lengthy albums. At its core, though, all of these bands sought to do something more with their music in the 70s, whatever it is, embodying the spirit of rock ‘n’ roll at its best.\n\nThe Who – Baba O’Riley\n\nThin Lizzy – The Boys Are Back In Town\n\nAC/DC – Highway to Hell\n\nAerosmith – Sweet Emotion\n\nBad Company – Can’t Get Enough\n\nGrand Funk Railroad – Some Kind of Wonderful\n\nBlack Sabbath – War Pigs\n\nRush – Closer to the Heart\n\nGenesis – The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\n\nGong – Master Builder\n\nVan Der Graaf Generator – Theme One\n\nDeep Purple – Smoke on the Water\n\nLed Zeppelin – Stairway To Heaven\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd – Sweet Home Alabama\n\nCheck out our playlist of the best 70s music on Spotify.\n\nLatin Music\n\nSound-wise, the decade in Latin music was dominated by salsa, a sound created by Cuban and Puerto Rican musicians in New York City. The life-affirming music had an impact that is impossible to measure. Label–wise, Fania was once again the dominant player, an imprint that perfectly balanced progessive sounds and commercial instincts. Like many English language labels of similar stature, they had artists that were just as socially conscious too: Just listen to Eddie Palmieri’s “Vámonos Pa’l Monte” or Willie Colon and Ruben Blades’ “Pedro Navaja” for proof.\n\nEddie Palmieri – ‎Vámonos Pa’l Monte\n\nSantana – Oye Como Va\n\nAngel Cnales – Lejos De Ti\n\nRay Barretto – Indestructible\n\nRoberto Roena – Tu Loco Loco Y Yo Tranquilo\n\nWillie Colon & Ruben Blades – Pedro Navaja\n\nCelia Cruz & Johnny Pacheco – Quimbara\n\nEl Chicano – Sabor A Mi\n\nSoul\n\nSoul music had basically been perfected throughout the 60s by Motown and others, so the following decade was all about broadening the genre’s borders in different ways. Eddie Kendricks, for instance, helped pioneer disco with “Girl, You Need a Change of Mind,” while Minnie Riperton took things to the stratosphere with her impossible vocal performance on “Lovin’ You.” The explicit way that artists tackled political and social issues, however, was the biggest change from the 60s to the 70s in terms of the best soul songs, with Marvin Gaye’s landmark “What’s Going On” leading the way.\n\nBobby Womack – Across 110th Street\n\nDonny Hathaway – A Song for You\n\nFive Stairsteps – O–o–h Child\n\nSmokey Robinson & the Miracles – Tears of a Clown\n\nRoberta Flack – Killing Me Softly with His Song\n\nThe Jackson 5 – I’ll Be There\n\nAl Green – Let’s Stay Together\n\nMarvin Gaye – What’s Going On\n\nGladys Knight & The Pips – Midnight Train to Georgia\n\nEddie Kendricks – Girl, You Need a Change of Mind\n\nRose Royce – I’m Going Down\n\nMinnie Riperton – Lovin’ You\n\nBill Withers – Lean on Me\n\nGlam / Art Rock\n\nWhat’s the fun in rock ‘n’ roll if you aren’t dressing up or playing around with the form itself? Glam and art-rockers took this question to the logical conclusion throughout the 70s. The best glam songs rocked as hard as anything else, but did it through a sheen of glitter. (T. Rex’s “Bang a Gong” being a prime example.) Sparks and Frank Zappa, meanwhile, proved that you can have a laugh and create timeless music at the same time.\n\nThe Sweet – The Ballroom Blitz\n\nRoxy Music – Love Is The Drug\n\nT. Rex – Bang a Gong (Get It On)\n\nDavid Bowie – Starman\n\nSparks – This Town Ain’t Big Enough For The Both Of Us\n\nFrank Zappa – Bobby Brown Goes Down\n\nLou Reed – Walk on the Wild Side\n\nSerge Gainsbourg – Melody"
