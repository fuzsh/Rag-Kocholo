        "text": "https://lnkd.in/g2H7tvQg My Brother Steve Beckley passed away August 13, 2024. He just had a back operation. He fell at a rehab center he was rehabilitating at. This was one of his favorite songs. He was only 66 years old? I am still in disbelief that he gone. # Death # Dedication # Funeral # Stelly Dan\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gDe8fg7y Johnny Lang sings \" Lie to Me\" I have never seen such raw talent and passion in a long time. Especially at a young age. # Soul # Passion # Guitar\n\nJe t'aime is one of the most beautiful,heart felt and romantic songs I have ever heard. It is part of the sound track from the movie \" The English Patient\" # Love # Longing # Obsession # Passion"
