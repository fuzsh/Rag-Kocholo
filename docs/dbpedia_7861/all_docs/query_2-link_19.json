As a life-long fan, Curry dedicated himself to continue John Denver’s legacy of songs and his message of love and caring for our planet to future generations.\n\nSince 2002 the combined talents of Jim and his band have brought John’s Music back to thousands upon thousands of people. Jim is honored to have had John Denver band members join him in some of the most prestigious venues in the country. Curry also works behind the scenes to preserve Denver’s music. Most notable is Jim’s collaboration with Lee Holdridge in rebuilding and preserving Denver’s original symphony arrangements.\n\nJim Curry was a key performer in the induction of John Denver to the Colorado Music Hall of fame show hosted by Olivia Newton John. Curry was also the host of the official John Denver Estate show which toured the United States and Australia.\n\nJim continues to perform John Denver’s heartfelt songs on Cruise Ships in Symphony halls and in Performing Arts Centers to growing audiences all over the world.\n\n“Jim Curry was over there sounding like John Denver… I closed my eyes and went back to the times when I worked with John.” Pete Huttlinger, guitar player for John Denver.\n\nTickets: $18-$32; On Sale 3/5/24 at 10am"
