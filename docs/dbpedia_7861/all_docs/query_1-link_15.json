        "text": "What was John Denver's real name and where was he from?\n\nJohn Denver - Take Me Home, Country Roads (from The Wildlife Concert)\n\nJohn Denver was born Henry John Deutschendorf Jr, on December 31, 1943, in Roswell, New Mexico.\n\nHis parents were Captain Henry John 'Dutch' Deutschendorf Sr (1920–1982), a United States Army Air Forces pilot stationed at Roswell Army Air Field, and Erma Louise (née Swope; 1922–2010).\n\nLater in life, John explained that his stern father did not show love for his children, with John being the eldest.\n\nAs his father was in the military and his family moved around often, it was difficult for John to make friends and fit in with other children, as he was constantly the 'new kid'.\n\nAged 11, John Denver received an acoustic guitar from his grandmother. He learned to play so he could perform at local clubs by the time he was in college.\n\nAt first, he changed his name when Randy Sparks, founder of the New Christy Minstrels, suggested that 'Deutschendorf' would not fit well on a marquee.\n\nWas John Denver married and did he have children?\n\nJohn Denver's first marriage was to Annie Martell. She was the subject of his classic ballad 'Annie's Song', which he wrote in just 10 minutes while sitting on a Colorado ski lift.\n\nThe couple adopted a boy, Zachary John, and a girl, Anna Kate.\n\nHe said: \"I'll tell you the best thing about me. I'm some guy's dad; I'm some little gal's dad. When I die, Zachary John and Anna Kate's father, boy, that's enough for me to be remembered by. That's more than enough\".\n\nDenver and Martell divorced in 1982. He later said that his career demands drove them apart.\n\nHe later married Australian actress Cassandra Delaney in 1988. They couple had a daughter, Jesse Belle.\n\nHowever, they separated in 1991 and divorced in 1993.\n\nWhen and how did John Denver die?\n\nJohn Denver had a longtime love of flying.\n\nIn 1974, he bought a Learjet to fly himself to concerts. He was a collector of vintage biplanes, and owned a Christen Eagle aerobatic plane, two Cessna 210 Centurion airplanes, and in 1997 an amateur-built Rutan Long-EZ.\n\nJohn Denver died on October 12, 1997, when his light homebuilt aircraft, a Rutan Long-EZ, crashed into Monterey Bay near Pacific Grove, California.\n\nIt crashed after making a series of touch-and-go landings at the nearby Monterey Peninsula Airport.\n\nDenver was the plane's only occupant at the time. The official cause of death was multiple blunt force trauma resulting from the crash.\n\nAt the time, John Denver was a pilot with over 2,700 hours of experience. He was not legally permitted to fly at the time of the crash. In previous years, he had several arrests for drunk driving.\n\nIn 1996, nearly a year before the accident, the FAA discovered that Denver had failed to stay sober, and revoked his medical certification. However, the accident was not influenced by alcohol, as an autopsy found no sign of alcohol or other drugs in Denver's body.\n\nAfter the announcement of Denver's death, Colorado Governor Roy Romer ordered all state flags to be lowered to half-staff in his memory.\n\nOn September 23, 2007, nearly 10 years after John Denver's death, his brother Ron attended the dedication of a plaque placed near the crash site in Pacific Grove, California."
