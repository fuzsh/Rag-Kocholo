        "text": "After being selected to sing as the voice of John Denver in the CBS Television Movie “Take Me Home, the John Denver Story,” there was no doubt that Jim Curry would continue to sing the praises and songs of America’s Troubadour – John Denver. As a life-long fan, Curry dedicated himself to continue John Denver’s legacy of songs and his message of love and caring for our planet to future generations.\n\nSince 2002 the combined talents of Curry and his band have brought John’s music back to thousands of people. He also works behind the scenes to preserve Denver’s music. Most notable is Curry’s collaboration with Lee Holdridge in rebuilding and preserving Denver’s original symphony arrangements. Curry was a key performer in the induction of John Denver to the Colorado Music Hall of fame show hosted by Olivia Newton John. He also was the host of the official John Denver Estate show, which toured the United States and Australia. Curry’s latest project is titled, “Such a Wild Place,” which was produced by two of John Denver’s band members, Pete Huttlinger and Chris Nole. It includes four original songs co-written by Jim Curry and also includes three unreleased songs written by John Denver.\n\nAfter being selected to sing as the voice of John Denver in the CBS Television Movie “Take Me Home, the John Denver Story,” there was no doubt that Jim Curry would continue to sing the praises and songs of America’s Troubadour – John Denver.
