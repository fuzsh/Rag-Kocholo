        "text": "Capital Caring\n\n40th anniversary benefit concert\n\nHospice Comes to Washington\n\nMalen Smith Davis, president Capital Caring\n\nOlivia Newton-John\n\nBeth Nielsen Chapman\n\nAmy Sky\n\nMonday, May 1\n\nRonald Reagan Building\n\n1300 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W.\n\n7 p.m.\n\nTickets: $95 (meet-and-greet package: $350)\n\ncapitalcaring.org\n\nMulti-talented singer, actress and activist, Olivia Newton-John will make a special stop in the nation’s capital at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center Monday, May 1 for Capital Caring’s 40th anniversary.\n\nThe “Physical” singer and “Grease” icon will perform a special acoustic show with Amy Sky and Beth Nielsen Chapman in honor of their album together, “Liv On.”\n\nReleased in October, “Liv On” is about healing and coping with loss. In a statement about the album, the three women say it’s “intended for those who wish to transcend loss while walking a journey toward newfound meaning and hope.”\n\nThe album is extremely personal for the three women as each have suffered loss in recent years. Newton-John lost her sister to brain cancer, Sky lost her mother to cancer and Nielsen Chapman lost her husband to cancer as well. Newton-John and Nielsen Chapman are also breast cancer survivors or “thrivers” as they call themselves.\n\nWASHINGTON BLADE: You’re in D.C. for Capital Caring’s 40th anniversary. Why is this an important event for you to be a part of?\n\nOLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN: Well, I’ve never been part of this event before, but I just recorded an album with two of my dear friends, Amy Sky and Beth Nielsen Chapman. We recorded an album called “Liv On.” Have you heard it yet?\n\nBLADE: I have actually. It’s a great album, very soothing and comforting.\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: Aw, thank you. So the album is about loss and grief and moving through it. We were asked to do this event and it seems to fit in with the theme of the album, am I correct?\n\nBLADE: You are. The event is also celebrating the 10th anniversary of Hospice Comes to Washington as well.\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: Exactly, so that’s why we’re proud of this album. The three of us have all experienced the emotions of loss and grief and this album is really inspired by when I lost my sister nearly four years ago now to a brain tumor. I realized there wasn’t music about going through loss and grief and I would write songs and my friends Beth and Amy had written some songs on the same subject and we started collaborating and writing some new ones. It’s a healing experience for us.\n\nBLADE: You worked with Amy on “Grace and Gratitude.” Had you worked with Beth before?\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: Yes, we wrote a few things together and she’s an amazing writer and friend. We’re friends more than anything. She had breast cancer and I talked to her and helped her through that time period, so we’ve been friends for a long time.\n\nBLADE: In 2014, a year after the death of your sister, you released a great EP called “The Hotel Sessions.”\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: Yes, thank you. I did the EP with my nephew, Rona’s son (Brett Goldsmith).\n\nBLADE: Was that part of the healing process for the two of you?\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: No, not really. We had started it four years before. Every time I’d go to Australia I’d go to his house in Melbourne and we’d finish another track. We had just finished it right around the time she got sick. It was just perfect timing.\n\nBLADE: How long did the process of recording “Liv On” take?\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: It took about a year. We had to write the songs and I was in Vegas and the girls have their own careers, so we had to find a time we could all get together. It was a long process, but it was really worth it because it’s a timeless subject that everyone can relate to.\n\nBLADE: You’ve done a few shows so far with Amy and Beth. What can fans expect?\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: It’s going to be the album plus maybe a song or two of our own. It’s a trio, you know. It’s been wonderful working with them and singing as a trio rather than by myself and having the support of them on stage with the emotional aspect of this, it’s been fabulous.\n\nBLADE: Have you heard from fans and what their reactions have been to “Liv On”?\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: Oh yes, they love it. We’ve had some strong reactions to it. You know, everybody goes through loss and pain in their life and not everyone has someone to talk to about it and that can be very devastating. I think it’s a wonderful outlet for people to share.\n\nBLADE: Family is important to you and in 2015, you released “You Have To Believe” with your daughter, Chloe Lattanzi and it went to No. 1 on the Billboard U.S. Hot Dance Songs Chart. Was that a surprise for you?\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: It was a wonderful surprise! (laughs) We thought it would do well, but for it be number one was fantastic.\n\nBLADE: For some of the die-hard fans out there, is there a vault of unreleased Olivia songs that are just waiting to see the light of day?\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: You know what, there are. I’m going to be doing a box set at some point.\n\nBLADE: Have you thought about releasing a memoir?\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: Yes, I’ve thought about it. It’ll probably be in the works at some point.\n\nBLADE: Along with the “Liv On” shows, you’re also touring with your own show. You wrapped up Vegas last year and are doing select dates across the country. Do you prefer doing a residency or do you have more fun hitting the road?\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: I like them both for different reasons. I wouldn’t say one over the other. I enjoyed my three years in Vegas and I liked the consistency and waking up in the same bed, having my husband and my animals with me, so that was fantastic. Touring is a whole other thing too, but it’s fun and different.\n\nBLADE: Your last few albums have been more on the inspirational side. Any thought on releasing any more pop music?\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: Ummm, well, I don’t close the door on anything. Who knows what will happen. What I’m doing now is more of what I’ve wanted to do lately.\n\nBLADE: During your concert shows, you pay tribute to your country music beginnings. When you first came to Nashville, there was a lot of opposition with you treading into this established traditional community. Did you ever feel the backlash back then?\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: You know what, I wasn’t really aware of the backlash till afterward. I was traveling and touring and I heard about it after and heard Dolly and Loretta had backed me up so I had great support. It was just a few people, you know — it was change. John Denver and I were the first people to cross over from country to pop and I think that was threatening to them, but they later on saw the advantage (laughs).\n\nBLADE: You sparked some excitement recently when you announced you were planning something for the 40th anniversary of “Grease.”\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: I didn’t actually make any announcement (laughs). I don’t know where that came from. I said we’ll probably do something is all I said. I’m not sure what we’re going to do yet for it.\n\nBLADE: Do you feel any of your movies were overshadowed by the success and popularity of “Grease”?\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: Not really. I don’t think so. I made “Xanadu” afterward and a few little movies that were fun to make. I did one about five years ago called “A Few Best Men” that was pretty funny, but I don’t think it’s gotten released here in the States.\n\nBLADE: Over the last few years you’ve been hinting about retiring and taking it easy. Do you think you could ever really settle down outside the spotlight?\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: I’m gonna do less. I’ve been saying for 10 years I was gonna do less, but fun things come up and I never know what’s going to happen. That’s the fun of it really.\n\nBLADE: Everyone knows you from something different — some from your acting, your music, charity work. What do you want to be most remembered for?\n\nNEWTON-JOHN: Gosh, I haven’t really thought about that. Well of course for having nice music, lovely music and if I may have touched someone’s heart or helped them in some way. And of course for the hospital (Olivia-Newton John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre). I’m hoping my hospital is where we’ll see an end to cancer, that’s my dream.\n\nWe often hear the term lobbyist associated with negative connotations. Think oil and gas initiatives that often seek to curtail environmental protections to further their industries. Consider “big pharma,” which is often vilified for keeping healthcare costs high. However, there are lobbyists fighting for our rights – not just LGBTQ rights, but human rights as well. Brad Howard, founder and president of the Corcoran Street Group (CSG) is one such out, gay lobbyist advocating for equality and equity.\n\nTo start, Howard shares his definition of a lobbyist, which transcends the stereotype that the term originates with politicos literally waiting in D.C. hotel lobbies hoping to hobnob with politicians to foster their interests, often with cash in hand.\n\n“Understanding how government works can be incredibly difficult, even to those on the inside,” he shared. “Lobbying is a constitutionally protected right explicitly guaranteed in the First Amendment – the right to petition our government. At its most basic level, lobbying is essentially contacting a public official to express your opinion or ask them to take a certain action. So, if you have ever emailed or called your city council rep or Member of Congress – or even tagged them on social media – you lobbied.”\n\nHoward, who came to Washington from a conservative background in Arkansas, had a journey from working with Republican leaders and causes to being more libertarian before eventually joining with the Blue Dog Democrats. This is quite a change for a young man who founded a teenage GOP group in high school, chaired the college Republicans group at Hendrix University, and became vice chair of Arkansas College Republicans.\n\nSo, how did a nice conservative Christian Republican whose parents voted for Ross Perot instead of Bill Clinton from the Bible Belt end up as a gay lobbyist?\n\n“I was subconsciously rejecting any attempt to live my life the way someone told me to … a Libertarian streak if you will,” Howard said. “I was always pro-choice and pro-marriage equality as I didn’t want the government anywhere near me. Throughout all of this, I was starting to understand that I was gay and what that meant for my future in politics, it was bleak. Then the Bush-Cheney campaign in 2004 started pushing constitutional amendments banning gay marriage in states across the country to drive evangelical turnout. That ran counter to my politics – to the basic principle of promoting individual liberty. So I left the party then and graduated college as an independent in 2006 with the goal of moving to Washington as quickly as possible.”\n\nBy 2007 he was living in Washington, D.C., interning for Simon Rosenberg’s New Democrat Network, and pursuing a master’s from American University. Coming out for Howard happened on the first day he entered college, quite a “daunting and scary” task summed up by him as: “I have blue eyes. I love playing cards. I’m a terrible, but very confident karaoke singer. Oh, by the way, I’m gay.”\n\nThe “it’s part of me, but not my whole identity,” is often expressed by those on the – shall we say – cusp of coming out. He cites a Foundry United Methodist pastor’s message as impetus for coming out as a defining part of his identity.\n\n“That seed of shame you feel for being gay – that was not planted there by God; it was planted there by the church, and I’m sorry,” here he’s referring to a sermon by Pastor Ginger Gaines-Cerelli. “I can’t describe what it [felt] like to be 33 years old and have your world completely upended like that. It wasn’t just the statement, which answered a question that had long haunted me; it was also the apology. I didn’t even know that I needed an apology, but I did, and it worked.”\n\nBefore starting CSG, he worked at a bipartisan lobbyist group and was mentored by former Chief of Senate Staff Bob Van Heuvelen. Howard describes his mentor’s approach to lobbying as guided by a strong moral compass, and seeing people as people, not transactions.\n\nThe way it should be: Since corporations are not people.\n\nHoward also sits on the board of directors for Q Street, as treasurer. Q Street is an LGBTQ lobbyist organization. Yesenia Henninger, the out queer president of Q Street since January of this year – and board member for five years – explains in further detail what her group does to foster queer rights.\n\n“Q Street is the nonprofit, nonpartisan, professional association of LGBTQ lobbyists and public policy advocates. Q Street was formed to be the bridge between LGBTQ advocacy organizations, LGBTQ+ lobbyists on K Street,” District lingo for queer lobbyists, “and our colleagues and allies on Capitol Hill. Q Street has more than 3,000 recipients of our monthly newsletter, hundreds of attendees at our receptions, and our monthly luncheons have featured speakers such as Members of Congress, campaign managers, activists, plaintiffs in the most important LGBTQ+ Supreme Court cases of our time, and the Secretary of the Army. Q Street hosts nearly 25 receptions, lunches, and professional development events every year. Our goal is to provide the best networking opportunities and professional development trainings so our members continue to grow within the ranks of their field.”\n\nAccording to Henninger there has been a growing population of queer lobbyists since the Obama years. Marriage equality, an impetus for Howard to perhaps “come out politically” equally spurred their growth. After Obama, this presence fought to maintain rights gained. This is amazing growth considering at one time people working for our equity did so in an almost secretive fashion.\n\nAn aside here, Sean Strub the founder of POZ Magazine, wrote a powerful book in 2014 called “Body Counts: A Memoir of Politics, Sex, AIDS and Survival,” which chronicles advocacy in D.C. in the years after Stonewall.\n\nThe majority of these K Street lobbyists are in their 30s and 40s. Although Henninger shares there are more junior and more senior-ranking lobbyists in terms of age or career.\n\nWhat do they do? Is it office-to-event, sleep, repeat? Henninger explained that a queer lobbyist’s lifestyle varies depending on the issue area they focus on. Her organization has lobbyists working in policy as well as members who focus on energy and transportation issues, and topics all across the spectrum.\n\n“The lobbyists and advocates whose roles require them to engage in political activity may also have different lifestyles than those that do not. They likely have fundraisers (sometimes one, sometimes multiple) that they attend after work with Members of Congress or other politicians. However, we also have many public policy advocate members who spend their day talking to Members of Congress, or administration officials, trying to achieve their policy goals that do not have any fundraiser-related obligations. Q Street hopes to provide a great space for our members to network with one another and unite their social and professional experiences in the district.”\n\nWe are all aware what is at stake in the upcoming presidential election in what can only sadly be described as a deeply divided nation. What role will LGBTQ lobbyists play, I asked Brad Howard.\n\n“If you vote third party, if you leave the race blank, or if you stay home, you are helping to elect Donald Trump,” he said. “You are not punishing Joe Biden, you are punishing the millions of Americans, the millions of aspiring Americans who face deportation, millions of women who depend on access to reproductive health, and so many transgender young people who need protection – all of these people will be punished in a Trump presidency. And, Joe Biden is going to need a Democratic Congress – or we’ll need a Democratic Congress to stop Donald Trump. So to me, the most pro-LGBTQ+ thing you can do this election is to vote Democrat…because the choices have never been clearer.”\n\nVisit Corcoran Street Group and Q Street to learn more about their work.\n\nTwo buildings, one romance, and 25 years later, the Purple Parrot is busy as ever.\n\nIf the tropical purple paint covering the outside with rainbow flags and walls covered with love notes, affirmations, and drunk wishes scribbled on dollar bills don’t indicate it already, the Purple Parrot is an institution in Rehoboth. The gay-owned and operated fixture is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year.\n\nThe Blade sat down with owners Hugh Fuller and Troy Roberts of the Rehoboth establishment to discuss the past 25 years and plans for the future.\n\nFuller and Roberts, both gay, have been working together since before the Parrot was even an idea. Fuller was a co-owner of the Iguana, another restaurant and bar in the town.\n\n“I was in the Iguana first with another business partner,” Fuller said. “I was going to get out and move up to Pennsylvania with him [Roberts]. He decided that he was going to come down and said, ‘Well, what if I go in with you at the Iguana and we do it together?’ And I was like, ‘Alright,’ so we did, and it just snowballed from there. We were always in the restaurant business together from the beginning.”\n\n“Yeah, that was really luck, too,” Roberts began. “Because-”\n\n“Because Grindr wasn’t around then!” Fuller interjected, laughing as Roberts began to roll his eyes and smile.\n\n“I had a small place up in York,” Roberts continued. “Selling that kind of gave us some money to buy the other guy out. We just had friends supporting us and helping us along the way and it just kind of worked.”\n\n“Kind of worked” would be an understatement. The pair moved on from the Iguana and opened the Parrot. Then, after opening the Parrot, they decided to shift locations to a larger location down the street to accommodate the growing demand. Then in 2010, the Parrot expanded again, adding the land behind the Rehoboth Avenue location, which provided an additional 950 square feet as well as giving patrons access to Wilmington Avenue.\n\nThe bar and restaurant, which serves American cuisine with a beach flair, has always focused on being a welcoming space to all regardless of sexuality, gender, race, nationality, or identity. This, the duo explains, is one of the reasons why the restaurant has had such a lasting impact on the Rehoboth restaurant and gay communities.\n\n“Back in the ‘90s when we first opened up, the amount of straight crossdressers that would come were like, ‘Oh, are we allowed to come in? Are we welcomed into a place like that?’ And we were like ‘Everybody that walks on this planet is welcome here!’” Fuller said. “Those are the kinds of things, you know, where people just felt comfortable. They would get stared at out on the street, but inside they would walk around and feel like they were in their own skin. It was just really cool to see.”\n\nThe feeling of acceptance has been a crucial part of the Parrot’s success.\n\n“I got an email a couple of days ago — probably two weeks ago about a woman bringing her daughter down,” Roberts said. “She’s 16 and was bullied through school — hard times, depression, tried to harm herself a couple of times. It was just really sweet that she reached out and she’s like, ‘My daughter was a completely different person when I brought her into your bar. Everybody treated her nice — the bartenders, the waitstaff, I mean, everybody was friendly. She just doesn’t experience that often being an out 16-year-old lesbian. We just can’t even thank you enough.’ It’s those kinds of things that we get often.”\n\n“[The mother] mainly wrote it because we put the Pride flag on the Parrot’s Facebook wall,” Fuller added.\n\nThe colorful lights, disco balls, and staggering number of dollar bills stapled to the walls highlight that the Rehoboth community has embraced the Parrot. It’s not uncommon to see a group of gay patrons sitting at the bar in bathing suits sipping on orange crushes and talking about their day at Poodle Beach while a bachelorette party belts out Lady Gaga on karaoke night in the room next door. That is the vibe Fuller and Roberts have curated — a fun and friendly tropical oasis in the middle of Rehoboth Avenue.\n\nA crucial element of this curated vibe, the pair point out, is treating employees and guests with respect. When asked what they have learned that helped them be so successful over the past 25 years, Fuller and Roberts said the same thing.\n\n“Patience, organization, and treating people well,” Roberts said.” I think that’s probably one of the bigger of the three — you treat them well and they treat you well. I think it’s just a mutual respect.”\n\n“It took me about 30 years to learn that it’s not just all about work,” Fuller said. “I used to bust my butt in there all the time and the focus was [on] the restaurant. I know [Roberts] said patience, I would say mine was being patient too because I learned going in that it’s easier to deal with your employees without shouting at them. It took me a little while to get through that.”\n\nHe added that compensating staff fairly was also one of their keys to success.\n\n“Before we take a nickel out of our business, we put $1 back into our employees’ pockets,” Fuller said. We want the business to survive and it has been incredible.”\n\nFuller added that this sentiment, of having patience and treating everyone with respect, goes both ways — it applies to the Parrot’s patrons as well.\n\n“If you leave the Parrot angry, it’s your own decision,” Fuller explained. “If we don’t make you happy there, it’s because you’re choosing not to be happy. We will go out of our way to correct anything and everything that we can. So if you leave [unhappy], it’s not because we couldn’t do it. It’s because you didn’t want us to.”\n\nThe two discussed their history together — anyone who has them interact can see their spirited energy and appreciation for each other.\n\n“Troy and I used to be a couple when we first opened, and we were together for about 10 years,” Fuller said. “And then we kind of went our separate ways, but the restaurant kept us in very close contact. Sometimes I think we’re probably closer than most couples are because of the way that the restaurant has us tied together.”\n\n“Even during the worst of it, we never stopped communicating on a daily basis,” Roberts added. “Obviously, you can tell by his personality why that all went south,” he said laughing.\n\n“Well, you can tell by the way that he looks why it went south.” Fuller jabbed back, also laughing.\n\n“Hey!” Roberts replied.\n\n“I wasn’t gonna continue dating my grandfather!” Fuller joked.\n\nDespite the end of their romantic relationship, there was still clear evidence of perpetual good energy between the business partners. The two then started to reminisce about the past 25 years and the struggles and successes they overcame to reach this milestone.\n\nThe pair mentioned the two biggest struggles they have faced in the past quarter century. One was when Rehoboth Avenue was dug up for the Streetscape improvement project, and the second was the 2008 recession.\n\n“We were refinancing our houses several times to keep it afloat there for a little while,” Fuller said.\n\n“But hey, we got nice sidewalks now!” Roberts added. “So that’s good.”\n\nIt’s not just the customers who grew up with the Parrot; so did the staff.\n\n“I mean one of the kids who bussed for us is now our dentist,” Fuller said.\n\n“One of the busboys from the Iguana days, he’s our dentist now,” Roberts explained. “They actually started dating in high school while working together at the Iguana. One of them followed us to the Parrot and her daughter just worked for us two summers ago as a host. He’s our dentist, and they’re still local. We just sold him a house over in Lewes, because we’re both Realtors on the side. When you look back at that, you’re like, ‘Oh, my God, you were just a kid. And now you have a kid graduating college!’ It goes fast.”\n\nIt seems that many of the staff have a soft spot for the Parrot, and for good reason. An important aspect of keeping their employees happy is supporting them. At first, it was trips to Disney World with some of the servers and renting out the local waterpark to give kids time to enjoy the summer. Then it became Christmas bonuses, which are not common in the food service industry.\n\nThe Parrot helped raise more than $10,000 for one of their employees dealing with fallout from the war in Ukraine.\n\n“One of our bartenders being from Ukraine, when all that went down, amazingly, how he was able to bring a lot of his family over,” Roberts said. “And until they actually got grounded, he had places for them to stay all lined up.”\n\n“The reason that he was able to get them over is because we did a fundraiser at the restaurant and our customers raised over $10,000 to help sponsor his family and one of our other employees’ families,” Fuller said. “They brought them all the way up through Mexico and into the country and now they’re here with citizenship cards and working for us. We got them houses and apartments too.”\n\n“We don’t care what they are, whether they’re straight, Black, Chinese, Mexican. It’s like the Benetton of Rehoboth in here,” Fuller added. “It’s the United Nations. We support everybody and we’re not afraid to show our support for everybody.”\n\nIn addition to reminiscing about some of the good things the restaurant has done for its employees, they both talked about notable guests of the Parrot.\n\n“My mind went right to the guys from Manhattan, who would always come down,” Roberts said when asked if any guests have stuck out to him over the past 25 years. “They just happened to find us. They had never been to Rehoboth before. They walked into the original Parrot and had every single year after that until two of them passed away. It just became like a yearly week, then it turned into two weeks, and then it turned into two times a year. And it was all just because they came to one bar, and had so much fun. They would sit there all day, all night, go home take a nap, and come back for dinner. And it was just their place.”\n\nThey have faced some objections from those who were not as receptive to their tolerance of different people.\n\n“We get the same hate that everybody else does — the same hate that the city got when they put the rainbow crossings in and the flag up,” Fuller said. “I was just telling Troy about a conversation I had yesterday with a guy. The front of our business for Pride month has flags on it and says ‘Happy Pride.’ And he said, ‘I was going to come in here but I see you’re supporting the gay community with your rainbow flags.’ And I said ‘Yes.’ And he goes, ‘Well, I don’t see why you don’t have flags for veterans.’ And I said,’ Well, as a veteran, I can tell you that we don’t serve to be recognized, we serve to protect and to give you guys your freedom. It’s not something that we want recognition for. But there is a flag, the American flag, that flies over the top of our business every day to represent the veterans of this country.’”\n\nDespite the opinions of some who are less than welcoming of the LGBTQ community, the Purple Parrot will always be a safe space to celebrate, the two affirmed. And celebrate they will.\n\nThe Parrot already hosted one party to celebrate the milestone of the bar early in the summer, but will throw an even bigger bash at the end of the season to commemorate the history and hard work that has gone into making the Parrot ‘fly.’\n\n“On May fifth we had a big party,” Fuller said. “We’ll have another one at the end of the summer in September. We did one at the beginning and then we’re going to do a really big one at the end of the summer. The first celebration, that weekend, turned out to be a little rainy, and misty so it wasn’t as big as it could have been. It was packed inside but it wasn’t packed outside like it normally is. We usually do a full cookout barbecue, all that stuff and we’ll do that again at the end of the summer. We’ll have another one of those with DJs. I am not sure about a drag show, but we’ll probably have something because the girls are trying to get something together. We don’t want to spoil anything but there will be a surprise.”\n\nWhen asked to give their final thoughts on owning and running one of Rehoboth’s most successful businesses as gay men, the two made it clear that it has to be a safe and welcoming space for all for it to succeed.\n\n“I think you have to be all-inclusive,” Roberts said. “I don’t think in today’s world you can just really limit it to the gay community. You have to be gay-friendly, and accepting as well. And I think that helps because it gets non-gays in there and everybody just starts to get along. It becomes more accepted and then becomes the norm.”\n\nFuller agreed but emphasized being true to one’s character in collaboration with being inclusive is the key to their success.\n\n“Being gay isn’t who we are, you know, it’s what we are,” Fuller said. “You can’t be afraid to be you. … If you’re going to open up a business, you want to make sure you lean on the community, because the community is going to be your biggest support. And that’s how we definitely lean on the gay community.”\n\nThe Purple Parrot is located at 134 Rehoboth Ave. in Rehoboth Beach and is open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. and is open from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m. on Sundays.
