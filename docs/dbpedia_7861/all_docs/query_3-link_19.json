        "text": "Even if you are not a fan of John Denver — and I should admit up front that I am — you’ve probably heard his best known song, “Take Me Home Country Roads.” It’s infiltrated the American psyche as a campfire staple. It made it onto a best-selling Disney Record, “Campout at Disney World.” It’s the state song of West Virginia, boisterously sung at all West Virginia Mountaineers home football games. In one particularly strange episode of “The Office,” Dwight Schrute sings a verse of “Country Roads” in what is supposed to be German.\n\nBut John Denver’s career was much more than this one, albeit iconic, song. As a songwriter, he had his first big hit with “Leaving on a Jet Plane,” which Peter, Paul, and Mary took to number 1 in 1969. Within a few years, Denver was making hits himself. “Country Roads” came out in 1972. But his biggest years were 1974 and 1975, when he had three consecutive Billboard number one albums, and four consecutive number one hit singles, including “Annie’s Song,” which has undoubtedly been played at a million weddings since.\n\nAnd he wasn’t just on the radio. His “Rocky Mountain Christmas” TV special attracted 60-million viewers, at the time the biggest audience in ABC-television’s history. His TV special “An Evening With John Denver,” won an Emmy Award. He was a regular guest host “The Tonight Show.” He hosted the Grammy Awards, and in 1975 was the Country Music Association’s “Entertainer of the Year.”\n\nPerhaps because of all that fame and middle-America appeal, he was never a darling of the critics. His music was too gentle and straightforward for the increasingly jaded, ironic, and sexualized MTV generation. In 1985, when the supergroup USA for Africa recorded “We Are The World” as a fundraiser for famine relief, Denver lobbied unsuccessfully to be a part of the recording. The rebuff, he later said, hurt him deeply, and precipitated a downward spiral. By the late 1980s, a series of extramarital affairs led to his divorce from the woman for whom he had written “Annie’s Song,” and — he later confessed in an autobiography — he turned to alcohol and drugs. He was arrested for drunk driving at least twice, leading to the temporary suspension of his pilot’s license. Flying, which he loved, was his ultimate undoing. He died in the crash of a plane he was piloting in 1997. By then, a second marriage had dissolved, he had been dropped by his record label, and he hadn’t had a hit in more than a decade.\n\nBut something strange has happened since his death. The man died, but his songs lived on. In 2013, the year Denver would have been 70, a group of contemporary artists including Josh Ritter, Dave Matthews, Emmy Lou Harris, Train, and Old Crow Medicine Show have released an album of John Denver’s music, “The Music is You.”\n\nLike many tribute albums, the performances are a mixed bag. Brandi Carlisle’s version of “Country Roads,” is uninspired, despite the help of background vocalist Emmy Lou Harris. Dave Matthews’ version of “Take Me To Tomorrow” is just plain weird. But the album has many gems, Mary Chapin Carpenter’s “I Guess He’d Rather Be In Colorado” among them. Evan Dando of the Lemonheads does a surprising version of “Looking for Space.” Amos Lee’s soulful “Some Days Are Diamonds” is perhaps the finest performance on the album. The best cuts honor the songs, but don’t try to imitate Denver’s versions of them, such as Allen Stone’s almost wistful take on “Rocky Mountain High.”\n\nThe album temporarily brought John Denver’s music back into the spotlight, especially with current fans of the artists on this album. It debuted at #37 on Billboard’s album chart, and at #12 on Billboard’s Country Music Chart. It made it all the way to #3 on the Folk Chart.\n\nFor many old fans, however, the album and its success was a validation of their long-standing admiration. Jim Curry has been leading a John Denver tribute band since 2007, and he plays as many as 150 concerts a year, often to audiences numbering in the thousands. When I caught up with Curry on the telephone, he was on the road in (where else?) Colorado, on the first day of a road trip that would have him doing 42 shows in 52 days. He said he thought Denver’s music would survive as part of the American Songbook tradition. He said, “We meet eight-year-olds now who know this music. We’ve got the grandparents, the parents who are our age, and now the kids.”\n\nThat John Denver did not live to see this renewed interest in his music is part of the tragedy of his life. His early death was also tragic because his life still seemed a work in progress. He often wrestled with spiritual matters in his music. Indeed, one of his albums was called “Spirit.” But his personal beliefs were a confused smorgasbord of New Age philosophies. However, as he got older, he began to re-explore the Christian faith of his youth, the faith of his mother Erma, who had been a life-long Christian, and his father, also named John, who had been a hard-living Air Force fighter pilot for most of his life but who made a profession of faith in Christ not long before he died.\n\nLes Felker was the pastor of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in Aurora, Colorado, that John Denver’s mother attended in her final years. Felker told me Denver would often attend church with his mother. He said Denver heard the Gospel many times from him and from others who were concerned about his spiritual condition. Bill Fay, a family friend who had been instrumental in the conversion of John Denver’s father, was with Denver a few weeks before his death. After an hour-long conversation about the Gospel, Fay asked Denver point-blank if he would like to dedicate his life to Christ. The singer thought about it for a few seconds and said, “Not now.” A month later, John Denver was dead.\n\nBecause of that response, Felker admitted it was unlikely John Denver was a Christian at the time of his death. But he then added, “I know John was searching, and I know he knew the Gospel. I still hold out hope that he made a commitment to Christ in those last weeks, and that one day I’ll see him in heaven.”\n\nTo which this long-time fan would add: “So do I.”"
