        "text": "Sometimes we get left out, no matter how hard we try.\n\nReaching the top of our game is difficult. For all our hard work, recognition at least offers assurance that not only have we arrived, we actually deserve being there. Thus, it becomes an enormous blow to the ego when suddenly we are told we’re not a welcomed member of the group, despite demonstrable achievements. I’ve experienced it, and you probably have too. It happens to the best of us.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the music industry pulled together some of its most prominent contenders with the goal of raising funds and awareness of global hunger, specifically in response to the 1983–85 famine in Ethiopia.\n\nThe story goes that after the UK charmed the world with Band-Aid’s December 1984 release, “Do They Know It’s Christmas?”, Harry Belafonte was inspired to organize a comparable relief effort in the US. Within seven weeks, more than fifty music greats across America had assembled to write, sing, and produce the historic multi-platinum single, “We Are the World.”\n\nIt was a broad collaboration that spanned musical genres. Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie penned the famous tune. Quincy Jones, Michael Omartian and Ken Kragen managed and produced it. Al Jarreau, Cyndi Lauper, Stevie Wonder, Waylon Jennings and dozens more contributed their voices to it.\n\nOf course, not everyone can dance at every wedding, or in this case, sing for every charity fundraiser — even if it’s for a cause you’re passionate about.\n\nJohn Denver was deeply moved by a variety of humanitarian and environmental causes, particularly the disparity of global food supplies that led to Third World hunger. While the western world continued to amass greater resources through agricultural and technological advances, the belly of Africa was devastated by drought and starvation.\n\nCompelled to problem solve and bring awareness to the plight of these starving masses, John cofounded the Hunger Project and worked with UNICEF as part of a fact-finding mission in Africa. In 1984, he spent more than two weeks touring four different African countries to see first-hand the horrors of malnourished children and families. What he saw was gut-wretching and unimagineable — bloated-belly children and their barely living skeletal frames, streets littered with corpses and starving people too weak and hopeless to bury them.\n\nBut John sang songs of hope and believed that with worldwide support, money could be raised and new farming projects could be mounted to bring relief.\n\nHowever, when John approached the newly established charity USA for Africa, moniker of the super band constructed for the production of “We Are the World,” his offers to assist and requests to participate were rejected.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone who wanted to participate in this historic recording could. And John Denver was definitely not the only musician turned away. However, his was probably the strongest resume in favor of his participation, even stronger than the organizers themselves.\n\nIn fact, Ken Kragen valued John’s insights and welcomed his participation but was shut down. Why?\n\nDenver was turned down because many people felt his image would hurt the credibility of the song as a pop-rock anthem.\n\nWow! Well if that ain’t a kick in the tush. With his salad bowl haircut and granny-rimmed glasses, John Denver simply wasn’t seen as cool enough to sit at the popular table.\n\nSo, the argument was made that he was too much of a “Country Boy.”\n\nSeriously? Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings were allowed to participate and they were both country musicians.\n\nWhat image exactly were they looking for? Bob Dylan could have potentially evoked folk, country, blues, or rock. Several singers were R&B, soul, or gospel. And Dan Aykroyd — did he even have a substantial image as a musician or was his inclusion just part of a larger vision to incorporate entertainers across the board?\n\nWas a poor excuse perhaps indicative that those involved had somewhat lost sight of the larger purpose of the venture?\n\nClearly, not always is the most dedicated player included in the game. Beyond qualifications and capabilities, inclusion and incorporation depend on how well you fit in with the culture of the team.\n\nIt is unfortunate that John Denver’s musical and humanitarian credits couldn’t seem to warrant his collaborative contributions. His appearance and associations with George Burns and Kermit the Frog apparently overshadowed logical reason.\n\nFortunately, John didn’t let this rejection keep him down in the doldrums. He remained active for the duration of his life both in music and activism. He was recognized for his dedication to hunger relief and honored with the Presidential World Without Hunger Award in 1987.\n\nAnd ultimately, he found camaraderie with plenty of other like-minded musicians, including hard rocker Dee Snyder and soft rock chanteuse Olivia Newton-John."
