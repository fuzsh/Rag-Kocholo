        "text": "RELATED: \"Everyone I Love is There, So That's Something To Look Forward To\" On Her 71st Birthday, Olivia Newton-John Is Focusing on The Positive, Even When it Comes to Dying Newton-John, who said this might “sound strange to someone who isn't in my position,” has approached her cancer with a graciousness and positivity that many other survivors find inspiring. And her attitude is a testament to the way that cancer can become a chronic disease rather than a terminal illness. Newton-John was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992. At the time, she received nine months of chemotherapy and a breast removal surgery, called a mastectomy.\n\nWhile her cancer entered remission, in 2013 her doctors discovered that it had metastasized (spread) beyond her breasts. She overcame the cancer again, but in 2017, her doctors discovered a tumor in her sacrum, the bone at the bottom of the spineanother cancer metastasis.\n\nSurvivorNet spoke with Newton-John in August and she told us that although her cancer had metastasized to her bones, she’s doing well. \"I'm mobile, I'm feeling strong, I've put on some weight.” she said. “Everything's good.\"\n\nPart of the reason for Newton-John’s condition, she shared with SurvivorNet, is that she’s found a treatment regimen that seems to be working well for her.\n\nThe treatment involves a mixture of conventional cancer treatment (for Newton-John, this is a hormone therapy) and complementary herbal medicine. Her husband of 11 years, John Easterling, the founder and Chairman of Amazon Herb Company, makes her tinctures (liquid extracts) out of the cannabis that he grows. Newton-John also shared that she’s been taking natural supplements, including turkey tail (an antioxidant-rich mushroom extract), Graviola supplements (derived from a plant believed to have medicinal properties), vitamin B17, and high doses of vitamin C, which she says she's been getting through an Amazonian fruit called Camu Camu.\n\nRELATED: \"A Lot of People are Selling Hope\": The Lure of Vitamins and Supplements\n\nExperts tell SurvivorNet that while alternative therapies can be helpful during cancer, they should never stand in the place of doctor-recommended treatment. Instead, these supplements should be taken in combination with conventional cancer treatmentand only after a doctor agrees it's a good idea.\n\nDr. Brian Berman of the University of Maryland (above) spoke with SurvivorNet about the difference between integrative medicine and alternative medicine.\n\nImportantly, Newton-John shared that she's been doing exactly thatpairing these natural herbs and supplements with her conventional breast cancer treatment in a complementary approach called \"integrative medicine.\" Right now, the star said she's receiving hormone therapy for her breast cancer, and in the past, she's undergone radiation, surgery, and chemotherapy.\n\nRELATED: A Smile as Big as Australia Olivia Newton-John Shares Health Update, Keeps It Positive Amid Breast Cancer Journey\n\n“I believe in the holistic approach of using everything you can that you're comfortable with,” Newton-John told SurvivorNet. “So I do that.”\n\nDr. Elizabeth Comen of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center spoke with SurvivorNet about treatment for stage four breast cancer.\n\nLearn more about SurvivorNet's rigorous medical review process."
