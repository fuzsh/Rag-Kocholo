        "text": "Hello all,\n\nThought I would start a thread here to point out some information about\n\nThe Columbine Trust Foundation, Joe Henry, and Olivia Newton-John.\n\nIf you go to the Columbine Trust Foundation's site, you will read about\n\nhow it came about, and about the use of some of the lyrics to \"The Flower\n\nThat Shattered the Stone\", which Joe Henry helped to write.\n\nIn August of 1999, Olivia Newton-John did a tour of the US, and sang\n\nhere in Portland, Oregon. She was just wonderful, and dedicated songs\n\nin John's memory, and had very nice things to say about him. While\n\nintroducing the next song she would be singing, she began by saying\n\nthat it was dedicated to all children everywhere, and mentioned that she\n\nhelped to collaborate on the song. She then proceeded to sing \"The Flower That\n\nShattered the Stone\". Afterwards, she told how it was written in honor\n\nof a friend's daughter, who was born 6 weeks after Olivia's, who had died of a\n\nrare form of non-genetic cancer----Wilm's tumor......in 1991. She died at age\n\nfive.\n\nColette is pictured, along with Olivia's daughter, Chole, on her album, Warm\n\nand Tender....\n\nI bought her program, and read and researched some information that was in it.\n\nA portion of the proceeds of all her concerts that year went to the CHEC\n\nFoundation-----the Children's Health Environmental Coalition. It is an\n\norganization founded in Colette Chuda's honor to educate parents and caregivers\n\nabout environmental health risks that children face in their homes, schools,\n\nand community environments.\n\nSenator Barbara Boxer from California introduced a bill (CEPA), Children's\n\nEnvironmental Protection Act, in Colette's memory.\n\nIn September of 1997, Nancy and James Chuda attended the National Summit on\n\nGlobal Warming and how the impact of global warming targeted children's\n\nenvironmental health.\n\nIf you go to the website and research it, you will find that Joe Henry is on\n\nthe Advisory Board of CHEC......\n\nhttp://www.checnet.org/chec/index.html\n\nI have no doubt that Mr. Henry is quite sincere in what he is doing at The\n\nColumbine Trust Foundation......When I first found out about the poster,\n\nfrom an article in The Aspen Times, I called to order the poster through\n\nthe Littleton Rotary Club. The man that I spoke with was very caring,\n\nand did indeed, stress that the medical expenses for those injured in\n\nthe shooting, were ongoing------and especially, for the young woman, whose\n\nmother committed sucide, after the shootings. He mentioned that the\n\nexpenses could continue for years...\n\nI have a great deal of respect and admiration for Mr. Henry, as well as\n\nOlivia Newton-John for their dedication in helping others.....\n\nThis is for those who are interested----I have found through research on my\n\npart,\n\nthat most of the people that were involved with John Denver in one way or\n\nanother, are very caring and dedicated people."
