I believe this has already been released in Australia but not yet worldwide. This is courtesy of a hometown friend of mine and and ABBA/Olivia obsessive called Lee Gale (thank you Lee! ):\n\nLife became a bit of a whirlwind at this point. I was juggling my time between studio and the road, and I was also given my own ABC TV special, an hour long show that aired in November of 1976, featuring many of my hits. Soon after I had to jump on a plane to the UK to star in Big Top Show at Windsor Castle. I worked with Elton John and he was a hoot, very funny, warm, and kind - just delightful. I even invited him to be on my TV show, Hollywood Nights, in the US with Tina Turner, Andy Gibb, Cliff Richard, Toni Tennille and the late, great Karen Carpenter who became one of my dearest friends.\n\nI still miss Karen a lot to this day. She and I became friends immediately. I was drawn to her terrific sense of humour and, of course, her extraordinary talent. She was quirky and fun, and we really enjoyed each other's company. Karen's lush voice was truly astonishing and reached the depths of my heart. We talked about what she wanted for her life and what I wanted from mine. No topic was off limits.\n\nShe got married and it sadly ended fourteen months later. That's when the anorexia really hit her hard. She became so thin it was frightening, but she still mustered the guts to divorce her husband, break out on her own and move to New York for treatment. I was so proud of strong and determined Karen. I truly believed she was on the road to recovery. She had the most gorgeous townhouse she was putting the finishing touches on. She adored anything Disney, so her house was full of all whimsical things, and beautifully done.\n\nThe last time I saw her, we were both staying at the Drake Hotel in New York and she looked so much better. She had gained some weight and was bouncing back, shopping, laughing and doing all the things she used to do. It was one of those moments where you sigh with relief, and I truly believed that the crisis had passed. I was in Los Angeles, listening to my car radio on the way to a restaurant for a lunch meeting with Pat [Farrar], when I heard that Karen had died. It was as if the sky fell to earth. My stomach hit the ground. This couldn't be possible. I had a date to see her the very next day. Devastated, I arrived at the restaurant and cried all the way through our lunch. Pat tried to comfort me, but I was inconsolable. Karen was so young and full of hope and promise.\n\nKaren Carpenter's death was a great loss, not only to her family and friends, but also to everyone graced with her voice. We will never know what she could have done artistically, which was sad for everyone around the globe. She was bursting with talent and creativity, but that was only part of it. She was also a kind and authentic human being. I've always wanted to respect Karen's privacy and I know that her struggle was a hard one. Perhaps there can be a positive from such a terrible tragedy: her death marked the beginning of raising awareness about anorexia and body image. Little did I know that later in my life, I'd be confronted with this insidious illness with my own daughter.\n\nKaren shined a bright light on anorexia, which allowed so many others to heal, including my own Chloe. Karen never got a chance to tell her story, but I'm proud of my daughter who is working on telling her own. We have Karen to thank for all the lives that have been saved after women and men found treatment and acceptance from their families and society.\n\nOne thing remains: I still miss my friend.\n\nI know there are quite a few Olivia fans on this site (calling @Rick-An Ordinary Fool) and I thought I'd share the section of her new autobiography in which she talks about Karen.

I knew they were friends but not that they were this close. Olivia says some very nice, heartfelt things about their friendship. Made me smile."
