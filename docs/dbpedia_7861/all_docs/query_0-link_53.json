But she doesn't know that yet...\n\n1971...we find her again a few years later for the official debut. The first title of a decade which will prove incredible for young Olivia...\n\n1971 ... completely surreal beginnings in Folko-country mode. We are 10,000 light years from Grease ...\n\n1971 ... one is already a huge star and the other will soon become one. We therefore suspect that the reunion of these 2 talents would necessarily give something of the most interesting !\n\n1972...a year 1972 which will not be able to match the year 1971 in terms of success but that doesn't matter, the main thing is that the dynamic is now well in place...\n\n1972...this revisited version of Ricky Nelson's title dating from 1959 will be little talked about but it will at least have the merit of existing...\n\n1973...new luxury cover this time of the title by John Denver dating from the year 1971. The copy will not surpass the original but is not devoid of interest, that's clear...\n\n1973...a year where young Olivia's look evolved, that's obvious ! On the other hand, on the music side, things are not getting better...\n\n1974...and yes, as incredible as it may seem, she will participate in the Eurovision Song Contest for England even though she is Australian. A competition where she will finish 4th...\n\n1974 ... evolution is slow, very slow but certain. We will therefore have to be patient to see her 'explode'\n\n1974 ... his first planetary hit thanks to this ballad which allows her to offer a much more 'trendy' face...\n\n1975 ... the hits are linked at the Speed Big S. The look and the style are refined more and more. The best is yet to come, that's for sure !\n\n1975...a series of very high caliber ballads which allows him to once again gain momentum. It is clear that the best is yet to come...\n\n1975...a beautiful and big year 1975 which mixes quantity and quality. Everything works perfectly and everything goes smoothly but surely...\n\n1975...here she revisits Linda Hargrove's title from 1973 and her version is far from unworthy, that's clear. Good work once again...\n\n1976 ... that, ballads side, it is on that she passed Mistress in the matter. It may have to accelerate a little bit anyway ...\n\n1976...come on, we won't blame her, one last little folk-country hit before moving on to ONJ Season 2. A season 2 which will differ radically from season 1...\n\n1976...that's it, it's quivering, it's clear ! The tempo picks up, it all smells good ! The metamorphosis is underway...\n\n1976...for the moment the metamorphosis is barely visible but it will be visible later and in what way ! A total transformation !\n\n1977...it's really hard to imagine what awaits in 1 year as things seem frozen at this stage. At least in appearance...\n\n1977...the last steps of Olivia, the wise and quiet. We're going to find another radically different one on the next title...\n\n1978 ... Sandy for ever! Planetary consecration thanks to this incredible film, with the most simplistic scenario but with contagious freshness and carefreeness. Surely one of the most representative movie of the 70s. MO-NU-MEN-TAL !\n\n1978 ... fate offered her a golden role with this character of Sandy, a role that will change her life forever. 2nd cult title for a movie that is no less ... cult !\n\n1978 ... and 1, and 2 and 3 cult titles ! This movie soundtrack is absolutely oufissime and will go down in history as one of the most incredible there is. The singer could not dream of a better gift from heaven !\n\n1978 ... an exceptional year 1978 in every way! After having triumphed in Grease, the singer continues in stride with an enormous solo title which will surely remain as one of her best titles. There is nothing to say, when the sky decided to spoil you ...\n\n1979 ... the pretty Olivia temporarily resumes its folko-country register, but this time remixed with Fleetwood Mac sauce. And it works too !\n\n1979 ... certainly, the year 1979 will not know the level of success of the year 1978 but what is certain is that the singer is on an incredible dynamic that has not finished wearing her !\n\n1979...a decade which ends in Country mode before the big switch to Dance mode during the following decade...\n\n1980...when 2 huge stars of the moment meet, the result is inevitably up to par with this title full of finesse and lightness...\n\n1980...we take the same ones and start again in the same register. This title will perform a little less than its predecessor but regardless the quality is required once again...\n\n1980 ... the 1970s saw it 'explode', the 1980s made her a definitive legend. Starting with this title which positions her ideally for the continuation of events ...\n\n1980 ... and the ideal sequel, here it is ! Here she signs an HUGE hit that smashes everything in its path and cheerfully confirms its status as a phenomenon of the moment. So, Olivia, what do we say : thank you Electric Light Orchestra !\n\n1980 ... the same title but in a choreographed version. We have the right here to 6 minutes of pure happiness which make this title an event as much on the song side as on the dance side. MAS-TER-FUL !\n\n1980 ... a title that will go much more unnoticed than its predecessor, which it would have been a shame to hide. Here it is brought back to light and it's only fair...\n\n1980 ... when 2 huge stars of the moment meet, the result is necessarily up to par. Look, I seem to have said it already ...\n\n1981 ... what will surely remain his biggest Dance hit ! Here she signs a new mega hit that definitely consecrates her as one of the greatest singers of this decade. And of the XXth century in short! All carried by a So Eightie's clip !\n\n1982 ... the year with 3 top hits. Starting with this one. The aspiration provoked by the previous single allows her to walk on water ...\n\n1982 ... when we compare the Olivia of the early 70s with the Olivia of 82, the contrast is striking. Is it really the same ? Yes Yes...\n\n1982 ... a year that ends in style with this 3rd hit which spins at 200 km/h. Watch out for the heart attack ...\n\n1983...it will be difficult to compete with the previous year as the level of success has reached new heights but it will come more or less close...\n\n1983...especially thanks to this enormous title which will allow her to add a new prestigious star to a prize list which is beginning to number quite a few...\n\n1984...a year 1984 a little behind but the dynamic of success still remains and maintains her without too much difficulty in the leading pack...\n\n1984...their last association created the event. This won't really be the case this time even if it's always nice to see them singing together again...\n\n1985...in Femme Fatale mode. Will this be enough to revive Beauty's fledgling career ? Not sure, but it still allowed her to win a new star to add to her prize list...\n\n1986...a second part of the decade which will prove to be significantly less favorable with a drop in success that is severe to say the least...\n\n1986 ... slight air gap on the success side in the Charts despite this nice sweet title. The incredible dynamics which carried the singer until then is seriously weakening ...\n\n1988 ... it took 3 years to see her return to success. A comeback where we find an Olivia Newton John at the top of her form. Not sure that it lasts a very long time ...\n\n1989 ... the end of a decade full of finesse and softness. Despite this title with obvious quality, the dropout in the Charts is growing from year to year. Not necessarily auspicious ...\n\n1992 ... new decade change and Sandy is still there. Less and less present but still there. What a journey since 'If not for you' !\n\n1992 ... an unexpected flashback with more than certain quality titles. Like what, everything happens to who knows how to wait ...\n\n1994 ... well, this time, it is indeed his last notorious hit. But what a career ! When we take up the little folko-country debut of little Olivia and this last title in Euro Beat mode, we realize the path traveled by this extraordinary artist !\n\n1995...we must still remember that she started her career in 1966, which is still starting to add up to quite a lot...\n\n1995...another nice title from these 2 inseparable people who love to sing together, it is clear...\n\n1998 ... the adventure will continue but much more in the shadows and far, very far, from the summit of the Charts. Afterwards, some artists are largely satisfied with it ...\n\n1998 ... the adventure will especially continue in a musical mode which sees her returning to its origins and its fundamentals. Hence an inevitable drop in audience among the general public ...\n\n2002 ... we still have to remember that she started her career in 1966 and that we are in 2002 ! Even if the best years are now behind, she begins her 5th decade of career with undisguised enthusiasm and we can only congratulate her for that !\n\n2002 ... the beginning of the 2000s will be combined with many. The whole on titles full of finesse and lightness which shows once again that she has not lost any of her talent in the register of 'emotional' titles ...\n\n2002 ... duets my faith very nice but which will bring her no more than that. Too bad because there is quality and an obvious desire to do well ...\n\n2005 ... the years go by without anything changing now. She stays in her comfort zone even if it necessarily marginalizes her. After that, it's up to her to know what's good for her or not ...\n\n2005 ... everything is stable in the Newton-John galaxy. Everything must now be only calm and voluptuousness, the end of the \"Grease\" years and its frenzied rhythms ...\n\n2006 ... we find her once again in her favorite register. And given what she continues to offer, we take, we take !\n\n2006 ... until the end she will have played in the same register. Afterwards, she at least has the merit of still being there when many others of her time have already disappeared body and soul for decades ...\n\n2007...any good self-respecting discography must have its share of special Christmas titles. Concerning her, it will be particularly careful and qualitatively most interesting...\n\n2007...it must be said that the opposite would have been frankly surprising. Even in this very particular field she manages to excel...\n\n2007...as a general rule this is the kind of opus that we find in the 2nd part of an artist's career and very often it is made up of covers of standards already covered thousands of times. This time it will be really different for her and so much the better...\n\n2008 ... the exception that makes the rule, here she accelerates the tempo in an unexpected way to say the least. A rhythmic parenthesis that we can only appreciate at its true value ...\n\n2009 ... a parenthesis quickly closed on the acceleration of the tempo. She returns almost immediately to her comfort zone, the zone in which she feels the most sheltered at first sight ...\n\n2011 ... and here she is in this new decade 2010. When she started in 1966, who could have imagined that she would still be there in 2011? Not many people, that's for sure ...\n\n2015 ... and here she is back in Ultra Dance mode, but what happens to her ? When the young generation decides to push the song with the legend, here is the result. Bluffing !\n\n2018 ... the young generation-legend duets allow the singer to stay connected with the musical world. For how long, that's another question ...\n\n2021 ... while with each title we tell ourselves that it will surely be the last, she comes back again and again afterwards. Once again the proof with this new duo, a duo that works quite well once again. But this time, it will be the last...\n\n2022...\n\n2023...\n\n2023...\n\n2023...\n\nTop Bonus I\n\nTop Bonus II\n\nTop Bonus III\n\nTop Bonus : the story of a lifetime I...\n\nTop Bonus : the story of a lifetime II...\n\nTop Bonus : the story of a lifetime III...\n\nTop Bonus : the story of a lifetime IV...\n\nTop Bonus : the story of a lifetime V...\n\nWiki :\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Newton-John\n\nFacebook Page :\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/olivianewtonjohn/\n\nGreatest Hits :\n\nhttps://www.deezer.com/us/artist/5632\n\nDiscography :"
