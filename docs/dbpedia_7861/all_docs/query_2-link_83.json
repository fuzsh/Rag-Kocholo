What more can you ask for from an artist. Especially one singing the great hits of America’s Troubadour. If you ever get the chance to “hang around” with Jim Curry as he plays the music of the great John Denver, I highly recommend it.” –kevin@utahconcertreview.com\n\nCurry has delighted audiences for over 23 years.
