        "text": "BROOMFIELD, Colo.—Olivia Newton-John is set to host a benefit concert celebrating the late John Denver as he becomes the first inductee of the Colorado Music Hall of Fame on April 21.\n\nNewton-John, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Lee Ann Womack and John Oates are among those scheduled to perform at the concert, which will be held in the Denver suburb of Broomfield.\n\nComposer Lee Holdridge will lead the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra in a tribute performance, and some of Denver’s hits will be performed by collaborators Bill Danoff, who co-wrote “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” and John Sommers, who wrote “Thank God I’m A Country Boy.”\n\nSome proceeds from the concert will benefit the Cousteau Society, the Windstar Foundation and the University of Colorado’s music school."
