        "text": "For the first time in 15 years, John Denver returns to the concert stage. Not in physical form, but in an evening of music and memories in John Denver: A Rocky Mountain High Concert. The John Denver estate has created a touring tribute to the late singer/songwriter, performing in U.S. theaters Feb. 1-23. The basic idea is that archival video footage of Denver will accompany live performances by his former band members.\n\nInvolved in the tour is video projectionist/LD Scott Johnson of Tracer Visuals, who was initially approached by Brian Schwartz of Red Light Management for a different reason. John Denver was to be the first inductee into the Denver Music Hall of Fame when it opened in 2011, and the JD estate wanted to do something special for the inaugural event.\n\nJohnson says, “The JD estate has thousands of hours of archive footage from various performances, and they granted us permission to present some of the songs live. Olivia Newton-John was there, John Oates, as well as many other long time JD collaborators and friends. It was a really special night.”\n\nThe success of the idea led to taking it on the road, allowing fans to “see and hear” JD again in a live environment. “It’s really taking the live concert footage one step closer to the real thing — we are using the vocals and guitar from his show, and the band will be backing up these tracks to provide the live feel. There will be stories and slides of JD’s life as well — it’s all about honoring him and remembering his life and music.”\n\nThe stage set is “simple, yet effective,” Johnson says, with some risers and a video screen upstage center. “We are using a 12×16 screen hung upstage center, above and behind the drum riser, and projecting using a 12K lumen projector. We had considered using LED, but to get the kind of resolution we wanted, a projector was a better solution. There will also be some cyc lighting fabric to bounce off colors.”\n\nHis design concern really focuses on the screen, where John Denver will “live.” “In a theater setting it is relatively simple to focus lights in a way to keep beams off the screen. I just need a small window of darkness there to make the screen ‘pop.’ “\n\nDenver was a “big part” of his life, Johnson says. “He was such a great ambassador, speaking out for the environment and the oceans and farms; all needed that voice.”\n\n» Nook Imagines Dragons\n\nLD Nook Schoenfeld has designed the set and lighting for Imagine Dragons, who are on an upward trajectory with their hit, “It’s Time.”\n\n“The whole thing is based on the idea that I can fit a full set and lighting system in 10 feet of trailer space,” Schoenfeld says. “Everything’s pretty organic and melts into each other. The band wanted to be seen in a forest. But I decided I’d like the forest to change seasons. So we start out with a lush jungle look and evolve into a bare tree winter look halfway through. We carry just enough fixtures where we could do a show on someone’s patio if we wanted.”\n\nThe Night Visions tour runs Feb. 8-March 23 in the U.S., then UK/Europe to May. No patio dates on the nightclub itinerary yet, but they are playing a library theatre in the U.K. Justin Shaw from Providence, RI, who “has directed a few other tours for me and my friends,” will run the show on the road.\n\n» A Rose in the Hall of Fame\n\n“This is my year!” says LD Susan Rose. Excited about being a first-time awards presenter at the 2012 Parnelli Awards, she is also one of the six graduates honored for induction into the Full Sail University Hall of Fame for her contributions to the world of entertainment, media and the arts. The ceremony takes place Feb. 15 during a weeklong series of events on the campus at Winter Park, FL.\n\n“I am flying back from Australia from the Ringo Starr tour on Feb. 13 and returning to Australia Feb. 18 to finish the tour. We are touring New Zealand, Australia and Japan. The amazing people from Ringo’s tour and Full Sail believed in me so much and have made it possible for me to be in two places at one time on opposite sides of the world.”\n\nIn her singing career, she has starting shooting the music video for her album, This Is Who I Am. She will use additional footage from the Hall of Fame documentary and event in her final edit. The video, song and her promotional campaign will be launched in early spring, she says.\n\nAs a lighting designer, director and programmer, Rose has blossomed in her 23 years in the lighting world, but she actually graduated from Full Sail University with a focus on the recording arts. “I’m told I’m the first LD to be inducted into their Hall of Fame,” Rose says. “I actually studied sound because of my singing.” Rose graduated in 1989, and has since worked on tour with major artists including the aforementioned Ringo Starr and his All Starr Band, Louise Mandrell and Hank Williams Jr. TV specials include the Stellar Awards and the Dove Awards, and special events for the Walt Disney Company, Dollywood, SeaWorld and Nickelodeon."
