        "text": "Same with me, and those Guild jumbo 12-ers have a wonderfully shimmery tone. I love 'em. Those are the only other acoustic 12-ers that I like, Martin 12-ers being my absolute dream gits.\n\nSamilyn, I have to agree with you. But, have you ever played one of the old Framus (German made) 12-Strings. I had two of them back in the day. The first one (tobacco burst) was in a soft gig bag when I slipped on some ice carrying it and put my right elbow right through the back of it. The second one was the Framus Texan, spruce and rosewood. Dynamite sound......really honked.......had a narrow neck, too, like a standard 6 string........1 11/16\" I believe. Framus is out of business, but if not, I'd own one today. Sold my Texan back in '82 and have been kicking myself every day since. Don't have a picture to send you, but \"Google Images\" shows several Texans if you care to see one. BTW- The Texan, at the Army PX in 1968 cost me a whopping $92. And, the molded case for it was an additional $8. Try THAT today!! I sold it, 14 years later for a LOT more than that.\n\nSamilyn, I have to agree with you.

And, the molded case for it was an additional $8. Try THAT today!! I sold it, 14 years later for a LOT more than that.\n\nWow, Opa...those sound like some great gits.\n\nOh, man, sorry to hear about the elbow incident. That must have been heartbreaking.\n\nNo, I've never gotten to play a Framus, nor even seen anything other than a pic of one. Yup - just googled and the Texan is one cool looking git.\n\nPity there's too few of those wonderful old gits around. Nothing in the world like vintage tone, eh?\n\nJust wanted to say how much I love JDs first few albums.\n\nRocky Mountain High, Take Me To Tomorrow and Whose Garden Was This are all excellent albums. It's a shame he's better know here in the UK for his later work with Olivia Newton John and...erm...the Muppets!\n\nAnyone know if John played all the guitar parts on those albums? There's some really nice lines in e.g. Rocky Mountain High or Prisoners that I aspire to being able to play. Can't ever find good tabs for the early songs though, and I'm not skilled enough to work them out.\n\nDid he play mainly in dropped D? Sounds like DADGBD on Prisoners...is that right?\n\nI should add... when John passed away, I was getting about 180 e-mails per hour from JD fans around the world. I wrote a song in 1991 called \"The Bard\" and it was actually about John and his music. We had the same record producer for a time. John's music always meant so much to me, still does. So, I wrote the song... here are the lyrics:\n\nThere was an old man\n\nwas a teller of stories\n\nof visions of lands far away\n\nHis stories were songs\n\nfrom a lifetime of living\n\nthings he had seen in his day.\n\nThis man, he had wisdom\n\nfrom years he was living\n\nhis insights outnumbered his days\n\nHis songs, you could say,\n\nthey were much more than stories\n\nthey helped us to see on our way\n\nChorus\n\nThe Bard, the dreamer, the singer of songs\n\nabout treasures far better than gold\n\nFree for the taking for all, so we are told\n\nThe Bard, the dreamer the lover of children\n\nand all who are willing to give\n\nThe Bard sang songs about life, and how we should live\n\nThe children they sat\n\nat the feet of the minstrel\n\nHis songs filled them all with delight\n\nand the Bard he adored them,\n\nhe loved little children\n\nthey were precious, indeed, in his sight\n\nHe would sing them his songs\n\nabout magical kingdoms\n\nwhere good would prevail in the end\n\nHe would sing about castles\n\nknights in bright armor\n\ndefenders of truth and of men.\n\nChorus\n\nThen One night it ended\n\nthe Bard he was gone\n\nlike a night mist, the wind blows away\n\nBut his message lives on\n\nin the songs that he gave us\n\nand still helps us see on our way\n\nchorus (x2)\n\n----------note, I wrote this as if John was the minstrel teaching songs about life, just as the lyrics imply. The knight metaphor is really a hero to those that love the land and the wisdom of his message. The children are like those of Rhymes and Reasons. The people only understood the message after the bard was gone, but, the message lives on... it was John's legacy.\n\nThanks so much to all the JD fans who replied to my query. Appreciate very much the info you all provided about JD's guitars. I have a pic of him on the cover of one songbook with a steel guitar - anyone know what guitar that was and which songs were played on that instrument?\n\nFYI - I have been a long-time fan of the man and his music and have sung his tunes around the house (sometimes to my son's exasperation - generational thing) and am now learning to play on the guitar to accompany. I was in CA at the time of John's death (I lived and worked in the bay area) and went to the very moving candlelit ceremony in October, 1997 in Pacific Grove (near where his plane crashed) in memorium. It was hard to imagine that he would no longer sing those songs. Hope this isn't TMI - but thought I owed an explanation for the questions about his guitars - trying to find some of his sound again."
