        "text": "My Dad was, and still is, a big country music fan. My very early introduction to music consisted of Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Don Williams, Emilou Harris, Dolly Parton but above all of these was John Denver. His songs were the soundtrack of my childhood, and of all of the country music I heard in those early days it’s really only John’s that has stayed with me. You only have to listen to the opening bars and the groove of Song of Awen to realise what an influence on my music he has been.\n\nJohn Denver was a true country boy. Living in the mountains his inspiration came from the sights and sounds that surrounded him. Nature really is the best artist, and his lyrics and melodies manage to capture that essence of wildness that so many modern Pagans seek as part of their spiritual path. Add to that his voice, one of the purest voices in music with a natural vibrato and quality that I don’t think any other singer has matched since, and you have a near perfect singer/songwriter for a budding Bard. John Denver’s songs convey a connection with the Natural World that speaks directly to the heart. I regularly, even now, find tears of joy streaming down my face when I’m listening to his songs. I find myself nodding my head saying, “Yes! Yes! That’s it! You’ve got it, you understand!” Here are some examples of what I mean –\n\nThe Eagle and the Hawk\n\nI am the eagle, I live in high country\n\nIn rocky cathedrals that reach to the sky\n\nI am the hawk and there’s blood on my feathers\n\nBut time is still turning they soon will be dry\n\nAnd all of those who see me, all who believe in me\n\nShare in the freedom I feel when I fly\n\nCome dance with the west wind and touch on the mountain tops\n\nSail o’er the canyons and up to the stars\n\nAnd reach for the heavens and hope for the future\n\nAnd all that we can be and not what we are\n\nRocky Mountain High\n\nNow he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams\n\nSeeking grace in every step he takes\n\nHis sight has turned inside himself to try and understand\n\nThe serenity of a clear blue mountain lake\n\nAnd the Colorado rocky mountain high\n\nI’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky\n\nYou can talk to God and listen to the casual reply\n\nRocky mountain high\n\nSunshine on my Shoulders\n\nsunshine, on my shoulders – makes me happy\n\nsunshine, in my eyes – can make me cry\n\nsunshine, on the water – looks so lovely\n\nsunshine, almost always – makes me high\n\nif i had a day that i could give you\n\ni’d give to you a day just like today\n\nif i had a song that i could sing for you\n\ni’d sing a song to make you feel this way\n\nif i had a tale that i could tell you\n\ni’d tell a tale sure to make you smile\n\nif i had a wish that i could wish for you\n\ni’d make a wish for sunshine all the while\n\nHe started the Winstar Foundation, a charity that promoted sustainable living, back in 1976, and was a keen environmental activist. His song Annie’s Song is still one of the most romantic, beautiful love songs ever written. Who knows what other great songs lay in wait from the Awen of John Denver, but sadly we will never know as on 12th October 1997 he got into his experimental light aircraft which crashed, taking his life and with it, his genius. Forever missed, his music will always live on in the hearts of those who believe that ‘they would have been a poorer man if they never saw an eagle fly.’\n\nBlessed be John Denver."
