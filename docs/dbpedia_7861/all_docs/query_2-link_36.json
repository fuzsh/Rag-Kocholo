        "text": "On The Run\n\nhttp://www.gateschilipost.com/article/20150211/Sports/150219994/?Start=1\n\n\"Listening to the radio as we drove from a recent doctor’s appointment,\n\nOlivia Newton-John and John Travolta (a.k.a. Sandy and Danny) declared their undying love in the Grease hit, “You’re the One that I Want.” Suddenly, I’m 16.\n\nAnd just as suddenly, I hate my body. That’s right, Olivia; those skin-tight leather pants, that off-the-shoulder crop top — after 35 years, your slinky getup still makes me feel self-conscious and ashamed of my inferior exterior.\n\nNo one had to tell me that I didn’t measure up. Before I could recover from the flashback, the song faded and the late Karen Carpenter began her classic, “Only Yesterday.” Remember Karen? She died at age 32 from heart failure due to anorexia. “In my own time, nobody knew the pain I was going through…”\n\nIt was a surreal, poignant moment of clarity. I cried for my beloved, for myself and for every woman who felt that our worth was measured by our waistline.Words have terrific, irrevocable power, and images can linger forever in our memories.\n\nHow we talk to ourselves and to each other matters. So let’s compliment each other’s strength and admire our tenacity,\n\nbut look past the outside packaging to see the gifts inside.\"\n\nFrom Orlando Sentinel, July 1st, 1985:\n\nSinger Richard Carpenter Sets His Sights On The Future\n\nJuly 1, 1985|By Frank Spotnitz\n\nRichard Carpenter is back in the studio to record his first new album since sister Karen died in February 1984 from anorexia nervosa.\n\nCarpenter said it still is difficult for him to talk about Karen's death, explaining that when she died it was as much of a shock to her family as to the public\n\nHe prefers to talk about the success he and his younger sister had, including a decade of hits such as ''Rainy Days and Mondays'' and ''Top of the World.''\n\nIf he wanted to, Carpenter could put a small dent in that wholesome image he has been stamped with since ''Close to You'' hit No. 1 in 1970.\n\nHe smokes cigarettes, for one thing, and then there's his taste in music, which, as you might expect includes people like Perry Como, but surprisingly has room for bands like the Mothers of Invention and Led Zeppelin, too.\n\nThese revelations only put a dent in Carpenter's image, however, because from all appearnces most of that wholesome image is deserved.\n\nCarpenter, 38, still lives in Downey, Calif., where his parents raised him and Karen since Richard was 12.\n\nHis admittedly non-controversial hobbies include collecting classic cars and, ''well, I bowl.''\n\nPutting what he listens to aside, he is only comfortable performing in the softer style for which the Carpenters are known. Carpenter said his first solo album, which he is now recording, will be in the same vein.\n\nHe recently gave his blessings to a double-record compilation, Yesterday Once More, in which he remixed some of their hits,\n\nand a compilation of 15 promotional films to be sold as a videocassette.\n\nThere also is enough unreleased material for another Carpenters album, most of it recorded from 1980 to 1982, but release of that still is uncertain.\n\nMore definite plans are under way for a television film about Karen Carpenter's life. Carpenter is co-producing the film and working with the writer on how to tell her story.\n\nCarpenter said he and his sister never set out to project the ''goody- goody'' image that he believes eventually hurt their career.\n\n'The music was soft and we just looked kind of like your average two people walking down the street,'' he said. ''So really the press, of course, they labeled us.\n\nIt kind of snowballed after that.''\n\nThe media's depictions smarted a bit at first, but the Carpenters grew used to it.\n\nThen came the disco wave of the late '70s and Carpenters songs, which had withstood competition from psychedelia and heavy metal, could no longer crack the Top 10.\n\nHe said he is not sure that the time is better now for one of his albums,\n\nbut then ''I don't want to sit down and say, 'I wonder if this is a good time and look at the charts and everything.'\n\n''If we had done that, we never would have put out 'Close to You' because that was different than anything that was on the air at that time.''\n\nCarpenter expects to release his record by next spring, following up with a tour.\n\n''I'm going to miss Karen, of course, both personally and professionally as I have since she passed on,'' he said. ''But I know what I want to do and how to do it. And I'm rather excited about it.''\n\nPerforming With:\n\nDisney All-American College Orchestra at Epcot Center July 19-21."
