I wouldn't totally subscribe to that theory since it took her a massive Long Live Love misstep the following year and Eurovision fiasco to get her vision (pun intended) clear (the 1975 move to US at Helen Reddy's advice was THE best decision in her career until 1978 at least) but Let me be there is classic country ONJ as we all know and love it. The title track is an infectious monster, later covered by Elvis and an instant classic but there's much magic on that record IMHO. It opens with the stunning version of Country Roads take me home which I prefer to John Denver's original by a mile. Now don't get me wrong, Denver was a great writer but there's something about Livvy's voice that adds a dreamy clear water stream quality to the tune. And of course the moment the choir explodes from your speakers is one of your great WOW audiofile/show off your system to unexpecting guests thrills (don't we all have a few?). Llivvy fully comes into her own as a singer here with IMHO the most magical version of Amoreuse ever recorded and Farrar's Music makes my day being simply sublime. Still I don't think this record offers a quantum leap from 1972 Olivia LP but it's a strong natural progression and an LP worthy of future superstar.\n\nWe're on the same page with this one, antonkk. It is a bit of a quantum leap for me though, with the 'Music Makes My Day' LP marking a significant progression after the relative stumble of ‘Olivia’. The English folk songbooks were mined less obviously than on the previous records and as a result of Farrar and Welch (and now fellow Shadows member Alan Hawkshaw who joins the ranks as a producer) casting the net a little wider, the sound of ‘Music Makes My Day’ prefigures the FM country-pop of her subsequent American recordings. The song selection is stronger throughout with nearly every cut presenting as a possible single release, even if few are as instantly memorable as ‘Let Me Be There’. It is no surprise as to why that song enamoured American radio with its spirited hook and a return of the memorable interplay between Olivia’s sweet soprano and Mike Sammes’ bassy voice, which had lay dormant since ‘Banks Of The Ohio’ but would go on to define her early ‘country’ hits.\n\nPerhaps burned by the reception to ‘Olivia’, there appears to be a greater sense of playing to Olivia’s strengths with both her vocals and the arrangements on this album. Gone are the novelty tunes that polluted the previous LP; the closest ‘Music Makes My Day’ comes is the Eurovision-lite of Farrar’s ‘Brotherly Love’, but with a few handclaps, an incessant tambourine and an ingratiating (!) melody, it at least sounds more fully realised. Olivia takes another stab at morning-after pathos on ‘Amoureuse’, and with a more melancholy delivery and less intrusive backing vocals this lament succeeds in a way that ‘Angel Of The Morning’ couldn’t. Although it didn’t become an evergreen in her setlists, Olivia would revisit the song as a duet with Elaine Paige on ‘Elaine And Friends’ in 2010.\n\nThere are a number of beautiful easy listening pop songs sprinkled throughout the album that suggest John and Bruce had finally worked out these were the songs best suited to her vocals. The final three inclusions on the LP are the best examples of these. John’s title track is a particularly lovely; using bass and tambourine rather than drums to create the beat lends a muted warmth to the song whilst Olivia floats on top of it, gently building to the soaring riff she sings in her head voice. It is about as perfect a song as she had recorded up to this point. A UK review deservedly praised ‘Leaving’ the most highly, stating with a knowing nod to her growing American success that she deserved a Grammy for her vocal performance alone. Like many others in Olivia’s 1970s discography, the Flett/Fletcher track no doubt landed in Olivia’s lap due to the Cliff Richard connection (they wrote ‘Power To All Our Friends’ for Cliff the same year). It is certainly one of the most dynamic tracks on the album, and Olivia’s richly multitracked coda is worth the price of the LP alone. Another Don McLean cover cut from the same cloth as ‘Winterwood’ turns up in the form of ‘If We Try’ to close the second side of the LP and it is just as lovely.\n\nOlivia’s own songwriting continues to mature, as evidenced by the sprawling, five-minute ‘Rosewater’ where she articulates the decay of a relationship through the metaphor of the house the protagonist shares with her lover. Given the autobiographical slant of most of Olivia’s writing, it was probably written about her relationship with Bruce Welch which ended not long afterwards. Although it boasts another repetitive melody like ‘Changes’, the wonderful arrangement gives ‘Rosewater’ enough sense of journey to justify the song length.\n\nWhere the album shows a real progression is in the uptempo tunes. ‘Heartbreaker’ is easily the most ‘pop’ song in her early catalogue and it probably wouldn’t have sounded greatly out of place on any of her albums over the ensuing five years. The country flavoured songs ‘You Ain’t Got The Right’ and ‘Feeling Best’ keep the tempo up and give Olivia a chance for a couple of rousing performances that sound more natural than on the previous record. However, the highlight of the country material, as antonkk said, is ‘Take Me Home Country Roads’. It is a genius pairing of songwriter and artist with the choral backing vocals and Olivia’s crystalline voice enlarging John Denver’s song in a way that makes it quite separate from his original reading. I don’t know what American listeners thought of an Anglo-Australian girl singing about the landmarks of West Virginia (very little, judging from its poor showing on the charts) but the single’s success in the UK and Japan suggests record buyers without a cultural bias were entranced by it.\n\nAs with ‘Olivia’, the cover art was well chosen to show off Olivia’s unquestionable beauty. The photo with her arms crossed on the back is magnificent, one of many photographs of Olivia that achieves sultriness without being the slightest bit provocative. As stated earlier in this thread, the 1998 Festival remastering is much better than the original CD pressing, but the ’48 Original Tracks’ European CD compilation is the best place to find audiophile (or close to it) CD versions of the tracks on this album. It also comes complete with the non-album track ‘Maybe Then I’ll Think Of You’, recorded around the same time. If it had included ‘The Biggest Clown’ and the original 1972 version of ‘Sail Into Tomorrow’, both of which remain unreleased on CD, it would have been the most definitive collection of the recording sessions for her first three British albums.\n\nx\n\nMusic Makes My Day/Let Me Be There\n\nWell, first of all, the sleeve is exquisite. MMMD was my second Olivia LP, purchased in the summer of '75. As I perused the paltry Olivia selection in my local record shop, I chose MMMD simply because it had the best cover. Having said that, the famous back cover shot that eventually became the front sleeve of the US comp If You Love Me, Let Me Know, DOES look better on the latter LP! They've obviously fiddled with the colouring making it brighter and Olivia look a bit blonder and it totally works. Always thought Olivia looked a bit bug-eyed and-here's a word that never gets associated with Olivia-plainer on the MMMD version!\n\nSecondly, they were SO right to change the title to Let Me Be There... It means little now, but Music Makes My Day sounds like some horrible middle-aged LP that someone like Shirley Bassey or Max Bygraves would produce.\n\nAs for the actual record, I've made no secret of how much I adore it. To me, it's better than Come On Over, Clearly Love and MAGTB. There's a MASSIVE upsurge in the quality of the songs and Olivia's performance of them from the first 2 albums. She brings some real wallop to the excellent Feeling Best, which I would have put out as a single. Even on the Eurovsion-y Brotherly Love (I LOVE Brotherly Love!) she sounds confident and powerful and it's SO damn catchy!\n\nAs a (male) DJ of the time said when playing the song ,though 'the last thing you'd want off Olivia Newton-John is BROTHERLY love!'\n\nAmoureuse is another magical moment. The song had been a big UK hit in 1973 for Kiki Dee and I love her version (very under-rated singer, Kiki), mainly because I'm a sucker for strings and orchestral flourishes! Olivia's arrangement is far more vocal reliant and, ahem, in keeping with the lyrics of the song and for the first time on this LP, on songs like this and the earthy You Ain't Got The Right, she sounds like she's actually lived them...\n\nBeing On The Losing End is another stand-out. I love Olivia's world-weary vocals on this and it's such a beautiful song. Leaving is another beauty. She sounds 10 years older here than she did on the previous years Olivia album. And the slinky Heartbreaker is so good that it wouldn't have sounded out of place (as would a number of the tracks here) on Totally Hot.\n\nThe singles Take Me Home Country Roads and Let Me Be There are obviously here. The former made #15 in the UK charts at the start of 1973 and it's an interesting treatment of, even then, a much covered song. Don't know if I prefer it to Denver's original but it's strong enough to stand on it's own, as any good cover should be. LMBT, so over familiar now, it's easy to forget what a perfect song it was for Olivia. Beautifully sung and produced, it's easy to see why it was both a pop and a country hit. Love the way her voice soars on this.\n\nEven on her self-penned Rosewater Olivia shows growth. A much more mature and (even) darker piece than the previous years Changes.\n\nThe only song I'm not struck on is the title track. It's a pretty number but does sound a bit twee in Olivia's hands. It's also a little out of place on this fine LP.\n\nSo, there it is. Whatever title you want to give the album it's a stunner. One of Olivia's best albums and not just of the 70s. 5/5.\n\nAttached Files:\n\n74RMONJ23rdMarch.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n109.9 KB\n\nViews:\n\n29\n\n74RMONJ20thJuly2.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n148.6 KB\n\nViews:\n\n29\n\n74NMEONJ30thMarch.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n106.2 KB\n\nViews:\n\n26\n\nLONG LIVE LOVE (1974)\n\n\"Free the People\" (Barbara Keith)\n\n\"Angel Eyes\" (Tony Macaulay/Keith Potger)\n\n\"Country Girl\" (Alan Hawkshaw/Peter Gosling)\n\n\"Someday\" (Gary Benson/David Mindel)\n\n\"God Only Knows\" (Brian Wilson/Tony Asher)\n\n\"Loving You Ain't Easy\" (Leather/Saker/Sulsh)\n\n\"Home Ain't Home Anymore\" (John Farrar/Peter Robinson)\n\n\"Have Love Will Travel\" (Roger Greenaway/Geoff Stephens\n\n\"I Honestly Love You\" (Peter Allen/Jeff Barry)\n\n\"Hands Across the Sea\" (Findon/Wilkins)\n\n\"The River's Too Wide\" (Bob Morrison)\n\n\"Long Live Love\" (Valerie Avon/Harold Spiro)\n\nThis is by far my least favorite ONJ record from the 70's and IMHO her only big misstep. This was the record that found Livvy and her team being seduced by BBC and UK Top 40 industry in participating in a stupid Eurovision contest and what worse adopting their music to continental europop tastes of the time. With a few exceptions the wonderful rootsy country pop is replaced here with euro singalong schmaltz and IMHO the 6 Eurovision entry songs is the worst thing she did at the time and nearly derailed her career. Even the album cover is cheesy as hell. Another song I totally dislike here is the karaoke pointless cover of God only Knows. The good stuff is all more american-oriented and rootsy - Free the People, Country Girl (why wasn't THIS a single???) and the gospel-like River's Too Wide. Also this LP makes the debut of the song we all know - I honestly love you. I never cared for Livvy's version frankly, Peter Allen did this one so much better but I'm glad it was a hit. Overall the Eurovision fiasco turned to be THE turning point in Livvy's career and in the end the best thing that happened to her. She was so pissed off with british industry that she took Helen Reddy's advice and bought a one way ticket to US which was the best career decision possible (ironically it was Helen who introduced Livvy to Grease producer 3 years later so I guess Olivia owes her 2 most important career moves in her life!). So the outcome of 1974 Eurovision wasn't so bad after all - the world got ABBA and US got Olivia! In less than a year she was America's new darling and a superstar. As for Long Live Love - well, she revisit the track during her 2013 UK tour and surprisingly it doesn't sound so bad now!\n\nAnd I thought I was hard on the Olivia album! I think what happened was Olivia accepted the offer of the Eurovision (quite an honour back then, really) UK entry in 1973 when she hadn't cracked America and her UK hits were drying up. I think it was a bit of a last chance scenario for her, TBH. Of course, after this, Let Me Be There hit big in the States and superstardom followed. I'm SURE that had the Eurovision offer come as little as a year later, Olivia would have politely declined!"
