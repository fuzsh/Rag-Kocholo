        "text": "Livvy is touring in Japan now. Tomorrow she's in Tokyo.\n\nHere's the song list.\n\nI Honestly Love You (Intro)\n\nHave You Never Been Mellow\n\nXanadu\n\nMagic\n\nLove You Crazy\n\nSam\n\nMedley:\n\nIf Not For You\n\nBanks Of The Ohio\n\nLet Me Be There\n\nPlease Mr. Please\n\nJolene\n\nPhysical\n\nI'll Come Running\n\nNot Gonna Give Into It\n\nDon't Cut Me Down\n\nSomewhere Over The Rainbow (Duet with Chloe)\n\nReason To Cry (Duet with Chloe)\n\nIt Takes Two (Duet with Chloe)\n\nMedley:\n\nTake Me Home Country Roads\n\nClose To You\n\nDon't Stop Believin'\n\nSuddenly\n\nYou're The One That I Wnat\n\nHopelessly Devoted To You\n\nSummer Nights\n\n(Encore)\n\nCome On Over\n\nI Honestly Love You\n\nJust can't wait to hear how she sings CTY and talks about Karen.\n\nSince Oliva & Karen were good friends, Olivia started doing a segment in her shows a few years ago about friends she had lost. She speaks about John Denver, her duet partner on \"Fly Away\", and Karen. She used to speak about missing them, and she did a short version of \"Close to you\" with only piano.\n\nIt was a nice tribute to both John & Karen.\n\nJeff\n\nThanks to Jeff and PJ for your input.\n\nTo tell you the truth, this was the first time I saw Olivia at her concert.\n\nShe was and is GORGEOUS! I've fallen in love with her.Of course before Karen there's no one else for me. And to think it could have been Karen, it makes my heart ache.\n\nShe started singing Take Me Home Country Roads and then Close To You,\n\nmentioning both these two acts are famous in Japan and they were good friends of hers , for whom she would like to sing them.\n\nShe didn't mention either John nor Karen but maybe it was unnecessary.\n\nAnd she changed the words WALK BY to PASS BY.\n\nHer phrasing seemed to be made to sound like Karen's, which was pleasant to me.\n\nOther serendipity was two pictures of Karen and Livvy in the concert program, one being the same as that Chris bears with his name on this board and the other even\n\nwith Richard and Robin Gibb, perhaps a shot from her Hollywood Nights show.\n\nHi Sakura,\n\nOh how I wish I could also see this. This is a very rare thing too. ONJ has never released any kind of live material here in the US for very very long time at least video. So this is very special for Japan. You should ask some of your friends there, maybe someone has this dijital thing & can tape for you.\n\nGood luck. Let me know if you hear of anyone that saw it, id be curious, was your show actually taped? Maybe it's your concert. Ha Ha\n\nI went to Livvy's concert in Tokyo and there was no photos of Karen shown during the Close To You segment.\n\nBut they showed the photo of Karen in a white sweat shirt holding her knees shown in the concerts at Osaka and Fukuoka.\n\nSo I missed the half of the excitement of the moment!\n\nI don't know why but maybe something went wrong with the pix.\n\nI'm afraid NHK will air the concert in Tokyo.\n\nHi Chris,\n\nMaybe it's me\n\nMaybe it's just......\n\nYes, my concert!\n\nOlivia started the concert at 7:12pm and she finished singing at 9:10. TV program is for 90 minutes.\n\nIf you go to Only Olivia's message board, you will find a Olivia fan who says that he can have copy made for you.\n\nSakura\n\nHi, Chris. In fact I don't have such equipment as to see the show.\n\nBut a friend of mine let me know that she heard me shouting \"Beautiful\" at Olivia. So this TV show doesn't provide you with a chance to see the photos of the deceased artists that Olivia dedicated their songs to.\n\nThat's what I've been talking about.\n\nYes, some say they showed Karen sqatting on a sofa on the big screen during the song.\n\nYou can locate this photo if you have Essential Collection and see the booklet to it. Ciao!\n\nOn Olivia's TV program of NHK, they say that they show the opening photos on a big screen. In concert we saw many Olivia's photos with her friends. I would like to know how many Karen's photos were on TV. They say that Olivia was beautiful. But someone, who watched the program on Cable TV, says that sound is not so good.\n\nMerv Griffin Show September the 1st, 1981\n\nMerv(to Karen): You and Olivia have been friends for a long time.\n\nOlivia: Long Time! were so old.\n\nKaren: What't it been now 9 years?\n\nOlivia: It's a long time.\n\nRichard: 10 years, we met in Annabelles in London.\n\nOlivia: In London, we met in London before I even came over here.\n\nAnd Karen talked about Olivia, Karen said that LIVVY wants......\n\nDid Karen always call Olivia Livvy?\n\nI asked in another topic. I do again.\n\nWhat song did Karen and Richard play on Merv Griffin Show?\n\nDid Olivia sing?\n\nSakura\n\nI saw Olivia in concert in Oakland, Ca. in 1973, she was great, so energetic. I still like her today and wish she would record some new songs. I doubt this will interest you guys, but Olivia had great influence on young women in those days, they copied her hair styles ( and there were many) her clothes and her makeup. When she did the \"Physical\" video you suddenly saw girls wearing sweatbands and leg warmers all around the country, and I suppose the world. And best of all she is a breast cancer survivor!\n\nChris-An Ordinary Fool said:\n\nOh how I wish I could also see this. This is a very rare thing too. ONJ has never released any kind of live material here in the US for very very long time at least video.\n\nThe last thing I remember seeing is a live concert that was recorded just after her Physical album...it was one of the first laserdiscs I bought. Haven't followed her very much, other than her greatest hits packages.\n\nRudy said:\n\nThe last thing I remember seeing is a live concert that was recorded just after her Physical album...it was one of the first laserdiscs I bought.

It was quite a thrill to hear a stereo soundtrack emanating from a TV/audio setup.\n\nHarry\n\nNP: Everything Must Go, Steely Dan"
