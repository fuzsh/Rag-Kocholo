It was released as a single performed by Denver on April 12, 1971, peaking at number two on Billboard's US Hot 100 singles for the week ending August 28, 1971. The song was a success on its initial release and was certified Gold by the RIAA on August 18, 1971, and Platinum on April 10, 2017.[3] The song became one of John Denver's most popular songs. It has continued to sell, with over 1.8 million digital copies sold in the United States.[4]\n\nIn 1998, the 1971 recording by John Denver was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[5]\n\nThe song is considered a symbol of West Virginia. In March 2014, it became one of the four official state anthems of West Virginia.[6]\n\nAlthough considered by the people of West Virginia as a representation of their state, the song much more likely reflects on the writers' time in west Virginia (aka western Virginia). This is most notable when John Denver references both the Blue Ridge Mountains and Shenandoah river. W.Va. has a very small portion of each, whereas western Virginia is home to a notable portion of the Blue Ridge Mountains and Shenandoah river.\n\nIn 2023, the song was selected by the Library of Congress for inclusion in the National Recording Registry.[7]\n\nComposition\n\n[edit]\n\nInspiration for the title line had come while Taffy Nivert and Bill Danoff, who were married, were driving along Clopper Road in Montgomery County, Maryland to a gathering of Nivert's family in Gaithersburg, with Nivert behind the wheel while Danoff played his guitar. \"I just started thinking, country roads, I started thinking of me growing up in western New England and going on all these small roads,\" Danoff said. \"It didn't have anything to do with Maryland or anyplace.\"[8]\n\nTo Danoff, the lyric \"(t)he radio reminds me of my home far away\" in the bridge is quintessentially West Virginian, an allusion to when he listened to the program Saturday Night Jamboree, broadcast from Wheeling, West Virginia, on WWVA at his home in Springfield, Massachusetts during his childhood in the 1950s.[9]\n\nDanoff was influenced by friend and West Virginian actor Chris Sarandon and members of a West Virginia commune who attended Danoff's performances.[9] Of the commune members, Danoff remarked, \"They brought their dogs and were a very colorful group of folks, but that is how West Virginia began creeping into the song.\" While the song was inspired by Danoff's upbringing in Springfield, Massachusetts, he \"didn't want to write about Massachusetts because [he] didn't think the word was musical.\"[9]\n\nStarting December 22, 1970, Denver was heading the New Year's bill at The Cellar Door, with Fat City opening for him, just as Denver had opened at the same club for then-headliner David Steinberg. After the club's post-Christmas reopening night on Tuesday, December 29 (Cellar Door engagements ran from Tuesday to Sunday, and this booking was for two weeks), the three returned to the couple's apartment for an impromptu jam. On the way, Denver's left thumb was broken in a collision. He was rushed to the emergency room, where the thumb was splinted. When they returned to the apartment, Denver said he was \"wired, you know.\"[10]\n\nWhen Danoff and Nivert ran through what they had of the song they had been working on for about a month, planning to sell to Johnny Cash, Denver decided he had to have it, which prompted them to abandon plans for the sale.[11] The verses and chorus were still missing a bridge, so the three of them went about finishing.\n\nNivert got out an encyclopedia to learn more about West Virginia. The first thing she encountered was the rhododendron, the state flower, so she kept trying to work the word Rhododendron into the song. Rhododendron was the title that Nivert had written down on the lyric sheet, which they later sent to ASCAP.[9] The three stayed up until 6:00 a.m., changing words and moving lines around.[12]\n\nWhen they finished, on the morning of Wednesday, December 30, 1970, Denver announced that the song had to go on his next album.[12] Later that night, during Denver's first set, Denver called his two collaborators back to the spotlight, where the trio changed their career trajectories, reading the lyrics from a single, handheld, unfolded piece of paper. According to Len Jaffe, a Washington, D.C.-based singer-songwriter who attended the show where Denver premiered the song, this resulted in a five-minute standing ovation.[13] The next day was Denver's 28th birthday. They recorded it in New York City in January 1971.\n\n\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" is written in the key of A major.[14]\n\nCommercial performance and legacy\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" appeared on the LP Poems, Prayers & Promises and was released as a 45 in the spring of 1971. Original pressings credited the single to \"John Denver with Fat City\". It broke nationally in mid-April but moved up the charts very slowly. After several weeks, RCA Records called John and told him they were giving up on the single. His response: \"No! Keep working on it!\"[citation needed] They did, and the single went to number 1 on the Record World Pop Singles Chart and the Cash Box Top 100, and number 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, topped only by \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\" by The Bee Gees.\n\nOn August 18, 1971, it was certified Gold by the RIAA for a million copies shipped.[15] The song continued to sell in the digital era. As of January 2020, the song has also sold 1,800,000 downloads since it became available digitally.[4]\n\nDenver's recording of \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry in 2023.[16]\n\nThe song has since become an anthem of the Brisbane Lions and is sung by the crowd every time Lions player Charlie Cameron kicks a goal. The song was chosen by Cameron to be played in reference to his country roots.[17]\n\nThe song was interpolated in \"Lonely Road\" by MGK & Jelly Roll in 2024. It reached number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated 10 August 2024, giving Denver his first top 40 appearance as a songwriter since the same song's appearance in the medley, Forever Country by Artists of Then, Now & Forever peaked at number 21 in 2016.[4]\n\nReception in West Virginia\n\n[edit]\n\nTake Me Home, Country Roads Regional anthem of West VirginiaLyricsBill Danoff and Taffy NivertPublishedApril 12, 1971AdoptedMarch 2014\n\n\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" received an enthusiastic response from West Virginians.[18] On November 1, 2017, the West Virginia Tourism Office announced it had obtained the rights to use \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\", in its marketing efforts. \"'Country Roads' has become synonymous with West Virginia all over the world,\" said West Virginia Tourism Commissioner Chelsea Ruby. \"It highlights everything we love about our state: scenic beauty, majestic mountains, a timeless way of life, and most of all, the warmth of a place that feels like home whether you've lived here forever or are just coming to visit.\" The opening phrase of the song, \"Almost heaven\", became a primary tourism office slogan.[19]\n\nThe song is the theme song of West Virginia University, and it has been performed during every home football pregame show since 1972. The song is played for other athletic events and university functions, including after football games, for which the fans are encouraged to stay in the stands and sing the song along with the team.[20] On September 6, 1980, at the invitation of West Virginia Governor Jay Rockefeller, songwriters Danoff, Nivert, and Denver performed the song during pregame festivities to a sold-out crowd of Mountaineer fans. This performance marked the dedication of the current West Virginia University Mountaineer Field and the first game for head coach Don Nehlen.[21]\n\nThe popularity of the song inspired resolutions in the West Virginia Legislature to adopt \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" as an official state song. On March 7, 2014, the West Virginia Legislature approved a resolution to make \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" an official state song of West Virginia, alongside three other pieces: \"West Virginia Hills\", \"This Is My West Virginia\", and \"West Virginia, My Home Sweet Home\".[22] Governor Earl Ray Tomblin signed the resolution into law on March 8, 2014.[23]\n\nThe song was played at the funeral for West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd at the state capitol in Charleston, West Virginia on July 2, 2010.[24]\n\nThe Mountain State Brewing Company based in Thomas, West Virginia, produces an amber ale named \"Almost Heaven\", which it says is \"named after John Denver's ode to West Virginia, 'Country Roads'\".[25]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Denver – vocals, 6- & 12-string acoustic guitar\n\nBill Danoff – backing vocals\n\nTaffy Nivert – backing vocals\n\nEric Weissberg – banjo, steel guitar\n\nMike Taylor – acoustic guitar\n\nRichard Kniss – double bass\n\nGary Chester – drums, percussion\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1971) Peak\n\nposition Canada Top Singles (RPM)[26] 3 Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM)[27] 5 Canada Country Tracks (RPM)[28] 17 US Billboard Hot 100[29] 2 US Adult Contemporary (Billboard)[30] 3 US Hot Country Singles (Billboard)[31] 50\n\nYear-end charts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (1971) Position US Billboard Hot 100[32] 8\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Certification Certified units/sales Denmark (IFPI Danmark)[33] Gold 45,000‡ Germany (BVMI)[34] Gold 250,000‡ Italy (FIMI)[35] Platinum 100,000‡ United Kingdom (BPI)[36] 2× Platinum 1,200,000‡ United States (RIAA)[15] Platinum 1,800,000[4]\n\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n\nCover versions\n\n[edit]\n\nHermes House Band version\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Country Roads\"Single by Hermes House Bandfrom the album The Album ReleasedMay 21, 2001 ( )Length3:22LabelXPLO MusicSongwriter(s)\n\nBill Danoff\n\nTaffy Nivert\n\nJohn Denver\n\nProducer(s)\n\nJim Binapfl\n\nJohn Lehmkuhl\n\nMark Snijders\n\nJack Buck\n\nHermes House Band singles chronology\n\n\"Disco Samba Part II\"\n\n(2000) \"Country Roads\"\n\n(2001) \"Que Sera Sera\"\n\n(2001)\n\nDutch pop band Hermes House Band covered the song and released it as \"Country Roads\".
