        "text": "John Denver - Biography\n\nThe internationally acclaimed songwriter called Aspen home for much of his life. His love for the Rocky Mountains inspired many of his songs. He enjoyed his time outdoors spending time hiking, golfing, and skiing among other outdoor activities.\n\nJohn Denver was an active environmentalist and shared environmental messages through music. He performed for the benefit of many charitable organizations including the Deaf Camp Benefit concert. He founded two environmental groups: The Windstar Foundation, conserving land in Snowmass, and Plant-It 2020, a reforestation organization.\n\nTo see Aspen through John Denver's perspective, listen to \"Rocky Mountain High\" and \"Starwood in Aspen\".\n\nHow the Sanctuary Came to Be\n\nIn the spring of 1998, months after John Denver’s tragic death, Jeff Woods, Manager of Parks & Recreation at the City of Aspen, approached Annie Denver to collaborate on a place to celebrate Denver’s life. The concept was beyond just a memorial, “but also served as a garden to capture nature’s spirit. We decided to call it a ‘sanctuary’ and that it should reflect John’s passion for nature and protecting the environment.” -Wood. On August 15, 1998, Mayor Bennett and City Council officially dedicated the 4.5-acre site as the John Denver Sanctuary. Over the next 15+ years, a team of passionate professionals from the City of Aspen has transformed this small ditch, which used to flow through an underground pipe, into an environmental masterpiece. They sculpted thousands of cubic yards of earth, found and placed hundreds of boulders, planted groves of native trees, shrubs, and wildflowers and created wetlands, streams and waterfalls into this unique landscape which captures Aspen's beauty but also serves to continuously clean the community's storm water runoff.\n\nCity of Aspen Guide to the John Denver Sanctuary\n\nJohn Denver Shrine\n\nPay tribute to John Denver in the winter on Aspen Mountain where a shrine was erected after his death. The shrine is located off of Bellissimo Trail.\n\nJohn Denver Celebration"
