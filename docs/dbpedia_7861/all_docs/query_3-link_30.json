        "text": "Don't Dream It's OverCrowded House\n\n\"Don't Dream It's Over\" is the biggest hit for Crowded House, whose lead singer, Neil Finn, sang it on tour when he joined Fleetwood Mac. He wrote the song when he was feeling a bit lost as a way of urging himself on.\n\n(Everything I Do) I Do It For YouBryan Adams\n\nThe Bryan Adams song \"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You\" was almost rejected for the movie Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves because it didn't sound medieval enough.\n\nSoak Up The SunSheryl Crow\n\nSheryl Crow's \"Soak Up The Sun\" isn't as lighthearted as it seems: the song deals with the prevailing head-in-the-sand reaction to climate change.\n\nWhat's Up4 Non Blondes\n\n\"What's Up\" by 4 Non Blondes has endured as one of the most popular songs of the '90s, but it wasn't a huge hit at the time and the band split after one album. Frontwoman Linda Perry went on to write hits for Pink and Christina Aguilera.\n\nDoctor My EyesJackson Browne\n\nA problem with his eyes gave Jackson Browne the idea for \"Doctor My Eyes,\" which became a song about a man whose mental health suffers when he sees the world for what it really is.\n\nMambo No 5 (A Little Bit Of)Lou Bega\n\nThe party tune \"Mambo No 5 (A Little Bit Of)\" was the theme song for the 2000 Democratic Convention (the party of Bill Clinton), until someone noticed the line, \"A little bit of Monica in my life.\"\n\nDesmond ChildSongwriter Interviews\n\nOne of the most successful songwriters in the business, Desmond co-wrote \"Livin' La Vida Loca,\" \"Dude (Looks Like A Lady)\" and \"Livin' On A Prayer.\"\n\nAlice CooperFact or Fiction\n\nHow well do you know this shock-rock harbinger who's been publicly executed hundreds of times?\n\nGuy ClarkSongwriter Interviews\n\nVince Gill, Emmylou Harris and Lyle Lovett are just a few of the artists who have looked to Clark for insightful, intelligent songs.\n\nDaniel LanoisSongwriter Interviews\n\nDaniel Lanois on his album Heavy Sun, and the inside stories of songs he produced for U2, Peter Gabriel, and Bob Dylan."
