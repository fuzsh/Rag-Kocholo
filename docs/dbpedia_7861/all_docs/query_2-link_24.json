        "text": "Fortunately, this is the last bunch of regional releases. From now on, her discography becomes much easier to follow.\n\nThat's interesting - I hadn't realised that.\n\nI've also heard that Don't Stop Believin' was originally going to be a standalone single... possibly with a view to heralding a Greatest Hits compilation 1976 instead of 77... but I'm not sure how accurate that is.\n\nIt definitely did. I believe Carried Away was queued up ready to be the fourth single, but after Landslide fared disappointingly, they shelved that and - of course! - moved onto the next album cash-cow, GHV2...!\n\nI never quite understood the genesis of the lawsuit either. I know on her part she sued (or counter-sued) over failure to adequately promote her records, but that was I believe in response to the suing her for not delivering on schedule.\n\nYet her schedule seemed to be about fifty different albums internationally in 1974, two in '75, and two in '76! I still don't see where the gap was, unless the 'late' album was one that was supposed to come after MAGTB?\n\nWell, she still put out 2 albums in 1977. If you count the GH.\n\nThat managed to turn her fortunes around a bit. It was her biggest album in 2 years.\n\nThey must have renegotiated her contract after the trouble in 1977, because she seemed to be able to release albums much less often after that. 1979 would be the first year she didn’t release one at all.\n\nInteresting… In trying to find out more about the 70s lawsuit, I stumbled across one from the mid-80s! I wonder if this affected MCA’s approach to Soul Kiss and The Rumour?\n\n'Free' Records Cause Discord With Artists\n\nMCA’s meeting-competition explanation does not satisfy attorney John Mason, who represents Olivia Newton-John, the company’s biggest-selling artist.\n\nMason said MCA had “no right to give away Olivia’s records in order to promote the sale of other artists.” He said MCA’s actions appear to represent a breach of Newton-John’s contract, which calls for MCA to obtain written permission any time it offers free goods on her recordings. Mason said MCA neither requested nor received permission.\n\nMason said he has submitted a claim for royalties due on all Newton-John recordings given away by MCA in the last couple of years, but he wouldn’t say how many that was. “I’ll decide how to proceed after I receive MCA’s response to the claim.” he said.\n\n(Hopefully I’ll remember to link back to this when we get to that era!)\n\nI’ve told this story before many times, but HYNBM was my real introduction to Olivia. I was aware of her, of course, but this was the first song I was really taken by. To the point that I went to buy the single. My local record store said they’d sold out(!), but had just gotten the album in. Now, I wasn’t at all sure that an Olivia LP would be for me, but for some reason (fate, maybe) I had enough money that day to be able to buy it. So I did.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn’t love at first listen. Mellow itself was a triumph, and I liked the upbeat numbers like It’s So Easy, Water Under The Bridge, Follow Me and Lifestream, but ballads like I Never Did Sing You A Love Song, And In The Morning and the dreaded IHLY left me cold. I didn’t like her version of The Air That I Breathe either. Much preferring The Hollies take from the previous year.\n\nStill, I’d bought it so I’d better get used to it! It’s fair to say though, that my fandom didn’t kick in until I got hold of Music Makes My Day, Clearly Love, First Impressions and even Long Live Love. Obviously there was enough there with HYNBM to make me buy further albums, but it was a disappointment at the time.\n\nNot so much so now, however. Mellow is in my top 3 Olivia albums of the 70s. It’s really grown on me over the years. I rate it as the best of those 1975-77 country/pop albums by far. The selection of songs on HYNBM feels strong and free of filler to me. It’s definitely an album that should have been given more time to breathe. It’s a great sounding LP and CD too.\n\nObviously the Mellow album and single flopped here. As did Follow Me. It’s fair to say this wasn’t for lack of radio airplay, though. Olivia was treated pretty well in that regard in the 70s. It’s just that the public didn’t appear to care for her records. Plus, of course, she wasn’t here to promote them. In fact, she wouldn’t personally appear with the intention of plugging a new record until May/June 1977 when she released Sam. It worked too. It became her biggest hit in 6 years. But I’m jumping ahead.\n\nAlthough it still has a few obvious covers, it has a significant proportion of what feel like Olivia originals (like Please Mr. Please and IHLY), which in a way makes it feel like an 'arrival' of sorts for her; and arguably, HYNBM itself is a particularly pivotal song because it straddles that country-folk-pop-easy-listening sensibility that was her stronghold in the 70s, and hints at that lush pop perfection that awaited her at the end of the decade and into the 80s. It's not surprising that the stage revival of Xanadu included HYNBM in its own soundtrack. It fits, somehow, and is of course the first in the run of ONJ/Farrar collaborations that elevate Olivia's body of work into a pop class all its own. (There was also a pretty dreadful dance cover version doing the rounds in the mid-90s, I seem to recall...)\n\nI got this one on vinyl in the late 80s, in the midst of a second-hand record haul during one memorable summer holiday. I like many of the songs on it - HYNBM, Please Mr. Please, It's So Easy, And In The Morning (and IHLY, which is on the UK edition) are highlights; Follow Me is pleasant enough and I do quite like her version of The Air That I Breathe (although it's not a song I particularly like in the first place). However, the other songs still tend towards the twangy country sound that I never fully warmed to, and this album - like most of hers, if I'm honest - has its share of filler, which means it somehow manages to become less than the sum of its parts. Although it's more hits-laden (if you include IHLY in its track list) it doesn't charm me as much as Long Live Love or Come On Over, or her earlier works.\n\nNot releasing It's So Easy was a missed opportunity, though. I suppose they thought that Follow Me would be enticing to a UK audience because they had enjoyed her previous John Denver cover... but it doesn't sound like a UK hit to me. And it wasn't.\n\nOlivia puts out a solid record here. While still rooted in the Country music realm, she's not staying entirely inside the lines of the genre.\n\nThe title track gets the record off to a great start - an original no less! (at least I think so - right? Farrar was her collaborator?) A great mid-tempo pop creation that hints at the direction she would start heading with her career. Veering away from the country roots into the pop realm.... I guess to fully appreciate some of these older Olivia albums it would be good familiarize oneself with the original versions of the songs she covers. Or, maybe not. What do y'all think? Some of the more \"obscure\" covers I do not know the originals. For context, if nothing else...\n\nAnyway - having not heard this album in it's entirety before, I've been listening to it on repeat the last couple of days to let sink it and digest it. Like a lot of things, it becomes a grower with each additional listen.\n\nTo be honest I'm not a huge fan of the \"syrupy ballad\" that Olivia does so well. And there are a few them on this record. (but again, they're growing on me...)\n\nThat said, it's hard not to appreciate what she's doing, and hear how her voice and confidence at the microphone are maturing.\n\nFor me the more upbeat and/or country-ish songs are where it's at. Water Under The Bridge, It's So easy, Follow Me, Please Mr Please, and of course Mellow!\n\nI anticipate this record getting several more passes in the coming days/weeks."
