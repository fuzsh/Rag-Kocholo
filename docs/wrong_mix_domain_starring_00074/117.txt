The youngest of the Gabor sisters, Eva Gabor came first to the United States in the 1930s, establishing a career in films and later on Broadway. She appeared in many of early television's live dramatic series that came out of New York ("GE Theater," "Philco Playhouse," "Climax," etc.).

In the 1970s, Gabor received a plum series opportunity on the popular "Green Acres." As Lisa Douglas, Manhattan socialite turned farmer's wife, she was the Desi/Ricky figure opposite Eddie Albert's supposed Lucy, drifting through chicken coops and hogpens in maribou negligees.
