Eva Gabor, the younger sister of Madga and Zsa Zsa, was born in Hungary in 1919 and died in Los Angeles on 4 July 1995. Eva migrated to the United States in her early 20s and eventually achieved international fame as an actress. She appeared alongside celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor and Dean Martin, starred in Green Acres and voiced ‘Duchess’ in the animated film The Aristocats.

The image above shows Eva at a Los Angeles event with Robert Muldoon, New Zealand Prime Minister from December 1975 to July 1984. This photographic print is from a file dated '1982?-1984?', however crowd-sourced information suggests it could have been taken as early as 1979.
