        "text": "Any decades-long franchise inevitably gets to the point where the timeline and watch order begins to confuse. With the release of “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” director George Miller is finally adding his first non-sequential film to the series.\n\nThe films are gasoline-soaked, rubber-burning, post-apocalypse movies following the titular Max, first played by Mel Gibson and later Tom Hardy, through a vehicle and bullet obsessed wasteland. The latest film – “Furiosa” – serves as a prequel to 2015’s “Mad Max: Fury Road” and expands on the character made famous by Charlize Theron.\n\nConsider this your complete guide to watching all the “Mad Max” movies in order.\n\nMad Max Movies in Chronological Order\n\nIf you prefer your franchise binges to be ingested in a sequential timeline then this is the roadmap to check out the Mad Max films.\n\nMad Max (1979)\n\nMad Max: The Road Warrior (1981)\n\nMad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985)\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024)\n\nMad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n\nMad Max Movies in Release Order\n\nIf you want your binge to follow a release order so you can see director George Miller’s vision of his dystopian road movies evolve over time then use this path.\n\nMad Max (1979)\n\nMad Max: The Road Warrior (1981)\n\nMad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985)\n\nMad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024)\n\nWhere to Stream the Mad Max Movies\n\nEvery one of the released Mad Max films are available to stream on Max.
