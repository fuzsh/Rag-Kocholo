        "text": "MONDAY, MAY 27\n\nFURIOSA: A MAD MAX SAGA---the prequel earned about $27 million in its three-day premiere compared to FURY ROAD's $45 million in 2015.\n\nSTAR WARS---George Lucas was surprised to be presented an Honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival by Francis Ford Coppola on the 47th anniversary of STAR WARS. Lucas said, “What an honor it is for Francis to appear out of nowhere. I didn’t expect this. He’s a great friend, and a big brother, and a mentor, and I thank him for everything he’s ever done for me. I’d like to thank the Cannes Film Festival, which [Walter Murch,] my co-writer, sound editor, great pal, who came to the Cannes Film Festival… My first professional movie [THX 1138] was shown here 52 years ago, in the first director series. It was pouring rain, and it was one of the greatest moments of our life. We had to sneak into the movie because Warner Bros. wouldn’t have much to do with us. This is a great circle moment.\n\nI can’t thank all of you enough. I’m just a kid who grew up in a vineyard in Modesto, California, who makes movies in San Francisco with my friend Francis. So we spent our entire careers in parallel, and in San Francisco in particular. In fact, I’ve never made a Hollywood film as a director. So it’s a real honor to be here. I can tell you that. Thank you so much.\"\n\nLater, Lucas said that after he sold Lucasfilm to Disney for $4 billion in 2012, Disney wandered away from his original concepts, “I was the one who really knew what STAR WARS was…who actually knew this world, because there’s a lot to it. The Force, for example, nobody understood the Force. When they started other ones after I sold the company, a lot of the ideas that were in [the original] sort of got lost. But that’s the way it is. You give it up, you give it up.”\n\nHe also commented on his controversial revisions to the original movies, “I’m a firm believer that the director, or the writer, or the filmmaker should have a right to have his movie be the way he wants it. We did release the original one on laserdisc and everybody got really mad, they said, ‘It looks terrible.’ And I said, ‘Yeah, I know it did’. That is what it looked like.”\n\nJURASSIC WORLD---a rumor claims new cast members for the dinosaur reboot movie include Tobin Bell (SAW) and Joel McHale (COMMUNITY).\n\nFALLOUT---the Amazon Prime tv series based on the video game had 1.5 billion viewing minutes from April 22-28 which made it Amazon Prime's biggest premiere ever and its only series to make AC Nielsen's top streaming list three times.\n\nTHE LAST OF US---Jeffrey Wright will play Isaac, leader of the Washington Liberation Front, in Season 2.\n\nMARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE---Giancarlo Esposito said he will star in a Marvel Studios tv series, \"The MCU has knocked on my door and it’s a role you won’t predict. It will be teased and there will be a series afterwards.”\n\nAlso, a rumor claims Esposito's BREAKING BAD co-star, Bryan Cranston, has met with Marvel Studios to discuss his appearing in a future Marvel project.\n\nDEATH BY LIGHTNING---Michael Shannon will star in the Netflix miniseries about the assassination of President James Garfield.\n\nMY BLOODY VALENTINE---Blumhouse is reportedly make a new version of the 1981 slasher movie, but it is not known if it is a sequel or a reboot.\n\nTRIVIA---Memorial Day trivia.\n\nIn THE GREAT ESCAPE, Steve McQueen played Captain Virgil Hilts, an American pilot who was a key part of the Allied POW escape attempt from the German Stalag Luft 3 POW camp. Hilts's character was based on several different POWs, but director John Sturges said Hilts was based mainly on Capt. David. M Jones. Jones was a B-25 Mitchell bomber pilot and a member of the Doolittle Raid, which bombed Tokyo four months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor which led to the US entering World War II. Jones was bombing a German airfield in Tunisia when he was shot down and captured. He was a POW at Stalag Luft 3 for two and half years and, because of his leadership abilities, was chosen to be a leader for the digging team on Harry, one of the three tunnels in The Great Escape.\n\nJones said after The Great Escape was discovered by the Germans, the Germans released a list of the POWs who were captured and executed, \"...had a lot of good friends on it...some people I met when I first got to camp, worked with, lived with...it was a very traumatic time...\"\n\nHe added, \"There were 78 prisoners who actually escaped, three were very successful, escaped. All the rest were collected by the Germans and of that, 50 were murdered.\"\n\nIn THE GREAT ESCAPE, Steve McQueen played Captain Virgil Hilts, an American pilot who was a key part of the Allied POW escape attempt from the German Stalag Luft 3 POW camp.\n\nDirector John Sturges said Hilts was based mainly on Capt. David. M Jones (second from left), a B-25 Mitchell bomber pilot and a member of the Doolittle Raid, which bombed Tokyo four months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nJones's Stalag Luft 3 POW card.\n\nTUESDAY, MAY 28\n\nSTAR TREK: DISCOVERY---trailer released for the last season.\n\nLINK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5aEr8rzQs\n\nWOLFS---teaser trailer released for the movie starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt.\n\nLINK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcm-oSv1mNs\n\nWAKE UP DEAD MAN: A KNIVES OUT MYSTERY---Cailee Spaeny (PRISCILLA) and Josh O'Connor (THE CROWN) will co-star with Daniel Craig in the Netflix sequel. Rian Johnson posted, “I love everything about whodunnits, but one of the things I love most is how malleable the genre is. There’s a whole tonal spectrum from Carr to Christie, and getting to explore that range is one of the most exciting things about making Benoit Blanc movies.”\n\nHe added, \"We’re about to go into production on the third one, and I’m very, very excited to share the title, which gives a little hint of where it’s going.”\n\nSPIDER-MAN 4---Bilall Fallah, who co-directed the cancelled BATGIRL with Adil El Arbi, commented on rumors they are directing SPIDER-MAN 4, \"I can't talk about that.\"\n\nFURIOSA: A MAD MAX SAGA---George Miller said he has finished a Tinted Black and Chrome version of FURIOSA, “We’ve done it already. It’s the last thing I did on this film, and I call it Tinted Black and Chrome. I must say, it’s really interesting, I’m still trying to demystify why the black and white, for me, has something more elemental to it. I still can’t put my finger on it. It’s not because they look like old black and white movies, it’s something else. It’s like if we took a picture of ourselves right now, it might look a little more dramatic if it’s in black and white.”\n\nMARVEL CINEMA UNIVERSE---George Lucas said Martin Scorsese has changed his mind slightly about the MCU after he criticized Marvel movies in 2019, “Look. Cinema is the art of a moving image. So, if the image moves, then it’s cinema. I think Marty has kind of changed his mind a little bit.”\n\nDAVID LYNCH---David Lynch hinted at a surprise project, “Ladies and gentleman, something is coming along…. for you to see and hear. And it will be coming along on June 5.”\n\nI KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER---Jennifer Love-Hewitt said she is in talks to return for the latest sequel, ”It’s in the cooker, let me just say that. I’ve done a couple of preliminary phone calls. I keep getting these messages from people going, ‘We’re so excited!’ I’m like, ‘Okay, but the train is moving really fast, and I haven’t gotten there yet.’ But it’s nice to know that people are excited at the possibility. Honestly, it’s wild to even think about. Truly, if it comes together, I don’t even know how I’m gonna feel except extremely overwhelmed and grateful.\"\n\nTRIVIA---Steve Reeves became Europe's highest-paid actor after starring in the 1958 hit Greek mythology movie HERCULES. When the producers of the first James Bond movie, DR. NO, were looking for the actor to play Bond, they offered the role to Reeves, but he declined the offer because he did not want to be tied down to a multiple-movie franchise.\n\nIf Reeves had accepted the James Bond role, ironically, he would have reunited with Luciana Paluzzi, who appeared in HERCULES as Iole's maid in HERCULES and in THUNDERBALL as SPECTRE assassin Fiona Volpe.\n\nSteve Reeves became Europe's highest-paid actor after starring in the 1958 hit Greek mythology movie HERCULES and turned down the James Bond role in DR.

However, Comicbookmovie.com claimed it will be a prequel to the Brendan Fraser remake. In 2023, Fraser commented on returning as Rick O'Connell, “I’m not opposed to it, I don’t know an actor who doesn’t want a job. I don’t think I’ve been this famous and unsalaried at the same time in my professional life so sign me up!”\n\nMAD MAX: THE WASTELAND---George Miller commented on the status of his next Mad Max movie, “I’d say that it certainly has a lot of action in it, but it is also a saga. It’s a year-long story. FURY ROAD happened over three days and two nights. You could almost say that the first act, some part of the second act, and the third act mostly play in real time. Quite a different kettle of fish than FURIOSA.\"\n\nHe added, \"I’m still figuring out what to do with [THE WASTELAND]. I’m just waiting to see the reception on FURIOSA. If it all lines up, then we’ll go ahead with it.”\n\nNOSFERATU---Bill Skarsgard commented on his vampire character Orlock in the remake of the 1922 movie, “I do not think people are gonna recognize me in it.

Hopefully you’ll get a little bit attracted by it and disgusted by your attraction at the same time.”\n\nTRIVIA---Jean Marsh is best known for her Emmy Award-winning performance as maid Rose Buck on the British tv series UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS.

I’ve felt it myself.”\n\nShe later added, “I stand by my empathy for STAR WARS fans. But I want to be clear. Anyone who engages in bigotry, racism, or hate speech … I don’t consider a fan.”\n\nLucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy commented on the fan criticism of THE ACOLYTE's female cast and crew, \"My belief is that storytelling does need to be representative of all people. That’s an easy decision for me.\n\nOperating within these giant franchises now, with social media and the level of expectation — it’s terrifying. I think Leslye has struggled a little bit with it. I think a lot of the women who step into STAR WARS struggle with this a bit more. Because of the fan base being so male dominated, they sometimes get attacked in ways that can be quite personal.”\n\nTHE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE HUNT FOR GOLLUM---Viggo Mortensen said he has not heard any details about the plot of THE HUNT FOR GOLLUM, but he might be interested in returning as Aragorn, “I would only do it if I was right for it in terms of, you know, the age I am now and so forth.

Lindsay based Dexter Morgan on Brazilian serial killer Pedro Rodrigues Filho, who was 14 years old when he killed the deputy mayor of a Brazilian city who fired his father, a city security guard, after he claimed Filo's father was a thief. He then killed the security guard who was the real thief. Filo later joined a gang where he killed rival gang members, including an entire gang whose members killed his pregnant girlfriend. Filho was sent to prison for 34 years for committing 71 murders, but he claimed he killed over 100 people and only killed people who were criminals themselves. While in prison, Filho killed over 40 fellow inmates.\n\nAfter being released from prison, Filho became a star on YouTube and TikTok.

And the world changes. Our culture is changing. A lot. Since the first movie was made. Socially, certainly politically, and definitely, our language, and different cultural changes we’ve had. And you’ve got to make sure you’re in touch with all that and moving with it, and doing things the right way. … It’s not as easy to just do another one. You’ve got to take a lot into account.

There is speculation it will be a prequel to the movie.\n\nGAME OF THRONES---George RR Martin commented on screenplay writers who make movies that are unfaithful to the original book, “If anything, things have gotten worse. Everywhere you look, there are more screenwriters and producers eager to take great stories and ‘make them their own.’ It does not seem to matter whether the source material was written by.\n\nNo matter how major a writer it is, no matter how great the book, there always seems to be someone on hand who thinks he can do better, eager to take the story and ‘improve’ on it.\n\n‘The book is the book, the film is the film,’ they will tell you, as if they were saying something profound. Then they make the story their own. They never make it better, though. Nine hundred ninety-nine times out of a thousand, they make it worse.”\n\nAVENGERS: SECRET WARS---Anson Mount commented on rumors he will appear in the sequel as Black Bolt from the INHUMANS tv series, “This is so interesting. Please tell us more about this contract I apparently signed in my sleep.

Disney originally wanted James Arness to play Davy Crockett and watched Arness in the giant ant sci fi movie THEM!, but Disney was more impressed with Parker playing an airplane pilot who told the FBI agent played by Arness that he saw flying saucers which were really the giant ants in flight. Parker said, \"The picture was reviewed by Walt Disney because Jim Arness was already starring in motion pictures, and he was the star of this film...And Disney just happened to see that part of the film and said, 'Who's that?' and no one knew.\" Eventually a THEM! producer was contacted, who gave Parker's name to Disney. Parker added, \"That was my lucky break because he just saw a minute or two of film.\"\n\nPlaying an airplane pilot led to Parker's stardom, but ironically, during World War II, Parker enlisted in the Navy with hopes of becoming a pilot, \"I'm 6' 6\" and I tried to fly, tried to be in the Naval pilot program and the Army program. 6' 4\" was the height limit.\" His height also prevented him from being a Naval radioman/gunner.

Nathanson D-Day novel. Nathanson based his novel on a story he heard from sources, including his friend Russ Meyer, an Army combat photographer who later became famous for his soft porn movies. Meyer and others told Nathanson about a group of 12 Native American Army convicts, and their white lieutenant, who would be granted clemency if they agreed to participate in a suicidal mission behind German lines on D-Day.\n\nNathanson's research found the story to be fiction. In reality, The Filthy Thirteen were 13 paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division who were chosen for seven days of additional grueling training. The squad leader was Jake \"McNasty\" McNiece, who told his men they would not bathe until they completed their training. After the training was completed, they were filthy which accounted for the \"Filthy\" part of their name.\n\nMcNiece explained how the unit's mythology included being convicts, \"We never took care of our barracks or any other thing, or sanitation, and we were always restricted to camp. But we went AWOL every weekend that we wanted to and we stayed as long as we wanted till we returned back, because we knew they needed us badly for combat. And it would just be a few days in the brig. We stole jeeps. We stole trains. We blew up barracks. We blew down trees. We stole the colonel's whiskey and things like that.\"\n\nThe true story of The Filthy Thirteen was accurately reported by the STARS AND STRIPES newspaper, but later TRUE magazine's version of The Filthy Thirteen morphed into 12 Native American convicts who refused to bathe until they finished their training for their suicide mission and clemency.\n\nJust before D-Day, McNiece, a part-Choctaw Indian, convinced his fellow paratroopers to shave their heads into Mohawk haircuts and apply face paint to reinforce their image as brave warriors. The Filthy Thirteen's Mohawks and face paint became a famous World War II photo.\n\nOn D-Day, of the 13 paratroopers, four were killed, four were wounded and two became POWs.\n\nFilthy Thirteen member Jack Agnew told his daughter, Barbara, that 30% of the movie was accurate. She added, \"Dad, when we were little kids, he'd always say, 'I won the war; I know you don't believe me, but someday you'll know.\"\n\nTHE DIRTY DOZEN was the fourth-highest grossing movie of 1967 with a cast including Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, John Cassavetes, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, Jim Brown, Clint Walker, Ernest Borgnine, George Kennedy, Ralph Meeker and Robert Ryan.\n\nThe Filthy Thirteen's D-Day Mohawks and face paint became a famous World War II photo.\n\nFRIDAY, JUNE 7\n\nSTAR WARS: THE ACOLYTE---THE ACOLYTE's premiere had 4.8 million views in one day making it Disney+'s most-viewed premiere of 2024.\n\nTHE WALKING DEAD: DARYL DIXON-THE BOOK OF CAROL---photos released from Season 2 which premieres on September 29.\n\nGODZILLA x KONG: THE NEW EMPIRE 2---Grant Sputore (I AM MOTHER) has replaced Adam Wingard as the sequel's director.\n\nALIEN---Noah Hawley said FX is happy about the development of the prequel tv series' Season 1 and is already looking ahead to Season 2, “They’re saying maybe don’t do two things at once on this show.

We know where the ending is now. The writing team and I…and when I say the ending it’s really just where the curtain drops in this particular period of Targaryen history. Because, of course, after the Dance of Dragons is over there’s still another 120, 150 years of history before the Mad King is overthrown by Robert Baratheon. Which is really the end of the Targaryen Dynasty, and that leads us into the original series.\"\n\nHe added, “So yeah, we’ve talked about it. I do want to honor as much of what is there in the book, but we also have to find a satisfying to this story that wraps things up in a different and unexpected way for a giant TV audience. You’re always balancing the written history and making television show. But I think the fun of FIRE & BLOOD as a whole is it’s such a deeply rich and textured history that another writer can follow me after this and tell a story from the past before the DANCE OF THE DRAGONS or just after.”\n\nWHITE HOUSE---Idris Elba and Rebecca Ferguson will star in Kathryn Bigelow's untitled Netflix movie set in the White House when nuclear missiles are launched at the US.\n\nTHE INSTITUTE---Ben Barnes and Mary-Louise Parker will star in the MGM+ eight-part miniseries based on the Stephen King novel.\n\nMOVIE LOSSES---VARIETY projects THE FALL GUY will lose $50 million-$60 million and FURIOSA: A MAD MAX SAGA will lose $75 million-$95 million.\n\nTHE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RINGS OF POWER---HBO renewed the series for Season 3.\n\nTHE CHOP SHOP---Christine Ricci and Hamish Linklater will star in the true crime series based on the book about David Sconce, who took over the family Los Angeles crematorium and was later convicted of selling body parts, stealing gold filings and stealing from trust accounts.\n\nAMANDA KNOX---Grace van Patten will star in the untitled Hulu miniseries which is “based on the true story of how Knox was wrongfully convicted for the murder of her roommate Meredith Kercher, and her 16-year odyssey to set herself truly free.” Knox was convicted of murdering Kercher by an Italian court in 2009, but her conviction was later overturned.\n\nBLADE---Mahershala Ali's attorney, Shelby Weiser, commented on the reboot movie's many creative shake-ups and the departure of two directors, \"That deal was in 2019, and they still haven’t shot it, which is pretty much the craziest thing in my professional experience.\"\n\nTRANSFORMERS & G.I.

As the father of a 17-year-old boy, I see what my son is feeling as he looks at the world and to his future. I see the uncertainty; I see all the things we took for granted as given are not certainties for him.\n\nI see him recognizing he’s inheriting an enormous mess to clean up and it’s going to be on his generation to figure out how to do that, and that’s a lot to ask of a kid.\n\nMy thinking was, if we set STARFLEET ACADEMY in the halcyon days of the Federation where everything was fine, it’s not going to speak to what kids are going through right now. It’ll be a nice fantasy, but it’s not really going to be authentic.\n\nWhat’ll be authentic is to set it in the timeline where this is the first class back after over 100 years, and they are coming into a world that is only beginning to recover from a cataclysm – which was the Burn, as established on STAR TREK: DISCOVERY, where the Federation was greatly diminished.\n\nSo they’re the first who’ll inherit, who’ll re-inherit, the task of exploration as a primary goal, because there just wasn’t room for that during the Burn – everybody was playing defense.”\n\nDOCTOR WHO---showrunner Russell T. Davies commented on the show's low ratings, “In coming back, I wanted to make it simpler and I wanted to make it younger. Those two things are often not discussed – you read reactions to it and people are missing that. It’s simpler and younger – and it is working.\n\nThe under-16s and the 16-34 audience as well is massive. It’s not doing that well in the ratings, but it is doing phenomenally well with the younger audience that we wanted.”\n\nHe added, “They might not be the ratings we’d love. We always want higher. But they are building over the 28-day period. Episode one, ‘Space Babies,’ is already up to 5.6 million and counting. So it is getting there. And actually, I was brought back to bring in a younger audience. That’s been massively successful.\n\nThe audience no one ever gets are the under-30s. They just don’t watch television anymore. But those figures are astronomic for Doctor Who, it’s their top program in that bracket. I never thought it was possible, to be honest. But according to the people who juggle the numbers, all targets have been reached and exceeded. The BBC are running around like mad things.”\n\nTHE THREE-BODY PROBLEM---Chinese movie underway based on the novel and directed by Zhang Yimou (HERO). It is not connected to the Netflix tv series.\n\nPIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN---Austin Butler commented on rumors he will star in the reboot movie, “Oh really, I haven’t heard about that. I loved PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. That just reminded me of when I was a kid. In elementary school, we had to make these posters that had like your favorite music, your favorite actors. And at that time – I don’t know what grade, it must have been fourth grade, third grade or something – but it was — PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN was on there.”\n\nMISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 8---the sequel budget is reportedly \"running well over $300 million\".

Richard Donner, who did the other four, sadly passed away and he was a good friend, and he kind of tasked me with carrying the flag home on that one. So it'll be an honor for me to do that.

Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends.”\n\nMAD MAX: WASTELAND---Tom Hardy commented on the MAD MAX: FURY ROAD prequel, \"I don't think it's happening.\" The chances of WASTELAND proceeding dropped considerably after FURIOSA: A MAD MAX SAGA bombed at the box office.\n\nHOUSE OF THE DRAGON---Season 2's premiere drew 7.8 million viewers which is a drop of 22% from Season 1's premiere which had 10 million viewers.\n\nTHE BOYS---Season 4's Rotten Tomatoes critic scores were similar to previous seasons, but its audience score of 49% plummeted compared to Season 1--90%, Season 20--83%, Season 3---75%.

Gabor gets out of her car, slaps the light and says, \"This happens every f-cking time when I go shopping!\" The scene was the spoof of the 1989 incident which became known as \"The slap heard around the world\" in which Beverly Hills police officer Paul Kramer stopped Gabor in her Rolls-Royce because of expired registration tags. While he was checking for other possible violations, Gabor drove off. Kramer stopped her again and then Gabor slapped Kramer. She claimed Kramer shoved her, but Kramer said the slap was unprovoked. Gabor was fined $2,350 for slapping Kramer, $352 for driving with an expired license and $235 for an open container of Jack Daniels.\n\nIn the subsequent trial, Gabor contradicted herself repeatedly on the witness stand, claimed Kramer had numerous gay lovers and claimed the police videotapes showing her using obscene language were doctored. Gabor said, “In Nazi Hungary they were fairer than here. Here they don’t kill you. They kill you with words.”\n\nDuring the trial, the circus atmosphere included a Zsa Zsa impersonator having a mock fight with a man wearing a \"Hang Zsa Zsa\" t-shirt in the court building and a later bomb scare.\n\nLos Angeles County District Atorney Ira Reiner said, “It started out as a minor incident. But what elevated this beyond . . . a minor case was her conduct over that three-week period during the trial where she made a mockery out of everything. And it wasn’t just a mockery of the criminal justice system . . . the judge, the police officers, the court personnel, the prosecutors, the entire system, which she dismissed as a Nazi-type system because anybody would presume to judge Zsa Zsa Gabor.”\n\nAt the end of the trial, the jury found guilty on all counts except for disobeying an officer. The judge fined Gabor $12,937, ordered her to spend three days in jail, perform 120 hours of community service and undergo a psychiatric evaluation.\n\nGabor commented on her sentence, “I’m disappointed. I can’t believe it. I can’t believe that in a country as great as ours that a 6-foot-4 policeman can beat up a lady of 5-foot-4 and use dirty language as if she was a street walker. I think Russia can’t be worse, or communist Hungary.”\n\nShe also commented on spending time in jail, “That would be wonderful. I’d have time to write my book...If I go to jail, Bistro Gardens [a restaurant] said they would serve me food three times a day.”\n\nShe also disclosed her immediate plans now that the trial was over, “I’m going home to collapse in my swimming pool.”\n\nTHURSDAY, JUNE 20\n\nTHE PENGUIN---teaser trailer released for the Max series starring Colin Farrell.\n\nLINK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2uSwItbBAg\n\nFLY ME TO THE MOON---trailer released for the comedy movie starring Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum.\n\nLINK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRs0vArcAOw\n\nSTARTREK: PRODIGY---trailer released for Season 2.\n\nLINK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXh5TLAeJqw\n\nTHE ABANDON---trailer released for the sci fi movie.\n\nLINK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPrao47fD8A\n\nREVELATIONS---director Yeon Sang-ho (TRAIN TO BUSAN) is developing a Netflix movie based on his Korean webtoon about a pastor who receives a divine revelation and teams up with a detective to find his abducted son.

But there were a lot of conversations, and I’m still in those. I talk to the guys that run Marvel and DC. And I’m a comic book nerd. So, we’ll see. Even that part of the industry is changing...But I’ve pitched myself for a couple parts of the Marvel Universe, I don’t want to say what exactly, but it was a part of a comic book that I really liked. I was like, “Are you going to do this story?” And they were like, 'Yeah, we’re actually thinking of that.' I go, 'Good. I should be the guy.' So maybe it’ll work out.”\n\nTHE X-FILES---David Duchovny commented on if he will return as Fox Mulder in the Ryan Coogler reboot movie, “I don’t wake up and wonder, ‘Where is the X-FILES stock today?’ But I love that show. I don’t know what my character would be like at my age. It’s an interesting question. That show can address the present as well as it addressed the ’90s. It just depends on [series creator] Chris [Carter] or the other writers.
