        "text": "One of the great joys of listening to music in the ’90s was then being able to curate your own best-ofs. It was the decade of cassette mixtapes, the highly personal, labor-intensive home recording projects that involved patiently waiting for a song to play on the radio in order to tape it, or painstakingly rewinding and fast-forwarding to an exact right moment to dub from one cassette to another. Writing out the tracklist and embellishing it with design was an entire artform in itself. This was the first version of personal playlisting. Here are the 250 songs that would make up Pitchfork’s ultimate ’90s mixtape.\n\nRead Pitchfork’s list of the best albums of the 1990s here, and check out our full ’90s package here.\n\nFor more about how we put together this list, read this letter from our editor-in-chief Puja Patel.\n\nOur 2003 list of the best albums of the 1990s can be found here. Our 2010 list of the best songs of the 1990s can be found here.\n\n250.\n\nLen: “Steal My Sunshine” (1999)\n\nOf all the great one-hit wonders of the ’90s, Len’s “Steal My Sunshine” might be the most enduring and the most inexplicable. Somehow, a pair of Canadian siblings managed to capture the essence of Southern California in a single that turned into a summertime perennial. The song comes into view slowly, like a mirage shimmering on the edge of a sun-bleached horizon. Its foundational sample of Andrea True Connection’s disco classic “More, More, More” reveals itself as a grounding mantra, then the bliss goes widescreen once Len crash into the verse. Marc and Sharon Costanzo share a lackadaisical vocal affect—it sounds like they hit the studio directly after getting burned on the beach—but where so many slackers couldn’t be bothered to shape their slothfulness into hooks, Len cares deeply about leisure: They’re committed to wasting away the hours that make up a dull day. Because nothing sounds better than doing absolutely nothing. –Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nListen: Len, “Steal My Sunshine”\n\n249.\n\nWu-Tang Clan: “Triumph” (1997)\n\nNo need to address Inspectah Deck’s opening lines, which everyone who cares about the Wu-Tang Clan already knows by heart, and has probably tried rapping themselves at some point. They’re great, but they stick in your head above the others partly by virtue of coming first. What about Raekwon’s white-gold tarantula, rhymed—unbelievably but perhaps inevitably—with “substantial-a”? Even U-God gets an all-timer in there, singing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng. The monumental first single from their sprawling and uneven second album, “Triumph” is the Wu’s last great stand as a nine-man team and one of hip-hop’s greatest posse cuts. Over suitably dusty RZA production, with nothing remotely resembling a chorus, they go in for six minutes about Marvel comics and Mortal Kombat; Tennessee Williams and Laurel & Hardy; champagne bottles and squabbles with rival crews; and, of course, the will of the Wu to rule it all. They were never particularly aligned with commercial trends, but in 1997, at the dawn of the shiny suit era, this sort of wordy mythologizing was especially unfashionable. And yet, with no concessions to the mainstream save its blockbuster music video, it went platinum. The first line of the final verse provides the most apposite reaction: “Ayo, that’s amazing.” –Andy Cush\n\nListen: Wu-Tang Clan, “Triumph”\n\n248.\n\nAni DiFranco: “Both Hands” (1990)\n\nAni DiFranco kicked off her studio discography with a mature song about the end of an affair that she recorded when she was just 18. The opening track off her self-titled debut, which was also the first release from her DIY label Righteous Babe, “Both Hands” hangs sensual recollections on a skeleton of trembling acoustic guitar. Flickering between a slam-poetry cadence and the frantic trill of a Gen X Joni Mitchell, the bisexual-icon-to-be narrated the dissolution of a formative relationship with a person of unspecified gender, whose physical contours read as female. It would take a few years for DiFranco to become the default soundtrack of coffeehouses and women’s centers, but with “Both Hands”—still her most popular track—she arrived as both a throwback to folk’s idealistic hippie heyday and a prophet of sexual revolutions to come. –Judy Berman\n\nListen: Ani DiFranco, “Both Hands”\n\n247.\n\nFugazi: “Smallpox Champion” (1993)\n\nWhile colonizing the Americas in the 1700s, officers from Britain enacted biological warfare by intentionally gifting blankets infected with smallpox to Indigenous Americans. Though historians debate if the method even worked, it’s a revolting act immortalized in the diaries of those who pulled it off—and the history lesson at the heart of In on the Kill Taker’s most energizing track. Led by Guy Picciotto’s fuming vocals, “Smallpox Champion” is a scathing condemnation of U.S. genocide filtered through Fugazi’s rousing brand of post-hardcore. Between Brendan Canty’s aggressive tom hits and Ian Mackaye’s wiry guitar noise lies a protest song without any of the typical cliches or moral preaching. Instead, Picciotto delights in the promise of retribution: “History rears up to spit in your face.” By the time its whammy-bar riffs ring out and its “cha-cha-cha” chants start, Fugazi sound almost joyful. “You’ll get yours,” cheers Picciotto. “Woohoo-hoo!” –Nina Corcoran\n\nFurther Reading: In on the Kill Taker Sunday Review\n\nListen: Fugazi, “Smallpox Champion”\n\n246.\n\nWilson Phillips: “Hold On” (1990)\n\n“Hold On” stitches together the camp and corniness left over from the ’80s, chintzy piano, and what should sound like affirmations stitched on throw pillows—open your heart and mind, tomorrow will be easier, you’re responsible for your own happiness—into a panoramic anthem. The track begins with a tingle of percussion and just the suggestion of strings before those schmaltzy chords chime in. Beneath the sweet sheath of harmonies and lilting melody, Wilson Phillips issue a command: just keep going. It’s a plea packaged as a pep talk: “Hold On” was Wilson Phillips’ first single, and they needed the hit to slide out of their parents’ shadows (consisting of descendants of both Brian Wilson and the Mamas & the Papas, the band was soft-rock royalty). With “Hold On,” they asked to be taken seriously, on their own terms—with the hope that you, too, could recognize your potential, even if only for one more day. –Dani Blum\n\nListen: Wilson Phillips, “Hold On”\n\n245.\n\nRefused: “New Noise” (1998)\n\nRefused get blamed for everything that came after their genre-exploding masterwork “New Noise”: nu-metal, Hot Topic-core, rudimentary techno beats dropped casually into the breakdowns of hardcore songs. But what elevates this song above mere pastiche is its finely tuned balance. Here, the Swedish hardcore band is painfully self-serious, but also looser and more playful than most of their peers and imitators. Every part of the song does its job: The circuitous intro signals the arrival of something momentous, the verses build tension, and the choruses hit with meteoric force. With unwavering confidence, Refused promised a new sound and then actually delivered an opus that pointed a way forward for heavy music in the new millennium. –Mehan Jayasuriya\n\nListen: Refused, “New Noise”\n\n244.\n\nDeborah Cox: “Nobody’s Supposed to Be Here” (1998)\n\nDeborah Cox spent the first six months of her music career touring as a backup singer for Celine Dion, a crash course in how to make every note a spectacle. On her breakout hit, “Nobody’s Supposed to be Here,” the smallest shifts are mesmerizing—the jagged edge in her throat when she admits love has knocked her down, the way the vowel caves in when she sings the word “sad,” the shock of shriek that builds up as she belts the chorus. Gentle percussion and chimes swirl in the background, and the song winds around and around Cox’s circular thinking, as she spirals through dejection, hope, and refusal, all leading up to a cathartic key change. “I’m not supposed to care anymore,” she moans as the track trickles out, a final sigh before she gives in. –Dani Blum\n\nListen: Deborah Cox, “Nobody’s Supposed to Be Here”\n\n243.\n\nDismemberment Plan: “You Are Invited” (1999)\n\nBy the time the Dismemberment Plan released Emergency & I, in 1999, the band didn’t fit into any existing niche. Born from Washington, D.C.’s punk scene, they twitched around rhythms more like nervous jazzbos. Embraced by indie rock fans, their third album was bankrolled, and then ditched, by an easily distracted major label. Emo? Fine—but “You Are Invited,” the record’s affecting centerpiece, also did icy electronic drum throbs a year before Radiohead’s “Idioteque,” and witty post-punk speak-singing a cultural eon before LCD Soundsystem’s “Losing My Edge.” Its message, delivered by Travis Morrison with genial yearning, was simple: What if you got a sheet of paper guaranteeing you could never be left out of the party again? The uncanny similarity between the “since you’ve been gone” refrain on another great Emergency & I song, “The City,” and Kelly Clarkson’s subsequent smash hinted at D-Plan’s potential to transcend boundaries of genre and scene; on a wide-eyed journey toward fist-pumping catharsis, “You Are Invited” embodies that welcoming generosity of spirit. It’s an all-access pass to self-acceptance—and like the main character in the song, you’ll immediately want to pay it forward to the next person who needs it. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: Dismemberment Plan, “You Are Invited”\n\n242.\n\nNaughty by Nature: “Feel Me Flow” (1995)\n\nEven the most ambitious spiritual lyrical miracle MC would be hard-pressed to match the pace of Treach’s nimble tongue on “Feel Me Flow.” Yet Naughty by Nature’s missive feels less like a flex than a dare: Can you party as hard as they do? Atop a twinkling sample of the Meters’ “Find Yourself,” this 1995 song-of-the-summer candidate finds Treach stuffing bars with rhymes and mocking the nerds who can’t keep up. The East Orange, New Jersey rap group balanced their grit with a bit of goofiness (not unlike their Newark neighbor Redman), best evidenced by the accompanying music video, in which the whole hood is transported from summer on the block in Jersey to winter on the slopes in Vermont. –Matthew Ismael Ruiz\n\nListen: Naughty by Nature, “Feel Me Flow”\n\n241.\n\nRobyn: “Show Me Love” (1995)\n\nRobyn Is Here was the name of the Swedish pop wunderkind’s debut album, but could anyone have understood what a poignant and prophetic statement it would be? In the years to come, Robyn would recalibrate pop with her specific brand of shattered euphoria, songs that doused you in glitter even while seeping into your every ache. But as a teen hitmaker, she crash-landed on the U.S. charts with a handful of glinting, gooey singles. “Show Me Love” is a blast of Max Martin confection, with syrupy synths and the sugar rush of Robyn’s belt in the chorus, trapping the burgeoning star in amber. –Dani Blum\n\nListen: Robyn, “Show Me Love”\n\n240.\n\nPearl Jam: “Corduroy” (1994)\n\nThe success of grunge presented a quandary for many of its practitioners; accustomed to marinating in the untested righteousness of their anticonsumerism, they now had to grapple with the fact that millions of consumers, among them fist-pumping jocks and radio-loving dilettantes, were now wholly into their stuff. No one suffered more openly on the horns of his stardom than Eddie Vedder, who took every available opportunity to minimize the uncritical worship his band inspired. He also made maybe the best entry in the canon of pop music by famous people about the wages of fame. Pearl Jam’s “Corduroy,” off the band’s third album, Vitalogy, transcends the meager limits of the category by being irresistible about wanting to be resisted. Every move works here, from the tolling guitar arpeggios of the first few bars to Jeff Ament’s prowling bass solo that I swear is an homage to Fleetwood Mac’s “The Chain.” “I don’t want to take what you can give/I would rather starve than eat your bread,” Vedder howls at his fans, but the hook undermines his attempt to distance himself from their affections. Fame’s a bummer, the rock star laments, while the world can’t help but hum along. –Tommy Craggs\n\nListen: Pearl Jam, “Corduroy”\n\n239.\n\nJAY-Z: “Dead Presidents II” (1996)\n\nJAY-Z’s classic debut LP Reasonable Doubt sounds like little else in his catalog, with one foot planted firmly in the street and the other set to step into the boardroom. It’s peppered with prominent entries into the rap canon, but few embody his capitalist gangster ethos better than “Dead Presidents II.” The original version—released as a single ahead of the album—features the same gorgeous loop of the piano melody from Lonnie Liston Smith’s “A Garden of Peace,” but its juvenile braggadocio falls flat. The new verses on the album version exude a quieter confidence, with a tone more reflective of an underground kingpin assured of his future success. Of course, Jay’s later claim that “You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song” about the Nas sample that serves as the chorus always seemed disingenuous, because “The World Is Yours” remains one of the defining works of the boom-bap era. But “Dead Presidents II” does evince one of the reasons JAY-Z has managed to maintain relevance as various trends explode and fade into the ether: A preternatural ability to borrow from others to make something truly his own. –Matthew Ismael Ruiz\n\nFurther Reading: Reasonable Doubt Sunday Review\n\nListen: JAY-Z, “Dead Presidents II”\n\n238.\n\nBlur: “Song 2” (1997)\n\nAfter charging through the football stadium in aimless elation, soundtracked to the sound of Damon Albarn’s “WOO-HOO,” Moe Szyslak turns to Homer Simpson and says, impatiently: “We’ve been running around cheering for an hour! Where the hell’s the game?” The 1999 Simpsons bit perfectly taps into the spirit of Blur’s atypically free-spirited “Song 2,” a flippant yet propulsive FRAP of a track that can make grown men earnestly lose their shit before they realize they’ve been had. A parody of post-grunge American rock that was originally presented to their label as a joke, “Song 2” swept up the very market it was meant to be mocking. With its 12-beers-deep nonsense lyrics and car alarm power chords, the track—irresistible as it is—was ubiquitous during sporting events in the ’90s, signaling each touchdown and post-match celebration. May its capacity to cause male onset zoomies never wane. –Emma Madden\n\nListen: Blur, “Song 2”\n\n237.\n\nGin Blossoms: “Hey Jealousy” (1992)\n\nWith singer Robin Wilson as his amplifier, Gin Blossoms’ core songwriter Doug Hopkins could wring honey out of his heart’s most festering wounds. The Arizona rock band’s signature hit lights up a last-ditch effort to claw back a lost love from the ruins of one’s own mistakes. “If you don’t expect too much from me/You might not be let down,” Wilson sings, the words rippling out uncannily smooth, their inherent desperation buffed to a shine. The levity in the song’s arrangement—the jangling guitar arpeggios, the shivers of tambourine—belie the weight of the addiction and mental illness Hopkins found himself tangled in while writing, which dragged him to his death a few months after “Hey Jealousy” got a foothold on the pop charts. But the lyrics hide nothing, their abyssal despair and fevered hope laid bare in the curl of a perfect hook. –Sasha Geffen\n\nListen: Gin Blossoms, “Hey Jealousy”\n\n236.\n\nBroadcast: “Echo’s Answer” (1999)\n\nEvery moment of “Echo’s Answer” feels like it is falling in and out of focus. It is a tone and mood befitting Broadcast, a band that was born from ’60s club nights in their native Birmingham, England and grew within a UK scene anchored by similarly psychedelic pop groups like Stereolab and Pram. Broadcast distinguished themselves through dub-like production techniques and jazzy drumming that made their work as slippery and mysterious as the undulating wax in a lava lamp. On this track, though, even the most solid component of the band’s work, the enchanting vocals of the late Trish Keenan, vanishes in the haze with lyrics that elude easy interpretation and a post-production effect that swallows her last line into a wormhole. The only appropriate course of action is to follow her down. –Robert Ham\n\nListen: Broadcast, “Echo’s Answer”\n\n235.\n\nTracy Chapman: “Give Me One Reason” (1995)\n\nIn 1988, Tracy Chapman’s influential self-titled album and breakthrough “Fast Car” presaged the folk revival to come. Yet throughout the ’90s, critics called her music “dour,” never truly grasping the complexity with which Chapman integrated stories of disenfranchisement and poverty alongside her gently melodic love songs. On 1995’s New Beginning, Chapman found her second wind through an album that brightened the corners of her folk music with an eye toward renewal and environmentalism (the CD even came bundled with a coupon for a packet of seeds to be redeemed at her shows). “Give Me One Reason” is the record’s bluesy highlight and her biggest hit to date, strutting along a plucked, head-nodding guitar melody and Chapman’s grainy alto. Centering on an imbalanced relationship, each verse grows more frustrated from a lack of reciprocity; then the band kicks in and the pleading in her voice becomes cathartic, begging for a reason to stay while knowing it won’t come. The bittersweet ultimatum seemed to bloom out of years of romantic frustration, but in Chapman’s voice and arrangement it becomes a balm, guiding listeners through the push and pull of loving someone who can’t give you what you need. –Eric Torres\n\nListen: Tracy Chapman, “Give Me One Reason”\n\n234.\n\nKorn: “Freak on a Leash” (1999)\n\nJonathan Davis knew he was trapped. The Bakersfield misfits of Korn were becoming the outlandish stars of ascendant nu-metal, so to make their third album, they tapped endless industry spoils: a recording budget nearing a million, a ceaseless stream of booze and blow, a vocal coach literally punching Davis in the back. But he also bristled at sudden commodity status, knowing free stuff wasn’t actually freedom. “Freak on a Leash” is the sound of pariahs pounding against asylum walls, of demanding to be let out despite being permanent hostages, “a cheap fuck for me to lay.” Those pinprick guitars are tin snips taken to barbed wire, that lashing rhythm section a sledgehammer against an armored door. The dangerous assault, though, comes after two minutes, with the era’s most unhinged vocal paroxysm—Davis’ beat-boxed glossolalia, 27 terrifying, cathartic, and sort of hilarious seconds where frustration overruns the capacity of language. When Davis commands “Go!” imagine yourself rushing the gates, too, outrunning bullets at your back. –Grayson Haver Currin\n\nListen: Korn, “Freak on a Leash”\n\n233.\n\nCypress Hill: “How I Could Just Kill a Man” (1991)\n\nThe B-side to Cypress Hill’s debut single “The Phuncky Feel One,” this West Coast anthem was much of the world’s introduction to the bong-toking cholos that would help define the gangsta rap sounds coming out of Southern California in the early ’90s. With boom-bap drums punctuated by the squeal of sampled horns, “How I Could Just Kill A Man” is the battle cry of disaffected youth driven to meet violence with violence. In some ways it sits on other side of the same coin as Ice Cube’s “It Was a Good Day”; where Cube’s good fortune guides him away from the gaze of corrupt cops and carjackers, B-Real faces it head-on, dismissing detractors who could never understand the daily dangers he faces. “So how do you know where I'm at, when you haven't been where I've been?” he asks, already knowing the answer: It’s easy to declare violence is not the solution when you never have to face it. –Matthew Ismael Ruiz\n\nListen: Cypress Hill, “How I Could Just Kill a Man”\n\n232.\n\nBrian Eno / John Cale: “Lay My Love” (1990)\n\nLike the best art from devotional poets John Milton or John Donne, one of Brian Eno’s masterworks is a hymnal from a funny angle—not upward, from man to his unknowable God, but southward, from its point of view back down. “I am the wheel,” Eno drones sunnily, in a pop song that sounds aerially suspended. “I am the turning.”\n\nMaybe this beatific rush was a product of Eno’s somewhat fighty relationship with collaborator John Cale; maybe it was shaped out of the runoff from the semi-liquid ambient classic Thursday Afternoon, released five years before it; or maybe just from a random pang of bliss in the long wake of his emancipation from Roxy Music. Who’s to say. A single card from Eno’s Oblique Strategies deck of creative prompts might be most explanatory of “Lay Your Love”’s magic, monkish kiss to and from the divine. It bears one word against a white void: “Courage!” –Mina Tavakoli\n\nListen: Brian Eno / John Cale, “Lay My Love”\n\n231.\n\nCeline Dion: “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now” (1996)\n\nJim Steinman, the mad genius who wrote “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now,” said he was inspired by the novel Wuthering Heights, and compared it to “Heathcliff digging up Cathy’s corpse and dancing with it in the cold moonlight.” This is important to remember, because there is no scene in Wuthering Heights where Heathcliff digs up Cathy’s corpse and dances with it in the cold moonlight. But this haunted and windswept romantic fantasia is what’s conjured by Celine Dion’s spirit-galvanizing rendition of Steinman’s song. Dion, the most successful balladeer of the ’90s, summons all the power in her soul and lungs to commune with the dead, the theatrically proggy arrangement crescendoing behind her. She sings about making love so intense it’s banned by the law; she’s joined by a reassuring chorus who agree, yes, that feeling she remembers is coming back to her now, Dion isn’t just making this up. Her passion hits an apex as she sings “baby, baby, baby” like she’s squeezing her hand through a tight space to reach the afterlife. It’s the stuff of romance novels, even if it never literally happened in one. –Jeremy Gordon\n\nListen: Céline Dion, “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now”\n\n230.\n\nCornershop: “Brimful of Asha” (1997)\n\nIn 2011, Asha Bhosle recalled the time that “Brimful of Asha” helped her through the immigration desk at London’s Heathrow Airport. When the officer on the desk quizzed her on her profession as singer, she offered the silky, languorous indie-pop Cornershop song as a reference—not because it was one of the thousands she’d appeared on over her years as a Bollywood playback singer, but rather because it was one written in her honor. By then—thanks mostly to a pitched-up earworm of a big-beat-era Fatboy Slim remix—the song was a core component of rose-tinted nostalgia for the late ’90s. For a song about recognition—fighting for it, or being denied it—by a political, punkish, Punjabi-led band who’d named themselves after the racial stereotype of British Asians owning convenience stores, Bhosle’s immigration play was perhaps a fitting encounter. After all, in Hindi, the name Asha also means “hope.” –Will Pritchard\n\nListen: Cornershop, “Brimful of Asha”\n\n229.\n\nBoyz II Men: “Motownphilly” (1991)\n\nWas life really ever as earnest and pure as Boyz II Men’s “Motownphilly” music video made it out to be? In 1991, when the fledgling Philly group released its first single, it was all youthful exuberance spilling out in oversized pink blazers, matching bow ties, and snazzy horn riffs. (Also: If Tik Tok teens haven’t studied this choreography yet, they are missing out.) Michael Bivins of New Edition and Bell Biv DeVoe appeared on the track, which features classic soul harmonies over a new jack swing beat, as well as a totally gratuitous doo-wop showcase at the end. Not too hard and not too soft, the song ushered in the decade of copycat (and largely whitewashed) boy bands that would follow. –Emma Carmichael\n\nListen: Boyz II Men, “Motownphilly”\n\n228.\n\nSoundgarden: “Black Hole Sun” (1994)\n\nNASA recently shared what a black hole really sounds like, and it turns out that Soundgarden wasn’t so far off. Summer anthems are rarely as dark as night, but for a band drenched in Seattle’s stormy ethos, it’s fitting that their biggest hit was this masterfully trippy power-dirge. Sporting a famous video full of apocalyptic suburbanites with over-sized eyes, “Black Hole Sun” begins with dreamlike guitars and Chris Cornell in full croon. Eeriness immediately invades, before the crunch of Cornell and Kim Thayil’s drop D guitars drive everything further down the rabbit hole. “Heaven send hell away,” Cornell pleads, “No one sings like you anymore.” The sentiment resonated all the more as it blasted from radios at the crest of the Seattle rock wave, just months after Kurt Cobain died. –Jessica Letkemann\n\nFurther Reading: Superunknown Reissue Review\n\nListen: Soundgarden, “Black Hole Sun”\n\n227.\n\nGoodie Mob: “Cell Therapy” (1995)\n\nJust because Goodie Mob were paranoid didn’t mean people weren’t following them. While this ad-hoc crew of OutKast affiliates had never recorded a song together before the sessions that would become 1995’s Soul Food, their debut album’s bone-chilling hit laid out a lasting template for how Southern hip-hop could be at once conscious and crunk. “Cell Therapy” was both menacing and menaced, fucked up by conspiracy theories but also the conspiratorial realities of systemic racism. Its gutturally drawled, often-surreal vision of life near the trap would be familiar to Atlanta viewers, let alone EarthGang or Denzel Curry listeners, and its eerie, dub-cavernous production also set a course so irresistible that it was echoed by Gorillaz and sampled by Travis Scott. But the song’s most resonant association is the moment it soundtracks in Barry Jenkins’ classic 2016 film Moonlight: Our now full-grown hero wakes from a nightmare, looking tough as nails, scarred within by trauma that’s deeper than the red Georgia clay. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: Goodie Mob, “Cell Therapy”\n\n226.\n\nAlice in Chains: “Would?” (1992)\n\nThe darkness underneath “Would?” has belied its tenure as a rock radio staple since its release in 1992. Layne Staley wrote the song about Andrew Wood, the lead singer of fellow grunge band Mother Love Bone, who died of an overdose in 1990. All that pain and grief funnels into the song’s final minute, which also happens to be the final minute of Dirt, Alice in Chains’ hour-long march through a fetid Seattle carnival of depression, suicide, and heroin. Staley does a kind of whammy bar dive-bomb effect on his voice on “mista-a-a-a-ke” before unveiling its upper register; drummer Sean Kinney gets a nice fill showcase; the band ends on a unison five-note rubato car honk: “If I would, could you?” The question “Would?” asks becomes hellaciously macabre in light of Staley’s overdose death in 2002, but the song stands as a long-lasting totem of the Seattle scene’s heavy sound and heavier struggles. –Jeremy D. Larson\n\nFurther Reading: Dirt Sunday Review\n\nListen: Alice in Chains, “Would?”\n\n225.\n\nJawbox: “Savory” (1994)\n\nJawbox’s “Savory” was one of the unlikeliest alt-rock crossover bids of 1994. Instead of gambling on the tidy production style that decided many a punk band’s fate at the time, the Dischord expats drilled deeper into their fiery essence for the first single off their major label debut. Propelled by an evil swing with dangerous riptides underneath, the song keeps things tense even in the tuneful chorus. Though “Savory” aired on MTV’s 120 Minutes and Beavis and Butt-Head, its blunted serration skidded off the mainstream, and the band’s deadpan mien and newfound penchant for formal dress didn’t make their cryptic music any more accessible. But those same intractable qualities set the song apart as one of the heaviest, grooviest, most soulful post-hardcore anthems ever. –Brian Howe\n\nListen: Jawbox, “Savory”\n\n224.\n\nLuniz: “I Got 5 on It” (1995)\n\nDid Luniz always intend “I Got 5 on It” to sound so sinister? The Bay Area rap duo wrote the song, their lone hit, about going 50-50 on a dime bag, and on paper it’s a celebration of the rituals and etiquette of social smoking. But the musky, nocturnal beat, built from a corroded sample of R&B group Club Nouveau’s late ‘80s hit “Why You Treat Me So Bad,” turned the track into an exercise in paranoia. It wasn’t a stretch, then, when Jordan Peele absorbed the track into the score for his 2019 horror movie Us. The raps invite you to chip in; the beat cautions you to beware. –Evan Rytlewski\n\nListen: Luniz, “I Got 5 on It”\n\n223.\n\nThe La’s: “There She Goes” (1990)\n\nSometimes credited as the opening salvo of Britpop—Noel Gallagher once declared it his favorite song of the ’90s—this delicious single certainly owes poetic debt to the Velvet Underground’s “There She Goes Again.” On first listen it sounds like a lost ’60s classic stripped to the beams, just an indelibly repeated chorus with sly variations over Byrdsian guitar chime. The melody, parsed out over a seven-word juggling of the title, is irresistible; the jangling riffs appeal to a cultural sweet tooth that the Smiths’ Johnny Marr and R.E.M.’s Peter Buck reawakened in the ’80s. The lyrics play with the classic love-is-the-drug metaphor so expertly that the song joined the ranks of alleged pop paeans to heroin while simultaneously inviting an excellent cover by Christian alt-rock charmers Sixpence None the Richer. It’s a perfect earworm that leaves its parting strum unresolved just enough to make you want—need—to hear it again. –Will Hermes\n\nListen: The La’s, “There She Goes”\n\n222.\n\nRuPaul: “Supermodel (You Better Work)” (1992)\n\nAn entire drag ecosystem earning a small country’s GDP would simply not exist without RuPaul’s 1992 single, which ushered in a catchphrase that, 30 years later, lives on in the Drag Race multiverse: “Sashay, shantay.” A club queen who’d frequented New York’s most storied downtown establishments (and the Shaque D’Amour) and established herself as a beloved weirdo in a scene full of them, Ru’s runway-empowerment house track got heavy rotation on MTV when such things still mattered, becoming a mainstream hit in an underdog-friendly year. (Kurt Cobain loved this song, resulting in the iconic photo of Ru and her skyscraper beehive holding a crying Francis Bean at the ’93 VMAs.) Ru was a 6’4 drag queen cheekily instructing listeners to “make love to the camera,” but it didn’t read as a novelty. It was a perfect pop song for the supermodel era, and one that launched a thousand drag careers, with mother Ru and her bigass wig at the forefront, catwalking the filthy streets of ’90s NYC. –Julianne Escobedo Shepherd\n\nListen: RuPaul, “Supermodel (You Better Work)”\n\n221.\n\nVeruca Salt: “Seether” (1994)\n\nThe version of you who scrawls venomous graffiti on bathroom walls, who claps back at bullies, who keeps a running hit list and lies awake plotting revenge? She is the Seether, the alter-ego antihero in the song that took Chicago four-piece Veruca Salt from alt-rock obscurity to the main stage of Glastonbury in just a year. “Seether” is bubblegrunge at its finest, all guitar fuzz and pop stickiness and crackling angst animating a personification of anger that just can’t be leashed. “I try to cram her back in my mouth,” co-frontwoman Nina Gordon sings in the verse, but she didn’t really try that hard. The Seether is everywhere, most recently on the lips of Olivia Rodrigo and fans who discovered the song through her live cover—a new generation blessed with a soundtrack for their righteous rage. –Olivia Horn\n\nListen: Veruca Salt, “Seether”\n\n220.\n\nBlur: “Girls & Boys” (1994)\n\nThe nu-disco lead single from Blur’s Parklife, “Girls & Boys” might have been a sonic outlier in their ambitious catalog, but it was quintessentially Blur in its pithy observations of middle-class English culture. “It’s the travels of the mystical lager-eater,” Damon Albarn said of his inspiration: an Essex bloke en vacance, sunburned and stumbling through Majorca nightclubs. “Girls & Boys” remains one of the finest examples of a rock band crossing over into dance music, thanks largely to Alex James’ buoyant bassline and Graham Coxon’s assertively sour guitar work, which provided the tart top note in an otherwise candy-coated banger. His dissonance mimicked Albarn’s paradise, plagued by bad omens like paranoid love and looming unemployment. Is this a holiday—or sun-drenched hell? –Madison Bloom\n\nListen: Blur, “Girls & Boys”\n\n219.\n\nElvis Crespo: “Suavemente” (1999)\n\nIn 1998, merengue was on its last legs in the Latin music market—until Puerto Rican vocalist Elvis Crespo came along and dropped the surprise smash hit “Suavemente.” Since then, there’s absolutely no way you’ll attend any Latino cookout, wedding, or party without watching everyone run out of their seats to the dancefloor once the opening a cappella—“Suavemente, Bésame/Yo quiero sentir tus labios” or “Kiss me softly, I want to feel your lips”—hits, before exploding into horns, güira, and percussion that feels like unending swooning euphoria. “Suavemente” gave merengue its glorious breakthrough for mainstream audiences; while it may not be the biggest Latin hit of the ’90s, there are few that remain as beloved and feel-good romantic to your tias. –Gio Santiago\n\nListen: Elvis Crespo, “Suavemente”\n\n218.\n\nThird Eye Blind: “Semi-Charmed Life” (1997)\n\nThere’s a sneering swagger to the way Third Eye Blind sang about disaffection and apathy on their debut single, “Semi-Charmed Life.” They were losers like Beck but combative about it, as if to say: Gaze upon us, ye professional managerial class, and despair. Nestled within the sunshine guitar riff and the “doot doot doot” harmonies borrowed from Lou Reed was a cautionary tale about crystal meth addiction, and falling into a lifestyle that sucks up the years before you realize they’re gone. Seemed bad, but on the other hand: doot doot doot, doot doot-doot doot. It was the rollicking Clinton years, the end of history, and “Semi-Charmed Life” was big-tent solipsism for a generation of dirtbags and college graduates wondering “is this it?” as they navigated adulthood during a period of halcyon global stability. Well, we know what came next. –Jeremy Gordon\n\nListen: Third Eye Blind, “Semi-Charmed Life”\n\n217.\n\nShanice: “I Love Your Smile” (1991)\n\nThat doo-doo-doo-doo refrain: a starburst melody that simultaneously feels like it must have always existed and was surely beamed to Shanice from the heavens in a moment of celestial magic. “I Love Your Smile” is all about young romance and the joy that uncontrollably bursts from your chest cavity. Funky drums and a prominent bassline adds a streetwise undercurrent to the singer’s effervescence. Though the radio edit foolishly omits Shanice’s rap verse, her rudimentary rhymes attest to feelings of doubt, with the sound of thunder bringing a sudden seriousness to her voice. But then she releases the tension with a laugh, making way for a sax solo by none other than Branford Marsalis, the sun bursting through the clouds once more. –Dean Van Nguyen\n\nListen: Shanice, “I Love Your Smile”\n\n216.\n\nBlink-182: “Dammit” (1997)\n\nBlink-182 wrote dozens of songs about being teenagers, so it’s ironic that the most enduring is also the most mature. The San Diego trio was riding the tide of local fame when this quintessential ode to growing up came out; within a couple of years, it had vaulted them into the Billboard Hot 100 and late-night TV. Its iconic guitar riff begins by simply moving up the major scale—about as rudimentary as it gets, but thematically perfect for a song about the travails of growing past childhood—with a tempo just fast enough to provide an actual challenge for all the kids it inspired to pick up the instrument. With “Dammit,” Blink-182 evolved from their juvenile skate-punk origins to a (slightly) more grown-up sound, worthy of the radio domination that would soon come. –Nina Corcoran\n\nListen: Blink-182, “Dammit”\n\n215.\n\nBlackstreet: “No Diggity” [ft. Dr. Dre and Queen Pen] (1996)\n\nAfter almost single-handedly reshaping the course of pop music as the pioneer of New Jack Swing in the late ’80s, singer-songwriter-producer Teddy Riley led his group Blackstreet to a career peak with this 1996 party anthem. One of the stickiest hip-hop/R&B hybrids of all time, “No Diggity” is so stacked with pleading, arm-waving pleasures that a stingier producer probably could have partitioned it out into three or four distinct hits. Along with that melodic abundance, the track heaves one larger-than-life voice on top of the next: Dr. Dre’s linebacker huff, Chauncey “Black” Hannibal’s chesty croon (“SHEEEE’S got class AND STYLE”), and an acrobatic verse from rapper Queen Pen. A nodding Bill Withers sample hangs over it all, like the voice of God himself looking down approvingly on this ridiculously good time. –Evan Rytlewski\n\nListen: Blackstreet, “No Diggity” [ft. Dr. Dre and Queen Pen]\n\n214.\n\nGarbage: “Stupid Girl” (1995)\n\nWhen he wasn’t stewarding Nirvana’s Nevermind, enigmatic producer Butch Vig spent the first half of the ’90s stripping pop for parts, reworking songs by Nine Inch Nails, EMF, and Depeche Mode and leaving just their core vocals intact. Perhaps it’s unsurprising that when Vig endeavored to condense his pop philosophies into a new venture, he had everything he needed for a hit with “Stupid Girl”—a drum sample ripped from the Clash, guitars pumped through a grab bag of effects, a bassline that flirted with the blues—except a vocalist.\n\nShirley Manson didn’t just fill the void; on “Stupid Girl,” the Scottish singer stared into it and sneered. Manson’s low register added a seductive and soulful element to the surgical studio glean of Garbage’s production, but she also, crucially, added a deadpan simplicity as a lyricist. Was “Stupid Girl” a diss track? Was it empowering? Was it even about a girl? Manson coyly avoided obvious answers, but the tremble in her voice on the final bridge hints that it could just as well be about the woman singing it. –Arielle Gordon\n\nListen: Garbage, “Stupid Girl”\n\n213.\n\nLil’ Kim: “Big Momma Thang” (1996)\n\nLil’ Kim arrived in 1995 as the most colorful member of Biggie’s Junior M.A.F.I.A., multitasking as the mistress, sexual deviant, and superstar in the crew. Her debut album Hard Core is a complicated declaration of freedom, and “Big Momma Thang“ is Kim activating all of her multitudes: filthy, tough, conceited. The minute she spit the first line—“I used to be scared of the dick/Now I throw lips to the shit”—it opened up a wormhole to an explicit world for women both inside and outside hip-hop. The rest of the song, two verses spliced with a few meddlesome Jay-Z bars, is a PSA about her hopes and dreams, including 24 orgasms and carats, and ultimately her worth. –Clover Hope\n\nListen: Lil’ Kim, “Big Momma Thang”\n\n212.\n\n4 Non Blondes: “What’s Up?” (1992)\n\nBuilt around a vocal performance so huge that it nearly swallows the song’s jangly guitar riff, “What’s Up?” is the sound of wild mood swings happening in real time. Frontwoman Linda Perry sang about being 25, exhausted by the pain of everyday living, and frustrated by the slow pace of personal and political progress, with the sincerity of someone young enough to keep striving for something better. Impossible to slot neatly into a genre, the track threw Perry into conflict with veteran producer David Tickle—who tried to rewrite her lyrics, among other unnecessary interventions—and forced her to fight for the eclectic, eccentric voice that would make her a sought-after pop songwriter in the aughts. The song is essential not just to Perry’s origin story, but also to creating an overwhelming—perhaps chemically altered—rush of emotion that has fueled three decades of crying jags and karaoke jams. –Judy Berman\n\nListen: 4 Non Blondes, “What’s Up?”\n\n211.\n\nWhitney Houston: “I’m Every Woman” (1992)\n\nBy the time Whitney Houston’s rendition of the Chaka Khan anthem “I’m Every Woman” dropped, she was already an international star racking up countless awards, sold-out venues on world tours, and solidifying her spot as one of the greatest vocalists of all time. As a musician, she was on top of the world, which made her first foray into film all the more precarious. The Bodyguard wasn’t exactly a cinematic breakthrough, but it produced the most successful soundtrack of any movie ever, and the ease with which Houston carried its classic banger immediately revived its anthemic status. Pulling out the disco that underlined the Chaka Khan original, Houston’s version brings us to church, soft and welcoming, as her voice carries us for the first full minute before the beat drops. Walk into any nightclub, drag show, or karaoke bar (should you dare), and euphoria will take over the room should this song come on, lifting us up. At that moment, we are every woman. –Samhita Mukhopadhyay\n\nListen: Whitney Houston, “I’m Every Woman”\n\n210.\n\nTemple of the Dog: “Hunger Strike” (1991)\n\nPearl Jam didn’t even exist when Soundgarden’s Chris Cornell beckoned Eddie Vedder to duet on this plaintive power ballad, but what began as Cornell’s unfinished elegy for fallen Mother Love Bone singer Andrew Wood came to crown the accidental Seattle supergroup led by members of two of the scene’s biggest bands. Beyond its quintessential Seattle sound—especially those gentle-to-crunchy guitars, courtesy of nascent Pearl Jammers Mike McCready and Stone Gossard—the call-and-response of Cornell’s multi-octave roar and Vedder’s distinctive bari-tenor echoing the same lines over and over elevated the track into a classic. Incredibly, Vedder first stepped up to Cornell’s mic to belt this one out during his week-long Pearl Jam audition in the rehearsal space the then-forming band shared with Temple of the Dog. Spoiler: Vedder got the job. –Jessica Letkemann\n\nListen: Temple of the Dog, “Hunger Strike”\n\n209.\n\nThe KLF: “3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)” (1991)\n\nResiding cozily among Nelson and New Kids on the Block singles, house tracks manufactured by hook-savvy British and European producers made early 1990s pop radio a less traumatic experience. British stadium-house pranksters Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond conceived “3 a.m. Eternal” as a rap-conversant and club-designed worldwide smush; the title parenthetical, another of their knee-slappers, refers to the desk at which Cauty and Drummond mixed this not-live-in-the-slightest track. Yet “3 a.m. Eternal” generates the endorphin rush of a good concert experience and a better dose of MDMA. Besides its walloping rhythm, double-reed oboe solo, and creamy pre-chorus, it hurls spitballs like “bass ballistics” and “sample city through Trancentral,” not to mention the useful maxim “time is eternal.” What many who made “3 a.m. Eternal” a Top 5 hit remember, though, are the chant—“KLF is gonna ROCK YA!”—and a four-note bleep-hook tapped out on one of those period brick cell phones. Not many Euro-house tracks sported one of those. –Alfred Soto\n\nListen: The KLF, “3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)”\n\n208.\n\nBelly: “Feed the Tree” (1993)\n\nBy the early 1990s, a decade as a second-string guitarist-songwriter for Throwing Muses and three parallel years in the Breeders still hadn’t brought out the full range of Tanya Donelly’s talent for tweaking Gothic cliches about madwomen in attics. Using demos she had initially prepared for a second Breeders album, she formed Belly, a group that could pivot from twinkling, sugar-spun ballads to impressively muscular power pop. “Feed the Tree,” released in early 1993 after months of buzz, takes advantage of Donelly’s talent for punching holes in the wall with a killer chorus. Tom Gorman’s serpentine riff coils around the verses while bassist Fred Abong and drummer Chris Gorman keep their rhythms flippy-floppy. The result: an unexpected hit, gold-certified album, and Grammy nomination in a year when major-label moguls polished their glasses and studied those weird-ass little “modern rock” bands. Take your hats off, boys! –Alfred Soto\n\nListen: Belly, “Feed the Tree”\n\n207.\n\nTeenage Fanclub: “The Concept” (1991)\n\nSome of the best power-pop songs are about the feeling of being turned on by music itself as much as any romantic interest: Big Star’s “Thirteen” looked back on “Paint It, Black,” and the Replacements’ “Alex Chilton” paid homage to the titular Big Star frontman. “The Concept,” the misty and melancholic opening song from Teenage Fanclub’s breakthrough record Bandwagonesque, starts out describing a denim-clad girl who buys records by Status Quo, an obscure ’60s group. By the fist-pumping coda—a marvel of searing guitars, bombastic drums, and wistful three-part harmonies—it’s clear that frontman Norman Blake isn’t in love with the girl so much as he relishes the idea of being in the band onstage, basking in the glow of raised lighters. It’s a fantasy that Teenage Fanclub in some sense made real—Bandwagonesque famously beat out Nirvana’s Nevermind on SPIN’s best albums of the year list—and it exists anew every time someone plugs into power-pop’s nostalgic charge. –Marc Hogan\n\nFurther Reading: Bandwagonesque Reissue Review\n\nListen: Teenage Fanclub, “The Concept”\n\n206.\n\nMark Morrison: “Return of the Mack” (1996)\n\nIn hindsight, there’s a slight irony to the massive success of “Return of the Mack,” given that Mark Morrison was never quite able to capitalize on his deliciously petty signature song: It’s a return in search of a departure, a comeback without a debut. In the years that followed his smash hit, a slick and triumphant British Invasion of the American R&B charts with a heavy ragga-tinged beat, Morrison’s career would implode due to constant legal troubles—most infamously the time he hired a lookalike to do his court-mandated community service while he went on tour. The resentment and bitterness exemplified by his lone hit might have been Morrison’s undoing when it came to career longevity, but “Return of the Mack” spins negativity into cathartic gold, a walking-on-air anthem designed to be played on repeat during those times when you need to manifest sweet comeuppance into reality. –Nadine Smith\n\nListen: Mark Morrison, “Return of the Mack”\n\n205.\n\nNew Radicals: “You Get What You Give” (1998)\n\nNo other ’90s artifact about selling out has endured like “You Get What You Give.” New Radicals leader Gregg Alexander yelped about sticking it to the man, trashing cars, and disrespecting his retail premises, all to the kind of peak CD-era pop-rock that fattened the man’s wallet and made U2 jealous. It’s survived because there’s not a drop of cynicism in it. Alexander considers the communal joy of forging an alternative, sung with irrepressible certainty that you are the antidote. The euphoric hit was too pure for this world and only grows more poignant in time: A disillusioned Alexander split up the band one single later, war broke out, and it turned out there was, allegedly, more than enough reason to want to kick Marilyn Manson’s ass in. But for the four-and-a-half minutes of this song—which, by the way, once inspired a defeated Joni Mitchell to keep making music—the dreamer’s disease still rages beautifully. –Laura Snapes\n\nListen: New Radicals, “You Get What You Give”\n\n204.\n\nDa Brat: “Funkdafied” (1994)\n\nDa Brat’s swift ’90s rise is the stuff of hip-hop fairy tales. After winning a rap competition hosted by MTV, the young Chicago MC met producer Jermaine Dupri, inked a record deal, and began work on her debut album. She dropped the title track in May of ’94; by summer’s end, it had peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. Bumping to a sample of the Isley Brothers’ baby-maker “Between the Sheets,” “Funkdafied” wrapped Da Brat’s jabbing, sassy flow in synthesized strings and a slinking bassline. The single baptized Da “Brat-tat-tat-tat” as a trailblazer—a bar-spitting tomboy who resisted the industry’s appetite for more sexualized packaging. As “Funkdafied” cruised the airwaves, she became the first solo female rapper to go platinum. “I’m on a roll in control like Janet,” she snaps in the third verse—her nod to royalty as she snatched her own crown. –Madison Bloom\n\nListen: Da Brat, “Funkdafied”\n\n203.\n\nCat Power: “Cross Bones Style” (1998)\n\nYou could spend a lifetime trying to detangle the spell cast by “Cross Bones Style,” with its twilit guitars and peppy percussion that never quite falls in step with Chan Marshall’s voice. Searching for some kind of impossible salvation in the eyes of a child who has seen too much, her vocals are doubled—weary yet hopeful, meditative and pleading—like a rope that braids and frays. Cat Power’s songs have protested the cruelties we inflict on each other; yet the abstracted poetry of “Cross Bones Style,” inspired by two orphans whose parents were killed in South Africa’s blood diamond mines, is both frighteningly specific and lingers like a myth. –Owen Myers\n\nListen: Cat Power, “Cross Bones Style”\n\n202.\n\nMos Def: “Ms. Fat Booty” (1999)\n\nThe genius of producer Ayatollah’s flip of Aretha Franklin’s “One Step Ahead” is twofold: The sampled song’s lyrics speak directly to the conundrum Mos Def (now known as Yasiin Bey) writes about on “Ms. Fat Booty,” and it’s also conceivably the record playing on the jukebox when the object of Mos’ affection blows him off during their first meeting. This is the rare love song that ends not in bliss or heartbreak but with the speaker’s deflating realization that he simply can’t keep up. The spark of recognition and last-call conspiracy gives way to an infatuation that consumes him but ebbs for her, made all the worse by the fact that you can see it from the front. –Paul A. Thompson\n\nListen: Mos Def: “Ms. Fat Booty”\n\n201.\n\nHole: “Doll Parts” (1994)\n\nOn “Doll Parts,” singer, guitarist, and songwriter Courtney Love dissects herself into slivers. Fake eyes, legs, and arms all fall at odd angles, their connective elastic snapped. When some men want women, they divide them in this way: reduce them to anatomical segments, seize upon a part, and throw away the rest.\n\nFame can do this to a person, too, a fact that Love knew well by the time Hole released their second album, Live Through This. In the years since the raw smolder of the band’s 1991 debut, Pretty on the Inside, she had become half of a globally surveilled couple alongside Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain, been the subject of multiple media scandals, and felt the scathing, desirous gaze the world casts on a woman who won’t fit any of its molds. With “Doll Parts,” Love crawls inside that mangling hunger and inverts it. She turns herself into plaster and then ignites the replica with her want. In pieces, charred and deformed, she begs to swallow the world, to make it feel the same pain that’s accumulated for decades in her gut. –Sasha Geffen\n\nListen: Hole, “Doll Parts”\n\n200.\n\nMaxwell: “Ascension (Don’t Ever Wonder)” (1996)\n\nIs Maxwell talking about love on “Ascension (Don’t Ever Wonder),” the second single from Maxwell’s Urban Hang Suite? A woman? God? Drugs? Maybe all of the above, which is why the chorus penetrates your soul: You know the feeling when something takes you to a place you’ve never been before. The album sequencing suggested it was about the throbbing crescendo of intimate and sexual love, which didn’t stop the song from being beloved by church choirs—it is, after all, a Biblical reference. The track evokes an ethereal lightness, an angelic warmth that hugs you and elevates you higher, above yourself, to a new tier of consciousness. –Samhita Mukhopadhyay\n\nListen: Maxwell, “Ascension (Don’t Ever Wonder)”\n\n199.\n\nHelium: “Pat’s Trick” (1995)\n\nOn the surface, “Pat’s Trick” is an index of mid-’90s slacker-rock tropes: that chunky, rickety groove; that low-slung and loose-stringed sound; those tinny harmonies; and the countenance of bored contempt that singer-guitarist Mary Timony wears in the video. But the wonderful strangeness of her music can’t help but glow through.\n\nThe lead single from Helium’s Matador debut The Dirt of Luck, “Pat’s Trick” is as mysterious a creature as the one silhouetted in its lyrics. The riffs and words are both squirmy and stunted, surging with the power of change. Too cool to raise her voice, Timony spread it over blistered crags of guitar and slashes of thick bass chords. It’s the most accessible portal into Helium’s thorned, enchanted world. –Brian Howe\n\nListen: Helium, “Pat’s Trick”\n\n198.\n\nAcen: “Trip II the Moon (Pt. 1 and 2)” (1992)\n\nThese indelible slices of 1992 hardcore—in the breakbeat sense—build on a delirious premise delivered in chipmunk falsetto. The repeated vocal snippet expresses the foundational rave desire to be taken higher, perhaps by then-nascent smart drugs, perhaps to the title’s heavenly body. (“Pt. 1”’s whirligig ending suggests UFO involvement.) One thing’s for sure: The voice itself couldn’t rise an iota further before slipping beyond human hearing. It pushes at intelligibility much as the track pushes past any semblance of early-’90s pop normalcy. This is a raucous blender montage of samples and effects, the beat a comforting throughline amid candy-colored chaos. Cinematic samples decorate riotous percussion, taking occasional breaks for proto-drop near-silences. “Pt. 2” is downtempo only by comparison: drums deeper, pace considered, vocals sodden from exertion. A trip to the moon means going up, but at some point you gotta land. Acen eases us down. –Marc Weidenbaum\n\nListen: Acen, “Trip II the Moon (Pt. 1 and 2)”\n\n197.\n\nL7: “Pretend We’re Dead” (1992)\n\nIn 1991, outraged by Reagan and Bush Sr.’s years of attacks on reproductive freedom and galvanized by Anita Hill’s testimony against Clarence Thomas, the L.A. punk band L7 co-founded Rock for Choice, a benefit concert series raising money for abortion rights groups. (Over the course of the following 13 years, Rock for Choice would feature almost every major alt-rock band, from Nirvana to Rage Against the Machine to No Doubt, and raise hundreds of thousands of dollars.) The following year, L7 released “Pretend We’re Dead,” a protest anthem that bottled their activist spirit into four minutes of grunge perfection. Singer-guitarist Donita Sparks warned against the danger of political apathy over riffs as heavy as bricks; the only way forward was to “turn the tables with our unity,” she beckoned. Thirty years later, the consequences of that unheeded warning are catastrophic beyond anything L7 could have imagined. –Amy Phillips\n\nListen: L7, “Pretend We’re Dead”\n\n196.\n\nFiona Apple: “Sleep to Dream” (1996)\n\nReleased when she was 18 years old, the first song on Fiona Apple’s debut album is a mature and clear-eyed statement of self-determination—whether you read it as a breakup song or a preemptive, prescient rejoinder to the small minds who would willfully misunderstand her in the early years of her career. Unlike the rest of Tidal’s piano-forward tracks, “Sleep to Dream” builds from the beat up, a rumble anchoring Apple as she spits bars, her words so sharp and precise they could have been written with a scalpel. “I’ve got my own hell to raise,” is her proclamation in the chorus. Through formal innovations and radical forthrightness, she has spent the decades since fulfilling that prophecy. –Olivia Horn\n\nFurther Reading: Tidal Sunday Review\n\nListen: Fiona Apple, “Sleep to Dream”\n\n195.\n\nBjörk: “Venus as a Boy” (1993)\n\nNot to get all What Women Want about it, but it’s hardly surprising that the idealized male figure Björk rhapsodizes about in “Venus as a Boy” is described in terms of how he makes the narrator feel, and not what he looks like. This is beauty, according to Björk: attentiveness, the capability of making one’s partner feel beautiful, and an apparent willingness to go down on her. She’s not excited by his biceps or the bulge in his pants, but his sense of humor. Sonically, this Nelle Hooper-assisted single from Debut is something like a chanson in the Earth section of Epcot on Mars. Strings recorded at film studios in India do a ton of heavy lifting; every figure sounds like a different variation on swooning. At once intelligible and singular, “Venus” encapsulated Björk’s particular pop genius so preciously. –Rich Juzwiak\n\nListen: Björk, “Venus as a Boy”\n\n194.\n\nThe Sundays: “Here’s Where the Story Ends” (1990)\n\nReleased right at the start of the 1990s, the Sundays’ second single had more than one leg stuck in the 1980s, its gentle jangle pop and bookish miserabilism inevitably recalling fellow Rough Trade signees the Smiths. At the same time, “Here’s Where the Story Ends” has such a titanically strong pop melody—conveying a bittersweet tale of nostalgic longing that has withstood covers by artists as diverse as sugary house merchants Tin Tin Out and American Idol runner-up Crystal Bowersox—that it feels untethered to anything as prosaic as the calendar year. “Here’s Where the Story Ends” is an irresistible ode to moping around in your bedroom, borne aloft and into the stars on David Gavurin’s silk-slipper acoustic-guitar textures and Harriet Wheeler’s crystalline delivery. It influenced the gentler side of Britpop and it will resonate for as long as young people feel sorry for themselves—which is to say, probably forever. –Ben Cardew\n\nListen: The Sundays, “Here’s Where the Story Ends”\n\n193.\n\nAimee Mann: “Save Me” (1999)\n\nAimee Mann spent the ’90s sparring with a music industry that had desperately tried to control her. After leaving the ’80s synth rock group ’Til Tuesday, Mann went through a tumultuous run of contractual battles and label restructurings that left her both adrift and hardened. With “Save Me,” she found a way out. The melancholy song was written for Mann’s third solo LP—and first on her own label, SuperEgo—which shares DNA with the director Paul Thomas Anderson’s Oscar-nominated 1999 film Magnolia. Anderson wrote his screenplay using Mann’s cutting lyrics as dialogue, working together with the singer-songwriter to give flesh and blood to intricate stories about “the ranks of the freaks who suspect they could never love anyone,” as she puts it in the song. Subtly informed by a long period of disappointment, “Save Me” is wry but surefooted, with its loping guitar melodies, shuddering accordion, and gentle percussion. The featherlight production and songwriting belie its inevitable punch: Here, Mann underscores the raw tenderness that comes with searching for help. –Eric Torres\n\nListen: Aimee Mann, “Save Me”\n\n192.\n\nTony! Toni! Toné!: “Feels Good” (1990)\n\n“Play this record as frequently as possible. Then, as it becomes easier for you, play the record once a day or as needed.” The old-timey voiceover that introduced the Oakland trio’s first big song set a high bar that this tune would be the cure for what ailed listeners, but that first drum hits like a full syringe of serotonin. With all the sweet harmonies and big beats that defined new jack swing, “Feels Good” stands out as a titan of the genre, a full-bodied five-minute mission to live up to its name, and a catalyst for the prolific career of artist-producer Raphael Saadiq. One of the thousands of songs to sample Lyn Collins’ 1972 James Brown-produced “Think (About It),” “Feels Good” drew heavily from older funk, soul, gospel, and jazz, while also embracing the hard-hitting sound of the era. It was part love song to a girl, part love song to music in general, and all party. –Evie Nagy\n\nListen: Tony! Toni! Toné!, “Feels Good”\n\n191.\n\nMy Bloody Valentine: “When You Sleep” (1991)\n\n“When You Sleep” is a firework of emotion gone awry, a love song that leaves you so helplessly and hazily entranced. On their shoegaze-pioneering album Loveless, My Bloody Valentine were intent on making their instruments sound just as destructive as these emotions, and “When You Sleep” is filled with indelible blown-out noise, shattered guitar feedback, and muddled confessions narrowly escaping the surface: “When I look at you/Oh, I don’t know what’s real,” Shields sang, barely perceptible. Was this reality, or was it a dream? Either way, there was no exit. –Gio Santiago\n\nListen: My Bloody Valentine, “When You Sleep”\n\n190.\n\nGang Starr: “Mass Appeal” (1993)\n\n“It was recorded as a joke,” Gang Starr’s DJ Premier once said of “Mass Appeal.” “We just wanted to make fun of the radio on what it sounded like to get airplay.” The infamous song is smooth like some chinchilla coat worn by a gangster’s daughter—but nowhere near as soft. Guru’s voice, scholarly and crystalline, is compact over Preemo’s precise beat. Even though Gang Starr were non-violent, they weren’t only for the backpackers, either. And while Guru wasn’t a hustler rapper, he was still hardcore, his flow too confident for any posturing or ornamentation. They spoke to so many of rap’s constituencies at once. Preemo might have created this song as a gag, but it stands firm as both criticism and corrective. –Jayson Buford\n\nListen: Gang Starr, “Mass Appeal”\n\n189.\n\nGroove Theory: “Tell Me” (1995)\n\nGroove Theory only had one album and one hit, but they made it count. “Tell Me” was a simple, sensual admission of affection by singer-songwriter Amel Larrieux that captured all of the genuine nerves and excitement accompanying bubbling romance, set over a heartsick and woozy groove. “If you thought I’d sleep on this/Boy, you're wrong ’cause all I dream about is our first kiss,” she sings, her voice both a sultry come-on and a raw confessional. All of this, combined with the unforgettable melody and producer Bryce Wilson’s bulletproof bassline, made “Tell Me” a near-perfect representative of the best that R&B could be. –Evie Nagy\n\nListen: Groove Theory, “Tell Me”\n\n188.\n\nCocteau Twins: “Cherry-Coloured Funk” (1990)\n\nCocteau Twins entered the ’90s with birth (Elizabeth Fraser and Robin Guthrie’s daughter), death (Simon Raymonde’s father), agony (Guthrie’s substance abuse), and success (their highest charting U.S. single, “Carolyn’s Fingers”). This complex concoction seems fit for a band that melded hope with heartbreak, embodying indescribable emotions through ethereal instrumentals and cryptic lyrics. “Cherry-Coloured Funk,” the opening track to their 1990 tour de force Heaven or Las Vegas, drips with thick, sticky desire. Over lush guitar and churning bass, Fraser begins in an almost sinister low register, painting an abstract bucolic scene, then climbs to an anguished falsetto cry. As a feeling, “Cherry-Coloured Funk” is familiar yet ineffable, and thankfully expressed by a band who understood the inexpressible. –Arjun Srivatsa\n\nListen: Cocteau Twins, “Cherry-Coloured Funk”\n\n187.\n\nDouble 99: “Ripgroove” (1997)\n\nMovie directors aiming to create suspense or tension have been known to deploy what’s called the Shepard tone, an arrangement that gives the illusion of a continuously rising siren sound. In 1997, UK garage producers were using a similar effect to signal the arrival of something much more thrilling: A big, bulbous bassline to put the wind up your Moschino shirt. In the hands of Double 99, that suspense comes from a wailing, rotating Tina Moore vocal chop that rides atop a trundle of plump kicks before eventually—it’s a long build even by speed-garage standards—a delayed, distorted “brock wild!” summons a walloping bassline that’s become instantly recognizable to ravers of all stripes over the subsequent decades. Just like that Shepard tone, it’s still going. –Will Pritchard\n\nListen: Double 99, “Ripgroove”\n\n186.\n\nGhostface Killah: “Daytona 500” [ft. Raekwon, Cappadonna, and Force M.D.s] (1996)\n\nBeholding the power of Wu-Tang at their peak was like stumbling onto the world’s most esoteric track meet—cryptic smartasses bombing hammers and javelins all over the field, with points awarded according to the precepts of Supreme Mathematics. “Daytona 500” fulfills the title’s promise of speed: Over a rubbery strut sampled from Bob James’ jazz workhorse “Nautilus,” Raekwon’s leadoff leg effortlessly piles up internal rhymes and mordant asides. Ghost follows with his particular blend of artisanal flexes (“In the Philippines, pick herbal beans”) and invincibility (“I slapbox with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph”). They build a big enough lead for Cappa to break the tape, beer sloshing out of his cup. –Brad Shoup\n\nListen: Ghostface Killah, “Daytona 500” [ft. Raekwon, Cappadonna, and Force M.D.s]\n\n185.\n\nSWV: “Right Here (Human Nature Remix)” (1992)\n\nIn the comments section for a four-minute YouTube clip from 1993’s Free Willy, hundreds have communed to honor a cinematic moment from childhood that gave them “chills.” As Willy’s fins cut through the water, the sound of Michael Jackson’s reinterpolated “Human Nature” shimmers like the sun-jeweled waves, and the sound of SWV’s voices gently rain down like drops of holy water. Chills. Sitting somewhere snug between the ecstatic and absolute serene, SWV’s “Right Here (Human Nature Remix)” belongs as much in the church as it does the Free Willy soundtrack. With its gospel-infused harmonies, Teddy Riley’s remix combines the classic romanticism and cool insouciance of the original with updated, widescreen hip-hop production (including a cameo from his protégé, Pharrell). –Emma Madden\n\nListen: SWV, “Right Here (Human Nature Remix)”\n\n184.\n\nWilco: “Via Chicago” (1999)\n\nIn 1999, Wilco were set on blowing up their alt-country identity and stepping further into their truth as aesthetes. On Summerteeth, the band embraced the psychedelia of Beach Boys baroque pop, weaving in ever more textural experimentation. “Via Chicago” is the most stunning signal of what was to come on their 2001 opus, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot: the song deconstructs, as if slowly collapsing on the road back to their city and their people. “I’m coming home/Via Chicago,” Jeff Tweedy sings, gently and wearied, broken yet whole, proof that place is only the first stop en route to the complicated comforts of home. –Jenn Pelly\n\nFurther Reading: Summerteeth Reissue Review\n\nListen: Wilco, “Via Chicago”\n\n183.\n\nYo-Yo: “You Can't Play With My Yo-Yo” [ft. Ice Cube] (1991)\n\nYo-Yo made her recording debut in 1990, matching Ice Cube bar for bar on “It’s a Man’s World”—but her second solo single, in 1991, was stratospheric, an infectious declaration laying out Yo-Yo’s plan for woman-domination in the entrenched male landscape of West Coast gangsta rap. Over Cube’s lowrider-slow sample of Earth, Wind & Fire’s “Devotion” and a refrain that cast a mournful pallor over its demands (“don’t try to play me out”), the Compton-born Yo-Yo flowed majestically about her skills, intellect, style, values, and street bona fides, all while laying out a credo for herself and her crew, the Intelligent Black Woman’s Coalition (IBWC). The blessing of Cube lent Yo-Yo some legitimacy in those sexist circles and helped her land a record deal by the time she was 18, but her flow spoke for itself, a protegee turned spiritual predecessor to current rappers as wide-ranging as Saweetie to City Girls to Omeretta the Great. –Julianne Escobedo Shepherd\n\nListen: Yo-Yo, “You Can't Play With My Yo-Yo” [ft. Ice Cube]\n\n182.\n\nSpice Girls: “Wannabe” (1996)\n\nWomen. Ever heard of them? For much of the nineties the British cultural landscape had been suffused with the banality of blokiness, to the point where femininity felt like radical counter-programming. The Spice Girls were cartoonish splinters of British girlhood, each of them campishly endowed with femdom archetypes: Scary, Baby, Posh, Sporty, and… Ginger. “Wannabe,” their debut single, was a boisterous, friendship-forward anthem centering the most hoydenish parts of their personalities. The five women delivered sass and brattiness with the giddy mania of a toy commercial—Friendship! Fun! Zig-ah-zig-ah! The track itself is indulgently weird, frantically jittering from one idea to the next without any thought or collecting breath. It sounds like pop music held at gunpoint, but this energy reinscribed a much-needed sense of humor and unseriousness into the genre. –Emma Madden\n\nListen: Spice Girls, “Wannabe”\n\n181.\n\nDr. Octagon: “Blue Flowers” (1996)\n\nKool Keith has had plenty of receptive collaborators both before and after his initial turn as the time-traveling alien OB/GYN Dr. Octagon, but none understood or complemented him as well as Dan the Automator. On 1996’s Dr. Octagonecologyst, the producer keeps Keith from flying too far into the atmosphere with rocksteady boom-bap, while tickling the rapper’s one-of-a-kind brain with wiggly synth drones, and samples from porn flicks and the cult ’90s comedy Cabin Boy. One clear highlight is “Blue Flowers,” which features a horror-soundtrack-level flip of Bartók’s Violin Concerto No. 2 alongside a jazzy backbeat. It’s unsettling on its own, but Keith cranks up the disquiet with verses that are blood-soaked, heatsick, and wickedly funny. –Robert Ham\n\nListen: Dr. Octagon, “Blue Flowers”\n\n180.\n\nUsher: “You Make Me Wanna…” (1997)\n\nMy Way was a path-changing album in Usher’s discography, and on a record where every song had the potential to break out, “You Make Me Wanna…” had to be particularly spectacular to slightly edge out the others. A sublime mix of hip-hop cool and R&B seduction in the vein of Usher’s idol, Bobby Brown, the song is sexy without being lascivious, playful without any childish inclinations, and just a little unbelievable. It’s common to mourn the “death” of smooth, danceable and carefully produced R&B—an apparent bygone of a lost era—yet Usher’s artistry has revealed itself to be committed to his roots, with a deep awareness of the foundational pillars lent to the genre by gospel and soul. As the years have passed, he’s shifted and experimented, all the while pledging allegiance to the melodies that raised and introduced him. –Tarisai Ngangura\n\nListen: Usher, “You Make Me Wanna…”\n\n179.\n\nMetallica: “Enter Sandman” (1991)\n\nIn which prototypical ’80s speed metal headbangers trade in thrash velocity and prog drama for a more straightforward and compact grunge-adjacent churn, in service of a spooky-ooky bedtime story named for a 19th Century continental European shuteye myth you can trace through ’50s girl-group dreamers the Chordettes, dirging ’70s soft-rockers America, a ’30s DC Comic-turned-’80s Neil Gaiman graphic novel, and maybe, just maybe, months after the Gulf War, Saddam Hussein. Add references to the turn-of-18th-Century Protestant children’s prayer “Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep,” the Southern folk lullaby “Hush Little Baby,” and Peter Pan’s (if not Michael Jackson’s) Neverland, warn of “the beast under your bed, in your closet, in your head” (for the tween boy in the video, impending puberty maybe?), and you’ve got a sellout that goes bump in the night. Exit light, enter nye-yite, welcome to Metallica’s nightmare. –Chuck Eddy\n\nFurther Reading: Metallica Sunday Review\n\nListen: Metallica, “Enter Sandman”\n\n178.\n\nRaekwon: “Ice Cream” [ft. Method Man, Ghostface Killah, and Cappadonna] (1995)\n\n“Ice Cream” sounds just as roughneck as the grimiest Wu bangers, so it’s a little funny that Raekwon hated the song at first because he thought it was “too soft.” RZA turns jazz guitarist Earl Klugh’s plucky riff into a blood-curdling loop that cradles the Chef, Ghostface, and Cappadonna’s confidence-oozing player raps. The three of them sound like guys fighting to get the attention of a beautiful woman who just passed by their block, verbally shoving each other out the way to shout the wildest compliments imaginable. Not all of their hollering has aged well—especially parts of Raekwon’s verse—but it’s still a quintessential New York rap love story: a little too upfront, yet romantic in its own crude way. –Brandon Callender\n\nListen: Raekwon, “Ice Cream” [ft. Method Man, Ghostface Killah, and Cappadonna]\n\n177.\n\nGarth Brooks: “Friends in Low Places” (1990)\n\nOne of the best-selling artist of the ’90s, Garth Brooks was primarily influenced by Texas country acts like George Strait, and he wore a Stetson to prove it. “Friends in Low Places,” the ultimate hat act single, starts off as a nearly a cappella story-song about storming an ex’s high-falutin’ shindig, and Brooks attacks that chorus in a way that justifies every Elvis comparison. The song inevitably climaxes as a barroom sing-along that’s musical and spiritual kin to Lone Star anthems like Tanya Tucker’s “Texas (When I Die).” It’s also Garth’s pledge as a country singer—especially one hailed as the genre’s conquering hero—to bring some low-class kicks to the high-class sales charts and record books. –Stephen Deusner\n\nListen: Garth Brooks, “Friends in Low Places”\n\n176.\n\nThe Prodigy: “Firestarter” (1997)\n\nRave as metal—or oi!, maybe—with indie rock wah-wah borrowed from the Breeders, deep house bam-bam from Ten City, proto-techno “hey hey!” from Art of Noise, and a pyromania-horror concept from Stephen King. Keith Flint, him of the Bozo the Clown hair-tufts, slings Cockney rhyming slang about what a bloomin’ rebel he is— or, per his chants, what a trouble starter, punkin’ instigator, mind detonator, twisted animator he is. That last one was particularly apt since these blokes were nothing if not cartoons—but cartoons with the big beat, sillier and catchier and buzzier than just about anything else on the radio at the time. All told, a master class in how to sell electronic dance music as what looks and feels like a “rock band.” –Chuck Eddy\n\nListen: The Prodigy, “Firestarter”\n\n175.\n\nGalaxie 500: “Fourth of July” (1990)\n\nDo you know just how low it feels to think the whole world is enjoying a party and you’re the only one not invited? Or to believe that most every possible comfort—the playfulness of a pet, the ecstasy of a holiday, the warmth of a smile, the silence of your space—is unavailable, denied for some reason you can’t comprehend? That is the listless sadness at the core of “Fourth of July,” a song about wanting to be loved by a crowd too busy to bother. Dean Wareham shuffles around New York, unimpressed by its Empire State Building’s stature and uninterested in its Independence Day clamor. Naomi Yang and Damon Krukowski perfectly illustrate his anxious pacing, their circular rhythm moving like someone who wants to go anywhere but has nowhere willing to take him. What to do when the world shuts you out? Shut yourself in and take a glorious guitar solo that forever wanders, just like you. –Grayson Haver Currin\n\nListen: Galaxie 500, “Fourth of July”\n\n174.\n\nNoreaga: “Superthug” (1998)\n\n“Superthug,” the breakout hit from goofily intense rapper Noreaga (aka N.O.R.E.), not only launched a new era of Queens rap, pushing aside the cool and collected storm clouds of Nas and Mobb Deep with one fell swoop of its indelible “what-what-what-what-what-what-what” hook. It also heralded the arrival of producers Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, aka the Neptunes, onto the international stage. Their signature stuttering drums and sci-fi synths sounded unlike anything playing on Hot 97 at the time, foretelling the innovative path Williams and Hugo would chart for decades to come. –Claire Lobenfeld\n\nListen: Noreaga, “Superthug”\n\n173.\n\nElliott Smith: “Waltz #2 (XO)” (1998)\n\nIn the long history of songs about other songs, “Waltz #2 (XO)” ranks as one of the best. Inside a smoky karaoke bar, a man and a woman—two people who may very well be stand-ins for Elliott Smith’s mother, Bunny, and his stepfather, Charlie—select songs that thinly veil their marital strife. She blankly performs the humiliating “Cathy’s Clown,” he sings the pointed “You’re No Good.” Smith uses karaoke night, or as he calls it, “the substitute scene,” to give us this meta novella about pop music and heartbreak. He becomes an audience member inside his own composition, distant and helpless to do anything but silently show his love for his distraught mom, signed with a kiss and a hug. –Jeremy D. Larson\n\nListen: Elliott Smith, “Waltz #2 (XO)”\n\n172.\n\nEn Vogue: “My Lovin’ (You’re Never Gonna Get It)” (1992)\n\nLord help the man at the business end of an “Oooooooooooo BOP.” With its searing James Brown sample, stunning vocals, and biting parenthetical title, “My Lovin’” was En Vogue’s 1992 entry into the proud tradition of soul anthems by pissed-off women who were absolutely done being used and disrespected. But the four-member girl group from Oakland added the all-important squad element, and this dirtbag trying to sweet talk his lady back after treating her like crap never stood a chance. What makes you think you can just walk back into her life, indeed. –Evie Nagy\n\nListen: En Vogue, “My Lovin’ (You’re Never Gonna Get It)”\n\n171.\n\nSlowdive: “Alison” (1993)\n\nShoegaze is about capturing the shimmering melancholia at the edge of existence, that too-stoned sense of being unmoored in the world. “Alison,” from one of the best shoegaze acts to ever do it, taps into that sinking feeling of lying in bed, wishing you could stay there forever but knowing you eventually have to face the universe. The song has a shaggy, nostalgic comfort, its warmth shining through like a lazy sunbeam on your face. But it’s also tinged with unbearable loss, as the protagonist addresses a flawed person whose existence animates their being. “I’ll be here in the morning,” Neil Halstead sings, even as he’s the one who needs reassuring. –Cat Zhang\n\nFurther Watching: Souvlaki Pitchfork Classic Documentary\n\nListen: Slowdive, “Alison”\n\n170.\n\nPuff Daddy: “All About the Benjamins” [ft. the Notorious B.I.G., Lil’ Kim, Jadakiss, and The Lox] (1997)\n\nYou can practically feel the breeze of a whirring cash machine in your face. Produced by Deric “D-Dot” Angelettie of Bad Boy Records’ Hitmen production squad, this instrumental floats like a swarm of wasps, held aloft by a slowed and reversed sample of the opening guitar lick from R&B trio Love Unlimited’s 1977 single “I Did It for Love.” There’s enough room in the pocket of this beat to fit a giraffe riding a 747—or a rap crew at the peak of their powers.\n\nNearly every line is now a certified classic, etched into NYC brownstone, from Puffy’s immortal, Jadakiss-penned opening spray—“Now what y’all wanna do?!/Wanna be ballers, shot callers, brawlers?”—to Sheek Louch’s quest for “colossal-sized Picassos” to Lil’ Kim throwing hexes and Angela Landsbury references at rivals real and imagined. (Legend has it the Lox’s third member, Styles P, was cut from the track by a pre-fame Missy Elliott, who helped with the arrangement.) The production switches to a Jackson 5 flip for Biggie’s anchor verse, suggesting a separate plane of existence: Upon its release months after the rapper’s 1997 murder, this definitive version of “It’s All About the Benjamins” doubled as a statement of defiance and a raucous respite from tragedy. –Ryan Dombal\n\nListen: Puff Daddy, “All About the Benjamins”\n\n169.\n\nAce of Base: “The Sign” (1993)\n\n“The Sign” is the kind of uncomplicated, unserious pop song that’s easy to love: there are those diet-reggae guitar licks, that pulsing drum-machine beat, and vague, chirpy lyrics that you can memorize almost instantly, even though you don’t actually know what the song is about. (Technically, it chronicles a couple discovering a renewed sense of purpose in their relationship, but that’s beside the point). When it was released in 1993 on the Swedish quartet’s debut album, it exploded internationally; even member Ulf Ekberg’s past in a skinhead gang didn’t stop the band’s ascent, though it definitely demanded some damage control. “The Sign” was a product of the Swedish pop machine, a system that produced a certain kind of flawlessly constructed, ultra-polished pop commodity. Exemplified by groups like ABBA in the ’70s, “The Sign” heralded its return two decades later, restoring a formula that would dominate the pop charts in the years to come. –Isabelia Herrera\n\nListen: Ace of Base, “The Sign”\n\n168.\n\nBeenie Man: “Who Am I” (1998)\n\nBeenie Man understands the power of an eternal groove. The Playground riddim produced by veteran producer Jeremy Harding caught the Jamaican dancehall DJ’s ear, and he reportedly showed up at Harding’s studio with the song that would become “Who Am I” already in mind. “Who Am I” pulses like any good dancehall song, but at its heart is a man shook up about being left by his favorite lover, now forced to confront his own conniving ways with the help of love, shame, and some Luther Vandross interpolations. The track is foundational for modern dancehall and has been interpolated, sampled, and referenced countless times, but few follow-ups have captured the original’s intoxicating mix of love and lust. –Dylan Green\n\nListen: Beenie Man, “Who Am I”\n\n167.\n\nOasis: “Don’t Look Back in Anger” (1995)\n\nBritpop had plenty to answer for (see, especially, Menswe@r). But at its best it worked as a collective celebration of the humane things about the late 20th century: classic pop, social democracy, the fleeting empowerment of working-class culture. Released at the height of Oasis’ Augustan phase, “Don’t Look Back in Anger” epitomized Britpop’s historic sense in both form and context. Musically, away from the nonsense lyrics, it evoked the communitarian early ’70s, with an “Imagine” steal, Harrison-esque guitar licks, and ‘“All the Young Dudes” allusions. More broadly, as it attained Great Singalong status in the late ’90s, the eulogistic anthem came to embody a brief moment when exalting the better side of the past and looking forward to a brighter future seemed to work in harmony. In a decade when surface was depth, no song managed to mean so little and yet so much at the same time. –Alex Niven\n\nListen: Oasis, “Don’t Look Back in Anger”\n\n166.\n\nDe La Soul: “Stakes Is High” (1996)\n\nThree quarters of the way into “Swahililand,” a 10-minute jazz odyssey by the great pianist Ahmad Jamal, you can hear J Dilla’s ears perk up in his record-filled Detroit basement. He recognized a perfect sample, an urgent and dramatic chord progression that became the looping heart of De La Soul’s “Stakes Is High.” The trio’s message on the song was bold—they’d grown sick of the fake shit, the gaudy capitalist-fantasy videos, and the rappers play-acting as drug lords without saying anything substantial about the crack epidemic. “Stakes Is High” was a line in the sand backed by one of Dilla’s most iconic beats—a template for a different way ahead from the stuff getting airtime on MTV. –Evan Minsker\n\nListen: De La Soul, “Stakes Is High”\n\n165.\n\nGalaxy 2 Galaxy: “Jupiter Jazz” (1993)\n\n“Jupiter Jazz” sounds like one of those airbrushed sci-fi book covers of the late ’70s and early ’80s looks: galaxian synth melodies and whirring, bubbling space noises floating over beats that echo the rhythmic complexity of jazz as played by drum machines. Underground Resistance’s “Mad” Mike Banks may be better known for uncompromising techno and militant aesthetics, but this record is fun and hopeful, as playful rave stabs and dreamy Motor City pads give way to an elegant mission statement about techno as “hi-tech jazz.” Back in 1992, UR’s live band didn’t physically exist yet, but you can see the idea taking shape over EPs like Nation 2 Nation, World 2 World (the EP that contains this track), and 1993’s Galaxy 2 Galaxy. Like all good space explorations, Banks’ endeavor has taken time and patience, but the Galaxy 2 Galaxy live ensemble fulfills the promise of “Jupiter Jazz,” bringing together several generations of Detroit Afrofuturists—from sax players to synth wizards—to play timeless, tireless grooves. –Vivian Host\n\nListen: Galaxy 2 Galaxy, “Jupiter Jazz”\n\n164.\n\nSmashing Pumpkins: “Mayonaise” (1993)\n\nDuring the recording of Smashing Pumpkins’ Siamese Dream, frontman Billy Corgan demanded absolute perfection from those around him. In liner notes for the album’s reissue, he referenced recording “thousands” of drum takes to tape that had been spliced so much it was disintegrating. It was this relentless drive, in part, that made him stand out from his peers, who were wading through swampy distortion with snarling disaffection. For Corgan, caring was cool—and “Mayonaise,” a lonely meditation on the beauty of owning your shortcomings, was something of a mission statement. Amid a record of songs about abuse, suicide, and bearing the weight of the world, it’s a lushly arranged moment of peace, reframing Corgan’s relentless perfectionism as a kind of perseverance. –Colin Joyce\n\nFurther Reading: Siamese Dream Reissue Review\n\nListen: Smashing Pumpkins, “Mayonaise”\n\n163.\n\nBig Pun: “Still Not a Player” (1998)\n\nBig Pun’s trademark ode to the players and pimps continues to ring out in the streets of the South Bronx. Pun was the precursor to the Bad Bunnys and Cardi Bs of the current scene, a hip-hop trailblazer for Latinos all over the map. He created a sound and dialect that was unmatched at the time, rapping in Spanish one moment and then in English the next, dense sheets of compound rhymes pouring out of him, the wordplay at once rapidfire and unhurried. “Still Not a Player” remains a staple of Puerto Rican Day parades; it’s what every papi hears before heading over to the block to hang. Especially in Pun’s native borough, it still sounds like home. –Jayson Buford\n\nListen: Big Pun, “Still Not a Player”\n\n162.\n\nR.E.M.: “Losing My Religion” (1991)\n\n“Losing My Religion” is the ultimate back-door hit—so unorthodox in its composition yet so representative of its creators’ strengths. Grown entirely from a single riff on the mandolin, an instrument that was completely new to guitarist Peter Buck at the time, the song captures R.E.M. at their most synergistic, resolute, and vulnerable. Michael Stipe sings like he’s afraid of his own shadow, and he’s stalked and swarmed by Buck, bassist Mike Mills, and drummer Bill Berry as he winces his way through a string of wounded confessions that are both specific-seeming and interpretable, whether through a lens of religion (it wasn’t intended that way), unrequited love (Stipe has cited “Every Breath You Take” as a major inspiration), or the view from the corner or the spotlight. –Steven Arroyo\n\nListen: R.E.M., “Losing My Religion”\n\n161.\n\nKelis: “Caught Out There” (1999)\n\nKelis has said that “Caught Out There,” her debut single, recorded when she was just 20 years old, “set the tone for my entire life.” It was an early and formative Neptunes production, with bouncy keyboards and a pew-pew sound effect that can only be compared to laser guns, but their collaboration eventually soured. It was ahead of its time, which meant the timing was off, which makes it a “cult favorite”—a euphemism for “not as popular as it should have been” and a way of signaling taste and discernment that would, rather unfairly, dog Kelis for much of her career. But it was also an anthem for women’s aggrievement, the song that made her, with its ferocious, shouting hook, “the first girl to scream on a track,” as she would later remind us. For all she’s been through over the years, it makes sense that Kelis came out kicking. –Emma Carmichael\n\nListen: Kelis, “Caught Out There”\n\n160.\n\nYo La Tengo: “Autumn Sweater” (1997)\n\nNothing the local coffee shop cues on chilly days can compare to “Autumn Sweater,” a downy song about our sentimental attachment to mementos, but more acutely, about wanting to disappear with the person you love. Is the charm in lead singer Ira Kaplan’s shy, sweet delivery, murmuring his proposal as if his hands are tucked nervously into his pockets, or in the unassuming but lively instrumentation—the rattle of the shakers, the bright tones of the organ, the syncopated groove of the congos? Few songs stake the same claim on a season, the nervousness and possibility stirred up when the air picks up a draft. –Cat Zhang\n\nListen: Yo La Tengo, “Autumn Sweater”\n\n159.\n\nPublic Enemy: “Welcome to the Terrordome” (1990)\n\nPublic Enemy’s 1990 single “Welcome to the Terrordome” has complicated roots. On the one hand, it’s a musical Molotov lobbed at the powers of white supremacy much like “Fight the Power,” which soundtracked Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing the year before. But it’s also a response to the controversy stirred up by Professor Griff, Public Enemy’s onetime Minister of Information, whose inflammatory anti-Semitic comments brought down a shitstorm of opprobrium on the group, eventually resulting in Griff’s dismissal. Chuck D references the flap in a few lines, and not, admittedly, to his benefit (“Crucifixion ain’t no fiction/So-called chosen frozen”; “Told a Rab to get off the rag”). But the force of his defiance, as he details the indignities visited upon Black Americans, paired with the claustrophobic apocalyptic feel of Hank Shocklee’s production, is nonetheless thrilling, in a real pit-in-your-stomach way. –Philip Sherburne\n\nListen: Public Enemy, “Welcome to the Terrordome”\n\n158.\n\nNo Doubt: “Just a Girl” (1995)\n\nSka-pop band No Doubt’s 1995 hit “Just a Girl” was a sassy indictment of institutional sexism subtle enough to skank its way onto the charts. Atop a squiggly riff, Gwen Stefani outlines an experience of girlhood inhibited by the patriarchy: “I’m just a girl, all pretty and petite/So don’t let me have any rights,” she sneers. “Just a Girl”’s feminism is cleverly transgressive: beyond her sarcastic delivery, Stefani’s vocals jump from babydoll soft to full-chested belting, playing with the stereotypes of the fragile waif and the angry woman. These identities combine in the song’s final moments. “Oh, I’ve had it up to here,” Stefani belts, her frustration unignorable. But then she lets the final word wilt like a flower. Is she surrendering or wantonly using the infantilization she just spent a whole song decrying as a mechanism of power? Girlhood has always been more complex than it seems. –Quinn Moreland\n\nFurther Reading: Tragic Kingdom Sunday Review\n\nListen: No Doubt, “Just a Girl”\n\n157.\n\nThe Cure: “Friday I’m in Love” (1992)\n\n“Friday I’m in Love” is a happy song. Right? The ebullient jangle of the guitars; that melody, so easy and intuitive and right that Robert Smith was convinced for a while that he’d stolen it from somewhere else; and the titular line, yelped with the enthusiasm of a puppy waiting for a treat. Who could be sad on Friday? Not even Smith. But it only comes once a week, and you already know what the other days are like. Monday: Black. Tuesday, Wednesday: Heart attack. And on it goes until Friday lights us up again, however briefly. The Cure’s final hit is an ode to the ecstasy that finds us only occasionally, taking its unsteady foothold before drudgery washes it away again. Still, those guitars and that melody make clear that it really is a happy song. Smith and the band recognize that joy’s rarity makes it all the more precious, and that finding it for even one day per week is a cause for celebration. Here’s to feeling good roughly 14 percent of the time. –Andy Cush\n\nFurther Reading: Wish Sunday Review\n\nListen: The Cure, “Friday I’m in Love”\n\n156.\n\nDe La Soul: “A Rollerskating Jam Named ‘Saturdays’” (1991)\n\nDe La Soul Is Dead found the group reckoning with their Day-Glo debut, 3 Feet High and Rising, spiking their rap hippie rep with darker humor and edgier storytelling. But they didn’t spend the entire album clearing the air. “A Roller Skating Jam Named ‘Saturdays’” radiates relief, with De La roping in fellow Native Tongues members Q-Tip and Vinia Mojica for a breezy ode to the best day of the week. The verses, the chorus, and even the record scratches glide over Prince Paul’s silky beat, which blends disco, funk, and the Grease theme into a springy delight. Like a Saturday, it is contained but boundless, a Cinderella slipper for the whole squad. –Stephen Kearse\n\nListen: De La Soul, “A Rollerskating Jam Named ‘Saturdays’”\n\n155.\n\nThe Verve: “Bitter Sweet Symphony” (1997)\n\nUntil the matter was settled in 2019, the Verve’s “Bitter Sweet Symphony” was less a pop song than a rollicking, anthemic full-employment act for intellectual property lawyers. The fight centered around the hook’s sample of four bars of Andrew Loog Oldham’s orchestral version of the Rolling Stones’ “The Last Time,” which was itself borrowing from an old gospel song. The Verve was cut out of a fortune’s worth of royalties, the Stones got fractionally richer, and the whole mess overshadowed what was maybe the best song of the Britpop moment. Just luxuriate in the Spectory thickness of the production—“a prairie-music kind of sound,” in the evocative phrase of the Verve’s Richard Ashcroft, who cited the Temptations and Ennio Morricone as models. It is an epic, the best sort of grandiose, the music soaring where the words want to mope. Maybe all the legal shitfighting wound up saying the thing the lyrics couldn't quite articulate. What better summation of the present era, after all, than the meta-story of “Bitter Sweet Symphony”—some asset-holding boomers got wealthier without leaving the couch and everyone else was stuck holding the bag. –Tommy Craggs\n\nListen: The Verve, “Bitter Sweet Symphony”\n\n154.\n\nUGK: “One Day” (1996)\n\n“Why you let these killas live and take my homeboy son away?” Pimp C asks on UGK’s most significant album, 1996’s Ridin’ Dirty. The moment is a call to God for answers, none of which the man born Chad Butler would ever get. UGK found the darkest piece of the blues over a flip of The Isley Brothers’ “Ain’t I Been Good to You” while charting through nihilism, the loss of friendship, and the finality of death. “One Day” is a solemn funeral procession, where Bun B, Pimp C, and featured rapper Mr. 3-2 understand that being Black can mean your final days come over a “funky-ass dice game,” on the uneven scales of the criminal justice system, or even worse—by an unimaginable act of God. –Brandon Caldwell\n\nFurther Reading: Ridin’ Dirty Sunday Review\n\nListen: UGK, “One Day”\n\n153.\n\nEn Vogue: “Free Your Mind” (1992)\n\nAppearing on a genre-fluid album laced with doo-wop-like jams like “My Lovin’ (You’re Never Gonna Get It)” and sensual classics like “Giving Him Something He Can Feel,” En Vogue’s “Free Your Mind” took us to rock as thrashing metal guitar riffs layered with keyboards, the group’s signature harmony, and a message of gender and racial unity. “It doesn’t mean that I’m a prostitute, no, no,” these curvaceous Black femmes in thigh-high boots wanted us to know—a radical message at a time when feminism was all but declared dead and a war on women was underway. Slut-shaming and moral judgment were the norm, not the exception, and “Free Your Mind” was an anthem to STFU and leave people be. –Samhita Mukhopadhyay\n\nListen: En Vogue, “Free Your Mind”\n\n152.\n\nSuperchunk: “Slack Motherfucker” (1990)\n\nThe only thing worse than a miserable low-paying job is having to compensate for the absolute dud working the same shift, and Superchunk bottled both dimensions of that rage perfectly in their joyously explosive breakout single. The layabout muse of “Slack Motherfucker” was a guy Mac McCaughan worked with at Kinko’s, but the specific dude matters not. He is an archetype that exists in every bad job—the person taking too many smoke breaks, who leans when he could clean, whose lack of work makes it so you have to stay late. When the band shouts the chorus and the final repeated strains of “you motherfucker,” that’s a universal release that anybody can scream along to. –Evan Minsker\n\nFurther Reading: Superchunk Reissue Review\n\nListen: Superchunk, “Slack Motherfucker”\n\n151.\n\nOrigin Unknown: “Valley of the Shadows” (1993)\n\nIf you were at a drum’n’bass rave at any point in the ’90s, chances are you know the feeling of being in “a long, dark tunnel,” a sensation forever trademarked by the sample in Andy C and Ant Miles’ iconic 1993 anthem “Valley of the Shadows.” The track contains little more than arpeggiated bells, a shuffling “Think” break, eerie pads, and a “31 seconds” soundbite from the Apollo 11 moon landing—mostly sounds from a free sample CD that came with a 1993 issue of Future Music magazine—yet it sums up the darkcore aesthetic of early jungle with chilling simplicity (and some seriously deadly sine-wave bass). Nearly 30 years on, Andy C is drum’n’bass’ top DJ, and RAM has over 440 releases to its name. In a genre that’s come to be associated with daredevil drops and over-the-top production trickery, you can still get a mighty rewind off this stone-cold classic. –Vivian Host\n\nListen: Origin Unknown, “Valley of the Shadows”\n\n150.\n\nThree 6 Mafia: “Tear Da Club Up” (1997)\n\nThree 6 Mafia’s first major-label contract required them to put “Tear Da Club Up” on their next record. In theory, not a huge ask—Chapter 2: World Domination ended up exhuming several hits from the Memphis crew’s previous albums, where Juicy J and DJ Paul continually scraped layers of lo-fi graveyard grime off their horrorcore production style. But they were tired of that particular song. So the ’97 version converts the original’s ambient dread into imminent dread, from the soap-opera piano ostinato to the four-note rising synth figure that chases each verse like Hell’s breaking-news theme. Recent addition Gangsta Boo pops up halfway through to bigfoot the track; it’s no wonder hers is the verse featured in the canny, nu-rock TV ad. Whether or not the song truly was “banned in 17 states,” as that commercial claims, crunk grew from its wreckage. –Brad Shoup\n\nListen: Three 6 Mafia, “Tear Da Club Up”\n\n149.\n\nElastica: “Connection” (1994)\n\nSwiping the electronic bop that fuels post-punk icons Wire’s “Three Girl Rhumba”—an homage that eventually resulted in a lawsuit that was settled out of court—Elastica crafted one of the marvels of the Britpop era: art-rock reconfigured as a carnal rallying cry. All leftward hooks and innuendo, “Connection” never hits its target squarely—frontwoman Justine Frischmann alludes to its oblique construction by ending her chorus by admitting that “somehow the vital connection is made”—but the single sounds simple, even primal, as Elastica bashes their dive-bomb riff with enthusiasm. As soon as the song takes shape, when the suggestions start seeming like overt flirtations, Elastica pulls the plug: The “Connection” is fleeting, no matter how indelible it may be. –Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nFurther Reading: Elastica Sunday Review\n\nListen: Elastica, “Connection”\n\n148.\n\nEminem: “My Name Is...” (1999)\n\nAs with Beck’s “Loser,” you would have been forgiven at the time for taking Marshall Mathers' chicka-chicka-chart debut for a novelty-joke one-shot—nothing indicated a major career on the way. Right off, Slim Shady's gleefully introduced as a class clown and horrible role model (“Hi kids, do you like violence?”— “Primus” in the edited version—“Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids?”). But he constantly sets up escape hatches, serving as peanut gallery (“Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away!”), and switching out of apparent autobiography only to catalog every satirical way he’ll wreak havoc on English teachers, autograph hounds, his own body (two fake suicides!), and his own Mom. “God sent me to piss the world off”—everybody has a purpose, right? –Chuck Eddy\n\nListen: Eminem, “My Name Is...”\n\n147.\n\nNeil Young: “Harvest Moon” (1992)\n\n“I’m still in love with you,” Neil Young sings during the chorus of his 1992 standard “Harvest Moon.” You could spend a lifetime in that “still.” The Canadian songwriter was in his mid-40s when he wrote it, and he seemed to use every minute of his time here to fuel its sense of romance and devotion. Backed by an autumnal lineup featuring Linda Ronstadt on vocal harmonies, Ben Keith on pedal steel, and Tim Drummond sweeping a broom for percussion, Young lets his guitar summon a vast distance—detuning the lowest string and letting it reverberate through the central riff, fingerpicking the harmonics high up the fretboard during the verses. The sound itself seems to conjure eternity, and the words do, too. Three decades into his career, Young had written plenty of songs about searching for a companion, about the heart-skipping joy of finding love and the ditched-out misery of losing it. Here was his simple, soulful prayer to making it last. –Sam Sodomsky\n\nListen: Neil Young, “Harvest Moon”\n\n146.\n\nJanet Jackson: “That’s the Way Love Goes” (1993)\n\nEphemeral, transcendent, sensual, gro"
