        "text": "Well folks, it’s almost here. That magical time of year. That day of days when kids in their pajamas wake up at the crack of dawn and scream with delight when they enter their living room and see a whole cornucopia of new toys and gifts underneath a glowing, shimmering Christmas tree. Soon their parents, still in the middle of a REM cycle will groggily come down stairs to see their kids tear into their yuletide bounty, a bounty that in many cases the parents risked life, limb and January’s car payment to get. In most cases they’ll smile and feel it was all worth it. In other cases they’ll probably resent the fact that a guy up in the North Pole is getting all the credit. Some will get a look at the object of their kids desire and wonder what all of the fuss was about while others try to choke down their aggravation when the kids lose interest in them right away.\n\nWhile the joy of making their children happy and the ability to guilt trip them into behaving by uttering those two foreboding words “Santa’s watching” is one of the great pleasures of parenting it’s hard to argue that the holidays do add an additional burden to already stressful job. We can rant and rave all we want to about the commercialization of a holiday that is supposed to be about the birthday of Jesus Christ (albeit an unsubstantiated one) but we all remember what it was like on Christmas morning when we found just what our little hearts desired in our living rooms come Christmas morning. Some also remember the disappointment when we didn’t get what we wanted despite being good all year long. If they’re lucky then their kids will request something that is relatively easy to find but sometimes the toy at the top of that Christmas list is something that millions of boys and/or girls want, that’s in short supply and obtaining the gift becomes a consumer culture equivalent of an Indiana Jones adventure.\n\nEach and every year, usually in November before Thanksgiving, some new plaything is dubbed the new “hot toy” of the holiday season. Nobody can foresee what this is going to be. The seeds of hype are often planted at the American International Toy Fair held in New York in February. If a toy makes a big splash you can bet that it’s gonna get a big push later that year. Sometimes though it’s the industry annalists that act as town crier in hopes that morning talk shows and magazines will take the bait and talk up the toys. Sometimes it might be a hit movie that came out over the summer or TV show that premiered in the fall that has captured the imagination of young ones and manufacturers trying to benefit from a lucrative tie-in. Ultimately though it’s the kids who decide what they want and parents would always be smart to listen to their kinder rather then industry insiders.\n\nRegardless, hyper hype is part of the Christmas season and in an industry that pretty much lives or dies by Christmas/Hanukah/Kwanza sales figures you can bet they’re going to try anything they can to move their product off of toy store shelves and into the homes of young tykes, return policies be damned.\n\nThe following article is about the toys that caused the most industry and national hype during the holiday season. The list is not based on actual sales figures but rather by how much attention the toy got. Some helped launch toy lines that remain popular to this day. Others quickly became passé and found themselves in garage sale come springtime. Some immediately send a wave of nostalgia over those who were lucky enough to have received the item one Christmas long ago and others make us cringe at the very thought that we ever asked for one of these things. Some made a fortune but some, despite all the hype, ended up being commercial failures due to inflated supply and deflated demand. It should be noted right away that this list is limited to toys, games, video games and novelties. While television sets, fondue sets, CD players and iPads have all been hugely popular Christmas gifts at one time or another they belong in another category. We’re sticking with toys here. We’re also sticking to toys that caused a stir during a particular holiday season. Therefore old favorites like Flexible Flyer sleds, Play Dough, Tonka Trucks and Legos won’t be here because while they’re always popular gift items they’ve never created a big Christmas craze. And while some of these toys hit it big in the year they were released, others took a year or two before they really entered the public’s consciousness. Finally you will sometimes see more then one toy representing a given year. Remember, while a toy can appeal to some kids no toy will ever appeal to every kid, so some year there may have been more then one toy that topped numerous kids Christmas lists.\n\nSo here it is. The good, the bad, the ugly and the “what the hell” of end-of-year commercialism.\n\nThe 25 Most Hyped Christmas Toys of All Time:\n\nLIONEL MICKEY MOUSE CIRCUS TRAIN SET (1935)\n\nIn 1900 inventor/machinist Joshua Lionel Cowen co-founded with Harry C. Grant the Lionel Corporation. Figuring that storefront windows would attract passers-by with automated displays, Cowen installed a train set – powered by a small motor that Cowen had originally invented for a portable fan – in the window of a store at 24 Murray Street in lower Manhattan that December. Nobody knows what the shop originally sold but the display did stop pedestrians in their (ahem!) tracks. Many then went into the store and inquired not about the shops inventory but rather asked if they could buy a train set of their own to give their kids for Christmas. Twelve train sets were sold and soon Lionel realized that they needed to focus on the trains, not window displays.\n\nFor the next three decades Lionel led the pack when it came to model railroads and as more and more homes were wired for electricity, more and more kids had a Lionel train set in their bedrooms. With beautifully crafted engines and cars, tracks that could be designed anew each time and all kinds of details like water towers, crossing signs, towns and figures, Lionel trains became an obsession for many and a bonding instrument for many fathers and sons.\n\nOf course, these trains were always more on the higher end of the toy pyramid and when the Great Depression hit in 1929 Lionel soon found itself struggling for survival as parents simply couldn’t afford to buy expensive starter sets or pricey add-ons for their kinder. The only way that Lionel could hope to survive was to produce more affordable trains. In 1930 they started a new banner called Winner Toys that sold inexpensive starter sets for just $3.25. What really helped turn the company around was a tie-in with one of the biggest names in show business, Walt Disney. A passionate train lover in his own right (he would later purchase a home specifically so that he could build his own ride-on model railroad on the property), Disney allowed Lionel to produce a small wind-up handcar that was operated by Mickey and Minnie Mouse which could run on Lionel’s O-gauge track. The $1.00 toy sold more then a quarter of a million units. A second car with Donald Duck and Goofy operating it also sold well. That’s when Lionel decided to up the ante by producing an entire Mickey Mouse circus train. Mickey drove the wind-up locomotive and the cars featured other Disney characters along for the ride. The tracks surrounded a big top with other cardboard cutouts depicting a circus midway. The inexpensive train set was a smash and led to a long association with Disney and Lionel, including a regular updated version of the original circus train.\n\nLionel again prospered after World War II, but as the years went by the demand for toy trains began to decline and they appealed more to the niche market of hobbyist rather then the mass market of kids. Still, even within this cottage industry Lionel is still the king of the rails.\n\nPET ROCK (1975)\n\nAre you aware of the fact that when the electronic vibrator was invented it was designed to cure women of such ailments as hysteria, neuraligia, morbid irritability, indigestion and constipation (they did tend to be more relaxed after using them)? Did you know that among the many electronic consumer goods available at the turn of the century was electric soap – a cake of soap with an electrical cord that you plug into an electric socket while taking a bath? For some reason there are very few testimonies as to how well it worked. And lets not forget the U.S. military’s fail-safe method for avoiding a nuclear attack, which was to “duck and cover”.\n\nP.T. Barnum said it best, there’s a sucker born every minute. It takes a genius to invent something that becomes an invaluable part of our daily lives but it also takes a special kind of genius to make us buy something of almost unimaginable stupidity. One such “genius” was Gary Dahl creator of – even after all these years it sounds ridiculous – the Pet Rock.\n\nA copywriter in the advertising industry, Gary Dahl was in a bar outside of Santa Cruz when he heard some of the fellow patrons complain about their pets. Dahl then quipped that he had the perfect idea for a pet that didn’t have to be fed, didn’t have to be cleaned up after, didn’t have to go to the vet, was never disobedient and never even died. What was this wonder companion? A rock.\n\nThis simple joke proved to be the eureka moment that lead to one fad that was weird even in the age of Charo, Disco Duck and Billy Beer. By importing a bunch of smooth stones from Rosarito Beach, California, placing them in little cardboard boxes with “breathing holes” poked into the lid and filling it with some straw for a bed, the Pet Rock was born. In many ways though the real kicker was not the little geological companion but rather the 32-page instruction manual titled The Care and Training of your Pet Rock. The manual featured such delicious passages as:\n\n“Rocks enjoy a rather long life span so the two of you will never have to part-at least not on you PET ROCK’S account.”\n\n“Look at your rock intently, like you really mean business, and give the command, STAY. Surprisingly, most rocks have no difficulty learning this command and respond quite obediently the first time they hear it.”\n\n“If you are getting blood out of your rock you should contact the Internal Revenue Service immediately. They’ve been attempting to do this very thing for years.”\n\nWith his background in marketing, Dahl was able to spread the word about this absurd product that frankly sounded like it should have been a joke in MAD Magazine. By October of 1975 they were being sold in stores across the country and were the must have Christmas gift of the year. Even if they were essentially a gag gift that didn’t stop Dahl from selling over a million of these sedimentary sensations by years end at $3.95 a pop. The beautiful thing was that there was practically no overhead. The rocks cost only a penny a piece and the straw cost next to nothing. With eons of erosion taking care of most of the manufacturing the only real expense was the printing of the boxes and mock instruction manuals.\n\nTo no ones surprise, the fad was a lot more short lived then any geological era. Dahl himself admitted they’d he’d be out of the Pet Rock business in a few months and “on to some other crazy scheme. Or lying on a beach somewhere not caring about it.”\n\nSure enough, by February the orders for Pet Rocks had ended, but not before Dahl had sold and shipped one million units to stores all across the country. By then the craze had pretty much ended and those already in stores had a very long shelf life. Dahl tried a few more gimmicky gifts – a Bicentennial Rock and “Sand Breeding Kits” didn’t gather much moss. In the end Dahl banked the money he made and opened up a tavern. With his characteristic love of irony he named the bar Carrie Nation after the famed axe-wielding temperance crusader.\n\nPet Rocks are occasionally re-issued. Vintage ones rarely sell for more then $20.00 on eBay. The Pet Rock may have been a short ride but until someone actually does figure out how to sell snow to the Eskimos then nothing will rock the pop culture zeitgeist like this thing did.\n\n2014 HESS TRUCKS (2014)\n\nIn 1964 the Hess Petroleum Corporation began selling die-cast toy trucks based on the companies bobtail tankers. The idea of a company that relies on a fleet of trucks to ship their goods creating toys out of their delivery vehicles was hardly an original one. Coca Cola, Budweiser, Kroger, Sears and U-Haul were just some of the consortiums that put out toy trucks. Heck, Hess wasn’t even the first filling station to license their name and logo to toy makers. Texaco, Gulf, Shell and other petroleum giants already had toys with their company’s logo on toy shelves all over the country. But there was undoubtedly something particularly wonderful about these Hess trucks. They were beautifully detailed, painted and durable. They were also a great last minute gift idea for a parent who couldn’t make it to the store on time. And as we’ve recently learned from the McRib Sandwich and Pumpkin Spice Late, making products available at only a certain time of the year can really add to it’s mystique.\n\nThe trucks returned the following year, and the year after that. Each year the truck was re-designed. In 1970 Hess made a fire engine and kids and adults loved it. Over the next few years Hess sold toy recreational vehicles, training vans, patrol cars and emergency trucks. Beginning in 1985 they began to include built-in coin banks and in 1988 they created their first truck to come with a race car, effectively giving the customer two vehicles in one. Soon Hess trucks regularly came with a second and sometimes even a third vehicle, be it a helicopter, and airplane, a motorcycle, even a space shuttle. While many a kid was delighted to see a Hess truck under his or her Christmas tree they were just as popular with adults. The Hess truck soon became one of the most collectable toys imaginable. Many people have been collecting these toys since the sixties. Some inherited their parents’ collection and have kept the tradition going. There is a mobile museum that travels the country displaying these collectable vehicles and their have even been local fire departments that have decked out their engines to resemble some of the classic green and white Hess fire trucks.\n\nIn 2014 the company outdid themselves yet again by putting out a truck that came with both a space cruiser and a smaller scout cruiser. Also, to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Hess truck, the company put out a limited edition replica of their original 1964 tanker truck that could only be purchased on-line. Since the original can sell on e-bay for up to $2,000 it was not surprisingly sought after by collectors. The new truck was also very sought after by collectors and fans but not just to keep tradition alive. Fact is, there was a real fear that this might be the last year of the Hess Trucks fabled existence.\n\nThat year Hess announced that they were selling off their filling stations/convenience stores to Speedway LLC, a division of Marathon Petroleum. By years end many Hess stations would be converted into Speedway and by 2017 all Hess stations in operation would join the Speedway family.\n\nFor longtime Hess truck collectors this was devastating news. Yes, Speedway had their own toy truck, but come on? It wasn’t the real thing. Adding a Hess truck to ones collection was a Christmas tradition as sacred as decorating the tree or visiting Grandma. The following year Hess truck fans breathed a sigh of relief when they learned that Hess, now solely a refining company, would continue to make and sell their annual toy trucks, the only caveat being that they could now only be purchased on-line. The following year they put out a new fire truck and this year you can buy a dump truck with it’s own loader.\n\nAnd so, after more then fifty years.\n\nThe Hess Trucks back and it’s better then ever\n\nFor Christmas this year, the Hess truck’s here!\n\nMONOPOLY (1936)\n\nSteve Jobs once said, “we (at Apple Computers) have always been shameless about stealing great ideas. “ A pretty frank statement from a man who is today remembered as a true visionary though he made more then his share of enemies along the way. He was hardly the only person to make this observation. Picasso himself once said, “A good artist borrows. A great artist steals.” Maybe, but in the world of business people don’t tend to be so honest. There’s just too much money involved.\n\nThe man credited with inventing the game Monopoly is Charles Darrow and while yes, the game we know and love today was designed by him he was none-the-less piggybacking off the fruits of others labor. In 1904 a woman named Elizabeth Magie was awarded a patent for a game she invented called The Landlords Game. The goal of the game was to “obtain as much wealth as possible” and effectively put other opponents out of business. Yet the object of the game was hardly the only similarity to the real estate trading game we all know and love today. Like Monopoly it was played on a board with forty spaces and twenty-two properties plus four railroads. Each had a start point where you collected a “salary” once you crossed it again. Each had a “jail” section and a “go to jail” square diagonally across on the top-right corner of the board. Deeds were distributed once a property was purchased and houses could be built on said property.\n\nClearly this was a forbearer of Monopoly though there was – at least in the mind of its inventor – a far greater purpose behind it. Magie was a harsh critic of free market capitalism and a staunch believer of economist Henry George and his “single tax” philosophy which theorized that all government could be funded by taxing nothing but property. It’s ironic that the very game that came to celebrate capitalism began as a sort of socialist tutorial but in the end people just found the game fun to play. Many also began to create their own versions of the game. One popular variation was called The Fascinating Game of Finance. This was the version that Ruth Hoskins, the Principal of a Quaker school in New Jersey was familiar with. She introduced the game to her fellow teachers and they eventually made their own version, this one with real-estate lots named for streets in nearby Atlantic City. This version of the game caught the attention of a real life Atlantic City hotel manager named Charles Todd and it was he who introduced it to a Germantown, Pennsylvania resident named Charles Darrow, an unemployed man with a gift for woodworking and illustration.\n\nHaving been unemployed for three years, Darrow began making his own version of the game he called Monopoly using an oilcloth to make a playing board which was originally circular and later rectangular. A jigsaw was used to make little wooden houses and hotels. Most significantly though were his color-coded properties and illustrations such as the little railroad silhouettes, the “free parking” car and the “go to jail” cop. With it’s distinct artwork Monopoly, unlike it’s many homemade imitators, and could actually be copyrighted. Darrow received a copyright in 1933 and began selling his games to friends and then later to stores. Encouraged, he sent copies of the game to both Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers, both of whom turned him down. Parkers found “52 fundamental errors” in the game, not the least of which was that it took too long to play (still an occasional criticism). By the end of the year Darrow had produced 7,500 copies of his game and got them into many of the biggest department stores in Philadelphia. Suddenly Parker Brothers had a change of heart. They bought the rights to the game and began mass-producing it. The game caught on like gangbusters and by Christmas of 1936 it was the most sought after Christmas gift item in the country, ultimately selling 1.8 million copies by years end.\n\nIt might seem a little odd that at the height of the Great Depression a game that seemed to celebrate the very speculation that was at least partially to blame for the economic state the country would be so thoroughly embraced. Then again, when one has no money to burn it’s fun to pretend to be rich. Also, compared to more expensive toys Monopoly was a good deal. It was a gift the whole family could enjoy and with a limited entertainment budget. Monopoly easily made staying in for the night an enjoyable option. And while a character of Charles Darrow still appeared on the game box it was in 1936 that illustrations were added to the Chance and Community Chest cards featuring a wealthy looking gent wearing a top hat and tails and sporting a handlebar mustache. This was the birth of the Monopoly Man, aka Rich Uncle Penny Bags, aka Mr. Monopoly.\n\nMonopoly has long since become a global phenomenon. A British version was also released in the U.K. in 1936 with the properties renamed after London streets. This version was actually sent to British P.O.W’s during World War II with escape maps, compasses, money and all sorts of supplies hidden within the playing pieces. Over the years countless international versions have been released, localized versions for just about every other major city in the U.S. not to mention a plethora of variations based on such popular entertainment properties such as Star Wars, The Simpsons, The Beatles, Harry Potter and countless others. Yet it’s the original game that we keep coming back to. After all, we all know that Park Place and Boardwalk make the most valuable Monopoly, the more railroads you own the more rent you can charge and that sooner or later someone is going to have to advance to St. Charles Place.\n\nTALKING BARNEY (1993)\n\nNecessity is the mother of invention. Sheryl Leach was a former schoolteacher turned stay-at-home Mom who needed to find a video to entertain her son. Problem was in the mid-1980’s there weren’t many shows or videos that appealed to toddlers. That’s when she came up with the idea to make her own videos. With some start-up capital provided by her Dad plus a commitment from fellow Texan Sandy Duncan to appear in the first three videos. The fruit of her labor was Barney and the Backyard Gang, a half hour long program centered around a group of kids and a big purple dinosaur who lived in the children’s imagination named Barney. Leach’s son did indeed like the videos and soon she began selling them via direct mail. They caught on locally in Texas and eventually started to make their way into other parts of the country. Eventually the Barney tapes caught the attention of a Mom who’s own father was the manager of a Connecticut PBS station. A production deal was put in place, a bigger budget allotted and the show was rechristened Barney & Friends. In no time Barney began airing on PBS stations across the country and it soon became the non-commercial networks most popular pre-school show since Sesame Street debuted over twenty years earlier.\n\nFact is Barney was in many ways the anti-Sesame Street. While the older show took place on an inner-city street, Barney took place in a suburban pre-school (probably in a gated community). While Big Bird was bright, inquisitive and at times showed his frustration, Barney was a big happy goof ball. Sesame Street cast non-professional kids who basically just acted naturally on camera, Barney’s kinder cast looked like they were recruited right out of the Professional Children’s School (some looked like they were old enough to be Bar Mitzvah’d). And while Sesame Street taught kids their ABC’s and 123’s, Barney was concerned with the virtues of brushing ones teeth, saying please and thank you and sharing ones toys. The biggest difference of all between the two shows was probably that Sesame Street was specifically designed to appeal to adults in the hope that they would watch with their children. Barney, on the other hand, was downright unbearable for anyone who didn’t have all of his or her baby teeth. Indeed, Barney was the first of many shows to be branded a “video babysitter”, something to keep the kiddies entertained while the grown-ups play Jenga in the next room.\n\nBy 1993 Barney was a white-hot phenomenon and soon retail stores were filled to the rafters with Barney merchandise. Games, bed sheets, coloring books, coin purses, backpacks, there was nary a consumer good manufactured that didn’t at one time or another have this Jurassic juggernaut’s likeness on it. Not surprisingly though it was a line of plush toys put out by Playschool that quickly became the most sought after tie-in. While soft, huggable dinos of various sizes made their way into children’s toy chest within the first two years, the most sought after item was the Talking Barney doll. The character spoke when you squeezed his hand and while his mouth didn’t yet move the much improved voice technology made it sound a lot clearer then your old See n’ Say. So while older kids might have wanted the ferocious plastic dinos from Jurassic Park (which was released that summer) the sippy-cup sect was all about the purple guy and he soon became the top selling toy that holiday season.\n\nInevitably sales of Barney merchandise began to decline the following year, yet the show remained popular and the toys kept coming off the assembly line. The dinosaur ended production of his show in 2009 though he wasn’t exactly extinct. Re-runs continued to air on the Sprout cable network. A new version was announced in 2017 so while the real dinosaurs can only be seen in a museum, this one might have a second life.\n\nNINTENDO ACTION SET (1988)\n\nIt’s almost impossible to believe now but there was a time when it looked like video games were going to go down in history with the lindy hop, hula-hoop and spyrograph. In other words a fad that caught the nations attention for a few years but was doomed to be forgotten when kids decided to move on to other things. Actually, video games themselves were still quite popular but in the U.S. the industry was in a shambles. An over production of games coupled with a glut of lousy games (see #6) led to a saturated market and thousands of unsold video cartridges. Over at the arcade proprietors were complaining because some kids had gotten so adept at certain games that they could play for hours on just one quarter. By 1983 the bottom fell out of the video game market and it looked like it was game over for this industry that had barely been around for a decade.\n\nOver in the land of the rising sun, however, video games were still a big deal. Kids were still pumping hundred yen coins into machines and software developers were creating some of the most popular games such as Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Frogger and Donkey Kong. Nintendo, a company founded in Kyoto back in 1889 as a manufacturer of playing cards, produced the latter. Branching out into electronic games in the seventies, Nintendo enjoyed great success in the arcade and later with their Game & Watch handheld video game series. Then in 1983 they entered the home console market with the Famicom, short for “family computer”. It was an immediate smash hit in Japan but when they looked into entering the U.S. market they were given the cold shoulder by toy retailers who had found themselves with warehouses of video game consoles and cartridges in the wake of the video game crash. If they were going to get toy stores to carry the console it was going to take some creative redesigning and rebranding.\n\nAnd so, for the North American domestic market, the console was christened the Nintendo Entertainment System or NES. Taking a page from Steve Jobs’ playbook, the machine and its peripherals were designed in soothing grays deliberately meant give off a sense of feng shui. The console itself was referred to as a “control deck,” the light gun that came with it was called the “Zapper” and the cartridges were referred to as “game packs.” And then there was the Trojan horse named R.O.B – the Robotic Operated Buddy. This WALL-E like toy android was meant to assist with certain games by reacting to flashes on the screen.\n\nThe NES was test marketed in New York in 1985 where it sold 90,000 units. Soon more and more regions began carrying the game system as word of mouth spread and sales increased. With a rich library of games that included such titles as Super Mario Bros., Duck Hunt, Mega Man, The Legend of Zelda, Excite Bike and many others, Nintendo soon found itself simultaneously reviving and dominating the video game industry. By 1988 Nintendo was red hot. However people began to get wise to the fact that R.O.B. had been nothing more then a marketing ploy. The thing rarely worked properly and when it did it was slow and clunky and only two games were made for R.O.B. Therefore in 1988 a new package sans R.O.B. called the NES Action Set was released and sold seven million copies in that year alone! By the end of the decade it was estimated that 30% of American households had an NES system.\n\nNintendo completely dominated the video game industry in the latter half of the 1980’s. In 1989 they introduced a handheld console called the Game Boy which proved to be another smash hit, selling 40,000 units on it’s very first day of sales in the U.S.! By the time the 1990’s began rival videogame developer Sega introduced their 16-bit console Genesis. Nintendo struck back with the Super Nintendo but they no longer cornered the market.\n\nNintendo has remained competitive all these years thanks to such later systems as Nintendo 64, Nintendo Game Cube, Nintendo Wii and most recently the Nintendo Switch, which is well on it’s way to being one of the biggest toys of this years holiday season. But the original NES will always have a very big place in the hearts of gamers. Just last year the NES Classic, a re-issue of the original console sold over two million copies. Not bad for a thirty-year old console.\n\nTEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES ACTION FIGURES AND VIDEO GAME (1990)\n\nIn 1983 two young comic book artists named Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird founded a small publishing company in Dover, New Hampshire called Mirage Studios. One day while brainstorming and talking about bad television shows Eastman drew a cartoon of a turtle that was also a ninja. It was meant as a joke. Turtles are, of course, notoriously slow moving and therefore could never master the art of jiujutsu. And yet they decided to run with it. Abandoning the jokey side of the drawing they instead created a science fiction story about four mutated turtles named after great renaissance painters – Donatello, Michelangelo, Leonardo and Rafael. They were highly skilled in the ninja arts thanks to their sensei Splinter, a mutated Japanese rat. This master and his pupils lived in the New York City sewers and the reptile quartet patrolled the streets of the Big Apple and protected it from bad guys, particularly a gang of badies called the Foot Clan. They were also, as the title suggests, teenagers, with a love for loud music, partying and especially pizza!\n\nEastman and Laird self-published their first comic book and sold it at conventions and eventually convinced comic bookstores to carry it. The title caught on and developed a cult following. Then licensing agent Mark Freedman entered the picture. Felling that these “hero’s in a half shell” could enjoy a life beyond the graphic novel crowd, he convinced Laird and Eastman to sign a marketing agreement. Freeman eventually interested a small toy manufacturer called Playmates Toys (no relation whatsoever to Hugh Hefner’s magazine) to produce a line of action figures. A deal was also made with an animation company called Fred Wolf Films to produce an animated series which was originally shown in syndicated markets one-day a week, the show generated enough interest to start selling toys. In 1989 it was expanded into a five-day a week cartoon show. That’s when the floodgates opened. Soon kids were in absolutely turtle crazy and the action figures plus any number of other paraphernalia was flying off the shelves at Wal*Mart and elsewhere.\n\nThings hit a feverish pitch in 1990. In that year a live-action film featuring some incredible animatronic turtle costumes created by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop was released by New Line Cinema (the company that would later produce the Lord of the Rings films) and became a box office smash. That same year a network version of TMNT began airing on CBS while the third-party game developer Konami came up with two different video games, one for the arcade and one for the Nintendo Entertainment System. 1990 might have been the Year of the Horse in China but in the U.S. and many other countries it was most definitely the Year of the Turtle and by Christmas kids wanted these radical reptiles. Every kid wanted something different. Maybe they wanted Sword Slicing’ Leo or Slice ‘N Dice Shredder. Maybe they wanted the Turtle Blimp or the Pizza Thrower or the Sewer Play set. Parents might have hoped that the kids wanted something on the lower end of the price range and finding the precise toy could be a bit of a nightmare but most kids no doubt shouted a hearty “cowabunga!” when they saw their turtle toys under the Christmas tree.\n\nThe turtles continued Kung-Fu fighting well into the nineties although they eventually lost their punch and would lose out to other karate chopping crime fighters, most notably the Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers. The turtles have had several successful revivals and in 2014 returned to the big screen in a highly successful new live-action film (with CGI turtles, natch) that was a big hit. But nothing will ever top the Turtle mania that was stirred in 1990, a year that was, as the turtle Michelangelo would say, “totally awesome dude!”\n\nTWISTER (1966)\n\nIn 1886 a jeweler in Hennepin, Minnesota received a shipment of pocket watches at the local train depot. He hadn’t ordered them and planed to send them back. Instead the station agent, Richard Warren Sears, bought the watches and sold them to his fellow agents and train conductors. He later started a mail order business that, with the help of his eventual partner Alvah Roebuck would lead to the creation of one of the biggest retail empires in American history. In 1928 a Scottish chemist named Alexander Fleming working in a London hospital noticed a petri dish containing the virus Staphylococcus that had accidently been left out by one of his colleagues. He also noticed that a fungus hand grown around the culture. Looking at it under the microscope he noticed that the fungus was killing the bacteria. This would eventually lead to the synthesizing of penicillin for antibiotic use. Heck, even the colonization of the Americas came about after an Italian explorer got lost.\n\nThe map of history is dotted with such serendipitous pho pas, and the toy industry is no exception. In 1966 Milton Bradley bought the rights to a game called Pretzel, so named because it was “the game that will tie you up in knots.” It consisted solely of a white, polka-dotted vinyl matt and a spinner. The dots were arranged into four columns – one red, one blue, one yellow and one green. Each column had six rows. What made the game unique was that the players themselves were the play-pieces. All but one participant took off their shoes and stood around the matt. The extra player became the “caller” and would flip the spinner and call out the color/appendage that the arrow landed on – i.e. “right foot blue”, “left hand green”. Each player placed his or her body part on corresponding dot but only one player could have a foot or hand on any given circle. One by one the players would start to lose their balance and fall down. The last one not to be completely horizontal won the game/round.\n\nRenaming the game Twister so as not to be confused with a toy dog on the market named Pretzel, the game made its debut at the 1966 New York Toy Fair. Unfortunately the game almost immediately drew criticism for encouraging people of the opposite sex to get down on all fours and play a game where their genital areas ended up in such close proximity. Sales were slow and many retail outlets refused to carry it. When Sears refused to stock the game that’s when Milton Bradley decided to cut their losses and pull the plug on Twister. General Tire was told to stop making those mats that looked like oversized Wonder Bread wrappers, outstanding orders were canceled and all print and TV ads were pulled.\n\nAnd yet amazingly, nobody at MB contacted the P.R. firm that was hired to promote the game. What’s more, the firm had convinced the producers of The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson to feature it on the late night talk show. On May 3, 1966, Johnny Carson and his guest Eva Gabor of Green Acres took off their shoes and played the game before forty million American viewers. The next day Abercrombie and Fitch, one of the few retailers still selling the game, sold out of Twister within a few hours. Milton Bradley’s phones were ringing off the hook with toy distributors. Literally overnight Twister went from an also ran to the finish line and in it’s first year sold three million copies.\n\nWhile kids and families certainly did love Twister even though it was always designed as a party game for adults. And even if it was a wee bit naughty (critics dubbed it “sex in the box”) in none-the-less became the party game of the swinging sixties and frankly became pretty tame once the seventies gave us the key party. Lucky for MB the game was not a fad and remains popular to this day. Also, with only two pieces of equipment – the matt and the spinner – it boasts a very low manufacturing cost and the millions of people who have purchased the game over the years haven’t had to worry about missing pieces, well, not unless they’re still trying to “find themselves” that is.\n\nPOKEMON MERCHANDISE (1999)\n\nIn 1980 the Japanese video game manufacturer Capcom released the arcade game Pac-Man (originally known in Japan as Puck-Man). It was an immediate smash hit, so much so that the Japanese mint reportedly had a shortfall of 100 Yen coins in circulation due to so many of them ending up in arcade machines. The game was brought to the U.S. by amusement giant Midway where it repeated its success. Soon the entire country had “Pac-Man Fever” to quote the song by Buckner and Garcia (what, you never heard of them?). It wasn’t just that Pac-Man was a fun game but that unlike earlier arcade classics like Pong, Asteroids, Space Invaders and Breakout, this omnivorous yellow sphere and his ghost monster predators were actually identifiable characters that, despite their abstraction, gamers could identify with. Not only were their a whole bunch of follow up Pac-Man games (Ms. Pac-Man, Pac-Man, Jr., Pac-Man Plus) but there was also a whole plethora of Pac-Man merchandise from toys to bed sheets to board games to a breakfast cereal and a Saturday Morning cartoon. Over the years the world of gaming has given us other superstars that have branched out into other media and found their image licensed including Donkey Kong, Mario, Luigi, Q*Bert, Sonic the Hedgehog and many others. But it was at the end of the decade that another video game based craze would start, this one with a virtual menagerie of marketable, collectable creatures.\n\nOriginally released in Japan as Pocket Monsters, Pokémon was the brainchild of Satoshi Tajiri, the founder of the Game Freak software developer. Inspired by his childhood hobby of collecting insects, Tajiri envisioned a game for Nintendo’s portable Game Boy console in which players collected little creatures, stored them in a small orb and could later pit their Pokémon together in energy battles using a USB cable. The first two games – Pocket Monsters Red and Green were both released simultaneously in Japan and were instant hits. Soon a Manga comic book series was produced as well as an animated TV show. New games followed for the Game Boy and the new Nintendo 64 system plus boatloads of merchandise. It wasn’t too long before they went international.\n\nFirst the video games were released in the U.S, giving Nintendo a much-needed shot-in-the-arm after losing a fair amount of market share to the Sony PlayStation. Soon the animated series was dominating the afternoon TV market, an endless stream of Pokémon toys and other merch was filling up Wal*Mart’s, K-Mart’s and Toys “R” Us stores around the country. Pokémon: The First Movie was released in 1999 and some parents even relented to letting their kids miss school to see it on opening day. And then there was the trading card game that took off like crazy. On the one hand it was kind of neat to see kids sit down, interact with one another and play a game that didn’t require electricity. On the other hand there were reports of schoolyard scuffles over cards and schools banning the cards outright because they distracted kids from their schoolwork. Some advocacy groups argued that the games promoted violence (the Pokémon “fight” but not in a particularly violent way) that they promote cruelty to animals and some complained that they were sacrilegious, even though Pope John Paul II endorsed them. Yet kids just couldn’t get enough of cute little energy creatures and by Christmas of 1999 “gotta catch ‘em all” was all every kid in America could think about.\n\nFortunately for parents the Pokémon franchise had diversified into so many different areas that there wasn’t a single particular item that was number one on kids Christmas list. Some might have wanted the latest game or DVD’s of the movie or other episodes (provided that parents had gotten a DVD player at that point). Some might have wanted plush toys or figurines of Pigeotto, Jigglypuff, Bulbasaur or the franchises mascot, the adorable little vaguely feline looking electric monster Pikachu. The cards were particularly big and while the cost of a box of trading cards had gone up considerably it was only the rare, hard to find cards that were going for big bucks on e-bay and let’s face it, Santa has never really been a personalized shopper.\n\nWhile Pokémon mania naturally subsided as kids got into Harry Potter, SpongeBob and other marketable properties, Pokémon nonetheless remained big well into the 2000’s. In 2016 the franchised celebrated its twentieth anniversary by both re-releasing it’s first three games – Pokémon Red, Blue and Yellow but also by announcing the launch of their new mobile game Pokémon Go, in which players use a GPS to “locate” virtual Pokémon in the real world. The game became a phenomenal success, particularly amongst millennials that had grown up during the first wave of Pokémon fervor. Today these little Pocket Monsters have become the second best-selling video game franchise right behind Nintendo’s jump happy plumber Mario. And with the Nintendo Switch expected to be a big gift this holiday season it’s all but a given that Pikachu and his friends will soon be playing hide and seek with virtual Pokémon masters the world over.\n\nHOT WHEELS (1968)\n\nFor many the first real step into adult hood comes not by putting one foot in front of the other but rather by stepping on the gas peddle once you get your drivers license or, even more significantly, get your own car! Until that moment though, kids have had to make believe and over the years there have been many wonderful toy automobile lines from Tonka Trucks to Corgi Cars, Micro Machines and of course Matchbox Cars. Founded in 1953, the latter are a line of die-cast, palm sized toy cars that originally came in little boxes resembling those that matches came in. They were wonderfully realistic looking cars that resemble the kinds of vehicles that you’d see on the road – station wagons, sedans, compact cars, moving vans, delivery trucks, etc. While they certainly ruled the die-cast parking lot they soon got some serious competition once Mattel decided to enter the field.\n\nTo design their new line of vehicles Mattel hired Harry Bentley Bradley, a former designer from General Motors. Unlike Matchbox, the Hot Wheels line was meant to be, well, hot, that is to say sexy. Their cars were miniature racecars and exotic sports cars rather then everyday vehicles. They were also designed with lighter axels, which meant that with a little push they could go faster. Parents could either get their kids an individual car or buy the entire original set of sixteen in a circular carrying case. Yet the real kicker were the four separately sold racing tracks – the Strip Action Set, The Drag Race Action Set, the Stunt Action Set and the Hot Curves Race Action Set. Each of these sets consisted of several drag strips made out of flexible orange plastic that could be bent and shaped into different racecourses. With a little help from our old friend gravity, these cars could race around these plastic strips faster then any toy car that came before it.\n\nBacked by a staggering $10 million advertising campaign, Hot Wheels went from zero to sixty in no time and by Christmas that checkered flag was well in sight. Sales of Hot Wheels left all other toy cars in the dust. Matchbox itself reportedly saw their sales plummet from $28 million to $6 million. They managed to retaliate with their hot Superfast series of hot rods, which helped them regain some much needed traction but they couldn’t have the road to themselves any longer. Hot Wheels were here to stay and they’ve been racing along ever since, introducing new car models, racetracks, play sets and the like every year.\n\nG.I. JOE (1964)\n\nSince time immortal little boys, oblivious to the horrors of the battlefield but completely receptive to the pomp and pageantry of the military, have dreamed about going to war and engaging in combat. And in the days when gender roles were clearly defined little boys were encouraged to act out their primordial fantasies of conquest by constructing swords out of wood and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with their buddies. Later, toy makers in Germany would make wooden soldiers, metal workers would produce little men made out of some kind of iron ore while in the post war years little soldiers made of plastic that stood upright in a fixed position became a mainstay of any boys bedroom. Then a new kind of hero – a real American hero at that – came along and forever changed our minds about make-believe combat.\n\nThere’s some controversy over who originally came up with the idea for G.I. Joe. One version has Larry Reiner, a designer for the Ideal Toy Company, coming up with the idea and pitching it to licensing agent Stan Weston. Weston’s own recollection was that he had the idea for a soldier toy that could appeal to boys the way Mattel’s Barbie appealed to girls. He contacted Reiner about designing the toy, suggesting that it should be roughly a foot tall with limbs that could be manipulated to strike various action poses.\n\nWhatever the case may be, Stan Weston brought the idea to Hasbro, a Rhode Island based toy company that had enjoyed great success with Mr. Potato Head a decade earlier but now was in receivership. Aside from the companies perilous financial state there was the need to get the toy manufactured in time for the 1964 Toy Fair. But the biggest obstacle of all was the word of caution that came out of every market research department at every toy company in America, which was that no boy would ever, ever play with a doll. Confronting this dilemma the marketing department coined a new term that would soon enter the American lexicon – “Action Figure”. Four different figures were ready for the toy fair, one for each branch of the U.S. Military – An Army Soldier, a Navy Seamen, An Air Force Fighter Pilot and a Marine commando. Originally they were each going to get unique names – the pilot would be “Ace”, the sailor would be “Skip” and the commando would be “Rocky”. When it came time for the foot soldier it was decided to name him “Joe” in honor of “G.I. Joe”. This was not an actual person but rather a blanket term for all the ordinary men who risked their lives in combat, as well as an allusion to the 1945 movie The Story of G.I. Joe. Ultimately “G.I. Joe” became the name of the entire toy line.\n\nThe nearly bankrupt Hasbro spent a staggering $15 million developing their toy, which was worked on in almost military-like secrecy. Even Hasbro employees were discouraged from talking about the man-of-action with their spouses. It wasn’t until G.I. Joe was unveiled at the 1964 Toy Fair that it was clear that Hasbro had a winner on their hand and Joe soon stormed toy shelves like they were the sands of Iwo Jima or the shores of Tripoli. Backed by a massive advertising campaign, G.I. Joe caught the imagination of just about every American child with a Y chromosome. At a time when numerous baby boomers had Dad’s that either fought in World War II or in Korea and having grown up with the image of John Wayne storming the beaches of Normandy, they couldn’t wait to get their own Joe and act out their military missions in their own backyard. Joe also came with many accessories that were great for Hasbro’s bottom line, from a cache of weapons to jeeps and tanks and fighter planes. G.I. Joe pretty much saved Hasbro from annihilation by creating their own miniature military industrial complex.\n\nIronically, Joe came out right around the time the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution passed and soon America was once again at war in South East Asia. After the disastrous Tet Offensive of 1968 even some of the most hawkish Americans were beginning to re-think their views on American military intervention. With sales of Joe plummeting Hasbro decided to re-think their All-American Hero. Instead of being a soldier G.I. Joe became a “man of action”. Instead the Joe’s were re-imagined as part of an Adventure Team. The Naval sailor became “sea-adventurer”. The Marine commando became a sort of Grizzly Adams man of nature and so fourth. They all were given “life like” hair and beards that made them look more then a little bit hippyish and each one wore a medallion with an emblem that closely resembled the hippie peace symbol. This new Joe did well but he was soon competing with new Action Figures lines based on James Bond and The Six Million Dollar Man. Eventually Joe was decommissioned.\n\nBy 1982 it was morning again in America. President Ronald Reagan had launched an aggressive military recruitment campaign, encouraging young Americans to “Be All That You Can Be” and join the Army. He also started the largest peacetime arms buildup to protect our shores from the “Evil Empire” of the Soviet Union. Also, Hasbro looked at the phenomenal sales figures for Kenner’s Star Wars toy line. Wanting in on the action Hasbro re-launched G.I. Joe as a line of quarter inch plastic action figures. Unlike their contemporaries from a galaxy far, far away, these new Joes had movable limbs that could allow our hero’s to strike various battle poses. And while the original G.I. Joe was basically a line of generic military men the new line was dubbed G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero. This time “G.I. Joe” was a code name for an elite task force that fought a rouge terrorist network called C.O.B.R.A. The Joe’s were now a seemingly endless group of fighting men and women with names like Duke, Snake Eyes, Flint, Lady Jay, Shipwreck and others that frankly looked a bit like a cross between the Dirty Dozen and the Village People. Their foes were a rogue’s gallery of badies that included C.O.B.R.A. Commander, Destro, The Baroness, Zartan and Major Blood. Aided by a Marvel comic book series and a weekday afternoon cartoon show, G.I. Joe enjoyed one of the greatest comebacks in the history of the toy industry, and thanks to a new movie franchise we can probably expect G.I. Joe to be fighting for many years to come.\n\nTAMAGOTCHI (1997)\n\nWhen the Pet Rock was “invented” back in 1975, computer technology was in, well, the stone age (or at least the iron age). The only computers most people had ever actually used were either calculators or video games. Personal Computers were strictly the province of computer hobbyists and they had to be built from either from scratch or an electronics kit. The Internet meanwhile was a communication network devised by the military that very few people knew about.\n\nBy 1996 computers were part of our daily lives. Personal computers could be bought at any Best Buy and their computing power was greater then the very computers NASA used to send the Apollo 11 astronauts to the moon and while they were not yet a “common” household item they were fast becoming one. More and more people were getting on-line and exploring the net and even those who weren’t computer literate none-the-less used the computers in their car, microwave or local ATM.\n\nAnd so it seems only appropriate that two decades after the Pet Rock hit the shelves that a more high tech but equally frivolous virtual companion would come along. And so it did as the Tamagotchi, a little egg shaped digital device that could fit in the palm of your hand. The irony is that while the Pet Rock was a domesticated pet that one didn’t have to clean up after, feed or tend to when it was ill, a Tamagotchi owner had to do all of those things and yet their virtual pet was not much more of a cuddly companion then those geological novelties from the Ford administration.\n\nThe Tamagotchi was the brainchild of Akihiro Yokoi of the Wiz Toy Company and Aki Maita of Bandai (believe it or not, the later would win the Nobel Prize in mathematics for her role in this invention). When the Tamagotchi was activated a small egg was shown on the screen that shakes for a while and then hatches. A clock is set and four different meters are loaded, a Hunger meter, a Happy meter, a Discipline meter and a “Bracelet” meter. Essentially when the pet is “hungry” it must be (virtually) fed. When it’s naughty it must be scolded, hence the discipline meter. One can play games with the creature and they can also be house broken. When they have to “go” one could make a toilet appear. If the owner failed to do so the pet would leave droppings behind, lowering his “happy” meter until his master cleans it up.\n\nYet what made the stakes in Tamagotchi husbandry particularly daunting was that the pets could actually die! The bracelet meter measured how healthy they were. The pets could get “sick” from over or under feeding them or not cleaning up after them. If they get sick they won’t play or eat and the owner must use the “medicine” option to revive it. If the pet is neglected, it will die. But even if the pet is very well cared for it will still die! That’s because all Tamagotchi’s simulate a life cycle, going from baby to child to teen to adult (and in later models a senior). Sooner or later we all have to dance with the Reaper. When a pet “dies” it is often depicted turning into an angel and flying away. Some Tamagotchi owners no doubt deliberately neglected their pets just to see them die. No need to call the Human society though. Once a pet’s life cycle ended the program would simply restart (considering the fact that it was invented in a predominately Buddhist country it shouldn’t be too surprising that re-incarnation should be the ultimate fate). Of course some die-hard enthusiasts actually buried their Tamagotchi in their yard.\n\nThe little digital critters were released in Japan in 1996 and in the U.S. the following year. Sure enough plenty of kids wanted one in their stocking. Fortunately their retail price of $17.99 wasn’t going to put Mom and Dad into hock. At the height of their popularity it was estimate that fifteen of these little guys were sold every minute in the U.S. and Canada. When kids returned to school they often brought the little toys with them so that they could care for them, often disrupting class by “feeding” them while their teachers were giving a lecture. Before long Tamagotchi’s were blacklisted from schools along much like Garbage Pail Kids before them and Pokémon cards and heelies after.\n\nNew Tamagotchi’s were released regularly with various upgrades. Some could later connect with other units; some could get “married” and have “children” (or puppies or kittens or whatever their offspring were called). Some even could be programed into a computer to earn Gotchi Points and buy your pet virtual items. An estimated 76 million have been sold as of 2010 and while their popularity peaked towards the end of the century their have always been an international clique of Tamagotchi enthusiasts. A twentieth anniversary version became a must-have toy for collectors and an original Tamagotchi can fetch several hundred dollars on e-bay.\n\nCASTLE GRAYSKULL (1983)\n\nLegend has it that toy giant Mattel had the chance to own the toy rights to a yet-to-be-released science fiction/fantasy series called Star Wars (remember it?). Mattel was interested but they balked at director/producer George Lucas’ $100,000 asking price. I don’t think I have to tell you that they lived to regret their decision to pass on the property.\n\nLooking for another fantasy series Mattel entered into negotiations to produce a toy line to accompany the release of Conan the Barbarian, a fantasy action film starring a then relatively unknown former bodybuilder and future governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger. When Mattel saw how violent the movie was and sensing that it would get an R rating, they opted to cancel the toy line and use the molds to create a new character called He-Man. Another side of the story comes from toy designer Roger Sweet. In his book Mastering the Universe: He-Man and the Rise and Fall of a Billion Dollar Idea he created the character using molds from a discontinued toy called Big Jim and that He-Man was designed as a generic character that could be placed into any action setting. Either way, the producers of Conan sued Mattel claiming that He-Man was a rip-off of Conan the Barbarian. Ultimately, the judge ruled in Mattel’s favor.\n\nWhatever the truth may be, this much we know. The Masters of the Universe toy line was released in 1981. It featured a cast of action figures that on the good side included He-Man, Man-at-Arms, Teela and Stratos. On the bad side were Skelletor, Beast Man, Evil Lynn and Trap Jaw. The characters were meant to be a mix of medieval sword and sorcery and high tech modern science fiction. Since there was no movie, literary source or TV series that kids could use as a frame of reference, D.C. Comics created a series of mini-comics that were included with the figures and which helped clarify the story line, which was set in a post-apocalyptic world called Eternia. In 1982 the first Masters play set was released, a marvelous fortress called Castle Grayskull. Divided into two parts that could close together to form a carrying case, the castle had what appeared to be a skull-like face. Inside there were decals showing computers, a throne that looked like it could have come from the James T. Kirk collection and a laser cannon mounted on one of the towers. In a word, Castle Grayskull was downright awesome! The figures and the play set sold well but the powers that be at Mattel soon realized that they could sell a lot more toys if they were tied into a movie or TV show.\n\nEver since plastic Howdy Doody puppets were made to tie-in with TV’s first successful children’s show, toys and TV had gone hand in hand. Yet the toys were always derived from the series. This was to be a major case of putting the cart before the horse. Yet Mattel was adamant. They approached Filmation, the animation studio responsible for Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids to create the series. When the networks passed on the show, Filmation made the unusual choice to produce the show for the afternoon syndicated market. This meant that they had to produce a whopping 65 episodes to meet the demands of a five-day a week schedule. To their credit Filmation delivered and while the animation was limited it certainly wasn’t any worse then what was shown on Saturday mornings. The show stoked the ire of the Action for Children’s Television (ACT) and other advocacy groups who made the not altogether untruthful assertion that He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (as the show was named) was little more then a glorified TV commercial (when it aired in the U.K. Mattel was forbidden to advertise any Masters of the Universe toys while a given episode was airing). Be that as it may, kids loved the show and by Christmas the toys were red hot. Okay, they weren’t the big toy that Christmas. The Cabbage Patch Kids totally hold that top spot. But for boys who dreamed of battle rather then child rearing, Castle Grayskull was the must-have toy and millions of play sets, not to mention action figures (each sold separately) made their way onto Santa’s sleigh.\n\nMasters of the Universe continued to thrive for several more years. The company that created Barbie also tapped into young girls feeling of feminine empowerment by launching She-Ra: Princess of Power. They all sold well but He-Man and his crew were beginning to lose their momentum by 1987. A dreadful film starring Dolph Lungrin and Frank Langella didn’t help matters. By decades end Masters of the Universe had run it’s course.\n\nMattel tried twice to revive the Masters franchise in both 1990 and in 2002. Both toy revivals were accompanied by a new animated series but they failed to catch on. In 2008 Mattel launched the Masters of the Universe classics series, largely faithful recreations of the original toys, including Castle Grayskull. Not surprisingly, these appealed mostly to collectors who originally played with the toys back during the Reagan years. A new film version has been in development hell for a number of years. One thing is for sure though. For many a little boy nothing was more exiting then bounding down the stairs in ones footie pajamas and seeing the forbidding faux-stone edifice of Castle Grayskull and the sheer excitement of getting to learn all of the secrets within!\n\nRAZOR SCOOTERS (2000)\n\nAt least as far back as the Flexible Flyer sled and the Radio Flyer wagon, toy companies and other manufacturers have been capitalizing on a kids need for at least some independence and mobility. Toys like child-sized tricycles, Big Wheels and Power Wheels let kids ride around their backyard. Roller skates, bikes and skateboards on the other hand give kids at least a modicum of freedom to venture beyond their own block. Somewhere in between we have the kick scooter.\n\nThe first such kick scooters were homemade contraptions usually devised by affixing a pair of roller skates to a board and fastening a vertical crate that acted as the devices handlebars. Think of the scooter Marty McFly confiscates in Back to the Future. By keeping one foot on the board and using the other foot to propel oneself forward, these scooters at least gave kids a way to get around the neighborhood, though it wasn’t much more convenient then walking. Later toy manufacturers began making two and three wheel scooters that were more aerodynamic thanks to narrower footboards and handlebars that actually allowed the rider to steer. Now you were getting somewhere, especially if you were going downhill! In 1974 Honda, at that time best known for making motor scooters, invented the Kick ‘n Go. These scooters used a metal lever that the rider pumped with the back of their heel to make the device go. Frankly, it didn’t add much power though it’s metal design would play a major role in the creation of the big Christmas item of 2000.\n\nThe Razor was the brainchild of Wim Ouboter, a thirty-nine year old Swiss citizen who designed the two-wheeled scooter out of boredom. The idea was a lightweight, metal scooter that could be used to travel to destinations that were too far to walk but too short to ride a bike to. Also, whereas a bike needs to be chained up to prevent theft, the Razor was designed to be collapsible so that it could fit in ones backpack or simply carried like a skateboard. Forming a company called Micro Mobility Systems, Ouboter found a manufacturer in Taiwan who was willing to make the vehicles and also to sell them in the U.S, where they partnered with a California manufacturer named Carlton Calvin. They set up shop in the Golden State and called their new scooters Razor and the company RazorUSA.\n\nOnce the scooters went on sale in 2000 they immediately kicked off (pun intended). In their first year alone some five million scooters were sold and the $125 toys made their way under many a lucky kids Christmas tree, preferably with a bow attached.\n\nRazors proved to be great for kids. They could get around town and didn’t run the risk them getting stolen as with their bikes. On the debit side, many kids were known to ride them in the Mall or in Target, scuffing up the floors while causing a considerable safety hazard. Perhaps the most annoying thing about the Razor was that many grown-ups started riding them. Is there anything more asinine then a fully-grown man in a business suit drinking a late and talking into a Bluetooth while riding along in an aluminum toy that looked like it belonged to Dennis the Menace? Three years later a motorized scooter was introduced by Razor. Frankly they didn’t go that much faster and at least the kick scooters required some physical activity.\n\nOh well. Razor scooters have remained extremely popular. Smaller three-wheel scooters are recommended for younger kids and helmets are a must. The company also sponsors it’s own exhibition sports team called Team Razor, where gifted Razorists perform stunts at the X-Games in Los Angeles and at exhibitions throughout the country.\n\nTEDDY RUXPIN (1985)\n\nIn 1877 Thomas Edison’s Phonograph Toy Manufacturing Company created a small doll with a tiny phonograph in her torso. A small crank was turned and she would recite a nursery rhyme like “Mary Had A Little Lamb” or “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star”. The dolls sold between $20 and $25 dollars, meaning that only a family of means could afford it, though a $10 model was available without a hat or dress. Edison himself later said that “the voices of the little monsters were exceedingly unpleasant to hear.” Still, it was a watershed moment in the history of toys, the first one that could actually say something, that is without children providing the voice themselves.\n\nIn later years other toys were created using little celluloid disks and a pull string to activate them. Chatty Cathy was one. The See n’ Say was another. Before long licensed characters ranging from Woody Woodpecker to Bugs Bunny to Big Bird to E.T. were getting their own pull string toys. Of course, the magic was kind of limited. They could only say a few things and before long those disks began to sound like finger nails on a chalkboard every time that string was pulled.\n\nThe man who undoubtedly changed talking toys forever was Ken Forsse. A man who once worked for both Disney and puppeteers Sid and Marty Kroft, he founded a small company called Alchemy II, Inc. They were responsible for creating the life-sized puppet costumes for the early Disney Channel series Dumbo’s Circus and Welcome to Pooh Corner. But they really hit pay dirt in 1985 when they created Teddy Ruxpin. This soft teddy bear was different from other talking toys because he didn’t rely on a string and a little cylinder with a few pre-recorded phrases. Instead a tape deck was hidden in his back. Two channel cassettes could be played on the device. One played audio and the other controlled his eyes and mouth, making it look like Teddy was actually alive!\n\nThe toy was sold to the five-year-old toy company Worlds of Wonder who quickly backed the stuffed ursine with a major ad campaign and a whole line of storybooks and cassette tapes that could be purchased later (a kid could play a regular cassette in Teddy but his motion sensors would not respond so his mouth and eyes remained stationary). The bear was an instant smash and he went on to top the Christmas shopping list in 1985 and 1986! A companion toy named Grubby, apparently some kind of caterpillar, was created and could communicate with Teddy via a cable. There was also a cast of supporting characters that included Fobs, Woolly What’s-It and L.B. The Bounder.\n\nThough some adults found the teddy bear to be creepy or found his saccharine stories to be coy, kids loved him. It didn’t hurt that he had a friendly face, a soft, huggable body (something the future Furby’s lacked) and looked like he was always ready for a hug. The toy was a boon to Worlds of Wonder, who also had a hit with a home Laser Tag game. Alas, Teddy was easy to duplicate. Not only were there knock-off bears like Bingo and Gabby Bear on the market but other talking toys like the talking Playschool doll Cricket. Worlds of Wonder signed deals to produce talking toys based on Mickey Mouse and Snoopy but they didn’t do as well. The company was hit hard by the 1987 stock market crash and went out of business in 1990.\n\nPopular toys never completely die, though. While an original Teddy Ruxpin in his original box is certainly a collectors item there have been many re-issues by Hasbro, Yes! Entertainment, BackPack Toys and just this year, Wicked Cool Toys. The later has dispensed with magnetic audiotape and instead relies on three pre-recorded stories all on one little microchip. Other stories can be downloaded via a mobile app. While there’s no shortage of high-tech talking toys on the market today it’s not hard to see Teddy Ruxpin occupying a spot on many a kids toy shelf.\n\nMR. POTATO HEAD (1952)\n\nIn the years following World War II America experienced an age of prosperity unprecedented in the history of the world. Goods and services were plentiful and middle class Americans found themselves with more disposable income then ever before, not to mention more things they could spend their money on. Among the things that the masses now had access to were:\n\nAn abundance of food. With so many families unable to afford enough sustenance during the Depression, followed by wartime food rationing, Americans soon found themselves with plenty to eat (and the expanding waist lines to prove it), as new supermarkets seemed to open every week.\n\nA surplus of plastic. With wartime rationing over, chemical companies were now selling acres of cheap, plastic raw material that could be melted down and molded into a huge variety of goods. Plastics lack of biodegradability was not much of a concern at the time.\n\nTelevision. Though this wondrous invention had been in development since the 1920’s it wasn’t until 1948 that televisions were being massed produced and radio networks began broadcasting enough programs to entice people to shell out a couple of weeks worth of a pay to buy a set.\n\nAll of these factors would play a huge role in the creation of one of the worlds most offbeat, interchangeable and endearing (if perhaps starchy) toys.\n\nThe man who sired this super spud was Brooklyn native George Lerner who conceived the idea of a toy with facial features that could be re-arranged in a variety ways by using little plastic pieces to represent eyes, a nose, lips, a mustache, even a pipe. The pieces were affixed with little pointed prongs (think corn holders) that could be inserted into the skin of just about any fruit or vegetable. Lerner shopped the idea around to various toy companies, none of whom were willing to buy the toy. After all, from the time we start teething we’re told not to play with our food. Perhaps it shouldn’t be too surprising that he eventually sold the idea to a company that packaged food, namely cereal. The idea was to distribute the plastic parts in boxes of cereal as a premium, then as now with the idea was that kids will bug their parents to buy more boxes in order to “collect them all.” Everything changed when he met Henry and Merrill Hassenfeld, two brothers who’s Rhode Island based manufacturing firm made school supplies. Wanting to break into the toy business, the Hassenfeld’s paid the cereal company $7,000 to buy Lerner out of his deal with them. Hassenfeld Brothers – later renamed Hasbro – packaged the various pieces together as part of a “funny face kit”. A plastic torso with arms and legs was made to serve as a stand on top of which the toys vegetable cranium would rest. Though any fruit or vegetable could be used the pieces worked best on a potato, ergo the toy became known as Mr. Potato Head.\n\nOf course the Hassenfeld’s were new to the toy game and they had to compete with more established companies for shelf space in toy stores, let alone get the attention of young consumers. Most toy companies advertised in print media, creating eye-catching ads for newspapers, magazines and of course comic books. That’s when the Hassenfeld’s decided to take a major, expensive gamble and sell their toy on that newfound technological wonder called television. At the time kids shows like Howdy Doody and Kukla, Fran and Ollie were sponsored mostly by cereal and candy companies but thus far no toy company had tried their luck marketing their product over the airwaves. The Hassenfeld’s realized that unlike with radio, TV would actually let kids see the product and what quirky things kids could do with it. Sure enough, Mr. Potato Head took off. Kids saw the toy commercial and quickly asked their parents to buy them a kit, not a hard sell considering that they were only 98 cents each. By Christmas these kits became the most popular gift of the year. Even if some kids had to wait until the A&P opened the next day to get that all-important potato for a head, kids across the country were thrilled to get a Mr. Potato Head kit. Over a million of them were sold in the first year alone.\n\nMr. Potato Head put Hasbro on the map. He later got a spouse named (surprise, surprise) Mrs. Potato Head. The two of them later had two children, a son named Spud and a daughter named Yam. While the plastic parts were reusable, the potato head was not. Kids soon left their bro from Idaho around the house as it biodegraded. Kids also began pricking themselves on the sharp prongs. With new safety regulations introduced Lerner was called into duty to give Mr. P a reusable plastic head with pre-drilled holes. Now dull pegs, rather then sharp prongs were used to create Mr. Potato Heads interchangeable facial features. Later the still rather small pieces were deemed a choking hazard. Therefore a fourth Mr. Potato Head was introduced in 1975. This one was twice as big, as were the pieces. Alas, the potato now made up his whole body, only his feet were not part of his cranium. He didn’t have any arms and worst of all, certain parts could only go into designated slots, meaning that kids couldn’t mix and match his facial features like they did before. It was almost like Barbie but with only one outfit!\n\nMr. Potato Head was given one more transformation in the eighties. He was now more tan colored, had rubber arms, a storage compartment in his rear end and most importantly, the pegs on the pieces and pre-drilled holes were all uniform so that any facial feature could be placed in any hole that the kid playing with him wished. This was the Mr. Potato Head that was here to stay.\n\nJust as potatoes were the staple crop of Ireland, Mr. Potato Head is a staple of toy chests all over the world and has managed to become a true American icon. He’s been featured in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, was the spokes spud for Burger King’s French fries for a time. On the more civic-minded note he gave up his pipe as part of the Great American Smoke out in 1987 while both he and his spouse helped the League of Women Voters launch their “Head to the Polls” campaign. Most significantly, he became a bonifide movie star when the late Don Rickles lent his voice to Mr. Potato Head for Toy Story and its two sequels. So move over Lon Chaney, Mr. Potato Head will always be the man with an infinite number of faces!\n\nX-BOX 360 (2005)\n\nThe year 2000 might not have been the greatest year in Bill Gates’ life. Oh, he was still the richest person in the world. His net worth at that time was estimated to be as much as $101 billion. Yet 2000 was the year that Microsoft was ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court to split into two different companies – one to manufacture software components and another to manufacture operating systems – following a landmark anti-trust case. It was also in this year that Gates stepped down as active CEO so that he and his wife Melinda could concentrate more on charity work (to date they’ve donated over $28 billion to various causes). Be that as it may, Microsoft was still a hugely profitable corporation and was perfectly able and willing to loose money on a certain project.\n\nIn 1998 a team was assembled to create a new video game console. At that time Nintendo was still a major player thanks to the Nintendo 64. Still, they had lost a good deal of their market share thanks to Sony’s PlayStation, a massive hit that was followed by the even more successful Play Station 2 (PS2). Sega, which had made a big splash in the late-eighties with their Sega Genesis system but stumbled big time with their Sega Saturn attempted to regain ground with their new Sega Dreamcast. Considered by many gamers to be ahead of its time, the Dreamcast was unique in that it included a built-in modem for on-line games. Alas, the Dreamcast was a commercial disappointment and when it ended production in 2001 Sega exited the home console market to concentrate entirely on game development.\n\nIt was into this crowded marketplace that Microsoft introduced the X-Box. A fairly bulky machine (unlike the sleek design of the Play Station) it was known for it’s Intel Pentium III processor and it’s built in Ethernet port for high-speed Internet connection and on-line gameplay. The first American made console since ATARI’s ill-fated Jaguar, the X-Box was introduced in November of 2001 in North America, later that February in Japan and later that march in Australia and Europe. The console did surprisingly well in the U.S, not so much overseas. X-Box live, an on-line gaming portal was introduced the following year, making it the first successful console/PC hybrid of the modern era. Yet the key to the X-Box success was the same as every successful console, killer games. With such smash its as Halo, Medal of Honor, Star Wars: The Old Republic and Project Gotham Racing, the X-Box became a must-have console for any hardcore gamer. Ultimately 24 million X-Boxes were sold in North America alone.\n\nOnce it was clear that Microsoft had a hit they went to work developing a second console. The new system had expanded on-line capabilities, allowing gamers to play “massive multiplayer games” with players all over the world. Players could also download games, purchase music and stream movies and TV shows. In short, the X-Box wasn’t just a game console, it was a home entertainment system!\n\nThe problem was that both Sony and Nintendo had new consoles in development – the PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Wii. Therefore Microsoft decided to do something that has pretty much always been a kamikaze mission in the gaming industry. They rushed the console into production so that it would beat its rivals to the punch.\n\nThe X-360 was first unveiled to the public on a TV special called Mtv Presents: The Next Generation of X-Box Revealed, hosted by Elijah Wood. Gamers had to wait until November to get their own console but once they went on sale they quickly sold out. By May they had already sold 5.5 million units, ultimately selling 84 million units worldwide. The first wave of X-Box 360’s did occasionally have tech problems, leading to the “red ring of death” that would light up around the power button. Later consoles manufactured fixed the glitch but otherwise the decision to release the 360 early was a resounding success. However….\n\nPLAYSTATION III (2006)\n\n…If Microsoft thought they could completely steal the PlayStation III’s thunder they were sorely mistaken. Its predecessor, the PlayStation 2, had by then become the best selling console in gaming history, a record it holds to this day with an estimated 155 million units sold worldwide. While there were plenty of people who had to have both, some PlayStation purists and budget conscious gamers passed on the X-Box 360 in favor of waiting for the PS3. The new system was the first on the market to run it’s software on Blu-ray disks, had 3-D capabilities, could connect with other gamers and download games via the PlayStation Network and could connect with the portable hand-held devices PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita.\n\nThe console went on sale in Japan on November 11th and in the U.S. one week later. That’s when all hell broke loose. There were reports of fistfights, people camping out to buy one getting robbed at gunpoint and at least one person being shot over a console. One particularly humorous story had a guy camping out in front of a toy store offering to buy coffee for the other campers. He returned with a cup of Joe for everyone who wanted one but didn’t tell them that he spiked the coffee with a laxative. When the other campers took care of nature he moved up in the line, talk about call of doody (sorry, couldn’t resist).\n\nSuccessful as the PS3 was, it didn’t quite sell as many as the X-Box, falling 200,000 units short of its sales figures. Perhaps even more surprising was the success of the Nintendo Wii which no doubt due to its kid friendly games and surprising popularity with the elderly went on to sell 101 million units! Oh well, Sony’s stock holders had no reason to be disappointed and the Tokyo based electronics giant continue to hold a dominant position in the gaming industry for the next decade.\n\nBARBIE (1959)\n\nWhile Barbie has for decades stirred the ire of feminists it’s worth noting that she is, in her own way, quite the trailblazer. Until she came along almost all dolls, whether homemade, handmade, or factory made were basically of babies and children. The idea behind them was that little girls dream about being mommies themselves one day and like to act out their matronly fantasies. While little girls to this day love to fantasize about motherhood they also look forward to the day when they can wear make-up, buy their own clothes and go out with boys but there were no dolls on the market to let them play out these fantasies. Well, no permanent dolls that is.\n\nRuth Handler, the wife of Mattel co-founder Elliot Handler, observed how much her daughter Barbara and her friends liked playing with paper dolls. They liked make believing that they were grown up and they liked having the dolls try on different outfits. Those outfits, of course, were single, two-dimensional cutouts of clothes that were fastened onto the paper doll with little tabs. Of course these were disposable toys only meant to be played with a few times. What if Mattel came up with a permanent doll that could let girls pretend to be young women? She discussed the idea with her husband but he was cool to it, as were the Mattel board of directors.\n\nSome time later the Handlers were visiting Switzerland. While there Mrs. Handler was introduced to Bild Lilli. Originally a comic strip seen in the West German magazine Bild, Lilli was a buxom blonde gold digger with the exaggerated measurements of a Russ Meyer heroine. A series of plastic dolls were produced and sold in adult bookstores to the male clientele. Handler was able to look beyond Lilli’s seedy qualities and saw the answer to what she was looking for – a plastic doll that girls could use to play dress up. She ultimately convinced Elliot to give her idea another shot. Mattel designed it’s own doll which greatly toned down some of Lilli’s more voluptuous qualities, particularly in her upper torso, and instead designed a more tasteful looking American teenager with interchangeable outfits and fake hair that girls could brush and style. When it came time to name the doll Handler decided to name it after her daughter Barbara, shortened to Barbie.\n\nMattel originally introduced both blonde and brunette Barbie’s in 1959, both dressed in zebra skin bathing suits. The toy company already advertised regularly on The Mickey Mouse Club and soon their Madison Avenue ad agency began producing TV spots starring this teen fashion model. The toy was an immediate smash hit, selling 350,000 dolls in its first year. The blonde dolls far outsold the brunettes and Barbie has been a blonde bombshell ever since (the brunette dolls are now huge collectors items).\n\nWhile the doll itself was a huge success, the entire toy line was based on the “razor and blades” business model put forth by King C. Gillette. That is that you don’t make your money off the razor but off the replacement blades. The whole point of Barbie was to dress her up in various outfits and so a whole line of clothing was put out for Barbie to wear, with new designs coming out nearly as often as Neiman Marcus gets a new shipments of haute couture from Italy. Two years later Barbie landed a hunk named Ken, her life-long beau. Other supporting characters introduced over the years including her little sister Skipper, her cousin Francie and her best friends Midge, Stacy and Christie. Barbie’s first dream house hit the market in 1962 and many play sets have followed, plus a whole assortment of automobiles and accessories. Barbie has come under fire from feminists over the years both for her materialism, her objectification and her measurements that many feel show an unrealistic and unhealthy body image for young girls. Yet the truth is that Barbie has had a number of careers over the years, starting with such gender specific occupations as teacher, nurse and airline stewardess then moving on to more glamorous jobs as ballerina, rock singer and fashion designer. She was also a business executive as early as 1960 (a nod to Ruth Handler no doubt. She rose to become president of Mattel) and later became an astronaut and was a presidential candidate on a number of occasions. By the 1980’s Mattel had adopted the empowering slogan “we girls can do anything, right Barbie?” They also largely abandoned the “razors and blades” model in favor of selling a whole range of Barbie’s in different outfits for different occasions, i.e. Malibu Barbie, Superstar Barbie, Princess Barbie, etc. (I remember when my own mother was trying to buy Barbie accessories for my sister and lamenting that the only good clothes came with the dolls). It’s now estimated that the average American girl owns at least four Barbie dolls.\n\nShe may have had her critics over the years but hardly any toys have remained so popular for so long. When it comes to babes in Toyland, Barbie is the queen of them all.\n\nSIDENOTE: When the first Toy Story film was released in 1995, Mattel refused to grant Pixar permission to use their prized fashion doll in the movie, leading to the character of Little Bo Peep instead. When the movie became a phenomenal box office success and was hailed as an instant masterpiece, Mattel understandably regretted their decision. Therefore when Toy Story 2 was produced they happily allowed Pixar to use their plastic princess, thus giving birth to Tour Guide Barbie. In Toy Story 3 a very metrosexual Ken doll, hilariously voiced by Michael Keaton, joined Woody and the gang and stole Barbie’s heart, along with her hairbrush.\n\nE.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL VIDEO GAME (1982)\n\n1982 was the year that moviegoers all over the world fell in love with E.T. the Extra Terrestrial, Steven Spielberg’s cinematic fable about a young boy named Elliot (Henry Thomas) who befriends an alien that was accidently left behind by his team of intergalactic explorers. A mind-boggling hit, E.T. grossed $359 million in North America and $619 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing film of all time, a record that would hold until Spielberg himself broke it with Jurassic Park eleven years later.\n\nThat same year video game giant ATARI was recording record profits. Founded by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, ATARI created the first commercially successful coin operated arcade game Pong in 1972. From there they went on to create a whole bunch of hugely popular arcade games including Asteroids, Tank, Breakout, Destroyer, Centipede and many others. In 1977 they released the ATARI 2600, the first successful home videogame console (originally known as the ATARI VCS). By 1982 over 8 million consoles had been sold. Warner Communications bought the company in 1976, primarily because ATARI was entering the personal computer market with the ATARI 800 and 400 home computer systems released in 1979. Though these computes enjoyed some success it was the video game division that was undeniably paying the bills.\n\nFor all of ATARI’S success there were a few cracks in their cybernetic plaster beginning to show. New systems like Mattel’s Intellivision and Colecovision, both of which boasted superior graphics were encroaching on ATARI’s market share. ATARI had more games but their quality seemed to be getting worse, not better, with each passing year. ATARI won an exclusive contract to create a homeport for the blockbuster hit Pac-Man but the game resulted in more migraines then fun. Still, ATARI was the giant of the industry and when they saw the success of E.T., not to mention the truckloads of dolls, lunch boxes, bed sheets and even chewable vitamins selling around the globe, ATARI decided to get on the E.T. mother ship.\n\nKnowing full well that Steven Spielberg was (and still is) a hard core gamer, Warner Communications Chairman Steve Ross offered Spielberg an unprecedented amount of money – reported to be between $20 and $25 million – for the exclusive rights to an E.T. videogame. He enthusiastically agreed and personally requested that Howard Scott Warshaw, the programmer behind such hits as Yars Revenge and even the Raiders of the Lost Ark arcade game, be brought in to create the game. He agreed but no doubt had second thoughts when he was told that he had to deliver the game by September 1st in order for the game to be developed in time for the holiday shopping season. Even in those primitive vector graphic days a game could take six months to a year to develop. Warshaw had to program E.T. in less then six weeks!\n\nWith the time constraint it was decided not to introduce the game in the arcade. Though a coin-op version was proposed it was going to have to wait. ATARI also decided not to create a version for their new 5200 console until the following year. The game would only be developed for the 2600. Warshaw did indeed deliver the game on time. In order to make the cartridges, ship them to stores and launch an ad campaign, ATARI decided to skip the usual market testing, a huge mistake.\n\nE.T. barely made it into stores in time for Black Friday. A beautiful commercial featuring eponymous alien as Santa Claus was produced in order to tantalize youngsters. According to some reports ATARI produced more E.T. videogame cartridges then there were consoles in American households. When the game came out it was absolutely panned by critics and kids who couldn’t wait to start playing the game come Christmas morning were treated to a spinach green screen, a little yellow avatar with a neck that extends being chased by guys in trench coats. All that really happened was that E.T. fell down holes looking for the pieces to his telephone to call his home planet, then floating up and getting out of the hole. “So there’s basically just a lot of falling down a hole and then extending my neck and floating out,” noted Conan O’Brien on the Clueless Gamer segment of his talk show. “This just simulates the cycles of depression.” That’s pretty much how the players felt who got game in their Christmas stocking and the parents who had to shell out the money to buy it. While an estimated 1.5 million cartridges were sold, enough to make E.T. one of ATARI’s best selling titles, as many as four million went unsold. Roughly 750,000 copies were rumored to have been buried in a New Mexican desert. In 2013 the rumor was confirmed when the site was dug up to for a construction project and a number of games were unearthed. All of this was documented in the 2014 documentary ATARI: Game Over.\n\nToday E.T. the videogame is frequently sited as the worst of all time, and is often seen as a major factor in the videogame market crash that happened the following year. Warner Communications sold ATARI in 1984. Though they continued to make consoles they never regained their momentum and it’s assets were sold off. Obviously though there was one guy who got a high score, and that was Spielberg. Despite the huge payday he received Warner CEO Steve Ross (who passed away in 1992) justified the sale because it prompted Spielberg to begin producing and/or directing movies for Warner Bros., including Gremlins, The Goonies and The Color Purple. Still, for one of the most beloved movies of all time to have one of the worst videogames ever is an irony that stings like a wasp. There’s no question though that for a brief moment E.T. was one of the most hyped Christmas gifts of all time.\n\nBEANIE BABIES (1998)\n\nThey were the cutest little things you ever saw, tiny little plush animal toys that can fit right in the palm of your hand. They came in a variety of bright, vibrant colors and their facial expressions conveyed a sense of love and longing that could melt even the hardest of hearts. Most significantly the toys were deliberately under stuffed, making them more flexible and playable then any other stuffed toy on the market. So who could ever imagine that this rainbow menagerie would unleash the uncontrollable green-eyed monster that lives in all of us and that they would bring out the worst in people?\n\nFrom the tulip craze that hit the Netherlands in the 1630’s to today’s virtual Bitcoin speculation there are certain commodities that enjoy a period of high command and heavy investment only to go bust over night. Or as they’re known in the world of finance, economic bubbles. Invest in something that has little to no intrinsic value but is terribly over valued and you can either make a quick buck or send you to the poorhouse when the bubble pops. All sorts of goods and products have caused bubbles but little plush toys were definitely a new one.\n\nThe father of those little animals was Ty Warner. A Chicago native who moved to California in hopes of starting an acting career only to end up as a salesman for the Dakin plush toy company. In 1986 he returned to Chicago and started up his own plush business called Ty, Inc. right in his own apartment. After selling various stuffed animals Warner came up with the idea for Beanie Babies. Because good quality plush toys were pretty pricey Warner wanted to create a toy that any kid could afford, something that could be bought for just $5.00 or, as Warner put it, “allowance money”. He created little animals made of colorful polyester that were stuffed with little plastic pellets rather then with cotton or nylon. Significantly, the toys were under stuffed so that they could be manipulated into a variety of poses. Most stuffed animals are in some kind of fixed pose but the beanies were regular contortionists. Critics claimed that they looked like psychedelic road kill but kids soon realized that they were fun to play with.\n\nIn 1993 Warner began selling his toys in the Chicago area. At first there were just nine of them with names like Legs the Frog, Spot the Dog and Patti the Platypus. Like most plush toys they had little tags on their hinny with the copyright information but they also had a “swing tag,” that is a heart-shaped paper tag affixed with a plastic string usually located on the animals ear or somewhere near their head. The swing tags gave the name of the critter and usually had a little poem about them. Sales were slow but they began to build momentum in 1994. In 1995 Ty, Inc. began selling the toys coast to coast. Yet rather then getting big box stores like Wal*Mart, Target or Toys “R” Us to carry them Warner distributed them to independent toy stores, specialty stores and gift shops. The reason was to create an aura around them and to market them as “collectables” rather then just “toys.” Kids loved the little guys and so did grown ups. Soon the little animals were a fixture on bedspreads and around office cubicles around the country.\n\nThen things got…weird. While more and more designs were added to the flock other beanies were “retired”. When news that certain beanies might not be available anymore, toy collectors scoured the stores looking for those particular animals. When they couldn’t find them they started turning to the Internet to see if any might be for sale. Soon a market developed for “rare” beanie babies, these could be retired designs or limited edition toys. For example in 1996 there was Garcia the bear, a little tie-dyed teddy made in honor of Grateful Dead front man Jerry Garcia who died the previous year. The bear was retired the following year and demand went up. Another was Princess the bear, put out in honor of Princess Diana following her death (the proceeds from this bear were donated to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund). They were rare because only twelve toys were allotted to each vendor. One of the most famous of them was Peanut, an elephant that was originally royal blue. When Ty Warner ordered that they be redesigned with light blue fabric the original Peanuts began selling for obscene amounts of money. Even a toy with an irregular swing tag became a collector’s item.\n\nWhat happened then was quite unbelievable. People began hording the toys thinking that they would be worth a fortune. Toys were sold on the Internet and some were asking – and for a while getting – three and sometimes four figures for each individual toy. The upstart on-line auction site eBay was all but jump started thanks to the Beanie Babies, which at one time constituted ten percent of the auction sites sales. By 1998 the Beanies were one of the hottest toys on the market but not as playthings – many children were forbidden from playing with them buy their market speculating parents – but as an investment. People stocked up on these things believing that their cache of Ty toys would buy them a new house or put their kids through college. Counterfeit Beanie Babies were soon also making the rounds on the web and in stores and Beanie Baby price guides were topping the New York Times bestseller list.\n\nSome people genuinely were getting rich off the pretend zoological marvels and they were Ty Warner and his employees. On December 12th of that year Warner threw a company Christmas party. “I’ve never been in a room with so many millionaires!” Warner chimed. And indeed it was true. To show his gratitude he presented his guests with a red Beanie Baby bear with a #1 stitched onto his belly to represent the companies overall sales in the industry. While some treasured the bear many others put it on eBay and padded their already robust bank balances.\n\nOf course it wasn’t going to last. Like baseball cards, comic books, works of art or precious gems, their value is predicated on how rare they were. With storage bins containing a virtual Noah’s Ark of Beanies in attics across America it was clear that Beanie Babies weren’t hard to come by. By 1999 demand for the toys dried up and Ty Warner announced that his company would stop making the little guys. By that time nobody much cared that all the toys were going to be retired since most avid collectors had indeed collected them all.\n\nThough Ty, Inc. only received $2.50, the wholesale price for each toy sold to retailers, Ty Warner was a billionaire by 2000 and has invested in a number of real estate ventures, including the Four Seasons Hotel in New York.\n\nMany people"
