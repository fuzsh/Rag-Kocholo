        "text": "Monthly Archives: May 2021\n\nPick your movie of the week: Bad Star Wars (June 6-12/21)\n\nAccording to ratings on IMDb, the following three are the worst rated Star Wars movies by movie watchers. You can pick which one you think is best or which you think is worst. For me, from least worst to worst would be 1) Phantom Menace, 2), Solo, 3) Attack of the Clones. But it’s not up to me. You choose, and may the force be with you…\n\nSTAR WARS: EPISODE I – THE PHANTOM MENACE (1999) Rated 6.5/10\n\nSTAR WARS: EPISODE II – ATTACK OF THE CLONES (2002) rated 6.5/10\n\nSOLO: A STAR WARS STORY (2018) rated 6.9/10\n\nActors From Around the World\n\nMost of us are well versed on who the most famous actors are from Canada and the US, but how about the rest of the world? Here are some actors and a couple of directors who are (arguably) the most famous from their respective countries. All but one were born in the country in question. If there is anyone I missed who should be on this, either because their country has no one attached to it or because they’re more famous than who I have there, please feel free to let me know.\n\nEurope\n\nYul Brynner (RUSSIA) — The King and I (1956); The Magnificent Seven (1960), the Ten Commandments (1956)\n\nJoonas Suotamo (FINLAND) — Famous for playing Chewbacca in Star Wars episodes 8, 9 (a double in 7) and in Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018)\n\nIngrid Bergman (SWEDEN) — Casablanca (1942), Gaslight (1944), Spellbound (1945)\n\nChristofer Hivju (NORWAY) — Most notable role is in Game of Thrones (2011), though he appears in many movies including After Earth (2013) and Force Majeure (2014)\n\nMads Mikkelsen (DENMARK) — The Hunt (2012), Rogue One (2016), Another Round (2020)\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch (ENGLAND) — Avengers franchise, The Imitation Game (2014), Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013)\n\nSean Connery (SCOTLAND) — The Untouchables (1987), Dr. No (1962) and many other great movies\n\nLiam Neeson (IRELAND) — Taken (2008), Schindler’s List (1993), and many other great movies\n\nMarion Cotillard (FRANCE) — La Vie En Rose (2007), Inception (2010), and many other great movies\n\nPenelope Cruz (SPAIN) — Nine (2009), Vanilla Sky (2001), Murder on the Orient Express (2017)\n\nChristoph Waltz (GERMANY) — Inglourious Basterds (2009), Django Unchained (2012), Spectre (2015)\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (AUSTRIA) — Do I really need to list any movies here??\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme (BELGIUM) — Bloodsport (1988), Double Impact (1991), Double Team (1997)\n\nSebastian Stan (ROMANIA) — Avengers and Captain America franchises, I, Tonya (2017), Logan Lucky (2017)\n\nMila Kunis (UKRAINE) — Black Swan (2010), The Spy Who Dumped Me (2018), Bad Moms (2016)\n\nSophia Loren (ITALY) — Two Women (1960), Marriage Italian Style (1964), Grumpier Old Men (1995)\n\nNia Vardalos (GREECE) — My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002)\n\nEva Gabor (HUNGARY) — Gigi (1958), The Rescuers (1977)\n\nAsia\n\nJackie Chan / Bruce Lee (HONG KONG) — Rush Hour (1998), Shanghai Noon (2000) and many other great movies / Enter the Dragon (1973), Fists of Fury (1972)\n\nYayan Ruhian (INDONESIA) — Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015)\n\nBong Joon Ho (SOUTH KOREA) — Director of Parasite I2019) and a lot of great Korean movies\n\nJet Li (CHINA) — Hero (2002), Fearless (2006), The Expendables (2010)\n\nAkira Kurosawa (JAPAN) — Director of Seven Samurai (1954), Yojimbo (1961), and other great Japanese movies\n\nMichelle Yeoh (MALAYSIA) — Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (2000), Crazy Rich Asians (2018)\n\nLou Diamond Phillips (PHILIPPINES) — La Bamba (1987), Young Guns (1988)\n\nDev Patel (INDIA) — Lion (2016), Slumdog Millionaire (2008)\n\nShaun Toub (IRAN) — Crash (2004), Iron Man (2008)\n\nVeronica Ngo (VIETNAM) — The Old Guard (2020), The Last Jedi (2017), Da 5 Bloods (2019)\n\nAfrica\n\nJean Reno (MOROCCO) — Léon: The Professional (1994), Ronin (1998), The Pink Panther (2006)\n\nLupita Nyong’o (KENYA) — Black Panther (2018), 12 Years a Slave (2013), Us (2019), and many other great movies\n\nClaudia Cardinale (TUNISIA) — Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), The Pink Panther (1963)\n\nHugo Weaving (NIGERIA) — The Matrix (1999), The Lord of the Rings franchise (2001-2003)\n\nDjimon Honsu (BENIN) — Blood Diamond (2006), Amistad (1997), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)\n\nOmar Sharif (EGYPT) — Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Doctor Zhivago (1965)\n\nBarkhad Abdi (SOMALIA) — Captain Phillips (2013)… Look at him.

However, I enjoy working on this blog. I find it relaxing and fun. So, perhaps I should invoke Captain Corelli in this week’s best quote: “…and for that I cannot apologize.”\n\nPick your movie of the week: Musical Instruments (May 30-June 5/21)\n\nHere’s a fun category. There aren’t too many movies that have the name of a musical instrument in the title, but I did find these three. Seen any of them? It’s voting time; which one should be our movie of the week?\n\nThe Piano (1993)\n\nCaptain Corelli’s Mandolin (2001)\n\nThe Red Violin (1998)\n\nChasing Amy\n\nTurns out Amy Adams is a much more interesting person than I had thought. Here are some things you may or may not have known about this outstanding actress:\n\nOnce when boarding a flight in Detroit headed for LA she found out that there was an American soldier also booked on the flight. She had a first class ticket while he had coach. She privately requested to switch seats with him as a gesture of appreciation to the US troops.\n\nAccording to IMDb her ancestry is mainly English, though she has “smaller amounts” of Danish, Swiss-German, Norwegian, Welsh, German, Irish, Scottish, and Scots-Irish/Northern Irish. That and she grew up in Colorado. Oh, and she was born in Italy.\n\nShe’s been with the same man for the past 20 years, Darren Le Gallo. They met in an acting class, started dating, got engaged in 2008, and have an 11-year-old daughter, Aviana Olea.\n\nShe revealed in a red carpet interview one year that she suffers from a terrible stage fright.\n\nShe did all her own singing in Enchanted (2007), The Muppets (2011), and Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day (2007). I don’t remember seeing her dance in any of her movies, but she is a trained dancer, too.\n\nShe grew up in a Mormon family. She doesn’t share the beliefs today, though she says it influenced her values. Unfortunately she also often struggles with unnecessary guilt from time to time as a result as well.\n\nShe acted in two movies with Meryl Streep, and they were back to back: Doubt (2008) and Julie and Julia (2009). Somewhere during that time Streep taught her how to knit.\n\nHave you ever gotten Amy Adams confused with Isla Fisher? If so, you’re not alone. Fisher’s husband, Sacha Baron Cohen, is a constant prankster. One year when the family sent out Christmas cards to friends and family, he pasted Amy Adams’ face over his wife’s. The card read, “Season Greetings from Sacha, Isla and the Kids.” And apparently no one noticed!\n\nMost of us recognize Enchanted as her breakthrough film, and it really was. But her role in Junebug (2005) was the one that got her there. You may not have seen that one (I haven’t…), but her performance got everyone’s attention. It was an unassuming low budget movie, but Adams’ performance stole the show, and earned her an Oscar nomination that year.\n\nShe has starred in five films nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. She has also been nominated for an Oscar 6 times for her acting. And the longest she’s gone without an acting nomination since 2006 is 5 years.\n\nDespite this, she has definitely been snubbed by the Academy. There are only 8 actors who have been denied an Oscar nomination while being nominated by the Golden Globes, BAFTA, SAG, and Critic’s Choice Awards for the same role. Amy is one of them, for her role in Arrival (2016).\n\nShe’s had some pretty deep existential crises when attending those Oscar ceremonies. One time she was sitting between Meryl Streep and Sean Penn and thought to herself, “What am I doing here? I don’t belong here!” And then there was the year she was singing at the ceremony. She said in an interview that it was nerve-wracking to be singing in front of billions of people, noting that this included Daniel Day-Lewis and Cate Blanchett. Her solution that night was to go to Taco Bell. Mexican food, she declared, heals her.\n\nHer best friend is her former co-star in Sunshine Cleaning (2008), Emily Blunt.\n\nShe and Leonardo DiCaprio played teenage lovers in Catch Me If You Can (2002), which is interesting for two reasons: 1) they were both 28 at the time, and 2) she had a crush on him for a short time as a teenager when seeing him playing a small role on the TV show Growing Pains.\n\nCongratulations Amy Adams and Arrival. This is your week.\n\nAnd the Oscar goes to…\n\nBest Actress: Other than Amy, can anyone argue that Meryl Streep would be our best actress this week for her role as Julia Childs in Julie and Julia?\n\nBest Actor: Jeremy Renner as Ian Donnelly in Arrival\n\nBest Quote: “Do you think poisoned apples grow on trees?” — Susan Sarandon as Queen Narissa in Enchanted.\n\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, what you all have been eagerly waiting for…\n\nMy top 10 favourite Amy Adams movies:\n\nNocturnal Animals (2016)\n\nDoubt (2008)\n\nJulie and Julia (2009)\n\nAmerican Hustle (2013)\n\nThe Muppets (2011)\n\nTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006)\n\nThe Master (2012)\n\nHer (2013)\n\nArrival (2016)\n\nThe Fighter (2013)\n\nPick your movie of the week: Amy Adams (May 23-29/21)\n\nI just watched The Woman in the Window (2021) on Netflix and thought this would be a great time to celebrate the great actress Amy Adams. She’s been in a lot of great ones, 3 of which you can choose from to be our movie of the week:\n\nEnchanted (2007)\n\nJulie & Julia (2009)\n\nArrival (2016)\n\nIf Canada Changed Its Flag\n\nRemember in 2017 when we celebrated Canada being 150 years old? During that time some of the Indigenous people of our country said they would refrain from the festivities because they didn’t see this country as being that young. They argued that 150 years just marks an anniversary of a year that something was made official: that this land was no longer theirs. It must seem ironic to hear the national anthems words “our home and native land.”\n\nThis got me thinking that year… Would it bother me if a declaration was made that from now on as a country we would continue to celebrate our country, but not confederation? And in that vein, what if more things were changed, things that I often equate with Canadian identity? Would I mind if our flag was changed or replaced entirely? Would I mind if the House of Commons was made up of 20% white Anglophones and Francophones, the rest made up of Indigenous and immigrated nationalities?\n\nAs a teenager I had a Canadian flag hanging on my bedroom wall. As an adult I lived in a foreign land as a missionary for 4 years: the United States (Trying to convert the savages there wasn’t easy!). Everyone there knew I was Canadian because I constantly told them about how great our country is. To this day, whenever I experience a sickness, accident, or some unfortunate event (like, say, a global pandemic), one of my first thoughts is, “This sucks, but I’m sure glad I’m going through this here in Canada.”\n\nI’ve always seen myself as a proud Canadian. But I’m not tied to anything a group of entitled people who were fortunate enough to win a war declare as Canadian, especially if there was any trace of inhumanity in their actions. It is the land and the people in it that matter to me.\n\nIf we grew as a people and recognized our diversity, true history, and true identity to the point that we changed our flag, our official language(s), our observances, and the content of our history books, I think I would be totally ok with that. We are Canada. No blind patriotism, just true patriot love.\n\n——-\n\nOur nominees this week represented the Maritime provinces, the best part of Canada. In writing this post I am hoping that news of our existence gets leaked to Ontario!\n\nCongratulations Two If by Sea. This is your week.\n\nAnd the Oscar goes to…\n\nBest Actress: Of course, it’s gotta be Sandra Bullock as Roz in Two If by Sea\n\nBest Actor: Of course, it’s gotta be Daniel Day-Lewis as Jack Slavin in The Ballad of Jack and Rose\n\nBest Quote: “You can’t start a bonfire and then say night night.” — William Hurt as James Leads in Children of a Lesser God.\n\nFun facts:\n\nIt was on the set of Two If by Sea that Sandra Bullock discovered she was allergic to horses.\n\nChildren of a Lesser God was the first major motion picture to cast a deaf / hearing-impaired person in a major role since 1926’s You’d Be Surprised. It was also the first film directed by a woman (Randa Haines) to be nominated for the best picture Oscar.\n\nI don’t have anything interesting about The Ballad of Jack and Rose, so here’s one on Anne of Green Gables (1985). Did you know that Megan Follows’s mother played the orphanage director, Mrs. Cadbury? Also, the actress who played Marilla Cuthbert, Colleen Dewhurst, grew up on Prince Edward Island.\n\nPick your movie of the week: Filmed in the Maritimes (May 16-22/21)\n\nI suppose you could vote for the movie that was set in your home province, your favourite province, which movie you’d like to see most, or one of the movies you already like. Here are the nominees…\n\nChildren of a Lesser God (1986)\n\nLOCATION: Saint John, NB; Rothesay Netherwood School\n\nPLOT DESCRIPTION: A new speech teacher at a school for the deaf falls in love with the janitor, a deaf woman speechless by choice.\n\nTwo If by Sea (1996)\n\nLOCATION: Mahone Bay, Lunenburg, NS\n\nPLOT DESCRIPTION: A couple steals a Matisse painting on contract. They manage to escape the police. The sale takes place 4 days later on an island. Things don’t go as planned.\n\nThe Ballad of Jack and Rose(2005)\n\nLOCATION: Rock Barra, PE\n\nPLOT DESCRIPTION: A father and daughter isolated on an island off the East Coast and living on a once-thriving commune grapple with the limits of family and sexuality.\n\nAnimated Movies that Could Have Won\n\n2001’s Shrek has the distinction of being the first movie to receive the “Best Animated Feature” Academy Award. Up to that point, only animated shorts won Oscars, which seems crazy. Classics like The Little Mermaid (1989) and Bambi (1942) could win in categories like music, but The Wrong Trousers (1993) and The Crunch Bird (1971) would get the recognition of being the best of the year.\n\nSo I thought this would be fun: If the Oscars had “best animated feature award” from 1939 and on, here’s who I think would win each year…\n\nNOTE: Obviously this was difficult for some years. So keep these in mind: 1) An asterisk (*) indicates that the movie listed is either a short film, a part of an “animated package” of short films, or was a TV special. I would put these there if they were ones I had watched and loved as a kid, and therefore decided to throw in there for that reason. 2) “NQ” means “none qualify.” For those I years I didn’t recognize any movies and/or didn’t see anything else I wanted to highlight.\n\nOk, enough… Here’s how I think it could have gone down:\n\n1939 – Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n\n1940 – Pinocchio\n\n1941 – Dumbo\n\n1942 – Bambi\n\n1943 – NQ\n\n1944 – The Three Caballeros*\n\n1945 – NQ\n\n1946 – Song of the South (I have not seen this obviously, but I think it’s a safe choice that it would have won that year.)\n\n1947 – Fun and Fancy Free*\n\n1948 – NQ\n\n1949 – NQ\n\n1950 – Cinderella\n\n1951 – Alice in Wonderland\n\n1952 – Pluto’s Christmas Tree*\n\n1953 – Peter Pan\n\n1954 – Animal Farm – I haven’t seen it, but I recognize it and considering its subject is a classic novel, surely it would win.\n\n1955 – Lady and the Tramp\n\n1956 – NQ\n\n1957 – What’s Opera, Doc?*\n\n1958 – NQ\n\n1959 – Sleeping Beauty\n\n1960 – NQ\n\n1961 – 101 Dalmatians\n\n1962 – Mr. Magoo’s Christmas Carol*\n\n1963 – The Sword in the Stone\n\n1964 – Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer*\n\n1965 – Les Aventures des Schtroumpfs (Belgium; translation: The Adventures of the Smurfs)\n\n1966 – How the Grinch Stole Christmas*\n\n1967 – The Jungle Book\n\n1968 – Yellow Submarine\n\n1969 – Tintin and the Temple of the Sun (Belgium/France/Switzerland)\n\n1970 – The Aristocats\n\n1971 – The Cat in the Hat*\n\n1972 – War of the Monsters (South Korea) – Haven’t seen it, but the description and info on leads me to this decision.\n\n1973 – Robin Hood\n\n1974 – The Year Without a Santa Claus*\n\n1975 – NQ\n\n1976 – The Smurfs and the Magic Flute (Belgium/France)\n\n1977 – The Rescuers\n\n1978 – Watership Down\n\n1979 – The Bug Bunny/Road Runner Movie\n\n1980 – Yogi’s First Christmas\n\n1981 – The Fox and the Hound\n\n1982 – The Secret of NIMH\n\n1983 – Mickey’s Christmas Carol*\n\n1984 – Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (Japan)\n\n1985 – The Black Cauldron\n\n1986 – An American Tail\n\n1987 – The Brave Little Toaster (A close 2nd: The Wind in the Willows)\n\n1988 – Grave of the Fireflies\n\n1989 – The Little Mermaid\n\n1990 – The Rescuers Down Under\n\n1991 – Beauty and the Beast\n\n1992 – Aladdin\n\n1993 – The Nightmare Before Christmas\n\n1994 – The Lion King\n\n1995 – Toy Story\n\n1996 – James and the Giant Peach\n\n1997 – Hercules (A close 2nd: Princess Mononoke)\n\n1998 – The Prince of Egypt (A close 2nd: A Bug’s Life)\n\n1999 – Toy Story 2 (A close 2nd: The Iron Giant)\n\n2000 – The Emperor’s New Groove\n\nCongratulations Shrek. This is your week.\n\nAnd the Oscar goes to…\n\nBest Actress: Cameron Diaz as Fiona in the Shrek franchise\n\nBest Actor: John Leguizamo as Sid the Sloth in the Ice Age Franchise\n\nBest Quote: “He’s so fluffy I’m gonna die!” — Elsie Fisher as Agnes in Dispicable Me\n\nAnd if I was to choose a greatest animated movie of the 20th century, I would pick The Lion King. Admittedly it would be hard to argue against Pinocchio and Toy Story.\n\nPick your movie of the week: Non-Disney Animated Franchise (May 9-15/21)\n\nThis week we are actually choosing a franchise. So even though we have the first of each series of movies listed, you can vote for the computer animated franchise that you think is best outside of Disney.\n\nShrek (2001)\n\nIce Age (2002)\n\nMadagascar (2005)\n\nDespicable Me (2010)\n\n5 Years Later: Was Oscar So White?\n\nFive to six years ago people of colour in the entertainment business began to protest that there was not enough representation in the Academy Awards. What sparked this was that for two consecutive years the Academy gave all 20 acting nomination slots to white actors. In the entertainment world, many were expecting at least Will Smith to be nominated for Concussion (2015), but wasn’t. The protest was called #OscarSoWhite, and most of us with lighter skin were feeling skeptical of it. I mean, the awards should be based on who the best actors were and not on skin colour, right? But then something happened after the 2016 Oscars.\n\n13th, Moonlight, Straight Out of Compton, Birth of a Nation, Fences, I am Not Your Negro, Get Out, Mudbound, If Beale Street Could Talk, BlacKkKlansman, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Dolemite is My Name, Black Panther, Antebellum, The United States vs Billie Holliday, One Night in Miami, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom and many others. All having either a cast predominantly made up of persons of colour, a focus on culture or issues pertaining to people of colour, or both. They are all also movies that have received both critical and commercial acclaim. So this means that any of the following has happened:\n\nHollywood is forcing it. The argument here is that the movie industry buckled under the pressure of actors of colour. They wanted to be relevant and prove they are not racists and made these movies with these cast members, passing on other scripts and casts. BUT: So many directors, producers, actors, and critics have expressed admiration for these films. And before we argue that those very people are Hollywood, the same can be said of regular ol’ movie goers. I’ve seen all but one of the movies listed above, and I can’t say I loved them all, of course. But I can say that collectively they are as good as any other stack of movies that have received Oscar nominations throughout the past decade. I mean, it’s honestly an impressive list of films. You have to wonder: Were these all forced on us by Hollywood, and by coincidence there just happens to be a significant amount of them that are good enough to get the recognition they get? Or… was Oscar really so white? Were the protesters right and are these films the proof?\n\nIt’s just happening naturally. We’ve always had significant movies like this. Consider The Help (2011), Do the Right Thing (1989), Precious (2009), Remember the Titans (2000), The Color Purple (1985), Glory (1989), and many others. They were always movies like this being made, and every decade sees more than the previous. We’ve naturally grown into our diversity. However… again… isn’t this a rather large coincidence that this natural growth seemed to take such a significant jump right after 2016’s #OscarSoWhite? I mean, it’s hard to find any two decades in the past that together can even compete with the last 5 years.\n\n#OscarSoWhtie was right. You’ve likely guessed that this is how I see it. No, the actors and directors of colour were not asking to be awarded based on their skin colour. They were simply wanting to not be overlooked or counted out because of it. They could see the systemic racism that was happening. This was not intended to take anything away from the white actors and actresses who’d been nomination recipients in the past. They were all deserving. No one is taking anything away from them. But if people are being overlooked because of their colour, even if it’s subconscious, then we’re getting neither a fair nor accurate picture of the achievements from of each year.\n\nI have to admit here that it does feel weird making these arguments. I feel like a privileged white guy “whitesplaining” a movement led by people of colour in an industry I know so little about. And I might just be that. But I can honestly say that I am only trying to share what I have observed as a movie fan and what I sincerely think/feel/believe is happening. As I’ve shared before, trying to understand other people’s perspectives is a strongly held value of mine. We cannot adequately love one another without adequately understanding one another.\n\nCongratulations In the Heat of the Night. This is your week.\n\nAnd the Oscar goes to…\n\nBest Actress: Natalie Wood as Maria in West Side Story.\n\nBest Actor: Sidney Poitier as Virgil Tibbs in In the Heat of the Night.\n\nBest Quote: “They call me Mr. Tibbs!” — Sidney Poitier as Virgil Tibbs in In the Heat of the Night.\n\nJust a reminder, I would still love to see any of you take the 2 Movie Challenge. 🙂"
