When he finally gets his chance, the production is closed by Gallicos cruel manager, who wants a rival magician to perform Gallicos greatest trick, The Lady and the Buzz Saw. An enraged Gallico turns into a homicidal maniac, taking out his victims with the same methods he used to create his illusions.\n\nFor more about The Mad Magician 3D and the The Mad Magician 3D Blu-ray release, see the The Mad Magician 3D Blu-ray Review published by Dr. Svet Atanasov on October 19, 2020 where this Blu-ray release scored 3.5 out of 5.\n\nDirector: John Brahm\n\nWriter: Crane Wilbur\n\nStarring: Vincent Price, Mary Murphy, Eva Gabor, John Emery, Donald Randolph, Lenita Lane\n\nProducer: Bryan Foy\n\n» See full cast & crew\n\nThe Mad Magician 3D Blu-ray Review\n\nReviewed by Dr. Svet Atanasov, October 19, 2020\n\nJohn Brahm's \"The Mad Magician\" (1954) arrives on Blu-ray courtesy of Indicator/Powerhouse Films. The supplemental features on the disc include vintage promotional materials for the film; new audio commentary by author and critic Kevin Lyons and critic Jonathan Rigby; new program featuring archivist Frank Passingham and cinematographer Tom Vincent; short films; and more. In English, with optional English SDH subtitles for the main feature. Region-Free.\n\nIn the United States, The Mad Magician was initially released on Blu-ray by Twilight Time. For an in-depth analysis of the film, please see Jeff Kauffman's review of the release here.\n\nThe Mad Magician 3D Blu-ray, Video Quality\n\nPresented in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, encoded with MPEG-4 AVC and granted a 1080p transfer, The Mad Magician arrives on Blu-ray courtesy of Indicator/Powerhouse Films.\n\nThe release is sourced from a ore-existing 2K master that was supplied by Sony Pictures. It features a standard 2D presentation of the film as well as a 3D presentation of the film.\n\nEven though there are some obvious limitations, I like the technical presentation quite a lot. For example, the grain exposure does not have the smooth consistency and evenness that a new 4K master would have delivered, but delineation and depth are still quite nice. The darker footage where more subtle nuances usually become problematic on older masters also looks good. There are no traces of problematic digital work. The grading job is convincing. Perhaps there are a few areas where the blacks could have been managed a bit better to preserve more shadow nuances, but I don't see a problem with the current appearance of the visuals. Image stability is excellent. Density could be better, but even on a very large screen the film still has solid organic appearance.\n\nThe 3D presentation is something of a mixed bag. Dimensionality in particular looks very dated and inconsistent and the actual 3D effects that are supposed to leave a lasting impression seem mismanaged to me. Clarity also fluctuates quite a lot. On other hand, it is entirely unrealistic to expect the film to deliver hugely impressive 3D effects because of technology limitations. So, the 3D version is a decent 'bonus', but as far as I am concerned it does not make or break the film. (Note: This is a Region-Free Blu-ray release. Therefore, you will be able to play it on your player regardless of your geographical location).\n\nThe Mad Magician 3D Blu-ray, Audio Quality\n\nThere is only one standard audio track on this Blu-ray release: English DTS-HD Master Audio 1.0. Optional English SDH subtitles are provided for the main feature.\n\nThe lossless track is very healthy. On my system clarity, sharpness, and depth were all as good as I expected them to be. Balance was excellent as well. I had the volume turned up quite a bit and did not detect any weaknesses in the upper register, such as distortions or hiss.\n\nThe Mad Magician 3D Blu-ray, Special Features and Extras\n\nCommentary - in this new audio commentary, author and critic Kevin Lyons and critic Jonathan Rigby discuss the stylistic appearance of The Mad Magician, the mechanics of some of the magic tricks that are seen in the film as well as the 3D visuals, the personality and make-up of Vincent Price's impostor, some of the odd decisions that different characters make throughout the film, Eva Gabor's performance and career, the \"new\" finger-printing technology that is highlighted the film, etc.\n\nThree-Dimensional Magic - in this new program, archivist Frank Passingham and cinematographer Tom Vincent explain why and how The Mad Magician came to exist, and discuss the evolution of the 3D technology and its application in cinema, the production of 3D films in Hollywood, etc. In English, not subtitled. (15 min, 1080p).\n\nSuper 8 Version One - an archival silent Super 8 version of The Mad Magician which can be viewed with 3D anaglyph glasses. In English, with printed subtitles. (9 min, 1080p).\n\nSuper 8 Version Two - an archival Super 8 version of The Mad Magician which can be viewed with 3D anaglyph glasses. In English, with optional subtitles. (17 min, 1080p).\n\nTrailer - a vintage trailer for The Mad Magician. In English, with optional subtitles. (3 min, 1080p).\n\nImage Gallery - a large gallery with vintage promotional materials for The Mad Magician. (1080p).\n\nShort Films -\n\n1. Spooks! (1953). The three stooges become private detectives. Directed by Jules White. In English, with optional English subtitles. (16 min, 1080p).\n\n2. Pardon My Backfire (1953). Another short with the threes stooges featuring very early pseudo 3D effects. Directed by Jules White. In English, with optional English subtitles. (16 min, 1080p).\n\nBooklet - 40-page illustrated booklet with a new essay by Kat Ellinger, a look at the career of producer Bryan Foy, an archival interview with director John Brahm by David Del Valle, a guide to the promotional campaign of The Mad Magician, an overview of contemporary critical responses, Jeff Billington on the Three Stooges' 3D shorts, and film credits.\n\nThe Mad Magician 3D Blu-ray, Overall Score and Recommendation\n\nThe Mad Magician was conceived to replicate the success of House of Wax but it is a pretty underwhelming film. It could have been quite exciting if Vincent Price played a legitimately vile character and there were a few curve balls to surprise the audience, but the screenplay that was handed to John Brahm must have been very average. If you still wish to add The Mad Magician to your library, this release from Indicator/Powerhouse Films should be on your radar. It comes with a decent price tag and is Region-Free.\n\nThe Mad Magician: Other Editions\n\n3D\n\n1-disc\n\n£9.99\n\nSimilar titles you might also like\n\nWhat is this?\n\nUse the thumbs up and thumbs down icons to agree or disagree that the title is similar to The Mad Magician.
