        "text": "had this to say:\n\nAnother great story. What a wonderful life you've had! I was thinking about the \"Gertrude\" thing. Maybe it is Hungarian for \"dresser girl.\"\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 12:43:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nGerturde, oh excuse me, Naomi....she really was a beautiful woman. I liked watching her as the farmers wife, in Green Ackers.....How old is she now? I can't imagine ironing satin and all those delicate fabrics...I probably would have burned at least one dress....What memories you have there....It must have been a dream working in that theater.\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 1:18:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nOh, Gertrude (LOL)!!! What a wonderful - truly, truly wonderful journey you have had!! This is such a delighful story, and what I would have given to have been in your shoes!! Miss Gabor!! And LILIAN GISH - one of the most luminescent of screen legends - to have even breathed in the same space as her - do you know how lucky you are??!! Yes, I am aware I sound a little stagestruck, but honestly...it's just all such amazing stuff!!! :) The closest I ever came was spending my school work experience assigment at Sydney's Ensemble Theatre - oh, such magic to be part of the theatre (even if it was just as a gopher!!) - and I was only 15 at the time, so you can imagine how amazing it was to me - but nothing like working in actual summer stock alongside such legends, as you did!!! I love reading these reminisences - thanks so much for sharing!!!\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 2:42:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nI want your memory cells! lol.. I don't know how you manage to remember soooo much!\n\nBoy.. I'm glad you had it all straightened out or you would have been going crazy working for the Gabors! It must be hard having someone to do EVERYTHING for you.. (sarcastic heh)\n\nohhh Naomi! Lillian Gish! How I loved her movies! I think one of her last movies was The Whales of August which I have on vhs and absolutely love!! Now she's and autograph I wish I had!!\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 3:38:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nShe was soooooo beautiful! I remember seeing her on Johnny Carson and Merv Griffin (didn't he date her?), as well as Zsa Zsa. Was the other sister named Magda? I remember that name associated with them.\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 6:07:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nGreat story. I do love these nostalgia pieces. But I'm on the edge of my seat over here... was she, or wasn't she a real blonde? I guess you should've counted yourself lucky she wasn't having you washing her panties (YUCK!).\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 6:23:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nI always tell my husband about your posts. You have led the most exciting and remarkable life.\n\nI guess I have to end up thinking that Eva was kinda cheap. She could have given you a very nice gift instead of costume jewelry. It is the thought that counts: she didn't give it thought.\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 7:28:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nLove the picture of the 3 sisters...is that Zsa Zsa doing the Hawaiian sign? Looks so out of place back then, so common now!\n\nThat brooch is lovely, but as you say...not something the average 19 year old would like LOL!\n\nOne of the women I work with wore a lovely brooch to work last week, and I asked her if I could photograph it (http://tinyurl.com/296j5x)\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 8:13:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nWhat great stories you tell!! I always thought Magda was the most beautiful but we never heard much about her. Of course I caught up with Eva on Green Acres.\n\nMy mother used to talk about the Gish sisters. She said one of them had the most beautiful hands but I can't remember now if it was Lillian or Dorothy.\n\nTheir films still show up from time to time.\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 9:10:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nOh this is so amazing....and this is not a story, this is real from you Naomi aka Gerturde.\n\nAs I scrolled down to read your post I imagine travelling back to your time standing next to you seeing your frantic look as you do the ironing....handling the dress with care etc ...etc...\n\nAbsolutely a beautiful memory and Eva Gabor, I've seen her classic movie...very very nice :D\n\nYou are amazing, I love your life experiences, have a nice day Naomi...I'm heading to your country soon in Nov :D\n\nHave a wonderful weekend!\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 9:38:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nNaomi, I just LOVED this memory of yours. I laughed out loud at McIver saying \"Naomi Gertrude Hirshhorn, it's half hour!\"\n\nI always liked Eva. And I had no idea their mother owned a jewelry store. That piece is prong-set, which usually means it's higher quality (even for costume jewelry). What a fun story!\n\n~S\n\n~S :)\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 1:03:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nhave such wonderful stories to tell. I think Naomi is a much nicer name than Gertrude! Here from Michele's today.\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 1:41:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nOhh Naomi, this is another treasure of a story from the movie history. Reading through and listen to the story through your telling is just amazing. You have so much wonderful things to share and I feel honored to be among the readers who have found you my dear blogger friend!\n\nOf course I remember Greta Garbo and no wonder she called you a common Swede name Gertrude. Its quite a common name in Norway too and very popular in the 50s.\n\nBtw: since you have not mention it: I'm glad you are fine despite the fire storms around in your area. I was worried about you, you know!\n\nWishing you a wonderful end to your week :-)\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 2:32:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nHello, Naomi, Michele sent me to say that this was a wonderful story! It just boggles my mind that you met and worked with all these wonderful people that I've seen or heard about all my life.\n\nThe Gabor sisters truly were beautiful - and they certainly seems to have very glamourous lives...but then so did you...\n\nYour stories are wonderful and I love them...\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 3:55:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nWhat wonderful stories about people we've all watched, fascinated!\n\nThanks for sharing, Naomi!\n\nN.\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 4:55:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nHi Naomi!! I loved reading this!! She sure did expect a lot didn't she?? I would have been scared to iron those things too. Goodness!!!\n\nYou spoke of a past post you did back in 1784!! LOL I know it's a typo dear, but I did LOL when I read it!! That would make you pretty old now!!\n\nOh your life has been so fascinating and you write so well.\n\nI mostly recall Ms. Gabor from Green Acres, where she played as such a silly person, but she is really pretty.\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 5:30:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nSo far, this is my favorite of your non-family, non-garden stories. :)\n\nYou shall, forever more, be crowned \"Gertrude\", LOL. On the bright side, at least she didn't call you Blanche.\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 5:53:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nOh Naomi! I loved this post!! Wonderful, wonderful. You remember the fine details which I love.\n\nIts good you held onto that brooch and never gave it away, even if you never wore it.\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 7:39:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nYou went from making me despise her to making me love her. What a wonderful story!\n\nFriday, October 26, 2007 at 7:59:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nOh my dear, the life of an aprentice back stage - which for many people would be a dream - but it's hard work and also a kind of slavery: You have to do what should be expected \"the star\" should do by his/her own. I know it;D\n\nI'm overwhelmed by your honesty in this post. And, I could \"hear\" your voice when reading it.\n\nbtw. Call you soon from Miami.\n\nhugs from\n\nVikingland\n\nSaturday, October 27, 2007 at 12:35:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nOh Naomi! Deep sigh. Melvyn Douglas and George Brent - they were so cool.\n\nI always thought the Gabor girls a touch autocratic but you obviously charmed Eva. They certainly were a good-looking bunch. What experiences you have had and it's great you share them with us.\n\nSaturday, October 27, 2007 at 12:47:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nHi Naomi, we read your comments left on Lind's Blog referring to the award and would just like to say thank you very much for YOUR comments about our Blog!! Now we have found your Blog and wow, what a thoroughly fascinating read! You have an extraordinary memory and a magical way with words! Miss Gabor, she was so Hollywwod Glamour, adored her wardrobe, what a job! Nice brooch though truly! Thank you for sharing this wondeful post! Jenn and Jacqui\n\nSaturday, October 27, 2007 at 8:40:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nthank you, thank you, thank you for such a wonderful (and wonderfully written) story. i love the theatre and all that goes along with it, so i adore back stories.\n\nmementos are such a treasure, wether real or costume, that pin is a treasure. in fact, i've been looking for something similar to attach to my jeans jacket. i love flashy mixed with denim.\n\nyour blog reminds me of all the stories my grandma used to tell. i wish i had tape recored her. she was an authentic flapper, born in 1900 and a bit of american history was lost when she died. thanks for writing down your american history.\n\nSaturday, October 27, 2007 at 8:50:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nI just love reading all your stories and seeing the wonderful pictures. Each one is priceless and you really have led an interesting life!\n\nYour photography is spectacular also -- beautiful nature shots that could be published.\n\nThanks for sharing so much.\n\nSaturday, October 27, 2007 at 1:40:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nWhat a great story and interesting experience, Gerty! :)\n\nDid you ever have the pin appraised? I'd be curious to see what it was worth.\n\nSaturday, October 27, 2007 at 2:50:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nOH, GERTY! Are you ever going to live this down for sharing that great story with us? LOL Nah....you're NOT a Gertrude in the least. A definite Naomi! (I've always loved that name, by the way)\n\nI was mesmerized reading this account. It was super, and I felt like I was reading the first chapter of a wonderful memoir and I want MORE!\n\nI smiled and giggled all the way through it, Naomi. You made it all so personal and real. Thanks for sharing. I really enjoyed it!\n\nSaturday, October 27, 2007 at 3:17:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nThis was the best story EVER!!! Oh my god... she sounds like the Dianne Wiest character in \"Bullets Over Broadway\".\n\nI remember the Concord, too. Now I have to see if it still exists.\n\nHope you're having a good week, Gertie. ;)\n\nSaturday, October 27, 2007 at 3:40:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nWhat a funny story!\n\nWow, she had some work done, huh? The Gabor sisters were the early pioneers of extensive plastic surgery though, weren't they?\n\nSaturday, October 27, 2007 at 5:26:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nWhat a fun story!! Gertrude just doesn't fit you at all, but I sure like the story behind it. Naomi suits you much better.\n\nYou never did tell us if she was a real blonde or not.\n\nI'm thinking she had a little help from a bottle.\n\nThat pin would look good on the lapel of a coat, but I agree with you that it was not a gift that a young woman would have worn. It's a wonderful keepsake!\n\nNow, I'm off to read your previous post...\n\nSaturday, October 27, 2007 at 9:34:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nSuch fine entertainment for my morning coffee!!! I know \"you look clean\" (lol) but Gertrude...was the name of Mr Mar's aunt, who was call Tante Trude, it's a very old-fashioned German name!\n\nI can fully understand your \"ironing fear\", I would feel the same way if I had to iron somebody else's anything (except for maybe a T-shirt!) and you know my teen years are very far away, lol.\n\nThe brooch looks very nice (not for a young girl, though!), I have never had one!\n\nIt seems the Gabor sisters have been around all my life...I normally only remember Zsa-Zsa...\n\nSaturday, October 27, 2007 at 11:14:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nThat was an amazing story with which to start my day. Thank you for taking the time to write it down.\n\nI like Garbo's second-to-last movie, also with Melvyn Douglas: Ninotchka. (Garbo Laughs!)\n\nSunday, October 28, 2007 at 6:30:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nWhat a charming story! You're a natural born storyteller!\n\nSunday, October 28, 2007 at 6:50:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nI had no idea when spending time with you last night that I was actually spending time with a \"Gertrude\". My goodness! :)\n\nSunday, October 28, 2007 at 8:59:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nGertrude! LOL! I wonder if all her dressers were Gertrude?\n\nThis is such a wonderful story, and it reminds me so much of working backstage. I remember so much having to take down sets after the last show. That would be such a long day after doing two shows as we wouldn't stop until the show was down. There were times as well when we would go straight through the night to the next day and start putting the next show in. Boy did we get dirty so I know exactly what Ms Gabor menat! LOL!\n\nI love that you kept the pin she gave you. It's great to have these little keepsakes.\n\nSunday, October 28, 2007 at 10:11:00 AM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nYou have some of the coolest stories! I am always amazed by who you know and what you've done. This was so interesting. I just loved reading it. I was always fascinated by the Gabors and all their glamour. Eva was considered the nice one and Zsa Zsa the mean one right? And I loved Green Acres, I had no idea she had done so many projects! Great story!\n\nSunday, October 28, 2007 at 3:45:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nSunday, October 28, 2007 at 4:02:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nWhat famous people you knew! All I remember about he was in Green Acres!\n\nOur own Robert Goulet died today, made a fabulous star with Camelot. I still love his singing on that album!\n\nWednesday, October 31, 2007 at 7:01:00 PM PDT\n\nhad this to say:\n\nThis must have been before I discovered you. A wonderful story and maybe her calling out Gertrude was her way of remembering a private joke between you.\n\nFriday, June 17, 2011 at 1:44:00 AM PDT"
