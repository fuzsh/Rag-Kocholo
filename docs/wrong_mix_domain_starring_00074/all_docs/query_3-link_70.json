        "text": "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is off to a disappointing start at the US box office, bringing in $32m (£25m) over the long Memorial Day weekend.\n\nIts takings make it the lowest box office figures for the holiday weekend since Casper debuted to $22.5m (£17.6m) in 1995.\n\nFuriosa only narrowly beat its closest competitor, The Garfield Movie, which made $31.1m (£24.3m).\n\nThe figures for the 2024 weekend were significantly down from 2023, when Disney's The Little Mermaid brought in $118m (£92.4m).\n\nThe fifth film in the Mad Max series is a prequel, starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth.\n\nIt also stars Tom Burke and Alyla Browne and is set about 20 years before Fury Road, and fans see Furiosa go from early childhood to becoming a warrior.\n\nThe film, which cost $168m (£131m) to produce, was projected to make around $40m (£31m) over the four-day weekend in the US.\n\nAt the international box office, Furiosa brought in $33.3m (£26m) from 75 territories over the weekend, bringing its worldwide total to $58.9m (£46.1m)\n\nThe franchise's previous 2015 film, Mad Max: Fury Road starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron earned $65m (£51m) when it opened.\n\nPremiering out of competition at Cannes, Furiosa received a six-minute standing ovation but it has received mixed reviews from critics with comments varying from “soul-pricklingly primal” to “all spectacle and no vision”."
