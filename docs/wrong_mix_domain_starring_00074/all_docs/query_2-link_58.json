        "text": "15. THE DAY OF THE DOLPHIN (1973)\n\nDirected by Mike Nichols. Screenplay by Buck Henry, based on the novel by Robert Merle. Starring George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, Paul Sorvino, Fritz Weaver, Severn Darden, Edward Herrmann.\n\nBy far the silliest film Scott ever starred in, which is saying a lot for the man who made “Dr. Strangelove.” Directed by Mike Nichols from Robert Merle’s bestselling novel, “The Day of the Dolphin” centers on a marine biologist (Scott) teaching dolphins to communicate in English. He soon learns these super-intelligent mammals are being used by the government in a sinister plot to assassinate the president! Nichols and Scott do their best to take this goofy material seriously, and perhaps that’s the problem: they’re just too thoughtful to create the kind of B-movie this story demands. Listen closely for screenwriter Buck Henry as the talking dolphins.\n\n14. MOVIE MOVIE (1978)\n\nDirected by Stanley Donen. Written by Larry Gelbart and Sheldon Keller. Starring George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, Red Buttons, Eli Wallach, Barry Bostwick, Harry Hamlin, Barbara Harris.\n\nA noble attempt to recreate a typical 1930s double bill, Stanley Donen’s “Movie Movie” succeeds on pure nostalgia alone. Scott earned a Golden Globe bid as Best Comedy/Musical Actor for his dual role in both short features. In the first, “Dynamite Hands,” he plays a crooked boxing manager who takes advantage of an aspiring lawyer (Harry Hamlin) who jumps in the ring to pay for his sister’s eye operation. The second, “Baxter’s Beauties of 1933,” casts him as a legendary Broadway producer who decides to mount one last production before he dies, enlisting a young ingenue (Rebecca York) to replace his drunken star (Trish Van Devere).\n\n13. THE FLIM-FLAM MAN (1967)\n\nDirected by Irvin Kershner. Screenplay by William Rose, based on the novel ‘The Ballad of the Flim-Flam Man’ by Guy Owen. Starring George C. Scott, Sue Lyon, Michael Sarrazin, Harry Morgan, Jack Albertson, Alice Ghostley, Albert Salmi, Slim Pickens.\n\nThere’s a sucker born every minute, or at least that’s what professional conman Mordecai C. Jones (Scott) seems to believe. A self-professed M.B.S., C.S., D.D. — Master of Back-Stabbing, Cork-Screwing and Dirty-Dealing — Jones travels through the American South fleecing unsuspecting people through any means possible. During his travels he teams up with a young Army defector (Michael Sarrazin), and together they rip off the local townspeople while a beautiful blonde (Sue Lyons) protects them from the suspecting town sheriff (Harry Morgan). Scott excels in a rare comedic role, aided by makeup that makes him look decades older.\n\n12. TAPS (1981)\n\nDirected by Harold Becker. Screenplay by Robert Mark Kamen, James Lineberger and Darryl Ponicsan, based on the novel ‘Father Sky’ by Devery Freman. Starring George C. Scott, Timothy Hutton, Ronny Cox, Sean Penn, Tom Cruise, Giancarlo Esposito.\n\nHaving won (and refused) the Oscar for “Patton,” Scott strapped on his military uniform once again for Harold Becker’s “Taps,” headlining what would retroactively become an all star cast. He plays General Harlan Bache, commander at an elite academy for aspiring cadets, including Timothy Hutton, Sean Penn (in his movie debut), Tom Cruise and Giancarlo Esposito. When a greedy real estate development company threatens to demolish the school to make room for condominiums, the students take drastic measures to ensure it remains open, arming themselves with superior weaponry and preparing for battle against the invading enemy.\n\n11. ISLANDS IN THE STREAM (1977)\n\nDirected by Franklin J. Schaffner. Screenplay by Denne Bart Petitclerc, based on the novel by Ernest Hemingway. Starring George C. Scott, David Hemmings, Gilbert Roland, Claire Bloom.\n\nAdapted from Ernest Hemingway’s unfinished, posthumously published novel, “Islands in the Stream” casts Scott as a man remarkably similar to the late author: bearded, burly and boozing sculpture Thomas Hudson, who lives in an isolated Caribbean paradise. As World War II looms in the distance, he’s visited by his three sons (Hart Bochner, Brad Savage and Michael-James Wixted) and his ex-wife (Claire Bloom), who bring with them the demons of his past. Later, he attempts to save refugees from the Nazis with the help of his drunken friend (David Hemmings), a boat captain (Julius Harris) and a hooker with a heart of gold (Susan Tyrell).\n\n10. THE CHANGELING (1980)\n\nDirected by Peter Medak. Screenplay by William Gray and Diana Maddox, story by Russell Hunter. Starring George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, Melvyn Douglas, John Colicos, Jean Marsh, Helen Burns, Madeleine Sherwood.\n\nOne of several supernatural thrillers released after the success of “The Exorcist,” “The Changeling” finds a prominent composer (Scott) retreating to a secluded vacation home after the death of his wife and daughter in a freak traffic accident. But he’s not alone in the vast, sprawling mansion, as the ghost of a young child haunts its gloomy hallways. Desperate to be rid of the spirit, he enlists the help of an agent from the local historical society (Trish Van Devere) who sold him the house. Though director Peter Medak keeps things gloomy and spooky, it’s Scott’s performance as a grief stricken widower that truly frightens us.\n\n9. THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER (1990)\n\nDirected by Hendel Butoy and Mike Gabriel. Screenplay by Jim Cox, Karey Kirkpatrick, Byron Simpson and Joe Ranft, based on characters created by Margery Sharp. Starring Bob Newhart, Eva Gabor, John Candy, Adam Ryen, George C. Scott, Tristan Rogers.\n\nScott leant his gruff, gravely voice to the villainous poacher Percival C. McLeach in this high-spirited sequel to Disney’s animated classic. In the Australian Outback, young Cody (voiced by Adam Ryen) befriends the golden eagle Marahute, vowing to protect her and her nest of eggs. But he soon falls prey to McLeach, who wants to sell the bird and her offspring for millions. It’s up to the intrepid mouse team of Bernard and Miss Bianca (voiced by Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor) to rescue the young boy and his fowl friend. Beautifully animated with stunning aerial sequences, “The Rescuers Down Under” is a fitting followup to its cartoon predecessor.\n\n8. PETULIA (1968)\n\nDirected by Richard Lester. Screenplay by Lawrence B. Marcus, story by Barbara Turner, based on the novel ‘Me and the Arch Kook Petulia’ by John Haase. Starring Julie Christie, George C. Scott, Richard Chamberlain, Arthur Hill, Shirley Knight, Joseph Cotten.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine Sofia Coppola’s “Lost in Translation” without this intimate character study as a spiritual predecessor. “Petulia” casts Scott as a physician reeling from a recent divorce from his wife (Shirley Knight). He befriends a newlywed socialite (Julie Christie) who’s desperately unhappy with her abusive husband (Richard Chamberlain). Director Richard Lester satirizes American materialism by creating an eerily sterile, static world for his characters to inhabit. At the same time, he elicits heartbreakingly nuanced performances from his actors, who can’t find happiness despite having everything in the world they could possibly want.\n\n7. ANATOMY OF A MURDER (1959)\n\nDirected by Otto Preminger. Screenplay by Wendell Mayes, based on the novel by Robert Traver. Starring James Stewart, Lee Remick, Ben Gazzara, Arthur O’Connell, Eve Arden, Kathryn Grant, George C. Scott.\n\n“Anatomy of a Murder” caused a stir when it was released in 1959 for its explicit, envelope-pushing discussions of sexual violence, and while it’s not as shocking today as it was back then, Otto Preminger’s film remains an engrossing and enthralling legal thriller. James Stewart stars as an easy-going, cocksure attorney defending an army lieutenant (Ben Gazzara) who murdered a bar owner he believes raped his wife (Lee Remick). Scott earned his first Oscar nomination for his supporting turn as the fiery prosecutor going head-to-head with him in the courtroom. (He contended against costar Arthur O’Connell as Stewart’s drunken colleague.)\n\n6. THE HUSTLER (1961)\n\nDirected by Robert Rossen. Screenplay by Sidney Carroll and Robert Rossen, based on the novel by Walter Trevis. Starring Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie, George C. Scott, Murray Hamilton.\n\nThough it’s Paul Newman who dominates our memories of “The Hustler,” there’s a wealth of stellar supporting turns propping the actor up in what would be his definitive role. The 1961 classic finds talented yet arrogant pool shark “Fast” Eddie Felson (Newman) challenging billiards champion Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) to a high-stakes game. Along the way, he falls in love with a drunken writer (Piper Laurie) and comes under the spell of a grifter (Scott) who promises to help him crack the big time. Scott competed against Gleason at the Oscars in Best Supporting Actor, although he refused the nomination, objecting to the very idea of it.\n\n5. HARDCORE (1979)\n\nWritten and directed by Paul Schrader. Starring George C. Scott, Peter Boyle, Season Hubley, Dick Sargent.\n\n“Hardcore” is another descent into hell from Paul Schrader, that patron saint of the alienated man. This time, it’s centered on Jake VanDorn (Scott), a devoutly Calvinist businessman whose daughter disappears while on a church trip to California. He hires a private detective (Peter Boyle) to track her down, and he finds her in an 8mm porno movie, forcing Jake to leave his Grand Rapids home for the seedy underworld of Los Angeles. Yet while he’s repulsed by what he sees, he’s oddly attracted to it as well, and Scott plays this dynamic powerfully. It all culminates in a “Taxi Driver”-esque bloodbath, with the hero again using violence as a purifier.\n\n4. THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS (1971)\n\nDirected by Anthony Harvey. Written by James Goldman. Starring George C. Scott, Joanne Woodward, Jack Gilford, Rue McClanahan.\n\nGeorge C. Scott portrays a prosperous judge who believes he’s Sherlock Holmes. Is he crazy? His brother wants to lock him up in an asylum so he can take his fortune, but first the brother needs a justifying medical diagnosis by a woman (Joanne Woodward) whose name is, of all things, Dr. Watson. When Holmes insists upon a chance to prove his identity, Watson agrees to join him on a whacky adventure across Manhattan at night that reveals true lunacy and, ultimately, true love between the sleuths. “Giants” is a cleverly penned, heartfelt comedy brought to the screen by the director, writer and music composer team of “The Lion in Winter,” who pull off another cinematic masterwork.\n\n3. THE HOSPITAL (1971)\n\nDirected by Arthur Hiller. Written by Paddy Chayefsky. Starring George C. Scott, Diana Rigg, Barnard Hughes, Richard A. Dysart, Stephen Elliott, Andrew Duncan, Donald Harron, Nancy Marchand.\n\nBefore he turned his poisoned pen towards the media in “Network,” Paddy Chayefsky took satirical aim at our health care system in “The Hospital.” Scott gives one of his best performances as Dr. Bock, Chief of Staff at a highly dysfunctional medical center. As a murderer stalks the halls, killing both the patients and the staff, Dr. Bock contemplates his own suicide before a mysterious young woman (Diana Rigg) enters his life. The film brought Scott an Oscar bid in Best Actor, just one year after he had refused the same award for “Patton.” Chayefsky won a prize for his screenplay, which is expertly mounted by Arthur Hiller.\n\n2. DR. STRANGELOVE OR; HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB (1964)\n\nDirected by Stanley Kubrick. Screenplay by Stanley Kubrick, Terry Southern and Peter George, based on George’s novel ‘Red Alert.’ Starring Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens, Peter Bull, James Earl Jones, Tracy Reed, Shane Rimmer.\n\nOnly Stanley Kubrick could’ve taken the threat of nuclear annihilation and turned it into one of the funniest comedies ever made. “Dr. Strangelove” gleefully mocks the paranoid hysteria that gipped our nation throughout the Cold War, taking for its target the inept leaders with their finger on the button. Though Peter Sellers is the headliner in a triple role as Col. Mandrake, President Muffley and the titular German scientist, Scott steals every scene he’s in as Gen. Buck Turgidson, the pot-bellied, rubbery-faced military adviser to the Commander in Chief. It’s a feat of comedic acting that proves sometimes the edict of less is more is woefully inaccurate.\n\n1. PATTON (1970)\n\nDirected by Franklin J. Schaffner. Screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North, based on the books ‘Patton: Ordeal and Triumph’ by Ladislas Farago and ‘A Soldier’s Story’ by Omar N. Bradley. Starring George C. Scott, Karl Malden, Michael Bates, Edward Binns.\n\nAlthough he famously refused it, there’s no denying that Scott deserved the Best Actor Oscar for his fiery, larger-than-life performance as General George S. Patton. As directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and written by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North (all three won Oscars, as did the film for Best Picture), “Patton” follows the controversial military man throughout his many escapades in North Africa during World War II. Scott dominates its three hour runtime, starting with his famous opening speech in front of a giant American flag. It’s a mesmerizing tour-de-force that anchors one of Hollywood’s most psychologically complex war epics."
