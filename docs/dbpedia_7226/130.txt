Luca Maestri, Apple senior vice president and chief financial officer, is definitely getting noticed for his contributions to the company.

In a new survey of more than 300 c-level executives at major companies across the country, Maestri was named the best CFO in the United States. The survey was commissioned by Model N and fielded by Innovate US.

Almost one-quarter of the respondents, 24 percent, gave the title to Maestri. Walmart’s Charles Holley was second with 11 percent while Ford’s Bob Shanks garnered 8 percent of the vote.

More than half of the executives who named Maestri as the best U.S. CFO cited Apple’s unrivaled performance as the top reason for nominating him.

Just a week ago, Apple announced its monster earnings report for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, which included the all important holiday shopping season. During the period, Apple made $74.6 billion in revenue and a profit of $18 billion.

Along with being the best quarter ever for the company, the huge profit was the best ever for any company in corporate history. That’s pretty amazing, even taking into account the massive run Apple has been on.

And to absolutely no one’s surprise, the iPhone was the star of the show. During the quarter, Apple sold 74.5 million handsets. That equals out to 34,491 iPhone sold every single hour during the time frame.

In a recent filing with the SEC, Apple noted that Maestri made $14 million in 2014. That’s a nice chunk of change, to say the least, but definitely worth it for Apple.
