More than half of the execs cited the company’s performance as their primary reason for nominating the CFO.\n\nThe survey also highlighted the importance C-level exec attach to the role of CFO: nearly all (94%) have said that being a CFO is one of the most important positions in companies today, because “managing financial risks of the corporation is more important than ever”."
