And we’ll talk more about it in the coming weeks. I think there are numerous ways there that are great for us. And we think that we’re well-positioned.”\n\nMark Gurman for Bloomberg News:\n\n‎\n\nA lack of innovative new devices has contributed to slow sales at Apple, but the company looks to begin rectifying that on May 7. That’s when it plans to unveil new iPads — the first updates to its tablet line in 1 1/2 years.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company also is planning a long-awaited push into generative artificial intelligence. In June, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is expected to lay out Apple’s AI strategy at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.\n\nCook said Thursday that Apple will stand out from its AI rivals by tightly integrating hardware and software, using in-house chips, and making privacy and security a priority…\n\nApple is planning to release its first Macs with M4 processors later this year, adding a fresh focus on AI capabilities, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nSupport MacDailyNews at no extra cost to you by using this link to shop at Amazon.\n\n‎\n\nMacDailyNews Take: In his opening remarks during Thursday’s conference call, Cook said, “We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in Generative AI. We are making significant investments, and we’re looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon. We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple’s unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple’s silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create.”\n\nCook, when answering an analyst’s question, followed up, “I don’t want to get in front of our announcements, obviously. I would just say that we see Generative AI as a very key opportunity across our products. And we believe that we have advantages that set us apart there.”\n\n‎\n\nPlease help support MacDailyNews.
