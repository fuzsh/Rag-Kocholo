That has been a mission of Apple since it was founded.\n\nWhen it comes to marketing, there is very little which is invented. As Mick Jagger of the Stones poignantly summarized, \"There is no future in rock 'n roll music; it is all only recycled past.\" There's probably some mystical reference from Stevie Nicks and \"Landslide\" somewhere in Jobs Genius.\n\nSteve Jobs' marketing genius was seeing the brilliance of Nike, a shoe company, in showcasing star athletes of the 80s, such as Michael Jordan, John McEnroe, and Lester Hayes, and slapping Nike's logo next to them. Nike knew psychology would take over, and take over it did.\n\nHonor great athletes. That stuck in Jobs' head.\n\nThis was the core and the essence of the \"Think Different\" ad campaign.\n\nJobs' did the same, but instead of star athletes, he created sexy products and used psychology to build an \"elite brand.\" He knew Apple would be wildly successful with just 5% of the market share.\n\nHe was right.\n\nWhere companies go wrong is when they attempt to convince their audience that they are the right product for them. Jobs points to the dairy industry as an example of how they tried for 20 years to convince the country that milk was good for them. \"It's a lie, but they tried,\" quipped Jobs.\n\nBut then they came out with the \"Got Milk?\" campaign, and it wasn't about the product; it was about the absence of the product, but they used stars, just like Nike, but with milk mustaches, and the sales of milk skyrocketed.\n\nBack to Nike, have you ever seen a Nike commercial where they discussed why their product was better than Reebok? Ever seen a detailed analysis of their shoe technology and how it will help you run faster or play better? Of course not. Instead, Nike's ad honors great athletes and great athletic accomplishments. This is where Jobs felt advertising professionals got it wrong.\n\nThe company was in disarray when Jobs returned to Apple, even with a large advertising budget. Jobs stripped the \"core value\" of the company, which was to help people do their jobs better with the box that Apple made, to one, people who use Apple products have a passion for making the world better.\n\nThe core of it, and what Jobs ultimately believes, are the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are often the ones that do.\n\nThis was a key moment in Jobs's return to Apple and the first brand marketing campaign with him back in the saddle; he envisioned a campaign that would leave a lasting impression. While many things changed at Apple while he was gone, he wanted to return to Apple's roots and core values. But values and core values, those things shouldn't change. Those nine words set the stage for something the world wasn't quite prepared for, as Apple was about to make an epic comeback.\n\nBut never forget to look beyond the marketing because while Apple and Nike's public \"core values\" may be very different, internally, they are the same: Make Lots of Money with Cheap Overseas Labor. After all, this is a very complicated and noisy world we live in.\n\nIn 1997, Jobs addressed his thousands of employees and said, \"Marketing is about values. This is a very complicated world; it's a clamorous world. And we won't get the chance to get people to remember much about us. No company is. So we must be clear on what we want them to know about us.\"\n\nOne new marketing strategy Jobs drilled into the campus in Palo Alto was, \"Don't market products, market dreams.\" This was a vital shift in the Apple brand. When it came time to launch the campaign, Jobs had to swirl in his head with images of Picasso, Einstein, and many other \"world changers\" - Jobs knew they were often quoted, disagreed with, loved, and hated. Still, he also knew the only thing people could not do was ignore them, as they were game changers and world changers. He even dared to refer to these brilliant minds as \"the crazy ones,\" and it worked to perfection.\n\nBefore going live with the \"Think Differently\" campaign, Jobs was torn about which version to use. One with Jobs doing the voiceover, or one with Richard Dreyfus. Both were sent to the network, and the decision was made in the final hour. The Dreyfus version, which was the correct choice, was chosen. Jobs' vision is genius, but the power of his voice is not. It takes a natural leader to recognize that you don't always possess that which is best.\n\nMore on Steve Jobs\n\nWhat Did Steve Jobs Sell To Start Apple?\n\nIn 1975, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak joined and worked out of Jobs' parent's garage. They needed $1,350 in capital to start Apple, so Jobs decided to sell his VW Microbus, and Wozniak parted with his HP calculator.\n\nDid Michael Fassbender Do A Good Job Portraying Steve Jobs?\n\nMany critics and audiences felt that Michael Fassbender did an excellent job portraying Steve Jobs in the 2015 biopic of the same name. Fassbender received widespread praise for his performance, with many highlighting his ability to capture Jobs' charisma, intensity, and contradictions. The performance was considered one of the standout elements of the film, and Fassbender was widely recognized for his commitment and dedication to the role.\n\nSteve Jobs Marketing - \"The Man In The Machine\" is a documentary film directed by Alex Gibney, released in 2015.

Some key aspects of Apple's distribution strategy during Jobs' tenure include:\n\nSelective Distribution: Apple employed a selective distribution model, working with a limited number of authorized resellers and carriers. This strategy helped maintain control over the retail experience, ensuring that Apple products were always displayed and marketed according to the company's high standards.\n\nApple Retail Stores: In 2001, Apple opened its first retail store, an innovative move that allowed the company to control every aspect of the customer experience, from product demonstrations to sales and after-sales support. Apple stores were designed to be visually appealing and inviting, focusing on hands-on product interaction and knowledgeable staff. This retail strategy contributed significantly to Apple's brand image and customer loyalty.\n\nOnline Sales: Apple was an early adopter of online sales, launching the Apple Online Store in 1997. This platform allowed customers to purchase products directly from the company, ensuring a seamless and consistent buying experience. The online store also provided a platform for pre-orders and product reservations, adding to the exclusivity around new releases.\n\nExclusive Carrier Partnerships: In the early years of the iPhone, Apple struck exclusive deals with carriers in various markets, such as the agreement with AT&T in the United States. These partnerships helped create a sense of exclusivity around the iPhone and allowed Apple to maintain control over the customer experience, including pricing and service plans.\n\nStrategic Global Expansion: Apple carefully expanded its distribution network, targeting key markets and regions to maximize sales potential.

By partnering with reliable suppliers and investing in advanced logistics systems, Apple minimized stock shortages and maximized customer satisfaction.\n\nVertical Integration: Apple's distribution strategy was closely linked to its vertically integrated business model, which included designing, manufacturing, and selling its products.

This approach played a significant role in the company's growth and contributed to the strong brand image and customer loyalty that Apple enjoys today.\n\nHow Did Jobs Convince John Sculley to be the CEO of Apple?\n\nIt was \"Classic Steve.\" At the time, Sculley was the President of Pepsi-Cola and was comfortable with his position, and Pepsi has been performing well in sales. Jobs wanted Sculley, so he just went for the throat: \"Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling flavored sugar water, or would you rather change the world with me?\" Seeing it put in that light, there was no way Sculley could turn Jobs down.\n\nApple had never done anything this massive before. When someone mentioned to Steve Jobs that the iPhone would be more significant than the Mac, Steve just said, \"I know.\" How did Jobs know? Simple. Everywhere he went, two things were certain. 1) Everyone had a mobile phone; 2) Everyone complained about it. He knew Apple could build something better. It was the only product that would catapult Apple to altitudes even Jobs couldn't envision.\n\nThe iPod was responsible for about half of Apple's revenue when the iPhone was discussed as a possible product. Â In a meeting of the iPod team, one of the concerns for possible future loss of market share and revenue is \"What if cell phones also could play MP3s.\" This was when they knew the iPhone also had to include an integrated iPod player. The problem was, getting the \"phone interface\" to work with the iPod \"wheel\" that was so popular and did not have the device look and operate like the rotary phone, which would have been a death sentence for the invention.\n\nInstead, Jobs suggested to the design team to take the technology they were working on for the new Apple product (a tablet, which would become the iPad) and shrink it down to allow for a multi-touch experience, including a keyboard. Since the most popular device was The Blackberry with its hard keyboard, Apple went the soft route and included scrolling and the famous \"rubber band bounce,\" signifying you were at the end of the page. Apple believed this move would liken the experience to reading a book and engage the user without losing the nostalgic feeling of an actual book or another medium.\n\nAs the project was coming together, Jobs feared the teams would inadvertently leak information outside the walls of the Apple Complex about the iPhone (code-named The Purple Project), and the press would spoil the announcement. Jobs wanted to dazzle the world; the only way to do that was to keep the public in the dark. So Jobs put up posters all around the office about \"Fight Club\" and modified the posters to read, \"The First Rule of the Purple Project is Not Talk About the Purple Project.\"\n\nIt was written numerous times that Apple employees under Jobs's watch were like members of a religious community, nearly cult-like, with Jobs as their worshipped guru, and the Apple customers were the loyal followers of his vision that Jobs would change the world.Â\n\nOn January 7, 2007, the secret remained within the walls of Apple when Jobs took the stage for the announcement.\n\nAnd from the Sculley hiring, the line \"Do you want to spend your life selling sugar water or...\" was used repeatedly by employees in meetings, emails, internal presentations, etc. It became the \"go-to\" trolling statement, and according to former employees, surprisingly, it never got old.\n\nThe Dark Side of Steve Jobs\n\nFrom the time he berated an older woman for her \"skill\" at making Jobs a smoothie at Whole Foods to telling a top Xerox employee, \"Everything you've ever done is shit,\" Steve Jobs is not wildly known for the \"Good Steve,\" as the \"Bad Steve\" and his often unpredictable personality traits received the bulk of the press.\n\nOther: Steve Jobs Marketing Strategy |\n\nSee Also: Muhammad Ali Record - The Greatest Boxer of All-Time\n\nLee Kuan Yew - Singapore's Great Prime Minister and Leader"
