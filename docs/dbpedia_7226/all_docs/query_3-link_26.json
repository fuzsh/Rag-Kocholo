        "text": "On Friday, Apple reached a major milestone in its history, celebrating 40 years since it was founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.\n\nIt was a long road to becoming one of the world's biggest tech names, nearly reaching the edge of a financial collapse before Jobs returned to save the company and launch its most important products.\n\nOn Apple's 40th birthday, we look back at the 40 biggest moments in company history:\n\n1. April 1, 1976: Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak form Apple.\n\nWhile hanging out together as part of the Homebrew Computer Club, the two friends formed Apple from Jobs' garage. \"We first met during my college years, while he was in high school,\" Wozniak said in a 2007 interview with ABC News. \"It was 1971 when a friend said, you should meet Steve Jobs, because he likes electronics and he also plays pranks. So he introduced us.\"\n\n2. The Apple I computer is born.\n\nJobs and Wozniak create their first device: the Apple I computer. It sold for $666.66. Only 200 Apple I computers were built, making it a collector's item. Last year, a model sold for $200,000.\n\n3. The Apple II arrives one year later.\n\nThe duo's second attempt at creating a personal computer was far more successful. The device is credited with helping to spark a revolution in personal computers for the home.\n\n4. The Beatles vs. Apple.\n\nThe legendary band's record label, Apple Corp, sued Apple Computer over its use of the apple logo and name. Both sides reached a settlement where Apple Computer agreed to only use its name in the tech business, while Apple Corp stuck to music. Both sides would squabble over the trademark multiple times before finally settling for good in 2006.\n\n5. Apple goes public.\n\nShares of Apple began trading on Dec. 12, 1980, opening at $22 a share. On that day, Apple boasted a market cap of $1.2 billion. Today, it's above $600 billion.\n\n6. Wozniak takes a leave of absence.\n\nApple's co-founder stepped away from the company following a plane crash in 1981 leaving him seriously injured. Wozniak briefly returned to Apple, but left for good in 1985.\n\n7. John Sculley takes over.\n\nLured by Jobs, the former PepsiCo executive joined Apple as its next CEO. When he started in 1983, Apple was worth $800 million. When he left the company 10 years later, Apple was worth $8 billion. Sculley recounts the pitch Jobs presented during the PBS series The Triumph of the Nerds: The Rise of Accidental Empires. \"He looked up at me and just stared at me with the stare that only Steve Jobs has and he said do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or do you want to come with me and change the world,\" said Sculley. \"I just gulped because I knew I would wonder for the rest of my life what I would have missed.\"\n\n8. The first Mac is unveiled.\n\nSay farewell to typing in commands. The next line of Apple computers was arguably among the most important, introducing key concepts still in use today including a graphical user interface, where users interact with the computer through a selection of on-screen icons.\n\n9. The 1984 ad.\n\nAired during Super Bowl XVIII, the TV commercial used clips of dystopian film \"1984\" to introduce the line of Macintosh computers.\n\n10. Jobs leaves Apple.\n\nThe man Jobs recruited as Apple's next CEO would ultimately push the co-founder out. John Sculley helped organize a boardroom coup in 1985, and Jobs would go on to start another computer company called NeXT.\n\n11. Apple sues Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Apple for $5.5 billion claimed Microsoft's newly-launched Windows operating system and HP's New Wave copied the \"look and feel\" of the graphical user interface available on the Macintosh. Most of the claims were tossed by a federal judge in a ruling in April 1992.\n\n12. The first Powerbook arrives.\n\nApple takes the leap into portable computing with its first laptop. The line would later be replaced by the MacBook.\n\n13. The Newton bombs.\n\nWay, way, way before the iPhone came the Newton, Apple's personal digital assistant. It boasted a killer feature — handwriting recognition -- that never seemed to work, and that generated plenty of ridicule.\n\nThe device was immediately shelved after the return of Jobs, or as Wired puts it in a 2013 piece: \"The Newton wasn’t just killed, it was violently murdered, dragged into a closet by its hair and kicked to death in its youth by one of technology’s great men.\"\n\n14. Apple acquires NeXT.\n\nAlso known as the moment Steve Jobs returned to Apple. The co-founder's software firm is scooped up by Apple for $400 million. Jobs was appointed an adviser, reporting to CEO Gil Amelio.\n\n15. Jobs becomes Apple’s interim CEO.\n\nJobs is named to the top role at Apple on a temporary basis while the company searches for a replacement for Amelio, ousted in 1997. During a radio interview, Amelio supported Jobs' return even after his departure, according to a 1997 CNet report. \"I told him, 'Steve, I'll never be as charismatic as you are, and you'll never be as good of an operating manager as I am. You can't run a corporation...by just being cool,'\" said Amelio.\n\n16. The iMac debuts.\n\nWhile still serving on an interim basis, Jobs unveils the iMac desktop computer, a model that remains a part of Apple's lineup today. The iMacs boasting colorful displays were soon replaced by flat displays.\n\nThe reveal of the iMac was one of Jobs' first event appearances since taking over at Apple.\n\n17. Jobs interim no longer.\n\nApple's co-founder formally takes the company's top role, kicking off what would be one of its most successful runs in tech.\n\n18. Apple's first retail store opens.\n\nThe tech giant reveals in 2001 it will open 25 stores, with the first two arriving in Glendale, Calif., and McLean, Va. The stores introduced the Genius Bar, where Apple owners get support for their computers. Apple now boasts hundreds of stores in the U.S. alone.\n\n19. Apple introduces iPod.\n\nOh, this portable music player was only the device pushing Apple toward an epic financial rebound. Did I mention it also changed the way we buy music? Yeah, not a big deal at all. It also produced some classic ads.\n\n20. iTunes launches.\n\nWait, you don't need to buy CDs any more to enjoy music? Awesome. It also meant CD owners had to spend hours importing collections into a digital format.\n\n21. Jobs diagnosed with cancer.\n\nIn 2003, the Apple CEO was diagnosed with a form of pancreatic cancer. He waited until the following year to tell Apple employees.\n\n22. Apple switches to Intel.\n\nThe chip maker known for its work on PCs agrees to a deal with Apple to build processors for Macs. As Envisioneering analyst Richard Doherty put it when rumors of the deal surfaced: \"It's like Ferrari going to BMW for an engine.\"\n\n23. The Stanford commencement speech.\n\n\"Stay hungry. Stay foolish.\"\n\n24. The backdated options controversy.\n\nApple admitted to backdating — boosting the value of stock option awards by manipulating dates -- for more than 6,000 grants. Apple had been accused of backdating then covering it up. \"I apologize to Apple's shareholders and employees for these problems, which happened on my watch,\" said Jobs in 2006, when Apple's independent investigation found no wrongdoing. \"They are completely out of character for Apple.\"\n\n25. Apple unveils iPhone.\n\nWhere to begin. Unfurled in early 2007, it made smartphones household, can't-live-without items. It helped create a world of apps. It changed how we live, work and entertain ourselves. Last year, lifetime sales of the iPhone topped 700 million. Although the iPod started Apple's hot streak, the iPhone was its most important device.\n\n26. The App Store opens for business.\n\nRoughly a year after the iPhone launches, Apple creates an online store where users can download third-party applications. Two months after the App Store arrived in June 2008, it topped 100 million downloads. Today, the App Store boasts more than 11 million developers.\n\n27. Jobs receives a liver transplant.\n\nStoking fears about the health of Apple's leader, a hospital in Tennessee confirms Jobs was recovering following a liver transplant. Officials called his prognosis following the procedure \"excellent.\"\n\n28. Apple announces iPad.\n\nApple tackles tablets next with the unveiling of its \"magical and revolutionary\" iPad in 2010. This would also mark the last new product reveal from Jobs. But the reach of Apple's mobile devices would expand quickly. Worldwide, there are more than 1 billion active devices running Apple's iOS operating system.\n\n29. Foxconn working conditions.\n\nApple and other tech companies faced growing scrutiny from humans rights groups following a series of suicides at Chinese company Foxconn, which helped make the iPhone and other tech products. Long working hours and low wages were cited among the reasons for the spike in suicides. The problem was serious enough that Foxconn installed \"suicide nets\" to prevent attempts.\n\n30. Jobs takes leave.\n\nApple's CEO takes his second leave of absence since 2009 to address his health. \"I love Apple so much and hope to be back as soon as I can,\" said Jobs in a 2011 memo to employees.\n\n31. Jobs steps down as CEO.\n\nIn a shocking move months after taking leave, Jobs resigns. Tim Cook is named Apple's next CEO. \"I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know,\" wrote Jobs in a letter address to the company's board and the Apple community. \"Unfortunately, that day has come.\"\n\n32. Steve Jobs dies.\n\nHe was 56, when he passed away on Oct. 5, 2011.\n\n33. The smartphone patent wars.\n\nApple's battle in the courtroom against Samsung began in 2011, when the company accused the electronics maker of copying the look and features of the iPhone with its line of Galaxy smartphones. The battle has gone all the way to the Supreme Court, which said this month it will review an appeal by Samsung on the ruling that awarded Apple $548 million in damages.\n\n34. Move over, Exxon.\n\nIn 2011, Apple overtook the oil giant as the world's most valuable company. The two companies would trade places at the top spot over the next several years, with Google parent company Alphabet jumping into the mix.\n\n35. Apple faces Congress over taxes.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook traveled to Washington to defend the tech giant against claims it avoids paying its taxes. \"We pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar,\" said Cook during a hearing with a Senate subcommittee. In a later interview with 60 Minutes, Cook called the complaints \"political crap.\"\n\n36. Apple acquires Beats.\n\nApple takes a huge plunge into digital music by acquiring Beats Electronics, makers of the trendy Beats headphones, for more than $3 billion in May 2014. Apple would leverage Beats' expertise toward its own streaming music service, called Apple Music.\n\n37. That free U2 album.\n\nAt the end of its fall 2014 event, when it introduced the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, rock band U2 performed. After the performance, U2 and Tim Cook announced the band's new album would be free to everyone. However, not many people were thrilled with a free U2 album invading their libraries, prompting Apple to instruct users how to hide it.\n\n(Side note: it also lead to one of the weirdest handshakes between Cook and Bono).\n\n38. ‘I’m proud to be gay'\n\nIn an essay published in October 2014, Tim Cook publicly confirmed he is gay, making him the highest-profile executive to come out. \"It is a game changer for corporate America,\" said Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD.\n\n39. Apple Watch is announced.\n\nApple joins companies including Samsung, Pebble and Fitbit in the wearables market with the Apple Watch. Although the Watch hasn't become a massive hit like earlier products, analysts project the device to eventually catch on with consumers.\n\n40. Apple takes on the government.\n\nA federal judge on Feb. 16, 2016, rules Apple must comply with an FBI order to unlock an iPhone used by one of the killers in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings. Apple refuses, saying the solution Apple would create is equivalent to building a \"back door\" on the iPhone. The FBI withdrew its case on March 28 after breaking into the phone without Apple's help."
