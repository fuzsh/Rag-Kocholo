        "text": "When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he started to turn Apple from a company that was $1 billion in the red to one of the most valuable companies in the world. In August 2018, the iPhone maker became the first company to cross $1 trillion. It hit the $2 trillion mark on August 20, 2020. Apple became a $3 trillion company briefly on January 3, 2022, and today its valuation is about $2.6 trillion.\n\nBy focusing on creating breakthrough products like the iPod, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, along with a rich set of services that have recurring revenues, Apple's growth, especially since Steve Jobs's death in 2011, has been no less than spectacular.\n\nWhile Steve Jobs will always be known as the visionary behind all of their products and software, he should be recognized for his choices in hiring world-class leaders to execute his vision. And his best hire has been Tim Cook, the current CEO of Apple today. His decision to have Tim work on their supply chain and operations when he returned to Apple goes down as a visionary move by Jobs. He had a clear vision for product designs by 1998 but needed a top-notch person to salvage a broken supply chain crippled by the last two CEOs at Apple from 1992-1997.\n\nTim Cook not only corrected the supply chain and operational deficiencies but created a world-class version of each that Apple has built on to become a multi-trillion dollar company.\n\nAnother thing that Jobs did was mentor and help prepare Tim Cook to take over his role at some point.\n\nIndeed, once Jobs got his cancer diagnosis in 2003, he sped up the process of tutoring Mr. Cook to take over someday. As a result, Cook became CEO in 2010, a year before Steve Jobs died. Here again, Jobs' foresight has served the company well, as Apple's most significant growth has come under Cook over the last 12 years.\n\nOf course, the tech industry and just about all sectors have been hit hard due to Covid, supply chain issues, inflation, and operational challenges. And Apple was not immune to these obstacles.\n\nApple CFO Luca Maestri made an important point and clear distinction about why Apple has fared better than most during the last earnings call. He stated, \"Our June quarter results continued to demonstrate our ability to manage our business effectively despite the challenging operating environment.‚Äù\n\nApple continues to be a growth stock as most buy-side analysts forecast that Apple's stock range will be between $170 to $200 in the future. At this writing, Apple's stock was $164.48 and up close to $35 from earlier this year.\n\nApple's upside, besides growing sales and demand from the current line of products and services, is framed by the fact that Apple has two other big things in the works. First, in the nearest future will be some AR-MR headsets that could debut as early as 2023. And it is well known that Apple has a significant research project on autonomous vehicles in the process. However, that release date is anyone's guess as Apple has been very mum on this project.\n\nAnother big thing in the works will take all of Mr. Cook's operational skills to execute to achieve its potential. According to Needham analyst Laura Martin, \"Apple is trying to step in and solve the ad-revenue problem for its app developers that are ad-driven.\" Ms. Martin made these comments during a CNBC interview with Jon Fortt.\n\nIn this interview, Mr. Fortt and Ms. Martin discuss the $450 billion total addressable market for mobile ads that Apple could tap into with a suitable business model and execution.\n\nThis potentially large market for ads that Apple could address will need Mr. Cook to bring all of his business acumen and operational experience to this opportunity. As Ms. Martin of Needham points out, it could be one of Apple's more extensive service opportunities. Success with mobile ads and the upcoming entries in AR-MR and perhaps someday autonomous cars suggests that Apple's upside could be substantial during the rest of this decade."
