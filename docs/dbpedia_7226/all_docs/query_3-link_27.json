        "text": "Discover your brand's unique character. Reveal the truth with our free quiz!\n\nApple is one of the world’s most influential companies.\n\nThe brand has gained a strong and loyal customer base by creating and selling high-quality products based on innovative design principles.\n\nBut Apple wasn’t always a success. The company went through its struggles and failures before becoming the renowned brand it is today.\n\nApple’s strong branding is spearheaded by its iconic logo design.\n\nWhat’s the story behind Apple’s famous logo?\n\nWhen was Apple established?\n\nApple Inc. was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. Two weeks after the company was formed, Wayne sold his interest in the company for $800.\n\nThe company was established during a time when technology was still in its infancy and computers were bulky and troublesome to use. Apple’s wanted to make computers more user-friendly by making them more portable.\n\nHow did Apple get its name?\n\nThere are many theories regarding Apple’s brand name and its origins. Some of these theories include:\n\nThe brand name was inspired by Eve’s bite out of the apple.\n\nThe story of Nymphus gaining immortality by eating a golden apple.\n\nAlan Turing, the father of modern computing, died after eating a poisoned apple.\n\nFrom the famous saying: “an apple a day keeps the doctor away.”\n\nSome claim that the three founders wanted a more casual name.\n\nSteve Jobs and Steve Wozniak wanted the Apple brand name to appear before Atari in phone books.\n\nBut in reality, Steve Jobs named the company Apple because he liked the fruit. Steve Jobs followed a fruitarian diet and suggested the name Apple to Wozniak after Jobs visited an apple orchard.\n\nHow did Apple develop its original brand identity?\n\nApple’s first logo design illustrated Isaac Newton reading under an apple tree. It was designed by the third co-founder, Ronald Wayne, in 1976.\n\nThe Evolution of the Apple logo\n\nApple’s logo has evolved over the years. We look at the most critical years of evolution below, and the following video is an excellent summary of the evolution of the apple logo.\n\n1976\n\nThe original Apple logo, designed by Ronald Wayne, shows an image of Isaac Newton reading a book under a tree. It captures the moment right before an apple fell on his head. The design includes the company name in a ribbon wrapping around the image.\n\nDespite its uniqueness and art, the logo doesn’t wholly represent what the company stands for and quickly became outdated.\n\n1977\n\nSteve Jobs thought the original logo was too old-fashioned and difficult to print on a smaller scale. He hired Rob Janoff, an experienced logo designer, to rebrand the company.\n\nJobs wanted a logo that would represent modern computer design’s importance and blend in with the brand name “Apple.” The result was an image of a two-dimensional apple colored with a spectrum of rainbow colors. That new design underscored the company’s Apple II computer – the world’s first colored-display computer.\n\nThe bitten Apple logo was intentionally designed to distinguish it from a cherry since apples and cherries often look alike.\n\n1984\n\nThe logo underwent minimal changes until 1984, but the most distinct difference happened during the Macintosh launch. Landor Associates removed the name “Apple” from the company logo and made it the logo we are familiar with today.\n\n1998\n\nSteve Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1986 due to a conflict with company executives. But he returned in 1997 as the company was close to going bankrupt.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that Jobs faced was to revamp the company’s image, starting from its logo. He changed the previous rainbow logo into translucent sky blue to fit the first iMac. But eventually switched to solid black in 1998 to complement their new silver computer models and to successfully paint Apple as a luxury brand.\n\nThe change to the logo also reflected Jobs’ love of skeuomorphism. In this design style, items mimic a real-world object so users can easily understand the designs, analogous to a product walkthrough, and adopt a new interface.\n\nFor instance, a 3-D image replicating a trashcan is easy for everyone to recognize, even if they don’t speak a particular language and can’t read the text.\n\n2001-2007\n\nApple released Cheetah, a MacOS 10.1, in 2001 with the aqua Apple logo, along with popular products such as the iPod, iTunes, and more. It was a revolutionary year for the brand as many of its products were popular and helped Apple to earn record profits.\n\nIn 2007, Apple changed the logo to a chrome-textured design to go with its upcoming aluminum-based products.\n\n2007-2015\n\nApple veered away from its glass-themed logo and went with a simple and flat design, keeping the design straightforward while complementing its products.\n\nThe logo since then has been the Apple logo popularly recognized today. The flat design perfectly complements Apple’s low-carbon aluminum devices, helping them appear luxurious and easy on the eyes.\n\nWhy is the Apple logo effective?\n\nThe Apple logo is now synonymous with a modern, reliable, and stylish brand. The logo continues to evolve alongside Apple’s products – a perfect representation of innovation.\n\nThe logo works because it’s simple and easy to understand, and even non-Apple users recognize the brand. The perfect pairing of the logo and its brand name has helped people quickly identify the brand.\n\nAnd while the logo remains to be an effective and robust depiction of luxury and credibility, Apple continues to deliver high-quality products that are user-friendly and portable.\n\n7 Interesting Apple facts you probably didn’t know\n\nThere is more to the beloved Apple brand than meets the eyes. Here are some interesting facts about Apple that you probably didn’t know:\n\nApple has more cash on hand than the government. The world’s most influential brand sometimes has twice the amount of cash as the US government.\n\nApple had a clothing line in 1986. In 1986, Apple launched a clothing line called “The Apple Collection.” The designs were far from the minimalistic Apple we know today. Their clothing line included shirts, accessories, and other items that sported the rainbow logo.\n\nAlmost all of the Apple devices in ads are set to 9:41. The time was initially set to 9:42, when the first iPhone was launched in 2007 by Steve Jobs. But it was later changed to 9:41 in 2010 during the first iPad launch.\n\nApple had over 140,000 employees worldwide in 2020.\n\nApple sold 657,000 iPhones each day in 2021.\n\nApple iPad doesn’t have a built-in calculator. There’s a rumor that Steve Jobs didn’t like the original calculator design for the tablet in 2010. And to this day, the Apple iPad still doesn’t have a calculator built in to use.\n\nApple continues to be one of the world’s most successful and influential brands. As the company changed and evolved, Apple evolved its branding too."
