        "text": "Steve Jobs\n\n(1976-1985; 1996-2011)\n\nApple’s legendary co-founder and former CEO and chairman. Jobs spurred boyhood friend Steve Wozniak to turn the computer Wozniak created — the Apple I — into a commercial product and the foundation of one of the first personal computer companies. In the early years, Jobs served as the face of Apple, but he also led the development of the Lisa and then the Macintosh.\n\nAfter being ousted in a boardroom dispute with then CEO John Sculley, he founded Next to make computers for the education market. He came back to Apple as a special adviser to the company after it bought Next. With Apple near death, he took back control of the company in a boardroom coup and proceeded to guide its resurrection. Under his leadership, Apple launched a slew of popular and revolutionary products, including the iMac, OS X, iTunes, the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad, transforming itself into an industry giant.\n\nSteve Wozniak\n\n(1976-1985)\n\nPopularly known as the “Woz,” Wozniak was a tinkerer, hacker and electronics geek who designed computer chips and other gadgets for fun. Wozniak invented the Apple I, one of the first personal computers, to impress the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, of which he was a member. Jobs convinced him to turn it into a commercial product and the basis of a new company. After co-founding the company, Wozniak followed up the Apple I by designing the Apple II, which was the company’s first big hit and one of the most successful early PCs.\n\nWozniak withdrew from the company after being injured in a plane crash. Although he returned to Apple, he felt out-of-step with its direction and left for good.\n\nMike Markkula\n\n(1977-1997)\n\nApple’s first investor and a co-founder, Markkula helped Jobs and Wozniak turn their homebrewed project into a formidable computer company. During his tenure, Markkula served in various roles — CEO, chairman, board member, president — and helped mentor Jobs as a manager. He approved the Macintosh project and defended it when Jobs wanted to kill it in favor of the Lisa.\n\nBut he was more than just a manager. He helped steer the development of the Apple II, wrote some of the early software for that computer and served as a product tester for the company. When Woz and Jobs left, he tried to keep the company to stay true to their legacy. Markkula played a key role in Jobs’ ouster, but voluntarily stepped down when Jobs retook control of the company.\n\nRegis McKenna\n\n(1983-1988, with other consulting)\n\nA public relations guru who helped Jobs and Wozniak get Apple off the ground. In 1976, soon after Apple was founded, McKenna introduced Jobs to Don Valentine, a venture capitalist who became one of the company’s first investors. McKenna helped Jobs and Wozniak plan the marketing and distribution of the Apple II, and his firm designed the company’s iconic logo of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Previously working as an outside consultant, McKenna joined Apple as a member of its executive team in 1983 and stayed with the company until 1988. After leaving, his firm continued to do work for the company until the early 1990s.\n\nMcKenna mentored Jobs during his first tenure at Apple, giving him key lessons in marketing. He continued to be a friend and confidant of Jobs for years, although he no longer worked for Apple directly or indirectly. In 2010, amid the controversy over a poorly designed antenna in the iPhone 4 that caused the device to lose signal strength when it was held, McKenna helped guide Apple’s response.\n\nJohn Sculley\n\n(1983-1993)\n\nThe former president of Pepsi Cola and the marketing whiz behind the Pepsi Challenge, Sculley was famously wooed to Apple by Jobs with the line, “Do you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life? Or do you want to come with me and change the world?” Sculley is credited for the success of the Apple II, the Macintosh and the portable PowerBook, as well as making Apple a household name. But he also oversaw the failed Newton MessagePad. A power struggle between Sculley and Jobs ultimately led Jobs to leave the company.\n\nGil Amelio\n\n(1996-1997)\n\nThe former chief executive of National Semiconductor, Amelio was hired by Apple to help turn the company around during a period of financial and product struggles. The company was in search of an operating system. Under Amelio, Apple paid $429 million for NeXT Software, Jobs’ company.\n\nJony Ive\n\n(1992-present)\n\nIve is Apple’s chief design officer responsible for all design at Apple, including the user interface of software, the packaging of products and the architecture at Apple’s new headquarters and its retail stores. The London-born Ive has designed most of Apple’s products, including the iPhone, the iPad, the candy-colored iMac and the Apple Watch.\n\nTim Cook\n\n(1998-present)\n\nApple’s current chief executive. An Alabama native, Cook is known as an operations expert. After 12 years at IBM and a stint at Compaq, he joined Apple in 1998 as senior vice president of worldwide operations and then became an executive vice president. He was credited with keeping Apple’s costs under control while also maintaining the quality of Apple’s products. Before being named CEO, Cook was the firm’s chief operating officer. As CEO, he has introduced the Apple Watch and Apple Pay. In 2014, he wrote an editorial in Bloomberg Business about being gay."
