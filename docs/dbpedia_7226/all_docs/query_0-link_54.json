        "text": "Source: Zhitong Finance and Economics\n\nAuthor: Wei Haoming\n\n$Apple (AAPL.US)$Announced the results for the fourth quarter. According to the data, Q3 revenue was $90.15 billion, up 8.1% from a year earlier, and the market expected $88.6 billion, thanks to better-than-expected growth in the Mac and wearable business. Earnings per share were $1.29, above the average forecast of $1.26.\n\nApple Inc's quarterly results released on Thursday brought just enough good news to avoid the fate of most tech giants in this earnings season. Valuations of similar companies have plummeted by hundreds of billions of dollars this earnings season. Although sales of iPhone and services fell short of expectations last quarter, Apple Inc's revenue and profit exceeded analysts' expectations. While the company said growth would not be so strong in the current quarter, investors found enough optimism to push shares higher after trading on Thursday.\n\nThis has something to do with$Alphabet-C (GOOG.US)$、$Amazon (AMZN.US)$、$Meta Platforms (META.US)$、$Microsoft (MSFT.US)$And other companies in sharp contrast, these companies have released depressing earnings reports in recent days, causing the share price to plummet.\n\nEven Apple Inc's overall good performance has raised questions among investors, who are looking for signs that the long-dynamic company could eventually become a victim of an economic slowdown. Apple Inc's iPhone and service sales were slightly lower than expected, raising concerns about these two areas that are expected to perform strongly. Luca Maestri, Apple Inc's chief financial officer, warned on a conference call that Apple Inc's Mac computer business would fall sharply during the holiday season after new models boosted sales.\n\nBut Apple Inc has been seen as an outlier in the tech industry's downturn because loyal consumers are still eager to snap up its expensive products. The company also released the latest iPhone earlier than in previous years, making Apple Inc's flagship equipment account for a larger share of sales in the fourth quarter. However, the company is likely to remain under pressure from soaring inflation and an overall slowdown in consumer spending, particularly on personal devices.\n\nBefore the Q4 earnings report, Apple Inc's share price had fallen 18 per cent so far this year, but that outperformed most major stock indexes. The s & p 500 fell 20% in 2022, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 31%.\n\nApple Inc did not provide specific revenue forecasts for the current quarter, continuing the approach taken by COVID-19 at the beginning of the epidemic. But analysts estimate that sales in the current quarter are about $128 billion, which would be an all-time high.\n\nItemized service\n\nApple Inc's fourth-quarter revenue from services such as music and video streaming was $19.2 billion, up 4.9% from a year earlier, well below expectations of nearly $20 billion. Earlier this week, the company raised the price of some services. Apple Music rose from $9.99 to $10.99 per month, and Apple TV+ from $4.99 to $6.99 per month. Apple Inc also slightly adjusted the pricing of Apple One service bundles. Higher prices may further increase revenue, but there is also a risk that customers will turn to competitors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter ended September 24, revenue from hardware products was $70.96 billion, up 9% from a year earlier, the company said. Of that total, revenue from Apple Inc's flagship device, iPhone, was about $42.6 billion, up 9.5% from a year earlier, and analysts expected it to be close to $42.7 billion.\n\nApple Inc's iPhone remains its biggest source of sales and the company is expected to get a boost from the iPhone released earlier this quarter. During this period, sales of iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max lasted about 9 days. But the iPhone 14 Plus was not released until this quarter, but the consumer response to the new model was lukewarm. Although the appearance of the iPhone 14 Pro is similar to that of the previous two models, new features such as a 48 million-pixel rear camera and smart island interface have helped attract consumers.\n\nMeanwhile, iPad's fourth-quarter sales fell 13% from a year earlier to $7.17 billion, also lower than expected. Sales of the tablet rebounded in 2020 and 2021, thanks to employees and students equipping home offices during the outbreak. Since then, demand has slowed and the device has suffered supply chain problems over the past year. Apple Inc launched a new iPad Air earlier this year, but didn't launch new basic iPad Pro and iPad models until this quarter.\n\nThe iPhone business, which boosted the third quarter, was relatively unimpressive in the fourth quarter. Moreover, the weakness of iPad business also gives Apple Inc a certain advantage. In contrast, Mac's fourth-quarter revenue was unusually substantial.\n\nIMac generated $11.5 billion in revenue, up 25.3% from a year earlier, easily exceeding expectations of $9.25 billion. The product line has also experienced strong demand from the epidemic due to the popularity of mixed workplaces. But it also suffered a slowdown, with Mac sales falling sharply below expectations in the third quarter. Mac rebounded in the fourth quarter, setting a sales record for the same period. The redesigned MacBook Air and the new low-end 13-inch MacBook Pro, Apple Inc's two most popular computers, have boosted this category.\n\n\"at a time when most large technology companies are struggling, Apple Inc's fourth-quarter revenue was slightly higher than a year earlier, showing the resilience of its business model,\" said Anurag Rana, an industry analyst at Bloomberg. \"\n\nHowever, on a conference call, Maestri said Mac performed better than usual last holiday season because of the redesign of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook pro. This is the first batch of Apple Inc to replace Intel Corp (Intel Corp.) with his own processor. High-end notebook computers made by chips. This shift will not be repeated during this year's holiday season.\n\nThe company's wearable, home and accessories divisions, including Apple Watch, AirPods, TV set-top boxes, HomePod, Beats headphones and other accessories, also showed growth in the fourth quarter. Apple Inc earned $9.65 billion in revenue from these products, an increase of 9.8% over the same period last year and exceeded market expectations.\n\nIn September this year, Apple Inc released the Apple Watch Ultra and the second generation AirPods Pro headphones. The new Apple Inc TV with faster chips will go on sale in early November.\n\nApple Inc hinted in his last quarterly report that it would be more cautious about spending as part of an overall slowdown in spending by Silicon Valley companies. Unlike some of his peers, Apple Inc did not lay off staff on a large scale. But the company reportedly plans to cut spending and slow hiring in 2023. Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple Inc, said in July: \"it is clear that we have considered the investment area carefully.\""
