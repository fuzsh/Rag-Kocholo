        "text": "“Apple Inc.’s new chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, is the $1 million man,” Adam Satariano reports for Bloomberg.\n\n“Maestri, who became CFO on May 29, will receive an annual salary of $1 million, according to a regulatory filing yesterday,” Satariano reports. “He was also awarded 6,337 in restricted stock units that will vest through 2018, which were worth $4 million based on Apple’s closing price of $633.”\n\nSatariano reports, “Italian-born Maestri previously worked at companies including Xerox Corp. He joined Apple last year as corporate controller. When announcing Maestri’s promotion to CFO in March, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said, “When we were recruiting for a corporate controller, we met Luca and knew he would become Peter [Oppenheimer]’s successor.””"
