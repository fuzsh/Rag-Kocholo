        "text": "If you don't know the name of the guy in the picture, you should probably learn it. That is Luca Maestri, and he is Apple's latest Senior Vice President. Maestri used to be the company's Corporate Controller, and is now its Chief Financial Officer.\n\nApple announced in March that its long-time CFO Peter Oppenheimer would be retiring this year, and Maestri would be taking his place. And according to SEC paperwork filed today, he officially became Oppenheimer's successor as of May 29th...\n\nApple has just announced via a media release that its longtime finance chief Peter Oppenheimer will be retiring at the end of September, ending a roughly 18-year career at the technology giant. The company called it a planned transition so he could take time for himself and his family.\n\nIn naming his successor, Apple said Luca Maestri, 50, will gradually take over as CFO in June to allow for a smooth transition. As per the release, during Oppenheimer's CFO time, Apple's revenue \"grew from $8 to $171 billion\".\n\nIt's interesting that Maestri left Nokia in February 2011, the same month the struggling Finnish cellphone giant announced they were adopting Microsoft's Windows Phone. He joined Apple in March of last year..\n\nPeter Oppenheimer, Apple's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has joined the Board of Directors of investment banking firm Goldman Sachs. The appointment brings the Goldman Sachs board to thirteen directors, ten of whom are independent.\n\nAccording to a newly published webpage over at Goldman Sachs, Oppenheimer will be a member of each of the firm’s Audit, Risk, Compensation and Corporate Governance, Nominating and Public Responsibilities committees.\n\n“Peter’s 25 years of broad experience across important industries will add a valuable perspective to our Board of Directors,” said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and CEO in a prepared statement. “We appreciate his willingness to serve as a director and look forward to benefitting from his judgment and counsel”...\n\nSome people collects rocks, other people collect stamps. Apple, however, likes cash. Turns out the iPhone maker, all by itself, controls ten percent of all corporate cash in the United States.\n\nJust how much is that? New data shows Apple's bank account of $147 billion represents ten percent of the $1.48 trillion held by non-banking U.S. companies.\n\nHere's another factoid to make you even more uneasy about that measly savings account of yours: all together, Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Pfizer - not exactly nickel and dime operations - account for another fifteen percent of all U.S. corporate cash...\n\nAlthough Apple compensated its CEO Tim Cook for the calendar year 2012 with a $1.36 million base salary and $2.8 million in compensation related to incentive plans, he didn't made the top five highest-rewarded corporate executives list in Standard & Poor’s top 500 companies. Instead, per Bloomberg's report filed Monday, four members of the Apple leadership dominate that list.\n\nTo be clear, these numbers count both base salaries and stock options companies usually give to their top dogs as sort of a retainer. Specifically, Bob Mansfield, Peter Oppenheimer, Bruce Sewell and Jeffrey Williams all made the top five highest-paid execs list, according to fiscal 2012 compensation figures for top earners filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission..."
