        "text": "Prior to coming to Apple, Luca Maestri worked for General Motors for over twenty years. He also was previously the CFO for Nokia Siemens Network, as well as for Xerox. It is clear that Maestri had plenty of experience before joining the Apple team. As of today, Luca Maestri is Apple’s Senior Vice President, as well as the Chief Financial Officer reporting to CEO Tim Cook. As a CFO Luca oversees the accounting business support, financial planning and the analysis of the financial reports. Luca Maestri joined Apple in 2013 as the Vice President of Finance and corporate controller. Maestri inherited the CFO position from long time Apple executive, Peter Oppenheimer, who retired from Apple in September of 2014.\n\nIn this video Maestri talks about his career and how he earned himself the title of being the CFO of the leading technology and consumer electronics company. He explains how securing this job took countless hours of work and years of commitment to the jobs he previously had. He mentions that without the managers he had, he would never be where he is today. He believes his managers were very motivational and inspiring, they pushed him to be his best, so he wants to do that for others.\n\nIn an article from Cult of Mac, prior to Maestri becoming CFO, Tim Cook is quoted saying that “his contributions to Apple have already been significant in his time with us and he has quickly gained respect from his colleagues throughout the company.” Maestri was essential in the success when Apple announced in January of 2015 that they had made more profit in the previous three months than any other company in history.\n\nAs CFO Maestri is a transformational leader, for example he built his early reputation by guaranteeing he will give each employee a sense of control with their work, also that he hopes to inspire each of them as his managers did for him. He uses organizational tactics like being available to employees and assuring they have all the necessary resources. He also holds weekly meeting to discuss what progress has been made toward the goals of the company and anything else the employees are concerned about. One of the reasons for Maestri’s success is he can align his company with one main vision, then he holds everyone accountable for their part in making that vision happen.\n\nMaestri said that one thing he needs in an office environment is communication, it is important to get everyone on the same page and get rid of barriers, so information can flow freely. Additionally, it is important to be open to all ideas from the employees. Maestri also has a servant leadership style because he is always ready to hear other’s ideas, and if someone’s idea is implemented, that person would be granted several extrinsic rewards including recognition and monetary awards. However, regardless of the idea gets implemented, he encourages everyone to participate. I believe this type of environment is one of the reasons Apple is so successful, it lets everyone in the company have a say and feel comfortable sharing their opinion.\n\nMaestri is well liked by his subordinates at Apple and many employees look up to him, not only in a professional way but also a personal way. This is possibly due to his very relaxed nature that makes people feel comfortable when speaking with him. Maestri has helped Apple increase profits and has already left his mark, despite only being with the company for 5 years.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“Apple Leadership – Luca Maestri.” Apple , http://www.apple.com/leadership/luca-maestri/.\n\nHein, Buster. “Apple’s Luca Maestri Named Most Admired CFO.” Cult of Mac, Cult of Mac, 26 July 2015, http://www.cultofmac.com/310890/apples-luca-maestri-named-fortunes-admired-cfo/."
