        "text": "Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s senior vice president and chief financial officer, plans to retire in September, after an 18-year career at the technology giant.\n\nLuca Maestri, the company’s vice president for finance and corporate controller, who started at Apple last spring, will replace Mr. Oppenheimer, moving into the position this summer.\n\nAs chief financial officer for the last decade, Mr. Oppenheimer, who started in 1996 as controller for the Americas, helped oversee a shrewd global financial strategy, with Apple garnering record profit and building a significant pile of cash.\n\nAs part of the strategy, Apple set up a web of subsidiaries around the world, allowing the company to legally avoid billions of dollars of taxes in the United States. In 2013, Apple raised $17 billion to fund a shareholder payout, a move that potentially helped the company save on taxes.\n\n“He’s done a fantastic job building the war chest,” said Lawrence Isaac Balter, chief market strategist at Oracle Investment Research.\n\nIn a statement, Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, credited Mr. Oppenheimer with managing the company’s finances during a period of significant international expansion and revenue growth. In the last 10 years, revenue has increased more than 2,000 percent to more than $171 billion, from $8 billion.\n\nHe was rewarded handsomely for his role. In fiscal 2012, Mr. Oppenheimer took home a $68.6 million compensation package, making him the top-paid chief financial officer that year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. That compensation was also higher than that of his boss, Mr. Cook.\n\n“I love Apple and the people I have had the privilege to work with and after 18 years here, it is time for me to take time for myself and my family,” Mr. Oppenheimer, 51, said in a statement. This week, Mr. Oppenheimer was named to the board of Goldman Sachs.\n\nHis successor, Mr. Maestri, 50, comes to the role with deep international expertise. He spent the first 20 years of his career at General Motors, where he helped to establish regional operations in Asia and restructure operations in South America. In his last job at the automaker, Mr. Maestri was chief financial officer for the European business, managing operations in more than 45 countries and about $40 billion in annual revenue.\n\nAfter leaving G.M. in 2008, he was chief financial officer for Nokia Siemens Networks and later held the same position for Xerox.\n\nHis ascent to Apple’s top financial post was all but inevitable from the start, Mr. Cook said. “When we were recruiting for a corporate controller, we met Luca and knew he would become Peter’s successor.”"
