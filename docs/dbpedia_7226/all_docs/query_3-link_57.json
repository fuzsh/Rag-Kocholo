        "text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook is planning to exit Apple within the next ten years. Here are the strongest contenders to be his replacement as chief executive.\n\n\"Ten more years? Probably not,\" Cook responded to a query of another decade of his governance.\n\nWhen pressed about who would replace him, he didn't name names but did offer that there was a number of possibilities. \"I would say my job is to prepare several people for the ability to succeed,\" he hinted.\n\nFurthermore, he admitted he really wants \"the person to come from within Apple, the next CEO. And so that's my role is to make sure that there's several for the board to pick from.\"\n\nOutside of Cook's comments, there is practically no chance of knowing who exactly will take the position of chief executive until that fateful statement is issued from Apple's newsroom. At least, not officially.\n\nWhomever the board decides should be the next CEO, it will be selected with great care and an assumption that they will push the company forward. At the same time, due to its size and value, it also needs to be someone who won't rock the boat for investors either.\n\nThere are clear frontrunners for the biggest job in tech. All are selections that can reassure shareholders and consumers alike, and just like Cook, could stick around for quite some time.\n\nSafe Hands: Jeff Williams, Craig Federighi, Greg \"Joz\" Joswiak\n\nThe most obvious choices for the top of the list are those at the top of the company, especially those who have a major hand in steering Apple's future course.\n\nCounting against Williams is his age. If Cook departed ten years after his declaration, he would be aged 70, and Williams would be 68, making the COO unlikely to have a long tenure at the top.\n\nFederighi is also one of the big personalities at Apple, with his appearance at Apple events becoming meme-worthy at times. Following the outspoken Jobs and the calm Cook, the board could easily pick someone willing to make a show of things.\n\nThe software SVP also benefits from age. Following the same ten-year period for Cook's departure, Federighi would be 61, which could be a good opening for the executive.\n\nHis 30 years of experience in Apple's marketing department would also be a big bonus for a company so well-known for advertising. However, his Cook-departure age of 66 does put him in the middle ground when considering his potential tenure.\n\nAll three of the above could easily fill the slot of CEO, with personalities and experience that would be acceptable to investors and employees alike.\n\nVisible and possible: Eddy Cue and Phil Schiller\n\nIn the case of Cue, the SVP of Internet Software and Services, he has his hands all over Apple's Services business. This high-level growth center for the company has become one of its most important sources of revenue and is continuing to get even bigger.\n\nAs an employee since 1989, Cue has the history behind him, but with a potential age of 66 at Cook's ten-year departure time, he's a better choice sooner rather than later.\n\nWhat Schiller has in his favor is that he's not an SVP: he's an Apple Fellow, meaning he has a reduced role within the company. This could be beneficial to Schiller, as it means he could more easily take the CEO role without disrupting the positions of other executives.\n\nAge is a factor, though, and being the same as Cook, that would mean Schiller could be 70 by the time Cook leaves, making his occupancy of the CEO role a bit trickier to justify.\n\nThird tier: Deirdre O'Brien, Johny Srouji, Lisa Jackson, and John Ternus\n\nAll four of these names are major players in the executive pack, making them still viable options for the board, but not necessarily the most likely picks for CEO.\n\nDeirdre O'Brien is the SVP of Retail, carrying on the work of renovating and opening new storefronts around the world and managing Apple's online teams. Managing customers is certainly an important part of why Apple users love the company.\n\nShe has also worked for Apple for over 30 years and worked on every Apple product launch since joining. Her experience as the chief of People will also be a benefit when dealing with the army of employees.\n\nHe joined in 2008 to help make Apple's chips, which isn't much of a tenure compared to others, but his work's impact on the company certainly counts in his favor.\n\nHowever, having previously served as administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency before joining Apple, this gives her managerial experience others can't match. There are also her prominent appearances during Apple presentations, giving her considerable visibility to the public.\n\nTernus benefits from being the defacto face of the Apple Silicon transition, as well as his age. Based on graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1997, Ternus is probably in his late 40s, making him one of the youngest candidates who also has considerable time at the company.\n\nInvisibles: Other Apple executives\n\nIn many companies, installing a new CEO from a roster of existing SVPs, VPs, and C-level executives would be fairly painless. Everyone at those levels will have proven themselves capable of performing the role in their work, with little effort required to switch metaphorical seats.\n\nOne of the problems for the other members of Apple's leadership is that they aren't visible enough to be seriously considered for the job at the world's biggest company. As a major household name where keynotes and product launches are global news, Apple would need a new CEO who ideally would be a known entity, who could easily become a figurehead.\n\nSometimes, a candidate can be ruled out because they're better off serving the company's needs where they are than in the CEO's chair.\n\nSometimes, they can be ruled out because they are on the way out.\n\nIt is highly likely that Apple will opt for someone with a history and who has \"lived\" Apple for a significant time to take the mantle of CEO. That is especially evident considering Cook's hope for the next board choice.\n\nHowever, there's always the possibility of Apple looking outside the company. Among the six CEOs who preceded Cook were former PepsiCo CEO John Sculley who boosted the company with his marketing skills, and former National Semiconductor CEO Gil Amelio, who served on Apple's board for two years before taking on the role.\n\nApple could convince another CEO or a high-level executive with the right skill set to jump into the position to shake up the company. But then again, Apple's board and investors may not necessarily want to rock the boat too much.\n\nThere's also the possibility of looking to former Apple executives as potential candidates.\n\nApple's board may find it is a difficult task to bring someone from the outside in to helm the company. Maybe impossible."
