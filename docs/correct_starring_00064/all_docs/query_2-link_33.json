        "text": "Does Austin Powers hold up? The question feels idiotic. This is a film series infused with the gleeful misogyny of early Bond movies as a selling point (we are introduced, early in the first film, to a female secretary named Alotta Fagina, for example). This is a franchise that cast Verne Troyer as a character named Mini-Me who speaks mostly in frightened shrieks. This is a film series starring fucking Mike Myers, the Love Guru guy, the man who looked like he actually shit himself that time Kanye West voiced his opinion of George W. Bush on live TV. “Of course it doesn't hold up,” I told my editor long before I agreed to rewatch the films.\n\nThen again, \"holding up\"—whether you take it to mean \"remaining funny\" or \"displaying a preternatural social consciousness that endures decades later\"—is really a preoccupation of the Austin Powers movies themselves. And maybe there were still some surprising takeaways from a franchise, now 21 years old, about a dude who loves fucking.\n\nFor the blissfully uninitiated, Austin Powers is a film trilogy about a prolific ’60s spy who's unfrozen in the ’90s and thrust into new assignments in a world he no longer understands. He's also, in one of many catchphrases that would become Borat-level ubiquitous for a time, extremely \"randy.\" Powers is described as \"irresistible to women,\" and was a celebrity back in his time. Fast-forward to 1997 and, paired with the serious but good-humored Agent Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley in one of the 5,000 films she did between 1995 and 2002), Powers is forced to confront the world moving on from his \"free love\" era.\n\nThe dynamic between Powers, his nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers, also unfrozen in 1997 after 30 years), and the new age they find themselves in is the best and most inventive thing about the first movie. These men navigate new social mores, but also spy-movie clichés. Early on, Dr. Evil isn't wise, for example, to the Prince Charles–Camilla Parker Bowles story, coming up with an idea to blackmail Prince Charles with fabricated evidence of an affair. Nor is he hip to inflation, and his plan to hold the world hostage for \"one million dollars\" is very cute. Rewatching, it's important to try to give credit where it's due for the satire on display here. It's not exactly innovative, but that's because we've seen a glut of films taking on the tropes of action movies of yesteryear since International Man of Mystery's release. Even Bond himself underwent a subversive and—gasp—blond makeover just nine years later.\n\nAs far as its bumbling but well-meaning protagonist goes, the Austin Powers movies don't fuck up as much as they could have. You can draw parallels between the first Austin Powers and MacGruber, a film I love shamelessly: Both are aware their title characters are not aspirational figures. These men's competence pales in comparison to their more bureaucratic (and often female) counterparts. Though where MacGruber holds its coward of a protagonist responsible for countless deaths, botched plans, and the betrayal of his peers, Austin Powers lets its hero get away with all but a slap on the wrist. A scene in which he admits to cheating on Kensington (they, of course, hook up roughly 30 minutes into the film) reads particularly poorly today. He is forgiven the next day, because he is a product of a different era. Here, Myers embodies the screenwriting equivalent of excusing a cop uncle's racist joke at Thanksgiving: He doesn't know any better, and he's innately good, so...we cool?\n\nFrom there, the wheels come off this entire endeavor. The next two films in the series, The Spy Who Shagged Me and Goldmember, are desperately preoccupied with mining Powers's ignorance for laughs, without ever holding it to serious account. As all comedy sequels are wont to do, they double down on the worst and ugliest jokes in the original film, adding a host of new characters who one can imagine in the first draft were named things like \"THE FAT ONE\" or \"THE BLACK ONE.\" You need only take a cursory glance at Myers's repertoire to see he doesn't have much in his comedy arsenal besides \"Here is what this person looks and sounds like.\"\n\nIn Goldmember, which is by its own admission one giant dick joke, the inclusion of Beyoncé Knowles as a character named Foxxy Cleopatra is especially rough. There's nothing wrong with a good, renewed take on the \"blaxploitation\" genre, but Mike Myers is not the man to write it, and by the second and then third time Knowles calls out Powers's \"jive-ass\" for no reason, the question starts to nag: What is the joke Myers is going for here, other than that there is a black woman in this movie? By extension, what is the point of Powers expressing unreserved sexism, racism, selfishness, if it's never once truly positioned as a fault of his?\n\nBy its very nature, International Man of Mystery does not hold up, which in and of itself isn't the worst thing. It's light and dumb and at least displays moments of insight, from predicting sharks with frickin' lasers attached to their heads (which are now a real thing) to approaching some semblance of awareness around its titular stuck-in-time hero. Then it plays itself, again and again, as many a once-promising comedy franchise finds itself doing.\n\nDoes it hold up?\n\nShagadelic baby, no."
