You can only write stuff that is in your heart; I don't think there's a formula, and I know that it's foolish to look for one. My father's favorites were mine: Peter Sellers, Monty Python, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, all of that stuff. My dad was a guy who loved to be silly; he had a highly prized sense of humor. When I would bring friends home to play table hockey in the basement, if my dad didn't think they were funny, he wouldn't let them in the house. 'They can't come around,' he'd say. 'They're not bloody funny!\" --Myers quoted in BIOGRAPHY, June 1999."
