It reaches UK screens, title uncut, on 30 July.\n\nThe film - which stars Mike Myers as a 1960s British spy caught in a timewarp - is being launched at the Cannes Film Festival. The launch party on Saturday will be broadcast on the film's Website.\n\nIn the movie, the hapless Powers is forced to travel back in time to the 1960s to help defeat his arch-nemesis Dr Evil with the help of his CIA colleague, Felicity Shagwell, played by Heather Graham.\n\nElizabeth Hurley, who co-starred in the first movie, returns for a cameo role, along with Burt Bacharach, Willie Nelson, Tim Robbins and Elvis Costello.\n\nThe soundtrack includes contributions from Madonna and Spice Girl Mel B."
