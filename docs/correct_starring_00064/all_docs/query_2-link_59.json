He is, without a doubt, a highly-functioning, multi-talented man whose unique approach to comedy had put him in a bracket with some of the legends of character roleplay such as Jim Carrey and Martin Lawrence. Born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Myers had acquired international success and has helped to produced truly unforgettable films alongside celebrities such as the Queen of Pop, BeyonceÌ Knowles, Seth Green, Elizabeth Hurley, Rob Lowe, Dana Carvey, Nancy Travis, businesswoman and actress Jessica Alba, and musician/actor Justin Timberlake. Here are 10 of the highest-grossing films of Mike Myers.\n\nShrek 2 - $935.253 Million\n\nShrek 2 is a computer-animated fantasy comedy film that was released in 2004.The Shrek franchise is based on the 1990 picture book, Shrek!, by William Steig, and has a total of five films, including the Puss in Boots spin-off, which together has grossed $3.5 billion. The film follows Shrek (Mike Myers) and his newly-wed wife Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) who have been invited by Fiona's parents, King Harold (John Cleese) and Queen Lillian to a royal ball following the couple's return from their honeymoon. Shrek is immediately dismissive of the idea of attending, but is later convinced by Fiona and Donkey, played by comedy king Eddie Murphy. As an ogre, Shrek is not accepted by Fiona's parents, who had planned for her to marry Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), and with the help of Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders), still intend to do so. The film grossed a whopping $935.253 million, almost doubling that of the original Shrek in 2001.\n\nShrek The Third - $807.330\n\nAs the title might suggest, Shrek The Third is the third installment of the Shrek film franchise and was released in 2007. Trouble in Far Far Away land continues as Shrek (Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are scheduled to succeed a dying King Harold (John Cleese). While on medical leave, Shrek practices for his new royal position as a Regent but fails miserably, prompting King Harold to seek after a more suitable heir: his nephew and Fiona's cousin Arthur \"Artie\" Pendragon, voiced over by Justin Timberlake. While Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots voiced over by Antonio Banderas went to fetch Artie to become heir, Prince Charming vows to take the throne as King of Far Far Away and also repay the death of his mother, Fairy Godmother.\n\nShrek Forever After - $756.244 Million\n\nThe 2007 release of Shrek Forever After also did not fail to deliver, grossing $756.244 million at the box office against a $165 million budget. The film continues to follow the lives of Shrek and Princess Fiona, and gives a flashback of King Harold and Queen Lillian, played by Julie Andrews, who years ago almost signed the kingdom of Far Far Away over to Rumpelstiltskin (Rumpel) (Walt Dohrn) in exchange for removing the curse from Fiona. But the deal was later cancelled when Shrek rescued Fiona, causing Rumpel to devise a scheme to have Shrek sign a deal that gives him one day from Shrek's childhood - the day he was born. The alternate reality now puts Rumpel as the King of Far Far Away along with his witch army, and only Princess Fiona's love can turn things around.\n\nShrek - $491.812 Million\n\nAlthough the book Shrek! was authored by William Steig and released in 1990, film director, producer, and screenwriter Steven Spielberg purchased rights to the book in 1991 with the intent of producing a traditionally-animated film adaptation. However, it was bought to DreamWorks Pictures in 1994, a company which was also majority-owned by Spielberg. There, it gave birth to the film surrounding a green ogre named Shrek who lives in solitude by a swamp. However, when Lord Farquaad of Duloc (John Lithgow) exiles a mass of fairy-tale creatures who emigrate to Shrek's peaceful swamp, he decides to confront Farquaad and demand that they relocate. The Magic Mirror then tells Farquaad that if he wished to be king, he must marry a princess, and he chooses Princess Fiona, voiced by the elusive Cameron Diaz. Although he is disgusted by the ogre, Farquaad summons him to rescue Fiona and return her to him so they can marry. But along, the way, they fall in love.\n\nRELATED: The Highest-Grossing Beyonce Knowles Films, Ranked\n\nInglorious Basterds - $316.915\n\nWritten and directed by the creator of Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino gave birth to the 2009 war film titled Inglorious Basterds, which grossed $316.915 million at the global box office against a film budget of $70 million.
