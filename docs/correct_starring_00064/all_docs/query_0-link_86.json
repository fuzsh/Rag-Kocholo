        "text": "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me | 1999\n\nThe joke hasn't stretched as thin as you might have anticipated. The ‘Secret Projects Room’, where Basil Exposition (Michael York) equips Austin Powers (Mike Myers) with his psychedelic VW ‘Swinger 2’ time machine, is one of the two enormous Blimp Hangars at Tustin, between Santa Ana and Irvine in Orange County, southeast of Los Angeles. They can also be seen in Pearl Harbor.\n\nBuilt in 1942 during WWII, the two Tustin hangars are two of the largest wooden structures ever built (at 17 stories tall, they contain the largest covered, unobstructed open space in the world). The southern hangar is due to be demolished, but there are plans to incorporate the other into a regional park.\n\nThe lovely English countryside, where they are chased by Mustafa (Will Ferrell), and which looks nothing like southern California, is the San Marcos Pass, on Route 154 near West Camino Cielo, northwest of Los Padres National Forest.\n\nAnd if, for a second, you thought that was the real ‘Carnaby Street’ in London, just notice the Hollywood Hills in the distance. Of course, it’s the ‘New York Street’ on the backlot at Universal Studios Hollywood."
