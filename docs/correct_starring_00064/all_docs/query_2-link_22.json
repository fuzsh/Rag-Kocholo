        "text": "How funny is the sight of Mike Myers, mangy mat of fake chest hair stuck to his pudgy flesh, capering naked through the public areas of a posh hotel, his private areas mercifully obscured by a series of phallic props? Let your answer be your guide when it comes to this sequel to the surprise hit AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY, in which swinging '60s super spy Powers was revived from cryogenic sleep to defeat the effete Dr. Evil (Myers), and found his shagadelic attitudes out of sync in the '90s. Here Austin gets sent back where he belongs via the wonder of time travel. Dr. Evil returns to 1969 with a nefarious plan to cripple Austin by stealing his studly \"mojo,\" then bring the world to its knees with a giant laser &#151; how funny that it resembles a big penis! Unmanned but unbowed, Austin joins forces with randy CIA cutie Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) and unleashes a steady stream of bodily function jokes and lame double entendres upon audiences who can only claim to be unsuspecting if they've been hiding out in a cryogenic freezer tube themselves. There are plusses: Rob Lowe, who plays the younger version of Dr. Evil's suave sidekick, Number 2 (Robert Wagner), does a dead-on imitation of the older actor; Evil's pint-sized clone, Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer), is an amusing conceit; Seth Green makes hay with the role of Evil's sullen son, Scott; and Graham looks absolutely fabulous in her Carnaby Street duds. But the elaborate, show-stopping set piece that relies on overlapping scenes of people spotting a suggestively shaped rocket, bridged by slang terms for penis (which the filmmakers found so hilarious they did it twice) would be too long even if it were twice as funny. And that about sums up the movie."
