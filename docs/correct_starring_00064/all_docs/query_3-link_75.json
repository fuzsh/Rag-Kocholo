        "text": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — Movies have used Staten Island as a backdrop for decades.\n\nEven today, when production trucks are spotted in Staten Island neighborhoods, there is a sense of excitement that the next big project chose the borough as a set.\n\n************\n\nRELATED: 28 popular TV shows you probably didn’t know were filmed on Staten Island\n\n************\n\nFrom horror flicks to rom-coms, there are a diverse array of movies that have filmed here through the years. Here are 33 that you may not have known about.\n\n1. ‘PERILS OF PAULINE’ (1914)\n\nOh yeah, we’re going way back. Nine episodes of the classic damsel-in-distress series — yes, the one with the iconic image of screaming ingenue Pearl White tied to the train tracks — were shot at Brady’s Pond and Fred Scott’s Movie Ranch at the foot of Sand Lane in South Beach.\n\n2. ‘KEYSTONE COMEDIES’ (1914-1916)\n\n3. ‘SORRY, WRONG NUMBER’ (1948)\n\nHard-living Staten Islander Mabel Normand (a favorite leading lady of Charlie Chaplin) headlined this legendary series of “instant movies” shot in St. George.\n\nThis film noir — starring Barbara Stanwyck (in an Oscar-nominated performance) and Burt Lancaster — was adapted by Lucille Fletcher from her radio play about a woman who overhears a murder plot.\n\nShot in real time, with many flashbacks to flesh out the story, Stanwyck’s bedroom window overlooks the night skyline of Manhattan. The camera work is very dark with looming shadows and circling camera shots used to maintain a high level of suspense.\n\nMultiple sources list “Sorry, Wrong Number” as having been filmed on S.I., but information is far from concrete when it comes to actual locations.\n\n4. ‘THE BATTLE CRY OF PEACE’ (1915)\n\nFort Wadsworth was the site of battles that “featured an estimated 25,000 National Guard troops, 800 members of the Grand Army of the Republic, and about 5,000 horses,” according to film historian Hugh Powell.\n\n5. ‘THAT KIND OF WOMAN’ (1959)\n\nLegendary Hollywood actress Sophia Loren danced with Jack Warden on the Staten Island Ferry in this otherwise forgettable romance co-starring Tab Hunter.\n\n6. ‘SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS’ (1961)\n\nAn iconic Staten Island home was used as the backdrop of “Splendor in the Grass.” The melodrama with romance infused in its plot centers on virginal Deanie (Natalie Wood) who suffers thanks to messing around with rich wannabe stud Bud (Warren Beatty).\n\nBelow: The Blanchard home in Travis that was transformed to resemble the 1920s Kansas home of Wood’s character.\n\n7. ‘WHO’S THAT KNOCKING AT MY DOOR’ (1968)\n\nMartin Scorsese’s directorial debut — starring his soon-to-be frequent collaborator Harvey Keitel — put him on the map as a promising indie filmmaker and featured a scene shot in the St. George Ferry Terminal.\n\n8. ‘THE GODFATHER’ (1972)\n\nA Staten Island home was the basis of Don Corleone’s retreat in the opening sequence of Francis Ford Coppola’s classic crime family epic. The lavish wedding party was shot entirely on the home’s four-acre grounds, complete with a fake brick wall and wrought-iron gate.\n\nScenes were shot in Sunnyside, Emerson Hill and at Mount Loretto. The iconic baptism scene was filmed inside Mount Loretto’s church.\n\n9. ‘SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER’ (1977)\n\nJohn Travolta’s disco classic climaxes with a suicide dive off the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.\n\n10. ‘HE KNOWS YOU’RE ALONE” (1980)\n\nIf you ever need a fun fact to tell at parties, rattle off that Tom Hanks made his film debut on Staten Island. Yep, even the A-list actor recalls his time filming the slasher flick “He Knows You’re Alone” on the borough at the tender age of 24.\n\n“He Knows You’re Alone,” directed by Armand Mastroianni, follows a soon-to-be bride who is stalked by a killer the weekend before her wedding. The film was set on Staten Island and had a budget of $250,000, according to IMDb.\n\n11. ‘NEIGHBORS’ (1981)\n\nEarl Keese (John Belushi) is a low-key, ineffectual, middle-class suburbanite with a wife and teenage daughter. Earl’s peaceful, dreary life changes when a younger couple, Vic (Dan Aykroyd) and Ramona (Cathy Moriarty), move in next door. The new neighbors impose themselves on the Keese household, leaving Earl infuriated with the loud, gung-ho Vic, and flustered by the sly and seductive Ramona. Earl is frustrated by his inability to handle them, and the way that he can never come up with absolute proof that the couple are doing anything wrong on purpose.\n\nOver the course of one night, the antagonism between Earl and his new neighbors escalates into turf wars filmed around Rosebank and at Sea View Hospital Rehabilitation Center and Home.\n\nIn the end, this was Belushi’s final film before he died of a drug overdose.\n\n12. ‘EASY MONEY’ (1983)\n\nRodney Dangerfield and Joe Pesci starred in this lesser comedy filmed in New Dorp, Eltingville and Grasmere, but an “Easy Money” scene involving a cake and a well-known Staten Island bakery stole the show.\n\nAlfonso’s Pastry Shoppe was the bakery in the backdrop of the iconic scene.\n\n13. ‘GRACE QUIGLEY’ (1984)\n\nHollywood legend Katherine Hepburn shot this underrated comedy-drama — one of her final big screen appearances — around Willowbrook, circa 1983.\n\n14. ‘WORKING GIRL’ (1988)\n\n“Working Girl” is one of those “slice of life” movies, depicting a time period correctly. Overusing hairspray, late-night ferry rides and landing a “big city” Manhattan job were represented for Staten Island in the very ’80s flick.\n\nMelanie Griffith, in an Oscar-nominated performance, stars as big-haired, big-hearted Tess McGill — an Islander trying to make it on Wall Street. Alec Baldwin makes an early film appearance as her cheating blue-collar boyfriend. Scenes were filmed at an apartment New Brighton, at St. Stanislaus Kostka Church and aboard Staten Island ferries.\n\nTo this day, Staten Islanders embrace the film and hold events themed after “Working Girl” characters.\n\n15. ‘GOODFELLAS’ (1990)\n\nIf you’re from Staten Island, you know the thrill of seeing this New Springville strip in the classic “Goodfellas” film. “Goodfellas,” directed by Martin Scorsese, propelled Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco to cinematic immortality with an in-depth look at life inside the mafia.\n\n16. ‘THE SEIGE’ (1998)\n\nThis Bruce Willis and Denzel Washington action film featured a scene near the Alice Austen House in Rosebank.\n\n17. ‘DONNIE BRASCO’ (1997)\n\nThis true-life mob tale starring Johnny Depp and Al Pacino featured a scene at the Great Kills Marina.\n\n18. & 19. ‘A BEAUTIFUL MIND’ (2001) & ‘FUR’” (2006)\n\nBoth films — starring Russell Crowe and Nicole Kidman, respectively — were shot on the 83-acre Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden in Livingston.\n\nIn Ron Howard’s “A Beautiful Mind,” a brilliant but mentally ill mathematician (Crowe) tries to crack codes of an enemy telecommunication for the U.S. government in a shed built on Snug’s grounds. For “Fur,” an “Imaginary Portrait” of photographer Diane Arbus (Kidman), the South Meadow doubled as a nudist colony.\n\n20. ‘HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS’ (2003)\n\nIf you pay attention closely, you’ll see the Staten Island Ferry included in this trailer of “How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days.” Matthew McConaughey plays a Staten Island native with a Southern drawl opposite Kate Hudson in this hit romantic comedy.\n\n21. ‘SCHOOL OF ROCK’ (2003)\n\nWagner College earned the title of the “School of Rock” in this 2003 film starring Jack Black. OK, it may not officially rock that title, but the Grymes Hill campus was the filming location for the movie that later inspired a Broadway musical.\n\nThe student’s climactic “battle of the bands” scene was filmed at the historic St. George Theatre.\n\n22. ‘WAR OF THE WORLDS’ (2005)\n\nA post-apocalyptic car chase, directed by Steven Spielberg and featuring Tom Cruise, took place on the Staten Island Expressway.\n\n23. ‘LITTLE CHILDREN’ (2006)\n\nThe lives of two unhappy spouses (Kate Winslet, Patrick Wilson) from separate marriages intersect with a registered sex offender (Oscar nominee Jackie Earle Haley) in a small Massachusetts community. The adulterers meet up at their kids’ playground (pastoral Walker Park), and Wilson’s character plays in a friendly football league (on Tottenville High’s 458,000-square-foot artificial turf), which celebrates in a local roadhouse, aka Killmeyer’s Old Bavaria Inn in Charleston.\n\n24. ‘SALT’ (2010)\n\nAs a rogue CIA agent trying to clear her name after being accused of being a Russian sleeper spy, Angelina Jolie donned a fur cap and tons of attitude on the South Shore waterfront. Paparazzi staked out the nearby Historic Old Bermuda Inn during the film’s production.\n\n25. ‘MR. POPPER’S PENGUINS’ (2011)\n\nJim Carrey casually walked through the Staten Island Zoo in West Brighton while filming “Mr. Popper’s Penguins” in 2011.\n\nWhen Thomas Popper (Jim Carrey) receives a mysterious crate from Antarctica, it marks the end of his comfortable and well-ordered existence as a New York real estate mogul — and the beginning of his new life as caretaker, landlord and parent figure to six unforgettable penguins, each with a distinct personality.\n\n26. ‘TRAINWRECK’ (2015)\n\nJudd Apatow’s “Trainwreck” featured visuals of the Staten Island Ferry and gave St. George resident (then Great Kills resident) Pete Davidson some screen time. Emmy winner Amy Schumer made her big-screen debut in this film as the main character.\n\n27. STATEN ISLAND SUMMER (2015)\n\nThis was prime time for Staten Island, and the projects that filmed here.\n\nThe film followed Danny (Graham Phillips) and Frank’s (Zack Pearlman) last summer together before college. They are both working as lifeguards and trying to find summer hook-ups. With a troubling setback, they still manage to throw an end-of-the-summer party.\n\n“Saturday Night Live” headwriter and Staten Island native Colin Jost wrote the story behind the film, directed by Rhys Thomas.\n\nThe film used the Great Kills Swim Club as a main location for production. “Staten Island Summer” caused some neighborhood commotion as a scene including an explosion was filmed.\n\n28. ‘NERVE’ (2016)\n\n“Nerve” was surprisingly Staten Island centric.\n\nScenes were filmed inside the Colonnade Diner off Hylan Boulevard and epic battle scenes were filmed on the grounds of Fort Wadsworth. The film notably starred Emma Roberts and Dave Franco, but local comedian Eric D’Alessandro also made an appearance in the flick.\n\n29. MARVEL’S ‘SPIDERMAN: HOMECOMING’ (2017)\n\nHey, 15 milliseconds of fame is better than nothing, right? In December 2016, the trailer for the Marvel Studios film “Spider-Man: Homecoming” aired on Jimmy Kimmel Live!\n\nWhile most superhero enthusiasts were pumped to see the new face of the comic classic, Tom Holland, and Robert Downey Jr. returning to his role as Tony Stark (aka Iron Man), Staten Islanders were happy to see the film had local ties.\n\nAfter the two-minute mark, the trailer catches the Staten Island Ferry under attack and held together by the superhero himself.\n\n30. THE IRISHMAN (2017)\n\nMartin Scorsese wanted an extra dose of Staten Island in his feature film, which is why some scenes in “The Irishman” were shot in the borough.\n\nA scene that caused major attention at the time was one filmed outside of Lee’s Tavern with its awning in costume as “Nemo’s Bar & Grill” — and Karine’s Beauty Salon. The scene included the explosion of a car on the streets of Dongan Hills.\n\n31. ‘WONDER WHEEL’ (2018)\n\nWoody Allen used the Chinese Scholar’s Garden — and Snug Harbor’s quaint cottages for costume changes — when Oscar winner Kate Winslet and pop superstar/actor Justin Timberlake shot “Wonder Wheel” on the Livingston campus.\n\nWe didn’t catch of glimpse of Kate or JT when they filmed in October 2016, because they didn’t walk from building to building. They were “shuttled” in one of the vans and/or a black, shiny Mercedes S500 visible around the set.\n\nBut we did snag a photo of Allen’s visit to DaNoi Restaurant in Rosebank, where he dined when the film’s shoot started. He’s pictured below with restaurant manager Jimmy Medovic and patron Dominick Calla.\n\n32. ‘THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHER’ (2018)\n\nWhy was Maggie Gyllenhaal changing her clothes in the Staten Island Ferry bathroom? We’re still not sure, but it was all part of the premise of “The Kindergarten Teacher,” which released on Netflix.\n\n“You can imagine how difficult it was to finance this movie,” Gyllenhaal said, according to From The Grapevine. “I was changing my clothes in the bathroom of the Staten Island Ferry. Nobody should be naked in the bathroom of the Staten Island Ferry.”\n\n33. ‘THE KING OF STATEN ISLAND’ (2020)"
