        "text": "Aviation Films: Can Watching Movies Help You Learn to Fly?\n\nWouldn’t it be great if you could sit down and watch a long list of entertaining aviation movies starring your favorite actors, and, as a bonus, you would learn how to fly?\n\nWell, we can’t say that will happen, but if you’re a flight student who is learning English, you just might want to check out this list of aviation movies.

Watch Catch Me If You Can starring Leonardo DiCaprio, and see if you can spot a major aviation blooper. Here’s a hint: The blooper occurs near the end of the film.\n\nSo, whether you’re watching aviation films to improve your English comprehension or watching them because you simply love airplanes, we hope you enjoy a few of these films!"
