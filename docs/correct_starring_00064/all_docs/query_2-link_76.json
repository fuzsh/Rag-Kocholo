        "text": "Austin Powers is a series of American spy comedy films created as an overt parody of numerous films, including the James Bond franchise. The Austin Powers franchise is a trilogy written by Mike Myers and directed by Jay Roach. If you also want to enjoy this trilogy, here is the Austin Powers movie order and where to watch them.\n\nAustin Powers movie follows a British spy’s quest to thwart his arch-nemesis but also incorporates popular themes, including time travel, apocalypse, espionage, and family secrets. The Austin Powers movies are comedic and action-packed, but their constant references to pop culture are what makes them timeless classics.\n\nAustin Powers movie order\n\nIf you are in the mood for action and light-hearted comedy, watch the Austin Powers movies and enjoy their fascinating thrill. The franchise is full of daunting spy moves, star cameos, pretty ladies, and action–a recipe that will keep you yearning to re-watch it. Here is the correct Austin Powers watch order in the trilogy.\n\nAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997)\n\nIMDb rating: 7.0/10\n\nRun time: 1h 29m\n\nAustin Powers: International Man of Mystery was released on 22 October 1997, and is the first Austin Powers movie. The film stars Mike Myers as Austin Powers–a hipster and photographer by day and a crime-fighting secret agent by night.\n\nIt is set in the 1960s and more or less parodies the James Bond franchise and other aspects of 60s popular culture. The film's protagonist Dr. Evil returns to Earth after hiding in space for 30 years to steal nuclear weapons and demands that the British Ministry of Defense pay him $1 billion.\n\nThe cryogenically preserved British secret agent Austin Powers is revived in the present day and reinstated to active service.\n\nPowers, once synonymous with style and an irresistible charm towards women, soon discovers that his vocabulary, style, and fashion sense are hopelessly outdated.\n\nHe thus enlists the help of a modern woman (Mrs. Kensington) to ease his integration into the 1990s culture–a move that helps him vanquish his old adversary, Dr. Evil.\n\nAgainst its $16 million budget, the film was a box office hit with critical and commercial success–grossing over $67 million. It is also considered one of the most successful movies, which even triggered its 1999 sequel.\n\nAustin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)\n\nIMDb rating: 6.6/10\n\nRun time: 1h 35m\n\nIn this sequel to the 1997 film, Mike Myers returns as the groovy super spy in Austin Powers' second instalment, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.\n\nSoon after the events of the Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, the British super agent Powers, a role once again played by Myers, discovers that his arch-nemesis Dr. Evil is out for revenge.\n\nHe sets up a powerful laser and aims to destroy the planet. In his fiendish scheme, he also manages to steal Austin's “mojo,” as well as everything he cherishes, including his libido, swagger, and charm.\n\nAustin Powers realizes he must also time-travel back to the 1960s to retrieve his “mojo.” Along the way, Myers battles several gorgeous swimming-clad secret agents, but with the help of agent Felicity Shagwell, he hits his comedic and riotous best while facing off his vicious arch-nemeses.\n\nThe film became the most successful movie in the trilogy, racking up $312 million worldwide, and has the Best Makeup Academy Award under its belt.\n\nGiven its commercial success, it is probably the best Austin Powers film to watch. But as is the case with any movie with a prequel or sequel, it is best to watch the Austin Powers movies in order from the first to the last.\n\nAustin Powers in Goldmember (2002)\n\nIMDb rating: 6.2/10\n\nRun time: 1h 34m\n\nAustin Powers in Goldmember was released on July 26, 2002, as the third instalment in the Austin Powers film series. In this spy comedy film that parodies James Bond, Mike Myers stars in four different roles, but the film largely keeps the cast from the previous films.\n\nThe story begins soon after Austin’s biggest enemies–Dr. Evil and his tiny partner in crime, Mini-Me break out of a maximum-security prison.\n\nTeaming up with a rather peculiar Goldmember, the criminal duo hatches a scheme to take over the world. Dr. Evil decides to kidnap Nigel Powers, England's most renowned super spy and Austin's father.\n\nAfter the events of Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin decides to travel back in time to find some answers. He stops in 1975 to team up with Foxxy Cleopatra, a streetwise detective and Austin's old flame, with whom they have to rescue Nigel and thwart Dr. Evil from their bloody mischief.\n\nLike the first two films in the trilogy, Austin Powers in Goldmember was a commercial and critical success, grossing $73 million at the box office for the opening weekend.\n\nIf the critical success of the first and second films is anything to go by, then it will be worth it to add this movie to your watchlist.\n\nChronological order of Austin Powers movies\n\nThe Austin Powers franchise is a trilogy, and here is the list of the order of Austin Powers movies and their release dates to enhance your watching experience.\n\nOrderMovieYear1Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery19972Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me19993Austin powers in Goldmember2002\n\nWhere to watch Austin Powers movies\n\nTo watch all the Austin Powers movies, you can access them on Prime Video, Vudu, or on your Roku device.
