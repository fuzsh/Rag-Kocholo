        "text": "Barbara Feldon, 90, is discussing her life and career. The co-star of Get Smart (1965-70) last year came out with a memoir, Getting Smarter. This week, the SpyHards podcast posted an interview with Feldon.\n\nThe spy show comedy won Emmys. It was devised as a mix of James Bond and Inspector Clouseau (both were popular in the 1960s). Maxwell Smart (Don Adams) stumbled and bumbled his way through assignments, helped by Agent 99 (Feldon). The show was created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry.\n\n“99 stepped out of the Bond mold,” Feldon said in the SpyHards interview. “Agent 99 changed the female factor. She was not just all boobs and hips and sex object…They moved the chess pieces forward.”\n\nFeldon told SpyHards that playing 99 didn’t pay that well (no figures were specified) but did provide financial security beyond Get Smart.\n\nFor a time, Feldon said people would treat her as a big star. “I really knew this was temporary. It’s fine but don’t get too stuck on it.”\n\nFeldon also said she passed on doing a cameo in the 2008 Get Smart theatrical film. Don Adams died in 2005 and Feldon said she was not interested without Adams as part of the project.\n\n“I thought I had my time,” Feldon said. “I wasn’t going to mess around with it.”\n\nOddly enough, there was an earlier Get Smart theatrical film, 1980’s The Nude Bomb. Adams was the star but Feldon’s 99 was left out. Adams and Feldon were reunited in a 1989 TV movie, Get Smart Again!\n\nIn the SpyHards interview, Feldon also commented being a guest star on The Man From U.N.C.L.E. On that series, she played an “innocent,” an U.N.C.L.E. translator who inadvertently finds herself in peril.\n\n“It was the third television series I ever did,” Feldon said. “It was the show on the air. I was so intimidated in one sense and thrilled…It was fun. ‘I’m on The Man From U.N.C.L.E., I can’t believe it.'”\n\nFor the full SpyHards interview, CLICK HERE.\n\nFor the Amazon listing of Getting Smarter, CLICK HERE.\n\nFor Barbara Feldon’s interview with the Archive of American Television, CLICK HERE.\n\nFor an audio version of this post, CLICK HERE.\n\nFiled under: The Other Spies | Tagged: Barbara Feldon, Buck Henry, Don Adams, Get Smart, Get Smart Again!, Mel Brooks, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., The Nude Bomb | 1 Comment »\n\nWith the passing of David McCallum, the blog decided to look at the surviving stars of the 1960s spy craze.\n\nIn no particular order:\n\nBarbara Bain (b. 1931): Bain played Cinammon Carter, the original woman operative of the Impossible Missions Force on Mission: Impossible.\n\nBain won three Emmys for the role, twice beating out Diana Rigg of The Avengers. She departed the series after three seasons when her then-husband, Martin Landau, was forced off the show. Bain’s exit was a major blow to the series. She reprised the role in a 1997 episode of Diagnosis: Murder.\n\nPeter Lupus (b. 1932): Lupus played Willy Armitage, another original M:I cast member. Willy was a bodybuilder of some renown, whose strength was useful (such as carry nuclear warheads in the pilot). He also helped IMF electronics whiz Barney Collier (Greg Morris) a lot. At one point, the producers wanted to phase Willy out. But Lupus and his character were so popular, that didn’t happen.\n\nBarbara Feldon (b. 1933): Feldon was agent 99 of CONTROL in Get Smart. She was already popular via commercials when she got the part. Feldon’s popularity expanded with Get Smart. Feldon even recorded a song simply titled “99.”\n\nBill Cosby (b. 1937): Cosby has been both famous and infamous (the latter for allegations of sexual assault). But in the mid-1960s, I Spy, which starred Robert Culp and Cosby, was a major show — both for entertainment and for racial integration. Culp and Cosby were equals on the show.\n\nLinda Thorson (b. 1947): The actress played Tara King, John Steed’s final partner in the original version of The Avengers.\n\nGeorge Lazenby (b. 1939): Lazenby’s one turn as James Bond closed out the 1960s with On Her Majesty’s Secret Service in 1969. The male model won the role over a lot of competition. But he didn’t stick around for a second turn as 007. Lazenby, however, did an homage to the role in the 1983 TV movie The Return of the Man From U.N.C.L.E.\n\nJoanna Lumley (b. 1946): She squeezes in as one of the “angels of death” in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. In the 1970s, she’d be another one of John Steed’s partners in The New Avengers.\n\nStefanie Powers (b. 1942): Star of The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. Her character name, April Dancer, was courtesy of Ian Fleming, part of his handwritten notes to producer Norman Felton in October 1962. The name was used after NBC insisted on an U.N.C.L.E. spinoff.\n\nRobert Wagner (b. 1930): Star of It Takes a Thief where a master thief works for U.S. intelligence.\n\nMichael Caine (b. 1933): Star of three film adaptations of Len Deighton spy novels. Bond producer Harry Saltzman also produced these films. Some Bond crew members also worked on them.\n\nFiled under: James Bond Films, The Other Spies | Tagged: Barbara Bain, Barbara Feldon, Bill Cosby, George Lazenby, Get Smart, I Spy, Joanna Lumley, Linda Thorson, Mission: Impossible, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Peter Lupus, the Avengers, The New Avengers | 4 Comments »\n\nWith the passing of actor Robert Vaughn, a natural reaction for fans would be to view some episodes of The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\n\nThis list was originally devised last year ahead of the 2015 movie version. It was intended for people not familiar with the series.\n\nIt’s still a good list of episodes to view, even for long-time fans.\n\nThese aren’t necessarily the very best episodes. But the list was intended to include examples from all four seasons of the show. Stories told over two episodes are listed as a single entry here.\n\nThe Quadripartite Affair/The Giuoco Piano Affair: These two episodes were filmed together but presented as separate, but related episodes.\n\nQuadripartite was the third episode broadcast. It’s also the first episode where Napoleon Solo (Robert Vaughn) and Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum) function as a team. There’s plenty of good “bits of business” for both characters.\n\nThe story involves a power-hungry woman, Gervaise Ravel (Anne Francis), whose lover, Harold Bufferton (John Van Dreelan), is one of the world’s richest men and who’s more than willing to finance her plans. That’s not unlike the new film, where Elizabeth Debicki, is the lead villain.\n\nGiuoco Piano (the seventh episode broadcast) is even better than Quadripartite, showing how manipulative Solo can be. The title comes from a chess gambit that symbolizes Solo’s plan. If James Bond is the blunt instrument, this story demonstrates how Solo is the sharp operator.\n\nBoth episodes were written by Alan Caillou, who did intelligence work for the British in World War II. Think an Ian Fleming, who actually went out into the field. Caillou’s two scripts helped define the Kuryakin character. Sam Rolfe, who wrote the pilot, envisioned Kuryakin as a large, massive man. Caillou provided McCallum with the material so the actor could make Illya his own.\n\nAlso, the two episodes were directed by Richard Donner, who’d become an A-list film director in the 1970s.\n\nThe Never-Never Affair: Through the first season, the show tried to find the right balance of drama and humor. Never-Never, aired late in the season, became the model for future episodes.\n\nIn the story, Solo feels sorry for U.N.C.L.E. translator Mandy Stevenson (Barbara Feldon), who yearns for an adventure. He sends her to get pipe tobacco for U.N.C.L.E. chief Waverly (Leo G. Carroll), while telling her she’s acting as a courier. However, she accidentally is given a valuable microdot covered by the villainous organization, Thrush.\n\nThe episode includes a memorable set piece, where a Thrush assassin is firing through a movie theater screen at Solo and Kuryakin, who are having to deal with other Thrush operatives. A high percentage of the jokes work, and writer Dean Hargrove would become one of the main scribes of the series. It was the second episode of show helmed by Joseph Sargent, one of the best directors on the series.\n\nThe Foxes and Hounds Affair: A breezy episode that aired early in the show’s second season. The new movie’s tone is supposed to be similar to the second season and Foxes and Hounds is one of the season’s better entries.\n\nU.N.C.L.E. and Thrush are both after a mind-reading machine. That’s pretty fantastic, but no more so than what can be seen in a Marvel Studios film of the 21st century. Both Solo and Kuryakin get chances to shine. We also see that Waverly is perfectly capable of being cold blooded. On top of everything else, Vincent Price is a very good villain who has to watch his back for attacks from a rival in Thrush (Patricia Medina).\n\nThe Concrete Overcoat Affair: This two-part episode was edited into a movie for international audiences called The Spy in the Green Hat. Thrush has another ambitious plan that U.N.C.L.E. is trying to foil. But some retired gangsters end up becoming involved and act as a wild card.\n\nThis ran during the third season, when the drama-humor balance got out of whack in favor of humor. This Joseph Sargent-directed story reins that in to an extent. There’s also a good scene early in Part II where Solo wants to go save Kuryakin but Waverly disapproves. The U.N.C.L.E. chief relents, but only reluctantly. It’s an unusual moment of drama in a season where that was in short supply.\n\nThe Test Tube Killer Affair: In the fourth season, new producer Anthony Spinner wanted to dial the humor way back. This episode, early in the season, is one of the better entries produced by Spinner.\n\nThrush’s Dr. Stoller (Paul Lukas) has been raising young men from childhood to be the perfect killing machines, able to turn their emotions on and off as needed. Stoller’s prize pupil, Greg Martin (Christopher Jones), has been chosen to blow up a dam in Greece. It’s strictly an exercise and the dam has no strategic importance but many will die if Martin succeeds.\n\nMeanwhile, the young killer is highly intelligent — intelligent enough where it appears Solo and Kuryakin may have met their match. The episode has a less-than-happy ending, something not common on the show.\n\nFiled under: The Other Spies | Tagged: Alan Caillou, Anthony Spinner, Barbara Feldon, Cesar Romero, Christopher Jones, David McCallum, Dean Hargrove, Joseph Sargent, Patricia Medina, Paul Lukas, Richard Donner, Robert Vaughn, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., Vincent Price | 2 Comments »\n\nThis week marks the 50th anniversary of spymania in the United States, when three spy television series premiered.\n\nI Spy (Sept. 15): The hour-long drama on NBC was the most serious, least escapist spy program on U.S. television. Its greater significance, however, was having an African American actor receiving equal billing with a white star.\n\nThat African American actor was Bill Cosby. Cosby has been in the news since last year for numerous accusations of rape, the subject of a notable cover of New York magazine this summer.\n\nA half century ago, Cosby’s presence on I Spy was a major breakthrough for U.S. television. The show debuted in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nRobert Culp, the show’s other star, also wrote episodes that gave Cosby’s Alexander Scott plenty to do and Cosby ample opportunity to show his acting ability.\n\n“People writing…said that I was the Jackie Robinson of television drama,” Cosby said during a 2010 appearance. “I say to all of you if this true that Robert Culp has to be Eddie Stanky, Pee Wee Reese.” He said Culp’s “contribution in I Spy was very valuable in terms of civil rights.”\n\nBesides the show’s social significance, I Spy also had extensive location filming. The lead actors accompanied a small crew that actually traveled to places such as Hong Kong and Tokyo to film exteriors. That footage would be paired with interior scenes shot at stages leased from Desilu Studios.\n\nThe Wild Wild West (Sept. 17): The show was originally pitched to CBS as something like “James Bond and cowboys.” It became something much greater.\n\nThe series concerned the adventures of ace U.S. Secret Service agents James West (Robert Conrad) and Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin). They traveled in style on a train.\n\nThey traveled a lot taking on, among other foes, a 19th century cyborg (John Dehner); Dr. Loveless (Michael Dunn), a short scientist with major plans, such as wiping out the world’s population to restore ecological balance; and Count Manzeppi (Victor Buono), a villain whose magic tricks might not be tricks at all.\n\nHighlights included Conrad frequently fighting a roomful of thugs. In reality, it was usually the same group of stuntmen and it took ingenuity to disguise that fact from the audience. Also a highlight was Martin donning various disguises.\n\nThe Wild Wild West really was catching lightning in a bottle. Attempts to recapture the magic (made-for television movies in 1979 and 1980 as well as a 1999 feature film) fell short.\n\nGet Smart (Sept. 18): The half-hour comedy created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry originally was developed for ABC with Tom Poston in mind. The network rejected it. NBC, looking for a show for Don Adams, snapped it up.\n\nBrooks and Henry revamped the script to adapt it for Adams. For example, Adams had already perfected his “would you believe?” bit, using it on The Bill Dana Show situation comedy series. Thus, it was incorporated into the Get Smart pilot.\n\nAdams’ Maxwell Smart was a force of nature. He bumbled his way through his adventures but, always confident in himself, emerged triumphant. It helped to have Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon) on his side.\n\nGet Smart, naturally, parodied the spy genre, including one episode that did a takeoff on I Spy. But the series had other targets, including an episode that parodied The Fugitive. There have been various attempts over the decades to revive Get Smart, most recently a 2008 feature film with Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway.\n\nFiled under: The Other Spies | Tagged: 50th anniversary of U.S. TV spymania, Anne Hathaway, Barbara Feldon, Bill Cosby, Buck Henry, Don Adams, Get Smart, I Spy, Mel Brooks, Robert Conrad, Robert Culp, Ross Martin, Steve Carell, The Wild Wild West, Tom Poston | 2 Comments »\n\nThe Man From U.N.C.L.E. hasn’t gotten a lot of exposure since its last broadcast on Jan. 15, 1968. Yet, seemingly against long odds, a big-screen version comes out on Aug. 14.\n\nThere are a lot of new fans — particularly those who are fans of actors Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer — who haven’t had a lot of opportunity to catch the original show. With that in mind, here are five U.N.C.L.E. stories from the 1964-68 series that may enhance the experience of new fans ahead of the film.\n\nThese aren’t necessarily the very best episodes. But some have elements in common with the movie. Also, this list is intended to include examples from all four seasons of the show. Stories told over two episodes are listed as a single entry here.\n\nThe Quadripartite Affair/The Giuoco Piano Affair: These two episodes were filmed together but presented as separate, but related episodes.\n\nQuadripartite was the third episode broadcast.

But it’s actually only the latest twist in a spy property that’s had its ups and downs when it came to the subject of height.\n\nIt began with executive producer Norman Felton, who began work on U.N.C.L.E. in 1962. The 1950s and the early 1960s were a period when Westerns, with stars such as 6-foot-7 James Arness and 6-foot-6 Clint Walker, dominated U.S. television. Even in other genres, other stars might be tall. Felton himself had cast 6-foot-1 Richard Chamberlain as the title character in the television version of Dr. Kildare.\n\nFelton, in a 1997 interview (portions of which can be seen on U.N.C.L.E. DVD extras), said he wanted a different type of lead character for U.N.C.L.E. and not “big, ballsy men.” He was looking for heroes who were more average looking.\n\nEventually, the producer cast 5-foot-10 Robert Vaughn as Napoleon Solo (who had worked on the Felton-produced The Lieutenant) and 5-foot-8 David McCallum as Illya Kuryakin. They were hardly runts, but definitely not built like Arness’s Matt Dillon.\n\nSupposedly, according to dossiers held by the evil Thrush organization (in The Thrush Roulette Affair in the show’s FOURTH SEASON), Solo the character was 6-foot while Kuryakin was 5-foot-10 1/2.\n\nThrush clearly had some faulty information. In the FIRST SEASON episode The Never-Never Affair, 5-foot-8 1/2 guest star Barbara Feldon wears flat shoes to appear shorter than the leads. Even wearing the flat shoes, there is an Act II scene where her Mandy Stevenson character is clearly taller than McCallum’s Kuryakin.\n\nThat doesn’t mean McCallum was insecure was his height. The late writer-actor Stanley Ralph Ross, in a 1997 INTERVIEW with THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. EPISODE GUIDE said McCallum used his height to his advantage in a scene where Ross played a thug.\n\nQuestion: What was it like for you a pretty tall fellow, working with a somewhat shorter David McCallum?\n\nRoss: David asked me to stand on a box. I am already 6-6 and said that he would look like a midget but he replied the taller I was, the stronger and more macho he would seem for having beaten me up.\n\nThe Man From U.N.C.L.E. began almost 50 years ago but even in the 21st Century, height or the lack of it can still create a stir. In 2005, Amy Pascal, a Sony Pictures executive, told THE NEW YORK TIMES that the newly cast 007 Daniel Craig “is tall. He’s the same size as Sean Connery.” Craig is 5-foot-10 while Connery is 6-foot-2 and change. Eight years later, the subject doesn’t come up that much, at least with Craig.\n\nIn any case, U.N.C.L.E. fans have been buzzing about the possibility about a new movie, and are getting worked up whether Cruise and Hammer have the right look, etc. For now, we’ll bide our time and have a cocktail — maybe a short one — while we wait for things to develop.\n\nFiled under: The Other Spies | Tagged: A movie version of The Man From U.N.C.L.E.?, Amy Pascal, Armie Hammer, Barbara Feldon, Daniel Craig, David McCallum, Nikki Finke's Deadline Web site, Norman Felton, Robert Vaughn, Stanley Ralph Ross, The Man From U.N.C.L.E, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. episode guide, The Other Spies, Tom Cruise | 6 Comments »\n\nApril 13, besides being the birthday of the literary James Bond, is also the birthday of one of the better known actors from the 1960s spy craze: Don Adams, who played Maxwell Smart on Get Smart, the 1965-1970 spy comedy.\n\nHe was born April 13, 1923, according to his IMDB.COM BIOGRAPHY. As we’ve written before, Adams wasn’t the first choice to play Maxwell Smart.\n\nThe show was originally developed with Tom Poston as the lead character. But it was rejected by ABC, where executives were not amused by the Mel Brooks-Buck Henry script, which included a dwarf as a villain called Mr. Big. All this came out in interviews Poston and producer Leonard Stern made for the Archive of American Television decades later.\n\nShortly after the ABC rejection, a crestfallen Mel Brooks encountered an NBC executive who asked the writer what was wrong. Brooks told the story of his unsold pilot. As it turned out, NBC had Don Adams under contract and had to pay him until the network could find Adams a show. NBC, thus, was now very interested. Brooks and Henry worked in Adams’ “Would you believe?” routine and other changes. Michael Dunn, soon to be the villainous Dr. Loveless on The Wild, Wild West, brought Mr. Big to life.\n\nGet Smart was one of the most successful of the ’60s spy shows, running five full seasons (four on NBC, one on CBS). It was revived as a 1980 theatrical movie starring Adams, The Nude Bomb (which didn’t include Barbara Feldon as Agent 99) and a later television movie Get Smart Again (this time with Feldon). There was also another short lived Get Smart television series on Fox.\n\nThe concept was brought back in 2008 with Steve Carell in another theatrical movie. This one insisted on providing a backstory for Max, where he had once been an obese back-office employee who dreamed of being an agent, etc., etc. In the original, there was no attempt to explain Max; he simply was.\n\nThe 2008 film did OK at the box office, with with $230 million in worldwide ticket sales. But Steve Carell didn’t make anybody forget Don Adams, who had died three years earlier. As it turned out, that would be impossible.\n\nFor Warner Bros., which released the ’08 movie, the box office wasn’t good enough to order up a sequel. Sorry about that, Chief.\n\nFiled under: The Other Spies | Tagged: 2008 Get Smart movie, ABC, Barbara Feldon, Buck Henry, Don Adams, Get Smart, Get Smart Again!, Mel Brooks, Michael Dunn, NBC, Steve Carell, The Nude Bomb, The Other Spies, Tom Poston, TV spy shows, Warner Bros., Would you believe...Tom Poston was the first choice to play Maxwell Smart | 2 Comments »"
