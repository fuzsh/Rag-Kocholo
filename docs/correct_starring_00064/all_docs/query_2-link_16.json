        "text": "Here's my post from the 'Upcoming Films' thread, on the subject:\n\nWell, as the web goes crazy with this AP news, here's what the ever reliable Deadline has to say: http://www.deadline.com/2011/08/whats-really-happening-with-mike-myers-and-austin-powers-4/\n\nIn short, no deal has been done yet though one had been put out to Myres - six months ago - and only now is he showing interest in it. Weird.\n\nAlso it seems a signed 2008 deal for a fouth film didn't happen, so no wonder New Line seem to have given up on the idea and aren't holding their breath this time round.\n\nYou've also got to ask after 10+ years is there any point to bringing it back? Myres will soon be 50 and honestly how many of these \"resurrected\" franchises have really worked? I count one: Die Hard.\n\nI reckon there's a strong chance of a(nother) signed deal going nowhere - we'll see.\n\nDoes anyone else find it ironic that a film series that poked fun at how \"predictable\" the Bond series ended up in just 3 films being just as \"predictable\" and \"tired\" as the films they were poking fun at? Sure it'd be one thing if the story flowed in the same formula but all of the jokes used in Goldmember were almost exactly the same as the previous two. Atleast Bond took 7 or 8 films before they started recyling their material.\n\nA new one? It's missed it's target by 12 years.\n\nPossibly, but I think it's a great opportunity for them to parody the newly rebooted Craig era Bond, which would not have been possible had they done a 4th film soon after their 2002 entry. I think we'll be seeing a lot of references to the gritty Craig era in AP4, just like we're seeing in Johnny English 2.\n\nA new one?

I think we'll be seeing a lot of references to the gritty Craig era in AP4, just like we're seeing in Johnny English 2.\n\nHow could possibly parody the new Craig era? James Bond can change and people will accept as they're action films. But comedies can't stray too far from what got them laughs in the first place. And why do all these films have to parody Bond? Can't they think of there own stuff. Mike Myers is probably pushing this considering how he hasn't had any live-action hits since his Austin Powers films. Yeah he was the voice of Shreck but that was just his voice. The Love Guru flopped pretty badly.\n\nA new one?

Yeah he was the voice of Shreck but that was just his voice. The Love Guru flopped pretty badly.\n\nNail. On. The. Head.\n\nThat's the issue with doing another film. One, what would you do? Two, will the audience be there over ten years later?\n\nEven if a deal is done I could still see this fading away. It just seems to be the \"in thing\" of the last few days.\n\nThis is a classic case of a fading star desperately hoping that a return to a popular former character will bring back his box office mojo (pun intended). Like Stallone with Rocky and Rambo, Ford with Indiana Jones, Myers with Shrek...\n\nI think that Austin Powers' time is past unless they do a fish out of water comedy with him lost inside a gritty Bourne-style film. Which may not be as funny as it sounds...\n\nI completley agree. Austin Powers isn't a timeless character and really belongs in the 90s. Yes, the last one came out in 2002 but by then the series felt tired and worn out. It was kinda original when the first one came out but honestly I don't think there should have been any more after the first movie. I never thought they were that funny to begin with and were a one-trick pony that for some reason became the flavor of the month.\n\nMy hunch is that if this gets made during this time period, it would spoof re-boots. You know, because there's all these re-boots / beginning stories these days and Austin Powers 4, after a decade, would be a reboot / beginning story itself, which would mean that it would also spoof itself spoofing all these... Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed\n\nAnyway, Dr. Evil was much better character than Austin. Much funnier.\n\nMy hunch is that if this gets made during this time period, it would spoof re-boots.

Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed\n\nIt could be a reboot but just look at your post @SharkBait, right there are the reasons why this wouldn't work. AP already spoofed itself by the third film anyway, so another would, wow, be an absolute mess. Imagine working out those plot points...\n\nAnyone attempting to write such a thing would go cross eyed at the prospect of a spoof reboot spoof! ;-)\n\nEnough things to spoof:\n\nNo gunbarrel.\n\nNo Q\n\nNo Moneypenny.\n\nMovie starts of in toilet/Black & White\n\nBlond Bond discussion when Daniel Craig be introduced.\n\nDaniel Craig his ''Monkey'' behaviour and body in CR. (Or the other way around: Cowboys & Aliens) If there wil with a reference to DAD when Bond enter the hotel. Of course Johnny English 2 spoof a part of this hairy Bond already.\n\nEnd the movie with: Powers Austin Powers. A small gun insteed of a big one or mabey the one from CR whasn't big enough.\n\nWe have people everywhere.\n\nCamile don't end with Bond: The spy who NOT shagged me\n\nTitle sugestion. The Austin Powerless of Solace.\n\nEnough things to spoof:\n\nNo gunbarrel.\n\nNo Q\n\nNo Moneypenny.\n\nMovie starts of in toilet/Black & White\n\nBlond Bond discussion when Daniel Craig be introduced.\n\nDaniel Craig his ''Monkey'' behaviour and body in CR.

There is ofcourse, many things to parody about any Bond film, but this is genius!\n\nI must say, I`m a little suprised that some people here are unwilling to have the mickey taken out of our favourite franchise....? Lighten up guys, it`s just the movies!"
