        "text": "The epitome of the handsome and debonair Hollywood star, actor Robert Wagner - known to friends as \"R.J.\" - played romantic heroes and upstanding young men in a string of mostly unmemorable 1950s and 1960s-era features, before finding lasting fame as one of television's smoothest leading men. Wagner brought old-school class to the ABC action drama \"It Takes a Thief\" (ABC, 1968-1970) and, more importantly, showed a knack for light comedy with his roles in \"Switch\" (CBS, 1975-1980) and \"Hart to Hart\" (ABC, 1979-1984). He also made headlines in his personal life; most notably for being one-half of one of Hollywood's most beloved couples after marrying the beautiful Natalie Wood not once, but twice. It was her mysterious death by drowning in November 1981 which sealed their legend and caused an outpouring of love and support for the actor. This goodwill carried over year after year as the veteran actor aged gracefully, settled into a happy marriage with actress Jill St. John, and was always welcomed warmly with numerous appearances on both the big and small screens; most memorably as Mike Myers's Number Two in the \"Austin Powers\" film franchise. Yet the stain of Wood's mysterious death never left Wagner's public image, as rumors that the couple fought on board the boat resurfaced periodically in the press. In early 2018, Wagner was unofficially termed a person of interest in Wood's death, amid reports that Wagner's official story about the night in question had shifted in police interviews."
