        "text": "Although heralded as one of the heroes of Pakistan's 1992 World Cup triumph due to his match winning knocks of 60 in just 37 deliveries in the semi-finals against New Zealand and 42 in just 35 deliveries in the finals against England at the MCG, his overall World Cup statistics over the next four editions of the tournament weren't anything noteworthy as his overall average in tournament matches was below 30.\n\nImmediately announced his retirement from international cricket following Pakistan's ouster from the 2007 World Cup due to being beaten by associate member team Ireland coupled with the suspicious death of coach Bob Woolmer. Haq quoted that he looked upon Woolmer like a father figure and dedicated the dead rubber victory over Zimbabwe in Woolmer's memory."
