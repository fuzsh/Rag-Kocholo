        "text": "Mr. sherrif, The following commentry is just an extension to the earlier subject of Zanzibar and Cricket and now on the subcontinent. I have to state quite succintly up-front that I differ, or more like, I totally disagree with one of the statements that you've made under: Chapter Two, Subcontinent, where you made the following comments: \"The one person Khoja Ithnashris need be proud of is Mohamedali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, for he was one of them....\" As an Nizari Ismaili Muslim (a Khoja- Ismaili in your vernacular), I kind of felt very offended to have read such an ill-advised statements like these coming from a person of your caliber, who I thought should have been \"better\" informed and rather well-versed with the history of the partition history of the Indian sub-continent. I don't claim to be an authority on the subject matter of \"The partition of the Indian subcontinent\", but nevertheless, I can state outright over here that the statement you've made is erroneous, simply because what you've written is just NOT true. Yes, I will somewhat agree with you that, Mr. Qaid-e-Azam, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, did play: call it a significant, vital role in the creation of Pakistan, but to outright call him to be the founder of Pakistan, is just NOT correct at all. In fact, today, if you were to put forth the same question to say the late Mohandas Ghandhi, or Jawalal Nehru, or even Mohammad Ali Jinnah, or SIr Zafrullah Khan or any of the political leaders, past or present, of Pakistan or India, as to name the ONE and ONLY PERSON who they think is responsible for the creation of BOTH India and Pakistan (look I have said both India and Pakistan and NOT just Pakistan), then I can assure with 110% certainty, that they will name none other than The one and only H. H. Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III. Look, I want to state here that the foregoing statement I've made is NOT, and I repeat, NOT based on prejudicial statement, based solely because I'm a Nizari Ismaili and because HE was the 48th-Imam of the Nizari Ismailis sect, but rather, my statement is based on correct historial fact of the Partitioning History of the Indian Subcontinent. Look, I don't won't to go into the depths and breadths of the History of the Partitioning of the Indian subcontinent here, but if there was any ONE single entity in a person, Hindu or Muslim, during the British Raj in India BEFORE the Partition, who had ANY sort of influence, over the British Government - be it the King or Queen or Prime Minister - in Great Britain at that time, it was NONE other than His Highness Aga Khan III. After having read numerous memos, speeches, articles on the movement of the Indian-Muslim League before the partition, memoirs of The Aga Khan III and his Presidency tenure with the League of Nations, the history of the Hindu Movement in India led under the late Mohandas Ghandhi, I'm now totally convinced ever than before that this one person in His Highness Aga Khan III was the ONLY PERSON who was SINGULARLY responsible for the CREATION of the TWO nations: One India and the other: Pakistan. One for Hindus and the other for Muslims. If it wasn't for him then, I personally think that it would have taken the then-India would have taken a long time gain independence from their British Masters. And yet, today, His Highness The Aga Khan III, after his tiresless efforts in creating these TWO nations, is NOT recognized in EITHER one of these countries. Instead, credit is given to the late: Mohandas Ghandhi as the father oor creator of India, and Mohammad Ali Jinnah as the father of Pakistan - how pitiful! The present Aga Khan IV, His Highness Shah Karim al-Husainy, the spiritual leader of the present Nizari Ismailis sect, was put forth this very same question by a reporter in India, and his reply to this question was that my Grandfather, Aga Khan III, NEVER ever asked for any kind of recognition from either of these respective governments. We, the Imams of our times, have taken upon ourselves to work for the betterment of the whole mankind! His tireless efforts even today times when there is so much turmoil in today's world is seen to bore the fruits for the whole of Mankind and not just Muslims or Hindus or any other sect for that matter. I will end my arguments here after having stated my argument. sincerely Alnoor Thank you for the memories.... I was an avid cricket fan, alongside my dad, Fateh Mawji (deceased 1991), who, for the longest time, was the manager for AgaKhan Club 'B' (formerly Dar Cricketers). I was pleasantly surprised to see your reference to him in your article on Naaz Bandali. I was not aware of any acknowledgement to his efforts before reading your article online. It brought tears to my eyes to see the flashbacks to the good old cricketeering days. The community back then, while being fiercely competitive on the field, was also a brotherhood off field. Shakir Sherali was my neighbour down the road, and I will always respect the finer points of being a gentleman displayed by Bashir Tejani and Mohamed Nathoo. I also had the good fortune of tagging my father and being around a lot of wonderful people in the cricket community. The experience taught me a lot of values, which carry on in life. Their names be too inumerable to mention here, however, their input during my formative years lives on. I would not trade my childhood in the cricketeering community for anything! I would heckle Union during the matches on the weekends, as I was an avid AK Club supporter. However, come weekdays, when us kids used to play cricket in the alleys behind Upanga Jamaatkhana, Shakir, on his return from work, would sometimes stop by, and talk to us about cricket. His advice was always looked forward to, as he was a true sportsman, beyond his team colours. I would love to see an update on the current cricket community in Daressalaam, as it is sorely missed by all of us here in Canada. Here's an update on former players that I know of: Alnasir Hasham (Ilala): Lives in toronto. He is still a great proponent of fitness, and works part time as a fitness coach at a local gym in the area. His son, Imran, whom u made reference to in your profile on Ilala, is a prolific soccer player on the local scene. Zul Hasham (Ilala's brother): lives in the Thorncliffe area of Toronto. His son, Samir, has carried forward the family tradition of cricket, and, last I heard, was selected to represent the province of Ontario at the high school level. Bashir Ramzan: Is also in Toronto, and we reminisce about cricket's glory days whenever we run into each other. Mansour Ashadali: passed away in Toronto (May God rest his soul in peace). He will always be remembered for pushing every ball, no matter what the location of the delivery, to the LEG side. Shiraz Summar: Is in New York. Last time I saw him, was a few years back. He has shifted his focus to volleyball, and is every bit as agile as back in his heydays. Bashir Hasham: lives in toronto as well. Sadly, after a brief tenure with the Agakhan Cricket team in toronto, he has retired his bat, in favour of other endeavours. Amir Badr (PINTO): The colourful manager of AK Club, is now in toronto, after a short spell in Montreal. Both his sons have developed into exciting soccer players, and are a joy to watch on the field. I also saw Sajjad Lakha and Shabir Kaderbhai around toronto a few years ago. Not sure of their present whereabouts. I want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for the impartial portrayal in your articles, as well as for preserving the memories for all of us. I have been trying, albeit with no results, to find a site devoted to daressalaam cricket news. Would love to find out where the former cricketers are too. If anyone knows the contact information or whereabouts for Karim Jamaal (Bree), or Amirali Fidahusain (he was the wicketkeeper for AK Club back in 1990. One of the \"imports\" from pakistan), or Ayzaz Jessani,I would much appreciate if you could drop me an email. Is Mithu Thawer still around? What about Chacha that changed the scoreboards? Naaz bandali? Ganesh Nanji (G9) and the other fans? Sanju Pandya? Shakir Sherali? amin kara? Bashir Tejani? Mohamed Nathoo? Amir Nathoo? Onali Chandoo? Ranjit Bhatia? Rohit Vaja? Rashmi Raichuda? suru patel? Hitesh Patadia? the Kamania brothers? Is the fierce rivalry between Union and AK club still existing? My first coherent memory of cricket, dates back to 1979, at the kinondoni grounds, when, with the sun setting, Union's great batsman Sikander was at bat. Sumar, having replaced Ilala on the boundary, caught Sikander's effort at yet another towering Six, thereby gaining victory for Dar Cricketers. It forever left an impression in this then nine year old boy's mind. Thank you all for the memories, and thank you for what you brought to the game of cricket, as players, management, commentators, fans, and cricket lovers. It will forever be cherished in the hearts and minds of all those you touched. The precious treasure of brotherhood and values will never be forgotten. Tuesday 05/20/2003 6:01:43am Your website reminded me of the nostaligic past. Reading Mr. Norman Livesty's posting in your 'Guest Book' made me recall my frequent visits to the hospital in Zanzibar. They used to be childish excuses to run away from school and from my arithmetic teacher, the famous Ibrahim Kassim, whom the Zanzibar school boys of three generations feared and regarded as brutal though now all of us remember him fondly and with all affection, and most of us do indeed pray for him for the hidden love he bore for us which we were too ignorant to understand then! I left Zanzibar immediately after the 1964 revolution following the detention of four of my elder brothers and fled to Hadhramaut, my ancestral home, only to see another communist backed revolution in the making. I lived in Yemen for five years and when things became intolerable I fled again, precisely in Sept., 1969, but this time to the Gulf States where I have now settled down with my wife, children and a grand child as citizen of the United Arab Emirates. Regrettably since the 1964 Mapinduzi the world has been in constant turmoil, at least in every spot where I decide to start life afresh. But now I have decided to stay put in this peaceful and propserous country, come what may. I visited Zanzibar in 1993 along with my wife and our six kids, all born Arabia, who knew nothing then of Zanzibar except very little of what they heard from their father's sensational stories! My wife isn't a Zanzibari. Before we landed the kids were quite impressed with the Zanzibar arieal view and compared it with Hawai islands often displayed in Holywood films. But few days later they were disappointed and I too wasn't in a position to defend all what I have been telling my kids about Unguja since their childhood! I found everything in a mess except the weather which the revolutionists couldn't fiddle with! Whilst there I went to visit Darajani School so as to invoke the memories of the good old days - 'kutambika' as they say in the old Zanzibar Swahili. I studied in that school from 1st to 8th standard. My heart was heavy when I saw the students writing on the floor as there were no desks at all. Everyone I met in the streets of Zanzibar was living below poverty line. One guy came close to me and whispered into my ears, saying \" hizo ulizozivaa sizako tena\" referring to the clothes I was wearing. I later gave him what he asked from me and more but this made tears come out of my eyes. I also found grave changes is Swahili language. For instance, I didn't understand the meaning of the words like kuzorota (derived from Arabic word meaning 'farting'), mazingira, mkurugenzi, Karo(School fees!) and many other strange words whose meaning I never new! On my arrival, the news headline on a local newpaper, called \"MOTOMOTO\", read as follows \" Siyasa Ya Uchokozi Na Kujipanua\" (Provocative and Expansionist Policy) this alien kind of Swahili plus many other changes in the very Zanzibarian customs made me realize that the island is no longer the same one in which we used to greet one another with a slight bent and with palms placed on the position of one's heart and saying with all humility \"Msa Alkheri Bwana\". Worse, Sauti ya Unguja was no more and throug all narrow streets of Zanzibar the local radio station, based in mainland, was blurting out a mainland song \"Kumbe Kweli Safari Tabu\" instead of beautiful rendition of Abdul Basit Abdul Samad. All this was a confirmation to me that our Swahili culture was long gone. I realsied then that what actually took place on that island in January 1964 was not MAPINDUZI but \"MABIRUZI\" - watu wamebiruliwa juu chini! In this connection let me tell you that our house boy, Kombo, who joined ASP, few years before Mapinduzi, became bitter opponent of ethnic Arabs and reamined so till when we were thrown out in 1964. But four years later, while we were still in Aden, he wrote me a very interesting letter in which he praised the revolutionary government with all the praises he could think of but at the end of his letter, and in a very tiny letters, he concluded with very funny statement saying:\" Na sisi huku (in Zanzibar) tuhai mpaka leo kwa sababu tunazo roho za paka na kila mtu kabakiwa na mbili - (Signed) Mtwana Wako Kombo\" His message was clear. Kombo continued to correspond with me untill he died, his words were always full of apologies and regretts for supporting hatred that led to the breakdown of our (Zanzibar) Swahili (Cosmopolitan) Society according to his own admission. Kombo is one of the Zanzibaris whose memory will forever remain with me. Monday 01/28/2002 6:18:50pm I enjoyed going through your Memoirs. It brought back a lot of pleasant memories, in particular those of Vaddi Bhajar(Hurumzi). It was indeed a lively street and probably nicknamed �Vaddi Bhajar� by the Kutchi-speaking settlers. The rows of houses facing each other, within earshot, shops on ground level and dwellings above shops, created an atmosphere that made the early migrants feel as if they were at a home away from home. The shops in the street catered for most daily needs, such as grains, spices, and herbal medicines. Most of the goods were imported from India. Chocolates and biscuits imported from Britain were also available in our shop on the street. Our shop carried the signboard advertising Cadbury�s Chocolate over the door. In 1988 Issa, my husband, visited Zanzibar. He was shown a book in the planning department about Zanzibar streets, prepared by a team of Swedes working in Zanzibar. The book had a picture of the Cadbury�s Chocolate signboard over our front door. The Swedish architect who showed the book to Issa said that the signboard was a feature of such curiosity that it deserved to be included in the book. Name-tags were common in Zanzibar as you mentioned in your Memoirs � some no very complimentary though! Mostly they indicated businesses. In Vaddi Bhajar we had Jafu Msumari who sold nails and cement, and we had Saleh Madawa who sold herbal medicines. As children we were often sent to Chacha Saleh�s shop to buy herbal medicine. No sooner we named the ailment to him, e.g. constipation, he stretched his hand out and drew the right box from the shelf at the side or back without turning his head. He knew precisely the poisiton of the box on the shelf, and its contents. He wrapped the right amount of herbs in the paper and handed it to us. Our shop was a meeting place with Marhum Bha Taki on his chair (left on baraza day and night) presiding over the group until late at night. We had regular daily visitors from your end of the town as well as the other, Soko Mohogo. The grand chair was on the baraza for a long time after the family�s departure. In 1997 though, when I visited Zanzibar, after nearly 25 years, both the chair and the Cadbury�s signboard had disappeared. The Wednesday evening Majlis for men, and distribution of fateha to children on Thursday evening were weekly family features. Besides men, a couple of elderly women also came to Majlis regularly and we all sat in the room across from the Men�s area, with curtains drawn across the door, listening to recitations. As to Thursday�s fateha, I remember standing at our shop door chanting � Wa toto fateha� and hearing the response � Kina nani� from afar. I replied �Kina Ali Khaku�. You must have been in the group of children returning from Forodhani and knew what to expect. Besides the Wednesday Majlis at my house, one evening every year Vaddi Bhajar would be closed to the traffic for celebration of Hazrat Abbas� birthday. It was like �Khushiali Ya Bankro� at Junni Masjid. On one occasion Laila (your sister Zainab�s sister-in-law) and I, together with some other children from the street, took part in reciting Kasida. I was reminded of this occasion when I was talking to Laila recently. Issa remembers attending a function once and being given a �ladu�. These ladus were made by Laila�s aunt, Mami Tahakro, who lived in the vicinity. The barazas in Zanzibar served multiple purposes. The elderly on their long walks used to sit on them for resting and the hawkers like Ali Bajia (another name-tag) put their wares on the barazas to serve their customers. As children we used barazas to play a game called � crocodile chase�. The street was the ocean and the barazas were the shores where we would be safe from the crocodile�s jaws. Also, to avoid being run down by fast-moving hamali carts delivering goods from the wharf to the shops, we jumped onto the baraza when we saw one coming. The street separating the rows of houses on either side were so narrow that we could hear and see what went on inside the households around us. Neighbours standing at their windows gossiped across the street space. We threw packets of eatables to our friends through their windows. We also sat at the windows to listen to new songs from the Indian films being played in the neighbourhood, to memorise the lyrics. Growing up as children in Vaddi Bhajar, life was never dull. During Ramadhan, as the dusk approached, someone from my household and someone from your grandparent�s house would stand at the windows. Laila would be at her window from which she could see the minaret at Nai Masjid. When she saw the Muazzin reaching the top, Laila would come over to the window overlooking our house and cry, �Haya�, at which we rushed to the dinner table. We had good connection with Parsees. We were friendly with quite a few Parsee families because we attended the same school as their children, Saint Joseph�s Convent School. Dara Mistry�s family lived in the neighbourhood and as children we spent a good deal of time with them. According to Issa, I speak Gudjerati as Parsees did, which was somewhat peculiar. In your memoirs you describe Washiri coffee sellers. Their style of pouring coffee in tiny cups and stopping in time to avoid overfilling the cup was a skillful performance. So was the juggling of cups to announce their arrival. A coffee seller had certain streets for his territory by common consent with others to avoid competition. On his rounds, he would stop at the shops and pour coffee for the shopkeeper and whoever else was present in the shop. A shop was a venue for trading gossip and rumours.The coffee seller was also a purveyor of news, rumours and gossip which he picked up on his rounds. To this day, Issa brews coffee which he calls Kahawa ya Unguja every morning and drinks it from one of the tiny cups brought from Zanaibar. I even have a doll replica of the coffee seller in his traditional costume carrying his dele.Occassionally I make Haloowa Ya Manga which I learnt to make from Ukera Kassamali Peera on one of my visits to California. Dinesh Pandya's letter took me back to my student days in Arya Samaj.as well as my teaching days at Bait ul Raas. I remember his father panpati shop under Arya Samaj. Harish Pandya was my student at the Teachers' College Zanzibar. I have written a couple of articles on Zanzibar too. One article was prompted by an article I had read in the local paper which opened with the words \"The light died, the fan stopped, I fell for Zanzibar.\" Wednesday 09/05/2001 4:26:16am Dear Abdulrazak, I visited your personal website and found it to be very fascinating. Also I was thrilled to read the fascinating accounts about your life and times in Zanzibar and beyond. I was also reminded of my own experiences. I was born in 1936 in Germany. I lived through World War ii. I saw its violence, death and destruction. I saw the fires and flames of fury that laid waste whole cities. I had seen the bloodshed, the turmoil and the confusion. I remember the fear and the anxiety when we were forced to sit all night huddled together in cellars and bomb shelters. I remember the attacks of dive bombers. I remember the tears that were shed. I climbed over the mountains of rubble or ruined, bombed and burned out houses. As a child of barely 9, I also had to beg for food in order to help my family survive the hunger and trauma of those days. These experiences have left a permanent imprint and scar on my memory. The one and only time that I was able to visit the very intriguing island of Zanzibar was in 1976. I had been a graduate student at Western Michigan University (Kalamazoo, MI, USA) in international and area studies, with Africa having been my area of particular interest at that time for my MA degree. I had returned to East Africa for a third time. My previous visits had been in 1965 and in 1972. In 1976 I chose to do some travels independent of my study and travelling companions. After a visit to the Ngorongoro Crater National Park in Tanzania, I decided to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro. I joined an international expedition made up of climbers from Japan, Sweden, the UK, and yours truly from Germany & USA. After this fabulous and successful experience, I treated myself to a bus tour to the Indian Ocean, in order to allow the healing qualities of salt water to comfort my blistered feet and, of course, to visit Dar-es-Salaam. There I stayed at the Hotel Kilimanjaro, enjoying luxury not found in the various shelters on slopes of its name sake mountain. While at the hotel, a few travelers, one originally from the USSR and two from the USA, and I decided during an evening meal which we enjoyed at the roof top restaurant of the hotel overlooking the harbor, to make a visit to Zanzibar, about which I had read just prior to my latest sojourn to East Africa. In Zanzibar, I chose to stay at a modest bed and breakfast facility located right at the coast facing the continent, where during high tide you could observe dolphins and sea turtles Unfortunately I do not recall the name of this particular B&B at the moment, in order to be able to praise its hospitality and good food. All of us had traveled independently, and we were to meet up again on the island. It was pure chance that the fellow from Russia also was looking for affordable accomodations and coincidentally chose this same place that a taxi driver recommended to me. At least I had someone to talk to and to make visits to the various local historical sites. On one of our many walks, we encountered the ambassador of the People's Republic of China walking along the beach looking for various colorful sea shells as we did also. We greeted each other, and we found him to be very interested in starting a conversation. So, here we were, a former Soviet citizen, now living and working in Finland, and for the moment on vacation in East Africa, and I, a West-German immigrant to the USA on a study/vacation tour of East Africa, had a \"high-level\" meeting with a Chinese diplomat, comparing notes about aquatic life and marine biology. We were all on an East-meets-West equal footing, so to speak, because all three of us were barefoot, walking through the coastal muck at low tide. It was a most fascinating and gratifying experience, because we parted with friendly handshakes and mutual good wishes. The Chinese Embasy was virtually next door to the B&B were we stayed. After several days in the tropical setting of mutli-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-religious Zanzibar, with its gregarious peope and friendly atmosphere, I flew back to Nairobi by way of Pemba, and after a very generous areal sweep by the East African Airways pilot over Mt. Kilimanjaro made for my benefit, allowing me to see from the air where I had been only a few days earlier, on a four day treck, hiking, climbing up to Kibo Point, just below the actual snow-covered peak, from where it had taken us us three days to get back to the starting point. Overall, a superb experience, and the highest physical elevation anywhere that I have reached in my life to date. Best regards to your family, Abdulrazak. Gerhard A. Fuerst Thursday 09/06/2001 4:45:55am Hello Abdulrazak, I appreciated hearing back from you, and I am happy to know that you enjoyed my ever so humble contribution to your collection of guestbook entries. Although it has been a hot,long, hard, and exhausting day, let me add a few additional remarks. It was interesting for me to read that you are such a polished and published cricket afficionado. By coincidence, yesterday's entry in my history calendar was about cricket. Here is what it said : \"Cricket was the game to play in the late 1700's. However, it wasn't until 1888 that the Marylebone Cricket Club in London wrote the official rules for the ancient game, which had gained prominence with aristocracies, as well as the common folk.\" (Source: \"LIFE, Through the Second Millenium,\" Dateline: September 4, 2001, from LIFE & TIME, A 2001 Year-In-A-Box Calendar, which features something interesting, and historically significant for each day of the year). Would you believe it, I was a member of an international cricket team at one point in my life. It was none other than the frequent contributor and illustrious Namaskar-Afrikana member Dr. Visho Sharma, who introduced me to this game. He was my boss at Western Michigan University in a general studies course about the Nonwestern World, which I taught for 17 years as a part-time instructor. He still is the director of this course at WMU. In any case, Visho enticed me to take up the sport of cricket...a wicked game! :-)Here I was the only German in an assortment of Brits, Scotts, Aussies,Kenyans, Tanzanians, South Africans, Indians and Pakistanis. It was, therefore, also an eclectic mixture of religions: Hindus, Muslims, and Christians. It was the sport that got us together, however, and to practice and play regularly every Sunday during the summer months at a local city park. Recently there was even a suggestion that the recreation department of the city of Kalamazoo should build a permanent facility for the cricket players. I have to tell you right away that I never developed into becoming a prime player. In fact, whenever we played another team who happended to be short-handed, I was \"loaned\" to them, because it was generally figured that I would contribute little or nothing to any potential win of the out-of-town opponents. I did hit a few lucky 6 pointers in my short-lived cricket career, and I also eventually got the hang of bowling. It was fun while it lasted, although everyone knows that it is not really a German sport in any recognizeable fashion. I did practice other sports in my youth and as an adult, with a great degree of proficiency,however: track and field, gymnastics, soccer, skiing, and especially figure skating(both recreational and competitive: solo, pairs, and ice dancing, and also show skating). The latter sport I even taught for a period of time. I was the first professional figure skating instructor hired by the city of Kalamazoo at its first outdoor skating rink more than 40 years ago. Furthermore, I significantly contributed to starting and developing the youth division of the local figure skating club. I also coached an AYSO youth soccer team for seven years, taking them to the division championship 5 times, winning three plus a regional championship (AYSO = the American Youth Soccer Organisation). My son was an excellent member of that team. At my high school, I also sponsored and coached a fencing club. I had an assitant coach from Kuwait. He had been an international competitor, and he also represented Kuwait twice at the Olympics. He also was considerably better than I ever could hope to be. Another sport that I practice with some real devotion and passion over many decades an on three continents was mountain climbing, whereby Mt. Kilimanjaro was my greates endurance and elevation achievement to date, as I already mentioned yesterday. I still hope to be able to see Mt. Everest up close and personal some day! :-) By the way, some very serious sports injuries over the years kept me from climbing the ranks in competitive figure skating, but I also enjoyed that while it lasted! :-) All this was in my past. I now enjoy riding my bicycle together with my wife, and taking walks along the beaches of Lake Michigan, collecting rocks and fossils. All our children love the outdoors. We also like to go hiking and camping. The latter will have to wait until next summer, because now teaching school is the professional priority. Well, let this be my thoughts for the day. I hope you will enjoy reading about my many diverse sportive exploits. Best regards to you and your family. Gerhard A. Fuerst Although we have `known` each other, in cyberspace, for the last 4 or 5 years, I never knew about your website until a few days ago. Be that as it may, having now visited the site, all I can say is that it brings out the flavour of Zanzibar, in all its senses. I have never been there, but as someone who was born and brought up in Mombasa, one always had a vicarious connection with the place we knew as a spice island, not least because we were taught from an early age that the coastal strip of Kenya was a British protectorate of Zanzibari territory. But apart from that, as a Mombasa person, it was not difficult to imagine what life was like in Zz and your website merely confirms that. In the course of my later life, I came to know quite a few Zanzibaris of course (among them I would mention one of the Lakha brothers and Ranjit Ramaiya who were contemporaries of mine as law students in London in the early 1960s) and so as East African Asians we have always considered Zanzibar to be part of our background. Life in Mombasa of my schooldays, in the 1940s and `50s, was simply idyllic. One could go anywhere and as a teenager I and my friends cycled into virtually every part of our island (because Mombasa too of course is or was an island). Its smells, sounds and sights, its architecture and street scenery, its general appearance - but above all the mix of the population in terms of colour, costume, religion, ethnicity, language and temperament - cannot have been much different from that of Zz. There is thus a close affinity between Mombasawallahs and Zanzibaris and I can easily relate to your `Recollections`! But it is your writings about the India and the sub-continent generally, but in particular Mumbai and Gujarat (Jamnagar, Bhuj etc), that resonate with me most. You actually lived a few years there, albeit as a student. I have only visited the country a few times, but of course it is in our DNA, so to speak, and one had sort of `known` it second-hand from early childhood. But I fell in love with parts of Mumbai when we, my wife and I, first went there in the winter of 1968/69. You may recall that we had some interesting exchanges on our collective and fond memories of Mumbai on the Namaskar forum in 2004. Let me therefore quote a few selected passages from what I had written then (and please excuse the extended length of this piece because of that, but I think you will find that we have a lot in common). So I will end this contribution with these extracts, and thank you for creating this space and for allowing us to view and participate in it - indeed, I see that from the number 51462 of visitors to the site when I first came across it only about a month ago, it has now shot up to 51731 - bravo!: \"Abdulrazak`s exchanges with Dhiren, Bhadra et all about Churchgate and its various mouthwatering eating establishments have evoked memories of my own which I think are worth sharing The evenings were exactly as described by Abdulrazak - one could up and down the Marine Drive - all the way up to Chowpatty Beach even - there would be families and respectable folk taking their `constitutionals` or just milling around. We did a lot of exploring of the surrounding areas on foot (being younger and fitter then), as well as of course hailing those ubiquitous yellow topped taxis for longer journeys, for shopping etc. There was simply no sense of danger or discomfort. I remember once we had gone to see a play at some theatre in the evening, and when we came out - this must have been around 10 pm- found ourselves stranded - all the taxis were hastily being taken up, and we were left without any transport. So we just walked back to the hotel -along the suburban railway line, in the dark, a distance of probably some 2 miles or so. I don`t remember being frightened. There was nobody around to hassle us then. The various places that Abdulrazak mentions - we did go there - the Gaylords Restaurant, the Top of the Town (which was on a corner, I think at or beside the Ambassador Hotel), the Purohit (for our `Gujarati thali` lunch or dinner). Why did we fall for Bombay, and the Churchgate area in particular? I think partly because it reminded us of London and England - the architecture, the hustle and bustle and the freedom and anonymity afforded by the crowds. soak up the atmosphere and dynamism of Mumbai. We used to go to the Jehangir Art Gallery almost every day for coffee and there would talk to some of the elitist young things who used to gather there. We even tried bus travel (BEST, I think was what the Bombay bus system was called) by the London type red double-deckers (another point of favour for something that was familiar). There was a cinema more or less opposite Churchgate Station, On the other side was the cricket stadium. And oh, there was a restaurant that has not been mentioned by either Abdulrazak or anyone else, that also we used to go to: it was called `the Volga`, near the Flora Fountain, I seem to remember. It was the exotic name that had attracted me; the food was ok too. So whenever I think of Mumbai, it is by reference to the Churchgate, Gate of India, Colaba, the Maidan and the Marine Drive etc. I was also reminded of the beauty of the city earlier this year when I attended the SOAS appearance of Vikram Chandra, whose `Love and Longing in Bombay` I had read a few years ago and who read from his new unpublished novel, also set in Mumbai\". Wednesday, 15th August, 2007 Name: Anne Chappel Homepage: E-Mail: Chappels@bigpond.net.au Referred By: Search Engine City/Country: Adelaide, Australia Comments: Dear Abdulrazak, Today I came across your site and was very excited to read about your childhood in Zanzibar. I am a white woman, born in Tanganyika in 1947. I spent many happy childhood years in Zanzibar from 1956 till the 1964 revolution. We �escaped� from our house on the waterfront during the first day � using our yacht. I remain very connected to Zanzibar, it is in some way my homeland and its memories will never leave me. I have been back twice in 1995 and 2000. I know Kiponda Street, I stayed in a small hotel there. I would like to share some of those memories and stories with you. My father is Mervyn Smithyman and he was the Permanent Secretary to the Prime Minister after Independence in 1963. My father is now 96. I see that you are interested in cricket. My brother, Michael, was a good cricketer in Zanzibar (although only 16-18) and played many times for various teams there. I was fascinated to look at your photographs. The first one: The VIPs at a public function during the colonial days. Shows my late mother and father in the centre! How well I remember the Sultans red car. I used to bicycle around Zanzibar town for hours. Loved going to films at the Majestic and eating peanuts bought outside. Our first house was on the field at Mnazi Moja. My mother, Audrey Smithyman, taught Geography at the Indian girls� secondary school for a time. I have many pictures and slides of Zanzibar. I find it very sad that there is so little recognition of what happened at the Revolution. So much was destroyed, so many lives lost. I have a considerable library about Zanzibar and the history of the coast. So I would be happy to share some memories with you! (and comment on an error in your story about the revolution) I now live in Adelaide, Australia. Regards Anne Chappel Nee Smithyman Anne & Mervyn Chappel PO Box 2339 Kent Town SA 5071 \"I have visited your wonderful website on many occasions over the past 5 years.\n\nMy husband Hussein Gulamali Abdulrasul Peera (\"\"Shenny\"\") Dewjee was born in Zanzibar in 1936. Perhaps you know of the family? Peera Dewjee was an Ismaili, Abdulrasul was Ithnasheri, as was Gulamali when he was young. However, Gulamali was converted back to Ismaili by his wife's family.\n\nHussein left Zanzibar about 1951 after the death of his mother and went to live with an aunt in Dar es Salaam, migrating to England in 1961 after the death of his father. He finally managed to go back for a visit to Zanzibar in 2004, taking his family (myself and our son, then aged 16) to see where he was born and search for his \"\"roots\"\". (We went again in 2006.) We managed to find his father's house/shop in Hurumzi Street (now 233 Changa Bazaar) and some information about Peera Dewjee who had been the Sultan's right-hand-man in the 1880s, but we couldn't find much about the years in between. Gulamali (who was known as (Gulamali Dhabo\"\") had a famous perfumery (attar) shop visited by locals of all communities, as well as tourists who came on cruise liners. Abdulrasul, listed as \"\"Treasury Superintendent\"\", was awarded the 4th class Brilliant Star of Zanzibar on 23 October 1941. Abdulrasul was one of five sons of Peera Dewjee (two others were Abdoolali and Abdoolhoosein) and he was married twice.\n\nCan you tell us any more about our family? I think you would be too young to remember Gulamali's shop, but perhaps you know someone who does. Any information would be much appreciated.\n\nThere is a picture on your website captioned: \"\"The progeny of Nai Misid pioneers pictured around 1925 at 'Saun Baag.' \"\" Included in the front row, either side of Mohamedali Fazal Sheriff, are Gulamali Dewji and Abdulrasul Dewji. Could these be my husband's father and grandfather??\n\nI have printed off quite a few articles from your website for my husband to read and they have brought back many nostalgic memories for him. Many, many thanks for this.\n\nWishing you the best of health and happiness in 2008,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAudrey Dewjee.\n\n\"\"Dear Mr. Abdulrazak,\n\nIts really nice to know someone from Zanzibar.\n\nBabu was with us in the ESM and maybe in KGVI school.

Lets pray to almighty that all these disharmony ends and Peace prevail.\n\nThanks a lot, dear friend.\"Dear Abdulrazak,\n\nI went through your 'Recollections' and found it superb. Let me introduce myself. The picture you saw at the Jamnagar Boarding House of Mr. Jetha Gokal is that of my great great grandfather, I'm his grand grand son.\n\nJetha Gokal>Jeraj Jetha>Yousuf Ali Jeraj>M.Younus>Zain Abbas\n\nOur family is also termed as HEMANI because our forefathers were in hem business, that is 'goldsmith'. We are also called GOKAL because Jetha's father was Gokal Khimji who was Agha Khani. Another important thing is that Gokal Khimji's brother Lira Khimji had a daughter named Mithi Bai who was the first wife of Mohamed Ali Jinnah(Quaide-e-Azam).\n\nJetha Gokal's grave is in Karachi. His date of death is 25th Muharram, 1918. In early twentieth century, around 1905/1910, Jetha Gokal called a great 'Mela' in Jamnagar and invited all Shia Ishanasheri people because they had just changed their religion from Agakhani due to their studies and the efforts of Haji Ghulamali/Haji Naji(a prolific Shia writer and founder of Rahe Najat). In that 'Mela' Haji Naji was also invited. At that time, Jetha Gokal paid Rs. 10,000 for the welfare of Shia Community(a hell big amount at that time). After the death of Jetha, his son Jeraj also called a 'Mella' in 1920 or 1925, invited the same guests and donated Rs. 20,000 to 'Welfare' as our shipping business was booming, from Karachi to Jodia, Basra to Africa(this information can be obtained from the old editions of Rahe Najat). I at times would desperately like to go to Jamnagar to see our old houses overthere, Jodia Bandar, old people who know about the Jetha Gokal/Jeraj Gokal history, and moreover salutation at Jeraj's grave. Jetha Gokal's wife's name was Mongi Bai who also became Shia Ishanasheri but her parental family remained Agakhani.\n\nThere is my relative in Congo named Raza Hemani and in Kinshasa Mohsin Hemani who are also the grand grand sons of Jetha Gokal and hail from Jodia, Jamnagar. Our shipping business was first started by Jetha and later expanded by my forefather Jeraj Jetha. I've also pictures of our ship, so called 'waan' in Gujarati. However, after Jeraj my grandfather and his brothers clashed and we lost this business. On the contrary the grandsons of Noormohamed Jetha Gokal ie Mustafa, Murtaza and Abbas Gokal(sons of Kassamali Jetha Gokal) started this shipping business and went skylimit but experienced slide after the downfall of BCCI.\n\nWell, I like to keep in touch with all those who are interested in Khoja history. Iltimase dua, may God bless you for the sake of Panjatane Pak.\n\nI am back in Mombasa for my summer holidays, and continue to pursue my researches into our colourful Khoja history. Some time ago I decided to write a small family history. I wonder if you might be able to recall anything from your days in zanzibar? My ancestor Bhaloo Walji came from Jamkhambalia outside Jamnagar and he married Nurbai Sheriff Dewani (sister to Mohammed Sheriff Dewani). He had four sons Rashid, Jessa, Kassam and Kermali. Rashid and Kassam converted to Ithnasherism. While Jessa and Kermali remained Ismaili. Kermali Bhaloo's descendants through his son Mohammed who converted to Ithnasherism are known by nick name 'KABANA'. I know that Jessa Bhaloo was an extremely prominent Ismaili in Zanzibar with the rank of Alijah. He opened a maternity home in the 1920's at Mkunazini opposite the cathedral church. Somebody even told me that the lane where the maternity home and jessa bhaloo's residence were located was called 'bhaloo street'? I have no idea if this is true, probably not.\n\nI know for a fact that in 1874 and earlier perhaps Bhaloo Walji had two shops in Stone town (there is an 1894 court case where the evidnence of possession of the two shops for 'twenty years and more' is presented by the sons) Bhaloo walji began by selling coconuts and copra then went into Ivory trade. His sons Jessa and Kassam were piece cloth merchants. My ancestor Kassam died at a very young age around 1903 in Najaf and is buried there.\n\nI am having alot of problems because of one key issue. Were the 4 brothers born in Zanzibar or in India? If they were born in India which I believe most reasonable then they must have came either with their father Bhaloo Walji or individually to Zanzibar. In 1880 Kermali Bhaloo had a divorce with his wife Rambai, again in a court case. This 1880 date makes it impossible for the brothers to have been born in Zanzibar. Since it would mean keramli bhaloo would have been only 10 years old or younger (assuming Bhaloo walji came in 1870 and had his sons in zanzibar)\n\nIf you can shed any light, or know of someone I might contact please let me know. \"My name is Jenny. I am engaged to Shiraz Sumar's son, Jaheel Sumar. I live one floor under the Sumars in our building here in Elmhurst, New York. I've been researching Shiraz Sumar's career online in pursuant to a Father's Day project I'm currently working on for him.\n\nI stumbled upon your writings of Shiraz Sumar. I must say, of all of the stories I've heard describing Dad's Cricketing career in East Africa, the article you wrote in 1984, entitled \"\"Good-bye Sumar,\"\" touched my heart the most. I've always been proud of Dad's accomplishments and have been quick to brag to my friends and family of his career. When I read your article, I felt like I was in Tanzania in 1984, feeling the pain of Dad's departure from cricket. That's how much your article moved me. Your article has helped me understand and appreciate Dad's accomplishments on a much higher level. For that, I thank you.\n\nYou'll be most happy to know that Shiraz Sumar and his \"\"charming and inspirational wife Yasmin,\"\" (if I may quote you) are doing very well here in the States. They have a son, as you know, Jaheel Sumar. Jaheel is a highly intelligent young man with a heart of gold. He is very devoted to his family. He's also inherited his dad's athletic skills. He's an excellent Basketball player, although he plays rather casually. I am proud and honored, and consider myself very lucky, to have fallen in love with Jaheel. Shiraz and Yasmin have been more than wonderful to me. I could not have dreamed of having better parents-in-laws.\n\nMr. Fazal, I was hoping you could help me with this project that I am putting together for Shiraz for Father's day. I am trying to gather as much information, pictures, articles, and comments having to do with Shiraz Sumar's career in East Africa. I was wondering if you would be able to direct me to any websites or newspaper articles that would contain highlights of his career. Do you perhaps have any pictures that you can e-mail to me? Anything that you could offer would be most appreciated.\n\nI would like to thank you, again, for your moving article on my father-in-law. \"Abdulrazak, another anecdotal narrative:-\n\nI was with my cousin Arvind Vallabhdas Mulji yesterday and we were talking about how well we were taught English, especially the grammar in schools in Zanzibar. In his case, he said, it wasn't always the white English teachers who taught him English grammar but the Indian and African and Arab teachers.\n\nGiving an example of how particular teachers were about their written English, he talked about Abud Jumbe. Once Mr Jumbe had written notes on a blackboard in a biology lesson for the boys to copy. While the boys were doing their work, Mr Jumbe was reading his own notes and suddenly called out, 'Stop! Tear that page out of your exercise book.' When asked why, he said he had used the same word twice in one sentence and although the boys suggested cancelling that word and replacing it with another, his reply was, 'I will never have anybody see that I had made such an error in my work.'\n\nThat was the kind of commitment OUR own teachers had.\n\nAnother thing Arvind explained was the subtle difference between Zanzibar and the mainland Tanzania : 'When someone visits an office in Dar, the person would be straight away bombarded with the question, 'Weve unataka nini?', whereas in Zanzibar he would be greeted by 'Karibu' first and then asked the question.'\n\nMy first encounter with racism and awareness of my citizenship.\n\nAs I had said to you earlier, I had attended the World Centenary Girl Guides Camp held in Windsor Park in England 1957. Initially, I was chosen to be presented to the Queen. I was even taken for the rehearsal and taught how to curtesy and so on. However, later in the day a very worried looking Guider came to me and said, 'I am extremely sorry, but we have just received a telegram from Zanzibar and they have asked us to replace you by Saada Khamis [an Arab Guide who was the other Guide from Z'bar] to be presented to the Queen.' The Guider thought I would burst into tears, but I was not much upset by missing the opportunity. I suppose I was too young to realise the implication.\n\nAlso, perhaps I wasn't bothered, as in Zanzibar I had the opportunity of seeing at close range many celebrities like, Rita Hayworth & Prince Alikhan, Dr S. Radhakrishnan, Princess Margaret, etc. at Garden Parties held in the British Residency grounds where we served food to the guests in our Girl Guide uniform.\n\nAlso I became aware for the first time, that although I had gone to the camp as a Zanzibari, ,I had chosen to wear chania-choli & odhani as my national dress. I taught other Guides a song in Gujarati & not in Swahili. I was a Zanzibari BUT culturally an Indian. At the Camp, nobody wanted to know me as an Indian, as there were about 30 Girl Guides from India [and I didn't belong to them] who performed Indian dances in the evening as part of our entertainment. Saada and I, as Zanzibaris, had not prepared anyhing in particular to represent our island's identity. So here I was a young 16 year old with no awareness of the implications of my citizenship or identity. I realised all this much later in my life.\n\nOn arrival back to Zanzibar, a reporter had asked me if I had seen the Queen, and my reply was, 'Yes, I saw her clearly as being short, I was in the front row.' I didn't even think of telling him about the last minute swap.\n\nFurther to my earlier posting i'm presenting a couple of anecdotes:-\n\nIn 1999 August, my sister Kanak from Mumbai, my younger daughter Jaanki & I went to Zanzibar. We went to visit the Palace Museum. I had never been inside the palace before, so for me it was quite an experience. I was delighted to see royal portraits painted by our art teacher Maalim Farhan.\n\nWe had a teenage boy as our guide and some Australian tourists in the group. The poor lad had probably learnt by heart what he was supposed to tell us. He found himself taken over by Kanak, who talked about the first ever lift in Beit-el-Ajayab and how as young children we used to go up and down in it just for fun., and what the word meant and that it was a palace before etc. etc. She described what it was like when Seyyid Khalifa had died and how she had come to pay her respect to the dead Sultan and express her condolences to Bibi Nunu.\n\nWe saw the special room of the Princess [Seyyid Barghash's sister] who had eloped with a German officer. I came to know about her when I had visited the museum in Muscat. Had not known anything about her in Zanzibar.\n\nAt one point the poor Guide, frustrated by our interruption, stopped us and said, 'Please let me talk about it.'\n\nThe Australians were of course delighted to hear all our anectodes. They told us we had made history alive for them.\n\nTalking about Bibi Nunu, I remember when I was 8 or so(1948) I had been chosen to present a bouquet to Bibi Nunu for an occsion(I can't remember what it was)that was held in the assembly hall of Government Boys Secondary School. I can't remember if I was chosen because I was clever in studies or because my dad was the Chairman of the Board of Governors of Shree Hindu Girls' School. I had a pretty dress on and had tied a mala of Jasmine flowers as a hairband. I wonder if there will be a photo somewhere in the archives of Zanzibar library!\n\nThis one is interesting as well. I was chosen as the best girl guide from 7th Zanzibar Company. We were from the Hindu Girls School. So suddenly I was prepared to take all sorts of tests so I could have lot more badges on my sleeve. To be chosen I had to compete with the Guides from other Zanzibar Comapnies and attend a camp with Guides and Guiders from Dar.\n\nI went for home maker's badge: the examiner was Arnvaz Bahen, wife of the HM of ESM. She asked me how I would dry a sweater. I thought, 'Why was she asking me such a stupid question?' I replied, 'On a clothes line.' She put me right by saying, 'Woollen garments are always dried flat on a towel and you have to pull the garment to shape first.' How was I to know? I never possessed a sweater. Needless to say she passed me. Fantastic collection both your articles and the added info from the guests signing in. I would love to add my little snipet and our family's part in the history of Jungbar.\n\nI was born 1954 and went St Joseph convent school. My grand father Abdulla Thaver introduced the first cinemas in Zanzibar. He was better known by his nickname Masi. He built Empire and Sultana Cinemas and perhaps even Majestic which after a fire he sold to Badru Gozi who rebuilt it. Masi was an amazing man. He had the rare quality of a very good businessman with a big, big heart....and we only found that out at his funeral in 1966. I was 12 and remember it vividly when countless people came to us with stories of how he helped them.\n\nHe gave up his job as an accountant started with a 100 Shilling projector, a bedsheet for a screen and an open rooftop where he charged one shilling all round for the movies.....the rest is history, unfortunately not documented systematically. I am truly glad that you have made such an excellent effort in documenting what you know. More importantly I commend you for allowing open input from others to add to it...thank you so much.\n\nMy Dad Moh'd Masi who is retired in London will be thrilled to go through and recognise all the people there. Although I was 13 when I left I remember the kahawa, abedi's bajia and samosas (my favourite) and especial the crocodile game across two barazas.\n\nIts amazing how diverse a population thrived under such small proximity and how individuality was enhanced by the blending. Only in Zanzibar could such rich contrasts live in colourful harmony.\n\nIf I recall, people were also named by an abreviation of their full names if not by their professions. So we had names like gujadha (gulzar jaffer dhalla) and Shiabha (Shirin Abdulla Bhanji...my late mum who passed away 3 months back) who after marriage became Shimatha. As kids it was so funny to us at the time. It seemed to be the norm to tease and make fun of everybody else including yourself. Fun and laughter is how I remember Zanzibar.\n\nI wish I could trace a good friend of mine from Tumekuja school...her name Marina Vase (a goan), she left school in standard 6 or 7 to go study in India. When people made fun of me and my big nose she was always there to defend. Her sister was a teacher there Sabrina Vase.\n\nMy best memories were of forodhani during ramadhan...the evening fashion parades and the card games on the grass! I was only a child but the sweet memories remain....esp of the mishaki, chana bateta (uniquely made in coconut with keri) and the sugarcane juice with lime and ginger.\n\nThe sights, sounds, smells and tastes of Zanzibar I will take to my grave. Thank you for creating a virtual home for Jungbaris to refresh our memories.\n\nI do have one request....how about getting your guests to include 2 pics of themselves on this website, one today and one when they lived in Zanzibar (could be a family photo too)?\n\nbest regards to you.\n\nRoxy\"Mr. Sherrif,\n\nI just wanted to point out to you that under your chapter one - section on Zanzibar - your last paragraph where it reads: \"\"In a helpless state I bed farewell to my house...\"\" has one spelling error in it -I think this was most probably a typo error than anything else, something that you most probably overlooked when typing - in \"\"bed\"\" that should have correctly have read as: \"\"In a helpless state, I BADE farewell to my house...\"\".\n\nBut other than this, I must say, Mr. Sherrif, I thoroughly enjoyed surfing through your web portal on \"\"Jangbar\"\" or (Zanzibar).\n\nI must say that I whole heartedly concur with you, as well as with all your other guest who signed in your GuestBook, with their most thought- provoking commentries on their past memories and experiences in Zanzibar, that this place was, and is truly still, one of the most beautiful places on Earth. It's also most probably a reflection of \"\"Jannat\"\" (Paradise) on Earth. If you must know, then there is a mythical saying here in California that goes something like this that: When God first uttered the word: \"\"BE\"\", the first place that came into \"\"BEING\"\" on Earth was \"\"Los Angeles,\"\" but now I have second thoughts about this statement: as I now believe that the \"\"FIRST EVER\"\" place that came into \"\"BEING\"\" on Earth was: \"\"Zanzibar!\"\".\n\nA little about myself: I was born (so were both my parents) and raised in Morogoro - in a very serene, small, beautiful town overlooking The Uluguru Mountain - but, after the political upheaval and turmoil that followed the unstability in Tanzania, way back in the late 1960s, we were forced to migrate to London, England, which is where we decided to settle for about a decade. It was here in London where I acquired all my basic education from: 'O' Levels (Form IV), to 'A' Levels (Form V), and then onwards to University, where I graduated with Honours Bachelors degree in Computing Science major. After graduation, I landed my first job as a Associate Programmer Analyst in California, which is where I next moved to and have been ever since time immemorial!\n\nI lost touch with both Tanzania as well as England after I moved to California. Being an avid Cricket fan and enthusiast, just like yourself and others who enjoyed playing as well watching it, I must also say that I thoroughly enjoyed reading your section on Cricket too). This brought back tons of vivid memories of Cricket in Morogoro, as with all the rivalries between the various Clubs et. al.\n\nBy the way, I found your web portal from The YAHOO search Engine after I'd entered the word: \"\"MATUFA\"\" - you know: those tasty, sweet with nectarine, tropical fruits you have mentioned in your section under Zanzibar. Boy, do I miss those fruits from Tanzania, but fate has it otherwise.\n\nOh, I must now pen off, because I've a tendency to get carried away when I start writing on subjects that I have vivid memories off!\n\nThank you so much for evoking those latent thoughts!!\n\nSincerely\n\nAlnoor\n\nP.S.\n\nUnfortunately, I've NEVER got the opportunity of visiting Zanzibar, but the way you put it sounds so very enchanting and romantic - just like the tales from: \"\"ALF LAYLA AL LAYLA - Mythical stories from: \"\"One Thousand and One Arabian Nights stories!\"\"\"Hi there Abdurrazak,\n\nI coincidentally came across your reminiscences of Zanzibar as I was looking up the mail bag from Namaskar Africana. As you know it has participants from all over the world forming the East African Asian Diaspora. Let me tell you my dear Abdul, the article/biography found deep resonance with me from several aspects, but particularly in view of the fact that I was in Zanzibar at the age of 3-4yrs. in and around 1935/6. My recollections of the time are very strange and flocculant. Although I was but a child at the time I suppose that in itself is not an earth shattering happening except for the fact that I went through fairly traumatic experience in my life. My father Camer-ud-Deen who was an inspector in the Zanzibar police was assassinated by one of the sword carrying mangas or mshihiris you described in your discourse. This was during a riot against, presumably the govt who it appears much to their [mangas/mshihiris] angst had raised the tax on cloves. The story such as it is, goes that my father in the course of his duties went amongst them to quell the riot: being mistaken for an Englishman because of his pale complexion he was beheaded by a sword wielding manga/mshihiri. The reason for boring you with this bit of background information is to ask you a simple question which I suspect because of your intimate knowledge of the history of Zanzibar you may be able to answer. I would like to visit my fathers grave in order to pay my respects, but would very much appreciate knowing whether the cemetery used by the Sunni Muslims in 1935/6 is still in existence? I would be extremely grateful for the information or would appreciate to know who or what authority to enquire from, and would be prepared to reimburse any out of pocket expenses you may incur in the pursuit of the answer.\n\nmany regards\n\nMuneerExcellent. Thanks for the many great memories. As Parsees we burried our dead in Zbar unlike our tradition in India. Our fire temple was beyond Coopers, after the Bohra Gymkhana and Goan cemetry. Our burial ground was attached to it. I am a great admirer of your community. My brother Aspi and my sister Mahrookh and i all went to St. Joseph Convent school. I passed senior Cambridge in 1960, was admitted to King George and left in six months to the great annoyance of Mr. Davis to go to England to study medicine. I was lucky to get a scholarship from Yusufali Karimjee as he and his brother Tayabali were good friends of my father from their days in the Masonic Lodge. Jessa was in the lodge at the same time. I gratuated from Univ of Newcastle in 1968, and then went to Canada for two years and since then have been in Pittsburgh, USA. I now practise as a neuroradiologist at one of the teaching hospitals. My wife is from Bombay and i have two boys. My father Jehangir used to work for Cable and Wireless, and i am so grateful to you for that picture in Shangani as it also shows my house opposite C&W.\n\nOur Parsee teachers masters Arjani, Kanga and B.D.Mehta have passed away. Master Rana is still alive in Bombay. Mrs. Arjani has also passed away.\n\nI played cricket for the Parsees. I used to attend practices during the week with your Ithnashri team and also the Arab team. I once played in the Ismaili team. Soli Darukhanawala used to come and practise with various teams and he picked me up for the parsee team where i played as the youngest man before leaving for England. The comradry between the various communities we had should be a lesson to our people in India and Pakistan. I never knew of any Hindu, Muslim, Arab or Parsee rivalries and i often talk of this with my Muslim colleague and frien Dr. Chaudry who hails from Kisumu. I remember Juma Aley, Tungule, Zavad because they would let me practise. I can not recall the names of of the two very fair Arab boys who played for the Arabs but studied at i believe the Technical school. With our concrete and tar pitch developed reflexes i went on to represent my college and subsequently the medical school in England without any difficulty. Regarding our Parsee cricketers Dara Daruwalla, Keki and Parvez Talati,Rusi Madon and Themton and his brother Russi Bhumgara and Rutti Bulsara have passed away unfortunately. Russi Feroz Madon, the Combine player and captain resides in Toronto. He will be delighted to see the picture of Cosmos team. He was the teacher at King George. Kersy Jassavala of Technical School, Beitalras, resides in Wimbledon, London. Master Desai passed away a couple of years ago in Houston. His son is a urology physician here in Pgh and will be delighted to visit your website. He is related to master Nayak who has also passed away i believe. I met his sons at Jeetu's daughters wedding here in Pgh.\n\nFor displaced people like us and especially for communities like our Parsee community which was never big but was totally wiped out in the turmoil of independence I salute you for reviving the memories. We produced some giants in the history of Zanzibar in Rustom Sidhwa and Rutti Bulsara as major figures in the two big parties before independence. Parvez Talati was mayor and Keki Madon was the Speaker of the Legislative Council before independence. Great achievement for a miniscule community while it lasted but alas it is all over. I am sure God has a special place for you and i thank u for reminding us of our fathers and forefathers and the part they played in the history of the place of our birth. I was very glad to visit your website on Zanzibar. I looked at all the pics and remember when Princess Margaret visited Zanzibar. My mother Maggie was presented to her on two occasions, once as Island Commissioner for the Girl Guides and then as President of the Zanzibar Womens' Voluntary society.\n\nI used to captain the girls hockey teams and the netball teams-the latter took place in the grounds of Old Fort. My mother was an avid cricket fan.\n\nI was blessed to have been born and brought up up in Zanzibar. I brag so much about Zanzibar and i can detect the envy in some of the folks that i relate my stories. I was a student of St. Joseph Convent and then worked as Woman Asst. Insp of Police in the Special Branch and there is where we used to get reports of imminent coups on a weekly basis. A lot of my personal friends were slain during the coup.\n\nI owned a bright red Vespa scooter, KMB, and we had to drape a green curtain to hide the colour. Our office overlooked the prison yard and it was depressing to see people we knew in the yard including one of my classmates who was a constable in the police.\n\nYou have done a wonderful job.\n\nI lived on suicide alley, Shangani next to tippu tip house and next door to the Shariff family which was huge.\n\nWould love to hear from any of them.\n\nMy attachment to Zanzibar is very strong and i have asked my family that when i pass away, i would like my ashes to be strewn in the waters in front of my house, which is near the former English Club.\n\nWe are now getting ready for Carnival and i have been helping make the costumes. I had the pleasure of meeting and chatting with Brian Lara who attended the launching of the costumes at a big party.\n\nI was 21 when i left Zanzibar in 1964. It is my intention to pay a visit and when i do it will be a pleasure to meet with you. I am sure we have mutual friends.\n\nMabel\n\nMabel"
