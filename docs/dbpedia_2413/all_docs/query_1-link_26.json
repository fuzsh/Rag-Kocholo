        "text": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s diplomatic mission in Saudi Arabia has decided to set up a co-working space for Pakistani startups interested in entering the kingdom’s lucrative market, according to its social media post on Monday.\n\nPakistani authorities have sought investment from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, aiming to benefit from the burgeoning markets in the region as these states diversify their economies.\n\nPakistani startups, operating in sectors like health care, finance, education and logistics, have seen a rise in activity, with many receiving substantial funding to develop products and expand into new markets.\n\nCo-working spaces, which provide shared office environments, can help Pakistani startups explore the Saudi market by reducing overhead costs and foster collaboration with local businesses.\n\n“[The Pakistan Embassy in Saudi Arabia] is happy to announce launch of Co-Working Space on Embassy premises in [the Saudi Diplomatic Quarter],” the embassy said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nIt added the space will be given to “Pakistani startups, entrepreneurs and tech companies looking to set up business in the Kingdom” while asking them to get in touch.\n\nA Pakistani startup, PostEx, launched financial and logistics services in Saudi Arabia this week after a successful pilot project in Dubai, where more than 3,500 stores registered with it earlier this year.\n\nPostEx raised $7.3 million in August to expand its footprint in the Middle Eastern market.\n\nHowever, other startups are still working to raise funds to unveil their products and services in overseas markets and could benefit from the embassy’s initiative in Saudi Arabia.\n\nISLAMABAD: Militants in Pakistan want to stop development projects that are part of the multi-billion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday, a day after over 50 people were killed in a series of coordinated attacks in the country’s restive southwestern province of Balochistan.\n\nBalochistan — a key region bordering Iran and Afghanistan and host to major China-led infrastructure projects such as a strategic port and a gold-copper mine — faces a decades-old separatist insurgency, with ethnic Baloch militants fighting for independence, alleging exploitation of the province’s mineral and gas resources by the central government. The Pakistani state denies this and says it is working for the uplift of the region through various development schemes.\n\nBeijing is investing over $65 billion in energy and infrastructure projects in Pakistan as part of CPEC, a major segment of China’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. The corridor will connect China to the Arabian Sea and help Pakistan expand and modernize its economy through a network of roads, railways, pipelines and ports built in the country with Chinese loans. A flagship of the Chinese corridor is a deep-sea port at Gwadar in Balochistan.\n\nSeparatist militants, who usually attack Pakistani security forces, have also targeted Chinese interests and citizens, accusing Beijing of helping Islamabad exploit the province. Major attacks include a suicide bombing in March in which five Chinese nationals working at a hydropower plant were killed, and assaults on Beijing’s consulate in Karachi and on the Gwadar port.\n\n“The sole objective of these impure objectives is to put an end to the journey of progress in Pakistan, to stop the projects that are part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan,” PM Sharif said in a televised address to members of his federal cabinet.\n\nIn Beijing, China condemned the attacks and vowed to keep up firm support for Pakistan in counter-terrorism efforts.\n\n“China is ready to further strengthen counter-terrorism security co-operation with the Pakistani side in order to jointly maintain regional peace and security,” Lin Jian, a foreign ministry spokesperson, told a regular news briefing.\n\nOn Monday, Pakistan’s Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had blamed a nexus of the Pakistani Taliban and separatist Baloch outfits for the latest attacks, saying they were getting help from Pakistan’s enemies, a veiled reference to neighbors India and Afghanistan.\n\n“I want to reiterate that terrorists have no place here and whatever happens, they will be completely eliminated from this country,” Sharif said. “And people who believe in dialogue and want to see Pakistan’s green flag fly high and have complete faith in its constitution, for them the option for talks is always open.”\n\nIn the violence that began on Sunday evening, 23 passengers were taken off their vehicles in Musa Khel, a district in Balochistan’s northeast, and shot dead. In another attack, the Pakistan Army said it had killed 21 militants during a clearance operation in which 14 soldiers and police also died.\n\nSeparately, 10 people, including five security forces personnel, were killed when militants stormed a paramilitary force station in Kalat, while militants also blew up a railway bridge in Bolan in Balochistan’s Kachhi district. Six as yet unidentified, bullet-riddled bodies were also found near the bridge, with the circumstances of the killings unclear.\n\nThe latest eruption of violence poses a major challenge for the weak coalition government led by PM Sharif, which is battling an economic crisis and political instability as well as a rise in militant violence by religiously motivated and separatist groups across the country.\n\nBalochistan is also currently in the grips of civil rights protests by young ethnic Baloch people, who are calling for an end to what they describe as a pattern of enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses by security forces, who deny the charge.\n\nISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday reiterated the federal government’s commitment to make Pakistan’s investment climate “favorable and conducive” for foreign investors as the South Asian country struggles to meet external financial needs to get approval for a $7 billion IMF bailout loan and fights a growing militancy problem.\n\nLast month, Aurangzeb said Pakistan will focus on meeting its external financing needs by speaking with foreign governments and lenders to draw foreign investment as well as seeking loan rollovers. The government is also seeking to focus on more sustainable forms of external financing such as direct investment and climate financing.\n\nPakistan and the IMF reached an agreement for the 37-month loan program last month. The IMF has said the program is subject to approval from its executive board and obtaining “timely confirmation of necessary financing assurances from Pakistan’s development and bilateral partners.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Aurangzeb met Antti Partanen, a representative from Finn Fund, a Finnish development financier, who called on the finance minister in Islamabad.\n\n“The meeting focused on exploring potential investment opportunities in Pakistan,” Radio Pakistan reported. “The Finance Minister highlighted the government’s focus on transforming Pakistan into an export-led economy and attracting Foreign Direct Investment to enhance the country’s export base.”\n\nRadio Pakistan said Partanen presented an overview of FinnFund’s profile and investment initiatives in Pakistan, emphasizing the firm’s interest in digital infrastructure, renewable energy, agriculture, and forestry.\n\n“He noted that Pakistan’s growing young population makes it an attractive destination for financing and expressed the Fund’s willingness to explore investments in various sectors of the country.”\n\nAurangzeb has held a flurry of meetings with heads of foreign banks and companies in recent weeks in a push to bring in more investment. Last week he held meetings with top officials of Dubai Islamic Bank and Mashreq Bank to “discuss the economic outlook and explore investment opportunities in Pakistan.”\n\nPakistan is in talks with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and China to meet gross financing needs under the IMF program, Aurangzeb said in July following a trip to China to seek energy sector debt reprofiling.\n\nRollovers or disbursements on loans from Pakistan’s long-time allies, in addition to financing from the IMF, have helped Pakistan meet its external financing needs in the past.\n\nTough conditionalities placed by the IMF, such as raising tax on agricultural incomes and lifting electricity prices, have prompted concerns about poor and middle class Pakistanis grappling with rising inflation and the prospect of higher taxes.\n\nBringing in foreign investors might also become harder as Pakistan’s security situation deteriorates. On Sunday, separatist militants launched several coordinated attacks in the southwestern province of Balochistan, killing over 53 people, including at least 19 soldiers and police. Attacks across the country by religiously motivated groups like the Pakistan Taliban have also been on the rise in recent months.\n\nKARACHI: Experts have decried a “major security failure” and warned of a threat to foreign investment in Pakistan after separatist militants launched several coordinated attacks in the southwestern province of Balochistan, killing over 53 people, including at least 19 soldiers and police.\n\nIn the most widespread assault by ethnic insurgents in years, militants launched attacks in several districts across Pakistan’s largest but most impoverished province. The attacks included pulling passengers off trucks and buses and killing at least 23, attempting to storm a military camp and a paramilitary Levies station, blowing up a bridge, and blocking roads as well as a major highway connecting Balochistan to other provinces.\n\nBalochistan — a key region bordering Iran and Afghanistan and host to major China-led infrastructure projects such as a strategic port and a gold-copper mine — faces a decades-old separatist insurgency, with ethnic Baloch militants fighting for independence, alleging exploitation of the province’s mineral and gas resources by the central government. The Pakistani state denies this and says it is working for the uplift of the region through various development schemes.\n\nSecurity experts say the fresh attacks highlighted enhanced strategic planning and tactical capabilities of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), the most prominent of the separatist groups, and other armed groups operating in the southwestern province. The BLA, they argue, is getting better at mobilizing fighters in different areas.\n\n“Attacks of this magnitude and nature constitute a major security failure,” Abdul Basit Khan at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore told Arab News, highlighting that militants “effectively choked” strategic entry points into Balochistan.\n\n“They were able to sustain their activities for at least an entire night.”\n\nThe effective blockade of key highways leading to the Sindh and Punjab provinces showed that separatist militants in Balochistan numbered around 4,000 now and their operational capabilities have increased “tremendously,” according to Khan.\n\nHe said the attacks would potentially undermine China’s confidence in the capability of Pakistan forces to protect its interests in Balochistan and negatively impact efforts to bring more international investment to Pakistan. The province is home to key mining projects, including Reko Diq, run by mining giant Barrick Gold, and believed to be one of the world’s largest gold and copper mines. China also operates a gold and copper mine in the province and is building a deep sea port at Gwadar as part of the over $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.\n\nIn the past, the BLA has specifically targeted Chinese interests — in particular the strategic port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea, accusing Beijing of helping Islamabad exploit the province. It has killed Chinese citizens working in the region and attacked Beijing’s consulate in Karachi.\n\nThe BLA showed its muscle when it audaciously stormed army bases in 2022 and then a navy base later that year.\n\nExpanding its traditional use of guerrilla gunmen, it has also recently begun using women suicide bombers, seen in an attack on Chinese nationals on a university campus in Karachi.\n\nThe group has since targeted both military and Chinese officials, including launching an attack on Gwadar in March.\n\nThe BLA was at the center of tit-for-tat strikes earlier this year between Iran and Pakistan over what they called militant bases on each other’s territory, which brought the two neighbors close to war.\n\nIslamabad says it has struck BLA bases inside Iranian territory from where the militants plotted attacks in Pakistan.\n\n“NOT THE FIRST TIME”\n\nSyed Ali Shah, a Quetta-based journalist covering militancy in Balochistan, said this was not the first time BLA had carried out such coordinated attacks, but agreed they would have a “far-reaching impact” on foreign investments at a time the South Asian country is struggling to meet external financial needs as part of a $7 billion bailout loan that is pending approval by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) executive board.\n\n“It will have an impact on the investors, particularly the Chinese,” Shah said. “For investment, the first condition is peace and security. If such incidents are taking place, as currently a surge is seen in such attacks, it would impact Pakistan’s efforts to attract and secure international investment.”\n\nThe latest attacks coincided with the 18th anniversary of the killing of Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, a prominent Baloch politician and a tribal chief who was killed in a military operation in August 2006, inflaming the insurgency in Balochistan. The province saw major attacks till 2012, followed by a period of relative calm for around seven years when reconciliation efforts resulted in many separatist leaders laying down arms.\n\n“But the militants have again intensified their activities in Balochistan,” Shah said.\n\nThe surge in violence also comes amid protests led by young ethnic Baloch against what they describe as a pattern of enforced disappearances and other human rights abuses by security forces, who deny the charge.\n\nThe insurgency and the protests continue to keep the mineral rich province of some 15 million people unstable and have created security concerns around Pakistan’s plans to access untapped resources under Balochistan’s desert and mountainous terrain.\n\nSpeaking to Arab News, a Pakistani intelligence official who requested anonymity, accused “hostile intelligence agencies,” a veiled reference mostly to India and Afghanistan but also Iran, of conspiring to disrupt investments and development in Balochistan.\n\n“Enemies of peace want to disrupt the stability in Balochistan with agenda-driven moves to sabotage the development projects under CPEC,” he said.\n\nSeparatists, he added, wanted to push the province into the “stone age” by destroying roads, highways and other infrastructure.\n\n“On behest of inimical and hostile forces, these cowardly acts of terrorism were aimed at disrupting the peaceful environment and development of Balochistan by targeting mainly the innocent civilians,” the Pakistan army said in a statement on Monday.\n\n“Security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan in step with the nation, remain determined to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan.”\n\nRAWALPINDI: A lack of quality backup is eroding the strength of the national team, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi said in the wake of the embarrassing 10-wicket loss to Bangladesh in the first test.\n\n“It was a very disappointing loss,” Naqvi said Monday, a day after Bangladesh’s historic maiden test win against Pakistan in 14 test matches at Rawalpindi.\n\n“The problem is the selection committee has no pool to turn to” for high-quality replacement players, he said.\n\nPakistan has been searching for a test win at home since its last victory over South Africa at Rawalpindi in December 2021. The first-test loss was its fifth at home in that span, which also includes four draws.\n\nNaqvi had spoken about conducting a big overhaul after Pakistan was eliminated from the Super Eight at the T20 World Cup, losing to archrival India and the tournament co-host United States team.\n\n“We want to fix our problems,” Naqvi said, “but when we look at how to resolve them, we don’t have any solid data or (elite) players pool which we can draw from.”\n\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board is planning to use AI to help harness a pool of backup players from the newly announced 50-over tournament – Champions Cup – scheduled to be held from Sept. 12-29.\n\nPakistan cricket stalwarts Waqar Younis, Saqlain Mushtaq, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shoaib Malik and Sarfaraz Ahmed will work as mentors of the five teams in the Champions Cup.\n\n“This Cup will make domestic cricket strong, we’ll have a pool of 150 players, and then the surgery will be done by the selection committee,” Naqvi said, adding that critics have been urging for an immediate overhaul of the test team. “But you can’t dump someone unless you have a better one to replace them.”\n\nPakistan surprisingly went without a specialist spinner in the series-opener against Bangladesh but its ploy to go with four pace bowlers backfired. Bangladesh took a solid 117-run first-innings lead after it scored 565 in reply to Pakistan’s 448-6 declared.\n\nPakistan crumbled for 146 in the second innings against Bangladesh spinners Shakib Al Hasan and Mehidy Hasan Miraz, who collected seven wickets in between them.\n\n“Losing to Bangladesh is sad but the selection committee had given the team 17 players,” Naqvi said. “If the coach or captain aren’t playing some of them, that’s their decision. The team management may have made a mistake, but that has nothing to do with the selection committee.”"
