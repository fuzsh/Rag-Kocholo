        "text": "On Thursday, March 10, In the northern German city of Hamburg, shots were fired inside Jehovah’s Witnesses church.\n\nThe police said that the motive of the attack is not clear yet adding that the attacker may be among the dead. Police declined to reveal how many people died but did state that several were seriously injured.\n\nAccording to the Bild newspaper, the shooting at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses in a northern Hamburg district of Germany resulted in seven fatalities and left eight injured.\n\nSeveral local media reports have also stated that around six people lost their lives in the attack.\n\nAccording to a reporter on the scene and reported by Germany’s DPA news agency, local residents in Hamburg’s northern Alsterdorf district had received mobile phone alerts of a “life-threatening situation” and that streets had been closed.\n\nWe heard gunfire, a witness informed reporters. He claimed that there was 12 continuous gunfire. “Then we saw how people were taken away in black bags,” the witness reportedly said.\n\nAs for the shooting in the Gross Borstel district of Hamburg, police spokesperson Holger Vehren stated, “We just know that several people died here; other people are wounded, they were rushed to hospitals.” Vehren has also not confirmed the local media reports which claimed that six to seven people have been killed in the attack. He reportedly said that the police were informed about the incident at 9:15 p.m. following which the police rushed to the spot.\n\n“Then there were shots on the upper floor and a dead person was found there. We assume that it is the perpetrator.”, Holger Vehren told the media.\n\nEarly on Friday morning, Hamburg police stated on Twitter that they believed that there was only one shooter and that they were gradually withdrawing security forces from the area.\n\n“We found a dead person in a community center in #GroßBorstel who we believe could be a perpetrator. In order to rule out the involvement of other perpetrators, we carry out checks and search extensively,” Hamburg Police tweeted.\n\nEarlier Hamburg police stated that the motive behind the shooting remains unclear.\n\nPeter Tschentscher, the mayor of Hamburg, tweeted that the news of the attack was “shocking” and offered his sympathy to the relatives of the victims.\n\n“The reports from Alsterdorf/Groß Borstel are shocking. My deepest condolences to the families of the victims. The emergency services are working flat out to track down the perpetrator(s) and to clarify the background,” Tschentscher tweeted.\n\nIn a veiled attack on Congress MP Rahul Gandhi who recently delivered a lecture at Cambridge University in the UK, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Thursday said while India is having its moments of glory G20 presidency, some parliamentarians are engaged in the thoughtless unfair denigration of our well-nurtured democratic values\n\nVice President Dhankhar released a book on Mundaka Upanishad written by Dr Karan Singh. Addressing the gathering at the event, Dhankhar said India is the most functional democracy that has evoked global recognition. India is setting global discourse on many issues.\n\n“How ironic how painful! While the world is applauding our historic accomplishments as a functional vibrant democracy, some amongst us including parliamentarians are engaged in the thoughtless unfair denigration of our well-nurtured democratic values. How can we justify such wanton orchestration of a factually untenable narrative,” he said.\n\nIn a veiled attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his remarks in the UK, the Vice President said, “Mark the timing of this unwholesome misadventure – While India is having its moments of glory– as President of G20 and there are people outside of the country working in overdrive to denigrate us. Such misplaced campaign mode to taint and tarnish our parliament and constitutional entities is too serious and exceptional to be ignored or countenanced. No political strategy or partisan stance can justify compromising of our nationalism and democratic values.”\n\n“If I observe silence on this misadventure-orchestration by a Member of Parliament outside the country which is ill-premised, unwholesome and motivated, I would be on the wrong side of the Constitution. It will be constitutional culpability and outrage of my oath of office,” Dhankhar said.\n\n“How can I sanctify a statement that mikes in Indian Parliament mikes are put off? How can people say so? Has there been any illustration?” he stated.\n\nIn reference to the Emergency, Dhankhar said the country has a dark chapter of political history. Proclamation of Emergency was the darkest period any democracy can suffer.\n\nHe said Indian democratic polity is now mature and there can be no repeat of that.\n\nDhankhar said, “Anyone who says so, inside or outside the country, that in Indian Parliament Mikes are put off… Imagine this being done after having held the floor for nearly 50 minutes. Such kind of wanton and misadventure to run down our democratic values cannot be countenanced.”\n\nVice President said if he observes silence, the mass majority of people who believe in the nation will be silent forever. He said the country cannot allow such type of narrative to gain momentum by those elements who wish to antidote India’s rising growth.\n\n“You run down our judiciary on foreign soil. Where on the planet is a judiciary that acts with lightning speed?” he said adding India’s judiciary is made with the most brilliant minds in the world.\n\nHe said the contemporaneous scenario in the temples of democracy is worrisome.”Disruption and not decorum is the order of the day,” Dhankhar said.\n\n“Undoubtedly our people are concerned and anguished with projection as disruptors of proceedings, shouters of slogans and practitioners of indecorous conduct -throwing papers and whipping out mikes and walking into the well of the house? Our Parliamentarians need to exemplify conduct worth emulating,” he added.\n\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said it is the duty of every Indian living around the world to protect democracy” India’s democracy.\n\nThe Congress MP, who was on a visit to the UK, criticised the Centre alleging that an attack has been unleashed on the basic structure of Indian democracy.\n\nThe Congress MP, who is visiting the UK, criticised the Centre alleging that an attack has been unleashed on the basic structure of Indian democracy.\n\nRahul Gandhi in an interaction at the Chatham House in London termed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) a “fundamentalist” and “fascist” organisation alleging that it has captured pretty much all of India’s institutions.\n\nHe said, “The nature of democratic contest in India has completely changed and the reason is that one organisation called RSS – a fundamentalist, fascist organisation has basically captured pretty much all of India’s institutions.”\n\nRahul Gandhi further said Europe and the US are not doing enough to restore democracy in India as they are getting trade and money from the country. “Why Europe and the US – the defenders of democracies were oblivious of how a huge chunk of democracy in India has come undone?” he questioned.\n\nThe Congress leader also mentioned how the various institutions in the country were under threat.\n\n“It shocked me how successful they have been at capturing the different institutions of our country. Press, Judiciary, Parliament, and Election Commission are all under threat and are controlled in one way or the other,” Rahul Gandhi said.\n\n“You can ask any Opposition leader as to how agencies are used. My phone had Pegasus on it, which was not happening when we were in power,” he added.\n\nThe Congress MP highlighted the condition of the Dalits and minorities in India.\n\nHe said, “In India, you can see what is being done to Dalits, tribals, and minorities. It is not that Congress is saying it. There are articles in the foreign press all the time that there is a serious problem with Indian democracy.”\n\n(This news report is published from a syndicated feed. Except for the headline, the content has not been written or edited by OpIndia staff)\n\nOn Wednesday, the Maharashtra government police booked two of its officers named Udayraj Shukla and Sandesh Pawar and sent them to police headquarters for allegedly unnecessarily assaulting a person belonging to a local Hindu group while he was going to the farm. The incident is said to have happened in the Shembalpimpri region of Pusad in the Yavatmal district. The victim, who claims to be a part of Bajrang Dal is also believed to have been named in a false case by the duo.\n\nThe government action in the case was confirmed by Amol Baburao Patankar who is under secretary to the state Dy Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis. “Prompt Action Taken! Report of Yavatmal Police regarding the Shembalpimpri issue! Injustice will not be tolerated to any extent,” he tweeted.\n\nSuperintendent of Police Yavatmal, Dr. Pavan Basode mentioned in the letter dated March 8 that a Hindu person named Mahesh was unnecessarily beaten by police while he was on his way to the farm and directed the two police officers to submit a detailed report in the case within three days. The sections imposed against the Police officers named in the case are sections 143, 147, 149, 323, 504, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nThe action was reportedly taken after victim Mahesh filed a complaint against the police officers and stated that the Police deliberately fractured his hand and broke his both legs on March 7. “I was on my way to the farm. At around 4 pm, the police officers arrived from nowhere and trapped me. They abused me and began assaulting me,” Mahesh said in the complaint, the copies of which he sent to Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission, Sub-divisional office, Pusad, and MLA Sanjay Rathod.\n\nMahesh also said that the police failed to provide a reason for the assault and kept on beating him with a rod and cane. They also happened to threaten Mahesh. As per the complaint submitted by the victim, the Police said, “You have become arrogant. If you even think of complaining about this assault, we’ll not spare you. Nobody can take action against us. Better you keep your mouth shut otherwise you’ll have to face dire consequences.” The officers left the spot.\n\nThe victim was then immediately taken to the hospital by a passerby. He, however, was again manhandled by the same officers after he went to the Khandala Police Station to complain about the assault.\n\nOpIndia talked to the brother of the victim, Sharad, who confirmed the development and said that the Police also tried to pressure Mahesh by falsely accusing him in a fake case. “Few days ago Mahesh had an argument with a Muslim rickshaw driver named Rasool in the main city circle. The duo fought over a minor traffic issue which was resolved then and there. The Police after beating Mahesh on March 7 contacted Rasool and persuaded him to file an FIR against Mahesh. He (Rasool) himself has confirmed that the police officers had gone to his place and requested him to file an FIR. This was all to impose pressure upon Mahesh, to prevent him from registering a complaint against the police officers who beat him,” Sharad said.\n\nHe also added that Mahesh was beaten in front of a small hotel, which falls on his way to the farm. According to the brother of the victim, the Police also approached the hotel owner and asked him to book Mahesh in a false case accusing him of forcefully barging into the hotel premises and creating a fuss thereafter.\n\nSharad further informed OpIndia that Mahesh was accompanied by some of his friends on his way to the farm. However, the other ran away from the spot after the Police began brutally beating Mahesh.\n\nAnother brother of victim, Kailas, told OpIndia that the police officer named Sandesh Pawar possesses friendly relations with the Muslims in the district. “He also had requested the Muslim rickshaw driver to file case against Mahesh,” he claimed. “Mahesh is a Bajrang Dal member and is active in Hindu activities happening in the city and around areas. We still are unaware of the reason why Mahesh was so brutally beaten,” he added. He also shared a few images of the injuries donned by the victim after the attack.\n\nAfter the matter escalated, the police officer named in the case, Sandesh Pawar has apologized for the incident, a video of which was shared by Kailas on his Twitter handle.\n\nSharad meanwhile claimed that two unnecessary FIRs have been filed against Mahesh at present. The victim has been booked under section 160 (Punishment for committing affray) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The state headquarters reportedly has taken cognizance of the incident and has directed the officers to submit a detailed report by March 11.\n\n(OpIndia contacted the Yavatmal LCB and also SI Dr Pavan Bansode for their comments in the case. But the calls remained unanswered. The story will be updated once the details are availed)\n\nIn a country witnessing rapid growth, it comes as no surprise that India also has one of the fastest-growing fintech landscapes in the world, driven primarily by the advancement in digital payments segment. A recent report by PhonePe and Boston Consulting Group concluded that India’s digital payments market will more than triple from USD 3 trillion to USD 10 trillion by 2026.\n\nIn 2015, the Indian Union government launched its Digital India programme, with one of the objectives to achieve a “faceless, paperless and cashless” status for financial transactions at grass-root level. In line with this, the use of digital payments continues to be promoted so that each citizen of the country can access digital payment facilities that are affordable, convenient and secure. The introduction of innovative reforms and technological advancements are further accelerating growth at an unprecedented pace.\n\nWhen one thinks digital payments, UPI – India’s payment gateway – instantly comes to mind. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has been the flag-bearer of India’s fintech revolution – launched in 2016 by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).\n\nThe UPI is an instant real-time payments system that enables inter-bank peer-to-peer and person-to-merchant transactions through mobile devices instantly.\n\nIn a span of just six years, India, primarily a cash-based economy, now leads the world in real-time digital payments, accounting for almost 40 per cent of all such transactions.\n\nThe mass adoption of UPI during the COVID-19 pandemic has extended far beyond the urban to even rural India, an effect that left the experts in amazement.\n\nAs the success of the UPI grows, so does its attractiveness and acceptance by other countries; for instance, on February 21, 2023, India and Singapore launched cross-border connectivity between UPI and its equivalent in Singapore called PayNow, enabling low-cost and faster cross-border transactions.\n\nThis initiative is also closely aligned with the India’s G20 financial inclusion priorities of driving faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border payments. It also generated interest from Latin American countries to use the system or one similar to it in their countries.\n\nAlong with this, the coming together of the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) trinity is further fuelling financial inclusion in India like never before. The Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana aims to provide bank accounts to the unbanked and Aadhaar — the flagship product of the Unique Identification Authority of India–is a simple and effective method to verify individuals and beneficiaries based on their biometric information.\n\nThese two programmes are closely linked with the mobile. The success of these programmes is evident by the numbers they reflect — the Jan-Dhan Yojana initiative has seen the opening of more than 460 million bank accounts and nearly 99 per cent of the Indian population now has an Aadhaar number.\n\nNow, a global leader in the fintech space, India does not seem to be slowing down its pace in terms of disrupting traditional financial services. Reflecting this is India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement of the systematic introduction of the digital rupee by the central bank at the Union Budget 2022-2023.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) latest concept note highlights the digital rupee’s potential design choices and implications. In December 2022, RBI announced the launch of the first pilot for the retail digital rupee; this pilot will test the robustness of the entire process of digital rupee creation, distribution, and retail use in real time. Different features and applications of the eRs-R token and architecture will be tested in future phases of the pilot, based on the insights gained from this one.\n\nIn addition, the National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC) system has also witnessed substantial growth. With the FASTag now mandatory for all four-wheeler vehicles across the country at highways for toll collection, digital payments have received and are likely to record a further boost. The NETC is live across at least 429 toll plazas across the country, and more than 36 million FASTags have been issued to date.\n\nThe utility service provider, Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS), offers online and on-ground bill payment services to customers. These include the payment of utility bills such as those for electricity, gas, and water.\n\nGovernment initiatives aimed at building better infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, will lead to an increasing number of households with electricity and water supply, adding more demand for telecom and gas connections, and subsequently increasing the customer base of BBPS users.\n\nAs per a PwC report, by 2025-2026, new biller categories are expected to reach an estimated value of USD 14.5 billion with existing categories still accounting for a majority of the transaction value at an estimate of USD 27 billion.\n\nWhile the vast majority of these payment solutions work in online mode, geographical barriers and lack of access to internet connectivity can hamper their growth.\n\nRealising this, fintech companies are exploring the concept of offline payments. For instance, India’s largest private-sector lender HDFC Bank is attempting to execute digital payments in offline mode under the RBI’s Regulatory Sandbox programme.\n\nIf successful, this could drastically alter the digital payment landscape by leaps and bounds and accelerate financial inclusion in remote areas untouched by internet connectivity.\n\n(This news report is published from a syndicated feed. Except for the headline, the content has not been written or edited by OpIndia staff)\n\nThe migrant workers from Bihar are in the news again. The last time it was discussed was during the coronavirus pandemic when migrant labourers walked back to their homes amid the lockdown. Lakhs of Biharis leave their villages and towns for work in India’s more prosperous states. The thing is, despite tons of news articles and media coverage, political debates and outrages, the ground realities have not changed. If they had, they won’t be migrant workers from Bihar.\n\nFutile promises of employment by the politicians of Bihar\n\nNo new big industries have been established n Bihar in the past decades. Without any big industry, labourers from Bihar move to the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh seeking jobs. Politicians from various parties cite different reasons for this. For example, Nitish Kumar once said during the 2020 assembly election campaign that Bihar doesn’t have industries because it doesn’t have a coastline. He essentially meant that large industries are established in states that have seashores.\n\nOn the other hand, Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav looks at government jobs as the solution to this problem. He had promised to give 10 lakh government jobs in the very first cabinet meeting if his party is voted to power. Nitish Kumar and Tejaswi Yadav are ruling the state in an alliance they formed in August 2022, but the promise is yet not fulfilled despite so many cabinet meetings being held.\n\nWith the state government not fulfilling their promise of 10 lakh government jobs, students and young aspirants in Bihar protested for the jobs and the Bihar police lathi-charged the agitating youths. Now the veteran chief minister and young deputy chief minister have shifted their promise from 10 lakh government jobs to ‘generating opportunities for employment for 10 lakh people’.\n\nIt is evident in this situation to ponder a thought over the possible ways to stop the Bihari labourers from migrating to other states for jobs. Is government jobs the only way to stop the forced migration from Bihar? Or it is only the big industries that can bring about a change in the situation? Can’t employment be created in the state without big industries? Is it not possible to change the state without special category status or central package?\n\nBihar’s local industries died an unregistered death in the last three decades\n\nTo understand the problem and its root cause, let’s take the example of Kenar Chatti located at a distance of 28 kilometres from Gaya – one of the most crowded cities in Bihar. Once this place was known for the manufacturing of bronze and brass utensils. Traders used to come to Kenar Chatti from different parts of Bihar, nearby states, and even Nepal.\n\n50 local families were directly involved in the work of making bronze and brass utensils. Today this number has reduced to 5 houses. The members of the rest of the families either became hawkers or turned from artisans to labourers. Some members of the families who are still associated with this work have now migrated to other states for earning their livelihoods.\n\nAs it happened\n\nDuring a visit to Kenar Chatti in the year 2020, I met 60-year-old Rajmohan Kasera who said at that time, “As far as I remember, no government ever made any efforts to keep the industry afloat. So many MLAs came here, clicked photos, and went back after assuring us that they will do something to promote the local business. None of them looked back at us. This shattered the hope of our people, so we started doing other jobs. We have to do it to run the families. If government provides proper help and support, the 50 families who used to do this work will be uplifted and the work will be revived.”\n\nIn the 2020 assembly elections, politicians in Bihar made big promises to stop migration. But Kenar Chatti’s situation did not change even in 2023. In fact, those big promises were made because the migrant workers who returned home due to Corona were present in the state in large numbers to cast their votes. As the economy recovered from Corona, they again left their homes and went to different parts of the country for their jobs.\n\nVillages in Bihar today are bereft of men of working age. The only males left are the ones too old or too young to travel for work.\n\nThere are so many similar cases in Bihar\n\nThis is not just the story of one place called Kenar Chatti. This is the story of the whole Bihar state. Every part of Bihar once had its own local industry. Most of these industries were agri-based. Because of this, farming was not a loss-making deal for farmers like it has become today. Also, migration to other states was not the only option for the workers in Bihar.\n\nRecent migrations from Bihar are way different than the older ones\n\nIn his work Migration and Achievements of Maithil Pandits, Jagdish Chandra Jha mentions that Maithil people have always been going to other areas of the country for better opportunities, having greater economic benefits. However, there is a significant difference between the migrations then and the migrations in current times.\n\nIn old times people used to bring with them new techniques of agriculture, ways to live a healthy life, and the tricks of setting up domestic industries as they returned to their homes. It was because of this exchange of ideas, knowledge, and techniques that the industry in Bihar was growing despite the usual migrations.\n\nFor example, the industry of muslin cloth in Madhubani, cheap clothes in Dulalganj, and paper in Kishanganj flourished despite migrations. Darbhanga became a major production centre of ivory goods. Areas like Khagaria and Kishanganj were known for brass, and bronze utensils. Bhagalpur was famous for Silk while Munger became famous for horseshoes, stoves, and shoes. Purnia was famous for Sindoor and for the production and export of tent house goods.\n\nLocal industries continued to flourish for a while after the independence\n\nApart from this, many public sector undertakings in independent India were also set up in different parts of the state. Sugar mills, textile industries, jute industries, tobacco processing units, dal mills, flour mills, oil mills, etc. are a few to name.\n\nBig private sector companies like Rohtas Industries Limited (Dalmia Nagar), Ashok Paper Mill (Darbhanga), and Hind Engineering Company (Barauni) also started operating in Bihar. A fertilizer factory was established in Barauni in 1946. An oil refinery was also set up here. The railway workshop was started at Jamalpur in Munger and the Bharat Wagon and Engineering Company Limited started its unit in Mokama. The part of Jharkhand carved out of Bihar, was identified with industries and minerals.\n\nMany cities in Bihar had industrial potential\n\nDifferent cities in Bihar (and Jharkhand) were known for different industries. The below-mentioned list of cities and the industries they are known for briefly explains the extent of various sectors that used to flourish in Bihar and Jharkhand.\n\nLac Production Industries: Gaya and Purniya\n\nOil Mills: Patna, Munger, Shahabad\n\nPaper and Pulp Industry: Dalmia Nagar, Samastipur, Darbhanga, Patna, Barauni\n\nPlywood: Hajipur\n\nLeather Industry: Gaya, Digha, Mokama\n\nCement Industry: Dalmia Nagar, Khelari\n\nTobacco Industry: Munger, Buxar, Gaya, Ara\n\nLiquor Factory: Munger, Patna, Manpur, Panchrukhi\n\nGlass Industry: Patna\n\nGun Industry: Munger\n\nButton Industry: Dalsinghsarai\n\nMatchbox Production: Katihar\n\nBlanket Industry: Gaya, Purniya, Aurangabad, Motihari\n\nBeedi Industry: Bihar Sharif, Jhajha, Jamui\n\nHandloom Industry: Madhubani, Bhagalpur, Bihar Sharif, Gaya, Patna, Munger\n\nUtensils Industry: Siwan, Bihta\n\nNone of these local industries is functioning today. The factories have turned into ruins and scrapyards. Those who were once artisans are working as labourers today, far away from their homes. On various occasions, these migrant Bihari labourers become targets of violence in different states.\n\nWho is responsible for the migration of labourers from Bihar to other states?\n\nThere is not just a single factor responsible for this situation in Bihar. But the spurt in joblessness that Bihar has witnessed in the last few decades is only because of the policies framed by Congress, Lalu Prasad Yadav’s Jungle Raj, and Nitish Kumar’s alleged “good governance”.\n\nWhen Congress enjoyed uninterrupted power from the Centre to the state, it neglected these industries in Bihar. Rather, the Congress governments enacted laws that encouraged industrialists to set up industries outside Bihar.\n\nWhen Lalu Prasad Yadav, the pioneer of the Jungle raj, came to power in Bihar, he started saying openly that development is not his agenda. He would claim that his agenda is to bring ‘social justice’. Due to this, Bihar almost came to a standstill in the race for development. Old industries were destroyed one after the other. Job creation and industrialisation were sacrificed at the altar of appeasement and virtue signalling.\n\nIn almost two decades of Nitish Kumar’s regime, there has been a lot of talk of development, but employment opportunities have not been created. This holds true despite Nitish Kumar sharing power with the BJP or with the RJD and other parties. This is why the local aspirants working in various industries in Bihar were forced to go away from their homeland because of a lack of opportunities.\n\nThe ‘Push Factor’\n\nDr Praveen Jha is the author of ‘Coolie Lines’, a book on indentured labourers. He lives in Norway. He told OpIndia in 2020, “If migration is called relocation or travel, it is an opportunity. This is the reason why migration has also been taking place from the prosperous states of India (Gujarat and Punjab). The influx of foreign money has been enriching them. This is called the ‘pull factor’ in displacement. That is when you go to a place for a better opportunity. That is when the better opportunity pulls you towards itself. But the word ‘migration’ is associated with anger when it has the role of ‘push factor’ more than ‘pull factor’. The ‘push factor’ is a major reason for migration from Bihar. The reason for this migration has been the closure of local industries and jungle raj.”\n\nThe push factor means the people are forced to leave their native places to survive, to earn a basic livelihood, not for ‘better prospects’ of socio-economic ambitions.\n\nReasons of migration\n\nSenior sociologist Naval Kishor Chaudhary, a former principal of Patna College, considers both social and economic reasons for this. According to him, migration from Bihar gained momentum due to the following reasons:\n\n1. In the decade of 90s, Bihar witnessed widespread caste discrimination and subsequent violence. This caused a mass migration of different classes from different parts of the affected areas.\n\n2. Industries in the state were closing one after the other and no new businesses were established. This not only stopped new employment opportunities but also eliminated the already available jobs. This forced people to go to other states of the country in large numbers to work as labourers.\n\n3. With changing power equations, the backward classes started tending more toward working as a labourer in a metro city rather than doing a similar job in their villages and towns. Our social structure is such that people quite comfortably do jobs in metro cities that they are otherwise ashamed to do in their own villages or towns. They feel that no one watches them doing it in the city.\n\n4. The abolition of ancestral occupations also forced people to migrate as labourers. It happened in two ways. For example, there was a section of barbers, iron smiths, and potters who were doing their ancestral works in the villages and were not ready to take this work forward. They went to the cities. For those who wanted to stay associated with the ancestral business, there was a crisis of livelihood due to the migration of other classes from the villages. Gradually, they also moved to metros.\n\n5. Every year, floods and droughts also force people in large numbers to migrate from rural areas to work as labourers in metros.\n\nEffects of certain acts\n\nSenior journalist Surendra Kishor hails from Bihar. He observes that one of the major reasons for this is the Rail Fare Normalization Act. This law was made by the central government after independence and it ended in the 90s. Under this law, the freight rate for the transportation of coal from Dhanbad to Ranchi was the same as it would take to reach Chennai. It encouraged industrialists to set up coal-based industries near the seashore.\n\nSurendra Kishor told OpIndia, “Had this law been there in the British era, there would be no Tata Nagar. Then Tatas would set up their industry in cities like Mumbai. Due to this dishonest approach of the central government, Bihar suffered a loss of at least Rs 10 lakh crore. Industries did not develop as expected in the state. Agriculture has not developed like in Punjab. The population increased. Employment opportunities were not being created at the local level. In such a situation, migration for jobs became a must.”\n\nWill the people of Bihar be able to change this?\n\nThe way out to stop migration from Bihar is not just big industries, government jobs, special status, or central government packages. It can be stopped only by reestablishing industries according to different areas of the state. The Yogi Adityanath government is promoting the One District One Product scheme to encourage the flourishing of local industries in various districts across the state. Likewise, efforts can be taken in Bihar too. This is a tried and tested model. The improvement in education standards, vocational training from an earlier age and general entrepreneur-friendly governance can go a long distance in creating job opportunities at different levels.\n\nBut, finding solutions to address the crisis is neither a priority for the common people of Bihar nor for the political parties. In such a situation, no one knows when this trend of migrating for jobs will end. Bihar will continue to be a BIMARU state, and the word ‘Bihari’ will be used as abuse until the ‘Bihari’ stereotype is a poor migrant worker in a perpetual state of fleeing, either from his village to a big city, or running from a big city to his village because he is scared to stay there.\n\nThe Hindi version of this article can be read here."
