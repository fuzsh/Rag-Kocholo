Based on this presidential order, the High Court for the then-N.W.F.P had to be called the Peshawar High Court, with its principal seat at Peshawar. In accordance with the 1973 Constitution, the Court has two Benches, one at Abbottabad and the other at DI Khan.

He also equaled the record of Jahangir Khan for most successive World Open titles, when he lifted the trophy five consecutive times from 1992-1996.\n\nThe former Pakistan Hockey Team Captain, Sohail Abbas is the highest goal scorer of all time with 348 goals. He is the first player in the history of international hockey to score more than 300 goals. He scored 60 times in 1999, a record for the most number of goals in a year.

The record lasted for more than 17 years and was eventually broken by New Zealand’s Corey Anderson, who scored a century off 36 balls against West Indies on January 1, 2014 at Queenstown. Anderson’s record lasted just over a year, as South Africa’s AB de Villiers scored an hundred against West Indies off just 31 balls at Johannesburg on January 18, 2015.\n\nPakistan’s Hockey Team is the most successful team in the men’s Hockey World Cup, winning four titles. The Green Shirts won the first ever Hockey World Cup in 1971, when they defeated Spain 1-0 in Barcelona, Spain. The second victory came in 1978, when Pakistan defeated the Netherlands with a 3-2 triumph. The third one came on Indian soil in 1982, when they defeated West Germany 3-1 in the final. The fourth title win came in 1994, when Pakistan again defeated the Netherlands in Sydney, Australia. The Pakistan hockey team also has the most number of gold medals at the Asian Games, winning a record eight times in just fifteen tournaments.\n\nOn May 21, 1997, Pakistan opener Saeed Anwar scored the highest number of runs in an innings by a player in an ODI match, when he struck 194 runs against India in Chennai. The record lasted for about 13 years, when on February 24, 2010, India’s Sachin Tendulkar broke his record against South Africa in India. The current record for the longest innings in the 50-over format is held by India’s Rohit Sharma, as he scored 264 runs against Sri Lanka in 2014.\n\nOn November 2, 2014, Misbah ul Haq scored a century off 56 balls and equaled the record for the fastest century in Tests with Sir Vivian Richards’ record. The record was then broken by New Zealand’s Brendon McCullum in 2016, when he scored 100 runs from 54 balls against Australia at Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\nOn February 25, 2003, Wasim Akram became the first man in the history of Cricket to take 500 One-Day international wickets.\n\nPakistan’s Mohammad Yousuf holds the record for the most number of runs scored in a calendar year in Tests. He scored 1788 in 11 tests at the average of 99.33 in 2006.\n\nFormer Pakistan pacer Jalal-Ud-din was the first bowler in international cricket to take a hat-trick in ODI in 1982.\n\nHanif Mohammad holds the record for the longest Test innings in terms of minutes. He batted for 970 minutes (16.16 hours) against West Indies in 1958.\n\nFormer Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar bowled the fastest recorded ball in the history of cricket against England in a World Cup match at South Africa in 2003. The last ball of his second over was recorded at 161.3km/h or 100.2mph, which bettered his previous mark of 161.0km/h from April 2002.\n\nThe youngest players to take a hat-trick in all three forms of the game are from Pakistan. In ODIs, Aqib Javed took a hat-trick at 19 years and 81 days, against India in 1991. In Tests, Naseem Shah took a hat-trick at just 16 years and 359 days, against Bangladesh in 2020. In T20Is, Mohammad Hasnain became the youngest to take a hat-trick at 19 years and 183 days of age, against Sri Lanka in 2019.\n\nIn ODIs, Pakistan team has the second most number of hat-tricks taken by a team with eight hat-tricks. In these eight, two each were taken by Wasim Akram and Saqlian Mushtaq.\n\nThe former Pakistani right-handed batsman, Hasan Raza holds the record for the youngest ever Test cricketer.
