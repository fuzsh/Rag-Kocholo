        "text": "India captain Rohit Sharma rubbished allegations of ball-tampering against the Indian fast bowlers when he addressed the press on the eve of India's T20 World Cup 2024 semi-final against England. Rohit Sharma urged the detractors to 'apply your mind' and understand the conditions before making baseless allegations.\n\nRohit Sharma's comment came after former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq accused Arshdeep Singh of tampering with the ball during their game against Australia in the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"What answer will I give? If you are playing under the sun and the wickets are this dry, the ball will reverse on its own. The ball is reversing for all teams. Not just for us. Sometimes, it's important to open your mind (use your brain). You have to understand where we are playing. We are not playing in England or Australia,\" Rohit Sharma said.\n\nT20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats\n\nThe India captain was not willing to take any bit of the allegation that was levelled against left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh, who found a reverse swing with the old ball in India's 24-run win over Australia in St Lucia. Arshdeep, who removed David Warner with the new ball, returned to cause more trouble for the Australians with the old ball. He got the big wicket of dangerous Tim David and wicketkeeper Matthew Wade to derail Australia's chase of 206.\n\nWHAT INZAMAM-UL-HAQ SAID\n\nHowever, Inzamam-ul-Haq, speaking on live television, made a bizarre claim, urging umpires to be more careful and spot ball tampering instances during India's games in the T20 World Cup.\n\n\"Arshdeep Singh, when he was bowling the 15th over, the ball was reversing. is it too early (for reverse swing) with the new ball? This means the ball was ready for reverse swing by the 12th or the 13th over. Umpires should keep their eyes open (to spot) these things.\n\n\"If it was Pakistani bowlers (reverse swinging the ball) this would have been a big issue. We know reverse swing very well and if Arshdeep can come in the 15th over and start reversing the ball, it means some serious work had been done before,\" Inzamam said.\n\nFormer Pakistan batter Salim Malik, who was also part of the panel, backed Inzamam's claim, accusing the Indian fast bowlers of tampering with the ball.\n\nThis is not the first time former Pakistan players have come up with bizarre and baseless allegations against Indian players. During the 2023 World Cup in India, former cricketer Hasan Raza claimed that India used chips inside the ball and found more success than other fast bowlers. The accusation was aimed at Mohammed Shami, who was unstoppable with his match-winning spells.\n\nShami responded to Hasan Raza's claims expressing surprise at the lack of understanding of the game.\n\n\"Does this ball have any device? (laughs while looking at the ball). When I heard this, I wondered 'how can someone ask such a stupid question?'. Even I think about it (that claim) now, I am not able to control my laughter,\" Shami told Aajtak."
