        "text": "Tablighi Jamaat is one of the influential and widespread Islamic movements among the Muslims around the world, which is originated in northern part of India in 1920s by Moulana Muhammad Ilyas Kandhalawi (1885–1944). It has spread to some 165 countries, including Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, its annual three-day mass congregation, commonly known as ijtema near Dhaka attracts more than five million people. Ijtema is an essential part of the Tablighi Jamaat around the world. Ijtema plays a significant role on the lives of many Muslims in Bangladesh. The huge number of engaging people in ijtema shows its popularity. Many countries also celebrate this event in a similar way. The current paper argues that ijtema provides a new idea of pilgrimage among the Muslims in Bangladesh. This paper also shows that participation in ijtema increases religious authority, status and empowerment. Finally, it examines how does ijtema contributes on the Muslim identity through the idea of brotherhood and ummah.\n\nThe article examines the process of making an Islamist public sphere in Bangladesh and identifies the actors involved. It argues that Islamist social Islamization movements in the form of various da'wa (preaching) activities, madrassah activisms, and Islamist political parties' Islamization projects collectively contribute to the making of an Islamist public sphere. It shows how da'wa movements' everyday living experiences, madrassah's absolute authority over public Islam, and Islamist political parties' social welfare, and associated activities construct an Islamist imagination. A parallel counter Islamist discursive arena with secular discourse is in construction and circulation that formulates oppositional interpretations based on Islamist identities, interests, and needs. The article argues that instead of explicitly challenging the secular hegemonic discourse, Islamist social movements engage in a contested relationship with it, and gradually claim their separate position. It further maintains that although these Islamist movements differ ideologically, and vary the ways they perform and propagate Islam, they invariably contribute to the rise of an Islamist public sphere in Bangladesh.\n\nAmong the various and great Islamic movements, Tablighi Jamaat has emerged arguably the most widely followed movement in the Islamic world. Emerging from the social , economic and religious conditions of the Mewat region, near Delhi around 1926, it has come to establish its presence in and over one hundred and fifty countries throughout the world with adherents in between 100 to 150 million. This is primarily because of the unique ideology it has pursued in its dawah (call towards Islam) and has further capacity to flourish in a wide range of social and political environments. In this paper an effort has been made to through light on the ideological structure of the Tablighi Jamaat. The paper is based on secondary sources and the main objective of the paper is to provide deep insight into the ideological structure of the Tablighi Jamaat in a precise, compact and systematic manner.\n\nThe new Islamic presence in Europe, which is the consequence of massive and voluntary settlement of millions of Muslims in Western societies, owes its visibility partly to the Muslim missionary movements from South, which have proven specific strengths in shaping the Islamic-religious fields in the Diaspora communities in European countries. The new Islamic movements Tablighi Jama'at, Da'wat-e Islami and Sunni Da'wat-e Islami shre the characteristics of new religious movements in the sense that they have been transformed through the confrontation with globalization and modernity. They are believed to be comparable in size and scope to Christian Pentecostalism. These three movements share, in varying degrees, a Sufi background, and preach a peaceful Islam. At the same time terrorists involved in the bombings in Europe since 2004, regularly visited mosques associated with these movements, especially the Tablighi Jama'at. All three missionary movements invite their members to visit their world headquarters or participate in annual meetings in Pakistan or India. The \"Islamic project\" of the three movements is the \"Sunnaization\" - that is, the reshaping and reconstruction - of the daily routine and the individual markers of identity based on the examples of the Prophet and the Salaf as portrayed in the Hadith literature. This so-called \"apolitical\" Sunnaization can be understood as the privatization or individualization of political re-Islamization. Stressing individual transformation it focuses on the private sphere instead of the state, and engages with ahadith rather than the Qur'an. With a new tolerance of ambiguity, Sunnaization combines elements of Sufism and Salafism.\n\nThe Islamic Missionary Movements Tablīghī Jamāʿat, Daʿwat-e Islāmī, and Sunnī Daʿwat-e Islāmī share, in varying degrees, a Sufi background, and preach a peaceful Islam. At the same time terrorists involved in the bombings in Europe since 2004 regularly visited mosques associated with these movements, especially the Tablīghī Jamāʿat. The “Islamic project” of the three movements is the “Sunnaization” - that is, the reshaping and reconstruction - of the daily routine and the individual markers of identity based on the examples of the Prophet and the Salaf as portrayed in the Hadith literature. This so-called “apolitical” Sunnaization can be understood as the privatization or individualization of political re-Islamization.\n\nThis article addresses the novel phenomenon of the attachment of women from privileged backgrounds to the Tablighi Jamā'at movement in Indonesia. How to understand the involvement of these urban wealthy women who eventually give up their high-class lifestyles for the sake of their new understanding of Islam? The common stereotype of Tablighi Jamā'at women is that they are oppressed, cannot exercise agency, and do not contribute to the development of the movement. However, based on an ethnographic study of middle and upper-class Tablighi Jamā'at women, I found that their passion to return to the true path of Islam and the commitments it embodies have made them aware of their capacity to exercise agency within the movement's structuring conditions. The women's privileged social background has enabled them to embrace the meaning of being active in a religious group. The most notable contribution of these women is their effort in undertaking recruitment and sustaining this religious network of shared meaning with their colleagues. Within these activities they are social agents, not just tools of the movement's men.\n\nIslamic reform is often identified with the misleading term Wahhabism and as an anti-Western ideology opposed to all that West is depicted to stand for: Enlightenment, liberalism, freedom, tolerance and so on. Against this, I argue that reform, iṣlāḥ and tajdīd, should be seen in terms of Islam’s own Weltanschauung according to which ideas and practices of reform are integral to Islamic history and tradition from early on as they predate West’s rise. Rejecting the nearly standard dualism between local and universal/Arab/Islamic, I show how various Islamic reform movements and currents in Asia from 18th to 20th centuries inform and display initiatives of (re)making self, society and tradition under the global Western domination. This chapter begins by discussing the intellectual contributions of Shah Waliullah’s (1703–1762) reform initiatives and his impact on the subsequent thoughts and movements. It then discusses Tablighi Jamaat as a varied, complex instance of reform. I conclude with observations on the autonomy of Islam as a discursive tradition and how to re-conceptualize reform."
