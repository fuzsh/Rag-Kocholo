The militants first attacked five planters at Jogibeel and thereafter three others at Urahiloga. “We were coming from our tea garden when three armed NDFB (S) militants asked us to bow our heads. They then beat us black and blue with bamboo sticks,” one injured Rabha said. Rabha said he was certain they were militants as the same group of men had come to ask for money earlier. He said in the past they had refused to give in to the group’s extortion demands. Sonitpur Superintendent of Police (SP) Sanjukta Parasor told The Telegraph over phone that though threatened regularly, this is the first time that the villagers have told the police that the attackers were members of the Songbijit faction of the NDFB. Meanwhile, to strengthen law and order in Bodoland territoria Administered Districts (BTAD), the Assam Government has decided to set up 60 new Police Stations there, reports The Sentinel on August 3. This issue has already been taken up by Assam Government with the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA). The State Home Department sources said the deteriorating law and order situation in these Bodo–dominated Districts due to frequent ethnic violence and presence of several armed outfits have necessitated the setting up of additional Police stations and outposts in the BTAD. The proposal to set up 60 new Police Stations across the BTAD is now under consideration of the UMHA, sources added. On the other hand, 25 additional vehicles will be provided to the city Police so that it can give its response quickly against public calls.

The Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) Police have so far been unable to round up the masked men who held up the outfit's flags during the recent protests. \"We're unable to control the youth who are drifting towards the Deobandi school of thought, which is more or less aligned to the Wahhabis,\" said an unnamed senior separatist leader. \"This is a disturbing trend in the Kashmir valley, which is of predominately Barelvi thought. The trend may disturb the social fabric and trigger sectarian clashes in the future,\" he added. \"We fear this may put our lives at risk since the ISIS leader is targeting the Shias, besides Islamic shrines and monuments,\" said Mirza Hussian, a Shia, resident of the old city in Srinagar. \"We oppose the Israeli attacks on Gaza, but are shocked at the appearance of ISIS flags in Kashmir during the protest on Eid,\" said Maulana Tauqeer Raza, a leading Sunni-Barelvi scholar and Chief of Ittihad-e-Millat Tanzeem. \"The ISIS jihadis are terrorists and can't be called Sunnis.

The party is planning to hold a number of rallies on the outskirts of Dhaka to drum up public support in favor of their demand for a fresh election under a non-party administration, and to inspire the party leaders and activists to forge a tougher agitation in phases. The BNP high-ups believe that their movement last year before the January 5 election failed to put enough pressure on the Sheikh Hasina Wajed Government as it did not gain enough momentum in the capital. Meanwhile, the grassroots of the ruling Awami League (AL) are readying themselves to counter the post-Eid anti-Government movement threatened by the BNP, reports The Daily Star on August 2 (today).

Government sources said the issue was discussed in detail during the meeting of John Kerry and Ajit Doval last week. India wants the US to delay its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan which is scheduled to start from 2015 as it feel that elements like the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) and the al Qaeda still continue to remain strong and could pose a serious security threat not just to stability and peace in Afghanistan but the entire region, including India. India impressed upon the US that if it starts withdrawing its troops from 2015, it would provide an ideal opportunity to terror outfits to not only re-group but even neutralise whatever gains have been made by the US and its allied forces. The NSA, sources added, clearly told the US delegation that a weak Afghanistan could have a direct impact to an increase in terror activities in India. “We have given the Americans enough evidence to show how terror groups based in Pakistan were working in close co-ordination with those in Afghanistan. It was also underscored that the pullout could impact even Pakistan’s security scenario and that a weak Pakistan was not a good sign for the region,” a senior government functionary said.
