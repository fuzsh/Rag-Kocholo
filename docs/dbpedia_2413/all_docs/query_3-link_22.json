        "text": "Legendary Pakistan batsman and former skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq remained the flagbearer of elegant batsmanship throughout his iconic career for the Green Army. Regarded as one of the greatest batsmen the Pakistan team has ever produced, batting maestro Inzamam bailed out the 1992 World Champions on numerous occasions with his match-changing knocks across formats.\n\nEven though Inzamam rescued Pakistan and snatched victories from the jaws of defeat on several junctures, the former skipper was never considered as one of the safest batsmen in terms of running between the wickets. Besides his marauding knocks and outstanding achievements in the gentlemen's game, Inzamam is also remembered for getting involved in hilarious mixups and comical run-outs. Having said that, here's a quick look at some of the funniest mix-ups involving the ex-Pakistan skipper.\n\nWhich batsman was involved in most run-outs?\n\nInterestingly, former Pakistan skipper Inzamam doesn't hold the dubious record of getting involved in run-outs the most number of times on the international circuit. In fact, former Australia skipper Steve Waugh has been involved in run-outs, the most number of times. The 1999 World Cup-winning captain for Australia was involved in run-outs a record 104 times - 27 in Tests and 77 in One Day Internationals (ODIs).\n\nFormer Indian skipper Rahul Dravid was involved in 101 run-out cases on the international circuit. Dravid was run-out 53 times in his international career. Former Pakistan skipper Inzamam was involved in a total of 92 run-out instances. Inzamam, who captained Pakistan between 2001 to 2007, played 120 Test matches and 378 ODIs for the Asian giants.\n\nThe former Pakistan skipper scored 8,830 runs and slammed 25 centuries for Pakistan in the oldest format of the gentlemen's game. In ODIs, the former skipper of the Green Army scored 11,739 runs and notched up 10 centuries.\n\nInzamam made his debut for Pakistan against the West Indies at Gaddafi Stadium in 1991. The 1992 World Cup winner played his final international game for Pakistan against South Africa at the same venue in 2007. Inzamam is still Pakistan's leading run-scorer in the 50-over format."
