        "text": "I am deeply sorry for forgetting to pay this tribute to the majestic Inzamam Ul Haq on his 50th birthday on 3rd March.So sad there were no memorial posts to this great icon of the games whose memories will be cherished forever.Apologize for delay and like feedback.\n\nStatistically Inzamam was the best match-winning batsmen of his day.17 of his 25 tests centuries were in winning causes and he averaged over 78 in wins.He negotiated express pace with more effortlessness than Lara or Tendulkar ,displaying greater mastery in dominating the short,rising balls.Arguably in pure talent he matched strides with the very best.In his own right Inzamam shaped Pakistan cricket in the manner Ponting,Lara or Sachin did for their respective nations.On his day Inzy could take domination of bowling to regions of the sublime,carrying bat like a lumberjack. In hitting the final nails in the coffin Inzy or taking a team over the line Inzy could be more effective than anyone of his time.\n\nIt was virtually Inzamam Ul Haq's miraculous intervention in the 1992 semi-final versus New Zeland that from the depths of despair ressurected Pakistan to the pinnacle of glory with one of the most exhilarating displays of batting ever witnessed.He simply turned the complexion of game reminiscent of a thunderstorm emerging in no mansland. It was this very character that Inzamam displayed throughout his carer surpassing any contemporary batsmen as a match-winners statistically,averaging 78+ in tests won ,with 17 of his 24 centuries ending up in wins.Morally Inzy averaged just above 50 ,including a triple century.For a sustained period of 6 years he averaged above 60 which was remarkable.Arguably no batsmen of his time was so adept against genuine pace or played it with such consummate ease.On his day Inzy was flamboyance personified and could be the ultimate man to ressurect a side from the grave.He lacked the technical correctness of Hanif Mohamad or the elegance of Zaheer Abbas or the determination of Javed Minadad but for pure prowess he may have even joined the Tendulkar's and Lara's.Inzy's batting had a characteristic languid style.His strokeplay blended the power of a motorboat to punish bowling with the craftsmanship of a weaver to dissect fields.He combined his razor sharp reflexes and footwork.He carried his bat like a lumberjack.Imran Khan ranked Inzy as the most talented batsmen of his time and best batsmen against pace.Inzy had the ability to take creativity in bating to metaphysical proportions.Above all he was a most un-selfish batsmen always putting the team's interest above his like when retiring before surpassing Javed Miandad's record aggregate of 8832 runs.\n\nIn Test cricket my most memorable moments of Inzamam werre his unbeaten 58 in 1994 at Karachi when he ressurected Pakistan from the grave to pull of a miracle in heroic last wicket stand ,his unbeaten 138 against Bangladesh in 2004 which again performed a Houdini act ,his century versus England in the 1st test on the home series in 2006 which won a test from a capricious position and his match-winning centuries at Bangalore in 2005 enabling Pakistan to square the series.Inzy was more prolific in or against West Indies than ven Tendulkar ,facing the likes of Ambrose and Walsh and averaging over 57 with 3 centuries.\n\nIt is hard to envisage any Pakistan batsmen ever or any batsmen of his era who displayed so much coolness in a crisis to turn games and instill so much confidence to team mates.Inzamam 's innings have secured important wins for Pakistan in West Indies ,England ,India and New Zealand in tests.Javed was more consistent in a crisis but could not equal Inzamam's ability to turn the complexion of games.Like Javed Miandad Inzamam was master in run chases in ODI's planning his innings with the precision of an architect and taking his side across the line with the flourish of a boxer.I would not be surprised that team mates or tail enders could be more inspired batting with Inzy than Sachin ,Lara or Ponting.He also proved his penchant for mammoth scores when scoring 329 versus Bangladesh.His batting posessed a subtle element of wristwork to complement his power.I would have loved to witness Inzamam face Lillee and Thomson at their fastest and the great West Indies pace quartet.Somehow I would have backed Inzy to tackle them even better than Sachin or Lara who were not at their best against the bouncing delivery.Inzamam's batting could generate or boost a morale in his team mates more than any batsmen of his time.Viewers should read the sensation Inzy gave to Alan Donald when bowling to him.\n\nHowever he was not a fast runner between wickets which could often contribute to his down fall.He was also not at his best against Australia and South Africa ,the premier teams of his day,both at home and away.He amassed more of his run son home turf and overseas he was at his best in New Zealand and West Indies where he averaged around 60.He was also consistent in England averaging close to 50.Arguably no batsmen played Ambrose or Walsh with such remorseless ease which he proved with his big scores against West Indies,who even if a depleted side has great pacemen.At his best he was a revelation in South Africa when scoring 99 in 1994 playing Alan Donald like a spinner.Inzy often was troubled by the moving ball because of his cross bat technique and often be a leg before victim.\n\nWhat goes against Inzamam was his inabilty to take Pakistan to the status of champion team in his era unlike Javed Miandad,Zaheer Abbas and Majid Khan.He was almost as good as Miandad away ,but Javed fared better bowling.Consistently he did not display the application of a Rahul Dravid,Tendulkar,Lara or Ponting and could often look aloof.What is surprising inspite of having such reserves of talent and fighting qualities to defy all odds Inzmamam did not join the pedestal of a Viv,Sachin or Lara.I attribute it to lack of application or being too casual in approach.Overall I feel he was a touch below Younis Khan,who was consistency personified.\n\nI would bracket Inzamam with batsmen like David Gower,V.V.S.Laxman,Gundappa Vishwanath ,Mark Waugh or Kevin Pieterson who all had outstanding natural talent but fell out because of lack of sheer application.In his era VVS Laxman and Kevin Pieterson were closest to Inzamam.I would select Inzamam amongst my 100 best cricketers and 50 best batsmen of all time .Inzamam is in major contention for the title of the best Pakistani batsmen of all time but overall overshadowed just by a whisker by Javed Miandad or arguably Hanif Mohammad.His rank may be debated but in my book I would always award Inzamam the stature of a truly great batsmen and not just a very good one."
