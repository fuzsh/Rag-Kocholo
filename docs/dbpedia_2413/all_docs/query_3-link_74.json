        "text": "Ex-Pakistani cricketer and former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has recently accused Indian bowler Arshdeep Singh of consistently tampering with the ball in the ongoing 2024 T20 World Cup.\n\nAs per Inzamam, Indian pacers manipulated the ball to ensure, that ball reverse swings.\n\nAccording to him, this has been extremely beneficial for Team India. During a show in Pakistan news channel 24 News HD, both Inzamam and former Pakistan skipper, Saleem Malik, recently talked about Arshdeep’s reverse swinging deliveries in India’s super 8 clash against Australia.\n\nBoth of them claimed, it was early for the Indian pacer to reverse swing the ball. Speaking at 24 News HD, he said,\n\n‘Arshdeep Singh, when he was bowling the 15th over, the ball was reversing. is it too early (for reverse swing) with the new ball? This means the ball was ready for reverse swing by the 12th or the 13th over. Umpires should keep their eyes open (to spot) these things…If it was Pakistani bowlers (reverse swinging the ball) this would have been a big issue. We know reverse swing very well and if Arshdeep can come in the 15th over and start reversing the ball, it means some serious work had been done before.’\n\nLater while backing Inzamam’s statement, malik alleged partiality, saying that for teams like India, eyes are shut.\n\n‘Inzy, I always say this, eyes are kept shut when it comes to some teams, and India is one of those teams. I remember in Zimbabwe, when Wasim (Akram) was bowling, he made it wet, and we all were surprised at it; as in how come one side was wet, and when I went and complained I was fined quite heavily.’\n\nWatch The Video\n\nEarlier too, many Pakistani cricketers have made various claims against Indian Pacers. One of the notable allegations was made by Hasan Raza, who claimed that India used chips in the ball during 2023 ODI world cup. Thus, raising questions on Mohammad Shami’s exceptional bowling."
