        "text": "It‚Äôs time to bid goodbye to ALS Ice Bucket Challenge which went viral on social media during July ‚Äì August 2014. But now we have another challenge making rounds on the social media: ‚ÄòThe Book Bucket Challenge‚Äô or ‚Äô10 Books Challenge‚Äô. I have been nominated by quite a number of people over social media for this challenge.\n\nFirst question that often creeps in the mind is why this would be a challenge? Answer is for book lovers this is a daunting task. To select a list of 10 books you loved and had an effect on you from a humongous personal collection of books or library is surely a difficult task.\n\nAfter being nominated, the first question that crossed my mind was what‚Äôs the background of this challenge. While searching I came across this article on web which might be useful in case you want to know what this challenge is all about: ‚ÄúWhat The Book Bucket Challenge Is All About?‚Äù\n\nWithout further ado, here you go, folks. My list of 10 books in no particular order is:\n\n1. ‚ÄúThe 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History‚Äù by Michael H. Hart.\n\nThis book is really worth reading. It is perhaps one of the greatest books on the analysis of history ever written. Hart‚Äôs selection may surprise some and questioned by others. Nevertheless its an excellent and enlightening book on the works and life of various personalities who changed the course of history of the world.\n\n2. ‚ÄúWounded Tiger: The History of Cricket in Pakistan‚Äù by Peter Oborne.\n\nFor cricket enthusiast and lovers like me who grew up watching sports in 1990s and 2000s derive inspiration from likes of Imran Khan, Javed Miandad, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Inzamam ul Haq, Muhammad Yousaf, Shoaib Akhtar, Shahid Afridi, Misbah ul Haq and Saeed Ajmal. We are not much aware of the cricket history and heroes before 90s. That is why the first half of the this book which analyses Pakistan cricket from partition to 1980s was the best part for me. I wrote are review of this book as well which you can read here: Book Review: ‚ÄúWounded Tiger: A History of Cricket in Pakistan‚Äù by Peter Oborne.\n\n3. ‚ÄúUdas Naslain‚Äù by Abdullah Hussain\n\nIts a classic. One of best Urdu novels and a very fine book on the events of Indo-Pak partition. The book takes us deep into the issues of partition related to masses who suddenly had to leave their homes of decades to unknown lands, without religious connotations. A beautiful piece of writing. It is simply unputdownable. An English translation of this book is also available now. Check it out here.\n\n4. ‚ÄúLost History: The Enduring Legacy of Muslim Scientists, Thinkers, and Artists‚Äù by Michael Hamilton Morgan\n\nThis book was brilliant and enlightening read for me. This book is a must read for both Muslims and non-Muslims. A fascinating read of the lost history of Muslim scientists, thinkers and artists had and influenced on the world. It clarifies a lot of misunderstandings. This book also helped me in writing an article, a more of thesis, on Muslim identity crises. You can read the article here: Muslim Identity Crises: From Golden Ages to Militancy.\n\n5. ‚ÄúJinnah: India-Partition-Independence‚Äù by Jaswant Singh\n\nMr Jinnah, founder of Pakistan, known as ‚ÄòQuaid-e-Azam‚Äô (The Great Leader‚Äô) has been one of major inspirations in my life. It is one of the best books on partition and life of Mr Jinnah. Reading it from the perspective of a leader of BJP, an Indian political party, was really intriguing.\n\n6. ‚ÄúRaja Gidh‚Äù by Bano Qudsiyah\n\n‚ÄòGidh‚Äô is the Urdu word for a vulture and ‚ÄòRaja‚Äô is a Hindi synonym for king. This book is a work of art of immeasurable proportions. One of the best Urdu novels this book has quite a touch of philosophy as well. I learned a lot from this book.\n\n7. ‚ÄúSectarian War: Pakistan‚Äôs Sunni-Shia Violence and Its Links to the Middle East‚Äù by Khaled Ahmad\n\nThe narrative in this book is gripping and bold. I love reading history and this books was really enlightening for me. Any one who wants to understand the Sunni-Shia violence not only in Pakistan but world as well, this is your guide to it.\n\n8. ‚ÄúHow to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia‚Äù by Mohsin Hamid\n\nIt an excellent novel. It is a vital and affecting portrait of a teeming and globally significant, but largely unrecorded culture. The book shows the power of imagination and creativity of Mohsin Hamid, one of my favourite novelists. As you ll read it it ll sound pretty much real.\n\n9. ‚ÄúThe Prisoner‚Äù by Omar Shahid Hamid\n\nAll cities have secret lives but with so many hopes packed into such a cramped place, Karachi is in a league of its own. Omar has penned a brilliant novel. It portrays so much reality. The plot is full of so many twists and turns, suspense and thrill ‚Äì it is unputdownable.\n\n10. ‚ÄúEleven Minutes‚Äù by Paulo Coelho\n\nPaulo Coelho is my favourite novelist. I have read his so many novels. The content of this book might be explicit but its a very interesting read. You will have to reach the book with open mind to understand it.\n\nSo now I would like to extend the challenge to all of you. Please share your list in the comments box or in your blog by ping back. üòÄ\n\nThe eternal drama of Pakistan cricket never ceases to fascinate the fans of Cricket game. Why would it? There are only few teams in world cricket, rather world sports, as unpredictable and mercurial as Pakistan. They will be a laughing stock one day with their amateurish performance and next day exhibit elated panache with ability to beat best in the world. If not for Pakistani cricket team, cricket would have been the most boring sport of the world.\n\nPakistan as a country has been through a number of ups and downs since traumatic partition in 1947 and its cricket has followed the similar pattern in direct proportion, perfectly summing up what this sport means to this country. Initially dispersed, unrecognised, underfunded and weak, Pakistan‚Äôs cricket team grew to become a major force in world cricket, explains Peter Oborne in his book ‚ÄúWounded Tiger: A History of Cricket in Pakistan‚Äù. Packed with memories from former players and top administrators, and digging deep into political, social and cultural history, this book is major study of sport and nationhood of Pakistan.\n\nFor cricket enthusiast and lovers like me who grew up watching sports in 1990s and 2000s derive inspiration from likes of Imran Khan, Javed Miandad, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Inzamam ul Haq, Muhammad Yousaf, Shoaib Akhtar, Shahid Afridi, Misbah ul Haq and Saeed Ajmal. We are not much aware of the cricket history and heroes before 90s. That is why the first half of the book which analyses Pakistan cricket from partition to 1980s was the best part for me. The book provided, in a smooth free flowing manner, a brilliant narrative of drama, politics, jokes and personalities of that era.\n\nThe book starts with a focus on the trauma of partition of 1947 and a particular focus on the lives of the two early heroes of Pakistani cricket: Abdul Hafeez Kardar and Fazal Mahmood. Kardar and Justice Cornelius were in some senses the creators of Pakistan‚Äôs cricket. Cornelius was a brilliant man who was vice-president of Board of Control of Cricket in Pakistan (BCCP) and later become Chief Justice of Pakistan. They formed a formidable partnership to help Pakistan achieving an uphill task of Test-playing nation. Kardar could often be seen cruel and intolerant but he was ultimately driven by passionate belief in the honour of Pakistan. Fazal Mahmood was the early instigator of a fast bowling tradition that has been backbone of great Pakistani cricketing sides over the years. It was emotional to read that Fazal on the way back to Pakistan from the camp in India after partition in 1947 would have been lynched by Hindu fanatics on a train were it not for the legendary Indian cricketer C K Nayudu, who defended Mahmood with his cricket bat.\n\nThe cricketing story of a decade and a half after the partition as narrated in the book is simply exhilarating. The exuberance of the cricket of this period seemed intertwined with the task of nation-building. The first Pakistani tour of India, victory at oval in 1954, India‚Äôs tour of Pakistan, the touring English MCC team‚Äôs kidnapping of a Pakistani umpire, exciting encounters with teams of West Indies and Australia, supremacy of Mohammads of Karachi and Burkis of Lahore, batting heroics of Muhammad Hanif and deadly bowling due of Fazal and Khan Muhammad ‚Äì all of these have been told with a great mixture of drama, wit and charm.\n\nThe book wandered in middle during the epochs of 60s and early 70s just like middle overs of a One Day match innings ‚Äì slow in tempo but engaging. 1960s was a difficult period for cricket in Pakistan, which Oborne terms as ‚Äòa lost decade‚Äô. In the 1960s, Pakistan won just two tests out of 30 played, both against New Zealand. Eight were lost, while 20 were drawn. Pakistan cricket was overcome by a morbid defensiveness. Avoiding defeat became the height of national ambition.\n\nAs the cricket entered its golden era in 1970s, the shape of Pakistani cricket started to change on positive note as well. The revolt of players against AH Kardar, administrator at that time, marked the transition. In 1976 the national side, hardened to defeat for so long time was suddenly stronger, angrier and more motivated capable of beating any side in the world. The team was fantastically led by attacking captain, Mushtaq Muhammad. Team had perfect balance of age and youth: Majid Khan, Asif Iqbal, Wasim Bari, Zaheer Abbas, Sarfraz Nawaz joined by new generation, of whom Imran Khan and Javed Miandad were soon to turn into giants.\n\nThe book also touches the strong sense of Pakistan how it has been unfairly treated across the global community and press, particularly England. Javed Miandad‚Äôs batting achievements were undermined by an abrasive reputation. Imran Khan was portrayed as a ‚Äúnot especially gifted cricketer‚Äù in contrast to someone who was ‚Äúalways learning, always seeking to improve himself and always seeking out responsibility‚Äù.\n\nImran Khan and Javed Miandad formed a formidable partnership which took Pakistani cricket to great heights in 80s and 90s. Imran took charge of Pakistani team at vital moment of its cricketing history and Pakistani cricket came of age during that period. Pakistan cricketers were no longer patronised by the dominant white cricketing nations. Instead, they came to be feared and resented.\n\nTwo discoveries stand out during that period, Oborne explains. First one was the reverse swing. It was pioneered by Sarfraz Nawaz, passed on by Imran Khan to two Ws, Wasim and Waqar, who mastered it perfectly. Reverse swing became a primary cause of estrangement between Pakistan and white cricket nations in 1990s. Second was more of a rediscovery. It was emergence of wrist bowling in form of magician Abdul Qadir who was discovered by Imran.\n\nPakistan was in disarray going into 1992 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand. After a dismal start the cornered tigers were lifted by great leadership of Imran and Miandad‚Äôs consistency under pressure, who took Pakistan all the way to the final to lift the greatest prize of World Cricket.\n\nPakistan cricket grew to altogether new levels in 1990s and 2000s marked by great victories and fight backs. Cricket which used by a game of urban upper-middle class people became a game of lower-middle class persons. Cricket grew geographically which was supported by financial revolution. However, this period was also marred by curse of match fixing, the Justice Qayyum report and spot fixing allegations in 2010 which resulted in ban of trio Salman Butt, Muhammad Asif and Muhammad Amir. It also faced an age of isolation post 9/11 attacks when various teams refused to visit Pakistan on a number of occasions.\n\nPakistan had a bright moment in 2009 when it won T20 World Cup under captaincy of Yonis Khan. However there was horrible moment too in same year. In 2009, as the Sri Lankan cricket team were on their way to a Test in Lahore, their team bus was attacked by militant gunmen. Since then Pakistan has played its home cricket in the UAE. Oborne remarks that against such a background, it seems miraculous that the game exists at all, let alone is considered by Pakistanis as their pride and joy.\n\nMisbah-ul-Haq took over captaincy of a dejected Pakistani team. The task he faced was far more difficult than any previous captain, including AH Kardar. He had to lead a cricket team in exile, deal with constant charges of corruption and match-fixing, and confront a chaotic administration. Oborne has rightly put in his book that it speaks volumes for the character of Misbah who took the challenge and led team by example, self-belief and courage.\n\n‚ÄòWounded Tiger‚Äô, Winner of the 2004 William Hill Sports Book of the Year, is not just about presenting a fascinating picture of story and characters of Pakistan cricket. It recognises the ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù of Pakistan with its ever-present follies. From the uncertainty over the ages of the record-breaking ‚Äúteenaged debutants‚Äù to ‚Äúmaster inventors‚Äù and the most shrewd of tacticians to the ability of pulling out surprises that is unique to Pakistan alone.\n\nThe following excerpt from the book perfectly sums up the nature of Pakistan and its cricket:\n\n‚ÄúEverywhere I went in Pakistan, I was aware that people feel a huge sense of pride in their country. This pride expresses itself through the cricket team, whose white clothing against a green field nearly matches the colours of the national flag. Cricket is the game of the villages; it is the game of the towns. It is the game of the old; it is the game of the young, the rich and the poor. It is played in the plains of the Sindh and in the mountains of the north. It is played by the army and the Taliban. It is enjoyed by all Pakistan‚Äôs sects and religions. It is part of Pakistan‚Äôs history and also its future. It is magical and marvellous. Nothing else expresses half so well the singularity, the genius, the occasional madness of the people of Pakistan, and their contribution to the world sporting community.‚Äù\n\nMy rating of the book 8/10.\n\nThis blog was published on Pak Tea House."
