        "text": "MCC has today announced the election of Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mark Boucher as Honorary Life Members. The Club has bestowed this honour in recognition of their outstanding achievements in cricket.\n\nInzamam played 119 Test Matches for Pakistan, captaining them from 2001-07 and scoring 8,829 runs at an average of 50.16, including 25 centuries. He made his international debut in 1991, featuring strongly in Pakistan’s successful 1992 World Cup campaign and going on to play in 378 ODIs. His 11,739 ODI runs, made at an average of 39.5, puts him sixth in the all-time list.\n\nSince his retirement in 2007, Inzamam had a spell as Head Coach of Afghanistan, before becoming Pakistan’s Chief Selector in 2016. In becoming an Honorary Life Member of MCC, he joins a number of fellow Pakistani greats, including Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Shahid Afridi.\n\nWicket-keeper/batsman Boucher, who was the first gloveman to take 500 catches in Test cricket, was a mainstay of South Africa’s line-up for more than a decade. Making his debut in 1997, he went on to play 146 Test Matches for his country, scoring 5,498 runs, taking 530 catches and 23 stumpings.\n\nHe also played 290 ODIs for the Proteas, making 4,523 runs, claiming 395 catches and taking 21 stumpings. He holds the combined-format international record for wicket-keeping dismissals: 998 in total.\n\nBoucher, who is now coach of the Titans in South African, joins countrymen Allan Donald, Jonty Rhodes, Shaun Pollock and Daryll Cullinan as an Honorary Life Member of MCC."
