        "text": "Pakistan... 'Land of the Pure'\n\nWhen you think of Pakistan, the first thing that comes to mind is the recent unfortunate natural disasters which killed many people. But, this beautiful country, rich in culture and breathtaking landscapes has much to offer. Today we will have a closer look at this amazing country.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a country located in South Asia that overlaps onto the Greater Middle East and Central Asia. Pakistan borders India, Afghanistan, Iran (Persia), China and the Arabian Sea.\n\nWith around 163 million inhabitants, it is the sixth most populous country with the second largest Muslim population. It is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and SAARC.It was formerly a major part of the British Empire as western British India before gaining independence in 1947 through the Partition of India. The name of the country \"Pakistan\" in Urdu means Land of the Pure.\n\nPakistan has the world's sixth largest population, more than Russia, but less than Brazil. Because of Pakistan's high growth rate, it is expected to overtake Brazil in population before 2025. Based on the high fertility rates of the 1980s, demographers had projected that Pakistan would be the third most populous nation by 2050.\n\nPakistan has a rich and unique cultural heritage, and has actively preserved its established traditions throughout history. Many cultural practices and monuments have been inherited from the rule of Mughal emperors.\n\nBecause of Pakistan's geography, it inherits a rich and unique culture, and has actively preserved its established traditions throughout history. The Pakistani national dress, Shalwar Kameez is one of the clothing styles inherited from these rich cultural roots.\n\nPakistani society is largely multilingual and multicultural. Religious practices of various faiths are part of everyday life in society. Education is highly regarded by members of every socio-economic class. Traditional family values are highly respected and considered sacred.\n\nThe Northwestern part of Pakistan, bordering Afghanistan, is highly conservative and dominated by centuries-old regional tribal customs.\n\nThe majority of the people of Pakistan are Muslim. Most (75 per cent) are Sunni, some (20 per cent) are Shia, and the rest belong to a number of smaller sects. Pakistan has a small non-Muslim population, mostly consisting of Christians (2.5 per cent), while the remaining 1.2 per cent includes Hindus, Buddhists, Zoroastrians, Sikhs, Jews, and Animists (mainly the Kalash in Chitral).\n\nPakistan is also the birthplace of three major world religions, Sikhism, Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism. Although today there are few Sikhs in Pakistan, Pakistani Punjab was the birthplace of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism as well as the Sikh conqueror Ranjit Singh. In addition, Pakistan is also the birthplace of Mahayana Buddhism, the form of Buddhism practised by most Buddhists today, including those in China, India, Japan, Vietnam, and Korea.\n\nIt is also the birthplace of Vajrayana (Tantric) Buddhism. The early formation of the Hindu religion may have taken place here, either amongst the Indus Valley Civilization or along with the Indo-Aryan migration into the area and with the composition of the earliest of the sacred scriptures, the Rig Veda.\n\nBut most academics believe Hinduism formed along the Ganges River further east instead. Urdu and English are both recognised as the official languages of Pakistan. Punjabis comprise the largest ethnic group in the country. Pakistan has four provinces, two territories, and also administers parts of Kashmir. The provinces are further subdivided into a total of 105 districts.\n\nThe most popular sport in Pakistan is cricket. Pakistan has produced several of the best batsmen and bowlers in the world, including Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Javed Miandad, Inzamam-ul-Haq, and Shoaib Akhtar. Almost every district and neighbourhood in Pakistan has its cricket team and most people start playing from a young age.
