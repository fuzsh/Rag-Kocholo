        "text": "Dr Yusuf Khwaja Hamied’s stance against monopoly and profiteering have made him infamous among pharmaceutical companies worldwide, as he works hard to make medicine affordable in developing countries\n\nIt was during World War II that leading pharmaceutical company Cipla helped win India’s independence – but that would not be the company’s crowning achievement. Cipla would go on to define India as the ‘pharma capital of the world’ and save millions of lives, helping to establish access to medicine as a fundamental human right. It is not an overstatement when company chairman Dr Yusuf Khwaja Hamied says: “For more than 75 years, we have made medicines and history.”\n\nIn 1935, India, under British control, was completely dependent upon imported medicines that were frequently unavailable and rarely affordable. It was then that the current Cipla chairman’s father, Dr Khwaja Abdul Hamied, set up what was initially called Chemical, Industrial and Pharmaceutical Laboratories – today’s Cipla. His vision: to make India self-sufficient.\n\nHamied got his chance to do just that four years later when Mahatma Gandhi approached him with a request to supply the British with medicines during World War II, with Britain promising to grant India independence in exchange for its co-operation. The chairman agreed, bartering trauma, malaria and other medication for the country’s independence, which was delivered in 1947.\n\nBut Cipla still faced considerable setbacks. Due to archaic patent laws left over from colonial rule, India was unable to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), otherwise known as ‘bulk drugs’, and formulations that were desperately needed. When the founder’s son and present chairman, Dr Yusuf Khwaja Hamied, returned from his PhD studies in Cambridge, England, in 1960, it became clear to him that something had to change. Frustrated at these restrictions, he helped form the Indian Drug Manufacturers Association (IDMA) to rally for change.\n\n“Even after independence, and right up till the 1970s, the multinationals ruled the pharma industry with their high-priced drugs, and nobody was bothered,” says Hamied. “Then in the 1960s we took up the fight and we were successful.” The breakthrough came in 1972 with the passing of the new Indian Patents Act, which allowed for any molecules to be synthesised by Indian companies so long as the method of manufacture was different from that of the originator. The Indian pharmaceutical industry boomed. Cipla paved the way in importing new drugs previously unavailable in the country and selling them at affordable prices. Over the following decades, Cipla’s factories sprung up throughout India – today numbering more than 40 – and its Vikhroli factory became the first in the country to gain US FDA approval for the manufacture of ‘bulk drugs’.\n\nAnother breakthrough came in the 1980s when the HIV/AIDS virus swept the world and millions of people were unable to afford the medication, which cost between US$10,000 and $15,000 per person per year. Cipla broke new ground when it offered Triomune, the world’s first antiretroviral triple drug cocktail tablet, at the cost of less than a dollar a day, making medication available to millions and forcing other pharmaceutical companies to drop their prices in one fell swoop. “We are being humanitarian, but we are not doing charity,” explains Hamied. “We are not making money, but we are not going to lose money either.”\n\nWhat he is averse to is exploitation and monopoly.\n\n“For a certain US FDA drug, the price in America is $24,000 per person per year. My drug is also US FDA approved and I am selling it to Africa at $96 per person per year. Where is $96 and where is $24,000? At $96 I can still afford a good existence. So the question arises: where, and how, does one set the costing and how does one set the pricing?” he muses. “If something costs 100 rupees, you can’t sell it for 100,000.”\n\nThis thinking extended to cancer medication in 2012, when Cipla slashed the cost of six drugs by 76 per cent. Further to this, Hamied campaigned for the Indian government to allow the use of compulsory licensing, a facility that can allow companies to manufacture existing life-saving drugs for sale in countries where the originator’s prices are extortionate. “First, I want what is best for my country and second, what is best for the developing countries,” says Hamied. “We have to decide our own destiny.”\n\nA metaphorical spanner was thrown in the works in March 2005 with the passing of a new patent law that could choke off the supply of medication to the poor. The act came as a condition for India to join the World Trade Organization and means the introduction of licensing fees for generic drugs already sold in India and a hike in prices for replicating new drugs. This is expected to hit AIDS patients particularly hard as the virus is quick to develop a resistance to old drugs. “When the Indian government changed the patent law in 2005, it started the ball rolling,” says Hamied. “The impact of monopoly will really hit India after 2015. In my personal opinion, it has permitted genocide in health care.”\n\nThe new legislation has been praised by others in the industry, as stronger patent protection will facilitate multinational investment in the country and protect original research. But the head of Cipla heralds the update as a step backwards. “If you are in a health care business like Cipla then it is not only business,” he says. “You are into changing lives. There has to be an emotional humanitarian approach. If you are in health care, you have an obligation.”\n\nHamied’s altruistic attitude towards marketing and his stance against monopoly and profiteering have made him infamous among pharmaceutical companies worldwide as the ‘Robin Hood of pharma’. His unpopularity has seen Hamied face charges of violation of intellectual property rights alongside general widespread criticism. “Of the world’s top-selling drugs, the majority of them are marketed by companies who did not invent them,” Hamied explains. “I am not against multinationals, I am against monopoly.”\n\nCipla has won multiple awards for ‘best company’, ‘most trusted pharmaceutical brand’ and ‘innovation’ worldwide, and currently offers one of the best centres for palliative care in India, as well as world-renowned research hubs into respiratory diseases.\n\nWhy terrorists outdo state armies in the efficient pursuit of their ruthless goals\n\nOut of the Mountains: The Coming Age of the Urban Guerrilla\n\nDavid Kilcullen, Hurst, London, 2013, 288pp, ISBN 978-1849043243\n\nIn September 2013, Somalia’s al-Shabaab militant group carried out a successful attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi. It was an impeccable piece of modern, urban terrorism: transnational, protracted, highly visible, complex and extremely bloody. The mall was locked down for three days and 72 people were killed by only four perpetrators, all of whom are thought to have escaped.\n\nWhat was novel was not so much the attack itself – after all, it was firearm-based terrorism in Sarajevo that precipitated World War I – but the environment, and this is the focus of David Kilcullen’s excellent Out of the Mountains: The Coming Age of the Urban Guerrilla.\n\nKilcullen is a former Australian military officer, best known for his writings on counter-insurgency. Out of the Mountains is a wide-ranging, thought-provoking book that draws on and synthesises concepts and arguments from geography, ecology, political science, sociology and military strategy. Unsurprisingly for a book of this scope, not all of Kilcullen’s big ideas quite work. But what emerges is a framework that can help us understand how global development and human conflict will co-evolve in the coming decades.\n\nThe core of Kilcullen’s arguments is that the world is seeing four ‘megatrends’: population growth, urbanisation, littoralisation (a tendency for things to cluster on coastlines) and networked connectivity. Virtually all the world’s population growth will occur in coastal cities in low-income, unstable countries that are nevertheless highly embedded in global networks. The world’s cities will absorb more people than were born in recorded history until 1960, and all but two of the world’s ten largest cities are on a coastline or coastal delta.\n\nPast conflicts were dominated by remote, rural areas: “mountains, forests, jungles, villages and farms”. Think of the past 12 years of war in Afghanistan. Future conflict, on the whole, will be in crowded, urban areas. The Mumbai terrorist attacks of November 2008, which Kilcullen explores at length, fit into this framework – the attackers, from Lashkare Taiba, represented a non-state group (albeit one backed by Islamabad). They came by sea, exploited the poor maritime controls of the sprawling coastal city and took advantage of technology (including Twitter and satellite television reports) to receive real-time instructions from Pakistan based handlers.\n\nAs Kilcullen observes: “Mumbai represents the state of the art in urban littoral terrorism.” He inventively compares their meticulously prepared attack to the hastily planned and botched US raid on Mogadishu in 1994, arguing that whereas Lashkar-e-Taiba understood and used Mumbai’s natural “rhythms”, the US special forces – admittedly for a very different purpose – worked against those of Mogadishu and were therefore frustrated.\n\nConnectivity is crucial here. It is what enabled the Mumbai attackers to fine-tune their assault with such deadly success, disparate Arab activists to co-ordinate their protests in 2011 (Kilcullen has an excellent chapter on Tunisia and Egypt) and US pilots sitting in Virginia to control drones flying missions over Pakistan’s tribal areas. Traditional battle lines melt away, legal frameworks are ambiguous (are US-based drone operators fair targets in a war?) and power diffuses beyond governments. Perhaps the best example is NATO’s 2011 war in Libya, where the alliance was helped by internet activists, like Anonymous and Twitter users, to co-ordinate aid and even target missiles – creating what Kilcullen calls the “informational hinterland”.\n\nWho are the people operating in these future cities? Kilcullen tries to develop a theory – “competitive control” – that can accommodate developed states, Somali terrorists, American gangs, Caribbean drug cartels, Afghan insurgents and everyone in between. Anyone who can provide stable, predictable rules for dispute resolution can tie the local population into their system of control. Think of the Taliban, whose rise to power in mid 1990s Afghanistan was underpinned by their ability to provide harsh, brutal but dependable law enforcement where the warlords generated only chaos. Kilcullen draws from this the lesson that traditional principles of counter-insurgency – such as “winning hearts and minds” – are far less important than enforcing rules.\n\nIf these theories seem broad, and perhaps confusing, that is because they are. Any book that tries to squeeze Jamaican drug traffickers and Tunisian football hooligans into the same framework is going to run into trouble. But this eclecticism and ambition is also the great strength of Out of the Mountains. It will spawn ideas, and pull our attention to the emerging megacities of the world and their assorted urban guerrillas.\n\nShashank Joshi, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute\n\nWhatever happened to plain English?\n\nWho Touched Base in my Thought Shower? A Treasury of Unbearable Office Jargon\n\nSteven Poole, Sceptre, London, 2013, 212pp ISBN 978-1444781847\n\nThe ability, or rather desire, to speak clearly seems to have decreased substantially in recent years. Office jargon emerged across the UK and the USA in the late 20th century, but it has grown more meaningless and, frankly, perverse as time has progressed.\n\nAuthor, journalist and cultural critic Steven Poole attempts to chase the roots of some of the more common and obscure examples of modern-day office jargon in Who Touched Base in my Thought Shower? Poole gives examples of offi ce jargon ranging from “across the piece” to “zerotasking”, giving hilarious literal deconstructions before exploring the origin and development of each phrase.\n\nThe book appeals for individuals to say simply what they mean, rather than subjecting workers to the horrors of jargon, which he refers to as one of the most “spirit sapping indignities of modern life”. There is nothing more frustrating than obscuring meaning through the use of meaningless terminology, which presents itself as “a kind of cheap competence that often marks a lack of competence in anything that matters”.\n\nPoole writes of how he became extremely popular upon first writing about jargon for The Guardian in 2013. Commenters on The Guardian website’s network related to Poole’s fury by saying that office jargon made them want to “stab someone in the eye with a pen”, and even admitting to engaging in “Bullshit bingo” during meetings, by picking out how many times bosses used ridiculous terms.\n\nNowadays jargon is extensively used within the workplace and by those in the public sphere, and has proved particularly popular among politicians. Poole points out that Margaret Thatcher was one of the few politicians who refused to use jargon, referring to it as “all this guffy stuff”.\n\nSpeaking about his book on Radio 4’s Today programme, Poole emphasised that office jargon often has far more sinister undertones than just being annoying, and is frequently used by bosses in an attempt to obscure what is actually going on. Examples include referring to the need for staff cutbacks as ‘resizing’ the company, rather than simply saying that people will be laid off – resizing would never be used if a company was being expanded.\n\nPoole’s message is on the importance of clarity of communication. In a world where offices and organisations are increasingly interacting with people for whom English is not a first language, it is important, now more than ever before, to communicate clearly and without all the ‘guff’ that office jargon encompasses.\n\nMeaning is so easily lost when tied up within jargon, if indeed a meaning ever existed in the first place. To give a famous example, Kevin Rudd told an interviewer back in 2008 when asked a question about Asian security: “I’ll reverse engineer and start at the third and move back to the first.” Frankly, your guess is as good as mine – and presumably his.\n\nPoole’s concise jargon dictionary is a hilarious look at modern office jargon and the perceived need to obscure all meaning. A phrase which stands out as perhaps the most memorable: “As the astronaut Jack Swigert famously said during the near-catastrophic Apollo 13 mission: ‘Houston, we have a solution opportunity’, because of course, it would be wrong to ever admit to there being a problem.\n\nJade Fell, Global staff writer\n\nBangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has survived several assassination attempts, one of which saw most of her family killed. In spite of this, her political achievements have been notable – the country has seen poverty fall and GDP rise under her tenure. Global caught up with Sheikh Hasina when she visited the UK this summer\n\nSheikh Hasina with UK Foreign Secretary William Hague in July 2012 (© Foreign and Commonwealth Office CC BY-ND 2.0)\n\nSheikh Hasina’s life has been one of drama, tragedy and political endeavour. The eldest child of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, founding father of Bangladesh and the country’s first President, Sheikh Hasina was born into politics. To date, her political career has seen her take the roles of Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition, dodge assassination attempts and face arrest at the hands of a caretaker government. Through countless trials and hardships, Hasina has carried her father’s mantle as head of the Awami League in driving forward a free, fair and self-sufficient ‘Golden Bangladesh’ for all.\n\nHasina, 66, was first elected Prime Minister in 1996 and since then Bangladesh’s economy has been on a steady incline, despite the 2008-09 global financial crises.\n\n“One of my first initiatives was to open up the economy to the private sector,” she says. “I began to strengthen the macroeconomic fundamentals and initiated an aggressive policy to export manpower, instructing our banks and embassies to open money transfer agencies to facilitate remittances. I travelled to countries to promote manpower and to persuade countries, especially developed ones, to grant us duty-free, quota-free access to their market. Thus, Bangladesh began to develop the private sector, attract more FDI, increase exports, send more people abroad for work and receive a constantly increasing flow of remittance.”\n\n“Also, due to the attractive investment climate, countries began relocating their factories to Bangladesh. These initiatives and factors reaped benefits, steady income and growth for Bangladesh even when the world economy was experiencing recession.”\n\nSkyrocketting economy\n\nIn the last decade alone, Bangladesh’s economy has skyrocketed. According to World Bank data, national GDP has more than doubled from US$51.9 billion in 2003 to $115.6 billion in 2012, while GNI per capita has almost doubled over the same period. The country has experienced a healthy GDP growth rate of six to seven per cent since 2004, while the poverty rate declined by 26 per cent between 2000 and 2010 – despite a growing population. What was the single biggest factor in driving Bangladesh’s economy forward?\n\n“I can tell you one thing: it is our people. My people cooperated with us and they worked very hard. We also worked really hard; that is how we developed so quickly. I said, ‘We don’t have much time to lose, we have to work, you and I, to develop this country. We have to face many problems but even then, we can achieve it.'”\n\nBangladesh has come a long way since Sheikh Hasina’s first days as Prime Minister, and not just in terms of its economy. The country has received awards from international bodies for its reduction of maternal and child mortality, as well as its work to reduce poverty, while Garter lists it among its 30 best outsourcing destinations.\n\n“All these achievements have been possible in this short period because of good governance, human rights and the rule of law,” says Hasina. “Bangladesh is moving forward to becoming a middle income country soon – hopefully well before our target date of 2021.”\n\nBangladesh found itself the focus of international criticism in April following the now infamous collapse of a garment factory in Rana Plaza, in which 1,129 workers were killed and a further 2,500 injured (see Global 15, Arena: Garment Workers). The incident highlighted some major issues surrounding the country’s garment industry, which has grown to nearly 6,000 factories over the past four years.\n\n“Unfortunately, our infrastructure has not been able to keep pace with this growth. Many factories have been set up in buildings meant for residence, or hurriedly built without meeting minimum required standards.”\n\nProblems to be tackled include a deficit of employment rights, health and safety regulations, and a lack of building construction protocols. A committee was formed in response to the accident, but Hasina recognises that more must be done to protect the country’s major industry and crucial economic driver.\n\n“On assuming office this time, my government began to rectify the discrepancies. We strengthened the fire brigade; increased the number of factory inspectors; encouraged owners to build dormitories for working women; established industrial police; increased wages of workers; and we are soon promulgating a law to ensure workers have labour rights and unions in accordance with ILO conventions.”\n\nCalling the accident a “tragedy”, Hasina laments that administrative warnings from the day before were ignored. “It is very, very unfortunate; so many people died, so many people were injured. But we are assisting those people and we have arrested the owners of the factories.”\n\nBangladesh was also criticised for refusing foreign aid during the disaster, deeming it unnecessary as the situation was being handled internally. The country as a whole, Hasina explains, is striving to become self-reliant and self-sufficient.\n\n“We want to reduce the dependence on other aid, because there are so many conditions. Our aim is to develop our country by ourselves. We have our manpower, we have our resources, so if we can work together we can achieve this. We are trying.”\n\nThere has been some debate over how foreign aid money should be spent in helping Bangladesh’s development, with criticism arising both from within and without the country. Conditions imposed by donor countries regarding the implementation of foreign aid are seen by some as belittling.\n\n“When we take a loan, we pay back with interest. It is not that we are begging. We should have liberty to use that money in a proper way that is suitable for our country, because we know our country, we know where the problem is, we know how to develop; but sometimes the conditions [of foreign aid] really hamper our development,” says Hasina. “My personal feeling is that perhaps some people, or some organisations, do not want us to develop very quickly. Maybe they want us to beg forever.” Initially defensive, Hasina goes on to express her resolve and passion; a woman proud of her country and determined to drive it to prosperity.\n\n“Yes, we could depend on other foreign aid or foreign assistance, but why should we? We have to take measures so that we can stand by ourselves. Others can do it. It’s under these circumstances that we have been able to keep up our GDP above six per cent and reduce our poverty level. In many countries there is a food crisis, but in our country we have become self-sufficient in food. Our economy is getting stronger and stronger, as is our government.”\n\nThe Prime Minister takes on a guarded tone. “But I can sense that there are many quarters that don’t want [our government] to continue; perhaps they think that if we do not continue then another government will be more dependent on their aid. Maybe some quarters will want that.”\n\nBridging south and south-east Asia, and situated right next to commercial giant China, Bangladesh has a population of 160 million and a regional market of around three billion people. The future of Bangladesh, the Prime Minister tells Global, lies in strengthening its position as the economic hub of the region.\n\n“The possibility lies with cultivating good relations with all our neighbours in the region, and developing excellent connectivity with them. Bangladesh’s foreign policy is guided by a dictum of the father of the nation – Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman [Hasina’s father]: ‘Friendship towards all and malice towards none.’ We believe in peace as the only solution for development and prosperity. I believe if all countries reached out to one another in friendship, our world would be secure, stable and enjoy peace. Our aim is to strengthen friendships with all countries of the world.”\n\nBangladesh’s influence on the global stage is growing, and as such the eyes of the world will be focused resolutely on its upcoming national elections. It is an important period for the country – one that the Prime Minister is confident will highlight Bangladesh’s virtues.\n\n“I am confident that the next general elections will be held by the election commissioner in a free, fair and credible manner. The election will be conducted and held as in all practicing democracies around the world,” says Hasina, inviting international observers to view the elections, which, she says, will be conducted on par with elections in the UK. “As for violence, I am confident that there will be none.”\n\nDespite Hasina’s conviction, the country continues to face allegations of political and bureaucratic corruption – an allegation with which the prime minister vehemently disagrees, saying: “Show me the evidence of corruption, and we will address it.\n\n“If there is really corruption, how could we have achieved our GDP above six per cent, our food security? How could we have reduced our poverty from 41 per cent to 26 per cent? People put out many remarks just to defame our government, but you have to examine whether this country is moving forward or not. That is important. Blaming, defaming – that is halting the development of our people.”\n\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s assassination\n\nHasina’s father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated together with 18 members of Sheikh Hasina’s family on 15 August 1975, when Sheikh Hasina and her sister, Sheikh Rehana, were out of the country. The military dictator Major General Ziaur Rahman assumed power, amending the constitution to allow religious parties into the political sphere, making groups such as Jamaat-e-Islami (BJI) legal. The new political climate bred extremism and terrorism, the Prime Minister explains, reaching its peak during the final Bangladesh Nationalist Party-BJI alliance, 2001-06.\n\n“Bomb blasts, grenade attacks, extra-judicial killings were regular and targeted against our leaders, supporters and minorities. Two of our MPs were killed. Several attempts were made on my life with the last being an attack on 24 August 2004 at a rally that I was addressing in protest of a grenade attack on the British High Commissioner.”\n\nDuring the rally, 23 people were killed and more than 200 injured. “I escaped miraculously but with damaged eardrums,” says Hasina. During another attack, 500 bombs were detonated across 63 of Bangladesh’s 64 districts, all within the span of half an hour. “The intention was to announce their presence as a force in the country,” Sheikh Hasina explains. “Such was the state of affairs when I was elected Prime Minister in December 2008. My immediate aim was to rid the country of terrorism and extremism. Terrorists have no religion. Perhaps terrorism itself is their religion, but they have no other religion. But it is in the name of religion that they try to destroy people.” She adds: “Under the circumstances, I really appreciated the support of the Commonwealth and other organisations. They put tremendous pressure onto that government.”\n\nOver the past four years, Hasina has succeeded to a great extent in ending bomb and grenade attacks in Bangladesh, and she remains optimistic about the future and her people. “I believe our people are peaceful in nature. They abhor violence. If given the opportunity, they would resist boldly against those who want to change the nature of our society and way of life. I believe the people will stand for secular democracy and that shall prevail, as shall peace in the land.”\n\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was the founding father and President of Bangladesh until his assassination. His actions and teachings have played the utmost part in Sheikh Hasina’s personal and political development, affecting her to this day. “As a child, my father was deeply moved by the suffering of our people. He grew up with the determination to free them from poverty. On joining politics, he learnt that our people’s economic salvation lay in independence. In his search for independence, he had to struggle and this frequently led to his imprisonment. The then government could not break his spirit or douse the fire for our people’s freedom. He ultimately achieved Bangladesh for our people.\n\n“As the eldest child of the family, I was close to my father and saw and felt the pain and suffering my father endured for our people. They were all that mattered to him, and they remain deeply ingrained in my mind and spirit. When he was assassinated, I felt that it was my duty and responsibility to continue his struggle for our people’s freedoms and wants. His legacy made it easy for me to continue, sustain and strive to attain his goal of ‘Sonar Bangla’, or ‘Golden Bangladesh’, with happy and prosperous people living a life of dignity.”\n\nHaving endured years of attacks and hardships, what is it that drives her to carry on? “I live to fulfil the dream of my father, cut short by his brutal assassination. All close members of our family were killed. My sister Sheikh Rehana and I were alone in this world. We had to survive and, as the older sibling, I took the responsibility for us to see that our father’s dream of a Golden Bangladesh became real. This is what has driven me to carry on from that tragic day. It drives me even today without respite.”\n\nBy the end of her current tenure, Sheikh Hasina wants to have set Bangladesh on the path towards achieving the 2015 Millennium Development Goals, aimed at confronting terrorism and extremism, tackling climate change, developing women’s empowerment and improving health.\n\nAs a powerful female leader of the people, Hasina is an inspiration to many. Did being a woman make her journey to the top easier or more difficult? “Nothing is easier, everything is harder. As a politician, when I became the head of my party, I never felt that I was man or woman. What I felt is that people accepted me as their leader.”\n\nWhat advice would she pass on to people, and women in particular, who want to follow in her footsteps?\n\n“Politics means to help people, to serve people, to ensure people have a better life. So if you want to do it, you have to sacrifice, you have to face all the obstacles. I definitely want more women to come forward and join politics because women can do more good for the people, for the nation. That’s what I think.”\n\nFree time is a luxury to the woman who holds one of the most challenging and stressful jobs in the world. In the rare moments she has outside of work she reads, listens to music and spends time with her family – she has two children. “They give me hope and strength to carry on.”\n\nOriginally published as ‘”Politics” means to help people, to serve people, to ensure people have a better life’.\n\nMoney laundering regulations are causing banks to close their doors to companies that provide money transfer services to avoid the risk of heavy fines if ill-gotten gains are passing through their accounts. Yet hundreds of legitimate firms could go out of business in the UK alone, leaving migrants with no safe way to send money home to relatives\n\nMoshadur Rahman Choudury is unlucky. He has fallen foul of a trend for the world’s biggest banks to pull out of operations which risk breaking rules against money laundering. Choudury’s small company, based in Shadwell in east London, remits money between the UK and Bangladesh. In August its bank account was closed down by Barclays bank. He has been unable to find another bank and has given notice to four staff members that the money-transfer business will fold, unless alternative banking can be sourced.\n\nHe is not alone. In the UK, Barclays took the decision to close the business accounts of 250 money service companies, many of which provide links to countries such as Somalia, Bangladesh and Pakistan. It raised a storm of controversy in diplomatic and NGO circles. Why did Barclays take this unpopular route? The bank suggested some money transfer companies “may be without the proper checks in place to spot criminal activity” and thus could “unwittingly be facilitating money laundering and terrorist financing”. It was the last UK bank willing to provide services to this sector and its decision was heavily influenced by the $1.9 billion fine imposed on HSBC in the USA last year. A Senate investigation alleged that HSBC had been a conduit for drug barons and nations such as Iran, where sanctions made it illegal to do business. HSBC admitted to having poor money laundering controls.\n\nEarlier this year Barclays reviewed the eligibility criteria for small money service customers – but these are deemed to be internal policy and thus remain confidential. Moshadur Rahman Choudury said Barclays gave no details of the criteria used when it decided to close his account. “If they’d told us and we’d failed to maintain those criteria, then they could stop our banking,” he complained.\n\nCritics of Barclays’ move say if there is no evidence of wrongdoing, it is unfair to end the banking relationship. And they argue that if it does destroy money transfer businesses, this will deprive migrant workers of cheap and familiar channels for remittances.\n\nThe Bangladesh High Commissioner in the UK, Ambassador Mohamed Mijarul Quayes, told me his government encourages the Bangladeshi diaspora to send money home “through regular channels” but if the small remitters close down, he fears people will turn to “informal arrangements” such as the traditional exchange mechanism known as hawala or hundi. “No one would have control of that,” he added, and, perversely, such an action might bring increased risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. He is still trying to find ways to allow some of the small Bangladeshi companies to survive, though they might be forced to operate under the umbrella of larger organisations.\n\nThe fiercest opposition to Barclays’ move has come from the Somali community. Somali money transfer companies are in a unique position for two reasons – the country lacks a formal banking system after years of conflict and is heavily reliant on remittances. Research by Oxfam suggests Somali migrants in the UK send US$162 million back to Somalia every year, providing an essential lifeline in a nation where a million people rely on humanitarian aid. The Somali Money Services Association, which represents the transfer companies, warned the closures would “have dire consequences in Somalia, where no alternatives to the money service businesses exist”. Mo Farah, the Somali-born Olympic gold medallist joined the campaign against Barclays and was among the 25,500 people who signed a petition to the UK government against the account closures.\n\nIn fact, Barclays has been involved in talks with financial regulators, the UK Treasury and the money transfer companies and it has extended deadlines for account closure, in some cases several times. At the time of writing, four Somali companies including the largest, Dahabshiil, had until the end of September to find new banking. But just how likely is it that any of the 250 money service businesses involved in this story have dangerously lax standards? Barclays has not accused any of them of this. Indeed, in a letter to Abdirashid Duale, CEO of Dahabshiil, Barclays said it was a commercial decision and “not a negative reflection on your anti-money laundering standards nor a belief your business has unwittingly been a conduit for financial crime”. So perhaps it is not about what is actually happening, but what might happen.\n\nLet’s step back. The truth is that all global banks, not just Barclays, are under pressure to reduce their risks of being caught up in money laundering. Much of this is driven by the attitude of the US regulators and it has had consequences for other types of business too. In the Middle East and parts of Asia, some of the biggest commercial banks are retreating from what are called ‘correspondent banking relationships’, where the banks team up with local lenders to offer services such as trade finance. The problem is that the global banks based in the UK and US are unwilling to spend time and money checking out the local bank to ensure its anti-money laundering policies are robust. This results in impeding the flow of trade finance – the short-term loans which make up a vital part of the global economy.\n\nSome senior bankers in trade finance are now lobbying for a relaxation of the regulatory crackdown on money laundering. They fear its unintended consequences. There’s a certain irony here. Banks are widely held to be primarily to blame for events that led to the recession. They are urged to behave more responsibly as global citizens with a social purpose. And yet it seems some of the post-crisis regulation may discourage them from providing vital services to communities.\n\nThere are competition issues too. The customers of Moshadur Rahman Choudury in London may have to turn elsewhere to send money home, perhaps to a more costly money channel. Choudury talks darkly of small companies being edged out, because “big fish want to play the market”. High Commissioner Mohamed Mijarul Quayes worries that Barclays’ withdrawal of services might contribute to “an oligopoly” of the big boys, the largest remittance houses. Barclays’ deeply controversial move ought to make us reassess what banking is for and whom it serves.\n\nWhen governments launch heavy-handed assaults against their own people, Western countries have to decide if, and how, to intervene. But even well-intentioned interventions can have unintended consequences\n\nThe blood-ridden upheavals of the Arab uprisings have led to a questioning by Western democracies of their own values, central to which is the dilemma of how much to stay away from tragedy and how much to intervene.\n\nDriving the thinking are two issues. One is a commitment to a democratic ideal. The other is the compelling motivation that evolved after the Holocaust and the Second World War. The horror of the concentration camps unfolded into an awareness that killing on the grounds of religion or ethnicity could be so efficiently institutionalised that there needed to be a set of global values to prevent it.\n\nThe United Nations drew up conventions on genocide and other unpalatable activities, such as the use of chemical weapons, but they have only ever partly worked. While the value is enshrined, the mechanism to enforce it is absent.\n\nTherefore the Nazi gas chamber of the 1940s became the Rwandan machete of the 1990s and – in Europe again – the Yugoslav machine gun, culminating in the 1995 massacre of 8,000 in the Bosnian town of Srebenica.\n\nIn both those cases, the international community failed to intervene until it was far too late.\n\nThose two stains prompted interventions immediately in Bosnia in 1995, then in Kosovo in 1999, Sierra Leone in 2002, Iraq (arguably) in 2003 and Libya in 2011, when the spectre of Srebenica was cited with the warning of slaughter in the city of Benghazi, ending with the air campaign that toppled Colonel Qadhafi. But the sea change had begun.\n\nA similar spectre in Syria – this time with the added repulsion of chemical weapons – was met, initially, with extreme caution, as if Syria’s Pandora’s box contained a medley of threats far more dangerous than that of Libya’s.\n\nAnd, almost simultaneously, Western democracies maintained a measured silence when Egypt’s military abruptly reversed voters’ choice, overthrew an elected president and installed its own government that went on to crush dissent and kill hundreds of the ousted president’s grass-roots supporters. A few weeks later came the first car bombing. The summer of 2013 may well be remembered as the 21st-century wake-up call on Western values because, despite Iraq, Afghanistan, Egypt, Syria and others, a key question remains unanswered – what type of government is needed to fill the inevitable vacuum that follows the fall of a dictatorship? Given that the United States, the European Union and, indeed, smaller institutions such as the Commonwealth, are steeped in democratic values, some of the answers may appear difficult to absorb, even hostile to conventional thinking.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean to say they are wrong.\n\nFor too many years there has been an almost universal naivety about the hard and dangerous road ahead after the authoritarian glue melts away. In 2003, on the eve of its Iraq invasion, the United States compared the ‘liberation’ of Baghdad to that of Paris in 1945. Yet, ten years later, after well over 100,000 civilian deaths, sectarian car bombings routinely kill. In July this year, there were more killed there than in Syria, while Iraq’s basic services remain appalling.\n\nA similar euphoria met the 2011 overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak and, bizarrely, the same applause accompanied the rolling of tanks against his successor President Mohamed Morsi – as if simply by getting rid of one ruler a panoply of good things will arrive on the doorstep. And even now, with a vacuum in Syria looming, there seems to be no road map that might pave the way to put in place a legitimate and trusted government. In dozens of interviews with academics, experts and those involved, three immediate points emerge:\n\n– First, as soon as the dictatorship ends, the institutions of state need to be maintained. If the state itself collapses, people turn on each other and form gangs, often based on ethnicity, tribe or religion. State structure is needed to suppress violence\n\n– Second, the new government needs to deliver big results fast in at least one public service that matters to ordinary citizens. An improvement in their lives in a very short period will change the way people think about government\n\n– Third – and this is the really thorny one – elections without strong, supportive and fair institutions can do far more harm than good. Often this emerges as the ‘my turn to eat’ syndrome, whereby the winner excludes and marginalises opponents to the degree that government fails to represent them in any way\n\nIn Iraq, the Sunni minority have revived the insurgency because, despite numerous elections, they feel excluded from the Shialed government. In Egypt, elections delivered the autocratic and inexperienced Muslim Brotherhood which ham-fistedly tried to push through the untested and ideological agenda nurtured for decades while hiding out underground. But instead of mentoring the stubborn Mohamed Morsi to help him understand the workings of the democratic process – and teaching him the skills of compromise and negotiation – the police, business and media blanked him with a wall of opposition and incited unrest that led to the failure of the democratic experiment.\n\nA useful way to examine the challenge of the vacuum is to recall how others have been filled. In 1986, 27 years before the toppling of Hosni Mubarak, similar street protests, eventually backed by military force, ousted President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and ushered in years of increased insurgency, social unrest and attempted coups d’état.\n\nIn the 1990s, violent crime rates in South Africa shot up under the presidency of Nelson Mandela, while attempts at reform in Russia and Eastern Europe saw wars in Yugoslavia and Chechnya, as well as unprecedented levels of corruption and organised crime. The United States’ control of Iraq led to civil war there, while failing to restore enough basic services for Iraqis to begin trusting their new government. The Arab Spring, therefore, is far from unique – it represents a universality of what people want and how they react. Past events from Europe, Asia and elsewhere give solid signposts on how things might unfold. The mission of a legitimate government (let’s not use the word democratic for the moment) is essentially to create inclusive economic development with a sharing of wealth governed by strong, impartial institutions.\n\nIn developed societies, electoral choice is now the agreed best way to achieve this. In less developed ones, with the traditional rush towards a hastily written constitution and elections, such as with Iraq, Egypt and soon perhaps Syria, this might not be the case. Given the much-predicted domino impact of the Arab uprisings, it begs the question as to why Western governments are so ill-prepared. Much research has been carried out on how to get it right, yet it seems this has yet to percolate into political leadership. Added to the three earlier points of maintaining state structures, delivering basic services fast and determining the benefit of elections, there follows more general criteria which include:\n\n– Conciliatory and inclusive leadership of the type used by Nelson Mandela in South Africa and now by Aung San Suu Kyi in Myanmar\n\n– The building of impartial institutions, strong enough to challenge the vested interests of electoral politics\n\n– The promotion of trade and business as drivers for development, using the membership of established organisations, such as the European Union, the Commonwealth and others, as beacons that create fair government and wealth\n\n– The creation of a tax-paying middle class whose higher levels of education and income give it the confidence to hold government to account\n\n– The use of mentors to shepherd new governments to legitimacy. The overarching mentor of the post-Cold War era has been the European Union, which played a major role in preventing conflict and bringing democracy to the once-autocratic East\n\nThe concept of mentoring can also be tricky, and there needs to be a general – albeit often begrudging – acceptance by the general population. But this can be achieved through the partnership of war-weariness and a palpable beacon that shows there is an alternative to mistrust and killing.\n\nRelatively well-developed Bosnia and Kosovo are still technically run and mentored by the European Union. Liberia agreed to have UN executive oversight in every ministry to stop corruption and instil fairness. The United Nations has been guiding East Timor since 1999. After the Second World War, Germany was run by the United States-led allied occupation for ten years and Japan for seven before full elections were held – and these were in societies with far stronger institutions than those posing a challenge today.\n\nThe cheering as Egyptian tanks rolled onto the streets to depose President Mohamed Morsi highlights an unforgiveable historical amnesia. Essentially, it was applauding the end of something bad without planning how to create something good.\n\nIt has happened too often. The points listed above are compressed from hours of interviews, reams of research documents and reporting over many years from Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. They need not be locked into any international convention. Instead, they could be printed on a card to be kept in our back pockets as bullet points for legitimacy and a reminder that democracy can only ever be a broad end goal.\n\nIt represents fairness and hope and not a system of government.\n\nThe multitalented Bengali Rabindranath Tagore – poet, novelist, playwright, composer and painter – became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize for Literature 100 years ago\n\nOne hundred years ago, in 1913, the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to a Bengali poet, Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941). This was an important event for the prize itself, considering that Tagore was the first non-European recipient of the prize. Recognised as the icon of Bengali sensibility, Tagore was endowed with a creative genius that appeared to be inexhaustible. His oeuvre includes more than 1,000 poems, nearly two dozen plays and playlets, eight novels, eight or more volumes of short stories, more than 2,200 songs, of which he wrote both the lyrics and the music, and a mass of prose on literary, social, religious, political and other topics.\n\nOn top of these, there are his English translations, his paintings, his travels and lecture tours in Asia, America and Europe – and his activities as educationist, social reformer and innovator. He is credited with shaping modern Bengali language and the aesthetics and intellect of the Bengalis. In the universal ethos that he espoused and his capacity to celebrate the human prospect, Tagore has also left an enduring legacy for the world. At the height of the First World War, he had declared, “There is only one history – the history of man. All national histories are merely chapters in the larger one.”\n\nNotwithstanding the towering presence of Rabindranath Tagore in Bangladesh and in India, in the rest of the world, especially in Europe and America, the excitement that his writings created in the early years of the 20th century has largely diminished. According to Amartya Sen, the contrast between Tagore’s commanding presence in Bengali literature and culture, and his near-total eclipse in the rest of the world, is perhaps less interesting than the distinction between the view of Tagore as a deeply relevant and many-sided contemporary thinker in Bangladesh and India, and his image in the West as a repetitive and remote spiritualist. Many therefore also speak of confronting ‘a maze of contradictions’ in attempting a narrative of Tagore’s legacy.\n\nRabindranath Tagore was born at the confluence of three important movements: the wave of social and religious reform, the literary renaissance in Bengal and the nationalist struggle against the British. His grandfather, Dwarkanath Tagore, was a well-known entrepreneur and his father, Debendranath Tagore, was a pioneer of the Brahmo Samaj, a group of liberals who opposed Hindu orthodoxy. The youngest of 14 children, Rabindranath grew up in a privileged household in Kolkata, in an eclectic atmosphere where he was exposed to multiple cultural influences. His literary talent blossomed early and under the influence of his brother, Jyotirindranath, he discovered his gift for music.\n\nAs a young man, he was sent to mind the family estates in East Bengal, now Bangladesh. Here he fell in love with the riverine landscape that was to be a lasting inspiration for his music, poetry and short stories. His interactions here with the common people of rural Bengal led to the shaping of a strong social conscience, as well as an understanding of psychology.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Tagore suffered a series of personal losses, with the deaths of his father, his wife and his favourite child. During this period, he first espoused, and then moved away from, the fiery nationalism of the swadeshi (nationalist) movement. In 1913 came the Nobel Prize, and international acclaim. In 1919, he renounced his knighthood in protest against the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre by British soldiers. All his life, Tagore travelled extensively, drawing from the diverse cultural experiences that this offered. Late in life, Tagore emerged as an artist of rare talent.\n\nWhen he died in 1941, Tagore left behind a staggering body of work. His collected works and letters run into more than 30 volumes. About 3,000 paintings are attributed to him. His doodles blur the line between writing and visual art. Rabindra Sangeet, Tagore’s own genre of music, is an eclectic mix of classical, folk and foreign influences, set to exquisite lyrics that have come to be regarded as a cornerstone of Bengali culture. He has the unique distinction of having composed the songs that would later become the national anthems of India and Bangladesh.\n\nThough widely regarded as a poet-philosopher, he was also a brilliant writer of short stories and had a profound impact on the emergence of the modern novel in South Asian literature. In Chokher Bali, he highlights the plight of widows, and in Gora denounces forms of social discrimination. His letters are a treasure trove of ideas, experiences and emotions, and plays such as Raktakarabi remain landmarks in symbolic drama. His legacy is as much the poet with his eye trained on infinity, as the stringent social critic whose sharp, unsparing gaze targets the ground realities of his time; as much the visionary educationist, as the passionate lover of nature; the lyricist who sings of love and loss, rain-clouds and thunderstorms, as of the spinner of tales who writes so intricately of human relationships in his stories and novels.\n\nHis experiments in music, ranging from working on existing melodies to incorporating folk, particularly the baul, and composing with ragas to innovations such as dance dramas and newer beats (talas) when the composition so requires – all are part of Tagore’s forte.\n\nIn 1924, at the age of 63, Tagore started a late but productive phase in visual arts, beginning with doodles on the pages of his manuscript of the Purabi. He referred to his art as “Shesh boyosher priya” – an affair in the sunset of life, wherein he transformed his lack of formal training in art into an advantage that opened new possibilities in the use of line and colour. He was prolific in his paintings and sketches, which later evolved into masterpieces and lyrical pieces of art. It was evident that what his creative repertoire expressed in line and colour was different from what he did in his poetry and songs. If he sought peace and enlightenment in his songs, he seems to explore darkness and mystery in his drawings. Art – drawing and painting – took over from words to aid him in expressing his deep and unexplained feelings and emotions. Dark creatures and haunting landscapes of another, primordial world constituted Tagore’s works.\n\nHis experience of painting led Tagore to reconsider his views on the role and the possibilities of the arts. Therefore, a study of his paintings provides a deeper understanding of the interrelatedness of his intellectual and creative life as a whole, and indeed, his creative personality. His painting style was very individual, characterised by simple bold forms and a rhythmic quality. His first paintings are highly imaginative works, usually focusing on animals or imaginary creatures, imbued with vitality and humour. Human figures are depicted either as individuals with expressive gestures or in groups in theatrical settings. In portraits produced during the 1930s, he renders the human face in a way reminiscent of a mask or persona. Landscape subjects represent the smallest output among Tagore’s works, but nevertheless, with no less significance in how he related to the physical world around him, drawn even from the hazy depths of childhood memories.\n\nRabindranath Tagore’s artistic adventure began with doodles that turned crossed-out words and lines into images assuming expressive and sometimes grotesque forms. Many of them represent animals, but they are seldom of the real ones we know of; more often they represent what he has described as “a probable animal that had unaccountably missed its chance of existence” or “a bird that only can soar in our dreams”. Spurred by the same spirit of inventiveness, he also took to cross-projecting the movement of a living animal onto an imagined body, or a human gesture onto an animal body and vice versa. This exchange between the familiar and the unknown, the inhabitation of one in the other, has led him to forms that are as expressive as they are inventive. Painting also made Tagore more observant and sensitive to the visible world. More than ever before, he saw it “as a vast procession of forms”.\n\nThis new engagement with the visible world found a definite expression in his landscapes. In these landscape paintings, he more often shows nature bathed in the evening light, with radiant skies and forms coagulating into ominous silhouettes that invoke mystery and foreboding silence.\n\nTagore did not name his paintings. By leaving them untitled, he tried to free them from literary imagination. He also wanted the viewers to encounter his paintings with their own sensibility and read them in that light. Yet his rendering of the figures is informed by his experience of the theatre as a playwright, director and actor. Animated by gestures that do not suggest everyday activities, even his individual figures have a dramatic presence; sometimes their costumes, and the furniture and the objects that surround them play a role in this transformation of the ordinary into a dramatic motif. They do not move into narration, but invoke narrative potentiality, especially when one figure is juxtaposed with another or when they are shown in groups. The human face is an obvious constant in this.\n\nIt demonstrates Tagore’s undiminished interest in linking human appearance with an inner human essence. In the beginning, this usually led him to turn the face into a mask or a hieratic symbol of a social type; later, as his representational skills and expressive assurance grew, shadows of faces he encountered or remembered began to meld with the painted faces and give them the resonance and expansiveness of characters. His painted faces are varied in appearance and social stature, but each one encapsulates within its small compass the lineaments of a vaster human experience.\n\nThere is in all this a strand of prescience that seems extraordinary. His prime concerns – gender, class, caste, nation, community, language, violence, environment, education, rural reconstruction, literature, art and relationships – continue to haunt us today. His humanism and advocacy of tolerance have not lost their significance for our divided world. He raised his voice against the dominance of some nations over others, but also recognised the power of language, literature, art and music to create bridges of understanding across geopolitical divides.\n\nTagore’s criticism of British colonial rule in India was consistently strong and grew more intense over the years. This point is often missed, since he made a special effort to dissociate his criticism of the Raj from any denigration of British – or Western – people and culture. Even in his powerful indictment of British rule in India, in 1941, in a lecture which he gave on his last birthday, later published as a pamphlet under the title Crisis in Civilization, he strains to maintain the distinction between opposing Western imperialism and rejecting Western civilisation. While he saw India as having been “smothered under the dead weight of British administration”, Tagore recalls what India has gained from “the large-hearted liberalism of 19th-century English politics”. The tragedy, as Tagore saw it, came from the fact that what “was truly best in their own civilisation, the upholding of dignity of human relationships, has no place in the British administration of this country”. He added: “If in its place they have established, baton in hand, a reign of ‘law and order’, or in other words a policeman’s rule, such a mockery of civilisation can claim no respect from us.”\n\nGiven the vast range of his creative achievements, perhaps the most astonishing aspect of the image of Tagore in the West is its narrowness, where he is recurrently viewed as ‘the great mystic from the East’. Amartya Sen contrasts Yeats’ praise of his work in 1912 (“These lyrics… display in their thought a world I have dreamed of all my life long, the work of a supreme culture”) and his denunciation in 1935 (“Damn Tagore”), attributing it partly to the inability of Tagore’s many-sided writings to fit into the narrow box in which Yeats wanted to place – and keep – him.\n\nI wish to push this issue of Tagore’s capacity for prescience as I take up the question of his enduring legacy. Contemporary discourse on politics and governance is linked extensively to human rights, which in turn draw from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The declaration, adopted in 1948, rests on two pillars – the freedom from fear and the freedom from want. Close to 40 years before the adoption of the UDHR, Tagore wrote:\n\n“Where the mind is without fear, and the head is held high” in his Gitanjali, and invoked awakening “into that heaven of freedom”. Again, it was at the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993, with the adoption of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, that the global community recognised that women’s rights are human rights. Women and their place in society was a major theme in Tagore’s works.\n\nIn 1936, he wrote Chitrāngadā, a dance drama on a subplot from the Mahabharata about the Pandava prince Arjuna and the Manipur princess Chitrāngadā. The final scene shows Chitrāngadā, who had invoked the love god Madan to transform her appearance, reveal herself to Arjuna. And she says: “I am Chitrāngadā, Princess royale; not a goddess to be placed on a pedestal, nor someone to be neglected and left behind. If you keep me by your side, in adversity and in prosperity; share with me your deepest thoughts, then will you know me.” Again, we see how Tagore, in three of his major dance dramas, has women protagonists representing, not a gender theme but the human context, and driving the narrative to its dénouement.\n\nOn another trajectory, Tagore coined the word puro samaj, literally civic society, long before civil society became part of contemporary vocabulary. More than that, however, is the idea of an engaged puro samaj extensively devolved and in constant interface with the regulatory superstructure – an interesting notion like what later emerges as Project Europe, and the post-Westphalian evolution of the state as a political institution.\n\nSome of the ideas he tried to present were directly political, and they figure rather prominently in his letters and lectures. He had practical, plainly expressed views about nationalism, war and peace, cross-cultural education, freedom of the mind, the importance of rational criticism, the need for openness and so on. For Tagore, it was of the highest importance that people be able to live and reason, in freedom. His attitudes toward politics and culture, nationalism and internationalism, tradition and modernity, can all be seen in the light of this belief. Nothing, perhaps, expresses his values as clearly as a poem in his Gitanjali:\n\nWhere the mind is without fear\n\nand the head is held high;\n\nWhere knowledge is free;\n\nWhere the world has not been\n\nbroken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; …\n\nWhere the clear stream of reason\n\nhas not lost its way into the\n\ndreary desert sand of dead habit; …\n\nInto that heaven of freedom,\n\nmy Father, let my country awake.\n\nTagore is undoubtedly the presiding deity of Bengali culture. As we celebrate the centenary this year of the Nobel award, we pay tribute to that prolific man and his inexhaustible creativity – as much of Bengal as of the world.\n\nWhen Bangladesh finds itself in the international headlines, it’s rarely because there is good news. Industrial disasters with high numbers of fatalities and large-scale floods have filled many column inches in the West. Yet a social and economic revolution has seen life expectancy rise by ten years since 1990 and absolute poverty halve\n\nAt first sight, Bangladesh has little going for it. Among countries of any significant size, it is the most densely populated and the most threatened by climate change. At the same time, conflict between the country’s two main parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, seems to be driven by personal enmity rather than political concerns. To add insult to injury, rich nations have threatened to block its main source of exports because of poor working conditions.\n\nYet, with little fanfare, Bangladesh has also achieved some of the greatest and most rapid improvements in living standards in human history. Would the real Bangladesh please stand up?\n\nBangladesh hit the headlines in April when the Rana Plaza clothing factory collapsed, killing 1,129 people. This was the latest and most horrific of a string of factory disasters, including a fire at the Tazreen fashion factory last November that resulted in 112 deaths. Limited implementation of planning regulations and poor working conditions were to blame. While European governments offered support, the US government decided to suspend Bangladesh from its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme, which gave the country’s exporters duty-free access to the world’s biggest economy for many products.\n\nLess than one per cent of Bangladesh’s exports to the USA benefited from the scheme, but clothing companies may think twice about manufacturing apparel in Bangladesh because of the potential impact to their reputation, even where they have high standards of corporate social responsibility (CSR). To make matters worse, strikes over working conditions have sometimes been aggressive and have become caught up in political violence in the run-up to January’s elections. CSR-focused marketing is required in Bangladesh’s main markets in the West, if ‘Made in Bangladesh’ is to become an attractive label.\n\nThe country’s garment sector grew slowly from 1985, when it employed about 100,000 Bangladeshis. But rising wage levels in China saw more companies switch production to Bangladesh, where four million people are now employed in the textile industry, making it the world’s second biggest garment exporter, with industry revenues of US$18 billion a year. However, low costs generally mean low standards and some factory owners in the country argue that improved working conditions would see jobs moved to lower-cost manufacturing centres. Given that Bangladeshi wages are among the very lowest in the world, this seems unlikely. The official minimum wage for full-time workers is just $38 a month.\n\nYet the country still does not attract the same levels of foreign direct investment as other export-orientated economies in the region, such as Vietnam. Indeed, the second biggest source of foreign exchange is overseas remittances from the estimated six million Bangladeshis who work overseas, many of them in the Middle East. The country also has significant coal reserves, which the government hopes to tap to supply a new power plant, plus gas production of 710 billion cubic feet a year, although further hydrocarbon investment has been deterred by a debate over whether output could be exported.\n\nInfrastructural investment is increasing, but is almost entirely provided by Beijing to fund projects that will directly benefit China. In particular, Beijing is pouring billions of dollars into the development of the Port of Chittagong, as part of its ‘string of pearls’ strategy to develop ports in allied nations in South Asia in order to reduce its dependence on the Malacca Straits. The country has also established itself as a world leader in micro-lending as a result of the Bangladesh Rehabilitation Assistance Committee (BRAC) and Grameen Bank, which was founded by Muhammad Yunus. Grameen provides small loans, usually for much less than $100 and mainly to women. Yunus aims to turn a “vicious circle of low income, low savings and low investment” into “a virtuous circle of low income, injection of credit, investment, more income, more savings, more investment, more income”. He says: “You have to have those financial facilities coming to women, because it is totally unfair to deny half the population of the world financial services.”\n\nIndeed, this focus on the role of women in socio-economic development appears to lie behind startling improvements in living standards over the past 20 years. Widespread access to family planning services has seen the fertility rate fall from about seven children per woman in 1970 to 2.3 today. Average life expectancy increased by a massive ten years between 1990 and 2010, from 59 to 69, while Bangladesh has made great progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goals.\n\nAccess to clean water and primary school education has widened markedly and the proportion of the population living in absolute poverty has halved since 1990. The country is also on course to cut the proportion of children dying before their fifth birthday by two thirds between 1990 and 2015. Food security has improved through the implementation of Green Revolution technology, so that Bangladesh is now self-sufficient in rice. Fertile soil allows rice to be cultivated three times a year.\n\nAll this is not the result of economic growth. GDP may have grown by an average of six per cent a year over the past five years, but these socio-economic gains were already being registered during the previous decade and a half of slower growth. India’s Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh says: “Bangladesh’s experience shows we don’t have to wait for high economic growth to trigger social transformations. Robust grass-roots institutions can achieve much that money can’t buy.” Bangladesh will enjoy a demographic dividend over the next 20 years, with a growing adult population in relation to its child population. Yet with 152 million people living on just 143,998 sq km of land, any threat to agricultural space is to be feared. About 80 per cent of the entire country is situated in the Ganges River Delta, so Bangladesh is particularly prone to the effects of climate change.\n\nThe Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change warns that a rise in sea levels of just one metre would flood almost a fifth of the country. Shamsul Alam, a member of the Bangladesh Planning Commission, says: “The threat of climate change can diminish the hard-earned beneficial impacts of years of growth and development, not just for the people in impoverished settlements along coastal belts and riverbanks, but for the entire nation.”\n\nFew gave the country any real chance of succeeding as an independent state when it seceded from Pakistan in 1971. It has confounded its critics thus far but could yet face its greatest challenge.\n\nRaised from its watery grave by archaeologists 30 years ago, Henry VIII’s vice-flagship the Mary Rose has been given a new state-of-the-art home in Portsmouth, UK, close to where she sank in 1545\n\nThe guns fired and the ship made a sharp turn, taking on water through the gun ports, which bobbed only a metre above the sea. Admiral George Carew was heard to exclaim: “I have knaves I cannot rule!” Henry VIII, watching the battle from nearby Southsea Castle, heard the screams of the drowning men as he watched the pride of his fleet being subsumed by the waves.\n\nThe remains of what was King Henry VIII’s privately funded super-vessel were preserved in silt at the bottom of the Solent – a stretch of water dividing the south coast of England from the Isle of Wight and the English Channel – for nearly 500 years until they were raised by a team of archaeologists in 1982.\n\nThe search for the Mary Rose started in the 1960s and it took six years before divers found her. Rear Admiral Lippiett, chief executive of the Mary Rose Trust, told Global that it was the largest maritime excavation that’s ever been carried out, involving 28,000 divers and the recovery of 19,000 objects – including 10,000 human bones and the skeleton of the ship’s dog. Years of painstaking archaeological excavations in very murky conditions led up to the moment when the Mary Rose finally broke the surface of the water.\n\nNearly 500 years later, the Mary Rose is being presented to the public in a new way – a modern setting that shows conservation at the cutting edge of science. The eagerly awaited new exhibition welcomed 52,000 visitors through its doors during the first month after it opened in May 2013.\n\nThe new display of objects invites visitors to confront the real people on board. “It is incredibly personal,” says Rear Admiral Lippiett. “It’s very moving because we have forensically recreated the faces of these key individuals so we can look them in the eye and we can understand something about them.” Several men on board have been identified by the objects that surrounded them and the re-creations of their faces, as well as some of the tools of their trade, are displayed on the decks on which they would have worked.\n\nThe skeleton of the archer, a powerful man nearly six ft tall, shows the physical strain which many of the ship’s company experienced. “The bones of a 20-year-old man of that day have the wear and tear of a 60-year-old today,” says Lippiett. This was a life of hardship visible in the form of the repetitive strain injuries, broken bones, arrow wounds, arthritis, scurvy and rickets.\n\nThe artefacts dredged up from the seabed were commonplace, functional and unglamorous. Work tools, board games and navigational instruments form a collection that paints a vivid picture of sailors’ lives down to the most prosaic: nit combs complete with nits. This approach is proving popular with visitors: “People are finding it very appealing to actually understand the men of the Mary Rose and this is what the museum is about,” explains Lippiett.\n\n“We are the only 16th-century ship on display like this anywhere in the world. We say we’re like Pompeii, but I think we’re better than Pompeii – this ship sank instantly on the afternoon of 19 July 1545; Pompeii was buried over a number of days and a lot was damaged. With the Mary Rose, you can see their clothes, you can see the bowls that they ate out of – to see all the objects that were there with them is absolutely unique. I’d say it’s the finest insight into life and death 500 years ago anywhere in the world. It’s a stunning collection – it’s more than just a warship, it’s a look into a Tudor town. You can see how they cooked, we can see the animal bones of the food they were eating, the fish bones and the scales the cook used to count out how many pounds of meat to give out to the men each day.”\n\nOne archaeologist, Christopher Dobbs, who worked on the excavation, describes emptying one of the recovered pots during the initial conservation process. As the content was decanted for tests the unmistakable smell of menthol rose into the air, not unlike the jars of honey found in Pharaoh Tutankhamen’s Egyptian burial place.\n\nThe Mary Rose has long been hailed as an important snapshot into a time that remains largely unknown. While many British schoolchildren study Henry’s tumultuous marriages and politics, little is known of the day-to-day life of the vast majority of people living in England at the time.\n\nRemains recovered from the depths of the Solent also give new clues about fashions of the time. Contemporary portraits typically show members of the aristocracy and there is little evidence of the clothes worn by ordinary people. The deep silt of the seabed, however, preserved wool, leather and silk – more than 500 shoes were recovered.\n\nAmong the items preserved underwater was a leather jerkin, which has provided an earlier date for the advent of that most useful of fashion developments – the pocket. Experts at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, which holds an important fashion collection, were incredulous. They assured archaeologist Margaret Rule, who played a key role in raising the ship from the sea in the 1980s, that the pocket did not come about until much later, according to evidence from paintings. Talking to the BBC, Rule said, with a wry smile: “It’s inside the jerkin, so a painting wouldn’t show a pocket.”\n\nMany have tried to get to the bottom of why the Mary Rose sank. Theories range from a badly timed gust of wind, overloading or gunfire from the French. One theory put forward by scientists at University College London, however, could explain Admiral Carew’s exasperated cry. Experts tested the bones to find out where the sailors had grown up and revealed something unexpected. Up to two thirds of the crew were from southern Europe, not the UK.\n\nThis startling discovery may be explained by an account of ships landing in a storm at Falmouth in Cornwall. Among the crew were 600 Spanish sailors who were forced into military service, having no money to pay their way home. With a cacophony of guns, shouting and crashing waves, much of the crew not speaking English can’t have helped with communication. It is suggested that this may have meant that the order to close the gun ports did not get through, allowing water to flood the vessel.\n\nI put this theory to Rear Admiral Lippiett, but he’s not convinced. “Most certainly there were quite a number of foreigners on board and that would be absolutely normal… It’s a great theory. I love theories about the Mary Rose,” he chuckles. “Every couple of years they come out with a documentary, ‘What really sank the Mary Rose‘. It’s a detective story and there are many factors. I believe it’s a combination of factors.”\n\nWhatever the truth may be, the Mary Rose Museum commemorates not only the men who lost their lives but a legendary moment in British history. The personal meets the historical in this unique display of maritime history and sheds light on the lives of ordinary people living nearly 500 years ago.\n\nThe visitor experience\n\nOpposite another famous ship in British history, Admiral Nelson’s HMS Victory, the new Mary Rose Museum in the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard provides a stark contrast with the glory of the gilded 18thcentury vessel. The dark, wood-clad form treads an odd line between UFO and Tudor warship in appearance and gives only subtle clues as to what lies inside. Keen observers might notice spidery hieroglyphs etched into the cladding. These signs, an architect’s joke, are designed to mimic the markings found on many objects discovered near the wreck.\n\nIt is thought that they each represent a unique symbol of ownership, something like the modern graffiti artist’s tag, and were used by the illiterate sailors to mark their possessions.\n\nOn board, the story of the ship’s heyday and dramatic sinking is told through the thousands of objects found preserved in the silt of the Solent. The remaining starboard side of the Mary Rose is now propped up in the museum crossed with fat, grey, modern drying pipes. Opposite, the port side has been rebuilt in a mirror image, and cleverly used to display the many objects recovered from the wreckage. One particularly fine bronze cannon sits on a Perspex replica of a gun carriage. The original is still in existence but to display it would require a lot more protection and keep visitors at a distance.\n\nSuch a long soaking damaged the timber and it is still going through a complicated process of conservation that will allow the wood to survive out of the water. After years of spraying, first with sea water and then with different concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG), the ship is now in its drying phase. Although, at present, the remains of the ship are behind glass, conservators hope that the display will be completely open by 2016. The task of preserving one of the UK’s most famous ships for future generations is daunting to say the least. The Mary Rose Project is not alone however. Archaeologists and conservationists in Sweden have blazed a trail in this kind of conservation. The Vasa, a grand 17th-century ship with dark, once painted, carved figures standing in serried ranks up the stern of the ship, is a generation ahead of the Mary Rose in terms of its conservation. The two projects are frequently in touch with each other to discuss the kind of problems they encounter along the way.\n\nIndia-Pakistan cricket isn’t war by other means – it’s much more important\n\nThe Great Tamasha: Cricket, Corruption and the Turbulent Rise of Modern India\n\nJames Astill, Wisden Sports Writing, (Bloomsbury), 2013, 293pp, ISBN 978-1408156926\n\nCricket Cauldron: The Turbulent Politics of Sport in Pakistan\n\nShaharyar M. Khan & Ali Khan, I. B. Tauris, 2013, 300pp, ISBN 978-780760834\n\nWhen discussing cricket matches between India and Pakistan, one should make it clear right at the outset that these contests are not substitutes for war – and there have been a few between the two Commonwealth neighbours.\n\nThey are far more important.\n\nSo much is clear from James Astill’s book on India and Shaharyar Khan’s on Pakistan. As to why, the simple answer is that the results affect the national mood in India and in Pakistan like nothing else. The people are ‘cricket crazy’. Another cliché is that ‘cricket is a religion in India’, with the great Sachin Tendulkar almost worshipped as a god.\n\nThese two engrossing books provide an insight into why encounters between these two historic rivals are more dramatic than anything witnessed either at Lord’s or the Oval, even during an Ashes series between England and Australia.\n\nPakistan, an Islamic state carved out of India in 1947, has a population of 182 million. India, a secular republic, has nearly as many Muslims in a population of 1.2 billion. Occasionally, Muslims who play for India – Ghulam Ahmed, the Nawab of Pataudi and Mohammed Azharuddin, have been captains – have been subjected to the subcontinental equivalent of the ‘(Norman) Tebbit test’ for loyalty in Britain.\n\nThese books are gripping enough for anyone who likes cricket. But they are not only about cricket and crammed with statistics and who scored the runs or took the wickets. Instead, Astill and Shaharyar have attempted something a lot more ambitious – and, on the whole, it comes off. Shaharyar puts it better when he says he has “written about Pakistan through the prism of cricket”. Astill has written about the new India using cricket as the vehicle.\n\nIt is quite a coincidence that both books have the word “turbulent” in the title: Astill’s is called The Great Tamasha:\n\nCricket, Corruption and the Turbulent Rise of Modern India. Shaharyar, who has written the book with his son, anthropologist Ali Khan, both father and son were educated at Cambridge – has called his book, Cricket Cauldron: The Turbulent Politics of Sports in Pakistan. Astill is in the fine tradition of English foreign correspondents who make it a point to travel to remote places, see things for themselves and personally interview the characters about whom they write. Astill, currently political editor of The Economist, was his magazine’s South-East Asia bureau chief based in the Indian capital, Delhi, from 2007-10. For ten years he has also been going to Pakistan, his “favourite country”.\n\n“Cricket, the shared inheritance of the British Commonwealth, is how I have got closest to India,” he confides. But Indian readers had better be warned that when an Englishman professes love for India, he can be relied upon to put a polished brogue in.\n\nMeanwhile, at the age of 79, Shaharyar, who has been at the centre of events in Pakistan, didn’t need to do any interviewing. An urbane diplomat, who was born into the Bhopal royal family in pre-partition India, he has served as Pakistan’s Ambassador in Jordan and France and High Commissioner in London and been his country’s Foreign Secretary. He was recently appointed special peace envoy to India by Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani Prime Minister.\n\nIn 2003, General Pervez Musharraf, the country’s military ruler, asked Shaharyar to become chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board and then relieved him of the post in 2006.\n\nCricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, a legend because Pakistan won a World Cup under his captaincy in 1992, sums up the ethos of the book by writing in the introduction: “For me, the story of Pakistan cricket and the story of Pakistan today are one and the same – it is a story of unfulfilled promise… what ails Pakistan cricket in specific terms ails Pakistan generally… lack of accountability, corruption, dishonesty, a broken education system.”\n\nShaharyar provides a gripping insider’s account of the poisonous ball-tampering row at the Oval cricket ground in August 2006, when the Pakistani captain Inzamam-ul-Haq refused to take the field after his side was accused (falsely) by the Australian umpire Darrell Hair of deliberately roughing up the ball to gain unfair advantage. The BBC or Channel 4 really should take Shaharyar’s blow-by-blow account and turn it into a 90-minute docudrama.\n\nWe learn that Inzamam was a poorly educated, but devout, Muslim who was virtually a mullah with pads on. The patrician Shaharyar had to squat down on the carpet and join his hugely talented but uncouth ‘boys’ in their nightly namaz. Under Inzamam, the team had become prone to excessive ‘religiosity’ and fits of onfield praying.\n\nHowever, reading Shaharyar’s account of the Oval Test, when even Pakistan’s military ruler was sucked into the deliberations, the neutral reader can come to only one conclusion: the intransigent Hair was as much to blame.\n\nShaharyar writes, too, of a worse crisis that broke in March 2007. The Pakistan team coach, Bob Woolmer, a former England player, was found dead in his hotel room in Kingston, Jamaica. There was lurid speculation he had been bumped off by a Pakistan player or players (using Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express collective responsibility principle) because he was about to blow the whistle on match-fixing by his own team. In reality the overweight Woolmer had a weak heart.\n\nThe beauty of Astill’s elegantly written book is that the reader can dip into it on any page. It is full of richly entertaining anecdotes from his meeting with an illegal but garrulous bookie (who later apparently had his throat slit) to bedding down with easily made mates in the sprawling Dharavi slums in Mumbai.\n\nHe sees the Indian Premier League, with its million dollar cricketers, Bollywood stars, scantily clad white cheerleaders waving pompoms and “venal” politicians and administrators as a metaphor for the dynamic and successful new India.\n\nHis thesis, which is not altogether inaccurate, is that new money is corrupting the old more spiritual India. Astill would be the first to recognise India is like this.\n\nTest cricket is declining in India and the generation growing up now, who know nothing of the five-day game, are, for better or worse, besotted with the Indian Premier League. Meanwhile, next door, for all its ills, Pakistan is strangely continuing to produce some of the world’s most dazzling cricketers. As Shaharyar explains in Cricket Cauldron, this is due to “natural talent”. He also reveals that at a personal level Pakistani and Indian cricketers are the best of friends.\n\nAmit Roy is president of the Indian Journalists’ Association.

On the surface, it encapsulates the modern military trend toward remoteness, precision, sophistication and porousness of borders.\n\nAkbar Ahmed, a former Pakistani civil servant and academic, is interested in the seamier side of the technology. He views drones as little more than a weapon of convenience against what he calls, with infuriating generalisation, “Muslim tribal groups”. He includes in this category the “Pukhtun tribes of Afghanistan”, though the Afghan insurgency transcends the ethnic and tribal categories Ahmed tries to impose on it.\n\nAhmed insists that drone operators are “ignoring the moral debate” and are instead “infatuated with the weapon and the sense of power it gives them”.\n\nYet every first-hand account I have seen suggests that drones’ powerful sensors and their loiter time allows drone pilots to become more, not less, acquainted with the enemy, and for the grisly mechanics of a kill to be seen with greater clarity than would be the case for an F-16 pilot hurtling past their smouldering targets. The notion of remoteness as inhumanity is a bizarre one. Artillery is more remote than bullets, and bullets more than swords, yet who seriously thinks that these military advances should be reversed or abjured?\n\nIn truth, the drone debate suffers from a serious conceptual confusion. Drone strikes are not some radically novel phenomenon made possible by pilotless aircraft. They represent just one more weapon in the arsenal of modern military equipment, sharing more similarities than differences to other weapons like cruise missiles. They rely on a sprawling apparatus of airbases, human spies and eavesdropping capability. In this sense, drones are a false icon. They give both their proponents and opponents an exaggerated sense of the cheapness and ease of waging war, and lead to a fixation on the weapon rather than the strategy which it serves.\n\nDespite some superficial analysis of drones as a weapon – Ahmed even gives credence to the tenuous idea of nuclear-powered drones – The Thistle and the Drone does look at the strategy. Ahmed frames US attacks on Al Qaeda and affiliated groups as efforts to “civilise” Muslim tribal groups on the periphery of their respective countries, with the effect of shattering already strained tribal structures.\n\nDespite, or perhaps because of, Ahmed’s long professional experience in one of those tribal areas – Pakistan’s Waziristan region – there is more than a little romanticisation of those tribes: he speaks fondly of “identities that are centuries old”, “an ancient code of honour”, a “love of freedom” and “egalitarianism”. These are terms one might expect of a 19th-century British gazette, but not a critical modern account.\n\nFor Ahmed, US-backed central governments “bomb, kidnap, humiliate and rape tribal members at will”, and drones merely exacerbate this inequity.\n\nOthers might suggest that this is a tendentious interpretation – that militant Islamists, especially the Taliban in Afghanistan, destroyed their own tribal structures before American intercession (see, for example, the work of LSE Professor Antonio Giustozzi); that drones are a response to, rather than cause of, militancy within Pakistan’s tribal regions; that the much-touted opposition to drones may be more widespread in Pakistan’s urban centres than in the targeted areas themselves (see research by Georgetown Professor Christine Fair); and so on.\n\nThe Thistle and the Drone exemplifies a dangerously widening gulf between how the campaign formerly known as the War on Terror is viewed by practitioners – both Western and ‘local’ – as opposed to intellectuals, journalists and commentators.\n\nPractitioners increasingly acknowledge that drone strikes have been undertaken with poor intelligence, a lack of knowledge of local cultural conditions and without a broader political strategy – but they nevertheless see targeted killings as preferable to larger wars on the one hand. Nearly half of all casualties from Pakistani ground offensives are civilians, a far greater proportion than the drone equivalent.\n\nAhmed’s erudite book will rouse the already-converted, those who are persuaded that war can never bring lasting peace, but it simply doesn’t engage its critics directly enough to change the minds of those on the other side of the debate. For those seeking a critical and engaged account of US counterterrorism, I would point them to the American journalist Jeremy Scahill’s long and richly detailed volume Dirty Wars.\n\nShashank Joshi is a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute"
