        "text": "Aim/Background: Boraginaceae is famous for the production of PAs and some of these PAs are carcinogenic, and also cause liver failure. So the aim of present study was to identify the presence or absence of hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids in the tribe Lithospermea (Boraginaceae). If any are found, it may indicate excluding members of this tribe from herbal formulation or from use on patients with liver problems. Materials and Methods: Plant samples of Onosma hispida Wall. ex G. Don, Onosma paniculatum Bureau & Franch., Onosma hookeri var. longiflorum (Duthie) A.V. Duthie ex Stapf, and Maharanga emodi (Wall.) A. DC. from Boraginaceae—Tribe Lithospermeae were collected from various regions of Pan Himalaya and brought to Beijing Normal University for further experimentation. We used acetonitrile—water gradient with 0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase and Zorbax SB-Aq column, to analyze samples. Furthermore, we also searched the literature to find ethnomedicinal importance of these plants. Results: The results showed that these plants are used orally for the treatment of various human ailments and so we further investigated these plants for toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). HPLC results showed that leaves of these plants were PA positive, and out of four PA standards, three: Heliotrine (2), Lycopsamine (3), and Echimidine (4) were detected. Conclusions: In this study, we present a new report about the presence of toxic PAs in the leaves of Onosma hispida, O. paniculatum, Onosma hookeri var. longiflorum, and Maharanga emodi from the Pan-Himalaya region. These plants are used in traditional medicine mostly in Pakistan, Nepal, and China, and the presence of hepatotoxic PAs limit the use for medicinal purposes\n\nEthnobotanical study was conducted in district Dir upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan during 2014 to explore the benefits of the wild flora and indigenous knowledge from the local residents about the uses of the plants. During survey, the indigenous information about the local ethnobotanical uses of plants was gathered through questionnaire method and individually every respondent was asked about the detail use of a plant. Majority of the plants are used as medicinal for various diseases. Commonly, remedies of the plants prepared in extraction and decoction form, normally, which is taken orally while some of them applied externally. Each plant specimen was arranged with their scientific name, family name, common name, vernacular name, plant habit, part used and local knowledge about its use in taxonomic order. From the research area, total 64 wild plants recorded as locally used for numerous aims. It was notified that the reported plants are collected by the local residents from wild and sold in the market that may improve the economy of the local people. The local populace has always used the medicinal plants for various diseases and have dependent on the plants for their food, shelter, health, fodder, fuel, medicine, and various cultural purposes. The collected plant specimens were identified, preserved and pasted on labeled herbarium cards and deposited in the Department of Weed Sciences, The University of Agriculture, Peshawar Pakistan. It was concluded that the inhabitants of the remote areas mostly dependent on plants, to be under risk, therefore it need instantaneous attempts for conservation of reported plant species.\n\nThe present work was conducted at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in the agency of Kurram (33° 49' 07'' N and 70° 10' 24'' E), an administrative part of the late federally administered tribal area (FATA) of Pakistan. Aim of the study was to document the medicinal flora based on local information, i.e., local classification, part used, drug preparation and dosage. Ethnomedicinal data was obtained through semi structured interviews after obtaining the respondents prior informed consent. During field visits 72 people were interviewed 150 plant species belonging to 131 genera in 86 families were documented. The documented plants were found to be effective for 64 disorders, from simple to complicated health issues. In a quantitative analysis, 31 plant species showed fidelity level ranges from 33-100% and relative frequency of citation from 0.03 to 0.28. Conservation issues related to plant use need to be investigated.\n\nPakistan has great diversity of culture, civilization and plant resources. The present research work was carried out in the historical Kalash valley district Chitral that inhabits people with unique and indigenous culture, language and is considered to be the descendants of Alexander the Great. A detail survey was carried out to document the plants and their parts preferred by sheep, goats and cows in the valley. The cow grazed on 47 plant species, of these, 20 were highly palatable, 18 mostly palatable and 9 were less palatable. Whole plants of 25, leaves of 19, shoots of 2 and flower of 1 species were preferred by the cow. Goats grazed on 65 species, of which 20 each were highly palatable and less palatable, 21 mostly palatable and 4 were rarely palatable. Whole plants of 26, leaves of 24, shoots of 14 and fruit of one species were preferred by goats. Sheep grazed on 42 species, of which 18 were mostly palatable, 13 highly palatable, 10 less palatable and one species was rarely palatable. Whole plants of 17, leaves of 13, shoots of 10 and fruit of one species were preferred by sheep. Cattle rearing are main and traditional source of income generation for the Kalash people. Grazing is one of the factors that reduced the rangeland vegetation, species occurrence and caused decline in distribution of medicinal plants in the area.\n\nThe inhabitants of District Swabi are mainly dependent on live stocks and agriculture. The district is self-dependent on the basis of veterinary and its products. However different ailments had affected these products. Ethno veterinary knowledge provides standard and cheaper treatments of livestock through traditional medicines. This study was performed to compile the ethno veterinary understanding of local inhabitants concerned with utilization of natural sources. The present survey was conducted to collect and compile the folk Ethno veterinary remedies practiced in Swabi district, Pakistan. Data was collected during 2015 to 2017 in various parts of District Swabi by intervening 150 inhabitants through semi-structured questionnaire. Direct matrix ranking for the recorded medicinal plant diversity and their healing potential were calculated. Specimens of reported medicinal plant were identified, collected, mounted and then deposited to Center of Plant Biodiversity, University of Peshawar herbarium. The results reflected that 67 planta were used in Swabi for curing various livestock ailments. Families recorded were 37 dicot and 5 monocot respectively. Most valuable plants species were also recorded for curing different diseases. Frequently plant parts used were either the leaves or the whole plants (18.57%). The Majority of the plants compiled to cure different diseases were growing in wild. According to DMR data Albezzia lebbeck and Cassia fistula ranked first and Dalbergia sisso was ranked at the end due to its multipurpose uses in the recorded areas.Majority of recipes are directly recorded as fodder. This study concluded that the area is blessed with rich diversity of plants as well as traditional knowledge. People of old age were more aware regarding the traditional remedies in comparison to young generations. Furthermore, the costs of allopathic medicines and their inaccessibility to veterinary clinics, this indigenous treatment provides an alternative as well as low cost treatment to rural inhabitants. To increase the knowledge regarding sustainable utilization and conservation of Ethno veterinary is needed to arrange and design training courses under the supervision of veterinary experts.\n\nNational Parks are diverse habitat for different medicinal plants. So far 21 areas in Pakistan have been declared as National Parks (NP). The present investigations focus on the ethnobotanical study of important medicinal plants of Chitral Gol National Park. The local inhabitants including ethnic groups of Kalash living in the vicinity of the Park have always used the medicinal herbs for various ailments and are dependent on the plants in their surrounding for, food, shelter, health, medicine, fodder and various cultural purposes. A total of 31 trees, herbs and shrubs belonging to 21 families were recorded which are used as fuel, fence and as medicine by the local inhabitants. About 100 informants and local Hakims were interviewed in this regard. Artemisia maritima, Artemisia brevifolia and Rosa webbiana are dominant species suitable for harvesting, while Ephedra gerardiana and Ferula narthex are vulnerable to harvesting. The precious ethnobotanical knowledge is disappearing very fast, so this study could be helpful in conservation of ethnobotanical knowledge."
