        "text": "An autopsy of Pakistan’s World Cup blues\n\nIt has barely been a fortnight since the inauguration of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 in Australasia and team Pakistan has already found itself in a position where a group stage exit looks probable. As expected, Pakistani fans have wasted no time in expressing their anger and disappointment at the team’s dismal and lacklustre outings against India and the West Indies. Criticism is on display in its many forms; from bashing Misbah and his boys on social media to burning effigies and staging mock funerals in the streets of Multan. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2hqtp9_disappointed-fans-stage-mock-funeral-for-cricket-team-after-defeat_news#from=embediframe[/embed] Former players including Wasim Akram and Shoaib Akhtar have expressed their annoyance on live television as well, by blasting the approach and attitude of this seemingly incompetent Pakistan team. In short, a storm has arrived in the shape of a countrywide emotional breakdown, stemming from nostalgia of the fierce and flamboyant cricketing side that Pakistan once used to be. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Wasim Akram (L) and Shoaib Akhtar (R)[/caption] While it may seem comforting and appropriate to join the bandwagon of swears and curses, it is important to recognise the many reasons that led Pakistan cricket to this point. Before getting to the ‘what went wrong with Pakistan cricket’ conundrum, we must take a trip down memory lane to the last time Pakistan’s ODI 11 managed to make positive headlines. On March 2, 2014, Shahid Afridi theatrically saved Pakistan from an embarrassing defeat against arch rivals India in an important Asia Cup encounter at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur, Bangladesh. Pakistan was on course to chase a relatively easy target of 246 runs, when Ravichandran Ashwin triggered a batting collapse by dismissing a well set Mohammad Hafeez in the 44th over. At the time of the dismissal, Pakistan had scored 200 runs for the loss of five wickets. Within the space of less than six overs and 36 runs, team Pakistan lost four more wickets and almost managed to throw it all away before Afridi struck two mammoth sixes off Ashwin’s spin bowling, to knock India out of the Asia Cup. It was a fitting end to a fantastic contest as the game was won in the final over and that too in a familiar and dramatic ‘Pakistani’ fashion. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"533\"] Sahid Afridi reacts (R) and Junaid Khan (L) looks on after winning the sixth match of the Asia Cup one-day cricket tournament between India and Pakistan at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka on March 2, 2014. Photo: AFP[/caption] A scintillating victory against hosts Bangladesh followed, as Pakistan’s batsmen successfully chased down a gargantuan total of 327 runs. Even though Ahmed Shehzad was the top scorer with 103 runs to his name, it was the pair of Shahid Afridi and Fawad Alam that provided the impetus for this unlikely chase. Alam played a fluent knock of 74 runs off 70 balls, while Afridi carried on his blistering form by hammering 59 runs off just 25 deliveries. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"533\"] Ahmed Shehzad plays a shot during the eighth match of the Asia Cup one-day cricket tournament between Bangladesh and Pakistan in Dhaka on March 4, 2014. Photo: AFP[/caption] The feat was celebrated by cricket viewers all over the world but little did anyone know that this victory would go on to mark the beginning of the end of Pakistan’s ODI stronghold. Out of 16 One Day Internationals since that epic win, Pakistan has lost 13, which is the worst win/loss ratio among the top eight ODI teams in the past 12 months. Before we discuss the internal problems with the team, let’s shed some light on a few external setbacks that have heavily dented Pakistan’s chances of emulating the class of 1992 by lifting the coveted trophy in Australia: The Magician’s bend On September 9, 2014, Misbahul Haq’s strategies were dealt with a serious blow as Pakistan’s biggest bowling asset, Saeed Ajmal, had been banned from bowling in international cricket. Over the past five years, Ajmal had established a reputation for himself as the best spinner in the world and Pakistan’s bowling schemes revolved around his expertise. Ajmal’s action was reported as suspect on the tour of Sri Lanka in August due to which the off-spinner had to travel to Brisbane for testing. The results of these tests showed that the flex in the Magician’s bowling action was more than twice the permissible limit of 15 degrees. After working strenuously for months in an attempt to straighten his bowling arm, Ajmal got his action re-tested in Chennai in late January. Even though his action was declared legal by the ICC earlier this month, it was too late for Ajmal to be a part of Pakistan’s World Cup plans as the 15 man squad had already been announced. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"533\"] Pakistan off-spinner Saeed Ajmal has been cleared by the ICC for his bowling action but has ruled out his involvement in the World Cup except for in an extraordinary situation. Photo: AFP[/caption] Injuries In addition to Ajmal’s absence, Pakistan’s squad has been plagued with injuries in the past few months. Talented left arm fast bowler Junaid Khan, who has been a key member of Pakistan’s bowling attack for a good part of the last four years, was sidelined with a thigh injury a few days before the start of the World Cup. Shortly after, opener batsman Mohammad Hafeez was ruled out of the World Cup with a calf injury which further added to Pakistan’s injury woes. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Junaid Khan (L) and Mohammad Hafeez (R) out of the World Cup due to injuries.[/caption] Restricted to Asia In November 2013, Pakistan became the first Asian team to win an ODI series in South Africa. Unfortunately, the final ODI of this tour played at Centurion Park was the last time Pakistan played an international game of cricket outside the Asian continent. Playing conditions are significantly different in Asia than the rest of the world, due to which Pakistan’s limited overs prowess has greatly suffered. Pakistan’s batsmen have only played on flat Asian decks for the past year, as a result of which they have struggled to adapt to the bouncy tracks in Australia and New Zealand. The depressing reality is that Pakistan has not toured Australia or England (excluding the Champions Trophy in 2013) since 2010 and 10 out of the 15 players in Pakistan’s World Cup squad have never played in Australia before. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"533\"] Pakistan players celebrate after South African opener Graeme Smith goes back to pavilion following his dismissal by Junaid Khan. Photo: AFP[/caption] A useless cricket board When asked about the reasons behind Pakistan’s humiliating start to the World Cup, the Chairman of Pakistan Cricket Board’s Executive Committee, Najam Sethi, was quick to point out that the Pakistan team was missing several key players and lacking experience. However, his reasoning soon started to sound like a complain as he went on to state that Pakistan had played less international matches than other cricketing nations, leading up to the grand event. This is the sort of answer one should expect from a PCB executive, as the board has never hesitated in making excuses, failing to acknowledge and outline the many frailties in the team. Every cricketing nation has four full years to prepare for the World Cup and it is the nonexistence of a futuristic vision for Pakistan cricket that has led to such rubbish justifications by Sethi. Pointing fingers has been a prominent attribute of the incapable board which is infamous for its turbulent relations with several players in the past. The repeated change of chairmen last year serves as a glimpse into the dodgy state of affairs underway at the PCB headquarters. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"533\"] Public, media pressure to blame for team's poor performance says Najam Sethi. Photo: AFP[/caption] The inevitable decline The terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in March 2009 signalled the end of Pakistan’s international cricket hosting rights. The manner in which the Pakistan team has competed in world cricket ever since is worthy of praise but a team can only maintain its high standards up to a certain point after having lost home ground privileges. The players that held the team together in these dark times have aged significantly, with the shadow of retirement looming over their respective careers. It is impossible for the new crop of youngsters to blossom in the same manner by playing home games in Dubai and Sharjah rather than Lahore and Karachi, where they play their domestic cricket. The effects of not being able to play at home have finally started to kick in six years after the tragedy and if international cricket does not return to Pakistan in the foreseeable future, the Asian giants might starve to an untimely demise. Three wins in 16 games has arguably been Pakistan’s worst run since the inception of One Day International cricket. External elements might have handicapped the men in green but there is still no excuse for the manner in which they have failed. To lose to a World Cup fixture against a not so highly rated West Indies team by a colossal 150 run margin indicates that the current team is trying to survive rather than thrive. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"400\"] Pakistan captain Misbahul Haq walks off after being dismissed by the West Indies. Photo: AFP[/caption] Highlighted below are the many factors that are hindering Pakistan’s chances to stay alive in the World Cup: Trouble at the top Finding a consistent opening pair has been the main worry for selectors since the start of the new millennium and misfiring openers still remain a major chunk in Pakistan’s armour. The team’s top order batting can be argued to be at its lowest ebb as Pakistan succumbed to 1-4 in their recent clash against the West Indies. It is baffling how an out-of-form Younus Khan was given the nod to open the batting against India ahead of the aggressive Sarfraz Ahmed, who had a memorable 2014 with the bat and has been selected as a third opener in this 15 man squad, according to chief selector Moin Khan. In the match against West Indies, Sarfraz should have been an obvious choice ahead of Nasir Jamshed, who was a last minute replacement for the injured Mohammad Hafeez. It was no surprise to watch Nasir fail to make a comeback to the team for the umpteenth time. The big man has rarely featured for Pakistan in the past year and lacked the agility and balance required to cope with the short pitched delivery from Jerome Taylor that got him out for a silver duck. At the other end, Ahmed Shehzad has looked shaky to say the least, failing to rotate the strike and dispatch bad balls. His vulnerability outside the off-stump early on in the innings has been identified by opponent bowlers, and in order to silence his critics he must immediately adjust his questionable technique by playing shots closer to his body. What is more worrying than these opening pair disasters is the absence of a genuine number three batsman. Mohammad Hafeez, Asad Shafiq, Younis Khan and several others have been tried and tested at this position over the past year and to Pakistan cricket’s misfortune, none of these players have done justice to this all-important batting slot. The inability to chase Long gone are the days when Inzamamul Haq and Mohammad Yousuf used to play their trade at the heart of Pakistan’s middle order and chase down targets with relative ease. The current ODI team comprises of an inferior and inconsistent middle order which has continued to let captain Misbahul Haq down, who is often left with the responsibility to bat out the 50 overs with the tail. Top ODI teams look to accelerate progressively during the middle overs right up to the 40th, keeping wickets in hand for a slog in the final ten. The Pakistan team does the opposite; by decelerating in the middle over and losing wickets at untimely intervals, the team is forced to play for survival in the last ten overs. Due to this repetitive and upsetting batting pattern, Pakistan has failed to chase the majority of targets in excess of 200 runs in the last four years. The current generation of Pakistani batsmen has developed a dreadful habit of failing to rotate strike due to ‘over-blocking’, which is consequently responsible for a constantly decreasing run rate. Due to this inability to pace an inning, Pakistan’s evolution as a limited overs side has been stalled substantially. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Inzamamul Haq (L) and Mohammad Yousuf (R)[/caption] Weak muscles The roots of cricket may suggest that it is a gentleman’s game but let me assure you that like any other sport, modern day cricket is first and foremost an athlete’s game. The biggest responsibility of every professional sportsperson is to pay special attention to fitness training, without which success is very hard to come by. Judging by the direction Nasir Jamshed’s belly is heading, Pakistan cricket’s priorities clearly lie elsewhere. Nowadays a vast majority of cricketers have athletic bodies which help them stay alert in the field and prevent them from playing lazy shots with the bat in hand. In light of current injuries and an excess of sluggish shots from Pakistani batsmen, fitness routines should be placed at the top of the agenda right away! [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"533\"] The squad.[/caption] Unbalanced eleven Perhaps Misbah’s biggest challenge in the months leading up to the World Cup has been to find the right combination of players. Even though Pakistan cricket has been blessed with world class all-rounders in the past, the current generation of players consists of specialists only. Limited overs cricket is dominated by batsmen in the modern era and keeping Pakistan’s fragile batting line-up in mind the obvious strategic dilemma for the captain is whether to play five specialist bowlers or seven specialist batsmen. The latter has been opted for quite often and shows no signs of promise outside Asian conditions. Captain Misbah’s prolonged faith in Haris Sohail as a fifth bowler must come to an end otherwise a quarter-final spot looks ominous for the men in green. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Haris Sohail in the match against West Indies. Photo: AFP[/caption] Butterfingers Cricket’s age old adage “Catches win Matches” has been rocket science to Pakistani fielders since the very beginning. Innumerable fielding coaches have been hired time and again but Pakistan cricket’s fielding nightmare continues to linger on. In the World Cup opener against India, Misbahul Haq’s fielding unit had a below-par performance as two important catches were dropped. To rub salt on the wounds, it was India’s Maverick, Virat Kohli, on both occasions. The make-shift wicketkeeper Umar Akmal dropped a regulation catch when Kohli was on 79, after which the star batsman went on to score a memorable hundred; the first by an Indian against Pakistan in the World cup. The team’s fielding imperfections took a turn for the worse in the match that followed as five catches were put down, which allowed the West Indies to post a sizeable first innings total of 310 runs. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Afridi (L) and Akmal (R) dropped catches. Photo: AFP[/caption] Pakistan’s poster boy Shahid Afridi was the centre of attention for all the wrong reasons on this occasion; his energetic presence in the field was short lived as he was accountable for two of the five missed chances. Fielding coach Grant Luden has a tough task ahead of Pakistan’s match against Zimbabwe on Sunday, as it could be assumed that a few more bad fielding efforts might trigger the end of his stint. https://twitter.com/cricketworldcup/status/568925002835234816/photo/1 Disciplinary issues Speaking of Grant Luden, recent reports suggest that the fielding coach had contemplated resigning due to the attitudes of a few players who had questioned his low-profile cricketing past during fielding drills. While this story has been brushed aside as a rumour by the PCB, other incidents of indiscipline have surfaced as well, most notably a breach of curfew by eight players, including former captain Shahid Afridi. The players were reportedly 45 minutes late after dinner at a restaurant in Sydney and were fined 300 Australian dollars each. To supplement the tensions in the Pakistani camp, chief selector Moin Khan (who had accompanied the team to Australia) has sparked controversy in the media by being spotted in a casino two days before Pakistan’s match against the West Indies. An investigation has been launched by the PCB with respect to this incident and Moin has been asked to return home. The role of Umar Akmal Having been a regular feature in Pakistan’s ODI set-up since the past five and a half years, it is high time someone questioned Umar Akmal’s role in the team. Is he a middle-order batsmen or a finisher? Is he there to bat till the very end or is he simply there to provide impetus? Don’t even get me started on his role as a wicket-keeper. It is indeed frustrating to look back at Akmal’s career as he has shown no signs of growth as a batsman since his debut and continues to throw his wicket away cheaply after managing to get solid starts. Considered as the future of Pakistan’s batting at a time, it is safe to say that Akmal has been responsible for more losses than wins. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"466\"] Pakistan batsman Umar Akmal attempts to hook a ball from the England bowling during their one-day international World Cup warm-up cricket match at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on February 11, 2015. Photo: AFP[/caption] Mental strength Representing your country in a World Cup is a great honour for every sportsman and with this important duty comes a great amount of pressure to perform. 11 of the 15 selected players have played less than 70 One Day Internationals, which goes on to show the extent of inexperience in this particular Pakistan squad. The pressure created by Pakistan’s bad form over the past year is causing these players to lose confidence in their abilities individually, and as a team. It is very easy for young cricketers to get overwhelmed by the magnitude of this mega-event which can cause them to hit the panic button and lose the battle before it is actually lost. Pakistan’s youngsters have been ‘overwhelmed’ a bit too often and have failed to back themselves mentally in the tournament so far; especially while batting second. The mental strength of a side defines its character and its ability to cope in pressure situations. Pakistan will require a lot of character, especially from the senior players in the team if they are to make it to the quarter finals in this edition of the world cup. After a thorough examination of Pakistan’s various weaknesses, let’s discuss the challenges that lie ahead. Here is the bottom line with respect to the team’s position in the on-going World Cup:\n\nIf the men in green are to stand any chance of making it to the last eight, they must aim to win all four of their remaining matches in the group stage.\n\nAfter two heavy defeats against India and the West Indies, Pakistan has nosedived to the bottom of Pool B. With a pitiful net run-rate of -2.26, the team could well be packing its bags sooner than expected if it finds itself tied with another team (possibly Ireland or the West Indies) for fourth position in the group. If Misbah’s boys are to dictate their fate in the tournament, they must turn things around fast. As unachievable as this might sound, it is definitely not impossible. Two of Pakistan’s four remaining games are against associate teams; Ireland and the UAE. While the Pakistanis are expected to overcome the UAE challenge with ease, they must not get complacent against an always impressive Irish team. Ireland has been a party spoiler for Pakistan in the 2007 world cup and has already delivered the first upset of the 2015 edition by convincingly beating the West Indies in their opening fixture. The remaining two opponents, South Africa and Zimbabwe are expected to be bigger thorns in Pakistan’s journey. Zimbabwe’s recent form suggests that Elton Chigumbura and Co are hungry for victory and in form with the bat. Zimbabwe has also beaten Pakistan in an ODI as recently as August 2013 when the two sides faced each other in a three match series on African soil. In the first ODI, Zimbabwe convincingly thrashed Pakistan by chasing down a modest total of 245 runs with seven wickets in hand and 10 balls to spare. Even though Zimbabwe poses a legitimate challenge, the Pakistanis should be able to manage victory if they play to their potential and bat sensibly. The match against South Africa will prove to be the ultimate test for team Pakistan in the group stage. Not only do the South Africans have two of the best current ODI batsmen in Hashim Amla and AB DeVilliers, they also possess the most feared fast bowler of the last half-decade; Dale Steyn. South Africa also leads Pakistan by a whopping 3-0 in head to head encounters in the World Cup. Even though the Proteas start as heavy favourites with history on their side, if the Pakistanis can pick up some much required momentum in the tournament they can certainly not be written off. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Dale Steyn (L), AB DeVilliers (R)[/caption] Listed below are a few possible remedies to Pakistan’s playing XI:\n\n- Sarfraz Ahmed should be immediately brought into the fold as a replacement for out of form and out of shape opener Nasir Jamshed. - Captain Misbahul Haq should bat at the number position as he is Pakistan’s in-form batsman and therefore must take on the responsibility of playing at the most important position in the batting card. Batting one down will give Misbah enough time to build his inning, at his desired pace. As a passionate Pakistani fan would put it: He must emulate the great Imran Khan by leading his cornered tigers from the front. - The five specialist bowlers must be played at all cost. - Yasir Shah must be given another chance. Playing two spinners is a practice not very alien to Pakistan cricket and it has brought much success in the past. - Younis Khan should be dropped in wake of his old age and miserable attempts to counter short length bowling. - The middle order should comprise of Umar Akmal, Sohaib Maqsood and Harris Sohail. These three young batsmen should be instructed to keep the scoreboard ticking at a steady pace, in order to avoid a drought of runs in the middle overs. - Sarfraz Ahmed should replace Umar Akmal as the wicketkeeper.\n\nLastly (and very importantly), for Pakistan to turn the tide, it is very important for Shahid Afridi to perform well. It has been a rather unusual start to the world cup for the veteran who has looked more in form with the bat than ball, the latter being his primary weapon. After playing international cricket for nearly two decades, Afridi must look to deliver the goods in both departments as Pakistan requires his heroics now more than ever. Retiring from the 50 over game at the end of the tournament, ‘Boom Boom’ will be desperate to make amends for a forgettable day at the office against the West Indies by trying to salvage Pakistan’s world cup dream in the remaining group games. Courtesy of the historically mercurial nature of Pakistan cricket, fans (including myself) continue to hope against hope for a miraculous turnaround similar to the one Imran Khan’s young team pulled off in 1992. It is this unpredictability that has taught every Pakistan cricket fan to keep the dream alive, no matter how dark the times may get. You never know what to expect from the Pakistan cricket team. As a fellow cricket enthusiast and blogger from England likes to put it:\n\n‘Rule one of Pakistan cricket: Results will be completely random and not dictated by form, logic, conditions or anything that makes sense.’\n\n[poll id=\"375\"]\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nVirat Kohli abused a journalist, but can you blame him?\n\nAs cricket mania progresses, there is no dearth to the mini-dramas it is stirring in its wake. And the media is having a field-day! Besides losing a highly anticipated pit against India, Pakistan’s other debacle was the ‘shaming of Moin Khan’; the chief selector had made the unscrupulous decision of joining his friends for lunch at a casino. God alone knows what went on in there, for all we know they ate and left, but the media had its story. If Indian cricketers were gleeful about this, it was too soon. On Tuesday, Virat Kohli hurled a barrage of expletives at Jasvnider Sidhu, a senior Hindustan Times reporter, who was watching the practice match at Murdoch Oval. Kohli had mistaken the man for a journalist from another Indian daily who had recently published a not-so-nice article about him and girlfriend Anushka Sharma. About 10 minutes later, after Kohli had gone into the dressing room, Sidhu was told that Kohli was sorry as it was a case of mistaken identity. The apology was, however, not placatory because, as Sidhu says,\n\n“… Sumit, an old friend of mine, walked toward me and said, ‘Sidhu, he has apologised to you for his behaviour. He mistook you for a reporter from another English daily…’ I would like to reiterate that Kohli did not apologise to me directly.”\n\nKohli’s behaviour questions the crushing burden of ‘being good’ on people with celebrity status. Kohli’s apology was meaningless because the damage was done. As Sidhu says,\n\n“…such behaviour doesn’t behove of an international player, even if it was not directed at me. I told Sumit, ‘Go and tell him that he is an international player and he should learn how to behave’. How can he abuse and intimidate someone?”\n\nPoint to note is that if celebrities are expected to be ‘good’ all the time, why shouldn’t the same go for the media? If there are ethical and moral boundaries etched out for celebrities, why is the media free to publish derogatory material that incites such behaviour from the celebrities in the first place? Do celebrity reporters deliberately attempt to incite and provoke antagonistic behaviour just for the readership and internet hits that such stories muster? Kohli’s anger and the resulting expletives were because of an article of him and Sharma that he found snide and derisive. If celebrities have a responsibility of upholding their stature, why is the media absolved of this responsibility? After Imran Khan’s marriage to Reham Khan, a barrage of negative articles and prior videos of Reham Khan as the weather reporter at BBC were splashed across the media. Wise celebrities ignore this menace. However, the yet unwise and callow, hot young blood like Kohli react as he did. When media ethics are studied country by country, nowhere is it considered ethical to defame a person given his public presence or celebrity status. The code of ethics of the SPJ, Society of Professional Journalists, has an entire clause titled, ‘Minimise Harm’. The important items of the clause, pertaining to news coverage of celebrities, include the following:\n\nBalance the public’s need for information against potential harm or discomfort. Pursuit of news is not a license for arrogance or undue intrusiveness.\n\nRecognise that legal access to information differs from an ethical justification to publish or broadcast.\n\nAvoid pandering to lurid curiosity, even if others do.\n\nConsider the long-term implications of the extended reach and permanence of publication. Provide updated and more complete information as appropriate.\n\nMore interestingly, in the clause titled ‘Be Accountable and Transparent’, one of the items state,\n\n“[Journalists should] abide by the same high standards they expect of others.”\n\nEven if all other clauses of the code of ethics are brushed aside, this item alone is enough to check unethical media practices. But just like all other major items in the clauses are ignored, so is this. Over the years, as the methods of information dissipation have exploded across the senses of the readers, the rule of thumb in writing is ‘sensationalism sells’. Giving the spew of information being hurled at an average reader from all types of publishing and printing, the story that catches the eye is the one that sticks. People don’t want to read about the poor young orphan who passed his exams with flying colours but they do want to read about how Kohli insulted a journalist in defence of his girlfriend. Now, there’s a story that will sell the tabloid and garner the most online hits. Who cares about unethical reporting in the original, incriminating article that started the bonfire, causing the cricketer to use those expletives? The world has its story. Like it or not, in today’s age of gory-journalism, anyone with star power needs to bid farewell to their privacy and be prepared to read all sorts of stories about themselves. AND they should remember to behave and act in the most decent, amicable manner afterwards. For if they don’t, the press will have another great story on their hands!\n\n↧\n\nWill the real Afridi please stand up?\n\n“Of Shahid Afridi, it can safely be said that cricket never has and never will see another like him. To say he is an all-rounder is to say Albert Einstein was a scientist; it tells a criminally bare story.” – Cricinfo\n\nShahid ‘Boom Boom’ Afridi is a legend, whether people agree to it or not. After close to two decades of belligerent bowling, barbaric batting and iconic off-the-field banter, I say this with great despair that the end of Afridi is upon us. Since his game changing 102 off 37 balls against Sri Lanka, Afridi has become the apple of everyone’s eye. Even earlier, he was the player that people talked about, even when the likes of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis still dominated the game. This new lad had taken a toll on the people of Pakistan, as well as the cricketing community at large, and continues to do so. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2gb6u3[/embed] Whenever Afridi comes to bat, the crowd goes wild. Whenever Afridi is out, the stands are deserted. Such is the charisma that Afridi has brought to the field. People are crazy, fanatical and emotional about him. In the entirety of his career, he might be the least dropped player ever. His aura amongst the playing 11 would strike fear in the opponent’s hearts. The Bangladeshis have firsthand experience of this as the wounds of the Asia Cup 2014 are still fresh.

With almost 400 ODIs played, he has scored 8000 runs and is five shy of 400 wickets. But those numbers do not do justice to his heroic performances. One cannot simply put into digits his Imran Khan-esque gallantries in the victorious T20 Word Cup of 2009 or the all-star performance in the 2011 World Cup, while bagging 22 wickets. But what still resonates with the masses are the twin sixes he scored against India in the 2014 Asia Cup and the bellowing cry of Ramiz Raja’s “Afridi you beauty!” that reminded us of the great Javed Miandad back in Sharjah, 1986. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"343\"] Shahid Afridi is mobbed by his team-mates, India v Pakistan, Asia Cup, Mirpur, March 2, 2014. Photo: AFP[/caption] Alongside these, no one can forget the number of world records this man has made. Most sixes by a batsman (350*), youngest player to score a century in ODIs (16 years and 217 days), joint second fastest 50 (18 balls), sixth highest wicket taker of all times in ODI (395 wickets), second best bowling figures in ODI (7 for 12), most wickets by a captain in world cups (22 in 2011), the only Pakistani to score 10,000 runs and take 500 wickets in all forms of the game and, lest we forget, the booming 16-year-old record of the fastest century scored in any format of the game (102 off 37 balls). The list goes on. Yet it’s not his magical bowling nor his marvellous batting that makes him a favourite; it is the persona that he carries. Every young boy who grew up in the 2000s wanted to adopt the Afridi name. From Karachi to Khyber, he is a favourite. The way his hair is pulled back under his cap, his fielding position at short cover and his remarkable pose, all are copied on the streets of Pakistan as kids continue to idolise him. With a lack of superstars, Afridi has become the role model everyone longs to be. He is the women’s heartthrob, the teenagers’ mascot and his electrifying energy has unified the nation on various occasions. He is the hero Pakistan needs. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Pakistan's Shahid Afridi (L) congratulates Mohammad Hafeez as he dismissed Bangladesh's Shahriar Nafees successfully during their second One Day International, ODI cricket match of the series in Dhaka December 3, 2011. Photo: Reuters[/caption] Being the poster boy for Pakistani cricket since his debut, he was never able to shake off the expectations that were attached to him. But soon, he opted out of opening for Pakistan and focused on his bowling. This proved to be vital for him as well as the team, as he secured a permanent spot in the side and, alongside Ajmal, dominated the game. Even still, the fans of Pakistani cricket expect him to deliver his onslaught. One hopes for Afridi to stick around for just five overs during his batting, and when he does, everyone knows that they are in for something spectacular. 396 ODIs later, here we are, at the close of another chapter in Pakistani cricket. He may be amongst the few lucky cricketers in Pakistan’s history to leave the game with their respect and pride intact. As the dawn of the day comes for Afridi’s departure, I can’t stop thinking about Eminem song, Real Slim Shady. For Afridi, the lyrics could go like:\n\n“So will the real Afridi please stand up, And put one of those fingers on each hand up And be proud, to be out of your mind and out of control One more time, loud as you can, how does it go?”\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Shahid Afridi bowls during a cricket practice session ahead of their ICC Cricket World Cup semi-final match against India on Wednesday in Mohali March 28, 2011. Photo: Reuters[/caption] Classified as ‘aggressive, passionate and immature’, he fits the definition of an angst-filled teenager, ready to prove himself out in the world. Whether he has proved himself or not is a different debate, but what he has done is set a precedent for future cricketers who aspire to dream big. All one needs to do is pluck at the strings of the nation’s hearts and sing in key. Afridi has done exactly that, many times, and his career has gone nowhere but north. Afridi has left no prodigy behind. There is no heir to the Afridi throne, because the fact of the matter is, there will never come another like him. Whenever he walks down to bat for the last time or bowls his final delivery, one will automatically think of how much he has contributed for Pakistan and a small part inside all of us would want him to raise his hands in the sky for the last time. All the best for the remainder of the tournament, Afridi, and may you be as victorious as Imran Khan was upon his retirement. Amen.\n\n↧\n\nSharmila Farooqi’s Disney wedding and Pakistan’s plight\n\nThe coverage of Sharmila Farooqi’s nuptials on national media and the hype associated with it had all the hallmarks relevant for a royal fairy tale wedding. The glorification of the ceremony, pictures of opulence and extravagance, and a happy couple starting a new phase – the event represented everything good in life. Unfortunately, these were pictures of beautiful dresses and lavish feasts set in the backdrop of an impoverished country. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: Aysha Saleem[/caption] This is not the first political wedding on which the national media went gaga. A couple of months ago, we had the Imran and Reham Khan wedding madness, that too just a couple of weeks after the horrible Peshawar tragedy. The wedding topped off months long anti-government protests which ended without achieving any of the intended initial goals. Nonetheless, despite the failure, Imran’s life turned for good. The problem for me with all this wedding hoopla is that these politicians have already permeated almost every aspect of our daily lives and now, it seems, they are even encroaching on our social space. Can one even look away from them? Let me start of by saying that Pakistani politicians enjoy far greater amount of media time and attention than their counterparts in most other countries of the world. They are the equivalent of both Hollywood and the National Football League (NFL) combined – the glamour of one united with the swagger of the other. Along with all of this goes the intoxicating amount of power at their disposal. In a developing country with little transparency and weak watchdogs, the power is not only there to be used but also to abuse. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Sindh CM Qaim Ali Shah and Shama Mithani. Photo: Aysha Aaleem[/caption] Did I mention that they are as rich as the Bill Gates of a poor country? Of the top five richest people in Pakistan, one is the current prime minister and other is the former president. Hence, from rock stars to intellectuals, from riches to fame, the incredible strangle hold of the Pakistani political elite on this penurious nation is remarkable. Very few are as lucky as the ‘chosen’ ones in Pakistan. And then we have events like this Cinderella-wedding topping it off. The question that begs to be asked is, since they dominate our social landscape, should they serve as role models for us to follow? Many politicians have corruption charges against them. Sharmila Farooqi’s father, Usman Farooqi, was charged with corruption and embezzlement of a whopping Rs195 billion. It was finally the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) that brought respite to the family among many others. Corruption aside, competence too is not their biggest virtue. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: Aysha Saleem[/caption] Only recently we observed the joking and jesting on cyclone Nilofar in the Sindh Assembly. The speaker of the house finally ended the discussion by claiming that a certain sacred shrine will save the city from any storm. In any other democratic country of the world, this attitude would have led to a major shake down. In our country, it was hardly news. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x28rwqg_agha-siraj-durrani-makes-light-of-cyclone-nilofar_news [/embed] Spare a thought for a moment here for the average Pakistani – the judicious law enforcer, the public prosecutor or the honest teacher who, despite day to day hurdles and difficulties, does his job honestly. Who witnesses this intimidating mixture of power, fame and wealth play on and off the screen on a regular basis but sticks to his principles. Who must have been told clichés like “no one will get caught” and that “this is Pakistan” countless times by people around him with the following words of advice,\n\n“Why don’t you get something out of it for yourself?”\n\nWhat must that man, if he even exists, be thinking today! What would be going on in his mind after watching these Disney weddings? Maybe he too now would understand the raging cynicism surrounding him and might be ruing missed chances of not making hay while the sun was shining. The problem is not that Pakistani politicians are corrupt. The problem is not that they are incompetent, break the law themselves and abuse their power. I am sure that it must happen in a lot of other countries of the world too. The problem here is that after all this, they go on to stick it in people’s faces by jeering, mocking and flaunting smiling pictures, wearing beautiful wedding dresses. By having a happy ending regardless of the results! [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"400\"] Photo: Aysha Saleem[/caption] The Farooqi story too, it seems, will have a happy ending like so many others do, thanks to the NRO, reconciliation and saving of democracy. Member of the provincial assembly and former advisor to the chief minister of Sindh, Farooqi’s life has turned for good. I wish her the best of luck for the future! I only wonder though, when will the ‘good guy’ get to ride into the sunset in Pakistan?\n\n↧\n\nPakistan vs Ireland: Will St Patrick’s Day be Ireland’s lucky charm?\n\nSt Patrick’s Day is right around the corner. The Irish, as well as the non-Irish in Washington, are looking forward to celebrating and partying all night long. One of my several bosses, a third generation Irish-American, Mr O’Brien, is a stocky little man who talks to no end and although we are not in the business of selling, he sounds like a perfect auctioneer. The other day, I stopped him in the middle of one of his verbal onslaughts and asked if he knew about the game of cricket. “No, I don’t,” followed by a long, speechless pause was the answer. I somehow knew that he would be stumped for an answer but felt triumphant that I was able to not only bring his speech diarrhoea to a rather abrupt halt, but made him think for a few fleeting moments! I did not have any intention of teaching O’Brien the ins and outs of cricket but I did tell him that the cricket World Cup was in progress Down Under. Come on, people. He did know what Down Under meant! My generation of Americans is, after all, not that dumb. Cannot say much about the current one though. A real world cup, I told Mr O’Brien, and not just the World Series type competition, which is only played by domestic North American teams. I did, however, let him know that the Irish team is doing pretty well and despite the fact that they are not a ‘recognised’ outfit, they are doing better than many top ranking teams. I seemed to have engaged and stimulated O’Brien for a minute, but then he made a devastatingly sad proclamation and said that every bloody Irish starts feeling ‘up and up’ around St Pats Day! Period. This essentially brought an end to our ‘conversation’ of sorts since O’Brien quickly reverted back to his jibber jabber about Netanyahu’s destruction of American foreign policy and how we are mortgaged to Israeli interests and the US Far Right. For once, with some reservations obviously, I did agree with the man. Yes, there are times when I feel sorry for O’Brien’s gullibility and ignorance. After all he has placed a bottle of Irish Spring on his work desk to announce to every Tom, Dick and Harry that he’s Irish and that spring is arriving in Ireland. Nevertheless, his rushed, non-sensible remarks about the Irish being on a high on St Patty’s day made me scratch my head later on. I realised that the next World Cup match that they play is against Pakistan on March 15, so close to the Feast of Saint Patrick. If my memory serves me right, the Irish did indeed spring a surprise some World Cups ago and embarrassed Pakistan on St Patrick’s Day. That was perhaps the day when an Irish victory was classified as nothing less than a shock, a flash in the pan, a below-mediocre team indulging in a giant killing act against no less than a team like Pakistan, one of the favourites at that point in time. Fast forward to today, the Irish are no longer the black sheep or the underdogs. In fact, they are expected to slay the prominent teams, the big shots, or at least put a dent on the hopes and aspirations of those who are considered the favourites to achieve bigger and better results. My cricket-enthusiast friends tell me, and I confirmed, that they need just a single point to get through to the quarter finals, a dangerous situation for Pakistan, now an edgy, unpredictable, homeless team characterised by all symptoms schizophrenic, and laced with bipolarity of attitude and approach to the game. Pakistan has certainly got its work cut out. While they did wonderfully well against the star-studded South African team, facing the Irish will be a different ball game altogether. If I were the chief selector – no pun intended, but I think I can be one in reality since the position is open to all by virtue of the gambling Moin Khan’s exit – I would pick a variation of resources. This would mean that that I would not necessarily emphasise on going all out with the quicks but introduce Yasir Shah, a leg-spinner who can artfully deceive and bewilder the Irish batters, generally known for their cavalier approach. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"594\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] Another methodology change could be the idea of getting real and manning up to all political pressure, to kick out Shahid Afridi and Younus Khan. I am no expert, but these two seem to be shivering in their pants in the dead heat of the Southern Hemisphere for no particular reason. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"596\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] Younus did finally make it to double figures in the South Africa game but that is not why he is in the team. He should sit out the game against the Irish and if Pakistan makes it to the quarters, he can possibly come back after getting his stuff figured out. Right now, Younus is a bundle of nerves, at odds with himself; too much clutter that needs to be filtered out. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"380\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] I would also not play Nasir Jamshed. He is a lost puppy, a deer caught in headlights. I am not aware of his background but it appears to me that some traumatic, historical event has impacted his mind. Could it be a cultural shock or is it much more than that? [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"598\"] Photo: Reuters[/caption] I am not looking at the glass half empty. I did derive some hope after the victory against the Springboks. At least this Pakistani team is gaining momentum, getting to a mentally stable and strong position and most of all, achieving the desired results. The broken hands syndrome is somewhat, hopefully, a thing of the past now. They proved the point by fielding so well and holding on to the catches in the South Africa game. Sarfraz Ahmed is a key asset whether Waqar Younis likes him or not. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"598\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"480\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] One thing that really irks me is the ‘Cornered Tigers’ phobia. It is putting unnecessary pressure on the players. Twenty-three years ago, the world was a different place. Without going into much detail, the Pakistan team of that time was an established unit that had a consistent past record, led by a leader with a no-nonsense attitude who did not care for the selectors, chief of mission or even the highest level functionary of the cricket board. Imran Khan was a one-man show who commanded authority and respect from his team and whoever he played against. Imran was a master tactician like no other. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"400\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] The Pakistan team of 2015 is not like the 1992 team. There will be never a team like the 1992 team. Comparing each Pakistani World Cup squad to the 1992 outfit is a diversion and a distraction. Worst of all, the 2015 team does not even have a home for eons now. They have been playing in foreign lands and moving around like refugees and nomads. This was certainly not the case with the Cornered Tigers. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] This Pakistan cricket team of today, if they want to win, needs to rid itself of whatever happened in the past, i.e. the Cornered Tigers phenomenon, the wretched political circus within the cricket board and, of course, the two defeats in the ongoing World Cup. What they should do and, for the life of me, I ask the Pakistani public to help and cooperate, is to keep their heads down, focus, bat with a straight bat, bowl their hearts out and field as if there’s no tomorrow. Leave the rest to God and don’t worry too much about the results. Victory is not how the result comes out; it is, in fact, a question of how much effort did you put in. Did you play with your heart and soul? Did you give your 100 percent? I understand there is a lot at stake but these guys have already performed incredibly well under the given set of circumstances. No other team is faced with this much off-the-field stress than this Pakistani side. Whatever happens in this World Cup, bring the boys home, bring international cricket back to Pakistan, get them some competition in their home territory, kick the rotten eggs out and perhaps ask Imran to run the cricket board. Now that he is done with the dharnas and the honeymoon period, he can spare some of his time and effort to regenerating and reinvigorating the spirit of the game in the country. As for the Ireland match, all that matters is Pakistan showing up and putting up a brave fight. Everything else is a bonus. On the other hand, the Irish have nothing to lose. They are a happy-go-lucky but exceptionally professional team. If they make it to the quarters, they will not only make St Patrick proud, they might herald a completely new era in the world of cricket. Ironic it is though that pathetic teams like Bangladesh and Zimbabwe are allowed to play test cricket but Ireland is not. My question is, why not? I am certain O’Brien would not have the answer.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n#PakVsIre or the #LahoreChurchBlast – which caught your attention?\n\nOne wonders if the National Action Plan (NAP) was actually implemented beyond the Punjab police’s wide arrests of clerics who tried using loudspeakers. After all, Maulana Abdul Aziz and his devotedly-radical wife Umm-e-Hassan still use a state-recognised mosque to propagate a narrative that insists the actions of groups like ISIS or the Afghan Taliban are all justified – commendable even. Add this to the fact that the most high-profile raid to happen in mainstream news recently was not a madrassah sending jihadists to Kashmir or a mosque being operated by the rabidly anti-Shia Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) (which still holds protests without the fear of being rebuked as violently as farmers in Okara), but the office of a popular, secular-rooted political party notorious for not being exactly law-abiding. Meanwhile, all the hate speech and weapons proliferation can continue on in centres where religion is the guiding force rather than just ethnicity. The culmination of all that doubt in our government’s (and our military’s) enthusiasm to tackle terrorism were the church blasts in Lahore yesterday which, as non-Sunni places of worship, were supposed to have been given extra police-attention. Alas, like every other regular guy, the security guards in charge were too preoccupied cheering for Pakistan in its match-up against Ireland in a nearby teashop. They didn’t think of the fact that they weren’t like every regular guy in Lahore. They didn’t think of the fact that as a Sunday, the churches were more likely to be attacked. They didn’t think of the fact that there was a bombing in Lahore barely a month ago, or the fact that one of Taliban’s allied factions, Jundullah, bombed Peshawar’s biggest church in 2013 during Sunday Mass. They simply shrugged off their responsibility and put the lives of over a thousand people on stake. If that isn’t plain revolting, the reaction certainly makes it far worse. While cricket enthusiasts continued on watching their match, just glad that it wasn’t in the Cantonment, the media proved which side it was on. By reminding television viewers that Christian protestors were carrying a nationwide protest and associating it with images of carts burning, the media ensured that the public would start equating the Christian community’s response to a terrorist bombing to the bombers themselves. And then there’s Imran Khan and his bandwagon of followers chiming in, accusing the Punjab government of a security lapse and coming out with a statement that, as usual, condemns the incident but never names the perpetrators. Anyone who has a reasonable ability to recollect can remember the great and consistent security lapses made by the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) government, with the Peshawar school attack, the imambargah attack and last year’s church bombing acting as plain indicators of the hypocrisy political personalities like Imran Khan have always embodied. For all the NAP’s effectiveness in coming out with statements to appease the international world with claims of banning terrorist organisations, Pakistan’s government hasn’t moved an inch towards recognising the threat of militancy. The only figure who has, Jibran Nasir, isn’t even part of the political framework; he can’t make decisions that count. The ones who do count, like the interior minister who claimed that Aziz had apologised for his insensitive remarks after the Peshawar attack – a claim that Aziz immediately refuted – are too busy trying to explain to the world that “Islam is a peaceful religion and terrorist groups do not represent Islam”, as if all it takes to beat radical Islam is that essential clarification by Chaudhry Nisar. All these claims and all these deliberations that insist on representing terrorism as a war being ‘imposed’ on Pakistan’s people and refusing to deal with the root problems have had a cost. It has detached everyone from the reality of radical Islam posing a significant threat to Jinnah’s Pakistan. It has killed thousands of Pakistanis, even before American involvement in the region. Above all, it has made us indifferent to incidents like yesterday’s church blasts, where 14 murdered human beings simply became a numerical addition to a much bigger death toll.\n\n↧\n\n4 reasons why World Cup 2015 is nothing like World Cup 1992\n\nYesterday’swin against Irelandallowed Pakistan to wiggle their way into the quarter-finals. The match not only secured us a place in the top four but also allowedSarfraz Ahmedto score his first ODI century. This century was not only important for him, but for Pakistan as well since itbroke the dry spellour batsmen were suffering from since the 2007 World Cup. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"558\"] Pakistan's Wahab Riaz (2nd L) celebrates with team mates after dismissing Ireland's Ed Joyce (2nd R) for eleven runs during their Cricket World Cup match at the Adelaide Oval March 15, 2015.\n\nPhoto: Reuters[/caption] [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"580\"] THANKSGIVING PRAYER: Sarfraz Ahmed celebrates his century against Ireland at the Adelaide Oval on Saturday.\n\nPhoto: AFP[/caption] Since the World Cup has begun, comparisons are being made with the 1992 edition, not just by Pakistanis but cricket fans all around the world as well.It was initially said that cricketers will be donning colour kits resembling the 1992 World Cup kit, which was proven wrong later onwards. Replica jerseys of the 1992 World Cup were sold though and were really appreciated among the fans. Keeping some obvious connections aside due to the same venue, Australia and New Zealand, people are creating similarities between the two editions to fuel their hopes of Pakistan’s world cup victory. I am not against thinking big, not at all – ‘The Magic of Thinking Big’ by David J Schwartz is one of my all-time favourites – but there are at least four reasons why I consider that Pakistan’s1992 World Cup campaign is not the same as the current on-going World Cup campaign. 1. Misbahul Haq is good, but he is not Imran Khan (the cricketer, not the politician) Misbah is good, Misbah is fantastic, but he is not Imran Khan. Misbah may add more value to the team as Imran did, but he does not seem to have the same authority over his herd as latter did. There were instances where Misbah had a verbal spat with players on the field, including the famous one with Shahid Afridi. Even if you cannot hear the conversation, the manner in which Afridi was talking to Misbah says a lot. Had it happened between Imran and another player before the 1992 World Cup, you might not have seen that particular player playing in the team as long as Imran would be captaining the team. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"] Former captain Shahid Afridi's retirement has prompted the PCB to groom a young captain especially since Misbah is not a long-term option. Photo: AFP[/caption] 2. Getting to the semi-finals in this World Cup is not a big deal as compared to the World Cup in 1992. The biggest difference between the two editions is probably the format. In 1992, you had to play good cricket against strong teams to get into the top four. Every team had a chance to play against all participating teams of the tournament. There were no pools as the tournament was scheduled with the Round Robin league concept, where all teams do face each other in the tournament and the top four make it to semi-finals. This time it is completely different. You just need to play above average cricket to qualify for the quarter-finals and then it is a matter of one or two good days and you find yourself in the finals. There is every possibility that you win the World Cup without even facing a team that you feared most. I am quite sure that even with current surge of better performances, Pakistan would have found it really tough to get into the top four with teams like Australia, South Africa, India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand.

Lala of World Cup 2015 is not Inzi of World Cup 1992 Inzamamul Haq’s performances and knockouts in the last league matches played a critical role in achieving victory. Those cameos of 30-40 runs really turned the tables in favour of Pakistan on more than one occasion. They were not big hundreds but there was a level of consistency the batting middle order had which instilled confidence in the lower order big hitters. This is not the case right now; we have Lala and he has all the ability to provide a late onslaught, but the last thing that comes to mind when you think about Lala’s batting is consistency. More often than not, he fails miserably and if he comes to bat on the same number where Inzi batted, he is most likely to fail, yet again. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"278\"] Inzamam-ul-Haq plays a shot\n\nPhoto: AFP[/caption] [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"597\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] 4. Media coverage of World Cup 2015 is way more lethal than World Cup 1992 This is one more crucial difference between the two World Cups. In the earlier edition of the World Cup, the media, social and electronic, was not that advanced and players had limited access to what is going on outside. This time around, there is a huge difference. With the help of social media, everybody who has a little bit of knowledge about the game becomes a commentator and those who do not have any knowledge at all, are critics. There is a selection committee of 140 million people deciding which 10 players should play along with Afridi. Moreover, there are joker-cum-commentators, led by Shoaib Akhtar, who can go to any low to increase their popularity rates. Sadly, players in the tournament, not only know about this but they can even have a look at how former players are mocking their age, walking posture, etc. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"499\"] Former international cricketer Shoaib Akhtar. Photo: AFP[/caption] Believe me, World Cup 2015 does not have to be the same as World Cup 1992 for Pakistan to win. We have the players, we have the talent and we have the support our team needs. I do not see why history will not repeat itself.\n\n↧\n\nSweet revenge is on its way with Pakistan vs Australia\n\nPakistan has finally managed to drag itself past the group stages and reach the quarter-finals of the ICC World Cup 2015... and what a ride it has been! The last time Pakistan was expelled from the tournament during our first rounds was in 2007. The same happened in 2003. Therefore, fans have been susceptible to Pakistan’s progress in this tournament. And losing the first two matches of the group stages did little to improve the team’s image. However, they did recover soon from the initial blows and developed a better team combination – which led them to winning four consecutive matches and moving further in the tournament. Pakistan has traditionally been a slow-starter in any global tournament; however, this time, the slow start has cost them as Pakistan – by virtue of finishing third in their group – is now slated to play pre-tournament favourite Australia in the quarter finals. An aura is prevailing in Australia among fans and critics that Australia’s victory in the quarter-finals is a foregone conclusion. Pakistan lacks the firepower needed to compete with the mighty Aussies in Friday’s quarter-final match; in fact, many believe that the match will be more of a formality for Australia. Withdrawal of ace fast bowler Muhammad Irfan from the World Cup squad due to his injury has given further credence to this thought. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Umar Akmal (2nd L) shakes hands with Australia's captain Ricky Ponting (2nd R) after Pakistan defeated Australia in their World Cup Group A match in Colombo. Photo: Reuters[/caption] However, I, for one, would disagree with these thoughts. No matter how strong or weak a team is on paper, it is the team’s performance and fortune on the day of the match that lead to victory or defeat. The arena is what decides who wins and who loses. In my decades-long romance with cricket, I have seen many matches take unexpected turns. One such upset was the Pakistan versus Australia match, in the semi-finals of the 1987 World Cup – and it haunts me even today. The match took place in Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore, and Australia defeated Pakistan on home-ground, even though no one expected it. Perhaps Pakistan’s match against Australia tomorrow can be a way of avenging ourselves. The year 1987 was the first time a World Cup tournament was held outside the United Kingdom. Also, this was the first 50-overs World Cup tournament, which was hosted jointly by India and Pakistan. During the tournament, both India and Pakistan played efficient cricket and were making their fans happy. The road to Kolkata – known as Calcutta in those days – (for the finals) looked smooth and straightforward. But both hosts were defeated by their respective opponents in the tournament’s semi-finals to once again deprive a host the opportunity to grab the world title. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] World champion Australian team in 1987. Photo: Cricket.com.au[/caption] Pakistan was placed in pool B along with West Indies, England and Sri Lanka. Before this tournament, Pakistan had never beaten England and West Indies in any World Cup match. However, as host, and in their own conditions, Pakistan finally broke the jinx against these opponents. Pakistan topped its group and qualified for the semi-final, which was to be played in their own home turf against Australia. Prior to the start of the match, everything seemed to be in Pakistan’s favour. The conditions are favourable and the opposition too was not very taxing. I think the team of 1987 was most inexperienced Australian team to represent country at a global stage. After the pool stage, there was a few days gap before the first semi-final of the tournament. The entire country was excited and confident to reach the finals. In family functions, markets as well as streets, everyone was talking about Pakistan’s possible opponent in the tournament’s final match – as no one thought Australia would defeat the national team. On the morning of the match, everyone was excited and wanted to follow the match from start to end, but those were very different days – no national holiday was declared for a cricket match, irrespective of its importance, and the country operated as per routine. I was in ninth grade at the time. Like many fanatic cricket fans, I too wanted to follow the match from the very first ball but I couldn’t avoid school and so had to miss some part of the match. In those days, internet and cellular phones did not exist and no student carried pocket radio with them due to fear of confiscation. During school hours, we all were very anxious to know about the match was proceedings. A few kind-hearted teachers kept updating us about the match by writing its score on the blackboard. When I came to know about Australia batting first in this crucial match, my heart skipped a beat as chasing a total was a chronic problem for Pakistan – even in those days. Australia, while batting first, scored a mammoth 267 runs in its innings. In those days, this was considered a great score. After that, Pakistan continued to its own downfall by conceding 34 extras. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Craig McDermott took the maiden 5-wicket haul of the tournament to kill a nation's dream. Photo: Cricbuzz[/caption] However, the extras were not the only reason why we were defeated. During Australia’s innings, a couple of unforeseen incidents took place. In the 19th over, Pakistan’s wicketkeeper, Saleem Yousuf, got injured and Javed Miandad had to take up his position – which affected the match. Also, a few run out appeals went against Pakistan, which in the final reckoning proved to have a massive impact on the match’s result. Also, at the score of 236, in a mix up between Steve Waugh and Simon O’ Donnell, Waugh was run out but instead of him, O’ Donnell began walking back to the pavilion. Everyone was happy to see O’ Donnell out as he was considered an explosive player. Unfortunately, his decision to walk off proved fruitful for Australia as Waugh was able to muster 18 more runs in the final over bowled by Saleem Jaffer. Pakistan’s innings began on a disastrous note. Rameez Raja was run out early in the innings and he was quickly joined in the pavilion by Mansoor Akhter and Saleem Malik. Old stalwarts Miandad and Imran Khan started rebuilding Pakistan’s innings after initial jolts and put the fast-derailing World Cup dream back on track. Pakistan seemed to be moving smoothly towards the target once again, the crowd at Gaddafi Stadium once again started dancing and singing with a new vigour. But just when all seemed to be going according to the plan, Allan Border, the Australian skipper, dismissed Imran, courtesy a poor decision by Umpire Dickie Bird. Imran’s dismissal at a crucial junction proved a fatal blow for Pakistan. After this dismissal, wickets kept falling regularly and the entire team was dismissed in 49 over. We handed over an 18-runs victory to Australia. The moment Craig McDermott dismissed our last batsman, Tauseef Ahmed, the entire nation went in a state of mourning. There was hush in the ground. The dream of holding the World Cup trophy was once again shattered. Change in venue and opposition did not make any difference, as Pakistan lost a World Cup semi-final for the third time. The nation was saddened and hurt by this defeat and it took days for a large number of cricket followers to digest this defeat – including myself. The semi-final in Lahore was played more than 27 years ago but memories of the encounter are still fresh for me. After a long gap, Australia and Pakistan are coming face to face in a knockout World Cup match in Adelaide. This time again, the host country is overwhelmingly favourite while the visitors are the underdogs. I hope the Pakistan team comes up with plan to explore and exploit the chink in Australia’s armour to avenge our defeat of 1987. Victory in Friday’s quarter-final match will not only put Pakistan in the semi-finals of the World Cup but also considerably reduce the pain Aussies inflicted on us long ago. I wish all the best of luck to our team!\n\n↧\n\nWahab Riaz can fill Misbah’s shoes\n\nPakistan’s World Cup campaign came to anendyesterday, and while many expected the Aussies to emerge victorious, very few had expected Wahab Riaz to put up afightthe way he did. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"595\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] Pakistan’s batting and fielding proved to be the biggest shortcoming yesterday, yet again, and defending a measly total of 213 proved too much for the bowlers this time. While Australia managed to dominate most of the match, there was a short spell of 12 overs or so when this was not the case. In a single spell of six overs, Wahab showcased an epic display of fast-bowling which had the likes of Shane Watson begging for mercy and nearly everyone in the world was left singing his praises. Wahab was aggressive and up in Watson’s face with every ball he bowled. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2k2sbu[/embed] [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"595\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] At times, it felt that he was the only player on the pitch who wanted to win and you could see it on his face and through his attitude. Bowling with fire and passion, he threw everything he had, with the exception of a kitchen sink, at Watson. If Rahat Ali would have not dropped the catch at short fine leg, the story could have been very different. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"595\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"595\"] Rahat Ali drops a catch. Photo: AFP[/caption] But what’s done is done; it is time for us to march forward instead of dwelling on the past. Currently, the most imperative thing is deciding who will be Pakistan’s next ODI captain with both Misbahul Haq and Shahid Afridi gone. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"598\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] Candidates for the captaincy are only a handful. Till last year, Ahmed Shehzad was a viable candidate but his disciplinary issues and inconsistent form have put him out of the running; Mohammad Hafeez along with Younus Khan are the most experienced ODI players. However, Hafeez proved highly ineffective as a captain when he captained the team in the 2014 T20 World Cup and the result was him quitting as captain. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"596\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"594\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"596\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] Fawad Alam, in my opinion, looks like someone who has the capabilities to become a captain one day, but first he needs the support of the selectors and a place on the team. Therefore, Wahab seems like the best option, and with his current form, I feel Pakistan should choose him. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"597\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] The thing about Wahab is that he has always been a good, if not great, bowler. His performance against India in the 2011 World Cup semi-final, where he picked up five wickets for 46 runs, showed us what he was capable of. However, recently, he has been an absolute revelation with the ball. His control over pace and bounce is astounding and he can vary his pace quite well. He has the required swing and the ability to bowl some of the best yorkers in the world. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"594\"] Wahab Riaz is ecstatic after knocking over MS Dhoni. Photo: AFP[/caption] One thing that has threatened his progress is his inconsistency due to his injuries. Also, his performance lacks experience, because even though he made his ODI debut way back in 2008, he has only played 54 ODI matches so far. Many will say his economy rate is also a concern but I feel it is something you have to accept if you are an attacking bowler like Wahab. In yesterday’s single venomous spell, I think Wahab firmly established himself as one of the best fast-bowlers in the world; he was already experiencing a creeping rise but yesterday was the cherry on top. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"597\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] Another thing that particularly impressed me about Wahab was the extreme aggression he showed, which was justified since he could back it up with his performance. It is something you expect from fast-bowlers and something Australians are not afraid to express. If he can bring the same aggression to his captaincy, it could lead Pakistan in a new and different direction and would be a change from Misbah’s calm and cool-headed approach. The fact of the matter is that Pakistan has to take a chance on their younger players sooner or later, because it will not be long before the likes of Misbah and Younus will be retiring from the longer format as well. Grooming the younger players should be critical right now. Luckily, at the age of 29, Wahab is neither too young nor too old and has just about enough experience to captain the team. Yes, it will be a risky move as fast-bowlers tend to get injured more easily as compared to batsmen but there have been great captains who were fast-bowlers – Imran Khan, Kapil Dev and Wasim Akram are just a few names. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"594\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"400\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] So please choose Wahab, as he seems to be one of the few players who can prove to be adequate captains. His captaincy could be what Pakistani cricket is lacking and in dire need of. I vote Wahab Riaz for captain.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nEven Ayyan would be a better choice than Azhar Ali\n\nNot satisfied with having had a poor World Cup campaign and an average limited overs cricket record during their reigns, it seems that both coach Waqar Younis and retired ODI captain Misbahul Haq have decided to leave us with a parting gift. This parting gift exemplifies their horribly defensive mindset which has been a major factor in the Pakistan ODI team’s mediocrity. Various reports state that it was the duo that influenced the PCB into naming Azhar Ali as the new ODI captain. It almost seems like a joke where Pakistan cricket is the punch line. https://twitter.com/BajiPlease/status/581796025788018688 Misbah has been a fantastic hand for Pakistan cricket and a knight in shining armour for a struggling team, but he has not been without his flaws. For one, he lacks the ability to rotate the strike when building an innings. This flaw has been less obvious because the skipper has invariably come in during a crisis. However, he has often hurt the momentum after the team has been off to a good start, dragging the run rate down. What’s more, his defensive style has sometimes created needless pressure on the other batsmen, especially when chasing a score. While Misbah is proud of reaching the quarter-finals, let’s be honest, the nature of the tournament certainly played a part in getting us there in spite of Pakistan’s awful performances against India, the West Indies, and Zimbabwe. Perhaps our knockout opponents would have been easier adversaries than the eventual finalists Australia had management not adopted a safety first attitude. In the game against West Indies, seven batsmen (eight, if you count Shahid Afridi) were played. Fawad Alam a leading scorer was ignored, while Younus Khan who has a poor ODI record, and newcomer Haris Sohail, whose limitations were exposed in Australia, were inexplicably selected. Meanwhile, Yasir Shah, possibly the best spinner in the tournament was neglected – except for a game against the world’s best players of spin – while South Africa utilised Imran Tahir. The short term mentality was also exposed when the injury prone Muhammad Irfan, Pakistan’s primary weapon, was not given the rest he deserved against the UAE. Management was so afraid of defeat that the big fast bowler was cut open like the goose that laid golden eggs. To make matters worse, Nasir Jamshed, who was picked by management against the wishes of selectors, was given far too many chances. Certainly, our tournament would have been easier with Sarfraz Ahmed opening the batting early in the World Cup. You can’t say that these mistakes are only obvious after they happened. Like countless others, I had called for Sarfraz to open, Yasir and Fawad to play every game, Younus to be dropped, Irfan to be rested against the UAE match, before management made the mistakes. While these selection issues were clearly the fault of captain and coach, of course, the majority of the blame lies with the Pakistani batsmen, who showed both a lack of skill and temperament for international cricket. At the very least, Misbah, as the batsman, was fighting for the nation in every game, as he always has. But the skipper has taken Pakistan as far as he can within the limitations of his abilities and cautious mind-set. As captain, he rescued a side recovering from dark controversies, and has certainly boasted some fantastic victories in Test cricket. But while his style has kept the ODI cricket team from hitting rock bottom, it is now clear that he can never reach the top of the mountain either. In an age where teams are scoring 350 runs a match, his cautious approach towards batting and team composition are archaic at best. This is exactly why the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) should have ignored Misbah’s suggestion of selecting Azhar as the new ODI captain. Often, though not always, a captain’s playing style is an extension of their mindset. For example, Imran Khan was both an aggressive all-rounder and an aggressive leader. Similarly, Wasim Akram was an attacking skipper. Javed Miandad was a shrewd batsman, and a wise vice-captain. It is for this reason that Azhar seems like the wrong man to take Pakistan’s ODI team forward. I can see why Misbah has recommended him – it is the same reason he persisted with a defensive player like Asad Shafiq in the ODI team, because he reminds Misbah of himself. Certainly, Azhar seems to have a giant heart and is batsman who does not get dismissed so easily, but he carries the exact same flaws as Misbah, except that they are far worse in Azhar, like a terminal disease. If Misbah has trouble rotating the strike, then Azhar seems completely incapable. In fact, Azhar only operates on first or fourth gear. Whereas Test cricket is a game of more deliberately paced batting, most modern batsmen bat with a strike rate of at least 50. Azhar, on the other hand, bats at 39.56. There are few things as exciting as watching Azhar play a Test innings. Watching paint dry is one of them. Observing the ceiling fan rotate slowly for a few hours is another. Yes, everything we don’t like about Misbah, we really won’t like about Azhar. He is like a bad Misbah impersonator; a Misbah clone with second-hand parts. A Mini-Me of Misbah, if you will. Now is the time to upgrade our operating system, not install a pirated copy of Misbah 2.0. Selecting Azhar is like slapping on a band-aid when the wound has healed. Our broken leg has mended. It’s not time for another crutch; it’s time to learn how to run again. https://twitter.com/Asif_Farooqi/status/581790041887797248 Here, I have come up with a list of candidates who would be better options than Azhar: 1. Wahab Riaz [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"550\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] The tears flowing from his eyes showed how much World Cup glory had meant to him. Similar emotions were written on the South African cricketers’ faces after they lost to New Zealand. On the other hand, players such as Younus and Afridi were all grins after crashing out. We need a player who truly loves playing for Pakistan, and Wahab seems like the man. The fact that he’s an aggressive bowler would also be a welcome change in leadership. 2. Sarfraz Ahmed [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"550\"] Photo: Reuters[/caption] He seems like a natural choice, having captained Pakistan to U19 glory. Sarfaraz is an attacking player who has the mental toughness for the job. In fact, this choice seems almost too natural for the PCB, and we know how easily they miss a target when it is staring straight at them. 3. Fawad Alam [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"550\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] He is perhaps the best limited overs batsman in Pakistan and has loads of experience captaining at domestic level. My only concern is the state of his mental wellbeing. Fawad is the Cinderella of Pakistan cricket; stuck in the attic while his ugly stepsisters enjoy the limelight. He’ll need to be groomed if he is made skipper. And by groomed, I mean a shave and a haircut. 4. ZaidAliT [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"550\"] Photo: ZaidAliT Facebook page[/caption] This young Pakistan comedian may steal some of his jokes, but at least he has the common sense to steal the good ones. On the other hand, Azhar looks to have borrowed only Misbah’s shortcomings. 5. Ayyan Ali [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"550\"] Photo: Lahoripoint.com[/caption] Look, she may not be very bright, but she has made some dangerous friends and tried something quite daring, illegal as it was. Although it may seem physically impossible, she certainly seems to have greater testicular fortitude than some Pakistani cricketers.\n\n↧\n\nOut with the field umpires, in with the technology\n\nTechnology should replace field umpires in cricket. This is not just an idea, it is a proposal. In 1992, when the concept of a neutral umpire was introduced in cricket, it was unanimous and a need of the time. Indeed, it was a turning point in the history of cricket as before the concept of neutral umpires, there had been controversies in every other match, especially in matches between rivals playing on their home grounds. Pakistan’s skipper, Imran Khan, realised that neutral umpires can play a significant role in gaining the trust of cricket players and fans and both the teams would accept the decision without any problem. But that era is now over. Today we see many controversial decisions by field umpires which, most of the time, affect the game’s overall result. In a recent World Cup match, between India and Bangladesh, Indian player Rohit Sharma was not dismissed on the basis of the field umpire declaring it a no-ball. This incident deeply hurt the feelings of Bangladeshi fans and I feel that such an error could have been avoided if they had used Hawk-Eye technology. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"567\"] Rohit Sharma hits out during his potentially match-winning innings of 137 for India at the MCG. Photo: AFP[/caption] I remember what I, and other Pakistani fans, went through went Umar Akmal was declared out by the field umpire during the India and Pakistan match. If only it had been referred to the third umpire or if Hot Spot technology had been used, the decision would have been different. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"533\"] India's players celebrate the dismissal of Umar Akmal (R) during the Pool B 2015 Cricket World Cup match between India and Pakistan at the Adelaide Oval on February 15, 2015. Photo: AFP[/caption] In yet another incident in this World Cup, James Anderson of England was declared run-out in their match against Australia. However, later the ICC accepted that it was an umpiring error and that it shouldn’t have been a wicket. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] James Anderson (L) was wrongly given out. Photo: ABC.net/ Getty images[/caption] These are just a few decisions by field umpires which changed the results of games. My question is, why are these incidents happening when there are so many technologies available now which can be used to diminish these mistakes. To make a case for my proposal, I would like to highlight some of the technologies which are being used today and can provide accuracy to cricketing decisions: 1. Snickometer Originally invented by Allan Plaskett, the Snickometer is used to detect the edges from the bat using a microphone placed near the stumps. It uses the differences between sound frequencies of the ball hitting different surfaces. This technology is used to check if the ball hit the bat or not, for a caught-behind, and bat-pad for Leg-Before Wicket (LBW) appeals. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: The Daily Telegraph[/caption] 2. Hawk-Eye This is one of the most used technologies in cricket, used to judge the trajectory of the ball. It has been used by broadcasters for a long time to help commentators and viewers know if correct decisions were given for LBW appeals. This technology predicts the path of the ball after impact, using a slew of cameras placed around the cricket ground. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"400\"] Photo: ESPN Cricinfo[/caption] 3. Hot Spot Another ball tracking technology used in television, it relies on infrared cameras that detect the heat signature of ball impact. For instance, wherever the ball hits the batsman, the heat signature of that particular spot changes, creating a Hot Spot. It is particularly helpful in judging faint edges and close bat-pad LBW shouts. It is widely appreciated by players for its accuracy but is not a regular part of the ICC's Umpire Decision Review System (UDRS) due to its expensive implementation and sensitive equipment. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: The Telegraph[/caption] 4. LED stumps and bails In the recent cricket World Cup, we saw LED wickets which would light up every time the bails are removed from the wicket. This technology helps in decisions for run out and stump appeals. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: Rediff/ AFP[/caption] Along with the above mentioned technologies, I would like to suggest that there should be a sensor placed along the crease to detect if the bat was on, inside or outside the line. It can help decide run-outs and stump scenarios as well. Similarly, it can be used to see if the bowler's foot was on, inside or outside the line as well. These technologies can surely replace field umpires and fielding team captains should be given the authority to use these technologies whenever it is necessary. And I strongly believe that once field umpires are removed, the cricketing sport will enjoy 100% accuracy and very less chances of error.\n\n↧\n\nJust another ridiculous joint session in the Pakistani Parliament\n\nThey questioned the legitimacy of Parliament. They objected to the transparency and fairness of the general elections in 2013. They protested and resigned, making their return conditional upon the formation of an inquiry commission to probe into the allegations of rigging during the 2013 elections. And they returned to Parliament after the promulgation of an Ordinance establishing that very commission. So what was all the fuss about? Yesterday, during the Parliament’s joint session which was called to discuss the pertinent Saudi-Yemen issue and Pakistan’s role therein, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) legislators returned to the National Assembly after seven whole months. Once again, despite all its vices, Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) proved to be the most, if not the only, democratic party when the opposition leader welcomed PTI and its leader to the house. Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and one very vocal minister from Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) were not so welcoming. Fazlur Rehman has a hate-hate relationship with the PTI and Imran Khan, owing to the latter tapping into his party’s vote bank in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P). His displeasure with PTI’s return to Parliament and consequent elimination of the opportunity to contest for and win by-elections on the seats vacated by PTI was quite obvious. MQM also has a long standing enmity with PTI which can be attributed to PTI’s, and especially Imran’s, occasional bold statements against Altaf Hussain and his party. Legislators from MQM raised the issue of pending resignations tendered by PTI members. It is surprising that MQM could not digest a retraction of resignations, considering how it has become a hobby for their beloved leader. They quoted Article 64 of the Constitution and conveniently overlooked National Assembly’s Rules of Procedure whereby the Speaker can refuse to accept a resignation if satisfied that it was not tendered voluntarily. If a member or members are sitting before the Speaker in the National Assembly, the Speaker need not ask such members if they stand by their resignations or not. If the resignations were not accepted when the members were consistently absent from the house, they cannot be accepted now when they are present. The odd and not so surprising outburst came from the Defence Minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif. Odd because his party claimed to have worked really hard to bring PTI back to Parliament for the “larger interest of democracy” and not so surprising because Asif’s words were pretty much in line with PML-N’s “democratic” trends. They struggled to bring PTI back so that their minister could reciprocate Imran’s verbal aggression? Was it a move to bring the enemy on your turf and then hit him where it hurts? I am sure this was not the case, but Mr Minister sure made it seem like that. Asif questioned why PTI members, and especially Imran, were sitting in the same Parliament they had previously termed as bogus and illegitimate, and accused it of coming into power through rigging. It is again not so surprising that a PML-N senior member has assumed that formation of a judicial commission implies Imran’s retraction of rigging allegations. If PTI has fought for a probe into the rigging allegations, and that probe is under way, why would they accept Parliament as legitimate before the findings of the commission? Asif’s fiery speech, which was anything but parliamentary, has apparently been lauded on social media. It seems to have satisfied the appetite for vengeance that PML-N supporters sought on PTI for having verbally ridiculed them and their leadership for months. Sitting on treasury benches and being a minister calls for some responsibility. It is not like Imran’s onslaught has not been responded to by PML-N on various forums. But to choose to vent out your anger in Parliament, in a joint session with an agenda so important, was extremely immature and irresponsible. PTI, very appropriately, did not reciprocate. Imran obviously did not expect a warm reception with garlands. He made his return to Parliament conditional upon the formation of a judicial commission; he had on many occasions resolved never to sit in a fake and bogus Parliament. But the recently signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) and the forfeiture of more than one demand therein, foretells PTI’s future stance. The MoU favours PML-N more than it does PTI. It may just be a face saving opportunity for Imran and his party. Having realised the futility of his protests, Imran might just have agreed to wait his turn. Political victory is not only evident in the MoU clauses but also in PML-N blatantly allowing its minister to hit PTI when it’s down. Imran returned to Parliament because he knows what fruits a toothless commission will bear, and also because he does not want to stay out of the assemblies till the next general elections – and maybe, just maybe, because he has been assured that steps will be taken towards electoral reforms, ensuring that the next elections will be free, fair and transparent. The joint session was, however, more about petty political score settling than deciding the fate of our future foreign policy. Yesterday’s session gave credence to the rumoured assertion that decisions on foreign and defence policies are now being taken elsewhere, while politicians are allowed to play around during their sessions and meetings. As we saw, they did not take any decisions, they only played.\n\n↧\n\nFrom Imran Khan to Steve Waugh, cricket’s five best captains remembered\n\nMichael Clarke made it to the list of illustrious players who captained their team to a World Cup triumph. There is no denying that captains in cricket are very significant, because they make all the strategies and they have to manoeuvre their men like pieces on a chessboard. Nevertheless, captains have been very influential in winning World Cup tournaments for their sides. Let’s look at the five best captains in cricket history who have helped their national teams win the grand trophy. These captains are determined on the basis of their leadership ability, the resources they possessed, and the legacy they left behind. 1. Imran Khan [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] Imran Khan was a very aggressive and intelligent captain who led from the front. He is, without a doubt, Pakistan’s best captain. He took an average team and transformed them into world champions. Under Imran’s captaincy, Pakistan recorded their first ever Test series win against India, England and a drawn series against West Indies. During the 1987 World Cup, the Pakistani cricket team under Imran was a favourite amongst the audience, but they eventually lost to the actual champions, Australia, in the semi-finals. After the 1987 World Cup, Imran announced his retirement from cricket. But in 1988, due to popular demand, he was asked to come back and lead the Pakistani side again. Finally, at the end of his career in 1992, he was able to fulfil his lifelong dream and won Pakistan it’s only World cup. A campaign that started poorly and was nearly at the brink of elimination, made a comeback due to Imran’s leadership and belief and Pakistan won the World Cup, which was a perfect farewell to him. 2. Mahendra Singh Dhoni [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"595\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] Presently, Dhoni is the best captain in modern day cricket. Dhoni has been responsible for changing the face of Indian cricket. He started playing sports as a goal-keeper for his school football team but later became a wicket keeper-cum-batsman for his local team, and finally, he transitioned to become India’s greatest captain. Furthermore, under Dhoni’s captaincy, the Indian team has won all major trophies – which include the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup and the 2011 ICC World Cup. His defiance and brilliant leadership skills led India to their second World Cup victory, and in the final, Dhoni played a tremendous unbeaten innings and became ‘Man of the Match’. It was under his captaincy that India climbed to the number one spot in the ICC Test rankings in 2009. 3. Steve Waugh [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"594\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] Waugh was a fighter. He never gave up and was responsible for taking the Australian cricket team to unprecedented heights. Waugh was part of two World Cup winning teams, in 1987 and 1999. As a captain, he transformed the Australian side into one of the best teams in the history of cricket. He shaped the Australian team into a ruthless side, winning a record 16 Tests on the trot. His greatest achievement was conquering the World Cup in 1999, where the Australians witnessed a poor start to the tournament, losing two out of three matches, which meant that the Aussies had to win seven consecutive matches to win the World Cup – a feat which they managed to achieve brilliantly. Waugh’s awe-inspiring performance came during the crucial super six-match against South Africa, during which he scored a brilliant unbeaten century to take Australia to the next round, and eventually winning the tournament. 4. Allan Border [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"592\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] Border was not a natural captain; he took over the Australian team while it was undergoing extremely difficult times, since their best players, such as Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh had left the team. His initial tenure as a captain was a very disappointing one, but Australia’s surprising victory in the 1987 World Cup proved to be a turning point and heralded the start of a more prosperous time for their side. Border did not perform much with the bat during the 1987 World Cup, but his tactics throughout the tournament were brilliant while defeating the English team by seven runs in the final. He was responsible for rejuvenating the Australian side into a world class unit. 5. Arjuna Ranatunga [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"595\"] Photo: AFP[/caption] Ranatunga came to be known as a belligerent and intelligent leader, famous for defending his players at all costs. Before the 1996 World Cup, the Sri Lankan team was considered the underdogs, but Ranatunga inspired them to become world champions. Furthermore, Ranatunga was a very innovative and aggressive captain, and his tactic was to attack in the first 15 overs and make use of the field restrictions. Therefore, he decided to open with Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana. This decision resulted in completely changing the image of the Sri Lankan cricket team, since they defeated the cricket giants, Australia, in the final, to lift the 1996 World Cup trophy. While fans have just witnessed an amazing spree of matches during the 2015 ICC World Cup, and have come across some great captains and teams, I felt that it was important to mention these legends and understand that the difference between a good team and a great team is how amazing the captain is. Perhaps the PCB should keep this in mind while choosing Azhar Ali as Pakistan’s captain.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nGame of Thrones Season 6 comes to Pakistan\n\nThere are rumours flying around of production beginning on an Indian version of Game of Thrones (GoT). We let India sneak ahead in the nuclear arms race but we seem to be far ahead of them in the television dramas race. However, this could be a game-changer – to ensure we maintain our advantage we must make our own version of GoT before India! To make the job easier for all prospective producers, I have taken the liberty of casting the Pakistani Game of Thrones. 1. Mahira Khan as Daenerys Targaryen Our latest export to Bollywood is really the only option to play the mother of dragons. We can even pretend Humsafar was a prequel to GoT giving Khaleesi the perfect bechari aurat storyline to justify her wrath. We can also cast Sheheryar Munawar Siddiqui as Khal Drogo to give her company in season one. 2. Fawad Khan as Jon Snow This clearly does not need a description. I can only imagine how long the audition line would be for the role of Ygritte. And no Sonam Kapoor, you can't play Ygritte. 3. The late Maqsood Hassan as Tyrion Lannister He was the only actor in Pakistan who could have done justice to the role of Tyrion Lannister so I am using this space to honour the legacy of the veteran who devoted his life to the stage. 4. Ali Zafar as Jamie Lannister Ali Zafar definitely has the looks to pull off the Kingslayer. 5. Aamina Sheikh as Cersei Lannister We just need to pull out the blonde dye, and censor all the Jamie-Cersei scenes from the series. 6. Nadeem Baig as Tywin Lannister The legend of the film industry completes the Lannister family. 7. Inzamamul Haq as Robert Baratheon The boys played well in the war. He definitely has the beard. 8. Shaan Shahid as Stannis Baratheon Just like Igloo King cone, there can only be one “true” king here too. 9. Osman Khalid Butt as Renly Baratheon Because, why not? 10. Ali Azmat as Lord Varys They might as well be twins. 11. Javed Sheikh as Ned Stark He is the guy you call whenever you need one of these roles so why change that now. 12. Humayun Saeed as Rob Stark Only if he puts his own money into the production – for once people might be celebrating the Red Wedding. 13. Syra Shehroz as Arya Stark She does look like she could be 13. 14. Humaima Malick as Sansa Stark Just a humble request to the Pakistani producers, don't see this as a cue to put an item number in the Pakistani GoT. The girls can act too you know."
