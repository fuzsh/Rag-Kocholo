For proselytizing in Islam in other word, see Dawah. For the album by Wadada Leo Smith, see Tabligh (album).\n\nTablighi Jamaat (Urdu: تبلیغی جماعتlit. 'Society of Preachers',[5][6] also translated as \"propagation party\" or \"preaching party\")[2][3][4] is an international Islamic religious movement[2][3] focuses on exhorting Muslims to be more religiously observant[1] and encouraging fellow members to return to practising their religion as per the Islamic prophet Muhammad,[7] and secondarily give dawah (calling) to non-Muslims.[4] \"One of the most widespread Sunni\" islah (reform)[4] and called \"one of the most influential religious movements in 20th-century Islam,\"[8] the organization is estimated to have between 12 and 80 million adherents worldwide,[1] spread over 150 countries,[3][4][9][10] with the majority living in South Asia.[11][12]\n\nQuick Facts Total population, Founder ...\n\nClose\n\nThe group encourages its followers to undertake short-term preaching missions (khuruj), lasting from a few days to a few months in groups of usually forty days and four months, to preach to Muslims reminding them of \"the core teachings of the Prophet Muhammad\" and encourage them to attend mosque prayers and sermons. Members \"travel, eat, sleep, wash and pray together in the mosques and often observe strict regimens relating to dress and personal grooming\".[1]\n\nEstablished in 1926 by Muhammad Ilyas al-Kandhlawi, in the Mewat region of British India, it has roots in the revivalist tradition of the Deobandi school,[4] and developed as a response to the deterioration of moral values and the neglect of aspects of Islam.[2] The movement aims for the spiritual reformation of Islam by working at the grassroots level.[9][13] The teachings of Tabligh Jamaat are expressed in \"Six Principles\": Kalimah (Declaration of faith), Salah (Prayer), Ilm-o-zikr (Reading and Remembrance), Ikraam-e-Muslim (Respect for Muslims), Ikhlas-e-Niyyat (Sincerity of intention), and Dawat-o-Tableegh (Proselytization).[14]"
