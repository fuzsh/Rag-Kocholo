I said Islam teaches us to love. I don't think BlackZero hates Shoaib Malik or anyone for that matter.\n\nKeep loving, lovers? It's better to love than to hate. We are literally divided in Pakistan because of similar reason which leads to Sunni-Shia, Sindhi-Punjabi...etc. I have understood that no matter what happens, but we can't hate for the sake of unity of Islamic brotherhood even if we put our personal issues aside.\n\nWhat makes you think how i changed? Ask anyone - before 2009, i literally used to criticize anyone particularly Shahid Khan Afridi (some may say criticisms were warranted back then), but as soon as i have changed, i have regretted it big time, and somehow, i was struggling to put like/dislike aside, but i kept praying to Allaah (SWT) and always have asked help from Allaah (SWT) to make me humble, and remove the hatred that is inside my heart. Finally, i have changed. All Praises belong to Allaah (SWT). This literally changed my life. People, my friends, are surprised how i manage to keep my life so simple. I am happy inside as much as i am happy outside.\n\nI have never meant to judge you. You just said keep loving, lovers? Let BlackZero love. LOL\n\nIt's better than anything. I love everyone including Afridi and Younus Khan. Someone may misunderstand me though. It's understandable. Khush Raha kar! Life is too short!\n\n^ Saeed Sohail -\n\nAssalamu Alaikum, Kaisay ho!\n\nI do prefer him over Younus Khan, but Younus Khan will always be world class player to me, after Mohammad Yousuf. Third best thing happened to Pakistan after Inzimam and Yousuf, Alhamdulillah!\n\nI prefer Pietersen, but i never mean to hate Younus Khan though. Both Younus Khan and Afridi are my favorite players. Just because i say Afridi shouldn't play Test, and neither should Younus Khan should - for ODI/T20. That doesn't mean i hate them.\n\nI only say as per cricket perspective.\n\n^ BlackZero\n\nI don't remember BlackZero hating Younus Khan. He does have a point about him - shouldn't be playing in ODI/T20. He does acknowledge that Younus Khan is world class player though. I have read one of his post about Younus Khan. I don't remember when. May Allaah (SWT) forgives me if i am wrong.\n\nTake Care - See You All in this thread at next week, Insha'Allaah!\n\nLast edited: Feb 5, 2012\n\nW63L35\n\nPost of the Week winner\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 6, 2006\n\nRuns\n\n27,044\n\nPost of the Week\n\n9\n\nwhat kind of yaar you are......\n\nnot as good as ...........you & Malik.\n\nBlack Zero\n\nTest Debutant\n\nJoined\n\nDec 10, 2009\n\nRuns\n\n13,922\n\nMay be moyo was upset because a world class batsman was sitting at home whilst jokers like Malik were in the team he was leading.\n\nI am trying again\n\nMoYo said:\n\n- after he was sacked (unofficially)\n\n- while in Pakistan\n\n- On Pakistan TV\n\nThat YK chickened-out\n\nand on PP we had a great time then!\n\nBlack Zero\n\nTest Debutant\n\nJoined\n\nDec 10, 2009\n\nRuns\n\n13,922\n\nYou keeps getting kicks over Sialkot whilst we will celebrate a clean sweep against the #1 team,\n\nif i recall correctly, didn't you say 3rd match vs SL (in SL) a dead rubber as series was already decided?\n\n(my point was that Malik saved us and YK the white wash)\n\ndoing a clean sweep is precious then saving from a clean sweep should be even more precious.\n\nBlack Zero\n\nTest Debutant\n\nJoined\n\nDec 10, 2009\n\nRuns\n\n13,922\n\nChances based on what?

He can replace Younis khan in odi's and can be in the test squad for bench strength and be back once the seniors start to retire. At the moment the one day side is full of one paced players (hafeez only looks agressive but has the strike rate of 74 after his return) Imran farhat(the less said the bettet , asad ,misbah , younis are all one paced players. Umar Akmal is the only reliable (only just) aggressor and after him it is all hit and miss.

You wished Pakistan would lose in the world cup. Again you wish Pakistan to lose so we realise the value of Malik.\n\nBet Malik doesn't feel anything about losing $150K. If you have to give credit to the man, he's always stated and displayed his willingness and eagerness to play in the pakistan team (when he was dropped from the ODI side, he went to domestic and really worked hard to earn his place back in the team. Was very commendable, some may have just given up or content with churning out just average performances). Bet the guy's thrilled just being part of the international side/squad again and that he has another chance to prove himself. Personally I don't think he should be given another chance now, he was given chances he's failed and we should try out others. But I do like the fact he's still trying to get back into the international side, time is on his side, and that's how things should be, it keeps things competitive.\n\nSometimes I feel you're putting Malik in a bad light with your support. Malik recognises and publically stated he didn't perform up to the mark when he's not done well (while you argue every innings of 20 something is matchwinning when it comes to malik, but not other players). He's stated that he struggles with bouncy pitches and is trying to work on that (which you do't admit, and don't give credit to players who are playing better than malik on bouncy pitches). What's more I don't get the impression that Malik did want Pakistan to lose the world cup at all, and seemed generally interested in Pakistan's efforts despite not playing in it. While you wanted Pakistan to lose. What's more you don't even seem to want to watch matches if Malik's not playing in them.\n\nBet Malik wouldn't received half of the hatful posts towards malik on here, if you'd been a bit more level headed and less fanatical in your support towards malik.\n\nLast edited: Feb 8, 2012\n\nemclub\n\nT20I Debutant\n\nJoined\n\nNov 2, 2010\n\nRuns\n\n6,608\n\nWhen has it ever been Pakistan first for you?
