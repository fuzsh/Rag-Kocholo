India\n\nThiruvananthapuram, Dec 27, 2019: The Christmas celebrations in Kerala at some places witnessed some colours of the anti-Citizenship Act protest, but none could take away the merry cheers that the day brings.\n\nKerala has been one of the states at the forefront of the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests. This theme was used by a musical troupe in the St Thomas Marthoma Church in Kozhencherry.\n\nThe group sang Carols in Muslim style and costumes, expressing solidarity with the Muslim community, who have been protesting against the CAA and the National Citizen Register (NRC).\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, Churches across the state were crowded as young and old waited patiently for the Christmas wine and cake.\n\nThe devout Christians across the various sections in the Christian community, while observing a holy lent by giving up all non-vegetarian dishes for 25 days, ended the lent when the wine was poured into their mouth by the priests conducting the mass.\n\nThe wine was followed by a piece of cake, after which a sumptuous breakfast is relished.\n\nThe traditional Syrian Christian breakfast includes, appom, stew (chicken or mutton) fish molly, duck, beef, egg roast and steamed banana.\n\nOne change from the yesteryears is with the fresh toddy, which when added to the rice dough, gives the appom a unique taste. However, toddy has become a scarce commodity and, today most homes use the yeast today.\n\nIn some homes, the lunch is the major meal and unlike the traditional “Onam Sadya” which is always eaten from a plantain leaf, the Christmas lunch is eaten from the plate.\n\nThe menu includes varieties of fish and meat and of late, in some homes it is the mouth watering “biriyani” or fried rice.\n\nWith Christmas now turning more a less a secular event, it”s the bakeries which make the biggest killing as presenting a Christmas cake among friends and relatives, has become the order of the day.\n\nAnd cakes, especially the ones coated with icing sugar costs anything from Rs 600 upwards and the most exquisite ones cost as high as Rs 2,500 per kg.\n\nChristians in Kerala number around 62 lakh of the 3.34 crores population.\n\nhttps://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/anticaa-carols-mark-christmas-in-kerala/1693742\n\nhttp://mattersindia.com/2019/12/anti-caa-carols-mark-christmas-in-kerala/\n\n------\n\nCAA coupled with NRC could affect the condition of Muslim minority, says US Congress think tank\n\nDecember 27, 2019\n\nThe amended Citizenship law along with a National Register of Citizens (NRC) being planned by the Narendra Modi government \"may affect the status\" of Muslim minority in India, a report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) has said.\n\nThe December 18 report also said that for the first time in independent India's history, a religious criterion has been added to the country's naturalization process.\n\nThe CRS is an independent research wing of the US Congress which prepares reports periodically on issues of domestic and global importance for the lawmakers to take informed decision. These are not considered as official reports of the US Congress.\"In tandem with a National Register of Citizens (NRC) planned by the federal government, the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) may affect the status of India's large Muslim minority of roughly 200 million,\" said the CRS in its first ever report on the amended Citizenship law.\n\nAccording to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, non-Muslim refugees who came to India till December 31, 2014, to escape religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan will be given Indian citizenship. Since both houses of Parliament approved amendments to the citizenship law earlier this month, protests - sometimes violent - have taken place across the country during which many protesters have died, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka.\n\n\"India's Citizenship Act of 1955 prohibited illegal immigrants from becoming citizens. Among numerous amendments to the act since 1955, none contained a religious aspect,\" the CRS said in its two-page report. The changes sparked significant controversy, including large-scale and sometimes violent protests. Opponents of the CAA warn that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are pursuing a Hindu majoritarian, anti-Muslim agenda that threatens India's status as an officially secular republic and violates international human rights norms, it said.\n\nThe CRS claims that the amendment's key provisions allowing immigrants of six religions from three countries a path to citizenship while excluding Muslims may violate certain Articles of the Indian Constitution, in particular Articles 14 and 15. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act was immediately challenged in the Supreme Court by scores of petitioners, but the court has refused to issue a stay on implementation and is deferring hearing petitions until January 22, it notes, adding that the government argues that the three specified countries have a state religion -- Islam -- resulting in persecution of religious minorities.\n\n\"Proponents say that Muslims do not face persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh, or Afghanistan, and that the CAA is constitutional because it addresses migrants rather than Indian citizens,\" it said.\n\n\"Yet it is not clear why migrants from other neighbouring countries with state (or favoured) religions, such as Sri Lanka (where Buddhism is the official religion and Tamil Hindus face persecution) and Burma (where Buddhism enjoys primacy and Rohingya Muslims are persecuted), are excluded from a path to citizenship. In addition, oppressed Muslim minority communities such as Pakistan's Ahmadis and Shias enjoy no protection under the CAA,\" the CRS said. \"The New Delhi government maintains that the NRC update is a fair and non-discriminatory process driven by the Supreme Court that does not impose a religious test or render any persons 'stateless',\" it said adding that the United Nations, the US Commission for International Religious Freedom, and independent human rights groups have expressed concerns about NRC\n\nhttps://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/caa-coupled-with-nrc-could-affect-the-condition-of-muslim-minority-says-us-congress-think-tank/story/392683.html\n\n------\n\nViral tweet showing request for all-Muslim restaurant in Bali sparks debate on open-mindedness\n\nDec 27, 2019\n\nIndonesians are no stranger to debates surrounding the issue of halal certification, which seems to be increasingly common over the past few years. While determining whether food is permissible for consumption by Muslims is one thing, a recent viral tweet brings to light how some people, while on a trip to Bali, seem to have taken the idea way too far.\n\nLast Sunday, Twitter user @vabyo shared a screenshot of his message exchange in which a friend is asking for a rather disconcerting restaurant recommendation.\n\n“Vabyo, are you in Ubud? I’m taking some people with me … [they’re] a bit fussy. Is there a halal restaurant where all the staff and customers are Muslims?” the friend wrote.\n\nThe user, whose real name is Valiant Budi Yogi, gave the unidentified friend a cheeky reply: “There is, head on to Ngurah Rai and buy a ticket home.”\n\nEver the space for controversial debates, the tweet went viral on the Indonesian twitterverse, with over 6,000 retweets and 5,500 likes at the time of writing. It garnered a multitude of reaction from netizens, many of whom criticized the questionable request.\n\n“Religions are supposed to ease, not complicate [things],” one user wrote.\n\n“Here’s the thing, not all food in Bali contain pork. There are many Javanese dishes sold by Javanese people. Or Balinese who sells chicken dishes. I’m so frustrated with these types of tourists who fuss over food. If you are concerned with whether certain meals are halal or haram, maybe it’s better you stay home.”\n\n“Maybe they should be recommended to travel to Aceh.”\n\nBali is currently swarming with many tourists from all over Muslim-majority Indonesia, what with this being the holiday season and all. The Island of the Gods, of course, is certainly used to accommodating a diverse array of tourists, which is why it bothered Budi so much to see such a religiously exclusive request.\n\n“I think the request is just too much. Bali has always been friendly to all kinds of tourists, especially Muslims. When Nyepi coincided with Eid al-Fitr, we were allowed to leave our homes for Eid prayer. Mosques? They have it. Halal restaurants? They have it,” Budi told Coconuts.\n\n“A halal restaurant with an all-Muslim staff? We can certainly look for one, but why is that necessary? A halal restaurant with an all-Muslim staff and customers? Why, this is completely uncalled for; why must it be so exclusive?”\n\nBudi said he is from Bandung, West Java but has been living in Bali for five years. He said the interaction has prompted him to contemplate on how much tourism should influence the local way of life.\n\n“Ten years ago, I worked at a café in Saudi Arabia, where the staff are non-Muslims and the customers are expatriates whose religions are not known – maybe they don’t even adhere to any religion,” Budi said, drawing a connection from his experience in the birth country of Islam.\n\nBudi, who is a Muslim himself, hopes that the tweet going viral will encourage people to be more open-minded and respectful to others.\n\nThough around 90 percent of Indonesians identify as Muslims, the fourth most populous country in the world is home to other religions as well. Indonesia’s constitution guarantees freedom of religion and the government officially recognizes six religions: Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism.\n\nBali, of course, is a Hindu-majority province, where Hindus make up more than 80 percent of the province’s population. However, as anyone who’s lived in Bali knows – it’s not hard to find a mosque or a halal restaurant on the island, especially in touristy areas.\n\n“Hopefully, whatever religion we practice, we would be willing to socialize and mingle with all kinds of people, so we can be more understanding and respectful,” Budi said.\n\nhttps://coconuts.co/bali/news/viral-tweet-showing-request-for-all-muslim-restaurant-in-bali-sparks-debate-on-open-mindedness/\n\n------\n\nRiyadh Plans Organisation Of Islamic Cooperation Fms Meeting On Kashmir\n\nBaqir Sajjad Syed\n\nDecember 27, 2019\n\nISLAMABAD: Saudi Arabia is planning to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) for a discussion on the situation in Indian-occupied Kashmir, according to a diplomatic source.\n\nThis was conveyed by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud during a meeting with Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi at the Foreign Office.\n\nPrince Faisal was on a day-long visit to Pakistan to convey the Saudi leadership’s gratitude for not participating in the recently held Kuala Lumpur summit in view of the kingdom’s reservations and dispelling the impression that Riyadh’s attitude towards Islamabad was patronising.\n\nPrince Faisal also called on Prime Minister Imran Khan. The meeting was also attended by Foreign Minister Qureshi, Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood, ISI Director General Lt Gen Faiz Hameed and other senior officials.\n\nSaudi foreign minister meets Imran and Qureshi, describes relations with Pakistan as ‘fraternal and strategic’\n\nThe KL summit had found strong support in Pakistan because of Saudi Arabia’s growing trade ties with India and OIC’s failure to take strong stance on Muslim causes.\n\n“The two foreign ministers discussed OIC’s role in the advancement of the cause of Kashmir,” the FO said in a statement. Mr Qureshi briefed Mr Saud on the situation in occupied Kashmir in the aftermath of India’s Aug 5 move to annex the disputed region and the developing humanitarian crisis there.\n\nHe also spoke about the Indian government’s Hindu nationalist agenda as manifested by the recently enacted Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens and the systematic targeting of minorities in India, particularly Muslims.\n\nPM Khan, meanwhile in his meeting with the Saudi foreign minister, said that ceasefire violations by India along the LoC were stoking tensions and imperiling regional peace and security. He urged the international community to play its role in ensuring respect for the rights and freedom of the Kashmiri people, facilitating a just solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute and taking steps for the protection of minorities in India.\n\nThe Saudi foreign minister described relations with Pakistan as “fraternal and strategic” and conveyed the Saudi leadership’s appreciation for “the role played by Pakistan in maintaining regional peace and stability”. He reaffirmed the Saudi support for issues of core interest for Pakistan and desire for cementing ties with Pakistan in all fields.\n\nMr Saud said Riyadh remained committed to “core relationship” between the two countries and would further deepen the multi-faceted cooperation between the two countries.\n\nAccording to the FO statement, Mr Qureshi, during his conversation, underscored the significance of bilateral trade and economic cooperation, security and defence cooperation, parliamentary exchanges and increased trade relations for strengthening the bilateral ties. He recalled Saudi investments, particularly in the petrochemical, mining and minerals and energy sectors, and asked for expanding the Road-to-Makkah project to other cities of Pakistan for facilitating greater number of pilgrims.\n\nRoad-to-Makkah is a pre-departure immigration facility, which is currently available at Islamabad International Airport, as a pilot project for easing arrival procedures for the pilgrims.\n\nPrime Minister Khan, meanwhile, reminded about the Saudi commitment for investment in various sectors, particularly petrochemical, mining and renewable energy, and hoped that the Saudi team for development of the tourism sector would visit Pakistan soon.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammad bin Salman had during PM Khan’s recent visit to Saudi Arabia promised to assist in development of Pakistan’s tourism sector.\n\nhttps://www.dawn.com/news/1524607/riyadh-plans-oic-fms-meeting-on-kashmir\n\n------\n\nYoung Muslims conduct winter campaign to help vulnerable in South Yorkshire over the festive season\n\nBy Alana Roberts\n\nThursday, 26th December 2019\n\nThe volunteers from the Ahmadiyya Muslim Muslim Youth Association (AMYA) organised various hospital and care home visits, a meal sharing session with the homeless and a free taxi service for the elderly on Christmas Day to spread the festive cheer to those living in both Sheffield and Rotherham this holiday season.\n\nOver 50 members of the AMYA South Yorkshire branch visited Hallamshire Care Home and Heeley Bank Care Home, in Sheffield, as well as Broom Lane Care Home, in Rotherham, to meet with over 100 residents and distribute gifts as well as flowers, fruit and chocolate, and Christmas cards.\n\nThe group also took a trip to Sheffield Children’s Hospital, the Northern General Hospital and Rotherham General Hospital to hand out toys and chocolates to all the young patients and nurses working on Christmas Eve.\n\nNadeem Ahmad Regional Youth Leader for Yorkshire said: “Islam urges every person to partake in charitable giving, and that even an act of kindness towards another is charity. AMYA has and continues to instil young people with a sense of civil responsibility, and a desire to promote harmony within our local communities.\n\n“Our members have enjoyed living in Yorkshire for decades and so any opportunity to help our local community is a much welcomed one”\n\nApart from the gift giving activities, the young people donated various items to food banks across the region and over 70 food packets were distributed to the homeless in Sheffield as part of the winter seasonal campaign which also saw those living on the streets receive necessities such as sleeping bags and pillows.\n\nThey also responded to the Hallam FM Cash for Kids charity toys appeal by giving 60 toys to the cause which will then be forwarded to those children who may otherwise go without at Christmas.\n\nhttps://www.thestar.co.uk/news/people/young-muslims-conduct-winter-campaign-help-vulnerable-south-yorkshire-over-festive-season-1349408\n\n------\n\nImam Khamenei warns of plot to consign Revolution symbols to oblivion\n\nDecember 26, 2019\n\nAhlulBayt News Agency (ABNA): Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei warned about a hostile and sinister plot to consign the symbols of the Islamic Revolution to oblivion.\n\nIn a Thursday meeting with members of a committee tasked with holding a congress to commemorate martyrs of the southern province of Hormozgan, Ayatollah Khamenei said virtues like courage and defending the righteousness have been institutionalized in the province.\n\n“Commemorating martyrs is a necessary job and a duty of all of us, because a villainous policy and move is underway with the purpose of consigning the symbols of the Revolution, particularly jihad and martyrdom, to oblivion, and such a policy must be countered,” Ayatollah Khamenei stressed.\n\nMartyrs, regardless of their age or education, are symbols of devotion and preparedness to sacrifice their lives for defending the truth, the Leader added, calling for efforts to familiarize the youth with such precious symbols and role models.\n\nIn December 2018, Ayatollah Khamenei cautioned about the enemy’s plots to damage spiritual values in Iran, saying, “The enemies’ onslaught at the spiritual level is much more dangerous and troubling than the ones at the level of ordinary issues, hard attacks and the like.”\n\nThe Leader underscored, though, that the hostile attempts to damage the spiritual values will end in failure in the same way that the “hard war and hard pressures” against Iran resulted in failure.\n\nIn January 2018, Ayatollah Khamenei warned that the enemies have mobilized all efforts to harm the Islamic Republic, saying the fact is that the enemy has been always seeking to find an opportunity to infiltrate into Iran and harm the Iranian nation.\n\nThe Leader described the Iranian nation’s courage, devotion and faith as the main factors in warding off the hostile moves.\n\nhttps://en.abna24.com/news//imam-khamenei-warns-of-plot-to-consign-revolution-symbols-to-oblivion_996654.html\n\n------\n\nMuslims Would Continue to Fight for their Rights Peacefully, Sultan Assures Nigerians\n\nDecember 27, 2019\n\nSanusi urges Muslims to adopt family planning\n\nKemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nThe Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar, yesterday said Muslims in the country would continue to fight for their rights under the constitution, but would not be provoked to be violent to achieve this.\n\nThe Sultan who spoke at the opening of the 108th Islamic Vocation Course (IVC) organised by the Muslim Students’ Society of Nigeria (MSSN) Zone B held at IVC Permanent Camp, along Lagos-Ibadan expressway, called on Muslims to always be law- abiding.\n\nPresent at the programme, which has as its theme, “The Unification,” include the Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Mr. Rauf Olaniyan; the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Muhammadu Sanusi II; the Resident Electoral Commissioners in Oyo and Ogun state, Mutiu Agboke and Professor Abdulganiy Raji, former and Present Executive Secretary of Muslim Ummah of South West Nigeria (MUSWEN), Prof. Daud Noibi and Prof. Muslih Yahyah.\n\nOthers are Aare Musulumi of Yoruba land, Edo and Delta, Alhaji Daud Makanjuola; Baba Adini of Yoruba land, Edo and Delta, Alhaji Sharafadeen Tunji Ishola; Iya Adini of Yoruba land, Edo and Delta, Alhaja Sekinah Adekola; National President (Amir) of MSSN, Dr. Taofeek Yekeen; MSSN Zone B Amir, Qaasim Odedeji and Chairman, Muslim Community of Oyo State, Alhaji Isiaq Kunle Sanni and Prof. Abideen Olaiya.\n\nWhile throwing his weight behind the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN)’s call for more review of the Shariah laws, the Sultan stated that the rights of Muslims such as wearing of Hijab by women and girls are sacrosanct, urging the Muslim Ummah in the country to always see themselves as agents of unity.\n\nAccording to him, “My appeal to Muslims in the country is that they should not be provoked by any utterances from either any political or religious leaders but continued to be law-abiding. Muslims will not work to divide Nigeria by taking up arms to fight for their rights but should continue to be agents of unity of the country.”\n\nThe Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi, in his own contributions implored Nigerians, especially Muslims to give birth to only the number of children they can cater for.\n\nSanusi while speaking on the array of social problems bedeviling the country, insisted that the issue of Almajri syndrome is not a religious issue but a social issue that needs urgent attention.\n\nWhile maintaining that there is a need to get all out-of -school children back to the school, he maintained that men should imbibe the habit of marrying the number of women they can cater for, urging Nigerians, especially Muslims to give birth to the only children they can cater for.\n\nAccording to him, “If we continued this way, about 40 per cent extremely poor people will be in Nigeria. It is 20 per cent in the South-west, North it is 80 per cent, Lagos is eight per cent and Zamfara, it is 91 per cent.\n\n“We have been talking about Almajri for over 30 years. Why are people having family that they cannot maintain? Why are people marrying wife that they cannot maintain? The condition is that you are able to provide for your family.\n\n“Instead of having many children, why not having the ones you can cater for? These are the fundamental questions we should ask ourselves.”\n\nMost of these children roaming about the streets will be adult in the next 20 years and they will be the ones they will recruit as political thugs by the politicians if we don’t take good care of them now.\n\n“This is my own advice that we must look at. These are not religion; they are social issues that need to be addressed”.\n\nhttps://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2019/12/27/muslims-would-continue-to-fight-for-their-rights-peacefully-sultan-assures-nigerians/\n\n------\n\nChristchurch mosque attack: NZ Police treat young victims to adventure holiday\n\nSarah Templeton\n\nA group of young men impacted by the March 15 Christchurch terror attack have been treated to an adventure holiday up north, including zorbing, luging and a day out at Rainbow's End.\n\nThe group of 20 teens, aged between 12 and 18, were either worshipping at the Christchurch mosques when they were attacked, or lost family and friends in the shooting.\n\nEarlier this month they enjoyed an adventure holiday in Auckland, Rotorua and Taupō, organised by Christchurch Police, Muslim youth workers and police charity Blue Light.\n\nThe boys played mini-golf in Auckland before being hosted by the south Auckland Mosque Masjid Al Mustafa. They visited SkyCity then headed to Rotorua and Taupō, where they went zorbing, luging, visited the Tāmaki Māori Village, whitewater rafting, mountain biking and jet boating.\n\nThe trip ended in Auckland with a day out at Rainbow's End theme park and a visit to the Counties Manukau police hub.\n\n\"Many of the boys have never been out of Christchurch and we wanted to give them a fun week away in the North Island, creating new, positive memories,\" says Const Bruce Ward, who was behind the trip.\n\n\"This trip was a chance to build relationships with police and for us to give something special back.

A continuous discussion must take place,” the Bombay archbishop told friends and well-wishers who on December 24 greeted him on his 75th birthday.\n\nCardinal Gracias, president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India and an adviser of Pope Francis, says he is “very keen” on inter-religious dialogue between people of different faiths. “This will knock off any prejudices and eventually help to understand and appreciate each other. I want the Catholic community to be at the forefront of this… to build bridges,” he added.\n\nThe Indian Church leader termed the love for the nation as an important trait of citizens. “If we truly feel strongly about India, then we must work for the country, to the point of being ready to sacrifice for it,” the cardinal asserted.\n\nTo foster patriotism, the cardinal suggests people engage in reflection and exchange of ideas. “Reading and knowing the thoughts of others helps one’s own thoughts to mature and conceptualize a better India, in which everyone is like one big family. This is what should be our priority,” Cardinal Gracias explained.\n\nHe urged students protesting against the CAA to come forward and discuss their difficulties with the authorities. “The government should be willing to engage. The government wants a better India, and if after reflection, they feel that they have made some mistake, then there is no harm in backtracking. We need to look at the larger picture,” he added.\n\nThe cardinal celebrated his birthday at the Archbishop’s House in Colaba amid followers, friends, well-wishers and parishioners.\n\nAfter the blessing ceremony in the courtyard at 12 noon, some friends of the cardinalsaid a few words inside the main hall. This was followed by a chorus of “Happy birthday to you” while the cardinal cut the cake, and some fun activities and games between staffers.\n\nSpeaking to Mid-Day amid the celebrations, Cardinal Gracias stressed the importance of having an inter-religious dialogue, and the responsibilities that come with being “men of service.”\n\n“I have held multiple offices (he is also the president of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India) and I have realized that it is important to be men of service and have faith in God, no matter which religion you belong to,” he said.\n\n“There are many challenges…in some circumstances, one might be pressured to do the wrong thing, but in these cases, it is even more important to do what is right. If you appease people, then you will repent later.”\n\nSource: Mid-Day\n\nhttp://mattersindia.com/2019/12/no-harm-in-backtracking-on-citizenship-law-cardinal-gracias/\n\n------\n\nSikh Family Donates Land for Mosque in Moga Village after Nearly 200-Year-Old Mosque Started Demolished For A Highway Widening Project\n\nDec 27, 2019\n\nBATHINDA: A Sikh family has donated 16 marlas (484 sq yards) of land for the building of a mosque in Machhike village, in Punjab’s Moga district, near the Barnala-Moga highway.\n\nThe village already has a nearly 200-year-old mosque situated right on the edge of the highway, but it is on the verge of being demolished for a highway widening project. The cost of the donated land is estimated at over Rs 8 lakh, with one marla fetching over Rs 50,000 in the village.\n\nOver a year ago, when the highway widening project was launched, Muslim families in Machhike village, under the banner of the Muslim Welfare Society, tried to urge the authorities to spare the mosque at the edge of the highway.\n\nHowever, after structures adjacent to the mosque or those situated almost on the edge of the highway started being demolished, they began to look for an alternative spot for a mosque and even approached the village panchayat, but with no success.\n\nWe were worried for our place of worship. With only 14-15 Muslim families in the village, which has a population of over 7,000, we did not have the resources to purchase land and at the same time did not want to lose the only place of paying obeisance. It is at this point that the family of Darshan Singh came as angels and donated the land to construct a mosque and a dharamsala.” Muslim Welfare Society president Roop Mohammad said.\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/village-mosque-to-make-way-for-road-sikh-family-gives-land-for-a-new-one/articleshow/72987374.cms\n\n------\n\nUP minister refuses to meet Muslim families\n\nDEC 27 2019\n\nAn Uttar Pradesh minister on a visit here on Thursday refused to meet the families of the two Muslim men who died in the recent protests against the new citizenship law, terming them “upadravi” (vandals).\n\n“Why should I go to vandals’ place? How can those who are involved in vandalism and put the entire country and state in arson be social,” minister Kapil Dev Agarwal posed, defending his decision to not visit the homes of the two Muslim families.\n\n“Why should I visit those who want to put Nahtaur/Bijnor in flames?” the minister in-charge of the district shot back when asked by reporters to justify his decision.\n\nCongress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday met the families of those dead in the violence in Bijnor.\n\nWhen a media person confronted the UP minister by asking him specifically whether it did not amount to discrimination, Agarwal retorted saying, “Why should I go to the homes of vandals? Listen to me. Those who are doing vandalism and want to inflame ...\n\nhttps://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-minister-refuses-to-meet-muslim-families-789035.html\n\n------\n\nNo criminal record, no protest, yet Muslim men made to sign bonds in Uttar Pradesh villages\n\nThe clampdown of the Uttar Pradesh police against the Muslim community has now extended to those who have not taken part in the ongoing protests. In three villages located less than 30 km from Lucknow, at least 100 Muslim men have been made to furnish a bond of Rs 50,000 each under Section 107/116 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which virtually serves as an assurance that they will not participate in any protest. They will have to appear in court every fortnight or so for at least the next six months.\n\nThe section is meant to be a preventive measure: it is invoked by an Executive Magistrate against anyone under his jurisdiction who could pose a reasonable threat to the peace. He is supposed to do this after receiving information and forming an opinion that there is substantial ground for proceeding against the individual. Its invocation on a mass scale against those who have never violated the law in the past has come as a shock to the residents of these villages.\n\n“Please don’t reveal our names but can you find out why the Muslims of this village are being treated like criminals,” asked a man in his early twenties, a resident of Kamlabad Badhauli vllage, who has been made to furnish a bond. He is preparing for the state public service commission exams. He pointed to a picture of the former governor of Uttar Pradesh, Ram Naik, awarding honours to his elder brother, a university topper – the brother too has been charged.\n\nIt is yet unclear how widespread the application of this section has been against the rural Muslim population of the state.\n\nNo one spared, from old to young\n\nIn the village of Kamlabad Badhauli, 20 km from Lucknow, it was bitterly cold at 7 pm on Thursday. A group of men sat huddled around the fire, too scared to speak to a journalist, yet desperate to be heard.\n\nAmong them were daily wagers, educated youth preparing for various entrance exams, a man employed in a shoe shop, two old men nearing seventy, and a young boy. All of them had been served notices under Section 107/116 of the CrPC. Thirty-seven men from 20 of the 25 Muslim families in the village had been issued these notices, in some cases all the male members of a family.\n\nThe residents of Kamlabad Badhauli told Scroll.in that on December 19, even as protests broke out in Lucknow to be followed by a brutal police crackdown, the day passed off normally in the village. No one from the village had gone for the protests, at least none of the 37 who have been served notices.\n\nAccording to them, the first they heard of these notices was when on December 23, Vishnu Kumar, a chowkidar, was ordered by the local police station to go door to door with a list of names and addresses of the men charged under Section 107/116 of CrPC. They were asked to sign against their names but none of them realised what had transpired until December 26 when they were told they had to appear in court. It is then that they consulted a lawyer.\n\nTo make matters worse, it is not clear whether these charges will result in a criminal record being entered against their name. For many of the young men preparing for examinations and looking for government jobs, this has become an additional source of anxiety.\n\nWhile charges under preventive sections do not amount to a conviction, and ordinarily should not amount to a criminal record, there are conflicting legal opinions about this. A judgement of the Chhattisgarh High Court has held that proceedings under Section 107 of CrPC make a person unfit for government employment.\n\nEven without a criminal record, the men who have been served notices as potential troublemakers could become easy suspects, even fodder, for the next time the police wanted to pick up anyone for any perceived crime or breach of peace, said a lawyer.\n\nWorse, notices under Section 107 of the Criminal Procedure Code allow a magistrate to order the arrest of an individual if he is convinced that only an arrest could avoid breach of peace. In the past, the Supreme Court and several High Courts have admonished the police for keeping people in jail for months using Section 107 and without registering any criminal case.\n\n‘Marked for life’\n\nAt Chatta Meel Chauraha, a market at a crossroad near the village, most of the hand-cart vendors and shopkeepers had also been served the same notice. Two brothers who for the past 20 years have been selling peanuts from their make-shift stall broke down as they recounted how they had to spend the whole day in court. “We barely earn enough to feed our families, how will we fight cases?” they asked.\n\nThe young man who was preparing for the state public service commission exams said other than him and his elder brother, two other men from their family have also been charged. The youngest of them will turn eighteen next month.\n\n“They haven’t arrested us or beaten us, and they couldn’t recover damages from us, but they have marked us for life,” he said. “All of us will have a criminal record for no other reason that being Muslim.”\n\nThe fear in this village is compounded by bewilderment. The villagers repeatedly pointed out that Kamlabad Badhauli, with its 30% Muslim population, has never seen communal tension.\n\nThe group of Muslim men speaking to this reporter were subsequently joined by two other residents – Himanshu Shukla and Harsh Mishra – who had no fear of their names being cited. They were equally unsure about why this village had been targeted.\n\nShukla said: “Our history is different. There was no trouble over Ayodhya [dispute] and very close to our village at Bakshi ka Talab, the Ramlila always makes news because in it Ram is always played by a Muslim.”\n\nKamlabad Badhauli, though, is not the only village to be targeted. A kilometre away similar stories emerged at Muslim Nagar, a larger Muslim-dominated village. Here, 20 men have been charged under Section 107/116 of the CrPC. Many of them had gathered at a barber shop run by a man in his early thirties. Two of his brothers are also facing the same charges.\n\n“There is no case against any of us,” he said. “On the day of the protests, there is CCTV footage of my brother and I at the electricity board office paying our bills, then we were at the Vodaphone store to sort out our mobile issues. There is a camera there too which would have recorded our visit.”\n\nHe went on to detail the whereabouts of the others in the village who have also been charged: one man who was at the hospital, accompanying his brother for his chemotherapy, another man who was in Bombay, a third who was on duty at the Trauma Centre at KGMC hospital in Lucknow.\n\n“We are innocent, but that’s not the point. We are Muslims and that’s the real issue,” he said in conclusion.\n\n‘Is this revenge?’\n\nThe lawyer representing many of the men in Muslim Nagar, Mayank Shukla, a man in his thirties, said he had grown up with them. “This is the work of mukhbirs (police informants). They have been encouraged by the administration to name Muslims they don’t like,” he said.\n\nShukla did not have any other explanation for the notices but said he would do all he can to defend his childhood friends. Unfortunately, he added, many of them may not be able to save themselves from a “black mark against their name”, which could haunt them all their lives, making it difficult for them to get employment.\n\nAnother four kilometers from Muslim Nagar, at Madhion village, residents said as many as 150 Muslim men had been charged under Section 107/116 of the CrPC. Three Muslim men told Scroll.in that at first they were so terrified that they thought of fleeing the village but then a lawyer in the village told them this would aggravate the charges against them.\n\n“We have no choice but to live with this torture,” one of them, employed as a tailor, said.\n\nScroll.in was able to confirm that the Muslim men in two other villages – Shervani Nagar and Bholapura – had also been charged under the section. However, with both the local police and administration unwilling to provide details of the number of people charged under this section, it was not possible to ascertain how many other villages and residents have been impacted.\n\nAs this reporter turned to leave for Lucknow, one of the men in Muslim Nagar said: “This could destroy our lives forever. Is this the badla [revenge] that the chief minister was talking about?”\n\nhttps://scroll.in/article/947992/no-criminal-record-no-protest-yet-muslim-men-made-to-sign-bonds-in-uttar-pradesh-villages\n\n------\n\n'Videos posted by police have made Muslims insecure\n\nDEC 26 2019\n\nUdupi-Chikmagalur-Hassan Khazi P M Ibrahim Musliyaar Bekal on Thursday said the video clippings, posted on social media by police and telecast on some TV channels, have made Muslims look like terrorists.

conform to Islamic teachings\n\nBy YOSHIKATSU NAKAJIMA\n\nDecember 27, 2019\n\nTwo of the biggest names in Japanese home appliances were awarded what must rank as one of the oddest of halal certifications: for products.\n\nIn guaranteeing that their goods have not come into contact with pork or alcohol, Panasonic Corp. and Sharp Corp. are moving to gain a foothold in the growing, more affluent Muslim market.\n\nBut obtaining the prized credential was no easy feat.\n\nTo get it, the companies must pass screenings to meet strict halal standards that even covered the materials of the gloves worn by workers.\n\nPanasonic obtained certification for its water purifiers and water ionizers for the Malaysian market.\n\nThe company said it was the first Japanese home appliance maker to secure halal certification under the Malaysian government-affiliated system.\n\nSharp also gained certification for its refrigerators manufactured at plants in Indonesia and Thailand last year.\n\nMore than 200 halal certification organizations are said to exist worldwide, yet there are no unified standards for the certification.\n\nThough certification screeners found no problems with Panasonic's home appliance parts at its plant in Hikone, Shiga Prefecture, they asked the company to review certain manufacturing procedures.\n\nTo conform to standards considered halal, “workers must remove their wristwatches because (according to Islamic law) they could be regarded as unpure,” a Panasonic representative said.\n\nThis is done to ensure any traces of pork or alcohol that workers may have come in contact with outside the plant are not transferred to products being manufactured.\n\nPanasonic introduced a halal production line at its Hikone plant and carefully examined the ingredients of gloves and brushes to confirm they were not derived from pork products.\n\nThe company also replaced the plant's cleaning tools and asked staff to wash their hands seven times a day to abide by Islamic law, using a halal cleaning agent.\n\nIn November, Panasonic started shipping alkaline ionized water conditioners and water purifiers with halal labels to Malaysia, where Muslims account for two-thirds of the population, and local consumers have become more health-conscious.\n\nPanasonic does brisk sales among Malaysia's non-Muslim population, and is hoping that by tweaking its goods to attract Muslim customers it can double Malaysian sales within five years.\n\nThe move to gain certification by Japanese businesses first spread among restaurant operators to better respond to the recent influx of foreign visitors to Japan.\n\nJapan's medical and cosmetics companies then jumped on the bandwagon, fine-tuning their products toward the Muslim market, making it impossible for electronics makers to ignore the trend as their products dovetail on diet-related issues such as water purifiers and refrigerators.\n\nThe aggressive pursuit of halal certification by

sanctions\n\nDecember 27, 2019\n\nKuala Lumpur\n\nIran, Malaysia, Turkey and Qatar are considering trading among themselves in gold and through a barter system as a hedge against any future economic sanctions on them, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Saturday.\n\nAt the end of an Islamic summit in Malaysia, Mahathir praised Iran and Qatar for withstanding economic embargoes and said it was important for the Muslim world to be self-reliant to face future threats.\n\n“With the world witnessing nations making unilateral decisions to impose such punitive measures, Malaysia and other nations must always bear in mind that it can be imposed on any of us,” Mahathir said.\n\nU.S.-allied Arab states Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar about 2-1/2-years ago over allegations it backs terrorism, a charge Doha denies. Iran, meanwhile, has been hit badly after the United States reimposed sanctions on it last year.\n\n“I have suggested that we re-visit the idea of trading using the gold dinar and barter trade among us,” Mahathir said, referring to the Islamic medieval gold coin.\n\n“We are seriously looking into this and we hope that we will be able to find a mechanism to put it into effect.” The leaders agreed they needed do more business among themselves and trade in each other’s currencies.\n\nThe summit, which was snubbed by Saudi Arabia, was criticized for undermining the Saudi-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which represents 57 Muslim-majority nations. Malaysia said all the OIC members had been invited to the Kuala Lumpur summit but only about 20 showed up.\n\nBy the fourth and final day of the summit, no joint statement had been released. The summit had been expected to discuss major issues affecting Muslims, including Palestine, Kashmir and the plight of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar and China’s camps for Uighur Muslims in its western Xinjiang region.\n\nWithout naming any country, Mahathir said there was concern that Muslims in non-Muslim countries were forced to undergo assimilation.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani, Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Malaysia’s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia’s King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, Malaysia’s Queen Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah, Malaysia’s First Lady Siti Hasmah Mohamad Ali, Turkey’s First Lady Emine Erdogan and Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pose for a photograph during Kuala Lumpur Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia December 19, 2019.\n\nWe support integration but assimilation to the extent of shedding our religion is unacceptable,” he said. At a news conference, he said the summit participants had been told that Uighurs were being detained in China.\n\n“We have to hear the state, we have to hear the people who complain, then only it will be fair,” he said.\n\nHe called India’s new citizenship act unfortunate.

It consists of two rakaah with four rukuk and is followed by a sermon.\"\n\nIn PUTRAJAYA, about 500 worshippers offered the special prayers at the Putra Mosque led by Ustaz Shamsul Bahari Dahalan.\n\nAfter the prayers Shamsul Bahari delivered a sermon entitled 'Discovering the Secrets of the Glory of Allah’ which among others touched on the occurrence of the eclipse as a sign in the greatness of Allah.\n\n\"The solar eclipse serves as a reminder to mankind that we are weak and small before Allah. Observing the eclipse also strengthens our faith and renews our covenant with God,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, several civil servants also took advantage of their lunch break to observe the annular solar eclipse around their offices.\n\nIn JOHOR, about 450 worshippers performed the prayers at the Sultan Abu Bakar Mosque in Johor Bahru.\n\nThe prayers held at 11.50am was led by imam Mohd Zaidi Saman.\n\n\"Alhamdulillah both men and women joined in the prayers which was followed by a sermon enjoining people towards righteousness,” he said.\n\nIn Negeri Sembilan, State Mosque executive imam Ustaz Hazmi Adb Kadir in his sermon said Islam encouraged its followers to continue praising the greatness and power of Allah and that the solar eclipse prayer is in compliance with the command of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH).\n\n“The Prophet (PBUH) had indeed commanded us to hasten in doing good deeds including performing zikir, prayers of supplication, seeking forgiveness and giving charity.\n\n“Avoid sins and disobedience which lead to syirik. Hopefully this eclipse phenomenon will turn you in repentance to Allah, increase your faith and righteous deeds,” he told 200 worshippers after the solar eclipse prayers here today.\n\nIn PERAK, State Mosque chief imam, Abd Farid Salleh led some 500 worshippers in the prayers which was held at the Sultan Idris Shah II Mosque in Ipoh after zuhur prayers.\n\nMembers of the public who observed the partial solar eclipse at Dataran Selera Dato' Sagor here, were provided with frame solar eclipse filters, courtesy of Ungku Omar Polytechnic Civil Engineering students from the Geometric Unit.\n\nIn KANGAR, Perlis mufti Datuk Dr Mohd Asri Zainal Abidin called on Muslims to repent and keep seeking forgiveness from Allah as the rare phenomenon is a sign that the world is coming to an end.\n\nHe delivered the sermon to about 700 worshippers who had gathered to perform the prayers led by Kolej Universiti Islam Perlis (KUIPs) lecturer Sheikh Soleh Abdul Naser, at the Alwi Mosque here.\n\nOver in ALOR SETAR, about 300 worshippers who were at the State Mosque offered the prayers after zuhur led by Zahir Mosque chief imam Mohd Isa Abd Rahman.\n\nMohd Isa in his sermon said, the solar eclipse phenomenon was a time to reflect and thank Allah for HIs greatness and wonderful creation.\n\n“Regard this phenomenon as Allah’s greatness as the solar eclipse has been accurately calculated with the earth, the sun and the moon forming a system,” he said adding that praying during the solar eclipse is a reminder to Muslims that Allah alone has power over all things in the heavens and on earth.\n\nhttp://www.bernama.com/en/general/news.php?id=1802704\n\n------\n\nChina Cables: When will the Muslim world speak up for persecuted Uighurs?\n\nCJ Werleman\n\n26 December 2019\n\nThe China Cables, a trove of more than 400 pages of leaked internal Chinese government documents, prove beyond all doubt that China is working to systematically erase and annihilate millions of ethnic Uighur Muslims - the largest industrial-scale persecution of a religious minority since the Holocaust.\n\nThe revelations have blown an elephant-sized hole in Beijing’s efforts to quell international condemnation with its stubborn denials and perverse propaganda.\n\n'Stronger sense of happiness'\n\nUntil this moment, the international community has been divided into two camps over China’s criminalisation of Islam and detainment of hundreds of thousands of Uighurs in its network of Muslim concentration camps. Western democracies express outrage and Middle Eastern states tacitly approve Beijing’s “counterterrorism measures”, while even praising the Communist Party for its mythical “vocational and training camps”.\n\nBeyond the economic realm, it's likely that authoritarian regimes in the Middle East will remain silent towards China's human rights violations against Uighur Muslims\n\nIn July, more than a dozen Muslim-majority countries - including Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and the United Arab Emirates - co-signed a letter to the United Nations that unconscionably applauded China for bringing a “stronger sense of happiness, fulfillment, and security” to Xinjiang. Qatar has since removed its signature, saying it wants to pursue a “neutral stance”.\n\nBut now that the cloak of plausible deniability has been pulled back, revealing the full gamut of China’s crimes against humanity - including executions, torture, rape, forced indoctrination to atheism, forced family separations, forced marriages, forced adoptions, forced sterilisations, and even credible accusations of live organ-harvesting programmes - how will the Middle East respond?\n\nHow will leaders of Muslim-majority countries, particularly those who boastfully proclaim to be the guardians of Islam and protectors of the Ummah, respond to what is now smoking-gun evidence of Beijing’s efforts to wipe millions of Muslims and scores of mosques off the map in northwestern China?\n\nBusiness as usual\n\nIf the Syrian government’s welcoming of Beijing’s invitation to join its trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative this week is any indication, then it will surely be a case of business as usual for relations between China and other Middle Eastern countries.\n\nIn attempting to secure Chinese investment in Syria’s reconstruction, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has presented Beijing with a number of proposed infrastructure projects.\n\n“We have proposed around six projects to the Chinese government in line with the Belt and Road methodology and we are waiting to hear which project, or projects, is in line with their thinking. I think when this infrastructure is developed, with time, the [Belt and Road Initiative] passing through Syria becomes a foregone conclusion,” Assad told a Chinese television network.\n\nWorkers take down a panel advertising China’s Belt and Road Initiative outside a forum in Beijing on 27 April (AFP)\n\nWorkers take down a panel advertising China’s Belt and Road Initiative outside a forum in Beijing on 27 April (AFP)\n\nGiven that the Assad regime is responsible for the killing of half a million Syrians and the displacement of millions more, turning the last remaining opposition stronghold of Idlib into something akin to an open-air concentration camp, it’s easy to see why the Syrian regime has no moral concern over China’s persecution of its pesky Muslim population.\n\nAs for the other aforementioned Middle Eastern states, they’re awash in Chinese investment, with China replacing the US as the largest source of foreign investment in the region. These countries are seeking to lure even bigger and better bilateral trade deals with the Asian economic superpower. Since 2005, the Middle East and North Africa region has received around $190bn in Chinese investments, according to the American Enterprise Institute’s China Global Investment Tracker.\n\nEnhancing regional power\n\nAccording to Jonathon Fulton, an assistant professor of political science at Zayed University in Abu Dhabi: “China’s economic presence in the Middle East represents a strategic approach to enhancing its regional power and influence. For their part, leaders in the Middle East are responsive. Economic relations with China do not come with the same type of conditionality that tend to accompany Western states and institutions; political reform and human rights are not part of the package with Beijing.”\n\nBeyond the economic realm, it’s likely that authoritarian regimes in the Middle East will remain silent towards China’s human rights violations against Uighur Muslims, given these governments are also habitual violators of basic human rights. Saudi Arabia and Egypt routinely incarcerate and execute political prisoners.\n\nIf were they to condemn China for doing the same, it would only invite the international community to mingle in their affairs - a paralysing fear of many governments in the region.\n\nMany of these governments also hold the same panic level towards political Islam as senior officials within China’s Communist Party, as evidenced by the punishing Saudi-led blockade against Qatar for its ties to Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood. Middle Eastern governments seek to parrot China’s propaganda, not denounce it.\n\nUltimately, the China Cables expose not only Beijing’s craven policies towards its Muslim citizens, but also the shameless duplicity of Middle Eastern states. We can expect a continuation of their platitudes towards the impoverished and persecuted Palestinian people, but nothing for those crushed under the heel of China.\n\nFrom the view of those who hold thrones, palaces and mansions in Riyadh, Dubai, Damascus and Cairo, might is right, money talks, and the rest is a conversation, apparently.\n\nhttps://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/china-cables-when-will-muslim-world-speak-persecuted-uighurs\n\n------\n\nDAP Youth: Muslim students’ group Gamis abusing freedom of speech with May 13 reference\n\nThursday, 26 Dec 2019\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Dec 26 — DAP Socialist Youth (Dapsy) has today condemned the Malaysian Muslim Students Coalition (Gamis) for abusing freedom of speech, after the latter warned that the bloody May 13 riots may return as long as Chinese educationist Dong Zong still exists.\n\nThe wing’s chief Howard Lee said Gamis should have instead taken a more moderate approach like the Malaysian Muslim Youth Movement (Abim), by recently hosting a joint event with Dong Zong in order to understand each other better.\n\n“Instead, Gamis chose to be trapped by a narrow political narrative that only sees this from one perspective. The freedom of speech that students today enjoy should have been used wisely and intelligently,” Lee said in a statement.\n\n“As a student body, Gamis must take responsibility for its statement. The freedom of speech must adhere to the nation’s laws, and I hope the police will investigate such seditious remarks.”\n\nLee expressed regret that Gamis used such a provocative headline, mentioning May 13, to attract the public to read its statement.\n\nAlthough unsurprising, he added such attitudes are the cause of accusations that youths are unfit and incapable of political maturity.\n\n“Furthermore, their message implied or otherwise is clearly seditious and threatens national tranquillity. A repeat of the May 13 incident has never and will not profit any parties.\n\n“Gamis can refer back to the official government reports and newspaper clippings in the National Archive. The loss of life and damage to property has scarred racial harmony in the country,” he said.\n\nEarlier today, DAPSY members filed simultaneous police reports against Gamis in nine locations in seven states across the peninsula and in Sabah, after the student group said on Tuesday that the May 13 racial riots could happen again as long as Dong Zong remains in existence.\n\nEarlier this week, Gamis president Saifullah Baiduri had urged the Home Ministry and police to ban the group, on grounds of being an obstacle towards unity and nation-building.\n\nFollowing backlash on social media, Gamis amended its article which initially could have been taken as a call for the May 13 riots to be repeated.\n\nGamis’ remarks followed in the wake of Dong Zong organising the Chinese Organisation Congress together with several other Chinese education groups, which will be held this Saturday as part of efforts to convince the government to reconsider introducing jawi script lessons in vernacular schools.\n\nhttps://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/12/26/dap-youth-muslim-students-group-gamis-abusing-freedom-of-speech-with-may-13/1822394\n\n------\n\nArab World\n\nEgypt's leading Islamic figures visit Pope Tawadros ahead of Christmas celebrations\n\nThursday 26 Dec 2019\n\nA high-level delegation of Egypt's top Islamic institutions Al-Azhar and Dar Al-Iftaa visited Cairo’s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral on Thursday to offer Christmas greetings to Coptic Pope Tawadros II, Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of St. Mark Diocese.\n\nAl-Azhar Grand Imam Sheikh Ahmed El-Tayeb and ُُEgypt's Grand Mufti Shawki Allam headed the delegation that comprised a number of senior Muslim clerics.\n\nEl-Tayeb said that the mutual feelings of compassion, cordiality, and visits between Muslims and Christians stem from religious teachings that commanded people to get along with each other, according to a statement by Al-Azhar sent to Ahram Online.\n\n\"All prophets' recommendations stressed the necessity of spreading the spirit of brotherhood among people of different religious and ethnic backgrounds,\" he said.\n\nCoptic Orthodox Christians, who comprise the majority of Egypt's Christians, celebrate Christmas on 7 January, following the Julian calendar.

Noura Binsaidan, the graffiti artist behind the mural, has been painting Arabic faces internationally. In London and Barcelona, there are Arabian faces gracing the walls and standing out among other murals and paintings.\n\n“I mostly paint Arabic faces using Arabic calligraphy, which people have loved,” she told Arab News.\n\nWhen Binsaidan was given the chance to decorate the MDL Beast festival, she was beyond happy to be representing her style to the world. Her murals stood out at an event that invited Western cultural influences. The contrast between the local and modern made it an attraction where visitors flocked to take pictures.\n\nShe told Arab News that Saudi artists are messengers of the country. “I feel like we are basically messengers, I have to develop my skills and work carefully because as someone who is presenting Saudi Arabia I need to show everyone my best. I am trying to do something for my city and the country.”\n\nShe launched her path into graffiti painting three years ago, starting from home covering whatever surfaces she could paint.\n\nGraffiti cannot be confined to art galleries, it is made for the outside.\n\n“Graffiti is a good tool to let the people who are coming from different countries see our culture and roots via different means. That is why I always keep in mind that a lot of people are going to see my work and that makes me responsible.\n\n“It was difficult for me in the beginning because I cannot paint when someone is watching. Now I have learned how to block out the people and just focus on my artwork,” she said.\n\nJust like all art forms, graffiti presents its own challenges such as weather, with Binsaidan preferring the cold over the scalding sun.\n\nStereotypically, graffiti is often thought of as a crime and a property offense. However, Binsaidan is utilizing her skills as an artist to change this misconception.\n\n“You can’t change history, unfortunately, but in my case the government asked me to do this because they understood that they needed a different touch of art in the streets and events.”\n\nShe added: “It isn’t necessary for the artists to do graffiti on the walls and break the law, it can be done on absolutely anything like we did here at MDL Beast using shipping containers as our walls.\n\n“I draw inspiration from my culture by drawing women of my area with covered faces accompanied by metaphoric objects such as flowers to show our culture and how proud we are of it.”\n\nhttps://www.arabnews.com/node/1604601/saudi-arabia\n\n------\n\nEurope\n\nLeuven University to train Belgium’s first home-grown imams\n\nColin Clapson\n\nThu 26 Dec\n\nImams who successfully complete the course will receive recognition and will be able to count on remuneration from the Belgian state.

The Times is also paying Patel damages.\n\nPatel’s lawyer told iMediaEthics that the comments the Times said Patel made about the policeman were made by someone else and that Patel was only nine years old at the time of the incident.\n\nPatel was in the news because he asked UK politicians during a BBC debate about Islamophobia. After his appearance during the debate, Patel was suspended from his job as a schoolteacher in Gloucester over his tweets about Israel and that women should “be smarter” to avoid assault and to not be “alone with a man,” according to the Guardian. Patel’s lawyer told iMediaEthics, “He was suspended as a matter of standard practice over the whole fiasco however, he then returned to work and remains there still.”\n\nIn a statement on his lawyer’s website, Patel is quoted as saying in part, “I will continue holding anyone, including politicians to task for stoking the flames of anti-Muslim sentiment”.\n\nIn a Dec. 11 correction, the Times said:\n\n“In articles published in The Times on 20 June 2019 concerning Abdullah Patel, an Imam and teacher in Gloucester who appeared on a televised Conservative Party hustings, we stated that Mr Patel made a comment which blamed the West and Israel following the murder of a British policeman by a terror suspect. This gave the impression that he had expressed views which excused or explained acts of terrorism. We accept that he did not make any such comment. We also incorrectly stated that Mr Patel had taught at a Deobandi seminary in Bury and that the school at which he worked in Gloucester had been the subject of criticism by Ofsted for segregating parents at events. In fact, Ofsted’s criticism predated Mr Patel’s time working at the primary school. We apologise to Mr Patel for the distress caused and have agreed to pay him damages and costs.”\n\nPatel’s lawyer, Zillur Rahman, told iMediaEthics by e-mail, ” The offending article suggested that our client had posted comments with respect to the death of PC Oake in Manchester in 2003 who was killed by a terrorist.

Navalny has called the move an act of kidnaping orchestrated by the Russian president himself.\n\nRuslan Shaveddinov is part of Navalny’s extended ‘inner circle’, working as an organizer and a host at the opposition activist’s web-based TV channel. On Tuesday his boss announced he’d gone missing. Shortly afterwards Shaveddinov’s whereabouts became known – he has been conscripted into military service and sent to the Novaya Zemlya archipelago.\n\nThe development was hardly a surprise. The Russian military announced its intention to conscript the 23-year-old two months ago after his paperwork got processed as part of a brief police detention. Shaveddinov challenged this in court, saying that the medical commission that found him eligible for service had failed to properly examine him.\n\nTwo courts sided with the military, with his appeal rejected just before he was taken from his home in Moscow. Supporters claim the military turned a blind eye to his second appeal – which would have likely protracted his case beyond the December 31 deadline – and drafted him illegally. The military denies any wrongdoing.\n\nNavalny claims that Shaveddinov’s conscription was part of a plot to isolate the activist and that it comes from the top echelons of the Russian government. “Looks like Putin himself drafted the plan to isolate our Ruslan,” he wrote on Twitter. The Kremlin distanced itself from the affair, saying that conscription decisions were the prerogative of the defense ministry.\n\nNovaya Zemlya is certainly no seaside resort. It’s quite isolated and cold, and service members have to take extra precautions when going outside, so as not to run into a stray polar bear. Shaveddinov is one of a hundred or so conscripts deployed there each year.\n\nThe archipelago’s traditional defense role is to host a radar station to keep an eye on NATO aircraft that may intrude across the North Pole. Over the past years the military has been rapidly developing infrastructure there.\n\nWhether his deployment there had anything to do with Shaveddinov’s opposition work is up for debate. The man has a history of controversial statements. For instance, in one of his tweets in 2014 he mused that if John McCain had won the US presidency “we would be certainly celebrating [US] tanks in Moscow.” He was also a vocal supporter of Ukraine’s right-wing paramilitary groups and cheered the mass killings of pro-Russia activists in Odessa in May 2014.\n\nNavalny’s foundation is currently being investigated for alleged financial misconduct. The Russian authorities believe he and his people have been hiding funding from foreign governments by recording it as private donations by Russian citizens, to avoid registering as a foreign agent.\n\nhttps://www.rt.com/russia/476853-navalny-aide-military-draft/\n\n------\n\nMideast\n\nPoet of Turkish national anthem beacon for Muslim world\n\n26.12.2019\n\nZehra Nur Duz\n\nMehmet Akif Ersoy, the revered Turkish poet and the author of the Turkish national anthem, still shines a light for the entire Muslim world 83 years after his demise.\n\nErsoy became one of the most well-known figures in Turkish literature worldwide in early 1900s, Necmettin Turinay, teaching at TOBB University of Economics and Technology in the capital Ankara, told Anadolu Agency.\n\nTurinay, an expert on Ersoy's literary works and currently working on the latest edition of Ersoy's 1911 work entitled \"Safahat\", spoke to Anadolu Agency in an exclusive interview at the Museum House of Mehmet Akif Ersoy in Turkey's capital Ankara.\n\nHis famous work Safahat is a collection of 44 poems in various lengths, including Phases (1911), Lecturing at Suleymaniye (1912), Voices of God (1913), Lecturing at Fatih (1914), Memoirs (1917), Asim (1924), and Shadows (1933).\n\nHis poems were themed with social problems, philosophical, religious, political and ethical issues.\n\nErsoy's house, in one of Ankara’s older districts Altindag, was once used as a dervish convent. The \"Selamlik\" -- a part of a house only men can enter -- was assigned to Ersoy during the Turkish War of Independence.\n\nMoving from Istanbul to Ankara to live in the dervish convent in 1920s, now converted into a museum, Ersoy arrived there during the most painful and troubled years of foreign occupation in the country, Turinay said.\n\nSpiritual leader of Turkish national struggle\n\nWhen Ersoy came to Ankara, the Turkish people had to achieve mainly two things to win the War of Independence, Turinay stressed.\n\nThe first was to form a new army as the Turkish armies were dissolved with the agreements of World War I, and the second was to encourage the people to join the national struggle with a hope for independence, he stressed.\n\nDuring his speeches at various mosques of Central Anatolian cities, Ersoy gave voice to the faith and spirit necessary for the national struggle, Turinay added.\n\nIn 1920, Ersoy was also elected the deputy of the northwestern Burdur province and entered the parliament.\n\n‘Free since beginning, to be so forever’\n\nThe dervish convent was also the place where Ersoy wrote the lyrics of Turkish National Anthem -- the March of Independence -- Turinay said.\n\nOn March 12, 1921, the Turkish Grand National Assembly officially declared Ersoy's poem as the national anthem.\n\nIn the march, Ersoy immortalized his nation's battle for survival, in the wake of World War I, crowning its national liberation in 1921 during the Turkish War of Independence against foreign occupation.\n\nAfter World War I, the Ottoman Empire, one of the greatest empires in history, was destroyed.\n\nThe British, French and allied forces had shattered the Ottoman Empire, and every part of the country was in captivity.\n\nUnder those conditions, the national anthem's first words were “Fear not!”.\n\nErsoy began his poem with such a call to give hope to the Turkish and Muslim people against foreign occupation that they can regain their independence, he said.\n\n“The Turkish nation has been free since the beginning of history,” said Turinay referring to the two verses of the anthem.\n\n“I have been free since the beginning and forever will be so.”\n\nWhat madman shall put me in chains! I defy the very idea!”\n\nThe phrase of “since the beginning” had special significance expressing that the Turkish people have always lived in independence, founding great empires, Turinay said.\n\nThrough these verses, Ersoy warned Turkish people that the negative conditions were temporary and urged to struggle together to overcome the captivity, Turinay added.\n\nUniversal character, historical depth of national anthem\n\nTurinay stressed that the national anthem soon began to evoke significant repercussions in the Muslim and Turkic worlds in the wake of official recognition by the Turkish Parliament.\n\n“The national anthem, 'the symbol of the Turkish nation', has a universal character appealing to both the Turkish and Islamic worlds,” he highlighted.\n\nIt was translated into the local languages of various countries, including Pakistan, Syria and Iraq, although the people of these countries were living under captivity of the French and British at that time.\n\n“Ersoy, who depicted the most painful years of Turkey during World War I and Balkan Wars in his works, gained a high reputation within and outside of the Ottoman Empire,\" Turinay underlined.\n\nHe was a well known poet and author in a wide range of countries"
