        "text": "It's always fascinating to hear one legend lavishing praise on another icon of the gentlemen's game. Legendary Pakistani cricketer and former skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq has named the batsman who he believes was the greatest of all time in a Pakistani national jersey. Arguably one of the greatest to lead the Green Army, Inzamam himself enjoys the legendary status and the batting maestro is also the only Pakistani batsman to have scored 20,000 international runs.\n\nWhile many considered Inzamam as the greatest batsman to have represented the Pakistani side, the former coach and team consultant believes his former teammate and 1992 World Cup winner with then Imran Khan-led Pakistan deserves the tag of being - the best batsman Pakistan ever produced till date. Interacting with his fans and followers in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Inzamam picked the legendary Javed Miandad as Pakistan's greatest batsman of all time.\n\n“I am going to talk about a player who was the hero of all batsmen when I was playing cricket. I am taking about Javed Miandad. He was the best player Pakistan ever produced at least in terms of batting. I have played with him for four to five years as a player and then also as a coach. He had a strong belief in himself which made him so great,” Inzamam said on a YouTube video said.\n\nInzamam hails the legend of Miandad\n\nSaluting the greatest of Miandad, Inzamam talked about his fearless approach towards premier bowlers and how the batting icon used to turn the tables for the opposition when they used to sledge him. Hailed as the flagbearer of fearless batting, Inzamam called Miandad a big match player, who rose to every occasion during his batting prime.\n\n“I once talked to Mushtaq Mohammad, he told me when they went to Australia when Miandad was a youngster, where batsmen feared going on top of the order Miandad was always eager to go out to bat and had a fearless approach. He would sledge the best bowlers in the world. Usually, bowlers sledged to get batsmen off their rhythm but Miandad turned it around. He was a big match player and rose to every occasion. He didn’t let players know how hard the situation is while playing a calculated knock,” he added.\n\n'Javed explained the art of batting the best'\n\nKnown for his unconventional style of batting and leadership skills, Inzamam said that Miandad explained the art of batting the best as he was the batsman who was always concerned about scoring then techniques.\n\n“I have played cricket around the world and I think Javed bhai explained the art of batting the best. He was never interested in the technique like all the others. He was focused on teaching batsmen how to score. This was his coaching. All great batsmen in the world have been more concerned about scoring than techniques,” he concluded."
