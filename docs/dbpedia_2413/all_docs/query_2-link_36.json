        "text": "Every Sufi Dargah is incomplete without Qawwals and their quintessential Qawwali..be it Makhdoom Shah Baba at Mahim,or Khwajah Garib Nawaz at Ajmer or Nizamuddin Aulia in Delhi.\n\nQawwali is the staple diet of the devotees who come to pay their salutations to the Dargahs during the annual Urus..\n\nNo Urus is complete without Qawwali rendition in music and vocal praising the Holy Saint and his Holy Shrine.\n\nAnd the qawwals get handsomely paid by the crowds , but more than money the Qawwals to seek the blessiings of the Holy Saint to achieve success in Bollywood or shows all over the world.\n\nIndians and Pakistanis love Qawwalis..\n\nQawwali sourced from wikipedia.\n\nQawwali (Urdu/Persian: قوٌالی; Punjabi/Multani: ਖ਼ਵ੍ਵਾਲੀ, قوٌالی; Brajbhasha/Hindi: क़व्वाली) is a form of Sufi devotional music popular on the Indian subcontinent. It's a vibrant musical tradition that stretches back more than 700 years. Originally performed mainly at Sunni Sufi shrines throughout the subcontinent, it has also gained mainstream popularity. Qawwali music received international exposure through the work of the late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, largely due to several releases on the Real World label, followed by live appearances at WOMAD festivals. Often listeners, and even artists themselves, are transported to a state of wajad, a trance-like state where they feel at one with God, generally considered to be the height of spiritual ecstasy in Sufism. Although famous throughout the world, its economic and spiritual hub remains the Punjab province of Pakistan from where it gained entry into the mainstream commercial music industry and international fame.\n\n[edit] Song content\n\nThe songs which constitute the qawwali repertoire are mostly in Urdu and Punjabi (almost equally divided between the two), although there are several songs in Persian, Brajbhasha and Siraiki.[1][2] There is also qawwali in some regional languages (e.g., Chhote Babu Qawwal sings in Bengali), but the regional language tradition is relatively obscure. Also, the sound of the regional language qawwali can be totally different from that of mainstream qawwali. This is certainly true of Chhote Babu Qawwal, whose sound is much closer to Baul music than to the qawwali of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, for example.\n\nThe poetry is implicitly understood to be spiritual in its meaning, even though the lyrics can sometimes sound wildly secular, or outright hedonistic. The central themes of qawwali are love, devotion and longing (of man for the Divine).\n\nQawwalis are classified by their content into several categories:\n\nA hamd is a song in praise of Allah. Traditionally, a qawwali performance starts with a hamd.\n\nA naat is a song in praise of the Prophet Muhammad. The opening hamd is traditionally followed by a naat.\n\nA manqabat is a song in praise of either Imam Ali or one of the Sufi saints. Interestingly, manqabats in praise of Ali are sung at both Sunni and Shi'a gatherings. If one is sung, it will follow right after the naat. There is usually at least one manqabat in a traditional programme.\n\nA marsiya is a lamentation over the death of much of Imam Husayn's family in the Battle of Karbala. Once again, this would typically be sung only at a Shi'a concert.\n\nA ghazal is a song that sounds secular on the face of it. There are two extended metaphors that run through ghazals -- the joys of drinking and the agony of separation from the beloved. These songs feature exquisite poetry, and can certainly be taken at face value, and enjoyed at that level. In fact, in India and Pakistan, ghazal is also a separate, distinct musical genre in which many of the same songs are performed in a different musical style, and in a secular context. In the context of that genre, the songs are usually taken at face value, and no deeper meaning is necessarily implied. But in the context of qawwali, these songs of intoxication and yearning use secular metaphors to poignantly express the soul's longing for union with the Divine, and its joy in loving the Divine. In the songs of intoxication, \"Wine\" represents \"knowledge of the Divine\", the \"Cupbearer\" (saaqi) is God or a spiritual guide, the \"Tavern\" is the metaphorical place where the soul may (or may not) be fortunate enough to attain spiritual enlightenment. (The \"Tavern\" is emphatically not a conventional house of worship. Rather, it is taken to be the spiritual context within which the soul exists) Intoxication is attaining spiritual knowledge, or being filled with the joy of loving the Divine. In the songs of yearning, the soul, having been abandoned in this world by that cruel and cavalier lover, God, sings of the agony of separation, and the depth of its yearning for reunion.\n\nA kafi is a song in Punjabi, which is in the unique style of poets such as Shah Hussain and Baba Bulleh Shah. Two of the more popular Kafis include Ni Main Jana Jogi De Naal and Mera Piya Ghar Aaya.\n\nA munadjaat is a song where the singer displays his thanks to Allah through a variety of linguistic techniques. It is often sung in Persian, with Mawlana Jalāl-ad-Dīn Rumi credited as its inventor.\n\n[edit] Composition of a qawwali party\n\nA group of qawwali musicians, called a party, typically consists of eight or nine men — women are, for all intents and purposes, excluded from traditional Muslim music as respectable women are traditionally prohibited from singing in the presence of men, though these traditions are changing — including a lead singer, one or two side singers, one or two harmoniums (which may be played by lead singer, side singer or someone else), and percussion. If there is only one percussionist, he plays the tabla and dholak, usually the tabla with the left hand and the dholak with the right. Often there will be two percussionists, in which case one might play the tabla and the other the dholak. There is also a chorus of four or five men who repeat key verses, and who aid and abet percussion by hand-clapping.\n\nThe performers sit in two rows — the lead singer, side singers and harmonium players in the front row, and the chorus and percussionists in the back row.\n\nBefore the fairly recent introduction of the harmonium, qawwalis were usually accompanied by the sarangi. The sarangi had to be retuned between songs; the harmonium didn't, and was soon preferred.\n\n[edit] Musical structure\n\nSongs are usually between 15 to 30 minutes long. However, the longest commercially released qawwali runs slightly over 115 minutes (Hashr Ke Roz Yeh Poochhunga by Aziz Mian Qawwal). The qawwali maestro Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan has at least two songs that are more than 60 minutes long.\n\nQawwalis tend to begin gently and build steadily to a very high energy level in order to induce hypnotic states both among the musicians and within the audience. Songs are usually arranged as follows:\n\nThey start with an instrumental prelude where the main melody is played on the harmonium, accompanied by the tabla, and which may include improvised variations of the melody.\n\nThen comes the alap, a long tonal improvised melody during which the singers intone different long notes, in the raag of the song to be played.\n\nThe lead singer begins to sing some preamble verses which are typically not part of the main song, although thematically related to it. These are sung unrhythmically, improvised following the raag, and accompanied only by the harmonium. After the lead singer sings a verse, one of the side singers will repeat the verse, perhaps with his own improvisation. A few or many verses will be sung in this way, leading into the main song.\n\nAs the main song begins, the tabla, dholak and clapping begin. All members join in the singing of the verses that constitute the refrain. Normally neither the lyrics of the main verses nor the melodies that go with them are improvised; in fact, these are often traditional songs sung by many groups, especially within the same lineage. As the song proceeds, the lead singer or one of the side singers may break out into an alap. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan also popularized the interjection of sargam singing at this point. The song usually builds in tempo and passion, with each singer trying to outdo the other in terms of vocal acrobatics. Some singers may do long periods of sargam improvisation, especially alternating improvisations with a student singer. The songs usually end suddenly.\n\nThe singing style of qawwali is different from Western singing styles in many ways. For example, in words beginning with an \"m\", Western singers are apt to stress the vowel following the \"m\" rather than the \"m\" itself, whereas in qawwali, the \"m\" will usually be held, producing a muted tone. Also in qawwali, there is no distinction between what is known as the chest voice and the neck voice (the different areas that sound will resonate in depending on the frequency sung). Rather, qawwals sing very loudly and forcefully, which allows them to extend their chest voice to much higher frequencies than those used in Western singing, even though this usually causes a more noisy or strained sound than would be acceptable in the West.\n\n[edit] Singing Order in Chistiya\n\nInstrumental: This is supposed to be the announcement of the arrival of Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti's, as Sufi believes their saints are free of time-space. Also that Nabi, Siddique, Shaheed, and Saleh category of faithfuls are never dead, just gone into some other state from where they visit whenever they are mentioned, especially if there is a function in their honor.\n\nHamd\n\nNaat\n\nManqabat Ali\n\nManqabat Ghous: Praise of Shaikh Abdul Qadir Jelani\n\nManqabat Khwaja: Praise of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti\n\nManqabat Shaikh: Praise of the Shaikh/Pir if it is his anniversary\n\nRang or Badhawa: If it is the death anniversary of the Pir, then it is usually Rang, a poem by Amir Khusro. If it is the Shaikh's birthday, it is usually the Badhawa.\n\n[edit] Legendary Qawwals of the Past\n\nAziz Ahmed Warsi\n\nAziz Mian Qawwal\n\nBadar Ali Khan (aka Badar Miandad)\n\nBahauddin Qutbuddin\n\nFateh Ali Khan Mubarik Ali Khan\n\nJafar Husain Khan Badauni\n\nMuhammed Saeed Chishti\n\nMunshi Raziuddin\n\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan\n\nSabri Brothers\n\n[edit] Well-known Qawwals of Today\n\nAbida Parveen\n\nAmjad Sabri\n\nAziz Nazan\n\nBakshi Javed Salamat\n\nChhote Aziz Nazan\n\nFaiz Ali Faiz\n\nFareed Ayaz\n\nGhulam Sabir Nizami and Ghulam Waris Nizami\n\nMehr Ali Sher Ali\n\nNajmuddin Saifuddin\n\nRahat Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan\n\nSher Miandad Khan\n\nWaheed and Naveed Chishti\n\nThe home record of West Indies in the 1980s was awe-inspiring. In 1987-88, Pakistan arrived to play a team that had not lost a series in 15 years, or a Test in ten. A whole generation had grown up not knowing what defeat meant. The Pakistanis were up against habit as much as anything else. Yet they were the most fancied to turn the tide. Imran Khan, the captain, had been persuaded by the country's President, Zia ul-Haq, to come out of retirement. Javed Miandad, who knew he would not be spoken of in hushed tones if he didn't have a century in the West Indies against his name, was waiting to set the record straight.\n\n\"After that series,\" wrote Miandad, \"I finally came to terms with my insecurities about scoring overseas. The comments from my detractors ceased. Imran had always been reluctant to hand it to me as a batsman. But after that tour he did.\"\n\nThese two men were the heroes in a series that ended 1-1, but should have gone Pakistan's way if not for the spotty umpiring in the final Test, when the ninth-wicket pair of Jeff Dujon and Winston Benjamin took West Indies to victory.\n\nImran finished with 23 wickets, and Miandad made two centuries. Part-time bowlers Shoaib Mohammad and Mudassar Nazar took wickets at crucial times thanks to Imran going by instinct and giving them spells; Abdul Qadir punched a spectator who had been riling him and was forced to settle out of court; and it all ended with the West Indies captain, Viv Richards, in tears.\n\nThere was no hint of the drama to come when Pakistan lost the one-day series 0-5. The Test series began in Georgetown, Guyana. West Indies were without Richards and Malcolm Marshall, and were led by Gordon Greenidge.\n\nImran stamped his name on the series with seven wickets on the first day, including a spell of 4 for 9 in three overs, as West Indies fell for 292. Pakistan ended day two 33 behind, but with six wickets in hand. Miandad, unbeaten on 96 overnight, was immobile on 99 for 38 minutes on the third morning before his first century against West Indies, his 16th overall.\n\nThe pace battery comprised Courtney Walsh, Curtly Ambrose, Patrick Patterson and Winston Benjamin. \"I taunted the bowlers,\" wrote Miandad, \"I pointed my chest to Ambrose, 'Try and hit me and I'll show you,' I told him.\" Benjamin \"bowled an over in which he delivered six bouncers. Shoaib came down the wicket to tell me that Winston was deliberately no-balling, releasing the ball some yards past the crease, trying to bowl as threatening a delivery as he could.\"\n\nIn all, West Indies conceded 71 extras, a world record. Pakistan finished with 435, helped by a spirited 62 from their wicketkeeper, Saleem Yousuf. An infected toe prevented Imran from bowling more than two overs in the final session, but the rest day and antibiotics allowed him to play a crucial role on the fourth day, when he dismissed Greenidge and Gus Logie. He then turned to the seldom-used offbreaks of Shoaib, who picked up Dujon and Benjamin off successive deliveries.\n\n\"It didn't surprise me when we lost in the first Test,\" said Richie Richardson, who showed he was a master of logic: \"You had two good teams competing, and if one doesn't play too well then the other comes up trumps.\"\n\nOr, they could both have played well and finished with a draw. As in the second Test, in Port-of-Spain, where Pakistan needed the batting skills of the last man, Qadir, to keep their lead in the series alive. Either team could have won in the final session. Qadir saw out five deliveries from Viv Richards after a second century by Miandad had brought Pakistan to the threshold. Miandad fell with 84 runs needed to win from 20 overs (the target was 372, 71 more than Pakistan had ever made in a fourth innings before).\n\nRichards and Marshall were back for this game, but Imran and Qadir dismissed West Indies for under 200 again in the first innings, giving Pakistan the initial advantage. But Pakistan managed a lead of only 20 runs, and West Indies came into their own in the second innings. Centuries from Richards and Dujon took them to 391 and set up a dramatic finish. Things got tense on day three when Richards threateningly waved his bat at Yousuf after an appeal for lbw off Imran's bowling was rejected by the umpire. The situation was soon defused, though.\n\nWhen Qadir bowled Marshall, it was his 200th wicket, but Dujon added 90 runs for the last two wickets with Benjamin and Walsh. Again it was Imran (five) and Qadir (four) who were the successful bowlers. With Pakistan chasing, Miandad added 113 for the sixth wicket with 19-year-old Ijaz Ahmed. They finished with 341 for 9.\n\nThe final Test was in Bridgetown. \"They had threatened to prepare a greentop all through, and when we arrived at the Oval (Barbados), it was a greentop,\" said opener Ramiz Raja. Pakistan were put in. \"Straightaway Marshall shot two bouncers across my head. We were in no mood to be defensive, and both Shoaib Mohammad and I played our shots,\" Ramiz remembered.\n\nOnce again the teams finished the first innings on almost level terms, West Indies making 306 to Pakistan's 309. Shoaib top scored for Pakistan in both innings, and there was a thrilling stand of 67 for the eighth wicket between Salim Yousuf and Wasim Akram, who put on 50 in five overs. Then, attempting to hook Marshall, Yousuf deflected the ball onto his face and broke his nose, leaving Aamer Malik to keep wicket.\n\nWest Indies were 198 for 3 when Mudassar dismissed Desmond Haynes and Logie with successive balls. Dujon was run out one run later. The tail rallied, though, and when Pakistan were reduced to 177 for 6 at the end of day three, it seemed all over for them.\n\nOn the fourth morning, Imran and Yousuf - who batted with a runner because he was still dizzy from the blow - added 52 for the eighth wicket. By close of play it was even again: Pakistan, dismissed for 262, had hit back to remove Haynes, Greenidge, Richie Richardson, Carl Hooper and Logie. West Indies needed another 112.\n\nAmbrose and Richards fell in the first half hour on the final day, but things were beginning to go wrong for Pakistan. \"After Wasim had got rid of Ambrose and Richards, I had Marshall plumb lbw on the back foot to a flipper, but the umpire turned down the appeal,\" recalled Qadir. Still, when Dujon and Benjamin came together, West Indies, needing another 59 to win, were 207 for 8. If the Pakistanis were celebrating, it was understandable - but it turned out to be premature.\n\n\"We would have wrapped up the game but a couple of crucial umpiring decisions robbed us of victory,\" wrote Miandad. \"We would have been successful if it was not for the poor umpiring that spoilt our chances in the end,\" Qadir agreed. They had surprising support from Benjamin. \"I thought Pakistan were a bit unlucky not to have got the benefit of that Dujon bat-and-pad catch,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought that towards the end of the match the umpire was no-balling me unnecessarily, allowing Benjamin to go for big shots,\" said Qadir, who was also involved in a fracas with a spectator who kept taunting him as he fielded on the boundary. Qadir punched the man and had to later pay US$1000 in an out-of-court settlement.\n\nBenjamin recalled how he, hearing the wicketkeeper telling Qadir, \"legbreak, googly, flipper,\" started repeating the order to himself. Luckily for Benjamin, Qadir didn't change the sequence, and having predicted the googly correctly, Benjamin hit the winning boundary off it.\n\nWisden said of the series, \"The umpiring, except for a few debatable decisions, was good.\" Imran agreed only in part: \"Unfortunately, during the second innings of the Bridgetown Test, we were disappointed. Three vital mistakes went against us.\"\n\n\"It probably represents some of the best cricket that's ever been played anywhere,\" wrote Miandad.\n\nThe final word must belong to Benjamin. \"When I saw our captain crying in the dressing room at the end of the game, I realised how much it meant to him. To see the great Viv Richards in tears made me realise what cricket meant to him and how important this win was for West Indies.\"\n\nSuresh Menon is a writer based in Bangalore\n\n© Cricinfo\n\nA Pakistan with momentum is a beast that cannot be contained. England discovered that fact to their cost in 1992 at Melbourne, when Imran Khan's cornered tigers sprung at their throats to seize the country's first major global title. And now, a generation later but in a campaign of distinct and glorious parallels, Sri Lanka have also sampled the unstoppable alchemy that occurs when cricket's most emotional and temperamental participants find a way to meld their ambitions to their deeds.\n\nIt doesn't always end up this way. Two years ago against India, in the inaugural World Twenty20 final in Johannesburg, Pakistan blew their chance for glory when Misbah-ul-Haq choked on his emotions at the end of a stunning match-turning counterattack, and chose the wrong ball to flick over fine leg. And then, of course, there was Pakistan's last appearance in the 50-over World Cup final, against Australia right here at Lord's in 1999, when the conviction in the performance and the margin in the result - eight wickets - exactly mirrored today's effect and upshot.\n\nIn fact, it is a decade and a day since Pakistan's demolition at the hands of Australia, and only two players remain from that match. Abdul Razzaq bowled two overs that day for 13, having limped to 17 from 51 balls while batting at No. 3; Shahid Afridi flogged two fours in 16 balls, and wasn't called upon to put his legspin into practice. Ten years and a thousand memories later, Razzaq and Afridi rose to the needs of the hour and turned themselves into the game's critical performers. Like the identities of the teams in this poignant final, it was a detail that can only have been scripted by the fates.\n\n\"Me, Shahid and Razzaq, we were chatting with the guys: 'Please this time we will hold our nerves and make our final touch',\" said Younis, who added how surprised he had been by the maturity of Afridi's batting. \"He took singles,\" he said in admiration of a man who added calculation to his aggression, and paced the chase to perfection. Two lusty swipes into the stands thrilled a packed Lord's, but not half as much as the scruffy leg-bye with which the title was sealed. Rare is the Pakistan team that puts substance over style, but when it occurs, the overall effect is electrifying.\n\nAs for Razzaq, he had his own reasons to impress - his omission from the last World Twenty20 in South Africa was the catalyst for his defection to the ICL, which in turn led to his two-year exile from international cricket. He cut through the red tape last month, but only returned as a replacement for the injured Yasir Arafat last week. Nevertheless, he slipped effortlessly into his time-honoured utility role, this time as an under-rated old hand to balance the youthful aggression of Wasim Akram's acolyte, Mohammad Aamer. After nine deliveries of the final, old and young had claimed a pair of ducks between them. And those lead weights of expectation had been alchemised into gold.\n\nBoth the captain and his Man of the Match hail from the troubled North West Frontier Province, and Afridi himself from the Khyber Agency, the symbolic frontline of Pakistan's War on Terror. Chaos can seem at times to be embedded in the Pakistani DNA, but as both men showed in their performances in this tournament, it does not have to be this way\n\nYounis has now stepped aside from Twenty20 cricket, much as Imran Khan bowed out on a high in 1992. For all his quiet insistence that this competition lacks the prestige of the 50-over World Cup, he knows that he and his players have achieved something wonderful, and every bit as lasting as the memories forged by Imran, Miandad, Wasim and Mushtaq, way back in the mists of time.\n\n\"I'm the second Khan winning a World Cup for Pakistan, so I'm very proud of my Khans,\" said Younis. \"This is my dream. I dreamed all the time of lifting the World Cup. My thinking in all my career is that I will be remembered for a team like 1992. I was not in the Imran Khan team, and this is a dream come true. I'm really happy. Though this World Cup is Twenty20, at least we won our second World Cup. This is a gift to our whole nation.\"\n\nHe is not wrong. To get a sense of how much Pakistan needed this victory, you have to look beyond the bedlam in the stands at Lord's where a shimmer of bouncing green shirts gave a surface-level glimpse of the euphoria, and instead burrow deep into the parks and gullies of Karachi, Rawalpindi, Lahore and Peshawar, where a nation starved of joy has been given the timeliest succour. It is arguable, in fact, that there has been no more timely sporting victory since a newly unified South Africa won the Rugby World Cup back in 1995.\n\nWhere Francois Pienaar's Springboks drew a newly unified nation ever more tightly together, the achievement of Younis's men has been to help slow the fragmentation of a state that is rapidly being considered by the world at large to have failed. Both the captain and his Man of the Match hail from the troubled North West Frontier Province, and Afridi himself from the Khyber Agency, the symbolic frontline of Pakistan's War on Terror. Chaos can seem at times to be embedded in the Pakistani DNA, but as both men showed in their performances in this tournament, it does not have to be this way.\n\n\"If you see the whole nation, where law and order is not good, we are from them,\" said Younis. \"How can we be consistent? With these kind of things going for us, if you see our cricket it is all the time suffering from a lot of things. After that we are still winning the World Cup. It is a great achievement for us. I am requesting to all of the countries you must come to Pakistan. Everybody knows law and order is not good but it is not our fault.\"\n\nFor the moment, any prospect of cricket resuming in Pakistan is futile, despite the joy of this occasion and the hope for the future that it generates. But in the shorter term, what we witnessed at Lord's today was the will of a troubled nation to pull in the same direction. From the fight within the team to the reaction around the stands, it was clear how much the notion of Pakistan still means. Next summer, the prospect exists of England hosting their \"home\" Test series against Australia. Today was a taster of the euphoria that would bring. It must be allowed to happen.\n\nAndrew Miller is UK editor of Cricinfo\n\nFeeds: Andrew Miller\n\nComments: 12\n\nMajid Khan was my favourite cricketer before I ever saw him in the flesh, discovered via print, radio and mind's eye in 1967. Not, for most people, an especially memorable cricket year: India and Pakistan sent a couple of their less distinguished touring teams to England. Most people, though, were not seven years old and discovering Test cricket for the first time.\n\nLogically, India should have caught the imagination. A team led by a one-eyed prince, with a wicketkeeper who was apparently named after his job, and a turbaned spin bowler should have excited any seven-year-old.\n\nInstead it was Pakistan. I couldn't have found it on a map - always assuming, only 20 years on from Partition, that either school or home could have furnished one that showed it. But the 'Made in Pakistan' printed on my child-size bat wielded ineffectively on beaches that summer, while listening to John Arlott and radio confreres describing Hanif Mohammad batting, apparently forever, at Lord's, furnished the illusion of affinity.\n\nMajid, identified more often than not as the son of the man whose delivery had killed a sparrow at Lord's in the 1930s, failed in the Tests. Little matter. He had already stamped himself indelibly on this mind's eye with an extraordinary innings against Glamorgan, my team, at Swansea. One hundred and forty-seven runs in 89 minutes, with 13 sixes. Not long after, it was announced that he had signed for Glamorgan.\n\nHe joined the overwhelming wave of novelty associated with 1968, the transforming year in which international greatness - Garry Sobers, Rohan Kanhai et al - descended upon county cricket. He was Glamorgan's best player but favouritism is inherently subjective, springing from something that strikes a chord, not objective assessment of quality. Most Test selectors would choose David Gower rather than Derek Randall, Nathan Astle ahead of Chris Harris, Javed Miandad instead of Inzamam-ul-Haq, and Adam Gilchrist before Farokh Engineer. All are fine, engaging cricketers - but Randall, Harris, Inzamam and Engineer have struck in me some deeper nerve of affinity.\n\nThat Glamorgan team had numerous candidates for hero worship. Alan Jones and Don Shepherd, Welshmen both, were, respectively, the highest scorer and most prolific wicket-taker never to play in Tests. But Majid offered something different. Years later I interviewed American writer Robert Parker and quizzed him about the relationship between his life and that of his main character, the quixotic, literate Boston private eye Spenser: \"There is a fair amount in common, but Spenser can do things that I can' t do, and nor can anybody else, because he's a romantic hero, and that's what they do.\"\n\nMajid was our romantic hero. He came from a faraway country of which we knew little, and even before the incredible innings that won him his contract in 1967 had done implausible things like make his first-class debut, scoring a century and taking six wickets, at 15. And what small boy could not warm to a batsman who took bonus payments for exceptional performances from a grateful captain in the form of multiple ice-cream cones?\n\nNone of our other, more local, heroes could change his name between seasons - Majid Jahangir became Khan from 1970 on - score a double-century in the Varsity match or, most importantly, an attacking 156 on a brutal wicket in the match that gave Glamorgan the championship in 1969. Tony Lewis's memoirs confirm that Majid was to Glamorgan what Adam Gilchrist has been for Australia, a batting catalyst transforming his team's sense of the possible.\n\nRomantic heroism cannot always survive the scrutiny of reality. A friend who went into football journalism once said that the saddest part was the progressive disillusionment of meeting people he had idolised as players. But the flesh and blood Majid seen with the critical eyes of teenage years had all the magic of the imagined hero of childhood.\n\nLeast of the joys of his 110 against Australia at Swansea in 1975 was that it came in two hours. Still more striking was the unhurried ease of his movements, and timing so uncanny that 85mph deliveries from Max Walker and Alan Hurst would be despatched firmly to the boundary without the contact of bat and ball making any sound. What might Wilfred Rhodes, famously capable of following cricket by sound alone, have made of Majid in this form? Greg Chappell, chasing the fastest double-hundred of all time when dismissed for 144 the following day (that Clive Lloyd broke the record at Swansea a year later says all you need to know about Glamorgan's mid-1970s bowling), seemed by comparison prosaic.\n\nNor was Majid just a man for good days and easy wickets. Bishan Bedi reckoned him the best bad-wicket player in the world, an instinctive master of the turning ball. Dennis Lillee tried (not, it would seem, on aesthetic grounds) but failed to knock off the floppy hat that was Majid's sole concession to inelegance.\n\nA personal memory is of Majid batting against Geoff Arnold, Mike Hendrick, and Chris Old - an England attack that might have been designed for the conditions - at Headingley in 1974. For once, he did not make it look easy. Not much was timed. But as Sadiq and Mushtaq Mohammad, Zaheer Abbas and Asif Iqbal mustered only 96 between them (Dennis Amiss, John Edrich and Keith Fletcher totalled 33 the following day), a four-hour vigil produced the highest score of the match, 75, and a comfortable first-innings lead for Pakistan.\n\nMajid was a cricketer of substance as well as style, an imagined hero who turned out well in reality. Rob Steen was right when he decried the unthinking retention of heroes of childhood, but having thought about this one I see less reason than ever to discard him.\n\nHuw Richards is cricket correspondent of the International Herald Tribune\n\nA game billed as The Showdown Test became instead a perfect showcase for the awesome fast bowling talents of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. Pakistan won 15 minutes before lunch on the fourth day, a more comprehensive victory than even they could have dared hope for - and the crowning triumph of the summer for their captain Javed Miandad. At last, Miandad was captain in his own right - the unchallenged leader of a young, multi-talented team that no longer needed, or wanted, the paternal and patrician guidance of Imran Khan. Fittingly, too, Imran's record of 21 wickets in a series for Pakistan in England was equalled by Wasim and broken by Waqar, who claimed one more. Their combined total of 43 wickets was the main reason why Pakistan won their fourth successive series against England; at The Oval their haul of 15 left the home nation shattered and outclassed.\n\nEngland's selectors recalled Malcolm and Tufnell, who had recovered form his appendix operation, and, for the time being, abandoned the attempt to persevere with Hick. Pakistan dropped Inzamam-Ul-Haq, another promising young batsman who had disappointed at Test level, to give Shoaib Mohammad his first Test of the series, and unexpectedly replaced wicket-keeper Moin Khan with Rashid Latif. Another man making his first appearance of the series was umpire Dickie Bird, believed to inspire more confidence than most among the tourists.\n\nGooch won an important toss in conditions near-perfect for batting and for much of the opening day England's battle-plan went smoothly, even through Gooch himself and Stewart fell in the first session, after a flying start against the new ball. Stewart had asked to combine the opener's job with keeping wicket again, although in the event a blow to his foot meant that Smith had to stand in for him behind the stumps on the first evening. England were 40 minutes into the final session, on 182 for three, when Aqib Javed knocked out the first brick and then left Wasim to push over the whole structure. Gower's innings ended with a bottom-edged square cut into his stumps; Wasim, with a little help from Waqar, then took just 45 minutes more to rout England's lower order with a thrilling spell of five for 18 in 7.1 overs. Ramprakash was lbw pushing forward to an in-swinging full toss, while the tail was blown away by a succession of near-unplayable in-swinging yorkers. Atherton, after batting with great determination, was eighth out, edging Waqar to the keeper after nearly four and a half hours.\n\nPakistan's top order then set about the business of building a match-winning lead, with five of the first six threatening but ultimately failing to play a major innings. Aamir Sohail, the double-centurion of Old Trafford, struck 10 fours in his 49, while Salim Malik's 40 took his tally to 488 and made him the most prolific scorer for either side in an England- Pakistan series, surpassing D. C. S. Compton's 453 in 1954. He was bowled early on Saturday morning by a beauty from Malcolm, who went on to take five for 94 in a big-hearted display which justified his latest recall to arms. But while Malcolm was putting in a determined bid for a place on the winter tour to India, Test cricket's latest newcomer was announcing himself with a rare flourish. Latif, until now most familiar as a substitute fielder, came in unhelmeted with Pakistan's lead only 85 and proceeded - in just his fifth first-class innings of the entire tour - to play with the uninhibited joy and the effortless timing of a natural batsman. His 87-ball 50 featured six fours before he was last out aiming another blow.\n\nLatif's vital contribution left England 173 behind and facing a long struggle to save the match, but Waqar, bowling with great pace and spirit, hungrily lapped up the cream of their batting. By tea he had single-handedly reduced them to 55 for three, and it was 59 for four when Gower shouldered arms to one that came back off the seam and took his off stump. The contest was effectively over. Ramprakash, desperate to improve a depressing Test record, made 17 in promising style before he was unluckily adjudged to have touched with a glove a ball from Mushtaq Ahmed that ballooned to short leg off his pad. Smith and Lewis ensured the match lasted into the fourth day, but Sunday morning brought just a final exhibition of Wasim and Waqar's ability to brush aside a tail. Smith's brave unbeaten 84, in four hours and from 179 balls, took him out of a poor run and represented a personal triumph against the leg-spin and googlies of Mushtaq which had mystified him all summer. Thanks to Smith, Pakistan were at least required to bat again. But a wide from Ramprakash and a square-cut boundary next ball from Sohail were sufficient to send into raptures the hundreds of Pakistani fans who gathered in front of the pavilion to salute their heroes. The only sour note for Pakistan came after their triumph, when the media indulged in more speculation about ball-tampering. This time the reports were sparked off by England manager Micky Stewart, who said he knew how the Pakistani bowlers managed to swing an old ball more than the new one - but was not prepared to reveal the secret.\n\nA series that the entire cricket world had been waiting for with bated breath started off with an absolutely incredible match at the National Stadium in Karachi. In a game in which the result was in the balance until the very last ball, India finally edged through by five runs after amassing 349.\n\nFor much of the match, it appeared that Pakistan would pull off an astounding run-chase, as Inzamam-ul-Haq chose this stage to showcase his genius. His innings of 122 - surely one of the greatest ever played in a one-day international - made light of a steep target, and almost handed India their second defeat in three days after scoring more than 300. Even so Pakistan's 344 was comfortably the highest total made by the side batting second in any one-day international.\n\nIt was high-octane stuff from the start, with plenty of batting stars from either side: Virender Sehwag blasted 79 from 57 balls to get India off to a blistering start, while Rahul Dravid stroked a classy 99 to ensure that the splendid start wasn't wasted. Then, Yousuf Youhana caressed 73 to revive Pakistan's hopes. But the innings of the match came from Inzamam.\n\nNo team had ever successfully chased 350 in an ODI, and that statistic didn't look likely to change when Pakistan lost two early wickets and struggled to 71 for 2 in 15 overs. The Indian seamers bowled with superb control, and with the asking rate mounting to eight early in the chase, it seemed that India would run away with it.\n\nInzamam and Youhana turned it all around with an outstanding partnership of 135 from a mere 20 overs. Not only did they press on the accelerator, they did so with minimum risk, tonking the slow bowlers for straight sixes, and nurdling the seamers for ones and twos. Youhana finally played one lofted shot too many, but that only allowed Inzamam to take centre stage.\n\nNot allowing the pressure to get to him at any point, Inzamam turned it on with some scintillating batting, caressing fours to midwicket and square leg with a casual flick of the wrists, or making room to play some delectable strokes on the off side equally effortlessly. Ganguly switched the bowling around, but except for Sehwag, none of the bowlers made even a semblance of an impression. Inzamam's fourth-wicket stand with Younis Khan yielded 109 before Inzamam finally perished, nicking one from Kartik to Dravid (278 for 4).\n\nYounis and Abdul Razzaq ensured that the momentum didn't slip away, running hard between the wickets and finding the boundary frequently. Kartik swung the match India's way again, bowling Younis for 46, while Zaheer's slower ball did for Razzaq. Then came another twist in the tale, when Mohammad Kaif pulled off an amazing running catch to dismiss Shoaib Malik, running around from long-off, diving, and clinging on to the ball even as he almost collided with Hemang Badani. That catch came off the penultimate ball of the 49th over, and Pakistan approached the last over needing nine to win.\n\nAshish Nehra, the man chosen for the task, did a nerveless job, bowling full and on the stumps. Naved-ul-Hasan swished and missed at the first one, but stole a single off the next. Moin Khan failed to get a yorker away, and only managed a single off the fourth ball. When Hasan took a run off the fifth, it required Moin to hit a six off the last ball. Javed Miandad was gesturing furiously from the stands - he obviously had a right to do so, having smashed a memorable last-ball six off Chetan Sharma to win a thriller at Sharjah back in 1986 - but all of that was to little effect, as Moin spooned a full-toss to Zaheer at extra cover. The match was India's.\n\nWhen Pakistan look back on the match, they will probably identify their lack of discipline in the field as the primary reason for the defeat. Pakistan got the best of the bowling conditions - the pitch afforded plenty of bounce and some seam early on - but made a mess of it, sending down a shocking 20 no-balls and 10 wides. The Indians, on the other hand, bowled just two no-balls and seven wides.\n\nThe trend was set in a frenetic first over in the Indian innings. Shoaib Akhtar, visibly keyed up for the battle with Tendulkar, bowled a nine-ball first over which included a couple of wides and no-balls. He began his second over with another no-ball, off which Tendulkar was caught at square leg, and then saw insult added to injury later in that same over when Tendulkar top-edged a hook for six.\n\nAt the other end, Sehwag went on his merry way, slashing and swinging through the off side with gay abandon. Shoaib got Pakistan the breakthrough, when Tendulkar guided a drive to Hasan at backward point (69 for 1) for 28, but that only set the stage for a breathtaking onslaught by Sehwag.\n\nHasan, all of two ODIs old in international cricket, bowled four no-balls in his first five deliveries, and disappeared for 24 in the over, while Razzaq was smashed for three fours in his opening over. Sehwag was finally bowled by a beautifully disguised slower ball from Hasan (142 for 2), but with 143 from the first 15 overs, the platform had been laid.\n\nDravid and Sourav Ganguly then kept it going with a run-a-ball partnership of 72, but Pakistan had an opportunity to claw back when both Ganguly (47) and Yuvraj Singh were dismissed in quick succession. India were 220 for 4 in the 29th over, and with no VVS Laxman - a knee injury in the nets had ruled him out - a couple of further wickets would have exposed the Indian tail rather early. Dravid and Kaif ensured it didn't happen.\n\nDravid played another gem, continuing the rich vein of form he showed in Australia. He seldom played unorthodox strokes, but kept the runs coming with clever nudges and deflections. He didn't miss out on the boundaries either - a couple of straight-drives off Razzaq early in the innings were among the shots of the innings.\n\nKaif was equally composed, cutting out the risky strokes early in his innings, but putting pressure on the fielders with some blistering running between the wickets. Their vital 118-run stand ensured that India got up to 349. In the end, that turned out to be just enough.\n\nS Rajesh is assistant editor of Wisden Cricinfo.\n\nWith three and a half days of almost flawless cricket, India not only bettered their thundering victory at Multan for magnitude, but won their first Test series away from home for an entire decade. It was also the first time they had won series in both formats on the same tour, discounting England in 1986, when they won the Tests but were awarded a tied one-day series on run-rate.\n\nFor Pakistan, the defeat brought to a head the impatience of a nation: two months later, the coach, Javed Miandad, was sacked. Veteran commentator Omar Kureishi described the fourth day, when they finally capitulated, as \"the blackest in Pakistan's cricket history\", though - match-fixing scandals aside - losing by an innings to Matthew Hayden's bat alone in October 2002 was surely worse.\n\nLike the previous Test, this match was made on day one. Bitten at Lahore, India chose to field when Ganguly, back from injury, continued Dravid's luck with the toss. There, India had been 107 for four at lunch; here, Pakistan were 96 for four. This included the key wicket of Inzamam-ul-Haq, set up beautifully when Nehra (who replaced Agarkar) had him hunch over an in-swinger before slanting one across for the nick.\n\nAny hopes of recovery were thwarted by Balaji, who extracted three wickets in a nine-over spell after the interval, bending away the middle-aged ball late in its trajectory to leave Pakistan tottering at 137 for eight. The top score was a committed 49 from Mohammad Sami, his highest in Tests; that and a comical 25 from Fazl-e-Akbar managed to lift Pakistan to a modest 224. As Ganguly reflected later, extracting the advantage with the ball on the opening day was perhaps the difference between this and his previous quests for an overseas victory. It led to his 15th win as captain, beating Mohammad Azharuddin's record for India.\n\nWith Ganguly's return, the debate for India revolved around the second opener. Chopra, Sehwag's regular partner, had failed twice at Lahore, whereas Yuvraj Singh had stroked an exceptional century. Chopra was dropped - but instead of Yuvraj or Ganguly climbing up as was indicated, the wicket-keeper, Patel, was promoted. Though the decision was poorly received, Patel vindicated it with a Test-best 69 while seeing out some crucial hours of play on the first evening and next morning.\n\nIt was a colossal 270 from Dravid that put the series beyond Pakistan. In its significance, the innings could stand alongside any ever played by an Indian. Even Dravid agreed, though, that he was not at his most fluent, particularly on the second day, which he ended unbeaten on 134. He was given the benefit of the doubt after an adjacent lbw shout on 21, carelessly dropped at point on 71, and again spared when caught behind off bat-and-boot on 77. In between, he mistimed more than he had sometimes done through entire tours.\n\nDravid's strength, however, is in raising his game when most needed. The following day he blossomed. He had already glued together the innings through century stands with Patel and, most delightfully, Laxman; he completed a third with Ganguly, and 98 with Yuvraj. It was a phenomenal physical effort. Between his 73 overs in the field and 175 overs at the crease lay a mere ten-minute break: Sehwag had been out first ball. In all, Dravid batted 12 hours 20 minutes - India's longest Test innings - faced 495 balls, and struck 34 fours and a six. His fifth Test double-hundred was an Indian record, one ahead of Sunil Gavaskar.\n\nDravid's task was made simpler when, late on the second afternoon, Shoaib Akhtar fell in his follow-through and injured his left thumb and a rib, soon after castling Laxman with a rapid out-swinging full toss. He left the field after six further balls and did not return except to bat. It was the last thing Pakistan needed: their bowling had already been depleted by the absence of Umar Gul, whose replacement, Fazl-e-Akbar, churned out dross to the tune of 162 runs for a single wicket in 41 overs. Dravid finally fell on the third evening attempting, of all things, to reverse-sweep Imran Farhat's part-time leg-spin. Seven runs later, India were out for an even 600. As in the first innings, the Pakistan openers fell in consecutive overs, leaving the others to battle back from 327 runs behind with two days remaining.\n\nThey did not even come close, despite the best efforts of India's fielders, who dropped six catches in the first hour next morning, four of them off Balaji. But the potency of his swing, exaggerated by cloud cover, could not be repressed. Before lunch, he added two more wickets, including Inzamam with a peachy away-curler and, between those two, Patel held a superb diving catch down the leg side off Yasir Hameed's glance. For Pakistan, the only pride came via Asim Kamal, defiantly unbeaten on 60 despite a painful elbow.\n\nThere was a final twist when Shoaib came out and smote a manic 14-ball 28, all in boundaries, which contrasted greatly with his mulish obduracy in the previous Test. Eyebrows were raised, Inzamam hurled a few barbs moments after the defeat, and Shaharyar Khan and Ramiz Raja, the PCB chairman and chief executive officer, questioned Shoaib's commitment to the team. They ordered a \"medical inquiry commission\" to see if he had exaggerated his injury or not; it led to further estrangement and nothing more.\n\nRahul Bhattacharya\n\nThe imbalance between bat and ball was redressed so abruptly that it felt unreal. Irfan Pathan (two for 319 in the series before now) took a hat-trick with the last three balls of the first over. His pace - or the lack of it, a recurring theme for India's bowlers - mattered less than the movement in the air and from the surface: the pitch was as green and lively as the others had been brown and dull, and had early-morning bite. Salman Butt had to play, but only edged to slip; Younis Khan had to play, though not across the line, and was lbw; Mohammad Yousuf had to play, though not drive, to one that virtually spun through his stumps. No hat-trick had been taken so early in a Test - though Nuwan Zoysa did it with the first three balls of the second over at Harare in 1999-2000 - and none could have been so unexpected.\n\nZaheer Khan followed up with two wickets and, when R. P. Singh got Imran Farhat, Pakistan were 39 for six halfway into the 11th over. A total of fifty looked ambitious. Kamran Akmal faced an immediate lbw appeal, but avoided the duck with a looping cut past gully for four, and the salvage had begun.\n\nSimply by moving back first, Akmal countered the ball's movement, a tutorial for his upper order. In defence, he remained unyielding; in attack, he was equally sure. But in its entirety, the innings served a double purpose, simultaneously quelling disaster and propelling a feisty, pacy counter-attack. Before his arrival, there had been 12 hundreds in this series. He reached a lucky 13th off 130 balls, and it was by a distance the most substantial and meaningful; with it came the winning and losing of the match. It was not flawless - he should have been stumped on 80 - but those who witnessed it are likely to remember it vividly. Akmal added 115 with the composed Abdul Razzaq and 82 with the more energetic Shoaib Akhtar before Pathan returned to complete his first five-for in a Test innings against established opposition. Pakistan were all out after tea for 245, many more than they could have hoped for that morning.\n\nDespite Akmal, the contest could still have gone in many directions; it was Pakistan's bowling, on paper a man short, that eventually decided the route. Without Inzamam-ul-Haq because of a bad back, the selectors had again done nothing to reinforce the attack, and fielded only three fast bowlers - Akhtar, Mohammad Asif and Razzaq - against India's renowned batsmen. By the close of the first day, however, the top four had gone for 74.\n\nThe attack's strength lay in its variety. Asif, lanky of height and healthy of pace, moved the ball in and away. With minuscule away movement, he found Dravid's edge and, with sharper cut-back, the gap between Laxman's bat and pad. Bowling tight lines and difficult lengths, Asif made it hard to believe this was only his third Test, and justified coach Bob Woolmer's assessment of him as Pakistan's most improved bowler over the past year. Razzaq proved a potent sidekick, bowling as he had done early in his career. His selection had been viewed as defensive, but his only Test five-for had come on this ground, and he toyed with length, line and pace to exploit whatever there was in the surface. It was Razzaq's best all-round Test performance, and he knew it. Each time he got a wicket - especially Tendulkar, bowled on the first evening - he celebrated as if he had never taken one before.\n\nAsif and Razzaq shared seven wickets in the first innings, to secure Pakistan a sevenrun lead, and 14 in the match. But behind both lurked the threat of Shoaib Akhtar. When would he come? What would he do? How quick would he be? He hit Tendulkar's helmet flush, rattled Yuvraj Singh, dismissed Sehwag early in the first innings and Dravid early in the second - and shook India every time he stirred.\n\nIn contrast, India's bowling was monotone: one pace, one angle. They let Pakistan off the hook on the first day, and let them cut loose over the next two. Only once in Test history had seven batsmen reached 50 in a single innings, for England against Australia at Manchester in 1934 (and Sri Lanka would do so at Lord's less than four months later). But, uniquely, Pakistan's top seven all got fifties. This time it took India 25 overs to claim their first wicket, through the unlikely agency of Ganguly. Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousuf shared their fourth century stand of the series. Faisal Iqbal, recalled for his first Test in three years because of Inzamam's absence, scored a punchy maiden hundred, mostly off the back foot: an innings that started to dispel the shadow of his uncle, Javed Miandad. As the fourth day dawned, Pakistan were already 518 ahead; the only questions were when the acting-captain, Younis, would declare, and how long India might survive. Younis called time when Razzaq fell ten short of his hundred, leaving India five and a half sessions... and a target of 607.\n\nThey lasted four and a half hours. After Akhtar's first-over strike, Asif bowled three of the top four, and Razzaq worked through the middle. Yuvraj blazed out a final act of defiance, the 15th hundred of the series to equal the record for three Tests set by England and India in 1990, but in essence it was futile. The loss of their fourth wicket at 56 in the first innings and 74 in the second suggested where India's problems lay. When Yuvraj was last out, Pakistan had turned their disastrous start into their biggest victory in terms of runs, a remarkable comeback, and a fitting conclusion to a successful home Test season.\n\nInzamam-ul-Haq played one of the innings of his life to save Pakistan from humiliation and break Bangladeshi hearts. On the third afternoon, Bangladesh's first Test win, so desperately longed for during three years of demoralising defeat, was within touching distance. On a pitch helping seamers, Pakistan were 132 for six - still 129 short of victory.\n\nBut Inzamam stood firm for five hours 17 minutes, and his unbeaten 138 guided Pakistan home. It was only the tenth one-wicket win in Test history, and Inzamam had now been at the crease for two of them. While the 1994-95 victory over Mark Taylor's Australians came at Karachi, this triumph was in front of his home crowd, who showered him in rose petals as he left the field.\n\nIt was cruel for Bangladesh. They dominated from the word go, and despite Inzamam's heroics might still have won, given a bit more luck. But things went against them on the fourth morning. First, Hannan Sarkar at second slip dropped Shabbir Ahmed on nought. It was perhaps the most costly miss in Bangladesh's short Test history: Shabbir and Inzamam went on to add 41 for the eighth wicket.\n\nLater, with 49 now needed, eight wickets down and Inzamam farming the strike, the No. 10 Umar Gul survived a run-out despite being beaten by a direct hit. The crestfallen bowler, Mohammad Rafiq, had brushed the stumps and dislodged the bails before the ball struck. In the same over, Rafiq sportingly chose not to run out Gul when he was backing up too far. By the time Gul was finally run out, after a bad call from Inzamam, they had added 52. Gul's contribution was five.\n\nFour runs were now needed, five balls remained in the over and the No. 11 coming to the striker's end was Yasir Ali - a 17-year-old on first-class debut, with only a handful of junior games and a hurried lunchtime batting lesson from Javed Miandad, the Pakistan coach, behind him. But Yasir kept out three balls and then tickled a single into the leg side. Off the last delivery of the over, Inzamam flicked the winning boundary. Ramiz Raja, the former Test batsman, now chief executive of the PCB, called it \"one of the best Test innings of modern times\". That might have been a little overblown, but Inzamam's concentration had been steely and his hitting authoritative. Supporters rushed on to the field to hug their local hero.\n\nFor this final Test, Pakistan had made five changes, three of them enforced: Shoaib Akhtar had returned to Durham, while Shoaib Malik and Taufeeq Umar were injured. But the decision to rest Yousuf Youhana and Danish Kaneria, and to include three debutants, raised a few eyebrows. Pakistan nearly paid the price.\n\nAfter two placid wickets in Karachi and Peshawar, the Multan pitch had a hint of grass, and the pace bowlers found considerable movement. Given the conditions, Bangladesh's batsmen did very well to reach 281, after Khaled Mahmud made the brave decision to bat first. Habibul Bashar hit 72 - his fourth innings of fifty-plus in the series - and again led the way. However, Shabbir Ahmed took three wickets in six balls to mop up the tail rapidly.\n\nThe Bangladeshi bowlers did even better than their batsmen. Pakistan were restricted to 175: Mahmud, whose form had been lousy, seamed the ball around and took the first four wickets to fall. After that, Mohammad Rafiq, with another five-wicket haul, took over. Just before tea on the second day, Bangladesh had a lead of 106 runs - and every right to start dreaming of victory.\n\nBut Pakistan fought back, dismissing them for 154 in a second innings twice delayed by sand storms. However, the biggest tumult involved Pakistan's captain and wicketkeeper, Rashid Latif. After diving to catch an edge from Alok Kapali, Latif claimed a catch. The umpires, who were unsighted as Latif rolled over on landing, gave it out. But TV replays clearly showed the ball briefly dropping out of Latif's gloves and on to the ground as he tumbled. The Bangladesh team management lodged a complaint to match referee Mike Procter, and Latif was later banned for five one-day internationals.\n\nHis temporary replacement was - almost inevitably - Inzamam. Having begun the series battling for a place in the side, he ended it with his career revived.\n\nA typically elegant, clipped on-drive for four off Corey Collymore took Mohammad Yousuf from 44 to 48 on the fourth day of the final Test between Pakistan and the West Indies at Karachi. A modest raise of the bat acknowledged that the drive also took him past one of the longest-standing records in cricket, of most runs in a calendar year.\n\nSir Viv Richards scored 1710 runs in 1976, a memorable run during which he hit two double hundreds against England in England and the closest anyone had come to it since was Ricky Ponting in 2005, with 1544 runs.\n\nBy day's end, Yousuf added another century to the eight he had made already this year. He told reporters at the end of the day, \"God has helped me break this record and I am extremely happy and proud for my country because whenever the record is discussed now, it will be with the name of a Pakistani batsman.\"\n\nThe day began with Yousuf needing a further 47 runs to break the record and knowing it too. \"I was under a little pressure in the morning,\" he admitted. \"I knew what had to be done and luckily I was able to do it in the end.\"\n\nYousuf's final tally for the year is 1788 runs from 11 Tests, and 665 of them have come from the series against West Indies, the highest tally recorded by a Pakistani batsman in a three-Test series. He began his run with two hundreds in the home series against India. He only played a solitary Test in Sri Lanka, personally an unmemorable one, but a double century at Lord's sparked off a stunning second half of the year.\n\nTwo more hundreds came from the remaining three Tests in England, including 192 at Headingley. He ended the year with three hundreds in three Tests against the West Indies at home.\n\nDuring the course of this magnificent run, a few more records fell. His first-innings hundred at Karachi meant that he had scored eight Test hundreds this year alone, going past the previous best of seven, held jointly by Richards and Aravinda de Silva. By scoring five hundreds in five consecutive Tests, he also became only the third man, along with Jacques Kallis and Sir Don Bradman (six hundreds in six Tests) to do so.\n\nYousuf also had praise for Bob Woolmer, Pakistan's coach, and Mushtaq Ahmed for the part they have played in his game over the last year. \"I changed the way I practiced. Mushy really helped during the England tour and in India,\" he said. \"He made me practice with slabs to be able to play rising deliveries better and that has really helped.\n\n\"Since Bob has been with us, he has really sorted out my balance. I used to have some problems with it before but he has really helped me set it properly now and it was a big change.\"\n\nComparisons with greats were avoided as deftly as bouncers have been over the last year. When asked to compare himself with Javed Miandad, Yousuf said only, \"It is difficult to compare. You are either better or worse and anyway, it is for the media to decide. I can't say anything about it. But he is my ideal.\" And when the question of Sir Don Bradman's record of six hundreds in six consecutive Tests reared its head, Yousuf replied, with some cheek, \"I have six in five Tests, so you decide.\"\n\nReactions to the recorord'\n\nBob Woolmer\n\nIt is a marvellous achievement. I have had the honour of playing against Viv Richards and coaching Yousuf. Both are very different in their styles, Viv was a lot more aggressive and Yousuf more sedate but to break Viv's record is really an outstanding achievement.\n\nBrian Lara\n\nIt's excellent and slightly unbelievable what he has achieved. Nine hundreds in a year and that many runs is just magnificent. He is a very committed player and an excellent role model, not just for Pakistan but for young cricketers everywhere. He's had an amazing year, though the last 600 runs that he has scored I haven't really enjoyed.\n\nSanjay Manjrekar\n\nThe most striking thing about Yousuf at the moment is that it is as if he is batting in a trance. He is so calm at the crease and that mental change is the most striking change from last year. You know people will say that he played on flat tracks, against weak attacks at times but that is neither here nor there. He still had to break a big record and he has done it. What's good to see, apart from the calm demeanour, is that he is, like all good batsmen, cashing in on good form and making the most of that period.\"\n\nNasim Ashraf\n\nPakistan is very proud of his achievements and he will be honoured by the PCB after the match.\n\nHanif Mohammad\n\nWe are proud of what he has done and I hope this is the start of of something great for him.\n\nRameez Raja\n\nHe's been absolutely brilliant this year and has done it against good teams in India, England and the West Indies and has done it home and away. I don't think he has made any technical adjustments as such, but he is so sound mentally now. Religion has played an integral part in his growth not just as a cricketer but as a person. I used to doubt his ability to see Pakistan through in situations before but he has rescued Pakistan from precarious positions through the year. A superb achievement.\n\nShane Bond blazed through India's top order and later prised open a threatening partnership between Jai P Yadav and Irfan Pathan to take New Zealand to victory by 51 runs in the second match of the Videocon Cup in Bulawayo. The pair had put on 118 after Bond's initial spell left India at 44 for 8 and, just as visions of an improbable victory arose, he returned to dash Indian hopes conclusively, ending with 6 for 19.\n\nIn seven opening overs of super mayhem, Bond took 5 for 13, and demonstrated that for all the supersubs, powerplays and other hyperbolic terms added to rejuvenate the game, the sport - like other sports - is sustained by drama involving the participants; it should make for a good story. The first over was a tale by itself. Sourav Ganguly opened, and Bond had the new ball. The first ball, slanted across at great pace, looped up off a protective prod and fell between the two. The next, pitched short outside leg, climbed past Ganguly's chest above off, barely giving him time to register the ball. The third, a similar delivery but pushed further up, was fended without conviction. The fourth, again short and cutting across, carried the threat of injury but Ganguly evaded it reflexively. Cricket at this pace had become all about adrenaline, bravery and instinct by the batsman. And one delivery after another, Bond was dissecting the batsman's tools, laying him bare. Yet only four balls had gone by. The fifth was a repeat of the fourth. Even Bond's run-up was intimidating now. The force with which he delivered the last ball was like a farewell explosion, aimed at the head, the edge, the batsman's self-respect. Somehow Ganguly survived. His weaknesses were well-known; Bond hit all the right pressure points.\n\nThe next over Bond picked him off with a short ball down leg which was gloved to the wicketkeeper. The next ball Venugopal Rao, the supersub, was late on a super-quick inswinging yorker that slammed into the stumps. Rahul Dravid then tried cutting a short incoming delivery and chopped it onto his stumps. Mohammad Kaif cut one as well, and it carried to the fielder at third man. Then Virender Sehwag, who had begun his innings with a pulled four, slashed one to point and found a sprawling Hamish Marshall in the way.\n\nFor a while, when Yadav and Pathan batted, Bond's effort could have been in danger. No other bowler appeared threatening; Andre Adam's wickets came due to the pressure Bond applied as batsmen looked to lash out at the other end. Once Bond went off, Yadav and Pathan set about rebuilding and drawing India closer to 216. They crossed their fifties quickly, enjoying fair luck, but also striking calculated fours. Yadav swept Vettori powerfully and delicately, and swung him over midwicket for six, while Pathan preferred the lofts down the ground for his boundaries. On 50 he departed, flaying at a quick delivery from Bond that caught the edge and traveled to the keeper. That was more or less it for India. Three balls later, Yadav mis-hit one to mid-off to end it all.\n\nYou wouldn't have known it, but India started the day on top. Ashish Nehra stuck to a line outside off for the left-handers and slanted it across for the others. He curved the ball late and experimented with his length without offering room, and this had the effect of rooting the batsmen to the crease. Stephen Fleming nicked one. Nathan Astle, paralysed, was trapped lbw. Pathan trapped Lou Vincent in front and did Marshall and Scott Styris in as well. At 36 for 5, New Zealand were a few wickets away from a low total.\n\nBut Agarkar was brought in and he provided width at a friendly pace. In three overs to Craig McMillan and Styris he conceded 17 runs and was taken off. The morning's pressure slowly dissipated and just as gradually, the batsmen found their feet. Oram swung Harbhajan for large sixes over long-on and mid-off. McMillan took few risks after surviving an lbw shout on zero and then powerfully smote Yadav over long-on for six. After they parted Brendon McCullum and Cairns accelerated, combining deft touch with powerful blows over cover. But just as he got started, Cairns fell, lightly swinging a Yadav ball to Harbhajan at short fine-leg. However, McCullum went on, twice hitting Nehra through the off-side for fours in an over and taking two off Agarkar as well, before falling last man, to Agarkar, with seven overs remaining.\n\nIndia have been undone by quick bowlers before, but rarely have they been unable to place bat on ball this way. It was utterly demoralizing and, like Miandad's last-ball six, could have lasting effects on a line-up unsure of itself.\n\nPakistan's hope of becoming the first team from their country to win a series in the West Indies was dashed at the last by a match-winning stand of 61 between Dujon and Benjamin, who came together at 207 for eight with West Indies needing another 59 to win and defeat in sight. Their unbeaten ninth-wicket stand enabled West Indies to square the series half an hour after lunch on the final day.\n\nWest Indies went into the match unchanged; Pakistan brought in Aamer Malik and Saleem Jaffer for Ijaz Ahmed and Ijaz Faqih. Put in, the Pakistanis batted at times well, at times carelessly, and they needed the scintillating eighth-wicket partnership for 67 between Salim Yousuf and Wasim Akram to ensure that earlier good work by Ramiz, Shoaib and Aamer was not wasted. They put on 50 in five overs, but in attempting to hook Marshall, Yousuf managed only to deflect the ball on to his face, breaking his nose in two places. Marshall followed up with two wickets to end the innings, Qadir becoming his 250th Test wicket. With Yousuf injured, Aamer Malik kept wicket in both innings for Pakistan.\n\nWest Indies made a poor start on the second morning, but Hooper played well for 54, Haynes grafted for 286 minutes for his 48, and Richards blasted a dynamic 67 from 80 balls, his fifty coming from 51 balls. When 61, he became the third West Indian to score 7,000 runs in Tests. However, a close-of-play score of 226 for eight reflected a position lost: West Indies had been 198 for three until Mudassar sent back Haynes and Logie with successive balls. Marshall and Benjamin pulled their side back with a ninth-wicket partnership of 58 at almost a run a minute, Marshall's 48 from 62 balls containing a six and six fours. West Indies finished just 3 runs adrift, and when Pakistan slumped to 177 for six by the close, they appeared to have gained the upper hand. Shoaib and Mudassar had put on 94 for a second wicket, Shoaib compiling his second fifty of the match, but in the final hour Pakistan had lost wickets quickly. Miandad was caught at the wicket, Aamer was brilliantly taken by Logie at forward short-leg, and Salim Malik fell to Benjamin after being softened up by Marshall.\n\nOn the fourth morning, Imran and injured Yousuf added 52 for the eighth wicket, with Yousuf, dropped first ball by Richards and having to bat some of the time with a runner because of dizziness, making a brave 28. Imran finished unbeaten with 43, having seen another 85 runs added that day. By the close, honours were about even, with Haynes, Greenidge, Richardson, Hooper and Logie out and a further 112 needed. But when Ambrose the night-watchman, and Richards fell in the first 35 minutes next morning, and Marshall was lbw to Wasim, victory was in Pakistan's grasp. Instead, Benjamin and Dujon snatched it away from them, Benjamin finally hitting the winning boundary off Qadir.\n\nIt had not been a happy day for the Pakistani leg-spinner. Denied two confident appeals for lbw and a catch off Dujon, he had allowed himself to get involved with a heckler on the boundary. A punch was thrown, the heckler was hit, and $US1,000 were paid to the offended party in an out-of-court settlement so that Qadir would not have to remain in Barbados to face charge\n\nIn a nail-biting finish to a dramatic final day which had seen each side achieve a match-winning position, Abdul Qadir, the No. 11 batsman, survived the last five balls from Richards to maintain Pakistan's lead in the series. Requiring 372 to win, Pakistan were 31 runs short of victory after Javed Miandad had drawn them nearer and nearer the target with a flawless 102 compiled over seven hours seven minutes. His seventeenth Test hundred, it came from 240 balls and contained seven fours and a five. On his dismissal, in the over before the last twenty overs began, 84 were still needed; but when Marshall dismissed the hard-hitting Wasim Akram at 311 the odds favoured West Indies. Salim Yousuf and Ijaz Faqih defended tenaciously until the last over, when Yousuf's dismissal, lbw to the first ball, brought in Qadir to play out the last tense scene.\n\nPakistan were unchanged from the First Test, but West Indies were able to bring back Richards and Marshall, and Benjamin retained his place because Patterson was unfit. Put in, West Indies lost Greenidge to the last ball of the Imran's first over and Haynes with only 25 on the board. Richardson and Logie added 55, and a stand of 58 in thirteen overs between Richards and Dujon improved the situation. Richards struck 49 in 43 balls with eight fours, and when he was seventh out, Imran and Qadir quickly wrapped up the innings, each finishing with four wickets. Imran, in bowling Walsh, became the fourth-highest wicket-taker in Tests.\n\nPakistan's jubilation was soon dashed as between tea and stumps they lost five wickets for 55. Two more wickets fell on the second morning for the addition of only 13 runs, but Malik and Yousuf dropped when 3 by Dujon, put on 94 valuable runs, a record for Pakistan's eighth wicket against West Indies. Malik batted 171 minutes for his 66. By the close, West Indies were 58 ahead with Haynes, Greenidge and Logie all out to Imran. The third day's play was dominated by Richards, who reached his 22nd Test century in 232 minutes off 134 balls. He soon lost Richardson, who the previous afternoon had passed 2,000 Test runs, but found support from Hooper and Dujon in stands that yielded 94 and 97 runs respectively. Early in the day, when he was 25, Richards became embroiled in a dispute with the Pakistan fielders, threateningly waving his bat at Yousuf after an appeal for lbw off Imran's bowling had been rejected by umpire Cumberbatch. Imran protested to the umpire about Richards's behaviour, and the situation was soon defused. In the later stages of his innings, Richards was suffering from cramp and nausea.\n\nBy the close of the third day, Qadir had taken his 200th Test wicket, that of Marshall, but Dujon was still there, and next morning he added 90 runs for the last two wickets with Benjamin and Walsh. He also completed his fifth Test hundred, having batted for five and a quarter hours and hit thirteen fours. Imran and Qadir again took the major share of the wickets. By lunch Pakistan had begun their second innings. Ramiz provided them with an attacking start, but when he was the third wicket to fall in the space of 7 runs, Miandad and Salim Malik withdrew to a defensive position. It was only after the rest day that Miandad, adding 113 for the sixth wicket with the nineteen-year-old Ijaz Ahmed, raised the prospect of victory. With their dismissals, first of Ijaz and then Miandad, Pakistan's most realistic chance disappeared.\n\nAt Kolkata in 1987, India breathed a sigh of relief when they dismissed Miandad cheaply during another Pakistan run-chase. But like a bolt from the blue came Salim Malik, who smashed 72 from 36 balls from No. 7 and shepherded the tailenders past the target.\n\nChandrakant Pandit\n\nMalik came in with around eight overs remaining and the asking-rate at around eight an over. To add to it, he lost Imran soon, and there weren't many others left to lend him a hand.\n\nManinder Singh had enough overs left and was bowling to Malik on middle and leg, trying to make him play to the on side, and not give away many runs. But Malik started sweeping it very fine and got quite a few runs that way.\n\nRavi Shastri and Lalchand Rajput were operating from the other end, and Malik was middling everything he faced from them. He was so calculating, nicely picking gaps for his singles, hitting boundaries mainly between square leg and midwicket, and taking last-ball singles to retain the strike.\n\nEden Gardens was reverberating with nervous energy. India were on top most of the time, but slowly, without our knowing it, Malik had taken the game away. We knew he was the danger man, but we couldn't keep him off strike. Maninder was trying to get him out by trying to beat him in the flight. But Malik picked everything so well that he easily pierced the five-man leg-side field.\n\nUnfortunately for Maninder, I missed stumping Malik when he had made 30-odd. It was an armer and Malik, going for the on-drive went onto the front foot and missed. The ball went off my gloves, and he got his foot back in time. You could say we lost the match there.\n\nPandit made 6 not out in India's innings, batting at No. 8. Interviewed by Nagraj Gollapudi.\n\nRameez Raja\n\nWhen Malik came in at 161 for 5, we didn't really think we had a chance - we needed about 80 runs still and there were no batsmen left apart from him. In those days, that sort of run-rate was considered impossible to achieve - we needed six an over at the start, which was high, and then when he came in, it was about eight or nine.\n\nWe only thought we were in with a chance with about four overs to go, and in particular after Malik blasted Kapil for five fours in an over. He square-drove him, hit him over fine leg, and through third man. Their field placings were just following the ball after that. Those boundaries were part of seven he hit in a row.\n\nAll India needed to do was control the boundaries; they had a fairly decent attack with Maninder and Roger Binny. But they couldn't. Malik seemed in complete control of the situation. And he did it single-handed.\n\nHe won it with another drive, typically wristy, through cover-point for another boundary. Amazing.\n\nRameez made 58 opening the innings for Pakistan. Interviewed by Osman Samiuddin.\n\n© Cricinfo\n\nWasim Raja was a glorious lefthanded strokemaker, who revelled in adversity, a useful legspinner, who also opened the bowling for Pakistan on occasions, and an outstanding, lithe cover fieldsman. He represented Pakistan in more than 100 international matches, coached the national side for a short while and had a spell as an ICC match referee, being in charge of the last Ashes series in Australia. He will always be remembered for the style and spirit in which he played the game, yet for such a mild-mannered and charming man he had his fair share of clashes with the Pakistan board. From a privileged background, he did not enjoy the hierarchy within the side, once refusing to hang out a senior player's socks to dry, but more importantly he always felt frustrated that he seemed to be picked on a match-by-match basis while a clique of senior players were omnipresent in the team. But for this, he might have captained Pakistan ahead of the more rumbustious Javed Miandad or diffident Zaheer Abbas. After all, as a batsman he was a prodigy at 18 and led the under-19 side. Quite often then he did not bother to wear pads when practising with his contemporary Imran Khan, who admitted that Wasim \"was in a different class altogether and was already batting with a maturity beyond his years\". He was the eldest of three boys, all of whom played first-class cricket. Ramiz followed him into the Test team and later captained Pakistan, while Zaeem played for National Bank. His father Raja Saleem Akhtar also played firstclass cricket, captaining Sargodha. Wasim made his first-class debut at 15, for Lahore, while still at school at Government College, went on to Punjab University, where he excelled at cricket and academically, getting a first in his Masters degree in politics, and came into the Test side in 1972-73, when called up as a replacement for the tour of New Zealand. He began to establish himself in 1974 in England, where he topped the tour averages. The \"exuberant\" Wasim played two innings at Lord's that Wisden described as \"masterly\", countering Derek Underwood on a drying wicket with selective attack. At home that winter he scored his maiden Test hundred against West Indies at Karachi. His innings was such a fine one that, instead of the usual handful of well-wishers that used to run on to the field to congratulate a batsman on reaching three figures, there was a full-scale invasion. In all he played 11 Tests against West Indies, against attacks including Andy Roberts, Malcolm Marshall, Joel Garner and Colin Croft, making 919 runs at 57.43, an average that only Greg Chappell exceeded during that era. He also had an excellent record against India, hitting two 90s on the 1978-79 tour when many of the other front-line batsmen crumpled under the pressure and ending the series with 450 runs at 56.25. He made his highest Test score against them - 125 not out at Jullundur - and had his best bowling figures, 4 for 50, with his under-utilised legspin in the same match. For a number of years he played Minor Counties cricket for Durham, where he met his future wife, Anne, also a useful cricketer. He studied for his teaching degree at the University. While there, a serious car accident nearly ended his life, never mind his playing days, but he eventually returned to the game, helping Durham win the UAU Championship in 1990 with a match-winning 50 in the final. He went on to teach geography and PE at Caterham School for 15 years. Wasim, who collapsed and died while playing cricket for Surrey over-50s at High Wycombe, is survived by his wife Anne, and his two sons, Ali and Ahmed.\n\nAdam Licudi"
