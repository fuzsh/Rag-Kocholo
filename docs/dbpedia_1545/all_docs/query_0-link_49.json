        "text": "Let’s\n\nsay that you run into a great story on your beat. Perhaps you are covering immigration and\n\nlearn of the mysterious death of a border patrol guard. Or you are an outdoors writer who learns\n\nabout a dramatic rescue of fishermen lost at sea. Or someone in your town wins the state’s\n\nbiggest lottery and decides to use the money to take a group of impoverished\n\nschool children on a trip around the world.\n\nIt’s a big story, all right, by any definition. But how will you cover it? In occasional episodes in conventional news\n\nstyle? In a long Sunday project? Or perhaps in a serial narrative?\n\nIf\n\nyou are working on such a story, apply the elements against these dozen\n\nstandards. See if they help clear both\n\nyour news sense and your craft opportunities.\n\n1.)\n\nThe serial narrative focuses on a single character. Most of the story is told\n\nthrough this character’s point of view.\n\nThere are a limited number of secondary\n\nor minor characters. If you have multiple characters and multiple story lines,\n\nit is better to choose the one-day story or the saga. As the story advances day\n\nto day, it is difficult for the reader to switch from character to character.\n\nIn my serial novel, “Ain’t Done Yet,” almost every detail is seen\n\nthrough the eyes of the main character, investigative reporter Max Timlin. Max\n\nappears in every chapter, and the reader sees what Max sees.\n\n2.) The\n\nserial narrative is best told in a single narrative line or plot, rather than\n\nthrough multiple threads or subplots.\n\nThe saga can sustain multiple threads,\n\nbut the serial cannot, with the possible exception of a story that goes back\n\nand forth between two characters to contrast or connect them: A Klansman and a\n\nblack preacher; an organ donor and a recipient. This does not mean that the story must be told in\n\nchronological order. Some narratives begin in the middle of things and then\n\nflash back.\n\n3.) The story\n\nhas enough plot twists, switchbacks, or surprises to create cliffhanger endings\n\nfor chapters.\n\nThe cliffhanger is one of the indispensable tools for\n\nserials and sagas. In the late 1940s, Republic Pictures produced many adventure\n\nserials for the movies, from westerns to science fiction. Each installment\n\nended with a car plunging off a cliff or a rocket ship colliding with an\n\nasteroid. It was all the incentive needed to return next week to the movie\n\nhouse. Cliffhangers need not be hyper-dramatic to work effectively. In his saga\n\nabout a high school production of the musical “West Side Story,” Ken Fuson makes us wait a day to learn which of\n\nthe competing girls lands the lead role. Tom French, a master of the form, refers\n\nto this narrative energy as “enforced waiting.” In most writing for\n\nnewspapers, we give away the ending early. In the serial, we make the reader\n\nwait.\n\n4.) The reporter\n\nhas a “golden source” from which to draw.\n\nOften this is\n\nthe main character, or someone who knows the main character very well. Such a\n\ncharacter may have suspicious motives for becoming an “open book,”\n\nbut in many cases good characters are willing to sacrifice their private selves\n\nfor a public good. Such characters may permit you to follow along, or to\n\naccompany them during private moments, or to interview them at length many\n\ntimes. In other cases, the golden source can be a document: a trial transcript,\n\na police investigation record, a journal or diary, a photo album or set of\n\nvideos. The details and scenes and dialogue you’ll need to write a serial\n\nnarrative require not only a golden source, but the kind of immersive reporting\n\nthat lets you see and hear some things with your own eyes and ears.\n\n5.) The narrative train has an engine.\n\nSt. Petersburg (Fla.) Times reporter Tom French coined the term\n\n“engine” to describe the overriding question the narrative seeks to\n\nanswer: Will the 15-year-old girl be convicted of killing her mother? Will the\n\ntransplant operation be successful? Will the painting turn out to be a fake or a priceless work of\n\nart? Will the Mexican man make it across the border safely? Will the old woman\n\nwho hits the lottery still be able to attend Wednesday-night bingo? Each one of\n\nthese is the engine to an actual serial narrative. As the last one indicates,\n\nserials need not be highly serious, although most are, perhaps to justify their\n\nlength. Before you write a word, ask yourself: What question will this serial\n\nanswer for the reader?\n\n6.) Narrative energy derives from one of the\n\nfollowing questions: “what happens next?” or “how did that happen?”\n\nor “what is learned or understood next?”\n\nIn “Three\n\nLittle Words,” the reader is driven by what happens next: Jane learns her\n\nhusband has AIDS, she gets tested herself, she gets the results of the test,\n\netc. In “Sadie’s Ring,” “the reader follows the author’s path of\n\nunderstanding from the time he was a boy: that people hate others for who they are, not what they do; that such hate can take\n\nritualistic forms; that families have secrets that when confronted can help\n\ncreate tolerance and acceptance. Some narratives can be fueled by more than one\n\nsuch question.\n\nCAUTION: If you\n\nhave to stop the narrative train numerous times for long explanatory passages,\n\nyou may have a series but not a serial. You can explain lots of stuff, with or\n\nwithout sidebars and graphics, in a series. In a serial, all explanations must\n\ntake place in the context of the story.\n\n7.) The story is character-driven as well as\n\nplot-driven.\n\nThis excellent distinction is drawn by Jan Winburn, now an editor\n\nat The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and\n\none of the experts on serial narratives. Jan argues that serials driven only by\n\nplot, where characterization is weak or thin, are much less satisfying than\n\nones in which a character grows and develops. I agree. In fact, plot-driven\n\nnarratives often lack the “golden source” that helps reveal\n\ncharacter.\n\nCAUTION: I have\n\nseen serials “fail” because the main character was not sufficiently\n\nsympathetic. A well-written serial about two sisters using artificial\n\ninsemination flopped when many readers in the community found them\n\nunsympathetic.\n\nANOTHER\n\nCAUTION: Just because you like a character does not mean all\n\nreaders will.\n\nAlthough some\n\nauthors strive for “seamless” narratives, most long stories lend\n\nthemselves to division into parts. Mark Bowden wrote one of the most successful\n\nserial narratives for The Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\n“Black Hawk\n\nDown” told the story of the war in Somalia, and Bowden wrote\n\nit in the form of a book it eventually became. It was left to his editor, David\n\nZucchino, to help the author divide it into the 29 parts that would serve the\n\nnewspaper and its readers. The number 29 is not arbitrary, although some\n\ndivisions seem to be. The number 29 means that the serial can run for a month and begin and end on a Sunday. Think of the\n\nlength of serials in these units: 8, 15, 22, 29. Each of these allows you to\n\nbegin and end on a Sunday. Most serials will comprise fewer chapters than\n\neight, and that’s a good thing. Remember: A newspaper can choose to run more\n\nthan one chapter on a single day. The chapter breaks give the editor the\n\ngreatest flexibility.\n\n9.)\n\nA place or habitat can be created for the story in the publication.\n\nSerial narratives run in the newspaper every day. They are called comic strips. They have\n\na “habitat” in the paper, a reliable place where readers can find\n\nthem. Over time, readers develop the “habit” of visiting their favorite characters as part of their daily\n\nroutines. The editor helps in this process of habituation by creating a home\n\nfor the serial. For “Three Little Words,” a 350-word prologue and\n\nphoto appeared on the front page, and the first\n\n850-word chapter appeared at the top of page 3A. Each\n\nsubsequent chapter appeared in the same place, where readers could easily find it, and where it could be insulated\n\nfrom the unpredictable rhythms of breaking news. Serial chapters always work\n\nbest when they don’t jump pages, but many times\n\nthat is impossible.\n\n10.)\n\nThe daily installments can be measured by ART: Approximate Reading Time.\n\nIn my professional life as a writer, I’ve\n\nbeen asked to measure my story in words, picas, column inches and pages. Why not,\n\ninstead, measure a story, or a chapter, according to the time it takes to read?\n\nThis will vary with the reader’s ability and circumstances, but a rule of thumb\n\nis that a reader can read 100 words in 33 seconds. We can round it off to 200 a\n\nminute. A well-written 1,000 chapter can be read in five minutes. All stories\n\nshould justify their lengths, but one of the unspoken secrets in American\n\nnewsrooms is that many journalists don’t bother to read the longest stories in\n\ntheir own newspapers. They’re busy. They don’t have the time. They, too, get\n\ntheir news online.\n\n11.)\n\nThe theme of the story touches on something important: public service,\n\ncommunity interest, social relevance, war and its effects.\n\nI’ve chosen to write\n\nmy serials about big themes: AIDS (the plague of the 20th century); the\n\nHolocaust (the crime of the 20th century); and the millennium (the end of the\n\n20th century). These big themes must be communicated through the lives and\n\nstories of specific people. It’s hard, but not impossible, to justify\n\npublication of a serial narrative that lacks an imposing social purpose. You\n\nshould try to state that purpose early in the process, share it with your\n\neditor, and, if it works, exemplify it in your story.\n\n12.) There’s a payoff at the end.\n\nI’m not\n\ninsisting on a sappy, happy ending, the usual stuff of television dramas. I am\n\ninsisting on a “satisfying” ending, one that rewards the reader for the effort\n\nof having stuck with the serial. As two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Jon Franklin has noted many\n\ntimes, it is not necessary for the woman to have survived the brain operation.\n\nBut if she dies, it’s important to know that the doctor tried his best and will\n\nkeep trying to save lives. If your story is, in the end, dark, bleak, about\n\nbarbarism and despair, the serial will magnify those effects.\n\nOK. So you think you may have a serial. What now?\n\nYour newspaper has never published a story like that before. What are the arguments that the serial is\n\ngood for the reader and good for the newspaper?\n\nTomorrow: Chapter Three — A Story Form with Benefits"
