        "text": "Fine Art Sunset Photography\n\nSunset or sundown is the daily disappearance of the Sun below the horizon as a result of Earth’s rotation. The Sun will set exactly due west at the equator on the spring and fall equinoxes, each of which occurs only once a year.\n\nBasic Tips\n\nThe camera settings that Improve Photography recommends for a beginning photographer are:\n\n– Shoot in aperture priority mode (A or AV on your mode dial)\n\n– Put the camera on a tripod\n\n– Set your aperture to f/16\n\n– Set your ISO to 100\n\n– Let the camera set your shutter speed\n\n– Put the focus point 1/3 into the scene\n\nLinks to help you go deeper into sunset photography\n\nhttps://www.format.com/magazine/resources/photography/sunset-photography\n\nSunset-photography-camera-settings-beginners\n\nUpdate 3-23-2022\n\nIt was my birthday evening and my wife and I decided to go to Cape May Point to enjoy a beautiful sunset. I hope you like it. Please leave comments.\n\nA beautiful location for sunrise or sunset is Monument valley, Navajo County, Arizona. The silence in the valley is golden, I have never found a more quiet and golden source of light in the valley.\n\nAnother of my favorite places to watch the sunset and enjoy nature at the max is Shenandoah Valley, Skyline Drive, Sunset, VA\n\nAnother one from Shenandoah Valley, Skyline Drive, VA at Sky land\n\nFishing boats at Cape May Marina\n\nFishing boats at Cape May Marina\n\nSunset at Valley Forge State Park\n\nThe best sunset quotes of all time\n\nSunset is the opening music of the night.\n\nEvery sunset brings the promise of a new dawn.\n\nEvery sunset is an opportunity to reset.\n\nTwilight drops her curtain down and pins it with a star.\n\nIt is almost impossible to watch a sunset and not dream.\n\nsunset art for sale\n\nLast-hours-of-ancient-sunlight\n\nShenandoah-valley-2016\n\nsunset-loss\n\nShenandoah-sunset\n\nMore-virginia-farm-photos"
