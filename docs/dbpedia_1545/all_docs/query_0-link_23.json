As your team’s Metric Catalog grows, it can get tricky for non-metric creators to understand metric definitions when they are analyzing experiment results. 📜 Now you can simply hover over a metric to see a card with key details such as: - Metric definition - Input events - Possible dimensions to break down by - Statistical methods applied (like CUPED or Winsorization) This way, everyone in the organization is empowered to self-serve and better understand experiment results, including custom metrics. Check out the feature and track our latest updates across our fully-hosted (Cloud) and Warehouse Native offerings here: https://lnkd.in/g4D7Q9N3 #experimentation #abtesting #analytics #datascience\n\n\"Cloud is the future of data management,\" says, well, everyone.
