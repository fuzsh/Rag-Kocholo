Trying to identify a single data source for sustainability, impact and ESG data is the reason why there is a cry for standardisation. There are essentially two challenges: In all cases, there is no single system of sustainability, impact and ESG data set. Definitions are different, measurement is varied, with various pieces of data stored in different systems in different units. To add another level of challenge is the faux perception that data sets are complete, when those who use the data decry the patchiness of the current data sets. Work is still being done, but in some cases, similar data with similar attributes are held on different systems, but the values are different and there is no “effective” way to determine which one is accurate. As an extension, there is no way to identify which source data, held on which system truly represents “good”. Multiple players use multiple standards. The expectations is to clearly identify all standards and develop a single system to access all of the various standards. A single system that also collects the data and disseminates it in a timely basis."
