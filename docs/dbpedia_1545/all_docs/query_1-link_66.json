        "text": "Golden Source Registry\n\nThis appendix provides details of the Golden Source registry.\n\nThe Golden Source registry is the master registry responsible for maintaining, distributing, and updating registry configuration files to all the Cisco ANA units and the Cisco ANA gateway server. The master copy of the Golden Source files is centrally located on the gateway server, as follows:\n\n~sheer/Main/registry/ConfigurationFiles\n\n• /0.0.0.0 is the template folder used by the system.\n\n• /127.0.0.1 is the gateway sub-folder.\n\n• A sub-folder for each of the units.\n\nThese sub-folders are created during the installation procedure. Each sub-folder contains the relevant registry .xml files. These files can either be edited manually using Telnet and an editor, or using the Cisco ANA Registry Tool.\n\nThe screen below displays the registry files for each server and the Golden Source hives.\n\nFigure C-1 Registry Files And Golden Source Hives\n\nThe Golden Source mechanism enables consistent management of the entire system. Each unit and gateway has its own set of registry configuration files and parameters. The registry files are replicated automatically during the installation of the unit and gateway.\n\nEach time a unit and gateway process starts it accesses the Golden Source and retrieves the updated configuration. All additions and changes to the Golden Source are automatically sent to the relevant servers. Each unit keeps a local copy of its relevant registry files. When a unit cannot connect to the gateway, this local copy is used."
