        "text": "Florida has given men’s basketball coach Todd Golden a two-year contract extension, a source with direct knowledge of the agreement confirmed.\n\nGolden, in his second season, has Florida poised to return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2021. The Gators are 21-10 entering the SEC tournament, where they play Georgia on Thursday.\n\nFlorida is a projected No. 6 seed in The Athletic's Brian Bennett's latest projected bracket.\n\nNEW YORK — Welcome to the best day of the year, in my humble opinion — quarterfinal day at the Big East tournament. Sold-out Madison Square Garden, the top teams in action. It honestly doesn’t get better.\n\nStarting off with UConn is also not a bad way to get the ball rolling. The defending national champions look frighteningly better than even last year, and will bring more than their fair share of fans to New York. Pretty hefty lift for Xavier, I’m guessing, but weird things have a way of happening here.\n\nGreetings from the second day of Big Ten tournament action in Minneapolis. We begin with a pseudo-home game for Minnesota and a pseudo-worrisome game for Michigan State.\n\nThe world woke up Thursday to the Spartans sitting at a very healthy 23rd in the NET ratings and 19th on KenPom.com while also being an 18-13 team with three Quad 1 wins. This does not appear to be a bubble team needing to win to ensure a spot in the NCAA Tournament. But it might be a team needing to win to make sure it doesn't slide to a First Four matchup in Dayton.\n\nThe Athletic's resident Bracket Watch guru Brian Bennett has the Spartans as one of the last four byes in the field and a No. 10 seed as of Thursday morning. Not tenuous ... but also kind of tenuous?\n\nPut it this way: Michigan State lost by three just down the road at Williams Arena a month ago. It probably wants to avoid a repeat, to fully, completely ensure it avoids an extra leg in its NCAA Tournament journey.\n\nDePaul is aggressively pursuing former Ohio State coach Chris Holtmann, though no deal is done yet, a source briefed on the discussions said.\n\nThe Blue Demons ended the 2023-24 season with a 58-57 loss to Villanova on Wednesday in the Big East tournament. DePaul, which fired coach Tony Stubblefield in January — the first power-conference coaching change of this year — finished the season 3-29 and 0-20 in the Big East.\n\nOhio State fired Holtmann in the middle of his seventh season in February.\n\n6-6 freshman guard, Connecticut\n\nWhile Stephon Castle’s teammate, the massive sophomore Donovan Clingan, is a likely lottery pick, he’s also more of a known quantity at this point. (I wrote about Clingan after my visit to Hartford for UConn-Marquette last month.)\n\nCastle is the more challenging evaluation for scouts, a one-and-done playing as the fifth option on a stacked Huskies team trying to repeat as national champions. He seems clearly capable of more but also has some offensive limitations that could hold him back even at the next level. Most notably, his jump shot is inconsistent — he’s at 30.1 percent from 3 on low volume and has a slow release that at times looks as though his arms are fighting each other.\n\nHowever, Castle’s combination of size, ball skills and athleticism hints at bigger things. He wowed scouts with 14 points, six rebounds, four steals, three assists and nary a turnover in Connecticut’s rout of Providence this past weekend; on the season, he averages more than two dimes for every assist and, even with the giant Clingan soaking up so many boards, has an impressive 9.7 percent rebound rate in Big East play.\n\nCastle could really push into the top half of the lottery with a strong March, especially because scouts are still catching up on him after he missed time early in the season with a knee injury. Given the strength of his team, he may still have nine more games to showcase himself.\n\nRead more here.\n\nKansas doesn’t just have a health problem. Kansas has a shooting problem.\n\nOn Wednesday night after watching his team lose 72-52 against Cincinnati and shoot 3-of-20 from 3, four days after losing another game by 30 (!) when shooting 3-of-21 from 3, Bill Self compared the way his team is shooting the ball right now to shooting on those tiny rims at the county fair where the ball is almost too big to go in the basket.\n\n“We gotta get a swag back,” Self said. “Jeez. Guys are aiming the ball instead of shooting it.”\n\nThe asterisk on this one is that it was played without stars Hunter Dickinson and Kevin McCullar Jr., both injured but expected to play next week in the NCAA Tournament. But this problem runs a lot deeper than just two bad shooting nights with undermanned teams.\n\nRead more here."
