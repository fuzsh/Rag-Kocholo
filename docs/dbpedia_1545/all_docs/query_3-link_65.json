        "text": "How good are you at managing change?\n\nIn an increasingly cashless society, global card issuers and processors must manage a variety of payment instruments, including both physical and virtual cards, to reach target audiences. Card issuers face constant pressure from evolving markets, changing regulations, strict scheme compliance requirements and rising volumes, as more and more transactions move to card-based electronic payments.\n\nCard issuers and processors face challenges in privacy, tool rigidity, and to many manual processes. Luxoft offers a better way.\n\nThe CAMS II Solution\n\nCAMS II enables companies to deploy a digital credit card processing solution rapidly with fewer resources. It’s built on a proven, hyper-efficient, core, card-processing engine that processes over 500 million card accounts a day through a modern cloud solution.\n\nCAMS II creates an intuitive and seamless way to integrate, interact with and manage card-related business processes. It frees crucial client resources to focus on business-critical strategic analysis and drive positive business and customer outcomes.\n\nOur Vision for Card Management\n\nCAMS II is a proven solution used card issuers who want to control their own destiny instead of investing in rewriting legacy bespoke systems or relying on third parties offering SaaS payment card solutions.\n\nLuxoft and our trusted experts in global card processing best practices can transform your card processing business by recalibrating the machine, and tightly focusing on generating new business for your organization. We work with you to create an innovative credit card processing solution that deploys quickly and cost-effectively."
