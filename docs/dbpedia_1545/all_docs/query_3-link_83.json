        "text": "Why Deploy Product Master data management\n\nCreating, storing and accessing financial product-related data across a company’s different internal systems and multiple locations has become increasingly complex.\n\nCompetitive pressures dictate that time to market—from product idea to launch—has to be shorter. In order to measure and manage risk and performance, there must be a link between products and tradeable assets.\n\nOrganizations also need consistent data for regulatory compliance, reporting, and transparency (e.g. for Dodd-Frank, Basel III and MiFID II). Consistency of data is also necessary for descriptions to business lines and partners, fact sheets for clients, and fees charged.\n\nWith Product Master data management, your firm meets the challenge of efficient sourcing, onboarding and cross-referencing of information from diverse sources and systems.\n\nNot sure if you need one? Check out our Product Master 101 article here.\n\nFirms easily manage related workflows and consolidate, analyze, audit, update and distribute key product information to every sector of the company simultaneously.\n\nProduct Master Features"
