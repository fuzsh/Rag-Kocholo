        "text": "Benefits of GoldenSource Connections\n\nTime to Market\n\nOur Connections/Adaptors Module is a fully preconfigured software product. It can be installed within days, automatically loading data from a supported data vendor into GoldenSource Security Master or Customer Master, delivering validated data to your business.\n\nTo build similar functionality using generic data integration tools would take many months. The business analysis alone required to map a single source of data to a business application is estimated to take up to 5-7 man years.\n\nTotal Cost of Ownership\n\nRapid deployment and quick ROI are a first phase benefit. In addition, the ongoing maintenance supplied by GoldenSource for technical and metadata changes means the expense of developing and maintaining the necessary knowledge can be outsourced. GoldenSource has built a team of reference data experts that is unparalleled in the industry, and cost-effective access to these specialists is what our existing Connections customers value most.\n\nFuture Proof your Data Needs\n\nThe GoldenSource Connections/Adaptors Module allows you to develop new products and business lines without the restraints of data integration. Our development team proactively expands its suite of Connections in response to customer demand, allowing our customers to tap into the value of a centralized, specialized reference data knowledge center.\n\nConnections maximizes your Enterprise Data Management investment\n\nGoldenSource Connections allow easy visibility into data quality across multiple vendors if required. By shortening the time needed to create a validated golden copy from standard sources, implementations can focus on distributing the golden copy to downstream applications, where the business value of high-quality data is realized."
