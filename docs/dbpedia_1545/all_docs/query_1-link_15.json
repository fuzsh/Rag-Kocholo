        "text": "You're the risk manager for one of the world's largest investment banks. You've got billions of derivative bets and feel confident that you know all the counter-parties and their financial condition.\n\nOver the weekend, one of those counter-parties surprises the world by filing for bankruptcy. Suddenly you discover your bank is at much bigger risk than you thought and exposed to unexpected losses due to poor data. Two weeks later, with a push from the government, your employer is merged out of existence and you are out of a job.\n\nMaking sure this never happens again is the mission of GoldenSource, a software company that helps Wall Street manage data for critical functions such as risk management. GoldenSource was a division of International Business Machines (IBM) that former CEO Lou Gerstner divested in 1994 to refocus and raise cash. Invus, a private equity firm founded by an ex-Boston Consulting Group (BCG) consultant, bought it.\n\nMichael Chow is GoldenSource's Director of Global Marketing and Corporate Development. In a June 2 interview, he told me about his interesting journey to that job. He was a Mayfield Fellow at Stanford, an elite group of 12 top engineering students, who went to work at BCG following graduation. One of his more interesting assignments was to build financial scenarios for the government's restructuring of General Motors (GM).\n\nAfter BCG, Chow joined GoldenSource. His mission is to boost its growth. And it already leads the $200 million market growing at 30% a year for software that does what he dubbed Enterprise Data Management (EDM).\n\nEDM solves a fundamental problem in large capital market organizations -- they are broken into different departments by products and geographies which often have different ways of storing and reporting their information. This data includes\n\nIdentifiers of their financial instruments -- such as stocks, bonds, and derivatives,\n\nPositions,\n\nTransaction details, and\n\nCustomer and counter-party data.\n\nThese differences are important because the inability to aggregate and compare information distributed across the enterprise means that a risk manager trying to figure out the bank’s exposure to a counter-party can’t get a quick look at all the relationships that the bank might have with that counter-party in all of these different departments.\n\nEDM solves this problem by putting all the different departments into the same data model. Without getting into all the details of how the technology works, GoldenSource is able to handle many different ways of storing data — putting, say, a dozen so-called security masters into one centralized \"golden copy\" so that a risk manager can quickly figure out a bank’s exposure by security type and counter-party.\n\nBanks buy from GoldenSource because it can help them track the broadest collection of financial instruments — from equities to so-called OTC derivatives — and it can help risk managers perform many functions — such as setting up automated workflows and independently evaluating and auditing the price of a security. And by consolidating the data operations of each of a banks’ departments, GoldenSource can make clients operations more efficient -- saving them millions of dollars annually.\n\nThanks to recent financial industry regulations that require systemic risk management, GoldenSource could capture the growth opportunity of meeting the need for federal financial regulators to know the extent to which specific banks are exposed to each other at a macro level.\n\nBy 2016, Chow hopes that GoldenSource will have assisted the majority of firms to break down data silos in a potential billion dollar market. Since he estimates that less than 25% have successfully adopted GoldenSource's EDM model, Chow has his work cut out for him.\n\nBut if he succeeds, Wall Street’s risk to the world will be better managed."
