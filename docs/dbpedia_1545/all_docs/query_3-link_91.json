Every comfort you have, every privilege, comes at the expense of other living beings. This cannot, must not continue! And she doesn't only abuse dragons. Our entire culture is in service to her. The Empress used me for my work, then threw me away when she couldn't control me.”\n\nThe first season of Ninjago: Dragons Rising is preceded by Season 15 of Ninjago, and succeeded by The Elemental Mechs and Season 2.

[1]\n\nNetflix (Shorter): Two teenagers from different worlds use their newly discovered Ninja powers to defend dragons from villains who want to use their life-force for evil.\n\nIt all started with The Merge...: There is no going back from The Merge.

Now she’s struck up a friendship with Arin that could take them both to new heights...\n\nMeet Arin!: Just another ‘wannabe’ ninja? Or something more?

The Source Dragon focused on in this season is the Source Dragon of Energy. The set background is based on the Merged Realms.\n\n71789 Kai and Ras's Car and Bike Battle\n\n71790 Imperium Dragon Hunter Hound\n\n71791 Zane's Dragon Power Spinjitzu Race Car\n\n71792 Sora's

as the second season of the series, are the longest seasons in the Ninjago franchise by runtime to date, surpassing Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitzu and Crystalized.\n\nThis is also the first season since March of the Oni to have 22-minute episodes and the first season animated by WildBrain to have 22-minute episodes.\n\nOn April 1, 2023, writers Chris \"Doc\" Wyatt and Kevin Burke each tweeted out a sneak peak at the new season in the form of two truths and a lie.\n\nWyatt's three statements were:[2]\n\nThe Cloud Kingdom will see the rise of a new Elemental Master.\n\nThe Realm of Madness will defend itself against dangerous dragons.\n\nThe Departed Realm will release the spirits of ancient creatures forgotten by history.\n\nThe last statement is a lie: Euphrasia, a Cloud Kingdom resident and monk is revealed to have become the new Elemental Master of Wind, while the ninja help the Craglings of the Realm of Madness protect their village from dragons while searching for Kai.\n\nBurke's three statements were:[3]\n\nA half-man, half-frog will accept an alternative form of payment.\n\nOne ninja's golden shield will unlock an ancient crypt of snakes.\n\nTo be polite, ninja will eat actual mud.\n\nThe second statement is the lie, as Arin uses a pie as an alternative payment in \"The Merge: Part 1,\" and Lloyd, Kai, Nya, Arin, and Sora eat mud in \"Beyond Madness.\"\n\nThis was done in honor of Tommy Andreasen's tradition of announcing details about upcoming seasons in this manner.\n\nThe designs of some of the characters are slightly different from the designs in the previous series.\n\nMaster Wu no longer has his braid on the back of his head and no sideburns either.\n\nThis was done to more closely resemble his Ninjago: Core minifigure,[4] although in the trailer Wu still lacks the cheekbones he has on the minifigure and has had in all previous seasons.\n\nNya's eyebrows are thicker, her hair is darker and since the fifth episode her two side hair strands are shorter for an animation reason: the new shoulder armor piece of the merge suits do not fit with Nya's hair piece so it had to been shortened to fit.\n\nJay's voice is noticeably lower pitched compared to the previous WildBrain seasons since Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitzu.\n\nThis is the first season since The Hands of Time to introduce a new elemental power, in this case, Technology, Heat, Fusion, and Shockwave are introduced.\n\nUnlike the seasons of the original series, this season does not have a title.[5][6]\n\nEpisodes 11-15 were put up early on Disney+ Hotstar before being taken down.\n\nThis is the only season to have an audio description option.\n\nThe events of the first half of the season is similar to Hunted, as it involves the ninja being seperated due to a mishap involving realms, and then having to save dragons from a dragon hunting regime.\n\nDue to the similarities, this season reuses many of Hunted's soundtracks.\n\nThe season was written in 2021.[7]\n\nFocus Characters\n\nProtagonists\n\nSora has the most important role in this season because of her personal relationship with Imperium.\n\nSora was focused on in Episodes 1, 3,

4.\n\nShe tells the other ninja about her creating the Photac back in Imperium and then infiltrates it with Lloyd, Arin and Riyu to shut it off in Episode 6.\n\nShe encounters Dr. LaRow in the Advanced Technology Lab and then reluctantly activates more Photacs in Episode 7.\n\nShe and Nya get cursed while searching for the Yellow Dragon Core, then encounter Arrakore and fight off the Howlers in Episode 14.\n\nShe and Nya run into Cole in the Land of Lost Things and then she tries to find a new power for the machine in Episode 16.\n\nShe broadcasts a message in Imperium about Beatrix’s mistreatment of the Imperians and Dragons and that they should rebel against her in Episode 19.\n\nShe runs into her parents who refuse to believe the truth about Empress Beatrix and then she unlocks her True Potential after realizing that the ninja are her real family in Episode 20.\n\nArin is a prominent character in this season.\n\nArin was focused on in Episodes 1, 3, 7, 12, 17, and 20.\n\nHe participates with Sora in the Mech Master 5000 and fights Ras in Episode 1.\n\nHe starts his training with Lloyd, and later sneaks out the Crossroads Carnival with Sora in Episode 3.\n\nHe befriends the Imperium Teen Resistance Force and then learns that they want to join the Claws of Imperium and hunt down Dragons in Episode 7.\n\nHe and Lloyd help the farmers take back their village that was taken over by the Ocean gang who were being mind controlled by the Crab monster.\n\nHe and Lloyd end up in The Administration where they find Zane and regain the Dragon Core in Episode 17.\n\nHe transferred Spinjitzu to an object that destroyed a part of Beatrix’s mech and pushed her into a MergeQuake in Episode 20.\n\nLloyd is the most prominent of the original six ninja this season.\n\nLloyd was focused on in Episodes 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 20.\n\nIn Episode 2, he rescues Arin and Sora and then in the Land of the Three Mountains, he gets powered up by the Matriarch Dragon. Then he decides to train Arin and Sora.\n\nIn Episode 9, he remembers Wu’s advice of finding the calm inside during his training with him as a child.\n\nIn Episode 10, he gains power from the Source Dragon to power the Portal gate and then comforts Arin about his fear of being alone again.\n\nIn Episode 12, he trains Arin for him to do Object Spinjitzu and then they help the farmers get back their village.\n\nIn Episode 15, he and Arin find the Dragon Core, then find Rapton. He then walks into the Impossible Path, and he and Arin go after two agents of the Administration who took the core.\n\nIn Episode 20, he activates the three Dragon Cores to stop the MergeQuakes and stabilized the world. Then, he uses them to free the Source Dragon from Imperium.\n\nKai and Nya are this season's rostered secondary ninja.\n\nKai was focused on in Episodes 4, 13, 16, and 17.\n\nIn Episode 4, during a flashback, he came across the Kingdom of Madness, help the Craglings fight against the Earth Dragons, and he was thought dead.
