Trivia

There is a scene in the film that seems to have inspired the movie poster for Pulp Fiction as an actress poses in the same pose Mia Wallace is in.

K-Billy Radio makes it first appearance here as Clarence Pool is a disc jockey for them. K-Billy also is referenced in Reservoir Dogs.

Tarantino's friend Stevo Polyi later appeared in Reservoir Dogs in Mr. Orange's flashback as a Sheriff in the bathroom story. Brenda Hillhouse appeared in both Pulp Fiction and Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn.

The call girl character Misty Knight is a reference to a Marvel comic book character with the same name.
