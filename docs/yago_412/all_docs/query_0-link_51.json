The second half was destroyed in a fire, which means that just as the plot's starting to kick into gear the film abruptly stops. Which is a shame, because that means most people are going to skip it, and I think it deserves viewing because it doesn't feel like Tarantino at all. Oh, sure, it's got the obsession with pop culture he made his name on early on and the script is obviously the first draft",

        "text": "Film #1 in my Quentin Tarantino Project\n\nMy Best Friend's Birthday is a partially lost film, which makes it somewhat hard to talk about. The second half was destroyed in a fire, which means that just as the plot's starting to kick into gear the film abruptly stops.\n\nWhich is a shame, because that means most people are going to skip it, and I think it deserves viewing because it doesn't feel like Tarantino at all.\n\nOh, sure, it's got the obsession with pop culture he made his name on early on and the script is obviously the first draft of True Romance, but this feels far more like the work of someone like Richard Linklater or Kevin Smith. There's a particular sort of swagger to Tarantino's films that's completely not present here, replaced by a shaggy low budget realism (it feels very Roger Avary, which is odd because although he shot it he didn't touch the screenplay). More overtly Tarantino elements show up near the end (kung-fu and prostitutes) but by that point the movie's over.\n\nMy Best Friend's Birthday is mostly valuable as a curiosity (it's hard to judge the quality of the first half of a movie) but it's a worthwhile curiosity. I feel there's this conception of Tarantino as someone who's style bursts forth fully formed from the womb with Reservoir Dogs, and this, by virtue of being so different, completely shatters this. It's oddly fascinating in its own way."
