        "text": "Before he created the 1992 cult classic Reservoir Dogs - hailed by Empire magazine as one of the greatest independent films of all time - and before he won an Oscar for his first critical hit, 1994’s Pulp Fiction - Quentin Tarantino was a high school dropout working at a video rental store in Manhattan Beach, California. While his rise to fame was no doubt the result of many factors, one piece of his story has always inspired me.\n\n“This was gonna be the thing that set me up. I'd worked three years on it,” Tarantino explained in a 1994 interview with Charlie Rose. Tarantino was describing My Best Friend's Birthday - a film he'd co-written and directed over three years, on a shoestring budget, all while working as a clerk at the video store. In the end, the film was basically a failure. But the experience he gained devoting the time to just doing it helped him learn the craft.\n\n“This was my film school, all right - and this was the best film school a person could possibly have,” Tarantino continued to Rose. “Instead of going to school and paying a ton of money to be allowed to use some of their crappy equipment ... I went out and actually tried to make a feature film.” Rather than let the cost and complexity of a formal education become a blocker to learning, he just went out and did it.\n\nSo - what the heck does any of this have to do with my career in tech? And have I ever actually talked to Quentin Tarantino? (Spoiler alert: no.)\n\nI was lucky enough to start my career in very entry level business development role. I loved it - but it was work I found an appreciation for after my university days - where I'd studied journalism and psychology. You can learn a lot on the job, and I did - but at times I regretted not having majored in computer science, software engineering, or some other area that I felt would have given me all of the tools and academic concepts I would need to keep growing my career.\n\nBut - like Tarantino the retail clerk making movies in his free time - the reality is that tech/IT is probably the most accessible \"self-taught\" career path out there. There are loads of free or cheap resources available online, and the industry itself is increasingly accepting of people who just have the skills - even if they don't have the degree (just look at IBM's New Collar program or Glassdoor's list of 15 companies that no longer require a 4-year degree). So I decided to channel my inner Tarantino and just learn.\n\nWhile the options are many, I personally started with the IT Support Professional Certificate - part of the public Grow With Google program. Anyone can sign up, and it's appropriate for even total newcomers to IT/tech. Content ranges from really simple videos along the lines of “what is a computer and how does it work?” to hands-on-keyboard labs where you're deploying real web servers and writing Bash - all in an online lab environment provided through the course. I made my commute my classroom, using my daily train ride to watch lectures on the Coursera app, taking notes right on my smartphone. No student loan required - at about $60/month for a subscription (and with financial aid available), this approach is accessible to pretty much anyone.\n\nThis is not to say that a formal education isn't useful. If you're pursuing or already have a degree/diploma, kudos! You have a leg up. I think anyone with the opportunity to pursue formal education should absolutely consider it. I share this story more for those for whom that path might not be an option - due to cost, family, work, or other commitments."
