        "text": "My Best Friend’s Birthday is the first film made by Quentin Tarantino, eight years before Reservoir Dogs. It was created as a collaboration with Roger Avary in 1984 and shot on a budget of $5,000. A 70-minute rough cut was made, but a fire at the lab damaged the film and only 36 minutes of it was recovered."
