        "text": "By Mike Nowak, Product Director\n\nPeople come to Facebook to send well-wishes and celebrate birthdays with friends. In fact, every day more than 45 million people give birthday wishes on Facebook, which is why it’s important to us to ensure you can celebrate the way you want to.\n\nWe’re excited to announce two new birthday experiences that we hope will make birthdays even more meaningful while you’re celebrating on Facebook.\n\nGiving Back On Your Birthday\n\nPeople often dedicate their birthday to support a cause, and we’ve seen people using Facebook to raise money for causes they care about. For those in the US, we’re now making it easier to do this by giving you the opportunity to create a fundraiser for your birthday directly on Facebook.\n\nTwo weeks before your birthday, you’ll see a message from Facebook in your News Feed giving you the option to create a fundraiser for your birthday. You can create a fundraiser for any of the 750,000 US nonprofits available for fundraising on Facebook. Your friends will receive a notification inviting them to support your cause in honor of your special day.\n\nWish Your Best Friends Happy Birthday With a Video\n\nWe wanted to make birthdays even more special by giving people the opportunity to share a birthday wish with a close friend on their special day, which is why we’ve introduced shareable birthday videos made especially for you and your close friends.\n\nThese videos will be shown to you on the day of a close friend’s birthday, and like our other personalized videos, we created these videos because we wanted to make the birthday experience on Facebook even more fun for the special relationships in your life.\n\nBirthdays have always been a part of Facebook, and we hope to continue providing you with a variety of experiences that make celebrating on the platform fun and meaningful for you and your friends."
