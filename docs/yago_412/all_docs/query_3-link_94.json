        "text": "Somehow last January (2019) one of my best friends convinced me to join her on a podcast to chat all things friendship. I was a nervous wreck. It was my first podcast, and while I love to talk, the thought of being able to hear my own voice on replay weirded me out. Turns out, I had a great time and have had the chance to do a few more podcast interviews (but it still weirds me to hear a replay of my own voice).\n\nAround that time, I finally got around to sending out a quick survey to some of my best friends. And then Em mentioned the survey on IG when we were sharing the news about the podcast and suddenly it became the most asked question in my DMs.\n\nI have often joked that the BFF survey is what finally forced me to stop chickening out on starting a blog because I needed a place to send people for more information.\n\nThe survey I sent out wasn’t fancy or fussy – just 20 quick questions for my dearest and best friends to answer in a Google Doc. They could complete it from their phone, and I could (because I have the Google Drive App on my phone) have their answers at my fingers tips when I needed to grab a surcee to pop in the mail. Now I know which flowers to grab with their favorite Starbucks order and drop off when they’re going through a really hard time. What color earrings to pick out for a birthday or where to plan a GNO. And beyond surcees, it’s kinda nice to know random trivia about your best friends.\n\nClick here to download a PFD version of the survey!\n\nI used a Google form (*nerd alert I love a good color-coded spreadsheet), but you could just as easily send the list of questions in an email and make your own spreadsheet or keep the answers as a note in your phone.\n\nKPW has since sent out a version* of this survey (*you can clearly substitute or adjust as needed for whoever you are sending this out to and what purpose you have for collecting the info) to his team at work in preparation for a staff retreat. A friend on IG said she sent it out to all the girls in her small group and it served as a great conversation starter at their next gathering. Our preschool does a version of this for all the teachers so the room parent has direction when buying birthday and Christmas gifts.\n\nMy favorite part of all this is how it gives me the chance to be intentional in the ways I love my people (see: not giving one of my girlfriends chocolate when she much prefers fruity things like Skittles and SPKs). I am, after all, an Enneagram 2w3, so this is right up my people-pleasing, over-achieving alley…\n\nLove,\n\nKNW\n\nPS: I’m planning to resend this survey out to my girlfriends every year or so with different questions/repeat questions because things change over time (see: I didn’t eat chocolate ice cream until I turned 30 and now it’s my second favorite after coffee chip).\n\nHave questions/suggestions for the next round? Leave them below in the comments."
