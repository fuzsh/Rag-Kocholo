        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV/Gray News) - Two best friends in Tennessee were killed by an alleged drunken driver over the weekend.\n\nNatalie White and Holly Wagner died last Saturday night after they were involved in a crash with a reported DUI driver.\n\n“This person took our baby away,” Mark White, Natalie White’s father, said.\n\nFisk University held a vigil for the two friends on Wednesday afternoon. They both graduated from the university in 2021.\n\nFriends, family and classmates gathered at the Fisk Memorial Chapel to share memories and remember the women.\n\n“She was a ray of sunshine. She was the life of our house. Always smiling, always happy, always ready to joke,” Christal White, Natalie White’s mother, said.\n\nNatalie White was 24 and Holly Wagner was 25 when their lives were cut short.\n\n“They were best friends. They moved into their apartment together that day, and they were so excited to be living together as best friends and roommates,” Christal White said.\n\n“You knew they were best friends. They were inseparable,” Leah Wagner, Holly Wagner’s sister, said “When Holly kicked in my door you know Natalie was right behind her.”\n\nWhile two lives are gone, Cynthia Wagner, Holly Wagner’s mother, says she’s finding comfort that they were together.\n\n“I know she’s in heaven. I know it, and I know Natalie is there with her,” Cynthia Wagner said. “She didn’t die alone. They were together and they’re together in heaven.”\n\nPolice are continuing their investigation, but many questions remain for the family.\n\nAs the families seek those answers, they are also reflecting on what they’ll miss most.\n\n“We ended every conversation with, ‘I love you,’” Mark White said.\n\nThe day Natalie White died was her father’s birthday. He says he talked to her a few times that day and their last conversation ended as all of them in the past had.\n\n“At least I know the last thing I said to her was, ‘I love you,’” he said."
