        "text": "Slate Plus members get more Care and Feeding every week. Have a question about kids, parenting, or family life? Submit it here!\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nMy 8-year-old son, “Teddy,” made a new friend last month. “Charlotte’s” family moved here at the start of the school year. They’re in different classes but met on the playground. Teddy’s fairly shy, so making a friend is a pretty big deal. Charlotte has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. Because of that, and our house not really being suitable for a kid in a wheelchair, they’ve only played at her house or the after-school program, so I haven’t interacted much with Charlotte before, but she seems like a really sweet kid. I’ve had brief conversations with her mother, who said she was really grateful that Charlotte made a friend, since Charlotte is also very shy and has anxiety.\n\nCharlotte invited Teddy to her birthday party. Teddy has been trying to come up with ideas for a gift for Charlotte, but his gift-giving skills are not very good. I don’t know Charlotte well myself, and though I know she has a lot in common with my son, I don’t know the extent to which her condition affects what sorts of gifts she’d enjoy. The other day, when I went to pick up Teddy from Charlotte’s house, I asked her mom what she’d be interested in getting as a gift. That’s all. I didn’t mention my reason for asking. I don’t think this was a particularly weird question. I’ve been asked this for all of my kids’ birthday parties.\n\nCharlotte’s mom got very upset and told me I was being ableist and insinuating that Charlotte can’t do certain things because of her disability. She said something along the lines of “Charlotte doesn’t need to be friends with the kids of inconsiderate people.” I apologized, though I wasn’t entirely sure what I’d done wrong.\n\nNow, her mother is cordial to me, which is fine. But Teddy and Charlotte overheard the outburst, and Teddy has asked me about it a few times. I don’t want to stop him playing with Charlotte, but I do feel weird about the incident and how willing Charlotte’s mom was to threaten our kids’ friendship. What should I do?\n\n—Feels Like We’re Heading for Disaster\n\nDear Heading for Disaster,\n\nAssuming you really didn’t say anything that could be taken as ableist, that’s a severe overreaction on the part of Charlotte’s mom, and I get that it’s made things weird and uncomfortable. (It’s not an excuse; I just can’t help but wonder how many hurtful or insensitive remarks she might have heard to react to your innocuous question in such a way.) You’ve shared that this friendship is important and beneficial to both kids. What other vibes have you gotten from Charlotte’s mom? If you don’t feel like your child is unsafe or unwelcome in her house—and you’re okay putting this incident behind you—I think it’s probably fine to just watch and wait for now. If Teddy asks you about the outburst again, all you all have to say is that there was a brief misunderstanding, but you’ve moved past it and you’re glad that he and Charlotte are friends.\n\nThat said, if Charlotte’s mom’s outburst is still really bothering you and you don’t feel like you can or want to just move forward as is, you could attempt to clear the air in a way that focuses on the importance of your children’s friendship. Something like: “I didn’t mean to cause any offense when I asked about a birthday gift. I just wanted to make sure we got Charlotte a present she’d be excited about. I know this friendship is really important to both our kids, and I wouldn’t want to jeopardize that.” However you decide to proceed, be ready and know what you want to say in the moment if she gets upset with you again. If she keeps making you uncomfortable, you can think more seriously about having the kids hang out less outside of school. For now, I think the most important thing is to listen to Teddy and be aware of his feelings about this friendship and his time at Charlotte’s house.\n\n—Nicole\n\nMore Advice From Slate"
