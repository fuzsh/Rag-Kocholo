        "text": "13 Best Friend Birthday Gift Ideas - Experiences Sheâll Always Remember\n\nAre you wracking your brain, searching high and low for good birthday gift ideas for your best friend?Â\n\nLetâs face it, if sheâs your best friendâ¦\n\nYour ride or dieâ¦\n\nYour sister from another misterâ¦\n\nYour personâ¦\n\nThen sheâs probably a very special woman who deserves an equally special and unique birthday gift.Â\n\nIf youâre struggling to come up with this perfect gift idea, youâre in the right place.\n\nWeâre going to share 15 of the very best gift ideas for your best friendâs birthday that will leave her with amazing memories sheâll never forget.\n\nContents:\n\nWhy Experiences Are Better Gifts Than Items For Best Friend Birthdays\n\nWorkshops and ClassesÂ\n\nEntertainment\n\nAdventure and Travel\n\nPampering\n\nWhy Experiences Are Better Gifts Than Items For Birthdays\n\nMaterial gifts are overrated.Â\n\nWho needs another candle or necklace or kitchen gadget or makeup palette?\n\nThe reality is that after the initial surprise of opening the gift, most of these things are quickly forgotten about, stashed away in a cabinet, closet, or drawer along with hundreds of other useless items that will never again see the light of the day.\n\nIn todayâs world, people just have too much stuff.\n\nExperiences, however, are treasured.Â\n\nWhen you look back on your life, what really stands out? Is it the material gifts you were given or the experiences you had?\n\nExperiences Are More Meaningful\n\nOver time material items lose their value to us. They become old, dirty, or worn out. They are lost or are no longer useful.Â\n\nExperiences, on the other hand, never lose their value and actually tend to increase in importance as time passes, as we fondly recall our favorite experiences of the past.\n\nExperiences Strengthen Relationships\n\nA recent study, conducted by Cindy Chan of the U of T Scarborough, found that relationships are strengthened between the gifter and the giftee through experiential gifts as opposed to material gifts.\n\nâ\n\n\"An experiential gift elicits a strong emotional response when a recipient consumes it -- like the fear and awe of a safari adventure, the excitement of a rock concert or the calmness of a spa -- and is more intensely emotional than a material possession,\" says Chan.\n\nExperiences Creates More Overall Happiness\n\nIn another recent study, Amit Kumar of the University of Texas found that \"... people derive more happiness from their experiences than from their possessions.\"\n\nExperiences give people memories that they can happily cherish forever.Â\n\nâ\n\nKumar concluded that \"If you want to be happier, it might be wise to shift some of your consumption away from material goods and a bit more toward experiences...that would likely lead to greater well-being.\"\n\n13 Best Friend Birthday Gift Ideas For Her\n\nIf youâre looking for an incredible and unique experience based birthday gift for your best friend, Gift a Panda has you covered.
