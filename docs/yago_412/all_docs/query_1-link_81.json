        "text": "You know you’ve officially veered into best friend territory with someone when you start making playlists together. And what playlist shared between best buds could be complete without a solid handful of best friend songs on it?\n\nAfter all, romantic love gets more than its fair share of credit for inspiring music. But the key friendships in our lives can be just as (read: more) inspiring than any romance. That’s why it’s hardly surprising so many artists have put their feelings for the platonic loves of their lives to song.\n\nReady to celebrate your bestie and the love you have for each other? We’ve rounded up 37 of the most iconic songs about friendship, with best friend lyrics that’ll leave you and your ride-or-die saying: “Been there.”\n\nListen to our best friend songs playlist on Spotify.\n\n1. “I’ll Be There For You,” The Rembrandts\n\nLike many of the songs about friendship on this list, this one puts words to the feeling of intense loyalty and support among the best of buddies. The chorus is a lesson in “how to write best friend lyrics”: “I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour. I'll be there for you, like I've been there before. I'll be there for you, ‘cause you're there for me too.”\n\n2. “Any Time You Need a Friend,” Mariah Carey\n\nThis particular song was written during a time of loneliness for Mariah Carey, during a particularly tough marriage. The lyrics are words of comfort that anyone could benefit from when they’re feeling especially alone. It’s the perfect song to send a friend who’s going through a rough moment.\n\n3. “Good As Hell,” Lizzo\n\nSimultaneously tackling heartbreak and serving up “forget that guy, I’ve got your back” vibes, Lizzo created a BFF anthem with this one. “I know he did you wrong, we can make it right. So go and let it all hang out tonight”—these are words straight from a friend who would be just as comfortable watching you cry into your ice cream or going out for a night of fun.\n\n4. “Count On Me,” Bruno Mars\n\nWhen it comes to songs about friendship, it doesn’t get much sweeter than this one. Bruno Mars sings about the tight bond among best friends, namely the people who will “sail the world to find you.” But it’s this line that really gets us: “We'll find out what we're made of when we are called to help our friends in need.” Cue the tears.\n\n5. “Hymn,” Kesha\n\nThis song tackles those friendships that begin as a bond between outsiders. “After all we've been through. No, we won't stand and salute. So we just ride, we just cruise. Livin' like there's nothing left to lose.” It’s the carefree kind of vibe between kindred spirits, in a single song.\n\n6. \"Me and My Girls,\" Selena Gomez\n\nSelena Gomez tackles the energy of a girls’ night out in this song. Flying down the highway, dressed to kill, and ready to take on whatever the night brings.\n\n7. \"Best Friend,\" Harry Nilsson\n\nIf you’ve seen the MTV show Rob & Big, you’ve heard this song. It’s a pure-hearted ode to the best person you know and one of the catchiest friendship songs ever.\n\n8. “You’re My Best Friend,” Queen\n\nSure, this song may technically have been inspired by bassist John Deacon’s relationship with his wife, but it’s lived on as a bestie anthem ever since.\n\n9. “Thank You For Being a Friend,” Andrew Gold\n\nGold wrote this song in 1978, dedicating it to his musical partner Brock Walsh. It’s the Cynthia Fee cover, though, that’s best remembered as the theme song for The Golden Girls. Put it on while eating midnight cheesecake with your own Dorothy-Blanche-Rose-Sophia crew.\n\n10. “That’s My Best Friend,” Tokyo Vanity\n\nNew Orleans rapper Tokyo Vanity went viral in 2015 for this supremely Insta- and Vine-friendly hit, and the tutu-filled music video will make you want to be her best friend.\n\n11. “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell\n\nOne of the most beloved best friend songs out there, this Motown classic is an especially sweet pick for BFFs separated by distance.\n\n12. “Wannabe,” Spice Girls\n\nOh, the days of choreographing playground dances to this ditty and fighting over who got to be Baby. (Related: Why, pray tell, did so many of us want to be Baby?)\n\n13. \"Best Friends,\" Missy Elliott (feat. Aaliyah)\n\nBest friend lyrics like these will resonate for anyone who’s ever hoped (and hoped, and hoped) their BFF will get out of a no-good relationship.\n\n14. \"Heroes,\" David Bowie\n\nAlthough “Heroes” may have been inspired by the sight of Bowie’s producer kissing his girlfriend against the then-active Berlin Wall, it’ll add a solidly triumphant note to any BFF playlist. (Plus, we know you’re really thinking about that one scene from The Perks of Being a Wallflower here.)\n\n15. “Best Friend,” Brandy\n\nBrandy dedicated this song, off her self-titled debut album, to her younger brother and fellow singer, Ray J. That makes it an even sweeter BFF anthem for blood-related best friends.\n\n16. “In My Life,” The Beatles\n\nWe know, we know. You were expecting “With a Little Help From My Friends,” and that works, too! But this one’s just too tender to pass over.\n\n17. “Where You Lead,” Carole King\n\nIf King herself wasn’t enough of a draw, we’re pretty sure the Gilmore Girls-theme associations will add a sentimental spark to your playlist.\n\n18. “Best Friend,” Saweetie (feat. Doja Cat)\n\nThe first 30 seconds of the music video alone, in which real-life pals Saweetie and Doja Cat read each other’s thoughts as a dude mansplains objectification to them, should land this song on any bestie song list. Behold the truly excellent line: “Bitch, please, that kind of crass virtue-signaling is nothing but a less overtly nefarious form of toxic masculinity.”\n\n19. “Graduation (Friends Forever),” Vitamin C\n\nChildren of the late ‘90s and early aughts already knew this one was coming.\n\n20. “We’re Going to Be Friends,” The White Stripes\n\nAn elementary school-befitting rhyme scheme and simple melody make this jingle a throwback nod to some of our earliest playground friendships.\n\n21. \"I'm Only Me When I'm With You,\" Taylor Swift\n\nFrom her self-titled debut album, Swift’s real life bestie Abigail Anderson inspired this song. (Look out for Anderson in the music video!)\n\n22. \"You Can’t Make Old Friends,\" Kenny Rogers (feat. Dolly Parton)\n\nRogers and Parton have described themselves as “soul partners,” with a 30-year friendship that started when the two teamed up for karaoke song par excellence “Islands in the Stream.”\n\n23. “Umbrella,” Rihanna\n\n“When the sun shines, we’ll shine together.” Obviously the whole weather-analogy thing is why this lyric exists, but we mean! That’s kind of sweet.\n\n24. “Waiting on a Friend,” The Rolling Stones\n\nOkay, so even though Keith Richards’ disdain for Mick Jagger is well documented, this song, clearly about the brighter days of their friendship, is a tender one.\n\n25. “God Only Knows,” The Beach Boys\n\nYou thought that, of The Beach Boys canon, we were going to say “Friends,” didn’t you? Well, we didn't.\n\n26. “Super Trouper,” ABBA\n\nPutting this on with your buds may just inspire you to rig up your own girl band, Donna and the Dynamos-style.\n\n27. \"Friends in Low Places,\" Garth Brooks\n\nBlame it on your roots. But when this song comes on at the Nashville bar you’ll someday be dragged to for a bachelorette party, you and the crew will sing it.\n\n28. “Cheetah Sisters,” The Cheetah Girls\n\nWhat a moment this scene was for coordinated headbands and tracksuits!\n\n29. “Friends,” BTS\n\nSung by Jimin and V, the song chronicles the pair’s friendship, predating their time as BTS bandmates. Fun fact: It’s also the second song ever from Korean artists to be featured in a Marvel movie, with a spot in Eternals.\n\n30. “Time After Time,” Cyndi Lauper\n\nBecause it’s not just an S.O. who’s deserving of these moody keyboard-synth chords! Lauper’s “True Colors” could be just as befitting of a BFF songs playlist, though.\n\n31. “Oo-De-Lally,” Roger Miller"
