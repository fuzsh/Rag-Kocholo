        "text": "Birthdays are meant to be joyous, and the special day traditionally calls on family and friends to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to the celebrant. Although people appreciate the wishes with the usual birthday song and its many variations, music artists have released tracks to equally commemorate one's birthday. To celebrate another year around the sun, here's a list of songs that can make anyone party like it's their birthday.\n\n1 of 25\n\n“Happy Birthday” by Stevie Wonder\n\nDaniel Knighton/Getty Images\n\nOne of the most recognizable celebratory tracks came in 1980 when Stevie Wonder released “Happy Birthday.” The track originally served as a petition to make Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday a federal holiday.\n\n2 of 25\n\n“Birthday” by Katy Perry\n\nMonica Schipper/Getty Images\n\nOn Katy Perry’s 2013 single “Birthday,” she puts a different kind of spin on what it means to celebrate.

Kanye West\n\nPrince Williams/WireImage\n\n2 Chainz is a man who knows what he wants on his 2012 single “Birthday Song.” Teaming up with Kanye West, Chainz doesn’t beat around the bush in highlighting how all he wants for his birthday is a voluptuous woman.\n\n4 of 25\n\n“Birthday” by Selena Gomez\n\nNeilson Barnard/Getty Images\n\nIn 2013, pop singer Selena Gomez released her debut studio album, Stars Dance.

It tailors more about going out and partying.
