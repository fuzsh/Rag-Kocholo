        "text": "Taylor Swift has a strong group of girls by her side.\n\nAt the 2024 Super Bowl, after flying across nine time zones to get to Las Vegas, Swift had friends Blake Lively, Keleigh Teller, Lana Del Rey, Ice Spice and more by her side during the stressful game.\n\nSwift, whose public appearances often draw cameras, previously told Time for her 2023 Person of the Year cover story that she doesn’t “have the time or bandwidth to get pressed about things that don’t matter.”\n\n“Yes, if I go out to dinner, there’s going to be a whole chaotic situation outside the restaurant. But I still want to go to dinner with my friends,” she said.\n\nIn 2023, Swift was often spotted out and about in New York with friends that go way back like Selena Gomez and Emma Stone as well as new pals like Brittany Mahomes, who's married to her boyfriend Travis Kelce's teammate.\n\nHere’s a guide to some of the people who were seen with Swift this year.\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nArguably one of Swift’s most prominent friendships, their bond is no secret. Recently, Gomez shared two selfies with her best friend quoting Saweetie’s song “Best Friend” in the caption, “That’s my best frien -she a real bad.”\n\nThe two first met around 2008. On Sept. 1, when asked how she met Swift, Gomez told MYfm that they “both dated the Jonas Brothers.”\n\nAt the time, Swift was dating Joe Jonas, and Gomez was dating Nick Jonas.\n\nNow, nearly 15 years later, Swift's best friend showed support at multiple “Eras Tour” dates, and even attended shows with her 10-year-old sister, Gracie Teefey.\n\nThey were also photographed at this year’s VMAs, where Gomez cheered her best friend on as she tied the record for most VMA wins in one night.\n\nZoë Kravitz\n\nSwift and the “Big Little Lies” star were spotted at a sushi restaurant in West Hollywood, California, along with Gomez, on Oct. 19. It’s the latest bonding moment for Kravitz and Swift, who spent some time together in the beginning of the pandemic, when both were in London. Swift was there with then-boyfriend Joe Alwyn, while Kravitz was shooting “The Batman.”\n\n“She was my pod,” Kravitz told GQ in 2022. “She was a very important part of being in London, just having a friend that I could see and that would make me home-cooked meals and dinner on my birthday.”\n\nSwift, in turn, gushed about Kravitz.\n\n“Zoë’s sense of self is what makes her such an exciting artist, and such an incredible friend,” she told GQ. “She has this very honest inner compass, and the result is art and life without compromising who she is.”\n\nThe pair also managed to work together, with Kravitz receiving a writing credit and singing background vocals on “Lavender Haze,” from Swift’s massively successful “Midnights” album.\n\nBlake Lively\n\nSwift recently stepped out with longtime friend Blake Lively Oct. 26 in New York City. Earlier in the month, Lively and husband Ryan Reynolds attended the Chiefs-Jets game with Swift in New Jersey. Swift and Lively were also photographed arriving at a New York restaurant together in September.\n\nTheir friendship dates back to roughly 2015. Not long after ending her relationship with Alwyn, Swift and Lively were seen strolling around New York City — sometimes with Lively’s husband.\n\nIn her 2020 album “Folklore,” Swift mentions three of Lively’s childrens’ names in her track “Betty” — and reveals the name of Lively and Reynolds’ third child. Lively's older two childrens’ names, James and Inez, also pop up in the lyrics.\n\nThe two have worked together as well. Lively directed the music video for “I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor’s Version)”— released in November 2021. The project marked Lively’s debut as a director, and it was co-produced by Swift's brother, Austin.\n\nGigi Hadid\n\nSwift’s friendship with Hadid dates back almost 10 years to the original “1989” era. The model appeared in the singer’s star-studded music video for “Bad Blood,” and the two stayed close over the years.\n\nIn 2017, Swift gushed to Harper’s Bazaar about her relationship with Hadid.\n\n“As a friend, Gigi is one of the first people I go to for advice. She has this incredible ability to see all sides of a situation and simplify it for you, to see the complexity of people,\" she said. \"Gigi’s No. 1 rule is to treat people the way she’d want to be treated, so she’s on time (or early) to work, says hello to everyone on set, asks them how they are, and actually listens to their response.”\n\nHadid attended Swift's \"Eras Tour\" stop in Santa Clara and appeared in a hilarious behind-the-scenes video with Swift and her dad, Scott, captured on TikTok. In the video, Swift filmed her dad riding a Segway backstage while she and Hadid rode on a cart.\n\nThe Haim sisters\n\nThe Haim sisters — Este, Danielle and Alana — recently appeared with Swift in Polaroid pics from the singer's Fourth of July party.\n\nThey’ve also collaborated with Swift on multiple projects, including a feature on “No Body, No Crime” from the “Evermore” album. Swift in turn was featured on Haim’s 2020 track, “Gasoline.”\n\nIn 2022, the sisters, along with Laura Dern, also starred in Swift’s “Bejeweled” music video, playing the stepsisters to Swift's Cinderella in her spin on the fairytale.\n\n“The thing I love about Taylor is, as a director, she loves having us improv,” the sisters shared with “E!” at the 2022 Glamour Women of the Year Awards. “To be able to work with your friends like that, it was really really cool.”\n\nThis year, the group served as the opening act for several stops on “The Eras Tour,” a follow-up to their stint on the “1989 World Tour” in 2015.\n\nJack Antonoff\n\nJack Antonoff and Taylor Swift’s friendship is no secret. The two first met in 2012, and Antonoff has since served as a producer on several of her albums.\n\nSwift was the first artist who let Antonoff produce a song, he revealed on a 2018 appearance on “The Plug With Neil Griffiths” podcast.\n\nThe first project the two worked on was in 2013, when Antonoff produced Swift’s song “Sweeter Than Fiction.” Their collaboration and friendship has since spanned more than a decade.\n\nMost recently, on Aug. 19, Swift attended Antonoff’s wedding to actor Margaret Qualley.\n\nAntonoff also performed with Swift during her New Jersey stop on “The Eras Tour.” On May 26, he made a surprise appearance onstage to sing an acoustic version of “Getaway Car” with her. The song, from her sixth album, “Reputation,” was written and produced by the duo.\n\nSophie Turner\n\nA seemingly new public friendship, Swift and “Game of Thrones” actor Sophie Turner were spotted grabbing dinner together in New York in September, not long after Turner and Joe Jonas announced their divorce.\n\nTurner was also photographed at Swift's Sept. 30 and Nov. 4 dinners in New York.\n\nBefore this year, the last time Swift and Turner were photographed together was at “The Graham Norton Show” in 2020 — but Turner has been open about being a fan of the singer.\n\nIn 2022, Turner said on an Instagram live that \"1989\" is her favorite album, “hands down.”\n\nIn her last post with Joe Jonas before announcing their divorce, Turner shared a photo from the Jonas Brothers’ show at Yankee Stadium and was wearing an arm full of friendship bracelets — a common accessory for Swift’s “Eras Tour.”\n\nOne bracelet read “Mr. Perfectly Fine,\" referring to one of the vault tracks from “Fearless (Taylor’s Version),\" which is rumored to be about Swift’s 2008 relationship with Joe Jonas.\n\nAfter four years of marriage, the couple announced their divorce in a joint statement on Sept. 6.\n\nBrittany Mahomes\n\nWhile Swift’s relationship with Kelce has been the source of media speculation and fan fascination, it seems she has also struck a bond with Brittany Mahomes, wife of Kansas City Chiefs superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\nBrittany Mahomes was among the celebrities at dinner with Swift at Emilio’s Ballato in New York Sept. 30. The star-studded dinner occurred the night before the Chiefs played the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium Oct. 1.\n\nShe again appeared at dinner with Swift on Nov. 4.\n\nThe “Blank Space” singer and Brittany Mahomes have also attended Chiefs games together. During the game against the Denver Broncos on Oct. 12 at Kansas City’s Arrowhead Stadium, the pair cheered as the Chiefs rolled to a 19-8 victory.\n\nThe singer also attended the Chiefs' home game Oct. 22. against the Los Angeles Chargers and again cheered as the quarterback's wife held her baby.\n\nSwift has now attended four of the Chiefs' last five games, starting with their Sept. 24 home win against the Chicago Bears, which incited a media frenzy when she was spotted watching in a suite.\n\nBefore their second New York City dinner together, Brittany Mahomes received a sweet gift from her new pal — the official cardigan created for “1989.”\n\nThe NFL wife shared a picture of the blue accessory to her Instagram story and tagged the singer in her post. A note from Swift that starts, “Oh hi!” is visible in the corner of her snap.\n\n“#Taylor’sversion,” Brittany Mahomes wrote over her post."
