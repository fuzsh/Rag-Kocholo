After all, your birth chart speaks to your personality, interests, likes, dislikes, and communication style. It makes sense, then, that astrology could tell us which zodiac signs make the best friends.\n\nWhile you'll want to consider your sun sign, aka your core identity, self-image, and confidence, you should also consider other parts of your birth chart, says astrologer Stephanie N. Campos.

Campos is an astrologer and the author of Seasons of the Zodiac: Love, Magick & Manifestation Throughout the Astrological Year.\n\nSo consider these social and emotional planetary placements (which you can learn from a personal chart reading, an automated report, or an app like Time Passages) as you check out the best friends for every sign.\n\nAries\n\nRuled by Mars, the planet of action, energy, and sex, Aries is the cardinal fire sign—dynamic, energetic, impulsive, curious, direct, and at times innocent.

Together, you're a cozy pair who know that the best hang involves wonderful food, the comfiest clothes, and binge-watching an emotionally satisfying show.\n\nVirgo: The mutable earth sign forms a positive trine to Taurus.

With social and emotional placements in the sign of the Lion, you'll hit it off with:\n\nGemini: The mutable air sign is sextile to Leo and you both adore bouncing from one see-and-be-seen event to the next. You always make an impression by being playful, cheerful, and eternally sunny.\n\nLibra: The cardinal air sign is also sextile to Leo. Together, you'll be the ultimate hosts, throwing enviable parties with all the most eye-catching details.
