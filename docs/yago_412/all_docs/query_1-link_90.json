Birthdays are sometimes a lot to deal with if you’re the one hosting them. So why not give your friend the most fuss-free birthday party ever? Make their birthday special with our top relaxing birthday party ideas!\n\n💆‍♀️🌸 1. Unwind with a Spa Day\n\nIf your best friend is the type of person who always puts others first, chances are they’ve not enjoyed some ‘me time’ for ages. With responsibilities like studies, family, and many other things, keeping up with body rituals and some well-deserved indulgence is hard!\n\nA spa session like a Shirodhara or even a back massage can help your friend relax and care for their mind and body on their special day.\n\nTo make the event extra special, consider booking a hotel stay so they can fully relax on their birthday!\n\n📋🤝 2. A Responsibility-Free Day\n\nIs it possible? The short answer is YES! With a little planning and coordination, a worry-free day for your friend is possible!\n\nThe ability to not do anything is synonymous with luxury when you hit a certain age! Whether it’s planning a relaxing day at the beach or helping with everyday tasks like grocery shopping or picking up the kids from school, these simple acts of kindness can make your friend’s day truly special.\n\nYou could even team up with other friends to share the tasks, so the birthday boy or girl doesn’t have to worry about a thing for a day!\n\n🎮🕹️ 3. Play Their Favourite Video Game\n\nTravel back to carefree times with a video game party!\n\nWhether your friend is studying or working, chances are that they don’t have as much free time as they would like to play their favourite video games, so why not team up with them or play against them on their special day? Just make sure to let them win to make their day!\n\nServe finger foods like mozzarella bites and vegan arancini that don’t require you to set the table while playing! Remember to add a Pacman, Super Mario, or any of the celebrant’s favourite video game-themed desserts to the event to make it extra special!\n\nCheck out some video game party planning inspiration on Pinterest right away!\n\n🌿🏞️ 4. Book a Wellness Retreat\n\nSome people need some time away to rejuvenate, and if your buddy lives in a hectic city, they could definitely use some away time from all the hustle and bustle of city life.\n\nWellness retreats are ideal for focusing on your emotional well-being. These judgement-free spaces are made for people to focus on themselves and let them express themselves freely.\n\nRetreats typically equip visitors with tools to overcome obstacles through yoga, mindfulness, or other practices, so your dear friend will certainly feel grateful for such a birthday idea!\n\nIf you’re curious about the benefits of a retreat stay or vacation, read about the advantages of wellness retreats by Everyday Health right here!\n\n🍹🍻 5. Host a Virtual Happy Hour\n\nSometimes, all you need to make your friend’s birthday extraordinary is to simply gather their near and dear ones through the magic of the internet!\n\nIf your friend has not seen their folks in a while, hosting a virtual catchup with celebratory drinks will make them happy.\n\nBirthdays are much more enjoyable when the celebrant is surrounded by the people they love, whether it’s their immediate relatives, childhood friends, teachers, or someone they talk about and miss.\n\nAsk everyone to get their favourite drinks and send the invite via Facebook or create an event page to invite everyone and send reminders on time.\n\nYour friend will not only be touched by the gesture but will also appreciate the effort in organising such a meaningful birthday meetup!\n\n🎲🧩 6. Board Games On\n\nWondering what type of party to host for a laid-back gathering at home? If your friend is anything like us, they probably love a classic board game night!\n\nBoard games can be hosted at any time of the year, and if your buddy doesn’t like going overboard on their birthday, a casual party like this one will keep them happy! (If you let them win again, of course!)\n\nGames like Settlers of Catan, Monopoly, and Scrabble are easy to learn and can make a casual party a lot more interesting with the teasing, good humour, and great conversations!\n\nMake sure to invite people from early on and decide on a game before the event. Go for easy finger foods that don’t require flatware, and remember to serve the favourite dessert of the celebrant!\n\n🌳The Great Outdoors Birthday Ideas\n\nWhether it’s springtime, fall, or summertime, there are many fun things to do on your friend’s special day!
