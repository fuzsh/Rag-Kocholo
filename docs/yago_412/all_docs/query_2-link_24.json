        "text": "Dear Eric: This may be immature but there’s a snub that has bothered me for 70 years.\n\nIrene was my best friend since elementary school. We lived next door to each other and were inseparable. She was outgoing; I was introverted.\n\nIrene’s parents decided not to invite me to her 15th birthday party to which they invited several young men, fearing that my presence might detract some attention from Irene.\n\nI was profoundly hurt and never spoke to her again.\n\nEven years later, when l was married, my father saw Irene in front of our building pushing a baby carriage holding twins. Irene asked about me, said she would like to talk to me, and gave him her contact info. But l just could not do it. I never called her.\n\n– Still Hurt Friend\n\nDear Friend: What Irene’s parents did to you was unfair and unkind. It’s not immature to still have feelings about it. It’s a core wound that came at an especially sensitive time in your development.\n\nBecause this was Irene’s parents’ doing and, presumably, not hers, talking to Irene may have offered you some closure or even a bit of healing.\n\nBut it’s OK not to be ready.\n\nHowever, if this is bothering you enough to write to me about it, I think it may be an indicator that the wound wants to close.\n\nRelease Irene’s parents for making a bad choice in what they thought was the best interest of their daughter. Release Irene for being caught in the middle. And, most importantly, release yourself. You didn’t deserve the snub. You should have been invited. It doesn’t have to define you anymore.\n\nStories by R. Eric Thomas\n\nAsking Eric: How do I help support nephew’s new baby without attaching strings to my money?\n\nAsking Eric: Husband’s niece was raised to expect a big inheritance. That’s not going to happen\n\nAsking Eric: I nagged my grandson for 8 years to get him through school. Now he won’t talk to me\n\nDear Eric: I have a future son-in-law who gladly accepts gifts, tickets to events and dinner events, as well as dinners out. My issue is I’ve never once heard a “thank you, that’s kind of you”.\n\nI find myself in a bind as I really dislike simmering in resentment. I also find that it’s challenging to address this issue without coming across as judgy, and I’m also a bit afraid it will be “joked off.”\n\nThere’s also a strong piece around my husband and I being “privileged”, and this also makes it awkward. He does not come from privilege. We do like the guy, but we also feel taken advantage of.\n\n– Thankless Gift Giver\n\nDear Gift Giver: Being underprivileged doesn’t prevent someone from incorporating “thank you” into their vocabulary. That said, you may be placing different values on these gifts than he does. Try accepting that your future son-in-law communicates differently than you do.\n\nOnce that’s done, as a way of building your relationship, tell him how you’d like to be communicated with. This doesn’t have to take the form of instruction. But saying “It makes me feel valued when the things I do are acknowledged” may help him see your side.\n\nExpressions of love are part of being in a family. He may see the nice things you do as simply a transaction. But you can give him the tools to help you feel loved back."
