        "text": "By Carlos Cortés | Contributing Columnist\n\nI remember the moment when I came up with the idea of a 90th birthday party movie about my life. In April my daughter, Alana, and I were celebrating my 89th birthday with lunch in the Mission Inn central courtyard. Then the inevitable question popped up: “Dad, what are you going to do special for your 90th birthday?”\n\n“As little as possible,” I responded in my best bah, humbug voice. “Maybe Laurel and I will go to Del Taco.” Anything to avoid the deluge of obligatory phone calls and discordant group renditions of “Happy Birthday.”\n\nThe older I get, the more I detest celebrating my birthday. Especially in-person birthday parties, which often turn into a form of elder abuse. Hour after hour of being forced to answer the relentless question, “How does it feel to turn ______?” By the third or fourth reprise I’m ready to respond with a knee to the groin. That is, if I could lift my knee high enough.\n\nAlthough I had made my anti-party position clear, Alana was not to be denied. “You must have a 90th birthday party, Dad. If you don’t, the family will be so disappointed.” I hastened to explain that it’s my party and I’ll avoid it if I want to. I wasn’t about to go through an ordeal just to please the family.\n\nNot to be dissuaded, Alana persisted. “What will it take to get you to come to your 90th birthday party?” Now the ball was in my court, but not for long.\n\nFrom the deepest recesses of my unconscious came my response. “I’ll come if the family makes a movie about my life, so I can just show up, kick back, and enjoy it.”\n\nNot the least bit dismayed, Alana agreed that she and the rest of the family would make a movie. Party on. Now I could look forward to a celebration of my life while I’m still around to celebrate it.\n\nThat was seven months ago and the movie project is rolling along, I think. Alana has formed a team composed mainly of grandkids. It helps that my immediate and extended family is loaded with creative people: two college film studies students, several artists, one cabaret musician, and multiple take-charge types.\n\nThey asked if I had any models for the movie. I responded that they could get some ideas by watching a few biographical films, like “Citizen Kane,” “It’s a Wonderful Life,” and “Christmas Carol.” My wife, Laurel, suggested “Benjamin Button,” which might be her wishful thinking. I’m not Brad Pitt and I’m not getting any younger.\n\nFortunately there is plenty of information on me. My Wikipedia entry is now live and I’ve written both a memoir and a one-person autobiographical play, so the team has plenty of stuff. One granddaughter asked artificial intelligence to write a brief bio of me, and within seconds it did. But I told them that I wanted an afternoon of fun, not a cascade of information. So I suggested some possibilities.\n\nMy wife’s daughter, Merrit Winters, earns a living by creating online art lessons and marketing them on national and international websites. She demonstrates and narrates each lesson. Maybe have her do a segment to coach partygoers into drawing me.\n\nMy Oregon friend Ellen Summerfield is a fabulous, sardonic poet. She agreed to write a poem about me. If I’m lucky, Alana’s brother-in-law George Lawton, a guitarist, songwriter and cabaret entertainer, will set it to music and sing.\n\nMaybe a quiz show about my life, with people answering with their cell phones. That would be particularly good for the partygoers who join the festivities via zoom.\n\nThe movie team asked me if I could make a list of people they could interview and record, so I gave them several dozen, stretching back to my elementary school best friend now living in North Carolina. I’ve mentioned the film project to a number of my friends, and without exception they’ve expressed their willingness to be interviewed.\n\nI started out with the idea of not being involved in the project. However, the team soon turned the tables on me and signed me up for an online service that sends me a weekly question about my life, which I am supposed to answer for a book of my responses. Since I’m to blame for starting the whole movie journey, I couldn’t say no, so I dutifully answer each week’s question (“What advice would you give yourself at age 20?”). Not sure how they’re going to use my answers, so I’ll be surprised.\n\nI have no idea how the movie will come out, but the product is much less important than the process. For the first time in decades I’m actually enjoying my birthday, even though it’s months away. The movie project has turned into a year-long birthday party with some of the best family-and-friend conversations I’ve had in years. Who knows? Maybe the team will even discover Rosebud."
