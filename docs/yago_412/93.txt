It may be a surprise to some that Quentin Tarantino has a film preceeding Reservoir Dogs. In 1987, he finished ‘My Best Friend’s Birthday’, a film written by himself and Craig Hamann, a friend from his local video store, Video Archives in Manhattan Beach, California.

Unfortunately, half of the film was destroyed in a fire, but what was left shows us Tarantino’s talent showing even in an amateur production, and suggests much of what to come in terms of his style and technique.
