        "meta_description": "AbstractThis paper argues that Soviet policy during World War II in Europe was from the very beginning integrally connected with its policy toward the Far East. At the Yalta Conference, Stalin agreed to join the war three months after Germany surrendered in return for the war trophies promised by Franklin D. Roosevelt. In April, the Soviet government notified the Japanese government that it had no intention to renew the Neutrality Pact, but assured the Japanese that the pact would be in force until it expired in April 1946. Hiding behind the cloak of neutrality, the Soviet Union transported troops and equipment to the Far East in preparation for the war against Japan. In July, the Japanese government sought Moscow’s mediation to terminate the war. Stalin took advantage of the Japanese request to prolong the war. Despite his expectations, however, Stalin was excluded from the Potsdam Declaration at the Potsdam Conference. The race began between Harry S. Truman, who wanted to force Japan to surrender with the atomic bomb, and Stalin, who intended to enter the war before Japan’s surrender.",

        "text": "Soviet policies in Europe and the Far East\n\nYalta Conference, February 1945\n\n12Second, in order for Stalin to gain these war trophies, he had to fulfill two important conditions: participation in the war and agreement with the Chinese government on the Yalta terms. Otherwise, the Allies might renege on their promises at the peace conference. Thus, it was imperative for him not only to enter the war, but to prevent the war from ending before the Soviets joined it. Third, Stalin’s diplomatic success was based on the continuation of his previous tactical maneuvers. Relying on America’s need to secure Soviet participation in the war against Japan, he presented his real objectives as if they were concessions to the United States.\n\nAbrogation of the Neutrality Pact\n\nMay-June 1945: Stalin-Hopkins and Hirota-Malik meetings\n\nThe Politburo decides to go to war\n\nPre-Potsdam: Japanese-Soviet and Sino-Soviet negotiations\n\nPotsdam Conference\n\nSettings\n\n25Stalin came to Potsdam, assuming that the United States still needed the Soviet entry into the war. He also counted on Hopkins’s assurance that the United States would place the question of a joint ultimatum to Japan on the agenda. Also, Stalin hoped that the United States would exert pressure on the Chinese to accept the Yalta provisions. Thus, Stalin expected Truman, who, he assumed, was as eager as Roosevelt to invite the Soviets to join the war, to help resolve these two obstacles.\n\n26Before the Potsdam Conference, Truman had faced two irreconcilable dilemmas. The first was how to deal with the Soviets. Truman and his new secretary of State, James Byrnes, began to worry about the implications of the Soviet entry into the war against Japan, which would inevitably expand Soviet influence in Asia. If he could avoid it, Truman would prefer to end the war before the Soviets entered it. Nevertheless, his military advisers argued that even if Soviet participation in the war was no longer necessary to win the war, it would still hasten Japan’s surrender, thereby saving American lives.\n\n27Truman faced another dilemma over unconditional surrender. Not only was unconditional surrender Roosevelt’s legacy, but this demand was supported by the overwhelming majority of the American people. Truman felt that it was necessary to avenge the humiliation suffered by Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor by bringing Japan to its knees by imposing unconditional surrender. But many influential advisers such as Secretary of War Henry Stimson, Under Secretary of State Joseph Grew, and Navy Secretary James Forrestal came to advocate revision of the surrender conditions in such a way as to allow the Japanese to maintain the monarchical system under the present dynasty. This concession, they argued, would strengthen moderate elements that surrounded the emperor and induce them to seek early surrender.\n\nStalin-Truman meetings: July 17 and July 18\n\nTruman tells Stalin half-truth about the atomic bomb\n\nPotsdam proclamation\n\n47 Byrnes, Speaking Frankly, 208.\n\nI must frankly admit that in view of what we knew of Soviet actions in eastern Germany and the violations of the Yalta agreements in Poland, Rumania and Bulgaria, I would have been satisfied had the Russians determined not to enter the war. Notwithstanding Japan’s persistent refusal to surrender unconditionally, I believed the atomic bomb would be successful and would force the Japanese to accept surrender on our terms.\n\n41The “timetable” that Truman and Byrnes had worked out became clear. Truman’s intention was to gain Japan’s surrender with the atomic bomb before the Soviet entry, and Stalin’s objective was to enter the war before Japan’s surrender. It was, indeed, a “race to the finish.”\n\nStalin’s reaction to the Potsdam proclamation\n\n44The Potsdam Conference was over on August 2, and the Soviet delegation left Berlin that day and returned to Moscow on August 5. On August 3, Chief of Staff Colonel-General S.P. Ivanov and “Colonel General Vasiliev: (Vasilevskii’s nom de guerre) sent an important report on the situation of the front to Stalin and Antonov.\n\n46This report suggests that the change of the date of attack from the previously agreed August 11 to August 9-10 was more than likely a response to a Stalin request to move up the date. Since this report was dispatched on August 3, Stalin’s request must have been sent earlier than that date. It is most likely, although it cannot be determined from any available sources, that the order was issued from Potsdam on July 30, at the same time when Vasilevskii was officially appointed the commander of the Soviet Army in the Far East, after Truman rejected Stalin’s last attempt to obtain the Western Allies’ invitation to join the Potsdam ultimatum. Vasilevskii’s request for instructions regarding questions of a “political and diplomatic nature” strongly suggests that the change of date was dictated by political motivations arising from the Potsdam ultimatum.\n\nThe Americans drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima\n\nSoviets declare war on Japan\n\nJapan accepts surrender\n\nSoviet military operations and Stalin-Truman diplomatic maneuvers\n\n62An interesting aspect of this order was that the islands to be seized included not only Shimushu and Paramushiru, but also Onekotan, which belonged to the American zone of operation. Without knowing how the United States would react to the Soviet Kuril operation, Stalin had to be cautious. By including Onekotan, he would be able to test the American reaction. If he met with opposition from the Americans, he would retreat. If not, he would expand operations in the central and southern Kurils.\n\n74Stalin realized, however, that his August 22 message might have backfired. Now it was necessary to back off. He sent his reply to Truman on August 30. He regretted that a “misunderstanding” had slipped into their correspondence. He agreed to grant the landing rights to the United States on one of the Kuril islands in emergency cases during the Allied occupation of Japan, and even grant an airfield for landing commercial planes. But in return, he expected the United States to provide an American airfield for Soviet commercial planes on one of the Aleutian Islands. Needless to say, there was no commercial airline in the Soviet Union at that time, so this was also a ploy. The timing of this response is also important. The three days between the two letters brought the Soviet operations further south in the Kurils.\n\n76The next day, on September 2 Japan formally signed the surrender documents on the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. But the Soviet forces had not completed the occupation of the rest of the Kurils. Kunashiri was not captured until September 3. From there the Soviets proceeded to occupy Shikotan and the Habomai group, which historically, administratively, and geographically belonged to Japan, and should have been in the American occupation zone. The occupation of all the Kurils was not completed until September 5, three days after the Pacific War was officially over.\n\nConclusion\n\n77During World War II, Stalin was not only concerned with the survival of the Soviet Union, but also with capturing the territories that would guarantee its security from its potential enemies. At the Yalta Conference, Stalin scored a diplomatic victory by having Roosevelt and Churchill offer him prizes in exchange for Soviet participation in the war three months after the capitulation of Germany. But in order to gain these war trophies, he had to enter the war, and conclude an agreement with the Chinese confirming the Yalta conditions.\n\n78Thus, for Stalin, the major challenge was to prolong the war long enough for the Soviets to join it. A number of problems confronted him in pursing this policy. First, he had to justify the violation of the Neutrality Pact with Japan. In April 1945, Molotov renounced the Pact, but made it clear that the Pact would be in force until April 1946. It was necessary to “lull the Japanese to sleep,” under the pretense of neutrality, while behind the cloak of neutrality, the Soviets rushed troops and equipment to the Far East to prepare for the war against Japan. The Soviet Union also exploited Japan’s overtures to the Soviet Union to mediate for peace, first through the Hirota-Malik negotiations, and later through the proposal to send Prince Konoe to Moscow as the emperor’s special envoy. Nevertheless, there still remained the major problem of waging war against Japan in violation of the Neutrality Pact. And the negotiations with the Chinese were deadlocked.\n\n79In order to resolve these two issues, Stalin expected Truman’s support at the Potsdam Conference. By emphasizing that the Soviet pledge to enter the war remained firm, Stalin attempted to solicit Truman’s help to put pressure on the intransigent Chinese. But most importantly, Stalin expected, as he had been promised by Hopkins in May that the United States and Britain would invite the Soviet Union to sign the joint ultimatum against Japan.\n\n80The first atomic explosion in New Mexico changed the American policy. Truman and Byrnes were now convinced that the Americans had acquired a weapon to force Japan’s surrender before the Soviets entered the war. They encouraged the Chinese to stand firm to drag on the negotiations, and the American delegation at Potsdam totally excluded the Soviet Union from the deliberations of the Potsdam Proclamation. Truman’s less than candid revelation about the atomic bomb piqued Stalin’s suspicion, but the most decisive turning point for Soviet policy came when the United States announced the Potsdam Proclamation, without any prior notification to the Soviet delegation.\n\n81Stalin was now convinced that the United States was determined to secure Japan’s surrender before the Soviets entered the war. Nevertheless, even Stalin could not convince the Stavka to change the carefully planned military operation against Japan, which was scheduled to commence on August 11 on all fronts. The US dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, however, shocked Stalin. He believed that the game was over. But the Japanese request to seek Soviet mediation immediately revived his hope. He changed the date of the attack by forty-eight hours to August 9, and had Molotov read the declaration of war one hour before the Soviet attack. Stalin succeeded in joining the war in the nick of time.\n\n82Japan’s delay in accepting the Potsdam terms unconditionally gave the Soviets time to advance deep into Manchuria. The emperor’s acceptance of unconditional surrender on August 14 triggered more intensive Soviet military operations. The Stavka sent airborne units to capture key Manchurian cities, including Port Arthur and Dairen. The Hokkaido-Kuril operation began hastily. Stalin initially wished to seize not only the Kurils, but also the northern half of Hokkaido, but Truman intervened firmly to prevent Stalin’s huge appetite from going beyond the Yalta Agreement. In order to prevent the Soviets from obtaining a slice of Hokkaido, however, Truman had to sacrifice the Kurils, although he knew that the islands, or at least some of them, should belong to Japan.\n\n83Stalin managed to acquire much of what he wanted, although he did not gain an occupation zone either on Hokkaido or in Tokyo. In the process, however, he alienated the Japanese by seizing what the Japanese believed to be their own legitimate islands by violating the Neutrality Pact, especially when the Japanese were desperately seeking his mediation. Just as in Europe, Stalin’s Far Eastern acquisitions made Soviet security precarious in the long run.\n\n84Stalin’s approach to Japan was motivated by his geostrategic interests, pure and simple, and had little to do with Marxist-Leninist ideology. He pursued his goals ruthlessly employing Machiavellian manipulations. But so did Truman. Both were, to borrow the title of David Holloway’s recent article, “jockeying for position in the postwar world.” Truman’s use of the atomic bomb was perceived by Stalin as a means to intimidate the Soviet Union, making subsequent Soviet policies more intransigent rather than more amenable. The atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not the first salvo of the Cold War, as the revisionist historians claim, but contributed to the exacerbation of Soviet-American relations, preparing the ground for the transition from the Grand Alliance to the Cold War."
