        "text": "Stalin in power, 1928-53:\n\nThe elimination of Stalin’s opponents:\n\nBetween 1923 and 1928, the leadership struggle changed the nature of the Communist Party.\n\nBetween 1917 and 1922, Lenin’s government was quite pluralistic.\n\nPluralism denotes a diversity of views or stands rather than a single approach or method\n\nStalin had transformed the Party in four ways:\n\nHe had established an ideological orthodoxy.\n\nDestroyed the authority of the other main contenders.\n\nHe changed the nature of Party membership.\n\nHe had created the patronage system.\n\nBy doing so, he took victory and destroyed the political authority of his key rivals.\n\nLeadership in the Soviet Union:\n\nLenin’s leadership was based on his personality and his authority.\n\nHe was able to lead because he had the respect of all his senior colleagues.\n\nThey knew that he had masterminded the revolution and that the government that emerged reflected his vision.\n\nIn that sense, he was leader of the USSR because he was Lenin, not because he held official positions.\n\nReplacing Lenin was not a matter of winning a post in the government.\n\nRather each of the contenders had to persuade the Communist Party that they were a true Leninist\n\nThe Politburo had emerged as the most powerful part of the government.\n\nTherefore gaining a majority in the Politburo was the key to power in the USSR.\n\nWinning a majority in the Politburo meant winning votes at the Party Congress as the Party Congress elected the Central Committee.\n\nThey in turn elected the Politburo.\n\nThe battle for leadership was a battle for support within the Party, not within the USSR.\n\nStalin’s rivals for power in 1923:\n\nThe leadership struggled was prompted by Lenin’s declining health.\n\nLenin had become unwell towards the end of 1921, in May 1922, he had the first stroke that left him unwell to work.\n\nBy mid-1923, it was obvious that Lenin would never return to government.\n\nA struggle began at the top of the Party which had a big impact on the government of the USSR.\n\nFrom 1923 there were 4 key contenders who had a chance of becoming leader:\n\nZinoviev, Bukharin, Trotsky and Stalin.\n\nThey all had a significant degree of authority in the Party.\n\nGregory Zinoviev:\n\nZinoviev emerged as the front-runner to lead the USSR in 1923.\n\nHe claimed to be a true Leninist as he was Lenin’s closest friend.\n\nThe two spent so much time together that Zinoviev’s handwriting became like that of Lenin.\n\nZinoviev also support Lenin since the beginning of the Bolshevik movement in 1903.\n\nHe became Lenin’s right hand man.\n\nBetween 1923 and 1925, Zinoviev led the Triumvirate with him, his friend Kamenev and Stalin.\n\nThey formed a majority in the Politburo.\n\nThe alliance kept Trotsky out of power and laid the foundations for Stalin’s power.\n\nZinoviev and Kamenev persuaded the Central Committee to ignore Lenin’s Testament which contained an instruction to sack Stalin.\n\nStalin therefore retained his position at the top of government.\n\nZinoviev also created a very effective political strategy which denied Trotsky power.\n\nHe made a lot of speeches about the difference between Leninism and Trotskyism.\n\nThe point was to get rid of Trotsky’s power and that he was not a Leninist.\n\nNikolai Bukharin:\n\nFrom 1925 to early 1928 Bukharin was the most prominent figure in soviet government.\n\nIn 1925 he formed an alliance with Stalin known as the Duumvirate.\n\nThis gave Bukharin and Stalin a majority in the Politburo due to the support of more junior members who were allies of Bukharin.\n\nHe claimed to be a true Leninist for a number of reasons:\n\nHe joined the Bolshevik faction in 1906 and support Lenin until his death.\n\nLenin and Bukharin were close.\n\nLenin entrusted Bukharin with a series of important jobs such as editorship of the Soviet newspaper Pravda.\n\nIt was widely known that Bukharin and Lenin had disagreed over issues.\n\nIn 1918 they disagreed over ending WW1 and in 1921 over the introduction of the NEP.\n\nMany also believed that he was too young and inexperienced to be leader.\n\nTrotsky:\n\nMost famous member of government other than Lenin.\n\nWell known as a revolutionary hero due to the role he played in the Revolution as well as the Civil War.\n\nHe had also been Lenin’s right man.\n\nHe was not popular within the Communist Party.\n\nMany communists remembered that between 1903 and 1917 he had opposed Lenin.\n\nTrotsky had joined the Bolsheviks in mid-1917 and many Bolsheviks believed that he joined the Party to gain power rather than he was because he was a true Leninist.\n\nThere was a lot of disagreement about the timing of the October Revolution and the NEP in 1922.\n\nThere was a lot of evidence that Zinoviev was right and Trotsky was not a true Leninist and therefore did not deserve to lead the Party.\n\nTrotsky kept his position in his Politburo until 1927 but had no real influence.\n\nStalin:\n\nStalin was a big part of the Politburo majority between 1923 and 1928.\n\nHe played a supporting role, letting Zinoviev and then Bukharin play the leading roles in the Triumvirate and then the Duumvirate.\n\nStalin claimed to be the true Leninist for a lot of reasons.\n\nHe joined the Bolsheviks at the very beginning in 1903 and loyal to Lenin.\n\nStalin began to be disloyal to Lenin in 1922 when Lenin was too ill to fight back.\n\nLenin trusted Stalin in high regard and trusted him with important administrative tasks.\n\nHe also promoted him to the position of General Secretary in 1921.\n\nThe Communist Party in 1928:\n\nLeadership struggle led to a series of big changes in the Party.\n\nIn general terms the Party became more centralised and disciplined as a result of the struggle as the contenders tried to gain power over the Party.\n\nIdeological orthodoxy:\n\nIn order to win the leadership struggle, Stalin had to establish that he was the true Leninist.\n\nThis changed the nature of the Party by establishing an ideological orthodoxy.\n\nBetween 1917 and 1928, the Communist Party included members who believed a variety of different things.\n\nDuring the leadership struggle Stalin and his allied discredited a number of ideas, which became known as Trotskyite.\n\nBy 1928, the Communist Party was committed to two ideas which Stalin believed in:\n\nSocialism in one country:\n\nStalin and Bukharin had advocated the idea that the USSR could construct socialism.\n\nTraditionally, Marxists assumed that socialism could only be achieved following a global revolution.\n\nIn that sense, constructing socialism was believed to be a global project and not something that could be done in one country.\n\nFrom 1924, Bukharin and Stalin argued that the USSR could build socialism without a revolution.\n\nThey argued that socialism in one country was the correct Leninist idea.\n\nAlso that Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev were Trotskyites, rather than Leninists, because they wanted to wait for a global revolution before socialism.\n\nCollectivisation and industrialisation:\n\nIn 1928, Stalin argued that the time was right to abandon the NEP and transform the Soviet economy.\n\nLenin had argued that the NEP would “last a while but not forever”.\n\nThis statement was vague but Stalin argued that Lenin’s commitment to the NEP was pragmatic.\n\nWhen the economy under the NEP stopped growing in the late 1920s, Stalin argued that peasants should be forced to work on state-owned farms.\n\nThe profit they produced should be used to industrialise the USSR quickly.\n\nHe also argued that Bukharin’s desire to continue the NEP indicated that Bukharin was no longer a true Leninist.\n\nThis new ideological orthodoxy was a big change in the nature of the Party.\n\nLenin had tolerated differences of view at the top of the government and was prepared to work with people he disagreed with.\n\nStalin argued that Trotskyites and Bukharin’s followers posed a threat to the Party.\n\nHe therefore had Zinoviev, Kamenev and Trotsky arrested and Trotsky expelled from the Party and the USSR.\n\nAuthority at the top of the Party:\n\nUnder Lenin there were many people who had authority within the Party.\n\nStalin, Trotsky, Bukharin, Zinoviev and Kamenev all enjoyed the respect of significant parts of the Party.\n\nTherefore all had power bases within the Party.\n\nStalin’s strategy for emerging as leader was to destroy the authority of his opponents.\n\nHe undermined them by:\n\nEstablishing a new ideological orthodoxy and branding opponents enemies of Leninism.\n\nDemanding that Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev apologise to the Party for the errors when they lost votes at the Party Congress.\n\nAccusing Bukharin, Zinoviev and Kamenev of plotting against the Party and forming a faction; and these were serious crimes as Lenin had banned factions in 1921.\n\nBy 1928, the Party had been transformed from an organisation in which there were a large number of people who had a degree of authority to an organisation in which Stalin had a near monopoly of authority.\n\nSignificantly, Stalin did not succeed in completely destroying Bukharin’s authority by 1928.\n\nBukharin was still regarded highly by the Party, even though his policies were rejected.\n\nParty membership:\n\nAnother change in the Party introduced by Stalin to help win the leadership struggle was an increase in Party membership.\n\nIn 1924, Stalin initiated the Lenin Enrolment.\n\nFrom May 1924, Lenin Enrolment allowed 128,000 people to join the Communist Party.\n\nStalin justified this by saying that the Party needed new working-class members.\n\nIn practice, the new members were poorly educated people who wanted good paying jobs.\n\nDue to their lack of education, the new members were suspicious of Trotsky and Bukharin, the Party’s leading intellectuals.\n\nHowever, they were interested in getting well-paid Party jobs they tended to support Stalin as he was able to promote them within the Party.\n\nBy 1928, the Party was quite different to the Party of 1921.\n\nThe new recruits were less interested in ideas or the goals of the revolution and more interested in their careers.\n\nStalin’s patronage system:\n\nParty democracy also weakened between 1921 and 1928.\n\nIn 1921, the Party was based on Democratic Centralism.\n\nAll Party members voted for delegates who attended the Party Congress, which elected the Central Committee.\n\nFrom 1923 Stalin began to issue an “approved list”.\n\nRather than having a free choice, local parties were encouraged to send delegates to the Party Congress from the approved list.\n\nIn 1923, approximately ⅓ of the delegates at the Party Congress were selected from Stalin’s list.\n\nAs the 1920s went on, this figure grew, giving Stalin more control over the Party Congress.\n\nStalin also had a number of positions in the Party which helped him win support by acting as patron.\n\nAs General Secretary, he could give well-paid and powerful jobs to lower-ranking Party members.\n\nEqually as head of the Central Control Commission and the Rabkrin he had the power to investigate and, if necessary, sack Party members and government officials.\n\nStalin’s power to promote and sack Party members meant that he could count on the loyalty of Party members who wanted to retain their positions or get a promotion.\n\nChanges in the Party increased Stalin’s power.\n\nThey also led to a change in the nature of the Party:\n\nFirst, from the mid-1920s the Party increasingly had the role of administering and implementing the decisions of the Politburo and the leader.\n\nParty members became known as “apparatchiks”, people who worked in the Party “apparatus”, implementing orders rather than thinking creatively about politics.\n\nSecond, the Party became increasingly privileged.\n\nPeople with full-time positions in the Party were known as the nomenklatura.\n\nThese were people who enjoyed power and status due to their Party position, and ultimately to patronage.\n\nIn this sense, under Stalin the Party ceased to be full of dedicated revolutionary radicals and became full of professional administrators dedicated to their own careers.\n\nThe purges of the 1930s:\n\nStalin was the undisputed leader of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union by 1928.\n\nHe was still insecure that he would lose power.\n\nHe was concerned that:\n\nHis own supporters were prepared to challenge his authority.\n\nHis old rivals would conspire against him.\n\nStalin responded to these threats by launching the Great Terror, a campaign of arrests, torture, mass imprisonments and executions that finally removed his opponents.\n\nThe Great Terror was at its height from 1935 to 1938.\n\nIt was responsible for the deaths of around 10 million Soviet citizens, which was nearly 10% of the population.\n\nCauses of the purges:\n\nThe Great Terror had several causes.\n\nThey were all related to Stalin’s desire to safeguard his position.\n\nOpposition:\n\nOpposition from the Politburo was one of the causes of the Great Terror.\n\nBy 1932, there was a group of moderates in the Politburo associated with Sergei Kirov, head of the Communist Party in Leningrad.\n\nKirov and the moderates were able to force some changes in policy in the early 1930s.\n\nIn 1932, Kirov defended Martemyan Ryutin.\n\nRyutin had circulated a document that was highly critical of Stalin’s policies.\n\nHe also formed the Union of Marxists Leninists, an opposition group which included supporters of Bukharin, Zinoviev and Trotsky.\n\nStalin demanded his execution.\n\nKirov with the support of Politburo moderates, argued successfully that he should be sent to prison.\n\nIn 1933 Kirov and the moderates argued for more realistic targets in the Second Five-Year Plan and for a greater emphasis on the production of consumer goods.\n\nKirov’s growing authority within the Party was clearly a challenge to Stalin.\n\nEconomic problems:\n\nEconomic problems were also a cause of the Great Terror.\n\nFirst, senior figures within government were aware of the problems with Stalin’s industrial and agricultural policies, which undermined Stalin’s authority in government.\n\nSecondly, by accusing workers and managers of being wreckers and saboteurs Stalin could blame them for the problems.\n\nRather than accepting responsibility for the failure of his policies.\n\nFinally he sent wreckers and saboteurs to Gulags, which were huge labour camps.\n\nHe used them as an army of slave labour, which he could use to build factories or mine resource.\n\nThe Congress of Victors:\n\nEvents during the Congress of Victors, held in February 1934, also indicated that Stalin’s position was under threat.\n\nStalin came second to Kirov in the vote at the end of the Congress which elected the new Central Committee.\n\nKirov received 1225 votes compared to Stalin’s 927.\n\nSenior members of the Party approached Kirov, urging him to stand against Stalin as General Secretary.\n\nKirov refused, and the vote was kept secret.\n\nNonetheless, the Congress demonstrated that Stalin had a rival in the Communist Party.\n\nKirov’s murder:\n\nFinally, Kirov’s murder was a useful pretext for launching the terror.\n\nKirov was murdered in December 1934.\n\nSome historians speculate that Stalin ordered the attack, but no proof has ever been found.\n\nThe murder did remove Stalin’s main rival.\n\nThe murder allowed Stalin to claim that there was a dangerous conspiracy that aimed to overthrow the Communist Government.\n\nIn that sense, it gave Stalin a reason to arrest his rivals and launch a mass terror campaign.\n\nThe Great Terror, 1934-38:\n\nThe Great Terror started in Leningrad in December 1934.\n\nRight after Kirov’s murder, Stalin arrested Zinoviev and Kamenev and organised an investigation into the Communist Party in Leningrad.\n\nThe Great Terror spread throughout the USSR in 1936 and reached its peak in 1937.\n\nShow trials:\n\nThe most public aspect of the terror were three show trials that took place in 1936, 1937 and 1938.\n\nThese removed Stalin’s rivals:\n\nThe Trial of the 16, 1936, led to the execution of Zinoviev, Kamenev and 14 of their supporters.\n\nThe Trial of the 17, 1937, led to the execution and imprisonment of 17 of Trotsky’s former supporters.\n\nThe Trial of the 21, 1938, led to the execution of Bukharin and many of his supporters.\n\nNot only did the trials lead to the deaths of Stalin’s former rivals, but they also destroyed the reputations of the key defendants.\n\nAll of the defendants confessed to plotting to murder Kirov and working with capitalist nations to overthrow the USSR.\n\nThe show trials were a tiny fraction of the Great Terror.\n\nThe terror also affect all aspects of the Party and the government.\n\nIndeed, 95% of those affected by the terror were men between the ages of 30 and 45 who held senior positions in the Party or an important role in the economy.\n\nSecret trials:\n\nIn addition to the public trials, Stalin organised a trial of the Red Army’s leaders.\n\nIn 1937, 8 senior generals were tried for plotting to overthrow the government.\n\nThe 8 leaders had worked with Trotsky when he was head of the Red Army.\n\nTherefore Stalin did not trust them.\n\nAll were executed.\n\nFollowing the trial more than 37,000 officers were purged from the army.\n\nConsequences of terror:\n\nThe Great Terror led to big changes in government:\n\nEliminated Stalin’s rivals from the 1920s.\n\nAlso led to the death or imprisonment of a whole generation of communists who had known and worked with Lenin.\n\nHe removed all Party members who could claim authority that was independent from Stalin.\n\nLed to the emergence of a new generation of Communist Party leaders who owed their positions to Stalin and were loyal.\n\nEstablished the principle that Stalin had the right to use terror against anyone who was disloyal.\n\nStalin’s political police, the NKVD became a powerful organisation within the regime.\n\nConsequently, Beria, Stalin’s NKVD chief from 1938, also became a powerful figure within the government.\n\nOverall, the Great Terror established that Stalin was the only source of authority in the USSR.\n\nOther politicians and the Party itself could not be trusted.\n\nOnly Stalin could be trusted to defend the USSR.\n\nStalin’s power over party and state:\n\nStalin dominated both party and state.\n\nThe relationship between the Party and the state in the USSR was complicated and changed over time.\n\nCrucially, Stalin use the changing relationship between the two organisations to his advantage.\n\nThe party and state’s relationship:\n\nStalin inherited the Communist Party and the Soviet State from Lenin.\n\nLenin had created both but had failed to define the relationship between them.\n\nIn 1917, Lenin established a state based on the soviets.\n\nAs non-Communist political parties were outlawed, the Communist Party, rather than the state, became the most powerful organisation in the USSR.\n\nThe exact relationship however, between the Party and the State was never defined.\n\nMoreover, the relationship changed in the period 1928-53.\n\nStalin used the vagueness of the relationship between the Party and the state to his advantage throughout the 1940s and the early 1950s.\n\nWW2:\n\nThe Second World War led to a change in the relationship between party and state.\n\nA change that emphasised Stalin’s power.\n\nFrom 1928, Stalin had been the most powerful man in the Communist Party.\n\nIt was only in 1941 that Stalin became Chair of Sovnarkom – the most senior committee.\n\nThis change reflected the need for an efficient government during wartime.\n\nStalin’s government in the 1930s had been grossly inefficient.\n\nIndeed, by purging the senior levels of the state, the Party and the military he had sabotaged the effectiveness of all aspects of the government.\n\nNonetheless the government needed to run effectively in order to win the war.\n\nTherefore from 1941 Stalin took the leading position in the state, as well as the Party, in order to ensure better co-ordination of government.\n\nAs well as becoming Chair of the Council of Ministers, Stalin promoted effective government during the war in the following ways:\n\nEnded mass terror to help them work more efficiently during war.\n\nAllowed state power to grow – done to let State Ministers make important decisions.\n\nChanged the composition of the Politburo – Ministers joined the Politburo and members of the Politburo were given important jobs.\n\nThis meant that the Politburo increasingly co-ordinated state activity as well as Party activity.\n\nCreated the State Defence Committee (GKO).\n\nResponsible for economic co-ordination and military production and defence during the war.\n\nCompetition between party and state:\n\nFollowing the war Stalin used the party-state relationship to his advantage by encouraging competition between the two organisations.\n\nFirst, he did this by appointing rival personnel to key positions in the Party and State.\n\nFor example, he placed Andrei Zhdanov, Beria’s key rival, in charge of Party supervision of Beria’s political police.\n\nEncouraging competition between Party and state officials meant that senior officials in the Soviet Government competed with each other and not with Stalin.\n\nSecond, Stalin shifted power from the Party to the state and back again.\n\nIn 1938, the Politburo was the most senior committee in government.\n\nBy 1942, the GKO was the most powerful committee, and after the war, the Council of Ministers became more powerful.\n\nBy shifting the centre of power within the government.\n\nStalin was able to ensure that none of these senior committees grew to rival him.\n\nPost-war terror:\n\nA final way in which Stalin held onto power was the continued use of terror.\n\nHe did not use terror to the same extent after the war as he had in the 1930s.\n\nNonetheless, by purging hundreds of Party and state officials in his last years he inspired fear in thousands more.\n\nThe Leningrad Affair, 1949:\n\nDuring 1949, Stalin launched a purge against the Leningrad Party.\n\nStalin was concerned that Leningrad, Russia’s second city, was developing a degree of independence from his powerbase in Moscow.\n\nAround 100 officials were shot and 2000 arrested and dismissed.\n\nSignificantly, the Leningrad Affair may also have been part of the struggle to replace Stalin that emerged in the late 1940s.\n\nIn 1948, Stalin celebrated his 70s birthday.\n\nClearly, his life was coming to an end.\n\nTwo of the main rivals for his position were Beria and Zhdanov.\n\nBeria’s powerbase was in the MVD, the political police.\n\nWhereas Zhdanov was the chief of the Leningrad Party.\n\nThe Leningrad Affair follow Zhdanov death in 1949. and one explanation was that Beria encouraged Stalin to purge Leningrad because it contained a group of senior officials, rivals to Stalin.\n\nTesting loyalty:\n\nOne final way that Stalin used was to test loyalty of his allies.\n\nOne way he did this was to imprison or sack the wives and daughters of the senior figures in government.\n\nOne example concerns Vyacheslav Molotov.\n\nOne of Stalin’s closest allies.\n\nMolotov had been a member of the Politburo since 1926 and Minister of Foreign Affairs since 1939.\n\nIn 1948, Stalin demanded that the Politburo vote to expel Molotov’s wife from the Party.\n\nMolotov abstained from the vote and later apologised to Stalin for this disloyalty.\n\nIn 1949, Stalin had Molotov’s wife arrested and imprisoned.\n\nMolotov made no effort to stop the arrest or end the imprisonment.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe struggle for power and the Great Terror transformed the Soviet Government.\n\nUnder Lenin various politicians and the Communist Party itself, had an authority that was independent of Lenin.\n\nMoreover, Lenin established the convention that political terror should never be used against the Party.\n\nThere was room for debate and discussion within the Party.\n\nBy 1938, this had changed, during the 20s, Stalin established a single ideological orthodoxy and a party which rewarded loyalty rather than free discussion.\n\nThe 1920s also saw the authority of Lenin’s closest allies destroyed.\n\nBy 1928, Stalin had full control of the Party.\n\nGreat Terror took this process further.\n\nMany of Stalin’s allies were purged; believed that people were more likely to obey him out of fear over loyalty.\n\nStalin was prepared to rule through terror.\n\nStalin ruled rather than the Communist Party.\n\nParty and state had very limited authority.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
