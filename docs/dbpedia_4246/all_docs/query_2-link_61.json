        "text": "The Russian communist party has called for an investigation into the possible involvement of Western spies in the death of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, suggesting he could have been “poisoned.”\n\n“The party appealed to the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation and the FSB with a request to check the possible involvement of Western intelligence services in the death of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin,” Sergey Malinkovich, chairman of the Communists of Russia party, said Tuesday, according to state-run news agency RIA.\n\n“Many testimonies from Stalin’s contemporaries speak of the possible poisoning of the leader of the Soviet nations by agents of Western influence,” Malinkovich added.\n\nThe request was made on the 71st anniversary of Stalin’s death on March 5, 1953. An autopsy found he died from a haemorrhagic stroke following years of health issues, including an earlier stroke and heart attack in 1945, but conspiracy theories have long circulated about potential foul play.\n\nStalin’s reputation has undergone a rehabilitation in recent years of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s reign, with Stalinists expressing admiration for a man responsible for mass executions, a network of labor camps and forced starvation.\n\nIn 2018, Russia refused to screen a British black comedy film, “The Death of Stalin,” about the dictator’s final hours, with an official from the country’s culture ministry saying it “insults our historic symbols.”\n\nThe Communists of Russia party, established 12 years ago, emerged as a spoiler entity aiming to divert the electorate’s attention from the original Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF).\n\nNotorious for consistently fielding namesake candidates in opposition to the CPRF in nearly every election, their agenda largely revolves around launching vociferous yet futile initiatives. In 2022, they made an audacious plea to both Russian law enforcement and the United Nations to investigate the death of Princess Diana.\n\n“The U.N. must finally investigate this terrible crime after 25 years … It would be appropriate to assign the investigation to the Russian Investigative Committee, given the recurring doubts raised by global media regarding the willingness of British and American investigative authorities to conduct an impartial inquiry into Diana’s demise,” stated a party representative."
