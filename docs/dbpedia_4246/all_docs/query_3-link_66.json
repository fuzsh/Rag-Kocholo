        "text": "I was working as a typist in Churchill’s underground bunker when the war ended. Churchill was always jolly and affable. One night he’d invited me and the other staff to watch a film with him, and we were waiting in the bunker, tired after our shift. All of a sudden, the door burst open and there he was in his pyjamas and dressing gown, whisky in one hand and a cigar in the other, shouting: “Winnie’s here! Let it roll!”\n\nIn July 1945, I was one of only six secretarial staff to accompany Churchill and his team to the Potsdam Conference in Berlin. I was only around 18 and there had been a shutdown of communication during the war so, to me, Joseph Stalin was simply the leader of Russia, like Truman was the leader of the United States. When we talked about Stalin, we’d use the Allies’ nickname for him, “Uncle Joe”.\n\nWe were flown out from Northolt in small military planes, wearing Mae West life jackets and sitting on uncomfortable chairs that I’m not sure were even connected to the floor. We landed in the Russian zone of Berlin, where we had to keep around five different passes on us.\n\nBerlin was decimated. I don’t know why it made such an impression on me, as we’d had dreadful bombing in London, but I was amazed to find the city absolutely flat, with rubble everywhere. The British, American and Russian delegations were staying in these beautiful houses – apparently the occupants had been given just 30 minutes to get out, so there was knitting on the floor and children’s toys everywhere.\n\nOf the three leaders, Stalin stood out to me the most. Truman was quite a short man and didn’t take the limelight, but Stalin you couldn’t mistake. He always wore uniform and had an enormous moustache. He used to go past in his car, heavily armed.\n\nWe didn’t see a great deal of the leaders, as we were working so hard all day preparing documents for their secret meetings at Cecilienhof Palace. Apparently, Stalin insisted that each of the heads of state entered the room by a different entrance, and Churchill was made to go downstairs, outside and round the house. I can’t imagine him taking kindly to that, but Stalin had the upper hand, I’m afraid.\n\nDuring the conference, there were echelons of people and we, the secretarial staff, were at the very bottom. But every now and again we were invited to some of the more formal events. I remember at one, the three leaders were standing in a line, heavily flanked. Truman didn’t wear uniform, so was in a suit, and Churchill was in his sort-of uniform, a lightweight thing soldiers might wear in the desert. But Stalin was a formidable presence. He stood out in his military jacket as I lined up to shake his hand.\n\nI can’t remember much about that moment, but I know I kept quiet about it for a long time, as I thought it wasn’t a very good thing to say I’d shaken hands with Stalin. It was really just because he was there.\n\nIn the end, Russia were very demanding allies. Churchill was livid, because Stalin asked for so much – food, military equipment, other supplies – and he wanted it all straightaway."
