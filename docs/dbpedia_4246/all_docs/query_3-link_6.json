        "text": "Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin were political rivals. After Vladimir Lenin, the first Soviet head of state, suffered a stroke in early 1923, Trotsky and Stalin engaged in a contest for power. Stalin quickly gained the upper hand: in April 1923 he consolidated his hold on the Bolshevik Central Committee. Trotskyâ€™s attempts to attack Stalin thereafter were largely unsuccessful. Still, the contest endured into the late 1920s. Stalin eventually emerged as its victor and gained virtual dictatorial control over the Soviet Union. Trotsky, on the other hand, was expelled from the Bolshevik Party (1927), exiled (1928), and banished from the territory of the Soviet Union (1929)."
