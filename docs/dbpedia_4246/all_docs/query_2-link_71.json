It is your duty to the memory of your great grandparents, grandparents and parents, for there was no tragedy in human history when more representatives of a single nation were destroyed in one peaceful year than during the several years of a war.

The totalitarian Stalinist regime in the former Soviet Union led to horrifying human rights violations which deprived millions of people of their right to life.\n\n3. One of the most tragic pages in the history of the peoples of the former Soviet Union was the mass famine in grain-growing areas of the country which started in the late 1920s and culminated in 1932–33.\n\n4. Millions of innocent people in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine, which were parts of the Soviet Union, lost their lives as a result of mass starvation caused by the cruel and deliberate actions and policies of the Soviet regime.\n\n5. In Ukraine, which suffered the most, the peasantry was particularly hit by the Great Famine and millions of individual farmers and members of their families died of hunger following forced “collectivisation”, a ban on departures from the affected areas and confiscation of grain and other food. These tragic events are referred to as Holodomor (politically-motivated famine) and are recognised by Ukrainian law as an act of genocide against Ukrainians.\n\nOSCE\n\nJoint Statement of the OSCE participating States щn the 75th anniversary of the Holodomor of 1932 and 1933 in Ukraine (Madrid, 30 November 2007)\n\nStatement by the Delegation of the Russian Federation: Russia’s position on the Holodomor issue remains unchanged. Millions of citizens of many different nationalities have fallen victim to truly tragic events of 1932-1933 and, accordingly, it would be unfair to talk about the destruction of only ethnically Ukrainian citizens. The famine in the USSR in the 1930s was a consequence of the Soviet policy, the collectivization of agriculture, and the “dekulakization” of the peasantry that was carried out during that period.\n\nStatement by the Delegation of Turkey: We, along with the authorities and the people of Ukraine, are paying homage to the humanitarian catastrophe, which is also a tragic episode in their history. Given the humanitarian impact of this tragedy, our state [as the member of OSCE] cannot distance itself from the statement made by Ukraine. … It seems that the Ukrainian authorities are trying to add the humanitarian importance of this sad event to the desire for political recognition. … When it comes to dealing with such an important issue in the political context, the highest and unchanging principle of Turkey’s policy is that the assessment of historical events should remain the exclusive competence of historians.\n\nOSCE PA\n\nResolution on the Holodomor of 1932–1933 in Ukraine\n\n/…/\n\nThe OSCE Parliamentary Assembly:\n\n7.

Millions of people fell into a mad flames, unable to escape. People were forced to stay in their cities and villages, stayed there to die a horrible death. The Holodomor provoked many horrific consequences—murders, robberies for a piece of bread and many other horrible acts, which in other ordinary conditions people never dare to do.
