        "text": "The story of 250 children competing to win the 1999 Scripps National Spelling Bee in the USA could have been a horrendous look at pushy parents and their over-achieving brats. That it is instead a riveting and hugely enjoyable story is fully down to the charming and eccentric kids who demand your attention as they are put through intense pressure to spell on stage. It acts as a portrait of a nation obsessed with competition, and rising above any class or ethnic barriers to succeed.\n\n27. Sins Of My Father (2009)\n\nDirected by: Nicolas Entel\n\nFor any fans of Netflix’s recent Narcos, this is a definite must watch. Sebastián Marroquín, aka Juan Pablo Escobar, returns to Colombia after more than ten years of exile in order to meet victims of his father, and to apologize to the sons of his most infamous assassinations, that of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan and Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonillo. While the film’s narrative is about tying the reign of Escobar to the more recent violence and fate of the drug trade, at its heart it is a piece about peace and reconciliation, the weight of family history, and whether or not we can ever truly forget or forgive.\n\n26. Supermensch: The Legend Of Shep Gordon (2013)\n\nDirected by: Mike Myers\n\nMarking Mike Myers directorial debut, this is a unashamedly entertaining film about talent manager Shep Gordon, who due to his all-round excellent personality managed to become the manager of Alice Cooper shortly after moving to Hollywood. It’s an improbable story which only gets weirder when you find out he’s become good friends with the Dalai Lama, but the way it’s told is hugely enjoyable. It’s like you’ve been invited to dinner with all these people, when they’re all having the best time sharing stories about each other.\n\n25. Amy (2015)\n\nDirected by: Asif Kapadia\n\nAn icon in her own short lifetime, Amy seeks to separate fact from myth when it comes to Amy Winehouse. Far from the media portrayal of an out of control music star only, we get the portrait of a girl who makes the wrong choices in life and love, and ends up broken hearted and in the thrall of addiction, the only thing that truly made her out of control. It’s sad to see the bright, talented and charismatic woman crumble in front of us, and while the film doesn’t point too many fingers, it makes all of us culpable in her downfall.\n\n24. An Inconvenient Truth (2006)\n\nDirected by: Davis Guggenheim\n\nPerhaps the best thing to come out of Gore’s defeat in his bid to be President of the United States was his renewed focus on educating people about global warming. Back in the ’80s he had put together a rough and ready presentation on a flip chart. Come the ’00s he had updated this to a Keynote presentation he dubbed the “slide show,” and took it back on the road. Producer Laurie David saw one these town hall shows, and decided the message had to spread wider.\n\nGore’s fascinating (and terrifying) slide show makes up the core of the film, but what brings it truly to life is the global sweep of the images – seeing these places on-screen and knowing that we’re all part of the same world. What truly sells the message of imminent disaster though is Gore himself, whose belief is shown through interviews, and getting to know the man behind the message.\n\n23. Dogtown And Z Boyz (2001)\n\nDirected by: Stacy Peralta\n\nThis is the history of skateboarding in Southern California. It’s thrilling, visceral, and lets you into a world you know, but know nothing about. In short, everything a great documentary should be. Peralta was a member of the pioneering Zephyr skateboarding team, made up of teenagers from broken homes and brought together by surfers Jeff Ho, Craig Stecyk and Skip Engblom. They pushed boundaries, invented new moves, and caused skateboarding to go into the mainstream, while defining what skateboard culture meant. Vividly told through up-to-date interviews, archive videos, 8mm and 16mm film, a killer soundtrack, and narration from Sean Penn, Dogtown And Z Boyz is the perfect tribute to these pioneers.\n\n22. Man On Wire (2008)\n\nDirected by: James Marsh\n\nThe biggest issue I had with Robert Zemeckis’ mega-budget recent The Walk was that for all it’s visual wonder, IMAX specific cinematography, charming performances, and vertigo inducing camerawork, it simply wasn’t as compelling as Man On Wire. How could it be? This is the epic tale of Philippe Petit’s 1974 walk across the Twin Towers for real. Director Marsh has frequently referred to his film as a “heist movie,” and that is truly the best description for it. Footage of the preperations, stills from the walk itself (alongside re-enactment) and interviews are placed side by side to show just how Petit pulled off one of the most audacious stunts of all time.\n\nSee also: Robert Zemeckis interview\n\n21. 20 Feet From Stardom (2013)\n\nDirected by: Morgan Nelville\n\nThe most talented performers aren’t always the ones centre stage. Proving that this is far more than mere consolation to those who got close but seemingly haven’t “made it,” Oscar winner 20 Feet From Stardom is a heartfelt, beautifully shot, and intimate look at the background singers. These are the people driven by their passions, who have been instrumental (pun intended) to the music industry as we know it. For them it’s about the singing. And ultimately, you learn that these singers have the longest and most fulfilling careers in the industry.\n\n20. Going Clear: Scientology And The Prison Of Belief (2015)\n\nDirected by: Alex Gibney\n\nGoing Clear is surely one of the most talked about documentaries of the last few years. For good reason too. Director Alex Gibney applies an amazing thorough investigative approach to Scientology, and pulls together a film which crystallizes all the disquieting things you’ve been reading/thinking/suspecting about Scientology and what lies under the surface. Split into three parts, concerning the history of the movement, former members, and allegations of abuse by its leaderships, Going Clear is a disturbing look at the nature of power.\n\n19. March Of The Penguins/La Marche De L’empereur (2005)\n\nDirected by: Luc Jaquet\n\nShot over the course of one year, this extraordinary film charts the annual journey of Antarctica’s Emperor penguins as they leave the ocean to return to their ancestral breeding grounds inland, in an effort to court and breed. That’s not all though, as once a chick is born, the parents must continue these trips to ensure its survival. The heartwarming simplicity of the film won over millions of fans, and established that a expertly crafted nature doc could cross cultural and language boundaries to unite audiences.\n\n18. Blackfish (2013)\n\nDirected by: Gabriela Cowperthwaite\n\nThis could turn out to be one of the most influential documentary films of recent times.\n\nThe story of how Seaworld trainer Dawn Brancheau was dragged into the water and killed by a bull orca called Tilikum, and whether his life in captivity drove him to be ultra-aggressive, rose to international prominence and put the practices of Seaworld firmly in the limelight. Made for a mere $76,000, Blackfish is estimated to have put a dent into Seaworld’s profit of over $10 million, and cost the firm a further $15 million in putting out adverts contradicting the claims within. If the film was poorly made, and easy to dispute, they may have had more luck. The fact that’s it’s a well researched and compelling piece of filmmaking has proven to be disastrous for Seaworld.\n\n17. The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (2003)\n\nDirected by: Kim Bartley, Donnacha O’Briain\n\nFascinating and hugely controversial, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised gave viewers unprecedented access to Venezuela’s larger than life Presdient Hugo Chavez during the events of the 2002 coup against him.\n\nFilmed on the streets of Caracas and in the heart of the presidential palace of Miraflores, this is a real life political thriller where the fate of a nation lies in the balance. It also serves to examine the media’s role in the coup, deconstructing just how they portrayed each side, and where their allegiances lay (not with Chavez). But on the flip-side, this is a film that can be said to be almost propaganda for Chavez and his revolution. Did Bartley and O’Briain, the Irish directing duo, manipulate images to their own end? We may never know, but the result is a fascinating close-up examination into two sides of a coup.\n\n16. The Act Of Killing (2013)\n\nDirected by: Joshua Oppenheimer Co.D. Christine Cynn, Anonymous\n\nNot for the faint of heart, The Act Of Killing is a raw and powerful examination of the 1965-66 Indonesian Killings, an anti-communist purge following a failed coup. One of the most notorious killers, Anwar, is the main subject of this film – invited by Oppenheimer he takes to re-enacting scenes of his kills, direct to camera, but in the style of his favorite films – western, musical, gangster. Surreal and bizarre, the real crimes at the heart of the film are not forgotten though, as the film builds to a compelling rooftop confrontation where Anwar is finally put in his victim’s shoes. It’s an unforgettable experience.\n\n15. Overnight (2003)\n\nDirected by: Tony Montana, Mark Brian Smith\n\nOvernight charts the rise and fall of director Troy Duffy, who made the frankly terrible but weirdly beloved Boondocks Saints. It’s an unflattering portrait of an ego out of control, who time and time again is seen to make awful creative decisions, abuse friends and colleagues, and destroy his one chance to make a film career for himself due to his out of control behaviour. It was also filmed at his request. I implore you to seek out and watch this film. It is self-destructive behavior at its most impressive, and the worst thing of all is that Duffy seems to deserve it. You cannot help but wait with anticipation to see what he does next to screw up. As a cautionary tale, Overnight is superb, and hugely watchable.\n\n14. Deep Water (2006)\n\nDirected by: Louise Osmond, Jerry Rothwell\n\n1968’s Golden Globe Race, sponsored by the Sunday Times, is considered by many to the the greatest boat race in history. Before GPS, carbon-fibre, and sailing as sports entertainment, ten sailors set out to circumnavigate the world. Some of were the finest on the water. Some were weekend sailors. None remained unchanged from the experience. The favorite was Frenchman Bernard Moitissier, who became depressed during the voyage at sailing’s commercialization, fired a sling-shot message into a passing passenger ship which announced his resignation from the race, and promptly sailed onto Tahiti.\n\nBut the most incredible and tragic story is the subject of Deep Water. Amateur sailor Donald Crowhurst entered the race to save his ailing business. He then secretly quit the race, reported false positions, and disappeared. This film attempts to understand him, and the nature of loneliness at sea. What happened to Crowhurst is elegantly and beautifully examined here.\n\n13. Citizenfour (2014)\n\nDirected by: Laura Poitras\n\nA real-time documentary about the eight days where Edward Snowden revealed the shocking revelation of how far-reaching NSA surveillance was, his flight from Hong Kong, and eventual asylum in Russia, Citizenfour succeeds in taking on the subject of global surveillance and making it personal – perhaps the only thing that will get people to sit up and care. Far from the faceless anonymity of the agencies, or the unpleasant personality of Julian Assange and grandstanding of WikiLeaks, Citizenfour makes the threat of government interference in our lives very real, and through Snowden, a seemingly decent guy caught up in an international manhunt, hugely relatable.\n\n12. Dig! (2004)\n\nDirected by: Ondi Timoner\n\nFull disclosure: I am in Dig! Specifically asleep in the middle of the crowd during The Dandy Warhols’ 2001 Reading set which features here… What I didn’t sleep through however, was this documentary, which proves that no matter how talented you are, how many people you reach through your art, and how much success you achieve, you can still be an absolute dick. Charting the rivalry between the bands The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols, Dig! is a fantastic and funny expose of the petty jealousies that everyone falls prey to, but some more than others. The fact that both bands reportedly hate the film is proof positive that it’s doing something right.\n\n11. Bowling For Columbine (2002)\n\nDirected by: Michael Moore\n\nThirteen years on and even more relevant than ever. Bowling for Columbine is the perfect showcase for Moore’s rabble rousing populist style of documentary making, with his plea for actual gun control on the US packing an emotional punch, fully served by the visuals at his command. Whether it’s montages set to The Beatles Happiness Is A Warm Gun, scenes of getting a free gun for opening a bank account, or the stats on murder rates in countries with gun control, Bowling For Columbine is never subtle, but always engaging and provocative – exactly what is needed for this subject.\n\nSee also: Michael Moore interview.\n\n10. Jodorowsky’s Dune (2013)\n\nDirected by: Frank Pavich\n\nThere’s been something of a cottage industry recently in documentaries about the making of a lost film/masterpiece – including DOOMED! The Untold Story Of Roger Corman’s Fantastic Four, and Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey Of Richard Stanley’s Island Of Dr Moreau – but this one is surely the best. Director Frank Pavich found a unique theory beyond “this film would have been amazing,” in that what if Jodorowsky’s Dune concepts, ideas, and creative team actually laid the framework for the genre and cinema defining sci-fi of the ’70s and ’80s? It’s an arresting idea, and after watching this film you might just be inclined to believe it. Jodorwosky’s Dune truly is a tribute to creativity, visionary genius, and the sheer difficulty in bringing an original concept to screen.\n\nSee also: Frank Pavich interview\n\n9. Searching For Sugar-Man (2012)\n\nDirected by: Malik Bendjelloul\n\nSixto Rodriguez was an American musician who had a very brief career in the ’70s, releasing two albums that for most of the world sank without trace. But in South Africa he’s a legend, with his records outselling Elvis. Searching For Sugar-Man is the story of two of his fans, who after hearing their idol has committed suicide, set out to seek the truth. A documentary about faith in your heroes, the nature of fandom and success, and a portrait of an enigmatic musician, Searching For Sugar-Man is joyous, uplifting, and truly special. It’s also a tribute to director Bendjelloul, who brought the story to life so brilliantly – but who sadly committed suicide in 2014.\n\n8. Exit Through The Gift Shop (2010)\n\nDirected by: Banksy\n\nIs the entire film just one more act of cultural satire from the infamous Banksy? Allegations of the whole thing being a hoax continue to persist, but even taken at face value, Exit Through The Gift Shop is a razor sharp look at the street art scene, and how the dividing line between the genuine talents and the hyped up wannabes is almost non-existent.\n\nSupposedly telling the story of Thierry Guetta, a French immigrant living in Los Angeles, and his fascination with British artist Banksy, the film charts the rise of popularity of street art, coupled with the weird and fascinating success of Guetta himself. Banksy takes aim at a lot of subjects in the film, himself included, and proves that he has an innate understanding of cultural obsessions and trends.\n\n7. Anvil! The Story Of Anvil (2009)\n\nDirected by: Sacha Gervasi\n\nAlmost the antithesis of Dig!, Anvil! is a beautiful, sugary sweet tale of a hair metal band who had everything, then lost it, and now just want to keep on rocking. The central pair of singer/guitarist Steve Kudlow and drummer Robb Reiner have an intense bond, forged over 30 years of playing together, while failing to reach the riches and heights of their contemporaries. But while success always seems out of their grasp, the conflicts in the film are always about the music, and their passion for it. You get the feeling that as long as the crowd is happy, they’re happy too.\n\nFirst-time director Sacha Gervasi, who prior to this had been a successful screenwriter and roadie for the band in their ’80s heyday, has a perfect command on the narrative, building to a redemption of sorts for the band, but more importantly seeding the theme of doing what you love for the right reasons through the whole thing.\n\n6. Food Inc. (2008)\n\nDirected by: Robert Kenner\n\nOver the last several years, it seems that every week I have someone ask me, “have you seen Food Inc?” while in any conversation around, involving, or even tangential to food. And for good reason, as the film exposes the insidious US corporate farming techniques which have pumped our food cycle full of hormones, damaged the environment, and needlessly harmed thousands of animals. It truly is must-see if you care at all about what you eat, and just how it gets to your plate. Concise, thorough, and deadly in its attacks on the food industry, Food Inc. is as relevant now as when it was made.\n\n5. Senna (2010)\n\nDirected by: Asif Kapadia\n\nAbsolutely thrilling and emotionally draining, Senna broke through into mainstream consciousness via a recognised story full of hidden insights. You know the ending, but how many knew the man. Ayrton Senna had a reputation for being an arrogant driver, but as Senna so artfully shows, he was a man of passion, and for whom racing meant everything. Senna strikes at the core of what makes elite sports people tick, and plays out almost as a live-action thriller due to the huge wealth of material available. While the fateful final lap is heart in mouth, for me it is the moment he manages to lift the trophy after improbably winning the Brazilian Grand Prix that had me in tears – a true testament to the power of the man.\n\nSee also: Asif Kapadia interview, on directing Senna\n\n4. The Imposter (2012)\n\nDirected by: Bart Layton\n\nIn my opinion, this was easily the best film on 2012. In fact, I can’t remember a film since (or for that matter before) which left me so open-jawed in surprise at the twist and turns it took. In 1993, young Texan boy Nicholas Barclay disappeared. But in 1997 he was apparently found in Europe, and flown back home. However, in reality it was French con-man Frederic Bourdin, who despite having brown hair and brown eyes, instead of Nicholas’ blonde hair and blue eyes, was accepted into the family as the missing son. While in itself this would be enough for any documentary, The Imposter merely uses this as a springboard to an even greater mystery. No thriller can compare to just what occurs within this film.\n\n3. Waltz With Bashir (2008)\n\nDirected by: Ari Folman\n\nAn animated film about the 1982 Lebanon War doesn’t strike you as the most obvious route to take about the Middle East conflict, but Waltz With Bashir is one of the best films made this century. Drawn from director Ari Folman’s own experiences as a soldier in the war, Waltz With Bashir is primarily concerned with Folman revisiting his days as a soldier to understand why he cannot remember that period. Through meeting fellow soldiers, friends, reporters, and psychologists, a terrible truth is revealed to him. The use of animation is truly genre-bending, and makes Waltz With Bashir a cinematic experience unlike any other. Far from downplaying the serious nature of what’s at stake, the animation only serves to heighten the waking nightmare of war. The lesson of the Middle East has never been delivered so adroitly.\n\n2. Touching the Void (2003)\n\nDirected by: Kevin MacDonald\n\nHaving a captivating and simple central premise for your documentary helps a lot. In this case, climber Joe Simpson’s miraculous escape from being left for dead at the bottom of a crevasse, after his climbing partner Simon Yates was forced to cut their rope. But that can only get you so far.\n\nIn Kevin MacDonald’s hands, the ill-fated expedition to Siula Grande in Peru is a masterpiece of adventure survival. The reconstructions, so often the bane of documentaries, are so superb they rank amongst the greatest staged climbing action ever. But it’s the interviews with the two principles, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, that the documentary amazingly becomes a riveting psychological thriller. These are two men who are defined, linked, and forever associated by this one event, and while they both made it off the mountain, its clear they’ll always be there, no matter what they say outwardly.\n\n1. Grizzly Man (2005)\n\nDirected by: Werner Herzog\n\nDocumentaries can pack huge emotional punches, open your mind to a world you never knew existed, make you consider wildly different views, and act as some of the most thrilling filmmaking on the planet. Rarely do they do all of this at the same time. Grizzly Man is that rare documentary. The story is famous, bear enthusiast and environmentalist Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard were killed and eaten by a grizzly bear, after years of controversially living with and documenting them in the wild.\n\nBut the doc is so much more than their fate."
