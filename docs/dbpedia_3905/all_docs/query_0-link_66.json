        "text": "When Agnès Varda died, it seemed as if she had already said everything about her life and work. Long before her death from cancer on March 29, 2019, she had begun to create her own memorial with autobiographical films, books and lengthy interviews.\n\nWe knew the story of her early career as a filmmaker just before the French New Wave, of which she would be the only female director; her meeting with director and soon-to-be husband Jacques Demy in the late 1950s, her feminist commitments, her friendships (with actresses Jane Birkin, Delphine Seyrig and so many others); her films (Cléo de 5 à 7 (Cleo from 5 to 7), in 1962, Sans Toit ni Loi (Vagabond), in 1985, Les Glaneurs et la Glaneuse (The Gleaners and I) in 2000), which, although they were never great popular successes, won over critics and arthouse audiences alike; her base in Rue Daguerre, in the 14th arrondissement of Paris, where she lived and worked from 1951 onwards.\n\nWhen she died at the age of 90, her archives were almost in order, passed on by her two children, Rosalie Varda-Demy and Mathieu Demy. Varda's work and her memory would live on. But, like so many filmmakers, they could have faded with the years.\n\nNumerous events\n\nFour years after her death, this summer of 2023 takes the form of a powerful global Varda festival. Numerous events reveal many of the sides of this multifaceted personality, who was simultaneously a filmmaker, photographer, artist and activist. Two exhibitions are taking place, in Arles: as part of the Rencontres de la Photographie with \"La Pointe courte. From Photographs to Film,\" devoted to images from the shooting of her first film, in the fishermen's quarter of Sète; the other, at the Fondation LUMA, \"Un Jour sans Voir un Arbre est un Jour Foutu\" (\"A Day Without Seeing a Tree is a Wasted Day\"), whose title is a phrase gleaned from a memo in Varda's personal archives, which will show her work as a visual artist.\n\nBut that's not all: In Los Angeles, the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures is devoting an exhibition to her until January 2025. In Paris, in October, the Cinémathèque is also preparing a tribute entitled \"Viva Varda!\". A documentary will be broadcast this autumn on French television channel Arte. And books are coming out like never before: a biography by Laure Adler from Gallimard, announced for the fall literary season, an expanded reprint of her autobiography, Varda par Agnès (\"Varda by Agnès\"), from Editions de La Martinière, and two books from Editions Delpire & co, including one on La Pointe courte (June 2023)."
