        "text": "Children under quarantine are enjoying an excess of “screen time,” if only to give their overtaxed parents a break. But there’s no reason they can’t learn a few things in the process. These nature documentaries have educational value for the whole family, while also offering a chance to experience the great outdoors from inside your living room.\n\n‘The Living Desert’ (1953)\n\nDisney’s True-Life Adventures series is a fascinating experiment in edu-tainment, an attempt to give nature footage the quality of a Disney animated film, with dramatic confrontations and silly little behavioral vignettes. There are more entertaining examples than “The Living Desert” — the 1957 gem “Perri,” about the plight of a female tree squirrel, is an ideal companion piece for “Bambi” — but it was the company’s first attempt at a feature-length documentary and established a formula that would be used decades down the line. Shot mostly in the Arizona desert, the film marvels over the animals that live in such an austere climate while also focusing on familiar scenarios, like two male tortoises tussling over a female or scorpions doing a mating dance to hoedown music.\n\nStream it on Disney Plus. Rent it on Apple TV, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.\n\n‘Microcosmos’ (1996)\n\nA typical nature doc is culled from hours and hours of patient observation by camera crews in the field, but insects usually play a supporting role at best, for the obvious reason that their behavior can’t be detailed by the naked eye. But through the special lenses created for the French documentary “Microcosmos,” ants and spiders and ladybugs have the presence of amazing prehistoric creatures or the foes in an old “Godzilla” movie. The film has all the action of other documentaries of its kind — the labors of survival, the dance between predator and prey, the sheer beauty of nature — but these underfoot nuisances have a revelatory sophistication when blown up in the frame. Scarab beetles, for example, might seem too gross to consider, but in close-up, who can’t relate to the Sisyphean labor of pushing balls of dung uphill?\n\n‘March of the Penguins’ (2005)\n\nThere’s a generally a ceiling on how well nature documentaries can do in theaters, but “March of the Penguins” was a blockbuster event — not merely by nature-doc standards, but by the nine-figure standards of major-studio tentpoles. And for good reason: The plight of the beautiful emperor penguins of Antarctica was framed as the ultimate love story and an affirmation of family values. Trekking across the unforgiving polar tundra to breeding grounds far from the sea, the male and female penguins mate for life, and that’s only the beginning of relationships in which the males protect the eggs, the females strike out to the seas for food and each family’s precarious survival is at stake.\n\nRent it on Apple TV, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.\n\n‘Life’ (2009)\n\nIt was no easy feat for David Attenborough and the BBC Natural History Unit to follow up their 11-part behemoth “Planet Earth,” which in 2006 was the most expensive series of its kind and the first to deploy high-definition cameras. But “Life” was equal to the task, with its enormous scope and timely main theme, which is about what living things must do to survive. There’s a simple genius to the conceit: It allows the series to engage both with the survival tactics of individual species and the way plants and animals have had to make rapid adjustments to a landscape altered by climate change and other forms of human intervention. The 10 episodes are neatly divided in broad categories like “Mammals” and “Fish,” but it’s worth paying special attention to an hour on plants, which don’t often get the spotlight.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
