        "text": "A high school business teacher recently asked other teachers for recommendations on business movies or documentaries that she could show her students as a treat at the end of the semester. That got us to thinking about our favorite business movies and documentaries, and we decided to create this ultimate list business movies and documentaries.\n\nATTENTION HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS – IMPORTANT NOTE – some of these movies have strong adult language or situations. So please watch the movie before showing to your students and use your judgement about what your students and school administrators are comfortable with. Watching business documentaries and movies with your students can be a fun treat and a great conversation starter about the big issues related to success or failure in business.\n\nBrick By Brick: Inside Lego (documentary)\n\nThis short (20 minute) documentary focuses on the recent business turnaround of the iconic toy company Lego. The Denmark-based toy maker was in trouble in the early 2000s. It had overextended, lost its identity, and was bleeding money. New CEO Jørgen Vig Knudstorp’s strategy refocused the company on its core business, and Lego rebounded to become the world’s fastest-growing toy company.\n\nEdison – American Experience (documentary)\n\nBy the time he died in 1931, Thomas Edison was one of the most famous men in the world. The holder of more patents than any other inventor in history, Edison had amassed a fortune and achieved glory as the genius behind such revolutionary inventions as sound recording, motion pictures, and electric light.\n\nEDISON explores the complex alchemy that accounts for the enduring celebrity of America’s most famous inventor, offering new perspectives on the man and his milieu, and illuminating not only the true nature of invention, but its role in turn-of-the-century America’s rush into the future.\n\nSteve Jobs: One Last Thing (documentary)\n\nSteve Jobs was one of the most revered entrepreneurs and designers of our time. As co-founder, he created Apple Computer, was tossed out of the company, and the returned to lead the company to historic business heights. In the PBS documentary “Steve Jobs: One Last Thing,” the filmmakers trace Jobs’ inspiring career and lasting legacy in technology and retail, as well as his legendary product presentations.\n\nThe Insider\n\nBased on a true story, and starring Al Pacino and Russe Crowe, The Insider is a film about a research chemist comes under personal and professional attack when he decides to appear in a “60 Minutes” expose on Big Tobacco. The movie was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor in a Leading Role (for Russell Crowe).\n\nDo you have a favorite business movie or documentary that we missed? Email us today to let us know, and we’ll update this list.\n\nJeff Rutherford"
