History[]

Janet Damita Jo Jackson was born on May 16, 1966 in Gary, Indiana to Joe and Katherine Jackson.

Janet Jackson began her career performing at the MGM Grand. Later she performed on her brothers' TV show, "The Jacksons" in 1976 along with older sisters Rebbie and La Toya Jackson. In 1978, for a short time the three sisters were a girl group, however they soon disbanded over creative differences. She then decided she wanted to be a race-horse jockey.

In 1982 however, her father forced her to sign to A&M Records, and she released her self-titled debut album later that year. Its promotion had little participation from Janet, who did not want a career in music at that time. Her sophomore album, "Dream Street" did little better when released in 1984. She then eloped with James DeBarge, however they divorced later that year, and in 1985 it was annulled. Her father then made her quit her race-horse jockey dreams, and her third album, "Control" was released in 1986. It was a huge success, many comparing it to her brother Michael's album, "Thriller". In 1989, her fourth album, "Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814" was released, and also was a huge success, many praising her as a positive role-model for young girls.

In 1991, she secretly married René Elizondo Jr. She then left A&M Records, and signed to Virgin Records, where she broke her good-girl image with her highly sexual fifth album, "janet." in 1993. Her sixth album, "The Velvet Rope" followed in 1997, after years of depression and anxiety. Since 1991, it was believed that Janet had been dating Elizondo, however they announced separation in 1999, which the public thought meant they were breaking up.

In 2000, Elizondo and Janet's marriage is revealed when Elizondo announces they were divorcing. The following year, her seventh album, "All for You" was released, and her eighth album, "Damita Jo" followed in 2004, and received heavy criticism due to its sexual nature, that was deemed more lustful than her 1993 album. Her ninth album, "20 Y.O." was released in 2006, and faced similar reviews commenting that her hip hop move was not helping her. She left Virgin in 2007, and signed to Island Records. Her tenth album, "Discipline" was then released in 2008, and she left Island soon after. She returned to A&M Records in 2009.

Janet released her eleventh album Unbreakable in 2015. She married Wissam Al Mana in 2012. Their son Eissa Al Mana was born on January 3, 2017.
