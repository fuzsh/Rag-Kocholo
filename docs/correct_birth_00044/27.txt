Janet Jackson was born May 16, 1966, in Gary, Indiana, to a family full of talent.

Jackson was the youngest of ten children. Brandon, a twin to her brother Marlon, died shortly after birth, before she was born.

When Jackson was born, the Jackson 5 had already been a hit. The band was originally made up of five of her brothers — Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon and the late Michael Jackson. The band was managed by their father. Popular songs by the band include "ABC" and "I Want You Back."

Jackson began a career in the entertainment business at a young age. After appearing on "The Jacksons" TV series with her siblings in 1976 and 1977, she earned herself a part in the show "Good Times." She was also in the TV series "Fame."
