        "text": "Janet Jackson reportedly asked child welfare authorities in Malibu, Calif., to do a welfare check on her one year-old son, Eissa, according to TMZ. Jackson, 52, called late Saturday night (June 2) to request that police check on her son, who was staying with Jackson’s estranged ex-husband, Wissam Al Mana, at the Nobu Hotel.\n\nAfter checking in, police reportedly found no one in danger and suggested that the parties handle the matter personally. The site reported on Monday morning (June 4) that Jackson was worried that Al Mana was using drugs around their child. A spokesperson for Jackson could not be reached for comment at press time.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nJackson was married to Quatari businessman Al Mana for four years. Their son was born in January 2017, just four months before the couple announced their split. On his official website, Al Mana has a message of love to his son, which reads, “To my beloved son Eissa/ You are a blessing and a joy/ I will always love you unconditionally/ Protect you and guide you through this life.”\n\nA spokesperson for Al Mana could not be reached for comment at press time; Billboard was also unable to reach a representative at the L.A. Country Sheriff’s Department at press time."
