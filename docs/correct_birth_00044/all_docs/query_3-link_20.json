        "text": "Music icon Janet Jackson, 50, gave birth on Tuesday (January 3) to a son named Eissa. It was People magazine that posted the first pics of pregnant Janet in October, and today a rep for the singer told the publication, “Janet Jackson and her husband Wissam Al Manaa are thrilled to welcome their new son Eissa Al Mana into the world. Janet had a stress-free, healthy delivery and is resting comfortably.”\n\nIn October, Janet told People “We thank God for our blessing,” and as you may remember, last April the singer abruptly put her Unbreakable World Tour on ice and revealed to the fans it was to have a child.\n\n“My husband and I are planning our family, so I’m going to have to delay the tour,” Jackson said on a video posted via her Twitter account. “Please if you could, try and understand it’s important that I do this now. I have to rest up. Doctor’s orders. I have not forgotten about you. I will continue the tour as soon as I possibly can.”\n\nJackson and Al Mana have been married since 2012 and this is their first child together."
