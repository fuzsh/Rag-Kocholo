        "text": "Janet Jackson 1966–\n\nSinger, actress\n\nMusic Moved Her\n\nGained Confidence with Control\n\nBona Fide Superstardom\n\nJustice and Janet.: Two New Personae\n\nSelected discography\n\nSources\n\nBorn into one of the most successful musical families in the history of pop, Janet Jackson began her entertainment career as a television actress but established herself as a singing star of the first order by the end of the 1980s. At the tender age of sixteen she released her first album, and though it took a few years before she scored any large-scale hits, she soon rivaled the astonishing success of her superstar brother Michael. She not only released a number of smash singles but also received many awards from her peers and from numerous civic organizations,\n\nShe was born in 1966 to Joseph and Katherine Jackson in Gary, Indiana, the youngest of nine children. When five of her brothers—known as the Jackson 5—became pop superstars in the early 1970s, the family moved to California. Janet’s first stage appearance was in a Las Vegas revue when she was seven years old. Unlike her brothers, Janet first made her way into the public eye through acting: at age eleven she landed the role of Penny on the situation comedy Good Times. Parts in the series Diffrent Strokes and Fame followed, as Janet Jackson grew up before the nation’s eyes. It was at the urging of her father that she ventured into music. “My dad would tell me, ’You have to do this and this and this,’” she told Us magazine. “And I’d just say ’Okay,’ and do it.” Later on, Jackson remembered in a Rolling Stone interview, she told her father she didn’t want him to manage her any longer: “I couldn’t say the words—I was bawling like a baby—and finally he just said: ’You don’t want me involved in your career. Isn’t that it?’ ‘Yes,’ I finally had the nerve to say, ‘that’s it.”’\n\nMusic Moved Her\n\nJanet’s debut as a recording artist came with her 1982 album Janet Jackson, released by A&M Records. Although the album’s highest-charting single failed to reach the Top 40, she established her own following by touring high schools to promote it and to encourage students to stay in school. She threw her family a curve in the summer of 1984, however, when she eloped with singer James DeBarge. The two announced their nuptials in September of that year from Michigan, though the wedding was annulled by the following spring and Jackson ended up returning to her family’s home in Encino, California. “I went through a lot, from age 15-1/2 to about 19 years,” she disclosed to Ebony in a 1993 interview. “I was very young. I used to hurt so badly that I’d ask God why, what have I done to\n\nAt a Glance…\n\nBorn Janet Jackson on May 16, 1966, in Gary IN; daughter of Joseph (a music manager) and Katherine Corse Jackson (a homemaker and sales clerk; married James DeBarge (a singer), September 1984 (annulled 1985); married Rene Elizondo (film director, actor), March 1991 (separated 1999).\n\nCareer: Actress on television series Good Times, Diffrent Strokes, and Fame, beginning 1977; recording and performing music artist, 1982—; guest artist on Herb Alpert’s album Diamonds, 1987; signed recording contract with Virgin Records, 1991; songwriter, co-producer of own album janet., 1993; actress in film Poetic Justice, 1993; songwriter, co-producer of The Velvet Rope, 1998; songwriter, co-producer of All for You, 2001; actress, Poetic Justice, 1993; actress, The Klumps, Nutty Professor II, 2000.\n\nAwards: Platinum records for Control, 1986, Rhythm Nation 1814, 1989, and janet., 1993; voted top R&B artist, top pop singles artist female, top dance sales artist, and top dance club play artist, 1986, by Billboard; American Music Awards for best R&B single (“Nasty”) and best female R&B artist, 1987, for favorite dance single and soul/R&B single (“Miss You Much”), 1990; and for favorite pop/rock female artist, soul/R&B female artist, and dance/music artist, 1991; MTV Video Music Awards, 1987 and 1991; Grammy Award for best music video, 1990; three Soul Train Awards, 1990; awarded star on Hollywood “Walk of Fame” during “Janet Jackson Week,” Los Angeles, 1990; Billboard-Tanqueray Sterling Artist of Achievement, 1990; songwriter of the year, BMI Pop Awards, 1990; Chairman’s Award, NAACP, 1992; Sammy Davis, Jr., Award for Entertainer of the Year, 1992; American Music Awards, Award of Merit, 2001; Inaugural honoree as an Icon by MTV, 2001.\n\nAddresses: Record company— Virgin Records, 338 N. Foothill Rd, Beverly Hills, CA 90210.\n\ndeserve any of this? I feel now He was preparing me for this, for the future. That’s the way I see it.” In the wake of the marriage’s annulment, Jackson was comforted by longtime friend Rene Elizondo, with whom she later developed a romantic relationship.\n\nNovember of 1984 saw the release of Jackson’s sophomore effort, Dream Street. Despite the participation of producers Giorgio Moroder and Jesse Johnson and a duet with pop legend Cliff Richard, the record didn’t sell spectacularly. Not until her next album, Control, did Jackson become a contender in the pop world. Teamed with hot R&B producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who co-wrote much of the material, Jackson seemed in her musical element at last. “She had made two records with producers who basically said, “Here’s the song, go in and sing it,’” Jam told Steve Pond of Us. “And when she started working with us, she expected us to do the same thing. But you have to remember that it really wasn’t her idea to be a singer. It was really her father’s, and she’s gone from basically doing something that her father suggested to really enjoying it and feeling confident about it.”\n\nGained Confidence with Control\n\nReleased in 1986 and promoted domestically with a 13-city tour, Control began to move thanks to the single “What Have You Done for Me Lately,” which rose to the top of the R&B chart. During the album’s lengthy stay on the British pop chart, it reached the Number Eight position; in the United States it fared even better, topping the album chart and achieving platinum status. Thanks to the smash singles, “Nasty,” “When I Think of You,” “Let’s Wait Awhile,” “The Pleasure Principle,” and the record’s title track, the 20-year-old Jackson became the youngest artist to attain the number one position on the U.S. charts since Stevie Wonder reached it at age thirteen. Control went on to sell eight million copies.\n\nJackson performed at the 1987 Grammy Awards but didn’t take home any statues; she was to be compensated generously in the ensuing years. She did, however, come up the winner in several categories of Billboard magazine’s year-end survey. Also, the video for “Nasty” —choreographed by rising star Paula Abdul—won a trophy at the MTV Video Music Awards. In November, A&M released Control — The Remixes, a collection of eight alternate versions of Jackson’s hits.\n\nBona Fide Superstardom\n\nThough she began work on it in 1988, Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814 did not hit the stores until the fall of the following year. Jackson described it to Essence as an album “containing my views about what was going on in the world and the problems we have in trying to educate the kids and give them hope.” Working again with Jam and Lewis, Jackson proved that Control’s success was no accident. The album topped the U.S. charts four weeks after its release and produced hit after hit, including “Miss You Much,” “Escape,” the hard-rocking “Black Cat,” “Come Back to Me,” and “Love Will Never Do (Without You).” Jackson again performed at the Grammy Awards and again went home empty-handed, though the album’s long-form video counterpart won a trophy. Yet Jackson received her share of honors, including a Los Angeles celebration of “Janet Jackson Week,” a star on Hollywood’s “Walk of Fame,” and an array of Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards, and Soul Train Awards. BMI honored her as songwriter of the year in 1990, “Janet Jackson’s year,” according to Essence writer David Ritz.\n\nUltimately, Rhythm Nation 1814 —the number refers to the year in which the National Anthem of the United States was composed—became the first album ever to have seven of its singles on the Billboard Top Five; four of those singles reached the Number One position. Jackson’s 1990 World Tour was an enormous success; she shared the wealth it generated by donating 25 cents from each ticket sold to the Cities in Schools program, which works to keep kids from dropping out of school. After the tour ended, she gave nearly a half-million dollars to the United Negro College Fund in the form of a “Rhythm Nation Scholarship.” In 1991 she signed a recording contract with Virgin Records that, at $50 million, stood as the most lucrative in history—for about a week, after which time it was surpassed by brother Michael’s new deal with Sony.\n\nJackson received a Chairman’s Award from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1992 in recognition of her public service work, especially on behalf of young people. “I don’t consider myself a social leader,” the singer told Essence, “but I do feel a responsibility that comes with being an entertainer. For me the big issues all come down to the children. What are we doing to protect them, to make their future world better? I’ll never stop fighting illiteracy and drugs [and helping organizations that work to combat AIDS],” she added.\n\nAs she addressed these large issues, however, she found increasing public attention focused on conflicts within her family. Public acrimony between her sister LaToya—also a performer—and the rest of the Jackson clan gained considerable publicity, and Janet was forced to comment, admitting the rift. She told Ritz of Essence that she tried to reestablish contact with LaToya, but “communication between us has proved impossible.”\n\nMeanwhile, she and Michael appeared together on the 1993 Grammy Awards, where he jokingly stated that their dual appearance put to rest rumors that they were the same person. Entertainment Weekly’s David Browne quipped, “Only Michael would take such a story seriously—after all anyone can see it is he and LaToya who look frighteningly alike.” Janet admitted to competitive feelings with her brother in her Ebony interview, noting that she wants “to break his records,” yet she insisted that this was not mere familial jealousy. “I’m very competitive. If someone is at No. 1 and I’m at No. 2, then I want the No. 1 spot. But I feel there is enough room for everyone. Everyone. I really do. Enough room for Whitney [Houston, megastar soulpop diva], for myself, for my brother, for everyone.”\n\nJustice and Janet.: Two New Personae\n\nThe year 1993 marked not only the release of another massively successful Jackson album, but her first acting role in a feature film. Jackson was cast by director-writer John Singleton, who became a Hollywood sensation with his debut film Boyz N the Hood, to play the lead role in his follow-up effort, Poetic Justice. “It was something about Janet that really made me feel this character was her,” he told Allison Samuels of Upscale magazine. “It’s something about her eyes that are very telling.” Though she grew up in the suburbs, Singleton remarked to Essence that he had “always viewed Janet as the Ultimate Homegirl. She has a secret fire. I call it subdued intensity.” Jackson was advised against accepting the role by some industry figures who wanted her to stay closer to her pop singer persona. “The studio head adamantly warned me against it,” she said. “‘It’s a mistake for your first feature film to be all Black.’ He said it was too ethnic, too artsy, too heavy. ’Make a comedy. Take it easy. Play a character closer to you. Play it safe.’” Instead, Jackson took the role of Singleton’s hairdresser-poet, and prepared by—as Singleton recalled it—“doing hair in a salon on 54th Street in South Central Los Angeles.”\n\nJackson made new friends during the project. She told Ritz: “I met four girls from South Central through John—one of them was a hairdresser—who wound up living with me for eight weeks. We shopped, played, danced, went to Disneyland. We did everything together, we talked long into the night about our lives, opening our hearts to each other. The learning process never stopped.” Nonetheless, she and the film received a less-than-friendly response from critics. Time reviewer Richard Schickel called it “simply awful” and described Jackson’s acting as a non-performance, insisting that she “relates to the camera lens as if it were a mirror.” Entertainment Weekly found the movie a “dawdling mishmash” and had no more praise for Jackson’s work than did Schickel: “Jackson isn’t an inept actress, yet there are no more edges to her personality than there are to her plastic Kewpie-doll visage.”\n\nWhile other artists might have withered at such critical scorn, Jackson seemed to sail past the debacle of the movie’s critical reception and into the glow of her new album’s success. The heavily-promoted janet. presented the singer’s new, sexier image: lusty and independent. The hit singles “That’s the Way Love Goes” and “If” sported steamy videos. Jackson explained to Us that her mother wanted to attend the filming of the latter. “I said, ’Some of my movements are very sexy. They’re not dirty, they’re very sexy. And just by you being my mother, I’d be embarrassed.’ She responded, ’Well, if I make you shy in any way or pull back, then I shouldn’t be there.’ I said, ’No, you can come down if you like.’” Yet, perhaps unsurprisingly, “She wound up not coming.”\n\n“As princess of America’s black royal family,” reasoned Rolling Stone reviewer Toure…, “everything Janet Jackson does is important.” Thus “when she announces her sexual maturity, as she does on her new album, janet., it’s a cultural moment.” Toure… noted that Jackson’s new duties as co-producer somewhat toned down the pyrotechnics of Jam and Lewis, “resulting in a less groundbreaking sound but a wider-ranging album,” and dubbed it a “victory.” Upscale reviewer David Taylor pointed to janet.’s combination “of a variety of musical genres—funk, hip-hop, jazz, rock and rap,” as well as diverse guest vocals from opera star Kathleen Battle and Chuck D of Public Enemy, deeming the 1993 release “without a doubt, an outstanding album.” Entertainment Weekly, meanwhile, found it overproduced, fraught with “Hallmark [greeting card] lyrics,” and uncertain about its own sexual boldness. Nonetheless, the album soon proved that reviews one way or another were immaterial to Jackson’s success as a musical artist. And despite her struggles, as Singleton commented in the Us interview, “The way I look at it, she just has a really good job.”\n\nWith not only a good job, but an incredibly famous family, Jackson was able to team up with one of the most noted entertainers of the twentieth century, her brother, Michael Jackson. The pair teamed up in 1995 to record the single “Scream.” The song was a send up to the many media outlets that had been tormenting Michael in the early 1990s. The video created for the song proved to be one of the most expensive in history and arguably one of the most excitingly choreographed videos ever.\n\nHer Design of a Decade release in 1996 celebrated ten years at the top of the charts for Jackson. The compilation included hits from Control through the janet. album and two new songs, “Twenty Foreplay” and “Runaway” and was also available in video form. But her next feature album, The Velvet Rope, took the newfound sexuality from janet. to the next level. In a 1997 interview with Jet, Janet said “The Velvet Rope will mean different things to different people. To me, it became the concept that allowed me to put into words and music so much of what I’ve been going through. The Velvet Rope is my most personal album.”\n\nThe album included topics on everything from racism to AIDS, same sex love and soft-shelled bondage. But the most revealing portions of the recording would not be decipherable until the announcement in 1999 of a marriage between Jackson and long-time companion, Rene Elizondo. With the announcement that he was filing for divorce from the singer, Elizondo revealed that the pair had been married since 1991. Elizondo went on to file suit against Jackson for $10 million, citing uncompensated work on albums dating back to Rhythm Nation 1814. Jackson had begun publicly recognizing Elizondo’s contributions to her career during the promotion of The Velvet Rope.\n\nJackson was able to keep the turmoil in her relationship out of the press even after the release of such a revealing piece and continued to expand her entertainment career with a successful tour surrounding The Velvet Rope. Her next project had her once again wetting her acting chops in a comedy, starring opposite comedian Eddie Murphy in The Klumps, Nutty Professor II. Her next release, All For You, appeared to be the opposite of The Velvet Rope by trading in the sad solitude for an upbeat and happy song, but still oozed sexuality. The first single, “All For You” was the tenth number one single for the singer so she still had much to celebrate. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Jackson stated, “This album could have ended up exactly like The Velvet Rope because of what’s gone on in my life since then, like the divorce. But I believe we have choices and paths, and it’s about choosing the right path, the promising path.”\n\nWith the success of her eighth album and potential for a promising film career, Jackson’s path appeared to be nothing but promising. She received the Merit award at the 28th annual American Music awards. Janet was also the first artist honored by MTV Icon, a series of programs dedicated to artists they consider music video icons. She also launched an All For You World Tour during the summer of 2001. With more than 30 years in entertainment, Jackson managed to remain an innovator and trend setter in the entertainment business.\n\nSelected discography\n\nJanet Jackson, A&M, 1982.\n\nDream Street, A&M, 1984.\n\nControl, A&M, 1986.\n\n(Guest appearance) Herb Alpert, Diamonds, A&M, 1987.\n\nRhythm Nation 1814, A&M, 1989.\n\njanet., Virgin, 1993.\n\nDesign of a Decade, Virgin, 1996.\n\nThe Velvet Rope, Virgin, 1998.\n\nAll For You, Virgin, 2001.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nRees, Dafydd, and Luke Crampton, Rock Movers & Shakers, Billboard Books, 1991.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nChicago Tribune, April 23, 2001.\n\nEbony, September 1986; September 1993; March 1999.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, May 21, 1993; July 23, 1993; May 4, 2001.\n\nEssence, May 1993, pp. 84-86, 140-142.\n\nJet, November 17, 1997; June 19, 2000; January 29, 2001; April 20, 2001.\n\nNewsweek, July 21, 1986; May 24, 1993, p. 51.\n\nRolling Stone, April 24, 1986; October 19, 1989; June 24, 1993, p. 78; September 16, 1993, pp. 38-43, 82.\n\nTime, April 26, 1993, p. 73; July 26, 1993, pp. 67-68.\n\nUpscale, June 1993, pp. 27-31; September/October 1993, p. 108.\n\nUs, August 1993, pp. 66-74, 92.\n\nOther\n\nAdditional information for this profile was provided by Virgin Records and Levine/Schneider Public Relations press materials, 1993.\n\n—Simon Glickman and Leslie Rochelle\n\nJanet Jackson 1966–\n\nSinger, actress\n\nAt a Glance…\n\nGained Confidence with Control\n\nBona Fide Superstardom\n\nJustice and janet.: Two New Personae\n\nSelected discography\n\nSources\n\nComing from one of the most successful musical families in the history of pop, Janet Jackson began her entertainment career as a television actress but established herself as a singing star of the first order by the end of the 1980s.

The release of her long-awaited janet. album in 1993, along with her motion picture debut in the film Poetic Justice, signaled her transition to grown-up pop idol: sexier, more versatile, and more independent. Though critics largely panned the film and had mixed responses to her album, Jackson managed to redefine herself and stake an even larger claim in the fiercely competitive pop world. Articulating her artistic goals in a Rolling Stone interview, she declared, “I’m talking about responding to the world emotionally, directly. Art that comes from the heart, not the head.”\n\nShe was born in 1966 to Joseph and Katherine Jackson in Gary, Indiana, the youngest of nine children.

After the tour ended, she gave nearly a half-million dollars to the United Negro College Fund in the form of a “Rhythm Nation Scholarship.” In 1991 she signed a recording contract with Virgin Records that, at $50 million, stood as the most lucrative in history—for about a week, after which time it was surpassed by her brother Michael’s new deal with Sony.\n\nJackson received a Chairman’s Award from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1992 in recognition of her public service work, especially on behalf of young people. “I don’t consider myself a social leader,” the singer told Essence, “but I do feel a responsibility that comes with being an entertainer. For me the big issues all come down to the children. What are we doing to protect them, to make their future world better? I’ll never stop fighting illiteracy and drugs [and helping organizations that work to combat AIDS],” she added.\n\nAs she addressed these large issues, however, she found increasing public attention focused on conflicts within her family. Public acrimony between her sister LaToya—also a performer—and the rest of the Jackson clan gained considerable publicity, and Janet was forced to comment, admitting the rift. She told Ritz of Essence that she tried to reestablish contact with LaToya, but “communication between us has proved impossible.”\n\nMeanwhile, she and Michael appeared together on the 1993 Grammy Awards, where he jokingly stated that their dual appearance put to rest rumors that they were the same person. Entertainment Weekly’s David Browne quipped, “Only Michael would take such a story seriously—after all anyone can see it is he and LaToya who look frighteningly alike.” Janet admitted to competitive feelings with her brother in her Ebony interview, noting that she wants “to break his records,” yet she insisted that this was not mere familial jealousy. “I’m very competitive. If someone is at No. 1 and I’m at No. 2, then I want the No. 1 spot. But I feel there is enough room for everyone. Everyone. I really do. Enough room for Whitney [Houston, megastar soul-pop diva], for myself, for my brother, for everyone.”\n\nJustice and janet.: Two New Personae\n\nThe year 1993 marked not only the release of another massively successful Jackson album, but her first acting role in a feature film. Jackson was cast by director-writer John Singleton, who became a Hollywood sensation with his debut film Boyz N the Hood, to play the lead role in his follow-up effort, Poetic Justice. “It was something about Janet that really made me feel this character was her,” he told Allison Samuels of Upscale magazine. “It’s something about her eyes that are very telling.” Though she grew up in the suburbs, Singleton remarked to Essence that he has “always viewed Janet as the Ultimate Homegirh She has a secret fire. I call it subdued intensity.” Jackson was advised against accepting the role by some industry figures who wanted her to stay closer to her pop singer persona. “The studio head adamantly warned me against it,” she said. ‘“It’s a mistake for your first feature film to be all Black.’ He said it was too ethnic, too artsy, too heavy. ‘Make a comedy. Take it easy. Play a character closer to you. Play it safe.’” Instead, Jackson took the role of Singleton’s hairdresser-poet, and prepared by—as Singleton recalled it—“doing hair in a salon on 54th Street in South Central Los Angeles.”\n\nJackson made new friends during the project. She told Ritz: “I met four girls from South Central through John—one of them was a hairdresser—who wound up living with me for eight weeks. We shopped, played, danced, went to Disneyland. We did everything together, we talked long into the night about our lives, opening our hearts to each other. The learning process never stopped.” Nonetheless, she and the film received a less-than-friendly response from critics. Time reviewer Richard Schickel called it “simply awful” and described Jackson’s acting as a nonperformance, insisting that she “relates to the camera lens as if it were a mirror.” Entertainment Weekly found the movie a “dawdling mishmash” and had no more praise for Jackson’s work than did Schickel: “Jackson isn’t an inept actress, yet there are no more edges to her personality than there are to her plastic Kewpie-doll visage.”\n\nWhile other artists might have withered at such critical scorn, Jackson seemed to sail past the debacle of the movie’s critical reception and into the glow of her new album’s success. The heavily promoted janet. presented the singer’s new, sexier image: lusty and independent. The hit singles “That’s the Way Love Goes” and “If” sported steamy videos. Jackson explained to Us that her mother wanted to attend the filming of the latter. “I said, ‘Some of my movements are very sexy. They’re not dirty, they’re very sexy. And just by you being my mother, I’d be embarrassed.’ She goes, ‘Well, if I make you shy in any way or pull back, then I shouldn’t be there.’ I said, ‘No, you can come down if you like.”’ Yet, perhaps unsurprisingly, “She wound up not coming.”\n\n“As princess of America’s black royal family,” reasoned Rolling Stone reviewer Touré, “everything Janet Jackson does is important.” Thus “when she announces her sexual maturity, as she does on her new album, janet., it’s a cultural moment.” Touré noted that Jackson’s new duties as co-producer somewhat toned down the pyrotechnics of Jam and Lewis, “resulting in a less groundbreaking sound but a wider-ranging album,” and dubbed it a “victory.” Upscale reviewer David Taylor pointed to Janet’s combination “of a variety of musical genres—funk, hip-hop, jazz, rock and rap,” as well as diverse guest vocals from opera star Kathleen Battle and Chuck D of Public Enemy, deeming the 1993 release “without a doubt, an outstanding album.” Entertainment Weekly, meanwhile, found it overproduced, fraught with “Hallmark [greeting card] lyrics,” and uncertain about its own sexual boldness. Nonetheless, the album soon proved that reviews one way or another were immaterial to Janet Jackson’s success as a musical artist. And despite her struggles, as Singleton commented in the Us interview, “The way I look at it, she just has a really good job.”\n\nSelected discography\n\nJanet Jackson, A&M, 1982.\n\nDream Street, A&M, 1984.\n\nControl (includes “What Have You Done for Me Lately,” “Nasty,” “When I Think of You,” “Let’s Wait Awhile,” “The Pleasure Principle,” and “Control”), A&M, 1986.\n\n(Guest appearance) Herb Alpert, Diamonds, A&M, 1987.\n\nJanet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814 (includes “Miss You Much,” “Escape,” “Black Cat,” “Come Back to Me,” and “Love Will Never Do [Without You]”), A&M, 1989.\n\njanet.

All I can do is sing from my life.” In addition to establishing herself as a fixture in the firmament of pop music, Jackson has also pursued an acting career—though with decidedly mixed results.\n\nJackson was born in 1966 to Joseph and Katherine Jackson in Gary, Indiana, the youngest of nine children. When five of her brothers—known as the Jackson 5 and led by the charismatic Michael—achieved pop stardom in the early 1970s, the family moved to Encino, California, an affluent section of the San Fernando Valley. I n the interview with Ritz, Jackson recalled her upbringing in the Jackson home there, “with peacocks and llamas and giraffes in the back yard.” When asked if she was lonely, she replied, “At times, yes,” but added, “On certain days, I felt like the luckiest kid in the world.” She called “Hot Fun in the Summertime” by soul-rock sensations Sly and the Family Stone “one of the biggest musical influences of my life,” noting, “I was only 3 years old when that song had me jumping up and down. It made me so happy.” Similarly, 1960s anthems by the Turtles, Simon and Garfunkel, and the Association “are all precious moments to me. They’re about just plain feeling good.”\n\nJackson’s debut stage appearance was in a Jackson 5 revue at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas; she was seven. Unlike her brothers, however, she made her way into the public eye through acting. At 11—after capturing the attention of influential television producer Norman Lear—she landed the role of the abused child Penny on the situation comedy Good Times. Parts on the series Diffrent Strokes and Famefollowed, as Janet Jackson grew up before the nation’s eyes. It was at the urging of her father that she ventured into music.\n\nHer solo recording debut came with Janet Jackson, which A&M Records released in 1982.

She shocked the Jackson clan in the summer of 1984, however, when she eloped with singer James DeBarge. The couple contacted the family from Michigan to announce they’d married, though the wedding was annulled the following spring and Jackson ended up returning to her family’s home in Encino. After the annulment, she was comforted by longtime friend Rene Elizondo, with whom she would later develop a romantic relationship.\n\nA Desire For Control\n\nNovember of 1984 saw the release of Jackson’s sophomore effort, Dream Street. Despite the participation of producers Giorgio Moroder and Jesse Johnson and a duet with pop legend Cliff Richard, the record didn’t exactly set the charts ablaze. “I didn’t quite know how to sing from my life,” she told Ritz. Though it was painful, she told her father she didn’t want him to manage her any longer: “I couldn’t say the words—I was bawling like a baby—and finally he just said:’You don’t want me involved in your career. Isn’t that it?’ “‘Yes,’ I finally had the nerve to say,’that’s it.’”\n\nWith her 1986 release, Control, Jackson at last gave an indication of her potential. The project teamed her with hot R&B producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who cowrote much of the material. Sales of the album surged after the release of the single “What Have You Done for Me Lately,” which moved to the top of the R&B chart. It eventually reached the peak spot on the album chart and achieved platinum status. The twenty-year-old Jackson became the youngest artist to reach the U.S. Number One position since Stevie Wonder reached it at age thirteen.\n\nControl went on to sell eight million copies. Jackson performed at the 1987 Grammy Awards but didn’t take home any trophies. She did, however, win an armload of American Music Awards and came up the favorite in several categories of Billboard magazine’s 1986 year-end survey. A&M soon released Control — The Remixes, a collection of eight alternate versions of Jackson’s hits.\n\nGreater Success with Rhythm Nation\n\nJanet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814, released in 1989, demonstrated even greater pop ambition. “Controlwas an album about what I went through in my life when I was 19 and the self-discovery that resulted,” reads a quote in a Virgin Records biography. “Rhythm Nation contained my views about what was going on in the world and the problems we have in trying to educate the kids—the idea was to give them hope.” Working again with Jam and Lewis, Jackson proved that Control’s success was no accident. Rhythm Nation topped the U.S. charts four weeks after its release and produced a string of hits. The album’s long-form video won a Grammy, and Jackson received her fair share of tributes. These included a Los Angeles “Janet Jackson Week,” a star on Hollywood’s “Walk of Fame,” a meeting with then-President George Bush, and an array of Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards, and SoulTrain Awards. BMI honored her as songwriter of the year in 1990.\n\nRhythm Nation 1814 —the number refers to the year “The Star-Spangled Banner” was written—became the first album ever to have seven of its singles on the Billboard Top Five; four of those singles reached Number One. Jackson’s 1990 World Tour was an enormous success, and some of its profits helped the Cities in Schools program, which encourages students to stay in school. After the tour ended, she gave the United Negro College Fund a “Rhythm Nation Scholarship” to the tune of a half-million dollars.\n\nIn 1991 Janet Jackson signed a huge recording contract with Virgin Records. “A Rembrandt rarely becomes available,” went a quote from Virgin head Richard Branson cited in Rock Movers & Shakers. “When it does, there are many people determined to get it. I was determined.” The deal, at $50 million, stood as the most lucrative in history—for about a week, after which time it was surpassed by her brother Michael’s new deal with Sony. Janet Jackson has admitted to a friendly rivalry with her brother, but her adoration of him is obvious in every interview she gives. It was he, she noted, who gave her the most important early encouragement when she began singing: “Michael told me to’just practice, always have confidence in yourself, and never give up,” ’ she recalled in Jet.\n\nIn 1992 the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) gave Jackson its Chairman’s Award for her public service work, especially on behalf of young people. As she addressed these large issues, however, she found increasing public attention focused on conflicts within her family. Public acrimony between her sister LaToya—also a performer—and the rest of the Jackson clan gained considerable publicity, and Janet was forced to comment, admitting the rift; she later remarked that she found it impossible to communicate with her sister.\n\nMeanwhile, she and Michael appeared together on the 1993 Grammy Awards, where he jokingly stated that their dual appearance put to rest rumors that they were the same person. Michael’s own public troubles—especially public accusations that he had molested a young fan-placed even greater stress on the Jackson clan. During Janet’s 1994 concert tour, reported Robert Christgau in the Village Voice, she asked the crowd to “bow our heads and say a silent prayer for my brother Michael.” Director John Singleton wrote the central role of his 1993 film “Poetic Justice” specifically for Jackson, but her much-hyped return to acting was something of a disappointment. The film fared poorly at the box office, and reviewers were less than kind to its star. “Jackson isn’t an inept actress,” reasoned Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, “yet there are no more edges to her personality than there are to her plastic Kewpie-doll visage.” Yet this relatively unsuccessful detour hardly dented Jackson’s meteoric career.\n\nCelebrated Sexuality\n\nJackson’s 1993 album janet. announced her arrival as an adult pop figure, openly celebrating her sexuality. “I love feeling deeply sexual—and don’t mind letting the world know,” she told Ritz in the Rolling Stone profile. “For me, sex has become a celebration, a joyful part of the creative process.” She added that what “excites me isn’t becoming a bigger star but a better artist, deeper, truer to the things I find exciting.” The album’s guest appearances by opera singer Kathleen Battle and rapper Chuck D. of the celebrated rap group Public Enemy attested to her expanded musical palette.\n\nSome critics considered Jackson at the top of her form with Janef. Rolling Stone’s year-end roundup of major releases found her in “more versatile voice than ever,” adding that she “perches atop the rhythmic percolations—cool, not exactly calm, but collected.” Yet while many applauded Jackson’s newly bold persona, reviewers like Entertainment Weekly’s David Browne felt she sounded “tentative” and found the album “a mess—period.” Even so, it was enormously successful, as was her 1994 tour. “I’ve never seen an arena spectacle to match it,” enthused Village Voice writer Christgau. Rolling Stone criticized its almost mechanical perfection, noting that sometimes “it seemed like the audience was eavesdropping on a shoot for a long-form video rather than being engaged by a performer.”\n\nJackson contributed a song to the soundtrack of the 1994 fashion industry flick Ready-to-Wear (Pret-a-Por-ter). She also appeared on her brother Michael’s 1995 single “Scream” and in its innovative video, which was nominated for several awards. Entertainment Weekly complained that her voice was “buried deep in the [song’s] mix—too bad, since her sweet croon adds what little swing the record has.”\n\nLater that year Jackson’s former label, A&M, released a greatest-hits package which featured selections from Control, Rhythm Nation 1814, her Virgin release, janet, and two new singles, including “Runaway.” Entitled Design Of A Decade 1986-1996, an accompanying home video and laserdisc were also released. At this time there was much speculation that Jackson would return to A&M, or perhaps make a move to another label. All theories were silenced, however, when at the beginning of 1996, Jackson signed a four-album, $80 million deal with Virgin, ensuring future decades of Janet Jackson hits.\n\nSelected discography\n\nJanet Jackson, A&M, 1982.\n\nDream Street, A&M, 1984.\n\nControl, A&M, 1986.\n\nControl—The Remixes, A&M, 1987.\n\n(Contributor) Herb Alpert, Diamonds, 1987.\n\nJanet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814, A&M, 1989.\n\njanet, Virgin, 1993.\n\nVarious artists, Ready-to-Wear (Pret-a-Porter) (soundtrack;appears on “70s Love Groove”), Columbia, 1994.\n\nMichael Jackson, History, Volume 1: Past, Present, and Future (appears on “Scream”), Epic, 1995.\n\nDesign Of A Decade, A&M, 1995.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nRees, Dafydd, and Luke Crampton, Rock Movers & Shakers, ABC/CLIO, 1991.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nBillboard, August 26, 1995; September 2, 1995.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, May 21, 1993; July 23, 1993; December 16, 1994; June 9, 1995; January 26, 1996.\n\nJet, August 8, 1994.\n\nRolling Stone, September 16, 1993; December 23, 1993; January 27, 1994.\n\nVillage Voice, January 4, 1994.\n\nAdditional information for this profile was taken from Virgin Records publicity materials, 1994.\n\n—Simon Glickman\n\nJanet Jackson\n\nSinger, songwriter\n\nFor the Record…\n\nDebut Album\n\nGreater Success with Rhythm Nation\n\nNew Contract, Family Woes\n\n“Deeply Sexual” Persona\n\nImpressive Contract Renewal Deal\n\nSelected discography\n\nSources\n\nPop music diva Janet Jackson has released seven solo albums—five of which have earned multiplatinum sales—and sold more than 40 million albums since 1982, cementing her place in music history and rivaling the success of older brother, Michael Jackson. Her contract with Virgin Records was renewed in 1996 in a four-album deal worth a then-unprecedented $80 million. Jackson continues to record, tour actively, and win awards for her work; she added a fifth Grammy Award to her collection in 2002 for Best Dance Recording for “All for You” from the album of the same name. Also an actress, Jackson appeared in the films Poetic Justice in 1993 and Nutty Professor II in 2000.\n\nHaving grown up in America’s most celebrated musical family—and notably in the shadow of her megastar brother, Michael—Jackson has nonetheless demonstrated a willingness to veer at least briefly from the assured path of mainstream pop. “My concepts are never bright ideas; they’re never notions I think will sell or be trendy or attract new fans,” she insisted to Rolling Stone’s David Ritz. “I don’t think that way.

It was he, she noted, who gave her the most important early encouragement when she began singing: “Michael told me to ‘just practice, always have confidence in yourself, and never give up,’” she recalled in Jet\n\nIn 1992 the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) gave Jackson its Chairman’s Award for her public service work, especially on behalf of young people. As she addressed these large issues, however, she found increasing public attention focused on conflicts within her family. Public acrimony between her sister LaToya—also a performer—and the rest of the Jackson clan gained considerable publicity, and Janet was forced to comment, admitting the rift; she later remarked that she found it impossible to communicate with her sister.\n\nMeanwhile, she and Michael appeared together on the 1993 Grammy Awards, where he jokingly stated that their dual appearance put to rest rumors that they were the same person. Michael’s own public troubles—especially public accusations that he had molested a young fan—placed even greater stress on the Jackson clan. During Janet’s 1994 concert tour, reported Robert Christgau in the Village Voice, she asked the crowd to “bow our heads and say a silent prayer for my brother Michael.”\n\nDirector John Singleton wrote the central role of his 1993 film Poetic Justice specifically for Jackson, but her much-hyped return to acting was something of a disappointment. The film fared poorly at the box office, and reviewers were less than kind to its star. “Jackson isn’t an inept actress,” reasoned Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, “yet there are no more edges to her personality than there are to her plastic Kewpie-doll visage.” Yet this relatively unsuccessful detour hardly dented Jackson’s meteoric career. She appeared in Nutty Professor II with Eddie Murphy in 2000.\n\n“Deeply Sexual” Persona\n\nJackson’s 1993 album janet. announced her arrival as an adult pop figure, openly celebrating her sexuality. “I love feeling deeply sexual—and don’t mind letting the world know,” she told Ritz in the Rolling Stone profile. “For me, sex has become a celebration, a joyful part of the creative process.” She added that what “excites me isn’t becoming a bigger star but a better artist, deeper, truer to the things I find exciting.” The album’s guest appearances by opera singer Kathleen Battle and rapper Chuck D. of the celebrated rap group Public Enemy attested to her expanded musical palette. The album earned five-times platinum sales in December of 1993.\n\nSome critics considered Jackson at the top of her form with janet. Rolling Stone’s year-end roundup of major releases found her in “more versatile voice than ever,” adding that she “perches atop the rhythmic percolations—cool, not exactly calm, but collected.” Yet while many applauded Jackson’s newly bold persona, reviewers like Entertainment Weekly’s David Browne felt she sounded “tentative” and found the album “a mess—period.” Even so, it was enormously successful, as was her 1994 tour. “I’ve never seen an arena spectacle to match it,” enthused Village Voice writer Christgau. Rolling Stone criticized its almost mechanical perfection, noting that sometimes “it seemed like the audience was eavesdropping on a shoot for a long-form video rather than being engaged by a performer.” Jackson also appeared on her brother Michael’s 1995 single “Scream” and in its innovative video, which was nominated for several awards. Entertainment Weekly complained that her voice was “buried deep in the [song’s] mix—too bad, since her swe croon adds what little swing the record has.” A&M Records released a greatest hits collection, Design of a Decade: 1986-1996, in 1995, which earned multiplatinum sales in December of that year.\n\nImpressive Contract Renewal Deal\n\nJackson renewed her contract with Virgin Records in 1996 in a four-album, $80 million deal. The first album to follow was the multiplatinum-selling The Velvet Rope, released in 1997. According to Pamela Johnson of Essence magazine, on the album “[Jackson] speaks with her trademark candor to a range of topics: the unhealed wound that can be manifest in depression, and abused woman confronting her cruel lover, assorted childhood emotional traumas…. Grouped together, the subject matter sounds raw, grim. But as ususal, Jackson turns it into a funky good time.”\n\nInstead of her music, Jackson’s personal life was the focus of attention in May of 2000. Rene Elizondo filed for divorce from Jackson, revealing that the couple had been secretly married since May of 1991. Though initially reported to be an amicable split, Elizondo sued Jackson for $10 million in January of 2001 over the validity of a prenuptial agreement.\n\nAmid the personal turmoil surrounding the divorce, Jackson released All for You in 2001. Jackson told Jeff Gordinier of Entertainment Weekly that the album was “very up.” Gordinier agreed: “There are twinkly disco romps and thumping grooves and cooing effusions of erotic esctasy.” The album reached multiplatinum sales in May of 2001, and the title track earned the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording in 2002.\n\nSelected discography\n\nJanet Jackson, A&M, 1982.\n\nDream Street, A&M, 1984.\n\nControl, A&M, 1986.\n\nControl—The Remixes, A&M, 1987.\n\nJanet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814, A&M, 1989.\n\nJanet, Virgin, 1993.\n\n(Contributor) Ready-to-Wear (Pret-a-Porter) (soundtrack), Columbia, 1994.\n\n(Contributor) Michael Jackson, History, Volume 1: Past, Present, and Future (appears on “Scream”), Epic, 1995.\n\nDesign of a Decade: 1986-1996, A&M, 1995.\n\nThe Velvet Rope, Virgin, 1997.\n\nAll for You, Virgin, 2001.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nRees, Dafydd, and Luke Crampton, Rock Movers & Shakers, ABC/CLIO, 1991.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nBillboard, August 26, 1995, p. 97.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, May 21, 1993, pp. 46-48; July 23, 1993, pp. 42-43; December 16, 1994, p. 64; June 9, 1995, p. 60; May 4, 2001, p. 36.\n\nEssence, May 1998, p. 114.\n\nJet, August 8, 1994, pp. 53-59; February 12, 1996, p. 35; January 22, 2001, p. 34.\n\nRolling Stone, September 16, 1993, pp. 38-43, 82; December 23, 1993, p. 152; January 27, 1994, p. 25.\n\nVillage Voice, January 4, 1994, pp. 69-70.\n\nOnline\n\n“Janet Jackson,” All Music Guide, http://www.allmusic.com (March 28, 2002).\n\nJanet Jackson Official Website, http://www.janet-jackson.com (March 28, 2002).\n\nRecording Industry Association of America, http://www.riaa.com (March 28, 2002).\n\nAdditional information for this profile was taken from Virgin Records publicity materials, 1994.\n\n—Simon Glickman\n\nJanet Jackson\n\n1966—\n\nSinger, actor\n\nBorn into one of the most successful musical families in the history of pop music, Janet Jackson began her entertainment career as a television actress but established herself as a singing star of the first order by the end of the 1980s. Over the past two decades she has emerged as one of the biggest pop music stars of all time. At the tender age of sixteen she released her first album, and though it took a few years before she scored any large-scale hits, she soon rivaled the astonishing success of Michael, her superstar brother. She has released a number of smash singles and has also received many awards from her peers and from numerous civic organizations, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The release of her long-awaited janet. album in 1993, along with her motion picture debut in Poetic Justice, signaled her transition to grown-up pop idol: sexier, more versatile, and more independent. Articulating her artistic goals in a Rolling Stone interview, she declared, \"I'm talking about responding to the world emotionally, directly. Art that comes from the heart, not the head.\" Having sold over one hundred million albums, according to Billboard, that emotional appeal has clearly connected with much of the listening public.\n\nJanet Damita Jo Jackson was born in 1966 to Joseph and Katherine Jackson in Gary, Indiana, the youngest of nine children. When five of her brothers—known as the Jackson Five—became pop superstars in the early 1970s, the family moved to California. Janet's first stage appearance was in a Las Vegas revue when she was seven years old. Unlike her brothers, Janet first made her way into the public eye through acting: at age eleven she landed the role of Penny on the situation comedy Good Times. Parts in the series Diff'rent Strokes and Fame followed, as she grew up before the nation's eyes. It was at the urging of her father that she ventured into music. \"My dad would tell me, ‘You have to do this and this and this,’\" she told Us magazine. \"And I'd just say ‘Okay,’ and do it.\" Later on, Jackson remembered in a Rolling Stone interview that she told her father she didn't want him to manage her any longer: \"I couldn't say the words —I was bawling like a baby—and finally he just said: ‘You don't want me involved in your career. Isn't that it?’ ‘Yes,’ I finally had the nerve to say, ‘that's it.’\"\n\nMusic Moved Her\n\nJanet's debut as a recording artist came with her 1982 album Janet Jackson, released by A&M Records. Even though the album's highest-charting single failed to reach the Top Forty, she established her own following by touring high schools to promote it and to encourage students to stay in school.\n\nHowever, she threw her family a curve in the summer of 1984, when she eloped with the singer James DeBarge. The two announced their nuptials in September of that year from Michigan, though the wedding was annulled by the following spring and Jackson ended up returning to her family's home in Encino, California. \"I went through a lot, from age 15 1/2 to about 19 years,\" she disclosed to Ebony in a 1993 interview. \"I was very young. I used to hurt so badly that I'd ask God why, what have I done to deserve any of this? I feel now He was preparing me for this, for the future. That's the way I see it.\" In the wake of the marriage's annulment, Jackson was comforted by her longtime friend Rene Elizondo, with whom she later developed a romantic relationship.\n\nNovember of 1984 saw the release of Jackson's second effort, Dream Street. Despite the participation of the producers Giorgio Moroder and Jesse Johnson and a duet with the pop legend Cliff Richard, the record didn't sell that well. Not until her next album, Control, did Jackson become a contender in the pop world. Teamed with the hot Rhythm and Blues (R&B) producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who cowrote much of the material, Jackson seemed in her musical element at last. \"She had made two records with producers who basically said, ‘Here's the song, go in and sing it,’\" Jam told Steve Pond of Us. \"And when she started working with us, she expected us to do the same thing. But you have to remember that it really wasn't her idea to be a singer. It was really her father's, and she's gone from basically doing something that her father suggested to really enjoying it and feeling confident about it.\"\n\nGained Confidence with Control\n\nReleased in 1986 and promoted domestically with a thirteen-city tour, Control began to move thanks to the single \"What Have You Done for Me Lately,\" which rose to the top of the R&B chart. During the album's lengthy stay on the British pop chart, it reached the number-eight position; in the United States it fared even better, topping the album chart and achieving platinum status. Thanks to the smash singles \"Nasty,\" \"When I Think of You,\" \"Let's Wait Awhile,\" \"The Pleasure Principle,\" and the record's title track, the twenty-year-old Jackson became the youngest artist to attain the number-one position on the U.S. charts since Stevie Wonder reached it at age thirteen. Control went on to sell eight million copies.\n\nJackson performed at the 1987 Grammy Awards but didn't take home any statues. She did, however, come up the winner in several categories of Billboard's year-end survey. Also, the video for \"Nasty\"—which was choreographed by the rising star Paula Abdul—won a trophy at the MTV Video Music Awards. In November A&M released Control—The Remixes, a collection of eight alternate versions of Jackson's hits.\n\nAt a Glance …\n\nBorn Janet Damita Jo Jackson on May 16, 1966, in Gary, IN; daughter of Joseph Jackson (a music manager) and Katherine Corse Jackson (a homemaker and sales clerk); married James DeBarge (a singer), 1984 (annulled 1985); married Rene Elizondo (film director and actor), 1991 (divorced 2000).\n\nCareer: Actor, 1973—; recording and performing music artist, 1982—; signed recording contract with Virgin Records, 1991; songwriter and coproducer of numerous solo albums with Virgin Records, 1993-2006.\n\nAwards: Platinum records for Control, 1986, Rhythm Nation 1814, 1989, and janet., 1993; MTV Video Music Awards, 1987 and 1991; Grammy Award for Best Music Video, 1990; three Soul Train Awards, 1990; awarded star on Hollywood \"Walk of Fame\" during \"Janet Jackson Week,\" Los Angeles, 1990; Billboard-Tanqueray Sterling Artist of Achievement, 1990; BMI Pop Awards, Songwriter of the Year, 1990; National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Chairman's Award, 1992; Sammy Davis Jr. Award for Entertainer of the Year, 1992; American Music Awards, Award of Merit, 2001; Radio Music Awards, Legend Award, 2004; NCAA Image Award, Best Supporting Actress, 2008; Human Rights Campaign, Humanitarian Award, 2005; Gay & Lesbian Alliance against Defamation, Vanguard Award, 2008.\n\nAddresses: Office—c/o Island Records, 825 Eighth Ave., New York, NY 10019.\n\nThough she began work on it in 1988, Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 did not hit the stores until the fall of the following year. Jackson described it to Essence as an album \"containing my views about what was going on in the world and the problems we have in trying to educate the kids and give them hope.\" Working again with Jam and Lewis, Jackson proved that Control's success was no accident. The album topped the U.S. charts four weeks after its release and produced hit after hit, including \"Miss You Much,\" \"Escape,\" the hard-rocking \"Black Cat,\" \"Come Back to Me,\" and \"Love Will Never Do (without You).\" Jackson again performed at the Grammy Awards and again went home empty-handed, though the album's long-form video counterpart won a trophy. Regardless, Jackson received her share of honors, including a Los Angeles celebration of \"Janet JacksonWeek,\" a star on Hollywood's \"Walk of Fame,\" and an array of Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards, and Soul Train Awards. BMI honored her as songwriter of the year in 1990, \"Janet Jackson's year,\" according to David Ritz of Essence.\n\nUltimately, Rhythm Nation 1814—the number refers to the year in which the U.S. national anthem was composed—became the first album ever to have seven of its singles on the Billboard Top Five; four of those singles reached the number-one position. Jackson's 1990 world tour was an enormous success; she shared the wealth it generated by donating 25 cents from each ticket sold to the Cities in Schools program, which works to keep kids from dropping out of school. After the tour ended, she gave nearly a half-million dollars to the United Negro College Fund in the form of a Rhythm Nation Scholarship. In 1991 she signed a recording contract with Virgin Records that, at $50 million, stood as the most lucrative in history—for about a week, after which time it was surpassed by brother Michael's new deal with Sony.\n\nJackson received a Chairman's Award from the NAACP in 1992 in recognition of her public service work, especially on behalf of young people. \"I don't consider myself a social leader,\" the singer told Essence, \"but I do feel a responsibility that comes with being an entertainer. For me the big issues all come down to the children. What are we doing to protect them, to make their future world better? I'll never stop fighting illiteracy and drugs [and helping organizations that work to combat AIDS],\" she added.\n\nAs she addressed these large issues, however, she found increasing public attention focused on conflicts within her family. Public acrimony between her sister LaToya—also a performer—and the rest of the Jackson clan gained considerable publicity, and Janet was forced to comment, admitting the rift. She told Ritz that she tried to reestablish contact with LaToya, but \"communication between us has proved impossible.\"\n\nMeanwhile, she and Michael appeared together on the 1993 Grammy Awards, where he jokingly stated that their dual appearance put to rest rumors that they were the same person. Entertainment Weekly's David Browne quipped, \"Only Michael would take such a story seriously—after all anyone can see it is he and LaToya who look frighteningly alike.\" Janet admitted to competitive feelings with her brother in her Ebony interview, noting that she wants \"to break his records,\" yet she insisted that this was not mere familial jealousy. \"I'm very competitive. If someone is at No. 1 and I'm at No. 2, then I want the No. 1 spot. But I feel there is enough room for everyone. Everyone. I really do. Enough room for Whitney [Houston, megastar soul-pop diva], for myself, for my brother, for everyone.\"\n\nPoetic Justice and janet.: Two New Personae\n\nThe year 1993 marked not only the release of another massively successful Jackson album but also her first acting role in a feature film. Jackson was cast by the director-writer John Singleton, who became a Hollywood sensation with his debut film Boyz N the Hood, to play the lead role in his follow-up effort, Poetic Justice. \"It was something about Janet that really made me feel this character was her,\" he told Allison Samuels of Upscale magazine. \"It's something about her eyes that are very telling.\" Though she grew up in the suburbs, Singleton remarked to Essence that he had \"always viewed Janet as the Ultimate Homegirl. She has a secret fire. I call it subdued intensity.\" Jackson was advised against accepting the role by some industry figures who wanted her to stay closer to her pop-singer persona. \"The studio head adamantly warned me against it,\" she said. \"‘It's a mistake for your first feature film to be all Black.’ He said it was too ethnic, too artsy, too heavy. ‘Make a comedy. Take it easy. Play a character closer to you. Play it safe.’\" Instead, Jackson took the role of Singleton's hairdresser-poet and prepared by—as Singleton recalled it—\"doing hair in a salon on 54th Street in South Central Los Angeles.\"\n\nJackson made new friends during the project. She told Ritz, \"I met four girls from South Central through John—one of them was a hairdresser—who wound up living with me for eight weeks. We shopped, played, danced, went to Disneyland. We did everything together, we talked long into the night about our lives, opening our hearts to each other. The learning process never stopped.\" Nonetheless, she and the film received a less-than-friendly response from critics. The Time reviewer Richard Schickel called it \"simply awful\" and described Jackson's acting as a nonperformance, insisting that she \"relates to the camera lens as if it were a mirror.\" Entertainment Weekly found the movie a \"dawdling mishmash\" and had no more praise for Jackson's work than did Schickel: \"Jackson isn't an inept actress, yet there are no more edges to her personality than there are to her plastic Kewpie-doll visage.\"\n\nWhile other artists might have withered at such critical scorn, Jackson seemed to sail past the debacle of the movie's critical reception and into the glow of her new album's success. The heavily promoted janet. presented the singer's new, sexier image as lusty and independent. The hit singles \"That's the Way Love Goes\" and \"If\" sported steamy videos. Jackson ex- plained to Us that her mother wanted to attend the filming of the latter. \"I said, ‘Some of my movements are very sexy. They're not dirty, they're very sexy. And just by you being my mother, I'd be embarrassed.’ She responded, ‘Well, if I make you shy in any way or pull back, then I shouldn't be there.’ I said, ‘No, you can come down if you like.’\" Yet, perhaps unsurprisingly, \"She wound up not coming.\"\n\n\"As princess of America's black royal family,\" reasoned the Rolling Stone reviewer Touré, \"everything Janet Jackson does is important.\" Thus, \"when she announces her sexual maturity, as she does on her new album, janet., it's a cultural moment.\" Touré noted that Jackson's new duties as coproducer somewhat toned down the pyrotechnics of Jam and Lewis, \"resulting in a less groundbreaking sound but a wider-ranging album,\" and dubbed it a \"victory.\" The Upscale reviewer David Taylor pointed to janet.'s combination \"of a variety of musical genres—funk, hip-hop, jazz, rock and rap,\" as well as diverse guest vocals from the opera star Kathleen Battle and Chuck D of Public Enemy, deeming the 1993 release \"without a doubt, an outstanding album.\" Meanwhile, Entertainment Weekly found it overproduced, fraught with \"Hallmark [greeting card] lyrics, and uncertain about its own sexual boldness.\" Nonetheless, the album soon proved that reviews were immaterial to Jackson's success as a musical artist. And despite her struggles, as Singleton commented in the Us interview, \"The way I look at it, she just has a really good job.\"\n\nWith not only a good job but also an incredibly famous family, Jackson was able to team up with one of the most noted entertainers of the twentieth century, her brother, Michael Jackson. The pair teamed up in 1995 to record the single \"Scream.\" The song was a send up to the many media outlets that had been tormenting Michael in the early 1990s. The video created for the song proved to be one of the most expensive in history and arguably one of the most excitingly choreographed videos ever.\n\nHer Design of a Decade: 1986-1996 release in 1995 celebrated ten years at the top of the charts for Jackson. The compilation included hits from Control through janet. and two new songs, \"Twenty Foreplay\" and \"Runaway,\" and was also available in video form. But her next feature album, The Velvet Rope, took the newfound sexuality from janet. to the next level. In a 1997 interview with Jet, Janet said, \"The Velvet Rope will mean different things to different people. To me, it became the concept that allowed me to put into words and music so much of what I've been going through. The Velvet Rope is my most personal album.\"\n\nThe album included topics on everything from racism to AIDS, same-sex love, and soft-shelled bondage. But the most revealing portions of the recording would not be decipherable until the announcement in 1999 of a marriage between Jackson and long-time companion, Rene Elizondo. With the announcement that he was filing for divorce from the singer, Elizondo revealed that the pair had been married since 1991. He went on to file suit against Jackson for $10 million, citing uncompensated work on albums dating back to Rhythm Nation 1814. Jackson had begun publicly recognizing Elizondo's contributions to her career during the promotion of The Velvet Rope.\n\nJackson was able to keep the turmoil in her relationship out of the press even after the release of such a revealing piece and continued to expand her entertainment career with a successful tour surrounding The Velvet Rope. Her next project had her once again wetting her acting chops in a comedy, starring opposite the comedian Eddie Murphy in Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000). Her next release, All for You, appeared to be the opposite of The Velvet Rope by trading in the sad solitude for an upbeat and happy song, but it still oozed sexuality. The first single, \"All for You,\" was the tenth number-one single for the singer, so she still had much to celebrate. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Jackson stated, \"This album could have ended up exactly like The Velvet Rope because of what's gone on in my life since then, like the divorce. But I believe we have choices and paths, and it's about choosing the right path, the promising path.\"\n\nIn 2001 Jackson received the Award of Merit at the twenty-eighth annual American Music Awards. She was also the first artist honored by MTV Icon, a series of programs dedicated to artists they consider to be music video icons. She also launched an All for You World Tour during the summer of 2001. With nearly thirty years in entertainment, Jackson managed to remain an innovator and trend setter in the entertainment business. In 2004 she received the Legend Award at the Radio Music Awards.\n\nAlso in 2004 Jackson released her Damita Jo album. But controversy dogged her that year, after an incident during the halftime show of Super Bowl XXXVIII in Houston. The singer Justin Timberlake ripped off part of her costume, exposing her right breast in what publicists termed a \"wardrobe malfunction.\" The furor triggered an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission and led to the CBS television network rescinding its invitation for Jackson to appear at the Grammy Awards ceremony, because she would not apologize.\n\nJackson's Super Bowl apparel mishap seemed to cause more than a minor career hiccup. Her videos were blacklisted for a time by MTV, and some radio stations refused to play her songs. Neither Damita Jo nor her next album, 20 Y.O., managed to hit the one million mark in U.S. sales.\n\nAs she worked toward a comeback, Jackson, who was approaching age forty, chose to remake her physical image as well as her public image. She began working out vigorously and sticking to a healthy diet, eventually losing as much as sixty pounds in 2006. In 2007, after a seven-year absence from the big screen, Jackson returned to her acting roots with a starring role in Tyler Perry's film Why Did I Get Married? The movie received enthusiastic praise from critics, and Jackson received an NAACP Image Award for her work in the picture.\n\nMeanwhile, Jackson's romantic partner—and the producer of her recent albums—Jermaine Dupri became frustrated over Virgin's lack of support of Jackson's records and left his position as president of Virgin's urban music division for a similar job at Island Records. Jackson made the move with him. Her first record on her new label, Discipline, released in early 2008, climbed to the top of the Billboard charts, marking Jackson's first appearance at number one since 2001. It seemed that the rehabilitation of Jackson's image—and selling power—was complete.\n\nSelected discography\n\nJanet Jackson, A&M, 1982.\n\nDream Street, A&M, 1984.\n\nControl, A&M, 1986.\n\nRhythm Nation 1814, A&M, 1989.\n\njanet., Virgin, 1993.\n\nThe Velvet Rope, Virgin, 1997.\n\nAll for You, Virgin, 2001.\n\nDamita Jo, Virgin, 2004.\n\n20 Y.O., Virgin, 2006.\n\nDiscipline, Island, 2008.\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nRees, Dafydd, and Luke Crampton, Rock Movers & Shakers, ABC-CLIO, 1991.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nBillboard, September 9, 2006.\n\nChicago Tribune, April 23, 2001.\n\nEbony, September 1986; September 1993; March 1999; October 2006, p. 180; April 2008, p. 72.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, May 21, 1993; July 23, 1993; May 4, 2001.\n\nEssence, May 1993, pp. 84-86, 140-142.\n\nJet, November 17, 1997; June 19, 2000; January 29, 2001; April 20, 2001.\n\nNewsweek, July 21, 1986; May 24, 1993, p. 51.\n\nRolling Stone, April 24, 1986; October 19, 1989; June 24, 1993, p. 78; September 16, 1993, pp. 38-43, 82.\n\nTime, April 26, 1993, p. 73; July 26, 1993, pp. 67-68.\n\nUpscale, June 1993, pp. 27-31; September-October 1993, p. 108.\n\nUs, August 1993, pp. 66-74, 92.\n\nUSA Today, February 2, 2004; October 27, 2004; February 26, 2008, p. 1D.\n\nOnline\n\nIbanga, Imaeyen, \"Will Jackson's ‘Discipline’ Be Her Breakthrough?\" ABC News, http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/WinterConcert/story?id_4306913&page_1 (accessed May 28, 2008).\n\n\"Janet Jackson,\" All Music Guide, http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p_amg&sql_11:fifuxqe5ldae˜T0 (accessed May 28, 2008).\n\nOther\n\nAdditional information for this profile was provided by Virgin Records and Levine/Schneider Public Relations press materials, 1993.\n\n—Simon Glickman, Leslie Rochelle, and Bob Jacobson\n\nJanet Jackson\n\nSinger, songwriter\n\nDuring her impressive run as one of pop music's ruling divas, Janet Jackson cemented her place in music history while outlasting older brother Michael Jackson as a musical act of consequence. Jackson has remained a major figure who writes, records, tours actively, and wins awards for her work. Also an actress, Jackson appeared in the films Poetic Justice in 1993, Nutty Professor II in 2000 and Why Did I Get Married in 2007.\n\nA Child TV Star\n\nHaving grown up in America's most celebrated musical family—and in the shadow of her eccentric megastar brother, Michael—Jackson has nonetheless demonstrated a willingness to veer at least briefly from the assured path of mainstream pop. \"My concepts are never bright ideas; they're never notions I think will sell or be trendy or attract new fans,\" she told Rolling Stone's David Ritz. \"I don't think that way. All I can do is sing from my life.\" In addition to establishing herself as a fixture in the firmament of pop music, Jackson has also pursued an acting career, though with decidedly mixed results.\n\nJackson was born in 1966 to Joseph and Katherine Jackson in Gary, Indiana, the youngest of nine children. Five of her brothers became known as the Jackson 5 and, led by the charismatic Michael, they achieved pop stardom in the early 1970s. The family moved to Encino, California, an affluent section of the San Fernando Valley. In the interview with Ritz, Jackson recalled her upbringing in the Jackson home there, \"with peacocks and llamas and giraffes in the back yard.\" When asked if she was lonely, she replied, \"At times, yes,\" but added, \"On certain days, I felt like the luckiest kid in the world.\" She called \"Hot Fun in the Summertime\" by soul-rock sensations Sly and the Family Stone \"one of the biggest musical influences of my life,\" adding, \"I was only 3 years old when that song had me jumping up and down.\"\n\nJackson's debut stage appearance was in a Jackson 5 revue at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas when she was seven. Unlike her brothers, however, she made her way into the public eye through acting. At eleven, after capturing the attention of influential television producer Norman Lear, she landed the role of the abused child Penny on the situation comedy Good Times. Parts on the series Diff'rent Strokes and Fame followed, as Jackson grew up before the nation's eyes. It was at the urging of her father that she ventured into music.\n\nDebut Album\n\nHer solo recording debut, Janet Jackson, was released by A&M Records in 1982. Although the album's highest-charting single failed to reach the top 40, the young singer established her own tradition by touring high schools to promote it. She shocked the Jackson clan in the summer of 1984, however, when she eloped with singer James DeBarge. The couple contacted the family from Michigan to announce they had married, though the wedding was annulled the following spring and Jackson ended up returning to her family's home in Encino. After the annulment, she was comforted by longtime friend Rene Elizondo, with whom she would later develop a romantic relationship.\n\nNovember of 1984 saw the release of Jackson's sophomore effort, Dream Street. Despite the participation of producers Giorgio Moroder and Jesse Johnson and a duet with pop legend Cliff Richard, the record went nowhere.\n\nWith her 1986 album Control, Jackson at last gave an indication of her potential. The project teamed her with hot R&B producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who co-wrote much of the material. Sales of the album surged after the release of the single \"What Have You Done for Me Lately,\" which moved to the top of the R&B chart. It eventually reached the peak spot on the album chart and achieved platinum status five times over. The 20-year-old Jackson became the youngest artist to reach the number one position on the American charts since Stevie Wonder had reached it at age 13. Jackson performed at the 1987 Grammy Awards but didn't take home any trophies. She did, however, win an armload of American Music Awards and came up the favorite in several categories of Billboard magazine's 1986 year-end survey. A&M soon released Control—The Remixes, a collection of eight alternate versions of Jackson's hits.\n\nGreater Success with Rhythm Nation\n\nJanet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814, released in 1989, demonstrated even greater pop ambition. \"Control was an album about what I went through in my life when I was 19 and the self-discovery that resulted,\" reads a quote in Jackson's Virgin Records biography. \"Rhythm Nation contained my views about what was going on in the world and the problems we have in trying to educate the kids—the idea was to give them hope.\" Working again with Jam and Lewis, Jackson proved that Control's success was no accident. Rhythm Nation topped the American charts four weeks after its release, and produced a string of hits. The album's long-form video won a Grammy, and Jackson received her fair share of tributes. These included a Los Angeles \"Janet Jackson Week,\" a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, a meeting with then-President George H.W. Bush, and an array of Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards, and Soul Train Awards. BMI honored her as Songwriter of the Year in 1990.\n\nFor the Record …\n\nBorn on May 16, 1966, in Gary, IN; daughter of Joseph (a music manager) and Katherine (a home-maker and sales clerk) Jackson; married James DeBarge (a musician), September 1984; marriage annulled, 1985; married Rene Elizondo, 1991; divorced, 2000.\n\nActress on television series Good Times, Diff'rent Strokes, and Fame, beginning c. 1977; recording and performing artist, 1982-; released four albums on the A&M label, 1980s; signed with Virgin Records, 1991; released janet, 1993; resigned with Virgin in a four-album, $80 million deal, 1996; released The Velvet Rope, 1997; released All for You, 2001; has appeared in films;released 20 Y.O., 2006; signed with Island Records and released Discipline, 2008.\n\nAwards: Voted Top R&B Artist, Top Pop Singles Artist Female, Top Dance Sales Artist, Top Dance Club Play Artist, and Top R&B Singles Artist by Billboard, magazine, all 1986; seven American Music Awards, 1987, 1990, and 1991; three Soul Train Awards, 1990; Sammy Davis Jr. Award, Entertainer of the Year, 1992; Grammy Award, Best Rhythm & Blues Song, for \"That's the Way Love Goes,\" 1993; won Grammys for music videos, 1989, 1995, 1997; Billboard Artist Achievement Award, 2001; ASCAP Award, Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures for Poetic Justice, 1995; BMI Film & TV Awards, Most Performed Song from a Film, for Nutty Professor II, for the song \"Doesn't Really Matter,\" 2001; American Music Award, Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist, 2002; Grammy Award, Best Dance Recording, for \"All for You,\" 2002; Legend Award, Radio Music Awards, 2004; Humanitarian Award, the Human Rights Campaign, 2005; GLAAD Media Awards, Vanguard Award, 2008; NAACP Image Award, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture, for Why Did I Get Married?, 2008.\n\nAddresses: Record company—Island Records, 825 8th Ave., 24th Fl., New York, NY 10019, Web site: http://www.islandrecords.com.

Jackson's 1990 World Tour was an enormous success, and some of its profits helped the Cities in Schools program, which encourages students to stay in school. After the tour ended, she gave the United Negro College Fund a \"Rhythm Nation Scholarship\" to the tune of a half-million dollars.\n\nNew Contract, Family Woes\n\nIn 1991 Janet Jackson signed a huge recording contract with Virgin Records. The deal, at $50 million, stood as the most lucrative in history—for about a week, after which time it was surpassed by her brother Michael's new deal with Sony. Janet Jackson has admitted to a friendly rivalry with her brother, but her adoration of him is obvious in every interview she gives. It was he, she noted, who gave her the most important early encouragement when she began singing: \"Michael told me to ‘just practice, always have confidence in yourself, and never give up,’\" she recalled in Jet.\n\nIn 1992 the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) gave Jackson its Chairman's Award for her public service work, especially on behalf of young people. As she addressed these larger issues, however, she found increasing public attention focused on conflicts within her family. Public acrimony between her sister LaToya, also a performer, and the rest of the Jackson clan gained considerable publicity, and Janet was forced to comment, admitting the rift; she later remarked that she found it impossible to communicate with her sister.\n\nMeanwhile, she and Michael appeared together on the 1993 Grammy Awards, where he jokingly stated that their dual appearance put to rest rumors that they were the same person. Michael's own public troubles—especially public accusations that he had molested a young fan—placed even greater stress on the Jackson clan. During Janet's 1994 concert tour, Robert Christgau of the Village Voice reported that she asked the crowd to \"bow our heads and say a silent prayer for my brother Michael.\"\n\nDirector John Singleton wrote the central role of his 1993 film Poetic Justice specifically for Jackson, but her much-hyped return to acting was something of a disappointment. The film fared poorly at the box office, and reviewers were less than kind to its star. \"Jackson isn't an inept actress,\" said Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, \"yet there are no more edges to her personality than there are to her plastic Kewpie-doll visage.\" Yet this relatively unsuccessful detour hardly dented Jackson's meteoric career, and she appeared in Nutty Professor II with Eddie Murphy in 2000.\n\n\"Deeply Sexual\" Persona\n\nJackson's 1993 album janet. announced her arrival as an adult pop figure, openly celebrating her sexuality. \"I love feeling deeply sexual—and don't mind letting the world know,\" she told Ritz. \"For me, sex has become a celebration, a joyful part of the creative process.\" She added that what \"excites me isn't becoming a bigger star but a better artist, deeper, truer to the things I find exciting.\" The album's guest appearances by opera singer Kathleen Battle and rapper Chuck D. of the celebrated rap group Public Enemy attested to her expanded musical palette. The album earned five-times platinum sales in December of 1993.\n\nSome critics considered Jackson at the top of her form with janet. Rolling Stone's year-end roundup of major releases found her in \"more versatile voice than ever,\" adding that she \"perches atop the rhythmic percolations—cool, not exactly calm, but collected.\" Yet while many applauded Jackson's newly bold persona, reviewers like Entertainment Weekly's David Browne felt she sounded \"tentative\" and found the album to be \"a mess—period.\" Even so, it was enormously successful, as was her 1994 tour. Jackson also appeared on her brother Michael's 1995 single \"Scream\" and in its innovative video, which was nominated for several awards. A&M Records released a greatest hits collection, Design of a Decade: 1986-1996, in 1995, which earned multiplatinum sales in December of that year.\n\nLucrative Contract Renewal Deal\n\nJackson renewed her contract with Virgin Records in 1996 in a four-album, $80 million deal. The first album to follow was the multiplatinum-selling The Velvet Rope, released in 1997. According to Pamela Johnson of Essence magazine, on the album \"[Jackson] speaks with her trademark candor to a range of topics: the unhealed wound that can be manifest in depression, an abused woman confronting her cruel lover, assorted childhood emotional traumas.…Grouped together, the subject matter sounds raw, grim. But as ususal, Jackson turns it into a funky good time.\"\n\nInstead of her music, Jackson's personal life was the focus of attention in May of 2000. Rene Elizondo filed for divorce from Jackson, revealing that the couple had been secretly married since May of 1991. Though initially reported to be an amicable split, Elizondo sued Jackson for $10 million in January of 2001 over the validity of a prenuptial agreement.\n\nAmid the personal turmoil surrounding the divorce, Jackson released All for You in 2001. The album reached multiplatinum sales in May of 2001, and the title track earned the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording in 2002.\n\nIn 2004 Jackson released Damita Jo, but she was also embroiled in more controversy that year. During her halftime performance at Super Bowl XXXVIII in Houston, Texas, singer Justin Timberlake yanked off part of Jackson's outfit, exposing her breast. The duo intended to only expose Jackson's red bra. The furor over what publicists called a \"wardrobe malfunction\" prompted an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the television airwaves in the United States. Because Jackson initially did not apologize, she was asked not to appear at the Grammy Awards ceremony later that year. Further, Jackson was denied the lead role in a movie about legendary singer Lena Horne because of the incident. To date, Justin Timberlake has suffered no consequences for his part in the much-hyped media event.\n\nMoved to Island Records\n\nAfter a cooling off period with the media, the 40-year-old Jackson returned with the flirty and infectious album 20 Y.O. in 2006. Filled with self-referential allusions and smartly crafted songs, it prompted Andy Kellman of the All Music Guide to comment, \"Janet's gang of assistants is on top of its game, and Janet herself has remembered that she doesn't have to be willfully explicit or eclectic to make a sexy and wholly enjoyable album.\" Despite positive reviews, 20 Y.O. fell off the charts after 15 weeks. Claiming the label did not adequately supp"
