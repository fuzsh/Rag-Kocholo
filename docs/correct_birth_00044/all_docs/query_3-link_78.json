        "text": "Since first appearing on stage at the age of seven (as reported by Bio.com) international superstar Janet Jackson has shown no signs of slowing down. During her recent performance in Hershey, the singer took a moment to acknowledge those who have helped push her career forward.\n\nWhile the singer was undergoing a wardrobe change, green strobe lights began to shine across the Hersheypark Stadium, and the singer’s voice could be heard through the speakers.\n\n“I’ve been so fortunate and blessed to have a career that I continue to enjoy. I was just a small child the very first time I stood on stage before an audience,” Jackson said. “I still feel just as excited today as I did all those years ago. All of you here tonight have been a huge part of my journey.”\n\nThe lighting changed, and shortly after, Jackson and her dancers hit the stage. Jackson noted that her next song was one of her first number-one hits while letting the crowd know that time had only made her a better performer.\n\n“I was just a baby back then. I’m 50 now, and I’m still serving,” Jackson said.\n\nWith that out the way, the band began to play “What Have You Done For Me Lately.”"
