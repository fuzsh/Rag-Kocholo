Among other apperances, she was a guest artist with Busta Rhymes on his 1999 hit “What’s It Gonna Be.”\n\nJackson also ventured into the movies, starring with Tupac Shakur and Maya Angelou in the 1993 film Poetic Justice. Her other albums include Damita Jo (2004, with a title taken from Jackson’s middle name), 20 Y.O. (2006), Discipline (2008) and Unbreakable (2015).\n\nJanet Jackson was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. In its announcement, the Hall said she “explored social issues, themes of empowerment and self-confidence, and influenced generations with her stylized music videos with innovative choreography.”"
