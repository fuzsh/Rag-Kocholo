        "text": "Janet Jackson has given birth to her first child, People reports.\n\nJackson, 50, and her husband Wissam Al Mana, 42, announced on Tuesday they had welcomed their son Eissa Al Mana.\n\n“Janet Jackson and husband Wissam Al Mana are thrilled to welcome their new son Eissa Al Mana into the world,” Jackson’s rep said in a statement to People. “Janet had a stress-free healthy delivery and is resting comfortably.”\n\nIn April the pop star announced she was postponing her Unbreakable world tour, including Baltimore and D.C. dates, to start a family.\n\n“I thought it was important that you be the first to know,” Jackson said in a video posted on Twitter. “My husband and I are planning our family, so I’m going to have to delay the tour.”\n\nJackson and Al Mana wed in 2012.\n\nIt’s a boy for Brittney and Cherelle Griner. The Phoenix Mercury center revealed the news in interviews with CBS Sports and NBC News.\n\n“Every minute I feel like he’s popping into my head, said Griner. “Literally everything revolves around him. And I love it.”\n\nThe couple officially welcomed the baby boy on July 8. He weighs 7 pounds, 8 ounces.\n\n“That’s my man. He is amazing,” Griner told CBS Sports. “They said as soon as you see them, everything that you thought mattered just goes out the window. That’s literally what happened.”\n\nGriner, 33, corrected the CBS News correspondent who said, “You’re about to be a mom!” She told her Cherelle, 33, had already delivered the baby and that she preferred to be called,“Pops.”\n\nGriner told NBC News correspondent Liz Kreutz they chose to name their newborn son, “Bash.”\n\nThe WNBA star said she is Bash’s biggest fan and is constantly taking photos of him. “My whole phone has turned into him now,” Griner told CBS Sports.\n\nThe baby comes as Griner gets set to play in Saturday’s WNBA All-Star Game and then head to Paris with Team USA to compete for their 8th straight gold medal at the Summer Olympic Games.\n\n“It kind of sucks because I have to leave, but at the same time, he will understand,” said Griner.\n\nHer time in Paris will mark the first time since the basketball star was released from a Russian gulag, where she was held on drug charges for nearly 10 months in 2022.\n\n“BG is locked in and ready to go,” Griner told NBC News on Friday. “I’m happy, I’m in a great place. I’m representing my country, the country that fought for me to come back. I’m gonna represent it well.”\n\nGriner also spoke with NBC News about her hopes the U.S. can win the freedom of imprisoned Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was sentenced to 16 years in a Russian maximum security prison on Friday.\n\n“We have to get him back,” she said.\n\nFriday, July 19\n\n“Center Aging Friday Tea Time” will be at 2 p.m. on Zoom.

And then May brought the unexpected death of his beloved Vizsla hound Mabel, named for the heroine in Gilbert and Sullivan’s “Pirates of Penzance.”\n\nSo, for much of 2024, Smith had been spending time healing at his farmhouse in Ellicott City, Md. Until now. Currently, he’s back on the boards at Olney Theatre Center playing record producer Don Kirshner in “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical,” a fun juke box musical about the early career years of singer/songwriter King from her Brooklyn roots to writing hits from an office in Times Square with her lyricist husband Gerry Goffin and on to Los Angeles solo-stardom.\n\nWASHINGTON BLADE: Hey Bobby, you’ve been through a lot since we last spoke.\n\nBOBBY SMITH: It’s been a whole lot. I spent the last seven or eight months either at home or going to doctor visits.\n\nBLADE: How is it being back on stage?\n\nSMITH: To be honest, it’s like learning to walk again.\n\nBLADE: And playing the famously deadpan Don Kirshner?\n\nSMITH: It’s good. I don’t do an imitation. Instead, I’ve created a character who’s not over the top; otherwise, it would become the Don Kirshner show and we don’t want that.\n\nBut because there’s not a lot of drama with Carole King, she’s a really kind, nice person, Don serves as a sort of catalyst. He pushes the story forward. He prods Carole to write more songs, to try different things. He doesn’t like her boyfriend. Don the character doesn’t sing much but he’s always barking at people.\n\nBLADE: Sometimes you forget just how many familiar songs King wrote: “Take Good Care of My Baby,” “Up On the Roof,” and “Will You (Still) Love Me Tomorrow” for acts like the Shirelles and The Drifters. And later songs like “It’s Too Late,” “You’ve Got a Friend,” “(You Make Me Feel) Like a Natural Woman,” and of course “Beautiful.”\n\nSMITH: Yeah, it feels like she wrote every song known to mankind; the show tells you that, and we sing most of them.\n\nBLADE: You experienced a highpoint during the rough times. In May, you won a Helen Hayes Award for playing Bruce, the complicated, manic depressive, closeted father in Studio’s production of Alison Bechdel’s “Fun Home.”\n\nSMITH: I did, but unfortunately, I couldn’t make it to the ceremony.\n\nBruce is a sympathetic but difficult character. Ever since being born, people of a certain age, have had to fight our way into the struggle of being gay. It’s not so much a struggle anymore, or I should say not as much as it used to be, but now there are a whole lot more signposts that didn’t exist when I was growing up.\n\nOver the years, people have randomly attacked me for not talking more about my sexuality. I’m not closeted but I don’t feel I have to tell everyone. I don’t share it with my land lady. I don’t need to say “I’m here and I’m queer. Here’s your rent.”\n\nBLADE: You have been in show biz for decades now. What keeps you going?\n\nSMITH: I’m not sure, sometimes I ask myself what was I thinking when I decided to be a professional actor? I feel like I’m making a bigger contribution teaching at Catholic University than I did my entire acting career.\n\nNow that I’ve taken over the tap department, I’m full time at Catholic. I’m also teaching Acting the Text, Directing for Musical Theatre, and in the fall, I’ll add Musical Interpretation.\n\nBLADE: In this summer of so many theatrical choices, why see “Beautiful”?\n\nSMITH: Well, if you don’t already know Natalie Weiss who plays Carole, you should. She’s an amazing compelling, vocalist with one of the healthiest singing voices you’ll ever hear, no straining, perfect placement.\n\nAlso, there’s nothing about “Beautiful” that’s going to make you feel bad, or put you in a place where you might think you need to talk to your therapist. That’s not going to happen. And it’s because Carole King is a positive human being; from an actor’s perspective, you feel great by the end of the show, and the audience gets that. The happiness is infectious."
