        "text": "Earlier this week, James DeBarge’s mother Etterlene DeBarge claimed that she had DNA proof that Janet Jackson gave birth to child during her year-long marriage to James back in the 1980s.\n\nEldest sister Bunny DeBarge attempted to squash the rumors for good. Janet recently welcomed her first child with husband Wissam Al Mana.\n\n“I would like to convey mainly to Janet and her family that we the DeBarge family and especially James had no knowledge of this interview being done. We are totally embarrassed and would never do anything to hurt her,” Bunny said via Facebook, according to The Jasmine Brand. “James is hurt about this as well and has asked me to speak on his behalf to Janet and Momma Kate and the whole Jackson family. We wish her and the new baby many blessing and much love. The interview by no means represents my family. I believe that this story has been so abused for years. It’s old and it tired and it’s nobody else business to explore.”\n\nBunny goes on to claim that there was a pregnancy that was terminated, but no baby was born out of the couple’s brief nuptials.\n\n“I say leave Janet and James alone. This has haunted my brother for years. Now they want DNA for Tiffany, which no DNA is needed for. It is plain to see she put herself out there to really be eaten up. But I guess people will do anything for that 15 minutes of fame. Sorry Tiffany, God bless you and we hope you find your family. Again to my ex-sister-in-law Janet, congrats. To the public, it looks like you’ll eat up everything but the truth.”*"
