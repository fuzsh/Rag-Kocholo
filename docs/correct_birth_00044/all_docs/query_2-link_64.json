        "text": "A member of R&B royalty with a silvery voice and a fierce spirit, Janet Jackson helped define pop in the late 20th century with hard-hitting beats, sumptuous love songs, and a commitment to helping the world find, as she sang in her 1989 smash âRhythm Nation,â âa better way of life.â Born in Gary, IN, in 1966, Janet broke from her pop-star brothers and initially found fame on television, playing Penny on the groundbreaking sitcom Good Times in the late â70s. She released her self-titled debut album in 1982 but truly came into her own with her third full-length, 1986âs Control, a fiery proclamation of the self that took nasty boys to task and propelled the then-nascent genre of new jack swing into popâs mainstream. In the ensuing years, Jackson continued to push boundaries musically and lyrically: 1989âs Rhythm Nation 1814 added political savvy and squealing guitars to the mix; 1993âs Janet. was a declaration of sexual independence that coincided with her star turn in the John Singleton film Poetic Justice; and 1997âs The Velvet Rope put her innermost thoughtsâgood and badâfront and center. All these albums were packed with singles that defined the decade, like the brightly hued love song âLove Will Never Do (Without You),â the spirited âIf,â and the chilled-out Joni Mitchell flip âGot âTil Itâs Gone.â Jackson kept innovating as younger R&B artists clearly inspired by her made their own inroads into pop. She worked with of-the-moment collaborators like The-Dream and Kanye West in the 2000s, and her 2015 triumph Unbreakable looked back on her three-plus decades in the music business with love, grace, and music that recalled her platinum past while gazing ahead to pop's future."
