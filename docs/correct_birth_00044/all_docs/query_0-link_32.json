        "text": "originally posted on rollingout.com\n\nJanet Jackson was in town recently for her ‘State Of The World tour’. The tour has been selling out across the country and the reviews have been stellar. The recent Chicago stop brought her closer to her hometown of Gary Indiana. As a result, she decided to make a visit to Gary, a place she had not been since she was eight years old.\n\nHer first stop was the famous 2300 Jackson St. An extremely humble home that produced two of the biggest superstars the world has ever known. Then Janet and Randy Jackson made their way to the high-school her brothers attended, The Theodore Roosevelt College and Career Academy. Legend has it that the auditorium at the school is the first place the Jackson Five ever performed.\n\nThe students were beyond excited to see Janet and asked her a few questions during her visit. When asked what she thought her biggest accomplishment was Janet said having her son at 51 was her biggest accomplishment. She was told by many doctors that it couldn’t happen. She was also asked who her favorite artists were now and she mentioned Bruno Mars, Chance the Rapper and Kendrick Lamar.\n\n“For the students, it was definitely an opportunity of a lifetime. They attend school every day passing the Jackson family home and to see Janet and Randy Jackson in front of their very eyes, showing a genuine interest in them, wanting to hear from them. It reminds them that anything is possible,” said the school’s principal Donna Henry. “Millions of people love Janet Jackson, the Jackson family, but I think the outpouring of love from these young people, from her hometown, was emotional and fulfilling [for Janet].”\n\nListen/Buy “Speak Life” by Precise"
