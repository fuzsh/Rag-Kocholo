        "text": "John Mulaney, 39, announced during an interview with Seth Meyers that he and Olivia Munn, 41, are expecting a baby.\n\nMunn and Mulaney were first spotted together earlier in the year, after the comedian got out of rehab in February.\n\nWhile Munn hasn’t publicly said anything regarding the pregnancy, Mulaney revealed the news on Late Night with Seth Meyers.\n\n“I got into this relationship that’s been really beautiful with someone incredible who has dealt with the non-coked up Bambi version of me,” he said. “And that’s been very incredible, and she’s kind of held my hand through that hell, and we’re having a baby together.”\n\nThis is the first child for both Mulaney and Munn.\n\nNaomi Campbell, 50\n\nCampbell, one of the most iconic supermodels of all time, revealed on Instagram that she has a brand new baby.\n\n“A beautiful little blessing has chosen me to be her mother. So honoured to have this gentle soul in my life. There are no words to describe the lifelong bond that I now share with you my angel. There is no greater love,” the now-51-year-old wrote.\n\nKristen Wiig, 48\n\nWhen Kristen Wiig, 48, hosted SNL in December 2020, she confirmed she had become a mum that year.\n\nIt was first reported that Wiig had become a mum in June when she hosted the SNL At Home episode for Mother’s Day, in which she thanked her mum for “preparing me to be a mum myself”. People reported that Wiig and her fiancé, Avi Rothman, had welcomed twins via surrogate in January.\n\nWhen she returned to host the Christmas show, she confirmed the news during her monologue, saying that while it was an “icky” year, it hadn’t been all bad, because she had twins.\n\nJanet Jackson, 50\n\nJanet Jackson was 50 years old when she announced she was pregnant with her first son, who was born in January 2017.\n\nJackson announced she was pregnant in October 2016. The singer had previously halted her tour in April that year so she and her then-husband, Wissam Al Mana, could focus on “planning our family”.\n\nShe gave birth to her son, Eissa Al Mana, in January 2017.\n\n“For someone like me, raised in show business where self-concern is always a priority, how fortunate I am now to be concerned, first and foremost, with the welfare of someone else. Day after day and night after night, holding my baby in my arms, I am at peace. I am blessed. I feel bliss. In those moments, all is right with the world,” she told Billboard.\n\nEva Longoria, 42\n\nEva Longoria was 42 when she revealed she was pregnant with her son, in December 2017. Six months later, the Desperate Housewives star gave birth to her son, Santiago. This is Longoria’s first child, though her husband, Jose Baston, has three other children from his previous marriage.\n\n“Santi was meant to be with me at this stage in my life. I’m patient, I don’t work as much – even if it doesn’t seem that way! It’s the right time,” Longoria told Parents Latina in 2019.\n\nCameron Diaz, 47\n\nCameron Diaz was 47 when she announced on Instagram in January 2020 that she and Benji Madden had welcomed their first child, Raddix.\n\nDiaz – who retired from acting in 2014 – revealed she and her husband, Good Charlotte frontman Benji Madden, had welcomed a daughter. Baby Raddix was reportedly born in December 2019.\n\n“Happy New Year from the Maddens! We are so happy, blessed and grateful to begin this new decade by announcing the birth of our daughter, Raddix Madden. She has instantly captured our hearts and completed our family,” Diaz wrote. “While we are overjoyed to share this news, we also feel a strong instinct to protect our little one’s privacy. So we won’t be posting pictures or sharing any more details,” she continued.\n\nSandra Bullock, 45\n\nSandra Bullock adopted her son, Louis, when she was 45 years old. She has since adopted another child, Laila.\n\nBullock’s personal life has been frequently scrutinised, including her decision to adopt Louis in 2010 – while she was in the midst of her very public divorce from Jesse James.\n\n“We spent so much time in New Orleans after Katrina and one day it was just a feeling that came that instead of bringing another life into this world, that we wanted to reach out and find our child in New Orleans,” Bullock told People in 2010.\n\nIn 2015, Bullock announced she had adopted another child, her daughter Laila, also from Louisiana. “My family is blended and diverse, nutty and loving and understanding,” Bullock said. “That’s a family.”\n\nKristin Davis, 46\n\nDavis adopted her daughter, Gemma, in 2011, and a son, whose name has not yet been revealed, in 2018. The Holiday in the Wild star opened up about being a white mother to two black children during an emotional Red Table Talk interview in 2019.\n\n“Because my children are African American, I feel like it’s my duty and my job to do as much research, as much work, build as many bridges as possible because you are their community,” said Davis. “I work at that every day trying to figure out how I can make sure they have access to the black community, that they’re part of it, that they’re not separated from it.”\n\nRachel Weisz, 48\n\nRachel Weisz gave birth to her first child with Daniel Craig when she was 48.\n\nThey are notoriously private, but Weisz acknowledged her pregnancy in a 2018 New York Times profile, saying, “Daniel and I are so happy. We’re going to have a little human. We can’t wait to meet him or her. It’s all such a mystery.”\n\nMadonna, 42\n\nMadonna was 42 when she gave birth to her son Rocco. She’s since adopted four more kids: David, Mercy, Estere and Stella.\n\nMadonna has six kids total. The Madame X songstress became a mum for the first time in 1996, when she gave birth to Lourdes at 38. Four years later, she welcomed her son Rocco with then-husband Guy Ritchie at age 42.\n\nIn 2006, the singer, then 48, adopted another son, David, from Malawi. Three years later, she adopted another child from Malawi, her daughter Mercy. In 2017, she adopted twins, Estere and Stella, also from Malawi.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker, 44\n\nSarah Jessica Parker was 44 when she welcomed twins via surrogate in 2009.\n\nParker gave birth to her first child, her son James, in 2002. Seven years later, a 44-year-old Parker and her husband, Matthew Broderick, announced the birth of their twin daughters, Marion and Tabitha.\n\n“She’s made a really big choice to be part of our lives and I think she’s an honourable person,” said Parker of her family’s surrogate, according to Glamour.\n\nGwen Stefani, 44\n\nAt 44, Gwen Stefani gave birth to her third child, Apollo.\n\nStefani had two other sons, Kingston and Zuma, when she welcomed her youngest son in 2014."
