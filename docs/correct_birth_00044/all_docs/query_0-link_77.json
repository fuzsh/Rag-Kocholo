        "text": "Singer Born Janet Damita Jo Jackson on May 16, 1966 in Gary, Ind.\n\nThe youngest of the Jackson clan, Janet Jackson broke away from her superstar brothers to make a name for herself in music, TV and film â and caused a bit of uproar along the way.\n\nHer road to mega-stardom took shape after she appeared on the summer TV show âThe Jacksonsâ in 1976; her performance caught the attention of a producer who hired her to play Penny, a regular on the TV comedy series \"Good Times,\" from 1977 to 1979. Other TV work included performances in the sitcom \"Different Strokes\" and the teen drama \"Fame.\"\n\nFrom there, she released her debut self-titled album \"Janet Jackson,\" but scored her first major success in 1986 with \"Control.\" Produced with the writing-producing team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, it sold 8 million copies worldwide, featured two No. 1 singles, \"What Have You Done For Me Lately\" and the title track, and was nominated for numerous awards.\n\nHer next, more socially conscious, album, \"Rhythm Nation 1814,\" spawned a number of hit singles, including \"Miss You Much,\" and \"Escapade.\" Six albums followed â helping her land 33 No. 1 hits worldwide â and Jacksonâs sexy style, stage presence and dancing ability were all showcased in her music videos.\n\nAlong with her work in music, she made films, including her debut in John Singletonâs \"Poetic Justice\" (1993). Her hit song \"Again\" from the soundtrack earned her an Oscar nomination for best song. She also acted in \"The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps\" (2000) and Tyler Perryâs hit, \"Why Did I Get Married?\" (2007).\n\nJackson caused a media firestorm after her performance at 2004's Super Bowl halftime show. During a live performance with Justin Timberlake, Jackson's right breast was exposed, helping to propel the phrase \"wardrobe malfunction\" into its own superstardom. The stunt caused an uproar among the public and in the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nAfter the death of her brother Michael in 2009, Janet returned to the spotlight. She appeared in the 2010 follow-up \"Why Did I Get Married, Too?\" She has a book slated to come out soon, and her first headlining concert since Michael Jackson's death sold out in minutes."
