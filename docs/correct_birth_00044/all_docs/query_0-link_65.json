        "text": "JANET Jackson broke down in tears over a mural of her brothers, The Jackson 5, during a rare visit to her hometown.\n\nIn tonight’s explosive part one of the music legend’s first-ever authorized documentary, a sweet moment was captured by cameras as she unexpectedly stumbled upon a special nod to her famous family.\n\nThe new Lifetime documentary, titled Janet Jackson, kicked off with the singer paying a visit to her hometown of Gary, Indiana.\n\nAs Janet, 55, rides in an SUV with one of the filmmakers, he asked her why she decided to make this documentary after decades of trying to remain as private as possible.\n\n“It’s just something that needs to be done,” she said confidently.\n\n“You have someone do this unauthorized documentary or you have someone else do something or you have a movie that’s candy coa- oh wait, I’ve never seen this before,” she said as the mural caught her eye.\n\n“Turn the camera around. There’s a mural of my brothers, oh I love that.”\n\nThe four-story high black-and-white painting showed her brothers Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, Jackie and of course, Michael Jackson, as kids in their groundbreaking band, The Jackson 5.\n\nJanet then sat back in her seat as her emotions grew while she continued to observe the mural.\n\nAfter reflecting on the unexpected moment for a few seconds, she broke down in tears.\n\n“That’s so sweet and they’re all looking upwards. Except Mike he’s looking straightforward, always so nosy,” she said with a laugh as she wiped away her tears.\n\nIn addition to her Jackson 5 siblings, her large family also included brothers Randy and Brandon along with sisters La Toya and Rebbie Jackson.\n\nThe family was notoriously led by patriarch Joe Jackson - who orchestrated the kids' careers - as well as their mom, Katherine.\n\nWhen Janet - who is the youngest of the family - was just a toddler, the Jackson's moved from Indiana to the affluent Los Angele suburb, Encino, CA.\n\nFIRST EVER INSIDE LOOK\n\nThe new Lifetime documentary - which she also produced - marked the first time the Control singer authorized a project about her life.\n\nAlso in the two-part film, Janet opens up about the long-standing rumor that she secretly had a child with ex-husband, singer James DeBarge, when she was just a teen.\n\nHowever, she slammed the speculation, saying in her doc: “I could never keep a child away from James.\n\n\"How could I keep a child from their father? I could never do that. That’s not right.\"\n\nJanet's first marriage was to American R&B and soul singer James Curtis DeBarge.\n\nSECRETS REVEALED\n\nJames, 58, is known for his work with his family's band DeBarge, which became famous in the mid-1980s following the release of the songs All This Love, Love Me in a Special Way, Rhythm of the Night, and Who's Holding Donna Now.\n\nJanet and James tied the knot in 1984, and that same year, rumors of a potential pregnancy started to spread on set of NBC’s Fame — in which Janet played Cleo Hewitt.\n\nThe singer explained in the special: “A lot of the kids thought I was pregnant ’cause I had gained weight and I had started taking birth control pills.\n\n“And back then, you could pick up weight taking them, and that’s what happened to me, so that rumor started going around.”\n\nThe couple had their marriage annulled just a year later, after Janet discovered that James had allegedly been using drugs.\n\nShe confesses: “I was just incredibly innocent. It’s just, to me, hurtful for someone to see that and just try to take advantage of it.”\n\nThe superstar was also married to Rene Elizondo from 1991-2000 but has been hitched to husband Wissam Al Mana since 2012.\n\nHowever, they announced their separation in 2017 - they same year they welcomed son, Eissa Al Mana, 5, together.\n\nThe second half of Janet's documentary will air on Saturday, January 29, 2022, at 8pm ET on Lifetime and A&E.\n\nIt's timed to coincide with the 40th anniversary of her debut self-titled album.\n\nThe documentary will last four hours in total, and is filled with never-before-seen footage from both Janet's personal and professional life.\n\n“This is my story, told by me. Not through someone else’s eyes,\" Janet has said of the film - which is five years in the making.\n\n\"This is the truth. Take it or leave it. Love it or hate it. This is me.\""
