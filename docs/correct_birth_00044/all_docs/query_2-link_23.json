        "text": "(born 1966). American singer and actress Janet Jackson was one of the most popular recording artists of the 1980s and ’90s. A member of Motown’s famed Jackson family, she turned her family’s success into an independent career that spanned recordings, television, and film.\n\nJanet Damita Jo Jackson was born on May 16, 1966, in Gary, Indiana, the youngest of nine children. Five of her brothers, including Michael Jackson, formed a band, the Jackson 5, while she was just a baby in the mid-1960s. The Jackson 5 were phenomenally successful. The family moved to California, and Janet joined her brothers in performing by the time she was seven. When she was a teenager, she had several roles in television sitcoms, including a recurring role in the hit Good Times. Following an unremarkable recording debut in 1982 and a 1984 follow-up album, Jackson took control of her career. She moved out on her own and developed her own sound and influential style.\n\nJackson’s third album, Control (1986), featured five singles that topped the rhythm-and-blues (R&B) charts. They included two Top Ten pop hits, “What Have You Done for Me Lately” and “Nasty.” She returned in 1989 with her most diverse work, Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814. The album delivered seven pop Top Ten hit singles, including “Miss You Much,” “Escapade,” and “Love Will Never Do (Without You).” Her tours drew thousands of fans to hear her mix of funk, pop, and sentimental ballads. She used video well and featured choreography by Paula Abdul and Anthony Thomas.\n\nJackson continued to enjoy worldwide popularity and critical acclaim in the 1990s and 2000s. Her albums from that time included janet. (1993), The Velvet Rope (1997), All for You (2001), Damita Jo (2004), 20 Y.O. (2006), and Discipline (2008). Unbreakable (2015) was billed as a comeback album. It used contemporary electronic arrangements to bolster the velvety vocals that had established Jackson as an R&B star. In 2019 Jackson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
