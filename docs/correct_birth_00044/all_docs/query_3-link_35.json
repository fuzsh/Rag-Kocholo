        "text": "Three months after welcoming their first child, ET confirms that Janet Jackson and her husband, Wissam Al Mana, have split and it looks as though the two are already starting their lives over, separately.\n\nWhile the couple were raising their 3-month-old son, Eissa, together after his birth in January, an eyewitness tells ET that it seems as though Jackson moved out of their London home a month ago.\n\nWATCH: Janet Jackson Splits From Husband Wissam Al Mana Three Months After Giving Birth to First Child\n\n\"Janet was very rarely seen leaving the house she shared with Wissam. A team of staff seemed to tend to all of her needs,\" the eyewitness said of Jackson's life in London, adding that the couple's staff included \"two drivers, a housekeeper, her own personal assistant, a nanny and more,\" who often ran errands and brought in coffee and food for the couple. On the rare occasion the singer would venture out -- often to a florist or a children's store -- she'd usually bring along her personal assistant.\n\nHowever, for the past month, only Wissam has been seen leaving the apartment, according to the eyewitness, neither Jackson nor her assistant have been spotted at the property.\n\nAl Mana was most recently spotted on Friday in photos exclusively obtained by ET, bringing balloons, children's toys and furniture into his home with help from his staff. The eyewitness speculates this may have been to replace items Jackson moved out with.\n\nPHOTOS: Biggest Celebrity Breakups of 2017 -- So Far!\n\nThe next morning Al Mana's infant son was brought over to his home, and later left the house with a staff member. Janet was not seen. Shortly after his son's visit, Al Mana left his apartment carrying a small suitcase and was driven to a private airport.\n\nJackson apparently began house hunting in February, shortly after her 86-year-old mother, Katherine, arrived in London on Feb. 6. During Katherine's nearly 2-month visit, she did not stay at Jackson and Al Mana's apartment. With her mother in town, Jackson began touring several upscale apartment buildings around London, including properties in the prestigious Mayfair neighborhood, according to our eyewitness. Al Mana was not present for these excursions, Jackson had her assistant by her side.\n\nWATCH: 17 Celebrity Moms Who Gave Birth in Their 40s\n\nIt is believed that Jackson is now staying with her son in a residence close by the home she formerly shared with Al Mana, near London's Chelsea district.\n\nThe pop singer and the Qatari business magnate -- who is estimated to be worth $1 billion -- tied the knot in 2012. Last spring, Jackson, 50, announced that she would be postponing her Unbreakable tour to focus her attention on starting a family. She and Al Mana, 42, welcomed son Eissa on Jan. 3.\n\nThe couple was last spotted together in October, when they were seen sweetly holding hands during a stroll through the London streets.\n\nWATCH: Janet Jackson and Husband Wissam Al Mana Step Out for First Time Since Announcing Pregnancy"
