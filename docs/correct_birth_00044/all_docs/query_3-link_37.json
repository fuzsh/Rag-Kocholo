        "text": "JANET Jackson has brought her adorable baby Eissa back home to New York City for the first time since his birth in London back in January.\n\nThe singer, 51, made her way through the terminal of the US airport holding the six-month-old tot close.\n\nDressed head-to-toe in her customary black, the star wore glasses and her hair in a casual top knot.\n\nAnd Janet seemed in good spirits as she carried the cute youngster into her home country.\n\nIt's been something of a rollercoaster few months for Janet - who split from Eissa's dad Wissam Al Mana when the baby was just three months old.\n\nRecently discussing the breakdown of the relationship in an emotional video message, Janet revealed the pair are \"in court.\"\n\nShe said: \"I just want to keep it real for you guys for a second - yes I separated from my husband.\n\n\"We are in court and the rest is in God's hands.\"\n\nDespite the painful split after five years of marriage, Janet clearly loves being a mum and told her fans: \"Thank God for him [the baby] you guys, 'cos he is so healthy, so beautiful, so sweet, so loving, such a happy baby.\"\n\nJanet went on to confirm plans to hit the road again after previously scrapping her world tour so she could focus on becoming a mum.\n\nThe singer said: \"I am continuing with my tour as promised. I changed the name - State of the World tour.\n\n\"I wanna thank you guys for your patience.\""
