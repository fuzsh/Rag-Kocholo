        "text": "Singer Janet Jackson has officially confirmed she is expecting her first child, at the age of 50.\n\nShe told People magazine:, external \"We thank God for our blessing\", and posed for a picture with her growing baby bump.\n\nSpeculation about her pregnancy surfaced in April when she postponed her 'Unbreakable' tour, saying she wanted to focus on planning a family, external with her husband, Wissam al-Mana.\n\nShe was recently spotted in London shopping for baby essentials.\n\nThe People magazine quoted a source close to the Jackson family as saying: \"She is super excited about her pregnancy and is doing extremely well. She actually feels very good about everything.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Twitter in April, she told her fans that she was postponing her world tour because \"there's been a sudden change\".\n\n\"I thought it was important that you be the first to know. My husband and I are planning our family,\" she said, adding: \"Please if you can try and understand that its important that I do this now.\"\n\nShe went on to say: \"I have to rest up, doctor's orders.\"\n\nOlder parents with young kids\n\nThe 300-year-old fertility statistics still in use today\n\nBabies born to women aged 45 and over rise by a third\n\nJanet Jackson is far from the only famous face to give birth later in life.\n\nOscar-winning Halle Berry had her second child at 47, three years ago, and John Travolta's wife Kelly Preston gave birth to her third child at 48.\n\nGeena Davis - best known for her role in Thelma and Louise - became a mother later in life after falling in love with an Iranian-American neurosurgeon in her 40s. Her first child, a girl, arrived when she was 46, followed two years later by twin boys.\n\nThen there was Swiss billionaire Maria Louis-Dreyfus, who gave birth to twin girls in March 2016, aged 53.\n\nBut these mothers - and Jackson - are all positively young when compared to the world's oldest new mothers.\n\nIn fact, there are at least three women in India who claimed to have carried their children to term when at least two decades older than the pop singer.\n\nOmkari Panwar, said to be 70, gave birth, external to twins, a boy and a girl, in 2008. A few months later, Rajo Devi Lohan, external - also 70 - gave birth to a little girl, her first, much-longed for child.\n\nDaljinder Kaur, who may be as old as 72, although she claimed to be just 70, gave birth to a son in April 2016 after three attempts at IVF.\n\nEach time, the births caused a debate over the ethical issues surrounding having a baby so late in life - especially after Maria del Carmen Bousada de Lara, the Spanish woman who once held the title of the world's oldest mother, died three years after , externalhaving twin boys.\n\nAll three are understood to have used donated eggs in order to have their children."
