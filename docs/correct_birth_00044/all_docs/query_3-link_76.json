        "text": "Janet Jackson has officially announced and her pregnancy. But much like Donald Glover’s news of becoming a dad, this isn’t much of a surprise.\n\nNot only did she indefinitely postpone her tour back in April to, admittedly, begin “planning a family,” but she also teased the aptly-titled single “Dammn Baby.” just a month later.\n\nStill, she confirmed the news herself today (October 12) with a revealing baby bump photo in People, simply writing, “We thank God for our blessing.”\n\nThis is the first child for both Jackson, 50, and husband Wissam Al Mana, 41, who married in 2012."
