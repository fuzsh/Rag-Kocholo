        "text": "Background\n\nJanet Jackson’s full name is Janet Damita Jo Jackson, and she was born on May 16, 1966, in Indiana. Jackson is a multi-talented performer; dancer, actress, and songwriter, and one of the biggest American singers of our time. Jackson was the youngest of 10 children who grew up in a conservative Jehovah’s Witness household. Her elder brothers had hit it big performing as the Jackson 5 by the time she was an infant, but Jackson did not want to follow in their footsteps, and instead, dreamed of becoming a lawyer or a horse-racing jockey. Her father had other plans when he heard the young Jackson sing. He convinced her to give performing a try, and she began her career singing at the Las Vegas M.G.M. Grand Casino. She didn’t only sing but delved into acting as well, appearing in “The Jacksons” in 1976, as well as “Good Times,” “Diff’rent Strokes,” and “Fame,” in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nJackson signed her first recording contract at age 16 with A&M Records in 1982. Her debut album “Janet Jackson” was released the same year. It reached number 63 on the Billboard 200 and number six on the R&B albums chart. Jackson released her second album two years later, which only reached number 147 on the Billboard 200 and number 19 on the R&B albums chart. Both albums featured primarily pop bubblegum music. It was only on her third and fourth albums that Jackson soared to new heights of fame. “Control” shot to number one on the Billboard 200 and sold over 10 million copies worldwide. It received six Billboard Music Awards, including “Top Pop Single Artist,” three Grammy Awards nominations, and four American Music Awards. Her fourth album “Rhythm Nation 1814” was even more successful. It peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold over 12 million copies worldwide. “Rhythm Nation 1814” was considered the “exclamation point on her career” and was the first album to have seven top-five singles on the Hot 100. Jackson broke away from business with her family, signing her third recording contract all on her own with Virgin Records in 1991.\n\nHer next two albums “Janet” (1993) and “The Velvet Rope” (1997) showcased Jackson as a strong female sex symbol. She was thought to be one of the most erotic performers of her time, and these two albums, along with their promotional music videos and live performances, enhanced and solidified this title. Jackson continued to soar until the ill-fated 2004 Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show during which she performed with singer Justin Timberlake and had a wardrobe malfunction. Timberlake ripped off part of her shirt, exposing her breast. Jackson was blacklisted, and radios reduced the airplay of her songs. It was until 2008 that Jackson released her seventh album “Discipline” with Island Records. In 2015, Jackson launched her own record label Rhythm Nation and released her album “Unbreakable” in the same year. In 2019, she achieved a major feat and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Jackson has continued to inspire and take her music to new heights."
