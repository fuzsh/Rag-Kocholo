She has never confirmed nor denied the reports.\n\nThe very private sister of Michael Jackson surprised many when she released a video last year announcing she was pregnant. In January, she gave birth to her first child, Essa Al Mana.\n\nThe family currently lives in London and according to Page Six, the singer’s mother, Katherine, recently returned to Los Angeles after staying with her daughter in the city.\n\nThe couple reportedly has a pre-nuptial agreement that would give Jackson hundreds of millions of dollars if the couple could remain married for five years.\n\nRead: Janet Jackson's Ex-Sister-in-Law Apologizes Over Singer's 'Secret Daughter' Controversy\n\nAl Mana and Jackson married in 2012. He is said to be worth about a billion dollars from his family fortune in the Al Mana Group, a Qatar-based business.\n\nThe singer is believed to be worth $250 million.\n\nIt was Al Mana’s first marriage and Jackson’s third. In 1984, she married singer James DeBarge, a union that was annulled a year later. In 1991, she married dancer and music video director Rene Elizondo Jr., whom she divorced in 2000."
