        "text": "Where was Joe Jackson born?\n\nFull name Joseph Walter Jackson, he was born in Fountain Hill, Arkansas to parents Crystal Lee (née King; 1907–1992) and Samuel Joseph Jackson (1893-1993).\n\nHe was born on July 26, 1928.\n\nHis father Samuel was a teacher, and Joe was the eldest of five children.\n\nJoe later recalled that his father was domineering and strict, and he described himself in his memoir The Jacksons as a \"lonely child that had only few friends\".\n\nWhen his parents split when he was aged 12, his mother, two brothers, and sister moved to East Chicago, Indiana. When he was 18, his father remarried.\n\nJoe got a job in East Chicago at Inland Steel Company, but didn't finish high school. It was here that he began to pursue his dreams of becoming a boxer.\n\nWho was Joe Jackson's wife and how many children did he have?\n\nWhile attempting a professional boxing career, Joe met 17-year-old Katherine Scruse, who also lived in East Chicago.\n\nJoe was actually married to another woman at the time, but was divorced in less than a year before he started dating Katherine.\n\nJoseph and Katherine were married on November 5, 1949, and in January 1950, they bought a small two-bedroom home on 2300 Jackson Street near East Chicago in Gary, Indiana.\n\nTheir first child, Maureen Reillette 'Rebbie' Jackson, was born four months later on May 29, 1950.\n\nJoe soon quit his dreams of becoming a professional boxer in order to support his family, and began working as a full-time crane operator.\n\nIn the 1950s, wife Katherine looked after their growing family. She began working part-time at Sears in Gary.\n\nJoe and Katherine went on to have ten children in total. An 11th, Marlon's twin brother Brandon, died during childbirth.\n\nJoseph was alleged to have had a long extramarital affair. Katherine filed for divorce in 1973, but she decided to drop the divorce papers.\n\nThe following year, Joe fathered a daughter with Cheryle Terrell, named JohVonnie. This led Joe and Cheryle to have a 25-year-long affair while raising JohVonnie.\n\nKatherine attempted to divorce her husband again in 1982, but was persuaded to drop the suit once more.\n\nDespite reportedly living separately for many years, Katherine and Joe remained legally married until his death in 2018.\n\nHis children are:\n\nMaureen Reillette 'Rebbie' Jackson (born May 29, 1950)\n\nSigmund Esco 'Jackie' Jackson (born May 4, 1951)\n\nToriano Adaryll 'Tito' Jackson (born October 15, 1953)\n\nJermaine La Jaune Jackson (born December 11, 1954)\n\nLa Toya Yvonne Jackson (born May 29, 1956)\n\nMarlon David Jackson (born March 12, 1957)\n\nBrandon Jackson (March 12, 1957 – March 12, 1957)\n\nMichael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009)\n\nSteven Randall 'Randy' Jackson (born October 29, 1961)\n\nJanet Damita Jo Jackson (born May 16, 1966)\n\nJoh'Vonnie Jackson (born August 30, 1974) from an affair.\n\nHow did Joe Jackson get his start in music?\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Joe briefly performed with his younger brother Luther Jackson in their own blues band called The Falcons, playing guitar.\n\nHowever, The Falcons didn't get a record deal, and broke up.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Joe began pushing his sons in a musical direction after he noticed them playing around with his musical instruments while he was at work.\n\nHe began working with his three eldest sons Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine first. Younger sons Marlon and Michael were eventually included in the band, while youngest brother Randy was too young to join at the time.\n\nJoe began enforcing long and intense rehearsals for his young sons. The group first went under the name The Jackson Brothers.\n\nWith Marlon and Michael joining, their name was changed to The Jackson 5.\n\nThe Jacksons interview: Will there be a Michael Jackson hologram?\n\nAfter a couple of years performing at local talent shows and high schools, Joe booked them in bigger venues, and they eventually landed a show at the Apollo Theater in New York City.\n\nOn November 21, 1967, The Jackson 5 signed their first record contract with Gordon Keith, owner of Steeltown Records in Gary, Indiana. The group's first single 'Big Boy', with Michael as the lead singer, was released on January 31, 1968.\n\n'Big Boy' was not a hit, but they became local celebrities in Gary. Within a year, Joe landed his sons an audition for Motown Records. The Jackson 5 won a record contract with Motown in March 1969.\n\nWhat was Joe Jackson's relationship with his children?\n\nBy the late 1980s, Joe Jackson's image as a father started to be criticised, as the media reported stories told by his children that he was abusive towards them.\n\nWhile managing his family, he allegedly ordered each of them to call him 'Joseph', and it led to several siblings being estranged from him in later years.\n\nMichael Jackson claimed that from a young age he was physically and emotionally abused by his father, including tough rehearsals, whippings and name-calling, but he also said that his father's strict discipline played a large part in his eventual success.\n\nMichael spoke openly about his childhood abuse in a 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey, saying that Joe would sit in a chair with a belt in his hand as Michael and his siblings rehearsed and that \"if you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you.\"\n\nJoe admitted to whipping his children with belts as punishment, but said he did not do so at random.\n\nBoth Joe and Katherine denied the label of abuse. Katherine said that the whippings and physical punishments were common back then. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon, have denied that their father was abusive.\n\nMichael ultimately forgave his father, stating that Joe's difficult upbringing in the Great Depression and the Jim Crow South, had toughened him emotionally, and made him push his children to succeed."
