My only complaint was that he got into something under the bed, and I wasn't able to see what it was. The front desk clerks were nice, especially the cheerful morning clerk.2016-11-06\"\n\n\"Large room with nice bedding, though the mattress was too soft for me. Nice towels, and we got plenty of them.Had in-room coffee, but no creamer or sweetener. Pets were only permitted on the 3rd floor, which was inconvenient. Hotel only had one luggage cart.

The room was well-appointed, attractive, and clean. There were no towel racks in the bathroom, or even towels. We were told we didn't need a password for the WiFi, but that was incorrect. Nice staff. Breakfast ended too early. Good parking lot.

If you make a $90 non-refundable reservation instead of a $100 refundable booking, you are betting $90 to win $10. Would you do that in Las Vegas? -\n\nDon't assume you can cancel a non-refundable reservation without penalty if you notify the hotel weeks or even months in advance. +Often you cannot Â– because some hotels' profit strategy is to get paid more than once for the same room for the same night. -\n\nAlways read cancellation policies carefully before you make a reservation. + When is the latest date and time you can cancel without penalty? -\n\nMore >\n\nWhen you make a reservation, you will receive a confirmation email. Take a copy with you to the hotel.\n\nThe earlier in the afternoon you check into a hotel, the more likely you will get a room or suite that matches your preferences.\n\n< Less"
