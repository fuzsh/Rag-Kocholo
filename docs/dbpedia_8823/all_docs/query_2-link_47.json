My only complaint was that he got into something under the bed, and I wasn't able to see what it was. The front desk clerks were nice, especially the cheerful morning clerk.2016-11-06\"\n\n\"Large room with nice bedding, though the mattress was too soft for me. Nice towels, and we got plenty of them.Had in-room coffee, but no creamer or sweetener. Pets were only permitted on the 3rd floor, which was inconvenient. Hotel only had one luggage cart.

There was lettuce in the microwave, and the dresser was small and had missing handles. There was hair in the bathtub. Check-in was easy. Adequate parking and good exterior lighting.

The room was well-appointed, attractive, and clean. There were no towel racks in the bathroom, or even towels. We were told we didn't need a password for the WiFi, but that was incorrect. Nice staff. Breakfast ended too early. Good parking lot.

If you make a $90 non-refundable reservation instead of a $100 refundable booking, you are betting $90 to win $10. Would you do that in Las Vegas? -\n\nDon't assume you can cancel a non-refundable reservation without penalty if you notify the hotel weeks or even months in advance. +Often you cannot  because some hotels' profit strategy is to get paid more than once for the same room for the same night. -\n\nAlways read cancellation policies carefully before you make a reservation. + When is the latest date and time you can cancel without penalty? -\n\nMore >\n\nWhen you make a reservation, you will receive a confirmation email. Take a copy with you to the hotel.\n\nThe earlier in the afternoon you check into a hotel, the more likely you will get a room or suite that matches your preferences.\n\n< Less"
