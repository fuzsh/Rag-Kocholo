        "meta_description": "Ali and Nathan had a beautiful June wedding day filled with sunshine at Upper Shirley Vineyards, in Charles City, Virginia. Upper Shirley is such a beautiful venue, with a ceremony space overlooking the water, a lovely outdoor patio space for cocktail hour, and a stunning, elegant indoor space! This unique wedding color palette is definitely a new favorite of mine!! Shades of purple, mauve, lilac, lavender and pops of dark wine paired with greenery, were the colors as a nod to JMU, where Ali and Nathan met and where their love story began.¬†I especially loved that since I am a JMU alum too (Go Dukes!!) To bring their vision to life, we used lots of garden roses, ranunculus, lilac, sweet peas, stock and more- everything smelled SO good!!¬†Ali's wedding dress was absolutely beautiful, with such a classic and elegant style, and it looked so lovely paired with the wisteria colored bridesmaid dresses- so pretty!! To pull the wisteria shade into Ali's look, we tied off her bouquet in our mauve-lavender toned \"Secret Garden\" silk ribbon, and it was a perfect match to the bridesmaid dresses.¬†Their wedding day was photographed by Fowler Studios,¬†who did such a wonderful job, and we loved working with the amazing team at Shelby White Events, and Upper Shirley Vineyards as well!¬†These two are just the sweetest, and it was such a joy and honor to be a part of their wedding day! Scroll to the end of this post for a list of all the vendors who brought Ali and Nathan's wedding day to life- and enjoy! :)",
