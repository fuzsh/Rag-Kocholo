These syndromes are described in her books, Diagnosis and Treatment of Movement Impairment Syndromes and Movement System Impairment Syndromes of the Extremities, Cervical and Thoracic Spine.\n\nOur Movement System Syndromes courses teach you to identify faulty alignment, movement patterns, and muscle imbalances using observation of movement as well as muscle length and performance testing. You will also learn how to alleviate and prevent mechanical musculoskeletal pain through treatment focused on the restoration of optimal alignment and appropriate movement patterns.\n\nNexus Motion provide a certificate of completion that includes contact hours approved by California Physical Therapy Association, which has one of the most strict CEU approvals. Course participants will need to check their own state board’s requirement for acceptance of the course to fulfill licensure renewal CEUs. If the participant requires additional documentation to meet their state board licensure requirements, an additional administration fee will be assessed.\n\nRequest additional information about our Movement System Syndromes courses\n\nVisit our calendar to find out about Movement System Syndromes courses all over the world\n\nUpcoming Webinars\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nUpdates on Shoulder Biomechanics Evidence\n\n7pm-8pm central time, Zoom webinar\n\nSpeaker: Renee Ivens, PT, DPT\n\nRegistration: www.learnmovementsystem.com\n\nAugust 21, 2024\n\nBiopsychosocial aspect of Movement System Syndromes\n\n7pm-8pm central time, Zoom webinar\n\nSpeaker: Shirley Sahrmann, PT, PhD, FAPTA\n\nRegistration: www.learnmovementsystem.com\n\nFlagship Courses\n\nOctober 2024\n\nMovement System Syndromes of the Shoulder, Cervical and Thoracic Spines, hybrid course\n\nDate: October 5-6, 2024\n\nLocation: 4444 Forest Park, St. Louis, MO & Virtual\n\nRegistration Opens: 7/19/2024\n\nAdditional Information: www.learnmovementsystem.com\n\nJune 2024\n\nIntroduction Course for the Upper Quarter\n\nMovement System Syndromes of the Shoulder\n\nDate: June 8-9, 2024\n\nLocation: Virtual Course\n\nRegistration Opens: Recording for the entire course is available!\n\nRegister here: www.learnmovementsystem.com\n\nPast Courses\n\nSeptember / October 2023\n\nFemoral and Hip Movement System Impairment Syndromes: Advanced Applications\n\nDate: September 30 – October 1, and / or October 2, 2023\n\nLocation: 4444 Forest Park Ave., St. Louis, MO, 63108 OR Virtual\n\nRegistration: www.learnmovementsystem.com\n\nJune 2023\n\nIntroduction to Movement System Impairment Syndromes of the Lumbar Spine\n\nDate: June 10-11, 2023\n\nLocation: VIRTUAL\n\nRegistration: www.learnmovementsystem.com\n\nRegistration fee: $400 ($450 after 5/21/2023)\n\nOctober 2022\n\nAdvanced Course for the Upper Quarter\n\nDate: October 1-2, 2022\n\nLocation: 4444 Forest Park Ave., St. Louis, MO, 63108\n\nLearn More\n\nRegistration for On-Site Participation is now closed.\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nIntroduction Course for the Upper Quarter\n\nDate: February 26-27, 2022\n\nLocation: 4444 Forest Park Ave., St. Louis, MO, 63108\n\nRegistration is now closed\n\nCourse is 19.75 contact hours (2.0 CEUs)\n\nCourse Schedule (all times central time)\n\nCourse Description\n\nOctober 2021\n\nAdvanced Course for the Lower Quarter\n\nDate: October 2-3, 2021\n\nLocation: 4444 Forest Park Ave., St. Louis, MO, 63108 and Virtual Option\n\nCourse Schedule\n\nCourse Description\n\nShirley Sahrmann Lectureship:\n\nOctober 1, 2021, Virtual\n\nGuest Speaker: Richard Souza\n\nTitle: Quantitative Imaging as a Tool to Understand Lower Extremity Biomechanics\n\nJanuary 2021\n\nIntroduction Course for the Lower Quarter\n\nDate: January 16-17, 2021\n\nLocation: Virtual\n\nCourse Schedule\n\nCourse Description\n\nOctober 2020\n\nAdvanced Course for the Upper Quarter- Virtual Course\n\nDate: October 3-4, 2020\n\nLocation: Virtual\n\nCourse Schedule and Overview:\n\nCourse Agenda\n\nCourse Description\n\nJanuary 2020\n\nIntroduction Course for the Upper Quarter\n\nDate: January 18-20, 2020\n\nLocation: 4444 Forest Park Ave., St. Louis, MO, 63108\n\nCourse Schedule and Overview:\n\nCourse Schedule\n\nCourse Description & Overview\n\nPrevious Webinars\n\nMay 29, 2024\n\n7:00 PM- 9:00 PM CST\n\nMotor learning principles\n\nRegistration and Additional Information\n\nMay 15, 2024\n\n7:00 PM- 9:00 PM CST\n\nIt’s not all about strengthening / stretching\n\nRegistration and Additional Information\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\n7:00 PM- 9:00 PM CST\n\nShoulder biomechanics\n\nRegistration and Additional Information\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n7:00 PM- 9:00 PM CST\n\nShoulder case presentation\n\nRegistration and Additional Information\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\n7:00 PM- 9:00 PM CST\n\nFundamentals of Kinesiopathologic Model\n\nRegistration and Additional Information\n\nMarch 27, 2024\n\n6:00 PM- 9:00 PM CST\n\nMovement System Syndromes of the Foot / Ankle\n\nRegistration and Additional Information\n\nMarch 4, 2024\n\n6:00 PM- 9:00 PM CST\n\nMovement System Syndromes of the Knee\n\nRegistration and Additional Information\n\nJuly 18, 2023\n\nEvidence for Movement System Impairment concepts with Dr. Shirley Sahrmann\n\n6:00PM Central\n\n1.5 Hour Webinar\n\nEvidence for Movement System Impairment\n\n1.5 hour Zoom webinar with Dr. Shirley Sahrmann\n\nMSI concepts are one of the most evidence based principles!
