        "text": "Allison + Will\n\nThis amazing Upper Shirley Vineyard Wedding was a celebration that reflected the bride and groom’s love and appreciation for all those they hold dear to their hearts!\n\nThere was a bit of debate among the guests as they told the story of Allison and Will. Did they start dating in middle school? Or was it as they say and they started dating in high school? Were their awkward teen years what led to this day? Absolutely.\n\nSurprise!\n\nAnd to confuse you even more, this was NOT a wedding. It was a vow renewal! This was a celebration of their first year married and a chance to have EVERYONE there, because their wedding day was just their closest family and a few friends.\n\nPriorities and all\n\nFrom the very start, this Upper Shirley Vineyard wedding was about the party, the celebration, the FUN they could have with everyone. Allison wore a party dress, there were all kinds of yard games, amazing food and drinks, and a ton of quality time with everyone.\n\nUpper Shirley Vineyard was the perfect host to such an event. The beautiful views, AMAZING catering and drink, and gorgeous setting made it the perfect home for this wedding day. The wide front porch welcome guests whom were greeted with a drink and a hug from the bride and groom. The ceremony looked out to the water view and the dance floor was never empty.\n\nIf you loved this wedding you should check out some of these…\n\nWren Chapel Wedding\n\nGlasgow Farm Wedding\n\nThe Boathouse at Rockett’s Landing Wedding\n\nCheers to the amazing vendors\n\nGreenery + Grace Events – Jenny Keen\n\nVenue + Catering Upper Shirley Vineyards – Bethany + Sally\n\nFlorist Black Creek Flowers – Erica Hutchinson\n\nHair/Makeup Stylist Lou Stevens Glam Squad – Lou\n\nReception Entertainment Black Tie Entertainment – Alicia Robinson\n\nArtist Caricature Artist – Brandon McPherson\n\nbrandondrawsfaces@aol.com\n\nRentals + Lighting- Classic Party Rentals – Mikey Fuller\n\nLighting Professors – Jennifer Parsons\n\nNapkins, cocktail linens + sashes rented\n\nVideographer SIlver Streak Media – Michael Silverman"
