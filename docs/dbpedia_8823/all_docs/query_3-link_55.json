Pheasants are stocked in various locations on DEC managed hunting areas throughout the season, which runs from November 1 through December 31. There is also a four-month season for cottontail rabbits and squirrels from November 1 through the end of February.\n\nEastern wild turkey provides and exciting hunting opportunity for hunters, with a fall hunting season and a youth spring season.\n\nSeasons are also open at varying times for woodcock, crow, fox, and raccoon.\n\nCheck various hunting season dates and bag limits.\n\nEach small game species offers a different challenge, and those familiar with a species' habits and habitat requirements will be most successful. A well-trained dog is also a beneficial companion and is almost a necessity for some species.\n\nDeer Hunting on Long Island\n\nThere is an abundant population of white-tailed deer in Suffolk County. Deer hunting opportunities consist of an archery season from October 1 to January 31, and a shotgun and muzzleloader season in January. The shotgun season is closely regulated with written landowner permission required of each hunter in addition to his or her big game license. Annually, more than 3,000 deer are taken during these two seasons.\n\nYouth Pheasant Hunting on Long Island\n\nThe New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) has announced the dated for the Long Island youth hunt for pheasants. This year, junior hunters ages 12-15 will have a special two-day hunting season on October 30 &31, 2021 in Suffolk & Nassau Counties (Wildlife Management Units 1C & 1A).\n\nPheasant hunting was one of the first hunting experiences for many of today's adult hunters, and this two-day hunt will help maintain this traditional introduction to hunting. The excitement of a cackling rooster bursting out of the grassy cover will be an encounter a new hunter won't soon forget! Less crowded hunting conditions, experiences adult hunters and dog handlers, and mild weather combine to provide an exceptional upland hunting experience for junior hunters.\n\nRequirements to take part in the Long Island youth pheasant hunt include:\n\nHunters must be 12-15 years off age, must have completed a Hunter Education course, and must have a junior hunting license.\n\nYouth 12-13 years of age must be accompanies by a parent, legal guardian, or adult over 21 years of age, with written permission from their parent or legal guardian.\n\nThe accompanying adult must have a valid hunting license. The adult may assist the youth hunter, but may not carry a firearm.\n\nShooting hours are form sunrise to sunset each day.\n\nThe bag limit for the youth weekend is two birds.\n\nAll other pheasant hunting regulations are in effect.\n\nDEC is releasing adult pheasants on specific sites for the Youth Pheasant Hunt weekend. Junior hunters can hunt the DEC properties listed below with a good chance of finding released birds. A free 3-year Managed Land Access Permit is required to hunt these areas. Visit DEC's nForm page is you need information on how to obtain a NY.gov account, which is required for these permits.\n\nRocky Point Natural Resources Management Area parking areas:\n\n2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, 30, 40, 41, 42\n\nOtis Pike Preserve parking areas:\n\n1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 48\n\nA permission form is available in the Hunting and Trapping guide for parents/legal guardians to allow a licensed hunter to accompany their junior hunter in the field.\n\nWaterfowl Hunting on Long Island\n\nLong Island holds the majority of New York's wintering waterfowl. Tens of thousands of ducks and geese of at least 28 species are available to Long Island's waterfowlers.\n\nMost tidal areas are publicly owned and can be hunted without special permission; access, however, is often difficult. The successful hunt generally requires a seaworthy grassboat, well-camouflaged with salt hay, or a scooter painted to resemble waves or ice for open bay broadbill rigs. For the hunter willing to scout for land, some good freshwater shooting of puddle ducks can still be found in eastern Suffolk. The east end also provides excellent goose shooting from leased lands or guided blinds.\n\nSee the brochure An Introduction to Waterfowl Hunting on Long Island, available from the DEC Region 1 office in Stony Brook, for more information.\n\nOn Long Island, Waterfowl Hunter Education courses are offered once or twice a year, and are recommended for both novice and seasoned hunters. Call (631) 444-0255 or visit our Hunter Education page for more information on courses on Long Island and in NYC.\n\nHow Tides Affect Waterfowl Hunting\n\nThe tide is a major consideration in waterfowl hunting on Long Island. It influences the behavior of birds, and significantly affects navigation. The tide range (the difference between high and low tide) varies greatly across Long Island, from as much as 8 to 10 feet in Port Washington (western north shore), to as little as a foot or less in Moriches Bay. Most areas fall in between, with a 3 to 5 foot range.\n\nThere are approximately 12 hours between one high tide and the next, with low tide falling half-way in between. The highs and lows for the following day occur roughly 1 hour later. The specific details of each tide cycle (how high and how low, how quickly it changes, and at what time they occur) is influenced by many factors, including: location, geography (juxtaposition of islands vs. open water), distance to the nearest inlet(s), lunar phase, wind and storm surges (both local and ones out to sea).\n\nIt is important for a hunter to know the tides (both times and extent) to get the most out of a hunting trip, and to return safely. Even a one foot drop in water level can leave a hunter stranded with water too shallow to navigate, and muck too thick to walk through. Strong, fast currents can develop that can challenge a boater's navigational skills, or even sweep a boat out to sea. Tide tables are available from many sources, including; newspapers, local TV stations, local marinas and bait shops, weather services at The Weather Channel and via the internet NOAA, Saltwatertides, Tide and Current Predictor.\n\nPopular Waterfowl Species to Hunt\n\nLong Island has terrific waterfowl hunting opportunities. It's a major wintering area for greater scaup, Atlantic brant, and black ducks. The island sees an abundance of Canada geese, and have plenty of mallards. Just about every other species of duck common to New York can be found at one time or another, somewhere on Long Island. This includes species with no open season, such as an occasional harlequin duck or white-fronted goose, so hunters must be certain to identify their target before they shoot.\n\nCanada geese are plentiful just about everywhere, due to the large population of resident geese. They love the athletic fields, golf courses, parks, sod farms, and lawns that cover Long Island. However, in the early 1990s, a dramatic decline in the migrant Atlantic Population geese resulted in harvest restrictions. The regular goose hunting seasons were shortened throughout most of the Atlantic Flyway from 1992/93 through 1995/96, and closed in 1996/97 and 1997/98.\n\nDuring this period, biologists were able to clearly identify, delineate and evaluate a separate population of Canada geese. This North Atlantic population are the geese that migrate to and through Long Island and other parts of New England. The resulting management plan for this separate population allowed a return of a regular goose season to Long Island in 1998. In addition to the regular goose season, Long Island has a special season specifically for resident geese. This is in September for the Central and Eastern Zones of Long Island. Please note there is no September season in the Western Zone of Long Island. See the season brochure for details regarding zone boundaries and regulations.\n\nSnow geese generally pass through the area early, often before the season opens. They tend to concentrate along the south shore. Most have their sights set on points south, like New Jersey. There are always a few groups that stick around, and one or two stragglers that hang out with the Canada geese. Incidental encounters like this seem to have increased in recent years.\n\nAtlantic Brant are most abundant in the southern bays from the middle of the Great South Bay (GSB) westward.\n\nThose species which prefer freshwater, such as wood ducks and hooded mergansers are more common on freshwater ponds inland or in brackish areas (which are plentiful along the south shore).\n\nCheck out the Waterfowl and Migratory Game Bird Hunting Seasons and Zones.\n\nWaterfowl Hunting Seasons\n\nThe length of the hunting season, as well as bag limits are set annually at the Federal Level and based on current waterfowl populations and expectations for the future. For this reason, the season dates and limits usually change year to year, and hunters need to check the current waterfowl seasons before hunting.\n\nOn Long Island, as with other parts of the state, the dates of the waterfowl season vary from year to year. Tentative season dates are usually available in April, and finalized in late early summer. Keeping this in mind, the following generalities will give you an idea of the season dates on Long Island.\n\nRegular duck, coots and mergansers: 60 days counting back from the last Sunday in January.\n\nSea Ducks: (eider, scoter and long-tailed ducks): concurrent with regular duck season.\n\nBrant: similar to regular duck season, shortened in recent years due to decline in midwinter survey numbers.\n\nSnow Geese: end of November through early March.\n\nCanada Geese (early season for regular geese): the day after Labor Day through the end of September.\n\nCanada Geese (regular): three zones, some portion of which coincides with the regular duck season.\n\nLegal Requirements for Hunting Waterfowl\n\nDucks and geese are considered small game. To hunt them requires an annual New York State small game hunting license. All waterfowl hunters must also register with the Harvest Information Program (HIP) each year, in each state that they hunt. To register by phone, hunters can call an automated system 24 hrs/day, 7 days/week at 888-427-5447 or register online. When hunters register, they will be assigned a registration number, which they must have on them while hunting. A good place to record this number is on the back of the hunting license.\n\nFederal Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp\n\nThe final legal requirement for all waterfowl hunters age 16 and older is the purchase of a $25 Federal Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp - better known simply as a \"Federal Duck Stamp\", which the hunter must sign across the face in ink to validate. Funds generated by these stamps go toward waterfowl management, primarily for the purchase of wetlands. The stamp must be carried while hunting as well. There is no requirement to affix the stamp anywhere, but many hunters stick it to the back of their hunting license. Since the duck stamp is a federal program, one stamp is valid nationwide, regardless of where one hunts. It also acts as a nationwide passport for entry into any National Wildlife Refuge open to the public (without it, each visit usually costs a fee.)\n\nDuck stamps should be available at all US Post Offices; however, you may find any given office does not have them in stock when you visit. They are also available from some sporting goods shops, by phone (1-800-852-4897) or online. Additional fees may apply for phone or internet orders. Both the Federal Duck Stamp and the HIP registration are valid from July 1 through June 30 of the next year, so you need a new duck stamp and new HIP number before each fall hunting season.\n\nWaterfowl Hunting Areas on Long Island\n\nView Long Island's public waterfowl hunting areas.\n\nHunting on Long Island is done in both Nassau and Suffolk Counties. The island is heavily urbanized in the west, gradually becoming less so as you travel east. Roughly halfway across Suffolk County, development becomes interspersed with tracts of agricultural areas (such as cabbage, corn and rye fields, and sod farms). The north shore is best described as an abrupt change from the land to the Long Island Sound, with deep water just off shore. The south shore has a more gradual transition, with most of Long Island being separated from the ocean by a barrier island. This geography provides a multitude of shallow bays, salt marshes and estuaries.\n\nThere are several DEC-managed tidal wetlands that are huntable from shore, but a dog or boat is generally needed for retrieving downed birds. A free 3-year Managed Land Access Permit is required to use this property. Visit DEC's nForm page if you need information on how to obtain a NY.gov account, which is required for these permits.\n\nThe Suffolk County Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation also has six areas that are open to waterfowl hunting. These include Theodore Roosevelt (Montauk), Cedar Point (Sag Harbor), Hubbard (Flanders), and Southaven (Yaphank) County Parks. Access to hunting is also available through Smith's Point Park (Shirley) and Cupsogue Beach (West Hampton Dunes). County residents are given preference, but nonresidents are accommodated, space permitting. For more information, contact: Suffolk County Parks, P.O. Box 144, West Sayville, NY 11796; (631) 854-4949.\n\nFire Island National Seashore (F.I.N.S.), run by the National Park Service (NPS), has two areas open to waterfowl hunting. Fire Island National Seashore's East End Hunting Area is adjacent to the park's Otis Pike Fire Island High Dune Wilderness. A sportsman's recreational vehicle driving permit may be used to access the beach on the Atlantic Ocean side of wilderness area from September 15 through December 31, but access to the bay side of the island is by foot or shallow-draft vessel only. Waterfowl hunting is permitted only from Hayhole Point (west of the Wilderness Visitor Center and boardwalk) to Long Cove (east of Watch Hill). No hunting is allowed from the small bay islands north of Fire Island in this area. A portion of the Pattersquash Gun Club's hunting rights are within the boundaries of Fire Island National Seashore.\n\nFire Island's West End Hunting Area is restricted to shoreline waterfowl hunting from East Fire Island, West Fire Island, and Sexton Island.\n\nYou must first obtain a hunting permit from the Seashore. (Permits can be issued at the Wilderness Visitor Center or, when staff is available, at the West District Checkpoint, (631) 661-2556. Hunters need to bring their hunting license, driver's license, HIP number, and Federal duck stamp to get the permit.\n\nOther areas:\n\nIn general, the bay bottom below the high tide mark is considered public domain and open to hunting. However, there are exceptions. For instance, the Town of Southampton (which claims ownership of the bay bottom) requires hunters in the town to be a resident, or in the company of a resident guide. The Pattersquash Gun Club has exclusive rights to much of Bellport Bay, including the bay bottom. It is possible for local municipalities (such as villages and towns) to pass ordinances prohibiting discharge of firearms. Since there are so many municipalities, and the laws can change at any time, DEC cannot keep track of all these ordinances. It is the responsibility of the hunter to know if a specific area is legal to hunt in before going afield (check with the town or village clerk's office, or local police department).\n\nIf a hunter encounters a \"no discharge\" or \"no hunting\" ordinance, they should try to obtain a copy of both the ordinance and a map of the municipalities' boundary lines. They may find out that the ordinance actually allows hunting under specific circumstances (such as over water, or under the permission of a landowner) or that the area they are looking at is actually out of the municipality's jurisdiction.\n\n*Note: The State holds the authority to regulate hunting, and no lesser government can usurp that authority. Although \"No Hunting\" laws are not valid, they may nonetheless be on the books in some municipalities.\n\nAccess\n\nMost of Long Island waterfowl hunting is done on the bays. It is advisable to avoid crossing the bay or any large expanse of open water during the winter. Dangerous weather conditions can form quickly.\n\nThere are a few public ramps, mostly operated by the town or county that are left open during the winter. Some are free; some require a permit or a fee. In general, town owned ramps require a permit (the fee for which is generally higher for nonresidents), which may or may not be checked and/or enforced during the winter.\n\nThe DEC Marine Fishing Access Unit also publishes a list of boat ramps in the Long Island Region.\n\nMany waterfowl hunters launch over the beach, without a ramp. It's a matter of finding a place where the bay and road are close, without private property or tidal marsh in between. In some areas, the land is so low and tides so high that you can almost launch right on the road during some of the storm tides.\n\nPractice Makes Perfect\n\nSeek out a local gun range to practice on clay pigeons before the season starts!\n\nProtect The Future of The Sport\n\nRegardless of where you hunt, whether it's alone or with a guide or group, you should always be conscious of others, and the effects that your actions will have. You should act as if your every move is under close scrutiny, because it may be. This is particularly so in urbanized areas, like Long Island, where the majority of the population does not hunt, and may not understand hunting. Whatever you do may affect the sport of others. Do not turn non-hunters into anti-hunters. Long Island has some of the best waterfowl hunting opportunities in the state; let's keep it that way.\n\nPublic Hunting Opportunities in Suffolk County, Long Island\n\nDEC manages several public hunting areas on Long Island. Access permits are required as follows:\n\nDEC Managed Land Access permits are required for hunting on all DEC-managed areas on Long Island, except when a daily access permit is required. Daily access permits are not issued to hunters after 2:30 p.m.\n\nDaily access permits are required to hunt on parts of the Rocky Point Natural Resources Management Area and parts of the Otis Pike Preserve from November 1 through December 31.\n\nDaily access permits also are required to firearm hunt for deer on all DEC-managed areas open during the January firearms deer season in Suffolk County. DEC Managed Land Access Permit Procedures for Hunting\n\nExcept for the days of the January firearms deer season, a DEC Managed Land Access Permit is required to hunt on the Sarnoff Pine Barrens Preserve, Barcelona Neck, Westhampton Management Area, East Bartlett, Ridge, Henry's Hollow, East Hampton Cooperative Area, Southampton Cooperative Area, and the following portions of the Otis Pike Preserve and Rocky Point Natural Resources Management Area:\n\nRocky Point (spot numbers 7A, 25 & 33A)\n\nOtis Pike - Topping Path/Hunter's Garden (spot numbers 23-34)\n\nOtis Pike - Eastport (spot numbers 41-42, 58-59)\n\nOtis Pike - Nugent Drive/South River Road (spot numbers 13A, 16A, 35, 43)\n\nOtis Pike - Hot Water Street (spot numbers 46-47)\n\nOtis Pike - Spot number 38A & 65A\\\n\nOtis Pike - Parking Spot 51W (only waterfowl spot on Mill Road)\n\nOtis Pike - Mill Road (spot numbers 56A, 57A)\\\n\nOtis Pike - Ryerson Avenue (spot numbers 60A(2), 61W)\n\nOtis Pike - South River Road (spot number 66A)\n\nA free 3-year Managed Land Access Permit is required to hunt on any of the tidal wetlands areas owned by DEC where hunting is allowed. Visit DEC's nForm page if you need information on how to obtain a NY.gov account, which is required for these permits. See Long Island Hunting Areas for more information.\n\nHunters using the Managed Land Access Permit must park in any open eligible marked spots when provided. For properties that have no designated parking spots, it is the hunter's responsibility to park and access the property legally. There is no need to visit the check station prior to going afield.\n\nDaily Access Permit Procedures, November - December on Rocky Point and Otis Pike\n\nFrom November 1 through December 31, all hunting on Rocky Point (except spot numbers 7A, 25 & 33A) and parts of Otis Pike (parking spot numbers 1 through 12, 14 and 15, 17 through 22, 36, 37, 39, 40, 44, 45, 48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, and 55) is by daily access permit only. Daily access permits can be obtained at the Ridge Hunter Check Station. Daily access permits are not issued to hunters after 2:30 p.m.\n\nNon-Holiday Weekdays\n\nOn Monday-Friday in November or December daily access permits are issued on a first-come, first-served basis. Daily access permits are issued one (1) hour and 15 minutes before sunrise for archers and waterfowl hunters and 15 minutes before sunrise for small game hunters. On weekdays, hunters arriving before the check station opens must park in numbered parking spots in front of the check station according to the order of their arrival and must sign the list at the check station window to ensure their place in line.\n\nWeekends, Holidays, and November 1\n\nOn high volume days (weekends, holidays, and opening day), a.m. hunting is by reservation only. Reservations are made by calling the hunter check station at (631) 924-3156. Refer to the table for the date to call to make a reservation for the day you would like to hunt.\n\nReservations for Rocky Point will be taken from 8:30 a.m.-10 a.m.\n\nReservations for Otis Pike will be taken from 11 a.m.-12:30 p.m.\n\nReservations may continue to be made for either property from 12:30 p.m.-2 p.m.\n\nOnly one reservation may be made per call. The hunter does not need to be the one to call, but the hunter's name and date of birth must be provided. In return for making the reservation, each hunter will be given a number that corresponds to his or her place in line to pick a hunting spot. Early reservations or reservations made in person will not be accepted.\n\nNew and Junior Hunters\n\nNew and junior hunters (new: within two years of completing a Hunter Education course; Junior: 12-15 years old) may call early to make reservations. New and junior hunter reservations will be taken for both properties from 7:45 a.m.- 8:15 a.m. On the day of the hunt you must provide proof that you are either a new or junior hunter by presenting your Hunter Education certificate or a junior license. Only two new or junior hunter reservations may be made per month.

To make an early out reservation, you must call the Ridge Check Station at (631) 924-3156 between 12 and 2 p.m. the day before you want to hunt (Sunday through Thursday only). After making an early out reservation, hunters must pick up their permits and placards and leave their licenses in a drop box on the porch of the check station any time after 6 p.m. the night before they hunt. This will allow hunters to go directly to their reserved parking spots in the morning. Hunters must still check out at the check station no later than one hour after sunset on the day they hunt.\n\nThe following spots may be reserved for an early out reservation:\n\nRocky Point spots: 1, 6, 9, 18, 22*, 26*, 29 - 32, 34 - 41, 43, 44, 49 and 50.\n\n(*two-car spots; only one can be reserved as an early-out spot)\n\nOtis Pike Preserve spots: 3, 5, 7, 10 or 12**, 14, 15, 17 or 19**, 36, 44, 45, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54 and 55\n\n(**only one of these two spots will be given out as an early-archery or early-waterfowl spot).\n\nIf you make an early-out reservation, you may hunt only the species for which the reservation was made. Any hunter who fails to use two early-out reservations in one month will be barred from making or using any early-out reservations for the remainder of the month.\n\nJanuary Firearms Season in Suffolk County\n\nThe January firearms deer-hunting season begins on the Sunday of the first full week in January and continues through the remainder of the month.

Upon making a reservation, you will be issued a Landowner's Endorsement and a Town Permit for the property and town that you have made a reservation for.\n\nThe Ridge Hunter Check Station is located north of Route 25 on Randall Road (½ mile west of the William Floyd Parkway, L.I.E.
