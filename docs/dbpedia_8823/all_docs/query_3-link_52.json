Names that are likely to Mislead the Public.\n\nWithout limiting the discretion of the Secretary of State to determine that a name is likely to mislead the public, a proposed name is likely to mislead the public in the following circumstances:\n\nIf the proposed name creates a false implication of government affiliation.\n\nA proposed name may imply a government affiliation if the proposed name contains the recognized name or abbreviation of a city, county, state, country, region or recognized subdivision within a state or country and/or includes a word or words that commonly denote governmental organization or authority.\n\nWords that commonly denote governmental organization include, but are not limited to, “Agency,” “Commission,” “Department,” “Bureau,” “Division,” “Municipal” or “Board.”​​​​​\n\nExamples:\n\nSan Mateo County Sewer Commission implies a government affiliation. United States Export Development Agency implies a government affiliation.\n\nIf the proposed name creates a false implication that it is a professional corporation within the meaning of the Moscone-Knox Professional Corporation Act. The use of the words “Professional Corporation,” “Prof Corp” or the letters “P.C.” or “PC” at the end of a proposed name by a corporation that is not a professional corporation or foreign professional corporation within the meaning of the Moscone-Knox Professional Corporation Act is likely to mislead the public.\n\nIf the proposed name creates a false implication that it is a business entity formed pursuant to a different law other than that under which it is actually formed. The use of a business entity identifier under Section 21001(c) for a business entity type other than specified in that section is misleading.​​​​​​\n\nIf the proposed name creates the false implication that the business entity’s purpose is to be an insurer. The words “insurance,” “reinsurance,” “assurance” and “surety” in a proposed name for a business entity that is not subject to the Insurance Code as an insurer may mislead the public unless the words are accompanied by other words that remove the implication that the business entity’s purpose is to be an insurer. The addition of the words “agency,” “agent,” “services” or “broker” (such as “insurance agency,” “insurance agent” or “insurance broker”) may remove the implication that the business entity’s purpose is that of an insurer.\n\nIf the proposed name of a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation includes the words “Charitable Foundation” or “Foundation” at the end of the name or immediately preceding a business entity identifier.\n\nNote: Authority cited: Sections 8, 110, 201, 2106, 2601, 5008, 5122, 7122, 9122, 12214 and 12302,13409, 17701.08 and 17708.02, Corporations Code.\n\nReference: Sections 8, 110, 201, 2101, 2106, 2601, 5008, 5122, 6910, 7122, 8910, 9122, 12214, 12302, 13409, 17701.08 and 17708.02, Corporations Code.\n\n21004. Distinguishable in the Records of the Secretary of State.\n\nA proposed name is distinguishable in the records of the Secretary of State from an existing name when it is not the same as an existing name and, except as provided in subsection (b), contains one or more different letters or numerals or has a different sequence of the same letters or numerals that is plainly recognizable by means of sight by the Secretary of State or a designee of the Secretary of State.\n\nA proposed name is not distinguishable in the records of the Secretary of State from an existing name if the names are the same or differ only in one or more of the following ways:\n\nIf the difference between the proposed name and existing name is the existence or absence of business identifiers.\n\nIf the difference between the proposed name and existing name is the use of upper case letters or lower case letters or the use of superscript or subscript letters or numerals.\n\nIf the difference between the proposed name and existing name is the addition or omission of distinctive lettering or typeface, punctuation as defined in Section 21001(f), symbols as defined in Section 21001(g), or spaces.\n\nExamples:\n\nA B C Corp., AB C Corp., A.B.C. Corp. and A-B-C Corp. would not be distinguishable.\n\nGood Time Rest Home, LLC and Goodtime Rest Home LLC would not be distinguishable.\n\nD.R.E.A.M. Incorporated and Dream Corporation would not be distinguishable.\n\nIf the difference between the proposed name and existing name is the use of an ampersand (&) in place of the word “and” or vice versa.\n\nExamples: A & B Corporation and A and B Corporation would not be distinguishable.\n\nNotwithstanding Subsection (b)(3), a proposed name might be distinguishable from an existing name when the difference between the proposed name and existing name is the addition or omission of a space or spaces so that the proposed name creates a new word or words that have different meanings.\n\n​​​​Examples: Got Ham LP is acceptable against Gotham, LP.\n\nNote: Authority cited: Sections 8, 15901.08, 15909.05, 17701.08 and 17708.02, Corporations Code.\n\nReference: Sections 8, 15901.08, 15901.09, 15909.05, 17701.08, 17701.09 and 17708.02, Corporations Code.\n\n21005. Name Reservations, & Verbal Opinions & Court Judgments.\n\nA business entity name that (1) is prohibited by federal or state law except with consent, approval or endorsement or (2) is subject to other state or federal laws may be reserved in writing with the Secretary of State; provided, however, that the Secretary of State will require appropriate evidence of the required consent, approval, endorsement or compliance prior to filing the document containing the reserved name.\n\nA name reservation or written or oral opinion given by an employee of the Secretary of State on the similarity of a name to an existing name or a name reservation issued by the Secretary of State is advisory only and is not a final determination that the name reservation is acceptable. A final determination on the availability of a business entity name is made only when the document submitted has been reviewed by the Secretary of State.​​​​\n\nWithout limiting the discretion of the Secretary of State to determine that a proposed name is not distinguishable in the record, court judgments may be used for evaluating a proposed name being distinguishable in the records from existing names. A proposed name is acceptable if the customer submits a certified copy of the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction establishing the customer's right to use the proposed name in California. All court judgments are subject to legal review and approval prior to filing by the Secretary of State.\n\nNote: Authority cited: Sections 8, 110, 201, 2106, 2601, 5008, 5122, 7122, 9122, 12214, 12302, 13409, 15901.09 and 17701.09, Corporations Code.\n\nReference: Sections 8, 110, 201, 2101, 2106, 2601, 5008, 5122, 6910, 7122, 8910, 9122, 12214, 12302, 13409, 15901.08, 15901.09, 15909.02, 17701.08, 17701.09 and 17708.02, Corporations Code.\n\n21006. Matters Not Considered When Comparing Business Entity Names.\n\nWithout limiting the discretion of the Secretary of State to determine that a proposed name is not distinguishable in the record, the following matters shall not be considered when comparing proposed names and existing names:\n\nSubject to the requirements found in California Corporations Code section 2106, the purpose of a business entity.\n\nWhether or not an existing business entity is actively engaged in business, or has a telephone listing, or a location or place of business.\n\nWhere the proposed entity intends to do business in relation to an existing business entity.\n\nWhether or not an existing business entity is about to change its name, dissolve, surrender, convert or merge out of existence.\n\nWhether or not a letter of consent can be obtained from an existing business entity.\n\nWhether or not the applicant is more or less important, extensive, widely known, or influential than an existing business entity.\n\nWhether or not the applicant has ordered stationery, opened a bank account, signed a contract, or otherwise altered the position of the applicant in the expectation, hope or belief that the proposed name is available.\n\nWhether or not any person or business entity possess any rights, under the common law or statutory law of unfair competition, unfair trade practices, trademarks, trade names, service marks, service names, copyrights or any other similar laws.\n\nWhether or not the name has been approved for use by another agency.\n\nNote: Authority cited: Sections 8, 110, 201, 2106, 2601, 5008, 5122, 7122, 9122, 12214, 12302, 13409, 15901.08, 15909.05, 17701.08 and 17708.02, Corporations Code.\n\nReference: Sections 8, 110, 201, 2101, 2106, 2601, 5008, 5122, 6910, 7122, 8910, 9122, 12214, 12302, 13409, 15901.08, 15901.09, 15909.05, 17701.08, 17701.09 and 17708.02, Corporations Code."
