        "text": "In addition to completing the tasks outlined in the notary public Check List, and subject to passing a background check, a notary public commission can be obtained by passing an exam to verify your knowledge about the laws and regulations affecting notary public services. Exams are administered by CPS HR Consulting and registration can be made online at notary.cpshr.us or by calling CPS HR Consulting at (916) 263-3520.\n\nFingerprints must be submitted electronically through the California Department of Justice Live Scan Program. A Request for Live Scan Service form must be submitted to a Live Scan provider who in turn will electronically transmit the fingerprints to the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nPlease refer to the California Department of Justice website for a list of Live Scan providers.\n\nCertain convictions may preclude you from becoming a notary public. Please review the Secretary of State's Disciplinary Guidelines for information regarding disqualifying convictions.\n\nResults from your Notary Public Examination will be emailed (if you provided an email address on the upper right hand corner of your application) or mailed via United States Postal Service 15-20 business days following the examination. Exam result information will not be discussed over the phone. If it has been more than 25 business days from your exam date, you can contact CPS HR Consulting at (916) 263-3520 or via email to notaryinfo@cpshr.us for assistance.\n\nThe notary public application processing time varies depending on when we receive your correctly completed notary public application and when we receive your background check information from the California Department of Justice for your Live Scan fingerprints. Please refer to our Processing Times webpage for daily updated processing information.\n\nFor up-to-date information about your background check, visit the California Department of Justice's Applicant Background Check Status webpage at https://applicantstatus.doj.ca.gov/. The ATI (Applicant Tracking Identifier) number from the Request for Live Scan Service Form and date of birth are required to perform a search.\n\nThe name check processing time through the California Department of Justice varies and may take up to approximately four weeks.\n\nA system generated letter is sent to you four, eight, and twelve months from your exam date as a reminder to have your fingerprints taken via Live Scan. If you have had your fingerprints taken, we have not received the results from the California Department of Justice. You may wish to check on the status of your fingerprints by visiting the California Department of Justice's Applicant Background Check Status webpage at https://applicantstatus.doj.ca.gov/.\n\nIf you did not file your oath and bond on time, you must reapply to become a notary public.\n\nIf you are a new notary public applicant, you must attach a current Proof of Completion certificate of an approved six-hour notary public education course to your new notary public application, along with a 2\" x 2\" color passport photo of yourself and a check for $20.00. You also will need to submit new fingerprints via Live Scan.\n\nIf you are a notary public seeking reappointment and took an approved three-hour notary public refresher education course, you will still need to take an approved six-hour course. The three-hour course does not meet the education requirements once your current commission has expired. You will need to attach the Proof of Completion certificate for the six-hour course to a new notary public application, along with a 2\" x 2\" color passport photo of yourself and a check for $20.00. You also will need to submit new fingerprints via Live Scan.\n\nIf you are a notary public seeking reappointment and took an approved six-hour education course, you must attach a current Proof of Completion certificate to a new notary public application, along with a 2\" x 2\" color passport photo of yourself and a check for $20.00. You also will need to submit new fingerprints via Live Scan.\n\nPlease refer to Contact Information for the mailing address.\n\nTo change your address, send a letter or a change of address form by certified mail, or any other means of physical delivery providing a receipt, to the Secretary of State within 30 days of the change. (California Government Code section 8213.5.) Please refer to Contact Information for the mailing address.\n\nYour commission allows you to notarize throughout the State of California, regardless of where your oath and bond are on file. If the location of your business has changed, you are required to send the Secretary of State a change of address form by certified mail, or any other means of physical delivery providing a receipt, within 30 days of the change. Please refer to Contact Information for the mailing address. If the address change is for your business, please include the business name in your notification. If the address change includes a change of county, you may choose to file a new oath of office and bond in the county to which your business has moved, however, a county transfer is not required. To file a county change, you must request an oath of office form from the Secretary of State. The oath will have the name of your original county, however, you will take and file your oath of office in the new county, checking the county transfer box at the bottom of the oath form. You also must take a new bond or a duplicate of the original bond and file it together with your oath of office in the new county. A certificate of authorization to manufacture a notary public seal will be sent to you once the Secretary of State has received and processed your oath of office filed in the new county. Your stamp must reflect the county where your most recent oath and bond are filed. (California Government Code sections 8213 and 8213.5.)\n\nTo change your name on our records and your notary public commission, you will need to complete a Name Change Application. Once approved, you will be issued an amended commission that reflects your new name. Next, you will need to file a new oath of office and an amendment to your bond with the county clerk within 30 days from the date the amended commission was issued in order for the name change to take affect. Within 30 days of the filing, you must obtain a new seal that reflects the new name. Once the amended oath and bond are filed, you may no longer use the commission, including the stamp, that was issued in your previous name. If you fail to file your amended oath and bond within the 30-day time limit, the name change will become void and your commission will revert back to the previous name and you will be required to submit another name change application. (California Government Code sections 8213 and 8213.6.)\n\nIf all application requirements are met, your new notary public commission will be issued 30 days prior to the expiration date of your current notary public commission.\n\nTo avoid a break in notary public commission terms, you should take the notary public exam at least six months prior to the expiration date of your current notary public commission. Test results are valid for one year from the date of the examination. (California Code of Regulations, Title 2, section 20803.)\n\nTo resign your commission, you will need to complete and mail the Notary Resignation form to the Secretary of State and deliver all of your notarial records and papers to the county in which your current oath of office is on file within 30 days and destroy your seal. (California Government Code section 8209.) Please refer to Contact Information for the Secretary of State's mailing address.\n\nA duplicate commission certificate can be obtained by written request to the Secretary of State. There is a fee of $10 per certificate. Please refer to Contact Information for the Secretary of State's mailing address. (California Code of Regulations, Title 2, section 20802.)"
