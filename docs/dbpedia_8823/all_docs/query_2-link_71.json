        "text": "A sunny day on a Virginia vineyard was the backdrop for Carrie & Tim’s wonderful wedding! This cool couple chose to incorporate some lovely #pandjpretties as darling decor pieces! They also worked hand-in-hand with our in-house caligrapher to create some fun and fabulous signage for their ceremony and reception spaces. We know you’ll enjoy seeing these great little details from their big day captured by Nathan Mitchell Photography!\n\nThis sweet little sign is definitely one of our faves! We love how this tongue-in-cheek phrasing is prettily lettered on one of our vintage gold frames with a chalkboard insert. This small piece makes a big impact and helps set the tone of the ceremony from the moment their guests walked in!\n\nInstead of opting for paper hand-outs this couple chose to transform their ceremony program into a display piece! A hand-lettered design on another one of our vintage gold frames with a chalkboard insert helped make a sweet ceremony staple into something pretty and unique.\n\na\n\nUnder the tented reception area we find a lovely little jewel-toned lounge area! Our Caned Settee, Abilene Chair, Atwood Rug, Coffee Table, Gray Chowchillas, Wicker Barrel Chair and a handful of pillows create this comfy and chic area for guests to relax and mingle.\n\nOur Classic Copper Lanterns and Horizon Silver Lanterns work wonderfully as decor pieces for the reception tables! We love the touch of metallic an soft candlelight these little beauties provide.\n\nOur Modern Copper Grid takes center stage in the photo booth area creating a great display area for these fun polaroid prints!\n\nMore pie please! We simply adore this dessert display that is created using our 8′ Wooden Truss, Hanging Farm Table and various White Cake Stands.\n\nCongratulations Carrie & Tim! Thank you for letting P&J play a small part in your big day!\n\nFEATURED VENDORS\n\nVENUE – UPPER SHIRLEY VINEYARDS\n\nPLANNING – GLINT EVENTS\n\nFLORALS – ISHA FOSS\n\nDESSERTS – WPA BAKERY – CHURCH HILL\n\nLIGHTING – LIGHTING PROFESSORS\n\nIMAGES – NATHAN MITCHELL PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nSTANDARD RENTALS – CLASSIC PARTY RENTALS OF VIRGINIA\n\nHMU – AVENUE 42 STYLE STUDIO"
