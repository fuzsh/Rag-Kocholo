        "text": "Catching the Eye\n\nThis waterfront contemporary in Kingsmill provides more than a splash of continental style to a Colonial town. (Photography by Kip Dawkins) Dr. Mira Dunn couldn’t figure out why she hadn’t seen the female duck that frequented the water behind her estate home in Williamsburg’s Kingsmill resort community this spring. Then, one day […]\n\nHip, Historic, Hollin Hills\n\nHow a generation of young suburbanites went modern. (Alcoa Care-free Home; photo by Tammy Loverdos) A testament to suburbia in the heyday of Frank Sinatra, martini bars, and Tupperware parties, the mid-century modern community of Hollin Hills runs counter to the buttoned-up colonial revivals that proliferated here during that era. Here, […]\n\nIf These Pillows Could Talk\n\nTextile artist Sarah Gibson Wiley captures life’s singular moments. (Photograph by Adam Ewing) Artist, interior designer, and seamstress Sarah Gibson Wiley gives her clients an inspired way to capture their favorite memories. Since 2012, Wiley has been creating pillows that artistically replicate photos of weddings, pets, children, family homes, and beach vacations. […]\n\nSecret Gardens\n\nWith a little digging, Virginia yields five unexpected gems. As garden visitors know, the state’s showstoppers, like Norfolk Botanical Garden, Lewis Ginter in Richmond, and the State Arboretum in Boyce deserve their place in the limelight. But look a little deeper. These lesser-known gardens are equally welcoming, each fascinating in its own […]\n\nThe Vantage and the Vista\n\nOver the last decade, an Orange County couple has created an ambitious, spectacular garden with English, French and Italian influences. But the strongest presence of all is the Virginia countryside beyond. (Photography by Roger Foley) Crowning the second-highest point in Orange County is an estate called Mount Sharon, with a garden that […]\n\nRethink Gardening\n\nIt’s Colonial Williamsburg’s 75th Annual Garden Symposium and we interview guest speaker and gardener P. Allen Smith. (Photo courtesy of P. Allen Smith) This year’s theme is inspired by Audrey Hepburn’s quote, “To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow.” Now more than ever it is important that we, as gardeners, create healthy […]\n\nHistoric Garden Week\n\nAmerica’s largest open house all began with Monticello’s trees. By the mid-1920s, the trees at Monticello—including more than a dozen planted by Jefferson himself—were in decline, suffering from age and disease. As concern grew, the members of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation wondered: could the Garden Club of Virginia be of help? […]\n\nEarly Bloomers\n\nThe thrill of spotting spring’s first fleeting flowers. virginia_final2 (Illustration by Andrea Cobb) Long Bloomers are easy to love: that blowsy hydrangea, the patch of black-eyed Susans, the marathon of dahlias that stretch into fall. But the gift of early-blooming spring ephemerals is evanescence, not endurance. “‘Ephemeral’ means ‘fleeting,’” says Elaine […]\n\nOrchid Showoffs\n\nThe Orchid Show & Sale is on at Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden. From flowers worth thousands of dollars to your grocery store variety, orchids are not only beautiful but make excellent house plants. After all, they are one of the largest families of flowering plants with more than 100,000 hybrids and cultivars. […]\n\nOne House at a Time\n\nHistoric renovations bring housing to Roanoke’s needy. Roanoke’s Restoration Housing is breathing new life into blighted historic-district properties while helping those in need of stable housing. Founded in 2014 by Isabel Thornton, a preservationist and affordable housing developer, the nonprofit has transformed five homes, now occupied by local nonprofits and low-income residents looking […]\n\nA Garden Room with a View\n\nLandscape architect Rachel Lilly designs outdoor spaces that reflect the history and sentiment of the land. Twenty years ago, when Rachel (who is known to her friends as Rusty) Lilly and her husband Graham inherited Bogota (pronounced like pagoda)—a historic two-story brick Greek Revival house in Port Republic built in 1845 by […]\n\nThe Magic in the Mix\n\nA 300-year-old Powhatan house gets a contemporary update. Mali Azima Build in the mid-1720s, Manakin, located in Powhatan County, traces its origins to Pierre Chastain, a leader of the area’s earliest French Huguenot settlers. “In its 300-year history, the house has had only four owners,” says Cheryl Goddard who, with her husband Steve, […]\n\nCurrent Obsessions\n\nSix designers share their favorite finds for 2022. (Photo by Laurey Glenn) With an eye on the latest colors, finishes, and furnishings in the world of home décor, six interior designers from across Virginia share the design finds they’re loving now and what’s on trend for 2022. One thing is certain—wallpaper is […]\n\nOld Glory\n\nRestoring the grandeur of an antebellum compound takes labor, money, and love. (Photography by Kip Dawkins) John Holland knew when he first visited Oak Ridge, more than 20 years ago, that there was much more to the sprawling, careworn estate in Nelson County than the overgrown gardens and deteriorating steps he saw […]\n\nItaly in Virginia’s Piedmont\n\nVenetian glass meets Neopolitan furniture at Tra Vigne, probably the only Virginia house with a lemonaia. (Photography by Kip Dawkins) Steeped in history but brand new, Rex and Jane Scatena’s Free Union villa and vineyard Tra Vigne is a Grand Tour in an afternoon. Vicenza, the legendary land of Palladio, yielded the […]\n\nLife of the Party\n\nBarry Dixon’s Warrenton manor, Elway, is 100 years old. The place was built for glittery social events and the designer is only too happy to continue the tradition. (Photography by Gordon Beall) The year 1907 was one of giddy progress in the United States. It opened with President Theodore Roosevelt shaking a record […]\n\nMagnificent Magnolia\n\nDecorating the house with fresh greenery is a holiday tradition—and, with its big, glossy leaves, this Southern belle rules the season. (Photography by Patricia Lyons) When I was a docent at the Valentine Museum in Richmond, I had some visitors from up north walk out into the courtyard and ask, “Is that a […]"
