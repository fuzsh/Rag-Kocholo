        "text": "Since moving to Richmond, I’ve been adventuring every single week to check out wedding venues around Richmond! Meeting coordinators and getting to see wedding spaces! It’s something that I haven’t done before, but wondering why it took me so long! I’m working through a long list of venues that are on my “hope to shoot here someday” list! From Richmond city venues to the outskirts – if you’ve got a favorite venue that you think I should visit, tell me below in the comments! For now, enjoy the first wedding tour of Upper Shirley Vineyards in the outskirts of Richmond in Charles City! I visited USV a few weeks ago with my wedding planner friend, Alana, of Chancey Charm (who is amazing!) and we were given a tour from their fantastic wedding coordinator, Catherine! Catherine gave us a tour guiding us from the beginning of the day to the end starting with the gorgeous getting ready suite – bright with tons of natural light- every photographer’s dream! Next we headed downstairs and outside to the ceremony space that faces the James River – yessss!\n\nNext Catherine showed us the different ways people could host their cocktail hours and then into the reception space which is a blank canvas waiting to be turned into the wedding of your dreams! We also learned about the “rain plan” which, I think, is pretty great on the porch!! USV has two gorgeous porches both in the back and front that offer such a great space for your rain plan, cocktail hour, and/or extra seating during the reception. Also – the patio out back that could also be a space for reception dancing should you want to have an outdoor dance floor under the stars! I love that there is the ability to transform each part of this venue to fit your style and personality. If you can dream it, you can probably do it at Upper Shirley Vineyards!\n\nHere are some behind the scenes photos from Upper Shirley Vineyards – a gorgeous Richmond wedding venue!\n\nI hope to come back very soon!\n\nEvery couple gets their name customized on the horse for their wedding day! “Rain plan porch” – how gorgeous is this!? The tasting room can be a place for pre-wedding tastings or cocktail hour. They sure knew photographers would be happy with this bright, white, getting ready suite!! Look at all that natural light! Comfy space for the whole crew to hangout! Man cave in the basement!\n\nThey set up the altar space (typically) between these two trees with guests facing the James River! After the ceremony, guests can make their way to the patio or porch for cocktail hour. Ceremonies can also take place on the patio.\n\nThis Cozy Caravan has a permanent spot on the patio and can be used on the wedding day as a bar. So cute! There’s a lot that can be customized for this patio on a wedding day! Ceremony space, cocktail hour space, alternate dance floor space under bistro lights?! … whatever you can dream up! Ballroom is ready for whatever design your heart can dream up! I love that it’s a blank space for any kind of theme. Simple white walls and ceiling – for the win. They’re all set up with a stage for a DJ or band. (Stage can be moved also!)\n\nSo many wines to choose from! What’s your favorite wine? After our tour with Catherine, Alana and I enjoyed a wine tasting an some truffle fries on the porch… because we’re very classy ladies and had to soak in a gorgeous day. As we were leaving, we pulled over to say hello to this cute horse… who was obviously waiting for his (her?) close up! Thank you for the tour Upper Shirley Vineyards! Can’t wait to come back!\n\nStay tuned for more Richmond wedding venue tours coming to the blog soon! As always, if you have any comments or questions, hop on over to the contact form and send me a message! Can’t wait to hear from you soon!"
