        "text": "The Charles L. Bowden Golf Property, now operated by the city of Macon as Bowden Golf Course, consists of about 250 acres, with an 18-hole, 6492-yard, par 72 golf course. The course has changed little since it was laid out in 1940 to take advantage of the natural topography of the property. Located at 3111 Millerfield Road, the course is still open to the public.\n\nThe land on which the course was developed was a gin and machine works as early as 1846, but it gained prominence as Miller Field, the only airfield in Georgia outside of Atlanta in 1926. Heavyweight boxer W.L. “Young” Stribling operated a flying school during this period, and Amelia Earhart even stopped and spent the night in 1931.\n\nA group of volunteers headed by local golf professional Dick Cotton approached the city with the idea of converting the airfield into the area’s first public golf course in 1937.\n\nThe city and the Works Progress Administration approved the project on June 10, 1938, and construction proceeded with funding from the WPA, the Junior Chamber of Commerce, the city of Macon and the general public. The Dick Cotton-designed course opened on Sept. 29, 1940. Until 1961, the course was played exclusively by white men and women. In 1954, 48 African Americans petitioned the city of Macon for the right to play at Bowden. On June 6, 1961, the Macon City Council agreed to integrated status, and The New Era tournament for African American players began that year and continues to this day. Local leaders of the integration of Bowden included Edward Grant, Arthur Vinson, Leonard Grant and Larry Glover.\n\nCherokee Brick\n\nLocation: 3250 Waterville Road, Macon on about 4,000 acres. The brick company was developed between 1877 (Stratton Brick Co.) and 1949 (the company name was changed to Cherokee Brick and Tile Co.). The prehistoric archaeological sites date from 8000 B.C. – 150 A.D.\n\nThe Cherokee Brick and Tile Co. historic district represents the entire brick-making process, from the mining and transportation of clay to the manufacture and shipping of brick. The two principal brick-making buildings at the main plant are the combined Plant Nos. 1 and 2 (1920 — 22 and 1960s) and Plant No. 3 (1947 – 1949). A large, gambrel-roofed clay storage building (1926) sends clay to both main plant buildings by overhead conveyors. Finished bricks ready for shipping are stacked along a spur line on the site of earlier kilns. The two straight kilns can produce 100,000 bricks every 24 hours. More than 130 million bricks are produced annually.\n\nThe district also includes networks of roads and rail lines, several surviving rail cars, and a plate-girder turntable bridge (1928) across the Ocmulgee River. Archaeological survey and testing on the tract have resulted in the discovery of nine prehistoric sites, seven of which have been recommended eligible. These sites range in age from the Early Archaic period (8000 – 6000 B.C.) to a previously unreported Mississippian Period Lamar mound complex (1450 – 1550), which appears to include a central ceremonial mound and about sixteen house mounds.\n\nCherokee Heights\n\nMacon’s Cherokee Heights was placed on the National Register of Historic Places because it was one of the first planned residential and suburban communities in Macon. Developed from 1909–1923, the homes are primarily built in the styles of Georgian Revival, English Tudor, Spanish Mission, Craftsman and Bungalow, including many homes designed by Georgia architect Neel Reid.\n\nCherokee Heights was developed by a real estate developing company, the Vineville Improvement Co. This company provided the first suburban development of its kind in Macon. The area was developed in two phases, the first from 1909 to 1911, and the second in 1923. Businessmen, managers, and other professionals of the early 20th century middle class lived in Cherokee Heights.\n\nLocation: Bounded by Pio Nono Avenue, Napier Avenue, Inverness Avenue and Suwanee Avenue.\n\nDeveloped: 1909 to 1923. About 67 acres. Planned residential suburban community.\n\nArchitectural Styles: Georgian Revival, English Tudor, Spanish Mission, Craftsman/Bungalow. Good collection of architect Neil Reid houses.\n\nEast Macon\n\nEast Macon Historic District, located one mile east of the central business district, consists of mid-19th through early 20th century residential, commercial and educational development. East Macon’s historical significance lies in the architecture of the homes and buildings in the area, as well as the obvious community planning and development.\n\nIn the 1920s, land in East Macon was sold for settlement and was further developed into the present pattern of large homes on large lots. Beginning in the 20th century, smaller, more modest homes were incorporated, developing the neighborhood that is still visible today.\n\nArchitectural Styles: Italianate, Folk Victorian, Neoclassical Revival and Craftsman.\n\nFort Hill\n\nAbout a mile east of Macon’s central business district is the Fort Hill Historic District. Fort Hill was accepted onto the National Register of Historic Places due to the area’s significance in historic architecture and community planning representing the 1870s through the 1940s. Adding to the district’s antiquity are a church, numerous corner stores and two schools built in the 1930s.\n\nFort Hill Historic District is built on land that was sold for settlement in the 1820s and continued development well into the 20th century. This district also includes the Historic Fort Hawkins, which is also listed on the National Register. A reproduction of the fort is also located within the district.\n\nLocation: One mile east of central business district. Bounded by Emery Highway, Second Street Extension, Mitchell, Morrow and Schaeffer Place.\n\nDeveloped: 1870-1941. Acreage: About 140 acres\n\nArchitectural Styles: Queen Anne, Folk Victorian, Craftsman, and English Vernacular Revival.\n\nIngleside Historic District\n\nThe Macon Historic District (interactive map) is the historic commercial, residential and institutional development that grew out of Macon’s original town plan and forms the city’s historic core. The district’s development began in 1823 when the town plan was first laid out and continued into the 1940s. The district is significant in the areas of architecture, commerce, community planning and development, politics/government, landscape architecture, education, and transportation.\n\nThe historic Terminal Station is an exceptional example of monumental architecture in downtown Macon. The former railroad station was designed in the Beaux Arts style and with Beaux Arts planning principles. Historic community institutional buildings are another group of prominent freestanding buildings located throughout the district. Christ Church, Mulberry Street United Methodist Church and First Presbyterian Church are all over 175 years old. They are examples of Gothic Revival, Richardson Romanesque, and High Victorian Gothic.\n\nThe majority of Mercer University’s buildings are variations of the Academic Gothic Revival style and Victorian Gothic and Neoclassical Revival.\n\nThe district contains a significant and varied collection of residential buildings that range from landmark mansions to small worker homes. There are three distinct neighborhoods within the district that depict the various styles of architecture: Intown Neighborhood, Huguenin Heights, and Tatnall Square Heights. Part of the Intown neighborhood includes College Hill, where Macon’s upper-class citizens built a number of landmark houses. These houses are very large and generally date from the 19th century. Many of them are the work of prominent Macon architects.\n\nThere are several historic landscaped parks in the district, including Coleman Hill Park in the College Hill neighborhood and the four-block Tatnall Square Park.\n\nLocation: Roughly bounded by Walnut, Broadway, Oglethorpe, Central of Georgia Railroad, Edgewood, Interstate 75, and Madison Avenue\n\nDeveloped: 1823 (the date of the original town plan) through 1942\n\nArchitectural Styles: Folk Victorian, Queen Anne, Italianate, Neoclassical Revival, Bungalow/Craftsman, Classical Revival, Colonial Revival, Greek Revival, Commercial Style, Tudor Revival, Italian Renaissance, Late Gothic Revival, Romanesque, Skyscraper, Moderne, Art Deco, Gothic, and Beaux Arts.\n\nHuguenin Heights\n\nHuguenin Heights was the first neighborhood revitalization project by Macon Heritage Foundation. Begun in 1994, a total of 16 houses were restored for single-family owners. Bounded by Tatnall Square Park, Interstate 75, Oglethorpe Street and Coleman Avenue and adjacent to Mercer University campus, the neighborhood features two-story Queen Anne houses averaging 2,300 square feet, most of which were built in the late 1800s.\n\nThe objectives of the project were to restore the neighborhood to predominately owner-occupied residential status and to create an environment where residents’ pride in their neighborhood would reduce crime and maintain the properties.\n\nThe project was a tremendous success. In 1992, the neighborhood had 189 police calls in seven months. In the same seven-month period in 1997, only 29 calls were reported. That is a reduction of 85%. Property values have more than doubled since the revitalization has been completed. The project has garnered national acclaim in that it was a featured tour of the National Trust of Historic Preservation in 1998 and it was on “Restore America” on the HGTV channel.\n\nIn 2001 the Georgia Trust awarded its Excellence in Rehabilitation award to MHF for Huguenin Heights.\n\nTatnall Square Heights\n\nTatnall Square Heights was Macon Heritage Foundation’s second neighborhood revitalization project. The area was first developed between 1890 and 1925 and is located adjacent to Tattnall Square Park and is bounded by Adams Street, the Central of Georgia Railroad, College Street and Oglethorpe Street.\n\nThe neighborhood consists of 82 properties including 18 owner-occupied houses, 36 non-owner occupied houses, 24 vacant lots and four commercial structures. Many of the houses are Queen Anne cottages with 2-3 bedrooms and 2 baths. It is anticipated that the foundation will rehabilitate or construct at least 14 residences for single families to bring homeownership above 60%. Christmas in April has focused on the neighborhood in April 2000 assiteing many of the existing homeowners with necessary repairs. This project builds on Macon Heritage’s success in the Huguenin Heights area where 16 houses have been rehabilitated for single-family homeownership.\n\nSeventeen houses have been sold, creating 50% home ownership in the area\n\nNorth Highlands\n\nNorth Highlands, one mile from Macon’s central business district, is recognized by the National Register of Historic Places because of its architecture, community planning and development. North Highlands was originally one plantation, owned by Thomas Woolfolk, who in the 1830s parceled and sold the land as farming and plantation land. The region then developed as a suburb in the late 19TH and early 20th centuries.\n\nThere’s a wide variety of architectural styles in North Highland. Homes range from the older and larger Greek Revival, Queen Anne, Shingle Colonial Revival, Classic Revival, and Craftsman styles to the more economical one-story bungalows and early ranch style homes. The earliest house in the district is the Melrose-Barton House, circa 1850, which exemplifies the Greek Revival style. Queen Anne style homes with their doric columned porches dominate at the intersection of Summit and North Avenue while English Vernacular Revival cottages are present on North Avenue. Nottingham Drive and the Curry Place/Clay Street section have many bungalows and brick ranch houses.\n\nNorth Highlands began with a residential and agricultural emphasis, but it is now the home of businesses and schools too.\n\nNorth Highlands has an active neighborhood association. For more information visit their website.\n\nLocation: One mile northeast of the central business district. Bounded by Nottingham Drive, Boulevard and Clinton Road.\n\nDeveloped: circa 1898-1936. Acreage: About 130 acres\n\nArchitectural Styles: Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Neoclassical Revival, English Vernacular Revival, Greek Revival and Craftsman.\n\nPleasant Hill\n\nMacon’s Pleasant Hill Historic District is significant due to its function as a historic black community. Developed from the 1870s until the 1930s, Pleasant Hill residents consisted of property owners, doctors, dentists, educators, attorneys, businessmen, grocers and ministers. Lewis Williams, a principal of numerous Macon schools, and Albert B. Fitzpatrick, manager of the black-organized Peoples Health & Life Insurance Co., represent just a few of the influential black residents of Pleasant Hill.\n\nPleasant Hill consists of mostly one-story homes with simple porches reflecting the “L-shaped” Victorian cottages. Many homes in the area show the influence of other styles such as Neoclassical columns and Craftsman-style porches. Included in the area are several corner stores, a Masonic Lodge, one small wood-framed church, and the St. Peter Claver Church and School in a late Victorian brick style.\n\nLocation: Bounded by Madison Street, north of Vineville Avenue, east of Rogers Avenue, south of Neal Avenue. Bisected by I-75.\n\nDeveloped: 1870-1936 Acreage: About one square mile\n\nArchitectural Styles: Queen Anne, Neoclassical and Craftsman cottages and “shotgun” style houses. First African American neighborhood. Linwood Cemetery included within boundaries of district.\n\nRailroad Industrial District\n\nThe Vineville Historic District (interactive map), 1 1/2 miles northwest of downtown Macon, was accepted into the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. This district includes not only residential but also commercial buildings incorporating a wide variety of architectural designs from the 1830s to 1930s. Represented in the 700 homes, churches, and businesses are Plantation Plain, Victorian, Neoclassical, and Bungalow styles. The district also features extraordinary examples of the Spanish Villa, English Tudor, Italian Renaissance, Federal Georgian and Jacobean styles. Prominent residents of this historical district included the Rev. G.F. Pierce, the first president of Macon’s Wesleyan College, George M. Logan, mayor of Macon in 1839, and Thomas Hardeman, a United States congressman in the late 1850s who developed the “stars and bars” on Georgia’s previous state flag.\n\nBeginning as an area full of large plantation estates, the Vineville Historic District boasts many large Plantation Plain homes, such as the Solomon-Smith house at 2619 Vineville Ave. The Greek Revival architectural style is represented in the Napier-Small house built in 1846 at 156 Rogers Ave., which is nationally recognized as a prototypical example. Notable architect Neel Reid designed the Max Morris house in 1915 at 2082 Vineville Ave. in the Colonial Revival style. Other significant homes include 172 Cleveland, circa 1836, and 201 Clisby, which was built in the 1830s by Samuel T. Bailey and sold to Joseph Clisby, the first president of the Board of Education, in 1858. Clisby Elementary School — now Vineville Academy — was named in his honor. As the Vineville area became more suburbanized, the addition of churches such as Vineville Presbyterian and Vineville Baptist Church complemented the district with unique and grand architecture.\n\nVineville has a very active neighborhood association. For more information about the Vineville Neighborhood Association and its functions, see its website.\n\nLocation: Along Vineville Avenue from I-75 to Georgia Academy for the Blind and including side streets such as Pierce Avenue, Hines Terrace, Cleveland Avenue, Buford Place and Rogers Avenue. Adjacent to Pleasant Hill Historic District.\n\nDeveloped: c. 1830 – 1935. Acreage about 525 acres.\n\nArchitectural Styles: Classic Revival, Queen Anne, Craftsman/Bungalows, Plantation Plain, Victorian, Neoclassical, Spanish Villa, English Tudor, Italian Renaissance, Federal Georgian, and Jacobean."
