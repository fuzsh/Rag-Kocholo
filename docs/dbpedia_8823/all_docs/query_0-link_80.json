        "text": "Constructed circa 1795 for Major James Woods (1761-1832), Three Chimneys is one of the earliest extant brick houses in Nelson County. The Georgian house with Classical Revival modifications features Flemish bond brickwork, an unusual floor plan, and one of the most elaborate chimney pieces in the area. The property also has several extant outbuildings including an original kitchen constructed of brick laid in Flemish bond. The Major James Woods House (Three Chimneys) has a period of significance ranging from 1795 to 1915, beginning with the approximate date of the house’s initial construction and ending with the period in which James Jeter Goodwin and Ressie Goodloe Goodwin added Classical Revival features to the house. It is locally significant under Criterion C as an excellent example of a late Georgian dwelling in Nelson County.\n\nThe Britt Gardens Site 35JA789 is the former homestead of pioneer photographer, agricultural innovator, and renowned capitalist Peter Britt. The Britt Gardens Site 35JA789 falls within the Jacksonville National Historic Landmark (#66000950), is listed on the local register as a contributing historic resource, and has been a registered archaeological site since 2010. The Britt Gardens Site 35JA789 is eligible for listing in the National Register at the Statewide level under Criterion B in the areas of Art and Landscape Architecture for its intimate association with Peter Britt, who arrived in Oregon in 1852, and worked at this location until his death in 1905. The period of significance for the Britt Gardens Site 35JA789 in the area of Art begins in 1852 and ends in 1905, with the death of Peter Britt, while the period of significance for Landscape Architecture begins in 1852 and ends in 1954, with the death of Peter Britt’s daughter. Britt’s photographs, which documented the people, places, and events that defined the region throughout the second half of the 19th century, were known throughout the Pacific Northwest. Britt not only captured a changing region through his photographic images, but also his agricultural innovations, craft businesses, and larger capitalist endeavors helped to shape it. The agricultural industries that he helped to pioneer have come to define the region—with pear orchards a powerful economic driver in the 20th century and grape cultivation and wineries a leading part of the region’s 21st century economy. Britt is also known for creating a formal garden that was historically cherished as a community space and popular tourist destination, 1 a legacy that continues to this day through the park and outdoor music venue. The Britt Gardens Site 35JA789 is also eligible for listing in the National Register at the Statewide level under Criterion D in the area of Archaeology and Exploration/Settlement for its ability to provide significant historical information through its robust archaeological deposits."
