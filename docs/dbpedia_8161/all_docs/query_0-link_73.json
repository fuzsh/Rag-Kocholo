        "text": "I come out of the tube at High Street Kensington\n\non Saturday 6 May.\n\nIt is a rainy day,\n\nthe traffic is sparse,\n\nthe usual city-dwellers on the streets.\n\nPolice sirens,\n\nI am reminded of the coronation 3 miles away.\n\nI enter Kensington Gardens.\n\nA crow baths in rain water.\n\nI walk up and towards the gallery.\n\nI read on its wall,\n\n“Steve McQueen makes sure that Grenfell will never be forgotten.”\n\nWe fly high and across residential land.\n\nThis is London.\n\nWe arrive at Grenfell Tower.\n\nNo words, no sound,\n\nimmeasurable silence.\n\nNaked steel windows.\n\nGrenfell is deserted.\n\nDebris-filled plastic sacks and scaffoldings\n\nreplace human ashes.\n\nForensics in white PPE scattered around the crime scene.\n\nGrenfell is coal black, burnt.\n\nFilmed 6 months after the tragic fire,\n\nwe are guided by the light of the afternoon sun,\n\nwhere once was life,\n\nhope,\n\nsunlit drapes on the walls\n\nat magic hour,\n\nsoft shades of glorious plant leaves…\n\nThese are no more.\n\nThere’s only death.\n\nHell.\n\nHow can this be possible?\n\nWarnings were alarmed.\n\nIt was not an accident.\n\n72 lives lost.\n\nSeventy-two human beings,\n\nLondoners, siblings, mothers, fathers,\n\nseventeen kids, an unborn child,\n\ndied in the fire.\n\nSilence.\n\nWe go around another panoramic look.\n\nCruelty.\n\nLook again.\n\nThe accomplishment of crime.\n\nThe killing of Grenfell community.\n\nUnfulfilled dreams burnt by corporate myths and neglect.\n\nViolence.\n\nThe burnt cladding,\n\na carnivorous, now snake-looking relief.\n\nWhat was once the heart of a community,\n\nthe heart of new beginnings,\n\nburnt remains of the tower rises\n\nwhere human beings\n\nonce lived.\n\nIrreplaceable lives lost\n\na grotesque tragedy,\n\nof towering xenophobia\n\nand governmental impunity.\n\nA divided London.\n\nWe fly like burnt souls\n\nuntil we’re woken up to the urban soundscape:\n\nWe will never forget Grenfell.\n\n14 June 2023 marks 72 months since 72 people lost their lives in the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017.\n\nGrenfell United\n\nGrenfell (2019) by Steve McQueen screens at the Serpentine South Gallery from 7 April – 10 May 2023.\n\nIt was a long and tumultuous year for London. People stormed the streets to demand a fair, non-racist society, to protect the NHS and defend human rights. Extinction Rebellion protesters spoke out loud for the safety of our planet. There were unlawful arrests and protest halts but in November hundred of protesters were given the right to sue the Metropolitan Police. Brexit also marked a huge question over the future of touring for international art and artists and the safety of European nationals living in the UK. Inside the city’s major museums and galleries, most of the artworks spoke in favour of the people’s voice and this was refreshing.\n\nHere is a round up of how artists and art curators responded to national and international events.\n\nLee Krasner: Living Colour\n\nBarbican\n\nMay – September\n\nThe Barbican hosted the first European retrospective of Lee Kransner’s work in 50 years. Lee Krasner: Living Colour was a rare and exciting opportunity to experience the work of a modern icon whose marriage to one of America’s greatest abstract artists, Jackson Pollock, never compromised her own artistic vision. Highlights included the electric Desert Moon, 1955 and Icarus, 1964 – a huge canvas sitting in a calm space flooded with natural light towards the end of the exhibition.\n\nKrasner’s canvases at a time of crisis when Pollock died in a car crash in 1956, “Night Journeys” as dubbed by her poet friend Richard Howard, are echos of eruption, emotion and sadness. She described these 24 works of white and umber as “embarrassingly realistic… I was going down deep into something which wasn’t easy or pleasant.” She was a member of the American Abstract Artists group who defied a signature vision and one of the few women to have had a solo show at New York’s Museum of Modern Art in 1984.\n\nKader Attia: The Museum of Emotion\n\n& Diane Arbus: In the Beginning\n\nHayward Gallery\n\nFebruary – May\n\nOne of my two exhibition highlights this year with reference on the brutality of colonialism, Kader Attia: The Museum of Emotion addressed the effects of colonial legacies and the complexities of reparation. It opened with a series of the French-Algerian artist’s photographs, sculptures, installations and collages.\n\nIn the upper galleries, Diane Arbus: In the Beginning was a collaboration between New York’s The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Hayward Gallery. It looked into the formative first half of Arbus’ career that shaped her widely celebrated photographs.\n\nBill Viola / Michelangelo: Life Death Rebirth\n\n& Antony Gormley\n\nRoyal Academy\n\nJanuary – March & September – December\n\nA powerful production with video installations by Bill Viola alongside rare drawings by the Renaissance master, turned the Royal Academy galleries into a transcendental experience of space and time. Though risky for exploring consciousness and states of being, Bill Viola / Michelangelo charted a grand viewing experience. As pioneer of video art, Viola opposite Michelangelo wasn’t just a look into art of five centuries apart, it was a study of the fundamental concept of capturing.\n\nAntony Gormley, the follow up exhibition in the Royal Academy’s main galleries, was an equally huge production that explored the artist’s wide-ranging use of materials reflecting on scale and architecture. Alongside the rarely seen artist’s workbooks from 1977-88, other highlights included Host, made of seawater and clay, the approximately 27 tonnes of steel Cave and Matrix III, a 6 tonnes steel mesh, all 2019. The exhibition also sought to provide a platform during the week-long Extinction Rebellion protests in London. At the time of my visit a protester inside the gallery that hosted Gormley’s work Primordial… Lost Horizon I shifted the visitors’ attention towards climate concerns and air pollution with a “Fly Now Pay Later” banner.\n\nDon McCullin\n\nTate Britain\n\nFeb – May\n\nLegendary photojournalist Don McCullin was celebrated this year with a major retrospective at Tate Britain and over 250 photographs, all printed by McCullin himself in his darkroom. Visiting the exhibition was one these moments when you come opposite the brutal face of history and your body knows it. Showcasing some of McCullin’s most powerful images, which he captured in the last 60 years at home and abroad, it was a devastating record of poverty in England and a journey past brutal wars and international conflicts, and their impact on people.\n\nEmma Kunz: Visionary Drawings\n\nSerpentine\n\nMarch – May\n\nIt was the first UK solo exhibition by Swiss psychic healer and researcher of nature Emma Kunz (1892–1963), featuring over 40 of her visually astonishing drawings. Emma Kunz: Visionary Drawings was conceived with artist Christodoulos Panayiotou who has a long-term interest in Kunz’s work and produced new stone benches for visitors to use inside the gallery. Attempting to find a universal connection, Kunz predicted that her drawings were destined for the 21st century. This survey exhibition of her work with her ‘energy-field’ compositions was a timely opportunity to find healing connection with our environment.\n\nTakis\n\nTate Modern\n\nJuly – October\n\nBelated but crucially important was the first major UK retrospective of late sculptor of magnetism, sound and light, Takis (1925-2019). Over 70 wonders by an original of artistic voices – produced throughout his life using magnets, electricity and viewer participation to generate sound – were brought to light in collaboration with MACBA Museu D’Art Contemporani and the Museum of Cycladic Art.\n\nThe exhibition was a major highlight – walking along the gallery spaces felt like a magnetic field bonded by art and science. Some documents on display related to art activism were also of huge significance. We learned that in 1969, Takis removed his work from the Museum of Modern Art in New York during the exhibition “The Museum as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age” because they were exhibited without his consent. His protest led to the formation of the Art Workers’ Coalition (AWC). AWC’s initial documents were published in mid-1969 beginning with a statement from the artist:\n\nLet’s hope that our unanimous decision January 1st 1969 to remove my work from the Machine exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art will be just the first in a series of acts against the stagnant policies of art museum all over the world. Let us unite, artists with scientists, students with workers, to change these anachronistic situations into information centres for all artistic activities, and in this way create a time when art can be enjoyed freely by each individual.\n\nKara Walker: Fons Americanus\n\nTurbine Hall, Tate Modern\n\nOctober through to April 2020\n\nWith Fons Americanus, 13-metre tall fountain, acclaimed artist Kara Walker confronted oblivion through the representation of a bold historical record in this most ambitious commissions for the Tate’s Turbine Hall to date. Walker’s fountain was inspired by the Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace. Built from recyclable cork, wood and metal and using an environmentally-conscious production process Fons Americanus is a work of undebatable importance regarding the history of race, slavery and violence.\n\nKara Walker: Fons Americanus is on display until April 2020.\n\nStanley Kubrick: The Exhibition\n\nDesign Museum\n\nApril – September\n\nA unique insight into the director’s huge archive of photographs, designs and props, the Design Museum’s Stanley Kubrick exhibition was a wonderfully curated presentation of the iconic filmmaker’s relationship to Britain and his collaboration with key designers including Hardy Amies, Saul Bass, Eliot Noyes, Milena Canonero, and Ken Adam.\n\nThe exhibition was a journey through his unique lens and masterpieces such as Full Metal Jacket (1987), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Dr Strangelove (1964). Highlights included the camera lens designed for NASA to shoot by candlelight (Barry Lyndon) and the prop for Dr Strangelove’s war room.\n\nUrban Impulses: Latin American Photography from 1956 to 2016\n\nPhotographers’ Gallery\n\nJune – October\n\nFrom street documentary to collage, Urban Impulses embraced Latin American photography from 1959 to 2016 with more than 200 images. Curated in two themes, ‘Shouts’ and ‘Pop-ular’ to reflect on the past and the present, included were works by Alberto Korda, Graciela Iturbide and Sergio Larrain alongside emerging photographers such as Eduardo Longoni, Beatriz Jaramillo and Pablo Ortíz Monasterio.\n\nCurrently at the crossroads of a new public outcry over the rapid transition to a consumer society, Latin America is woven with mass social movements that fought against the struggle of disconnected democracies. Local people, and places were the heart of the exhibition and during the military dictatorships in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Paraguay photography was the weapon against silence. Later, popular culture and advertising multiplied international consumerism and placed the poor at risk. There were a lot to reflect on these photographs and a followup to Urban Impulses with works post-2016 would be a part two exhibition I’d love to see it happen.\n\nHackney’s Got Style: Celebrating the History of Impact of African and Caribbean Fashion and Hair\n\nHackney Museum\n\nOctober through to January 2020\n\nA hugely influential exhibition in the heart of east London, it celebrates African and Caribbean style and how it has impacted identity seven decades after the Windrush Generation began to arrive in 1948. Curated by Rebecca Odell and Rowena Hillel with careful research in the local area, Hackney’s Got Style showcases how black fashion and hair have influenced British culture. Highlights include the local tale of Britain’s first black millionaires – Lincoln Dyke and Dudley Dryden – who set up shop in Hackney selling records and hair equipment to fight discrimination. Without realising, they eventually gave birth to the beauty salon as a cultural haunt. Also powerful is the story behind afro hair as a symbol of pride, protest and empowerment.\n\nThere’s still plenty of time to visit Hackney’s Got Style exhibition. It runs through to 11 January 2020 and it’s entry free.\n\nThese filmmakers spoke the truth. You only have to dig out their works and 2019 already looks hopeful.\n\nBeing Blacker\n\nDir. Molly Dineen\n\nA rare portrait of black lives, Molly Dineen’s documentary follows record shop owner, renowned music producer and Brixton’s hero, Blacker Dread. Filmed with the warmth of their friendship, the starting point of Dineen’s film was Blacker’s invitation to his director friend to film his mother’s funeral. A BBC2 production, it was one of the most influential feature documentaries on TV to start the year with. Blacker opens up at a time of great personal crisis facing his first prison sentence and he reflects on his time in the UK, a 40-year experience of inequality, poverty, crime and racism that made him send his youngest child back to school in Jamaica.\n\nUnder the Wire\n\nDir. Chris Martin\n\nA powerful documentary about journalist and foreign affairs correspondent for The Sunday Times, Marie Colvin, and photographer Paul Conroy’s assignment on the frontline in the Syrian city of Homs. Based on Conroy’s book Under the Wire, Chris Martin’s film had its world premiere at Sheffield Doc/Fest 2018. It tells the tragic events during the Arab spring, during which Colvin was tragically killed and Conroy critically injured after an attack on the international media centre.\n\nMatthew Heineman’s A Private War, based on Marie Brenner’s Vanity Fair article “Marie Colvin’s Private War”, will have its UK release early next year with Rosamund Pike in the lead role.\n\nCold War\n\nDir. Pawel Pawlikowski\n\nPolish director Pawel Pawlikowski tells the story of his parents’ bonding and love in the backdrop of Cold War in 1950s Poland, Berlin, Yugoslavia and Paris. The film depicts an impossible love story in impossible times. Filmed in gorgeous black and white palette, Zula (Joanna Kulig) and Wiktor (Tomasz Kot) are separated by borders and ideologies but at the end of their long and difficult journeys, they remain drawn to their love that bonds them.\n\nEven When I Fall\n\nDirs. Kate McLarnon and Sky Neal\n\nEven When I Fall tells the incredible true story of Nepal’s first and only circus set up by survivors of human trafficking. The film’s directors Kate McLarnon and Sky Neal filmed Circus Kathmandu’s journey over 7 years, as two incredible women – survivors of child trafficking – took the bold step of bringing an unrecognised art form to the stages of Nepal.\n\nRead our Even When I Fall interview with directors Sky Neal and Kate McLarnon and producer Elhum Shakerifar\n\nWild Relatives\n\nDir. Jumana Manna\n\nJumana Manna’s Wild Relatives is an outstanding documentary about environmental disasters created by humans. In this superb work Manna calls on global justice and places the marvellous and disastrous together while highlighting our commitment towards safeguarding nature’s goods.\n\nSummer 1993\n\nDir. Carla Simón\n\nCarla Simón’s autobiographical film Summer 1993, is a powerful look into children’s psychology and their ability to cope with change and difficult circumstances. A reminiscent of Carlos Saura’s acclaimed 1976 film Cría Cuervos, Simón’s film explores the universal stories of childhood and family.\n\nRead our interview with the director Carla Simón\n\nShoplifters\n\nDir. Hirokazu Koreeda\n\nJapanese director Hirokazu Koreeda’s Shoplifters digs deep in family secrets and bonding. At first it may look like an unusual story but it’s one that resonated across full cinema houses this year for its non-judgemental stance towards diverse ways of living and survival.\n\nThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs\n\nDirs. Joel and Ethan Coen\n\nThe anthology Western from the Coen brothers that is a delightful viewing as much as a clever satire on current American politics.\n\nRoma\n\nDir. Alfonso Cuarón\n\nShot in a glorious granular black and white quality, Roma is Alfonso Curarón’s autobiographical film. Its intimacy and docu-drama of 1970s Mexico relies very much upon Yalta Aparicio’s Cleo, a servant in a middle class Mexican family of seven. It is a beautiful work and an essential viewing on the subject of female strength and a woman’s often isolated place in the world.\n\nThe Wild Pear Tree\n\nDir. Nuri Bilge Ceylan\n\nFour years after his acclaimed Winter Sleep, Turkish auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan returns with a powerful story of overcoming family drama through creativity. It’s Ceylan’s best work so far with a script so meaningful and warm that reads deep inside the power of will and love for these people who want the best for you but sadly they’re unable to support you due to society’s imposed austerity measures and the psychological turmoil that comes with it.\n\nPeterloo\n\nDir. Mike Leigh\n\nMike Leigh’s account of the criminally little known events of the Peterloo massacre in Manchester on 16 August 1819 is a tribute to democratic values. Echoing today’s global austerity policies of a political system that gives ground to a bunch of out-of-touch elite few to fool around with people’s rights, nearly 200 years ago British forces attacked a peaceful pro-democracy rally in Manchester killing 15 people. Maxine Peake and her fellow actors are superb in every single shot akin to a canvas painted in the colours of a fierce palette. Great work.\n\nThe wild card\n\nBlacKkKlansman\n\nDir. Spike Lee\n\nSpike Lee’s new work tells the true story of Ron Stallworth, an American police officer who infiltrated the ranks of the Ku Klux Klan in Colorado Springs. It is a reflection on the disturbing mindset of the 1970s organisation that echoes today’s neo-Nazis and alt-right grouping of Trump’s white nationalist era. A timely and vital work from a visionary filmmaker.\n\nThe film posters\n\nWhat to look out for in 2019\n\nIf Beale Street Could Talk\n\nDir. Barry Jenkin\n\nUK theatrical release: 8 February\n\nFollowing his best picture Oscar winner Moonlight, writer-director Barry Jenkins’s If Beale Street Could Talk is his adaptation to James Baldwin’s much-loved 1974 novel.\n\nIt’s a film with love at its root, both familial and romantic, and Jenkins fills so much of it with a radiating warmth. – Benjamin Lee, The Guardian\n\nBirds of Passage\n\nDirs. Cristina Gallego and Ciro Guerra\n\nUK theatrical release: TBC\n\nBased on true events in Bolivia from 1940 to 1960, Birds of Passage is a singular work of a universal message on capitalism. As the film quotes: “Let gold not shine brighter than our souls”. Its remarkable production, under the watchful eye of directing duo Cristina Gallego and Ciro Guerra, is divided in song chapters and reflects on humanity’s wild, prosperous and eventual catastrophic nature.\n\nHappy as Lazzaro\n\nDir. Alice Rohrwacher\n\nUK theatrical release: 15 March\n\nA satire of our world now, Alice Rohrwacher’s Happy As Lazzaro exposes today’s slavery in such an intelligent way that summarises and ridicules the negligent condition of our society. Sweet peasant Lazzaro, superbly performed by Adriano Tardiolo, is leading the story who together with his fellow actors and cinematographer Hélène Louvart shooting on lustrous 16mm camera, they lead a genre-bending gem of cinematic anarchy.\n\nPhotography and the medium of film had a dominant place in major London galleries and art museums in 2018 – a year fuelled with political uncertainty in UK due to its impending exit from the EU. Major works by a number of powerful artists of unparalleled vigour from across the globe were shown in the capital city. They were clear evidence that art can turn the light on cruel injustices.\n\nThrough these exhibitions, I recognised how art can be a powerful political tool. Founding works of documentary practice in all its forms – including film, photography, fashion and music – brought social and political change in the past.\n\nThese are the 11 art highlights of 2018. They all highlighted how artists can effect that change.\n\nDorothea Lange / Vanessa Winship: A photography double bill\n\nBarbican, 22 Jun – 2 Sep\n\nThe first UK retrospective of American photographer Dorothea Lange (1895-1965), founding figure of documentary photography, was showcased alongside 150 photographs by contemporary photographer Vanessa Winship that told the story of the fragile fabric of our society and landscape.\n\nTacita Dean: PORTRAIT\n\nNational Portrait Gallery, 5 Mar – 28 May\n\nThe first exhibition in the National Portrait Gallery’s history to be devoted to the medium of film, Tacita Dean: PORTRAIT included the artist’s (previously unseen in the UK) 16mm film-portraits with Merce Cunningham, Claes Oldenburg and Julie Mehretu as well as Cy Twombly and David Hockney alongside her superb work His Picture in Little (2017), a film in miniature featuring Stephen Dillane and Ben Whishaw.\n\nJoan Jonas\n\nTate Modern, 14 Mar – 5 Aug\n\nA pioneer of performance and video art, this was the largest exhibition of Jonas’s work held in the UK with works from the late 1960s to recent installations exploring themes of extinction and climate change and placing the viewer at the centre to navigate what felt like spaces of sensual gravity.\n\nAugust Sander: Men Without Masks\n\nHauser & Wirth London, 18 May – 28 Jul\n\nAnother rare exhibition with works by pioneering documentarian August Sander (1876-1964), Hauser & Wirth featured an extensive selection of his photographs from 1910-1931 that tell the diverse story of German society leading up to and during the Weimar Republic.\n\nFrida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up\n\nV&A, 16 Jun – 18 Nov\n\nAn extraordinary collection of personal items and clothing of the iconic Mexican artist who was inspired by nature and passion. This collection was locked away for 50 years after the artist’s death in 1964 and it was the first time that was seen outside Mexico – an inspiring presentation that brought us closer to Kahlo’s struggle with pain, fierce creativity and tense marriage to Diego Rivera.\n\nTurner Prize 2018\n\nTate Britain, 26 Sep 2018 – 6 Jan 2019\n\nHailed as the best lineup for years, Turner Prize 2018 honoured the medium of film and digital with works by Naeem Mohaiemen, Luke Willis Thompson, Forensic Architecture and Charlotte Prodger. The “most political exhibition in its history” said Tate Britain’s director Alex Farquharson and the films by all four artists addressed issues of injustice and gender identity. With Charlotte Prodger the announced prize winner earlier this month, the exhibition calls for a four-hour essential viewing to absorb and witness the fabric of truth and our place in a world laid bare.\n\nConcrete Dreams\n\nQueen Elizabeth Hall, Southbank Centre, 10-29 Apr 2018\n\nA celebration of Southbank’s history of performance featuring original plans of the building, a bathroom showcasing images from the Hayward Gallery and a time capsule performance using archive sounds and photo projections, this wonderful project giving access to a limited number of visitors at a time looked back on one of London cultural centre’s legacy through 50 years of archive material.\n\nAnother Kind of Life: Photography on the Margins\n\nBarbican Art Gallery, 28 Feb – 27 May\n\nOne of the first highlights that pretty much shaped the year in art exhibitions, this showcase of works by 20 photographers from the 1950s reflected on diverse realities and parallel complex worlds. Featured artists included Diane Arbus, Alec Soth, Mary Ellen Mark, Igor Palmins and Paz Errázuriz.\n\nYayoi Kusama: The Moving Moment When I Went to the Universe\n\nVictoria Miro, 3 Oct – 21 Dec\n\nAs she approaches her ninetieth birthday and at the height of her powers, this was Yayoi Kusama’s twelfth exhibition at Victoria Miro, London. It featured painted bronze pumpkin and flower sculptures, a large-scale Infinity Mirrored Room and her celebrated My Eternal Soul paintings exploring themes of infinity and searching for peace and love, what has always been at the heart of Kusama’s work.\n\nBass Culture 70/50\n\nAmbika P3, University of Westminster, 25 Oct – 22 Nov\n\nBass Culture Research, a three-year AHRC funded project, took over the concrete halls at Ambika P3 of the University of Westminster’s in London to feature previously unseen artwork linked to Jamaican and Jamaican-influenced music. Arguably a magnificent showcase, Bass Culture 70/50 exclusively presented a programme of events, film, UK reggae label archive photographs and celebrated the impact of the Windrush generation on British culture and identity.\n\nAndro Semeiko: Polka Dots and Curls\n\nNarrative Projects, 22 Nov 2018 – 26 Jan 2019\n\nLondon-based Georgian artist Andro Semeiko’s solo exhibition of a new series of paintings at Narrative Projects, is an engaging take on two literary icons: Georgian poet Vazha-Pshavela (1861-1915) and Welsh poet Dylan Thomas (1914-1953). Influenced by the themes of nationalism, dignity, freedom and imagery explored in their poems, Semeiko’s new work suggests a new kind of painting evoking a rhythmic quality attested to historical symbolism.\n\nOther highlights\n\nExperimenta Debate – Representation and Praxis at the BFI London Film Festival 2018\n\nThe Pursuit of Wholeness: Gregory Markopoulos at Close-UP\n\nRhythm and Poetry: The films of Margaret Tait at BFI Southbank\n\nStrange Days: Memories of the Future\n\nShape of Light: 100 Years of Photography and Abstract Art\n\nAgnès Varda season at BFI Southbank\n\nShell // the politics of being, 15th High School of Kypseli, Athens, Greece\n\nAndreas Gursky, Hayward Gallery\n\nGallery | We reveal our picks of the best films of 2016 and a new year’s resolution.\n\nFrom the shocking story of a young boy raised within the confines of four walls in Lenny Abrahamson’s survival drama Room to the rebellious spirit of five sisters from deep Anatolia in Deniz Gamze Ergüven’s powerful first feature Mustang, here are our favourite picks of independent cinema and TV from this year.\n\nScreening for the first time in London at the newly founded festival that merges new forms of documentary and art – Frames of Representation – Zhao Liang’s Behemoth is a haunting documentary about industrialisation in China and its workers. But as 2016 rolled on we were also captured by Susan Kemp’s wonderful documentary on the legacy of the work of Antonia Bird, the first British woman to direct a Hollywood movie. Kemp’s documentary Antonia Bird: From EastEnders to Hollywood for BBC Four is a celebration of her legacy and strength of making her voice heard.\n\nWhile writing on women directors, the majority of our top films from this year are directed by women with Rokhsareh Ghaem Maghami’s powerful Sonita and Sofia Exarchou’s Park being our highlights while Catherine Corsini’s beautiful romantic drama Summertime is our best lesbian film of the year.\n\nSelecting just eleven films was hard enough and we left out debuting director Hope Dickson Leach. Her film The Levelling, was a welcomed surprise in the festival circuit for its originality but Britain’s deep recession and loss of compassion is gloriously revealed in Ken Loach’s I, Daniel Blake, this year’s Palme D’Or winner at Cannes Film Festival.\n\nJim Jarmusch’s Paterson is a heartfelt and treasured work. It was a delight of cinema experience, for its sensuous performances and Tilda Swinton strolling in style around the Mediterranean isle somewhere between Sicily and Tunisia, in Luca Guadagnino’s drama A Bigger Splash, a loose remake of the 1969 Jacques Deray film La piscine.\n\nUndeniably if you’re looking for that film representing youth 2016, Sebastian Schipper’s terrific Victoria that plays out in one continuous real time, 138-minute camera shot, is a daring, adrenaline-filled drama that took us through the underbelly of Berlin with stunning performances including the marvellous Laia Costa and Frederick Lau.\n\nNew year’s resolution!\n\nMoonlight\n\nDirector Barry Jenkins\n\nIn 2017 watch out for the release of Barry Jenkin’s remarkable Moonlight, a rare piece of filmmaking focusing on its characters but with deep universal concerns and complex themes about identity, sexuality and family through exceptional performances and dialogue. It’s a rare achievement."
