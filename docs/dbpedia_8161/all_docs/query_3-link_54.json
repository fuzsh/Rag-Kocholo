Alizadeh embarked on a literary career initially as a short story writer, and cultivated his writing talents alongside the notable Iranian novelists Reza Daneshvar and Ghazaleh Alizadeh in the literary circle that developed in their hometown of Mashhad. He later came under the influence of the famous modernist poet Bijan Elahi, who selected the poems of Diary of House Arrest. Since the early 1990s, Alizadeh has focused mostly on poetry. In Alizadeh’s poems, a labyrinthine memory, structured by the intricate architecture of old Iranian bazaars and mosques, continually revises itself in spontaneous narrations of love and death.\n\nGabriella Balza\n\nGabriella Balza is a writer and current MFA candidate at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
