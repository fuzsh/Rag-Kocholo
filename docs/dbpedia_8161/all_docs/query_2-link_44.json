        "text": "Poetry of Vazha-Pshavela\n\nPrepared by Levan Abramishvili\n\nWednesday, April 24\n\nIn one of the previous issues, we introduced Vazha-Pshavela to our readers with his publicist writing Cosmopolitanism and Patriotism. Today we want to offer a few poems of the genius from the mountains of Georgia. Vazha-Pshavela was a pen-name of Luka Razikashvili, who was born in the village of Chargali in 1861. Author of numerous poems and novels he portrayed the everyday life and psychology of his contemporary Pshavs. He was also known for his exceptional and unparalleled connection with the nature. His worldview expresses itself not only in Vazha Pshavela's lyrical pieces, but also in his poems, \"The Snake-Eater\", \"The Guest and the Host\", \"Bakhtrioni\" and others.\n\nA FEAST\n\nPour me the wine of liquid flame,\n\nAnd steep my soul in rubied flow;\n\nPerhaps twill banish cares away,\n\nAnd tinge with rose this world of woe\n\nPerchance 'twill drown the pangs of life\n\nIn Bacchus' horn of nectared fire,\n\nAnd Fancy find for me a maid\n\nUpon whose bosom I'll expire.\n\nOn whirlwind's wing my steed and I\n\nWill cleave the waves of oceans wide.\n\nWe'll fly the haunts of mortal man\n\nWhere every joy of mine has died.\n\nFor death on high is sweeter far\n\nThan life upon the earth below\n\nWhich is an urn of buried hopes,\n\nFloating on a sea of woe.\n\nTHE SHEPHERD-MAID\n\nOn quiet sleep you lie, fair maid,\n\nWith curly locks that lure the eye.\n\nWhat visions, thoughts invade your dreams\n\nAs you rest here beneath the sky?\n\nWith beating heart and hurrying feet\n\nYou pass this forest every day.\n\nWoe if you meet the tiger fierce,\n\nThe wolf or bear upon your way!\n\n* * *\n\nA light worn garment hid her form.\n\nHer feet in slippers soft were clad.\n\nThe beauty of her arms on which\n\nHer head reposed nigh made me mad.\n\nA sheep-skin sack hung on her back,\n\nA shepherd's rod beside her lay.\n\nShe slumbered on and sleep brought her\n\nA short respite from toils of day.\n\nOblivious of any fear,\n\nNo troubled dreams disturbed her sleep,\n\nYet, for that angel of the woods\n\nI feared, and prayed to God to keep\n\nHer safe from every future pain.\n\nThough I, by fate, am doomed to wander\n\nWith dire misfortune all my life,\n\nGod, may Thy blessings fall upon her,\n\nFor if those eyes are closed by death,\n\nAnd no more will they brightly glow,\n\nWhat other fires can warm my heart\n\nOr on it equal joys bestow?\n\nO mounts! O trees! O flowing streams!\n\nOn ye I call in humble prayer,\n\nThis lass, the angel of my dreams,\n\nFrom pain and sorrow shield fore'er!\n\nA SOLITARY WORD\n\nI breathed a word that grief had wrought.\n\nIt winged its flight into the air,\n\nThen pierced the haunts and souls of men,\n\nAnd left its tears and laughter there.\n\nIt was a word flung from a heart\n\nThat knew but misery and tears, 혰\n\nA word that knew its lowly birth\n\nIn throes of agony and fears.\n\nThough nursed by suffering and trial,\n\nIt spread and flourished in its flight,\n\nAnd wondering I beheld it glow,\n\nAdorned in sparkling jewels bright.\n\nAnd soon upon a throne of gold\n\nIt ruled in radiance and might, 혰\n\nThe hope and faith of sunless hearts,\n\nThe darkened bosom's torch of light.\n\nI marvelled at that vision fair,\n\nThe offspring of my passion's fires;\n\nResistless was its beauty as\n\nIt filled men's souls with strange desires.\n\nI wondered much, and smiled to see\n\nHow over souls of men it reigned,\n\nHow it had sprung from misery\n\nThat birth with tears of blood had stained 혰\n\nA solitary word of woe,\n\nAbused, objected and profaned.\n\nA SONG\n\nBeyond the river dark thou art.\n\nBetween us rushing waters flow.\n\nThere is no bridge, no boat have we,\n\nNor wings to cross the river, so,\n\nI gaze upon thy smiling face\n\nAnd long to press my lips to thine,\n\nThough well I know I ne'er will hold\n\nThee in my arms, O dearest mine!\n\nNo hope relieves our hopelessness,\n\nNor lights the brooding darkening sky.\n\nDelusion makes us bitter smile\n\nThrough tears that blind the aching eye.\n\nOver the rushing waters wild\n\nMy voice takes wing and towards thee flies,\n\nBut mingling with the deafening roar\n\nIn raging depths it swoons and dies.\n\nIt's heart-corroding to behold\n\nThe years pass like the stream in sighs...\n\nTHE EAGLE\n\nIn haughty pride, though wounded sore,\n\nAn eagle fought the raven-crow.\n\nThe bird in desperation strove\n\nTo rise but fell in frenzied woe.\n\nHis right wing swept the blood-stained ground;\n\nHis bosom shone in crimson glow.\n\n\"Alas! you smite, O ravens wild,\n\nWhen I am wounded, fallen low.\n\nWere I not struck, your feathers black\n\nWould surely deck the plains below!\"\n\nDESPAIR\n\nBeneath the shade of a beech tree high\n\nIn solitude a violet grew.\n\nIt wished to woo the sunbeams gold\n\nAnd lure them to its realm of blue.\n\nThe flower in breathless eagerness\n\nWaits for the sun-rays from on high\n\nAnd gazes on the sunny world\n\nWith wistful sighs and tearful eye.\n\nThe violet longs to curtsey low\n\nAnd dance amidst the sunbeams bright,\n\nTo have its pretty head adorned\n\nWith rays of shimmering golden light.\n\nThe lovely flower droops and weeps;\n\nIt heaves a piteous, hopeless sigh,\n\nFor to this realm of shadows soft\n\nNo rays of sunlight ever fly.\n\nThe violet's heart in sorrow breaks\n\nAs on the ground it withering lies.\n\nNear by, its dying eyes behold\n\nSun-lighted flowers dance 'neath the skies.\n\nA SONG\n\nOnce there bloomed upon a meadow\n\nRoses, violets, flow'rs of grace.\n\nThe gods from urns poured nectared beauty\n\nOn the meadow's up-turned face.\n\nHanging vines and branches wove\n\nCanopies of gold and shade\n\nThrough which the sky serenely peeped\n\nAnd gentle breezes humming strayed.\n\nThe bulbul sang of only love;\n\nNature listened in delight 혰\n\nI felt joy rise in my breast;\n\nThrilled at the beauty of the sight.\n\nCaptivated by the place\n\nThe morrow found me there again...\n\nBut alas! the scene was changed\n\nAnd horror petrified my brain.\n\nThe violets and roses were\n\nLovely; though the bulbul's song\n\nWas as musical and sweet,\n\nYet my heart in pain was wrung!\n\nStunned, I saw a sight that made me\n\nWish my seeing eyes were blind...\n\nStagnant vapours and black snakes\n\nAbout the flower stems were twined.\n\nELEGY\n\nO heart, in dreams I behold thee,\n\nIn toils of despair and of pain.\n\nThy throbbings are wrung by emotions\n\nThat torture the heart and the brain.\n\nThe sun and the moon shine no longer,\n\nThe world lies in darkling and gloom,\n\nAnd my life nursed by grief and by sorrow\n\nIs shrouded in darkness and doom.\n\nThus tortured with madness of dreaming,\n\nI curse all my past and my life;\n\nAnd the heart embittered and weary\n\nWants but to be freed from the strife.\n\n'Tis torture to live in a land where\n\nThe faith of one's sires is profaned,\n\nWhere honour and justice have fallen,\n\nWhere freedom in darkness is chained.\n\nO where are the deeds of true valour\n\nOur past and our heritage claim?\n\nThou phantom of glory rise from thy\n\nGrave where is buried thy fame.\n\nO breathe in me, Georgia, the epic\n\nAnd life-giving fires of thy might!\n\nInfuse in me strength for the struggle;\n\nIn pride let my falchion gleam bright.\n\nMay the bosom that nursed me to manhood\n\nCurse and blast me fore'er if I fall.\n\nO my heart, that is aching, have courage,\n\nFight on, though in agony's thrall!\n\nTHE SWORD'S COMPLAINT\n\nRust adorns thee, sword, and mould'ring\n\nIs thy scabbard once so fine.\n\nWhere's thy master's arm of iron,\n\nWhere's that flashing gleam of thine?'\n\n\"On the fatal plain of Shamkor,\n\nHe fell dead, with many a wound,\n\nAnd his blood flowed like a torrent,\n\nDyeing red the battle ground.\n\nThough he fell beneath the struggle\n\nWith the deadly enemy,\n\nValiant were his deeds and dauntless.\n\nMatchless was his bravery\n\nForemost was he in the battle,\n\nSmiting, hewing down the foe.\n\nGeorgia and a soldier's honour\n\nMade him bear the crushing blow.\n\nA coward's hand has hung me useless\n\nHere to rust in endless night.\n\nGeorgia has become a market\n\nCursed and doomed by venal blight!\n\nI, who proudly fought for freedom,\n\nNow am pawned or sold for gold,\n\nA bartered thing to crown the downfall\n\nOf my country's pride of old.\n\nMany years have passed since\n\nGeorgia's Son did whet me till I flashed,\n\nRendered sharp my blade so deadly,\n\nAnd with me to battle dashed.\n\nNor have I heard sounds of trumpets,\n\nNor the shouts of victory...\n\nI have passed an age thus hanging\n\nHere in rust and slavery.\""
