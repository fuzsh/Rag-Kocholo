        "text": "This study was designed to assess the effect of the urotensin-2 receptor antagonist - Palosuran on blood pressure and serum electrolytes in laboratory rats with renovascular hypertension (2 kidneys + 1 clip) and determine possible changes in sodium, potassium, calcium levels.\n\nStudies have shown that Palosuran decreases mean arterial pressure in rats with renovascular hypertension. The vasodilating effect of palosuran exceeds the inhibitory effect of L-NAME on NO and the urotensin-induced endothelium-independent vasoconstrictive effect, especially in the early stages of hypertension. The antihypertensive effect of Palosuran was less manifested in case of relatively late onset of treatment. Supposedly, damaging effects of hypertension on blood vessels increase production of U-II and enhance the endothelium-independent vasoconstrictive effect of urotensin.\n\nThe results obtained showed a significant difference between hypertensive and nonhypertensive healthy rats for blood electrolytes. At the early stage of disease modeling Palosuran significantly decreased serum Na+ and increased K+ concentrations in hypertensive rats. Na+ and K+ concentrations were maintained within the normal range even after administration of L-NAME, except during the late-onset of treatment.\n\nIn conclusion, Palosuran might represent a new therapeutic option in individuals with hypertension disease at early stages of disease."
