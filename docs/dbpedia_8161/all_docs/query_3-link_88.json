He wrote music based on Georgian traditional folk music, preserving the national identity through his compositions. Taktakishvili is the author of the Anthem of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. Taktakishvili’s music legacy includes two symphonies, six operas, two violin and two cello concertos, four piano concertos, adaptations of Georgian folk songs for voice and piano, symphonic poems, oratorios, cinema and ballet music, and multiple instrumental and choral works.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nBackground\n\nOtar Taktakishvili’s life began in Tiflis (now Tbilisi), Georgia. He was born into a family of the Abkhaz nobleman Vasily Chachibai and the Georgian Princess Elizabeth Mikhailovna Taktakishvili. His father died when Otar was small, therefore he bore his mother’s surname. Otar grew up being surrounded by music. Thanks to his mother, who worked as an artist at the Georgian Opera House, as well as to his uncles, Shalva Taktakishvili (composer and professor at the Tbilisi Conservatory) and Giorgi Taktakishvili (cellist and music school director), Otar began his early piano and composition studies. All these people influenced his development. The future composer received his love for Georgian folk music from his mother.\n\nEducation\n\nAfter studying piano with different teachers as a young man, in 1942 Taktakishvili entered the Tbilisi Conservatory, where he majored in composition under Sargis Barkhudaryan and Andria Balanchivadze, and studied conducting with Alexander Gauk. While he was at the Conservatory, 22-year old Taktakishvili took part in a prestigious composition competition sponsored by the authorities for a new national anthem for the Soviet Socialist Republic of Georgia and won it. Soon Otar Taktakishvili found himself famous. In 1947 he graduated from the Tbilisi Conservatory.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1947, Taktakishvili began teaching choral literature, counterpoint, orchestration, and composition.
