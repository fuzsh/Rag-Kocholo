        "text": "For other uses, see Georgian literature (disambiguation).\n\nGeorgian literature (Georgian: ქართული ლიტერატურა) refers to a long literary heritage, with some of the oldest surviving texts in Georgian language dating back to the 5th century. A golden age of Georgian literature flourished under the unified kingdom of David IV in the 11th century. However, political fragmentation and foreign invasions following a peak in literary tradition during the reign of Queen Tamar (1184-1213 CE) led to a cultural decline.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly origins\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earliest known Georgian literary work, The Martyrdom of the Holy Shushanik by Iakob Tsurtaveli, was composed between 476 and 484 CE.[1] It belongs to the literary genre of hagiographies.[2]\n\nThe ninth and tenth centuries witnessed a flourishing of Christian theological literature, intertwined with a growing sense of Georgian national identity. This is exemplified in Praise and Glory to the Georgian Tongue by 10th-century monk Ioane-Zosime.[1]\n\nGeorgian Golden Age (11th-13th Centuries)\n\n[edit]\n\nDavid IV's unification of Georgia in the 11th century ushered in a golden age for culture. Christian literature thrived, heavily influenced by Byzantine traditions. Numerous Byzantine works were translated into Georgian, and philosophy and historical writing flourished.[1]\n\nThis era also saw the birth of secular literature, drawing inspiration from Georgian folklore as well as Persian and Arabic literary traditions.[1] Heroic epics, tales of chivalrous love, and knightly adventures became prominent, with poetry reigning as the dominant literary genre.[1]\n\nThe reign of Queen Tamar (AD 1184-1213) marked the pinnacle of medieval Georgian literature. This period witnessed a flourishing of literary production, with Shota Rustaveli's epic poem, \"The Knight in the Panther's Skin\" (Vepkhistqaosani), emerging as a masterpiece.[1] Considered one of the most significant works of Georgian literature,[3] the poem narrates the adventures of Avtandil, a knight sent by Queen Tinatin on a quest to find another mysterious knight. The story unfolds with twists, culminating in a double wedding.[1]\n\nFollowing Queen Tamar's reign, Georgia's political fragmentation and foreign invasions led to a decline in literary output.[1]\n\nResurgence (17th-18th Centuries)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 17th and 18th centuries saw a resurgence in literary activity. Kings like Teimuraz I and Archil II contributed to the field. This period produced notable works like The Book of Wisdom and Lies by Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani, alongside works by David Guramishvili and Bessarion Gabashvili. Themes of a suffering homeland and grief resonated during this era. Despite Persian oppression, Georgian authors often displayed admiration for Persian language and poetry.[1]\n\nWesternization and Romanticism (19th Century)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 19th century marked a shift towards Western influence as Georgia gradually joined the Russian Empire. Romanticism became the dominant style, with leading poets like Alexander Chavchavadze, Grigol Orbeliani, and Nikoloz Baratashvili shaping the era.[1]\n\nThe next generation saw a rise in nationalism and a growing focus on social issues. The \"Tergdaleulebi\" movement, advocating education and reform, led by Russian-educated Georgians, heavily influenced literature. Realism gained prominence, with writers like Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, Alexandre Kazbegi, and Vazha-Pshavela drawing inspiration from both Russian and Western European literature.[1]\n\n20th Century: Revolution, Repression, and Rebirth\n\n[edit]\n\nThe early 20th century witnessed a flourishing of literary styles and authors. This vibrancy continued until the Stalinist purges of the 1930s, which tragically silenced many writers unwilling to conform to socialist realism.[1]\n\nIn the early 20th century, the city of Kutaisi became an avant-garde literary hub, with the literary, symbolist group \"Blue Horns\" featuring prominent figures like Titian and Galaktion Tabidze, Paolo Iashvili, and Grigol Robakidze.[1][4]\n\nMikheil Javakhishvili, Konstantine Gamsakhurdia, and Nodar Dumbadze are considered the 20th century's most influential prose writers.[1]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Literature of Georgia: A History\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]"
