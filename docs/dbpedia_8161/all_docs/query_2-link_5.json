        "text": "(An assembled group of Khevsuris are amusing themselves by drinking and singing in honour of warriors whose deeds have made the world wonder. They sing songs of praise to the\n\naccompaniment of softly humming panduris. Sitting with them is a pale-faced, grave and dignified figure. Strange tales are told of Mindia's past)\n\nFor twelve years Mindia was held\n\nA captive by the Kajis fierce.\n\nEstranged from home, from friends and kin,\n\nHe spent his dreary days in tears.\n\nThus moments, hours, weeks and months\n\nThrough tedious seasons led him on,\n\nTied to a rope of misery\n\nFrom blasted hopes and evils spun.\n\nThoughts of his distant native land\n\nLike balm flowed o'er his maddened brain.\n\nHe shut his eyes, and lo! there glowed\n\nThe land of Khevsuri again.\n\nDim visions of her snow-capped mounts,\n\nHer winding paths and murm'ring streams,\n\nHis parents, kin and cherished friends\n\nInvaded all his thoughts and dreams.\n\nHis lowly hut now seemed to him\n\nA paradise beneath the skies...\n\nAnd as he thought and pined for home\n\nSobs burst from him, tears filled his eyes.\n\nWith time he lost all faith and hope\n\nOf ever seeing home again,\n\nAnd longed to find relief in death\n\nFrom all his miseries and pain.\n\n…..\n\nOnce o'er a blazing fire he saw\n\nA cauldron full of serpent's meat.\n\nIt was the Kajis' choicest dish\n\nWhich they with relish oft would eat.\n\nNow Mindia believed if he\n\nAte of the loathsome meat, 'twould turn\n\nTo poison in his veins and every\n\nFibre of his body burn.\n\nHe ate one piece, and sickness smote\n\nHis every nerve: a chilling sweat\n\nRan down his face, and he could scarce\n\nRepress the horror that he felt.\n\nBut suddenly it seemed to him\n\nThat from above flowed splendent light\n\nAnd spreading through his veins he felt\n\nA surging stream of strange delight.\n\nNew wisdom pierced his wond'ring brain;\n\nHe saw the world with different eyes,\n\nHe saw it smile, he heard it speak,\n\nHe knew the meaning of its sighs.\n\nAll things that breathed or lived had tongue,\n\nHeld converse soft in language strange;\n\nAnd as he learned their secret thoughts\n\nHe wondered much at all this change.\n\nThough Mindia's now sharpened eyes\n\nIn deepest hell and darkness crept,\n\nThough earth and sky and forest, mount,\n\nCommuned with him or silent wept,\n\nNo wickedness or evil thought\n\nEntered his noble heart or brain.\n\nThus skilled in Kajis' mystic art\n\nHe strove to banish every pain.\n\nAll feared his superhuman powers,\n\nHis God-like strength and piercing eyes.\n\nThe Kajis fumed and burst with rage\n\nTo see the mortal rendered wise\n\nInspired, full of life and courage,\n\nNo more did Mindia despair.\n\nHe cherished now the hope of breaking\n\nThe chains of slavery fore'er.\n\n…..\n\nSoon Mindia became renowned\n\nIn Pshav-Khevsuri; and his fame\n\n\"With time increased, and far and wide\n\nWas spread the glory of his name.\n\nTh'illustrious Queen Tamari smiled\n\nIn pride and blessed him from on high\n\nAnd said: \"Though strong the enemy,\n\nHis might will Mindia defy,\n\nAnd naught can crush Pshav-Khevsuri\n\nAs long as Mindia is alive,\n\nFor with his powers he'll overcome\n\nThe foe however hard it strive.\"\n\nHe snatched from gaping jaws of death\n\nThe wounded, sore, nigh cleft in twain,\n\nRestored to health the dire diseased,\n\nRelieved all suffering and pain.\n\nAnd Pshav-Khevsuri's soldiers brave\n\nStood ever ready for a fight.\n\nThus all praised Mindia the grave,\n\nHis wisdom and his deeds of might.\n\n…..\n\n'Twas early spring. The world awoke\n\nFrom hoary winter's sleep profound,\n\nIn fields the flow'rs breathed fragrant balm,\n\nThe hills with verdure fresh were crowned.\n\nThe scented buds with bursting smiles\n\nPeeped forth through emerald and dew.\n\nAnd Mindia with throbbing heart\n\nRoamed mount and vale 'neath heavens blue.\n\nHe loved to be with trees and flowers,\n\nWith twitt'ring birds and butterflies;\n\nAnd nature, lovely as a bride,\n\nSaluted him with joyous cries.\n\nThe flowers blushed like virgin maids\n\nAs each its heart to him unveiled,\n\nThe trees and grass with rustling swayed,\n\nAnd Mindia with gladness hailed.\n\nHe saw them tremble as they heard\n\nThe fondling breezes whisp'ring love,\n\nAnd hearkened to the birds as they\n\nDisburdened their full souls above.\n\nHe knew the longings of their hearts,\n\nTheir troubles, dreams and all their fears;\n\nTheir wish to bring relief to man\n\nMade Mindia shed happy tears.\n\nHe learned what root and herb distilled,\n\nA soothing balm, for grass and flowers\n\nBegged him to pluck them, and thus heal\n\n\"Wounds by the magic of their powers.\n\nThe songs of birds were more to him\n\nThan melody or sweetest sound;\n\nIt was the language of their hearts\n\nThat in his soul a refuge found,\n\nOft Mindia, with axe in hand,\n\nWent to the forest for some wood,\n\nBut as lie raised his axe, a voice\n\nBroke through the forest's solitude.\n\nIn cries that shook the frightened leaves\n\nHe heard the pleadings of the tree?\n\nIt brought deep anguish to his heart\n\nAnd made him suffer bitterly.\n\n\"Thou hast an axe, and strong thou art!\n\nWhy strike me down and kill me so!\"\n\nStrength ebbed from him, his slack hand fell,\n\nThe axe dropped on the ground below.\n\nHe stood bewildered as the trees\n\nAll wept and pleaded for their lives.\n\nTheir tears seemed drops of blood to him,\n\nTheir sighs cut through his soul like knives.\n\nThus Mindia went slowly home,\n\nUnhappy and with troubled heart.\n\nHe bent before the fireside low\n\nAnd raked the dying embers lest\n\nThe fire extinguish and expire,\n\nThen brought some twigs and heaps of hay\n\nTo feed the flick'ring feeble fire.\n\nHe called together all the folk.\n\n\"The trees feel joy and pain,\" said he,\n\n\"Cut them not down! Use only twigs\n\nAnd straw for fire, I beg of ye.\"\n\nIn this all thought him queer, for they\n\nSaid: \"God has made all things to be\n\nA blessing for the mortal man.\"\n\nNone hearkened to him, and the tree\n\nWas cut. And to this very day\n\nMan fells the tree and thanks the Lord.\n\n…..\n\n(It was a holiday, and the Khevsuris were gathered together. They praised Mindia's wonderful powers. But Chalkhia, wished to prove to them that Mindia was an impostor and only pretended to be superhuman. He said that Mindia differed in nothing from them; that the plants and animals were created by God for man's use, and Mindia's talk was all nonsense.\n\nMany agreed with Chalkhia. Mindia, who was sitting in their midst, paid no attention to those about him. Tears were in his eyes; no one could understand why. When asked the reason for his tears he pointed to two birds that were perched on the branch of a tree near by. One of the birds,\n\nhe said, was telling the other of the death of their little nestlings. The mother-bird was weeping. And as the Khevsuris looked up, the bird suddenly dropped down on the ground before them dead with a broken heart. All were astounded, and those who had doubted Mindia's powers now\n\nbelieved in him the more. But nevertheless, they continued to hunt and cut down trees. The enemy invaded the country many times, but thanks to Mindia victory was always on\n\nthe side of the Khevsuris. In the meantime Mindia had married. He was obliged to hunt and cut down trees in\n\norder to feed and keep his wife and children warm. And here began the tragedy of Mindia's life. He felt, as he continued in the ways of man, that lie was gradually losing his wonderful powers. Nature soon spoke to him no more.\n\nIt was early morning. From Mindia's hut could be heard the voices of Mindia and his wife Mzia. He was blaming her for all the misfortunes of his life, and in bitter words expressed\n\nhis regret at having married her. Mzia reminded him of how he had wooed and loved her. She tried in vain to make him see that she and her children were not the cause of his suffering. He then confessed that he had lost his magic powers and expressed his fear for the welfare of his\n\ncountry.)\n\nThe world was wrapt in flimsy veil\n\nAs from the sky poured sheeted rain;\n\nDown mountain sides the waters sped\n\nAnd serpent-like flowed on the plain.\n\nThe leaves received in patters soft\n\nThe hissing rainfall from the sky.\n\nEach flower beneath the raindrops shone\n\nLike Queen Tamari's sparkling eye.\n\nThe sheep like gems adorned the hills,\n\nSweet-scented was the air and bright;\n\nAnd hearts rejoiced as nature poured\n\nAbundant beauty and delight.\n\nFair is the world, yet troubles kill\n\nAll joy within the human breast.\n\nCountless the wretched, but man knows\n\nBut few, and cannot see the rest.\n\nDark forms of hurrying men were seen,\n\nFrom far resounded shouts and cries:\n\n\"Where is our leader? Seek him, quick!\n\nFind Mindia, the ever wise!\n\nThe bridge, o'er Arghun is destroyed\n\nBy the advancing enemy.\n\nWe must with courage beat them back,\n\nFrom Scythians our country free!\"\n\nKhevsuris thronged upon the field\n\nMade ready for the coming fight.\n\nIn every breast there burned a flame —\n\nLore for their country's honour bright.\n\nNow after many years of peace\n\nThe foe, athirst for combat new,\n\nHad once again besieged the land\n\nAnd Khevsuris in tumult threw.\n\nThe Pshav-Khevsuris ready stood\n\nAwaiting for the morning light.\n\nShields, swords and falchions like a sea\n\nOf flashing silver lit the night.\n\nEach knew that if the leader of\n\nThe Scythians were captive made,\n\n'Twould free the country and the world\n\nOf one who like a threatening blade\n\nWas harbinger of tears and woe.\n\nThe hero's name in every heart\n\nWould like a torch forever glow.\n\nBrave women with their children went\n\nTo towers where they in haste prepared\n\nSome food and wine in sheep-skin sacks\n\nWith anxious hearts and loving care.\n\n…..\n\nTwilight its mantle gray spread o'er\n\nThe valley, field and mountain high,\n\nFlow'rs drooped in prayer as evening strewed\n\nHer purple shadows from the sky.\n\nAragvi hummed in solitude,\n\nThe landscape faded from the sight,\n\nLoud voices rent the twilight's gloom\n\nAnd broke the stillness of the night.\n\n\"Pshav-Khevsuris, unsheathe your swords!\n\nCrush down th'usurping enemy!\n\nYour threatened country needs you now,\n\nFight valiantly for victory!\"\n\n'Twas dark. No shepherd's whistling clear\n\nWas heard to cheer the gloomy night.\n\nDark forms were seen, and things of worth\n\nWere hid away from human sight.\n\nThe sheep were led to safety, then\n\nThe folk to shelt'ring forts retired.\n\nAll wait impatient for the dawn\n\nWith faces set and hearts afire.\n\n…..\n\nOn Khakhmat's sacred altar gleamed\n\nA candle's quiv'ring feeble light,\n\nIts yellow rays embraced the trees,\n\nExpiring there in sheer delight.\n\nAt times the light gleamed brighter still\n\nAnd flung the shadows black aside,\n\nThen, like a soul in agony\n\nOf death, it flickered low and died.\n\nEnough remained of sombre light\n\nTo see two figures on the plain;\n\nOne held a blood-stained sword, and on\n\nThe ground there lay a bullock slain.\n\nBerdia\n\n\"God's blessings on thee, Mindia,\n\nUpon thy faith and sacrifice,\n\nMay He thy ardent prayers receive\n\nAnd hearken to thy endless sighs.\n\nThou art the comfort of our lives,\n\nThe Pshav-Khevsuris' faith and pride.\n\nHeaven and earth extol thy name\n\nWith hymns that echo far and wide.\n\nI wonder much, my Mindia.\n\nTo see thee here both night and day.\n\nWhat troubles thee, what hast thou done\n\nThus ceaselessly to weep and pray?\n\nTo God we owe immortal thanks,\n\nHis praise resounds beyond the skies;\n\nMay He forgive me, but thy ways\n\nExceed all bounds of sacrifice!\"\n\nMindia\n\n\"A bullock, ox, three cows have I\n\nAs offerings to our Lord on high;\n\nPerhaps He'll hearken to my prayers\n\nAnd heal the wounds that make me cry.\"\n\nBerdia\n\n\"What wounds, my man, can trouble thee,\n\nWhat pain concealed makes thee despair?\n\nThou hast the power to cure all ills\n\nWith magic herbs and cordials rare.\"\n\nMindia\n\n\"My tongue is tied, no words can ever\n\nExpress why I thus anguished groan.\n\n'Tis easier to speak of troubles\n\nEndured by others than one's own.\n\nDoes he who gold and silver hoards\n\nOpen his purse for all to see?\n\nO woe! Pshav-Klievsuri is doomed,\n\nCondemned by destiny's decree.\"\n\nBerdia\n\n''Thou art our pride, our only hope,\n\nThe idol of Khevsuri's heart.\n\nThou art the favoured son of God,\n\nSchooled in the powers of magic art.\n\nWhen man by illness is oppressed,\n\nAnd sorrow wrings his tortured soul,\n\nThy wisdom banishes his woe,\n\nThy powers restore him, make him whole.\"\n\n(Mindia knelt before the altar and with upraised hands pleaded to God to heed his\n\nprayers and bring him back to grace again.)\n\n…..\n\nDown poured the rain in hissing sheets,\n\nThe skies frowned o'er the darkened world,\n\nThe rumbling sound of loosened rocks\n\nWas from the depth of midnight hurled.\n\nThe thunder pealed, then rumbled on,\n\nThe high winds howled as if in pain,\n\nThe grass and flowers drooped low in fright,\n\nAnd shuddered 'neath the trampling rain.\n\nOn Khakhmat's rock no more was seen\n\nThe feeble gleam of candle-light.\n\nNo more did they who weeping prayed\n\nKneel there that awe-inspiring night.\n\nThe sacred altar stood unmoved\n\nAs winged fire in the heavens flashed.\n\nBelow the haughty Aragvi\n\nUpon the cliff in fury dashed.\n\n…..\n\n(Women were seen in a tower praying for the welfare, of their country and their men. Mindia's wife, Mzia, was also there. She looked troubled. She confided to Sandua (a Khevsuri woman) how Mindia had changed of late. She told her of a dream she had had):\n\n\"I saw a vision in my sleep\n\nSo turbulent and full of dread,\n\nThat ill-forebodings fill my mind\n\nAnd o'er my heart their poison spread.\n\nA furious storm raged o'er the land,\n\nBlack clouds drew down the weeping sky,\n\nThe lightning leaped from peak to peak,\n\nAnd deaf'ning thunder rolled on high.\n\nI almost screamed in fear to hear\n\nSuch groans of driving wind and rain,\n\nTo see such bursts of blinding fire,\n\nSuch tumult wild and hurricane.\n\nConfusion swelled; the sky and vale\n\nAll seemed to mingle in a maze\n\nUniting hell with earth's despair.\n\nBut suddenly in lightning's blaze\n\nThe mountain shook and overturned;\n\nThe shattered trees and rocks were whirled\n\nConvulsively into the air,\n\nThen into chasms dark were hurled.\n\nA fiercer blast the valley shook,\n\nCataracts from the skies descended;\n\nUpon the plain, with sullen roar,\n\nThe waters swelled and upwards tended.\n\nA horrid noise was heard above\n\nA roar that rent the stifling air,\n\nLamentings wild in dread of death\n\nAnd anguished cries of great despair.\n\nShields, swords and corpses floated on\n\nThe surging waters of the flood;\n\nAnd none there was to weep and mourn\n\nOver the dead with tears of blood.\n\nThe house from where I saw this hell\n\nStood safe upon a rocky place,\n\nBut soon the waters curled, and lo!\n\nThe cliff was shattered at its base\n\nAnd in one mass of wreck was swept\n\nAway upon the rushing tide.\n\nI screamed in terror as I felt\n\nMyself into the waters slide.\n\nThus caught in Satan's frenzied whirl\n\nI rent the air with cries for aid;\n\nPressing my children to my breast\n\n\"With bursting sobs to God I prayed.\n\nI tried to clutch the shore, but woe,\n\nIt spurned my clinging, trembling hand!\n\nThen o'er the faces of my babes\n\nI flung a veil to hide the land\n\nWhere features black and blood-shot eyes\n\nOf doom-wrought men I saw with fright.\n\nInto the wild insurgent stream\n\nThey pushed me back with all their might.\n\n\"Tis doom to land upon this shore!\n\nGod's will be done!' they loudly cried,\n\n'Go swiftly back before 'tis late,\n\nAnd follow thou the rushing tide!'\n\nJust then before me I beheld\n\nMindia on the waters fleet.\n\nHe turned to me and sadly smiled;\n\nThen spoke in accents low and sweet:\n\n'Forgive me if I wronged thee with\n\nMy bitter words, beloved mine.\n\nThou seest the Wheel of Fortune turn,\n\nYet do not weep for me nor pine.\n\nTend well our children, shield them from\n\nLife's bitterness and misery.'\n\nAh me! that dream forebodeth ill.\n\nFear makes me writhe in agony.\"\n\n(The Khevsuris were ready for the coming fight. They wished Mindia to lead them and did not believe him when he told them that he had lost his powers. They vowed that without his leadership they would not fight. He yielded. The place he chose for battle gave rise to apprehension and fear, but having sworn they had no way but to obey.)\n\nTwo days and nights beyond the mount\n\nThe battle raged in deadly swell.\n\nTigers with lions fiercely strove\n\nIn gaping jaws of roaring hell.\n\nAs gleams of steel flew dazzling o'er\n\nThe struggling mass upon the field,\n\nHeart-rending groans and cries were heard\n\nAbove the clash of lance and shield.\n\nWho will to death his glory yield?\n\nWho'll breathe his last upon that plain?\n\nWho'll find renown and victory there,\n\nAnd freedom for his land regain?\n\nFive Khevsuris with faces grim\n\nStole from the field without a sound.\n\nThey bore a burden o'er the mount\n\nAnd laid it gently on the ground.\n\nIt was a wounded warrior,\n\nA Khevsuri whose bleeding head\n\nWas with a kabalakhi bound,\n\nAnd o'er whose face death's pallor spread.\n\nThe Khevsuris\n\n\"Why rush into the jaws of death,\n\nAnd like a madman fight in vain?\n\nThe truly wise and prudent chief\n\nShould for his land his life retain;\n\nFor who can tell, the odds may turn,\n\nAnd we may drive them back again.\"\n\nThey turned and rushed beyond the mount\n\nWith waving swords and hearts aflame,\n\nAthirst for triumph o'er the foe\n\nWith deeds that claim immortal fame.\n\n'Tis agony to yield to death\n\nOne's vital breath and God-like clay,\n\nYet better feel the pangs of death\n\nThan one's own country to betray.\n\nLet cowards hide their trembling frames\n\nBeneath a woman's dress of shame;\n\nBut he who braves the foe will live\n\nImmortal on the page of fame.\n\nMeanwhile Mindia gnashed his teeth\n\nAs he lay there beneath the skies,\n\nFor disappointment and despair\n\nBurst forth in smothered groans and cries.\n\nHe struggled long to free his hands\n\nFrom bonds that cut into his flesh.\n\nHe longed for death upon the field\n\nOf battle, not within this mesh.\n\nWhen Mindia unloosed his hands\n\nAnd staggered to his feet again,\n\nFire raged in every wound of his\n\nAnd made him wince with awful pain.\n\nA sudden terror froze his blood,\n\nHe scarce believed his staring eyes,\n\nFor he beheld the village glow\n\nIn blazing flames that lit the skies.\n\nAghast was he to see this sight.\n\nCold sweat in drops o'erspread his brow.\n\nHope died within his inmost heart,\n\nAnd crushed he wavered 'neath the blow.\n\nHis stony eyes were past relief\n\nOf soothing 'tears'; cold anguish tied\n\nHim to the spot; his fingers still\n\nClosed on the dagger at his side;\n\nNo prayer he dared to murmur as\n\nHe looked up towards the crimson sky.\n\nA sudden flash, — then Mindia\n\nSank down without a word or sigh.\n\nHe lay upon the soft green grass;\n\nAs if in slumber he reclined;\n\nBlood flowed in streams upon the ground\n\nAnd there the grass with blood was lined.\n\nThe waning moon in sorrow gazed\n\nUpon the lifeless form below.\n\nShe cast o'er him a silver veil\n\nAnd drooped her head in silent woe.\n\nThe breeze came blowing down the steep,\n\nWith silver moonbeams gaily played,\n\nThen for a moment stopped to gaze\n\nUpon the blood-stained deadly blade.\n\nIt touched the unsheathed dagger's point,\n\nWhirled round the upturned fallen shield,\n\nThen flirted gaily with the grass\n\nAnd whistling danced across the field."
