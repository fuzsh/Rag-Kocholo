He gave Georgian professional music such a nuance that his individual composition was named “Mshvelidze’s Musical Language.” Strong national roots feed Mshvelidze’s work. Dmitry Shostakovich once pointed out – “When I hear Shalva Mshvelidze’s works, will make mountains dance! Shalva Mshvelidze mastered a wide variety of Georgian folk music and transformed it into classical music. He also contemplated the work of world composers, which is remarkable. The main idea was the introduction of intonation, which was based on Mount Pshavi’s folklore in eastern Georgia.\n\nThis is a peculiar intonation of an archaic Pshavri one-voice song with a fierce, mysterious tonality, which the composer termed “Pshauri Kilo.” Later, this kilo-melody became the basis of Mshvelidze’s compositional handwriting, and first was noticed in the choral work “Pshauri” (1934), and afterward in the symphonic transfer of the same name. The symphonic miniatures “Pshauri” (1933) and “Azar” (1933) were among the composer’s first works to fascinate the public’s attention. These works became the starting point for Mshvelidze’s work at the same time. In the symphonic work “Zviadauri,” “The mountain energy” – which the composer referred to as a symphonic poem, the synthesis of archaic and classical vocabulary took on a new level. The work’s idea is based on Vazha-poem Pshavela’s “Guest-Host,” the importance of which is a conflict with the mountain’s old customs. As a result of these works th e composer has a new perspective of the symphonic poem genre in terms of form and structure. In terms of genre, this is creation a heroic-epic canvas, that is accompanied by a philosophical-psychological interpretation. In Georgian professional music, “Zviadauri” became leading work, which brought Georgian symphonic music to popularity.\n\nThe orchestral epic miniature, which developed into first Symphony “Azar” (1943), was delivered as a trigger for the Second Symphony (1944). The composer’s intonation language was expanded in this work, and it’s artistic value was defined by its explanation and approval of the symphony principle. The 2nd Symphony is also noteworthy as the first coral genre, in Georgian professional music. This symphony formed the epic-genre symphonism as a style of music. “Samgori,” the third symphony, is one of the heroic-epic symphonies. The 4th Symphony (1968)\n\nwas the most popular of the composer’s six symphonies, and it was recognised as a stage forward in terms of structural formation, giving the impression of kilo-harmonic passage, smoothness of timber sounding! The symphonic poem Mindia is written, according to Vazha Pshavela’s poem in (1950). In this piece, Mshvelidze’s way of thinking and other elements of musical speech were revealed. The work focused on kilo-harmony, counterpoint variability, improvisational synthesis of improvisation and symphonism.\n\nFour operas have been written by Shalva Mshvelidze. “The Story of Tariel,” his first opera, is based on the poem “Vepkhistkaosni” by the great Georgian poet, Shota Rustaveli. The composer was directed by the literary source to combine folk elements from various parts of Georgia. The opera-oratorio “Story of Tariel” was first performed in 1946 at the Tbilisi State Opera and Ballet Theater. In 1961 at the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theater was performed Shalva Mshvelidze’s opera “Didostatis marjvena” , which was based on the novel of the same title by Georgian writer Konstantine Gamsakhurdia. The composer’s wish to express himself artistically driven him to write a folk musical drama. This time, the author drew attention to the opera’s theme of mountain people, their inner strength and power. According to musicology, the connection with Mussorgsy’s style is demonstated. Above mentioned Mshvelidze’s playwrights are based on the Georgian choir epic and Georgian classical opera. Mshvelidze’s vocal works are noteworthy. Wth works like as “Women of Tushi,” “Orovela,” “Shirak Oil,” and “Gakha Tsiklauri” he introduced himself to the public. “Women of Tusheti,” “Orovela,” “Shirak Oil,” and “Gakha Tsiklauri” were works for Soprano-High pitched and Pianoforte. The repertoire of Georgian singers’ are represented by “Women of Tusheti” and “Orovela”. “Orovela” is the most difficult to perform. Choral work is an important aspect in composer’s career. The style of music of these works were shaped by the Soviet era. These works are represented as Melancholic, mass, marching songs. Their value is expressed in the original synthesis of national folklore, with interesting polyphonic findings. “Khorumi” for symphony orchestra (1933, the first Georgian orchestral work based on national folk dance), symphonic image “Sunrise” (1947), oratorio “Caucasus” (1949), Indian Suite “(1955),” Polyphonic Suite “(1956), the symphonic poem” Servant and Tiger “(1962), romances, and so on, according to musicologist, researcher of composers’ works, Anton\n\nTsulukidze – Mshvelidze has left a legacy of innovative national culture which is still regarded as to be explored.\n\nMusicologist\n\nTamar Tsulukidze\n\nEnglish Language Translator\n\nTamar Kharadze"
