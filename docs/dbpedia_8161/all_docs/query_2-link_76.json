Lawrence is one of the important modern English writers, whose works, like his contemporaries’ ones, are full of intertextual layers and the author’s individual interpretations. His novel “The Plumed Serpent” (published in 1926) is one of these examples.\n\nThe article analyzes some religious symbols, like the symbolism of a serpent and a bird, the ritual meaning of the bullfight, a lake and a boatman’s symbolism given in the novel. Meanings of the above-mentioned symbols give additional hints about the journey of the main character, European Kate. The journey itself traces the process of a spiritual rebirth of the character.\n\nKeywords:\n\nreligious symbols, The Plumed Serpent, lake, boatman, rebirth\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nAna Mosashvili\n\nThe Establishment of Georgian-American Diplomatic Relations\n\nThe paper discusses the process of the dissolution of the USSR, the Georgian-American political process before the establishment of diplomatic relations, the recognition of Georgia’s independence, the U.S. State Secretary’s visit in Tbilisi and the opening of the first American embassy in South Caucasus.\n\nKeywords: Georgia, Gamsakhurdia, Shevardnadze, the USSR, the U.S.\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nAna Sakhvadze\n\nClay Unguentaria from Urbnisi\n\nThe cemetery of the 1st-3rd centuries A.D. excavated in Urbnisi in 1953-1963 is very important for the research of trade and cultural-economical relations of this period. However, most of the found materials are still unstudied.\n\nThe paper presents the typological classification of the clay unguentaria and grave complexes found in the cemetery. The unguentaria are interesting, because their shape is quite unusual for this period and has no analogues. Therefore, the date is determined according to the accompanying materials and the development of the shape of the clay vessels.\n\nKeywords: unguentarium, cemetery.\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nGiorgi Vakhtangishvili\n\nGeorgia and the reasons of the failure of post-soviet Russia’s initial integration projects\n\nThe article discusses the first integrative projects enacted by Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The disintegrating processes in the post-Soviet space and official Moscow's failed attempts of reintegration are also analyzed, which is important to clearly perceive Georgia's geopolitical reality of that period.\n\nKeywords: CIS, integration, politics, post-Soviet, Russia.\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nDiana Ter-Baghdasarova\n\nThe “Life” of Gregory the Enlightener Presented in Manuscript H404 of the National Centre of Manuscripts\n\nThe paper discusses the Georgian text of the “Life” of Gregory the Enlightener presented in Manuscript H404 of the National Centre of Manuscripts. The major novelty of our research is the fact that this text can be considered as the new unknown Georgian version of the composition. The differences between this version and other redactions are significant.\n\nKeywords: Armenian manuscript, the life of Gregory the Enlightener.\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nEter Shavreshiani\n\nThe Essence of Art and Artist in Iris Murdoch’s Novel “The Black Prince”\n\nThe main aim of this paper is to show the key essence of the art in society on the example of Murdoch’s most famous novel “The Black Prince”. This novel allows a reader to have a clear understanding of art, its role and purpose. This issue is almost very common not only in Murdoch's novels, but in her critical essays and articles as well. The paper shows the purpose of art and its function in the society. The conclusion summarizes the final view of the art by means of Iris Murdoch’s outlook and her novel “The Black Prince”.\n\nKeywords: art, isolation, love.\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nEka Narsia\n\nOn the Comprehensibility of „Guidebooks“ in the Banking Field\n\nThe paper aims to carry out the comparative analysis of German and Georgian guidebooks in the field of banking. The research is chiefly focused on the text comprehension model, because the study of instructions in the field of banking identifies certain linguistic features of a text. A text must be comprehensible for a reader in order for the latter to perform the banking transactions correctly and legally.\n\nKeywords: guidebook, instructional text, the language of a particular field.\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nTamar Alpenidze\n\nSome Ottoman Sources on One Metochion of Iviron Monastery in Melnik\n\nOttoman sources about the Iviron Monastery have not yet been the subject of academic inquiry in Georgia. Exploration of the history of Iviron of the period following the fall of Constantinople is of great importance in gaining a better understanding of the presence of Georgians, their activities, their role, as well as the property indicated in the records referring to the Monastery and, largely, for the study of its history.\n\nKeywords: Iviron, Ottoman, the Rozhen Monastery.\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nTamta Ghonghadze\n\nThe Symbolic-Allegorical Interpretation of Vazha-Pshavela's Fairy Tale - 'The Mill'\n\nA certain part of Vazha-Pshavela's prose has not been thoroughly studied. One of his works is the fairy tale “The Mill”, which has interesting attitudes towards Christianity and different aspects of the writer’s oeuvre. The paper presents the attempt of the interpretation of this fairy tale.\n\nKeywords: allegory, fairy tale “The Mill”, symbol, \"The Snake-Eater\", Vazha-Pshavela.\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nTea Gogolishvili\n\n„Robustos Viribus“ Georgians and „Effeminatus“ Greeks\n\nThe article presents the attitude of Latin historian William of Tyre to the Georgians as to the most distinguished fighters. The Archbishop of Tyre interestingly compares Latin and Byzantine soldiers and with a great respect as well as proud characterises the Iberians as brave warriors. We considered it interesting to take this issue forward and to discuss it in detail.\n\nKeywords: Byzantine, Crusaders, everyday history, Iberians, Latin East.\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nTinatin Vardidze\n\nTeaching Polysemous Words to High School Students\n\nThe paper presents an innovative method of teaching polysemous words to high school students which enables them to easily understand and memorize meanings of polysemous words and idioms. Studies in cognitive linguistics show that polysemous words form a structure of interrelated senses, which can be described and made explicit. This approach can be transferred and used in teaching the vocabulary of foreign languages.\n\nThe article also contains a plan of a lesson that serves as a guide for teachers of the English language in teaching polysemous words.\n\nKeywords: Cognitive mechanisms, polysemous nouns, semantic bridges, teaching the vocabulary\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nIrakli Khvedelidze\n\nThe Basics of Formation of Consciousness of the Experiencing Autobiographer: Emotion and Cognition (Based on “My Adventure” by Akaki Tsereteli)\n\nThe paper proves that in conditions of the absence of the verbal thought, observation of emotions in “My Adventure” is the only way of studying the consciousness of the experiencing autobiographer. The methodological basis of the paper is Alan Palmer’s concept of integrity of mentality worked out in accordance to Searle’s taxonomy.\n\nKeywords: Akaki Tsereteli, autobiography, cognition, emotion, narratology.\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nKoba Koberidze\n\nThe Late Antique Period Grave from Gudabertka\n\nThe paper deals with the Late Antique period grave discovered near Gori, on the archaeological site named Gudabertka. The grave was found in the 70s of the 20th century. It presented various grave materials as well as the ritual object - the pottery figure of the deer.

Out of the arbitrarily distinguished four groups of such lexemes, the most productive are those with negative particles ara-/ar- \"no/not\". They appeared in Old Georgian texts and gradually became more widespread in contemporary Georgian. The particles ara-/ar- \"no/not\" form antonymous pairs in the literary Georgian. They are widely used in the formation of the terminological system. These lexemes also create the peculiar nominal forms in the live Georgian speech. The analysis of these forms reveals the chief and facultative functions of particles ara-/ar- \"no/not\": the categorical negation and its actualization (emphasis). The particles ara-/ar- \"no/not\" are capable of combining these two meanings. This is especially obvious if we compare these lexemes with the nominal elements containing prefix u-, which denotes absence.\n\nKeywords: chronology, function negation, structure, the Georgian language.\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nManuchar Guntsadze\n\nThe Economic Side of the Conflict in Tskhinvali Region\n\nWhile studying the Georgian-Ossetian conflict, it is very important to draw parallels between the beginning and the last phase of the conflict. One of the important and interesting sides of the conflict is the economic factor. The study and comparative analysis will yield a significant information for the scientific analysis of the given period.\n\nKeywords: Conflict in Tskhinvali Region, Democratic Republic of Georgia.\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nMarine Mchedlishvili\n\nPolitical Neologisms in Global Politics and the Issue of their Transposition from English into Georgian\n\nThe present article aims to analyze one of the most problematic issues of the modern translation studies, the translation of neologisms.

The ideology of a country is a basis of a state. The ideology must rely of the originality as well as on the traditional and cultural values of the nation. The ideology is created by culture, education and science. For this reason, Georgian literary works did not stop even during hard times. This fact is proved by the existence of Gareja Literary School (the 18th century). One of its prominent figures was Besarion Orbelishvili.\n\nKeywords: customer, manuscript, prelate, rewriter.\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nNino Otkhvani\n\nThe Local Peculiarities of the Development of the Kura-Araxis Culture on the Example of Sakdrisi\n\nThe paper briefly describes the history of the development of metallurgy in Georgia, the social change based on the metal production in the Kura-Araxis culture, enhancement of trade relationships and the discovery of one of the most important metallurgical details - an orifice pipe – in Sakdrisi mine, as well as its parallels in South Caucasus, Anatolia and the Alps.\n\nKeywords: archeology, metallurgy, mining, Sakdrisi, the Kura-Araxis culture.\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nNino Kobalia\n\nThe Golden Beads in Pre-Antique Colchis\n\nThe paper deals with the study of beads (one category of objects of Colchian goldsmithery of the pre-Antique period), their finding, typological classification and determination of their cultural belongingness via parallels and technological characteristics.\n\nKeywords:\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nPrzemyslaw Polakiewicz\n\nInitial survey of unknown complex settlement in the valley of Chkhere river in Stepantsminda, Greater Caucasus, Sakartvelo.\n\nThe author delivers the coherent description of the encountered remains of the unknown historical settlement located atop distinctive topographical feature in vicinity to Darial Pass/Dariali Gorge.

Pinter uses the simplest vocabulary and daily themes for the dialogues. Depending on these dialogues, a reader/spectator can easily perceive how far these relationships are from the true family relations. It also should be noted that in the world, where we live today, in this reality, researching Pinter’s plays is really important.\n\nKeywords: absurd, Harold Pinter, Postmodernism, reality, unreality.\n\n\"Spekali\" #13\n\nGeorgian Studies\n\nChristine Iakobadze\n\nTennessee Williams’ “Streetcar Named Desire” - Principles of Contrastive Analysis of Translations Made by V.
