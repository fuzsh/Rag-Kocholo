        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe literary paradigm of Mickiewicz’s “Faris” is revealed in the examples of Georgian and European poetry. The philosophical idea of “Faris” is as follows, the self-sacrificing rider will ride his horse at full speed. On his way he encounters a lot of obstacles, but he never gives up. The rider joined the eternity and dissolved in it. The thought learned the essence, and finally he found his happiness. In 1828, Mickiewicz wrote “Faris”. The poem “Merani” by the Georgian romantic poet Nikoloz Baratashvili and “Pegasus” by the famous Hungarian poet Sandor Petofi were written directly under the influence of “Faris”. We can also consider “Gallop” by Sully-Prudhomme, “Blue Horse” by Vazha-Pshavela as lyrical examples created on the theme of “Faris”. We can combine the lyrical samples created on the theme of “Faris” under one title and name them the poems of “Faris’s Cycle”. We can consider poem by Goethe “To Coachman Chronos”, which he wrote in 1774, as the literary basis of “Faris” Cycle” poems. We think that such an approach to the matter is a novelty for literary studies."
