He's a musician from Tbilisi, Georgia, and is part of the Goslab artist collective together with TBA/Natalie Beridze and many more. With Unintended, Post Industrial Boys return for the first time since 2006's Trauma (MAXE 012CD), the second of two albums on Thomas Brinkmann's Max Ernst label. Unintended is an intimate and reflective collection of songs produced in a unique style -- part pop, part electronica. The album opens with \"Strange,\" and there is without question a strangeness to the Post Industrial Boys sound throughout the album. But it's a strangeness that soon becomes as familiar as an old friend with repeated listens. A title like \"It's Me\" makes it clear that the album is a very personal statement from Gogi. Most of the songs on the album were inspired by lyrics written by Gogi's wife from 2007 to 2013, making the album almost a kind of a family diary. The only song with Georgian lyrics is \"Naked,\" which takes its words from the 19th-century Georgian poet Vazha-Pshavela and features the actress and singer Mzia Arabuli, who comes from the mountain region and sings in the style of Georgian folk songs. \"Passenger\" is a tale of transit and travel; its intense use of repetitive melodies and vocoders conjures images of the monotony of everyday commuting. Other songs like \"Through,\" \"Sometimes,\" and \"Raindrops\" make clever use of an ambient backdrop that creates a trance-like mood while abstract melodies, beats, and lyrics subtly crisscross the audio field. Sinister melodies envelop \"Directions,\" creating a mysterious atmosphere. The album closes with its title-track, a sweet little ballad of gently strummed acoustic guitar and lilting piano melodies. Unintended is a perfect album for anyone into emotionally charged, inspiring left-field electronic pop, fusing the accessibility of pop melodies, lyrics, and structures with obscure and challenging sound design. In addition to their precisely crafted production, the songs on Unintended are characterized by the quaintly monotone delivery of George Dzodzuashvili's vocal performance -- all the more expressive for the fact that many words are half-spoken rather than sung. The lyrics are pensive, with a marvelous daydreamy quality, while at the same time still rooted in everyday experience. It doesn't take long for the Post Industrial Boys sound to seep into your soul, and when it does you will cherish the songs on Unintended forever.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nKK 090CD\n\nDespite the project's name, Post Industrial Boys is basically one man, George Dzodzuashvili aka Gogi.

It took over two years to collect all the snapshots and blueprints that finally assembled the Post Industrial Boys experience. This project is infused with deep drama, which sometimes sounds on the verge of fatalism and decadence, with Gogi channeling and directing the post-trauma with six different vocalists and other lyricists spread out over twenty tracks. The beginning of the Post Industrial Boys project began with the track \"Benzilina\" -- from the first solo Gogi project, recorded in the beginning of the '90s, somewhere in a Tbilisi squatted studio. This project was also probably the very beginning of the mutual playground and collaboration which later formed into the group Goslab. Post Industrial Trauma is a reflection of Gogi's collaborative spirit, embodying a collection of many different stories and dramas with one story blending into the next, creating a nice fusion. Amusing, easy-listening melodies and lyrics blend with a palpable modest sadness, creating a post traumatic carpet. This record is big on drama, like a movie based on a true story. Features songs from the likes of Thomas Brinkmann, Lou Reed (cover of \"Walk On the Wild Side\") and Kurt Vonnegut. Sophisticated and smoked out electronic crossover pop that will speak to fans of Mum, Gentle People, Saint Etienne, Farben, Stereolab. etc.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nMAXE 007CD"
