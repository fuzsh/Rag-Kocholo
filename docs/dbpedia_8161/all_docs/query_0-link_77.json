        "text": "Wow, this was an amazing book if you like being emotionally crushed by the weight of generational trauma for over 900 pages. It is a mammoth of a book. We have eight lives to follow. The book is subtitled “for Brilka” and hers is the final life, the Eighth. Eight on its side eight is the symbol of infinity and the final life is left blank for the myriad of possibilities for Brilka. The Story is narrated by her aunt, Niza, the seventh life in the tale. This is the longest book I have read in a very long while. The story covers the history of Georgia through the 20th century up to the beginning of the 2000s, through the lives of five generations in one family, focusing mainly on the women and the difficulties they encountered during a very troubling time in history. A multi generational saga like Marquez’s One Hundred Years of Solitude, a Georgian-Soviet War and Peace.\n\nThe book begins with a chocolate maker, who has a secret recipe for hot chocolate, the chocolate entrances the consumer but brings with it a curse to those who partake. The first life we follow is Stasia, the chocolate maker’s third daughter, who falls for a lieutenant of the White Guard at the beginning of the 20th century. But like many of the romances in the book, this will not be an easy relationship as the Russian Revolution erupts and the couple are separated, a pattern oft repeated in the different generations.\n\nSome of the principal players in the Soviet Era: Stalin , Beria and Khrushchev are not named explicitly in the book, Stalin is the Generalissimus, Beria is the Little Big Man and Khruschev, the Ukrainian Peasant.\n\nThis is a long book. I found the first four lives to be more engaging than 5 and 6 (Elene and Daria). There is a lot of heartache, as you can imagine, even when the Soviet period came to an end; the 1990s were a tough time in Georgia.\n\nNino Haratischvili has weaved a rich tapestry with the various threads of this story, it took me three weeks to get through, which is quick for me with a book of such length.\n\nMy rating : 5 out of 5\n\n“The unexamined life is not worth living” Socrates\n\nI moved to Georgia in September 2009, the year after their short war with Russia. Every September, I reflect on my living in Georgia, the country not the US state (it needs qualifying every time). I am often asked if I like Georgia. Well, my answer is “Yes and no”. Everywhere I have lived (England, Wales, Australia, France and Georgia) has had positive and negative aspects. Some things I like, and some I don’t (as with any country, I’m sure there will be the inevitable few, who will repeat the tired old chestnut “if you don’t like it go back to where you came from!“). On balance I’d say I’m very happy here and have no plans to move. This is my own very personal viewpoint, I realise others will have different likes and dislikes, particularly with regards to the Khachapuri (cheese-bread)! I have also lived exclusively in the capital, Tbilisi, which I appreciate is very different to living in a Georgian village.\n\nCoronavirus\n\n2020, has been a very unusual year because of Coronavirus. The figures for Georgia currently look very good compared to her neighbours. Up to the 1st September, Georgia had seen 1,487 cases and witnessed 19 deaths. Armenia, by contrast has seen 43,781 cases and sadly 879 deaths and Azerbaijan had 36,435 cases and 534 deaths. The Pandemic is far from over but I’m glad I am living in Georgia at this difficult time. (Update 26 September: sadly the number of cases in Georgia shot up in September now there are 4,664 cases and 27 deaths reported).\n\n“The main difference between us (Georgia) and other countries of the region is the isolation measures that we have taken. Compared to other countries, Georgia acted earlier and ‘more aggressively.’ This has led to a relatively low number of infections and, consequently, to fewer deaths,” said Vakhtang Kaloyan.\n\nUpdate: since writing this the cases of coronavirus in Georgia have sadly risen dramatically.\n\nLight\n\nI love the fantastic light. Lots of clear sunny days make for good photos. Coming from England, where sunny days are rarer, this is a great blessing.\n\nMountains\n\nThe mountains are spectacular, some are higher than any in the Alps (Mont Blanc is 4810m, Mount Shkhara in Svaneti is 5193m). As a draw-card, I think this is what would really attract tourists to Georgia.\n\nIn Gomismta, a mountain resort in Western Georgia, you can look down on the clouds : Above the Clouds at Gomismta\n\nWomen\n\nI might get into trouble for the next observation; but I find Georgian women are very pleasing on the eye, strangely many Georgian men seem to fantasize about Ukrainian women. I have been married to a wonderful Georgian woman for many years now.\n\nGeorgian Cuisine\n\nGeorgians rave about their cuisine, one list places Georgian Cuisine as 4th out of 48 European Cuisines ranked behind only Italy, France and Spain. This may be sacrilegious to state but I am not so impressed and miss English roast dinners and puddings (UK cuisine was ranked 13th) . I don’t really like khachapuri, their signature dish, a cheese filled pastry, I find it too salty. I do like khinkali and churchkhela. Georgian meals are important events and most birthdays and holidays are marked with a feast or “supra”. Georgians are also proud of their wine and claim to have been the nation which invented wine back in the mists of time, some 8000 years ago, a claim for which there is substantial archaeological support in the region. Georgian Wine\n\nThe Georgian Language (დედა ენა)\n\nThe language is a real nightmare for me, using a different and unique alphabet and having long words with tricky consonant clusters. I lived in France for six years and can get by reasonably well in French, but Georgian is a different story. I explore this in a separate blog : The Georgian Language is one of the most Difficult to Learn detailing my travails with the language. Maybe it is just my brain isn’t as malleable as it once was.\n\nRubbish\n\nOne thing that saddens me is despite the Georgians singing so much that they are proud of their country, so many of them litter with abandon.\n\nCars\n\nI’m crazy about cars, though strangely I don’t drive here (see traffic later in the post). I love seeing the old Soviet cars around.\n\nWork\n\nAs a native English speaking teacher with many years experience teaching English, I can find plenty of students here, many people want to learn English and there are not a lot of native English speakers with whom I need to compete. I have taught English since 1994, first in France, then England and now Georgia. The cost of living is relatively cheap, particularly public transport and accommodation, which are much cheaper in Tbilisi than in London, but wages are also much lower. During these Covid-19 times I have moved most of my lessons onto Zoom.\n\nSafety\n\nTbilisi feels a safe city, I have had no troubles, apparently it hasn’t always been like this, in the 1990s there was a lot of street crime. Walking around late at night in an English city on a Friday or Saturday night is far more intimidating than walking around Tbilisi at night.\n\nPublic Transport\n\nThe public transport, though cheap can be very overcrowded. The newer buses are better with air conditioning and less pollution. There are just two metro lines. Masks are required but not everyone wears them correctly.\n\nTraffic\n\nThe traffic is scary at times, the drivers have little respect for pedestrians and won’t necessarily stop just because you are on a pedestrian crossing. When asked by Georgians what I don’t like I usually say “the traffic !” and they nod in agreement, though apparently it is even worse in Iran.\n\nAnother gripe I have with the traffic, is seeing far too many drivers using their mobile phones with seeming impunity.\n\nReligion\n\nReligion is important here, despite the Bolsheviks trying to stamp out religion in the past, there are many new churches and most Georgians identify themselves as Orthodox Christians. I have been baptised into the Orthodox church but I find their intolerance of other denominations rather un-Christian, I feel I maybe losing my religion. For example: Georgian Orthodox church takes aim at Armenian Church. My wife is quite devout and prays twice a day, every day.\n\nSmoking\n\nSmoking is very common here, it is cheap compared to Western Europe and many smokers seem oblivious to those around them, it pains me to see people smoking around children. Smoking has recently been banned in public buildings which is good, although it often means smokers congregating around the exit, puffing away.\n\nSo there you have it, my personal pros and cons of living in Georgia. I’ve been here 11 years now, so I think on balance the positive aspects of living here far outweigh the negative.\n\nSometimes we need to return to nature to recharge.\n\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic has severely curtailed my travels this year, I made a trip to Lagodekhi and the Ninoskhevi Waterfall in June in the far East of Georgia, and this past weekend, I went to the far West of Georgia with Adrenaline hiking club. Our first destination was Gomis mta (mta = mountain), a mountainous resort in the West of Georgia. We would be camping here, there is no electricity or running water in the resort, inhabitants take water from the nearby mountain’s springs. Despite its limitations, Gomis mta is often called a ‘small heaven on earth’ by many locals because of its surroundings above the clouds.\n\nLooking down on the clouds is strange, like being in a plane. Here is a short video clip.\n\nGomis mta at 2100 metres above sea level is characterized by its jaw-dropping panoramic views of mountains covered with pine forests. The location provided the backdrop for many a Kodak Instagram moment, some brought balloons as props, others coloured smoke flares.\n\nThe route was long and we had got up at 5 am, so I was very tired by the time we reached Gomis mta. The camping and smell of woodsmoke reminded me of camping with the scouts, 40 years ago (how time flies!). As with all Adrenaline trips there was plenty of food, on this trip a special chakapuli was made seasoned with tkemali (a kind of sour plum Georgians love), tarragon and half a litre of wine.\n\nThe temperature dropped as the sun fell in the sky.\n\nThe following day we were up early again, this time to witness the sunrise before descending the mountain to Kobuleti for a dip in the Black Sea. I really miss the sea, this was the first time I’d been in the sea since A Trip to Cyprus back in 2018. As a child, I remember the tremendous excitement on family holidays when we would finally see the sea as we neared our holiday destination. Coming from the biggest island in Europe, I was never far from the sea growing up. I also attended university by the sea in Aberystwyth. Now, living in Tbilisi, the sea is 300 km away, “Tbilisi Sea” doesn’t count being just a large reservoir.\n\nNECESITO del mar porque me enseña:\n\nno sé si aprendo música o conciencia:\n\nno sé si es ola sola o ser profundo\n\no sólo ronca voz o deslumbrante\n\nsuposición de peces y navios.\n\nEl hecho es que hasta cuando estoy dormido\n\nde algún modo magnético circulo\n\nen la universidad del oleaje.\n\nPablo Neruda\n\nAfter a swim and a copious lunch, we joined a long traffic jam to get to the newly opened Shekvetili Dendrological Park, spread over 60 hectares it unites thousands of species of local and foreign exotic flora. The Dendrological Park is financed by former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, the richest man in Georgia, who has a passion for collecting trees. Thousands of different exotic trees have been imported to Georgia from five continents over the past years. Entrance was free and mask wearers were few.\n\nAn artificial lake is located in the centre of the park.\n\nIn addition to trees, there are pink flamingos, pelicans, storks and over 50 species of birds.\n\nWe rushed around too quickly in the heat, I would have liked to have taken more time. Then it was back into the minibus and that long journey back to Tbilisi. I returned sunburnt and tired.\n\nI hadn’t been out of Tbilisi this year, until yesterday (21 June 2020). The last trip I can remember was visiting Svaneti last Summer (A Trip to Svaneti….been there got the fridge magnet!). It was good to get out of the city and back into nature. Because of the COVID-19 restrictions instead of taking a marshutka (mini bus), where our numbers would have been limited to 10 and we’d have had to wear masks until we reached our destination, we went in a convoy of private cars. We were with the Adrenaline Hiking Club led by Giorgi Papelishvili. Lagodekhi is in the far east of Georgia very close to the borders with Azerbaijan and Dagestan.\n\nOur plan was to hike from the Gurgeniani entrance of the Lagodekhi Park to the Ninoskhevi waterfall.\n\nThe whole hike to the waterfall and back takes 4 to 6 hours, and it depends on the conditions of the trail. It took us around 2.5 hours to get to Ninoskhevi Waterfall because the trail wasn’t in perfect condition. There was only a few wooden bridges across the river at the beginning and later we had to cross the river on our own several times – luckily Giorgi was there to help.\n\nThe hike to Ninoskhevi Waterfall (also known as Gurgeniani Waterfall or the Big Waterfall) is a highlight of Lagodekhi Park. The waterfall itself is really beautiful, and the hike to get there is very pleasant.\n\nThe trail travels alongside the river through very green verdant forest.\n\nThe hike was at points challenging for me, at 55, I was probably the oldest in the group and having spent three months in COVID-19 Lockdown, I wasn’t in great physical condition.\n\nAt times we had to remove our shoes and wade through the (quite strong) river, or hoist ourselves over some large boulders which required a fair amount of upper body strength.\n\nHiking boots are definitely not needed, but good running shoes are recommended to help you keep your balance while scrambling over rocks, and to help support your feet as you will be walking quite a bit over the rocky banks of the river. The Georgian Travel Guide says: “the path to the waterfall is not so easy for inexperienced hikers. On the way you may have to cross the river several times. You will also often have to walk on wet boulders and stones, so it is advisable to use flexible, sporty shoes.”* It took us about 2.5 hours to get to the waterfall walking at a gentle pace, about 2 hours to get back. The waterfall is 40 meters high and very scenic.\n\nIt is important to pay attention to the trail markers, especially on the way back as it can be tricky to spot the actual trail in sections. Adrenaline Hiking Club trips always finish with a supra (Georgian feast), and far too plentiful food.\n\n*Georgian Travel Guide: Ninoskhevi Waterfall\n\nI moved to Georgia in September 2009, the year after their short war with Russia.

I explore this in a separate blog : The Georgian Language is one of the most Difficult to Learn detailing my travails with the language. Maybe it is just my brain isn’t as malleable as it once was.\n\nRubbish\n\nOne thing that saddens me is despite the Georgians singing so much that they are proud of their country, so many of them litter with abandon.\n\nCars\n\nI’m crazy about cars, though strangely I don’t drive here (see traffic later in the post). I love seeing the old Soviet cars around.\n\nWork\n\nAs a native English speaking teacher with many years experience teaching English, I can find plenty of students here, many people want to learn English and there are not a lot of native English speakers with whom I need to compete. I have taught English since 1994, first in France, then England and now Georgia. The cost of living is relatively cheap, particularly public transport and accommodation, which are much cheaper in Tbilisi than in London, but wages are also much lower.\n\nSafety\n\nTbilisi feels a safe city, I have had no troubles, apparently it hasn’t always been like this, in the 1990s there was a lot of street crime. Walking around late at night in an English city on a Friday or Saturday night is more intimidating than walking around Tbilisi at night.\n\nPublic Transport\n\nThe public transport, though cheap can be very overcrowded. The newer buses are better with air conditioning and less pollution. There are just two metro lines.\n\nTraffic\n\nThe traffic is scary at times, the drivers have little respect for pedestrians and won’t necessarily stop just because you are on a pedestrian crossing. When asked by Georgians what I don’t like I usually say “the traffic !” and they nod in agreement, though apparently it is even worse in Iran.\n\nAnother gripe I have with the traffic, is seeing far too many drivers using their mobile phones with seeming impunity.\n\nReligion\n\nReligion is important here, despite the Bolsheviks trying to stamp out religion in the past, there are many new churches and most Georgians identify themselves as Orthodox Christians. I have been baptised into the Orthodox church but I find their intolerance of other denominations rather un-Christian, I feel I maybe losing my religion. For example: Georgian Orthodox church takes aim at Armenian Church. My wife is quite devout and prays twice a day, every day.\n\nSmoking\n\nSmoking is very common here, it is cheap compared to Western Europe and many smokers seem oblivious to those around them, it pains me to see people smoking around children. Smoking has recently been banned in public buildings which is good, although it often means smokers congregating around the exit, puffing away.\n\nThe 1966 Italian epic Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone was entitled “The Good, The Bad and The Ugly“…. for ugly, we have in Tbilisi the Biltmore Hotel.\n\nZufa Jafaridze commented: “The ugliest building right in the center of Tbilisi, where it shouldn’t be, ruining the view and the beauty of the city, but wait, it gets even worse at night when the giant ad monitor flashes into your eyes when you go outside, it never should have been built there and I hope it will be removed.”\n\nI couldn’t have said it better myself."
