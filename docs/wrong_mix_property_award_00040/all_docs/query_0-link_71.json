With a suite of six double-sided black and white photographic plates, and a frontispiece portrait of Oswald Avery. With an autograph letter in blue ink from Nobel Prize-winning scientist Max Perutz (1914-2002) loose to preliminaries. Dated 30th November 1980 and addressed to Hodgkin's wife Marni, it thanks her and Alan for their recent hospitality, and recommends the book as fine remembrance of times past. Publisher's blue cloth with silver titles to spine and grey endpapers. With the blue dust-jacket, priced at $14.50. Perutz's blue ink ownership to fly-leaf. Top 1/4 of letter heavily toned. All books are very good first editions, showing light to moderate handling and lacking jackets (except where stated otherwise). The dissertation is housed in a contemporary back ring binder in poor condition, with the spine and lower board almost detached. The leaves themselves are a little toned and handled to edges, but otherwise undamaged. This collection of books and papers, many with Hodgkin's ownership and warm inscriptions from the authors, constitutes a significant selection from his personal working library, which was evidently disbursed after his death, along with his Nobel Prize, which was notably sold for $795,500 in 2015. Alan Lloyd Hodgkin inherited a strong work ethic from his Quaker parents, who suffered abuse for their pacifist stance during the First World War. He did well, both at Gresham's School in Norfolk (a prize book from his school years is included here), and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won a scholarship and later a research Fellowship. Particularly significant books include those by A.V. Hill (1886-1977) and E.D. Adrian (1889-1977), Nobel Prize-winning Cambridge dons of the previous generation; by John Eccles (1903-1997), with whom he shared the 1963 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine; and a retrospective volume on the life of Neuroscientist Keith Lucas (1879-1916), who had known Hodgkin's father George (1880-1918) at Cambridge. Hodgkin's research Fellowship dissertation on the electrical transmission of nerve impulses is by far the most important item here, being a unique typescript copy showing the wear of a lifetime of constant use to the ring binder. A.V. Hill sat on the panel which granted Hodgkin the Fellowship at the remarkably young age of 22, and immediately sent a copy of the dissertation on to Herbert Gasser, President of the Rockefeller Institute, who then invited Hodgkin to study at the institute in 1937. This early work was pivotal to the development of his later research with Andrew Huxley (1917-2012), in which they established how nerve impulses are exchanged between cells, leading to a joint Nobel Prize. Of great interest also is a personal notebook from the end of his career, stuffed with personal notes and \"back of a fag packet\" calculations. The bound collection of off-prints is not unique, with a more complete collection recently sold by Christie's, and further odd volumes currently available, but it is certainly rare. Taken together this collection, which includes a copy of the book containing Hodgkin's 1963 Nobel lecture, and a very rare volume on family history compiled partly by his grandfather Thomas (1831-1913), constitutes an important personal archive which should be of interest to scholars.
