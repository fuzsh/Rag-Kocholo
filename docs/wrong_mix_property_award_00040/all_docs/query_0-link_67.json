Il était capable d'effectuer la recherche dans le Fusilier marin de Trou de Bois des Laboratoires Biologiques pendant l'été et l'automne de 1941 et à l'Université de Rochester, New York, entre 1942-1945 comme un Associé de Recherche Senior - il était pendant cette période que l'on lui a attribué le Prix Nobel 1943 contre la Physiologie ou la Médecine - et à l'Institut de Rockefeller pour la Recherche Médicale en 1945 comme un Membre d'Associé. Pendant son absence, Barrage a été nommé le Professeur de Biochimie à l'Institut Polytechnique, Copenhague, en 1941, quoique la désignation de sa Chaise à l'Institut Polytechnique ait été changée au Professeur de Biochimie et la Nutrition en 1950.Main Page Recent changes Edit this page Page history Special pages Set my user preferences My watchlist Recently updated pages Upload image files Image list Registered users Site statistics Random article Orphaned articles Orphaned images Popular articles Most wanted articles Short articles Long articles Newly created articles Interlanguage links All pages by title Blocked IP addresses Maintenance page External book sources Printable version Talk\n\nLog in Help\n\nHenrik Carl Peter Dam\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Feb. 21, 1895, Copenhagen, Den.d. April 1976, Copenhagen), Danish biochemist who, with Edward A. Doisy , was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1943 for research into antihemorrhagic substances and the discovery of vitamin K (1939). Dam, a graduate of the Polytechnic Institute of Copenhagen (1920), taught in the School of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine there and later at the Physiological Laboratory of the University of Copenhagen. He went to the United States in 1940, lecturing and continuing his research, mainly at the University of Rochester, N.Y. In 1946 he returned to the Polytechnic Institute. Dam and his associates demonstrated (1929-34) a deficiency disease of chicks characterized by a tendency to bleed and an increased blood-clotting time. He ascribed the disease to lack of an antihemorrhagic vitamin, which he later showed to be fat-soluble and present in green leaves. He named it vitamin K (Koagulations-Vitamin). In 1939 both he and Doisy, working independently, isolated the vitamin from alfalfa.Year Article Country* Achievement Behring, Emil von Germany work on serum therapy Ross, Sir Ronald U.K. discovery of how malaria enters an organism Finsen, Niels Ryberg Denmark treatment of skin diseases with light Pavlov, Ivan Petrovich Russia work on the physiology of digestion Koch, Robert Germany tuberculosis research Golgi, Camillo Italy work on the structure of the nervous system Spain work on the structure of the nervous system Laveran, Alphonse France discovery of the role of protozoa in diseases Ehrlich, Paul Germany work on immunity Russia work on immunity Kocher, Emil Theodor Switzerland physiology, pathology, and surgery of the thyroid gland Kossel, Albrecht Germany researches in cellular chemistry Gullstrand, Allvar Sweden work on dioptrics of the eye Carrel, Alexis France work on vascular suture; transplantation of organs Richet, Charles France work on anaphylaxis Austria-Hungary work on vestibular apparatus Bordet, Jules Belgium work on immunity factors in blood serum Krogh, August Denmark discovery of capillary motor-regulating mechanism Hill, A.V.HOME Internet Access Broadband Easter ...
