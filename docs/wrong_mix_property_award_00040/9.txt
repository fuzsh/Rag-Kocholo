Herbert Spencer Gasser (5 July 1888 – 11 May 1963) was a prominent American physiologist. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Early Life And Education

Herbert Spencer Gasser, an eminent American physiologist and Nobel laureate, was born on July 5, 1888, in Platteville, Wisconsin. He was the son of Herman Gasser, a physician originally from Austria, and Jane Elisabeth Griswold Gasser, who had New England Yankee and German Russian ancestry. Gasser’s early education took place at the State Normal School in Platteville. He then pursued higher education at the University of Wisconsin, where he completed his undergraduate studies in zoology in just two years, graduating with an A.B. in 1910 and an A.M. in 1911. His academic journey continued at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he earned his medical degree in 1915. Gasser’s formative years were marked by a rigorous educational path and a familial environment steeped in medical practice, which undoubtedly influenced his future scientific endeavors.

Career And Achievements

Herbert Spencer Gasser illustrious career is marked by his collaboration with Joseph Erlanger at Washington University in St. Louis, which led to their joint receipt of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1944. This prestigious award recognized their pioneering work on action potentials in nerve fibers, a foundational study in neurophysiology. Gasser’s academic journey began at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and continued at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. His expertise in physiology earned him positions at Cornell University and the Rockefeller Institute, where he served as the director from 1935 to 1953. His tenure at Rockefeller Institute was distinguished by his election to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Gasser’s legacy extends beyond his Nobel Prize; he was a Foreign Member of the Royal Society and held honorary doctorates from several prestigious universities. His work has had a lasting impact on medical education and research, inspiring generations of physiologists.

Notable Events And Milestones

Herbert Spencer Gasser saw him graduate with an A.B. in 1910 and an A.M. in 1911 from the University of Wisconsin. Gasser’s collaboration with Joseph Erlanger at Washington University in St. Louis was a defining period in his career, leading to groundbreaking discoveries on action potentials in nerve fibers. This collaboration earned them the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1944.

Gasser’s contributions extended beyond his Nobel-winning research. During World War I, he applied his expertise in human physiology to the Chemical Warfare Service, enhancing the understanding of chemical warfare’s effects on the body. His tenure as a professor of pharmacology and later physiology at Washington University saw him become a central figure in medical education and research. In 1931, Gasser’s career took a significant turn when he moved to New York City to become a professor of physiology at Cornell Medical College. Four years later, he succeeded Simon Flexner as the director of the Rockefeller Institute, a position he held until 1953, shaping the institute into a leading research establishment. Gasser’s impact on society and culture is profound. His work on nerve fiber conductivity rates has provided insights into the mechanisms of pain and reflex action, influencing not only neurophysiology but also the development of medical diagnostics and treatments for nervous disorders. As a member of prestigious societies such as the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, Gasser played a vital role in the scientific community, promoting research and education that have had lasting effects on health and medicine.
