        "text": "NetworkTigers discusses SonicWall firewall gen (or generation) terminology used for SonicWall firewalls.\n\nSonicWall uses the term “generation,” often shortened to “gen,” to indicate different product lines or series of their firewalls. Each generation features a new iteration or advancement in technology, hardware, and features. SonicWall Firewall generations are often characterized by improvements in performance, security capabilities and overall functionality. Each generation of SonicWall firewalls may include multiple models with different specifications and capabilities to cater to different business needs and network sizes.\n\nWhat gen is your SonicWall firewall?\n\nUsually, the generation is indicated by the major number in the firmware number. For example:\n\nGen 7\n\nT270\n\nT370\n\nT470\n\nT670\n\nSee SonicWall’s handy description of its generation numbers to determine exactly which model you have and review why you might want to choose SonicWall firewalls if you are in the market for replacement hardware.\n\nThe newest generation of SonicWall firewalls typically includes the latest hardware components, enhanced security features, and updated software to address emerging threats.

For example, Cisco may release different versions of its networking equipment, each representing an updated set of features and improvements.\n\nSeries.

For instance, HP may have different series of laptops, such as the EliteBook series and the Pavilion series.\n\nEdition.

Microsoft releases different editions of its Windows operating system, such as Windows 10 Home Edition and Windows 10 Pro Edition.\n\nModel. The term “model” is frequently used to distinguish variants of a product with different specifications. Apple releases different iPhone models with varying features and capabilities.\n\nRelease. Often used to describe a new version of a product or software. In the software industry, developers release new versions of applications. Adobe, for example, releases new versions of its Creative Cloud software suite.\n\nIteration. This may describe a new version or cycle of a product with an emphasis on the evolution of the product. Computer manufacturers may introduce new iterations of laptops with updated components and features.\n\nThese terms, generation included, are not mutually exclusive, and companies may use a combination of them depending on the context and nature of the product. It’s essential to review the specific terminology used by each company to understand their product release cycles and updates.\n\nConsidering a SonicWall firewall?\n\nSpecific features and improvements associated with each SonicWall firewall generation may vary, so it is important to refer to SonicWall’s product specifications to understand the details of a particular generation.
