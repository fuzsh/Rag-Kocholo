        "text": "It looks like I may be in the market for a new firewall. I have heard good things about both Sonicwall and Barracuda therefore making the decision a bit tougher.\n\nTherefore, I am reaching out for some personal stories, good or bad on both devices. If you are using either one of these devices, why did you choose it, what features do you see as positive and what features, (or lack of) do you consider a negative? Did it live up to your expectations and how do you rate their “technical support” team?\n\nAll opinions would be appreciated.\n\nI have a Barracuda Spam Firewall v300 virtual appliance, it works well, but there isn’t much feature overlap with the TZ200. The TZ200 is going to be a bottleneck on a lot of business grade internet connections. Maybe you meant the Barracuda UTM of some similar size?\n\nThe Barracuda UTM is somewhat oddly positioned as it doesn’t scan email (???). A buddy of mine just got zapped when both his UTM and Spam Firewall missed a new Word based variant of the Crypto clan. The AV scanner is ClamAV and it just happened to not have an updated signature for this one file.\n\nI’m using a Sophos physical appliance, the SG330, and while it is a router/firewall/content filter/application control, it also has a full set of email scanning features. At this point I’m only using the POP3 retriever, which is very clever, for a few internal clients using their old business email. The spam and virus scanning seems quite good. My comfort and experience level mean I’m still using my Barracuda for primary service,\n\nI am a sonicwall partner but have recently implemented Barracuda firewalls for a project that is connecting to Azure (barracuda have an azure appliance) - Barracuda support is good but their firewalls are outrageously expensive & HA options are a joke - basically just double everything including the licences because they don’t know how to implement HA properly & the firewall is essentially a linux VM running on the appliance.\n\nSonicwall are excellent value and really good for virus protection, application layer firewall, bandwidth management & QoS but are poor on AD integration & reporting. We also use Sophos UTM which am finding to be great as UTM + ad integration and reporting as well as having options for email encryption.\n\nIt is important to have HTTPS scanning available on the firewall - sonicwall and sophos do this - and sophos upcoming copernicus OS will have sandboxing and integration with endpoint security.\n\nSo, I would recommend to avoid barracuda and depending on requirements eval sonicwall & sophos SG.\n\nThe quality of Sonicwall’s support has plummeted since they were acquired by Dell. We can speculate on the reasons for this, but from (some very painful) firsthand experience I can tell you that it is almost useless.\n\nYou seem to be shopping for a UTM rather than a firewall. Sophos and Watchguard are well regarded here. You should add those to your list for consideration.\n\nI know, huh? From the email he forwarded me:\n\nyour case was escalated to the Austrian Support Team in Innsbruck.\n\nSorry\n\nfor the delay, but we had to check your configuration at first and we are in\n\nanother timezone…\n\nHowever, I checked you configuration and I must say\n\nthat the NG was working perfect/correct:\n\nThe Application Control 2.0 in\n\nNG Version 6.0.1/6.0.2/6.1.0/6.1.1 can only scan for virus for http/https\n\ntraffic (via port 80/443).\n\nhttps://techlib.barracuda.com/NG61/AppCtrlConfigVirscan\n\nSMTP\n\ntraffic won’t be scanned in the firewall for virus etc…\n\n(There is\n\nalready a future plan to support virus scanning in the firewall engine for SMTP\n\nand FTP traffic - but this is not realized yet)\n\nBut you can use the old\n\nfashioned way to scan mails for virus - using a mailgateway-server service on\n\nthe NG:\n\nhttps://techlib.barracuda.com/NG61/MailGWAVIntegration\n\nPlease\n\nlet us know, if you have further questions about and or you need help to\n\nconfigure the mailgateway-service.\n\nMy friend is pretty pissed off since his old Kerio gateway would hammer 90% of the email viruses before they got to his Exchange AV system. Disappointing.\n\nI agree with the posts above, that you should add Sophos to your list for consideration. I have been using the UTM 9.x software on a Dell Optiplex 780 SFF, with an Intel dual port Gb NIC installed. I am a consultant that operates out of my home and have been using the Sophos for about a year now and have nothing but good things to say about it. I have literally had no problems with it. I find the configuration interface intuitive and easy to use, yet very powerful. I also found AD integration to be seemless, with the exception that it can not use AD authentication for remote VPN connections using IPsec, L2TP, or PPTP. For that you need to have a RADIUS server or use local accounts created on the Sophos. The only other minor issue, very minor, I ran into was that you will not find any setup for port forwarding in the menus. It is just not called port forwarding, you do this with DNAT rules."
