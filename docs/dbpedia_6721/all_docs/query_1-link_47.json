You can go to your START menu, and search for “Add or Remove programs” to see the list of installed/existing programs.\n\n2. Some variations of this SonicWALL VPN software might be named “SonicWALL Global VPN connection” or “Dell SonicWALL NetExtender” etc.\n\nREBOOT YOUR COMPUTER!!!\n\nWe found that if you reboot BEFORE and also AFTER the installation of this program- there are less chances of issues/failures.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Go to this website: https://www.sonicwall.com/products/remote-access/vpn-clients, and download the NetExtender for Windows:\n\n2. The latest version of this program will be downloaded to your computer. Please locate that downloaded file and run it.\n\n3. Accept all the default values and all the positive answers (I agree, Yes, Accept, Continue…)\n\n4. Reboot the computer at the end of the installation. Do not try to run the program before you reboot your computer!\n\n5. After the computer rebooted, you’ll find the new SonicWall NetExtender icon on your computer’s desktop. Run it. This is how it looks like:\n\n6. You’ll be asked for your SERVER, USERNAME, PASSWORD and DOMAIN. If you don’t know this information, please contact us or reach out to your office manager/in-house IT engineer.\n\n7. You might need to check your Email account for a one-time password that the system Emailed you. If you see that popup asking you for the One Time Password- make sure to enter it ASAP. That code expires within less than 1 minute.\n\n8. If the connection was successful, you will be notified that you are successfully connected. You can now access the office resources as needed/instructed."
