        "text": "by\n\nIf youâ€™ve been using a SonicWall firewall for some time now, you no doubt wonder who first came up with this excellent security solution. The firewall is one of the best things to happen to businesses. Of course, as with any incredible invention, many people claim they are the father of the firewall. Keep reading as we head back in time to learn who invented the firewall.\n\nWho is the Inventor of the Firewall?\n\nOver the years, there have been many discussions about who invented the firewall technology. Nir Zuk says he developed the technology which we now see in all SonicWall firewall features today. However, David Pensak is the one who claims to have built the first firewall that was a commercial success. On top of that, we have Marcus Ranum, who also claims to be the father of the firewall. As you can see, itâ€™s a complicated story with so many people taking the claim to the title of the inventor of this incredible solution. However, other people state none of them invented the firewall, and they were just involved in creating the filtering technology thatâ€™s critical to its success.\n\nThe History of the Firewall\n\nAll of the individuals listed above were involved in the evolution of the firewall in some way. While some can be traced back to the start of the firewall, others played their role within the technology development area. In fact, it can be said that all of these men and a few other figures helped to make the first firewall and develop this technology to what it is today. When looking at who invented firewalls, we need to head back to the late 1980s. You might be surprised to hear this technology dates that far back, but this was when it was first developed by the Digital Equipment Corporation. At this time, the firewalls relied on the Open Systems Interconnection model and the first four layers of this model. These ensured packets were either dropped or allowed to move forward in the system, creating the basic function of a firewall.\n\nModern Firewall Solutions\n\nIf youâ€™ve been using a SonicWall small business firewall, youâ€™ll know that the technology has come on a long way since this time. The firewall development has continued for many years to make the solutions we know and use currently. Organic development led to the firewalls that are on the market today, and youâ€™ll find that they now all benefit from user content management and intrusion prevention. The open-source firewall first came to the market in 1993, which offered more layers of firewalling for companies. This was a huge leap forward for the industry and had a heavy influence on products for the next two decades. This was released by Trusted Information Systems, but DEC had also launched a product a couple of years earlier, which was very influential within the industry.\n\nThereâ€™s no clear answer to the question of who invented the firewall, but it appears to be a joint effort that brought us to where we are today. While weâ€™re sure many people would like to claim the title of the father of the firewall, itâ€™s important that we realise that so much time and technology went into protecting our businesses today. No business should be operating without a firewall, as itâ€™s one of the best solutions for businesses working online. Are you ready to upgrade your firewall solution this year?
