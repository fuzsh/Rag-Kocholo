        "text": "My company has been using SonicWall for the last 7 years or so, and we're currently on a NSA 3600 (NGFW) HA pair for main branch and a TZ500 for a small remote office. The TZ500 is totally fine and the 3600 works ok for the most part but there are always a lot of bugs and issues seemingly for every service and feature (espeically HA). Changes and firmware upgrades are often a painful and worrisome ordeal. Finally, the support is absolutely terrible - I have had 100+ tickets and I find that its really hit or miss if you get someone who has any idea of what they are doing unless I luck out and get the really experienced (but super grouchy) Indian technician.\n\nI am at the point now where I want to consider other NGFW options but I have been in IT long enough to know that just switching products because you aren't happy isn't a solution unless you do a ton of research/DD.\n\nThat said, I wanted to get some extremely surface level insight here about where to start with looking into what PA offers.\n\nAs for pricing, what is a very ballpark cost of a PA NGFW comparable to the NSA 3600 ? We pay ballpark under $6K/year for this and honestly, where I work, we could easily afford more. I just want to get a very rough idea of cost.\n\nSecondly, with the NSA 3600, we basically have several networks and zones, integrated wifi AP's and general security services like Gateway AV/Anti-Spyware/Intrusion Prevention/App Control/App Visualization, DPI-SSL (which has issues), bot-net filter, etc. I also just recently purchased SonicWall's Network Security Manager (NSM) which is a hosted service for management and analytics and reporting - and this thing doesn't even work correctly yet, at least not with the NSA 3600 and current firmware despite being told it was.\n\nSo yeah, can anyone give me a super rough idea of cost as well as pain level of dealing with the PA products and support?"
