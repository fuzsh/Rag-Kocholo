        "text": "International. SonicWall celebrates its 30th anniversary. During August, the company will celebrate its legacy, product innovation, channel-based DNA, and the numerous cybersecurity innovators who have helped support and transform it into the SonicWall it is today.\n\n\"Innovation and adaptability are key components in successfully developing cybersecurity strategy through the cycle in which the fast-paced threat landscape moves,\" said SonicWall President and CEO Bill Conner. \"SonicWall has demonstrated over three decades that its mission is to ensure the long-term success of its customers, partners and employees. While the past five years were important chapters on this journey, we have more goals to achieve, milestones to mark, and history to make. SonicWall always looks to the future. And that's how the company, and its people, has been a mainstay of the industry for more than 30 years.\"\n\nTo commemorate this historic milestone, the company will honor its veteran employees and celebrate those with a long history. During August, SonicWall will present images of the company, people, products, partners and customers who have been part of the company's history over three decades, through the social media campaign #SonicWall30. Remembrance Thursdays will be reserved for contests and stories that describe SonicWall's past and future.\n\nThe SonicWall Story\n\nFounded in 1991 by brothers Sreekanth and Sudhakar Ravi as Sonic Systems, a provider of networking solutions for Apple computers, the company's goal was to provide organizations of all sizes with firewall technology that was as affordable as it was effective. The first security device for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), Interpol, was launched in October 1997 and soon after renamed 'SonicWALL' in 1998. A year later, the company issued its initial public offering (IPO) and was renamed SonicWALL.\n\nAfter being owned by private equity firm Thoma Bravo and sold to Dell in 2012, the company changed its name to \"SonicWall\" in 2016 and now resides as part of Francisco Partners' portfolio."
