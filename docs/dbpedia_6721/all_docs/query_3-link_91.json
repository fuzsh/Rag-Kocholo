        "text": "Finding Your Next SonicWall Firewall\n\nRecommended User Counts – The most important consideration when buying a SonicWall next-gen firewall is the number of users your network must support. User counts means more than just the number of employees in your organization. A user is defined as any desktop, laptop, printer, phone, tablet, or other Internet-connected device operating on your organization’s network.\n\nFor optimal security, get an accurate count of every user in your system. Firewalls.com recommends leaving extra room for additional users in case your business grows or if you need to accommodate guest users. This also ensures there’s plenty of bandwidth for resource-heavy applications.\n\nFirewalls.com Recommends:\n\nShop the SonicWall TZ Series to secure 1 to 50 Users\n\nShop the SonicWall NSa Series to secure 50 to 2500 Users\n\nShop the SonicWall NSsp Series to secure 2500 or more Users\n\nThroughput Speeds – A firewall’s throughput is a measure of the volume of Internet traffic that can pass through the firewall at any one time, based on the processing power of the hardware. Throughput is measured in Mbps (megabits per second) and Gbps (gigabits per second). SonicWall datasheets list a variety of throughput statistics based on the types of security services, traffic, and protocols that the firewall is handling.\n\nMax Firewall Throughput – Max Firewall Throughput is the highest throughput statistic you will see on any datasheet because it denotes the maximum possible processing speed of the hardware when no additional services are deployed. This is the “out of the box” speed and, for most usage cases, does not reflect how a firewall will perform in a real-world scenario.\n\nSSL VPN Throughput – Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Virtual Private Networks (VPN) refer to communication protocols that govern how information is encrypted and transmitted between a source and its destination. Utilizing SSL VPN tunnels is the most secure means for remote workers, outposts, and branch offices to access resources from the primary database. Because a VPN is a private connection, throughput speeds are dependent on the kinds of data being transferred as well as the performance potential of the gateway encrypting and decrypting the traffic that passes through it.\n\nIMIX Throughput – IMIX, or Internet Mix, refers to simulated traffic passing through a firewall to emulate how the hardware would perform in a real-world environment. IMIX throughputs represent the performance a firewall was able to achieve while handling a variety of packet sizes and traffic patterns. Internet Mix profiles are based on real-world samples captured by a selection of Internet routers and security sensors. This statistic will closely reflect the actual performance you can expect on your network.\n\nFirewalls.com Recommends:\n\nBusiness data is most secure when utilizing advanced scanning functions like Deep Packet Inspection and dedicated secure VPN tunnels. Shopping for firewalls based on Full DPI Throughput and SSL VPN Throughput guarantees your organization has plenty of performance potential to accommodate advanced services. When in doubt, assume your network will perform at 50%-70% of the throughput speeds listed on datasheets, leaving ample space for your network to grow.\n\nSite-to-Site VPN Tunnels – Site-to-site VPN tunnels allow fixed-location Local Area Networks (LANs) to extend secure conduits to the main office intranet. DPI-SSL is included standard with any current generation SonicWall firewall. SonicWall datasheets show a whole number that defines the maximum number of tunnels that a firewall can accept from remote LANs, labeled as Site-to-Site VPN Tunnels. These system specification tables will also include the number of IPSec VPN clients and SSL VPN licenses that are included with purchase compared to the maximum allowed clients/licenses. For example, the TZ300 series firewall is demarcated as 1 (10), meaning that a TZ300 firewall will include one SSL VPN license, with a maximum of 10 possible.\n\nForm Factor – The form factor of an appliance is the size and shape of the hardware. Most firewalls will have either a desktop form factor or rackmount form factor. Desktop form factor indicates that the firewall is a compact appliance, small enough to comfortably sit atop a desktop, while rackmount form factor specifies that the appliance was designed to be secured in a standard 19-inch server rack. Rackmount-sized appliances will sometimes indicate how many rack units (RU) the device occupies.\n\nPower Over Ethernet (Poe) – PoE devices pass electricity along with their Ethernet cabling, reducing the number of cables that must be plugged into the appliance. PoE-enabled firewalls reduce the complexity of deployments and allow more flexible placement in locations where access to electrical outlets may not be convenient. SonicWall’s TZ570-PoE firewalls allow small businesses to more freely layout and deploy their network in small office environments without purchasing an additional PoE-enabled network switch.\n\nWireless Support – Some organizations prefer wireless firewall solutions in lieu of appliances that must be connected via Cat5E/Cat6 cabling. Wired networking solutions are generally considered more reliable and more stable, especially because signals are not influenced or impeding by other connections. Wired appliances are generally much faster with data transfer speeds constantly improving thanks to the introduction of Gigabit interfaces. Wireless solutions, however, do carry the benefit of additional mobility and flexibility of deployment, being able to reach any location without the limitations of physical cables. Wireless environments can also be installed more easily as they require less equipment and planning.\n\nFirewalls.com Recommends:\n\nBefore making your cybersecurity investment, take stock of all the physical attributes of your facilities. Are building materials conducive or unfavorable to wireless signal transmission? Are power outlets plentiful and easy to reach? Are there certain areas that should be off-limits for Internet connectivity? Physical security should be an important concern when laying out your network and may impact the final hardware details you select.\n\nTo Learn More About Firewall Tech Specs, Click Here\n\nIn almost all situations, buyers should be looking to bundle their firewall with additional services or support. Appliance only purchases are typically only advisable if the hardware is going to be added to an existing network and should never be used for primary firewall protection.\n\nTotal Secure Essentials Edition – SonicWall's Total Secure Essentials Protection Suite is a package built to stop known threats.
