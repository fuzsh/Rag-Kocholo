(SGI), a top Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP), delivering world-class cybersecurity solutions to hundreds of Managed Service Providers (MSPs). The acquisition reinforces SonicWall's commitment to its valued partners and extends its portfolio to include U.S.-based Security Operations Center services (SOCaaS), Managed Detection and Response (MDR), and other managed services that are tailor-made for MSPs and MSSPs.\n\n\"IT teams have turned to MDR and other managed services to identify and triage digital threats – it's a critical need we are now excited to offer,\" said SonicWall President and CEO Bob VanKirk. \"Together, SonicWall and Solutions Granted will empower cybersecurity and technology service providers with economical threat defense solutions and extend a world-class, comprehensive portfolio that streamlines managing security across customer environments with automated threat detection and response services.\"\n\nThe acquisition aligns with SonicWall's outside-in approach, providing partners with a best-of-suite, comprehensive and flexible portfolio that accelerates their growth.\n\n\"Solutions Granted's understanding of the critical nature of MSPs/MSSPs operations has helped us create an integrated approach for end-to-end managed threat protection that enables customers to navigate the turbulent cybersecurity landscape with confidence and resilience,\" said CEO of Solutions Granted Michael Crean. \"Today's MSPs and MSSPs increasingly need a platform of managed security solutions rather than point solutions. The combination of SonicWall and Solutions Granted delivers services specifically designed for today's partners – giving them a distinct competitive edge.\"\n\nToday's cybersecurity partners need highly automated solutions to quickly identify and respond to new threats across the entire customer environment – including network, endpoints, servers, and cloud.
