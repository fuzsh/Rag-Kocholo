        "text": "Joey Mazick, COO and Mike Mazick, Founder and Business Owner\n\nIn a world marked by escalating cyber threats and rampant hacking activities, the pivotal role of cybersecurity in fortifying sensitive information cannot be overstated. However, these security strategies often take a backseat in the priorities of businesses, especially for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The lack of emphasis may lead to insufficient investment in a dedicated internal team, leaving them vulnerable to numerous cyber incidents.\n\nWhile relying solely on antivirus software solutions can provide them temporary cover, it leaves their networks and systems exposed to many cyberattacks in the long run, potentially rendering them dysfunctional in the event of a breach. This prompts most SMEs to look for external assistance to elevate their security posture and stay secure during the age of digital renaissance.\n\nNetwork Systems & Solutions (NSSAZ), a prominent full-service IT solutions specialist, stands ready to address these vulnerabilities facing SMEs and assists them in establishing a fortified defense. With a rich legacy in IT consulting and IT management spanning four decades, this multi-generational family-owned business specializes in network installations, cybersecurity scans, and vulnerability assessments. The company’s expertise also extends to constructing a robust zero-trust network for businesses, making it the epitome of professional excellence in the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity solutions.\n\n“At NSSAZ, our goal is to serve as the trusted partner for clients, assisting them in building a strong network and testing their networks for vulnerabilities,” says Mike Mazick, Founder and Business Owner of NSSAZ.\n\nCoherent to this goal, NSSAZ collaborates closely with industry leaders like SonicWall, giving it the natural edge to implement next-generation firewalls as a crucial component of their unified threat systems. The firm distinguishes itself in the managed service provider (MSP) space through its cost-effectiveness and the ability to deliver multiple security features with a single piece of equipment.\n\nTARGETING SPECIFIC NEEDS FOR DIFFERENT CLIENTS\n\nNSSAZ caters primarily to SMEs with 5 to 750 desktops, offering invaluable support to those without in-house IT departments. These businesses recognize the utmost importance of maintaining a secure and efficient network. One notable challenge lies in enlightening them about the all-encompassing nature of cybersecurity and the necessity for associated hardware, software, monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and security components. Despite this, clients often find themselves caught off guard by the costs associated with properly securing their networks, reflecting the dynamic and sophisticated nature of modern security requirements.\n\nFurthermore, the industry faces issues related to unresponsive IT consultants and unresolved problems, contributing to unmet expectations. This scenario prompts clients to actively seek managed IT services, emphasizing the pivotal role of attentive and reliable support in today’s ever-changing business landscape.\n\nA BROAD ARRAY OF SERVICES WITH A PERSONAL TOUCH\n\nLed by a dedicated team of IT experts, engineers, and consultants committed to offering the best solutions for clients’ business needs, NSSAZ embraces a systemic approach to service delivery. It begins by rectifying the misconfiguration in their network and systems. The team prioritizes onsite visits, ensuring a deep understanding of their businesses while configuring the security service with a personalized touch. This dispels the misconception that relying on an internet provider ensures security.\n\nNSSAZ goes beyond the traditional MSP cybersecurity approach, conducting network scans, vulnerability assessments, and compliance checks. However, more than the equipment and system, it considers the human link as the potential weak point in security. That’s why NSSAZ always prioritizes education, enlightening clients about all the evolving threats and ensuring they grasp the significance of robust cybersecurity measures.\n\n“When we engage a customer, we try to do what’s best for them within their budget and compliance needs,” says Joey Mazick, COO at NSSAZ.\n\nWhether a network installation, cybersecurity scan, or establishment of a zero-trust network using SonicWall technologies, NSSAZ incorporates its deep expertise and rich knowledge into every aspect of the processes. This commitment extends to managing networks responsibly, staying involved in installation processes, and fostering long-term relationships. The emphasis on old-fashioned customer service underscores its dedication to better understanding its clients’ businesses, leading to relationships that have endured for nearly three decades.\n\nNSSAZ employs a diverse array of cutting-edge technologies, ranging from firewalls and end-user monitoring to zero-trust networks and multifactor authentication. This ensures a tailored and layered approach to security. The company’s capabilities also extend to comprehensive vulnerability scanning and compliance testing, utilizing tools from various providers, such as Kaseya and Rapid7. These tools, integrated with a scoring mechanism, enable NSSAZ’s team to generate insightful reports, guiding clients through necessary changes. This is particularly crucial for businesses operating in industries with stringent regulations, such as HIPAA, PCI, or FTC compliance.\n\nNSSAZ acknowledges and embraces the sophistication of modern computing systems. The company advocates for equally sophisticated solutions, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures to shield networks from the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. This forward-thinking approach aligns seamlessly with NSSAZ’s commitment to providing clients with advanced and adaptive security solutions.\n\nDEMONSTRATING EXCELLENCE THROUGH SUCCESS\n\nTo better understand NSSAZ’s transformative impact, consider its work with a local auto group in Arizona. The client, housing approximately 300 endpoints, initially grappled with severe cybersecurity vulnerabilities. They were experiencing frequent hacking incidents and widespread virus infections across their networks. The existing support system was also overwhelmed and inadequate in addressing the escalating threats.\n\nAt NSSAZ, our goal is to serve as the trusted partner for clients, assisting them in building a strong network and testing their networks for vulnerabilities\n\nNSSAZ stepped in with a comprehensive security solution, strategically deploying a SonicWall antivirus across each of the client’s locations. This proactive measure proved highly effective in eliminating security issues, providing a robust defense against cyber threats. The success of the implementation is underscored by the fact that the client has remained under NSSAZ’s protection for nearly two decades.\n\nThe SonicWall security solution cleared all existing security issues and demonstrated its resilience in the face of subsequent major cybersecurity attacks targeting the client’s dealer network and supply chain. Over the years, NSSAZ has successfully shielded the client from a variety of threats, and notably, there have been zero security incidents since the SonicWall security solutions were implemented.\n\nWhen we engage a customer, we try to do what’s best for them within their budget and compliance needs\n\nExpanding the Sphere of Security, the NSSAZ Way\n\nNSSAZ stands out for its technical expertise and steadfast dedication to ensuring customer satisfaction. Additionally, the flexibility offered by SonicWall’s varied licensing levels enables it to precisely match security solutions to each client’s specific requirements. The company’s proactive approach is evident in its consistent efforts to refine and adapt solutions, ensuring they meet clients’ evolving needs.\n\nThe focus on education, onsite visits, and regular health checks underscores its commitment to being a security provider and a trusted advisor invested in clients’ long-term success. The commitment to cybersecurity is timely, given the escalating threats in today’s digital landscape. NSSAZ addresses clients’ current security needs and anticipates future challenges, positioning itself as a forward-looking company.\n\nAs NSSAZ continues to concentrate on cybersecurity and evolve into a better company, its dedication to growth is evident. Its expansion is not just about physical offices but reaching more customers, understanding their challenges, and providing solutions that stand the test of time. NSSAZ’s success is then a reflection of the enduring relationships it builds, the proactive adaptation to industry changes, and its commitment to being a trusted partner in their journey. As it continues to evolve and grow, NSSAZ remains a beacon of reliability, experience, and customer-centricity in the dynamic field of cybersecurity."
