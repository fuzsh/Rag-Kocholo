        "text": "‘IT teams have turned to MDR and other managed services to identify and triage digital threats—it’s a critical need we are now excited to offer,” says SonicWall CEO Bob VanKirk.\n\nSonicWall has acquired top managed security service provider Solutions Granted to boost its managed detection and response (MDR) portfolio and overall managed services business targeting MSPs.\n\n“IT teams have turned to MDR and other managed services to identify and triage digital threats—it’s a critical need we are now excited to offer,” said SonicWall CEO Bob VanKirk in a statement. “Together, SonicWall and Solutions Granted will empower cybersecurity and technology service providers with economical threat defense solutions and extend a world-class, comprehensive portfolio that streamlines managing security across customer environments with automated threat detection and response services.”\n\nSolutions Granted has made CRN’s Security 100 list for the past five years as a leading managed security service provider (MSSP) in North America.\n\nid\n\nunit-1659132512259\n\ntype\n\nSponsored post\n\nFinancial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.\n\n[Related: SonicWall: Ransomware Declines Further As Attackers ‘Pivot’ Their Tactics]\n\nSonicWall’s Merger Plans\n\nThe goal for Milpitas, Calif.-based SonicWall is to provide Solutions Granted’s portfolio to its MSSP and MSP channel base, along with enhancing its MDR technology and Security Operations Center services.\n\nSonicWall partners need highly automated solutions to quickly identify and respond to threats across customer environments such as endpoints, servers and cloud computing, the company said. By acquiring Solutions Granted, partners can leverage the latest in AI to provide differentiated services.\n\nSolutions Granted CEO Michael Crean said the Woodbridge, Va.-based company’s expertise in MSPs and MSSPs operations creates an integrated approach for end-to-end managed threat protection that enables customers to navigate the turbulent cybersecurity landscape with resilience.\n\n“Today’s MSPs and MSSPs increasingly need a platform of managed security solutions rather than point solutions,” said Crean in a statement. “The combination of SonicWall and Solutions Granted delivers services specifically designed for today’s partners—giving them a distinct competitive edge.”\n\nSonicWall Launched Revamped Partner Program In 2023\n\nThe deal comes just two months after SonicWall overhauled its SecureFirst Partner Program.\n\nIn September, SonicWall unveiled a revamped channel program that brings a major focus on better enabling MSPs and MSSPs to work with the company. The security company also introduced a range of improvements aimed at driving accelerated growth with all partners.\n\nSonicWall has more than 17,000 partners worldwide.\n\nThe hope with the new SecureFirst channel program—marking the biggest update to the SonicWall program in seven years—is to resonate with existing partners while also generating interest among security MSPs that don’t work with the company.\n\nCrucial updates for MSPs and MSSPs in the new SecureFirst Partner Program include the introduction of a monthly consumption and billing model, in contrast to previous requirements for commitments of one to three years for procuring product licenses.\n\nFounded in 1991, SonicWall provides protection against cyberattacks across exposure points for increasingly remote, mobile and cloud-enabled users. With its own threat research center, SonicWall said that it can quickly and economically provide purpose-built security solutions to enable any organization."
