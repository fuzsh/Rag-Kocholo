        "text": ",\n\nETCIO\n\nPublished On Aug 4, 2018 at 07:00 AM IST\n\nRead by: 100 Industry Professionals\n\nRead by 100 Industry Professionals\n\nBangalore: SonicWall, a private equity-backed security company is planning to expand its product engineering facility in India.\n\nAccording to Debasish Mukherjee’s, Country Manager India & SAARC SonicWall, the company will expand its product engineering facility in Bangalore in the coming months.\n\n“In India, we are expanding our facility and very soon you will hear about the new facility based out of Bangalore and the development has already been started over here. We are increasing the manpower and lots of development has already started happening in Bangalore,” Mukherjee told ETCIO.com\n\nAdvt\n\n“The company has over 350 people that are providing technical support and working in the R&D space,” added Mukherjee. With the plans to expand the facility, the company is likely to increase headcounts in the engineering domain. However, the company has a separate sales team.\n\nIt’s been close to two years since SonicWall is operating as an independent security company after Dell sold SonicWall to private equity firm Francisco Partners and Elliott Management.\n\nSince then, the company has made a comeback trail and trying to regain its ground and business globally including India.\n\n“We are in the growth stage and we are growing more than double digits. We are meeting all our financial numbers quarter on quarter. So we are seeing a lot of traction and there’s a growth,” commented Mukherjee.\n\nTwo brothers Sreekanth Ravi and Sudhakar Ravi founded the company in 1991 as Sonic Systems and successfully established the company in the UTM (unified threat management) segment.\n\nHowever, in the past two years, post the spun-off from Dell, the company has been repositioning itself in the enterprise security space.\n\n“As you know, SonicWall was always a dominant or no.1 player globally in the UTM segment. But in last two, we have changed this story and we are no more a UTM company. And now we are more of an enterprise security company and all our technology product and innovation is happening in the enterprise space,” informed Mukherjee.\n\nAdvt\n\nAlthough, SonicWall’s UTM business focused on the SMB market has been growing at a decent rate, but it’s the enterprise business that has been growing at a higher rate than the SMB, according to Mukherjee.\n\nThe digital wave in India is actually opening up more opportunities for security companies and there’s growing competition as well.\n\n“Yes competition is growing and the market is also growing. The India market is almost $200 million, so now everyone growing, but the thing is, are they doing technology innovation or addressing the pain points,” remarked Mukherjee.\n\nWith 70 percent of data being encrypted today, Mukherjee asked that are those technologies available in the market able to decrypt the data and protect the customers against the growing encrypted threats sent by cybercriminals.\n\nAdvt\n\nThe encrypted threats are growing at a rate of over 200 percent, according to SonicWall’s midyear threat report.\n\nBy ,\n\nETCIO\n\nJoin the community of 2M+ industry professionals\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.\n\nDownload ETCIO App\n\nGet Realtime updates\n\nSave your favourite articles"
