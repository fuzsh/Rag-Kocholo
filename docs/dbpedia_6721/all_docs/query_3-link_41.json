Is it possible to use a different method than IKE to establish VPN?\n\nFYI:\n\nIt is a SonicWall TZ170\n\nInternet connection is up\n\nI have the correct IP - I can connect using other applications\n\nHad to change the modem/router for one with that could be set to bridging pass though mode - PPPoE then has to be setup on the SonicWall.\n\nTurns out some modem/routers just wont cut it.\n\nSonicWall have a dedicated article to the issue: http://www.sonicwall.com/downloads/GVC_Peer_is_Not_Responding_to_Phase_1_Requests.pdf"
