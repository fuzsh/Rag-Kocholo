        "text": "SonicWall is including endpoint vendors in its managed detection and response (MDR) portfolio to create a co-managed security service for new and existing managed service providers (MSPs).\n\nThe channel-first cybersecurity provider said the new tailor-made service package is available to MSPs selling the cybersecurity protector’s Capture Client or Microsoft’s Defender Antivirus (ne Windows Defender). SonicWall said that MSP customers will soon see more additions to its managed security offerings ranging from managed firewalls to managed cloud security as its lineup expands.\n\nIn addition to its Capture Client EDR solution and Defender Antivirus, SonicWall’s MDR service also pairs with next-generation antivirus providers SentinelOne and Cylance. MSPs that use SentinelOne or Cylance can receive the same 24/7 monitoring, threat hunting, and anomaly detection from SonicWall’s security operation center’s (SOC) team.\n\nSonicWall's Endpoint Agnostic Strategy\n\nBob VanKirk, SonicWall’s chief executive and president, said that the company will be “delivering an endpoint agnostic” solution. “Our commitment to empowering our partners is evident, and we will continue to build a world-class security platform they need to sustain this current momentum,” he said.\n\nThe security provider said it also intends to create a cybersecurity platform that enables “tighter integration across its portfolio,” and covers third party vendors and partners.\n\nSonicWall said it will be rolling out an EMEA-based SOC in Q2 of 2024. The company expects the new SOC will improve immediate response, and overall, better security for both MSPs and their customers.\n\n“SonicWall now delivers an integrated approach for end-to-end managed threat protection enabling MSPs to help customers navigate the turbulent cybersecurity landscape with confidence and resilience – giving them a distinct competitive edge,” said Michael Crean, SonicWall senior vice president of managed services.\n\nSonicWall has also recently taken a number of steps to fortify its SecureFirst partner program such as stocking additional benefits to help its North American MSSP and MSP partners get the most value out of its products.\n\nSonicWall's Recent M and A Activity\n\nThe company has embarked on an M&A journey. In early January, SonicWall snapped up Banyan Security, a provider of security service edge (SSE) solutions aimed at companies replacing legacy architectures with SSE technology and zero trust network access (ZTNA).\n\nSonicWall said that the Banyan Security deal extends the reach of its portfolio to the cloud and provides partners and their customers with more flexibility. It further underscores SonicWall’s “best-of-suite” strategy, which includes network, endpoint, wireless, cloud email and threat intelligence under a single, multi-tenant portal, the company said."
