        "text": "It depends on the environment. The base Sonicwall configuration time is pretty quick and a “plain vanilla” install might only take an hour. That said, it might also be wise to give yourself some additional time to load the latest firmware and set up the customer’s “My Sonicwall” account on their behalf (30 minutes to an hour). Be sure to include some time for documentation (30 minutes to an hour) and allow yourself a buffer for testing and troubleshooting (maybe another hour). All in all, that gives a total time window that could be anywhere from 2 to 4 hours.\n\nAs far as the overall estimate goes… If you’re walking into an environment “cold”, you have no idea what the current firewall configuration is and don’t know how many network devices there are (or where they are plugged in). Accordingly, you could end up finding a mess and needing to fix it over the course of your install.\n\nTo elaborate, I had a Sonicwall multi-site VPN project a couple years back that was a spoke-and-hub VPN configuration. As I recall, we had an NSA 240 in the main office and TZ 100 boxes in each of the remote sites. I planned 4 hours for the main office and 1 hour for each of the remote sites. The main office install went by the book and I used a lot of my time on that end for documentation and figuring out my install strategy for the remote sites.\n\nMany of the remote sites were simple and I was in and out in a jiffy. However, there were a couple that ended up taking 2 hours or more due to the change in IP address scheme. For those locations, there were network MFPs that needed to be configured with new static IP addresses. So not only did I have to change the printer’s IP (and call the vendor to get the printer admin password), I also had to change the TCP/IP printer port settings on each PC. Some of those PCs had static IP addresses, so I had to fix that too… and all of that was not technically part of the Sonicwall installation.\n\nWhen I started my current job they had TZ 170 at each of the three sites. I had just ordered TZ 215w and 2X TZ 215. They didn’t have a current password for the TZ 170s and I had never used sonicwalls before. I spent the next two weeks getting as much detail as I could about the network as it consisted of a secondary internal state network as well.\n\nWithin a month of receiving the new units I was forced to learn sonicwall. One router had crashed. Not good at all.I drove to the site and spent 5.5 hours on the phone giving all the information I knew and had it working 5.5hrs later.\n\nThe other two I had done in about an hour on my own."
