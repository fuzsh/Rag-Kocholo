        "text": "The SonicWall Network Security Appliance Series:\n\nNext-Generation Firewall\n\nOrganizations of all sizes depend on their networks to access internal and external mission-critical applications. As advances in networking continue to provide tremendous benefits, organizations are increasingly challenged by sophisticated and financially-motivated attacks designed to disrupt communication, degrade performance and compromise data. Malicious attacks penetrate outdated stateful packet inspection firewalls with advanced application layer exploits. Point products add layers of security, but are costly, difficult to manage, limited in controlling network misuse and ineffective against the latest multipronged attacks.\n\nBy utilizing a unique multi-core design and patented Reassembly-Free Deep Packet Inspection™ (RFDPI) technology*, the SonicWall® Network Security >Appliance (NSA) Series of Next-Generation Firewalls offers complete protection without compromising network performance. The low latency NSa Series overcomes the limitations of existing security solutions by scanning the entirety of each packet for current internal and external threats in real-time. The NSa Series offers intrusion prevention, malware protection, and application intelligence, control and visualization, while delivering breakthrough performance. With advanced routing, stateful high-availability and high-speed IPSec and SSL VPN technology, the NSa Series adds security, reliability, functionality and productivity to branch offices, central sites and distributed mid-enterprise networks, while minimizing cost and complexity.\n\nComprised of the SonicWall NSa 220, NSa 220 Wireless-N, NSa 250M, NSa 250M Wireless-N, NSa 2600, NSa 3600, NSa 4600, NSa 5600 and NSa 6600, the NSa Series offers a scalable range of solutions designed to meet the network security needs of any organization.\n\nNext-Generation Firewall\n\nScalable multi-core hardware and Reassembly-Free Deep Packet Inspection\n\nApplication intelligence, control and visualization\n\nStateful high availability and load balancing\n\nHigh performance and lowered TCO\n\nNetwork productivity\n\nAdvanced routing services and networking\n\nStandards-based Voice over IP (VoIP)\n\nSonicWall Clean Wireless\n\nOnboard Quality of Service (QoS)\n\nIntegrated modules suppor\n\n*U.S. Patents 7,310,815; 7,600,257; 7,738,380; 7,835,361; 7,991,723\n\nConnectivity Modules:\n\nWith SonicWall® 4-port GbE and 2-port SFP M1 Modules for the SonicWall NSa 250M, you can add more network interfaces to an existing deployment, consolidate hardware and even increase functionality with a fiber connectivity option.\n\nSonicWall 4-Port GbE M1 Module\n\nExpanded port density - The SonicWall 4-Port GbE M1 Module expands port density by adding four 1-Gbps Ethernet networking interfaces without incurring costs of an additional switch, reducing points of failure.\n\nComprehensive security - The 4-port GbE M1 Module integrates SonicWall Reassembly-Free Deep Packet Inspection™ (RFDPI) to added port interfaces, delivering comprehensive security that a separate, expensive Layer-3 managed switch does not provide.\n\nHighest speeds - The 4-port GbE M1 Module negotiates 10/100/1000 Mbps (1 Gbps) Ethernet speeds. It automatically negotiates the best speed available through MDIX. It can also be manually configured to a particular speed.\n\nComprehensive central management - Administrators can manage the modules using the SonicWall Global Management System™.\n\nSonicWall 2-Port SFP M1 Module\n\nFiber connectivity - The 2-port SFP M1 Module offers a fiber alternative to the 4-Port GbE M1 Module, enabling more flexible and scalable deployments in a wide range of environments.\n\nCost savings - The 2-port SFP M1 Module adds fiber connectivity over two SFP copper/fiber 1-Gbps Ethernet networking interfaces without additional third party equipment costs, reducing points of failure\n\nFlexible deployments - The 2-port SFP M1 Module can use any SonicWall-supported third-party SFP transceivers, whether using multi- or single-mode fiber, or regular copper GbE connectors.\n\nComprehensive security - The 2-port SFP M1 Module integrates SonicWall RFDPI to added port interfaces, increasing your network security.\n\nComprehensive central management - Administrators can manage the module using the SonicWall Global Management System."
