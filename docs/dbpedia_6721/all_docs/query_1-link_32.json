        "text": "The cybersecurity vendor says the acquisition of the eight-year-old company will help expand its offerings in SASE.\n\nSonicWall said Wednesday that it has acquired Banyan Security, a security service edge (SSE) vendor focused on enabling adoption of a zero trust posture.\n\nThe Milpitas, Calif.-based cybersecurity vendor did not disclose the terms of the acquisition. Banyan will bring approximately 50 employees to SonicWall, the company told CRN.\n\n[Related: ‘A New Dawn’: SonicWall Revamps Partner Program To Accelerate Growth, Activate MSPs]\n\nThe deal will bring technologies including ZTNA (zero trust network access) into SonicWall’s portfolio, ultimately helping the company to expand its offerings in SASE (secure access service edge), the company said in a news release.\n\nIn the release, SonicWall CEO Bob VanKirk said the combination with Banyan will help to “empower partners to deliver a security architecture for any stage of their customers’ evolving cloud journey.”\n\nIt’s the second acquisition for SonicWall in two months, following the mid-November deal to acquire Solutions Granted, an MSP that SonicWall said would boost its managed detection and response (MDR) offering.\n\nBanyan was founded in 2015 and had raised at least $47 million to date, most recently closing a $30 million Series B round in early 2022 led by Third Point Ventures."
