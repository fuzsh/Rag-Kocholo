        "text": "MILPITAS, Calif., Aug. 10, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- SonicWall today announces its 30th anniversary as a cybersecurity industry leader. Throughout August, the company will celebrate its heritage, product innovation, channel DNA and the many cybersecurity innovators who have helped support and transform it into the SonicWall it is today.\n\n\"Innovation and adaptability are key components to successfully evolving cybersecurity strategy through the ebb and flow of the fast-moving threat landscape,\" said SonicWall President and CEO Bill Conner. \"SonicWall has proven across three decades that its mission is securing the long-term success of its customers, partners and employees. While the last five years were important chapters in this journey, we have more goals to achieve, milestones to mark and history to be made. SonicWall is always forward-looking. And that's how the company — and its people — has been a mainstay in the industry for more than 30 years.\"\n\nTo commemorate this milestone achievement, the company will honor long-term employees and celebrate those who have deep tenure. Throughout the month of August, SonicWall will feature pictures from the company, people, products, partners and customers over the course of three decades via the #SonicWall30 social media campaign. Throwback Thursdays will be reserved for contests and stories depicting SonicWall's past and future.\n\nThe SonicWall story\n\nFounded in 1991 by brothers Sreekanth and Sudhakar Ravi as Sonic Systems, a provider of networking solutions for Apple computers, the company's focus was to provide organizations of all sizes with firewall technology that was as affordable as it was effective. The first security appliance for small- to mid-sized businesses (SMB) — the Interpol –— was released in October 1997 and shortly thereafter renamed 'SonicWALL' in 1998. One year later, the company issued its initial public offering (IPO) and was rebranded SonicWALL.\n\nAfter being held by private equity firm Thoma Bravo and sold to Dell in 2012, the company rebranded as 'SonicWall' in 2016 and now resides as part of Francisco Partners' portfolio.\n\nSonicWall milestones at a glance\n\n1991: Sonic Systems founded by brothers Sreekanth and Sudhakar Ravi\n\n1991: Company's first product, an Ethernet card for the NuBus and SE expansion slots, shipped\n\n1992: Apple OEMs relied on Sonic System's software for connecting LocalTalk to Ethernet\n\n1995: Sonic Systems released first internet appliance product, the QuickStream/3, a three-port multi-protocol remote access server\n\n1997: First security appliance ships; first named Interpol and later rebranded as 'SonicWALL,' the product delivered SMBs a secure, affordable and easy-to-administer firewall/NAT solution\n\n1999: Company renamed 'SonicWALL,' issued IPO under 'SNWL' symbol\n\n2002: Company shipped 250,000th unit\n\n2005: Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP) program announced\n\n2007: First patent (SWUS-001 – U.S. Patent No. 7,158,986) granted\n\n2010: Company eclipses 1 million units shipped\n\n2016: Bill Conner named President and CEO after company acquired by Francisco Partners\n\n2016: SecureFirst partner program introduced\n\n2018: Capture Cloud Platform announced at the RSA Conference\n\n2018: Patented Real-Time Deep Memory Inspection (RTDMITM) technology unveiled\n\n2019: Company eclipses 3 million units shipped\n\n2019: Capture Security Center introduced\n\n2020: Boundless Cybersecurity unveiled, Generation 7 announced\n\n2021: SonicWall celebrates 30th anniversary\n\nSonicWall's channel heritage, customer loyalty\n\nWith roots planted firmly in the SMB market, the company's growing customer base covers a vast range of industries, including education, healthcare, retail, infrastructure, federal government, state and local government, and more.

This anniversary is a fantastic achievement all round and we sincerely look forward to the future of cybersecurity knowing we are backed by a vendor that puts security and education first.\"\n\nThrough the award-winning SecureFirst partner program and SonicWall University, partners in every region have an opportunity to expand their education on today's threat landscape, SonicWall offerings and earn accreditations that directly influence increased revenue attainment.\n\nSonicWall technology evolution, growth\n\nSonicWall's product timeline moves at pace with the speed of technology developments.
