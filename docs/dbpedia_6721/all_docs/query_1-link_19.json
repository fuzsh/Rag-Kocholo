        "text": "SonicWall has purchased Solutions Granted Inc. (SGI) for an undisclosed sum to further extend its reach in the managed security services market.\n\nThis is technology M&A deal number 312 that MSSP Alert and sister site ChannelE2E have covered so far in 2023.\n\nSonicWall, founded in 1991, is based in Milpitas, California. The company has 1,939 associated members listed on LinkedIn. SonicWall's areas of expertise include network security, threat protection and secure access service edge (SASE).\n\nSGI, founded in 2007, is based in Woodbridge, Virginia. The company has 34 associated members listed on LinkedIn. SGI's areas of expertise include network security, endpoint security and security information and event management (SIEM).\n\nSonicWalls Expands Its Portfolio\n\nSGI brings its portfolio of MDR, security operations center-as-a-service (SOCaaS) and other managed services made for MSSPs and MSPs to SonicWall, the businesses said. It aligns with SonicWall's \"outside-in approach\" and provides its partners with access to technologies that they can use to grow, the companies stated.\n\nFurthermore, SGI and SonicWall will provide MSSPs and MSPs with automated solutions that they can use to identify and respond to threats across their customers' networks, endpoints, servers and cloud environments, the businesses stated. They will also leverage artificial intelligence to deliver a \"differentiated, effective and highly proficient service,\" the companies noted.\n\nSonicWall Continues to Enhance Its MSSP and MSP Partner Offerings\n\nThe SGI acquisition comes after SonicWall in September 2023 bolstered its partner program to help its North American MSSP and MSP partners get the most value out of its products, according to the company. Some of the program enhancements included:\n\nPreviously, SonicWall in June 2023 started offering monthly firewall security services bundles to MSSPs and MSPs. SonicWall's MSSP and MSP partners can use these bundles to \"provide their customers with flexible, cost-effective cybersecurity solutions,\" the company stated."
