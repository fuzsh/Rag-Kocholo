        "text": "As SonicWall hits 30 it is taking time to reflect on its history and to acknowledge the contribution the channel has made to the business.\n\nThe security player is marking its anniversary this month by looking back at its journey over the past three decades and talking about some of its future targets.\n\nThe vendor has built up a global network of 17,000 channel partners that it supports with training via the SonicWall University and SecureFirst programme. Some partners that signed up decades ago are still working with it.\n\nSome of those long-term channel partners, along with staff, products and customers, will feature in a social media campaign promoting the company’s anniversary.\n\n“Our SonicWall journey started in 1996 and we have been retaining loyal partners who we’ve helped to scope, deliver, install and manage their customers’ security infrastructure ever since,” said Exertis UK and Europe security sales director Jason Hill.\n\n“The relationships with the partner community stem right from the start and today we’re proud to still be working with the same fantastic partners, without whom we wouldn’t be here today. This anniversary is a fantastic achievement all round,” he added.\n\nSonicWall president and CEO Bill Conner said as the security landscape continued to evolve the vendor recognised the need to keep developing its products and maintaining support for its channel.\n\n“Innovation and adaptability are key components to successfully evolving cyber security strategy through the ebb and flow of the fast-moving threat landscape,” he said.\n\n“SonicWall has proven across three decades that its mission is securing the long-term success of its customers, partners and employees. While the last five years were important chapters in this journey, we have more goals to achieve, milestones to mark and history to be made,” added Conner. “SonicWall is always forward-looking – and that’s how the company, and its people, has been a mainstay in the industry for more than 30 years.”\n\nSet up by the Ravi brothers in 1991, SonicWall has been developing its position in the market to become one of the leading lights in the battle against ransomware.\n\nEarlier this summer, the firm launched a trio of enterprise firewalls designed to counter the ransomware threat. At the time of the launch, Conner indicated that the company would continue to invest in helping customers fend off attacks."
