        "text": "SonicWall Firewall\n\nSonicWall Firewall\n\nCyfin is designed to work with SonicWall. It integrates easily into your current system configuration.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nIn 1991 SonicWall was founded under the company name Sonic Systems. In late 1999 the company changed its name from Sonic Systems to SonicWall, Inc. to represent the shift to a network security company. It acquired a number of companies through the years and was itself acquired by Dell in 2012. It became an independent company once again in 2016. SonicWall provides comprehensive Next-Generation Firewall and Unified Threat Management solutions as well as Secure Remote Access, E-mail Security, Backup and Recovery, and Management and Reporting.\n\nCyfin Advanced Reporting for SonicWall\n\nCyfin - SonicWall Configuration\n\nCyfin is installed on a server, not on the SonicWall appliance.\n\nLog File Setup\n\nLog File Type: SonicWall Security Appliance\n\nSonicWall Configuration Steps\n\nThe following information applies to versions earlier than SonicOS 6.2.6 Content Filtering Service (CFS) release 4.0.\n\nIn order to get SonicWall Web traffic URLs into the Cyfin syslog, you must first have the SonicWall Content Filtering Service enabled. You must also enforce the Content Filtering Service within the zone (LAN) in which your traffic will be forwarded. In order to get the service enabled and enforced, follow the steps below:\n\nLog on to your SonicWall interface.\n\nGo to Security Services – Content Filter – Configure.\n\nSelect the Log Access to URL box.\n\nGo to Network – Zones. Find the LAN zone and click Configure.\n\nSelect the Enforce Content Filtering Service box.\n\nApply all changes above.\n\nTo verify that the changes were made successfully, you can make a copy of the raw syslogs that are generated after the change. These files are in the write location of your Cyfin installation (default location is …Wavecrest\\Cyfin\\wc\\cf\\log). You should see files being written called syslogXXXXXXXX.txt, if you have already configured the Cyfin setup correctly.\n\nMake a copy of the most recent file after the change, and use a text editor (Notepad++ works well) to open the file. Search for the fields dstname= and arg= to confirm that they exist. You can use Ctrl+F to find these strings. You may need to wait for a short time after making the changes for them to take effect.\n\nNote: If the log files are showing as invalid in Cyfin, see Unable to see Web site hits information in SonicWall for a possible resolution.\n\nCyfin Configuration Steps\n\nCyfin Syslog Server listens for syslog messages from your SonicWall device. Both UDP-based and TCP-based messages are supported."
