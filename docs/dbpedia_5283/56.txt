Actor Bill Nunn has passed away aged 62.

Nunn had a successful career on screens both big and small, working regularly with Spike Lee and appearing blockbusters like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man.

He first came to prominence as an actor in Lee's School Daze and then again in Do the Right Thing where he co-starred as Radio Raheem. He went on to appear in films such as Sister Act, Mo' Better Blues, Regarding Henry, Money Train, Extreme Measures and He Got Game.

He appeared in all three of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies, playing Robbie Robertson, the sometimes friend but most time exasperated colleague of JK Simmons' J. Jonah Jameson.

Nunn had developed cancer in recent years and is survived by his wife and two children. Spike Lee took to Instagram to pay tribute to his friend and collaborator.
