        "text": "During Black History Month, with the series 28 Black stories in 28 days, USA TODAY Sports examines the issues, challenges and opportunities Black athletes and sports officials face after the nation’s reckoning on race in 2020.\n\nIn its purest form, scouting is a matter of interpretation, Bill Nunn Jr. declared to me more than a decade ago when prodded for insight into his legend.\n\nNunn recalled the directive from Chuck Noll as they went about building the Pittsburgh Steelers dynasty of the 1970s: “Hey Bill, find the athletes!”\n\nOf course, what may have sounded simple had dynamic layers of complexity.\n\n“You can have two people look at the same player and see two different things,” Nunn said during an expanded interview at his office at the Steelers headquarters in 2008 as the personnel guru worked in semiretirement — and the nation was poised to elect Barack Obama as its first Black president.\n\n“It’s how you look at it, \"Nunn added. \"For years, the approach was, ‘If you’re Black, you’re too dumb.' You couldn’t play offensive line. You had to play defense. You had to be ‘smart' to play offense.\n\n“Well, most of the time, offensive linemen were the worst athletes on the team. So it depends on how you interpret things. You can make judgments any way you want. I mean, for somebody to call this (woman) from Alaska (Sarah Palin) smart enough to be vice president tells you all you need to know about anything in America. ... So it’s how you want to perceive something.”\n\nThat quick flashback of non-politically correct candor from Nunn illustrated some keep-it-real perspective that must have made him a gem in the draft war room meetings. Nunn, who died in 2014 at 89, served 18 years as Pittsburgh’s assistant personnel director, then 23 years as a semiretired scout. Last month the Pittsburgh native was elected for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He will be the first Black person in the Hall’s history enshrined as a contributor, an honor way overdue when considering the achievements.\n\nNunn, whose wife, Frances, died in August shortly after the scouting icon was named a Hall finalist, will be represented for induction by his daughter, Lynell Nunn. His son, actor Bill Nunn III, whose most famous role was “Radio Raheem” in Spike Lee’s classic film “Do The Right Thing,” died in 2016. Nunn is also survived by three grandchildren (Matthew, Jessica and Cydney) and a great granddaughter (Jordan).\n\n“The fact that he’ll be the first African American contributor after his whole career was based on inclusion and diversity ... would have meant the world to him,” Lynell Nunn told USA TODAY Sports. “That makes it so special.\"\n\nNot only did Nunn play a vital role behind the curtain for a franchise that won four Super Bowls in six years, emboldened by the NFL’s greatest draft class ever in 1974, he had a huge impact in establishing a pipeline of talent flowing from historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). That the three other defensive linemen alongside Mean Joe Greene on the famed “Steel Curtain” unit came from HBCUs (Dwight White, Ernie Holmes and L.C. Greenwood) is but one measure. Before Nunn joined the Steelers in 1967 (full time in 1969), he was the sports writing savant for the Pittsburgh Courier who selected its annual All-Black College Football squad.\n\nKey role in Steelers dynasty\n\nThat all-star team from the leading voice of the Black press was held in such regard that, during an era which pales in sophistication when compared to the predraft prep today, legend has it that then-New York Giants owner Wellington Mara had the Courier in his hand as he instructed underlings to draft tackle Roosevelt Brown in the first round in 1952 — merely because Nunn had the Morgan State product on his first team. Brown became a Hall of Famer. Same for Deacon Jones.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams drafted Jones in the 14th round in 1961, acting on a tip from Nunn. The Rams learned from Nunn that Jones was a major talent hidden away for his final college season at Mississippi Vocational College (now Mississippi Valley State) who had sat out a year after South Carolina State revoked his scholarship because he participated in a civil rights protest.\n\nNunn’s credibility was bolstered by a vast HBCU network — he used information culled from coaches and players in choosing his All-Black College teams, in addition to firsthand observations gained by covering games — that was nothing less than personal. When prominent Black coaches and athletes visited Pittsburgh during the 1950s and 1960s, unable to stay at downtown hotels because of segregation, many stayed at his residence. And he grew up seeing his father, Bill G. Nunn Sr., help the Steelers secure lodging for Black players when the team traveled to the Jim Crow South.\n\n“It was always interesting to hear the stories from Bill, especially about the history of Black athletes,” Greene told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nAfter finishing his Hall of Fame playing career, Greene worked for years as a Steelers scout — getting an earful from Nunn about the nuances of footwork when evaluating talent.\n\n“When I was scouting, Bill was probably in his 70s or 80s,” Greene recalled. “He told me, ‘Joe, you know I’m retired. But I still come to work. I’m needed around here!’ ”\n\nIt is so revealing that Nunn pretty much worked to the end. Three weeks before his death, Nunn collapsed while sitting in the back of the room during a draft meeting as the personnel staff discussed prospects. He had suffered a stroke.\n\n“You just learned from him every day, up to his last day with us,” Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nWhen Colbert joined the team in 2000 as director of football operations, Nunn had been “retired” for 13 years but was still evaluating college draft prospects. Colbert used to tease Nunn that he worked longer as a part-time employee than as a full-timer.\n\n“He was great with, ‘Hey, you guys might want to think about this,’ ” Colbert said. “ ‘Did you talk about this with this player?’ It was always welcomed by the room. When Bill talked, everybody listened.”\n\nTell me about it. I sought to interview Nunn because I wanted to learn more about the history and impact of the Black press during the 1930s and 1940s — a period that included the NFL’s infamous “color barrier” and the reintegration of pro football in 1946, which cracked the door for Black players but hardly moved the needle like Jackie Robinson did the following year with the Brooklyn Dodgers in MLB. Nunn grew up with the Courier, ultimately growing into the role of managing editor that his father served at the paper based in the Homestead area of Pittsburgh.\n\nFighting segregated America\n\nNewspapers such as the Chicago Defender and the Baltimore Afro-American played a key advocacy role in a largely segregated America, addressing social issues and general topics relating to Black people that the mainstream press ignored. In its heyday the Courier, distributed nationwide, had a circulation in excess of 400,000, a huge reach at the time.\n\n“The Courier fought a lot of causes, all these integration things, the whole bit,” Nunn recalled. “It was almost the thing that helped put us out of business. We had our presses, the line and type operators, and all of the sudden we got big enough that the unions came in and we had to start paying those union wages. Our guys were making the same thing as the guys downtown (at the mainstream Pittsburgh Post-Gazette). What went on with that, you had to get the advertising, and we couldn’t get the advertising if you’re giving Ford and the department stores hell for not hiring Blacks. Yet we were paying union wages to the pressmen, the line and type operators, the truck drivers. That’s the way they killed you.”\n\nNunn’s impact on NFL history, though, lives on. Many have heard the classic case of John Stallworth, drafted in the fourth round in 1974 from Alabama A&M.\n\nThink the former receiver hasn’t been asked about it 20,000 times over the years? “At least that many,” Stallworth told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nIt’s worth repeating.\n\nNunn was among several scouts who descended on the A&M campus in Huntsville for Stallworth’s predraft workout. It was a dreary, rainy day, which contributed to Stallworth clocking at 4.7 seconds in the 40-yard dash — on a muddy field. Yet after watching the film on Stallworth that coaches provided, Nunn apparently became \"ill\" and urged the scouts from the other teams to head to their next tour stop without him. He also kept the film, promising to make copies to distribute to the other scouts.\n\n“I never got the film,” John Wooten, a Dallas Cowboys scout at the time, told USA TODAY Sports. “He never shared anything with anyone.”\n\nWooten remembers that he was the next scout in line to watch the Stallworth film.\n\n“I came in right behind him,” Wooten said.\n\nWooten said that he called Nunn multiple times in the ensuing weeks for a copy, only to get excuses.\n\n“That’s why every school now sends the film to NFL Films, and they copy it and distribute it to the teams,” Wooten said. “Bill was the reason for that.”\n\nBeyond the film caper, Nunn stayed in town and had Stallworth run the 40 — on a dry field.\n\n“I didn’t know that anything was out of the ordinary,” Stallworth, summoned for a follow-up session with the Steelers scout, reflected for USA TODAY Sports. “I just didn’t know. I’m not reading between the lines.”\n\nWhat was that next-day 40 time?\n\n“He never told me what the time was,” Stallworth said. “But I ran a 4.55 when I got to training camp — which they said was the fastest time of anybody in camp.”\n\nNoll considered drafting Stallworth in the first round but was persuaded by Nunn to wait because the receiver would be available later. The Steelers proceeded to take Lynn Swann in the first round and used the same logic in passing on Stallworth in the second round, when they took linebacker Jack Lambert. Pittsburgh didn’t have a third-round pick, then pounced on Stallworth in the fourth round. What a coup.\n\nThe Steelers drafted four Hall of Famers in 1974, including fifth-round center Mike Webster. And they signed an undrafted safety from an HBCU school as a free agent rookie, Donnie Shell, who wound up in the Hall of Fame, too.\n\nSaid Stallworth: \"If Bill chooses to leave with the other scouts and not come back and retime me, if he chooses not to hold on to the film, I’m not a Pittsburgh Steeler. My life changes. My life is different.”\n\n'Bill was that person for me'\n\nWhat many may not know about Nunn’s impact on Stallworth is what happened after the rookie arrived in Pittsburgh. Stallworth said he didn’t have a single player or coach from A&M who could help with his adjustment to the next level.\n\n“Bill was that person for me,” Stallworth said. Nunn mentored him, even calling him in the evenings after practice with pointers.\n\nThat’s part of the Nunn legacy that can be overlooked. He not only spotted talent, he bolstered chemistry and personal development.\n\nShell knows. On top of scouting, Nunn for years served as the Steelers’ camp director. In 1977, Nunn approached Shell and asked if he had issue with being assigned an undrafted rookie as his camp roommate. Enter Tony Dungy, who was trying to stick as a safety after playing quarterback in college. Nunn thought they’d be a good match.\n\nYears later, Shell was Dungy’s best man.\n\nIt seems that everyone who has ever crossed paths with Nunn has a memorable episode that has stuck over the years. And not just those from the Steelers universe.\n\nJerry Hardaway had a 23-year career as an NFL scout, primarily working the East Coast for the Cardinals. Nunn typically took young scouts — even those from other teams — under his wing. The day Hardaway met him, Nunn opted to ride with Hardaway to attend a pro day workout at Holy Cross.\n\nHardaway missed the exit. Nunn didn’t notice as he smoked cigarettes, drank coffee and read a newspaper. Then came the sign, “Welcome to Maine” and the flashing lights of a police cruiser.\n\n“What have you done?” Nunn exclaimed, according to Hardaway’s recollection, as the officer approached the car from the passenger side. “Don’t say (anything)!”\n\nThe officer: “Excuse me. Your son is going kind of fast.”\n\nNunn: “We’re supposed to be going to Holy Cross, but I think this boy is taking me to hell! You know how it is with these damn whipper-snappers.”\n\nRather than a citation, Nunn and Hardaway got a police escort across the median and redirected to the school.\n\nThey went to Holy Cross to see a particular quarterback and were gone in minutes.\n\n“Bill looked at him throw a couple passes and said, ‘Let’s go,’ ” Hardaway recalled for USA TODAY Sports.\n\nGreene can tell you how he met Nunn while still living on the North Texas State campus shortly after he was drafted fourth overall by the Steelers in 1969. As usual, he had left his apartment door unlocked. He walked in and was stunned to see Nunn sitting on his sofa. “He was smoking his favorite Kit cigarettes,” Greene remembers. “Him and another guy.”\n\nColbert met Nunn during the early 1970s when his high school coach, Ron Hughes, worked as a part-time scout for the Steelers and invited him to training camp. Colbert said that when Hughes went on to head the Detroit Lions personnel department, he implemented many of Nunn’s philosophies.\n\n“I remind people that Bill was not only a great scout with the HBCUs, but he was a great scout and had so much respect and great relations at every level,” Colbert said. “The first time I ever spent a day with him on the road was at Boston College.”\n\nAh, the stories. There was the time when Nunn, coming out of high school, was poised to attend Long Island University.\n\n“I was within two weeks of going to LIU,” Nunn recalled, \"when my father walked in and said, ‘I’ve had a change of mind. I don’t think you’re ready for New York. You don’t know anything about Black people. You need to go to a Black school for two years.’ ”\n\nNunn rebelled. He had attended integrated schools in Pittsburgh.\n\n“I said, ‘I’m not going to a Black school,’ ” Nunn remembered. “He said, ‘Fine. Where are you going to live?’ He didn’t say, ‘You’re not going to LIU.’ He said you can go out and get a job and start paying to live here. I went out and got a job for a year.”\n\nNunn worked at Union Switch and Signal, then ultimately relented and decided to attend an HBCU, West Virginia State.\n\nThroughout his entire schooling in Pittsburgh, he never had a Black teacher. “None. Zippo,” Nunn said.\n\nHe said the first Black teacher he ever saw was on his first day at West Virginia State.\n\n“It was one of the best things that ever happened to me,” Nunn said. “If I had gone to LIU, I might have ended up on the Bowery.”\n\nColbert, like others, loved hearing the stories from Nunn. He suggested that Nunn should write a book about his life. Nunn dismissed that idea.\n\nAs Colbert remembers it, Nunn told him, “Naw, I ain’t writing no book.”\n\nThankfully, the book on Bill Nunn will have a crowning achievement reflected with a Hall of Fame bust."
