        "text": "PITTSBURGH -- The black-and-white backstage photos of parents, children, stagehands, celebrities and musicians capture the essence of performance.\n\nThe nerves and excitement, the preparation and achievement, are all there in the intimate portraits snapped by the late Charles “Teenie” Harris and now on display at the Carnegie Museum of Art.\n\n“The behind-the-scenes photos pack a different punch,” Teenie Harris Archive Specialist Charlene Foggie-Barnett said.\n\n“Teenie Harris Photographs: Great Performances” portrays performances of all kinds produced and experienced by Pittsburgh’s African-American community from about 1935 to 1975. The Carnegie Museum of Art’s exhibit, “Teenie Harris Photographs: Great Performances Offstage” celebrates behind-the-scenes-type photographs. Over at the August Wilson Center in Pittsburgh, another exhibit, “Teenie Harris: Great Performances Onstage,” is on display, featuring 50 photos.\n\n“You asked why performances? Because he took a lot of images of performances,” said Jonathan Gaugler, media relations manager at the Carnegie Museum of Art.\n\nOn display until July 17, the museum’s exhibit features 25 photos, capturing backstage moments of preparation and performance.\n\n“It takes a lot of people to put on productions,” Foggie-Barnett said.\n\nShe added that the common man, as well as stars, like Lena Horne and Duke Ellington, are highlighted in the exhibit. One of those stars is Count Basie, standing with Joe Jones and William Bell Graham, holding a trophy inscribed “Count Basie, King of Pittsburgh Courier Band Contest, 1942” at a Pittsburgh Courier dance in Wheeling, W.Va., in February 1942.\n\n“Look at all the fingerprints,” she said, pointing to the trophy.\n\nAnother is a portrait of Patricia Prattis (Jennings) at home playing the piano with her music book opened to “Dark Eyes” circa 1946 to 1949, one of Foggie-Barnett’s favorites. Patricia went on to become a principal keyboardist for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.\n\nOther photos on display include:\n\nMembers of the Junior Mothers Association wearing dance costumes for a revue in 1961. “These are real women, real mothers,” Foggie-Barnett said.\n\nSinger and actor Ethel Waters seated backstage in costume in 1940.\n\nActor Fredi Washington in a dressing room in 1940.\n\nSgt. William H. Carney VFW Post 48 band in front of a drug store in the Hill District in the 1940s.\n\nThree men in Egyptian costumes posing backstage at the Syria Mosque for the National Negro Opera Company performance of “Aida” on Oct. 30, 1941.\n\nDuke Ellington at the Stanley Theatre.\n\nThe museum’s exhibit also includes a video by filmmaker Gregory Scott Williams Jr. that includes work with the Bill Nunn Theatre Outreach Project.\n\nOver at the August Wilson Center on Liberty Avenue, images of men singing, scenes from “Aida,” a magician performing a card trick and more round out the “Greatest Performances Onstage” portion.\n\nFoggie-Barnett said most of Teenie’s work was for the Pittsburgh Courier, where he worked both as a freelance and staff photographer. He rarely took more than one or two images of each scene or portrait, and a lot of his photos are candid, rather than posed, a detail Foggie-Barnett said is the defining thing about his photos.\n\n“You feel like you’re with these people,” Foggie-Barnett said, pointing to a photograph. “Teenie didn’t get in their way. He was so professional and so fast.”\n\nShe added, “He always got the shot.”\n\nIn 2011, the Carnegie Museum of Art produced a large retrospective on Teenie that had just under one thousand images. After that, the museum has used the lobby gallery space, which houses the current exhibit, for Teenie.\n\n“A lot of people move through this space every day,” Gaugler said.\n\nFoggie-Barnett added, “They don’t have to go find it. It’s a good space for conversation.”\n\nIn addition to the retrospective, the museum has dedicated Teenie exhibits to cars, hair, sports, civil rights, and now, performances.\n\n“His impact has grown. It’s grown more the farther we get away from these shots,” Foggie-Barnett said.\n\nAs with the other museum-hosted Teenie Harris shows, there is a guest curator for “Great Performances”: Actor Bill Nunn, a Hill District native. Nunn’s grandfather, Bill Nunn Sr., was an editor for the Pittsburgh Courier, while his father was a recruiter for the Pittsburgh Steelers under the Rooneys. Nunn’s acting background includes theater, film and television. “We wanted someone who was a 'triple threat,' let’s say,” Foggie-Barnett said.\n\nIn the midst of a battle with cancer, Nunn sorted through hundreds of images to select the final photos for the exhibit. “We’re very fortunate he was able to screen the photographs,” Gaugler said.\n\nThere are nearly 80,000 images in the archive at the Carnegie Museum of Art. Most are scanned in but they still have 15- to 20,000 to still scan. They’ve spent up to the last 20 years working on the photos, starting with the film.\n\n“There’s professional and there’s personal and Teenie took it all,” Foggie-Barnett said. She herself was one of Teenie’s many subjects, having been photographed by him from 3 months to age 26 or 27.\n\nThe archive team interviews people and looks at the Pittsburgh Courier archives to use cutlines to match to photos. “We’re not just finding out the stars. We want to know who these kids are,” Foggie-Barnett said. “So we have to look at ears and hairlines, jaws and teeth. … Wallpaper, drapes.\n\n“There are so many fascinating stories. Every day we learn so much. They’re all negatives except for a few prints. We don’t take in originals,” Foggie-Barnett said. “We know these are Teenie’s because he brought them here.”"
