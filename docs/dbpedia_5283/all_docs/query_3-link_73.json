        "text": "Carter has seven siblings and originally studied special ed\n\nBorn in Springfield, Mass., Carter is the youngest of eight (five brothers and two sisters) and was raised by a single mother. Her artistic brother Robert inspired her to start sketching and she would copy all of his pencil drawings. (“I don’t know what behooved me to do that; he’d say, ‘Pretty good, OK, mine’s better!” said Carter.)\n\nAttending Hampton University in Virginia, Carter was originally a special education major “because I wanted to learn sign language and work for the theater for the deaf,” she said, noting that she later switched her major to theater and became known as \"the costume designer\" on campus. Before landing at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, she drove cross country in her Volkswagen Rabbit to intern for the Santa Fe Opera in New Mexico, where she decided that, rather than sew, she “wanted to present my illustrations and have a team of people build them.”\n\nCarter dedicated her Academy Award on Feb. 24 to her 97-year-old mother, saying, “You are the original superhero.”\n\nShe first met Spike Lee in the mid-'80s at Lula Washington's Dance Theatre\n\nStarting out in Hollywood as a backstage dresser at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, Carter met Madge Sinclair and Moses Gunn and eventually “talked her way up” to become foreman of the costume shop. She then landed a freelance gig as costume designer for Lula Washington’s Dance Theatre on Adams Street in downtown L.A.\n\n“They were performing to the music of Stevie Wonder and Spike was brought to see that performance with Robi Reed and she introduced us,” said Carter. “Spike was not known then; he had just done She’s Gotta Have It but it hadn’t gotten anywhere yet. He kept asking me about my experience with film, and I had none, so he said, ‘Go to USC or UCLA and sign up in the film studies department to work on someone’s senior thesis project.’ So I did a film for a USC student.”\n\nThen Carter got a phone call at work and a male voice said, “Ruth, this is the man of your dreams!” Carter said: “It was the ‘80s and I responded, ‘Denzel?!’ He said, ‘No, this is Spike. I want you to do my next movie, School Daze.’ So I quit my job and I started sketching and drawing.”\n\n'Bed-Stuy' was misspelled as 'Bed-Sty' on Radio Raheem's iconic T-shirt\n\nCarter emphasizes how amazing it is that the context of her second film with Lee in 1989, Do the Right Thing, still holds up. ”The young kids see it now and they love it, because it deals with garments of protest and with the neighborhood and the strife and struggle of what young black men face in their community.”\n\nBack then, Lee was known in the fashion community for loving Nikes and selling tube socks on the street corner to help fund his films. In terms of costuming, Carter says: “We wanted to show the sense of a neighborhood and pop culture and all the colors of Afro-future culture within this African diaspora in Brooklyn. I imported a local artist, NaSha, to paint Radio Raheem’s ‘Bed Stuy Do or Die’ shirt. But when we painted it the first time, we spelled ‘Bed-Stuy’ wrong as ‘Bed-Sty' and they had already shot it, so we had to look at the footage and redo the T-shirt!\"\n\nLee wore the famed \"Love\" and \"Hate\" knuckle rings at the 91st Academy Awards.\n\nCarter likens the 'Malcolm X' zoot suits to drop-crotch pants\n\nSpike Lee called upon Carter again in 1992 for Malcolm X, earning her her first Academy Awards costume design nomination and making history as the first black woman nominated in the category. Lee's first words to Carter were: “We’re going to do Malcom X next, but I don’t want you to think about an Oscar; just do a good job.”\n\nZoot suits were a focal point to tell “the origin of this man who eventually became a national speaker and leader for the nation of Islam,” Carter said. “It was also known as hoodlum fashion; they had zoot suit wars…. I like to liken it to guys with drop-crotch pants. It’s the same psychology.”\n\nThe poker-chip dresses she fashioned for 'Sparkle' weighed 10 pounds each\n\nLoosely based on the looks sported by The Supremes during their 1960s-era Detroit heyday, the costumes in Salim Akil’s 2012 film Sparkle were inspired by avant-garde L.A. fashion designer Rudi Gernreich (known for his use of cutouts and vinyl) and Paco Rabanne’s iconic '60s Rhodoid dresses composed of metal-linked plastic discs that he referred to as “the unwearables.”\n\nCarter said: “I made three poker-chip dresses out of big gems that I bought in downtown [L.A.] and those dresses weighed like 10 pounds each, so the [actresses] had to walk very carefully!”\n\nCarter sided With Oprah Winfrey in an argument With Lee Daniels\n\nFor Lee Daniels’ 2013 film The Butler (the story of Eugene Allen, who worked at the White House for 34 years) there was “a revolving door of celebrities coming through the costume department and I had to ready each one with research to show them,” said Carter, citing Oprah Winfrey and Jane Fonda, who was outfitted in Chanel looks from renowned vintage shop The Paper Bag Princess in L.A., as specific stars.\n\n“We started out one way and this was the first time I’d worked with Oprah (every woman has the things she likes and she never was very pushy), but by the time we finished, her costume was a little different than how it started out,” Carter said, laughing. “It’s all good. We really had fun creating this character. Lee Daniels wanted her to wear curlers to the bus station when they see their son off to school. And Oprah said, ‘This is the butler’s wife; she would never be at the station in curlers!’ Lee just would not back down, but I finally convinced him to let Oprah wear her hair down in the scarf, because they were pillars in their community. And she could not believe that I was able to convince him over her. So I like my job at times!”\n\nShe created a 'Black Panther' headpiece from a Pier 1 placemat\n\n”I was determined to have the Maasai warrior’s headpiece in [Black Panther],” said Carter. “In the comic, it’s worn by an elder, and Ryan didn’t want the elders to have this headpiece, so I thought it was a great opportunity to use it in the Warrior Falls scene. We didn’t have time to have a beader make it, so we went to Pier 1 and got a placemat and cut a hole in it. That thing was hard to cut! And then my craftsperson did all the featherwork and I painted it. So we got it in there!”\n\nThen she shaved 150 South African Basotho blankets\n\n“Ryan really wanted them to have these blankets close off their costumes because he wanted them to have this moment of reveal, where they push the blankets back and you see their weaponry and they go into battle,” said Carter of her work on Black Panther. “Ryan felt he couldn’t really do the Black Panther story without having gone to Africa, so he went and spent some time with the Basotho people [in Lesotho] and he fell in love with these blankets and I see why — they’re beautiful.”\n\nHaving purchased 150 Basotho blankets from South Africa and “stamped [the fictional metal] vibranium on one side to make them like shields for the warriors,” Carter said, the blankets were inevitably screen-tested by Marvel as too thick and unusable. So one of Carter’s assistants spent hours shaving each one of the 150 blankets with a men’s shaver to get it right.\n\nAnd here's her solution to prevent superheroes from ripping their pants\n\nFor T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) “we made muscle suits with silver Vibranium [the fictional strongest substance known to man] and the top skin is very thin so you can see the silver illuminating through this top layer; then we added surface texture that was a little triangle, which is part of the African landscape in terms of art and part of their sacred geometry of mother-father-child,” said Carter.\n\nMichael B. Jordan’s supervillain Erik Killmonger “has gold that bleeds through the top layer, but his helmet wasn’t gold enough, so we hand-painted the top and front that day on set,” Carter said.\n\nThe innovative superhero suits were ultimately too thin. “It was embarrassing; they were blowing their pants every time they did a kick!” said Carter, who ended up making the stuntmen’s versions thicker with gussets, thanks to a staff member from the Boston Ballet who was familiar with the needs of dancers and came up with a design solution.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misidentified the name of Bill Nunn's character in Do the Right Thing."
