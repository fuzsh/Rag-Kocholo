        "text": "For more than half a century, Trevor Nunn has directed Elizabethan tragedies and contemporary comedies, heady literary adaptations and at least one roller-skating fantasia. He was the youngest-ever artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company and later ran London’s National Theater. He wrote the lyrics to “On My Own” from “Les Misérables.” He was integral in shaping “Cats.”\n\nIt might seem that, at 76, Mr. Nunn (who was knighted a decade ago but won’t answer to Sir) has done it all. Not quite.\n\n“Pericles,” which opens at Theater for a New Audience on Thursday, is the 35th play out of 37 by Shakespeare that Mr. Nunn has directed. He has plans for the other two: “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” which he’ll direct in Ipswich, England, and “King John.” (Though many scholars would add “The Two Noble Kinsmen” to that list, it didn’t make it into any of the folios, so it doesn’t make Mr. Nunn’s cut.) Though he has brought a bevy of shows to Broadway, this is his first time working from the ground up with an American cast.\n\nIt is not a job Mr. Nunn takes sitting down.\n\nAt a recent rehearsal at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Downtown Brooklyn, he’d placed his chair directly onstage, facing a backdrop of swirling blue that resembled a sumptuous whirlpool. That chair went unused. Instead, Mr. Nunn strode back and forth, gesturing expansively, circling his actors in a heavy-footed dance. He pressed two of them into a tighter embrace and showed a third how to descend a set of stairs. Even when he stood still, he didn’t, rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet.\n\n“Pericles,” the tale of a seafaring prince who experiences unfathomable loss and unlooked-for redemption, has its problems. Its authorship is debated, its syntax elaborate, its language awkward, its tonal shifts perplexing. Mr. Nunn, speaking after a long day’s rehearsal, described it jokingly as “a total mess.” Accordingly, he has moved some scenes around and borrowed passages from a related prose work by George Wilkins, Shakespeare’s likely collaborator on the play.\n\nMr. Nunn believes in doing whatever he can to get a story across. His style, which seeks out the immediate, the accessible, the real in any text, has hardly changed since his student days. (Neither, it seems has his look: a denim shirt paired with denim trousers, hair and beard still straggly and still dark.) He works closely and collaboratively with his actors, but his first duty is always to the story.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
