        "text": "I thought I’d do my own video analysis, using a scene from Spike Lee’s 80s classic, Do the Right Thing.\n\nI guess I’m looking at it more as an artist than a film scholar, but that’s my background. An interesting thing about it is that actor Bill Nunn’s speech is lifted almost verbatim from Robert Mitchum in Night of the Hunter.\n\nI don’t think I’d try to make any kind of connection between the two otherwise, but I could see it as Spike Lee staking a claim in film history.\n\nTo put this together, I grabbed the clip from Youtube using a Firefox extension. I opened it up in MPEG Streamclip, exported some frames and trimmed the clip. I scrolled through it a couple times and wrote up some thoughts, then recorded a voiceover in Audacity. I used Audacity to clean up my voice and amplify it a bit, then I imported all the parts into iMovie. I used my frame grabs and the Modify=>Freeze Frame function in iMovie in parts. It looks like iMovie brightens the image or MPEG Streamclip darkens it, so that bit about yin and yang isn’t really visible. I used Cmd-B to make some splits in the video and the voiceover so I could get the parts aligned right and adjust the volume of the video. I uploaded to Vimeo just in case Youtube was going to give me static. Took 22 minutes to upload a 3 minute video. I think it actually sort of came out okay. I’ve got a long way to go before I’m at the Tony Zhou level though"
