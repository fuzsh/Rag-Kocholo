        "text": "Rest in Peace: Actor Bill Nunn Dead at 62\n\nActor Bill Nunn, best known for his role as Radio Raheem in Spike Lee’s seminal classic, Do the Right Thing, died this weekend at the age of 62. Lee confirmed the news on social media, calling Nunn “a dear friend.” Nunn and Lee had a long working relationship outside of their friendship, with the actor appearing in Lee films, School Daze, Mo’ Better Blues, and He Got Game. In recent years, Nunn was recognized best as J. Jonah Jameson’s right hand man “Robbie” Robertson in Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy and as “Cash” in the USA comedy Sirens. Nunn was a diverse actor who could play comedy and drama with equal skill, and he was truly one of the most talented character actors of his generation.\n\n(Instagram)\n\nMonty Python’s Terry Jones Reveals Rare Form of Dementia\n\nMonty Python director Terry Jones has been diagnosed with a rare form of dementia, preventing him from being able to communicate. The news was announced by a representative following an award by BAFTA Cymru for outstanding contribution to film and television. Best known for direction Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian, and The Meaning of Life, the news of his health decline puts an effective end to a career that has spanned decades. Over the weekend, many of his Monty Python cohorts expressed sadness at the news, with Michael Palin writing on Facebook that “the progress of his dementia has been painful to watch.” Still, Palin did not that, despite not being able to communicate, Jones’ mental faculties seem present, and that he “smiles, laughs, recognizes, and responds” during their frequent lunches.\n\n(Facebook)\n\n‘Magnum P.I.’ Sequel Planned for ABC\n\nABC has picked up a script commitment for a sequel to the classic 80’s series Magnum P.I., said to follow the detective’s daughter. Eva Longoria’s production company, UnbeliEVAble Entertainment, is producing the series alongside Leverage creator John Rogers. While still in the early stages, the series will follow Lily “Tommy” Magnum who comes back to Hawaii to take over her father’s investigation firm. No word yet on whether Tom Selleck will make an appearance in the role that catapulted him to stardom.\n\n(Deadline)\n\nTrailer for Ava DuVernay’s Powerful New Documentary Released\n\nAva DuVernay, who’s currently at working on her adaptation of the children’s classic A Wrinkle in Time, released the first trailer for her documentary, The 13th, which premieres on Netflix and in a limited theatrical release on October 7. The film looks at the ascent of the prison industrial complex here in America, and how the supposed land of the free became the home of the highest rate of imprisonment in the entire world. Specifically, the director looks at how the prison system in the United States adversely affects the black community, looking back upon the patterns of fear and mistrust that have beset the nation since the days of slavery. The 13th garnered powerful reviews after the New York Film Festival, and it’s limited theatrical run puts it in contention for an Academy Award next year.\n\n(YouTube)\n\n‘The Magnificent Seven’ Shoots Down ‘Sully’ at the Box Office\n\nSully’s run at box office dominance was ended this weekend thanks to Antoine Fuqua and his remake of The Magnificent Seven. The remake debuted at $35 million dollars, soaring over Sully’s $13.8 third place landing, behind the family film, Storks at $21.8 million. Rounding out the top five were Bridget Jones’s Baby at $4.5 million and Oliver Stone’s Snowden at $4.1 million, both of which saw significant declines in their take following their openings last week. For the full top ten, see below.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven-$35 million\n\nStorks-$21.8 million\n\nSully-$13.8 million\n\nBridget Jones’s Baby-$4.5 Million\n\nSnowden-$4.1 million\n\nBlair Witch-$3.9million\n\nDon’t Breathe-$3.8 million\n\nSuicide Squad-$3.1 million\n\nWhen the Bough Breaks-$2.5 million\n\nKubo and the Two Strings-$1.1 million"
