        "text": "Def by Temptation (1990) is an urban horror movie starring Bill Nunn, Samuel L. Jackson and Kadeem Hardison of the Cosby Show and White Men Can’t Jump, the guy always wearing those flip-up sunglasses draped down his nose, thinking he’s super cool. You know, I don’t think there’s any Troma movie I’ve ever liked but this one is an exception. Technically, they only distributed the thing, so maybe that’s why. The story centers around some guys dealing with an evil, demonic succubus, and it features an interesting trend of DANGEROUS women on-screen, seen in other movies of the late 80s and 90s. Cynthia Bond plays a sleazy-ass temptress, hoping to show us how the heathens really get down in the big city.\n\nThis film is full of Spike Lee alums. James Bond wrote and directed this film, and he recruited all the Spike Lee regulars after working with them in school and on Lee’s film Go Tell It on the Mountain. Bond had a long, long career as a child actor and he had a really amazing talent for networking, which was useful for him on this movie because he got a great cinematographer and sound mixer for cheap. Bond must have used up all his resources and contacts on this one because he never made another movie. Too bad. At least the soundtrack and cinematography are good. Bond uses some recognizable African American names and faces around that time, including Bill Nunn, who makes a brief appearance as Hardison’s pal Dougie. His biggest role was in Do the Right Thing but he’s been in everything, including Sister Act, Raimi’s Spider-Man and more.\n\nHardison finally jumps into the story about 50 minutes in, when the succubus finds him at the bar. Smooth jazz plays in the background. The smoke machine cranks up to high. Hardison starts dancing with the demon and he barely gets away by using some dumb excuse, but she quickly moves on because she didn’t have lunch. She gets cozy with Hardison’s pal Joel, played by Bond himself. Joel is a minister in training, out visiting his friend in New York, and he has some great scenes with Hardison, where they contemplate just how much evil is hiding in the city. During one of these scenes, Bond edits in another scene of the succubus (in bed) ripping open a man with her nails, which is effective at being creepy. Hardison’s other pal Dougie takes him to a fortune teller, who tells them that this succubus lady is really dangerous and kind of like a demon thing, so that’s bad. Hardison and Dougie try to get rid of the succubus based on that advice, and drop some holy water into her drink when they find her in a bar again. She throws up. I guess she didn’t have a chaser.\n\nOverall, this a great movie. The dialogue is the best part, and outshines the horror and blood by a longshot. The lines often feel improvised, especially when Hardison and Bond are talking in many of the extended character scenes, and it’s really enjoyable to watch Hardison work with the rest of the small cast. Hardison was still a bigtime regular on A Different World around this time, and really commits to this smallass, cheap horror flick, giving it his all, so that shows you just how great he is. They had to have security for the guy, that’s how big he was. Bond and Hardison also worked on I’m Gonna Get You Sucka two years before, and they became great friends. It shows on screen. If you watch to the end, you’ll see that this movie is really a Catholic redemption story, as Joel uses with the power of God and his plastic cross to dispel the demon, with enough time left over to boogie down to some LL Cool J."
