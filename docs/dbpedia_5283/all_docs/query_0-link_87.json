        "text": "Goodbye, Radio Raheem. Bill Nunn, an actor known for his beloved role in Do the Right Thing, died on Saturday, September 24, filmmaker Spike Lee confirmed. He was 62.\n\n\"My Dear Friend, My Dear Morehouse Brother- Da Great Actor Bill Nunn As Most Of You Know Him As Radio Raheem Passed Away This Morning In His Hometown Of Pittsburgh,\" Lee, 59, wrote via Instagram. \"Long Live BILL NUNN. RADIO RAHEEM Is Now RESTING IN POWER. RADIO RAHEEM WILL ALWAYS BE FIGHTING DA POWERS DAT BE. MAY GOD WATCH OVER BILL NUNN.\"\n\nThroughout Nunn's career, he starred in several iconic films, including Sister Act, New Jack City, Mo' Better Blues and School Daze. He also famously played Joseph \"Robbie\" Robertson in the Spider-Man trilogy directed by Sam Raimi.\n\nLee, who produced, wrote and directed Do the Right Thing, posted a second tribute to the late actor via Instagram, sharing one of Radio Raheem's most memorable quotes from the controversial 1989 film. \"Let me tell you the story of Right Hand, Left Hands. It's a tale of good and evil,\" the director wrote before adding, \"Raheem I love you bruh.\"\n\nRadio Raheem famously wore \"Love\" and \"Hate\" brass knuckles in Do the Right Thing as he carried a boombox (playing Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\") while walking around Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.\n\nNunn is survived by his wife, Donna, and their two children. A cause of death is yet to be released."
