        "meta_description": "rantnrave:// There are some actors you just like. They're familiar and talented. The camera loves them. Sometimes you don't even know their names. But I knew BILL NUNN's name. As RADIO RAHEEM, he was the moral center of SPIKE LEE's 'DO THE RIGHT THING' talking about love and hate. His boombox blasted PUBLIC ENEMY's 'FIGHT THE POWER' and woke up a neighborhood and ultimately a nation. That film introduced me to a world I knew nothing about and it opened my eyes. Film, at its best, is a snapshot of a moment. Teaches us about ourselves and helps us understand with empathy. And it's a film that is so timely right now. Even 25 years later given the current political and social upheaval in the UNITED STATES. He was the face I remember most. Unforgettable. He portrayed the stuttering gangsta, DUH DUH DUH MAN in NEW JACK CITY alongside WESLEY SNIPES. And other great roles. Like my Mom and so many others, he passed away from cancer. He will be missed. Condolences to family, friends, collaborators and fans. R.I.P. 2016 took away a lot of unique artists from us... If I could pick a debate moderator it would be BRIAN STELTER instead of all these lightweights. That said, I love the guy, so I don't wish it on him... We're two seasons into immediately shoppable runways -- so how's it going? Here's the early word on the execution and effectiveness of 'see now buy now' fashion shows. Our new FashionREDEF SET: Is Anybody Shopping 'See Now, Buy Now' Runways?... Randoms: Want some OXYCONTIN in your doughnuts?... And then there's this: ' The Final Countdown’ Played on 64 Floppy Drives, 8 Hard Drives, and 2 Scanners'... SAN FRANCISCO's leaning tower of PISA?... I'd actually wear the  STORMTROOPER suit... Happy Birthday to AVNER RONEN, DAVID LEVITSKY and ERIC ALEXANDER.",
