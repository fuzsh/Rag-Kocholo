Radio Raheem will always be fighting da powers dat be,\" wrote Mr Lee. \"May god watch over Bill Nunn.\"\n\nMr Nunn, who played Robbie Robertson in the Spider Man trilogy directed by Sam Raimi, made his debut in Mr Lee's 1988 film School Daze.\n\nHe also starred in He Got Game and Mo' Better Blues, both directed by Mr Lee, and held supporting roles alongside Whoopi Goldberg in Sister Act and Harrison Ford in Regarding Henry.\n\nBut it is the boombox-wielding character Radio Raheem – who dies at the hands of a police officer – for which he is best remembered.\n\nIn another Instagram post, Mr Lee posted a picture of the trainers worn by Mr Nunn in character as Radio Raheem, \"as he was murdered by the NYPD in the infamous Michael Stewart (1983) and Eric Gardner (2014) chokeholds. Rest in peace.\"\n\nEric Garner's death in 2014 sparked protests against police brutality in the US and Mr Garner's last words \"I can't breathe\" have become a slogan used by the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nMr Lee also wrote in a separate post: \"Radio Raheem. Let me tell you the story of Right Hand, Left Hand. It's a tale of good and evil.\n\n\"Hate! It was with this hand that Cane iced his brother. Love! These five fingers, they go straight to the soul of man.\"\n\n“Raheem I love you bruh...” he added, as Mr Nunn's fans posted their own tributes to the star on social media.\n\nWorld news in pictures\n\nShow all 50\n\n“L-O-V-E that performance, H-A-T-E this news. RIP Bill Nunn,” wrote Twitter user Leigh Singer.\n\n“Never stop fighting the power and always try to do the right thing,” wrote another user called Margena Christian.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
