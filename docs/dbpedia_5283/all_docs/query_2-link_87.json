        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) - Bill Nunn, a veteran character actor whose credits ranged from the \"Spider-Man\" movie franchise to such Spike Lee films as \"Do the Right Thing\" and \"He Got Game,\" has died.\n\nHis wife, Donna, said Nunn died Saturday at his home in Pittsburgh. He was 63 and had been battling cancer.\n\nNunn was the son of a prominent Pittsburgh Steelers scout, also named Bill Nunn, and was briefly a ballboy for the NFL team. He broke through in movies in the late 1980s, first in Lee's \"School Daze,\" then in the Oscar-nominated \"Do the Right Thing,\" as the ill-fated Radio Raheem, who dies when choked by police officers during a street brawl.\n\nNunn went on to appear in dozen of films and TV programs, including \"Spider-Man\" and \"Sister Act.\"\n\n(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
