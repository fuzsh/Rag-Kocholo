        "text": "The Wolf of Wall Street directed by, Martin Scorsese displays several standout performances by three of the main actors. I’d like to focus on the following roles consisting of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), and Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler). This film was based on a true story of Jordan Belfort’s life. In this film, Leonardo DiCaprio would be classified as an impersonator type of actor. An impersonator actor “is considered somewhat demeaning in the acting world, suggesting that the actor has simply copied the manner, dialect, and behavior of a character, instead of creating the character” (Goodykoontz, B., & Jacobs, C. P., Sec 3.4, Para 1, 2011). You can really tell DiCaprio invested himself in becoming Jordan Belfort and it definitely pays off in terms of believability during the film. His star power classification is clear due to his previous films but he took on a persona in this film. Therefore, impersonator fits his acting style in, The Wolf of Wall Street. The same can be said for Jonah Hill and Kyle Chandler. Both actors can be considered impersonator actors for the same reasons I listed for the films lead character, played by DiCaprio.\n\nThe reason I gave all the actors the classification of impersonators was because this is usually the case when you view a film based on real life events and people. An actor does his or her best to impersonate the person they’re playing the role of. The mannerisms, their essence, and tone of voice are just some characteristic actors pay particular attention to, taking on a role of character based on a true story. For example, both DiCaprio and Chandler are both in character during the “Get Off My Boat” scene. They’re not relying on their star power but instead of opting to stick to their character assignments.\n\nStylized acting shows when an actor is in fact, acting. The audience can identify with it and often right away. The problem with stylized acting is. “If you go too far over the top with it, it doesn’t just draw attention to itself, it can pull the audience out of the movie” (Goodykoontz, B., & Jacobs, C. P., Sec 3.7, Para 4, 2011). A perfect example of over the top acting was the opening scene of the movie where Belfort is sniffing a line of coke off of a woman’s buttocks. If you haven’t seen this film it is very vulgar. The over the top nature makes the film great but at the same time takes away from the story. When I discuss the film with anyone all they usually talk about is all the outlandish things Belfort did and not the quality of the film.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio would typically be considered a star actor. He’s also talented enough to play many other forms of acting styles while not relying on his star power. For example, in Titanic his style of acting can be considered interpretive. When an actor is considered to perform as an interpreter he or she is putting his or her own twist on the performance. In my opinion, this displays an actor’s true skill to improvise on a role and make it his or her own. The lines can blur when it comes to describing an actor as polished as DiCaprio. He can interpret in one film, impersonate in another, and also rely on his personality in some films to carry him through the performance. Leonardo DiCaprio is just one of those actors who cannot be put into a box via his acting style.\n\nReference:\n\nGoodykoontz, B., & Jacobs, C. P. (2011). Film: From Watching To Seeing.

These sounds shaped various scenes and overall feel of the movie. The music that was placed into scenes perfectly completed the message it intended to get across in three basic categories of sound (dialogue, sound effects, and music). Dialogue consists of the characters simply speaking to one another. Superior dialogue in a film comes off as natural conversation between characters. For example, there’s a part in the film where Mookie (Spike Lee) and Pino (John Tuturro) have a candid dialogue about race in the pizza shop. This is a very powerful scene because it brings revelation to Pino’s character and at the same time shows the compassion Mookie has for Pino’s contradictory feelings towards African Americans.\n\nThe sound effects in this film play a key factor into how it is received at sets the mood for a very important riot scene at Sal’s pizzeria towards the end of the film. The riot stemmed from Buggin’ Out, a character played by Giancarlo Esposito, boycotting Sal’s pizzeria because they weren’t any “black” faces (photos) on his wall at restaurant. There were only Italians photos on the wall. The actual riot scene included fire burning down the pizzeria to sense the realism of a burning building. There was also a garbage can that came crashing through the glass store front which also aided the mood to the scene as an aggressive one. I could tell there was no turning back from the chaos such an act would cause.\n\nMixtures of jazz and hip hop are heavily utilized as musical landscapes to Do the Right Thing. I want to point out a scene that really married the feeling of the scene with what was actually happening. The “Fight the Power” scene is a microcosm of society’s race tensions though the director Spike Lee’s eyes. A popular song by Public Enemy called, Fight the Power is playing at exceedingly loud levels as Radio Raheem and Buggin’ Out enter Sal’s pizzeria. Their aim is to protest the lack of “black” faces on Sal’s wall of fame. The song is playing throughout the scene as a form of protest until it is ultimately drowned out by Sal destroying the radio. All sorts of racial slurs are thrown back and forth between Sal, his sons, and Buggin’ Out’s crew. I believe this was the directors way of showing the angst the African American customers had from not being acknowledged by Sal. The very neighborhood/people Sal shunned was the same people who supported his livelihood.\n\nThis film is near and dear to my heart because it was filmed approximately one block away from my home in Brooklyn, New York. Every aspect of sound definitely solidified the authenticity of the film. No matter where my travels take me in life, if I shut my eyes the use of sound in this movie places me back in Brooklyn, New York. I remember watching this film numerous times with my Aunt and I can almost quote the entire movie. It was definitely a staple movie in my household growing up.\n\nReference:\n\nGoodykoontz, B., & Jacobs, C. P. (2011). Film: From Watching to Seeing.

Tony Montana comes from nothing. He’s from the bottom of the slums and doesn’t mind telling anyone who will listen that fact. Tony is starts out working for Frank Lopez and shrewdly guns his way to the top of the food chain as a crime boss. Tony is good at being a hoodlum so he climbs through the ranks quickly. So quickly, that his boss his subsequently taken out (see embedded clip) by Tony Montana himself. His sister and best friend Manny are his blind spots throughout the film. With that said, like all gangster’s his rise to the top is short lived. He goes out in a blaze of glory as another rival gangster guns him down to take his spot.\n\nThe film is presented in chronological manner. It shows Tony Montana’s meager beginners, his work as simple criminal, and rise to the top as a drug kingpin. This aesthetic use allowed the audience to be enamored with Tony’s rags to riches story. Most don’t care that he made money by selling drugs and killing people. Elements like character development or foreshadowing impacted the choice of storytelling methods because if the story is told any other way the audience wouldn’t have identified with his struggle and/or valued his principles. The chronological plot development helped viewers appreciate his very flawed character.\n\nThe criminalistic principles Tony Montana displays are that of legend. This movie has lived on through various forums over the last 31 years. Lines like “my balls and my word is all I have” have stood the test of time. I am heavily into hip-hop music and I can’t tell you how many times Tony Montana is referenced. For example, rap artist by the name of Future has a song called, Tony Montana and references numerous drug references and countless flaunting of making a lot of money.\n\nReference:\n\nMovie Clips (2011, Jul. 16).
