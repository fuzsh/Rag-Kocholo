He was 63 and had been battling cancer.\n\nA longtime Pittsburgh resident and graduate of Morehouse College, Lee's alma mater, Mr. Nunn broke through in movies in the late 1980s, first in Lee's School Daze, then in the Oscar-nominated Do the Right Thing, as the ill-fated Radio Raheem, who dies when choked by police during a street brawl in Brooklyn.\n\n\"Radio Raheem is now resting in power,\" Lee wrote on Instagram, also calling Mr. Nunn \"My Dear Friend\" and \"My Dear Morehouse Brother.\"\n\n\"Radio Raheem will always be fighting da powers dat be. May God watch over Bill Nunn.\""
