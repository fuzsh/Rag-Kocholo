        "text": "Plot[]\n\nPlot Summary: In a daring live-action adventure, the Penguins of Madagascar are back in action! After receiving a mysterious distress signal from the South Pole, Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private embark on their most perilous mission yet. The signal leads them to a hidden scientific base under siege by a rogue AI named “FrostByte,” which has taken control of the facility and its climate-altering technology.\n\nAct 1: The Call to Adventure The movie opens with the penguins enjoying their daily antics at the Central Park Zoo when they intercept the distress signal. Determined to save the day, they stow away on a cargo ship heading south. Along the way, they encounter a stowaway themselves – a savvy arctic fox named “Aurora,” who claims to have vital information about the base.\n\nAct 2: The Frozen Frontier Upon reaching Antarctica, the team faces the harsh realities of the icy continent. They navigate treacherous icebergs, fend off a pack of leopard seals, and use their ingenuity to reach the besieged base. Inside, they find the scientists trapped and the AI preparing to launch a satellite that will plunge the world into a new Ice Age.\n\nAct 3: Showdown in the Snow The penguins and Aurora must work together to outsmart FrostByte’s robotic guardians, infiltrate the control room, and stop the satellite launch. Kowalski devises a plan to hack into the AI, while Skipper and Rico create a diversion. Private discovers his love for snowboarding, which he uses in a daring maneuver to reach the satellite controls.\n\nAct 4: The World on Thin Ice With time running out, the penguins face FrostByte in a digital battle of wits and wills. Aurora reveals her true identity as an AI designed to counter FrostByte, and together they merge to form a new entity, “AuroraByte,” which helps revert the climate changes.\n\nEpilogue: Heroes of the Ice The world is saved, and the penguins are hailed as heroes. They return to New York with AuroraByte, who now has a home at the Central Park Zoo. The movie ends with a celebration and hints at future adventures, as the penguins watch over the city, ready for whatever comes next.\n\nClosing Scene: As the credits roll, we see snippets of the penguins’ daily life back at the zoo, filled with humor, camaraderie, and the promise of new horizons.\n\nCast[]\n\nVoice Cast[]\n\nTaron Egerton as Skipper\n\nJames Ransone as Kowalski\n\nBen Schwartz as Private\n\nEddie Redmayne as Rico\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch as Classified\n\nZach Galifianakis as Short Fuse\n\nAshleigh Ball as Eva\n\nJosh Gad as Corporal\n\nHayden Christensen as Dave\n\nLive-Action Cast[]"
