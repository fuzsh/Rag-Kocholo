        "text": "It’s about time for another Top 13 list! In preparation for the February U.S. release of How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, I decided to rewatch all of the DreamWorks Animation films. DreamWorks Animation, to me, is hit-or-miss, so sometimes it was quite a challenge watching these films. But other times, I quite enjoyed watching these films! Below, I have listed my top 13 favorite DreamWorks Animation films. A few points to keep in mind:\n\n1) This is my personal list of which ones I liked best; it’s not necessarily which ones I think are the best made films. Also this is my list as of now; if you ask me again in the future, this list may change due to personal fluctuations.\n\n2) For personal religious reasons, I haven’t seen The Prince of Egypt nor do I choose to. So don’t be surprised when you see it missing from this list! I’m sure it’s a wonderful film, but I choose not to watch it.\n\n3) I also haven’t seen Joseph: King of Dreams both for personal religious reasons as stated above as well as because it’s a direct-to-video film and I don’t want to compare it alongside the theatrical films.\n\nNow that that’s taken care of, here are my top 13! Hope you enjoy!\n\nContinue reading “My Top 13 Favorite DreamWorks Animation Films”\n\nSo, the Academy has announced that 20 films are qualified as contenders to be nominated for the Best Animated Feature Academy Award in the upcoming 87th Academy Awards ceremony. Due to there being 20, 5 of these films will actually make the nominations list. Which 5 do you think should make the list?\n\nBig Hero 6\n\nThe Book of Life\n\nThe Boxtrolls\n\nCheatin’\n\nGiovanni’s Island\n\nHenry and Me\n\nThe Hero of Color City\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon 2\n\nJack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart\n\nLegends of Oz: Dorothy’s Return\n\nThe LEGO Movie\n\nMinuscule – Valley of the Lost Ants\n\nMr. Peabody and Sherman\n\nPenguins of Madagascar\n\nThe Pirate Fairy\n\nPlanes: Fire and Rescue\n\nRio 2\n\nRocks in My Pockets\n\nSong of the Sea\n\nThe Tale of the Princess Kaguya\n\nMy picks are Big Hero 6, The LEGO Movie, How to Train Your Dragon 2, Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart, and Song of the Sea."
