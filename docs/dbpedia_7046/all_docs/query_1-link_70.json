Classified is in charge of a secret protective agency for animals.\n\n“I don’t know what it’s like to be a penguin but I do know what it’s like to be a super-duper-smooth classified agent,” said Cumberbatch, referring to his lead role as detective Holmes.\n\nThe film is due to hit cinemas this winter, with Ken Jeong, Andy Richter, Chris Miller and Tom McGrath also lending the voices. John Malkovich will star as Classified’s nemesis, the evil octopus Octavius Brine.\n\nThe many faces of Benedict Cumberbatch\n\nShow all 12\n\nElsewhere, Cumberbatch will tackle the title role in a BBC production of Shakespeare’s Richard III, as well as playing Hamlet on stage at the Barbican next summer.\n\nHe has been attached to a movie adaptation of Journey’s End and will soon be seen in Alan Turing biopic The Imitation Game, also in the lead role.\n\nThe British actor, 37, is currently filming Black Mass about killer Whitey Bulger.
