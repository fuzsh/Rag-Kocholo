Smith features a voice cast led by Benedict Cumberbatch, John Malkovich, Ken Jeong and Peter Stormare.\n\nThe second trailer goes back to their beginnings as four brothers in the cold, and how they’ve moved up as secret agents to then take on their big-screen villain, Dr. Octavius Brine (Malkovich).\n\nWatch the trailer above to see how the four became “masters of disguise and espionage” — plus, how they blend in while in Ireland and help fix technical difficulties during villainous voice conferencing."
