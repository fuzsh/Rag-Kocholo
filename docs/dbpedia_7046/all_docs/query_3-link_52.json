        "text": "Whatâs black and white and, at first, a bit of a blur? Thatâd be the penguin leads of this latest feature from DreamWorks Animation. Regular viewers of the Emmy Award-winning Nickelodeon series The Penguins of Madagascar â a spin-off of 2005âs Madagascar, which also spawned two film sequels âÂ should have no problem identifying old friends. But unless youâre especially sensitive to height or a signature hair tuft, the newcomer may have some trouble telling Skipper from Rico from Kowalski, all introduced (as their younger selves) amidst a whirr of droll dialogue, acrobatic action, and an inspired cameo from Werner Herzog.\n\nDoes it matter? You get the drift. Voiced by Tom McGrath (co-director of the Madagascar series),Â Skipper is the leader of a ragtag group of amateur secret agents. Kowalski (Miller) is the brains, while wild-eyed Rico (Vernon) boasts a special weapon in his propulsive powers of regurgitation. Young Private (Knights) is the foundling they meet at the filmâs beginning and coddle like a little brother, but Private wants to be taken seriously now.\n\nAnd these are serious (okay, seriously silly) times, what with a mad octopus named Dave (Malkovich) determined to wipe out the worldâs penguin population: Their cuteness offends him. Skipperâs unit is on the case, but another, more elite organization called the North Wind has dibs; itâs led by Cumberbatchâs supercilious, espresso-drinking wolf dubbed âClassifiedâ and includes a sexpot owl named Eva â disappointingly, the lone female in the film."
