        "text": "Penguins of Madagascar is the kind of movie we thought we were getting three years ago with Puss In Boots. That film was a fantastical fairy-tale infused western adventure, full of exciting action and surprisingly strong characters. This one is a straight cash-in, a spin-off from a different popular franchise with little to justify its existence beyond obvious monetary interests. It is not so much \"bad\" as it is stunningly indifferent to providing anything beyond occasional surface-level entertainment value. It is well-animated and it roars into action from the first moments and never really slows down for 80-some minutes. It has a few earned laughs and a few clever visual gags, but it is lacking in thematic richness or even much beyond rudimentary narrative beats. I am loathe to call the end product of the hard work of countless animators and artists \"lazy,\" but as someone who has spent many years defending DreamWorks Animation and will sing the praises of the vast majority of their films in at least some capacity (do a Google search for \"Scott Mendelson\" and \"Kung Fu Panda 2\"), I know full well that they can do better.\n\nThe film starts off promisingly, with a prologue amusingly narrated by Werner Herzog that earns laughs mostly because it's Werner Herzog riffing both his own image and the brief \"we love penguins\" fad from a decade ago. If the famed filmmaker/documentarian is entering the somewhat self-aware/self-parody stage of his career, and roles in Jack Reacher and next season's Parks and Recreation seem to indicate as much, then I would say we are all in for a treat. But once the film shifts to the present, we get into the actual story and it's bare bones at best. The film is frankly paced like a bullet. If the film wants to be a kind of espionage thriller, then the closest 007 comparison would be Quantum of Solace. The film just never stops moving, not even to properly develop what is supposed to be its trump card element, but I'll get to that in a moment. The picture is breathless, but to no real thematic end. This feature film is less an out-and-out movie than, increased production values aside, three episodes of the Penguins of Madagascar television series stitched together.\n\nIn terms of plot, the four penguins from the movie Madagascar end up in the clutches and then attempting to defeat a tyrannical octopus (John Malkovich, mugging like you've never seen before). The initial confrontation and breathless escape amounts to a curtain-raiser, and the chase scene is clever and fun even if it lacks the verve of the similar pursuit from Madagascar: Europe's Most Wanted. After the initial reel, we are introduced to \"The North Wind,\" a team of would-be superheroes/super-spies who have been tracking the evil Dr. Octavius Brine. The rest of the film involves the four penguins attempting to capture Brine on their own even as the North Wind attempts to do their job with or without the help of our heroes. There is no character development, no emotional beats, and no real tension or urgency. As a result, while there is periodic amusement, there is little to justify viewer engagement over the long haul.\n\nThe four superheroes are, I would argue, the film's primary reason to exist. Just as the penguins were spun-off from the Madagascar movies into a television series and now this feature, I cannot help but presume that DreamWorks Animation has similar designs for The North Wind. Yet this team is most visually bland (they are all white and dressed in mostly light grays) and lack personality beyond what kind of animal they are and their core talent. Benedict Cumberbatch is their leader while Annet Mahendru voices \"Eve,\" the owl who is both the only female character in the movie and utterly useless aside from her use as a romantic prize to be won at the film's conclusion (sigh).\n\nI couldn't tell you offhand about the other two team members, save that one is a polar bear and the other is a seal. Considering DreamWorks is at least somewhat concerned about branching out franchise-friendly characters in such a manner, it is a little odd that they decided to bring in a superhero ensemble, a team that could very easily turn into their own cash cow with a television series or a spin-off feature down the line, and do so little with them. It's nice that the film isn't a backdoor pilot, with the stars being hapless so the guest stars can show their stuff (see any backdoor pilot for any CBS procedural over the last decade), but the team makes zero impression in terms of personality or visual oomph. The Penguins of Madagascar has a few solid visual gags (a bit involving falling luggage from a passenger jet is clever) and a bare minimum of pop culture references. But it also lacks any real storytelling invention or character richness.\n\nNow you may call me foolish to expect such things from a Penguins of Madagascar film, but I know DreamWorks is capable of it in measured doses appropriate to the project at hand. The Madagascar films aren't just about the zany animals. They are real character comedies with a certain introspective/introverted/Jewish psychological mindset to them (the core dilemmas are almost always internal psychological problems). Megamind didn't just toss out Will Ferrell as a zany super-villain and go home, instead crafting a real story about the duality of good and evil in a classical sense that played like a kid-friendly adaptation of J.M. Dematteis's classic \"Going Sane\" arc from Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight. This newest entry, coming off the quality high water mark of How to Train Your Dragon 2, feels like the kind of film that pundits and critics wrongly think of when they think of DreamWorks Animation overall. I know they can do better because I have seen them do better over and over again with the likes of Over the Hedge and Monsters and Aliens (which was an uber-feminist animated adventure well before it was considered \"hip\" or \"cool\").\n\nI suppose it’s an acceptable babysitter of sorts over the long Thanksgiving weekend, although my children were about as uninterested in what unfolded onscreen as I was. DreamWorks Animation is in a perilous position right now, with their 20th year about to end after having two buy-out/merger offers go down in flames in a short time and with more of their features disappointing at the box office (Mr. Peabody and Sherman, Turbo, etc.) than triumphing (The Croods, How to Train Your Dragon 2, etc.). It's not entirely their fault, as the ups-and-downs of their stock is a prime example of the absurdity of the stock market in terms of film companies. Yes they are attempting to diversify beyond theatrical features, but they are still primarily known as a producer of theatrical animated features, and as such a film this unengaging does them no favors. I was not a fan of The Peabody and Sherman earlier this year, but at least that film qualifies as a \"tried and failed,\" but The Penguins of Madagascar seems to be going out of its way not to try.\n\nI'm sure this film will open well over the Thanksgiving weekend, as it's one of the only openers this holiday frame, but I can't imagine it having much in the way of legs as it's just so painfully indifferent. The $132 million production has already earned $24m over the last couple weeks in various overseas territories, with about 99% of that coming from China. I'm presuming its second act story detour into China isn't a coincidence. Again, it's not an overtly bad film or a problematic film, save for how it basically just sits there and does so little with the protective tissue of a pre-established franchise. It's not funny enough to justify having nothing else to offer beyond gags, and it's just not good enough otherwise. There are all too many who basically hold up How to Train Your Dragon and write off the rest of the DreamWorks Animation output as inherently inferior. I have long rallied against that notion, but Penguins of Madagascar makes my argument that much harder. Now bring on Home so I can eat my words accordingly!"
