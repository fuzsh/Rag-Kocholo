        "text": "In Southern Antarctica, three young Adelie penguin brothers, Skipper (Tom McGrath), Kowalski (Chris Miller), and Rico (Conrad Vernon), are never accepted for their curiosity and high skills. They eventually decide to reject nature and rescue an orphaned egg from hungry leopard seals on a shipwreck and set themselves adrift on an iceberg. From the egg hatches Private (Christopher Knights) whom they adopt as their younger brother, and the four become a team. They float on the iceberg across the ocean looking for a place where they can be accepted, eventually reaching New York City where they are exhibited in the Central Park Zoo.\n\nA decade later, directly after the events of \"Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted\", the Penguins have had many adventures and, now trained as spies, are part of a European Circus called Circus Zaragoza. They depart from the circus and celebrate Private's tenth birthday by breaking into the Fort Knox depository in Kentucky so that Private can buy Cheesy Dibbles, a discontinued product, from their break room vending machine. However, Private begins to feel unimportant to the team. While Skipper is the leader and strategist, Kowalski is the brains, and Rico the arsenal specialist, Private is continually referred to as just being a cute face and does not appear to have any remarkable skills.\n\nThe Penguins are suddenly lured into the machine by mysterious tentacles and flown in a helicopter to a secret submarine base in Venice, Italy. There, the Penguins meet a mysterious mad scientist named Professor Octavius Styroker Brine who claims to know the penguins. He then takes off a disguise and is revealed to actually be David \"Dave\" the Octopus (John Malkovich), a purple Giant Pacific octopus who disguises using camouflage skills and a human-like face. Dave used to be adored in the Central Park Zoo as a top star attraction, until the penguins arrived and unknowingly stole his fame with their cuteness. The octopus was then shipped to other zoos, aquariums and theme parks, but each time his fame was stolen by other penguins. Embittered, Dave now wants revenge on all the penguins and has been disguising as an award-winning scientist persona. Rico swallows Dave's snow globe collection along with his latest bio-weapon invention, the \"Medusa\" potion, and the Penguins escape.\n\nThe Penguins are then chased through the canals and streets of Venice by Dave's evil octopus-squid henchmen. Cornered in an alley, the Penguins are saved by the \"North Wind\", an elite undercover inter-species arctic intelligence agency. The group comprises their leader, an arctic wolf named Agent Classified (Benedict Cumberbatch), a demolition specialist harp seal named Short Fuse (Ken Jeong), a muscular polar bear named Corporal (Peter Stormare), and an intelligent snowy owl named Eva (Annet Mahendru), with whom Kowalski becomes smitten.\n\nThe Penguins are flown in to one of the North Wind's secret bases inside a large igloo, where the agency reveals their purpose is to help animals who cannot help themselves and that they have been tracking Dave and his schemes for a long time, trying to bring him to justice. Dave hacks into the North Wind's communication system and reveals to the group he has a lot more of his serum than just the canister the Penguins stole. Dubbing it the Medusa Serum, he aims to use it on all the penguins that stole his fame around the world. Though the Penguins want to work alongside the North Wind, they do not believe the Penguins of being capable allies due to their size and seeming inexperience, and tranquilise them, shipping the four on a plane to their \"most remote base\" (which happens to be back on Madagascar). The Penguins wake up mid-flight and vow to save their species without the North Wind's help.\n\nEjecting from the plane and landing in the Sahara, the penguins make their way to the city of Shanghai, City (that they mistake for Dublin), where they learn penguins are already being kidnapped from zoos everywhere. Using Dave's snow globe collection Rico swallowed earlier, the Penguins discover he is going to target the Shanghai Marine Life zoo next and come up with a plan to stop Dave's scheme. Private begins to feel unimportant to the team when he is told to be the bait by causing a diversion. The Penguins' plan works, and they capture Dave before the North Wind can. However, Dave manages to escape through the pipes and succeeds in kidnapping the zoo's penguins, including Private. The Penguins attempt to chase Dave's Brine Submarine with the North Wind's high-tech aircraft, but accidentally activate the self-destruct, with the North Wind tailing close behind. The two teams track Private with a previously implanted homing device to a remote tropical jungle island. Meanwhile, Dave demonstrates for Private that the Medusa Serum, when blasted in a laser machine, will turn its target into a physically and mentally disfigured hybrid-monster. He plans to use it on all of the penguins he has captured so the public will be repelled by their appearance instead of adored.\n\nOn the island, Classified and Skipper argue over the best way to stop Dave, but Skipper finally relents when he realises Classified's leadership is what is best for Private's escape, as they have much more experience and resources. The Penguins cause a diversion by playing polka for Dave's guards while the North Wind sneaks in and corners Dave, only to be ambushed and captured. The Penguins are also captured upon realising Classified's plan failed. With the rest of the Penguins captured, Dave demonstrates his Medusa Serum ray by testing it on Private. It appears to vaporise him at first, but, unbeknownst to the characters, Private managed to escape his bonds at the last minute with a paperclip he had swallowed earlier. While Dave sets a course for New York City and corrals his penguins into a large group, Private rescues the North Wind from Dave's torture machine. However, while Private wants to rescue the others, the North Wind plans to flee and return to their base for more equipment before facing Dave again. Despite their attempted persuasion to join them, Private chooses to do as Skipper would and heads back to free the penguins by himself.\n\nAfter claiming to the news that he has found the lost penguins, Dave's submarine arrives in New York City, and he blasts the penguins, including Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico, with his mutation ray. After doing so, he releases them to the people who are terrified with their monstrous appearance and behaviour. Private, seeing he is too late, finds Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico, and snaps them out of their disfigured mental state. They deduce that by reversing the ray, they can reverse its effects. However, while Dave had the Medusa Serum, the Penguins would need something incredibly cute. Private opts to use himself as the ray's source of power, accepting whatever effects doing so would have on him.\n\nUnfortunately, the remote for the ray runs out of power and Dave, discovering their plan, sends his henchmen after them. Rico heads out to find more batteries while Skipper and Kowalski defend against the squids, finding themselves outnumbered. The North Wind returns and destroys Dave's submarine before being caught by a pest control unit called in to take care of the monstrous penguins. Rico returns with batteries and a new bag of Organic Cheesy Dibbles. Skipper just manages to replace the batteries in the remote before Dave knocks it away. Just before being caught by pest control, Skipper sends a single Dibble flying towards the remote and hits the activation button. Having attached Dave's snow globes to the ray to refract the beam, Private's cuteness is harnessed and reverts every penguin back to their original appearance.\n\nHowever, as the side effects of being used in the ray, Private has been tinted pink and grown antlers. Despite his strange new look, the Penguins show their gratitude and newfound respect for Private. Dave has also been mutated into a cute baby by the ray and stuck in a snow globe where he is admired by a little girl (Angie Wu). Finally seeing one another as equals, Classified apologises for misjudging them and promises to grant the Penguins anything they want. In addition to Kowalski getting a kiss from Eva, the Penguins are given their own jet-packs. The four Penguins then fly off above the clouds looking for their next adventure.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Penguins return to the circus a week later and plug Morty Lemur (Andy Richter) into the Medusa Laser and use him to revert Private back to normal. Mort does not appear to show any side effects from the ray, until he manages to swallow King Julien XII (Danny Jacobs) whole, to their surprise."
