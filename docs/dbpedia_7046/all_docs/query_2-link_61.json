        "text": "Seemingly inspired by Werner Herzog’s work in Antarctica doc Encounters at the End of the World, Dreamworks asked the German auteur to make a cameo in their new Madagascar spin-off Penguins of Madagascar. Now, via the Dissolve, you can witness the results in the form of a four-minute clip of the movie’s opening minutes, above.\n\nThe clip, which seems to riff on the classic Encounters scene in which Herzog watches a straying penguin and wonders, “Is there such thing as insanity among penguins?”, will not disappoint fans of the director’s unique style of voice-over narration. “Look at them, tumbling onto their chubby bum bums,” the director intones, using a phrase I can confidently say we never would have heard from him otherwise. If you only want to see the Herzog parts, watch his opening narration during the first 35 seconds, and then skip ahead to watch him appear in animated form from about 2:00 to 2:30.\n\nPreviously\n\nWerner Herzog or Marvel Supervillain?
