        "text": "In \"The Penguins of Madagascar,\" the animated stars are as cute and cuddly as ever, and often downright hilarious. Kids will giggle at the plucky impertinence, the pratfalls, the sheer breakneck speed of the gags and the occasional gas-passing joke.\n\nAnd their parents? The puns, movie references and impersonations are for them. Hip ones will grin at the witty touch of German director and documentarian Werner Herzog playing a comically callous documentary filmmaker in the first scene. Here, on \"Earth's frozen bottom,\" he captures the beginnings of the penguin team.\n\nEven as chicks, Skipper is in charge, leading tiny Kowalski, Rico and the newly hatched Private into \"adventure and glory like no penguin has seen before.\" That flashback prologue sets up the dynamic that has played out for this cute and cuddly quartet ever since. \"Kowalski! Analysis! Rico! Status report!\"\n\n\"The Penguins of Madagascar\" is about dopey and adorable Private's efforts to become \"a meaningful and valued member of the team.\" He gets his chance when an octopus supervillain named Dave sets out to rid the world of penguins. But the Madagascar boys have competition in the hero department from a well-financed, gadget-equipped North Wind interspecies commando team.\n\nMcGrath's Skipper has always been what makes the penguins funny. He refuses to be humbled, contradicted or corrected. His version of profanity is a hoot. Every word out of his 3D beak is funny.\n\n\"Penguins\" may lack decent female characters and an original villain, but the stars are still cute, cuddly and as funny as a ninja penguin could ever be.\n\nWATCH IT \"The Penguins of Madagascar\" is directed by Eric Darnell and Simon J. Smith with the voices of Tom McGrath, John Malkovich, Benedict Cumberbatch and Werner Herzog. It runs 1:32 and is rated PG for mild action and some rude humor. ***"
