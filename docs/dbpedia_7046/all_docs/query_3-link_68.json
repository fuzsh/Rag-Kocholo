        "text": "The scene-stealing penguins from the “Madagascar” franchise\n\nget their own movie in the appropriately titled “Penguins of Madagascar.”\n\nOne would think a little of these crazy creatures would go a\n\nlong way. And indeed, this family-friendly animated comedy from co-directors\n\nEric Darnell and Simon J. Smith is predicated on a single joke: the idea that\n\nthese overconfident penguins—who fancy themselves as super spies—are\n\ncompletely bumbling and inept, yet they manage to wriggle out of every tricky\n\nsituation not only to survive but thrive and save the day.\n\nBut the pacing is so zany, the jokes are so rapid-fire and\n\nthe sight gags are so inspired that it’s impossible not to get caught up in the\n\ninfectious energy of it all. The script (credited to John Aboud, Michael Colton\n\nand Brandon Sawyer) finds enough avenues into that one joke to make the premise\n\nseem, if not consistently fresh, at least enjoyable. And the formidable voice\n\ncast, featuring John Malkovich and the ubiquitous Benedict Cumberbatch, takes\n\nthis silly work absolutely seriously, and that’s one of the most amusing bits of\n\nall.\n\n“Penguins of Madagascar” serves as both an origin story and\n\na spin-off, as it follows these adorable animals on an adventure of their own.\n\n(The zoo animals from the original series, voiced by Ben Stiller, Chris Rock,\n\nDavid Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith, are nowhere to be found.) We begin in\n\nAntarctica, where a long line of penguins is waddling across the merciless,\n\nsnowy terrain to nowhere, because (as even they acknowledge) they’re not\n\nallowed to think for themselves. This is just what they do—and what the\n\ndocumentary crews expect them to do, in a knowing jab at the over-saturation of\n\npenguin-related properties over the past decade or so.\n\nOnce the familiar, raspy tones of Werner Herzog’s narration\n\nkick in, describing the penguins’ dismal state in his typically wonderful,\n\ndramatic way, we know we’re in for a whole ‘nother level of humor aimed\n\nexclusively at the adults in the audience. Yes, all animated movies are crammed\n\nwith self-referential jokes and cheeky pop-culture references, but “Penguins of\n\nMadagascar” does this consistently well. The fact that so much of the word play\n\nis so intentionally groan-worthy—including a running bit involving celebrity\n\nnames—is part of the fun.\n\nThe slick Skipper (voiced by series veteran Tom McGrath) is\n\nthe foursome’s self-appointed leader. Kowalski (Chris Miller) is the brains of\n\nthe operation and the group’s resident pessimist. Rico (Conrad Vernon), the\n\nleast developed of the four, essentially swallows things and makes grunting\n\nnoises, but he’s useful in a pinch. Then there’s the soft and innocent Private\n\n(Christopher Knights), the de facto little brother, whom the other three have\n\nknown from the moment he hatched.\n\nDuring one of their covert missions, they find themselves\n\ntaken captive by Dr. Octavius Brine (Malkovich), a mad scientist who’s actually\n\nan evil, shape-shifting octopus in disguise named Dave. Seems he’s been\n\ntracking the four penguins all over the globe, resentful of the fact that they\n\nkeep stealing his thunder at various zoos and aquariums. His goal is to capture\n\nas many penguins as possible from around the world and zap them with a serum\n\nthat will turn them into monstrous versions of themselves and make them seem\n\nless cuddly and appealing to the masses.\n\n(This was essentially the motivation of the dastardly El\n\nMacho in “Despicable Me 2,” by the way. He kidnapped nearly all of Gru’s\n\nminions, shot them up with high-tech jelly and turned them into an army of evil,\n\npurple minions to help him carry out his nefarious plan. I have a 5-year-old;\n\nI’ve seen this movie a lot.)\n\nSkipper and his pals try to thwart Dave’s plan, but also on\n\nhis tail (or his tentacles) is a group of legitimate animal super spies led by\n\na wolf whose name is Classified, in a bit of who’s-on-first humor. Cumberbatch\n\nvoices the character with total authority and gravitas, and to think that he\n\nhas this and the voice of the fearsome dragon Smaug from the epic “Hobbit”\n\nfranchise in him—as well as the brilliant mathematician Alan Turing in this\n\nweek’s “The Imitation Game”—speaks to his limitless versatility."
