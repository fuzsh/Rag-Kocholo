        "text": "Benedict Cumberbatch may have finally made his mark in Hollywood â€“ after playing Brit-accented baddies and heavyweight dramatic roles, he's made a final rite of passage, namely doing voice work in an animated kids' movie.\n\nHe'll take the role of Classified, a dashing-looking wolf with a serious set of eyebrows, in the next instalment of the Madagascar movies, The Penguins of Madagascar. Classified is a secret agent who heads up a covert animal-protection organisation called North Wind (motto: \"No one breaks the Wind\").\n\n\"I don't know what it's like to be a penguin, but I do know what it's like to be a super-duper-smooth classified agent,\" said Cumberbatch, who will be up against John Malkovich's evil octopus Octavius Brine. The film will focus on the quartet of wisecracking penguins who have already featured in the Madagascar series, and bagged their own spin-off TV show.\n\nIt's not Cumberbatch's only upcoming animation work though, as he'll voice the lead character in Magik, a children's fantasy co-written by Lolita actor Dominique Swain and Canadian director Stephen Wallis.\n\nCumberbatch has some more serious fare in development, too. He'll play a pair of Shakespearean heavyweights in the next year, taking on Richard III on BBC2 and Hamlet at London's Barbican next summer. He's rumoured to be the lead in an upcoming film adaptation of Journey's End, and recently completed The Imitation Game, a biopic of Bletchley Park codebreaker Alan Turing in which he also takes the lead. Producer Harvey Weinstein recently praised Cumberbatch in the latter, saying: \"Alan Turing is not outwardly very sympathetic. He's brilliant, but the way that Benedict Cumberbatch played him showed us these guys found the right level of vulnerability, genius and the arrogance of the character, too.\"\n\nCurrently filming is Black Mass, featuring Johnny Depp as killer Whitey Bulger, with Cumberbatch playing his brother, while further down the line is Flying Horse, a drama about early photographer Eadweard Muybridge directed by Gary Oldman."
