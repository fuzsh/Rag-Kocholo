        "text": "By: Lynn Barker\n\nPenguin Origins\n\nIn Antarctica, a long line of penguins is waddling across the desolate terrain to their mating ground in “March of the Penguins” style because it’s just what they do. Tiny kid versions of Kowalski, Skipper and Rico decide to break from the flock and rescue a run-away egg that eventually hatches into little Private and the foursome floats away on an iceberg bound for adventure.\n\nPenguins decide their next moveCourtesy of DreamWorks Animation\n\nPresent Day\n\nWhile on a crazy mission to rob Fort Knox of all of the beloved “Cheesy Dibbles” (think Cheetos) in a vending machine, the gang is kidnapped by Dr. Octavius Brine (John Malkovich), a mad scientist who’s actually an evil, shape-shifting octopus in disguise named Dave. He hates our guys because he used to be a star zoo attraction until the ultra cute penguins stole the crowd from him… in zoo after zoo. He wants revenge and has a master plot to capture tons of penguins from around the world and, using his secret Medusa serum, transform them into monsters that no zoo-visiting family could possibly love.\n\nThe North Wind TeamCourtesy of DreamWorks\n\nSkipper is addicted to cheesy treats.Courtesy of DreamWorks Animation\n\nRescue?\n\nThe gang escapes and ends up in Venice, Italy (don’t ask) where they are semi-rescued from Dave and his squid army by Corporal (Peter Stormare’s voice) a giant polar bear enforcer, and his cohorts; a cocky, James Bond type wolf leader called Classified (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch), a gorgeous owl communications specialist named Eva (Annette Mahendru) and a baby seal explosives expert named Short Fuse (Ken Jeong). They are The North Wind, an elite undercover group sworn to aid and rescue animals in trouble everywhere.\n\nRowing an escape on a Venice canalCourtesy of DreamWorks Animation\n\nSpy Vs. Spy\n\nThe rest of the film is a competition between the think-on-their-feet…uh flippers penguins and the more high tech and organized North Wind group to rescue the many penguins Dave has captured and stop his awful plan to turn them into monsters then let them loose on NYC. Always the under-bird, little Private gets to prove that he can hatch his own worthy plans and become the hero.\n\nUh...don't push that button!Courtesy of DreamWorks Animation\n\nWrapping Up\n\nPenguins of Madagascar gives the little flightless birds who always steal the show in the Madagascar movies their own film and, mostly, it works. The plot lags a few times but the action is so fast-paced throughout that it’s hard to ever be very bored. There are verbal funnies to please adults, including some funny plays on celebrity names, and plenty of speedy and colorful visuals to appeal to younger kids. Escapes and chases are very cleverly executed as well.\n\nSkipper challenges ClassifiedCourtesy of DreamWorks Animation\n\nVoice actors are the usual guys who voice the penguins on screen and on their TV show. Guest actor Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect as the cocky and frustrated spy leader simply known as Classified and John Malkovich makes a great mad scientist villain as Dave/Dr. Brine.\n\nPenguin voice actors in actionCourtesy of DreamWorks Animation\n\nAlthough a lot happens in the film’s 90 minutes, it is nice to see the origin story of our little penguins as well as see them on a world-wide adventure vs. another spy team (this film obviously is trying to set us up for more North Wind spy team adventures.)\n\nPenguins are ready for actionCourtesy of DreamWorks Animation\n\nMaybe the penguins are just better in smaller doses but we were entertained enough to go four stars. Be sure to stick around through most of the end credits for a bit more of the story.\n\nPenguins Of Madagascar Movie Rating:\n\nPenguins Of MadagascarCourtesy of DreamWorks Animation\n\nPenguins Of Madagascar is in theaters now!"
