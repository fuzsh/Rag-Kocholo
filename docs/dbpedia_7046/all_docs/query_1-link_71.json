        "text": "Benedict\n\nCumberbatch doesn’t even have to appear in a movie to make an\n\nimpression. With a voice that once was famously described as sounding\n\nlike “a jaguar hiding in a cello,” the British actor best known for his\n\nportrait of Sherlock Holmes on PBS is heard but not seen in two upcoming\n\nfilms: as a foxy undercover wolf who goes by the name Classified and\n\noversees the North Wind, a covert group of animal agents, in the\n\nanimated spy comedy “Penguins of Madagascar” (opening Nov. 26); and as Smaug the dragon in the finale of “The Hobbit” trilogy, “The Battle of Five Armies” (Dec. 17).\n\n“At\n\nComic-Con in San Diego, women were quite audible when the wolf appeared\n\nin the clips,” says Penguins co-director Eric Darnell, who also shared\n\nhelming duties on the “Madagascar” film series that began in 2005.\n\nBut, obviously, witnessing their idol in the flesh is always preferable. Not to worry, Cumber-fans. In “The Imitation Game” (Nov. 28),\n\nyou get the full Benedict, as it were, when he stars as code-breaking\n\nWorld War II hero Alan Turing—a role that has been gathering Oscar\n\nbuzz for weeks after making the fall festival rounds.\n\nBecause\n\nof his heavy schedule, Cumberbatch (who just announced his engagement\n\nrecently) did some early press for the 20th Century Fox/DreamWorks\n\nrelease while attending this year’s Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nJoining him was Tom McGrath, the co-director on the three previous\n\n“Madagascar” adventures who reprises his role as Skipper, the macho\n\nleader of the black-and-white foursome in the franchise spinoff.\n\nThe\n\nresulting chat, though entertaining, was a little disjointed, not\n\nunlike Skipper’s penchant for paranoia-induced conspiracy theories. The\n\nfact that a human-size costumed version of Skipper was waving his\n\nflippers about in a nearby room just added to the unusual atmosphere.\n\nTherefore,\n\nI turned to Darnell and Simon J. Smith, his “Penguins” co-director who\n\noriginally hails from England, to provide some coherent basic\n\nintelligence on these two talented gents. That includes how McGrath\n\noriginally came up with the penguins for the first “Madagascar” outing\n\nand why they thought one of hottest actors in the world would deign to\n\nbe a secret-agent foil to a flock of waddling scene stealers.\n\n“He\n\ninvented the penguins,” says Darnell of McGrath. “We both had come\n\noff other movies that were penguin-related before we started up to do\n\n“Madagascar.” I was doing a penguins movie for DreamWorks—with the\n\nBeatles actually. And we couldn’t quite get it together. And Tom was\n\nworking on another penguins movie. We both had penguins on the brain. He\n\nwent home one night and came back in with some story sketches he had\n\ndone. It was the penguins on the boat in the first “Madagascar,”\n\ncoughing up that paper clip. And breaking out and taking over the ship.\n\nWe put that in the film.”\n\nHow\n\ndid McGrath come to provide Skipper’s voice? “I think there is a little\n\nbit of Tom in Skipper,” Darnell says. “He can slide into that role. He\n\ngets it. Or you might even say those four penguins are different aspects\n\nof his personality. The four guys together kind of create this unified\n\npersonality that has commitment and chutzpah and brains and heart.\n\nThat’s Tom.”\n\nAs\n\nfor Mr. Cumberbatch? “We saw him about three and a half years ago,”\n\nSmith says. “In “Sherlock.” And our editor is an Australian and he saw\n\nhim before we did, because they ran “Sherlock” before they ran it here.\n\nHe said, ‘You’ve got to see this guy, Benedict Cumberbatch.’ We thought\n\nthat was an interesting name. Lara Breay, the producer, and I both saw\n\nhim and it was like, ‘Oh my God, this guy is amazing.’ And we campaigned\n\nto try to get him in for casting, specifically for the character of\n\nClassified. We liked the juxtaposition of a James Bond type, suave and\n\nsophisticated, to go against the crazy John Wayne-like,\n\nshoot-first-ask-questions-later Skipper and the boys. We asked him to do the movie and he said, ‘Absolutely, I’d love to do it.’”\n\nSmith\n\nand company were impressed by the actor’s conviction to his role, silly\n\npuns and all. “He is such a professional. He just dove right in and was\n\nwilling to do anything, even giving the Benedict Cumberbatch treatment\n\nto lines like, ‘No one breaks the Wind.’ That is the only reason we\n\nnamed them the North Wind, by the way. Just for that gag.”\n\nWithout further wind-related ado, here are Cumberbatch and McGrath.\n\nI work for RogerEbert.com although I am based in Virginia near Washington, D.C. The website has contributors from all over.\n\nMcGrath: I just went to Washington for the first time.\n\nThat’s almost un-American.\n\nMcGrath: I know. I’m working on a project with Kevin Spacey. Do you know Kevin?\n\nCumberbatch: Oh, yeah.\n\nMcGrath:\n\nHe’s a kick. He is doing a voice for this other project. And I had\n\nnever been to Washington before. I loved it when I was there. Have you\n\nbeen?\n\nCumberbatch: No, I haven’t. And I really want to. Yeah, it’s on the bucket list for me.\n\nDon’t go in the summer.\n\nCumberbatch: No, it’s very swampy I hear.\n\nTom,\n\nwhen I was still at USA TODAY, you did these postcards written in the\n\nvoice of each of the four main characters in “Madagascar 3: Europe’s\n\nMost Wanted.”\n\nCumberbatch: That’s like Uncle Fraggle from “Fraggle Rock.” We should have done that for this movie. It’s never too late.\n\nAre you too big of a star now, Tom, that you can’t direct and talk anymore?\n\nMcGrath: I got a taste of what it is like to be talent. Which is good. It’s the first time I’ve had a hotel suite.\n\nBut you also are an executive producer.\n\nMcGrath:\n\nYeah, these characters are so close to my heart, it’s fun. And with\n\nSimon and Eric, the movie is in great hands. And I had other projects I\n\nwas doing. So it was great just to be the voice talent. And I was\n\ntalking to Benedict about this, just being behind the mike really gave\n\nme a great education of how to direct people behind the mike, and what’s\n\nuseful to know or giving context to the situation. Being on the other\n\nside of that was great for me to grow even as a director.\n\nYou\n\nhad the most memorable line from the first “Madagascar,” “Remember,\n\ncute and cuddly, boys. Cute and cuddly.” I had a stuffed penguin that\n\nsaid that when you squeezed his stomach.\n\nMcGrath: Oh, yeah. I gave one to my mother so I didn’t have to call her as much.\n\nYou\n\nare probably going to be a talking toy now, too, Benedict, if you\n\nhaven’t been already because of “The Hobbit” movies. Is there a dragon\n\ntoy with your voice?\n\nCumberbatch:\n\nI don’t think it would be proper to have a dragon who would say, “I am\n\nfire. I am death.” I just think of the slightly younger ones going\n\n(puts on a hysterical crying-kid voice), “He said he’s death!” They\n\nwould have to be heavily sedated to sleep. I think there are some toys\n\nare there that have a striking resemblance to me, but I think they are\n\notters.\n\n(Laughter all around) Well, if you think so …\n\nCumberbatch:\n\nI don’t, but apparently the Internet does. It’s a picture of my face\n\nand an otter’s [see it here]. And how similar they are. That was in 2013. There are\n\nother memes now. I look more like a wolf these days.\n\nDid you have a say who would be the voices of the new characters, Tom?\n\nMcGrath: I wanted Leo…actually I wasn’t around then.\n\nCumberbatch: They were English people, so I think they were a bit biased. Was it\n\nalways going to be a Brit character? It could have more like Bourne or\n\nsome kind of American.\n\nMcGrath:\n\nIt was a flat, one-dimensional character and it was hard to figure out\n\nin the process of developing the story until Benedict stepped into the\n\nrole. All of a sudden, the character sprang to life and\n\nbecame this three-dimensional character. And it really helped me to\n\nknow who I was playing off of. They would play me Benedict’s voice just\n\nin the scene because he would improvise a lot. I can’t think of anyone\n\nelse who could play the role. And the great thing is, many people know\n\nBenedict’s dramatic side but they don’t know how funny he can be.\n\nHave you ever made a straight-up comedy movie?\n\nCumberbatch: Yes, “Starter for 10.” There are issues to do with relationships and\n\ngrowing up. But that was a straight comedy. And a lot of “Sherlock,” I\n\nthink, is just genuinely funny. Also, there is a BBC radio comedy\n\ncalled “Cabin Pressure,” that is just very funny. John Finnemore writes\n\nthat beautifully. It’s a great character I play in that.\n\nMcGrath: And you have secret things now.\n\nCumberbatch: Secret things coming out…maybe. It’s always tempting and I’ve been\n\nvery flattered by some of the offers I’ve had in the past for cameos.\n\nI’d love to do straight comedy where you see me.\n\nSome of us would like to see you in a romantic comedy.\n\nCumberbatch: A romantic comedy? Make you laugh and fall in love with her? Yeah.\n\nWhat about voice work?\n\nCumberbatch: I’ve done an episode of “The Simpsons.” I did Smaug with motion capture. This was some motion capture.\n\nMcGrath: We videotaped Benedict. The animators used it as a tool.\n\nCumberbatch:\n\nAnd after that, it got a little more extrapolated because I took off\n\nfor Yellow Stone Park for a little while to get in touch with my inner\n\nwolf. I was in a pack. Quite a tame pack to begin with. I tested myself.\n\nMcGrath: (in a whisper) Method.\n\nCumberbatch:\n\nMethod, yeah. I became native. I then realized the members of the pack\n\nwere three other actors. Christian Bale, Tommy Lee Jones … it was a\n\ncrazy pack of wolves and a great party as well.\n\nUm, he has a wild imagination, doesn’t he.\n\nMcGrath:\n\nHe does. You need that when you do animated voices because you don’t\n\nhave any sets or costumes to look at. Not many people can do it. And\n\nBenedict is one who can imagine a world around him and bring a great\n\nperformance.\n\nCumberbatch:\n\nI am just a huge fan of this type of film. I’ve always have been. I\n\nlove the “Madagascar” films. And I love the penguins and I think Tom’s Skipper\n\nis genius. It is utter genius. I hear bits of James Mason. Others hear\n\nJohn Wayne. It’s a beautiful thing and it makes me laugh every time.\n\nMcGrath: And a poor man’s Charlton Heston …\n\nCumberbatch: In “Planet of the Apes.”\n\nMcGrath: I always listen to “Planet of the Apes” at least once a year. It’s all those actors from the ‘50s and ‘60s.\n\nCumberbatch:\n\nThere is a delicacy of wit in it as well, which is very, very funny.\n\nIt’s brilliant. So I’ve always wanted to do this kind of stuff. And you\n\ndon’t want to just turn up and be a name on the cast list. You want to\n\nactually have fun with the medium. That is what made me want to do it. I\n\nhad never done an animation before.\n\nI do think that some actors give their best performances doing animation.\n\nMcGrath: And when you see them, it’s always a disappointment.\n\nNo,\n\nno. But it is freeing not to be on camera. Ellen DeGeneres was OK as an\n\nactress but she was amazing as Dory in “Finding Nemo.” Even Robin\n\nWilliams as the genie in “Aladdin.” That is where it started, when\n\nstudios started hiring bigger name actors to do voice work. And actors\n\nrealized it isn’t a bad gig.\n\nMcGrath:\n\nThey always say now it’s all just star stuff. But Hans Conried, when he\n\ndid Captain Hook in “Peter Pan,” was still a huge star. It’s weird how\n\npeople perceive these big-name actors. How we really cast animated\n\nfilms is by voice, not necessarily by the marquee. And Benedict’s range\n\nis so incredible.\n\nCumberbatch:\n\nAnd it was three years ago as well. It was before a lot of the stuff\n\nI’ve done had actually come out even. I’m not saying I was an unknown.\n\n“Sherlock” had happened. So that was a big thing. I was really only\n\nhappy about it.\n\nMcGrath: With a lot of people, it’s surprising. They are great on screen but then their voice can be flat.\n\nThere\n\nis a tradition of animation directors doing voices. Even Walt Disney\n\ndid Mickey Mouse. But did you think that almost 10 years later, you\n\nwould still be doing the voice of Skipper.\n\nMcGrath:\n\nI had hoped so. It’s fun. Even though I wanted Robert Stack’s voice\n\noriginally. It’s fun for me with my nephews and kids. Benedict has\n\ngodchildren that now they get to hear him as Agent Classified.\n\nTell me about Agent Classified\n\nCumberbatch: We can’t really discuss it. It’s kind of classified.\n\nStop it.\n\nCumberbatch:\n\nYeah, he’s great. He is the professional in the movie. Everyone else is\n\njust sort of happy-go-lucky amateurs really. He is incredibly pompous\n\nand secure in his wonderful position of leading this elite team of\n\nexpert animal welfare protectors.\n\nMcGrath: We join forces because the penguins are like grit, spit and duct tape. They usually take the wrong approach.\n\nCumberbatch: Like James Bond, we have an organization. It’s all very high-tech kit.\n\nWhat is the plot, exactly, because the movie hasn’t screened yet?\n\nCumberbatch: Good question, Tom.\n\nMcGrath: Dave the Octopus, who is played beautifully by John Malkovich, is\n\nresentful of penguins and anything cute and cuddly. Agent Classified is\n\ncalled in because he works with the North Wind, which helps all these\n\nhelpless animals.\n\nCumberbatch:\n\nAnd he realizes that things have been going wrong for penguins around\n\nthe world. They have been disappearing from zoo enclosures. And their\n\nworlds collide.\n\nMcGrath:\n\nThey go around the world to Shanghai, Venice. And everyone thinks of\n\npenguins as cute and cuddly. But our guys, the thing is, they don’t\n\nrealize the package that they are in. They are these big personalities\n\nin this cute and cuddly package. And so, in a way, they are proving\n\nthemselves to the world that they are capable. And the way they look at\n\nPrivate, the youngest member of the group, they realize they have been\n\ntreating one of their own members the way the world has been treating\n\nthem. So there is a heart to this comedy. They have to save the world\n\nand Skipper has a different approach than Classified.\n\nCumberbatch.\n\nIt is fun to watch them clash while trying to achieve their objective\n\nand getting Private back. And taking down Dave.\n\nMcGrath: I love how you say that.\n\nCumberbatch: I think I have a lot of Steve Coogan in my performance.\n\nI\n\nam sure he will consider it an honor. I do want to ask you a\n\nnon-penguin-related question, however. Where were you on Emmy night this\n\nyear when you won best lead actor in a miniseries or movie for\n\n“Sherlock”? The show ended up with seven trophies."
