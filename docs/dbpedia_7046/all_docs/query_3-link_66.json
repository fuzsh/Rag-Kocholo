        "text": "\"Super spy teams aren't born ... they're hatched.\" As the opening line of a plot summary by DreamWorks Animation suggests, the animation studio's latest release, Penguins of Madagascar, deals with espionage and conspiracy.\n\nBut while the film delivers on action set pieces and humorous banter between its characters, it is as flightless as its namesake birds when it comes to plot.\n\nThe feature-length spin-off of the popular Madagascar film series opens with younger version of penguins Skipper (voiced by Tom McGrath), Kowalski (Chris Miller) and Rico (Conrad Vernon) in Antarctica. The trio break from their penguin flock to save an egg, which later hatches into the cuddly Private (Christopher Knights).\n\nScenes from Penguins of Madagascar Photos: CFP\n\nLed by the fearless Skipper, the birds embark on a quest to explore the world beyond Antarctica. However, their adventure comes to an abrupt end when they are captured by Dr Octavius Brine (John Malkovic), a villainous octopus who seeks revenge on the whole penguin species for stealing his thunder at zoos and aquariums.\n\nDr Brine, aka Dave, has not only assembled an octopus army to capture penguins across the world, but has also developed a secret weapon - a vicious serum that can turn the adorable birds into monstrous mutants.\n\nSkipper and his wingmen are rescued by a team of elite operatives who call themselves the North Wind. Led by Agent Classified (Benedict Cumberbatch), a handsome and sleek wolf, the undercover special task force is dedicated to clamping down on animal crimes. Despite their differences, the two groups must join together to fight against Dr Brine and save the penguin species from extinction.\n\nPenguins of Madagascar is the brainchild of two noted directors - Eric Darnell, who helmed the Madagascar franchise, and Simon J. Smith, the man behind the Shrek series and Bee Movie. Thanks to their filmmaking flair, the new Madagascar installment is an earnest piece of work with fast-paced action, funny dialogue and excellent visuals.\n\nAlthough most of the action set pieces in the film are predictable, they are still well-executed. There are hectic car chases, hand-to-hand fights and machine gun battles among a bunch of larger-than-life animal characters.\n\nThey tirelessly trade witty punch lines, and convey human emotions. However, Benedict Cumberbatch's debut voice role in a traditionally animated feature film is disappointingly lackluster.\n\nThe problem is the action sequences aren't enough to buoy the film through its one-and-a-half hours. The overly simple story line means the film better caters to the tastes of younger viewers, who will care more about watching the antics of the fluffy, adorable birds than plot shortfalls.\n\nTechnically speaking, Penguins of Madagascar is a visual feast. And the effects are heightened in the 3D version. The animated images are all vividly and artistically rendered, and each of the penguins can be identified by their subtle nuances in facial expression.\n\nOne aspect that adult audiences are likely to appreciate is the groovy soundtrack composed by Lorne Balfe. The Scottish music producer, whose music credits include popular video games such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Assassin's Creed III, and Revelations provides an electrifying score that suits the action perfectly.\n\nPenguins of Madagascar, a 20th Century Fox release, earns three stars out of five.\n\nEveryone's a critic\n\nMs Xu\n\nHousewife, 30\n\n\"My 5-year-old girl and I both enjoyed the film. The penguins are so cute that you have to love them. The story is easy to understand and follow. The visual effects are beautifully crafted - my girl didn't complain about having to wear a pair of 3D spectacles this time. All she said after watching the film was how much she wanted to cuddle the furry birds. It is good family entertainment indeed.\"\n\nCathy Yang\n\nOffice worker, 32\n\n\"I had a good laugh when watching Penguins of Madagascar. The penguins are very adorable and hilarious. I could shut my brain off for an hour or so to watch the film. And this animation is very much-needed, especially after watching Christopher Nolan's mind-blowing Interstellar.\"\n\nMr Huang\n\nOffice worker, 26\n\n\"This animation bored me. Well, the birds are cuddly and the visuals are OK. But the hectic and stereotyped action sequences really wore me out. And the funniest, if not nonsensical, thing about the film is Dr Octavius Brine's carefully planned intrigue being driven by mere jealousy over appearance. What is the film trying to say? That good looks are all that matter?\""
