        "text": "This spin off is a breezy good time chocked full of smart humor and a nicely developed story.\n\nFebruary 11, 2022\n\nPenguins of Madagascar is a reasonably diverting romp featuring a few visually arresting set-pieces, including a fun scene showing the penguins aboard gondolas in Venice, but there's not really enough here to keep grown-ups fully engaged...\n\nMay 26, 2021\n\nGood, zany fun. No lessons will be learned, no morals taught, nothing gained but a good time at the movies.\n\nFebruary 2, 2021\n\nPenguins of Madagascar is a passably entertaining time at the multiplex, with inspired moments offered by the four lead penguins.\n\nAugust 2, 2019\n\nIt's actually really funny. It reminded me of the first Naked Gun movie.\n\nMay 3, 2019\n\nA clever, rapid-fire barrage of pop culture references and dizzying one-liners, all delivered with a self-awareness that only adds to the fun.\n\nJanuary 25, 2019\n\nSorpresivamente, Pingüinos de Madagascar es una entretenida y reconfortante animación que a fin de cuentas termina siendo más astuta de lo que realmente parece ser y muy superior a cualquier entrega de Madagascar.\n\nJanuary 19, 2019"
