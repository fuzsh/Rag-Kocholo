        "text": "The Short List\n\nThe President confidentially chooses Judge Harrison as his nominee for the Supreme Court. His staff continues to search Harrison's past. When the President meets with the retiring justice, the justice insists that Bartlet consider Judge Roberto Mendoza. Since he has not publicly announced his decision, Bartlet directs his staff to investigate Mendoza as well. When Sam uncovers an article that Harrison wrote declaring the right to privacy is not covered by the constitution, something totally against Bartlet's philosophy, the President officially nominates Mendoza instead. Josh worries that a congressman's attack on the staff for alleged drug use precedes an attack on Leo, whose former substance abuse may no longer be a secret.\n\nThe Car Pool Lane\n\nLarry finds an innovative way to use the HOV lane to get to a Dodgers game. Later, he pays a price for getting medicinal marijuana for his dad.\n\nThe Commitments\n\nDorothy gets wrapped up in \"Beatlemania\" and begins dating a Beatle impersonator. Meanwhile, Blanche begins to worry about her looks after she pulls out all the stops to get a certain man into bed, but to no avail."
