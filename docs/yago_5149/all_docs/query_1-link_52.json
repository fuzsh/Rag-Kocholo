        "text": "TORONTO - Jill Hennessy was honoured for her work as a TV actress on Monday, but the star of \"Law & Order\" and \"Crossing Jordan\" says music has always been her true creative passion.\n\n\"(Music) was something I did purely because of sheer love and joy,\" Hennessy, 42, said before accepting an international achievement award from non-profit organization Women in Film and Television.\n\nHennessy, who was born in Edmonton and raised in Kitchener, Ont., is well known to television viewers for her 1993-1996 stint as Claire Kincaid on TV's \"Law & Order\" and as Dr. Jordan Cavanaugh on \"Crossing Jordan,\" which ran from 2001 to 2007.\n\nStill, the mother of two young sons frequently speaks warmly in interviews about her salad days busking at Toronto subway stations.\n\nA few months ago, Hennessy released her debut album, \"Ghost in My Head,\" which includes guest appearances from Martie Maguire of the Dixie Chicks and R.E.M.'s Mike Mills.\n\nWhen asked what advice she had for those just starting out in show business, Hennessy didn't hesitate.\n\n\"Pursue what you love and enjoy it and stick with what makes you happy, regardless of whatever responses you might get. If you feel in your gut that what you're doing is satisfying and beautiful and creative then you're on the right path,\" she said.\n\n\"We should never limit ourselves to just one niche ... if there is something that one loves to do, that is inspiring, that takes you to a different place where you're actually better able to function in other facets of your life, then by all means. In my case it just happens to be music.\"\n\nHennessy fed that passion this past summer by doing shows in New York and Philadelphia with the Lilith Fair tour, singing alongside Sarah McLachlan and the Indigo Girls.\n\n\"When I'm doing my music it's material that I've generated, and that's very personal,\" she says of the difference between music and acting.\n\nHennessy still loves the craft of acting, however, and is currently at work on the HBO horse-racing series \"Luck,\" which co-stars Dustin Hoffman and Dennis Farina and is expected to air sometime next year. She says it's the perfect shooting schedule because she only has to work every couple of weeks.\n\nOther acting projects include the Canadian indie movie \"Small Town Murder Songs,\" which won an acting prize over the weekend at the Whistler Film Festival. There's no word yet on a release date.\n\nAs for the award she received Monday, the ever-humble Hennessy seemed almost unable to take it in.\n\n\"It's hard to believe you're being honoured in the first place,\" she said during an interview at an opulent hotel where she noted she'd once worked as a hostess.\n\n\"I guess I still sort of perceive myself as the person auditioning here in Toronto and going to Second City for improv comedy classes and playing guitar on the street.\"\n\nOther honorees at the Women in Film and Television luncheon included documentary filmmaker Shelley Saywell, Maple Pictures co-president Laurie May, and agent Lesley Harrison."
