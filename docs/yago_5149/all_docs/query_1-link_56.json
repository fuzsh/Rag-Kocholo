        "text": "A young Ladner actor will be appearing in a new TV-movie adaptation of Stephen Leacock's Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town Sunday on CBC.\n\nOwen Best, 15, plays a boyhood Leacock in the coming of age story set in the small town of Mariposa.\n\n\"He was a really cool character to play and it was an honour to play Stephen Leacock, who's an absolutely huge influence on Canadian authors,\" says Best.\n\nLeacock (1869-1944) has been described as \"Canada's greatest humourist\" and had an award named after him to recognize the best in Canadian literary humour.\n\nThe movie, which marks the book's 100th anniversary, blends fact and fiction with Leacock's own life along with his literary creation.\n\nBest says the young Leacock is very smart and has to work at a young age against his mother's wishes.\n\n\"He's only trying to do the best for the family, but his mom doesn't see that. So he struggles through that a bit.\"\n\nBest says it was \"absolutely amazing\" being involved in the project thanks in part to the other actors he got to work with and the environment.\n\n\"He's a wonderful young man,\" director Don McBrearty is quoted as saying on the movie's website. \"Owen simply took the world in as a writer would and seemed to have so much emotion in response to his interaction with this world of characters.\"\n\nThe cast for Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town also includes Jill Hennessy, Gordon Pinset, Rick Roberts and Donal Logue.\n\nBest, who has appeared in feature films as well as TV shows, says he was inspired to get into acting after seeing a cousin appear in a commercial.\n\nHe says he enjoys tackling challenging roles and growing as an actor.\n\nBest played Bryce Anderson in both Diary of a Wimpy Kid and the sequel Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules. He also played seven-year-old Sam Flynn in Tron: Legacy. Best's TV credits include a recurring role in Smallville and the miniseries Impact.\n\nSunshine Sketches of a Little Town airs Sunday, Feb. 12 on CBC at 8 p.m.\n\nCheck out http: //www.cbc.ca/sunshinesketches/index.html for more on the show."
