He got his start on stage at an early age through musical theatre, dance and acting, performing throughout his school years. Upon completing high school, Zach moved to Toronto to pursue his post-secondary education in the Theatre/Drama program at University of Toronto Mississauga and Sheridan College. Now based in Toronto, he’s had an exciting acting career thus far, and is delighted to be a part of the “Family Law” family.\n\nNotable television credits include three seasons on CTV’s award winning series “Cardinal”, as Detective Ash Kular, and a recurring role on the cult and sci-fi favourite “The Expanse” (Amazon).

While Zach has worked on several holiday rom-coms including “Angel Falls: A Novel Holiday” (Hallmark) and “Two Turtle Doves” (Hallmark), he’s excited to be the leading man in “Mistletoe and Molly”, coming out Christmas 2021.\n\nSAG and Emmy Award-nominated Lauren Holly is one of Hollywood’s most well-respected actors, possessing lasting star power and a versatile range with roles in some of film and television’s\n\nmost memorable projects. Holly is set to star in Netflix’s upcoming drama series “Tiny Pretty Things” based on the popular book of the same name by Sona Charaipotra and Dhonielle Clayton.\n\nMost recently, Holly starred on the third season of Netflix’s hit cult favorite “Designated Survivor” as ‘Lynn Harper’, the daughter of a renowned Virginia senator, who is married to ‘Mars Harper,’ Kirkman’s new Chief of Staff.\n\nHolly’s first Hollywood big break came when she was cast as small-town ‘Deputy Sheriff Maxine Stewart’ opposite veteran actor Tom Skerritt on CBS’s iconic Emmy® Award-winning series\n\n“Picket Fences.” Perhaps most widely known for her three seasons as ‘Director Jenny Shepard’ in the acclaimed procedural series “NCIS”, Holly has also starred in many other series: she portrayed ‘Dr. Betty Rogers’ on CTV/ABC’s hit crime drama series “Motive,” appeared in the NBC miniseries “Jackie, Ethel, and Joan: Women of Camelot” alongside Jill Hennessy and Leslie Stefanson, and starred as plastic surgeon ‘Jeremy Hanlon’ on David E.

She is extremely compassionate and patient,\n\nbut having, personally, experienced violence and human injustice she has a definite “line in the sand” that should not be crossed. This mindset ties in perfectly with her role as “Jerri” whose\n\ninflexible belief in law and order crosses over to her “mama-bear” treatment of Harry’s children as well as unwavering support for Harry even though she doesn’t always agree with his decisions and personal choices in life.\n\nBobbi’s commitment to the Performing Arts spans 35+ years, and over 85 film, television, and theatre productions as well as countless commercials and voice-overs.
