        "text": "Jill Hennessy made a name for herself with starring roles in hit television shows like “Law & Order” and “Crossing Jordan.” But did you know she could sing, too?\n\nThat’s OK; apparently not many other people did either.\n\n“Oh yeah, I get that all the time,” said Hennessy in a recent telephone interview from her home in Manhattan. It’s still sort of a new thing for the general public because I started to become known when I started to do ‘Law & Order.'”\n\nThe fact is that the Canadian-born Hennessy can and does sing and she’s been doing it for quite some time. She began her show business career as a musician, singing on the streets of Toronto and later in the subways and coffeehouses of New York.\n\nAnd now she is bringing her singing and songwriting talents to Philadelphia for one show at 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 25, at World Cafe Live, a performance that will feature many cuts off her recently released debut CD, “Ghost in My Head.”\n\n“I was working with a couple of different bands at the time I auditioned for ‘Law & Order.’ I didn’t even think I’d get that show to be honest,” she said.\n\nBut she did get the show, spending four seasons from 1993 to 1996 as assistant district attorney Claire Kincade, portrayed as an idealistic outspoken feminist and agnostic who becomes increasingly disillusioned with her job.\n\n“Every acting job I’ve ever done I’ve always brought my guitar,” said Hennessy, who is self-taught on the instrument. It’s just a great way for me to center myself, calm down, and connect with other people.”\n\nDuring her years on “Law & Order,” Hennessy said that she, other cast members and the crew would oftentimes hang out with each other when not filming and connect over music.\n\n“On ‘Law & Order,’ we’d meet once a week, me and the crew and cast, and we’d just jam,” she said. “We’d do bluegrass, contemporary stuff. We were just pulling out everything we could think of and just jamming. It was great.”\n\nHer character was written out of “Law & Order” at the end of the 1996 season by being killed in a car accident when her vehicle is hit by a drunken driver.\n\nHennessy followed that with the successful and popular character Jordan Cavanaugh, the crime-solving medical examiner in “Crossing Jordan,” which ran for six seasons from 2001 to 2007 on NBC.\n\nBut despite a series of stage and film roles in addition to her television work, Hennessy, 40, said now is the time for her to concentrate on her music.\n\n“I’d always wanted to write my own music and create my own album. But I didn’t want to do it just to write an album. I wanted it to come from somewhere,” she said. “And my dad has been pushing me since I was a kid to pursue the singing.”\n\nThe end result is “Ghost in My Head,” described as a series of emotional vignettes spun with fluid melodies and poignant musical reflections on love, loss, struggle and redemption.\n\n“These are all stories from my past, things I’d wanted to get out for some time,” said Hennessy. “Basically, these things tapped me on the shoulder and said, ‘You know what, you gotta deal with this. You have to confront this. Let me out.’ That’s basically what this whole album is about.”\n\nThe title track, “Ghost in My Head” is Hennessy’s attempt to deal with something that she just didn’t want to deal with.\n\n“One of the best ways to cope with it was to write it down. So that song is a very literal account of dealing with a loss that I just didn’t want to confront,” she said. “Then after that, all these other stories came to my mind, things in my childhood or from friends of mine who had gone through some different kinds of brutal situations or ordeals. Writing music has helped me connect with people who I had become disconnected with.”\n\nAn unexpected side benefit from the project was that it enabled Hennessy to involve her family. Husband Paolo Mastropietro produced the CD. The couple has two sons, Marco, 6, who plays some drums on one of the album tracks, and Gianni, who will turn 2 in November.\n\n“We produced the CD from our kitchen table,” said Hennessy. “We got a brilliant producer, Patrick McCarthy, who we were lucky enough to meet and he was into the material. He wanted to be a part of it and put his heart and soul into it for two years.\n\nI’m really thrilled with what we accomplished,” she said. “It was kind of a benchmark in my life. It was something I never really thought I would get off my butt and conquer my fears to achieve.”\n\nAs for what the World Cafe Live crowd will see, Hennessy said it will be just Jill being Jill.\n\n“I’ve got no stage,” said Hennessy. “I wish I could get up there and be somebody cool and hip, but it ends up being just me, tuning my guitar and telling stories between songs.\n\n“It’s brilliantly terrifying because it’s so exposing,” she said. “But I really love it. I feel like I’m being more authentic than I’ve ever been and I’m really happy with that. It’s been probably the most satisfying thing I’ve ever attempted.”\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nJill Hennessy,\n\nwith Allison Polans\n\nof Papertrees opening,\n\nwill perform\n\nat World Live Cafe,\n\n3025 Walnut Street\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104\n\nFriday, Sept. 25, 8 p.m.\n\nTickets: $13.\n\nInfo: 215-222-1400 or"
