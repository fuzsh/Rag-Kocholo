        "text": "Jill Hennessy is set to recur opposite Richard Dreyfuss, Helen Hunt, Sanaa Lathan, Stephen James, Stephen Moyer and Will Patton on Shots Fired, Fox’s drama series from Gina Prince-Bythewood and Reggie Rock Bythewood that examines the dangerous aftermath of racially charged shootings in a small North Carolina town. 20th TV and Imagine TV are producing.\n\nHennessy will play Alicia Carr, the affluent mother of the teen involved in a police shooting. Angry, distraught and devastated by the death of her son at the hands of a police officer, she doesn’t care about the politics of the investigation, she just wants her son’s murderer brought to justice.\n\nHennessy, best known for her starring roles on Crossing Jordan and Law & Order, currently recurs on Madam Secretary. She will next be seen in the feature The Other. Hennessy is repped by APA and More/Medavoy Management."
