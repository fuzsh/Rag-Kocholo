In accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) and the Indiana Business Corporation Law (the “IBCL”), Merger Sub will be merged with and into Celsys (the “Merger”). Contemporaneously with the Closing (as defined in Section 1.3), (a) a Certificate of Merger and any other required documents, substantially in the form attached as EXHIBIT 1.1(A), will be duly prepared, executed and acknowledged by Celsys and Merger Sub and thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of Delaware for filing in accordance with the DGCL (the “Delaware Merger Documents”), and (b) Articles of Merger and any other required documents, substantially in the form attached as EXHIBIT 1.1(B), will be duly prepared, executed and acknowledged by Celsys and Merger Sub and thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Indiana for filing in accordance with the IBCL (the “Indiana Merger Documents,” and together with the Delaware Merger Documents, the “Merger Documents”). The Merger will become effective at the later of (y) such time as the Delaware Merger Documents have been filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware, or (z) such time as the Indiana Merger Documents have been filed with, and accepted by, the Secretary of State of the State of Indiana (the “Effective Time”). Following the Merger, Celsys will continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”) under the laws of the State of Indiana, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease.\n\n1.2 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, (i) the Merger will have all of the effects provided by the Merger Documents and applicable law; (ii) the Articles of Incorporation of Celsys will be will be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation unless and until duly amended; (iii) the bylaws of Merger Sub will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation unless and until duly amended; (iv) the directors of Merger Sub will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office in accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation; (v) the officers of Parent or persons nominated by Parent will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office in accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation; and (vi) the issued and outstanding certificates for the capital stock of Merger Sub will be the issued and outstanding certificates initially representing all of the issued capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. The Merger is intended to be a reorganization within\n\nthe meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and this Agreement is intended to constitute a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under Section 368 of the Code.\n\n1.3 Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the “Closing”) will take place on the date hereof at the offices of Xxxxxxx Procter LLP, 00 Xxxxx Xxxxxx, Xxxxxx, Xxxxxxxxxxxxx 00000 (the “Closing Date”), or at such other place as the parties select mutually. Concurrently with the Closing, the parties hereto will cause the Merger to be consummated by the filing of the Merger Documents in the manner described in Section 1.1. The Closing will be deemed to have concluded at the Effective Time.\n\nARTICLE II\n\nCONVERSION AND EXCHANGE OF SHARES\n\n2.1 Conversion of Shares of Celsvs Common Stock.\n\n(a) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, no par value, of Celsys (“Celsvs Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any and all rights, warrants or options to acquire Celsys Common Stock, convertible preferred stock and securities convertible into Celsys Common Stock that are outstanding and do not expire pursuant to their terms on or before the Closing (each of which is specifically identified in Section 3.2 of the Celsys Disclosure Schedule (as defined below)) which will be converted into Celsys Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Celsvs Converted Securities”) and excluding any Celsys Common Stock held by Parent or Merger Sub, or by Celsys, which shares (the “Excluded Shares”) will be automatically canceled in the Merger without payment of any consideration therefor), will automatically, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into:\n\n(i) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Series B 1 Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Parent (“Parent Series B 1 Preferred Stock”) equal to the Conversion Ratio. The “Conversion Ratio” means the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the quotient obtained by dividing $5,250,000 by the Series B1 Preferred Stock Value, by (y) the number of Outstanding Celsys Shares. “Series B1 Preferred Stock Value” means $8.40. “Outstanding Celsys Shares” means shares of Celsys Common Stock that are actually issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, including any Celsys Converted Securities but excluding the Excluded Shares. The aggregate number of shares of Parent Series B 1 Preferred Stock to be issued at Closing pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)(i) is referred to herein as the “Parent Merger Shares”; and\n\n(ii) in accordance with Section 2.5, cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent) in lieu of fractional shares, if any.\n\n(b) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the\n\n2\n\nMerger and without any action on the part of the holder hereof, be converted into one share of common stock, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation.\n\n2.2 Escrow Shares. At Closing, fifteen percent (15%) of the Parent Merger Shares, rounded up to the nearest whole share (the “Escrow Shares”) will be deposited by the Stockholders into escrow, such deposit to constitute an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”). Each Stockholder’s portion of the Escrow Shares shall be determined based on their respective pro rata portion of the Parent Merger Shares issued at Closing (each such Stockholder’s “Pro Rata Percentage”). The Escrow Account shall be governed by the terms hereof and the terms of the Escrow Agreement attached as EXHIBIT 2.2(A) (the “Escrow Agreement”). The Escrow Account shall serve as the first source, but not the sole source, of indemnification payments that may become due to Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(a). The Escrow Shares will be withheld on a pro rata basis among the Stockholders. The exact number of Escrow Shares held for the account of each Stockholder is set forth on EXHIBIT 2.2(B) attached hereto. The delivery of the Escrow Shares will be made on behalf of the Stockholders in accordance with the provisions hereof, with the same force and effect as if such shares had been delivered by Parent directly to the Stockholders and subsequently delivered by such Stockholders to the Escrow Agent (as such term is defined in the Escrow Agreement). The adoption of this Agreement by the Stockholders also will constitute their approval of the terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement, which is an integral term of the Merger.\n\n2.3 Delivery of Evidence of Ownership. At the Closing, each holder of a certificate or other documentation representing Outstanding Celsys Shares will surrender such certificates or other documentation to Parent, and, if not previously delivered, duly executed signature pages of the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement (as defined in Section 6. 1), and such other duly executed documentation as may be reasonably required by Parent to effect a transfer of such shares, and upon such surrender and within fifteen (15) days after the Effective Time each such holder will be entitled to receive promptly from Parent or its transfer agent certificates registered in the name of such holder representing the applicable number of Parent Merger Shares, and the cash (calculated pursuant to Section 2.5, which will be paid by check), to which such holder is entitled pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement (subject, however, with respect to the Stockholders, to a portion of such shares being deposited in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, as provided in Section 2.2). In addition to the foregoing, each Non-Managing Stockholder (as defined below), concurrently with the delivery of certificate(s) and other documentation representing Outstanding Celsys Shares (pursuant to Section 2.6 below), shall deliver to Parent a certificate wherein the Non-Managing Stockholder, individually, provides representations and warranties to Parent and Merger Sub substantially the same as those made by the Stockholders to Parent and Merger Sub in Article IV, in substantially the same form as that attached hereto as EXHIBIT 2.3 (each a “Surrender Certificate”). As used herein, “Non-Managing Stockholder(s)” means those persons holding certificates or other documentation representing Outstanding Celsys Shares, excluding the Stockholders. Pursuant to the terms of the Surrender Certificate, each Non-Managing Stockholder shall agree to indemnify and hold Parent harmless from and against, and to reimburse Parent with respect to any Indemnifiable Amounts (as defined in Article VIII) of every nature whatsoever incurred by Parent (which will be deemed to include any of the foregoing incurred by the Surviving Corporation) by reason of or arising out of or in connection with any breach, or any claim (including claims by parties other than Parent) that constitutes a breach, by such Non-Managing Stockholder of any representation\n\n3\n\nor warranty contained in the Surrender Certificate, other than any breach or related claim taken or not taken at the written direction of or after consultation with and written concurrence of Parent; provided, however, that each Non-Managing Stockholder’s obligation to indemnify Parent shall be limited to such Non-Managing Stockholder’s pro rata portion of the Parent Merger Shares issued at Closing.\n\n2.4 No Further Ownership Rights in Celsys Common Stock. The Merger and its approval by the holders of Outstanding Celsys Shares and the execution of this Agreement will be deemed, at the Effective Time, to constitute full satisfaction and termination of all rights and agreements pertaining to Celsys Common Stock pursuant to the IBCL, by contract or otherwise. After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Celsys of Celsys Common Stock or exercises of any options, warrants or other rights to acquire Celsys Common Stock. Until surrendered to Parent, each certificate for Celsys Common Stock will, after the Effective Time, represent only the right to receive Parent Merger Shares and the right to receive cash pursuant to Sections 2.1(a) and 2.5. Any dividends or other distribution declared after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Merger Shares will be paid to the holder of any certificate for shares of Celsys Common Stock when the holder thereof is entitled to receive a certificate for such holder’s Parent Merger Shares in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n2.5 No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip for fractional shares of Parent Series B1 Preferred Stock will be issued, no Parent stock split or dividend will be paid in respect of any fractional share interest, and no such fractional share interest will entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of or as a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of such fractional shares, any holder of Outstanding Celsys Shares who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Series B1 Preferred Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Series B 1 Preferred Stock to be received by such holder) will be paid the cash value of such fraction, which will be equal to such fraction multiplied by the Series B1 Preferred Stock Value.\n\nARTICLE III\n\nREPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\n\nOF CELSYS AND THE STOCKHOLDERS\n\nExcept as set forth in the disclosure schedule of Celsys dated as of the date hereof and delivered herewith to Parent (the “Celsys Disclosure Schedule”) which identifies the section and subsection to which each disclosure therein relates (provided, however, that Celsys will be deemed to have adequately disclosed with respect to any section or subsection any matters that are clearly described elsewhere in such document if the applicability of such disclosure to such non-referenced sections or subsections is clearly apparent and Celsys has not intentionally omitted any required cross-references), and whether or not the Celsys Disclosure Schedule is referred to in a specific section or subsection, Celsys and each of the Stockholders jointly and severally represent and warrant to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:\n\n3.1 Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries .\n\n4\n\n(a) Celsys is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Indiana, has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its businesses as now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which a failure to so qualify would have a material adverse effect on the Business Condition (as hereinafter defined) of Celsys.\n\nAs used in this Agreement, “Business Condition” with respect to any Person (as defined below) means the business, financial condition, results of operations or assets (without giving effect to the consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and other than changes in general economic conditions) of such Person or Persons including its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Parent will have the right to conduct any Tax audit or other Tax contest relating to the Surviving Corporation. Parent will conduct any such Tax audit or other Tax contest in good faith. With respect to any matters relating to such Tax audits or other Tax contests as to which Parent may seek indemnification hereunder, Parent shall consult with the Celsys Stockholders Representative (as such term is defined in the Escrow Agreement) and allow him to comment before taking any position or making any written submission with any Governmental Entity with regard to any indemnifiable matter.\n\n8.4 Limitations.

Parent will not be entitled to seek cash compensation from the Stockholders to satisfy any indemnification claim sought pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.\n\n8.5 Binding Effect. The indemnification obligations contained in this Article VIII are an integral part of this Agreement and the Merger in the absence of which Parent would not have entered into this Agreement.\n\n8.6 Time Limit. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Parent, Merger Sub, Celsys and the Stockholders set forth in this Agreement will survive the Closing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but any claims with respect thereto may be made only on or before the first year anniversary of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that claims alleging fraud or willful misstatements or omissions of Parent, Merger Sub, Celsys or the Stockholders may be made only on or before the third year anniversary of the Closing Date and claims relating to or arising from breaches of Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.7, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 (the “Excluded Representations”) and Article IV shall survive until expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The period of time that a representation or warranty or covenant survives the Closing pursuant to this Section 8.7 shall be the “Indemnity Period” with respect to such representation or warranty or covenant. No claim for breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant, agreement or obligation may be asserted after the expiration of the Indemnity Period; provided that any claim for indemnification described in a Parent Cure Notice delivered pursuant to Section 8.1(b) and within the applicable Indemnity Period shall survive until final resolution of such claim.\n"
