        "text": "We have short memories. Margot Asquith, once a household name as the formidable wife of prime minister H H Asquith at the start of the First World War, is now recalled, if at all, for a single quip. When she was introduced to the American film star and sex symbol, Jean Harlow, Margot Asquith uttered a famous put-down, correcting the latter’s mispronunciation of her first name with the words: “The 't’ is silent, as in Harlow.”\n\nAnne de Courcy chooses not to include this much-repeated feat of acerbic wit by Mrs Asquith in her new biography, Margot at War, which begins in 1912. When I raise it, she shakes her head and laughs. “It’s a myth. Margot didn’t say it. It was made up.”\n\nAs, by her account, was much else about Margot. She was apparently someone people liked to make up things about. Lord Alfred Douglas, poet and lover of Oscar Wilde, penned a satirical verse in 1915 accusing “merry Margot” of cuckolding her husband with other women in 10 Downing Street while young men were dying in the trenches in northern France.\n\nAgain it was, de Courcy shows, untrue as well as malicious. Indeed, there was some cuckolding – but not by Margot. When he was meant to be leading a country embroiled in a bloody war, Asquith had fallen in love with Venetia Stanley, a friend of his daughter Violet (by his first wife with whom he had five children) and 35 years his junior. He would sit in cabinet meetings writing her love letters. To complicate matters, his private secretary was smitten by Violet.\n\n“Can you imagine?” says de Courcy. “That was a tragic period in Margot’s life, but the public at large knew nothing about it.” Perhaps they might have judged her more kindly if they had.\n\nToday, many might nominate Cherie Blair as the most unpopular prime minister’s spouse of modern times, but Anne de Courcy believes Margot Asquith suffered more. “Imagine having people say in the middle of a world war that the prime minister’s wife is a traitor. That’s what they said about Margot. She had to go to court twice to stop the public accusations that she was sending parcels to German officers, or playing tennis with them in a prisoner-of-war camp. And even then it remained common currency.”\n\nBiographers are, of course, notoriously partisan about their subjects. And de Courcy – she is chairman of the Biographers’ Club, with a stream of titles to her name, including lives of Diana Mosley and Lord Snowdon, as well as the recent bestseller The Fishing Fleet: Husband‑Hunting in the Raj – is unashamedly on Margot’s side.\n\n“I was always fascinated by her,” she explains, perched on a well-plumped sofa in a big, bright Chelsea sitting room that is as elegant as its owner. “Margot was a woman of extraordinary style. She flashed through London society at a time when society was very hard to break into. She behaved quite differently from other girls at the time.”\n\nThe sixth daughter and one of 11 children of Charles Tennant and his wife Emma, Margot had enjoyed a girlhood unshackled by the usual restraints imposed on her sex, roaming the moorlands at will near the family estate, Glenn, in Peebleshire. Her sporting passions were riding and golf, but she was as admired for her sharp wit and intelligence. When she and her sister Laura, to whom she was devoted, arrived in London they were soon the key female figures of an aristocratic group of intellectuals dubbed The Souls. Following her marriage in 1894, Margot, then aged 30, introduced her husband to a glittering social milieu. She loved entertaining and hosted illustrious gatherings of artists, politicians and the aristocracy at the Asquith homes in Cavendish Square, Oxfordshire and Downing Street, where they lived between 1908 and 1916.\n\nWhy was it that so many people disliked her? Because she dared to be different? “She was very truthful. So in the case of being pro-German, she had been to Munich when she was 17 to be finished, as many people did back then, and she admired German music and culture. Most would have kept quiet about it during the war, when the anti-German feeling was so horrendous, but Margot wouldn’t lie.”\n\nMargot, who bore five children, of whom only two survived infancy, pursued a career as a writer after her husband’s death in 1928 left her with little money. Dorothy Parker famously reviewed one of her works, writing that: “The affair between Margot Asquith and Margot Asquith will live as one of the prettiest love stories in all literature.”\n\nIt is not something one could ever accuse de Courcy of. A former journalist, she is expert at chasing down every last detail about her subjects, but her natural inclination is to be coy about herself. “I hate talking about me,” she pleads, and tries to move the conversation on. Her many years as a Fleet Street interviewer – asking the questions, rather than answering them – make her very hard indeed to pin down.\n\nShe mentions briefly her three grown-up children by her second 1959 marriage to Robert Armitage, plus her four grandchildren. And she talks fondly about the Cotswolds’ cottage and garden, inherited from her mother, where she now spends part of her time. Or did, until it was engulfed in flames.\n\n“I was woken up by my floorboards burning,” she says. “It was a terrible crackle.” She called the fire brigade – “they took half an hour to come” – and then calmly describes making her way down the stairs through flames so hot they made her feel as if she was breathing in pure heat. It must have been terrifying? “No,” she replies with a wonderful stiff upper lip, “it’s just what you do, isn’t it?”\n\nDe Courcy is reluctant to see any parallel between her own social background and the subject of her books. Since The English in Love: Passion Among the Elite came out in 1986, all have focused on the upper or upper-middle echelons of society. Her upbringing in Gloucestershire was, she concedes, privileged “up to a point, though not money-wise at all”, but there is, she insists, an altogether more practical reason for her choice of subjects. “It is largely among the sort of people who had the leisure time to write them that you find the most diaries and documentation. As a social historian, that’s what I like. It is as simple as that. They all wrote letters.”\n\nDe Courcy’s own writing began in the mid-Fifties, after her first husband Michael de Courcy died in a plane crash two years after their wedding, leaving her a widow at just 22. “I thought I must have something absorbing in my life. I remember going to Malta straight afterwards. I kept thinking, 'What shall I do when I go back to London?’, and somebody said to me, 'Any fool can write’. Not true, of course, but it was a light bulb moment for me. I suppose I’d always known I would write.”\n\nThough she was not among the first wave of pioneering female journalists – “there were plenty of women around on Fleet Street when I started out” – building a career still required persistence. She started as a sub-editor on House Beautiful. “Then I got on to a magazine called Britannia and Eve as fashion editor, where I wrote under five different names. And then the Evening News contacted me under one of my pseudonyms.”\n\nIt was the start of a decade there as a columnist and women’s editor, followed by 10 more years at its London rival, the Evening Standard. She was drawn to writing her first book on kitchens (published in 1973), she recalls, because she thought it would help her progress her career. “I wanted them to take me more seriously and a book is a good calling card.”\n\nNot many authors, when asked, quote that as their inspiration. It’s perhaps a glimpse of the Margot Asquith in her – the urge to tell the unvarnished truth. Is her evident passion for her subject, I wonder aloud, because the two of them are a little bit alike?\n\nDe Courcy frowns. “I hope you’re going to be nice about me,” she ticks me off, half-humorously, but slightly school-marmish. “Yes, I like good clothes, yes I’m reasonably slim, but otherwise,” she adds, “I’d say no.”"
