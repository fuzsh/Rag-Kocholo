        "text": "The Volunteer\n\nHere lies a clerk who half his life had spent\n\nToiling at ledgers in a city grey,\n\nThinking that so his days would drift away\n\nWith no lance broken in life’s tournament\n\nYet ever ‘twixt the books and his bright eyes\n\nThe gleaming eagles of the legions came,\n\nAnd horsemen, charging under phantom skies,\n\nWent thundering past beneath the oriflamme.\n\nAnd now those waiting dreams are satisfied\n\nFrom twilight to the halls of dawn he went;\n\nHis lance is broken; but he lies content\n\nWith that high hour, in which he lived and died.\n\nAnd falling thus, he wants no recompense,\n\nWho found his battle in the last resort\n\nNor needs he any hearse to bear him hence,\n\nWho goes to join the men of Agincourt.\n\nNOTES\n\nThis poem tells the story of an office worker who has died in battle on the front. Once he was a frustrated clerk living a boring life, living out his heroic fantasies through books. Dying for his country he finds true satisfaction, having lived out his heroic dreams. Asquith wrote this poem in 1912 when working as a lawyer in the City [many thanks to the excellent blog Great War Fiction for correcting my own previous error and therefore an erroneous reading].\n\nSTRUCTURE: Written in a rather rigid iambic pentameter— obviously attempting a high-flown, elevated style— this is comprised of two octet stanzas of the same rhyme scheme, ABBACDCD.\n\n‘The Volunteer’: this poem praises the noble death of a volunteer who chose to go and fight for Britain.\n\nHerbert Asquith: Herbert Asquith was the son of the liberal British Prime Minister of the same name who led Britain from 1910-16.\n\n“Here lies a clerk”: the poem begins in the style of an epitaph for a clerk, or office worker.\n\n“toiling at ledgers in a city grey”: the office worker’s life is boring and undemanding: as grey as the city.\n\n“…no lance broken in life’s tournament…”: a picturesque metaphor for seeing action in war: medieval tournaments saw knights riding and fighting against one another for the approval of the king. A lance broken would mean defeat for the knight. The metaphor reflects the kind of romantic literature that the clerk obviously reads for amusement; the adventures of the Knights of the Round Table, and so on.\n\n“ever ‘twixt the books… The gleaming eagles of the legions came ”: the clerk’s imagination goes wild while reading the boring ledger books. Images of marching Roman legions distract him and so come ’twixt, or between the ledgers and his “bright eyes”.\n\n“horsemen… went thundering past beneath the oriflamme”: the Oriflamme was the red battle standard (flag) of the French King’s army. This is another reference to the Romantic medieval fantasies of the clerk.\n\n“And now those waiting dreams are satisfied…”: the second stanza is concerned with the fulfillment of the clerk’s heroic fantasies on the field of battle.\n\n“twilight to the gleaming halls of dawn”: the half-lit spaces of the office are compared with the “gleaming halls” of the afterlife. The imagery of light and luxury expresses the contrast.\n\n“His lance is broken: but he lies content…”: The imagery here is of a knight defeated in a tournament. A lance was a long, large spear that the knight would bear as he rode on his horse. The broken lance means defeat in the tournament (in a curiously phallic image): by this euphemistic metaphor, the clerk has died in battle, but is happy (“content”).\n\n“Falling thus he wants no recompense”: dying in this pleasing way, he needs no other compensation for losing his life.\n\n“Nor need he any hearse…Who goes to join the men of Agincourt”: No hearse (funeral car) is needed because the clerk lives on in name and glory. He is elevated to a place among the greatest historical heroes that have died in France for England: the men of Henry V, who though outnumbered defeated the French army on French soil at the Battle of Agincourt.\n\n[ANTHOLOGY NOTE: The naive style of this poem means that it can be usefully compared with the work of Pope. This poem can also be compared with the attitudes expressed in Kipling’s epitaph, ‘Ex-Clerk’ (p.214). As a mixture of patriotism, some little social snobbery and old-fashioned Romantic fantasy, it is a fascinating snapshot of the attitudes of some prior to the beginning of the war. The poem also references the great patriotic work of Shakespeare, Henry V: which retells the story of the victories of Henry V in France, which includes the Battle of Agincourt.]"
