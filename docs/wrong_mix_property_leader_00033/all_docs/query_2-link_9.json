        "text": "Include an in-text citation when you refer to, summarize, paraphrase, or quote from another source. For every in-text citation in your paper, there must be a corresponding entry in your reference list.\n\nAPA in-text citation style uses the author's last name and the year of publication, for example: (Field, 2005). For direct quotations, include the page number as well, for example: (Field, 2005, p. 14). For sources such as websites and e-books that have no page numbers, use a paragraph number, for example: (Field, 2005, para. 1). More information on direct quotation of sources without pagination is given on the APA Style and Grammar Guidelines web page.\n\nExample paragraph with in-text citation\n\nA few researchers in the linguistics field have developed training programs designed to improve native speakers' ability to understand accented speech (Derwing et al., 2002; Thomas, 2004). Their training techniques are based on the research described above indicating that comprehension improves with exposure to non-native speech. Derwing et al. (2002) conducted their training with students preparing to be social workers, but note that other professionals who work with non-native speakers could benefit from a similar program.\n\nReferences\n\nDerwing, T.

For sources with no author, use the title in place of an author.\n\nFor sources with no date use n.d. (for no date) in place of the year: (Smith, n.d.).

In-text references should always precede punctuation marks. Below are examples of using in-text citation.\n\nAuthor's name in parentheses:\n\nOne study found that the most important element in comprehending non-native speech is familiarity with the topic (Gass & Varonis, 1984).\n\nAuthor's name part of narrative:\n\nGass and Varonis (1984) found that the most important element in comprehending non-native speech is familiarity with the topic.\n\nGroup as author:\n\nFirst citation: (American Psychological Association [APA], 2015)\n\nSubsequent citation: (APA, 2015)\n\nMultiple works: (separate each work with semi-colons)\n\nResearch shows that listening to a particular accent improves comprehension of accented speech in general (Gass & Varonis, 1984; Krech Thomas, 2004).\n\nDirect quote: (include page number and place quotation marks around the direct quote)\n\nOne study found that “the listener's familiarity with the topic of discourse greatly facilitates the interpretation of the entire message” (Gass & Varonis, 1984, p. 85).\n\nGass and Varonis (1984) found that “the listener’s familiarity with the topic of discourse greatly facilitates the interpretation of the entire message” (p. 85).\n\nNote: For direct quotations of more than 40 words, display the quote as an indented block of text without quotation marks and include the authors’ names, year, and page number in parentheses at the end of the quote. For example:\n\nThis suggests that familiarity with nonnative speech in general, although it is clearly not as important a variable as topic familiarity, may indeed have some effect. That is, prior experience with nonnative speech, such as that gained by listening to the reading, facilitates comprehension. (Gass & Varonis, 1984, p. 77)"
