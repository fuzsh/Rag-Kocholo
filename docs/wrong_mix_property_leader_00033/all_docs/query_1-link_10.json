Asquith, British Prime Minister — with whom he is frequently confused — and younger brother of Raymond Asquith. His wife Lady Cynthia Asquith, whom he married in 1910, the daughter of Hugo Richard Charteris, 11th Earl of Wemyss (1857–1937), was also a writer.\n\nAsquith was greatly affected by his service with the Royal Artillery in World War I.[1] His poems include \"The Volunteer\" and \"The Fallen Subaltern\", the latter being a tribute to fallen soldiers; his poem \"Soldiers at Peace\" was set to music by Ina Boyle. His novels include the best-selling Young Orland set during and after the First World War; Wind's End; Mary Dallon; and Roon.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
