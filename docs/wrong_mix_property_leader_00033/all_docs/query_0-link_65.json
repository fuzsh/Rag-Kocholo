        "text": "'Dick Leonard's insightful, fair-minded and marvellously readable study of the twenty British prime ministers of the twentieth century fills a glaring gap in the literature on modern British history and politics. It will be a 'must' for sixth-form and University reading lists; and no one interested in the role of the individual in politics should be without it.' - Professor David Marquand, former Principal of Mansfield College, Oxford, and Biographer of Ramsay MacDonald\n\n'A very great achievement.' - David Owen\n\n'Immensely informative, beautifully written...both instructive and entertaining.' - Roy Hattersley\n\n'An excellent book,' - Michael Heseltine\n\n'A brilliantly balanced, and lasting, view.' - Clive Bradley, former Chief Executive of the Publishers Association\n\n'Leonard has produced a reliable work, which will prove particularly useful to students of British History. We can only hope that he finds the time to finish the next two volumes as quickly as possible.' - Humanities - Sozial- und Kulturgeschichte\n\nAccess this book\n\nSubscribe and save\n\nSpringer+ Basic\n\nEUR 32.99 /Month\n\nGet 10 units per month\n\nDownload Article/Chapter or eBook\n\n1 Unit = 1 Article or 1 Chapter\n\nCancel anytime\n\nSubscribe now\n\nBuy Now\n\neBook EUR 9.99 EUR 85.59\n\nDiscount applied Price includes VAT (Germany)\n\nAvailable as PDF\n\nRead on any device\n\nInstant download\n\nOwn it forever\n\nSoftcover Book EUR 106.99\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nCompact, lightweight edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nHardcover Book EUR 106.99\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nDurable hardcover edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\n\nOther ways to access"
