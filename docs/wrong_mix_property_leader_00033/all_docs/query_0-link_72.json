        "text": "Herbert Henry Asquith, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, collapsed and died on Sunday 2 April 1911 in 10 Downing Street. (1) The cause of death was hypertension caused by high alcohol consumption. He was 58 years old and was survived by his wife, Margaret, and their four sons and three daughters. He had been Prime Minister for three days short of three years, since 5 April 1908. It was known in political circles that Asquith was a heavy drinker, but not by the general public. He enjoyed brandy and wine.\n\nThe next day, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, led tributes to Asquith in the House of Commons. He was followed by the leaders of the Conservative and Unionist Party, and the Irish Parliamentary Party, Arthur Balfour and John Redmond respectively, and by the chairman of the Labour Party in the House of Commons, Ramsay MacDonald. Later that month a memorial service was held for him in Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe Liberal Party now needed to choose a new leader, and therefore Prime Minister. There was no heir apparent as there was when Asquith succeeded Henry Campbell-Bannerman three years earlier. There was not a set procedure for choosing the party leader. The new leader would be the man who had the backing of a consensus of the 269 Liberal MPs.\n\nLloyd George and the Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, both wanted to be party leader and Prime Minister. Grey was backed by right wing MPs. Lloyd George had the support of not only radical MPs, but also the bulk of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons. On 8 April 1911 he became party leader and Prime Minister, at the age of forty-nine.\n\n(1) In OTL he nearly collapsed on that date. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Henry_Asquith, reference (104).\n\nLloyd George and the Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, both wanted to be party leader and Prime Minister. Grey was backed by right wing MPs. Lloyd George had the support of not only radical MPs, but also the bulk of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons. On 8 April 1911 he became party leader and Prime Minister, at the age of forty-nine.\n\nI would question a couple things here. First, and largest, I am not sure L-G was in a position to win the leadership in 1911. He had a few years as Chancellor, true, but he was a relatively new up and comer before that. He was definitely a man to watch for the future but I am skeptical that he had required base to win it. The Radicals were loud but they were a minority in the Liberal party, and had been in slight decline over the past years. He was not well liked outside of the Radical group.\n\nSecond, if there is only going to be one candidate considered from the Liberal Imperialist side, I am not sure it would be Grey. While well known and respected I think Haldane might be a more attractive prospect than Grey in 1911. He hits many of the same notes that Asquith did.\n\nIt seems more likely to me that Haldane, Grey and MacKenna among others might be front runners before L-G. He could still perhaps win if he were to come up the middle between such candidates as he would probably be the leading Radical vote, but I don’t think he could gain as clear a victory as is presented here in 1911.\n\nThe House of Commons gave a second reading to the Women's Enfranchisement Bill on 5 May 1911, by 255 votes to 88 votes. This was a Private Member's Bill and would have given women householders the right to vote in parliamentary elections. (1) Women already had the franchise for local elections. After the vote, the Prime Minister, Sir Edward Grey, told the House of Commons that the government would give parliamentary time for the bill. It was sent to a Committee of the Whole House, and passed through all its stages in the Commons by 6th July 1911.\n\nIts second reading was debated by the House of Lords on 29 November 1911, and rejected by 188 votes to 169 votes. In reply to a question from a Liberal MP the following day, Grey said that the government would use the Parliament Act to ensure that the bill became law. The Parliament Bill received the royal assent on 18 August 1911. It abolished the veto power of the Lords and limited the time they could delay non money bills to two sessions of parliament, and money bills to one month.\n\nThe Women's Enfranchisement Bill had already passed the House of Commons in one session. It was re-introduced in the Commons for a second time in February 1912, passed through all its stages by April, and rejected by the Lords in May. It was introduced again in the Commons on 16 April 1913, and passed through all its stages by 8 May 1913. It received the royal assent the next day.\n\n(1) It was also known as the Conciliation Bill, and according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conciliation_Bills, the Conciliation Bills would have given the right to vote to just over a million wealthy property owning women. However the Liberal MP who moved the second reading of the bill said that it gave the franchise to women who were householders. See http://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1911/may/05/womens-enfranchisement-bill.\n\nAs the Women's Enfranchisement Bill was going through the House of Commons for the first time, a government amendment was passed which gave adult women the vote on the same terms as men, in elections to the House of Commons. Also married women qualified on the their husband's qualification. That is if they were freeholders or leaseholders, or tenants who paid a minimum annual rent of £10 (about £ 3 17 shillings a week). However if they moved house to a different constituency, they would not be eligible until the next registration date.\n\nAdult children living at home with their parents were not eligible for the vote,\n\nunless, I assume, they contributed to the mortgage or rent. Also live-in domestic servants were not eligible, most of whom were female, nor were people in receipt of poor relief. Women who owned businesses qualified for the business vote, though I expect the number was small. But wives of business owners did not. Business owners had one vote for each business premises, in additional to their residential vote. A Plural Voting Bill which would have abolished the business vote, was thrown out by the House of Lords in 1912.\n\nAn estimated 40 per cent of adult males were not registered to vote, and I guess it would be roughly the same percentage for adult females. The compilation of electoral registers was the responsibilty of poor law guardians. However party agents claimed for their party in disputed cases of eligibility for the vote.\n\nThe Women's Social and Political Union ended their militant campaign for votes for women. Emily Davison did not run onto the race course during the 1913 Epsom Derby, and was mortally injured when she tried to seize the reins of King George V's horse. They and the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies campaigned for full adult female suffrage.\n\nUnder the Succession to the Crown Act 1707, Masterman and Tennant were obliged to seek re-election to the House of Commons on being appointed to the cabinet. Tennant was easily re-elected in Berwickshre in a by-election on 22 June\n\n1911. However Masterman's election as Liberal MP for West Ham North in the December 1910 general election, was declared void after his defeated Conswrvative petioned the courts. Masterman's election agent was found guilty of corrupt practices because he failed to check the accounts and election expenses. Masterman was not allowed to stand again in West Ham North, but he was elected in Bethnal Green South-West in a by-election on 22 June. (1)\n\nSir Edward Grey was a reluctant supporter of Irish Home Rule. He did not speak in the debate on the second reading of the first Home Rule Bill in May and June 1886, nor in the debates on the second Home Rule Bill in 1893 because he was a junior Foreign Office minister. However he was interested in Irish land reform. In 1890 he rebelled against his party leaders and voted for the Conservative government's Land Purchase Bill.\n\nGrey was asked several times in 1912 by Irish Parlamentary Party and Liberal MPs, when a Home Rule Bill would be introduced in the House of Commons. He told them that it would be when there was parliamentary time, as the government had a heavy legislative programme.\n\nThe second reading of the Government of Ireland Bill was debated in the House of Commons over seven days on 15 to 17, and 21 to 24 April 1913. (2) It provided for the establishment of an Irish government and parliament which would be reaponsible for Irish internal affairs. The parliament would consist of an elected House of Commons of 164 members, and a Senate of 40 members nominated by the Irish government.\n\nThe following matters were excluded from the powers of the Irish government and parliament: the crown and the succession, foreign policy and defence policy, treason, navigation and overseas trade, lighthouses, coinage, weights and measures, patents, land purchase, national insurance, old age pensions, labour exchanges, tax collection, public loans which originated before 1913, and control over the police, which would transferred after six years. No laws were to be enacted to establish or endow any religious body. The Lord-Lieutenant would be the nominal head of the Irish government, which would be responsible to the Irish parliament. He would be appointed for a term of six years and need not necassarily be a Protestant, He would have the right of veto over Irish legislation acting on the advice of the British government. Forty-two Irish MPs were to sit in the UK House of Commons, down from one hundred and three.\n\nThe Irish parliament would have the power to increase the rates of excise duties, customs duties on beer and spirits, land tax and stamp duty. It could increase income tax and death duties up to a total of ten per cent of the yield. It could also levy new taxes for its own internal purposes, (3)\n\nThe bill received a second reading on 24 April by a majority of 96 votes. It then went to a Committee of the Whole House where it was debated line by line. After it passed the Commons, it went to the House of Lords which rejected it in January 1914 by a majority of 257 votes.\n\n(1) This was as in OTL, except that the Bethnal Green by-election was on 8 July 1911. However when Masterman was appointed to the cabinet in February 1914, he was defeated when he stood for re-election in Bethnal Green, and did not return to the House of Commons until the December 1923 general election.\n\n(2) This was a year less two to three weeks later than the second reading debate on the Government of Ireland Bill in OTL.\n\n(3) The provisions of the bill were the same as those of the Government of Ireland Bill in OTL, and are taken from the book Home Rule and the Irish Question by Grenfell Morton, London: Longman Group Ltd 1980.\n\nThe Irish Home Rule Bill was passionately and vehemently opposed by Unionists in the north of Ireland. Starting on Saturday 13 September 1913 in Belfast, it is estimated that over 470,000 people signed the Solemn League and Covenant, some in their own blood. Edward Carson was the first person to sign. They pledged themselves 'in solemn covenant throughout this time of threatened calamity to stand by one another in defending for ourselves and our children our cherished position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom, in using all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present conspiracy to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland. And in the event of such a Parliament being forced upon us we further solemnly and mutually pledge ourselves to refuse to recognise its authority.' (1)\n\nIn January 1914, the Ulster Unionist Council established the Ulster Volunteer Force. This was an unarmed paramilitary force. The Home Rule Bill was debated for a second time in the House of Commons in April and May 1914, and passed through all its stages. It was rejected by the House of Lords by a large majority at its second reading on 9 June 1914.\n\nOn Sunday 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, nephew of Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary, and his wife Sophie, made an official visit to Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Black Hand, a Serbian terrorist group, planned to assassinate Franz Ferdinand. Ferdinand's motorcade of three cars was on its way from Sarajevo railway station to the Town Hall. As it passed the Mostar cafe, an intended assassin threw his bomb. It bounced off the folded back cover of Ferdinand's car into the road. It then exploded under the car behind, wounding 17 to 20 people.\n\nAfter the Town Hall reception, Ferdinand and Sophie changed their plans. They would instead visit in hospital those wounded by the bomb. At 10.45 am, they got into the third car in the motorcade, which went along Appel Quay. At the Latin Bridge, the first two cars turned right, followed by Ferdinand's car. General Oskar Potiotek, who was in that car, told the driver that he was going the wrong way. The driver stopped the car. (2) He put it into reverse gear and drove back to Appel Quay. In OTL, the driver accidently stalled the car's engine when he tried to put into reverse gear, thus giving Gavril Princip the opportunity to kill Ferdinand and Sophie.\n\nPrincip was waiting in front of Schiller's delicatessen to assassinate Franz Ferdinand. He saw Ferdinand's car going back down the street and shot at it with his pistol. The bullets hit the car, but did not hurt anyone. The motorcade crossed the Latin Bridge and went to the hospital,\n\nIn this timeline no one was killed in Sarajevo that day, and no more people wounded than those injured by the bomb. Therefore there was no Great War as it happened in OTL.\n\n(1) This was wording as the Solemn League and Covenant signed from 28 September 1912 in OTL. It is taken from the book Home Rule and the Irish Question by Grenfell Morton, London : Longman Group Ltd, 1980.\n\n(2) Up to here was as in OTL and taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Franz_Ferdinand.\n\nIn spite of the amendments to the Home Rule Bill, the Conservatives and Ulster Unionist still opposed Home Rule for Ireland. In April 1915, arms for the Ulster Volunteers were landed at harbours on the east coasts of counties Antrim and Down. In June 1915, guns for the Irish Volunteers were landed at Howth, near Dublin, from Erskine Childer's yacht Asgard . (1)\n\nThe Land Enquiry was launched by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sydney Buxton, in June 1912. Its first report was published in October 1913. It found that over 60 per cent of agricultural labourers were paid less than 18 shillings (90 pence) a week, and twenty to thirty thousand less than 16 shillings (80 pence) a week. It recommended a living wage to be enforced by a form of wages tribunal. It also recommended a state housing initiative to provide the 120,000 new cottages which were needed.\n\nThe Departmental Committee on Land Taxation reported in March 1914. The Majority Report by seven members rejected the taxation of site-values. The Minority Report by six members advocated a local site-value tax, and that half of all future increases in local expenditure should be met by a tax on site values.\n\nIn his budget speech on 4 May 1914, Buxton told the House of Commons that the annual values and the total values of site-values had been assessed. It only remained to ascertain the value of agricultural improvements. The budget on 4 May 1915 provided for site-value taxation, which would not be implemented until after the general election due later that year.\n\n(1) For Childers see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erskine_Childers_(author)\n\nMarquess of Crewe took up office as Governor-General of South Africa on 8 September 1914, in place of Herbert Gladstone who returned to the UK. (1) Crewe was both Lord Privy Seal and India Secretary. Sir Edward Grey made the following changes to his government:\n\nEarl Carrington from President Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to Lord Privy Seal,\n\nLord Lucas promoted from Parliamentary Secretary Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries,\n\nFrancis Acland from Financial Secretary to the Treasury to India Secretary,\n\nWilliam Wedgwood Benn from Parliamentary Secretary Local Government Board to Financial Secretary to the Treasury.\n\nThe Plural Voting Act 1915 abolished the additional votes possessed by owners of business premises, and the university graduate franchise. So the university seats were abolished.\n\nThe general election for the Irish House of Commons was held on Thursday 15 September 1915. The number of seats won by each party were as follows:\n\nIrish Nationalist: 97\n\nAll-for-Ireland: 31\n\nUnionist: 27\n\nLiberal: 4\n\nIrish Labour: 2\n\nIndependent Nationalist: 1\n\n--------------------------\n\nTotal: 162 (162)\n\n--------------------------\n\nThe Irish Nationalist majority over all others was 32. Sinn Fein contested 28 seats, but did not win any, John Redmond became President of the Executive Council.\n\nOn 29 September 1915, King George V opened the Irish Parliament in Leinster House. (2) He also read the King's Speech setting out the Irish government's legislative programme for the parliamentary session. He and his wife, Queen Mary, were met by cheering crowds as they were driven through the streets of Dublin in the state coach.\n\n(1) In OTL Sydney Buxton became Governor-General of South Africa. In this timeline he was Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\n(2) See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leinster_House."
