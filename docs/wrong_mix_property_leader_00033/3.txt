Herbert Asquith (1881-1947) was the second son of H. H. Asquith, British Prime Minister, with whom he is frequently confused, and younger brother of Raymond Asquith. His wife Lady Cynthia Asquith, whom he married in 1910, the daughter of Hugo Richard Charteris, 11th Earl of Wemyss (1857–1937), was also a writer. Asquith was greatly affected by his service with the Royal Artillery in World War I. His poems include “The Volunteer” and “The Fallen Subaltern”, the latter being a tribute to fallen soldiers.
