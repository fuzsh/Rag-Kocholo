        "text": "At this point, who isn't a Swiftie? And wow are celebrities themselves big fans as well and that includes New Hampshire's own Adam Sandler.\n\nLike many fans of Taylor, we span from pre-teen to boomer, everyday humans like you and I, to A-listers and politicians.\n\nWhat's even more human is when we learn that a massive star like Adam can be nervous around another celebrity.\n\nAccording to People Magazine, Conan O'Brien spoke with 57-year-old Adam on his Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend podcast and asked him what it's like to meet other big celebrities and if any make him nervous or star-struck. He admitted that Taylor makes him nervous because of his two daughters, Sadie who is 17, and Sunny who is 15.\n\nYou know what, Taylor Swift, because what she means to my kids, I get a little jumpy. Just cause I don't wanna blow it for my kids. So I'm a little like, 'Taylor, Taylor,' like I talk a little too loud or something. I don't stay as cool as I can.\n\nAdam along with his wife Jackie was caught on video with Sunny and Sadie at the premiere of Taylor's Eras Tour film in Los Angeles getting some one-on-one love from the mega superstar so to be a fly on the wall to see if Adam did lose his coolness factor or not.\n\nAccording to E! News Online, Taylor showered her love back to the Swiftie family and as you can see in the videos below there are hugs, selfies, and then Adam dancing his heart out with Taylor during the movie.\n\nIt looks like Taylor is just as much of an Adam fan, don't you think? I mean there she is with Adam as he dances his heart out to one of Taylor's most popular songs, \"Karma\".\n\nLook at Adam DANCE, a trademark Hawaiian shirt and all. I love it."
