Kelly &amp; Tom interrupt their vacation to discuss the 1962 David Lean classic, Lawrence of Arabia with Bald Move network co-founder A.Ron Hubbard. They manage to clock in at about half the film’s 4-hour runtime, so this podcast is a real timesaver. Much lively chatter ensues about negging in the desert, the many parallels between Lawrence and Dune, bastards choosing their own names, the unbearable hotness of Sherif Ali, whether a woman would ever direct a movie about a charismatic leader, and the nonexistence of quicksand, Kelly gets really upset about the R2D2 and C-3P0 of the movie, Tom keeps everybody on track, and A.Ron’s beard steals the show.",

        "text": "Three Buttons and a Bean\n\n02:09:13|\n\n*gong noise* Kelly and Amy are back with a little holiday cheer as they recap Kenneth Branagh's A Midwinter's Tale (or In the Bleak Midwinter to our UK Cousins), a 1995 black-and-white love letter to Shakespeare, the power of live theatre and Joan Collins. They discuss their obsession with Bravo's Below Deck Mediterranean, people making horrible choices, the casual homophobia of the mid-90s, FADGE, eating chili in England,Rita Repulsa, the Burning Man of the East, what the fox says, a church run by organized crime, Sporkle quizzes, a brief history of camp and the real-life inspiration for Hamlet. Want more Amy in your life? Follow the Instagram for her new podcast @thesearejustcards for her take on tarot.\n\nFlimsy as a Floozy\n\n02:21:59|\n\nNEAME willing, Kelly & Amy are proud to present their last Downton Abbey recap ever. All your favorites are here for the movie: Fashion Backwards, Amy Repeats History and a litany of goofy-ass callbacks to episodes past. They worry that this movie might get nominated for a gd Oscar, speculate about Matthew Goode's reaction to being contractually obligated to appear in this enjoyable but ultimately pointless thing, learn about hot gay sex throughout history, rejoice that there's basically no plot for Bates, call Isobel an Isoballer, get weepy at Maggie Smith's final scene as the Dowager Countess and Thomas' trip to the gay bar, ponder the inevitable zombie-laden sequel and lambast Branson one last time for being such a traitor to the cause of Irish independence.Finally, we can't thank you Cousins enough for your many, many years of loyal fandom. You've been with us through the good, the bad and the downright weird (Strumpet City, we're looking at you). There's not a Molesley among you, and we certainly hope you'll be along for whatever projects we cook up next. We won't be far away--you can find us on Twitter, where we often make humor jokes. Our handles are @kellyanneken & @TheCynicalBetch. See you on the internets!LUNCHEON OUT (for reals, though)!"
