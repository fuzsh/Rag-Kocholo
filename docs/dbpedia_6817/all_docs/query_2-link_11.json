        "text": "Spy movies have been a staple of Hollywood for decades, but how many of them actually get it right? Spycraft Entertainment‚Äôs John Sipher joins Marc Polymeropoulos to talk about what makes for a good spy story, and why more accurate depictions of the intelligence community make for great entertainment. John and Marc also discuss the generational divide between the old guard and Gen Z at the CIA and more. https://ow.ly/m3CA50QvCRM\n\nüé• Record-Breaking Trailer üé• The Deadpool & Wolverine trailer alone has achieved something no other MCU film has managed. It has more F-bombs (and swear words in general) than all previous MCU movies combined! ü§Ø In this 2-minute and 39-second teaser, there are no less than six uncensored F-bombs dropped. And that‚Äôs not even counting other colorful language! ü§¨ Notably, the first F-bomb wasn‚Äôt even heard in an MCU movie until 2023‚Äôs Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Star Chris Pratt and director James Gunn revealed that the line was improvised and wasn‚Äôt guaranteed to make the final cut. But it opened the door for Deadpool & Wolverine to go all out with its vulgarity. ü§≠ The trailer is just a small taste of the R-rated content awaiting fans in the full film. Brace yourselves for more profanity, humor, and action when Deadpool and Wolverine team up against a multiversal threat! üöÄ Fun Fact: The first real look at Hugh Jackman back in action as Wolverine is already breaking records. It‚Äôs a wild ride, and fans can‚Äôt wait for the movie‚Äôs release on July 26, 2024! üé¨ #Deadpool #Marvel #Wolverine #RyanReynolds #HughJackman #Superhero #MCU #MovieMagic #ActionComedy #TeamUp Join the hype train, fellow mutants! ü§òüî•\n\nWe've all complained about it at one time or another: another Hollywood remake, another sequel, another predictable and formulaic story, or worse, plotholes you can drive a semi through! \"No one in that position would ever...\" What? Run in heels? Split up in a scary situation? Ask \"what do we do now?\" or make an asinine decision based solely on being \"pure of heart.\" We've all been there too many times to count. So, what's the solution? Start making your OWN movies! Tell YOUR stories! It's easier than you think: https://lnkd.in/gEWEB5pq\n\nGreetings! DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE continued to sizzle in theatres, bringing in an additional $97M in its second weekend. The Marvel superhero sequel has grossed $395M in its first 10 days, making it the second highest earning movie of 2024 behind Pixar‚Äôs INSIDE OUT 2 which has earned $627M since its June 14th opening. In fact, the R-rated DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE has earned more than the PG-rated INSIDE OUT 2 had at the same point in its release. The two films have anchored the summer box office, beginning on 6/11 with INSIDE OUT 2 and continuing through 7/26 with DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE. Sprinkle in a little DESPICABLE ME 4 on 7/3 and TWISTERS on 7/19 and the summer of 2024 has turned into quite a tasty dish for exhibitors. Get all the details with Dick Walsh‚Äôs Weekend Review. You will also enjoy reading our critic‚Äôs review of TRAP, the new psychological thriller by director M. Night Shyamalan and the biggest new opener of the weekend. Our Don‚Äôt Kill the Messenger podcast this week features a discussion with Ben Mankiewicz, the host of Turner Classic Movies, who joins host Kevin Goetz to discuss his favorite movie classics and the experience of growing up in a legendary Hollywood family. #deadpoolandwolverine #deadpool&wolverine #marvelstudios #disney #trapmovie #mnightshyamalan #insideout2 #twistersmovie #despicableme4 #benmankiewicz #turnermovieclassics #dontkillthemessenger #kevingoetz #boxoffice #boxofficeresults #screendollars\n\nGreetings!

Jackie Chan, the exception to the rule, still performs his own stunts despite nearing 65 years of age. It‚Äôs no secret that the physical body becomes more fragile as one ages; even everyday activities can feel like high-risk maneuvers. As Clint Eastwood‚Äôs body double aptly says, ‚ÄúThe older you get, the harder the ground gets.‚Äù https://lnkd.in/gddscacv #financialinsights #incrediblearticle #colleague #breakitdown #complexconcepts #easilydigestible #nuggetsofwisdom #indepthanalysis #practicalexamples #essentialresource #financialliteracy #retirementplanning #teeingupforthefuture\n\nWith the Rocky statue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where the movie was shot! I asked him the secret of success and endurance! And he told me! Soon in video!! And the story of Rocky as a fictional figure and of Stallone in real life is an example and inspiration to adopt perseverance and endurance under any circumstances and to never give up and fight \"one more round\"! There is also a very good documentary on Netflix about Stallone's life called \"Sly\"! Keep fighting!!! #onemoreround#neverquit#sly#AdaptAndFly#\n\nRyan Reynolds' Deadpool returns with a bang, calling himself \"Marvel Jesus\" in his latest outing, sparking debate on whether the film can revitalize the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after its recent slump. With the iconic Wolverine back in action, played once again by Hugh Jackman, this is a game-changer for the MCU. As Marvel faces a downturn, plagued by audience fatigue and a muddled narrative, Deadpool and Wolverine's dynamic duo may offer the much-needed boost. Despite mixed reviews, many critics are hailing the film as a potential shot in the arm for Marvel. Will Deadpool and Wolverine restore Marvel's former glory, or is the MCU's decline too deep to fix with a single film? One thing‚Äôs for sure: this movie is a wild ride filled with self-deprecating humor and fan service galore. What do you think? Can this pair of anti-heroes save the MCU?
