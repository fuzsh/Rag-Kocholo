Surprisingly, this film was released the following year of Live and Let Die, thereby breaking the then recent tradition of waiting two years in between pictures. Two years apart would`ve helped. Perhaps three. Maybe four.\n\n`Golden Gun` is a mess. There are two plots that run parallel and eventually intersect but neither one with decidedly outstanding results. The film starts off with Bond receiving a golden bullet with his name on it. Only one man in the world uses a golden bullet: Francisco “Pistols” Scaramanga. The world`s foremost assassin for hire, he only carries one bullet with him on any assignment. He only needs one.\n\nThen there is the Solex Agitator. It`s a device able to harness the rays of the Sun and convert it into a powerful energy source. Cheap, abundant energy in the midst of the early 70`s fuel crisis would be like a godsend. In the right hands, the world`s economy could be straightened out. In the wrong hands, the Agitator could ruin many lives.\n\nBond was originally assigned to retrieve the Solex Agitator and make sure that it`s use was purely humanitarian. That is, until he became a marked man. So it`s very convenient plotwise to have the Agitator later come into play because the film is so poorly written that a story about Bond being marked for assassination could not hold the film on it`s own.\n\nAs Scaramanga, Christopher Lee is just okay. He`s not particularly memorable. In fact, as it turns out, he`s not even the one who sent the golden bullet to Bond. It was his exasperated mistress, Andrea. So, in essence, Scaramanga doesn`t even pose a threat to 007. He actually admires Bond.\n\nMary Goodnight, Bond`s ally is South Asia, exemplifies all the stereotypes and prejudices about Bond girl roles: blonde, buxom, and utterly clueless, she`s a complete waste of time in the film and contributed absolutely nothing to the plot.\n\nIt tells you something about the quality of a film when Clifton James is the highlight. As the bigoted, culturally challenged Sheriff J.W. Pepper, he has now ventured from the swamps of Louisiana (Live and Let Die) and moved on to the canals of Bangkok. He shouts “BOY!” where ever he goes, and for some inexplicable reason, feels the need to get a test drive of an AMC Hornet in a foreign country. Herve Villechaize plays the diminutive manservant Nick Nack. Oddly, he`s not too bad as Scaramanga`s happy-go-lucky carnival house operator/henchman.\n\nJohn Barry`s score is great, however the same can`t be said for the main song. The titles are routine and uninspired. The action is few and far between and what there is of it is uninspired and uninvolving. After this film, the series needed a major overhaul in order to survive."
