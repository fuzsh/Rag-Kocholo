The cufflinks are available for pre-order (shipping early June) at the 007Store for £140 each.\n\nJames Bond Gold-Plated Golden Gun Cufflinks\n\nMini replicas of one of the cinematic world's most iconic weapons, Scaramanga's Golden Gun.\n\nSeen in The Man With The Golden Gun (1974), this instantly recognisable handgun has been reimagined in exact detail as stylish three-dimensional cufflinks.\n\nThe cufflinks are individually made by hand in England and plated in 24ct gold.\n\nAvailable at the 007 Store (£140)\n\nThis is the not the first time the Golden Gun was made into cufflinks. In 2012, the golden gun was made into gold with crystal cufflinks, and also a necklace and keyring by Swarovksi.\n\nIn 2015, Bond Lifestyle created a pair of gold plated limited edition (PPK) gun cufflinks to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the website.\n\nJames Bond Gold-Plated Bullion Bar Cufflinks\n\nMini replicas of the precious bars of Fort Knox bullion from Goldfinger (1964). The Bond Archive prop bars have been reimagined in detail as stylish three-dimensional cufflinks, individually made by hand in England and plated in 24ct gold.\n\nThe cufflinks feature Fort Knox references and codes. The design secures the cuff with a neat ball back.\n\nAvailable at the 007Store (£140)\n\nJames Bond Gold Bullet Cufflinks\n\nMini replicas of the 007 bullet from The Man With The Golden Gun (1974). This iconic piece has been reimagined in exact detail as stylish three-dimensional cufflinks, individually made by hand in England.\n\nThe cufflinks have been cast directly from the genuine bullet prop in the Bond Archive to give a high quality replica piece of film history. The design has been cast in brass, hand polished and hard gold plated with 1/4 micron of 24ct gold.\n\nAuthentically detailed, the cufflinks secure the cuff with a neat ball back.\n\nAvailable at the 007Store (£140)\n\nAnother pair of bullet 007 cufflinks was created by S.T. Dupont as part of their 2004 James Bond Collection. These are now highly sought-after and can fetch high prices on eBay."
