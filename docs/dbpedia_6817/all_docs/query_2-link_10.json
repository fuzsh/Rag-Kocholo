        "text": "Colthorpe is an MI6 ballistics expert who appears in the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun. He was portrayed by James Cossins.\n\nBiography[]\n\nColthorpe is present during James Bond's briefing with M, along with Bill Tanner, where they discuss the golden bullet supposedly sent from assassin Francisco Scaramanga.\n\nColthorpe later assists Q as they attempt to analyse the remains of the bullet that killed 002. The ballistics expert identifying the bullet as fired from a 4.2 millimetre gun which he tells 007 is unofficially made by a Portuguese man named Lazar living in Macau. A formal, refined gentleman, little else is learnt about his character.\n\nBehind the Scenes[]\n\nThe first draft of the script originally called the role Boothroyd until it was realised that was also Q's official name and it was subsequently changed.[1] Colthorpe's character in many ways reflects the literary character of Major Boothroyd more accurately than Q, a no nonsense weapon specialist opposed to a comical technical genius.\n\nGallery[]"
