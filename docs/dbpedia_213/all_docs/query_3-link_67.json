Serving as a salute to their past and a celebration of the present and future, the new album, which is their first original release in 15 years, includes 10 new tracks, with a very special feature from GRAMMY-winning country superstar Lainey Wilson on “Wilted Rose.”\n\nLISTEN TO HAPPINESS BASTARDS HERE\n\nProduced by GRAMMY Award-Winning producer Jay Joyce, the project emphasizes The Black Crowes’ influence as one of the most vital rock bands of this generation. Following decades marked by sex, drugs, fights, breakups, and divorce, Happiness Bastards finds the brothers leaving their bullshit behind and leaning into their creative common ground to deliver their most compelling work to date.\n\n“These guys came to town like a freight train. Ready to lay it down, no bullshit. Old school real, live and raw. They brought the OG magic of their early albums along with some young punk spirit. I was honored to have captured it,” noted producer Jay Joyce.\n\nFirst singles “Wanting and Waiting” and “Cross Your Fingers” previewed the band’s “love letter to rock ‘n’ roll” – a dynamic body of work that is both fresh, yet quintessential rock n’ roll; the perfect balance of soulful and gritty. Opening track “Bedside Manners” starts the album off with the immediate energy one can expect of a band reintroducing themselves – complete with an urgent, complex guitar riff and exhilarating keyboard, Chris Robinson sings of the unforgiving music industry’s ruthless game. “Rats And Clowns” explodes the Crowes into the world of AC/DC with aggressive distortion for an attitude-riddled anthem about taking the rock n’ roll lifestyle by the horns. Slowing it down with “Wilted Rose,” the band dips their toes into sweet country melancholy. Bringing Lainey Wilson along for the ride, hauntingly beautiful harmonies and nostalgia-seeped acoustic guitar takes listeners through the journey of a man who has not only lost love, but has lost his way.\n\n“It’s an honor to wail on this record with these legendary, pioneering rockstars,” said Lainey Wilson. “Welcome back boys! You’ve been missed.”\n\nWith a fiery guitar lick and funk-infused bridge in response to Wilted Rose, “Dirty Cold Sun” bites back against a toxic relationship with the confidence of someone thriving even when faced with the frost of a former flame. “Bleed It Dry” unleashes the unapologetic spirit of the blues with thrilling harmonica and dazzling keys in a finger-pointing spit back at those who have done you wrong. Transporting listeners back to the realm of 80s punk rock, “Flesh Wound” is a punchy, full-throttle rebound from a breakup, shaking off the shards of heartbreak with an adrenaline-fueled chorus perfect for the live stage. Gritty with the seductive blend of crunchy riffs and a slide guitar, “Follow The Moon” tells the story of one’s often detrimental love affair with the indulgences of the rock ‘n’ roll lifestyle. Closing out the record on a wistful yet hopeful note, “Kindred Friend” serves as an olive branch rekindling a broken relationship. A piano-tinged ballad about making the most of the present and moving on from the past, it seeks closure in shared memories. As much as it is a retrospective on the Robinson Brothers’ complicated history, it is also a love letter to the fans who have supported them along the years."
