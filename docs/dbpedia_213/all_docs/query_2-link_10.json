        "text": "“Alright!” shouted a clearly excited Chris Robinson last week as the Black Crowes performed on stage in Chicago. “Friday night at the rock and roll show!”\n\nFollowing last month’s release of their latest studio album Happiness Bastards, their ninth, the Crowes performed Friday night in Chicago at Aragon Ballroom about halfway through the U.S. leg of their current tour, a lengthy jaunt set to take them abroad next month ahead of fall and winter dates in support of Aerosmith’s rescheduled “Peace Out” North American farewell tour.\n\n“When we saw we were coming back to the Aragon, we were very excited,” said Robinson late, noting the group’s first performance in the picturesque room in almost 25 years. “And we’re very excited to have Glyders opening for us. They’re from this town, check them out,” he continued, lauding the work of the Chicago-based, psychedelic garage rock trio (as a cardboard cutout of Chuck Berry looked on from the venue’s balcony).\n\nOver the course of 35 minutes, Glyders offered up a rewarding, lo-fi opening set.\n\n“Cheers, everyone!” said bassist Eliza Weber early. Singer/guitarist Joshua Condon and drummer Joe Seger would soon find a groove during standout tracks like “Geneva Strangemod” and “High Time,” both from their 2023 full-length debut Maria’s Hunt.\n\nSince we were first introduced in 1990, the Crowes have tallied a pair of platinum albums and three gold records, with Happiness Bastards, the group’s first studio album of original material in nearly 15 years, a worthy addition to their unique brand of southern-fried rock and roll.\n\n“There’s a little town about 90 miles south of Atlanta called Macon, Georgia,” Robinson explained Friday night in Chicago, spotlighting the group’s roots. “Little Richard is from Macon. And the Allman Brothers Band,” he began, just one day removed from the death of co-founding Allman Brothers guitarist Dickey Betts. “But there’s another: the greatest soul singer of all time, Otis Redding,” he continued. “Well, we jumped on that song and it goes like this,” said Robinson, setting up a late take on one of the biggest Black Crowes hits in Redding’s “Hard to Handle.”\n\nForbesChris And Rich Robinson On New Black Crowes EP '1972,' Looking Back On 'Shake Your Money Maker'\n\nWhile recent tours celebrated their Shake Your Money Maker record, this one makes the case for the new project, with the Black Crowes performing six songs from it over the course of about 95 minutes on stage Friday in Chicago.\n\nAs they do on the album too, “Bedside Manners” and “Rats and Clowns,” two of Happiness Bastards’ more rollicking moments, kicked things off Friday night.\n\nPerforming as an 8 piece group, drummer Cully Symington and keyboard player Erik Deutsch were set beside backing vocalists Mackenzie Adams and Lesley Grant atop a unique two-tiered stage built to resemble stacks upon stacks of vintage amplifiers and audio equipment.\n\nFrontman Chris Robinson, who performed in front of a large mirror, was joined on stage by guitarists Rich Robinson and Nico Bereciartua as well as longtime bassist Sven Pipien. Festive lighting strung over, along and behind the stage flanked the group who performed under a massive “Happiness Bastards” banner hanging from the lighting rig over the stage.\n\n“Good to see you all. Welcome to the ‘Happiness Bastards!’” said Chris early in Friday’s set. “We’ve got some new songs and we got some old ones - like this!” he said, shuffling left before pointing right at Rich on the slide guitar, ultimately bunnyhopping in reverse back to center stage as “Twice As Hard” rang out early in Chicago.\n\nRobinson was in fine form Friday, a rejuvenated frontman shimmying about while delivering a still impressive lead vocal, with the new music cementing a once unthinkable rebirth for the Black Crowes, who’ve continually staked their claim as one of America’s best rock acts since reforming in 2019.\n\nFrom 1996’s Three Snakes and One Charm, “Nebakanezer” was an early highlight in Chicago. The gnarly dual guitar riffwork of “Horsehead,” from 1999’s By Your Side followed, providing one of Friday’s more rewarding one-two punches.\n\nWhile “Oh Josephine” slowed things down momentarily, “Thorn in my Pride” found the group beginning to roll, with Chris on harmonica as the Crowes delivered an all hands, Stones-like jam to close the cut.\n\n“Everyone say hello to Rich Robinson,” said Chris, gesturing toward his younger brother. With a wave of his right hand, Rich greeted the rapturuous Chicago crowd, soon strumming in the familiar opening licks to “She talks to Angels” on acoustic guitar.\n\nFrom the new record, “Flesh Wound” followed, quickly proving to be a late high spot. The saccharine-drenched affair was a blast in the live setting, conjuring up the power pop stylings of Cheap Trick as the Black Crowes soared forward in fun fashion.\n\nThe brothers Robinson leaned in close, singing into the same mic during “Jealous Again” before closing with “Remedy,” with Chris back on harp as the new “Kindred Friend” wrapped things up in the Windy City.\n\n“What is a band, other than something you dream up?” asked Chris rhetorically on stage in Chicago. “This band started in our mom and dad’s house in the 80s,” he continued, noting the pair’s humble roots. “And that dream will continue on.”"
