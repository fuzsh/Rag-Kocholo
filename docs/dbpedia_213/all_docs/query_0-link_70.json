        "text": "Combining groovy rock improvisational riffs over the traditional 12-bar blues, blues rock bands are some of the most important bands in music history. The best blues rock bands are oftentimes - and rightfully so - considered some of the greatest rock bands of all time. Blues rock became popular in the UK and U.S. in the 1960s at the onset of the rock explosion, and these bands took elements from traditional blues music and amplified them through the use of electric guitars, powerful bass lines and heavy drum beats. Over time (even during the 90s), blues rock evolved to include modern electronic riffs that incorporated elements of hard rock as well. That said, blues rock bands are some of the most beloved and the best blues bands, and they have a legacy that goes far beyond their best songs and albums.\n\nSo, what are the best blues rock bands ever? When people think of good blues rock, names of famous bands like Led Zeppelin, Cream, the Allman Brothers Band, as well as solo blues artists like the English powerhouse Eric Clapton, and American greats Stevie Ray Vaughn and B.B. King, often come up. These legendary groups are widely known as some of the best blues rock artists of all time. Primarily known for being guitar rock driven, the best blues rock bands have awesome guitar solos that are often times more memorable than their songs' lyrics, which is a testament to their brilliant musicianship across their tracks. Even as modern blues rock bands hit the scene, these bands have secured their place in history, many with the strength of their guitarists alone.\n\nThat said, it's up to you to determine who the top blues rock bands are. This list answers the questions \"who are the best blues-rock bands of all time?\" and \"who is the greatest blues-rock musician ever?\" If you know enough about the genre, please vote based on the quality of the band's music instead of just voting for the most popular blues-rock bands that you might've heard of."
