        "text": "File/Neil Zlozower\n\nWhy does time immortalize some bands who were once a big deal and significantly diminish others?\n\nFor example, the first three Black Crowes albums are every bit as good as the first three albums by any other big rock act from the early-90s. But while groups like Nirvana and Pearl Jam are now legends, the Crowes have become a footnote in mainstream culture at best. And at worst, forgotten.\n\nIs this because the Black Crowes' singer – wiry, hip-shaking Chris Robinson - didn't die at age 27? Is it because the Crowes developed an antagonistic relationship with the two trend-setting music media organizations back then, MTV and Rolling Stone, instead of becoming their darlings? Is it because \"Southern Harmony\" isn't as sonically hardwired to the '90s as \"Nevermind\" or \"Ten\"? Is it because Robinson dislikes his brother/Crowes guitarist Rich Robinson and drummer Steve Gorman so much the musicians couldn't come to terms for a 25th anniversary tour that would've likely reminded fans and press why this band is special?\n\nThe above reasons all likely have something to do with the Black Crowes’ current status: the most underrated major band of the ’90s.\n\nThe Crowes’ soulful swaggering rock, as heard on hits like “Jealous Again,” “She Talks to Angles” and “Remedy,” could have made this Atlanta-founded act their generation’s Aerosmith or Rolling Stones. Instead they became one the biggest cult bands of the last 25 years, their music getting weirder and slower, although there were some late-period sparks. And now, The Black Crowes are disappearing into the mist.\n\nI recently spent a few days going back through the Crowes’ extensive catalog and ranking their hits, deep-cuts and officially released obscurities. As a fan since age 18 and having seen more than 30 concerts by the band from 1990 to 2013, I was very familiar with their work. But after the group officially broke up in early-2015 (there’d been previous hiatuses but this one felt final), I hadn’t listened to their music much. After 25 years as a Crowes superfan, I was ready to explore and obsess-over some other bands.\n\nHowever, after revisiting the Crowes’ catalog – particularly confident debut LP “Shake Your Money Maker,” sophomore thunderbolt “Southern Harmony and the Musical Companion” and the druggy/sexy “Amorica” – I rediscovered this isn’t just a band worth remembering. The Black Crowes are a band worth revering.\n\nBy Matt Wake\n\n126. 'Come On'\n\nAlbum: \"Lions\" Released: 2001\n\nHigh-wattage empty calories.\n\n125. 'No Use Lying'\n\nAlbum: \"Lions\" Released: 2001\n\nDayGlo sex-rock that turns bitter on the chorus.\n\n124. 'Ozone Mama'\n\nAlbum: \"Lions\" Released: 2001\n\nThe lean rhythm track and harmonica solo are effective; the rapping on the verses, less so.\n\n123. 'Better When You're Not Alone'\n\nAlbum: \"Three Snakes and One Charm\" Released: 1996\n\nA jangly, scruffy Valentine.\n\n122. 'Losing My Mind'\n\nAlbum: \"Lions\" Released: 2001\n\nOne of the few Crowes songs featuring a string arrangement; it would've been cool to hear the band explore orchestral sounds more often.\n\n121. 'Miracle to Me'\n\nAlbum: \"Lions\" Released: 2001\n\nA well-penned love song, but producer Don Was and the band should have pushed for a better take.\n\n120. 'Make Glad'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nA kinetic Persian rug jam that wouldn't sound out of place on a vintage Traffic album.\n\n119. 'Heavy'\n\nAlbum: \"By Your Side\" Released: 1999\n\nHey the lyrics may not be Bob Dylan level, but the vocals, drums and guitars are razor sharp on this flirty rocker.\n\n118. 'Shady Grove'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nIn an era when other artists were making a big deal about releasing music through phones or video games, the Crowes recorded this studio LP live in front of an audience, putting a focus on flesh-and-blood musicianship.\n\n117. 'Smile'\n\nFrom the \"Wiser for the Time\" live box set Released: 2013\n\nLate-90s acoustic outtake anchored by starry electric piano on this official live release.\n\n116. 'What Is Home'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nPlaintive CSN&Y-worthy folk-rock with a rare lead vocal from Crowes guitar-god Rich Robinson.\n\n115. 'Then She Said My Name'\n\nAlbum: \"By Your Side\" Released: 1999\n\nWhen Columbia Records signed The Black Crowes in the late-90s, it was pretty obvious the label was trying to turn the band into the new \"comeback-era Aerosmith,\" even pairing them with Aerosmith producer Kevin Shirley and A&R guru John Kalodner, for the Crowes' \"By Your Side\" LP.\n\n114. 'Houston Don't Dream About Me'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nWindshield wipers keep time on this deceptively clever country-rocker.\n\n113. 'Kept My Soul'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nGritty, groaning blues.\n\n112. 'Lady of Ave. A'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nMournful ballad that name-checks a New York street a la many a Ryan Adams tune.\n\n112. 'Greenhorn'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nAstral folk-music with a shimmering cocktail-jazz guitar break.\n\n111. 'Go Faster'\n\nAlbum: \"By Your Side\" Released: 1999\n\nThis rocker is too busy on the intro and verses, but Chris Robinson's exciting chorus vocals carry a melodic charge.\n\n110. 'Shine Along'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nA yearning, solar-activated road song.\n\n109. 'Evergreen'\n\nAlbum: \"Warpaint\" Released: 2008\n\nDeep-sea electric-guitars and tie-dyed come-ons.\n\n108. 'How Much for Your Wings?'\n\nAlbum: \"Three Snakes and One Charm\" Released: 1996\n\nAlthough they never really sold-out, the Crowes seem to ponder the price of doing just that on this dreamy acoustic track.\n\n107. 'And the Band Played On...'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nCall-and-respond vocals between frontman Chris Robinson and the band on this gear-shifting composition.\n\n106. 'She'\n\nAlbum: \"Croweology\" Released: 2010\n\nA loving acoustic version of country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons's \"She,\" which the Crowes had covered live since their \"Amorica\" period.\n\n105. 'Bring On, Bring On'\n\nAlbum: \"Three Snakes and One Charm\" Released: 1996\n\nA tripped-out yet focused acoustic strummer.\n\n104. 'Never Forget This Song'\n\nAlbum: \"The Lost Crowes\" Released: 2006\n\nThe Crowes' 2.0 lineup (Chris, Rich, Gorman, bassist Johnny Colt, guitarist Marc Ford and keyboardist Eddie Harsch) was so musically talented they could make even a partially cooked song sound badass.\n\n103. 'Fork in the River'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nHarmony-rich American roots-music for the iPhone era.\n\n102. 'Don't Wake Me'\n\nFrom the \"Sho' Nuff\" box set Released: 1998\n\nThunderous, alt-rock leaning \"Shake Your Money Maker\" outtake in which someone in the studio can be heard saying \"Get Chris in here!\" as the band starts playing.\n\n101. 'Just Say You're Sorry'\n\nFrom the \"Sho' Nuff\" box set Released: 1998\n\nBig guitars, big drums, big vocals on this catchy \"Three Snakes and One Charm\" outtake.\n\n103. 'I Ain't Hiding'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nThe Black Crowes' disco-period lasted for exactly one song.\n\n99. 'Pimper's Paradise'\n\nFrom the B-side of the \"One Mirror Too Many\" vinyl single Released: 1996\n\nTaut, faithful version of Bob Marley's party-girl cautionary tale.\n\n98. 'God's Got It'\n\nAlbum: \"Warpaint\" Released: 2008\n\nConcert versions of the Crowes' raucous Rev. Charlie Jackson cover featured skins-man Steve Gorman wearing and pounding a marching-band bass drum.\n\n97. '(Only) Halfway to Everywhere'\n\nAlbum: \"Three Snakes and One Charm\" Released: 1996\n\nHard, tribal funk.\n\n96. 'Mellow Down Easy'\n\nFrom the \"Sho' Nuff\" box set Released: 1998\n\nElectric-mud cover of a signature Little Walter blues.\n\n95. 'Go Tell the Congregation'\n\nAlbum: \"By Your Side\" Released: 1999\n\nIf you've ever wondered what AC/DC jamming with Sly and the Family Stone would sound like ...\n\n94. 'The Last Place That Love Lives'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nA stark original folk-song that puts tears in beers by the end.\n\n93. 'Lickin''\n\nAlbum: \"Lions\" Released: 2001\n\nRich Robinson manipulates his guitar's toggle switch to get robotic noises on this libidinous single.\n\n92. 'P.25 London'\n\nAlbum: \"Amorica\" Released: 1994\n\nThis deep cut brings to mind Alice Cooper singing for Little Feat.\n\n92. 'Garden Gate'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nAlmost 20 years into their career, The Black Crowes' roots ran way deeper than classic-rock, as this effortlessly natural bluegrass composition proves.\n\n91. 'Exit'\n\nFrom the \"Wiser for the Time\" live box set Released: 2013\n\nThis thrashy kiss-off was a rarely-heard (but electrifying) in-concert nugget.\n\n90. 'Dirty Hair Halo'\n\nAlbum: \"The Lost Crowes\" Released: 2006\n\nOne of countless examples of The Black Crowes' honey-hole between hard-rock and psychedelia.\n\n89. 'Lay It All on Me'\n\nAlbum: \"Lions\" Released: 2001\n\nThe shades of \"Big Pink\" here eventually blur into a windswept guitar coda.\n\n88. 'Diamond Ring'\n\nAlbum: \"By Your Side\" Released: 1999\n\nA sweet All Green-style ballad with juicy organ.\n\n87. 'Struttin' Blues'\n\nAlbum: \"Shake Your Money Maker\" Released: 1990\n\nThe vocals are mixed too low to understand what the hell Chris Robinson is screaming, but the guitars-and-drum strut is hard to resist.\n\n86. 'Aimless Peacock'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nRich Robinson breaks out the sitar on this winding mostly-instrumental number.\n\n85. 'Cold Boy Smile'\n\nAlbum: \"Croweology\" Released: 2010\n\nWoodsy progressive-rock.\n\n84. 'Greasy Grass River'\n\nAlbum: \"Lions\" Released: 2001\n\nWah-wah guitar waves and head-shop escapist vocals made this a late-period concert showstopper.\n\n83. 'Evil Eye'\n\nAlbum: \"Three Snakes and One Charm\" Released: 1996\n\nA slow-motion climb up a misty mountain.\n\n82. 'So Many Times'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nBeautiful brotherly harmonies.\n\n81. 'Tied Up and Swallowed'\n\nAlbum: \"The Lost Crowes\" Released: 2006\n\nNasty grooves, riffs and vocals, all with bad intentions.\n\n80. 'Cosmic Friend'\n\nAlbum: \"Lions\" Released: 2001\n\nCosmos-kissing hard-rock that opens like a theatre production.\n\n79. 'Roll Old Jeremiah'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nLadies and gentleman, say hello to the Blue(grass) Crowes.\n\n78. 'Time Will Tell'\n\nAlbum: \"The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion\" Released: 1992\n\nThis acoustic Bob Marley cover is endearingly tight-but-loose.\n\n77.

'Let Me Share the Ride'\n\nAlbum: \"Three Snakes and One Charm\" Released: 1996\n\nA New Orleans flavored hoedown; ingredients include second-line drums, sweaty horns, slide guitar and harmonica.\n\n75. 'Waiting Guilty'\n\nFrom the \"Wiser for the Time\" live box set Released: 2013\n\nMonsoon guitars and homesick vocals on this live rarity.\n\n74. 'Virtue and Vice'\n\nAlbum: \"By Your Side\" Released: 1999\n\nMammoth sounding, transportive - as \"Kashmir\" as two brothers from Marietta, Ga. can get.\n\n73. 'Chevrolet'\n\nFrom the B side of the \"Wiser Time\" vinyl single Released: 1994\n\nHot cover of a Taj Mahal via Lonnie Young & Ed Young blues.\n\n72. 'Young Man, Old Man'\n\nAlbum: \"Lions\" Released: 2001\n\nPercussive, 3D funk.\n\n71.

'Grinnin''\n\nAlbum: \"The Lost Crowes\" Released: 2006\n\nA soulful sparse look into the rearview mirror.\n\n68. 'Could I've Been So Blind'\n\nAlbum: \"Shake Your Money Maker\" Released: 1990\n\nA garage-y song reportedly dating back the band's Mr. Crowes' Garden era, with Chris Robinson singing his skinny ass off.\n\n67. 'My Heart's Killing Me'\n\nAlbum: \"The Lost Crowes\" Released: 2006\n\nHeart-tugging Americana.\n\n66. 'Wounded Bird'\n\nAlbum: \"Warpaint\" Released: 2008\n\nFor the \"Warpaint\" album, the Crowes found a sweet-spot between Chris Robinson's propensity for barefoot lyrics and Rich's talent for skyscraper guitars.\n\n65. 'Predictable'\n\nAlbum: \"The Lost Crowes\" Released: 2006\n\nThe angular verses harken back to the band's beginnings as gangly R.E.M. worshipers.\n\n64. 'Walk Believer Walk'\n\nAlbum: \"Warpaint\" Released: 2008\n\nThis slide-guitar howler sounds like it dates back to the beginning of time, but it actually came out the same year as a bunch of Coldplay, Lil Wayne and Kanye West LPs.\n\n63. '99 Lbs'\n\nFrom the \"Sho' Nuff\" box set Released: 1998\n\nAbsolutely smoking \"Southern Harmony\" era cover of a song by one of the band's key early inspirations: British boogie-rockers Humble Pie.\n\n62.

'Been a Long Time (Waiting on Love)'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nIncense-scented guitar hypnosis.\n\n60. 'Grows a Rose'\n\nFrom: \"By Your Side\" CD single Released: 1998\n\nElectrical-storm grooves and skyscraping chorus make for a B-side superior to many tracks that made the full-length \"By Your Side\" album.\n\n59. 'Blackberry'\n\nAlbum: \"Three Snakes and One Charm\" Released: 1996\n\nThe Black Crowes finally wrote their own \"Hard to Handle\" with this hip-shaker.\n\n58. 'Under a Mountain'\n\nAlbum: \"Three Snakes and One Charm\" Released: 1996\n\nContains the fantastic, unwashed and slightly dazed chorus: \"So I'm under a mountain/Stuck to this mattress/Perfume and Valium\"\n\n57. 'Title Song'\n\nAlbum: \"Live\" Released: 2002\n\nUnreleased in studio form, this blues-metal song is the kind of rarity that thrilled fans who followed the band to multiple shows on a tour, when it was played live.\n\n56. 'A Conspiracy'\n\nAlbum: \"Amorica\" Released: 1994\n\nAn electric-magic rebuttal to the band's critics.\n\n55.

'Welcome to the Goodtimes'\n\nAlbum: \"By Your Side\" Released: 1999\n\nOn the otherwise glam \"By Your Side\" LP, the Crowes brought things back to a rootsier sound on this wintry number.\n\n51. 'Kickin' My Heart Around'\n\nAlbum: \"By Your Side\" Released: 1999\n\nThis 100 mph Dixie-rocker about a good thing gone bad will singe your eyebrows off.\n\n50.

'Tornado'\n\nAlbum: \"The Lost Crowes\" Released: 2006\n\nFrom the shelved 1994 \"Tall\" album sessions, a hayseed lark in which Chris Robinson invites the listener to \"help yourself out to some of my disaster.\"\n\n46. 'A Train Still Makes a Lonely Sound'\n\nAlbum: \"Before the Frost...Until the Freeze\" Released: 2009\n\nA road-weary and heart-dented return to Faces/Rod Stewart pub-rock.\n\n45. 'HorseHead'\n\nAlbum: \"By Your Side\" Released: 1999\n\nFire-breathing riff-rock that sounds like a job application for the tour and live album the Crowes did with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page a year later.\n\n44. 'Sting Me'\n\nAlbum: \"The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion\" Released: 1992\n\nThis Sly Stone influenced jolt opens the best Crowes' best studio album and was often electrifying in concert.\n\n43.

'Cursed Diamond'\n\nAlbum: \"Amorica\" Released: 1994\n\nA whisper to a scream southern-rock doozy about the dark side of talent.\n\n35.

'Paint an 8'\n\nAlbum: \"The Lost Crowes\" Released: 2006\n\nSerpentine guitar from Rich Robinson and dizzy-head tales from Chris on this 1997 track that didn't surface on record until almost 10 years later. (A YouTube clip of the studio version of \"Paint an 8\" was unavailable so we used this 2005 live video of the song.)\n\n33.

'She Talks to Angels'\n\nAlbum: \"Shake Your Money Maker\" Released: 1990\n\n“She Talks to Angels” didn’t need a power-ballad finale to win us over; just gorgeous open-tuning guitar and powerhouse pipes singing about a mysterious girl who gets dark kicks.\n\n4.
