        "text": "I figured with the release of WARPAINT, it might be nice to do a Black Crowes album by album thread. Hopefully this thread will inspire some to look beyond their first 2 multi-platnium releases and check out some of their more \"obscure\" albums.\n\nThe Black Crowes came along at a unique time in mainstream music. Sugary Pop, Hair Metal, Boy Bands, and a few Rap acts pretty much ruled the charts at the beginning 1990. U2 & R.E.M. were both on long hiatuses, and the explosion that was NEVERMIND was still a good year & 1/2 away. Guns N' Roses were working on their long awaited second album. It turned out people were really hungering for a traditional \"classic\" rock band. The Crowes really filled that gap. Yes, you could say they were initially derivitive, aping the Stones/Faces model, but lead singer Chris Robinson had a powerful Rock N' Roll voice & swagger that Rod Stewart had abandonded many years before, and he & guitarist brother Rich wound up crafting many fine original songs. Chris turned out to be one of the strongest lyricists of his generation IMO, and Rich came up with several supurb riffs based mostly on open tunings made famous by the likes of Keith Richards & Stephen Stills in the Rock N' Roll era. Steve Gorman is a top notch drummer, and when they were arguably at their peak, they had a soulful lead guitarist in Marc Ford, and an expert keyboardist in Ed Harsch. There were a few lineup changes in the late 90's through 2001. Old friend Sven Pipien was brought in on bass, and Audley Freed did a fine job on lead guitar having the daunting task of replacing Marc Ford. The band went on a relatively short \"hiatus\" 2002, but eventually reuinited in 2005 with what turned into what could have been their strongest lineup had they stayed together: The Robinson Brothers, Gorman, Ford, Pipien & Harsch. This lineup didn't last long but their tour was very successful. Ford & long time keybordist Harsch have split. Expert slide guitarist Luther Dickinson & keybordist Adam MacDougall were recruited to help record WARPAINT and now are full time members. That's my analysis of the comings & goings of the band's members. For a more indepth history, click here....http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Crowes\n\nAnyway...on to the albums. I will use WIKIPEDIA.ORG as a guide & post their synopsis of each record, and then we can all write what we think. Enjoy!\n\nSHAKE YOUR MONEY MAKER\n\nStudio album by The Black Crowes\n\nReleased January 1990\n\nRecorded 1989\n\nGenre Blues-rock, hard rock\n\nLength 43:42\n\nLabel Def American\n\nProducer George Drakoulias\n\nShake Your Money Maker is the debut album by the American Southern rock band The Black Crowes, released in January of 1990. It is also a classic blues song written by Elmore James that the Crowes have played live many times over the years.\n\nShake Your Money Maker peaked at #4 on Billboard's Top 200 album chart.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Chris Robinson and Rich Robinson, except where noted.\n\n\"Twice as Hard\" – 4:09\n\n\"Jealous Again\" – 4:35\n\n\"Sister Luck\" – 5:13\n\n\"Could I've Been So Blind\" – 3:44\n\n\"Seeing Things\" – 5:18\n\n\"Hard to Handle\" (Allen Jones, Alvertis Isbell, Otis Redding) – 3:08\n\n\"Thick N' Thin\" – 2:44\n\n\"She Talks to Angels\" – 5:29\n\n\"Struttin' Blues\" – 4:09\n\n\"Stare It Cold\" – 5:13\n\nPersonnel\n\nChris Robinson – vocals\n\nRich Robinson – guitar\n\nJeff Cease – guitar\n\nJohnny Colt – bass guitar\n\nSteve Gorman – drums\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nChuck Leavell – keyboards\n\nProduction\n\nGeorge Drakoulias – producer\n\nDavid Bianco – remixing\n\nBrendan O'Brien - engineer\n\nLee Manning – assistant engineer, mixing, mixing engineer\n\nRick Rubin – executive producer (credited on the sleeve only after the album became successful)\n\nKevin Shirley – mixing\n\nMichael Lavine – photography\n\nRuth Leitman – photography, cover photo\n\nGreg Fulginiti and Leon Zervos – mastering\n\nPete Angelus – personal manager\n\nAlan Forbes – artwork, art direction, design\n\nTag George – assistant engineer\n\nFROM WIKIPEDIA.ORG\n\nCompared to some of the other records released at that time, it still sounds pretty good IMO. It is a little slick for the Crowes though. The songwriting is still developing, but yes, there are some great tunes. My favorites are mostly the rockers like \"Twice As Hard\", \"Jealous Again\", \"Could I've Been So Blind\", \"Thick N' Thin\" & \"Stare It Cold\". Chris's voice is very impressive on the ballads too, but those songs are lacking a bit IMO. Overall it probably ranks among my least favorite Crowes albums, but I'd say at least half the album is very strong. Not bad for a debut. Remember, they were also very young when they cut this. I think Rich was only 19.\n\nBig Crowes fan here from '90/'91, so great thread.\n\nWhile SYMM is the album that got me into the Crowes (me and millions of others), it's a record I haven't played in years. Like Jon Carroll says above, this is mainly due to the dated production, but also partly due to the fact I have no interest in hearing songs such as Twice As Hard and She Talks To Angels again so overly-familiar have they become. Another reason is I have numerous live Crowes recordings and all the SYMM songs are far superior in a live setting, performed by a more mature band who had become infinitely superior musicians. For me, the Crowes don't really get going until Southern Harmony.\n\nSYMM is also something of both a blessing and a curse for the Crowes. A blessing in that it was phenomenally successful and allowed them to do what they wanted in years to come. A curse in that its radio-friendly smash hits are pretty unrepresentative of where the band has gone since, leading many to dismiss the Crowes as Faces/Stones clones, when the truth is the band draws on a far more interesting pool of influences, regularly surpassing these influences to create a rich soul/rock/gospel/Americana stew.\n\nWell said. If AMORICA was their first record, the band would be seen in an entirely different light. Like you said, SYMM was a blessing and a curse for them...but probably more of a blessing in retrospect...$$$.\n\nHmm...not to many responses for SYMM. I have to remember the Crowes have been pretty much a cult band since the mid-90's. I'll go to the next album, but feel free to give your opinions on SYMM if you just missed this thread....\n\nTHE SOUTHERN HARMONY AND MUSICAL COMPANION\n\nStudio album by The Black Crowes\n\nReleased May 12, 1992\n\nRecorded 1991\n\nGenre Blues-rock, hard rock\n\nLength 50:33\n\nLabel Def American\n\nProducer George Drakoulias\n\nThe Southern Harmony and Musical Companion is the second album by the American blues-rock group, the Black Crowes. It was released on May 12, 1992.\n\nIn 2006, the album was ranked number 100 on Guitar World magazine's list of the greatest 100 guitar albums of all time.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Chris Robinson and Rich Robinson, except where noted.\n\n\"Sting Me\" – 4:39\n\n\"Remedy\" – 5:22\n\n\"Thorn in My Pride\" – 6:03\n\n\"Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye\" – 6:28\n\n\"Sometimes Salvation\" – 4:44\n\n\"Hotel Illness\" – 3:59\n\n\"Black Moon Creeping\" – 4:54\n\n\"No Speak No Slave\" – 4:01\n\n\"My Morning Song\" – 6:15\n\n\"Time Will Tell\" (Bob Marley) – 4:08\n\nPersonnel\n\nChris Robinson – vocals\n\nRich Robinson – guitar\n\nMarc Ford – guitar\n\nJohnny Colt – bass guitar\n\nSteve Gorman – drums\n\nFROM WIKIPEDIA.ORG\n\nAttached Files:\n\n61x8KmzPKtL__SS500_.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n83.3 KB\n\nViews:\n\n0\n\nWikipedia should add Eddie Harsch's name to their list of Southern Harmony personnel, just like the band should have put him on the front cover and not just in a band shot on the main picture inside the booklet. That's always bothered me slightly...\n\nAnyway, following that digression, I bought this album aged 15 in its first week of release in 1992. It's no exaggeration to say this record changed my life forever. Firstly, friends and myself started collecting Crowes High As The Moon tour live shows and it dawned on me just how far this band was pushing the envelope. Via these boots and Chris Robinson's record recommendations in interviews, I was turned onto the myriad delights of Little Feat, The Allman Bros Band, Leon Russell and many others who were completely obscure to me at that time.\n\nSecondly, the album itself has stood the test of time remarkably well. The Robinson brothers' quality songwriting starts to shine here. Just look at the slower tempo songs - Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye and Sometimes Salvation, in particular - they just smoulder so beautifully.\n\nIn some respects (and this is a rather futile thought), I wish Southern Harmony was the Crowes' debut album. As far as I'm concerned, it's where the magic really begins; as far as the masses are concerned it's where the Crowes' magic ended (!). Amorica and Three Snakes were just around the corner though...\n\nEDITED TO ADD: I saw my first Crowes live show in July 1993 on the last night of the High As The Moon tour. Needless to say, the band was on fire.\n\nSH&MC is such a natural and loose sounding album. It still sounds great today. Many fans say it's the Crowes best album, and it's hard to argue. It's definitely one of their best. I think every (original) cut is strong. I might have ended the album after \"My Morning Song\", but they chose to close the album with Bob Marley's \"Time Will Tell\". It's an ok cover, but I'd rather hear the Clash do a reggae cover than the Crowes. A minor complaint. All of the originals here are top notch IMO. \"Sting Me\", \"Remedy\", \"Sometimes Salvation\", \"Thorn In My Pride\"...I could go on. Everything is a stepped up a notch on this album. The songwriting, the production, Chris's vocals, bringing Marc Ford & Ed Harsch on board...This is \"classic\" Crowes lineup. One of the best albums of 1992.\n\nI got on the Crowes bus after the return from their \"hiatus\". I went for SH&MC as my first CD. It is one of those releases that I LOVE 95% of the disc.\n\nBeing a long time Dead fan, a friend mentioned their taper friendly attitude. I discovered the world of soundboard and audience recordings of their shows. There are some absolutely incredible shows available from a variety of sources. The run of shows in 1996-1997 are amazing. They are one of the better live acts out there. Since their 2005 return, I have had the pleasure to see them 5 times.\n\nMy favorites from their live shows are often the selections played from SM&HC. These songs just come alive in a live setting with them stretching them out via improvisation.\n\nA fine album in spite of what they do with the pieces in a live setting.\n\nAlthough overplayed, I still feel Remedy has a certain majesty to it.\n\nLove this release to death...\n\nWhoa, great to see this thread.\n\nWonderwall - take a little more time between albums. This just started yesterday afternoon, and we're on Southern Harmony already? Give it at least 3-4 days for people who don't check here every day to find the thread.\n\nI've gotta go, but I'll come back to this thread tomorrow. One quick note - SYMM has that short piece of music that fades in and out at the end. It goes by the name Live Too Fast Blues and sometimes Mercy Sweet Moan. I always wanted to hear more of that song. Didn't they perform it at one of the Ronnie Scott's shows in the UK in the early 90's? I think I have a boot of that. Have to check Crowesbase.\n\nYou got it. It's just when I got on the board today around noon, it was already 8 pages back. I figured if it was that far back, and it wasn't even 24 hours (and we were on their most popular album), the thread would fade pretty fast. By putting SH&MC up already I hoped to stir up a bit of enthusiam. I will leave it for a few days though.\n\nI did a Ramones thread and it started out pretty well and faded into obscurity fairly quickly. I guess more of the bands that have a cult status don't do too well in these type of theads...some do ok.\n\nAnyway, talk about SYMM & SH&MC as much as you want until the thread is a good 10 pages back or so. Then I'll post AMORICA. Cool?\n\nSouthern Harmony is for the best record f the last 3o YEARS!!\n\nI had been a big Crowes fan already, having seen them live and and I listened to their debut all the time. I was 19 when that LP came out. I figured the Crowes saved me and rock and roll from that hair metal I never really liked, although Nirvana gets all the credit (NO WAY!!)\n\nI had thought about their new lp although I had loved the debut I asked myself, \"where can they go now....the next one will just be SYMM part 2\".\n\nBoy, was I wrong. This was rock music of passion, dynamics, majesty, and more. I could not BELIEVE how good the record was!!!! I instantly latched on to SHAMC as my LP and played it over and over. It also helped that at that exact time in my life I was going through the breakup of my first real adult relationship, so the lyrics stung me super deeply, in the best way. I LIVED THIS RECORD!\n\nNeedless to say I am still a HUGE Crowes fan, seen them over 30 times from LA to NYC and I still consider them the best rock band post 1980 of all time.\n\nAnother big Crowes fan here, i'm off to see them live on Wednesday night at the Brixton Academy\n\nThe first album is my least favourite Crowes album. Some very good songs but a little bit too slick. She Talks To Angels has always sounded a bit too polished for me. I'm not sure how US radio treats the Crowes but UK radio only ever plays one Crowes tune and that's the cover of Hard To Handle.....which annoys me as there's so many great Crowes tunes. A good debut but their later albums are much better.\n\nSH&MC is my fave Crowes album. Remedy is the tops. Production is much improved to my ears. Every song is great. They haven't really bettered this album - Bad Luck Blue Eyes, Sting Me, Thorn In My Pride, Sometimes Salvation.............all superb."
