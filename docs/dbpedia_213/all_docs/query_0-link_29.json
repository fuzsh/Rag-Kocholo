It went on to sell five million albums and featured the hits \"She Talks to Angels\" and \"Hard to Handle.\"\n\nAn email seeking comment from Chris Robinson wasn't immediately returned. He also fronts the band Chris Robinson Brotherhood.\n\nThe Black Crowes' last studio album was 2008's \"Warpaint.\""
