        "text": "Led by Atlanta-based siblings Chris (vocals) and Rich Robinson (guitar), the Black Crowes were steeped in the best arena-friendly, foot-stomping, stoner 70s-rock tradition. This 1992 sophomore effort added Southern rock to the band’s hard-rock mix, all whiskey-soaked vocals and snarling guitar solos. This expanded three-CD edition includes the official release (remastered from the original ¼-inch production master tape) and adds 14 previously unreleased tracks, including five alternate in-studio performances (a cover of Bob Dylan’s “Rainy Day Women #12 & 35,” a slow version of “Sting Me,” a slower take on the power ballad “Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye,” a more rockin’ “Sometimes Salvation,” and the Joe-Walsh-inspired “Black Moon Creeping”), B-sides, and such high-energy live tracks as the bad-boy confessional “Remedy,” recorded in Houston, Texas, in 1993. Swag includes a nifty hymnal with reminiscences by the Robinson boys, sheet music, and four lithographs. Other formats include a 4-LP set, a single remastered LP, a 2-CD “best of the box,” and hi-res downloads. It’s what the world needs now. This is the perfect companion to 2021’s Shake Your Money Maker 30th anniversary edition box set."
