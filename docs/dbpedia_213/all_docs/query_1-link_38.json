        "text": "When it comes to the top rock & roll vocalists over the last 30 years, Chris Robinson definitely deserves to be included. His charismatic and vibrant style brought The Black Crowes to prominence in the early ‘90s and he’s still kicking it with The Chris Robinson Brotherhood ever since the band formed in 2011. Robinson has a mellower approach with the current project that takes folk and roots and flips it into a psychedelic jam. The rhythm behind the band’s music is meant to make people dance. When Robinson and the gang roll through the ballroom at Fete Music Hall on July 24, live music enthusiasts will get a chance to do just that.\n\nAhead of the show, we had a chat about the foundations of The Brotherhood’s music, a certain Rhode Island connection, the legalization of marijuana and plans already being made for next year.\n\nRob Duguay: The Brotherhood has a psychedelic sound with huge Grateful Dead influence and a lot of rhythm. It's a bit different than the hard blues rock of The Black Crowes.\n\nChris Robinson: There’s a bit of a blues element. I don’t think The Black Crowes had a big blues based sound, it was more of us taking an influence from English ‘70s rock and putting our own spin in on it.\n\nRD: When The Brotherhood was starting out, what made you guys want to go this particular route?\n\nCR: Like anything else, unless you’re Todd Rundgren or someone like him, it’s a collaboration when you’re not making records all on your own. The Black Crowes had the lucky and the unlucky circumstance of making music that became very popular and we were stuck on trying to replicate it in order to maintain it. The catalyst for my songwriting and how it has flowered into what The Brotherhood is today comes from the folk tradition. My father was a folk singer for Paramount Records and I grew up in a house enriched with the beautiful loving sounds American roots and all sorts of music. I found as a young person that all that music was connected in some way and I still don’t feel the need to wax poetic because it’s just a human thing.\n\nBeing the logo for this current band is just musically my interests outside of the music that I’m usually into. People are shocked when they learn that I didn’t listen to a lot of hard rock when I was growing up. I have but I’ve listened to so much more rootsy, bluegrass, jazz, avant-garde, reggae and dub music. Also, the nature of it is that it’s our world that we’ve created and the music is committed to being harmonic and beautiful. There are songs that have some sort of emotional component and they’re in a place where people can feel comfortable to be themselves and at the end of the day, they can dance for a couple of hours.\n\nRD: There’s a vibe within the band’s music that definitely gives that sensation. The band also has a Rhode Island connection through working with producer Thom Monahan, who is from Cumberland and he currently lives in Los Angeles. What's it like to work with Thom in the studio and what's his approach like when it comes to making an album?\n\nCR: Thom was instrumental in our inception. I like his “sonic quilting” (laughs), there are a things on the first couple of albums where it was a grab bag of stuff. He had some studio recordings and some live recordings so he weaved some pieces here and some pieces there. Initially the Phosphorescent Harvest record was really weird with us doing the basic tracks and then during the rest of the year it was put together in pieces when we were off the road. In a way, that record was a patchwork but the way he kept it cohesive and sounding fresh is a real gift.\n\nRD: It’s what keeps an album from sounding boring. Over the years you've been very vocal about the use of and advocacy for marijuana. This decade has seen it become legalized in eight states and Washington, D.C. while 22 other states have legalized it for medicinal purposes. The current government doesn’t seem to be that hip to the full legalization of marijuana throughout the United States. It looks like they want to put it back to how it used to be when you’d be put in jail for a few months or a couple years for smoking a joint. Do you see this movement of legalization growing or are you wary of it?\n\nCR: You pretty much answered it yourself by going through the numbers. There are people who’d really like to go back to a lot of horrible, backwards, ignorant, fear-driven and regressive things. Inevitably, that stuff is about keeping poor people poor. As harsh, cruel and hate-filled one future is, the duality of that is a future that’s different. The Earth knows that we live in a time of great anxiety and we poison our planet but it still gives us natural options to deal with the anxiety, pain and trauma and survive through it.\n\nI think progression will win out. The rich stay rich and the poor stay poor and at the end of the day cannabis is a cash crop. People will start to see it work for their communities and the municipalities as well.\n\nRD: Especially since for most of the decade it has been listed in the top three of the most profitable crops in the country. There's a lot of soul in the way you sing. Did you spend a lot of your upbringing listening to soul music or did you not get into that music until your teens?\n\nCR: Of course. I’m not the biggest Motown fan, I prefer the southern sound but The Black Crowes’ first hit “Hard To Handle” is an Otis Redding song. I didn’t have a producer pick it for me, I brought it to him. I’m from Atlanta and African-American culture is deeply embedded in me and it has been around me my whole life. Music has always been a part of everyday life and when people started recording it, it became a physical thing. It’s always going to be something different but at its essence it’s all a human thing. I don’t think you’d get very far is music without listening to any kind of soul, maybe people have but I don’t know them.\n\nRD: After this summer tour, do you plan on getting into any other projects or will The Brotherhood be your main musical outlet for now?\n\nCR: We just finished making a new record a few weeks ago. We’re already booking shows in Europe for next summer for festivals. This band is the little engine that could, it keeps pumping along. I think I can, I think I can, I think I can, I think I can. The only other thing I have going on is this other band called the Green Leaf Rustlers and we play country covers. Waylon Jennings, Gram Parsons, that sort of stuff. We play a lot around California but that’s just for fun.\n\nLISTEN: Arts & Entertainment from the Providence Journal"
