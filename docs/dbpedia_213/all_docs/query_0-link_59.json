        "text": "After a 15-year hiatus from releasing original music, Chris and Rich Robinson have resurfaced with Happiness Bastards, their long-awaited 10th studio album. While some may argue that the there is an ulterior motive for this reunion between two brothers with a well-documented unsettled relationship, the fact of the matter is, the time was just right. And whether it's attributed to brotherly love or musical destiny, the reunion of this legendary band is a momentous occasion, one that just might breathe new life into rock and roll.\n\nAt a time when the essence of popular music is often obscured by corporate polish, the Black Crowes are reclaiming their classic sound with a raw authenticity that's been sorely missed. Happiness Bastards speaks to this ethos, delivering stripped-down rock and roll devoid of gloss or glitter. Instead, listeners are treated to the gritty, unapologetic fusion of dirty southern rhythm and blues that defines the band at their very best.\n\nSince reuniting in 2019, the Black Crowes have embarked on a triumphant journey, performing over 150 shows across 20 countries to commemorate the 30th anniversary of their breakthrough album, Shake Your Money Maker. However, upon returning from their extensive tour, the band felt the need to offer something fresh and relevant. Thus, the Robinsons, alongside longtime bassist Sven Pipien, ventured into the studio with producer Jay Joyce (Orville Peck, Eric Church, Brothers Osborne) in early 2023.\n\nAs they dug in, the experiences of their past years together seamlessly intertwined with the new music, guiding them back to their roots. The result is Happiness Bastards â€“ an album that not only marks a significant milestone in the band's career but also serves as a reminder of authentic rock and roll."
