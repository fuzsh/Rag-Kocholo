Using Rich Robinson's descending chord progressions as a base, the band grooves its way through a remarkably fresh-sounding collection of Faces-like rockers and ballads, tearing into the material with flair and confidence. The album features the singles \"Remedy\", \"Thorn in My Pride\", \"Hotel Illness\" and \"Sting Me\".\n\nThis edition was remastered in 2023 from the original 1/4\" production master tape. The remastering was overseen by Chris & Rich Robinson and album producer George Drakoulias.\n\nHeavyweight double vinyl produced by American Recordings in 2023.\n\nTRACKLISTING:"
