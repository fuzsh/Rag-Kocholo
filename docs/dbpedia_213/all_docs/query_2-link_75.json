        "text": "James Villa Photography\n\nOn a warm spring evening in Irving, Texas, the iconic Southern rock band The Black Crowes took the stage at the Toyota Music Factory, delivering a captivating performance that had the capacity crowd on their feet from start to finish.\n\nThe night kicked off with the bluesy stomp of “Bedside Manners,” immediately setting the tone for a night that would showcase the band’s unparalleled musicianship and soulful sound. The energy only continued to build as the Crowes delved into newly revived fan favorites “Come On” and “Dirty Cold Sun.”\n\nGuitarist Rich Robinson was in top form, his fingers dancing effortlessly across the fretboard as he and lead singer Chris Robinson traded off scorching solos throughout the evening. Tracks like “Twice as Hard” and “Stare It Cold” allowed the band to showcase their dynamic range, transitioning seamlessly from gritty, hard-hitting riffs to delicate, introspective passages.\n\nOne of the evening’s highlights came when the band dusted off the rarely played “Horsehead,” eliciting roars of approval from the crowd. The song’s driving rhythm and wailing guitar work perfectly encapsulated the Crowes’ compelling blend of Southern rock, blues, and psychedelia.\n\nMidway though the set a crowd favorite “Hard to Handle” a cover from Otis Redding set the mood for the remainder of the evening. Chris jokes with the crowd and was in high spirits and it showed he poked fun at Texas weather and the crowd soaked it up, followed with laughter and applause.\n\nOther standout moments included a passionate rendition of the power ballad “She Talks to Angels,” as well as an extended, jam-heavy take on the classic “Thorn in My Pride.” The encore saw the band paying tribute to their influences, delivering electrifying cover of Chuck Berry’s “Carol.”\n\nThroughout the nearly two and a half hour set, The Black Crowes demonstrated why they remain one of the most revered and influential rock acts of their generation. Their unwavering commitment to their craft, coupled with their ability to captivate audiences, solidified their status as true masters of their craft on this unforgettable night in Irving.\n\nSetlist\n\nBedside Manners\n\nCome On (tour debut)\n\nDirty Cold Sun\n\nTwice as Hard\n\nStare It Cold\n\nCross Your Fingers\n\nHorsehead (tour debut)\n\nSister Luck\n\nWanting and Waiting\n\nHard to Handle (Otis Redding cover)\n\nShe Talks to Angels\n\nFlesh Wound\n\nNo Speak No Slave (tour debut)\n\nThorn in My Pride (with extended jam)\n\nJealous Again\n\nRemedy\n\nEncore\n\nCarol (Chuck Berry cover) (Live debut)"
