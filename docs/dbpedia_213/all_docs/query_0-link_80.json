        "text": "The Black Crowes Happiness Bastards (Photo: Ross Halfin)\n\nThe Black Crowes get right to it with “Bedside Manners,” the opening track on the blues/rock greats‘ new record, Happiness Bastards, their first set of original material in 15 years.\n\nA snarling lead guitar riff gives way to singer Chris Robinson‘s unmistakable vocals as he delivers the line:\n\n“Do not disturb” on the door\n\nPile of clothes on the floor\n\nBedside manners, profane grammar\n\nI’ve seen this scene before\n\nIt packs all the swagger, the sweat, and the energy that has given the band — helmed as always by Robinson and brother Rich Robinson — its compelling edge for decades.\n\nThe rollicking “Wanting and Waiting” received its own music video a few weeks back — the Crowes’ first music video in 16 years:\n\nHappiness Bastards has been in the works for a while, and received a boost of anticipation when the Black Crowes went out on the acclaimed tour commemorating 1990’s Shake Your Money Maker, the album that put the band on the map.\n\nClick here to pick up Happiness Bastards on CD from our Rock Cellar Store\n\nClick here to pick up Happiness Bastards on LP from our Rock Cellar Store\n\nSaid producer Jay Joyce of the creation of this new record, in a statement:\n\n“These guys came to town like a freight train. Ready to lay it down, no bullshit. Old school real, live and raw. They brought the OG magic of their early albums along with some young punk spirit. I was honored to have captured it.”\n\nAdded the Robinson brothers:\n\n“Happiness Bastards is our love letter to rock n’ roll. Rich and I are always writing and creating music; that has never stopped for us, and it is always where we find harmony together. This record represents that.” – Chris\n\n“This album is a continuation of our story as a band. Our years of experience writing and making music and touring the world are represented in this record, and we were brilliantly guided by one of the best producers in the business, Jay Joyce. I am incredibly proud of what we put together.” – Rich\n\nIn full, Happiness Bastards presents the Black Crowes at their most visceral: loud, proud and boundlessly confident, it’s a powerful return to form sure to appeal to longtime fans.\n\nListen below:\n\nClick here to pre-order Happiness Bastards on CD from our Rock Cellar Store\n\nClick here to pre-order Happiness Bastards on LP from our Rock Cellar Store\n\nAnd catch The Black Crowes on the road in the months ahead:"
