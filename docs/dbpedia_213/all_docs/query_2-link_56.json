        "text": "Jimmy Page on Seeing Steven Tyler Perform with the Black Crowes\n\nThe Black Crowes had a special guest join them on stage during their May 15 show in London in the form of Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler. Believe it or not, they also had another massive special guest taking in the show: Jimmy Page.\n\nAs previously reported, Tyler, who’s been ailing from a vocal cord issue, appeared on stage during the encore of the Black Crowes’ show to perform “Mama Kin.” Ultimate Classic Rock notes Tyler walked on stage unannounced to join the band, which added to the surprise moment. Considering he’s still recovering from his vocal cord issue and hasn’t performed live in months, he sounded pretty great.\n\nJimmy Page’s Review of the Show\n\nIn a post on Facebook, Page heaped praise on the Black Crowes, who he said were “absolutely phenomenal.”\n\nThe guitar icon noted, “It was so good to see brothers Rich and Chris Robinson reunited and back beyond their best. I was also impressed by the band’s new guitarist, Nico Bereciartua, from Argentina and also to hear Sven Pipien on bass once more.”\n\nPage added about Tyler’s special appearance, “During the encore, it was a thrill to watch as Steven Tyler emerged from the side of the stage to team-up with the band for a cover of Aerosmith’s ‘Mama Kin.’ It was all such great fun and well done to Rich, Chris and the rest of the band for such an enjoyable and thrilling performance.”\n\nPage also mentioned how he teamed up with the Black Crowes for the 2000 live album Live at The Greek. He wrote, “I’d always thought the The Black Crowes were an exceptional band, I always thought brothers Rich and Chris are great performers and musicians – I still do but now even more so.”\n\nA Brief Timeline of Steven Tyler Dealing with His Vocal Issues\n\nIn September 2023, Aerosmith postponed a handful of dates on their farewell tour. At the time, it was revealed Tyler suffered vocal cord damage that led to “subsequent bleeding.” Doctors also instructed him to go on vocal rest and not sing for 30 days.\n\nWeeks later, Aerosmith postponed their entire farewell tour until 2024 due to issues related to Tyler’s vocal cord injury.\n\nThe band shared in a statement, “Unfortunately, Steven’s vocal injury is more serious than initially thought. His doctor has confirmed that in addition to the damage to his vocal cords, he fractured his larynx which requires ongoing care.”\n\nThe band noted, “He is receiving the best medical treatment available to ensure his recovery is swift, but given the nature of a fracture, he is being told patience is essential.”\n\nTyler added in his own personal statement, “I am heartbroken to not be out there with Aerosmith, my brothers and the incredible Black Crowes, rocking with the best fans in the world. I promise we will be back as soon as we can!”\n\nLast month, Aerosmith announced their rescheduled tour dates for 2024-25, which kick off in September.
