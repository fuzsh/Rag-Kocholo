        "text": "The Black Crowes\n\nMohegan Sun • 1 Mohegan Sun Blvd, Uncasville, CT 06382\n\nFebruary 28, 2025\n\nTickets go on sale on July 19, 2024 via Ticketmaster.com\n\nHappiness Bastards Tour (The Reprise)\n\nContinuing the momentum from the wildly successful release of their first album in 15 years, legendary rock band The Black Crowes announced, Happiness Bastards Tour (The Reprise) – set to hit 22 additional cities in North America this fall and winter including Mohegan Sun Arena on Friday, February 28th for one night of soulful, swaggering Rock N’ Roll during their 7:30pm show.\n\nTickets go on sale Friday, July 19th at 10:00am via Ticketmaster.com. Subject to availability, fans of the multi-platinum group can purchase tickets at the Mohegan Sun Box Office starting on Saturday, July 20th.\n\nNamed after Happiness Bastards, their critically acclaimed 10th studio album and first original album in 15 years, The Black Crowes: Happiness Bastards Tour (The Reprise) kicks off in Cincinnati on September 28th and concludes with the Mohegan Sun Arena show on February 28th. The upcoming run follows the band’s highly successful 35-date Happiness Bastards tour which ran through North America and Europe this spring.\n\nServing as a salute to their past and a celebration of the present and future, Happiness Bastards, released in March 2024, included 10 new tracks, with a very special feature from GRAMMY-winning Country superstar Lainey Wilson on “Wilted Rose.” Produced by GRAMMY Award-Winning producer Jay Joyce, the project emphasizes The Black Crowes’ influence as one of the most vital Rock bands of this generation. Happiness Bastards finds the brothers leaning into their creative common ground to deliver their most compelling work to date.\n\nThe Black Crowes are leaving the BS in the past. 15 years after their last album of original music, the Robinson Brothers present Happiness Bastards – their 10th studio album. Some may say the project has been several tumultuous years in the making, but we argue it’s arriving at just the right time. Call it brotherly love or music destiny that brought them back together, the highly anticipated record consecrating the reunion of this legendary band just may be the thing that saves Rock & Roll. In a time where the art form is buried beneath the corporate sheen of its successors, The Black Crowes are biting back with the angst of words left unsaid penned on paper and electrified by guitar strings, revealing stripped, bare-boned Rock & Roll. No gloss, no glitter, just rhythm and blues at its very best – gritty, loud, and in your face. The Robinson Brothers and longtime bassist Sven Pipien headed to the studio with producer Jay Joyce in early 2023 and the experiences of years past transcribed themself through the music as the band found their way back to their roots. And it’s finally here – Happiness Bastards is out now.\n\nHappiness Bastards Tour (The Reprise) Dates\n\nShare your Mohegan Sun experience with us by using #findingconnecticut on Instagram\n\nClick here to learn more about Mohegan Sun\n\nClick here for the latest Mohegan Sun news\n\nClick here for Mohegan Sun events\n\nClick here for events in New London County\n\nClick here for the latest news in New London County\n\n••••• Message center •••••••\n\nConnecticut business owners:\n\nConnecticut with us!
