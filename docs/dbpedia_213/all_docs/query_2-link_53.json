        "text": "Steven Tyler Makes Surprise Appearance During Black Crowes Show\n\nSteven Tyler is clearly on the road to recovery, as evidenced by his surprise appearance at a Black Crowes show in London last night (May 15).\n\nThe Aerosmith frontman, who’s been ailing from a vocal cord issue, appeared on stage during the encore of the Black Crowes’ show to perform “Mama Kin.” Ultimate Classic Rock notes Tyler walked on stage unannounced to join the band, which added to the surprise moment.\n\nSo, how did the Demon of Screamin’ sound during the performance? Pretty damn great, especially considering his ongoing recovery and having not performed live in months.\n\nA Brief Timeline of Steven Tyler Dealing with His Vocal Issues\n\nIn September 2023, Aerosmith postponed a handful of dates on their farewell tour. At the time, it was revealed Tyler suffered vocal cord damage that led to “subsequent bleeding.” Doctors also instructed him to go on vocal rest and not sing for 30 days.\n\nWeeks later, Aerosmith postponed their entire farewell tour until 2024 due to issues related to Tyler’s vocal cord injury.\n\nThe band shared in a statement, “Unfortunately, Steven’s vocal injury is more serious than initially thought. His doctor has confirmed that in addition to the damage to his vocal cords, he fractured his larynx which requires ongoing care.”\n\nThe band noted, “He is receiving the best medical treatment available to ensure his recovery is swift, but given the nature of a fracture, he is being told patience is essential.”\n\nTyler added in his own personal statement, “I am heartbroken to not be out there with Aerosmith, my brothers and the incredible Black Crowes, rocking with the best fans in the world. I promise we will be back as soon as we can!”\n\nLast month, Aerosmith announced their rescheduled tour dates for 2024-25, which kick off in September. A full list of the rescheduled dates is below.\n\nAerosmith Rescheduled Tour Dates: 2024-25\n\nSeptember 20 – PPG Paints Arena – Pittsburgh, PA\n\nSeptember 23 – Wells Fargo Center – Philadelphia, PA\n\nSeptember 26 – KFC Yum!
