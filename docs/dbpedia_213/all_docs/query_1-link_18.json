        "text": "It’s no secret that I’ve been a huge fan of the Black Crowes since I first heard “Jealous Again” while I was driving around in my car in 1990. Granted, it wasn’t until I heard “Hard To Handle” that I drove to the record store and bought their landmark debut Shake Your Money Maker, but man am I glad I did. We shared our thoughts on that great debut album’s 30th Anniversary box previously. The Black Crowes were our new Stones for the 90s, or so we thought. They stood out to me because they played solid blues rock – very Faces, Humble Pie, Stonesy – in a world full of Grunge. In a universe of flannel shirts, they had leather pants on.\n\nBut alas, as I wrote in my piece The Mark of Cain: When Brothers Form Bands, when siblings form bands it can sometimes lead to some explosive chemistry. The Brothers Robinson were no exception to that sad rule… Much like the Brothers Gallagher in Oasis, their battles were legendary. (Liam does have a great new song out right now by the way, with ex-Stone Roses’ guitarist John Squire, “Just Another Rainbow”). The Crowes broke up shortly after putting out 2001’s Lions but reunited in 2008 and put out a couple of strong late career records but the reunion didn’t “hold.” Frankly, I thought that was it for the Black Crowes.\n\nBut then, in late 2019 (I believe, my timeline for what happened pre and post COVID is a bit off) I read in a magazine that the brothers had tried to rebuild their relationship as brothers, as human beings. If they could do that they might consider a band reunion. Thankfully for the Robinson Family Thanksgivings, the two managed to sort out their personal relationship. They were going to tour in 2020 to celebrate the aforementioned Shake Your Money Maker‘s 30th Anniversary but, pandemic. There were signs of life for the band, however. Late in ’20 they released “Back Door Santa,” a Xmas song even I can get behind and I don’t love Xmas songs. In ’21 we got the box for Shake Your Money Maker and there were some great outtakes and a live concert that everyone should hear. In ’22 they released a great EP of cover songs from ‘72 entitled, creatively 1972. It was clear the reunion was holding but they were taking only tentative steps toward new music.\n\nAfter celebrating their fabulous second album last fall with a deluxe box, Southern Harmony & Musical Companion – Super Deluxe, the rumors began that new Crowes music was on the way. Last Friday we finally got some new Black Crowes when they released their first new song in 15 years. The new track is “Wanting And Waiting,” which describes my feelings about new Crowes music… I’ve been wanting it but man I have been waiting a long time. It turns out, it was worth the wait!\n\nAs far as personnel on this song/album, I know that Chris Robinson (vocals), Rich Robinson (guitar) and former Crowes member Sven Pippien (bass) play on the song. Sven is apparently the only past member invited to the reunited version of the band. I assume that the folks who played on 1972 played on this record, but with the mercurial Robinsons, who knows: Isaiah Mitchell (guitars), Joel Robinow (keyboards), and Brian Griffin (drums). Of course, Rich could be playing all the guitar parts. I’ve scoured the internet but couldn’t come up with any answers…\n\n“Wanting And Waiting” starts off with a grinding, galloping guitar. When the organ kicks in the song just soars. I have to admit when I first heard it it had echos of “Jealous Again,” in a good way. Chris Robinson is in his usual fine vocal form. I love the big chorus. This isn’t a sad song about waiting for a lover… it’s more of an energetic expression of one man’s frustration. Who likes waiting anyway? I may have to put this track on my Waiting Playlist. “I’m nothing but lonely, waiting and wanting, wanting and waiting for you…” I think we’ve all been there. This track even has some backup vocalists ala Southern Harmony’s best tracks. I just love this song. What a great way to reintroduce themselves. Here’s the track:\n\nTurn this one up loud! There are several new songs that have come out of late, including the Liam Gallagher/John Squire track I mentioned earlier but “Wanting And Waiting” is my favorite of the bunch. Who among us couldn’t use a little more blues rock in our lives these days.\n\nCheers and stay warm out there… I don’t remember I saw the sun…"
