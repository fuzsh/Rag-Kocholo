        "text": "It’s hard not to be cynical about a Black Crowes reunion. The Atlanta-based blues-rock band rose to fame in the ‘90s, and currently, many ‘90s bands are cashing in on nostalgia with reunion tours. Brothers Chris (vocals) and Rich (guitar) Robinson famously can’t stand each other and very publicly stopped speaking to each other in 2015, retreating to solo projects and declaring that the band was no more. And yet, here we are in 2024, with a new Black Crowes record—their ninth, unless you count its 2-disc predecessor, Before the Frost…Until the Freeze (2009), as two separate albums. Even more surprising, this record is actually pretty good.\n\nHappiness Bastards shows the Brothers Robinson exerting a discipline that they didn’t have in their youth. In the past, many of the Black Crowes’ albums were meandering and unfocused, but Happiness Bastards is tighter than previous LPs. Producer Jay Joyce (Cage the Elephant, Eric Church) clearly wanted to get down to business because the album was reportedly made in just two and a half weeks. The result is a record that sounds like the Black Crowes at their best.\n\nThe first half of the album is undeniably strong, classic Black Crowes-sounding material. “Wanting and Waiting,” “Bedside Manners,” and “Rats and Clowns” are all rousing, Southern blues rocker tunes. Chris Robinson’s voice sounds as good as ever, although his lyrics are a little angrier than they were in his mellow Chris Robinson Brotherhood days. The jaunty saloon piano in opening stomp, “Bedside Manners,” runs interference for the bitterness of the words: “Put a knife in my back, expect me to say please/ With friends like these, who needs enemies?” In “Wanting and Waiting,” a yearning tune that evokes (or nicks) the band’s own “Jealous Again,” Chris even sings, “Trying to stay friendly but feeling so hostile.” “Rats and Clowns” has a nasty groove to match its subject matter of drug addicts who won’t share: “Poison powder everywhere, but no one’s got a grain to spare.” “Cross Your Fingers” has a beguiling, “Thorn in my Pride”-like acoustic intro, before it shifts and launches into heavy, Zeppelin-esque electric guitar. “I’ve been made to suffer for your indignities/ And I’ve forsaken kindness, for there is none for me,” Chris sings.\n\nThe Black Crowes have always worn their blues and classic rock influences on their sleeve, and Happiness Bastards is no exception. “Bleed It Dry” features some fantastic bluesy harmonica. However, they step outside the box a few times, with generally good results. “Wilted Rose” is a Southern Gothic ballad that’s also a duet with country artist Lainey Wilson. Chris’ voice sounds excellent alongside Wilson’s, and it is a welcome interlude. “Flesh Wound” is oddly pop-punk-flavored, with its quick, simple drumbeat and overcaffeinated guitar.\n\nAlbum closer, “Kindred Friend,” a slow Americana number that sounds more like the songs on their previous album, opens with a very “Piano Man”-esque harmonica. “Tomorrow owes nothing to the past,” Chris sings, but that isn’t quite true. The Robinsons are in the position they’re in now because of the past, for better or for worse. Their greatest successes have resulted from the Black Crowes. Perhaps that’s why they agreed to reunite for this album, finally (but no doubt grudgingly) admitting that they do their best work when they’re playing together.\n\nWhile they’ve touted the inclusion of “longtime bassist” Sven Pipien on this album to make it seem more like a real band, Pipien is not the Crowes’ original bass player. More notable, though, is the absence of original drummer, Steve Gorman, the sideman who was with them for longest and who will likely never be forgiven by the Robinsons for his warts-and-all memoir, Hard to Handle: The Life and Death of the Black Crowes (2019), about his time in the band. Gorman is replaced with Brian Griffin on drums, and Argentinian Nico Bereciartua takes the place of guitarist Jeff Cease (though it has been filled by many other musicians in the intervening years).\n\nHappiness Bastards’ hideous, all-caps, black-letters-over-white background cover art is obviously intended as some sort of statement—the thin whitewash only partially hides the cover of their (arguably) best album, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion (1992). Why the Robinson brothers would want to cover up their greatest success both creatively and commercially is a mystery. Especially since this album is not the antithesis of Southern Harmony, but rather it’s probably the closest they’ve ever come to repeating its blues-rock perfection."
