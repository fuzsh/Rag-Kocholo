        "text": "A multi-platinum recording artist that I studied with once offered me these career changing words: “Good people borrow, great people steal; you just have to make it your own.” This means as a songwriter, don’t deny your influences: embrace them. On the heels of 1980’s decadence, Rock and Roll gave us the Black Crowes. The Black Crowes reminded us that it’s not all about spandex, larger than life drum sets and lyrics of gratuitous sex. History has shown that every decade has a style that the masses grab a hold of; whether it be disco, grunge, etc. and then along comes an artist that says, “Enough!” Said artist takes us back to the vibe that moved us all years earlier and does it their way.\n\nThe Black Crowes have been delivering solid records into three decades now. Their longevity, albeit not without occasional turbulence, can be largely attributed to their uncanny ability to maintain their original audience and attract new generations of fans with each record and tour. The Crowes’ DNA is comprised of a veritable melting pot of influences like The Faces, The Grateful Dead, The Allman Brothers Band, and The Rolling Stones, with a hint of Led Zeppelin and Humble Pie for good measure. With roots originating in Atlanta, GA, geography is also an undoubtedly crucial aspect of the bands genetic make-up.\n\nWe first heard from The Black Crowes in 1990 with their now five times platinum debut, Shake Your Money Maker. The album produced half a dozen chart topping singles including original compositions Twice As Hard, Jealous Again and a cover of the 1968 Otis Redding classic, Hard to Handle. In 1992, the band gave us the absolutely phenomenal follow up, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion. The record served up another six singles, all staking their claim in the charts; three of them locking down the #1 ranking in Billboard’s Mainstream Rock charts. Among those were Remedy, Sting Me and my personal favorite, Thorn in My Pride. The remainder of the 90s would see The Black Crowes endure a few lineup changes, relentless touring, three additional records and nine more singles. In ’99 the six piece performed four shows with iconic rock god Jimmy Page. Those shows resulted in a stellar 2-disc live set of Zeppelin classics and blues covers delivered with both the finesse and bombast demanded by the material.\n\nWith the onset of the new millennium, things would slow down for the band, but only slightly. A sabbatical here and there would allow brothers Rich and Chris Robinson, (guitarist and frontman respectively) to pursue side projects such as Rich’s Hookah Brown, and Chris’s New Earth Mud and Chris Robinson Brotherhood. Since 2000, amidst typical band ups and downs, they managed to churn out four more studio records; five live albums, and continue to remain relevant.\n\nThe Black Crowes emerged at time when America was in dire need for a rock and roll roots revival. They seamlessly meld their array of influences into their own, incredible music full of conviction, heart and soul, making them an influence in their own right. With over 35 million units sold worldwide, they’ve built a reputation as a killer live act, crafted songwriters and musicians that play from the gut. They’ve paid their dues, weathered the storms and served their predecessors well. The Black Crowes have earned their staying power. Currently on an extensive North American tour with the Tedeschi Trucks Band, they will be headlining the Peach Music Festival’s Peach Stage in Scranton, PA on closing night, Sunday, August 18th.\n\nJOHNNY ZAPP | www.johnnyzapp.com | www.facebook.com/johnnyzapp76"
