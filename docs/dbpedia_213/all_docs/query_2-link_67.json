        "text": "The Black Crowes have always pulled from previous eras, meshing old time rock 'n' roll with elements of blues, soul and glam, and fashioning it into something fierce enough to sit alongside the artists who influenced them, yet fresh enough to fit in with contemporary pop. The Atlanta, Georgia group’s ability to conjure the past while bringing something gritty and new to the present has served them well throughout their almost three-decade long career.\n\nAfter a couple breaks over the years, brothers Chris and Rich Robinson’s most recent reunion in 2019 coincided with a tour announcement and planned track-by-track celebration of their 1990 debut album Shake Your Money Maker. But the pandemic forced cancellation for over a year, and the tour has just resumed in recent months.\n\nMoney Maker’s standout jam had to be their cover of Otis Redding’s \"Hard to Handle\" which became a breakout hit on MTV and radio, and went to No.1 on Billboard’s Album Rock Tracks chart. The song was a mostly faithful cover in terms of arrangement, but vocally, Chris added a smidge of Southern twang to the mix and a lot of sexy swagger, too, while Rich’s guitarwork amped up the tempo and rhythmic heft.\n\nDespite their obvious inspirations (the Stones, the Faces), the Crowes are more than retro rock redux. Yet after eight albums, they are at their best when referencing and reinterpreting the music they love. Which makes their latest, 1972, a joyous idea and real treat for fans as the band continues to tour the country.\n\nThe EP, which is available exclusively on Amazon Music right now (the release will widen to other streaming platforms at a later date), features six iconic songs from ‘72. As Rich shared with GRAMMY.com after the band’s intimate record release show at the famed Whiskey Au-Go-Go on the Sunset Strip in LA, the project is about highlighting the musical diversity of this particular year, while also paying tribute to it.\n\n\"We honored the year because to me, what’s amazing about that snapshot in musical history was the scope of the music being played and less of the over-commercialization of music,\" he explains. \"Nowadays, everything is over generified. Back then, you had Joni Mitchell, Led Zeppelin, or the Rolling Stones, or Cat Stevens in the '70s. David Bowie to Bob Dylan to Neil Diamond…. Everyone was going for something unique. When you heard Bob Dylan or the Rolling Stones or Little Feat you knew exactly who it was, so that’s why we chose to focus on that era specifically.\"\n\nWe asked the guitarist to give his specific thoughts and feelings about all six of 1972’s classic song choices, and detail how the Crowes came up with the final tracklist.\n\n\"Rocks Off\" (The Rolling Stones)\n\nExile on Main Street is one of those albums that meant so much in our lives. Some albums were earth-shattering as they pertained to a piece of music that really stuck with me. Exile was one of those records I’ve never put down. \"Rocks Off\" is such a brilliant rock 'n' roll song. We wanted to do it because of the pure influence that the Rolling Stones and that record had on us as musicians and songwriters.\n\n\"The Slider\" (T-Rex)\n\nIt’s tough for me to talk about the mood of the era when I was 3 years old in 1972, but what I can comment on is what that song and T-Rex meant to me as I started listening in my teens and still listen today. T-Rex exuded something that was so meaningful musically, and coupled with his personality, the two intertwined perfectly.\n\n\"You Wear It Well\" (Rod Stewart)\n\nA great song is a great song. Early Rod is one of those things we listen to all the time, the Faces and his early records where basically the Faces played on them. He’s just a phenomenal singer. A brilliant songwriter. \"You Wear It Well\" conveyed something organic about the time that Rod really captured.\n\nHe and Ronnie Wood were able to do that at that time when not a lot of bands could. Songs like this and \"Every Picture Tells a Story\" and \"Maggie May\" have that acoustic guitar with the drum and his beautiful voice on top. It’s just so meaningful.\n\n\"Easy To Slip\" (Little Feat)\n\nI remember listening to [Little Feat] all the time on the school bus in 1990. That’s when it kind of hit me, the brilliance of Lowell George, of the songwriting, of the rhythm section. Everything about the band was stellar. \"Easy to Slip\" grabbed me instantly. It was something I felt a strong connection to so I thought I could maybe sing it.\n\n\"Moonage Daydream\" (David Bowie)\n\nIt was an interesting choice. We tried to choose songs that we could bring a little bit of ourselves to. \"Moonage Daydream\" is one of my favorite songs on that record, and it’s a little different for Bowie. It’s a journey. I love the tempo, his way with words, that phrasing. To put our take on that song was really far out and I’m very happy with the result.\n\n\"Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone\" (The Temptations)\n\nIt's such a brilliant song but we’re not an R&B band, so we had to figure out a way to make it work. Adding that rock 'n' roll element on the choruses in particular and a little slide in there helped make it our own. I’m really happy with the way it came out while simultaneously showing respect to the song.\n\nThe song is a gift. There’s a million bands, a million guitar players, a million singers, but it’s nothing without the song. In particular, it was amazing to do justice to, show reverence for, and bring a little bit of ourselves to this one.\n\nRevisiting The Clash's 'Combat Rock' At 40: Why They Stay And Have Never Gone\n\nImagine starting a world-conquering rock band with your brother, not speaking for eight years, then running into each other at the airport hotel. That's exactly what happened to Chris and Rich Robinson — the famously quarrelsome brothers at the heart of the Black Crowes.\n\nThose crossed paths eventually led the singer and guitarist to reconstitute the Crowes for the 30th anniversary of their hotcakes-selling 1990 debut, Shake Your Money Maker. (They're the only two original members of the band; bassist Sven Pipien's been with them on and off since 1998's By Your Side.)\n\nFans ate up those Shake Your Money Maker gigs — and now, the GRAMMY nominees are a truly creative entity once again. Their new album, Happiness Bastards — out March 15 via their own Silver Arrow Records — is their first in 15 years, and an inspired reset, drawing from the same stew of blues and boogie they lapped up hungrily than three decades ago.\n\nAs you absorb tunes like \"Bedside Manners,\" \"Wanting and Waiting\" and \"Kindred Friend,\" read on for a quick breakdown of what the Black Crowes have been up to during all the time off.\n\nThe Chris Robinson Brotherhood Forged Ahead — For A Time\n\nWhenever the Crowes' wings were clipped, Chris Robinson tended to reembrace what he calls his \"farm-to-table psychedelic band,\" which featured Crowes keyboardist Adam MacDougall, guitarist Neal Casal, and other close compadres. (Robinson's also brought Crowes songs to the stage solo.)\n\nRobinson clearly thought the word of Casal, a close collaborator with Ryan Adams; when Casal tragically died by suicide in 2019 at only 50, the Chris Robinson Brotherhood closed up shop for good. But before that…\n\nOld Songs, New Wings\n\nAround this time, Chris Robinson also started a satellite band, As The Crow Flies, which performed his old band's tunes — full stop. Former Crowes Audley Freed and Adam MacDougall joined the singer, as did guitarist Marcus King and drummer Tony Leone.\n\nBy all accounts, his intentions were pure. \"I'm not out to redo the Black Crowes or outdo the Black Crowes or anything like that,\" he said at the time. \"I just want to sing the music.\"\n\nRich Robinson Soldiered On Solo…\n\nAmid his older brother's musical adventures, Rich Robinson pressed on as a solo artist; he'd released his first solo album, Paper, in 2004.\n\nDuring their most recent hiatus, Rich released 2016's Flux, which he described as a \"very eclectic record and that it draws from all of my influences. It takes you on a journey and that's what records should do.\n\nEnglish rock rebels the Kinks have sold more than 50 million albums since forming in the '60s, although most of their hits — \"Lola,\" \" You Really Got Me,\" \"Apeman,\" \"(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman\" and \"Come Dancing\" among others — stemmed from the pen of Ray Davies.\n\nContrary to popular belief, brother Dave says he is good with that equation — but admits that the relationship between them is naturally tumultuous.\n\nDave Davies explained the dynamics of his relationship with Ray to The Daily Mail in 2017, describing it as \"a married couple who have just reached the end of the road.\"\n\n\"You know when one partner gives and gives and the other takes, and finally you realise (sic) you can’t do it any more?’\n\n\"You can’t divorce your brother, though. ‘No, you can’t. So we are stuck with each other, but I think I’ve accepted that this is just the way our relationship is.\n\nIn a separate interview with The Daily Express in 2011, Ray agreed. \"When we were together it was aggressive, violent, powerful but we triggered off each other.\"\n\nStill, the dust-ups between them were legendary, leading to a two-decade rift.\n\nAs recently as 2018, there's been talk that Ray and Dave Davies had buried the hatchet and were intent on reuniting the Kinks... but here we are in 2023 and that possibility seems no closer to reality.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival: John & Tom Fogerty\n\nAfter American rockers Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR) formed in El Cerrito, California in 1959 (they began as the Blue Velvets and rechristened themselves several times before settling on CCR in 1968), it was clear that lead singer, guitarist and songwriter John Fogerty was calling the shots — including acting as the band's manager.\n\nCCR included Fogerty's brother Tom, who played rhythm guitar; bass player Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford. Following a particularly lucrative period between 1969 and 1970, John decided that Tom would no longer sing lead on or co-write any song while he was in the band, despite previously handling lead vocals and collaborating on some pre-CCR material.\n\n\"He cut Tom Fogerty out from singing,\" Clifford told AZ Central in 2015. 'Without Tom...there wouldn't have been a Creedence Clearwater Revival. When Tom graciously gave up the vocals to his younger brother, he had no idea that he would never be singing another song again. So Stu and I and Tom were always at odds with John about that.\"\n\nTom Fogerty left after 1970's Pendulum, and apart from a 1980 reunion during his wedding reception, CCR never performed again. He died in 1990 after contracting AIDS from HIV-infected blood during a transfusion during back surgery, and was posthumously inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\nHeart: Ann & Nancy Wilson\n\nSometimes, money and control carry more weight than people insinuate.\n\nGuitarist Rich Robinson left the Black Crowes in January 2015 due to an alleged ownership agreement with brother and vocalist Chris. Both men divided and conquered with solo careers but remained largely incommunicado for almost five years.\n\nBut in an interview with the San Diego Union-Tribune, both Rich and Chris credited their children with healing the rift between them.\n\n\"My daughter, Cheyenne (now 11), was like: ‘What’s the deal with you and Uncle Rich, and why don’t I know my cousins?’\"Chris told the paper. \"Those are the kind of questions that will make you think and reflect.\"\n\n\"Definitely. Kids are honest and curious, and they don’t have issues like Chris and I did,\" Rich said in a joint interview with his brother. \"So, as Chris said, that opened a door (to reconciliation).\"\n\nTogether again since 2021, the Black Crowes will be shaking their moneymakers opening the final Aerosmith tour, once Steven Tyler's larynx heals.\n\nOasis: Liam & Noel Gallagher\n\nWhile backstage in 2009 in Paris, the tumultuous in-fighting between Oasis' Liam and Noel Gallagher reached new heights; a violent fistfight that drove a nail into the coffin of the band.\n\nNoel's statement: \"It's with some sadness and great relief to tell you that I quit Oasis tonight. 'People will write and say what they like, but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer.\"\n\nThis was the last in a number of physical altercations that had taken place over the years during tours. Since the split, Noel has been recording and touring with his band the High Flying Birds while Liam first took to the road and studio with Beady Eye, which split in 2014; he's now performing solo.\n\nHowever, Liam has reportedly expressed interest in reuniting with Noel and strike up Oasis, though whether there have been any private conversations towards this end remains to be seen.\n\n11 Iconic Concert Films To Watch After 'Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour'\n\nUpdated Friday Oct. 13, 2023 to include info about Kendrick Lamar's most recent GRAMMY wins, as of the 2023 GRAMMYs.\n\nA GRAMMY veteran these days, Kendrick Lamar has won 17 GRAMMYs and has received 47 GRAMMY nominations overall. A sizable chunk of his trophies came from the 58th annual GRAMMY Awards in 2016, when he walked away with five — including his first-ever win in the Best Rap Album category.\n\nThis installment of GRAMMY Rewind turns back the clock to 2016, revisiting Lamar's acceptance speech upon winning Best Rap Album for To Pimp A Butterfly. Though Lamar was alone on stage, he made it clear that he wouldn't be at the top of his game without the help of a broad support system.\n\n\"First off, all glory to God, that's for sure,\" he said, kicking off a speech that went on to thank his parents, who he described as his \"those who gave me the responsibility of knowing, of accepting the good with the bad.\"\n\nLooking for more GRAMMYs news? The 2024 GRAMMY nominations are here!\n\nHe also extended his love and gratitude to his fiancée, Whitney Alford, and shouted out his Top Dawg Entertainment labelmates. Lamar specifically praised Top Dawg's CEO, Anthony Tiffith, for finding and developing raw talent that might not otherwise get the chance to pursue their musical dreams.\n\n\"We'd never forget that: Taking these kids out of the projects, out of Compton, and putting them right here on this stage, to be the best that they can be,\" Lamar — a Compton native himself — continued, leading into an impassioned conclusion spotlighting some of the cornerstone rap albums that came before To Pimp a Butterfly.\n\n\"Hip-hop. Ice Cube. This is for hip-hop,\" he said. \"This is for Snoop Dogg, Doggystyle. This is for Illmatic, this is for Nas. We will live forever. Believe that.\"\n\nTo Pimp a Butterfly singles \"Alright\" and \"These Walls\" earned Lamar three more GRAMMYs that night, the former winning Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song and the latter taking Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (the song features Bilal, Anna Wise and Thundercat). He also won Best Music Video for the remix of Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood.\"\n\nLamar has since won Best Rap Album two more times, taking home the golden gramophone in 2018 for his blockbuster LP DAMN., and in 2023 for his bold fifth album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers.\n\nWatch Lamar's full acceptance speech above, and check back at GRAMMY.com every Friday for more GRAMMY Rewind episodes.\n\n10 Essential Facts To Know About GRAMMY-Winning Rapper J.
