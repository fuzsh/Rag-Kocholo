        "text": "One guitar. One amp. Four effects pedals. That’s all the gear Marc Ford brought with him on the road as the opening act on Southern rockers Allman Betts Band’s fall tour of music halls, clubs and small theaters.\n\nMeanwhile on some bigger tours, various bands that were famous in the ‘90s travel with road-cases full of guitars for them to pick from, play and switch between onstage. But Ford can pull more out of a single instrument than most of those musicians could from an entire Guitar Center. He’s that gifted.\n\n“Well, I don’t need any more than one,” Ford says in his laidback SoCal drawl, during our recent Zoom interview. “It’s only a 30, 40 minute set, and I don’t have a crew so I’m not going to be carrying a ton of guitars and switching and all that. I’m not trying to recreate any albums or anything. I’m just trying to make something happen right now.”\n\nYou may not know his name, but if you love a certain era of blues-based rock you know Marc Ford’s guitar playing. He was lead guitarist in The Black Crowes during that band’s classic era. His leads played a pivotal role in making 1992 sophomore disc “Southern Harmony and the Musical Companion” the definitive Crowes album.\n\n“Southern Harmony” drips with Ford’s vibrant solos. Blackout fuzz on drug lament “Sometimes Salvation.” Tender fills and soulful bends for afterglow anthem “Thorn in My Pride.” The wild wah that cuts up “No Speak No Slave” and the hot break on signature Crowes rocker “Remedy.”\n\nIn 2017 I wrote a story for LA Weekly about Ford and his musical connection with founding Crowes guitarist Rich Robinson. During the interview, I asked Ford how he came up with his scorching solos on “Southern Harmony,” an album recorded in just eight days.\n\nHere for the first time is Ford’s previously unpublished answer: “It’s just an instinct. I just kind of hear what’s the song doing and what does it need. What is it missing? Does there need to be another point of view? Does the guitar need to just come up alongside the guy singing and go, ‘Hell yeah, what he said!’ I don’t think in musical terms because I was never taught properly, so I see in colors and visuals, and that’s how I hear music.”\n\nLater in the conversation he added, “I’ve always understood the closest you can get your instrument to sound like a human utterance, that’s really the game. That’s the ultimate goal, to speak with it.”\n\nFord’s guitar – often a Les Paul or Strat colored with a vintage Fuzz Face effect - also elevated the third and fourth Black Crowes albums, “Amorica” and “Three Snakes and One Charm.” His fierce licks and improvisational prowess drove Crowes shows back then. Much as Mick Taylor musically supercharged The Rolling Stones in the late ‘60s, so did Ford with The Crowes in the early ‘90s.\n\nDuring another unpublished section of our 2017 interview, I asked Ford why he and the Crowes were so special together. “I’ve been thinking a lot about it,” Ford said then, “and there’s been a lot of artists, musicians that had like a real hot period and it kills a lot of people. (Jimi) Hendrix and (Janis) Joplin and Jim Morrison. And we had one. And it was hot. We forged a way to play together without knowing it, in the heat of that.”\n\nFord grew up in the suburbia of Cerritos, Calif. and his early listening tastes veered towards Judas Priest and Mahogany Rush. The Hendrix live album “Band of Gypsys” was a turning point. The mix of explosive and explorative in Hendrix’s “Gypsys” guitar would become hallmarks of Ford’s own playing. Eighties blues virtuoso Stevie Ray Vaughan became another central influence.\n\nBefore joining the Crowes, Ford gigged at clubs like Coconut Teaszer, Madame Wong’s and The Scream, fronting Los Angeles power-trio Burning Tree, who were signed to Epic Records, the same label as Michael Jackson. Burning Tree toured as an opener on a 1991 Black Crowes trek in which Ford sometimes sat-in with the Crowes on a cover of Allman Brothers classic “Dreams.” Soon after, The Black Crowes plucked up Ford after their own lead guitarist, Jeff Cease, wasn’t keeping up musically.\n\nThe Crowes aren’t the only juicy offer Ford’s had. Soon after joining The Black Crowes, Ford received a phone call from Guns N’ Roses guitarist Slash asking about Ford filling the GN’R guitar slot vacated after Izzy Stradlin quit during the “Use Your Illusion Tour.”\n\nFord explained to Slash he’d just joined the Crowes and politely declined his invitation. “Of course, I was very flattered,” Ford told me in 2017, “and my life would be a whole lot different now. I’d probably be dead, to be honest with you. I think it was probably the best decision and Slash agreed. He said, ‘Man, that’s really cool. That’s probably a better fit for you anyway and good luck.’”\n\nAround this time, Ford did a session for the solo debut by the same musician Slash had inquired about Ford replacing in GN’R, Stradlin. He walked into the sessions right after Stones guitarist Ron Wood finished recording a cover of Wood’s ‘70s solo gem “Take A Look At The Guy” with Stradlin. Ford played uncredited on Izzy’s opening track “Somebody’s Knockin’” because the Crowes didn’t want it to seem like Ford was just a hired gun. Looking back now, Ford can’t quite recall for sure what guitar he played on the session but says, “Maybe a Tele that was there.”\n\nDespite the rare musical chemistry between them, after a five-year or so run the Crowes parted ways with Ford, citing substance abuse issues. During his ‘90s Black Crowes period, the Crowes recorded two other albums that were shelved, although the tracks later surfaced on 2006 compilation “The Lost Crowes.” Many of the songs were re-recorded and released on “Amorica.” But quite a few, including standouts like “Paint an 8,” “Dirty Hair Halo” and “Wyoming & Me,” sat in the vault for 10 years or so.\n\nIt’s rare a major band has an album shelved during their prime. But it happens. Two albums shelved is another matter. Asked how frustrating that was for him, having put a lot of guitar and time into those sessions, Ford says now, “Stuff was so nutso at the time. And those two guys (Chris and Rich Robinson) couldn’t decide on anything together and it was just a constant power struggle between them too. It was mostly insane. And so trying to make sense out of anything was futile, I just went where they told me to go. It was their money. They could blow it how they wanted to. They were paying me to be there and play guitar.”\n\nWith his outsized talent and bigtime experience, Ford found other notable gigs. He was with rootsy singer/songwriter Ben Harper for a while. Ford earned a Grammy for his contributions to “There Will Be a Light,” Harper’s 2004 LP with gospel-vocal group Blind Boys of Alabama. He’s also been in the touring band of R&B icon Booker T. Jones, of Booker T. & The MGs fame.\n\nOf the Booker T. stint, Ford says, “I learned a real lesson on something that I thought I had a good handle on, which was simplicity. The funk really comes from everyone playing together, straight. It’s wizards level.”\n\nFord played guitar with and produced Americana act Ryan Bingham, who’d go on to win an Academy Award for the song “Weary Kind” from 2009 Jeff Bridges film “Crazy Heart.” He’s also recorded with former Drive-By Trucker bassist Shonna Tucker.\n\nAround 2002 or so, Ford received a second offer to join Guns N’ Roses,, he revealed during a 2021 interview with the Black Crowes-themed podcast State of Amorica. This was during the elongated recording sessions for GN’R’s “Chinese Democracy” album, which was eventually released in 2008.\n\n“I didn’t want to have any part of it,” Ford tells AL.com. “And with the nightmare stories I’d heard about it, forget it. I’d already went through something that I didn’t want to repeat, and to imagine an even worse scenario …” He says another reason he turned down a job with Guns N’ Roses was to make his first solo album, released in 2003 as “It’s About Time.” (Which was, coincidentally, recorded at the house of Slash, who’d by then split from GN’R years ago.)\n\n“I’m not really into being a rock star,” Ford says. “I really f---ing hate the bull----. And it’s getting harder and harder to deal with, the older I get. I’d much rather be quieter and do my own thing”.\n\nIn 2005, Ford wasn’t entirely done with B.S. though. He reunited with the Crowes for a memorable tour before later departing that band for a second time, saying in a press release it was to protect his sobriety. After the Crowes themselves splintered (again) in 2015 due to a financial split between singer Chris Robinson and guitarist Rich Robinson, Ford joined up with Rich in Magpie Salute, whose members also included latter day Crowes bassist Sven Pipien. Magpie did some good tunes and live shows but failed to connect in a big way with fans.\n\nIn late 2019, Rich and Chris announced a Crowes “reunion” tour backed by all new members. Apparently, Ford was not only left out of the Crowes tour, but his understanding was Magpie was still a thing … until Rich changed his phone number, according to Ford’s 2020 interview with jam-band magazine Relix. The pandemic paused plans for the Crowes tour and by the time the trek started, the brothers had brought back Pipien but no other alums. For more than a few fans though, a Black Crowes album or tour sans Ford simply doesn’t even exist.\n\nAlthough guitar playing will always be Ford’s superpower, he’s also built himself a solid catalog as a solo artist. As a singer, his voice can be reminiscent of country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons. The music often sounds born from vintage Neil Young or Ford’s lifelong muse, Hendrix.\n\nFord’s released at least six solo albums, including 2021 concert LP “Live in Germany,” which unlike many live albums contains no studio fixes. Ford also mixed the record himself, aiming for sonics that sounded how he hears things onstage.\n\n“It’s not going to win any awards, but I think it got the point across,” Ford says of the live album. “My preference when I make music is to not hide things, and to leave things raw and the way that they went down.”\n\nIn February, Apple Music featured Ford solo track “The Same Coming Up” on the streaming service’s “Southern Rock Essentials” playlist. It’s amusing a California musician is filed under Southern rock. But the Dylan-esque track is lyrically clever, musically infectious and worthy of being lifted up. “That was one of those fluke songs that just popped up on an acoustic guitar,” Ford says. “The chords sounded cool together and some words came out pretty quickly, and people seem to dig it.”\n\nFord’s doing his current tour opening for Allman Betts Band in power-trio mode, with backing from drummer Phil Jones and bassist Berry Oakley Jr., son of late Allman Brothers bassist Berry Oakley. Oakley Jr. is also bassist in Allman Betts Band, which is fronted by singer/guitarists Devon Allman and Duane Betts, the sons of Allman Brothers legends Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts, respectively. Ford’s another connection to Allman Betts Band’s golden lineage. Back in the day, he toured with the Allman Brothers.\n\n“It was an amazing learning experience to get to open up for those guys in the ‘90s. We were in school every day,” Ford says. “And it’s interesting because now Duane (Betts) has got the same three main guitars that Dickey had when we were opening for the Allman Brothers. But it’s cool to see them carry on the legacy of what their dads did, because they did create a type of music almost, and their songs are so beautiful. And they do it well and they’ve got their own great songs so it’s nice to see that it’s gonna continue.”\n\nIn case you’re wondering about that lone guitar Ford’s bringing along on this tour, it’s an Asher gold-top. His amp’s a 40-watt Bad Cat combo and pedals include a wah-wah, delay and his own signature overdrive by BMF.\n\nAs to the power-trio format, a configuration also favored by heroes Jimi and SRV, Ford says, “It’s immediate. And it’s bare bounds and there’s no place to hide. Three people can move a lot quicker than five, and so the conversation is way more heated and one on one, rather than sort of moving in a big communal thing. You’re free to make a left turn in the middle of nowhere.”\n\nIn 2020, Ford’s solo tracks generated more than 228,000 streams on Spotify. Sure, those aren’t Ariana Grande or The Weeknd type numbers. But over the last 30 years, Ford’s impressive guitar work and un-glitzy vibe have earned him a devout if cult following.\n\nNow in his mid-50s, Ford would still be a major “get” for many legacy bands to add to their lineup. It feels like with the right collaborators he could make another musical statement that reaches a large audience. “I’m open to anybody who’s doing anything that’s cool and exciting,” Ford says. “I could care less if you’ve made great records or not, honestly, because I met plenty of my heroes and wish that I hadn’t.” He laughs and then adds, “One thing I’d like to do is make money at this. Like finally one day, one of these things is gonna pay off. But until then, I carry on.”\n\nMarc Ford will play a set as part of a 7:30 p.m. Sept. 30 show headlined by Allman Betts Band at Mars Music Hall, 700 Monroe St., in Huntsville.
