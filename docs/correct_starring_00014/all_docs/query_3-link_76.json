        "text": "Parallels between the two scoundrels abound; Letterboxd member Hunter writes, “Between this and Paddington 2 I’ve decided that Hugh Grant should be the villain of every movie from now on,” and Emma concurs, “Hugh Grant is never going to leave his role as Phoenix Buchanan behind and I don’t think he should have to.” Yet when I bring these similarities up with Grant ahead of the Dungeons & Dragons LA premiere, he admits to me, “You know, I really never made that comparison when I was preparing for this role, which shows how blind I am.”\n\nGrant continues: “Obviously, they're both narcissists. That would be the big parallel. They both like clothes very, very much indeed. I would say they both had very complicated relationships with their mothers.”\n\nAccording to Grant, he tends to create elaborate backstories for each of his characters, and Forge and Phoenix were no exception. Although he acknowledges that we never learn anything about Phoenix’s mother in Paddington 2, he “always imagined that she had been a failed actress who had an affair with a very famous actor. I was conceived in the Phoenix Theatre in the West End of London, and that's why I'm called Phoenix. Then she brought me up and pushed me forward to be a star, so I was a stage child with a pushy stage mother.”\n\nIn Dungeons & Dragons, however, we do glean a bit of insight about Forge’s mother, whom Grant describes as similar to Phoenix’s, in the sense that they were both “very difficult.” Elaborating, he says, “I think that she conceived him with an aristocrat, and then she got smallpox and lost her looks. She got all those spots, you know, and couldn't get rid of them, and he dumped her. She brought me up to have the manners of an aristocrat, and that's been the source of my success as a con man.”\n\nIt seems Grant’s pattern of playing naughty will continue: the recently released Guy Ritchie action-comedy Operation Fortune: Ruse De Guerre finds him as a sleazy billionaire arms broker, and his next role will be in Jerry Seinfeld’s directorial debut Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story, the plot of which is described as \"a tale of ambition, betrayal, sugar and menacing milkmen.\" Crossing our marmalade-coated bear paws that this string of villainous roles may lead to Phoenix rising from the ashes for the much-awaited Paddington 3."
