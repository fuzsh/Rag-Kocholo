        "text": "For 20 years, the annual re-watching of Love Actually has become a sacred Christmas tradition.\n\nEvery year, we watch Hugh Grant dancing through the halls of 10 Downing Street, Andrew Lincoln professing his love to Keira Knightley on her doorstep, and Alan Rickman breaking Emma Thompson's heart.\n\nSince the romantic comedy was released in 2003, many of the film's cast members have gone on to have incredibly illustrious careers.\n\nBut what happened to the lesser-known cast members of Love Actually?\n\nFrom the staffer at 10 Downing Street who caught the attention of the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) to Jamie's (Colin Firth) love interest, here's where they are now.\n\nWatch the trailer for Love Actually below. Post continues after video.\n\nVideo via Universal Pictures.\n\nThomas Brodie-Sangster (Sam).\n\nThomas Brodie-Sangster, who played the sweet, innocent Sam in Love Actually, is now 33 years old.\n\nThe actor was just 13 years old when the romantic comedy premiered in 2003.\n\nIn 2013, a decade after the film premiered, Brodie-Sangster played a 13-year-old once again on Game of Thrones, starring as Jojen Reed. In more recent years, he has appeared in Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens, The Maze Runner franchise, and the animated series Thunderbirds Are Go and Phineas and Ferb.\n\nIn 2020, the world fell in love with him all over again in Netflix's hit series, The Queen's Gambit.\n\nThis week in an interesting turn of events, Brodie-Sangster has announced he is engaged - to Elon Musk's ex-wife.\n\nBrodie-Sangster and Talulah Riley shared on Instagram a picture of them on a boat where he proposed, with the caption: \"Happy to announce that Talulah and I are engaged. Love is all around.\"\n\nAnd you've got to admire that Love Actually reference in the engagement announcement.\n\nRiley, who appeared alongside her new fianc√© in last year's Pistol series, was previously married to Twitter boss and Tesla's Elon Musk, whom she married and divorced twice.\n\nOlivia Olson (Joanna Anderson).\n\nOlivia Olson played Sam's crush in Love Actually, Joanna Anderson.\n\nAfter appearing in Love Actually together, both Brodie-Sangster and Olson have voiced characters in Phineas and Ferb. As for her other roles, Olson has voiced characters in Adventure Time, The Powderpuff Girls, and Fast & Furious Spy Racers.\n\nOutside of her voice acting work, the 31-year-old released her debut solo album, Nowhere Land, in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, she competed in The X Factor: Celebrity, before becoming the second act to be evicted from the live shows. It was an emotional elimination, leading Olson to later explain her reaction on Instagram.\n\n\"I was confused why Simon [Cowell] would tell me I could win this competition and then ultimately send me home. It was a punch in the gut. People have emotions and mine got the best of me... because I REALLY wanted this,\" she wrote. \"I'm proud of my performance last night and that's what matters to me.\"\n\nReflecting on Love Actually, she said to The Morning Show last year that she has fond memories from filming.\n\n\"I think people still imagine me as that little girl, so I don't get recognised often. 20 years of the same movie - some people watch it religiously, and I definitely know my mum watches it every year to be nostalgic.\"\n\nOutside of acting, McCutcheon has released four studio albums, with her song 'Perfect Moment' scoring a number one on the UK Singles Chart in 1999.\n\nAs for her personal life, the actress married singer Jake McManus in 2012, before welcoming their son, Rafferty, in 2015. After having her first child, McCutcheon opened up about her struggles with ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis), a chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\n\"You're pushed to your limits too much. You feel like you're really hungover, like you've been beaten up by Mike Tyson. I was getting lots of infections and my immune system was down,\" she shared on Loose Women. \"I've just had to pace myself and realise what matters. At one point for about a week, I was in a wheelchair. I didn't trust myself.\"\n\nJust before her 45th birthday, the actress told The Sun she feels more confident now.\n\n\"I'm feeling so much more fulfilled, confident and sexy than I ever did in my twenties,\" she said.\n\n\"What's amazing is looking at people like Jennifer Lopez and Helen Mirren, who are ageing and yet their careers are still going strong. They've got this inner glow. People always thought I was really confident, but it was a good act. Genuine confidence took time for me.\"\n\nRodrigo Santoro (Karl).\n\nRodrigo Santoro played Karl, the chief designer at a company who went home with Sarah (Laura Linney) after a Christmas party.\n\nPrior to Love Actually, Santoro appeared in several Brazilian movies as well as the Hollywood film, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.\n\nThese days, Santoro is best known for his role as the villain Xerxes in 300, Jesus in Ben Hur, and starring in Focus alongside Will Smith and Margot Robbie. In the past four years, the 47-year-old has starred in Westworld as Hector Escaton.\n\nOh, and did we mention that he's still ridiculously good-looking? But for those keen to see if he's single - he is married and has a child.\n\nKris Marshall (Colin Frissell).\n\nKris Marshall appeared in Love Actually as Colin Frissell, the movie's... grossest character. (Remember that nose-picking scene?)\n\nIn the film, Colin travels to the United States after struggling to meet women in England. And It totally worked, too.\n\nSince Love Actually, the 48-year-old has appeared on numerous TV shows, including Death at a Funeral, My Family, Citizen Khan, and Death in Paradise.\n\nThe actor made headlines in 2011 after he was found asleep behind the wheel of his car in a supermarket car park, leading him to be disqualified from driving for six months.\n\nIn recent years he returned to TV in a spin-off for Death in Paradise."
