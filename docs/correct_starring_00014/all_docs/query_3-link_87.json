        "text": "(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nHugh Grant has enjoyed a real renaissance in recent years thanks to his brilliant performances in Paddington 2, A Very English Scandal, and The Undoing. However, this doesn't mean he can't look back on his early career with brutal honesty.\n\nDuring an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden, Grant was asked a pointed question: \"You can erase one movie from your IMDb page, what would it be?\" To his credit, Grant didn't shirk the question, but he did preface his answer by pointing out that he wouldn't want to \"bring down the rest of the wonderful colleagues who worked with me on any film by saying it was bad.\"\n\nHe then named The Lady and the Highwayman, a 1989 British TV movie in which he played a swashbuckling highwayman called Silver Blade who falls in love with the aristocratic Lady Panthea Vyne (Lysette Anthony). Whatever the film's faults, it definitely has a fine cast, with Grant starring opposite Oliver Reed, Sir John Mills, and Michael York.\n\n“I’m meant to be sexy,” he said, before adding drolly: \"Low-budget, bad wig, bad hat. I look like Deputy Dawg.\"\n\nGrant's latest role comes in Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, which opens in theaters today (March 31). You can relive a typically self-deprecating moment from the actor on The Graham Norton Show below."
