        "text": "The classic film, whose all-star cast includes Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, Bill Nighy and Martine McCutcheon, was first released all the way back in 2003.\n\nNow, 20 years later, McCutcheon has teased some huge news for fans who still can’t get enough of the rom-com.\n\nTaking to Instagram on Tuesday, McCutcheon revealed to fans that she has been secretly filming something “big” in relation to the movie after creator Richard Curtis told her he had something in the works.\n\n“I have just been filming something for the delightful Richard Curtis,” said the actress. “He is doing something which is going to be celebrating Love Actually big time.”\n\n“He asked me to be involved and I was very honoured and flattered and I of course said I would. I wish I could have done more than I have Richard, but I think it’s going to be a really lovely, feel good thing to go and enjoy.”\n\nMcCutcheon went on to share in the caption to her video that she remains forever grateful for being able to have been a part of such a genre-defining film.\n\n“For me, being a part of such a huge project that explored so many different kinds of love was the ultimate dream,” she wrote. “For me it’s what life is truly all about. So career wise there is nothing that would or could match it. The message of Love Actually has reached so many and continues to touch new generations.”\n\nThe romantic comedy, which intertwines the stories of eight couples during a frantic month before Christmas in London, also features Laura Linney, Martin Freeman, Andrew Lincoln, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Rodrigo Santoro, Rowan Atkinson, Billy Bob Thornton and the late Alan Rickman.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this year, Love Actually director Curtis apologised for labelling characters such as McCutcheon’s character in the film as chubby while being interviewed by his daughter Scarlett.\n\nThe British screenwriter acknowledged that jokes about women’s weight “aren’t any longer funny”, and also slammed the lack of non-white representation in his films such as Notting Hill."
