        "text": "Love Actually is a 2003 Christmas-themed romantic comedy film written and directed by Richard Curtis. It features an ensemble cast, composed predominantly of British actors, many of whom had worked with Curtis in previous film and television projects. Mostly filmed on location in London, the screenplay delves into different aspects of love as shown through ten separate stories involving a wide variety of individuals, many of whom are shown to be interlinked as the tales progress. The story begins five weeks before Christmas and is played out iŋŋn a weekly countdown until the holiday, followed by an epilogue that takes place one month later.\n\nAn international co-production between the United Kingdom, the United States and France, the film was released in the United States on 14 November 2003 and a week later in the United Kingdom, to generally mixed reviews. Love Actually was a box-office success, grossing $246 million worldwide on a budget of $40–45 million. It received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. Frequently shown during the Christmas season, the film has proved more popular with audiences than critics, and it has been discussed as being arguably a modern-day Christmas staple.\n\nStoryline[]\n\nPlot[]\n\nNine intertwined stories examine the complexities of the one emotion that connects us all: love. Among the characters explored are David (Hugh Grant), the handsome newly elected British prime minister who falls for a young junior staffer (Martine McCutcheon), Sarah (Laura Linney), a graphic designer whose devotion to her mentally ill brother complicates her love life, and Harry (Alan Rickman), a married man tempted by his attractive new secretary.\n\nGenres[]\n\nRomance\n\nComedy\n\nDrama\n\nMotion Picture Rating[]\n\n13 (Argentina)\n\nM (Australia)\n\n14 (Brazil)\n\n14A (Canada) (Alberta/British Columbia/Manitoba/Ontario, Canadian Home Video rating)\n\n14 (Canada) (Nova Scotia)\n\nA (Denmark)\n\nK-11 (Finland)\n\nTous publics (France)\n\n6 (Germany) (bw)\n\nIII (Hong Kong) (DVD rating)\n\nIIA (Hong Kong) (original rating)\n\nL (Iceland)\n\nUA (India) (re-rating)\n\nA (India) (2003, original rating)\n\n15 (Ireland)\n\nT (Italy)\n\nPG-12 (Japan)\n\n18SX (Malaysia)\n\nPG-13 (Mexico) (DVD rating)\n\nAL (Netherlands)\n\nM (New Zealand)\n\nA (Norway) (2017, cinema rating)\n\n11 (Norway) (2003, cinema rating)\n\n14 (Peru)\n\nR-18 (Philippines)\n\nM/12 (Portugal)\n\n16+ (Russia)\n\nR(A) (Singapore)\n\nPG (Singapore) (video rating, cut)\n\nM18 (Singapore) (re-rating, video rating)\n\n15 (South Korea) (Asian edition, DVD rating)\n\n18 (South Korea) (2013)\n\nA (Spain)\n\n13 (Spain) (Netflix)\n\n7 (Sweden)\n\n15 (United Kingdom)\n\nImages[]\n\nCast and Crew[]\n\nDirector[]\n\nRichard Curtis\n\nWriting Credits (WGA)[]\n\nRichard Curtis\n\nCast[]\n\nAlan Rickman as Harry\n\nEmma Thompson as Karen\n\nHugh Grant as David\n\nKeira Knightley as Juliet\n\nColin Firth as Jamie\n\nSienna Guillory as Jamie's Girlfriend\n\nLúcia Moniz as Aurélia\n\nLiam Neeson as Daniel\n\nThomas Sangster as Sam\n\nBill Nighy as Billy Mack\n\nGregor Fisher as Joe\n\nMartine McCutcheon as Natalie\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor as Peter\n\nAndrew Lincoln as Mark\n\nLaura Linney as Sarah\n\nRodrigo Santoro as Karl\n\nMichael Fitzgerald as Michael\n\nKris Marshall as Colin\n\nAbdul Salis as Tony\n\nHeike Makatsch as Mia\n\nMartin Freeman as John\n\nJoanna Page as Judy\n\nOlivia Olson as Joanna\n\nBilly Bob Thornton as U.S. President\n\nRowan Atkinson as Rufus\n\nClaudia Schiffer as Carol\n\nNina Sosanya as Annie\n\nIvana Miličević as Stacey\n\nJanuary Jones as Jeannie\n\nElisha Cuthbert as Carol-Anne\n\nShannon Elizabeth as Harriet\n\nDenise Richards as Carla\n\nLulu Popplewell as Daisy\n\nMarcus Brigstocke as Mikey\n\nJulia Davis as Nancy\n\nRuby Turner as Jean\n\nAdam Godley as Mr. Trench\n\nÉlisabeth Margoni as Eleonore\n\nMeg Wynn Owen as Mary, PM's secretary\n\nProducers[]\n\nDuncan Kenworthy\n\nTim Bevan\n\nEric Fellner\n\nDebra Hayward (co-producer)\n\nLiza Chasin (co-producer)\n\nDetails[]\n\nCountry[]\n\nUSA\n\nUK\n\nLanguage[]\n\nEnglish\n\n[]\n\nNovember 14, 2003 (Italy)\n\nNovember 14, 2003 (Portugal)\n\nNovember 14, 2003 (United States)\n\nNovember 20, 2003 (Switzerland) (German speaking region)\n\nNovember 20, 2003 (Czech Republic)\n\nNovember 20, 2003 (Germany)\n\nNovember 20, 2003 (Israel)\n\nNovember 20, 2003 (Netherlands)\n\nNovember 21, 2003 (Austria)\n\nNovember 21, 2003 (Denmark)\n\nNovember 21, 2003 (Spain)\n\nNovember 21, 2003 (Finland)\n\nNovember 21, 2003 (United Kingdom)\n\nNovember 21, 2003 (Greece)\n\nNovember 21, 2003 (Ireland)\n\nNovember 21, 2003 (Poland)\n\nNovember 21, 2003 (Sweden)\n\nNovember 21, 2003 (South Africa)\n\nNovember 27, 2003 (New Zealand)\n\nNovember 28, 2003 (South Korea)\n\nNovember 28, 2003 (Norway)\n\nDecember 3, 2003 (Belgium)\n\nDecember 3, 2003 (Switzerland) (French speaking region)\n\nDecember 3, 2003 (France)\n\nDecember 4, 2003 (Hong Kong)\n\nDecember 4, 2003 (Hungary)\n\nDecember 5, 2003 (Brazil)\n\nDecember 5, 2003 (Iceland)\n\nDecember 5, 2003 (Mexico)\n\nDecember 5, 2003 (Singapore)\n\nDecember 5, 2003 (Thailand)\n\nDecember 11, 2003 (Argentina)\n\nDecember 11, 2003 (Russia)\n\nDecember 19, 2003 (Colombia)\n\nDecember 19, 2003 (Panama)\n\nDecember 26, 2003 (Australia)\n\nJanuary 16, 2004 (Romania)\n\nJanuary 23, 2004 (Turkey)\n\nFebruary 1, 2004 (Bahrain)\n\nFebruary 6, 2004 (Peru)\n\nFebruary 7, 2004 (Japan)\n\nFebruary 13, 2004 (Estonia)\n\nFebruary 13, 2004 (Taiwan)\n\nFebruary 20, 2004 (Chile)\n\nMarch 12, 2004 (Venezuela)\n\nMarch 19, 2004 (United Arab Emirates)\n\nApril 14, 2004 (Egypt)\n\nApril 17, 2004 (Indonesia)\n\n[]\n\nMarch 26, 2004 (UK) (VHS)\n\nMarch 26, 2004 (UK) (DVD)\n\nApril 27, 2004 (US) (VHS)\n\nApril 27, 2004 (US) (DVD)\n\nProduction[]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nInitially, Curtis started writing with two distinct and separate films in mind, each featuring expanded versions of what would eventually become storylines in Love Actually - those featuring Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. He changed tack, however, having become frustrated with the process. Partly inspired by the films of Robert Altman as well as films such as Pulp Fiction, and inspired by the fact that Curtis had become \"more interested in writing a film about love and what love sort of means\" he had the idea of creating an ensemble film. The film initially did not have any sort of Christmas theme, although Curtis's penchant for such movies eventually caused him to write it as one.\n\nCurtis's original concept for the film included 14 different scenarios, but four of them were cut (two having been filmed). The scene in which Colin attempts to chat up the female caterer at the wedding appeared in drafts of the screenplay for Four Weddings and a Funeral, but was cut from the final version. The music video for Billy Mack's song, \"Christmas Is All Around\", is a tribute to Robert Palmer's video, \"Addicted to Love\". Curtis has spoken negatively about the editing process for the film, which he labelled in 2014 as a \"catastrophe\" and \"The only nightmare scenario that I've been caught in\". The film was rushed in order to be ready for the 2003 Christmas season which he likened to \"three-dimensional chess\".\n\nCasting[]\n\nAnt and Dec played themselves in the film with Bill Nighy's character referring to Dec as \"Ant or Dec\". This refers to the common mistaking of one for the other, owing to their constant joint professional presence as a comedy and presenting duo. The veteran actress Jeanne Moreau is seen briefly, entering a taxi at the Marseille Airport. The soul singer Ruby Turner appears as Joanna Anderson's mother, one of the backing singers at the school Christmas pageant.\n\nCurtis cast his daughter Scarlett in the film; she was given the choice of being an angel or a lobster, and played the part of Lobster number 2 in the nativity play, on the condition that she met Keira Knightley.\n\nLocations[]\n\nMost of the film was made on location in London, including Trafalgar Square, the central court of Somerset House in the Strand, Grosvenor Chapel on South Audley Street near Hyde Park, St Paul's Church, Clapham, the Millennium Bridge, Selfridges department store on Oxford Street, Lambeth Bridge, the Tate Modern in the former Bankside Power Station, Canary Wharf, Marble Arch, the St. Lukes Mews off All Saint's Road in Notting Hill, Chelsea Bridge, the OXO Tower, London City Hall, Poplar Road in Herne Hill, Elliott School in Pullman Gardens, Putney, Heathrow Airport and the Marseille Airport. Scenes set in 10 Downing Street were filmed at the Shepperton Studios.\n\nStanding up to the US President[]\n\nFollowing Tony Blair's resignation as Prime Minister, pundits and speculators commented on a potential anti-American shift in Gordon Brown's cabinet as a \"Love Actually moment\", referring to the scene in which Hugh Grant's character stands up to the US President. In 2009, during President Barack Obama's first visit to the UK, Chris Matthews referred to the president in Love Actually as an example of George W. Bush and other former presidents' bullying of European allies. Commenting on this, Mediaite's Jon Bershad described the U.S. president character as a \"sleazy Bill Clinton/George W. Bush hybrid\". In the scene in question, the swaggering president bullies the prime minister and then sexually harasses a member of the household staff. In September 2013, David Cameron made a speech in reply to Russia's comment that Britain was a small insignificant country, which drew comparisons with Hugh Grant's speech during the film.\n\nCompany Credits[]\n\nProduction Companies[]\n\nUniversal Pictures (presents)\n\nStudioCanal (presents) (as StudioCanal)\n\nWorking Title Films (as Working Title)\n\nDNA Films (in association with)\n\nDistributors[]\n\nUniversal Pictures (2003) (USA) (theatrical) (as Universal)\n\nFilmes Lusomundo (2003) (Portugal) (theatrical)\n\nMars Distribution (2003) (France) (theatrical)\n\nParamount Films of India (2003) (India) (theatrical)\n\nStudioCanal (2003) (France) (theatrical)\n\nUnited International Pictures (UIP) (2003) (Argentina) (theatrical)\n\nUnited International Pictures (UIP) (2003) (Switzerland) (theatrical)\n\nUnited International Pictures (UIP) (2003) (Germany) (theatrical)\n\nUnited International Pictures (UIP) (2003) (Spain) (theatrical)\n\nUnited International Pictures (UIP) (2003) (UK) (theatrical)\n\nUnited International Pictures (UIP) (2003) (Greece) (theatrical)\n\nUnited International Pictures (UIP) (2003) (Italy) (theatrical)\n\nUnited International Pictures (UIP) (2004) (Japan) (theatrical)\n\nUnited International Pictures (UIP) (2003) (Netherlands) (theatrical)\n\nUnited International Pictures (UIP) (2003) (Singapore) (theatrical)\n\nArgentina Video Home (2004) (Argentina) (DVD)\n\nArgentina Video Home (2004) (Argentina) (VHS)\n\nCanale 5 (2016) (Italy) (TV)\n\nCinema Foobio (2004) (Japan) (video) (VOD)\n\nHBO Max (2020) (USA) (video) (VOD)\n\nLeader Music (2011) (Argentina) (DVD) (as Leader Vision)\n\nNet5 (2016) (Netherlands) (TV)\n\nNine Network Australia (2019-) (Australia) (TV)\n\nPlus Video (2008) (Argentina) (DVD)\n\nRTL Entertainment (2006) (Netherlands) (TV) (RTL5)\n\nUniversal Home Video (2004) (Brazil) (DVD)\n\nUniversal Home Video (2004) (Brazil) (VHS)\n\nUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment (UPHE) (2009) (USA) (Blu-ray) (DVD)\n\nUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment (2004) (Germany) (DVD)\n\nUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment (2009) (Germany) (Blu-ray) (DVD)\n\nUniversal Pictures Spain (2004) (Spain) (DVD)\n\nUniversal Pictures Video (2004) (Netherlands) (DVD) (VHS)\n\nUniversal Pictures (2004) (Germany) (DVD)\n\nUniversal Pictures (2004) (Netherlands) (DVD) (VHS)\n\nUniversal Pictures (2009) (Germany) (Blu-ray) (DVD)\n\nUniversal Studios Home Video (2004) (Canada) (DVD)\n\nVideosonic (2004) (Greece) (DVD)\n\nSpecial Effects[]\n\nFramestore CFC (visual effects by) (as Framestore CFC London)\n\nSnow Business International (snow effects) (uncredited)\n\nOther Companies[]\n\nShepperton Studios (movie studio)\n\n20th Century Theatre (with thanks to)\n\nAON/Albert G.

Writer and director Richard Curtis had a team of cameramen film at Heathrow airport for a week, and whenever they saw something that would fit in they asked the people involved for permission to use the footage.\n\nThe lake in which Lúcia Moniz and Colin Firth are \"swimming\" was actually only eighteen inches deep and they had to kneel down and pretend to be in deeper water. It was also over-run by mosquitoes, and Colin Firth was badly bitten, and his elbow swelled up to the size of an avocado, requiring medical attention.\n\nKris Marshall returned his paycheck for the scene where the three American girls undress him. He said he had such a great time having three girls undress him for twenty-one takes that he was willing to do it for free, and thus returned his check for that.\n\nThe idea for Mark's (Andrew Lincoln's) surprise of the band singing \"All You Need Is Love\" at Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Juliet's (Keira Knightley's) wedding came from Jim Henson's funeral (which writer and director Richard Curtis attended) where all of the puppeteers brought their Muppets and sang a song.\n\nA speech given by Hugh Grant in this movie (where he extols the virtues of Great Britain and refuses to cave to the pressure of its longstanding ally, the United States) was etched in the transatlantic memory as a satirical, wishful statement on the concurrent relationship with George W. Bush. Tony Blair responded by saying in 2005, \"I know there's a bit of us that would like me to do a Hugh Grant in Love Actually (2003) and tell America where to get off. But the difference between a good film and real life is that in real life there's the next day, the next year, the next lifetime to contemplate the ruinous consequences of easy applause.\"\n\nLaura Linney said she wished that her character didn't pick up the phone while Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) was in her apartment.\n\nBilly Mack (Bill Nighy) and his manager Joe (Gregor Fisher) are the only characters in this movie whose storyline doesn't directly connect to any of the others. All of the other main characters are linked via family, friendship, or work.\n\nThe credits at the end of this movie incorrectly list Tessa Niles as the performer in the Christmas concert scene. Joanna, Sam's crush, does all of her own singing in \"All I Want for Christmas is You\" at the Christmas concert. She had such an amazing voice that writer and director Richard Curtis had it edited so it sounded more like a child singing.\n\nLúcia Moniz (Aurelia) got the part as a result of a joke by a friend of hers, who is a casting director, and sent her photos to this movie's casting director. Lúcia went to the casting and ended up being chosen.\n\nAndrew Lincoln (Mark) wrote the romantic cards. In 2013, Andrew reminisced about his climactic gesture in this movie with Entertainment Weekly, and revealed, \"It is my handwriting. It's funny, because the art department did it, and then I said, 'Well, can I do it?' because I like to think that my handwriting is really good. Actually, it ended up with me having to sort of trace over the art department's, so it is my handwriting, but with a sort of pencil stencil underneath.\"\n\nAccording to writer and director Richard Curtis, they had to put Dame Emma Thompson in a \"fat suit\" to make her appear heavier because she is actually a thin woman.\n\nKnowing about Billy Bob Thornton's quite unusual fear of antique furniture, Hugh Grant would sometimes flash a piece of antique (which is abundant in England) in front of Thornton just before the cameras rolled, and watch him freak out in amusement.\n\nThomas Brodie-Sangster didn't know how to play the drums when he was cast. Fortunately for him, his father, Mark Sangster, plays the drums and taught Thomas how to play them.\n\nRufus - Jewellery Salesman (Rowan Atkinson) was initially supposed to be an angel, and disappeared as he walked away from Daniel (Liam Neeson) in the airport scene.\n\nDespite their differences in looks, Keira Knightley (Juliet) is only five years older than Thomas Brodie-Sangster (Sam) in real life.\n\nThe scene where Colin (Kris Marshall) accidentally insults the caterer's food to her face was originally written as a scene for Hugh Grant's character in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), but was cut from that movie.\n\nThomas Brodie-Sangster, who was thirteen years old when he played Sam in this movie, was cast as a thirteen-year-old again eight years later. Brodie-Sangster started playing the young teen Jojen Reed on Game of Thrones (2011 TV Series) in 2013, when he was twenty-three.\n\nWhen Daniel says \"We need Kate and we need Leo and we need them now\", a toothpick can be seen in Daniel's left hand as he says \"now\". Later, Sam has a toothpick in his mouth while he and Daniel are lounging on a couch. What Richard Curtis describes as \"this toothpick business\" was a result of Liam Neeson never being without a toothpick after he gave up smoking.\n\nIn the version edited and broadcast in the U.S. on the ABC Family Channel, the entire subplot of John and Just Judy (the characters in the ersatz \"porn\" movie) was completely edited out, and, even with those and other cuts, this movie ran three hours with commercials.\n\nLaura Linney filmed this movie in London, England, while she was working on Mystic River (2003) in Boston, Massachusetts. She flew across the Atlantic Ocean several times within few months, in order to complete her work on both movies.\n\nAndrew Lincoln was initially unsure about his character, as he thought the scene with handwritten signs was \"borderline stalker territory\".\n\nHugh Grant hated the dancing scene, because he didn't think a Prime Minister would do something like that.\n\n10 Downing Street in this movie is not, of course, the actual Prime Minister's residence, but a replica. The exterior was created in the Shepperton Studios car park and the interior is a set. In preparation for this movie, Richard Curtis and production designer Jim Clay were escorted on a two-hour tour of the actual Number 10 by Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown (Prime Minister June 2007 to May 2010). They were not permitted to take photographs or make sketches of the interiors, and throughout the entire tour they were flanked by security. The \"Number 10\" that appears in the movie was designed by Clay, solely from memory.\n\nThis was the most rented DVD in the U.K. in 2004.\n\nThomas Brodie-Sangster is the second cousin once removed of Hugh Grant.\n\nWriter and director Richard Curtis, and other members of the production, had a forty-five minute meeting to determine what color underwear Aurelia (Lúcia Moniz) would wear for the lake scene.\n\nWriter and director Richard Curtis was originally working on two movies, one about Prime Minister David (Hugh Grant), and the other about Jamie (Colin Firth). When the plots turned out to be so similar, he merged them into a single movie.\n\nWhen Juliet (Keira Knightley) visits Mark (Andrew Lincoln) in his flat to view the footage he shot on her wedding day, a video copy of Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954) can be seen. One of the main themes in Rear Window (1954) is voyeurism or watching something or someone, and as we see that is exactly what Mark was doing to Juliet without her knowledge.\n\nThe dolls that Dame Emma Thompson holds up are Ken dolls dressed in drag. Richard Curtis just asked the prop people to take Ken and put him in dresses. Thompson had such a difficult time with the scene, saying she just could not lift the dolls knowing that they were Ken in drag, but in the end she gave in and shot the scene.\n\nWith the exception of Sam's running through the airport scenes, and the footage of people greeting each other, all airport scenes were filmed on a built set, which cost most of the budget for the movie. Some of these scenes include Colin Frissell (Kris Marshall) leaving for, and arriving in Wisconsin, and Sam (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) shouting at Joanna Anderson (Olivia Olson) through the glass, and all footage of the actors and actresses at the airport.\n\nFor her one-minute cameo, Claudia Schiffer received a reported £200,000 (roughly $300,000 U.S.).\n\nThe video for Billy Mack's (Bill Nighy's) \"Christmas is All Around\" single is a reference to a series of memorable, and very popular, videos that Robert Palmer had done - \"Addicted to Love\", \"Simply Irresistible\", and \"I Didn't Mean to Turn You On\" - in which Palmer sang in a good suit, backed up by an all-female band, all dressed alike, and dancing in a back-and-forth manner.\n\nOlivia Olson (Joanna Anderson) went on to play another love interest of Thomas Brodie-Sangster (Sam) on the television show Phineas and Ferb (2007), where Brodie-Sangster was the voice of Ferb and Olson was the voice of Vanessa.\n\nIn a 2017 interview published in Empire Magazine, writer and director Richard Curtis recounts that Universal Pictures chairman Stacey Snider told him that this movie would make $50 million less at the box office if he kept all of the nude scenes in. But Curtis felt that as a teenager, he only went to the movies to see some nudity, and he didn't want to let his younger self down.\n\nDirectorial debut of Richard Curtis.\n\nIn 2017, a handful of the main cast members re-united for a one off special for Comic Relief. Aired on the BBC in March 2017. The sketch lasted ten minutes and followed-up on some of the cast members and their lives in 2017. One highlight was Hugh Grant dancing to Drake's Hotline Bling.\n\nThe word \"actually\" is spoken twenty-two times by various characters throughout this movie.\n\nRichard Curtis wanted Michael Parkinson to appear as a talk show host, and Michael accepted without hesitation.\n\nWhen Prime Minister David (Hugh Grant) addresses his speech to the press, after the meeting with the President of the United States (Billy Bob Thornton), he talks about the great things about Britain and candidly mentions \"Harry Potter\". Grant was set to appear as Gilderoy Lockhart in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), but left that movie due to scheduling conflicts. Harry Potter co-stars Dame Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy, and Frances de la Tour appeared in this movie, although the latter is seen only in deleted scenes.\n\nIn the scene after Sarah leaves Harry's office following their conversation about her feelings for co-worker Karl, two clocks can be seen on the wall, showing the time in New York City and Brazil. Laura Linney (Sarah) is from New York City, and Rodrigo Santoro (Karl) is from Brazil.\n\nThe vicar used for Peter and Juliet's wedding was a real vicar.\n\nAll four leading stars of Sense and Sensibility (1995), technically appeared in this movie, with Hugh Grant, Dame Emma Thompson, and Alan Rickman playing leading roles, and Kate Winslet appearing in stock footage of Titanic (1997).\n\nFor Brazilian movie posters, and VHS/DVD/Blu-ray covers, the image of Bill Nighy was replaced with one of Rodrigo Santoro.\n\nOn the DVD audio commentary, Richard Curtis said that the Mark's (Andrew Lincoln's) homemade video montage showing only close-ups of Juliet (Keira Knightley) from her wedding day was inspired by the end of the movie, Cinema Paradiso (1988), where the main character made a montage of all of the kissing scenes that had previously been censored out from all of the movies that were shown in the Cinema Paradiso.\n\nIn the scene where Juliet watches the wedding video for the first time, Keira Knightley had to wear a hat to cover a massive spot that had blossomed on her forehead the night prior to filming.\n\nThe school used for the Nativity concert at the end of this movie is Elliott School, Putney, South West London, England, and is where Pierce Brosnan went to school until he was fifteen.\n\nOne of the working titles was \"Love Actually is All Around\" taken from The Troggs' song \"Love is All Around\", written by Troggs lead singer Reg Presley. An alternate version by Wet Wet Wet, featured in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), was at number one on the U.K. charts for fifteen weeks in 1994, and Richard Curtis thought it would be amusing to start this movie with the same song that had driven everyone to distraction nine years earlier. For this movie, it was re-worked by Billy Mack (Bill Nighy), who turns it into a Christmas song. \"Christmas is All Around\", the resulting tacky joke theme song, was released in Britain in hopes that it would be \"Number 1 for Christmas 2003\".\n\nThe character Natalie was originally called Martine. It was changed to Natalie before Martine McCutcheon auditioned.\n\nIn Daniel's eulogy, he says that one of his wife's joking requests was to \"bring Claudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral.\" Claudia Schiffer played the mother of one of Sam's classmates, whom Daniel meets, and develops an interest in, near the end of this movie.\n\nThe Diane Warren penned track \"Too Lost in You\", performed by Sugababes, appeared in the U.K. version, but was replaced by Kelly Clarkson's \"The Trouble With Love\" in the U.S. release. Writer and director Richard Curtis felt bad for the members of the British band, Keisha Buchanan, Mutya Buena and Heidi Range, as they missed out on exposure in USA. To make up for it, he later placed them on the soundtrack for his movie About Time (2013). Heidi Range went on to name her daughter Aurelia, after the character in this movie.\n\nThe property surrounding the house, in which Jamie (Colin Firth) stays in France, including the dock that was specially built for this movie, were heavily damaged by fire during the 2003 heat wave, but the house survived.\n\nMia (Heike Makatsch) was originally going to be the girl that cheated on Jamie (Colin Firth) before Sienna Guillory was cast as his unnamed girlfriend.\n\nHugh Grant and Colin Firth were born one day apart. Grant on September 9, 1960 and Firth on September 10, 1960.\n\nAlthough Karen refers to David as her big brother, Dame Emma Thompson is one year older than Hugh Grant.\n\nWhen deciding to cast the part of Prime Minister David, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Michael Gambon, and Michael Crawford were possible candidates. But all three had been unavailable at the time of filming (Hopkins was working on The Human Stain (2003), Gambon on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) and Crawford had returned to Broadway to star in the American version of \"Dance of the Vampires\").\n\nOriginally, this movie had some small scenes that showed Sam (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) as being a brilliant gymnast. The ending where he rushes through the airport to see Joanna would involve a long chase where he dodges objects and people through a series of jumps and gymnastic moves. All allusions to Sam's physical talent were eventually removed, and the special effects-heavy end scene was cut back to what is seen in the movie.\n\nIn the scene in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a Budweiser is ordered, even though Milwaukee was the home to three of its major competitors: Miller, Pabst, and Schlitz.\n\nThe art gallery where Mark works was based on a real Southbank gallery called \"La Guff\". It specialized in arty, but rubbish black-and-white pictures of butts - some of which can be seen in this movie.\n\nFor German movie posters, and VHS/DVD/Blu-ray covers, the image of Martine McCutcheon was replaced with one of Heike Makatsch.\n\nSimon Pegg was considered for the role of Rufus.\n\nLynden David Hall appeared singing \"All You Need Is Love\" in the church.\n\nDIRECTOR CAMEO (Richard Curtis): As a trombone player.\n\nDame Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant played brother and sister in this movie. They previously played lovers in Sense and Sensibility (1995).\n\nA line from this movie was quoted by King Harald V of Norway in a speech made during a visit by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in February 2018.\n\nMost of Edward Hardwicke's role was removed from the final print.\n\nAndrew Lincoln has stated in interviews that looking back, his character Mark is creepy and inappropriate in his behavior, and that he wished they would have rewritten his scenes to make him appear more reasonable and normal about his feelings for Juliet.\n\nThe cast includes three Oscar winners: Colin Firth, Dame Emma Thompson, and Billy Bob Thornton; and four Oscar nominees: Liam Neeson, Kiera Knightly, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Laura Linney.\n\nEarly in the casting process, Richard Curtis expressed interest in casting an actual rock star for the role of Billy Mack, and considered David Bowie, Sting, Mick Jagger and Peter Gabriel for the role, but producers thought an actual rock star would make major demands to the script and music choices, so they convinced Curtis to cast an actor instead.\n\nOf the five \"American dream girls\" in this movie, only three were born in the U.S. Ivana Milicevic was born in Bosnia and later moved to the U.S., and Elisha Cuthbert is Canadian.\n\nDaniel (Liam Neeson) is a widower trying to get over the death of his wife. Neeson became a widower six years later after his wife, Natasha Richardson, died in a skiing accident.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, this movie went by the name \"Heavenly Love\" (a saying expressing \"The greatest love possible\").\n\n(At around twenty-seven minutes) Daniel owns a huge \"Launderette\" sign. Annie returns to Lisbon. (At around one hour and twenty minutes) Tony is shown living upstairs from a launderette with the identical \"Launderette\" sign, and a delicatessen called \"Lisboa\".\n\nThe filmmakers stated that Colin picks Milwaukee, a relatively small city in the more sparsely populated Midwest part of the United States, instead of somewhere more common like New York or California, because to foreigners, places like Milwaukee are seen as more \"exotic\" and to someone like Colin, who has a more offbeat way of looking at things, it would fit his persona to choose somewhere like Milwaukee.\n\nJoe Alwyn auditioned for the role of Sam, but lost out to Thomas Brodie-Sangster. It took him another thirteen years to land his first role in a movie.\n\nThe song \"Christmas is All Around\" is a reference to \"Love is All Around\", the song from Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), which also starred Hugh Grant.\n\nHugh Grant and Colin Firth appeared in Bridget Jones' Diary (2001) and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (2004).\n\nIn Russian-language markets, this movie's title is \"Realnaya lyubov\" (\"Real Love\").\n\nJo Whiley and Wes Butters appeared as cameo voices in the movie as disc jockeys, who were on Radio 1 at the time. Emma Freud worked as a Screenwriter for this movie, and was also a Radio 1 DJ in 1994.\n\nLaura Linney and Liam Neeson appeared in Kinsey (2004), The Big C (2010), and The Other Man (2008).\n\nThe last seconds of the movie, the screen is filled with more and more scenes, each smaller and smaller, of people reuniting with loved ones. In the last split second, they form a big \"heart\" (or \"valentine\").\n\nKaren (Dame Emma Thompson) and Harry (Alan Rickman) have a son call Bernard. In real life, this was the name of Alan Rickman's father, who died when he was just eight years old.\n\nWhenever Sarah (Laura Linney) talks to her brother on the phone (three different times), she says, \"Fire away.\"\n\nInitially, the scene with Colin returning to London Heathrow, he was to wear Green Bay Packers gear. However, the filmmakers were unable to secure permission from the National Football League, so this idea was dropped.\n\nGregor Fisher landed the role of Joe at the insistence of Emma Freud, Richard Curtis' wife. Apparently, after seeing with her kids, Gregor perform in the 2000 remake of 'The Railway Children', Emma liked him so much, she insisted that Richard cast him as Joe, and Richard, according to Gregor Fisher, did as he was told!.\n\nAn additional plot that was dropped in editing concerned the children's headmistress (Anne Reid) and her dying lesbian partner (Frances de la Tour).\n\nThomas Brodie-Sangster, Colin Firth, and Dame Emma Thompson appeared in Nanny McPhee (2005).\n\nKaren expresses surprise at the inclusion of (at least) two lobsters amongst the characters in her daughter's school Christmas pageant (\"there was more than one lobster present at the birth of Jesus?\"). Although there is a variety of small lobster (Palinurus elephas, also known as the common spiny lobster) native to the Mediterranean Sea, its habitat doesn't stretch as far east as the land that is now known as Israel. Furthermore, since Jesus' family was Jewish, and shellfish such as lobster is forbidden to devout Jews, who observe the rules for keeping Kosher, Karen is correct that it is highly unlikely that there was any lobster present at Jesus' birth.\n\nOne of the carpenters is called Paul Carpenter.\n\nChristopher Parker was offered a featured role but chose a stint on British soap opera EastEnders (1985 TV Series) instead.\n\nIn the movie, the opening montage was real footage of passengers meeting their loved ones at the airport, shot with hidden cameras. Richard Curtis said that when something special was caught on camera, they would rush up to people and ask for their permission to use it in the movie.\n\nIn 2020, Dua Lipa and Jimmy Fallon performed a cover of \"Christmas Is All Around Me\" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (2014).\n\nKate Ashfield was considered for the role of Sarah.\n\nJack and Judy's job was a source of confusion for many viewers. The characters were lighting doubles for a film shoot, so their job is to place themselves in the positions that the film's stars will later be in so that the lighting and camera crews can arrange the lights and focus the cameras for specific scenes without bothering the actual stars for the hours it can take to prepare to shoot a scene. Lighting doubles, unlike body doubles, or stunt doubles, do not appear in the actual film, but they do need to have the same coloring and basic size as the actor for whom they are doubling, hence Jack's comment about doubling for Brad Pitt--even though their faces do not look much alike, Martin Freeman and Pitt have similar hair and skin tones.\n\n(At around thirty-one minutes) A painting of Sir Winston Churchill shows up in the background.\n\nBilly Bob Thornton accepted his part in the film without even reading the script, he was so flattered by the accompanying letter asking him to be part of the ensemble.\n\nBilly Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman worked together in the first season of Fargo.\n\nConnections[]\n\nFollowed by[]\n\nRed Nose Day Actually (2017) (TV Short)\n\nEdited into[]\n\nDilwale (2015) - Veer's confession of love to Ishita is adapted from this film.\n\nReferences[]"
