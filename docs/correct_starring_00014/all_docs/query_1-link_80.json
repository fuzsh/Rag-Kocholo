Maybe they're hoping that movie-goers disappointed by sell-outs at the latest Star ...\n\nAmerican Dreamz\n\nIs it possible to satirize something that, in and of itself, often crosses the line into self-parody? That's a question that American Dreamz attempts to address. The objects of Paul Weitz's lampoon are two ripe ones: American Bush and American Id...\n\nBridget Jones' Diary\n\nBridget Jones's Diary is, quite simply, the finest motion picture released by Miramax Films since 1999's The Cider House Rules. Based on the novel by Helen Fielding, the screenplay for Bridget Jones's Diary (written by Four Weddings and a Funeral ...\n\nBridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\n\nBridget Jones' Diary was an unexpected delight: a witty, enjoyable trifle that touched the heart while tickling the funny bone.
