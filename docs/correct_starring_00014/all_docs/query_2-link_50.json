        "text": "High School Musical star Drew Seeley and American Idol season 19 finalist Grace Kinstler lead this year’s cast for “Love Actually Live,” the Broadway-style show that combines songs inspired by the hit holiday film with scenes from the movie itself, for a one-of-a-kind musical and cinematic experience.\n\nSeeley and Kinstler will be joined on stage by America’s Got Talent Season 17 Golden Buzzer winner, Madison Taylor Baez; The Voice finalist and viral YouTube star, Chris Mann; Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies actress, Cheyenne Isabel Wells; and Nina Nelson, from girl group, Citizen Queen, in addition to an ensemble cast of stage and screen veterans.\n\nThis year’s show celebrates the 20th anniversary of Love Actually, the star-studded romantic comedy that has become a festive favorite for the holidays. It’s been five years, meantime, since production company For the Record launched “Love Actually Live,” with the show once again returning to the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Los Angeles.\n\nAs scenes from the movie air on a big screen, the cast of singers will be joined by a live band on stage, to deliver Christmas classics and songs from the Love Actually soundtrack, like “Christmas Is All Around,” Kelly Clarkson’s “The Trouble with Love Is,” and Joni Mitchell’s “Both Sides Now.” Organizers say to expect a “multimedia concert celebration” of the film, that “transforms the Wallis’ Bram Goldsmith Theater into a giant, immersive cinema for the modern day.”\n\nCo-produced by Shane Scheel and The Wallis, “Love Actually Live” has played to nearly 45,000 people since its first run in 2018, with celebs like Demi Moore, Catherine O’Hara, Tom Hanks and Halle Bailey spotted in the audience.\n\nTickets for the show are available at TheWallis.org, with prices ranging from $69 to $119 for previews November 22 to November 28, and $79 to $139 for all performances November 29 to December 30."
