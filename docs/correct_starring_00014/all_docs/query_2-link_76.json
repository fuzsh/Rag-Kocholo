        "text": "Ah, “Love Actually.” A Christmastime classic.\n\nYou know what that light, fun rom-com could use? An in-depth visual analysis breaking down its sense of culture and portrayal of love’s multifarious configurations and underpinnings. So that’s our holiday gift to you!\n\n(P.S. If you like following arrows on cool graphics like this one, you might want to check out our work for clients like Chevrolet and Marvel — in addition to our other awesome infographics of all types.)\n\nIn our viewing, we lauded the way “Love Actually” keenly integrates its own media — through Billy Mack’s appearances on radio and television — while it also references outside films (“The Titanic” and “James Bond”), books (“Sherlock Holmes” and “Harry Potter”), and music (Joni Mitchell’s role is crucial).\n\nWe noted its inclusion of unrequited love (Mark and Juliet), interracial love (Juliet and Peter, Joanna and Sam), love across languages (Jamie and Aurelia), countries (Colin, Tony and the Americans), love despite status (the Prime Minister and Natalie), love after death (Daniel and Carol), brotherly love (Billy Mack and Joe), actual sibling love (Karen and the Prime Minister), and a few more varieties. Same-sex love isn’t well represented, and is even belittled when Joe says that Billy turned gay after being with Elton John for a short time.\n\nBut for a movie 136 minutes long, “Love Actually” represents an admirable effort to illustrate (in a commercially viable way) a varied love landscape.\n\nAnd now with our handy infographic, that love landscape is actually illustrated. What more could you wish for?"
