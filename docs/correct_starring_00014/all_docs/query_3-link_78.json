        "text": "12 July 2023\n\nBy Paul Glynn , Entertainment reporter\n\nHugh Grant has been pictured for the first time as an Oompa Loompa in the first official trailer for Wonka.\n\nThe movie tells the backstory of eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka, played by US star Timothée Chalamet.\n\nIt is set before the opening of his famous chocolate factory.\n\nAt the end of the trailer, Wonka meets Grant's green-haired and orange-faced character, who is trapped in a glass jar, noting: \"So you're the funny little man who's been following me?\"\n\nIt is a departure for Grant, 62, who is best known for playing quintessentially English gentlemen in films like Notting Hill, Love Actually and Bridget Jones's Diary.\n\nPortraying one of the workers at Wonka's factory, he is seen responding: \"I will have you know that I am a perfectly respectful size for an Oompa-Loompa.\"\n\nAfter Chalamet's Wonka appears to be unaware of the people from Loompaland, Grant's character opts to \"refresh your memory\" by playing him a tune and starting to dance.\n\nChalamet, 27, who rose to fame in 2017's Call Me By Your Name and went on to star in Dune, is shown in the clip complete with red coat and top hat at the start of Wonka's journey to becoming the famous confectioner. He's described as \"something of a magician, inventor and chocolate maker\".\n\nWe are informed that the protagonist, who has \"spent the past seven years traveling the world perfecting my craft\", will come up against a feared \"chocolate cartel\". He also teams up with a young girl, played by Calah Lane, on his way to inventing a chocolate that makes those who eat it fly.\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Google YouTube .

In a time and climate of intense political rhetoric, when there's so much bad news all the time, this is hopefully going to be a piece of chocolate.\""
