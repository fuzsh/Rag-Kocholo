        "text": "I did not see Four Weddings and a Funeral when it first came out 25 years ago. I was still just ten years old and not allowed to watch R-rated movies despite a deep desire to watch all of them. I had heard about it, though; a friend's older sister had seen it and had whispered of its manic opening scene, in which a hurried and bumbling Hugh Grant (descriptions one could use to describe most Hugh Grant characters) rushes to get to a wedding for which he was late while repeatedly uttering \"fuck.\" (The word was new to my vocabulary, and I was using it a lot at the time in hushed tones; the idea that a movie's first word could be that one was a little mind-blowing.) The title admittedly intrigued me, too; I was not yet versed in the kind of dry British humour that it nodded to, the mixed sardonic tones that could poke fun at matrimony and death.\n\nBut let's be honest: The thing that really appealed me at the time was Hugh Grant and his haircut.\n\nFour Weddings and a Funeral was not Grant's first movie role, but it was indisputably the movie that made him an international star—and the movie that essentially established the on-screen persona he maintained throughout the '90s, the awkward and harmless romantic leading man. In Four Weddings and many of the movies that followed, Grant played a sort of '90s update to the British fop—the kind of man who would walk into a room and stumble or fall over, but ultimately he would make at least one person in that room fall in love with him thanks to his sincerity and charm.\n\nI've always held a theory that his haircut was part of the appeal—or, at least, it appealed to me. Elvis's pompadour might have encouraged young men to stock up on pomade, and Luke Perry's sideburns likely influenced teenage boys to grow out their own wispy versions of facial hair. But for me, in 1994, I was ready to ditch the side part my mother forced on my head and let my hair flop on either side of my head just like Hugh Grant's. I wanted that voluminous hair so badly, and I was convinced it was attainable. (Alas, my hair has always been too thick and coarse to be that soft and floppy. The best I could do was a late '90s butt-cut, seen at right.)\n\nThe author at 15. (T-shirt by Structure.)\n\nThat full-bodied mess of hair seemed to offer a softer form of masculinity in the '90s, when most men with muscles wouldn't be caught in a drug store aisle lined with neon bottles of styling gel. And the freewheeling disorder of Grant's hair, particularly in Four Weddings, suggested a boyish sensibility. No matter that Grant's character in the film—the hopeless romantic Charles, who falls for a beautiful American woman he keeps meeting at various social engagements over the course of several months—is actually kind of a pig; the dorky hair overwhelmed his worst qualities as a serial monogamist with a trail of broken hearts behind him.\n\nBy the time I saw Four Weddings a few years after it came out in theaters (my parents had given up their restrictions on R-rated movies by the time I was able to drive myself to the video store and rent movies), I likely didn't recognize that Charles isn't exactly a romantic hero simply because Grant himself was so endearing and attractive. And while Grant's roles in subsequent films maintained a certain goofiness and social ineptitude, that character had fallen out of fashion by the turn of the century. (In the early aughts, even Grant embraced his inner lothario in films like Bridget Jones's Diary, Two Weeks Notice, and About a Boy—and he cut his hair.)\n\nKristin Scott Thomas and Hugh Grant in Four Weddings and a Funeral, which came out 25 years ago.\n\nIn an era when the rom-com has returned in full force—even Grant himself is having a mini resurgence thanks to Paddington 2 and A Very English Scandal—it's worth remembering the actor's influence on popular culture two decades ago, not just as a romantic leading player but also one of the greats in the Floppy Hair Hall of Fame. But I can't handle a nostalgic return of his haircut, as I've finally made peace with my inability to have it."
