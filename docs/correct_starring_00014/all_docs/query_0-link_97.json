        "text": "Lock up your bathrooms and hide your heirs, Emerald Fennell is back! The High Priestess of high-society gothic has just announced her newest blockbuster, and, oh boy, are things about to get dark. After leaving aristocrats and Oxford grads the world over cowering in their country piles with steamy murder romp Saltburn, the director is taking on a classic of English literature. And in characteristic style, there’s a manor house at the heart of it all – and some serious attachment issues.\n\nWuthering Heights, famous for its window-knocking ghosts, graverobbing, and not-so-subtle suggestions of mild incest, is the latest in line for the Emerald Fennell treatment. Written in 1847 by Emily Brontë (under the pseudonym Ellis Bell), the novel tells the tragic tale of Catherine Earnshaw and her adopted brother, Heathcliffe. Caterwauling around the Yorkshire Moors, their catastrophic love affair tears apart the social fabric of the landed gentry faster than you can say ‘bad dreams in the night’.\n\nRead More\n\nThe battle for Princess Diana’s legacy: how should we remember the People’s Princess?\n\nAs we mark what would have been the Princess's 63rd birthday, revisit the cover feature from the January 2024 issue when Eilidh Hargreaves asks if it’s time to switch off from Diana drama\n\nIf the haunting teaser poster that she shared on social media is anything to go by, audiences are in for more of the erotic macabre that has won Fennell such critical acclaim. A Mannerist skeleton with one-too-many arms drapes over the ink-splattered title, while the words ‘be with me always, take any form, drive me mad’ sit atop its skull. Classic Emerald Fennell moderation, then. And is that an overflowing sink it holds its hands?\n\nFennell has made a name for herself writing and directing films that you definitely don’t want to watch with your parents. And Wuthering Heights promises to be no different. After starting off as an actress, with roles like a young Camilla Parker-Bowles in The Crown, the daughter of Theo and Louise Fennell (whose 18th birthday party made it into the pages of Tatler) turned her well-jewelled hand to writing and directing. Breaking into Hollywood with Promising Young Woman, a dark bubblegum pop revenge story starring Carey Mulligan, Fennell bagged herself a best original screenplay gong at the Oscars.\n\nCould we see similar scenes after Wuthering Heights? It’s thought that Emily Brontë took inspiration from a real-life estate for Thrushcross Grange, the home of the Linton family in her controversial novel. (Wuthering Heights itself being a somewhat rundown farmhouse, in which any minor marquess wouldn’t be seen dead – though knowing Emerald Fennell, that might be an appealing plot point.) Sixteenth-century Ponden Hall was well-frequented by the Brontë family, after they came across it during the cataclysmic events of the Crow Hill Bog Burst – a seven-foot tsunami of mud that tore through West Yorkshire.\n\nWho’s sitting in the Wimbledon Royal Box this year?\n\nRead More\n\nEmerald Fennell’s newest film will join an illustrious canon of Wuthering Heights remakes, including a 1939 Laurence Olivier vehicle, Robert Fuest’s 1970 movie adaptation, and a pair of powerhouse performances by Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche in 1992.\n\nGiven that Saltburn sent Sophie Ellis-Bextor back to the top of the charts after Keoghan danced around in the buff to ‘Murder on the Dancefloor’ like a murderous iteration of Hugh Grant in Love, Actually, we might find ourselves hearing a lot more Kate Bush in the coming months."
