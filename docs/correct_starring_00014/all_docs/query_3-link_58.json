        "text": "While in LA promoting Nine Months in 1995, Grant was caught cheating on his partner of eight years, Elizabeth Hurley, with sex worker Divine Brown in a parked car. He was arrested, fined $1,000, and required to take AIDS education courses as part of his probation period. Grant quickly released a statement saying:\n\nLast night I did something completely insane. I have hurt people I love and embarrassed people I work with. For both things I am more sorry than I can ever possibly say.\n\nGrant had seen his breakout into stardom from the previous year's Four Weddings and a Funeral, and later chalked his lack of judgment up to his anxiety around the impending release of his subsequent film, Nine Months:\n\nI was about to launch my first Hollywood film. My timing was impeccable … My problem was—that was my first Hollywood film, and I'd just been to see it… The film was about to come out a week or two after that, and I had a bad feeling about it. And I went to see a screening. Everyone in it was brilliant, but I was so atrocious that I was not in a good frame of mind.\n\nHis fears weren't entirely misplaced; The Boston Globe's review of the film said, “Here's a theory about why Hugh Grant might want to commit career suicide: he's seen Nine Months.”\n\nGrant's PR tour following the scandal has been dubbed the perfectly executed celebrity apology. He must have done something right, as Grant and Hurley stayed together until 2000 and remain good friends.\n\nGrant has never been one to hold back on how he feels about his co-stars, nor how they feel about him. Asked to describe some of his famous leading women, he once detailed:\n\nEmma Thompson: Clever, funny, mad as a chair.\n\nRenée Zellweger: Delightful. Also far from sane. Very good kisser.\n\nSandra Bullock: A genius. A German. Too many dogs.\n\nJulianne Moore: Brilliant actress. Loathes me.\n\nRachel Weisz: Clever. Beautiful. Despises me.\n\nDrew Barrymore: Made her cry. Stunning film-star face. Hates me.\n\nHe once named Zellweger as one of the only co-stars he hasn't had issues with, though he joked about her lengthy correspondence:\n\nI love Renée… She's one of the few actresses I haven't fallen out with… And, we, we got on very well together and, we still exchange long emails… Hers in particular, at least 70 pages each, interesting stuff, but quite hard to decipher.\n\nWhile he also maintains a good relationship with Barrymore, he mentioned to Graham Norton that she once gave him notes on his acting, which could explain his “made her cry” comment:\n\n[Drew Barrymore] made the mistake of giving me notes. Which, how would you take that?\n\nDespite his ability to elegantly romance his co-star in every rom-com he stars in, Grant once admitted that he feels the premise of the films is entirely inaccurate to real life:\n\nThe big question is whether the whole idea of a man and a woman belonging together - and this being something we are all desperate for - is true, or a big fat lie… And I have a feeling it might be a big fat lie - despite having made a whole career and fortune out of it… I mean, how many really happy relationships do you know? There's not many…\n\nGrant reiterated his thoughts, specifically on a Notting Hill sequel, in another interview:\n\nI would like to do a sequel to one of my own romantic comedies that shows what happened after those films ended… Really, to prove the terrible lie that they all were, that it was a happy ending… I'd like to do me and Julia and the hideous divorce that's ensued with really expensive lawyers, children involved in [a] tug of love, floods of tears. Psychologically scarred forever. I'd love to do that film.\n\nFurther dismissing the possibility of long-term wedded bliss, he scoffed at the idea of marriage when it was mentioned that he could've had “four weddings of his own”:\n\nI suppose in effect I have. I certainly don't rule it out. But I think marriage is only necessary if you've got children. It's quite nice for them… I think most of them [children] happen slightly by accident or by people being cornered, and that's fine. If you sit down with your rational brain and think of good reasons to have them and good reasons not to, it would be a very close thing. I'm quite jealous of my Scottish relations, in whose culture everyone, in a Jane Austen kind of way, got married very young, when you're too young to be cynical or jaded, and just started having children.\n\nRoberts once admitted she was incredibly nervous about acting alongside Grant in Notting Hill and may have been rightly concerned. During an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Grant had plenty to say about their kissing scenes, candidly sharing:\n\n[She is] very big-mouthed! Literally, physically, she has a very big mouth. When I was kissing her I was aware of a faint echo.\n\nWhen Oprah retorted that Roberts was “one of the nicest people [she'd] met,” Grant snidely remarked: “I wouldn't go that far.” The Love Actually star continued his sentiments in a separate interview with Andy Cohen, reiterating:\n\nShe might hate me for saying this but the kissing scenes weren't all that great because she has such a large mouth. I was aware of a faint echo as I was kissing her… [We're no longer friendly.] I would be I suppose but I probably made too many jokes about the size of her mouth. She might hate me by now."
