        "text": "Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Olivia Olsen and Liam Neeson (now)\n\nSince Love Actually, Liam Neeson has enjoyed an unlikely career renaissance as a middle-aged action star in films including The Grey, Unknown, Non-Stop and the Taken franchise. He's most recently appeared in Martin Scorsese's Silence, A Monster Calls, and The Lego Movie.\n\nThomas Brodie-Sangster is now a successful voice actor, voicing Ferb Fletcher on the long-running Phineas and Ferb, as well as appearing in live-action roles on Game of Thrones and Wolf Hall. He's also a part of the young-adult franchise The Maze Runner.\n\nOlivia Olson is also a successful voice actor, working with Brodie-Sangster on Phineas and Ferb, and supplying her vocal talents to Adventure Time. She also released an EP in 2013.\n\nHugh Grant (now)\n\nSince Love Actually, Hugh Grant has dabbled intermittently with retirement from acting, while appearing here and there in major films, among them Cloud Atlas, Music and Lyrics and Florence Foster Jenkins, which scored him a Golden Globe nomination this year.\n\nIn real life, Grant was one of the leading figures in the Leveson Inquiry, which investigated an epidemic of phone-hacking by tabloid newspapers, and continues to campaign around press regulation as a member of Hacked Off.\n\nMartine McCutcheon (now)\n\nMcCutcheon headed to America following the success of Love Actually, declaring \"I've been to LA and they said I'm England's answer to Jennifer Lopez.\"\n\nAfter a US career didn't materialise, she returned to the UK, where she was the long-running face of Activia yoghurts and appeared on shows including Miss Marple and Spooks. She is now a regular contributor to Loose Women.\n\nKeira Knightley (now)\n\nKeira Knightley has gone on to become one of the UK's most successful acting exports, appearing in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, garnering Oscar nominations for Pride & Prejudice and The Imitation Game, and appearing in a diverse collection of films including Never Let Me Go, Begin Again, A Dangerous Method and Collateral Beauty... but we won't talk about that one.\n\nRodrigo Santoro and Laura Linney\n\nOne of the saddest stories in the original film saw Linney play a graphic designer desperately in love with her colleague Karl, played by Santoro. They came close to cementing their mutual attraction to one another, until they were interrupted by a call from her mentally ill brother. And Karl was never seen again. Again, what a monster.\n\nRodrigo Santoro (now)\n\nAfter appearing in a short-lived and much-maligned role on Lost (where his character was buried alive with his on-screen girlfriend after fans revolted), Santoro found greater TV success last year, playing an android bandit in the hugely acclaimed first series of Westworld.\n\nSantoro has also appeared in films including Ben-Hur, 300, and I Love You Phillip Morris.\n\nMartin Freeman (now)\n\nThen best known for his role on The Office, Freeman went on to two roles that would cement his star status: that of Bilbo Baggins in the Hobbit franchise, and Watson to Benedict Cumberbatch's Holmes in the BBC's Sherlock.\n\nOther projects include the first season of Fargo and films including Captain America: Civil War and Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.\n\nKris Marshall (now)\n\nThe success of Love Actually convinced Marshall to depart the long-running sitcom that made his name, My Family, and he went on to appear in a series of high-profile BT adverts, the cop drama Murder City, the surreal comedy Funland, and the US TV sitcom Traffic Light.\n\nHis most high-profile TV role in recent years has been as the lead detective the BBC murder mystery Death in Paradise. His recent departure from the series beckoned an outpouring of grief from fans.\n\nEmma Thompson (now)\n\nAn undeniable national treasure, Emma Thompson has continued to wow audiences with her talent on-screen and off, appearing in films as diverse as Stranger Than Fiction, An Education, Saving Mr. Banks and Beauty and the Beast. She also starred in and scripted the Nanny McPhee films and appeared in the Harry Potter franchise with her Love Actually costar and good friend Alan Rickman, who succumbed to cancer in 2016."
