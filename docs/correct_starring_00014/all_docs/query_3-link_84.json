        "text": "Tom Cruise as Lestat also springs to mind, and he did such a good job that Anne Rice issued a formal apology.\n\nI remember alot of people (including myself) saying that upon learning Michael Keaton was signed to play Batman....\n\nPossibly? I think it also depends on your movie tastes. Sir Christopher Lee is considered a horror legend, absolutely. I first saw him in late-night Hammer films. But his career is so much more than that. Dude even hosted Saturday Night Live back in the 70s. And McKellan's Richard III was Oscar-nominated (that's where I remember seeing him in a movie for the first time).\n\nLOTR cast a bunch of new and relatively obscure folk, but they did not lack for heavy-hitters.\n\nI think we're seeing a divide between Anglo and American movie fans.\n\nPicked the wrong damn Hugh. They should have gotten Hugh Laurie. Dave Bautista as his trusted but dimwitted bodyguard.\n\nDefinitely. She was great in I Am Not Okay With This and the recent It adaptation.\n\nSophia Ellis is a rising star.\n\nI think Hugh Grant is a good choice for a villain. I wonder if he'll be buried in special effects and CGI or play a basically humanoid being? I could see him as a dragon, or even a mind flayer, though I suspect not.\n\nI'm starting to get cautiously optimistic about the film, and specifically that the script is likely pretty solid. Bad scripts don't attract this much talent to it (there is a reason that recent fantasy flops like John Carter and Warcraft didn't get this much high level talent attached), and the writer/directors are people who clearly knows what they are doing (Game Night, Spider-Man). It's no guarantee (making movies is hard, making good movies is nearly impossible), but at this point, there is good reason to believe that the film could work. I mean, we have:\n\nChris Pine - Star of the reboot of one of the most popular Sci-Fi franchises of all time and co-star in a franchise based on one of the most popular DC heroes of all time\n\nMichelle Rodriguez - Co-star of one of the biggest action franchises of all time\n\nHugh Grant - Hugely recognizable name who has made a comeback by switching to villain roles\n\nRege-Jean Page - Up and coming star of a hit Netflix show likely looking to break into big screen films\n\nSophia Lillis - Co-star of one of the biggest horror film franchises of all time and still looking to grow her career\n\nJustice Smith - Part of the Jurassic World franchise, looking for a breakout roll\n\nChris, Michelle and Hugh all have no need to attach themselves to a project just for the cash, and all could hurt their careers by being on a massive flop. Rege-Jean, Sophia and Justice all are trying to break out into the next level of stardom, and definitely can't afford to be part of something that flops.\n\nAgain, that's no guarantee that the film will work, it still needs to be shot and survive studio notes (the Vacation reboot I'm sure looked great on paper but ended up failing), but the foundation looks very, very solid.\n\nSo maybe this is a coming of age movie where the parents are captured and the kids go out looking for them discovering their parents boss is behind their capture. They rescue their parents and confront the villain who flees because the kids brought back up. I envision he's imprisoned lots of people to support his plan and freeing them they normally wouldn't work together but choose to do so when the kids ask for their help and given it involves going after the villain who imprisoned them I can see them grinning and helping just for the chance to get revenge on him!\n\nOh god I just described Spy Kids and I like that movie!"
