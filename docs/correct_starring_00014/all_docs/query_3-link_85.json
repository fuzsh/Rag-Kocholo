        "text": "Hugh Grant has been transformed into an Oompa Loompa for the upcoming Wonka film, the new trailer has revealed.\n\nThe British actor appeared towards the end of the newly released footage from the highly anticipated movie, adorned with the iconic green hair and orange face of the characters.\n\nHe stars opposite Timothee Chalamet in the upcoming movie, who plays the famous Roald Dahl character Willy Wonka before he opened his chocolate factory.\n\nIn the trailer, which was released before a possible actors strike this week, Wonka meets Grant's Oompa Loompa who is trapped in a glass jar and says: \"So you're the funny little man who's been following me?\"\n\nThe Oompa Loompa replies: \"I will have you know that I am a perfectly respectful size for an Oompa Loompa.\"\n\nHe then says \"allow me to refresh your memory\" before playing a flute-like instrument and dancing, adding: \"I've started dancing now, and once I've started I can't stop.\"\n\nElsewhere in the whimsical trailer, we see the ensemble cast of actors, which includes the likes of Fantasy Football host Matt Lucas, Horrible Histories actor Matthew Baynton and Peep Show star Paterson Joseph, as well as Rowan Atkinson, Sally Hawkins and Keegan-Michael Key.\n\nChalamet will give an insight into Wonka's early life in the film, who in the trailer is described as \"something of a magician, inventor and chocolate maker\".\n\nThe clip reveals the young chocolatier comes up against a confectionery cabal in the film, and teams up with a young girl.\n\nElsewhere in the trailer, we see him surrounded by large crowds and dancing with umbrellas bearing his name.\n\nRead more:\n\nFake Wonka chocolate bars among Â£100,000 worth of items seized in raids\n\nIt's a golden ticket!
