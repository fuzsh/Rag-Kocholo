Tabriz; Must-See Capital of Islamic Tourism in 2018

Tabriz, the capital of the northwestern Iranian province of East Azarbaijan, is one of the country’s megacities with outstanding tourist attractions which helped it become the tourism capital of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in 2018.

Tabriz is the largest city in northwest of the country and regarded as the administrative, industrial, trade, military, communications, commercial and cultural hub of that region. Tabriz used to be one of the longest-serving capitals of Iran. It was Iran’s political capital during the rules of Atabaks, Khwarazmians, the Ilkhanate, Safavids, etc., and was the capital of crown princes during the Qajar era.

Tabriz’s development and progress peaked during the Ilkhanate rule when the city served as the capital of a vast territory spanning all the way from Nile to Central Asia. Tabriz was the world’s fifth most populated city in 1500 BC during the Safavid era when its population was as large as that of Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman empire.

Tabriz was named by the OIC as the tourism capital of Muslim World in 2018.

The following pictures retrieved from ILNA depict some of the city’s historical and natural tourist attractions as well as the city’s bazaar.
