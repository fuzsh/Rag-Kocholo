        "text": "The ulus of Hülegü were from the beginning in a peculiar political situation as a consequence of the religious tendencies of the Mongol rulers in Iran. The negative attitude of Hülegü toward Islam and his attack against the caliphate led to a breach with the Golden Horde in southern Russia, where Berke, Batu’s brother, had adopted Islam. The Il-Khans (“regional khans”) in Iran, on the other hand, remained at first loyal allies of the great khan Kublai in China, whereas Berke supported the pretender Arigböge who rose against Kublai. Hülegü remained hostile toward Egypt, the chief Islamic power in the Near East, so that the alliance between Berke and the Mamluks in Egypt, concluded in 1261, followed almost naturally. For the first time in history a Mongol ruler allied himself with a foreign power against another Mongol. Even European powers became partners of this political constellation. The Christian states of Tripoli and Acre, founded by the Crusaders, enjoyed the protection of the pope and the kings of France. It is therefore not surprising that in Rome and Paris the Il-Khans were regarded as potential allies against Islamic Egypt.\n\nHülegü’s son Abagha succeeded his father in 1265. Abagha’s wife was a Byzantine, a daughter of the emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus, and he tried to establish closer political and military ties with the Holy See, England, and France through the Nestorian patriarchs whom he favoured greatly. His repeated attempts to conquer Syria and Egypt, however, failed conspicuously, as no cooperation with Byzantium or the Christian powers could be effected. Abagha died in 1282, and under Arghūn (1284–91)—who was himself inclined toward Buddhism—the tolerant policy toward the Christians was continued. He, too, favoured the Nestorians and sent the Nestorian ecclesiastic Rabban bar Sauma as his ambassador to Europe in order to establish closer contact with the Christian powers. Bar Sauma went first to Byzantium and then to Paris, where he was received by Philip the Fair (1287). In Bordeaux he met King Edward I of England, and in Rome he was granted an audience by Pope Nicholas IV (1288). No tangible results followed, however. Arghūn’s subsequent letters to Philip of France (1289) and to Pope Nicholas IV (1290) are documents of great linguistic and historic interest.\n\nIn domestic affairs, Arghūn relied greatly on the services of the Jewish physician Saʿd al-Dawlah, who was appointed inspector general of the treasury in 1288. Resistance to Saʿd soon materialized and even provoked anti-Jewish riots. The financial situation of the empire became even more precarious when Arghūn’s successor Gaykhatu (1291–95) introduced paper currency on the Chinese model. This paper money proved a failure and resulted in complete economic confusion.\n\nThe reign of Maḥmud Ghāzān (1295–1304) brought changes in several fields. He introduced fiscal and monetary reforms and reorganized the administration of the whole empire. His conversion to Islam marks a definite break in Mongol and Iranian history. Buddhism was persecuted as idolatry, and even the Jews and Christians suffered. The adoption of Islam by the Mongols facilitated the assimilation of Mongols and Turks in north Iran by eliminating their religious differences. Ghāzān also declared himself formally independent of the court in Beijing, and any reference to the great khans in coin inscriptions or official documents was dropped. He no longer called himself Il-Khan but khan in order to underline his sovereignty. This emergence of Iran as an independent state was perhaps prompted by the death in 1294 of Kublai Khan, whose relations with his nephews and great-nephews in Iran had always been friendly.\n\nAfter Ghāzān’s premature death at the age of 31 (1304), his brother Öljeitü (1304–16) became khan. He had originally been a Christian and was baptized Nicholas but later became a Muslim. He continued the reform policy of Ghāzān and also kept his advisers, among them the statesman and historian Rashīd al-Dīn. The capital of the Il-Khans had hitherto been Tabriz, but Öljeitü moved his residence to Solṭāniyyeh near Qazvīn (1307). In foreign policy the new khan followed the pattern set by his predecessors: he decided to resume contact with European powers. His letter of 1307 addressed to Philip IV of France offering to continue friendly relations has survived. Both Ghāzān and Öljeitü were distinguished patrons of the arts and literature. Under the influence of Islam, the absorption of the Mongols by Iranian civilization became more and more pronounced. Although Öljeitü’s letter to Philip was written in Mongol, he calls himself not khan but sultan and uses a Muslim date along with the traditional Mongol designation of years arranged according to the animal cycle. The seals, like those on Arghūn’s letters, are in Chinese. This coexistence of Mongol, Turkic, Iranian, and Chinese elements in the Il-Khan empire lasted for more than half a century, but finally Islamic and Iranian influences proved to be the strongest.\n\nNevertheless, Iran remained for a long time under the influence of Chinese culture. Its miniature paintings of the 13th and 14th centuries, most notably those of the so-called Demotte Shāh-nāmeh, are clearly modeled on Chinese traditions. Iran produced under Mongol rule a historian who was perhaps the first ever to try to write a real world history. This was Rashīd al-Dīn’s Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh (“The Collection of Chronicles”), which incorporated not only the history of the Mongols but also that of India, China, and even Europe (the Franks). This universality could be expected only in a country like Iran where cultural and political ties existed simultaneously with China, the European powers, and the other Mongol empires."
