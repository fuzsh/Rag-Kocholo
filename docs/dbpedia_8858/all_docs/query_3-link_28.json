        "text": "Summary\n\nThe period of Mongol rule, with the Ilkhanid dynasty governing Iran (13th-14th cent.) presents problems of cultural change that can be described in terms of resilience and integration. This is visible in remnants of spectacular architecture and urban projects, as well as promising archaeological sites. Among these, the Rabʿ-i Rashidi in Tabriz stands out for its attested historical importance, its unique coverage by written documents about its foundation and functions, and for its accessibility for field research.\n\nThe Ilkhanid dynasty (c. 1256-1335) founded by Chingiz Khan’s grandson Hülegü, had a deep and long lasting impact on the political, social, demographic and cultural condition of Iran. For the first time after the Islamic conquest in the 7th century Iran regained the status of a distinct political-territorial entity. The Ilkhanid polity was encircled by hostile neighbors (Mamluks, the Mongol rulers of the Golden Horde and of the Ulus Chaghatay) - a situation that resulted in territorial confinement. The influx and permanent stay of a great mass of Mongols and Turks with of pastoral nomad background into a habitat characterized by agriculture and sedentariness meant a considerable challenge for the conquerors and the conquered alike. Entanglement between Mongol and Iranian elites was the result. Therefore phenomena and processes of resilience and integration can be observed on both sides. For maintenance of their nomadic lifestyle the Mongols had to concentrate in areas favorable to pastoral nomadism, i.e. the northern and northwestern territories of the Iranian highland. The Iranian administrative elite was constantly on the move together with the center of power, the royal encampment (ordu). The Ilkhanid rulers turned out to be passionate builders. They commissioned buildings alongside their seasonal routes of migration and initiated urban development or even the founding of new cities - directly as patrons or indirectly via their Iranian administrators. In the wake of earthquakes, war and deliberate demolition only few architectural or archaeological remnants of the Mongol period are still extant. This situation is aggravated by the fact that Iranian research has rarely considered the Mongol period a rewarding topic\n\nFor a better understanding of spatial concepts, patterns of migration and urban development our transdisciplinary project will evaluate textual and archaeological evidence. Spotting and mapping the routes of migration and the sites of seasonal dwellings into a geo-documented map has been a first objective of the project. The resulting map was to be used as a basis for local field research. One promising site is the vicinity of Bustanabad (60 km SE from Tabriz), which preliminary soundings have suggested as the location of the important seasonal residence of Ujan. Mongol agency in urban development also is reflected in the narrative and documentary sources of the period. In Tabriz, archaeological exploration of one of the largest pious foundation complexes of the period, the Rabʿ-i Rashīidi, is under way in a German-Iranian project. In this case, too, textual evidence and archaeological evidence complement each other. The project aims at expanding and supplementing ongoing works, with excavations in three campaigns.\n\nThese goals have been largely impossible to realise, due to the Covid19 pandemic and subsequent developments. Most important, no fieldwork was possible in Iran during the years 2020-2022. Therefore, the research group laid the focus of their work on three aspects:\n\nFurther evaluation of the 2017-2019 fieldwork on the Rabʿ-i Rashidi area: From the excavated material and documentation of architectural remains, it was possible to form first (preliminary) hypotheses concerning the buildings of the founding phase and phases of later use.\n\nAnalysis of written sources on the water supply of the Rabʿ-i Rashidi: First and foremost, the foundation deed was to be confronted with the extant topography (preferably after historical aerial photographs and maps), to gain more clarity about hydraulic installations that were created with the foundation of Rashid ad-Din.\n\nEvaluating written sources on the period of Ottman-Safavid conflicts in Northwestern Iran: A considerable number of Persian and Ottoman sources, which have not been evaluated (or even edited) in a satisfying manner, contain information about the Ottoman campaigns of the late 16th century, which led to the occupation of Tabriz several times, and about the Safavid re-conquests. Building activities are also reported. According to these sources, it appears highly unlikely that any parts of the Rabʿ-i Rashidi fortifications can be attributed to Ottoman activities.\n\nResults of this research have been and are being published in numerous articles and presentations.\n\na) Articles\n\nBirgitt Hoffmann: “The Mongol Ilkhanate of Iran: Realm or Empire?”.
