Originating in the Mongol heartland, it stretched from the shores of the Persian Gulf and the Danube River to the Pacific Ocean. The empire united large regions, some of which are still united today.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information about the Mongol Empire, or you can download our 28-page Mongol Empire worksheet pack to utilize within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nGENGHIS KHAN\n\nGenghis Khan, known as Temujin as a child, was the son of a Mongol lord. He is recognized as one of the greatest military leaders in history.\n\nHe conquered his domestic opponents by 1206. The nomadic tribes of the Mongolian steppe came together at a kuriltai (general assembly), where Temujin was crowned as the khagan (Emperor) of the Yekhe Mongol Ulus (Great Mongol State).\n\nHe took the title Genghis Khan (universal leader), thus marking the start of the Mongol Empire.\n\nAll of the Mongol-speaking tribes that Genghis Khan ruled over are called Mongols.\n\nGenghis Khan launched a series of expeditions into adjacent regions, capturing much of northern China.\n\nTurning west, his troops and famed cavalry swept through Central Asia, capturing vast areas of the Caspian Sea and the Middle East.\n\nIn 1223, the Mongols routed a force led by Russian princes across the Caucasus Mountains. When Genghis Khan returned to Mongolia in 1225, he controlled a large portion of the Silk Road commercial network, which facilitated trade between Europe and Asia.\n\nGenghis Khan employed marriage as a crucial diplomatic strategy during his ascent to power, as it was an effective means of forging political bonds.\n\nGenghis Khan died on August 18, 1227.\n\nOGODEI KHAN\n\nA kuriltai was called by tradition to pick the next khan. Ogodei was officially named Great Khan in 1229.\n\nOgodei Khan was Genghis Khan’s third son. He was selected as heir, presumably due to his calm disposition and propensity for mediating disputes between his two elder brothers.\n\nUnder Ogudei’s leadership, the Mongols expanded the empire’s borders in 1229 and carried out fruitful wars throughout Russia, the Caucasus, and Persia.\n\nIn 1234, he led one of the three Mongol armies that overthrew the Jin Dynasty in northern China.\n\nOgodei also changed the Mongol Empire’s strategy from military occupation and exploitation to administration and taxation of occupied territories.\n\nIn the 1230s, he established an imperial capital at Karakorum in Mongolia and devised an efficient relay system to send messages over the great expanses of Eurasia.\n\nOgodei died on December 11, 1241. Mongol soldiers on the western front, which had reached Hungary, returned after learning of his death, ending the empire’s European conquests.\n\nToregene, the widow of Ogodei, assumed leadership of the empire after his death. She wants her son, Guyuk, to be appointed. Batu Khan, the ruler of the Golden Horde, opposed it, arguing that he was descended from Genghis’ eldest son.\n\nIn 1246, Toregene managed to ensure Guyuk’s election.\n\nGUYUK KHAN\n\nGuyuk declared that he would carry on his father’s policies and gave his father’s officials their old posts back.\n\nAs commander in chief of the army in Persia, he appointed Eljigidei, the father of his closest friend, to lead the troops.\n\nIn 1248, Guyuk gathered further forces and advanced westward. He passed away en route at Qum-Senggir in Xinjiang.\n\nOghul Qaimish, the widow of Guyuk, assumed leadership of the empire and governed as regent for three years.\n\nMÖNGKE KHAN\n\nMöngke Khan won the Khanate in a contested kuriltai. Möngke’s mother, Sorqoqtani Beki, had worked hard to offer her four sons a chance to become Great Khan.\n\nElite women occupied vital roles in the empire. After her spouse, Tolui, died, Sorqoqtani declined a marriage proposal from Ogodei, believing she would have more power if she remained independent.\n\nShe made her move during the 1251 kuriltai, planning with her nephew, Batu, to place her eldest son, Möngke, on the throne rather than someone from Ogudei’s line.\n\nMöngke Khan ordered the destruction of his Ogodei opponents. Among them was the former regent Oghul Qaimish, whom he accused of witchcraft and hanged.\n\nMöngke implemented administrative reforms. He conducted an empire-wide census to serve as the foundation for intricate tax and tribute regulations and introduced coins and paper money to aid in tax collection.\n\nMöngke also delegated command of vital military expeditions to two of his brothers, Hulegu and Kublai.\n\nIn 1258, Hulegu seized Baghdad for the Mongols, killing the last ruler of the Abbasid Caliphate. Kublai was stationed in northern China, fighting alongside Möngke, who was killed in combat on August 11, 1259, against the Song Dynasty in the south.\n\nKUBLAI KHAN\n\nWhen Möngke died, Kublai Khan and his brother, Ariq Boke, who was based in Mongolia, fought for the succession.\n\nAriqboke’s army was destroyed by Kublai’s and took over the southern Mongolian government after four years of civil war.\n\nNonetheless, many questioned his legitimacy as the Great Khan of the Mongols because he was not adequately acknowledged in a legitimate kuriltai.\n\nHulegu supported Kublai in the southwest Ilkhanate, but in 1262, hostilities broke out with their relative Berke, the leader of the Golden Horde.\n\nHulegu passed away on February 8, 1264. In the process of trying to seize his territory, Berke died.\n\nKublai proposed Temür, his grandson, to be the leader of the Golden Horde and named Abaqa, the son of Hulegu, the new Khan.\n\nKublai faced political challenges in China as the leader of a foreign occupation. However, he sought to rule in the manner of a Chinese emperor. He built Dadu (now Beijing) and relocated the imperial capital from Mongolia.\n\nIn recognition of Chinese political tradition and an attempt to gain the respect of its people, Kublai renamed the newly established Mongol government in China the Yuan dynasty in 1271.\n\nTHE YUAN DYNASTY\n\nAmong China’s most extraordinary emperors was Kublai Khan. He united the country by destroying the national Song dynasty (1279). This made Mongols the first non-Chinese nation to conquer the entirety of China.\n\nAfter 1279, the Mongol-Chinese empire gained no additional territory, and the Kamikaze of 1274 and 1281 stopped two efforts to extend Mongol authority to Japan.\n\nThe Mongol army could still impose minor uprisings against the government, but the court’s authority progressively weakened. Later, emperors’ authority was undermined by family conflicts and intrigues at court.\n\nKublai Khan died in 1294. His grandson, Temür Khan, succeeded him and carried on his policies at 13.\n\nThe Mongol rule in China gradually declined. There was considerable dissatisfaction, frequently manifested as local rebellions against the Mongol government.\n\nFormer monk Zhu Chongba was the most successful rebel leader. Eventually, in 1368, Zhu drove the Mongols from Beijing and declared himself the Ming dynasty’s Emperor.\n\nTemür fled into the steppes and died in 1370.\n\nMongolia was considered a part of the Ming dynasty, and the Mongols were regarded as subjects of the Ming rulers. The Mongolian grasslands were often attempted to be occupied by the early Ming emperors.\n\nThe Golden Horde disintegrated into smaller Turkic hordes that gradually lost control over four centuries.\n\nSOCIETY\n\nLaw and Governance\n\nYassa (“order” or “decree”) was the legal system that Genghis created and used to rule the Mongol Empire. A specific tenet of this code was that people of rank had hardships comparable to those of the average person.\n\nGenerals and leaders were chosen by merit.\n\nMongol leaders gathered with the great Khan to deliberate internal and international policies in the kurultai, the non-democratic central assembly modeled like a parliament. Kurultai (meetings) were also held to choose every new great khan.\n\nLiterature\n\nThe Secret History of the Mongols, composed for the royal family following Genghis Khan’s death in 1227, is the earliest piece of literature still in existence in the Mongolian language. It is the most essential narrative of Genghis’ life and ancestry, from birth to the founding of the Mongol Empire.\n\nThe Universal History, or Jami’ al-tawarikh, is another masterpiece from the empire. The Ilkhan Abaqa Khan commissioned it in the early 14th century to document the Mongols’ legacy.\n\nThe Silk Road\n\nThe Mongol conquest of the Asian continent restored the Silk Road and contributed to political stability.\n\nThe Mongols had a tradition of encouraging trade and merchants. Genghis had welcomed foreign traders.\n\nThrough an agreement called ortoq (merchant partner), the Mongols sent merchants far and wide while providing them with capital.\n\nMongol elites established trade partnerships with merchants from Italian cities, including the family of Marco Polo.\n\nRoads that connected regions from the Mediterranean basin to China significantly increased overland trade.\n\nOgodei and Guyuk carried on the merchant partner business’ legacy. Merchants were granted tax exemptions and use of the empire’s official relay stations in exchange for providing the royal palaces with clothing, information, and other necessities.\n\nMöngke Khan altered policy\n\nTo curtail misdeeds resulting from money laundering and excessive taxation, he dispatched imperial inspectors to oversee the ortoq enterprises. He ordered all merchants to pay property and commercial taxes.\n\nThe political, cultural, and economic unity along the Silk Road collapsed in the fall of the Mongol Empire.\n\nMongol Empire Worksheets\n\nThis fantastic bundle includes everything you need to know about the Mongol Empire across 28 in-depth pages.

It was founded by Genghis Khan and expanded under his successors, eventually encompassing vast territories across Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.\n\nHow did the Mongol Empire expand so rapidly?\n\nThe Mongol Empire expanded rapidly due to several factors including superior military tactics, a highly organized and disciplined army, effective use of espionage and diplomacy, and the strategic leadership of figures like Genghis Khan and his successors. They were also adept at incorporating conquered peoples into their empire, often through alliances or administrative roles.\n\nWhat were some significant achievements of the Mongol Empire?\n\nThe Mongol Empire facilitated significant cultural exchange and trade along the Silk Road, connecting East and West. They established a system of governance known as the Pax Mongolica, which brought stability and security to much of Eurasia for several decades. Additionally, they fostered advancements in technology, medicine, and the arts across the territories they controlled.\n\nWhat were some key events or battles in the history of the Mongol Empire?\n\nThe conquests of Genghis Khan in the early 13th century laid the foundation for the empire. The Battle of Yehuling (1211) and the Battle of Zhongdu (1215) against the Jin Dynasty were pivotal victories. The conquests of Central Asia, Persia, and Russia under Genghis Khan’s successors expanded the empire further. The siege of Baghdad in 1258 and the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260 are also significant events.\n\nWhat led to the eventual decline of the Mongol Empire?\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the decline of the Mongol Empire, including internal strife and succession disputes among the ruling family, overextension of resources due to the vastness of their empire, the Black Death pandemic which weakened populations and disrupted trade routes, and successful resistance movements by local powers. Eventually, the empire fragmented into separate Khanates, each ruling over different regions, marking the end of the unified Mongol Empire.\n\nLink/cite this page\n\nIf you reference any of the content on this page on your own website, please use the code below to cite this page as the original source.\n\nLink will appear as Mongol Empire Facts & Worksheets: https://kidskonnect.com - KidsKonnect, February 14, 2024\n\nUse With Any Curriculum\n\nThese worksheets have been specifically designed for use with any international curriculum.
