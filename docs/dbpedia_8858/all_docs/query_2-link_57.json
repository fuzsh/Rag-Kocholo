        "text": "Introduction\n\n1Very few articles have been published concerning the relationship between the Golden Horde (1236-1502) and the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). This is remarkable as both polities were influential successor states of the Great Mongol Empire and coexisted for almost a century. It is the widely-held opinion in Mongol history studies that in the civil war between Möngke’s two younger brothers, Qubilai and Ariq-Böke, the new ruler of the Golden Horde, Berke (r. 1256-1266), rejected Qubilai’s legitimacy and supported Ariq-Böke. The relationship between the Great Khan of the Yuan Dynasty and the Khan of the Golden Horde was irreparably damaged after Ariq-Böke’s failed claim for the throne. At the same time, the superiority of the Great Khan was weakened after the dissolution of the Mongol Empire. As a result of their political and diplomatic estrangement and the vast distance between New Saray and Khanbaliq, the Great Khan of the Yuan Dynasty no longer had a voice in the internal affairs of the Golden Horde.\n\n2One of the most important Chinese sources, the Yuanshi (The History of Yuan, hereafter YS), was compiled between 1368 to 1369. The text is mainly based on the imperial annals, governmental archives, and official reports in the royal chancery (Chen, 1990: 115-129), and includes a significant amount of information relating to the military and diplomatic contacts between the Yuan and the Golden Horde. In addition, there are local Chinese documents and personal works (e.g. gazetteers, literary anthologies, and inscriptions), written during the reigns of the first four Mongol Great Khans (1206-1259), which occasionally reveal the esteem that the Jochids had in the eastern part of the Mongol Empire.\n\n4This contribution seeks to provide an overview of Golden Horde history from the perspective of the Yuan Dynasty. It uses Yuan sources to obtain new information on the status of the ruler of the Jochid ulus in the eyes of the Yuan historians, the importance of Jochid apanages in China, and local dual-administrative structures and officials. The question to what extent Berke’s Islamisation influenced the Jochids’ relationship with the Toluids is also discussed. The contribution ends with a discussion of the relationship between the Golden Horde and the Yuan Dynasty in the post-Berke period.\n\nThe Status of the Ruler of the Jochid Ulus\n\n5Generally speaking, Chinese historians refer to the Jochid princes as the « princes of western regions » (xidao zhuwang, 西道諸王) or the « princes of the right hand » (Song, 1978: 63, 1721). These labels are used in conjunction with the terms « princes of eastern regions » (dongdao zhuwang, 東道諸王) or « princes of the left hand » (zuoshouzhuwang, 左手諸王) (Song, 1978: 63, 3797-3798), which refer to the descendants of Chinggis Khan’s brothers. The emperor of the Yuan Dynasty was called the heir of « the nation of the centre » (Mong. qool-un ulus), which indicated he was Qubilai’s lineal descendant and a legitimate successor of Chinggis Khan.\n\n9The similarity between Batu and Hülegü’s status is also reflected in their princely titles. The Chinese granted Möngke-Temür the title « to bring benefit to the country and to show mercy to the people » (jiguo huimin, 濟國惠民), which was probably inherited from Batu and has the same rhetoric form as Hülegü’s title on Abaqa’s seal: « to support the country and to procure peace for people » (fuguo anmin, 輔國安民) (Allsen, 1991: 227-228; Belyaev and Sidorovich, 2013: 20-21; Chen, 2015: 70). These two princely titles correspond to fujun and ilkhan respectively, and indicate the same status, namely that of imperial representative of the Great Khan (Buell, 1977: 126, 227).\n\nThe Apanages and Benefits of the Jochid ulus in China\n\nApanages\n\n10The apanage of Jochi can be regarded as a loose unity that consisted of a large steppe territory and a series of isolated fiefs that were conquered during various episodes of conquest. The steppe territory and isolated fiefs had been established in different ways.\n\n11First, several years before his death, Chinggis Khan divided his empire among his three brothers and his four sons from his chief wife. The author of The Secret History and Juvaynī do not mention in what year this occurred, but Sugiyama (1978: 7) suggests it took place between 1207-1211. As Chinggis’s eldest son, Jochi was granted the steppe-forest territory and peoples between the western side of the Altai Mountains and the Irtysh River. Around the same time, the empire was divided into a centre and a left and right wing, reflecting the traditional, tripartite nomadic military structure. This tripartite division was strictly duplicated in newly-conquered territories.\n\n13Decades later, in 1281, the tripartite system continued to be implemented by Qubilai (Song, 1978: 2414), when he divided the population and revenues of Jiangxi and Hunan, two provinces of the Southern Song Dynasty, which had been conquered several years prior. As one of the princes of the right wing (i.e. the offspring of Chinggis Khan’s sons), the Jochid state received 60,000 families in Yongzhou (永州) in today’s Hunan. Pingyang and Yongzhou together constituted the Jochid ulus’s most important apanages. Their number of households and annual revenues were carefully registered in the governmental archives. Even decades later, when the relationship between the Golden Horde and the Yuan Dynasty had deteriorated, the Jochid ulus’s rights and privileges in these regions continued to be guaranteed by the government. This situation changed in 1288 when Qubilai merged the Directorate-General for the Pingyang Apanage (pingyangtouxia zongguanfu, 平陽投下總管府) into the administration of Pingyang Circuit (pingyanglu, 平陽路). This meant that the Yuan court stopped paying annual revenues to the Jochid ulus (Song, 1978: 311). However, when Özbek Khan sent an envoy to make inquiries in 1336, the revenues were paid out after all (Song, 1978: 2906).\n\n14Second, when a prince conquered a settled area, he had the right to request it as his apanage (Togan, 2001: 180, n.39). There is evidence for this kind of apanage belonging to the Jochid state in China. In 1227, Batu was granted Shazhou (沙州) in the former Tangut kingdom (xixia, 西夏) as reward for taking the city after a bloody struggle (Song, 1978: 1450). Sha-zhou lay outside the major Jochid apanage, and was linked to it through the postal system (Mong. jam) (Song, 1978: 2906; Shen, 2015: 98-99).\n\n15The outcome of this system was that each Mongol ulus consisted of a loose unity of apanages that included sections belonging to different imperial families and minor possessions that were severed from the major apanage and granted to other princes (Jackson, 1979: 192-193). Naṭanzī, a Timurid historian, inaccurately explained the genesis of the system:\n\nChinggis Khan divided [the empire] among his four sons, he assigned each son several possessions in the territory of the others so that in this way envoys would continuously pass to-and-fro between them. (Naṭanzī, 1957: 427; Allsen, 2001: 184).\n\n16In 1238, Ögödei ordered to sever Shenzhou (深州) and Guchen (鼓城) from Zhending (真定), and granted them to the Chagatayid and Jochid states respectively. Both places were on the border of the Toluids’s apanage. Batu received 10,000 households in Zhending (真定), and ordered the establishment of an Office of Military and Civil Myriarchy (junmin wanhufu, 軍民萬戶府) to administer his subordinates there (Song, 1978: 1358, 2414). In addition, we know that Berkecher’s son, Yesü Buqa (Rashīd al-Dīn: f.113b), was given the apanages in Liaoshan (遼山) and Heshun (和順). These regions bordered the Chagatayids’ apanage, whose agents once plundered the population of these two counties, resulting in a conflict involving hundreds of people (Xu, 1985: 259). Besides Jochi’s descendants, Qutuqu, the son of Qubilai’s concubine, owned pasture land in Luzhou (潞州), which was an inferior county in Batu’s apanage. This is probably due to the close relationship between Qutuqu and Batu. Qutuqu’s eldest daughter, Kalmish, married Batu’s amīr and emigrated to the Golden Horde (Qiu, 2011: 109-110).\n\n17Due to the remoteness of these apanages, it was difficult to maintain an efficient administration from the main camps of the Golden Horde, especially during the tumultuous period following 1260. Thus, during Qubilai’s reign, most of these fragmentary apanages were transformed into traditional Chinese, local administrative institutions, and placed under the direct control of Yuan officials. The government no longer registered the revenue of the Jochid ulus separately, but included it in the state revenue. In addition, Qubilai’s son, Ananda, Prince of Anxi, annexed part of Pingyang in the 1270s (Wang, 1998: 72).\n\nLocal administrative institutions\n\n18Even within his apanage, a prince’s jurisdiction was not exclusive but shared with the emperor. Normally, the imperial representative was placed in a superior position that covered more than one princely apanage. The imperial representative took charge of affairs in cooperation with princely representatives, military officials, and locally recruited elites. This system can be referred to as a dual-administrative structure, which set a precedent for the satellite administration that was established during the reign of Möngke (Buell, 1977: 125).\n\n19Unfortunately, there is only very limited information regarding the dual-administrative structure of the Golden Horde, especially in early periods. This is largely due to the absence of a written historiographical tradition in the Qipchaq cultural sphere (Halperin, 2007: 273). However, there is direct evidence for the dual-administrative structure in Central Asia and China. For instance, around 1230, Ögödei ordered all the princely representatives in Transoxiana and Turkistan to assist Chormaqun, the Great Khan’s representative. Batu’s representatives were the civil administrator, Chin-Temür, and the Mongol amīr, Nosal (Juvaynî, 1958: 482-3).\n\n20In China, the Great Khan nominated his intimate attendants to oversee the civil and military affairs of various princely apanages in Shanxi Province. Around 1229, Sayyid Ajall was appointed as daruγači of Taiyuan and Pingyang, which belonged to Chagatayids and Jochids respectively (Song, 1978: 3063). The continuity of the policy is shown by the fact that two years later a Mongolian official, Süke (su-ge, 速哥), replaced Sayyid Ajall (sai-dian-chi, 賽典赤) and adopted a new title « great daruγači of Shanxi Province ». His son inherited this position after his death (Song, 1978: 3052-3053). The Great Khan also dispatched other officials as assistants. In 1231, Ögödei’s former bitikči (Mong. scribe), Hu Tianlu (胡天禄), was dispatched to the Jochid state’s apanage to revive the local economy (Tong, 1986: v.5, f.13a). The policy of sending assistants guaranteed the supreme authority of the Great Khan over the whole empire. It allowed him to efficiently mobilise manpower and other military resources from the apanages and mediate disputes among the various imperial families.\n\n21There existed similar arrangements economic affairs. For instance, the tax levied on the local salt ponds of Xiezhou (解州), today’s Yuncheng (運城) in Shanxi Province, provided substantial income for the government. Therefore, Ögödei assigned Yao Xingjian (姚行簡) as the Commissioner of the Salt Tax of Xie[zhou] (xieyanshi, 解鹽使) to supervise tax affairs (Wang, 1998: 51). Among Yao Xingjian’s subordinates, Su Zhuan (蘇瑑), was appointed as the Commissioner of the Monopoly Office of Taxed Salt of Xiezhou in the Hedong area (hedong juquexieyansuo dashi, 河東拘榷解鹽所大使) (Liu, 2011: 44). Su Zhuan’s family had served Batu since 1236, and as his representative, he was responsible for overseeing the interests of Batu and other Jochids in local salt tax affairs.\n\n22Local gazetteers and inscriptions provide detailed information about several representatives of the Jochid ulus and local administrative structures. According to Batu’s edict of 1237, his representatives consulted with the officials of the Great Khan, namely the jaruqači (judge) Taraqudai and the aforementioned bitikči Hu Tianlu (Cui, 1826: f. 20b-22a), before his orders were put into practice. However, ten years later (1251), another edict indicates that Batu’s status had risen in the early years of Möngke’s reign. This edict was addressed to Batu’s representative and governors directly, without consulting the Great Khan’s officials (Qü, 2006: 840-841).\n\n23These two edicts also record the names of several representatives, including Seče (xue-che, 斜徹), Jara’un (xia-la-hun, 匣剌浑), Jalardai (zha-la-er-dai, 札剌兒歹), and Qorqai (huo-la-hai, 霍剌海), most of whom can be identified as Mongols. In addition to Mongol officials, local elites had to be recruited as assistants to take care of daily affairs. Thus, we can assume that the local administrative structure in the Jochid apanages included the following positions: 1) jaruqači; 2) chief daruγači; 3) subordinate daruγači; 4) the nökörs of Mongol officials, 5) Chinese officials (commander and technical officials); 6) interpreters (kelemači). Other than collecting revenues, Batu’s representatives participated in many areas of local administration, such as sponsoring the re-establishment of local offices, recruiting manpower to rebuild bridges, organising public security, and allocating water.\n\n24In general, nothing is known of Batu’s representatives except for their names. The only exception is an official called Seče, whose name is mentioned in different works, which enables us to sketch a general outline of his life. In 1237, Seče was appointed as chief daruγači in Pingyang, and in 1241 he sponsored the re-establishment of a local office that had been destroyed during the Mongol invasion. Five years later, he was promoted to jaruqači (Wang, 1998: 61), but soon after he was executed on Güyük’s orders. It seems that he became a victim of the personal enmity between Batu and Güyük (Song, 1978: 3467). In addition, a recently-published tomb inscription mentions a Chinese official serving Batu. This person, named Su Gongshi (蘇公式), was appointed as « the daruγači of the various artisans of Pingyang ». He thrice transferred revenue to Batu’s encampment, which was located in the region of today’s Kazakhstan (Liu, 2011: 43-44; Shen, 2015: 92-100). According to Chinese sources, Batu’s revenue was paid in gold, and probably included golden wares produced by Chinese artisans. An archaeological analysis by Shen (2012: 7-97) suggests that golden wares found in early Golden Horde tombs show Chinese influence in craftsmanship (Shen, 2012: 7-97).\n\nA Consequence of Islamisation?\n\n25Is it reasonable to consider the hostility between Berke and the Toluids (i.e. Qubilai and Hülegü) a consequence of Berke’s conversion to Islam? Most Islamic sources assert that their enmity originated from Berke’s response to Hülegü after the fall of the Abbasid Caliphate. However, this reading is gradually being questioned. The evidence remaining in the multilingual corpus reveals that their estrangement began at a very early stage. In fact, the policies issued during Möngke’s reign already split the alliance between the two families.\n\n26It is well known that after Möngke’s enthronement in 1251, Batu, his main supporter, was rewarded with further privileges in the western part of the Mongol Empire. The Talas River became the boundary of Möngke and Batu’s spheres of influence. However, both de facto and de jure, Möngke’s authority remained absolute throughout the empire (Allsen, 1987: 54-63). To achieve the necessary balance between both parties, Batu had to give up several interests in the east. For instance, Arghun āqā and Batu made an agreement in 1252 to arrange the taxes of Iran and the Caucasus, which confirmed Batu’s specific interests (Kolbas, 2006: 143). As a condition of this exchange, the annual grant to the Jochid ulus from China was reduced to a much smaller amount than Batu had requested (Song, 1978: 47). Moreover, Jochid princes were excluded from assignments in Tibet, which was monopolised by the Great Khan and his three brothers (Petech, 1990: 11).\n\n27In the same year, Möngke assigned the conquests of the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad and Southern Song in South China to his two younger brothers, Qubilai and Hülegü respectively (Song, 1978: 46; Juvaynī, 1957: 607). As part of this arrangement, the Mongol garrisons stationed in Central Asia and North China were transferred to the princes, and local economic sources, which had previously been shared among various imperial branches, were bestowed upon them as well. According to Möngke’s decree, the Jochid garrisons (Mong. tammači) in Iran and Kashmir were under Hülegü’s command (Rashīd al-Dīn, 1994: v.2, 975). Thus, with Möngke’s support, Hülegü’s agent had the upper hand over the Jochids in Herat’s local economic affairs around 1255 (Sayfī, 2004: 259-267; Jackson, 1978: 222, n.157). A similar scenario unfolded in China. In 1253, Qubilai monopolised the salt tax of Xiezhou with Möngke’s permission. A new institution was established, called the Office of the Expedient Actions (Congyifu, 從宜府), which came to incorporate the former Monopoly Office of Taxed Salt of Xiezhou in the Hedong area (Song, 1978: 59; Wang, 2010: 51). The monopoly office had been the office of Batu’s agent, whereas the new institution, which was responsible for preparing military supplies and taxation, was controlled exclusively by Qubilai.\n\n28In addition to restricting Jochid privileges in China, Möngke started to regulate the economic disorder in the princely territories. In 1255, a Chinese intellectual addressed a memorandum to the Great Khan (i.e. Möngke) via Qubilai, wherein he complained that Batu had redistributed the apanage in Pingyang among the Jochid clan, and had permitted all imperial relatives to collect taxes from subjects directly. Furthermore, Batu had ordered Chinese subjects to pay their annual tribute exclusively in gold, which caused extensive poverty (Hao, 1738: v.32, f.19). In response, Möngke issued an edict regulating illegal taxation in 1255, and two years later a strict population census was conducted, again at Möngke’s order, in order to prevent economic anarchy.\n\n29The relationship between the two families deteriorated further after Batu’s death in 1255. In a hasty arrangement, Möngke appointed Sartaq to succeed Batu, but he died on the way back to his realm. Some contemporaries accused his uncle, Berke, of poisoning Sartaq. Within two years, Sartaq’s successor, Ulaghchi, passed away also. In the eyes of the Toluids, Berke was not well suited to head the Jochid ulus, which was partly due to his relatively lowly maternal line: his mother, Sulṭān Khan, was a former Khwārazmshāh princess, who was granted to Jochi after being captured by the Mongols (Pochekaev, 2010: 248-249). Meanwhile, Batu’s chief wife, Boraqchin, was a powerful regent in the Jochid ulus. She enjoyed Möngke’s strong support and came from the Alchī-Tātār, an influential tribe in the political life of the Jochid ulus (Rashīd al-Dīn, 1994: v.1, 89). As Tuda-Möngke’s stepmother and marriage partner, she supported Tuda-Möngke’s to become the ruler of the Jochid ulus. She supposedly obtained permission from Möngke, and in 1256 secretly dispatched envoys to request Hülegü’s assistance. Mamluk sources state that when Boraqchin’s plot was revealed, she was executed by the amīrs who supported Berke (al-Manṣūrī, 1998: 14-17). Jūzjānī (1881-99: v.2, 1292) briefly mentions the ensuing violent purge in Jochi’s clan. Of the Ilkhanate’s historians, only Qazvīnī provides a brief and ambiguous description of the event (Qazvīnī, 1960: 585).\n\n30Berke was enthroned in 1257, and Möngke’s reaction was antagonistic, which is clearly borne out by Möngke’s dispensation of allotted territories in 1257. This dispensation benefitted many members of the imperial families and the nobility. In addition to the Toluids, even former political opponents were granted households, including the princes of the Ögödeid and Chagatayid uluses, who had been deprived of most of their apanages and subjects after 1251. It is noteworthy that no one from the Jochi clan was included on the distribution list. Instead, a considerable number of households in Pingyang, a traditional Jochid apanage, were transferred to the Toluids. For example, 1,100 households in Pingyang were granted to Princess Dumugan (du-mu-gan, 獨木干), daughter of Tolui, and Noqu noyan (nao-hu guanren, 猱虎官人), a Mongol official, was allotted 1,000 households (Song, 1978: 2427, 2436). In Central Asia, Hülegü, encouraged by Möngke, stopped paying revenue shares to Berke (Ayalon, 1971: 174).\n\n31Another suggestive action was Möngke’s appointment of Qitai (qi-dai, 乞歹), son of Qonggirad güregen (son-in-law) Lachin, as the daruγači in charge of internal security in Rus and Alania (Song, 1978: 50, 1570). In light of the recent political crisis and rumours that Berke had annexed the possessions of the Jochids who had opposed him, it is very likely that Qitai was not only appointed to oversee the registration of the population, as Allsen (1981: 41) suggested, but also to control Berke, which would reveal Möngke’s wariness of him. The Great Khan’s vigilance was justified, as Kolbas (2006: 146) pointed out, because Berke had not abided by previous agreements and started to mint independent coinage after 1257.\n\n32Möngke died in 1259 during the invasion of South Song, and since his eldest son, Baltu, had passed away before him, there was no appointed successor to the throne. Baltu’s younger brother, Qubilai, proclaimed himself Khan in Kaiping. Ariq-Böke, the Great Khan’s representative in Qaraqorum, followed his example and enthroned himself as Khan. This resulted in the Toluid Civil War, which involved all branches of the Chinggisid family.\n\n33The members of the two camps are recorded in the Yuanshi and by Vaṣṣāf respectively. These two sources provide complementary information. According to the Yuanshi, the list of the rewards issued in 1260 includes all of Qubilai’s actual and potential allies. Princes descended from Chinggis Khan’s brothers were the main supporters of Qubilai, and were granted 5,000 silver ingots per family. Apart from them, only a few minor princes from the Chagatayid and Ögödeid branches stayed in Qubilai’s camp. The list includes no members of the Jochid branch (Song, 1978: 68-69).\n\n34Vaṣṣāf reports that Ariq-Böke won the support of several influential princes of the Chagatayid and Ögödeid branches, including Möngke’s widow (Vaṣṣāf, 1960: 11). Berke’s support was especially crucial. During the last years of Möngke’s reign, Berke had become one of the most powerful persons in the empire, and his prestige in Central Asia and Iran had grown rapidly. According to a poetic adaption of the yarlïq addressed to Hülegü, Ariq-Böke said that his enthronement took place « after consulting with Barkāy, son of my uncle Jochi, who was the patriarch of the clan ». For this reason, his claim to the throne may have been considered more legitimate than Qubilai’s (Qazvīnī, 2010: v.8, 177).\n\n35Some of Qubilai’s advisers predicted the political climate very well, and warned Qubilai that the connection between China and Iran would likely be interrupted by « nomads of western regions » (xi-yu-zhu-hu, 西域諸胡), almost surely referring to Berke and his allies (Hao, 1738: v.32, 11). This prediction was based on more than hearsay. Udur’s son, Qarachar, joined Ariq-Böke’s army (Allsen, 1987: 17), and Mamluk historians mention Berke’s military aid against Qubilai and his subsequent defeat (Ibn Abī-l-Faḍā’il, 1919: 442-446).\n\n36Qubilai’s revenge was swift. He renounced Jochid interests in Iran and Central Asia to gain Hülegü and Alghu’s support (Rashīd al-Dīn, v.2, 880). In 1261, Qubilai furthermore accepted a local governor’s suggestion to revoke the Jochid apanage in Zhending (Ren: 1998, 22), and one year later Pingyang was also put under the direct administration of the central government (Song, 1978: 107). Of all the revenge measures implemented after Möngke’s enthronement, the revocation and change of the Jochid apanages were the most extreme.\n\n37When one considers these developments chronologically, it is difficult to assert that Islamisation played a key role in the conflict between the Jochids and the Toluids. In contrast to Islamic historians, who tend to emphasise the role of religion in the conflict (Jūzjānī, 1881-99: v.2, 1257; Rashīd al-Dīn, 1994: v.2, 1044; al-Yūnīnī, 1954-61: v.2, 365), the hostility can be attributed largely to pragmatic disputes over political and economic interests rather than religious disagreements. Both Möngke and Qubilai attempted to establish a centralised state, which infringed upon the interests of imperial relatives and conflicted with the tribal-based redistributive system. Therefore, contrary to the impression given by the historians of the Yuan and the Ilkhanate, Berke was more of a passive resister who tried to stand up to the Great Khan. However, his resistance always prompted a more severe reaction from the Great Khan. In Yuan China, contemporaries might easily conclude that the enmities between the Great Khan and the rebel princes were due to irreconcilable differences between nomadic values and Chinese political principles.\n\nGolden Horde and Yuan Dynasty Relationships in the Post-Berke Period\n\n41After Berke’s death (d. 1267), the tension between the Golden Horde and the Yuan Dynasty easened. At least, the emperor of the Yuan Dynasty no longer considered the Khan of the Jochid ulus an opponent threatening the north-western border of his territory. Around 1270, Qubilai sent envoys to confirm Möngke-Temür’s accession, which strengthened his legitimacy to run the affairs of the Jochid ulus. Qubilai even persuaded him not to cooperate with Qaidu, the independent Mongol ruler of the Ögödeid ulus. Nevertheless, Möngke-Temür’s policies were variable and pragmatic, and primarily aimed at defending his own authority and interests. He supported Qaidu in conflicts against Baraq and Abaqa, but generally speaking remained neutral and kept distant from the turmoil in the eastern territories. Qaidu once sent Nomqan, a son of Qubilai, as a captive to Möngke-Temür’s court, probably with the intention to involve Möngke-Temür in the anti-Qubilai alliance, but this attempt was unsuccessful. Nomqan was eventually released by Möngke-Temür’s successor, Tudan-Möngke. As a good-faith response to Tudan-Möngke, Yuan government newly constructed thirty postal stations from the Besh-Baliq to the Taihe Mountain (大和嶺, i.e. Caucasian Mountain) in the 1281, aiming to link the interior territory of the Golden Horde with China via the Chaghatai Khanate (Song, 1978: 1569).\n\n42 However, the foreign policy of the Golden Horde was strongly affected by the establishment of the anti-Ilkhanid alliance. The idea was that this alliance would consist of the Mamluk Sultanate, the Chagatai Khanate, and Qaidu’s ulus and attack the Ilkhanate from three directions. Despite the alliance’s limited success, the Golden Horde acted as a mediator, and adopted a somewhat unfriendly attitude towards the Yuan Dynasty, the Ilkhanate’s major ally. Mamluk chroniclers used to gloat over Qubilai’s military failure undisguisedly, and without a doubt this reflected the point of view of the Golden Horde. However, the succession to the throne of the Golden Horde was unstable, and consequently it was difficult for them to implement a coherent foreign policy on Far Eastern affairs.\n\n43The Yuan Dynasty allied with the head of the left-wing of the Jochid ulus, the descendants of Orda, in order to counterbalance their estrangement from the Khans of Saray. Qonichi, Orda’s successor, implemented an independent policy in his contact with the Yuan Dynasty and remained neutral in a series of conflicts (Akasaka, 2005: 156). In 1288 and 1289, the Yuan court twice aided prince Qonichi with silver and supplies (Song, 1978: 307, 320). Again, at the beginning of the 14th c. (1304-1312), the Yuan court constantly helped crown prince Bayan to resist attacks from claimants to the throne during the civil war (Qiu, 2013: 32-38).\n\n44As for the Khans of Saray, they found that confirmation by the Great Khan was still necessary to consolidate their legitimacy. Therefore, Möngke-Temür, Toqta, and Özbek dispatched envoys to request his confirmation and the concomitant edict, seal, and honorable princely title. In return, Möngke-Temür and Toqta issued coins and tablets with Chinese characters and Phags-pa Mongolian scripts respectively, which represented the symbolic authority of the Great Khan (Nyamaa, 2005: 106; Tumutogoo, 2010: 125). The Yuan court paid close attention to political developments within the Golden Horde. In 1305, one year after Toqta endorsed the peace agreement, the Yuan government aided in providing five-months’ provisions to Toqta’s Kirghiz subjects (Song, 1978: 465). With the centralisation of the administrative apparatus of the Yuan Dynasty, the Jochid state’s apanages in China were brought under the direct administration of the central government. The Directorate-General of the Territorial Office in Pingyang was dissolved in 1288, and integrated within local government (Song, 1978: 311; Cai, 2009: 121-122).\n\n45Only the descendants of Chinggis Khan, the Golden Kin, could rule within the Mongol Empire, and as a result the rulers of different khanates tended to view disputes among them as family affairs. The term brotherhood, in Mongolian aqa and de’ü (āqā wa-īnī in Persian), was used in diplomatic exchanges between the uluses, and gave these contacts a very different spirit from contacts with independent states (Kim, 2009: 33). For the Yuan Emperor, the unification of his relatives in harmonious brotherhood proved that his prestige covered the whole of the empire. Thus, the Toluid prince Yaqudu (ya-hu-du, 牙忽都) praised the achievement of the Great Khan Temür (r. 1294-1307) in these words:\n\nQubilai (shi-zu) had combined the whole world, but the princes of the imperial clan were unable to have a banquet together. Now, with Your Majesty’s limitless fortune, Batu Khan’s descendants showed their obedience first, and the rebel prince, Chapar, yielded with his clans subsequently. The peoples and lands unite as a family again (Song, 1978: 2909).\n\n47Since the reign of Sultan Baybars (r. 1260-1277), the Khan of the Golden Horde was involved in the long-distance trade between the Mamluk Sultanate and China. The Sultan’s commercial agents were entertained at Berke and Möngke-Temür’s courts, travelled through Golden Horde territory, and proceeded to Qaraqorum as far as the Yuan capital of Khanbaliq (Ibn Shaddād, 1983: 307-308). Mamluk commercial agents were also involved in the slave trade and obtained military and economic information about the Yuan Dynasty. In 1290, after defeating the Yuan garrison at Qaraqorum, Yuan captives were transferred to Egypt and sold as slaves in the market (al-Manṣūrī, 1998: 262). The diplomatic gifts presented by Janibek to Toghan-Temür (r. 1333-1370), including saqalāt (a kind of textile), a chachir (tent), a knife produced in Egypt, and Arabian horses, reflect the influence of Golden Horde-Mamluk commerce (Allsen, 1997: 75; Behrens-Abouseif, 2014: 61-65).\n\nConclusion\n\n48The relations between the Golden Horde and the Yuan Dynasty were not interrupted by the dissolution of the Mongol Empire. On the contrary, they were sustained until the collapse of the Yuan Dynasty. However, the nature of these relations changed over time. Originally, the ruler of the Golden Horde was seen as the Great Khan’s representative, but later he became an independent ruler with a junior status. After the de facto dissolution of the Mongol Empire, the Yuan Emperor was unwilling to abandon his self-identification as supreme sovereign of a united Mongol Empire in diplomatic contacts. Kinship relations and traditional customs continued to play essential roles in the interrelationship between the Yuan and the Golden Horde. Islamisation does not appear to have been as important as formerly thought in this relationship. Most disputes also had to do with political and economic factors."
