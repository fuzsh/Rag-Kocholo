        "meta_description": "L'Histoire fut une base importante de légitimation et de précédents pour le Moyen-Orient médiéval, à la fois pour les gouvernants et pour leurs sujets. En Iran et en Asie centrale, l'histoire la plus récente et la plus riche d'enseignement fut celle de la conquête et de la souveraineté mongoles ; ceci fut vrai pour les Iraniens comme pour la classe dirigeante turco-mongole. Dans l'histoire dynastique comme dans l'histoire régionale, nous percevons une constante élaboration des données, en particulier sur le problème de la division de l'empire mongol, et sur celui de l'islamisation. Dans cet article, l'auteur examine l'utilisation de l'histoire par divers dirigeants qui tentèrent d'accroître leur prestige et de légitimer leur gouvernement par une imitation active des souverains anciens et par la manipulation des souvenirs historiques. Par leurs actions publiques, Tamerlan et son rival Jötchide Tokhtamish, se réfèrent à la fois à la carrière de Gengis Khan et aux anciennes rivalités entre les Ilkhans et la Horde d'Or. Shāhrukh, qui utilisa l'islam comme partie intégrante de sa légitimisation, imita Ghazan, le khan islamisateur. Pour comprendre la carrière de ces chefs, nous devons comprendre les précédents historiques auxquels se référaient leurs actions et la façon dont ils voyaient l'histoire mongole.",

        "text": "3Before we can answer this question, we have to consider how the populations beyond the court circle thought about history. We understand a good deal about the writing of history and its formal patronage, but what has remained problematical is the identity of its audience. We are first of all uncertain about the readership of our most central sources — the major dynastic histories. The number of early copies surviving can give us a clue as to the level of popularity that a history enjoyed, but even the existence of a hundred manuscripts cannot tell us who the readers were. We are not always certain even that the recipient of the author's praise in the preface took the trouble to read the composition. The prestige of works over time can be gauged by their subsequent use in the compositions of later scholars — this however tells us only about their influence on professional historians.\n\n4The great historical compilations written for Mongol and Timurid rulers served as a formal statement of legitimation and of the dynasty's place in history, but in their original form they probably reached only a small proportion of the politically active population. They could justify the dynasty to its intellectual elite, and perhaps more importantly, to the reading audience of the future, but they probably did not have a wide impact on the present. To discover broadly based historical traditions and debates, it is useful to go to sources which preserve more informal traditions, those which have been less stringently selected and edited : correspondence, local histories and geographical works incorporating reports by travellers and merchants. What is illuminating in such sources is not the accuracy of accounts but the variety of different versions of the same story, and the way in which important questions reappear with ever increasing numbers of answers offered. A particularly rich example is the geographical work by the Mamluk author, al-'Umari (p. 17, 29-37), based in part on conversations with a wide variety of people outside the court circle, some of whom are explicitly named in the text. What we see here is the echo of conversations, of claims and counterclaims, within a population whose involvement with history was not confined to the reading of a standard canon.\n\n5If a ruler was to reach this broader audience, he had to go beyond the written word, and resort to action. To a population which revered the great figures of the past and which considered precedence an important justification for action, the imitation of past rulers was a language both understandable and powerful. I suggest that if we look at the actions of three people in the late Mongol world — Temür, his Jöchid rival Tokhtamish, and his son Shāhrukh, we will see that they followed the advice of their historians. They took models from the great rulers of the past and by imitating their actions, claimed some share in their legitimacy and charisma.\n\n6To understand the actions and motivations of these rulers, we should first try to gain an understanding of how history was understood at their time by the people whose support they required — not only ulama and bureaucrats, but also military figures and local dynasties. When we reconstruct the drama of the past as it was perceived by this population, we are better able to appreciate the historical precedents to which the actions of contemporary rulers refer and to understand the resonance these actions held for contemporaries.\n\nThe Audience for Mongol History\n\n7If we consider history as an instrument to explain and justify the status quo, then to identify its consumers we should look for those whose position depends on it. In the society of 14th-15th century Iran and Central Asia, Turkic and Iranian alike, the events which had shaped the present most immediately were those of Mongol conquest and rule. The drama of the Mongol invasion, the administration of the great khans, and the rivalries of the Chinggisid uluses mattered to many people beyond the Chinggisid dynasty itself.\n\n9We expect the preservation of Mongol genealogies in works commissioned by rulers depending directly on Mongol tradition, such as that of Rashid al-Din or its continuation by Hāfiz-i Abrü in the Timurid period. What is less expected is the importance given to the Mongol elite in histories presenting regional events. The historians of provincial origin, Sayfi Haravi and Muhammad Shabānkāra'i from the early to mid-fourteenth century, Faryümadï and Natanzi from the later fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, who include in their compendiums a regional view of history, illustrate strikingly how deeply Mongol rule had penetrated Iranian politics.\n\n10We find, for instance, in Faryūmadi's rescension and continuation of Shabānkāra'i's work, written in the 1380s for the vizier Najm al-Din al-Bayhaqi in Māzandarān or Khorāsān, the history of several Mongol lineages — the descendants of the great Mongol commanders, Buqa, Arghun, Qutluqshāh and others. These lineages had remained powerful in the Iranian provinces, sometimes independently, sometimes serving one or another local ruler (Shabānkāra'i, p. 322-325, 345).\n\nThe Living Dramas of Mongol History\n\n15There are two striking features about later Mongol consciousness as it emerges from Islamic historical works. One is the long life of its central controversies and their continuous elaboration over time. The other is the extent to which people remained involved in the Mongol Empire as a whole, long after it had broken up into separate states. When we look at the histories written in the late 14th century, we still find an active interest in the whole of the Mongol Empire, and when we examine the actions of Chinggisid and Turco-Mongolian rulers, we find the same consciousness at work. An ambitious man might rise to power within one Mongol successor state, but the stage on which he acted and the audience to which he appealed represented the whole of the Mongol heritage.\n\n20This variety of viewpoints within individual Mongol states reflects their paths of development within Mongol history as a whole. We should remember that each important Mongol conquest army had included personnel from the four major Chinggisid houses, and that settled lands were administered in common, with agents representing each house. Frequent disagreements over territorial and fiscal rights kept partisanship alive within these areas. After the division of the Mongol empire into separate states, exchanges of populations continued. Borders changed, dissident princes, tribes and emirs found a ready welcome from rival Mongol rulers, ulama and others sought refuge in more settled or congenial territory, and prisoners of war served in new places under new masters. In the fourteenth century the division of the Chaghadayid state and its expansion into eastern Afghanistan, the collapse of the Ilkhanid dynasty and, finally, the Timurid conquests, all brought political upheavals and large exchanges of population. The territorial division of the Mongol realm then did not end the concerns of a common culture and a common history ; indeed the controversies surrounding this division kept them alive. In almost any area of the Middle East and Central Asia, a person asking about Mongol history would hear versions representing several different Chinggisid houses.\n\nThe Duel between Temür and Tokhtamish\n\n21The careers of the two great Turco-Mongolian leaders and rivals of the late fourteenth century — Temür and Tokhtamish — illustrate clearly both their conciousness of acting within the Mongol Empire as a whole, and their manipulation of its symbols for an audience still concerned with the controversies of Mongol history. They were able to evoke in their own actions the success and grandeur of past Mongol leaders and, in so doing, to claim a right to the full heritage of their models.\n\n22Temür and Tokhtamish had of course some natural resemblance to earlier Mongol rulers, a likeness of lifestyle, goals and circumstance. This can account for some similarities, but I would argue that many of their actions were deliberate imitations designed to profit from the charisma of a ruler whom they wished to resemble. We should consider when judging their behavior that we see these people from a long distance in time and space. Our distance makes Mongol history appear shorter than it was in the living, and the differences between generations smaller than they may actually have been. It may seem natural to us that the nomad ruler of late fourteenth-century Transoxiana should act like the early thirteenth-century conqueror from Mongolia, but in fact these men arose in distant and very different societies. Nor were Iran and the Qipchaq steppe quite the same in 1 400 as they had been in 1 220. If, then, men of the late fourteenth and fifteenth century acted like their forbears of the thirteenth, they may have done so deliberately. They may in fact have known about these men approximately what we know — what has come down to us through the writings of their time.\n\n28In this way Tokhtamish recreated the Golden Horde policy of alliance with the Mamluks and enmity against the Ilkhans, also reasserting Jöchid claims over the Caucasus and Azarbāijān. This is a logical policy, but we should remember that it had been in abeyance for some time. Uzbek Khan had maintained close, though not always cordial, relations with the Mamluks, and at the same time had strongly asserted Jochid claims over Azarbāijān. After his death in 1341 both these policies became less central to Golden Horde rulers, in part due to the disappearance of the Ilkhans. Uzbek's son and successor Janibeg was the last to practice either ; he sent an embassy to Egypt on his accession, and again when he took Tabriz in 1357. Aside from these embassies, relations between the Mamluks and the Golden Horde seem to have languished during Janibeg's reign. After Janibeg's death on his return from Tabriz in 1357, the Golden Horde succumbed to internal struggles, and its khans ceased to meddle in the Middle East (Zakirov, 1966, p. 74-92).\n\n32In the latter part of his career Temür displayed himself clearly as a second Chinggis Khan — in his ceremonial, his exemplary destruction of recalcitrant cities and even in the division of his realm into four sections, one for the family of each son. He died on his way to China, the one section of the Mongol Empire that he had not yet conquered.\n\nThe Drama of Islamization\n\n34By the mid-fourteenth century the conversion of the Mongol ruling class was relatively complete, but Mongol rule had given new life to the constant issue of Islamization. It is clear from the histories of the late Mongol period that the question of how to accommodate the claims of Islam with Mongolian legitimacy, of shari'a and yasa, remained an important issue for Iranians and Turco-Mongolians alike. This arose over and over again, treated in different ways according to the views of the author and the exigencies of the moment. There were various ways of recognizing the present Turco-Mongolian rulers both as Mongols and Muslims. One solution to the problem was to suggest that the Mongolian tradition, if properly understood, was compatible with Islam. One finds Chinggis Khan as a man singled out and blessed by God, who, had he only been Muslim, could have been regarded as having an element of prophecy (va agar ū rā sharaf-i islām hāsil budi, mitavānast guft ki az nabwat bā bahra būda ast). He had prayed to God despite his non-Muslim status (Shabānkāra'i, p. 223-224, 227).\n\n36The conflict between Ögedei and Chaghadai was echoed numerous times within the Mongol states, as rulers converted to Islam and tried to bring Mongol rule into conformity with Islamic norms without sacrificing their attachment to the Mongol yasa. Some rulers, such as the Ilkhan Ahmad Khan and the Chaghadayid Tarmashirin Khan, failed to achieve a balance and lost their positions, sometimes their lives. Others, like the later Ilkhan Ghazan and Uzbek Khan of the Golden Horde, succeeded brilliantly, in part probably because substantial numbers of their followers had already converted. These men then became the initiators of a new Islamic age. To many within the system the conformity of yasa and shari‘a, — at any rate the absence of conflict — was a possibility, and respect for both was quite feasible. In the Ilkhanid move towards Islamization, we find powerful Mongol emirs just as strongly involved as Persian viziers (Aubin, 1995, p. 59-60, 68). It was not only the Mongols who adjusted to coexistence. Iranians, on their side, sometimes found it useful to call on the yasa. The early Kartid ruler, Shams al-Din, was noted for his knowledge of Mongol law, and in one of his braver moments, he even punished a young Mongol emir for trespassing against it (Sayfi, p. 151-152,192-194).\n\n42It is clear that Shāhrukh wished to present himself as a restorer of the Islamic order. Nonetheless, we still find him retaining the Mongol tradition. In this he was also following the precedent of his model, Ghazan, who, while restoring Islam, saw no need to abandon the Mongol order. Rashid al-Din presented Ghazan as another Abraham — a man breaking with the traditions of his ancestors to found a new religious order, and also, we should note, a new and blessed lineage. At the same time, Rashid al-Din emphasized Ghazan's expertise in Mongol tradition and his desire to preserve and record this heritage (Rashid al-Din, I, p. 40-70).\n\n43Shāhrukh likewise took steps to preserve his Turco-Mongolian heritage, and it is here that his evocation of Ghazan's memory becomes most obvious. Shāhrukh's major act of literary patronage was to collect the manuscripts of Rashid al-Din's Jāmi' al-tawārikh, and commission its continuation by Hāfiz-i Abrū in 820/1417-8 ; some years later Hāfiz-i Abrū produced a new synthetic version of this compilation. The early manuscripts of the resulting work, the Majma' al-tawārikh, were illustrated so solidly within the Ilkhanid style that modern scholars until recently misdated them (Ettinghausen, 1955, p. 30-44). Shortly after this, in 830/1426-7, Shāhrukh ordered an updated rescension of Rashid al-Din's other major work for Ghazan, the Mongol genealogy Shu‘ab-i panjgāna (Mu‘izz al-ansāb, fol. 1b-3b). This genealogy, whose author is unknown, is called the Mu‘izz al-ansāb fi shajarāt al-ansāb ; it traces the four major Chinggisid lineages up to the time of writing and gives the genealogy of the Barlas tribe from its ancestor Qarachar, whose close connection with the Chaghadayid house is emphasized.\n\n44Shāhrukh imitated Ghazan likewise in his more visible actions. One of these was his attempt to gain influence in the Hijāz and, in particular, to send a kiswa (cover) for the Ka'ba as Ghazan had tried to do. During the early Mongol period, the Mamluks had positioned themselves as the protectors of Islam within the Middle East ; this claim had not challenged the pagan Ilkhans, but an Islamic Mongol dynasty could not let it go uncontested. Ghazan, when he turned Iran back into a Muslim power, ended the division of the Middle East into Muslim and non-Muslim spheres, but instead of bringing peace with the Mamluks, he opened up a new theater of conflict in the Hijāz. In 702/1303, just before his final invasion of Syria, Ghazan issued a decree in favor of the guardians of the Ka'ba and prepared a magnificent caravan with a large guard and a cover for the Ka‘ba. This expedition was attacked and never arrived, but the Ilkhanids continued through the reign of Abû Sa'id sporadically to push their claims in the Hijāz and their right to contribute a cover (Melville, 1992, p. 197-211).\n\n46Shāhrukh's identification with the Ilkhans was probably one reason why he was willing to expend so much effort on the thankless task of holding Azarbāijān. While he left the defense of his eastern frontiers to the increasingly ineffectual Ulugh Beg, and left his son Ibrāhim Sultān to campaign in southern Iran, Shāhrukh undertook the Azarbāijān campaigns in person, and with a large army. Real control over Azarbāijān was beyond his grasp, as it had been beyond Temür's, but he succeeded fairly constantly in keeping his own governor over Sultāniyya and in maintaining a nominal overlordship over Azarbāijān. It is interesting that the rulers of that region in particular routinely referred to Shāhrukh and his government as « Ilkhāni » (Navā'i, p. 165,171-172, 176).\n\nConclusion\n\n48The rulers of the late Mongol period lived in a society highly conscious of history and accustomed to turn to historical precedents to justify their own actions and to understand those of others. The most recent, vivid, and encompassing history was that of Mongol conquest and rule, which had molded the lives of Iranians, Turks and Mongols alike.\n\n49In an age where the written word circulated slowly, rulers had to use a variety of methods to legitimize their rule in the eyes of their followers. The erection of public buildings and the arrangement of magnificent ceremonies were important factors in creating an image, and have been appropriately studied. I suggest that beyond this, rulers could and did evoke historical precedent through their actions, and sought a share in the charisma of earlier rulers by imitating their lives. To understand fully the motivation of these men, we should consider not only the tactical considerations and accepted practice of the time. We will understand best if we examine actions within a specific historical tradition whose heroes, controversies and images were familiar and important to leaders, followers and subjects alike. This was a history which was manipulated not only in books, but also in actions, not only rewritten but also relived."
