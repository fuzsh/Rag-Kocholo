        "text": "Temür (born 1265, China—died 1307, China) was the grandson and successor of the great Kublai Khan; he ruled (1295–1307) as emperor of the Yuan (Mongol) dynasty (1206–1368) of China and as great khan of the Mongol Empire. He was the last Yuan ruler to maintain firm control over China, but he never exercised real power over Mongol territories in Russia and the Middle East.\n\nTemür staved off attacks from disputants to the throne on the northwestern border of China and put down rebellions in Korea and South China. He fought the large-scale corruption within his empire. After his death, the power of the court and the empire began to disintegrate. He was given the posthumous temple name Chengzong (“Accomplished Ancestor”)."
