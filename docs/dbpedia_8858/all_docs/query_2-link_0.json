        "text": "Il-Khanid dynasty, Mongol dynasty that ruled in Iran from 1256 to 1335. Il-khan is Persian for “subordinate khan.”\n\nHülegü, a grandson of Genghis Khan, was given the task of capturing Iran by the paramount Mongol chieftain Möngke. Hülegü set out in about 1253 with a Mongol army of about 130,000. He founded the Il-Khanid dynasty in 1256, and by 1258 he had captured Baghdad and all of Iran. The Il-Khans consolidated their position in Iran and reunited the region as a political and territorial entity after several centuries of fragmented rule by petty dynasties. During the reign of the Il-Khanid Maḥmūd Ghāzān (reigned 1295–1304), the Il-Khans lost all contact with the remaining Mongol chieftains of China. Maḥmūd Ghāzān himself embraced Sunni Islam, and his reign was a period of Iranian cultural renaissance in which such scholars as Rashīd al-Dīn flourished under his patronage.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nIslamic arts: Mongol Iran: Il-Khanid and Timurid periods"
