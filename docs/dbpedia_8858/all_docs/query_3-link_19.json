Within extensive cross-continental networks of diplomatic and commercial activity, Ilkhanid Buddhism and the Buddhist revival of which it was a part drew serious attention among contemporary travelers, scholars, and statesmen including Ibn Taymiyah, Roger Bacon, and Rashid al-Din. This article argues that awareness of a Buddhist scholarly and political elite in the Muslim heartland, with its center at Tabriz, generated a historically significant Eurasian Buddhist discourse during a critical passage in the turn to modernity.\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\nComparative Studies in Society and History , Volume 56 , Issue 3 , July 2014 , pp. 650 - 680\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0010417514000280 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Society for the Comparative Study of Society and History 2014\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.
