This makes it more accessible for international students who may not be fluent in French.\n\nAdmissions for International Students\n\nInternational Selection: Each year, ENS opens a competitive selection process for international students, allowing a small number of exceptionally talented students to enroll. This process typically includes a review of the applicant’s academic records and proposed research project.\n\nLanguage Requirements: Proficiency in French is required for most programs, although some science and economics courses might be in English.

This process, while slightly less competitive than the \"concours,\" still has a low acceptance rate due to the high number of applicants from around the world and the limited number of places available.\n\nGraduate Programs:\n\nThe acceptance rates for Master’s and PhD programs can vary depending on the specific department and program. Admission to these programs typically involves an application that includes academic transcripts, a research proposal, and interviews. The selectivity for these programs is also quite high, reflecting the institution’s overall competitiveness.\n\nDepartmental Differences:\n\nAcceptance rates may vary significantly across different departments depending on the number of applicants, the specific criteria used for selection, and the nature of the competition.\n\nCampus Location of Ecole Normale Superieure, France\n\nParis Campus\n\nLocation: The historical main campus of ENS is situated in the Latin Quarter of Paris, specifically at 45 rue d’Ulm, Paris 5th arrondissement.
