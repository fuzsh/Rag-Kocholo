        "text": "Has a post-neoliberal policy regime emerged from the the challenges to neoliberalism that accompanied the rise of nationalism and populism in some Eastern and Central European countries? Why has the political organization of these challenges to neoliberalism endured in some countries but not in others? By drawing on a mix of primary and secondary sources culled from the institutional, political and economic realities of Hungary and Romania, this paper suggests makes two claims. First, in these challenges amounted to a distinctive variety of neoliberalism: \"national-neoliberalism.\" At its core one finds the slightly modified old goals of neoliberal orthodoxy embedded in a protective cocoon of orthodox and unorthodox policy instruments. The second claim of the paper is that the political organization national-neoliberal project was resilient in Hungary but not in Romania not only because the \"national\" elements of national-neoliberalism had protections against the bond markets, but also because the proponents of this project could manage a broader social bloc and deployed techno-political capabilities that bolstered their political power relative to that of challengers and buffered the impact of external structural forces. As such, the paper rejects the hypothesis about a nationalist-heterodox successor to neoliberalism and provides a comprehensive theory of policy resilience for nationalneoliberalism.\n\nThe study captures how global neoliberalism has been localized starting from the end of the 2000s, acquiring particular relevance and significance in post-socialist Romania, newly integrated in the European Union. Moreover, it observes that especially from 2010, while neoliberalism has been constructed and justified as the political recipe or the alleged solution for economic crisis, it solidified as The takenfor-granted political economy of the country. The analysis goes through the presidential speeches between 2009 and 2011 that have transformed the provisions of the economic policy of the European Union, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in discursive justifications that made sense in Romanian context, most importantly framing them as the demand for reforming the state. Furthermore, the analysis descends into the contexts of two settlements from Romania to show how local actors translate/produce the neoliberal model of development, and how they articulate visions of neoliberal entrepreneurial competition and culture in local development programs. Eventually the paper observes how nowadays in Romania too, neoliberal governance reinvents itself by transferring the social role of the state to 'local communities' and demands from them competitiveness in the vein of a \"community-led local development\" paradigm, which is a new tool of neoliberal governmentality that re-creates the relationship between the citizen and the state.\n\nThis paper proposes a usable definition of neoliberalism that avoids its excessively narrow and broad definitions and, hopefully, the intellectual confusion that surrounds this popular term. As such, it focuses on economic theories and schools of thought as the core of neoliberal coordinative discourse, with Spain, the IMF, Romania and Brazil providing the main illustrations. By calling on political economists to engage more systematically with economic theory and history, the paper defines neoliberalism as a set historically contingent and intellectually hybrid economic ideas and policy regimes derived from specific economic theories whose distinctive and shared goals are financial market credibility, trade and financial openness and the safeguarding of internal and external competitiveness.\n\nABSTRACT: The growing interest in neoliberalism and neoliberalisation has produced a wave of academic production, but also criticisms toward these concepts. They concern the conditions under which they may actually work as both/either explanans and/or explanandum of transformations affecting contemporary societies. The main accusations made are presented and compared with the actual uses of these catego-ries, building above all on the applications made in the articles that follow in this special issue. It is argued that this pair of concepts may help to detect critical processes descriptively, but so far it has not been able to provide explanations. Working more as descriptors, or identifiers of processes and out-comes they, rather, provide indirect paths to explanation, by becoming explananda themselves. It is easier to understand the “why” of social processes and changes starting from these concepts and turning to oth-er “real” theories than by direct use of them. In order to do that we need to operationalize neoliberalism and neoliberalisation as articulated ideal types, so as to take into account the existing varieties of policies, practices and relationships. This is still to be done and looks a lot like being a collective effort based on cumulative research and theorization.\n\nWe seek to disentangle the process through which some democratic polities ‘escape’ from neoliberal rule while others do not. We understand neoliberalism as the resulting equilibrium provoked by the restoration of class power that undermined the pro-labour policies of the post-war period. Why do some democracies enter a route of political experimentation that challenges the status quo while others remain ‘trapped’ in an orthodox neoliberal settlement? Our argument is that for a democratic polity to initiate a transition from neoliberal rule, there needs to be a crisis of neoliberal rule, a compelling alternative willing to contend for state power in national elections, and a reliable democratic settlement that allows the victory of the challenger – that is, the alternative – over the neoliberal rulers. This model will be discussed by examining the following three cases: Argentina, Greece, and Mexico."
