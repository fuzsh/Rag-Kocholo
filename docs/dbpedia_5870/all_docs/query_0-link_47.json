I want to thank all the scientists and historians who have created the research that this book draws upon. I also want to thank the series editor, William E. Burns; my editors at ABC-CLIO, Simon Mason and Carla Roberts; and my copy editor, Silvine Farnell. My family also supported me with their enthusiasm for science and allowing me too much time squirreled away in my study. Eric G. Swedin Weber State University\n\nThis encyclopedia is organized so that approximately half of the entries are biographies of people and the other half cover topics. Alas, I could not include everything. My goals have been both breadth and selected depth. Individual scientists have been selected for inclusion both based on how important their discoveries were and in an attempt to have a broad representation of the different scientific disciplines.Topics are examined in a depth in proportion to how much change has occurred in that scientific area since 1950.\n\nxii\n\nIntroduction\n\nWorld War II neatly divides the twentieth century in almost every historical way imaginable. Few people on Earth were unaffected by that titanic struggle. Old empires ended, ideologies gained fresh power, and science and technology gained a sharp boost.World War II has also been called the physicists’ war because scientists and engineers developed many important weapons that fundamentally changed the course of the war, including rockets, radar, proximity fuses, the electronic computer, and the mightiest weapon of all, the atomic bomb. (See Nuclear Physics; Physics.) The American economy boomed during World War II for many reasons, including a sense of shared purpose, the expansion of military forces that solved unemployment problems, and massive armaments spending that kept factories running at full capacity. Significant scientific and technological innovation occurred during the war, and that innovation, combined with prudent government economic policies, helped fuel the postwar economic boom. Multiple economic studies have found that scientific and technological research lead to greater productivity and economic growth. At the end of the war, the United States dominated the world, its gross national product making up half of the world economy. This enabled Americans to expand their extensive higher education system and to pour money into scientific and technological research. (See National Institutes of Health; Universities.)\n\nThe United States became scientifically assertive during the postwar years. Many scientists, especially Jewish scientists from Germany, had fled to the United States and continued their work in their new home.The electrical engineer Vannevar Bush (1890– 1974) directed the American Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War II. As the war drew to an end, Bush wrote an influential report arguing for continued federal spending to develop new science and technology. His report led Congress to create the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 1950. (See National Science Foundation.) The destruction of the war in Europe and Japan retarded the practice of science in those areas for at least a decade after the war. After economic recovery, the practice of science was revitalized in Europe and Japan. The United States, the Soviet Union, the other developed nations in Europe, China, and Japan—all engaged in big science projects, mostly related to developing nuclear weapons or nuclear energy. (See Big Science.) Despite the continuing prestige of the U.S. graduate education system, by the end of the century, thirteen other countries, including Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and a number of European nations, produced more college graduates with science, engineering, or technology degrees on a per capita basis than the United States. (See Third World Science.)\n\nxiv\n\nxv\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the United States and other nations, the number of women and minorities going into science blossomed after World War II, as prejudices within the scientific community declined and the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s opened up opportunities for women and minorities. Nevertheless, at the end of the century, women and minorities were not represented in any of the scientific disciplines in proportion to their numbers in the general population, even though more women than men were going to college, and more minorities than ever before were going to college. In physics, only 10 percent of doctorates went to women in 2000, and less than 2 percent went to minorities. Scientific and technological research requires funding. Some funding comes from their own pockets, but most scientists must turn to other resources: a commercial enterprise, an educational institution, a private foundation, local government, national government, or international organizations. (See Foundations.) The history of science is more than just the work of scientists; it includes the work of science popularizers, attitudes toward science held by the lay public, and the scholarly examination of science. Science popularizers use books, science museums, the media, and education to translate complex scientific concepts for the lay audience. They also try to convey the wonder of science. (See Asimov, Isaac; Clarke, Arthur C.; Cousteau, Jacques; Gould, Stephen Jay; Hawking, Stephen; Hoyle, Fred; Media and Popular Culture; National Geographic Society; Sagan, Carl; Wilson, Edward O.) Science fiction also partially serves this function. (See Science Fiction.) Historians, philosophers, and sociologists have also studied the actual practice of science. (See Big Science; History of Science; Kuhn, Thomas S.; Philosophy of Science; Popper, Karl; Social Constructionism; Sociology of Science.) Feminist scholars have critiqued both the practice and conclusions of science. (See Feminism.)\n\nScience since World War II has been dominated by nine themes: the cold war, space exploration, undersea exploration, physics, new tools, the life sciences, earth science, medicine, studying humans, and environmentalism. The Cold War The cold war pitted the ideology of democracy and free markets, supported by the United States and its allies, against communism and Marxist economics, supported by the Soviet Union and its allies. The conflict led directly to the hydrogen bomb in 1952 and the continuing nuclear arms race. (See Cold War; Economics; Hydrogen Bomb; Oppenheimer, J. Robert; Sakharov, Andrei; Soviet Academy of Sciences; Soviet Union; Teller, Edward; War.) Both the superpowers poured funding and talent into scientific and technological research, seeking strategic military advantage and each striving to show that its political ideology was best suited to the goal of scientific progress. The launch of Sputnik I, the first artificial satellite, in 1957 opened a new frontier in the cold war ideological struggle. (See Satellites.) Space Exploration Earth is a very small part of the universe. In 1950, only science fiction writers and a few far-sighted scientists recognized the value of artificial satellites or dreamed of sending human explorers beyond the atmosphere. The International Geophysical Year of 1957–1958 provided an opportunity for military ballistic rocket programs in the United States and Soviet Union to turn their attention briefly to placing an artificial satellite in orbit. (See International Geophysical Year.) The Soviets succeeded first in 1957 with Sputnik I, which shocked the Americans and launched a space race, fueled by the ideological competition of the cold war. (See Satellites.) The United States founded the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958 and transferred the\n\nIntroduction\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, from army control to NASA. (See National Aeronautics and Space Administration.) JPL runs all of NASA’s lunar and interplanetary unmanned scientific missions. (See Jet Propulsion Laboratory.) In response to the Soviets placing the first person in orbit in 1961, the United States created the Apollo project to put the first person on the Moon by the end of the decade. Apollo 11 succeeded in 1969. (See Apollo Project.) In 1969, men walked on the Moon, the highlight of the manned space program. Only twelve astronauts visited the Moon before the Apollo project foundered on budget cuts and the lack of planned sequels that could sufficiently motivate the country to continue the effort. Although the manned space program remained the priority for both superpowers, enough money has been set aside for unmanned spacecraft programs that these ventures have been able to revolutionize planetary astronomy. (See Space Exploration and Space Science.) By the end of the century, NASA had sent spacecraft to every planet except Pluto. The Soviets sent landers or spacecraft to the Moon,Venus, and Mars.The Europeans became involved after the founding of the European Space Agency (ESA) in 1975, sending spacecraft on solar exploration missions and on joint ESA-NASA efforts. (See European Space Agency.) These spacecraft have discovered that Venus is a hellish place with melting surface temperatures caused by a runaway greenhouse effect. Mercury is covered with craters like Earth’s Moon. Mars also has numerous craters, along with a massive extinct volcano higher than anything on Earth and a canyon stretching partway around the planet that puts the Grand Canyon in Arizona to shame. The thin atmosphere of Mars has failed to quickly erode these natural wonders, unlike the thick atmosphere of Earth. Although Mars now contains small amounts of water vapor and ice, scientists have found intriguing\n\nxvi\n\nhints that flowing water once shaped the Martian landscape, raising hopes that while life may not currently exist on Mars, bacterial life might once have existed millions or billions of years in the past. A meteorite recovered from Antarctica shows possible evidence of microfossils from bacteria, but the evidence is hotly contested. The gas planets have been visited by multiple spacecraft, including the twin Voyager spacecraft in the late 1970s and 1980s. Photographs transmitted back from the spacecraft show numerous new moons, erupting volcanoes on Jupiter’s moon Io, and possible frozen oceans on the larger moons, and revealed that all the gas giants have systems of rings girdling the planet. (SeeVoyager Spacecraft.) The search for possible life has provided a major motivation for all the interplanetary exploration by robotic spacecraft, though no scientist expects to find anything more advanced than bacterial life. Scientists do hope to find evidence of intelligent extraterrestrial life around other stars, and in 1960 they began to search in earnest for radio signals from other stars or galaxies as part of SETI, or the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. (See Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.) So far their efforts have found nothing. The geologist Eugene Shoemaker spent a lifetime identifying meteor impact craters on the surface of Earth and searching the solar system via a telescope for asteroids or comets that might hit Earth. His effort resulted in the 1993 discovery of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet, which then collided with Jupiter in a spectacular display watched by astronomers from around the world. (See Shoemaker, Eugene; Shoemaker-Levy Comet Impact.) The father-son team of Luis W. Alvarez and Walter Alvarez, a physicist and a geologist, advanced the theory that an asteroid or large comet had hit Earth 65 million years ago, causing climatic change and the extinction of the dinosaurs. The evidence for this collision is found in a worldwide layer of iridium at the\n\nxvii\n\nIntroduction\n\nsame stratigraphic level, a layer of iridium that comes from extraterrestrial sources; the actual crater was later identified in Mexico. (See Alvarez, Luis W., and Walter Alvarez.) In 1908 a comet or asteroid exploded in the air over Tunguska, Siberia, devastating a large expanse of forest. Scientists now realize that catastrophic events happen more often than previously suspected, with dramatic impact on the natural environment. Undersea Exploration Outer space has revealed new wonders, and the oceans, covering two-thirds of the planet, also hide their own wonders, now being revealed. (See Undersea Exploration.) The French naval officer Jacques Cousteau invented the Aqua-Lung in 1943 and opened up the near-surface environment to ready scientific exploration. Cousteau later traveled the world in his research ship, the Calypso, making documentaries while engaged in oceanographic research. (See Cousteau, Jacques; Oceanography.) In 1960, the bathyscaphe Trieste descended to the deepest point in any of the oceans at the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean. In 1977, the deep-sea submersible Alvin discovered, in the Galapagos Rift near the Galapagos Islands at about 2,700 meters, deep-sea hydrothermal vents, geological marvels that sustain a unique new ecology not based on photosynthesis. Some scientists argue that life on Earth first emerged at such sites. (See Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vents; Geology.) The International Geophysical Year also provided an opportunity for oceanographic studies, especially of the role of the oceans in meteorology (See International Geophysical Year; Meteorology.) Studies of the ocean floor, finding rifts and magnetic patterns in cooled magma, directly led to the theory of plate tectonics. (See Plate Tectonics.) Despite tremendous advances in technology and our growing understanding of the oceans, much beneath the waves remains a mystery.\n\nPhysics The explosion of the atomic bomb in 1945 symbolized the new discoveries of relativity and quantum mechanics. Catapulted to prominence by nuclear weapons, physicists also continued trying to find the fundamental building blocks of matter, as well as reaching out into the farthest regions of space, producing theories about the beginning of time, using computers to create sophisticated models of chaotic systems, and seeking a grand unified theory to explain all physics. (See Chaos Theory; Grand Unified Theory; Mathematics; Physics.) There were occasional disappointments, including the failed effort to develop commercial fusion reactors, and the cold fusion debacle of 1989 showed that scientists should verify their experimental results and follow the normal process of announcing their breakthroughs at conferences and publishing in peer-reviewed journals. (See Cold Fusion; Nuclear Physics.) Since World War II, nuclear physicists have used cloud chambers and then particle accelerators to smash particles into ever smaller particles, tracking the subatomic particles that persist briefly before decaying. (See Particle Accelerators; Particle Physics). In 1953, the physicist Murray Gell-Mann proposed the property of strangeness to organize the numerous subatomic particles that had been discovered. In 1964, Gell-Mann proposed a new type of fundamental matter, called quarks and anti-quarks, as forming subatomic particles. Quark theory is now part of the standard model that attempts to combine the four basic forces (weak nuclear force, strong nuclear force, electromagnetism, and gravity). (See Gell-Mann, Murray; Neutrinos). Another foundation of the standard model came in the 1950s through the work of Richard P. Feynman, Julian Schwinger, Shinichiro Tomonaga, and Freeman Dyson to reform the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED). (See Dyson, Freeman; Feynman, Richard; Schwinger, Julian.) Yoichiro Nambu began\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe development of string theory in 1970 when he proposed that quarks act as if they were connected by strings. Developed extensively during the 1980s, string theory deals with multidimensional mathematics and hypothetical strings that are near the Planck length in size, and thus too small for instruments to detect them. (See Nambu, Yoichiro.) Since 1950, physicists have continued to discover phenomena that no one had suspected: not only quarks and other fundamental building blocks of matter, but quasars, pulsars, and black holes. Astronomers have even found direct evidence of planets orbiting other stars. (See Astronomy; Black Holes; Extrasolar Planets; Pulsars; Quasars.) The theorists who developed the Big Bang theory asserted that the universe had been created from a primordial concentration of mass and energy in a single point, a singularity. The astronomer Fred Hoyle developed the steady state theory, which argued that matter was being continuously created as the universe expanded. During the 1950s, debate raged between supporters of the two theories, but the discovery in 1964 of a constant background radiation to the universe fit the Big Bang theory, and most astronomers came to support that theory. (See Big Bang Theory and Steady State Theory; Gamow, George; Hoyle, Fred.) New Tools The most important technological advances since 1950 have been computers and space travel. Digital electronic computers came into being as a result of projects in World War II to create machines to help in code breaking and to create artillery ballistic tables. The mathematical genius John von Neumann took this early work and laid the theoretical basis for modern computing. (See Computers; Neumann, John von.) John Bardeen, William Shockley, and Walter H. Brattain invented the transistor in 1947 at Bell Telephone Laboratories, which led to\n\nxviii\n\nthe development of integrated circuits in the late 1950s. (See Bardeen, John; Integrated Circuits.) Integrated circuits led to microprocessors, which are complete computers on a single chip. Engineers developed networks in the late 1960s to enable computers to communicate with other computers, with ARPAnet coming online with four nodes in 1969. Founded by the United States defense department, ARPAnet grew into the Internet, a worldwide network of networks. The programmer Tim Berners-Lee developed the World Wide Web in 1991, an easy way to use the Internet. (See Berners-Lee, Timothy; Internet.) Computers and networks made it easier for scientists to communicate with each other, as well as to delve into new fields where computers made the onerous burden of repetitive mathematics manageable. Chaos theory and the theories of complexity could not have arisen without computers. (See Chaos Theory.) Another important new tool for scientists is deep-core drilling to retrieve samples from deep in the earth, under the seabed, or from ice sheets. Ice cores can reveal past climatic conditions and help scientists understand the current phenomenon of global warming. (See Deep-Core Drilling; Global Warming.) Lasers have made long-distance communications easier and helped scientists understand chemical reactions through laser spectroscopy. (See Lasers.) Particle accelerators are the basis of advances in particle physics, where various forms of accelerators accelerate particles and smash them against target atoms, creating smaller particles, whose short lives, less than a fraction of a second, are recorded and analyzed, allowing physicists to identify ever smaller particles. (See Particle Accelerators.) Advanced groundbased telescopes and space-based telescopes have extended what astronomers can see. Optical telescopes have been joined by telescopes looking at other bands in the electromagnetic spectrum, including ultraviolet, infrared, x-ray, and radio. Orbiting satellites\n\nxix\n\nIntroduction\n\nhave contributed to understanding the oceans, assessing environmental damage and land use, finding archaeological sites, and providing precise locations through the Global Positioning System (GPS). (See Satellites;Telescopes.) The Life Sciences One of the most important scientific discoveries since World War II occurred in 1953, when James D.Watson and Francis Crick discovered the double helix molecular structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The x-ray diffraction photographs of DNA molecules by Rosiland Franklin provided a key element of Watson and Crick’s discovery. The science of genetics leapt forward and molecular biology came to rapidly dominate the other fields in the life sciences. (See Biology and the Life Sciences; Crick, Francis; Franklin, Rosiland; Genetics;Watson, James D.) The biochemists Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen developed the techniques of genetic engineering in the early 1970s, spawning the biotechnology industry. (See Biotechnology; Boyer, Herbert; Cohen, Stanley N.) The Human Genome Project, running from 1990 to 2003, found that the final human genome contained 3.1 billion pairs, making up 35,000 to 40,000 genes. (See Human Genome Project). In 1996, Dolly the sheep was born, the successful result of cloning a mammalian adult somatic cell. (See Cloning.) Genetic engineering and cloning raised ethical and bioethical questions about the ecological effects of new species, as well as whether species developed in the laboratory can be owned, whether people should be able to choose the genetic characteristics of their children as if ordering from a catalogue, and the like. (See Bioethics; Ethics.) Scientists like the ornithologist Ernst Mayr and the biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky created the theory of evolution known as the modern synthesis by combining Mendelian genetics with the Darwinian theory of natural selection. (See Dobzhansky, Theodosius; Evolution; Mayr, Ernst.) The famous 1953\n\nMiller-Urey experiment showed that organic molecules could have emerged spontaneously from the early primeval atmosphere. Later scientists expanded on the theory of evolution, arguing that evolution may occur in bursts rather than gradually, and that species should be classified by genetic and evolutionary relationships rather than the classical physiological differences. (See Evolution; Gould, Stephen Jay; Miller, Stanley L.) Scientists such as Elso Barghoorn found microfossils of ancient bacteria, pushing back the first known life on Earth into the billions of years. (See Barghoorn, Elso.) Anthropologists such as those in the Leakey family sought the elusive missing link connecting extinct primate species with modern human beings, and showed that humans evolved in Africa first. (See Anthropology; Leakey Family.) Lynn Margulis revived the older theory of symbiosis to create her serial endosymbiosis theory, which posited that eukaryotic cells, which contain nuclei, evolved when nonnucleated bacteria fused together billions of years ago. She also showed that microbes could transmit induced characteristics, a Lamarckian notion that came to be accepted as part of the mechanism of natural selection within bacteria. (See Margulis, Lynn; Microbiology; Symbiosis.) James Lovelock developed the Gaia hypothesis in the late 1960s, which proposes that Earth functions like a living organism, maintaining surface and atmospheric conditions so that the chemistry and temperature will sustain life. (See Lovelock, James.) The theory is still controversial. Some evolutionists applied natural selection to not just biology, but to human behavior and psychology. Edward O. Wilson, the world’s foremost authority on ants, caused a storm of controversy when his influential Sociobiology:A New Synthesis was published in 1975. Richard Dawkins went even further by promoting evolutionary psychology. (See Dawkins, Richard; Sociobiology and Evolutionary Psychology; Wilson, Edward O.)\n\nIntroduction\n\nEarth Science Geologists in 1950 were certain of two things: that gradualism explained the stratigraphical geological layers found on Earth and that continents were fixed in place.Then, in the 1960s, scientists like Harry Hess, John Tuzo Wilson, and others used evidence from the ocean floor to create the theory of plate tectonics. (See Geology; Hess, Harry; Plate Tectonics; Wilson, John Tuzo.) According to this now generally accepted theory, which has transformed the practice of geology, the continents actually move around on a mantle of magma, pushing up mountain ranges where the plates meet and forming rift valleys where plates pull apart. Earthquakes and volcanic activity cluster around plate boundaries. (See Earthquakes;Volcanoes.) The foundations of the prejudice against gradualism, originally developed partially as a reaction to biblical creation theories that argued that Earth was a scant six thousand years old, were shaken with the discovery that dinosaurs had been driven into extinction by the collision of an asteroid with Earth in Mexico 65 million years ago. (See Alvarez, Luis W., and Walter Alvarez; Creationism.) Medicine Medical research has regularly introduced new wonders in the last century. (See Medicine.) Some of the accomplishments since 1950 have included the polio vaccines introduced in the 1950s by Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin and new wonder drugs to treat ever more obscure diseases. (See Pharmacology; Sabin, Albert; Salk, Jonas.) Robert Edwards and Patrick Steptoe applied in vitro fertilization to create the first human testtube” baby in 1978. (See Edwards, Robert; In Vitro Fertilization; Steptoe; Patrick.) The oral contraceptive, introduced for general use in 1960, helped usher in a sexual revolution in the 1960s and 1970s. (See Birth Control Pill.) Organ transplants begin in 1954 with a kidney transplant and by the end of the century included successful transplants of numerous different organs, and even a single (failed)\n\nexample of transplanting a hand. Efforts to use xenotransplants from pigs and baboons have begun amid much opposition on ethical and moral grounds. (See Organ Transplants.) Institutions such as the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) fund multibillion-dollar efforts in continued research and prevention. (See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; National Institutes of Health.) The World Health Organization successfully led a worldwide effort to completely eradicate the disease of smallpox, declaring victory in 1979. (See Smallpox Vaccination Campaign; World Health Organization.) Even in the midst of so many advances in industrialized countries, leading to ever higher life expectancy rates, new threats have emerged. The excess use of antibiotics has led, through the process of natural selection, to drug-resistant strains of bacteria. In 1981, gay-related immunodeficiency disease (GRID), later renamed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), was found in California, and it has grown into a major health threat, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. (See Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome.) Proteinaceous infectious particles were discovered in the 1970s and are now thought to be the cause of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, scrapie in sheep, and the rare kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases in humans. (See Medicine; Prions.) Studying Humans Neuroscientists and psychologists have made enormous strides in understanding how people think and behave, though much still remains unknown. Neuroscientists now understand more fully the nature of neurons, how neurotransmitters work, and the locations within the brain of certain cognitive functions. Neuroscientists have contributed to the study of cognitive science, which is the study of how humans think. (See Cognitive Science; Neuroscience.) These studies have\n\nxx\n\nxxi\n\nIntroduction\n\nalso contributed to the effort to achieve artificial intelligence, an effort begun in the 1950s that has shown only incremental progress. (See Artificial Intelligence.) Psychology grew as a discipline after World War II, vigorously expanding into clinical psychology, challenging psychiatry for the privilege of treating patients. (See Psychology.) The psychologist B. F. Skinner promoted a theory of strict behaviorism that was later rejected by mainstream psychology. (See Skinner, B. F.) The psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross developed a theory explaining the five stages of grief and acceptance that the terminally ill and bereaved go through. (See Kübler-Ross, Elisabeth.) The psychologist Carl R. Rogers promoted client-centered therapy, helping to break the dogmatic paradigms of behaviorism and Freudian psychoanalysis, and helping to create humanistic psychology and the subsequent growth of eclecticism in the techniques used by psychotherapists. (See Rogers, Carl R.) The experimental psychologist Harry F. Harlow used studies of affection deprivation in primates to show that love is a primary motivator in both primates and humans. (See Harlow, Harry F.) The study of primates in the wild has also illuminated behaviors that are shared with our closest cousins in the animal kingdom, showing that many behaviors are not unique to humans. (See Fossey, Dian; Goodall, Jane; Sociobiology and Evolutionary Psychology.) The study of past humans and other cultures by anthropologists and archaeologists has flourished, assisted by the development of carbon-14 dating by Willard F. Libby, and helped to date artifacts at archaeological sites. (See Anthropology;Archaeology; Libby,Willard F.) Sexologists in Europe and the United States struggled with the sensitive nature of their topic, persisting in the face of those who thought their studies unseemly.The sociological work of Alfred Kinsey, published in the 1940s and 1950s, changed how Americans thought about sexuality, though his studies are now seen as flawed by methodology and bias.\n\n(See Kinsey,Alfred C.) The team of William H. Masters and Virginia Johnson used both physiological and psychological studies to examine sex in a more rigorously scientific way. (See Masters,William H., and Virginia Johnson.) Environmentalism Human population increased from 2.53 billion in 1950 to 6 billion in 1999. (See Population Studies.) Only the Green Revolution allowed farmers to feed such a dramatic increase in people. (See Agriculture; Green Revolution.) Increased population also combined with increasing industrialization to strain the planet’s resources. In 1962, the biologist Rachel Carson published Silent Spring, warning of the dangers from overusing pesticides. Carson’s book became a major impetus, reviving the conservation movement as a vigorous environmental movement. (See Carson, Rachel; Environmental Movement.) Environmental activists drew on the growing science of ecology to understand the interconnections among the different elements of the environment. (See Ecology.) More support for environmentalism emerged with the publication in 1968 of The Population Bomb by Paul R. Ehrlich. Movements to limit growth and attain zero population growth emerged, which helped slow population growth in the industrialized countries and China, but had less impact on poorer countries. (See Ehrlich, Paul R.) In 1974, the chemists Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, drawing on the earlier work of Paul Crutzen, found that man-made chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were eroding the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. (See Chemistry; Crutzen, Paul; Molina, Mario; Ozone Layer and Chlorofluorocarbons; Rowland, F. Sherwood.) In one of the most significant successes of the environmental movement, international agreements banned the manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons. Global warming, species depletion, pollution, and loss of wilderness and open spaces—all are continuing issues for the environmental movement. (See Global Warming.)\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Future The practice of science has expanded with unprecedented vigor since 1950. At least 80 percent of all the scientists in history were alive in the last half of the twentieth century. By the end of the century, as measured by total pages in scientific journals, scientific knowledge was doubling every ten to fifteen years. That is a crude measure, since a single groundbreaking scientific article can have an impact outweighing thousands of other articles, but at least it gives us a way to measure scientific output. Most of the published output is confined to an elite group of scientists concentrated at an elite set of well-funded institutions—universities, government research labs, and corporate research labs. The vast majority of scientists publish only a handful of articles in their lifetime, while a few publish hundreds of articles. Big Science— that is, large government-funded efforts like the Human Genome Project, the building of particle accelerators, large-scale oceanic research, space exploration, the creation of large telescopes, and well-funded medical research—has come to dominate much scientific output. In his 1996 book, The End of Science: Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the Twilight of the Scientific Age, the journalist John Horgan described the heroic age of science as ending, with all the important discoveries already made. All that remained for scientists, he argued, was filling in the details of a framework already discovered. Sir John Maddox, who retired in 1995 after twenty-three years as editor of the journal Nature, published a book in 1998 that answered Horgan, calling it What Remains to Be Discovered: Mapping the\n\nxxii\n\nSecrets of the Universe, the Origins of Life, and the Future of the Human Race. Maddox boldly predicted exciting new discoveries in particle physics, genetics, molecular biology, and artificial intelligence. (See Artificial Intelligence; Biology and the Life Sciences; Biotechnology; Genetics.) Around 1900, ironically enough, many pundits feared that physics had explained everything. Even physicists believed this, at times encouraging their brightest students to find other fields of study. Within a few years came the discoveries about the nature of the atom and electron that eventually led to quantum mechanics. Einstein’s relativity also completely changed the landscape of physics. In truth, in 1900, physics was on the verge of exciting changes, not faced with the stagnation of scientific innovation. It is possible that the same is true today. So what other scientific advances does the future hold? Undoubtedly, nanotechnology will continue to make strides, giving us a greater degree of control on the molecular level that will yield new scientific instruments and industrial advances. (See Nanotechnology.) The twentieth century can be characterized as the century of the physical sciences, with the revolutions in relativity, quantum mechanics, chemistry, and particle physics, but it seems likely that the twentyfirst century will be the century of the life sciences, bringing to fruit the sometimes frightening promises of genetics and biotechnology. Some future wonders may be gleaned from the pages of science fiction, a literature of wonder, just as science often evokes a sense of wonder in scientists and students.

Homosexual men were developing rare diseases, such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Kaposi’s sarcoma, as a result of suffering severely depressed immune systems.Two years later, once it became obvious to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta that the disease had nothing to do with homosexuality, the CDC officially changed the name of the disease to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The disease took years to run its course in an individual. The disease particularly devastated the American homosexual community, and gay activists mobilized to demand government funding for scientific research, funding for medical care, and respect for the civil rights of AIDS patients. The teams of Robert Gallo (1937–) at the National Institutes of Health in the United States and Luc Montagnier (1932–) at the Pasteur Institute in France both discovered in 1984 the retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), that caused AIDS. A bitter dispute over priority ensued, not only for scientific glory, but also for patent rights to the blood test developed two years later on\n\nthe basis of the discovery. Although a few scientists still dispute that AIDS is caused by HIV, the consensus is that HIV causes AIDS. Later studies of stored blood showed that AIDS had probably entered the U.S. population in the mid-1970s and had its origin in the vicinity of Lake Victoria in Africa. As a blood-borne disease, HIV spread fastest among high-risk populations such as intravenous drug users, hemophiliacs, and promiscuous homosexuals. These populations were also recognized as being vulnerable to other blood-borne viruses and diseases, such as hepatitis B. Sexually transmitted diseases in general reached epidemic proportions in the United States after the sexual revolution of the 1960s, but effective antibiotics muted the consequences of those diseases. (The number of syphilis infections reported to public health authorities in America quadrupled from 1965 to 1975, and the number of reports of gonorrhea tripled during the same period.) HIV/AIDS appeared nearly simultaneously in at least twenty nations in North America, Europe, and Africa. Most virulent diseases burn themselves out, as they kill their carriers faster than the disease can be transmitted. HIV, however, lingers in the lymph nodes for up to a decade, spreading to other carriers, before finally causing AIDS and killing the host. As with other viruses, 1\n\n2\n\nAcquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome\n\nScanning electron micrograph of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus believed to be responsible for AIDS (CDC/Public Health Information Library)\n\nthere is not one kind of HIV, but many strains, increasing in number as HIV mutates. A related family of viruses called the Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses (SIVs) has been found in other primates. Because of its method of transmission, AIDS attacks social networks in a particularly insidious manner.Various scientists and political groups have suggested over the years that AIDS is not caused by HIV, but is a natural result of lifestyle choices that result in high-risk behavior. Conspiracy theorists have proposed that AIDS emerged from the smallpox vaccination campaign or a contaminated batch of polio vaccine, or as the result of a deliberate plot by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nEducation programs promoting safer sex with condom use and the use of clean needles by drug users have helped calm the AIDS epidemic in developed nations. Although the vaccine that many researchers have sought has not emerged, drug therapies have emerged to slow the progress of the disease in an individual.These drugs have also proved successful in preventing transmission of HIV to a fetus by an infected mother. Used by themselves, azidothymidine (AZT) and other drugs select for drug-resistant strains of HIV as the virus mutates. Cocktails of drugs, combining several at a time, have been more successful in slowing the viral mutation rate in individual patients.\n\nAgriculture\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) ignored the disease until 1986, then stepped into its natural role of trying to coordinate the struggle against AIDS/HIV. AIDS became a demographic disaster in sub-Saharan Africa in the 1990s, spreading primarily through heterosexual contact, ravaging adults in what should have been the productive prime of their lives. Orphans became a chronic problem. By the end of 2003, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS estimated that 20 million worldwide had died of AIDS, and more than 38 million people were infected with HIV. The majority of the cases were in sub-Saharan Africa, though rates in Russia, China, and Southeast Asia were all quickly rising.

In the industrialized world, increased mechanization, herbicide use, and pesticide use have yielded increases in food production.At the same time, machinery and largerscale operations have reduced the labor necessary to work a modern Western farm, while smaller subsistence operations around the\n\n3\n\nworld have rarely benefited from tractors or other large machines. By 1980, every American farmer fed around eighty people, and Australian farmers fed even more. By 1985, Western agriculture was thirty-six times more labor efficient than Third World agriculture (McNeill, 225). Except where government regulation has prevented it, the traditional family-owned farm has rapidly disappeared in the West in favor of larger commercial enterprises. Meat production— the raising of cattle, hogs, chickens, and turkeys—became industrialized, creating meat factories where heavy use of antibiotics keeps infections at bay. Scientific research has also contributed better methods for preserving foods during storage and transportation. More land has been put under cultivation through the construction of large hydrological projects. In the first half of the twentieth century, such projects in the U.S. West created dams and waterworks to control flooding and open up new lands to irrigation. Since 1950, projects in Egypt, the Soviet Union, and India have emulated these American successes. Poor farming practices and erratic climate patterns have also dramatically increased the amount of land lost to desertification and increased silt runoff into rivers. Desertification has been so bad in Africa that, with accompanying population increases, Africa actually grew less food per person at the end of the century than the continent produced in 1960. Developing Third World nations experienced even more dramatic increases in population than developed nations during the twentieth century. During the 1960s and 1970s, some prognosticators feared a coming worldwide shortage of food, especially within developing nations. Their salvation has come from increasing the amount of land under cultivation and developing new strains of staple crops. By the end of the century, however, most land capable of cultivation with current technologies was already being used. An American plant specialist, Norman E. Borlaug (1914–), went to Mexico in 1944 to\n\n4\n\nAgriculture\n\nwork for the Rockefeller Foundation on a project to create new strains of wheat. Borlaug’s work and the efforts of the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines created what became known as the Green Revolution. The new strains of wheat and rice produced higher yields and resisted diseases better, though they also required more water and depleted the soil more quickly, requiring fertilizers to help them grow. Borlaug did not believe that the Green Revolution had solved the population crisis; rather, the increased food production had bought time to find more permanent solutions to the problem. Largely as a result of the Green Revolution, worldwide grain production increased from 692 million tons in 1950 to 1.9 billion tons in 1992, outpacing the growth in population (http://www. actionbioscience.org/biotech/borlaug.html). Average production of food grew from less than two tons per hectare in 1900 to over four tons per hectare in the 1990s, on an annual basis. It is estimated that the use of artificial fertilizers creates enough extra food to directly feed a quarter to a third of the world’s current population. The cost of artificial fertilizers favors large farms raising cash crops over smaller subsistence farming, and the Third World has experienced in the last halfcentury a steady increase in larger corporate farming. The phenomenon forces subsistence farmers onto more marginal lands or into urban centers to serve as industrial workers or join the ranks of the impoverished in vast shantytowns that surround many Third World cities. The larger farms using artificial fertilizers also tend to grow crops that respond more readily to fertilizers and to increase their yield, thus twothirds of all grain production worldwide now comes from just three plants: rice, wheat, and maize. Farmers have found that increasing the use of artificial fertilizers will not increase food production any more unless new crop strains are developed. Other increases in crop production have\n\ncome from the surge in dam building and irrigation projects. Total irrigated hectares worldwide increased from 94 million in 1950 to 255 million in 1995 (McNeill, 180). By the end of the century, about 30 percent of the world’s food production came from irrigated fields. The most ambitious of all these projects, the Three Gorges Dam project on the Yangtze River, is still under construction, and will displace over 1 million people to make way for a large lake. The consequences of Three Gorges are expected to be similar to the results of other like projects: flood control, stable water levels for navigation, hydroelectric power, irrigation water, ecosystem changes, and increased salinity in the soil. The Soviet biologist Trofim Lysenko (1898–1976) promoted a theory of nonMendelian genetics that found favor in the Stalinist Soviet Union and distorted the science of biology and practice of agriculture in that country for decades. Some Soviet scientists who disagreed with Lysenko were arrested and died from either execution or starvation. In 1964, after changes in Soviet leadership, Lysenko was finally discredited, though it took more time for the effects of Lysenko’s regime to disappear. As large farms have turned to producing single crops, this monoculture has encouraged pests, but discouraged the pest predators that like more varied environments.This development has led to heavier use of pesticides, which has led to the selection of more resistant pests, which have required greater amounts of pesticides. The overuse of synthetic pesticides, an issue effectively raised by the publication in 1962 of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, created the political environmental movement. Environmentalists have tried to understand the ecological impact of new crop strains, and many have begun to emphasize the negative ecological consequences of the monoculture nature of the Green Revolution. Borlaug has responded by arguing that the first step toward social justice and environmental progress is having enough food. In 1970, American corn grow-\n\nAgriculture\n\n5\n\nNorman E. Borlaug, 87, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to the Green Revolution, visiting Sharanjit Singh, a progressive Indian farmer, in 2001 (Pallava Bagla/Corbis)\n\ners lost 15 percent of their harvest to a fungus outbreak, and they promptly diversified their crop with different varieties of corn the next year (McNeill, 224). Recent efforts to improve crop yields have moved from crossbreeding to more direct genetic manipulation by using the techniques of biotechnology. These efforts are aimed at making the crops more resistant to insects and other pests. Many of these new strains have been developed by private corporations for profit, raising important issues about patents and commercial control. The environmental activists who have decried the lack of genetic diversity that comes with monoculture and overuse of the new strains, which mean loss of genetic diversity, fear that genetically engineered crops, dubbed Frankenfoods, will present health dangers. Unfortunately, in order to meet the growing need for food, more refined techniques from biotech-\n\nnology will be necessary to engineer transgenic cereal crops that are pest-resistant, fungus-resistant, and virus-resistant; can grow in marginal soils, and can yield ever larger returns for each acre. In a talk given in 2000, Borlaug warned that though current technology and technology already under development could feed ten billion people, humanity must get its population growth problem under control.

(1911–1988), and Walter Alvarez (1940–) The father-son team of Luis Walter Alvarez and Walter Alvarez discovered high concentrations of iridium in a 65-million-year-old layer of clay, leading them to propose the theory that the dinosaurs were driven to extinction by the impact of an asteroid or comet. Luis was of Spanish descent, born in San Francisco, where his father was a physician. Luis earned all his degrees in physics at the University of Chicago: his B.S. in 1932, M.S. in 1934, and Ph.D. in 1936. After his education, he moved to the University of California at Berkeley, where he used an early cyclotron to discover several new isotopes of mercury, hydrogen, and helium. During World War II, Luis worked on the Manhattan Project; he invented the detonators on the first atomic bomb. Unlike some of the other scientists, he did not regret the building of the bomb or its use, arguing that using the bomb had actually saved lives by forcing an end to the war. After the war, Luis returned to Berkeley to work on the linear accelerator. His team developed a new way to photograph the tracks of transitory atomic particles in a cloud chamber, allowing them to discover additional fundamental particles, many of them existing only in short-lived resonance states. In 1968 he received the Nobel Prize in\n\nPhysics for this work. Later in life, he indulged in other interests, including an effort to use cosmic rays to see if there were any hidden chambers in a pyramid at Giza. He found that the pyramid was made of solid rock. Walter Alvarez was born in Berkeley, California, to Luis and his wife, Geraldine Smithwick. Luis and Geraldine later divorced.Walter gained an enthusiasm for rocks and geology from his mother. He earned a B.A. in 1962 in geology from Carleton College, located in Northfield, Minnesota, and a Ph.D. in geology from Princeton University in 1967. After working in South America, Europe, and Libya, Walter joined the geology department at the University of California at Berkeley in 1977. Walter and his colleagues first went to Gubbio, Italy, to examine the rocks of the area for evidence of magnetic polarity reversals. They found such evidence, reinforcing support for plate tectonics, but also noticed a one-centimeter layer of clay between two beds of limestone.The layer below contained microfossils of the Cretaceous era and the layer above contained microfossils of the Tertiary era.This stratigraphical boundary, called the K-T boundary, is associated with the extinction of the dinosaurs. Walter wanted to know why this clay layer showed such a dramatic break between two major geologic eras. How long had it taken for this layer of clay to form? Walter worked on the problem of the clay with his father; they first tried to measure the amount of isotope beryllium-10 in the clay, but found that the half-life of the isotope was too short to give them good results. Luis suggested that they measure the iridium in the clay bed. Iridium is deposited on Earth from extraterrestrial sources through meteorites and micrometeorites.They expected to find a small amount of iridium if the clay bed had formed slowly and none if it had formed quickly; instead, they found ninety times more iridium than expected. After ruling out other possible causes, the\n\nAnthropology\n\nfather and son and their colleagues published their findings, with the conclusion that a large comet or asteroid had hit Earth at the time of the K-T boundary and deposited the iridium. This impact could also have altered the planet’s climate enough to drive the dinosaurs into extinction. This proposal, relying on a catastrophe, met resistance from geologists inclined to look for gradualist explanations. Catastrophism reminded them too much of creationism and pseudoscientific theories, like the proposal by the Russianborn writer Immanuel Velikovsky (1895– 1979) that events of the Old Testament were caused by the motions of the planets. Later discovery of high levels of iridium around the world, all at the K-T boundary, showed that the cause of the iridium was not a local event. Other scientists in the 1980s identified an impact crater in Chicxulub,Yucatán, Mexico, as the source of the K-T boundary iridium, and a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission in 2000 confirmed the existence of the crater. Geologists have become convinced that, although most geological change is gradual, occasional, catastrophic geologic events have occurred in the past.

In the United States, the cultural relativism of Franz Boas (1858–1942) held sway; Boas emphasized the collection of details about native cultures and argued that no group or race was any better, in a moral sense, than any other group or race.This stance emerged as a reaction to the brutal treatment of native peoples around the\n\n7\n\nworld in the nineteenth century, which was justified by a sense of moral superiority, as well as a reaction to Social Darwinism, which justified social classes as a consequence of innate genetic endowment. In Britain, Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown (1881–1955) and Bronislaw Malinowski (1884–1942) had created a form of social anthropology called functionalism. The two men disagreed about what functionalism was, but drew their ideas from biology, seeing human culture as an organism. In France, Émile Durkheim (1881–1955) saw human behavior as purely social. Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) was not an anthropologist, but he felt that his psychological theory of psychoanalysis was applicable to all problems of human behavior. Freud discussed native customs and behavior as instances of the Oedipus complex in several books. He argued that civilization was a necessary construct to restrain the primitive emotions of the id in people. Claude Lévi-Strauss (1908–) published his Elementary Structures of Kinship in 1949 and his Structural Anthropology in 1961, which established him as a major thinker in French society.Translations of his books spread his influence in other nations. In these books and others, all written in challenging and complex prose, Lévi-Strauss tried to reduce human behavior and culture to their essentials and illustrate the structured relationships between those essentials. His greatest success came from describing the incest taboo and kinship systems as a foundation for culture. In religion, he argued that myths are attempts to resolve contradictions in human behavior, rather than to create justifications for human behavior, as others had argued. Lévi-Strauss sought to explain human behavior and culture in a way unbounded by the historical flow of time, to find truths that applied to all people at all times. His “structuralism” was not applied only to anthropology; it was just as influential in philosophy, literary criticism, and the study of religions. A challenge to social anthropology came from Edward O. Wilson in 1975, with his\n\n8\n\nAnthropology\n\ninfluential Sociobiology:A New Synthesis.Wilson argued that human behavior is dictated by biology and natural selection, with culture and society providing only a veneer over the struggle for reproduction. Many anthropologists condemned sociobiology and its intellectual child, evolutionary psychology, as a new form of Social Darwinism. They feared that dominant industrial cultures would use sociobiological arguments to justify destroying native cultures.With the encroachment of industrial society on traditional native groups, many anthropologists had become advocates for the peoples they studied. Margaret Mead (1901–1978), a disciple of Boas, made her reputation with a study of adolescent girls in Samoa, published in 1928 as Coming of Age in Samoa. A particularly vicious attack on her methodology and conclusions by the anthropologist Derek Freeman (1916–2001) in the late 1980s and early 1990s was partially inspired by the renewed emphasis on nature as opposed to nurture, a shift partially inspired by the rise of sociobiology. The rise of feminism in the 1960s and its sensitivity to issues of gender and social roles also influenced anthropology. Some feminists have argued that prehistoric cultures were egalitarian matriarchies. This argument has foundered on the fact that no matriarchies have been found in any of the hundreds of separate cultures documented by anthropologists in the last two centuries. While cultural anthropology studies human behavior and social practices, physical anthropology studies the physical nature of humans. A major emphasis in this field has been the continuing effort to apply Charles Darwin’s (1809–1882) theory of natural selection to human beings and find precursors to modern humans. The Piltdown Man, discovered in 1912, was conclusively shown to be a hoax in 1953. This finding meant that England was not the birthplace of humanity. The discoveries of Peking Man and Java Man pointed to East Asia as the birthplace of humanity and the best place to look for fossils of earlier hominids.\n\nThe paleoanthropologist Louis S. B. Leakey (1903–1972) argued that Africa was the birthplace of humanity and intended to prove it. Leakey and his wife, Mary Leakey (1913–1996), worked in northern Tanzania at Olduvai Gorge. In 1959, Mary found hundreds of fragments of a hominid skull in Olduvai Gorge within strata dated to 1.75 million years ago; these fragments she reconstructed into a primate that Louis called Zinjanthropus boisei. This primate was thought for a time to be a direct ancestor of modern humans, but further discoveries led even Louis to agree that it represented a separate line of hominids, and the skull was reclassified as Australopithecus boisei. Leakey also thought that the study of the great apes might lead to insights into the behavior of humanity’s ancestors. He recruited Jane Goodall (1934–) to study chimpanzees, Dian Fossey (1932–1985) to study mountain gorillas, and Biruté Galdikas (1946–) to study orangutans in Borneo. In 1978 at Laetoli, Mary Leakey found the fossilized footprints of three hominids dated at 3.6 million years old. The three are thought to be the footprints of a man, woman or smaller man, and a child, and the gait of the footprints clearly shows that these hominids walked upright, much sooner than anyone had suspected. An expedition led Richard Leakey (1944–), the son of Mary and Louis, to the shores of Lake Turkana, where he excavated fossils from perhaps 200 individual hominids, including the 1.6-million-year-old Turkana Boy, an almost complete skeleton of Homo erectus. The discoveries at Lake Turkana showed that at least three different species of hominids lived together in close proximity millions of years ago, though controversy remains over which line of hominids led to modern humans. In 1974, Donald Johanson (1943–) found the first nearly complete skeleton of Australopithecus afarensis, which was named “Lucy.” Despite these extraordinary finds in the second half of the twentieth century, the meaning of these discoveries is still elusive, and the so-\n\nApollo Project\n\ncalled missing link between apes and humans has not been found. The continuing profusion of extinct hominid species simply creates confusion, making more difficult the continuing efforts to construct a solid line of evolution to modern humans. Numerous skeletons of Neanderthals have been found ever since the nineteenth century. Scientists argued over whether Neanderthals were a precursor to modern humans or a separate species.A consensus gradually grew that Neanderthals were a separate sapient species, with their own ability to make tools, art, and graves for their dead. Neanderthals must also have coexisted with modern humans during the last ice age. Recent finds of Neanderthal skeletons in the late 1990s have allowed scientists to extract mitochondrial DNA. The current conclusions are that the DNA demonstrates that Neanderthals were a separate species, but that crossbreeding with modern humans was possible and may even have occurred.

Kennedy urged Congress to commit the United States\n\n9\n\nto landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth before the end of the decade. Kennedy was primarily motivated by cold war competition. The United States had been embarrassed by the Soviet Union launching Sputnik I, the first artificial satellite, in 1957, and putting the first man into space just a month earlier, on April 12, 1961. As a struggle of competing ideologies, the cold war conflict between the superpowers depended as much on prestige as on military power, and the United States wanted to regain its prestige as the preeminent scientific and technological power on the planet. The Mercury project put the first American astronaut into space on May 5, 1961. Other Mercury flights followed, sending astronauts into orbit in small capsules. A flight to the Moon and landing there required a much more sophisticated effort.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) decided on an elaborate Moon effort that required the world’s most powerful booster, a crew of three, the ability to twice rendezvous in space, and a stay in space of over a week. The Gemini project followed, with two-person capsules and practice that included rendezvousing two spacecraft while in orbit. A massive three-stage rocket, the Saturn V, provided enough thrust to push a three-man command capsule and a lunar lander into Earth’s orbit. The Ranger, Surveyor, and Lunar Orbiter projects sent unmanned robotic craft to the Moon to scout out the way for the Apollo astronauts. Ranger probes smashed into the Moon while sending back television pictures; Surveyor probes actually landed; and the Lunar Orbiters used radar and photography to chart the surface of the Moon, searching for safe landing sites for the Apollo astronauts. The Apollo project faced a tragic setback in 1967 when a test of the command capsule atop an unfueled rocket on the pad resulted in a flash fire. Fed by the pure oxygen atmosphere of the capsule and by poor design, the fire killed three astronauts.The project halted\n\n10\n\nApollo Project\n\nApollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin on the surface of the Moon at Tranquility Base, July 20, 1969 (Original image courtesy of Neil Armstrong/NASA/Corbis)\n\nfor over a year while the capsule was redesigned to be safer and a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere was introduced for use while the spacecraft was on the ground. When the project resumed, the first flights were proof of concept efforts.The astronauts of Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 only orbited Earth, while the astronauts of Apollo 8 and Apollo 10 traveled to the Moon, orbited it, and re-\n\nturned to Earth. The astronauts of Apollo 8 orbited the Moon on Christmas Eve, 1968, read passages from the biblical Book of Genesis on the radio, and took a famous picture of Earth rising over the lunar landscape. The Soviets launched their own spacecraft, Zond 5 and Zond 6, in 1968, into orbits around the Moon, successfully returning them to Earth. These modified Soyuz capsules, though orig-\n\nArchaeology\n\ninally designed to carry cosmonauts, carried only turtles, mealworms, bacteria, plants, and seeds. The astronauts of Apollo 11 were Neil Armstrong (1930–), Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. (1930–), and Michael Collins (1930–).While Collins stayed behind in the orbiting command capsule, Armstrong and Aldrin descended to the Moon in the lunar lander. Using rocket thrust to slow their descent, they landed on the four legs of the lander on July 21, 1969. As Armstrong stepped from the last rung of the ladder to the Moon’s surface, he said: “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” The record was later altered to reflect what he meant: “That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.” Armstrong and Aldrin spent less than a day on the lunar surface before using the bottom half of their lunar lander as a launching pad and returning to orbit in the upper half of their lunar lander. From 1969 to 1972, a total of twelve astronauts walked on the Moon, the only humans ever to do so. Apollo 13 suffered the explosion of an oxygen tank aboard the command module while on the way to the Moon, forcing the astronauts to cancel their Moon landing and desperately improvise to get home safely. In terms of science, the Apollo astronauts brought back 838 pounds (380 kilograms) of lunar rocks and spent a total of 296 hours exploring the lunar surface. Later missions even included a lunar rover to allow the astronauts to range across the lunar surface. The astronauts left scientific instruments on the Moon to monitor seismic activity and reflect back lasers from Earth to accurately measure the distance between Earth and the Moon. The Apollo project cost $25 billion, a considerable investment for that time; the project became the first big customer of integrated circuits and played a key role in accelerating the growth of the semiconductor industry. Public interest declined after the first landing, and three later scheduled landings were cancelled due to federal funding cuts.\n\n11\n\nThe Soviet program to beat the Americans to the Moon suffered a crippling setback when a rocket exploded on the pad and killed dozens of key engineers and technical personnel. After Apollo 11 reached the Moon’s surface first, the Soviets announced that they were not interested in following suit and kept their own failed effort secret. Surplus Apollo hardware was used in the three Skylab missions of 1973–1974, during which American astronauts lived in space aboard a small space station, and in the Apollo-Soyuz mission of 1975, during which American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts rendezvoused in orbit and shook hands inside a temporary tunnel connecting the two spacecraft.

Libby of the University of Chicago developed the technique of radioactive carbon dating. This allowed archaeologists to measure the amount of naturally occurring radioactive isotope carbon-14 in wood, ashes, or bones from\n\n12\n\nArchaeology\n\narchaeological sites and date them, based on the decay of the carbon-14. Ground-imaging radar, global positioning systems, remote sensing, computers, and trace-element analysis are some of the many other scientific and technological advances that offered new tools to archaeology. In the 1960s, archaeologists embraced processional archaeology, also called New Archaeology.This movement started in America and rapidly found adherents in Britain and Scandinavia, spreading later to other developed countries. Processional archaeology draws more upon the discipline of anthropology, and those who practice it strive to become more than just collectors of artifacts and recorders of stratigraphic layers. They recognize that the context of an artifact is more important than the artifact itself. The new tools allow archaeologists to examine how individuals actually lived their lives in the past. In common with similar movements in other social sciences and the humanities, the New Archaeology seeks to understand the world of the common people, not just the elite. In the 1980s, a loosely defined postprocessual archaeology movement developed in Britain, urging even more emphasis on individuals as active agents in their world and arguing even more strongly for context. Archaeologists as a community increased in numbers and importance during the second half of the twentieth century, as the affluence of developed countries sustained their activities. Laws to promote preservation of archaeological sites were passed in many developed countries. Activism by descendants of native peoples also led to laws compelling museums and archaeologists to return artifacts, and especially human remains, for burial according to native customs.The Kennewick Man, discovered on the bank of the Columbia River in 1996, illustrated the tensions involved, in this case between scientific investigation of a 9,000-year-old skeleton and five Native American nations who demanded possession of the skeleton under the author-\n\nity of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, passed by the United States Congress in 1990. Historical archaeology emerged as a subdiscipline of its own in the 1970s, concentrating on archaeological sites of recent origin. Environmental archaeology also emerged in the 1970s, drawing on the skills of geologists, botanists, and biologists to more thoroughly understand the environment of the past through seed remains, pollen samples, soil analysis, and other such techniques.The subdiscipline of salvage archaeology emerged to preserve sites or conduct quick excavations in the face of new construction. The most famous example of salvage archaeology occurred in 1960s, when an international effort moved important ancient Egyptian monuments to higher ground to avoid their being submerged by the rising waters behind the Aswan Dam on the Nile River. The invention of scuba gear by Jacques Cousteau (1910–1997) allowed him to undertake an undersea archaeological excavation. The first professional archaeologist to take up scuba was George F. Bass of the University of Pennsylvania in 1960, pioneering many of the techniques for working underwater. Other archaeologists adopted the technology, recovering artifacts from ancient shipwrecks, and later excavating the sites of prehistoric lake settlements in Europe. Scuba also permitted the raising of shipwrecks, for example the Swedish warship Vasa, sunk in 1628 in Stockholm harbor, raised in 1961. Many notable finds excited the interest of laypeople in archaeology. The royal tomb of the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, was unearthed in 1974. Other chambers were later discovered, including a large vault containing 6,000 terra-cotta statues of warriors and horses. The life-sized army wore real clothes, boots, and armor, and bore weapons. The bogs of northern Europe preserved bodies cast into them by ancient people. The\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n13\n\nReferences Cotterell, Arthur.

In the Andes Mountains, children left as sacrifices were preserved by the high-altitude air. The first to be found, a young woman in 1995, was dubbed the Ice Maiden. The preservation of DNA, and even the contents of stomachs left from final meals, added to the importance of these finds.

Early computer pioneers, such as the mathematicians Alan Turing (1912–1954) and John von Neumann (1903–1957), intentionally developed electronic computers as the first step toward the creation of genuine thinking machines. In 1950, Turing created the Turing Test, a way of testing an intelligent machine. If a person could interrogate an intelligent machine via a teletype and at the end of the conversation not tell whether or not there was another person or a machine at the other end of the teletype, then that machine was intelligent. Although contemporary researchers no longer commonly accept the Turing Test as an absolute criterion, it serves as a good indicator of the goals of these early pioneers. The term artificial intelligence (AI) was first coined in a two-month summer workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956, organized by the mathematicians Marvin Minsky (1927–) and John McCarthy (1927–). The first two decades of AI research were dominated by researchers at the Massachusetts\n\n14\n\nAsimov, Isaac\n\nInstitute of Technology (MIT), Carnegie Tech (later renamed Carnegie Mellon University), Stanford, and International Business Machines (IBM). European efforts and Japanese efforts later became important. The second high-level computer language, called Lisp (from list processor), was created specifically in 1958 by McCarthy at MIT for AI research. The history of AI has been characterized by a series of theories that showed initial promise when applied to limited cases, leading to optimistic declarations that intelligent machines were just around the corner, and disappointment as the theories failed when applied to more difficult problems. In the early 1980s, expert systems showed promise. An expert system is created as a series of rules, with an inference engine, covering a narrow field of expertise. The first successful commercial expert system configured orders for Digital Computer Corporation computer systems. The promise of expert systems created a commercial expansion of the field, only to end in disappointment by the end of the 1980s as the expense and limitations of expert systems became apparent. AI researchers developed a close relationship with cognitive science, the study of how humans think. One result of this relationship was the creation of neural networks, implemented in either hardware or software; these networks simulate the way the human brain uses neurons to form patterns and change the relationships within those patterns. The concept of fuzzy logic also grew out of this relationship, allowing software to make decisions when input data remain uncertain and incomplete. Robotics is related to AI, in that many of the difficult problems in each field are similar. Industrial robots that perform limited tasks have become common, though generalpurpose robots that can correctly perceive the natural world, through sight or other sensory means, and react to that sensory data remain visions of the future. Significant work at MIT’s AI Lab in the 1990s has developed a\n\ndifferent bottom-up approach to robotics, using simple algorithms to create machines that move like insects. Vision is a form of pattern recognition, and AI research eventually led to pattern recognition of optical characters, which became common by the 1990s. Effectively recognizing handwriting patterns also became possible in the 1990s. The solution of the related problem of voice recognition has resulted in simple commercial applications. In 1997, an IBM supercomputer called Big Blue defeated Garry Kasparov (1963–), the world chess champion, in a chess tournament. Kasparov later complained that Big Blue had been programmed to specifically defeat him, though all grand masters train to defeat specific opponents. Many commercial computer games and video games have rudimentary AI algorithms to provide an artificial opponent for the human player.

He was born in Petrovichi, Russia, and his family emigrated to New York City when he was only three years old. He\n\nAsimov, Isaac\n\ngraduated from high school at age fifteen and entered Columbia University. He received a B.S. in chemistry in 1939, and an M.A. in the same field in 1941. During World War II, he worked at the U.S. Naval Air Experimental Station in Philadelphia. After the war and a short tour in the army, he returned to Columbia, earning a doctorate in 1948. He taught biochemistry at Boston University until 1958, when he became a full-time writer. Father to two children by his first wife, Asimov died of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in 1992, the result of an HIV infection he contracted when undergoing triple-bypass heart surgery in 1983. Asimov is considered one of the three grand old masters of the science fiction field (Arthur C. Clarke [1917–] and Robert A. Heinlein [1907–1988] being the other two). Asimov’s 1941 short story, “Nightfall,” is considered by many to be the finest science fiction short story ever written. The story describes a world with six suns whose complex orbits allow night to come only briefly every 2,000 years.The sight of the stars, heretofore hidden by daylight, drives many people insane, destroying their civilization. His series of Foundation novels, first published in the early 1950s and resumed in the 1980s, is considered by many critics to be the finest science fiction series ever written. His Robot series of short stories and novels developed a set of three robotic laws that is often quoted: 1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. (I, Robot, 6)\n\nHis nonfiction writing, including regular essays on science for numerous magazines, put him in the position of being the leading science popularizer of his time. His straightforward writing style enabled him to explain\n\n15\n\nIsaac Asimov, science fiction author and prolific science populizer (Douglas Kirkland/Corbis)\n\ncomplex scientific ideas while remaining accurate. Examples of his books include The Intelligent Man’s Guide to Science (1960), Great Ideas of Science (1969), The History of Physics (1984), and Asimov’s Chronology of Science and Discovery (1989). His work reflected concerns with overpopulation, the environment, the role of science in people’s lives, and revealed a skeptical, humanist outlook toward religion and claims of the paranormal. Considering the complex content of his books, Asimov is certainly the most prolific writer of all time, with some four hundred books, hundreds of short stories, and thousands of articles to his credit. His prodigious memory and compulsive work habits helped him generate millions of words.

These roles have continued through the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. Scientific associations are usually found organized along national lines or within scientific disciplines. The Royal Society in the United Kingdom, founded in 1660, is the premier example of a national society; it has remained vigorous, publishing journals, funding research, and electing distinguished scientists to be fellows of the society. Other prominent national societies have played important roles.The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), founded in 1848, grew out of an earlier association of geologists. The weekly journal of the AAAS, Science, founded in 1880, eventually became one of the most important scientific journals in the world. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences selects the winners of the scientific Nobel prizes. The Soviet Academy of Sciences played a much stronger role than is normally true of national societies, directing the practice of science in the Soviet Union through a centralized system of control not seen in other countries, except for similar national organizations in other communist countries. The German Max Planck Society, founded in 1948 as a successor to the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science, received significant funding from the federal and state governments of West Germany and has continued to receive state support from the new united German government.The so-\n\nciety inherited institutes from the Kaiser Wilhelm Society and founded more as Germany recovered from World War II. The institutes have devoted themselves to basic research, producing numerous Nobel prize winners. The society promotes research in its own institutes and at universities, and supports the career development of junior scientists. Every scientific discipline has an association. One of the best ways for historians to see that a scientific subdiscipline has been successfully created is to look for the founding of the accompanying association. Examples of associations in America include the American Psychological Association, American Astronomical Society, American Medical Association, and the Geological Society of America. Comparable associations exist in other countries. National associations often function as a method to promote interdisciplinary research, as do the broader international associations. The International Geophysical Year (IGY) of 1957–1958 was organized and run by the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), an association founded in 1931 to foster international cooperation in science. Associations also engage in media relations, campaigns for funding, political activism, and promotion of science as a way to knowledge.

Giant telescopes in America, endowed mostly by private foundations, pushed out the limits of the known universe. The Milky Way became only one galaxy among many when other galaxies were discovered. In 1929 the American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble (1889–1953) found that all galaxies are receding from each other, and that the faster a galaxy is receding, the farther away it is, and the more its spectra shift toward the longer wavelengths of the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum.
