        "text": "2000 Young Alumni Achievement Award\n\nIn recognition of research contributions in the fields of time-frequency analysis and wavelets, and for outstanding teaching and professional service.\n\nWhile completing his PhD at the University of Illinois, Richard Baraniuk had already become a well-known researcher in the field of time-frequency analysis. After completing his dissertation, Baraniuk first went to Ecole Normale Superieure in Lyon France and then joined Rice University in 1993. Now focusing his research in the area of wavelet theory, Baraniuk could easily be classed among the top ten researchers in that field.\n\nIn recognition of his research excellence, Baraniuk received a NATO postdoctoral fellowship from NSERC in 1992, the National Young Investigator award from the National Science Foundation in 1994, a Young Investigator Program award from the Office of Naval Research in 1995, and the Rosenbaum Fellowship from the Isaac Newton Institute of Cambridge University in 1998. In the area of teaching excellence, Baraniuk received the C. Holmes MacDonald National Outstanding Teaching Award from Eta Kappa Nu in 1999. This award is granted to one professor in the nation for outstanding undergraduate teaching in electrical and computer engineering."
