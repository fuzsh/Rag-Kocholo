        "text": "French bro here\n\nNon-French people usually have now idea how difficult it is to get into ENS Ulm (École Normale Supérieure de Paris)\n\nHere's the 2021 entrance examination for the math section: https://www.ens.psl.eu/sites/default/files/21_mp_sujet_mathd.pdf (yes this is infinitely more difficult than the SAT math section lol)\n\nAnd please don't even compare Caltech to ENS, ENS is in its league of its own: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.20757/tables/1\n\nHonestly, as an Azn-American, I would have greatly preferred this. It was very difficult for me and my family to adjust to American culture, expectations, etc. which resulted in me having an incredibly poor knowledge of the college admissions system. Somewhat better prepared students with probably lower eye que and interest than me were able to game the system with extracurriculars, connections, etc. which I was very angered by. If our college admissions were strictly weighted on learning material and taking a test my high school experience would have been much better\n\nYes but keep in mind that the ENS is more comparable to grad school than college, the students admitted there undergo two years of preparatory classes which are taught at a level which is higher than any undergraduate class anywhere in the world I reckon. So the comparison of outcomes should be between ENS and say the combination of Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc graduate schools.\n\nAlso, if I am not wrong students usually get a PhD while they are students at the ENS at one of the partner institutions like the Paris unis.\n\nFrench bro here:\n\n2 years of classes préparatoires\n\n3-4 years of ENS: usually, they complete their MSc on ye + they almost finish their PhD (some of them do complete it)\n\nNo one can compete with ENS students... They are above the sky.\n\nAlso, if I am not wrong students usually get a PhD while they are students at the ENS at one of the partner institutions like the Paris unis.\n\nFrench bro here:\n\n2 years of classes préparatoires\n\n3-4 years of ENS: usually, they complete their MSc on year 1 or 2 + they almost finish their PhD on year 4 (some of them do complete it)\n\nNo one can compete with ENS students...
