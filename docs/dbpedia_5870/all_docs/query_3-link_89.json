        "text": "Jeremy Yudkin\n\nProfessor of Music; Co-Director of the Center for Beethoven Studies\n\nJeremy Yudkin is Professor of Music, Co-Director of the Center for Beethoven Research, Associated Faculty of the Department of African American Studies, Associated Faculty of the Elie Wiesel Center of Jewish Studies, and former chair of the Department of Musicology and Ethnomusicology at Boston University; and former Visiting Professor of Music at Oxford University. He has also taught as Visiting Professor at Harvard University and Professeur Invité at the Ecole Normale Supérieure and the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique in Paris, France. Dr. Yudkin received his BA and MA in Classics and Modern Languages from Cambridge University in England and his PhD in Historical Musicology from Stanford University. He is the recipient of a Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities, a Marion and Jasper Whiting Foundation Fellowship, a Class of 1960 Visiting Scholar at Williams College, a Senior Fellowship at the Boston University Humanities Foundation, and a Research Fellowship from the Camargo Foundation. He is the author of eleven books and has written several book chapters and articles for many journals.\n\nProfessor Yudkin’s principal fields of research include medieval music, Beethoven, popular music, and jazz. He has taught classes on medieval polyphony, the Beatles, Beethoven, Bartok, and Miles Davis, among many others. He has been nominated six times for Boston University’s highest teaching award and was chosen as the University Lecturer in 2010. Jeremy Yudkin is perhaps best known in the field for his definitive textbook Music in Medieval Europe and his highly successful music appreciation textbook Understanding Music, which is used by approximately twenty thousand students across North America every year. The video that he produced, Inside the Orchestra, detailing the history and function of the classical symphony orchestra, was the winner of a 2005 Telly Award for outstanding non-broadcast educational video. He is also the author of several other books on medieval and Renaissance music, Beethoven, and jazz. His book Miles Davis, Miles Smiles, and the Invention of Post-Bop (2009) won an Award for Excellence in Historical Sound Research from the Association for Recorded Sound Collections. His book From Silence to Sound: Beethoven’s Beginnings was nominated as a 2021 Outstanding Reference Book of the Year by the American Library Association.\n\nProfessor Yudkin is a contributor to The Harvard Dictionary of Music; Musicians and Composers of the Twentieth Century; and A Companion to the Modern American Novel, 1900-1950. He is currently engaged in two book projects, one on the Beatles and another on jazz in the 1950s. He served as an advisor to the Smithsonian Institution for the Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz and is a consultant on jazz to the Oxford English Dictionary. He is a Cultural Partner and Distinguished Speaker for the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute and founder and host of the Lenox Library Association’s Distinguished Lecture Series. He is the pre-concert lecturer for the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s annual Tanglewood Festival every summer and has lectured across the United States and in England, France, Israel, and Russia.\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nBooks\n\n1959: The Greatest Year in Jazz.
