        "text": "Thanks to a formal partnership that began in 1989, each year a Boston College graduate student is granted the position of pensionnaire étranger for one academic year at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris (and in turn, one ENS student comes to BC as Instructor of French). Founded in 1794, and located in the heart of the Latin Quarter (on the Rue d’Ulm), the ENS is one of the most prestigious institutions of higher learning in France.\n\nThis position entails free (dormitory) lodging on one of the campuses of the Ecole, free access to classes and seminars, academic advising by distinguished ENS professors, library privileges at one of the best libraries in Paris, and access to a low-cost government-sponsored meal plan. More information about the ENS can be obtained from its web site.\n\nAs the position carries no stipend, students selected for the program must have sufficient funds of their own to finance their year in Paris. BC fellowships can at times be used for this purpose; students are also encouraged to apply to other grants or fellowships to help finance their year in Paris.\n\nThe exchange program with the ENS is open to all Boston College graduate students with a good command of French and who can adequately demonstrate their ability to profit from this intellectual and academic experience. Other requisites are the psychological maturity and prior experience of study or travel abroad that will help to ensure a successful séjour in Paris living among students of all nationalities.\n\nStudents wishing to be considered for this program should make an appointment to see Professor Prof. Tina Montenegro, Coordinator of the Program, during the Fall semester. There is no application form. Formal statements of interest that detail one's suitability for the program and one's plans for the ENS year, together with CVs, are due by January 31. Interviews take place in early February, and decisions are communicated to all candidates by March 1.\n\nFor further information (and before the initial interview with Prof. Montenegro), please be sure to read the ENS Orientation Guide for Foreign Students and the description of the exchange prepared by a BC alum of the program."
