        "text": "Two to four awards of 6 to 12 months each are offered to pursue a master's degree or research at the Ecole normale supérieure (ENS) Paris-Saclay (previously ENS Cachan) in the fundamental sciences, engineering sciences, or social sciences humanities.\n\nThe ENS Paris-Saclay is a prestigious school for research and higher education careers. Its rigorously selected students follow advanced courses in fundamental sciences, humanities and social sciences, and engineering sciences.\n\nThe École also offers a number of original research study programs on topics such as quantum technology, artificial intelligence, creative and immersion research, and in science for environmental transitions in famous international laboratories.\n\nSituated on the plateau de Saclay since 2020, ENS Paris-Saclay, a component institution of Université Paris-Saclay, coordinates the Graduate School of research and higher education careers. Since its creation, Université Paris-Saclay is among the top-ranked universities (15th in the world, 1st in Mathematics and 9th in Physics - ARWU 2023).\n\nThe École’s new building, designed by Renzo Piano Building Workshop, brings to life the pedagogy of the École normale supérieure, by blending the areas allocated to research and classrooms and promoting interdisciplinarity.\n\nAlong with 3 other French ENS (Lyon, Paris, and Rennes), its public service mission aims to prepare the best students for academic careers, as all these careers in both the public and private sectors require great scientific expertise.\n\nBeing a Fulbrighter in France is an unforgettable experience! When not engaged in their project, Fulbrighters enjoy the benefits of the French lifestyle: wonderful food, excellent life-work balance, and enthusiasm for lively debate and discussion. We encourage Fulbrighters to travel the country (and discover its many amazing heritage sites, museums, landscapes, and diverse society), and to get involved in community service or other local activities. They are thus able to build strong cross cultural ties between France and the United States.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that while the Fulbright Commission is dedicated to assisting Fulbrighters as much as possible to make their transition to France as smooth as possible, Fulbrighters are responsible for securing their own housing and making other administrative arrangements themselves. We recommend that Fulbrighters prepare their stay well ahead of time.\n\nFor more information on daily life in France, see: https://www.usa.campusfrance.org/daily-life\n\nIt is the applicant's responsibility to secure affiliation with ENS Paris-Saclay.\n\nApplicants are required to first contact the ENS Paris-Saclay International Office (ri-incoming@ens-paris-saclay.fr) who will put the applicants in touch with the appropriate department and/or laboratory. Each proposed project has to be submitted for verification to the ENS Paris-Saclay International Office (ri-incoming@ens-paris-saclay.fr) (cc cgoodwin@fulbright-france.org) before applying.\n\nA letter of affiliation signed by the relevant supervisor at ENS Paris-Saclay should be submitted with the application for applicants pursuing both degree-seeking and research projects. Applicants enrolling in a degree seeking program must apply to ENS Paris-Saclay as well, once they have been confirmed as Fulbright grantees.\n\nPlease note that ENS Paris-Saclay is not the same institution as ENS in Paris itself (often referred to as “ENS Ulm”). In addition, while ENS Paris-Saclay is a member institution of the Université Paris-Saclay, not all Université Paris-Saclay programs are affiliated with ENS Paris-Saclay. Candidates need to be sure that the study and/or research projects they propose are indeed through ENS Paris-Saclay. Please reach out to the International Relations Office for complete and accurate information on programs of interest before beginning the application."
