        "text": "Since 1973, this has been a reciprocal exchange of graduate students between the two institutions. Each year two visiting students are admitted to Princeton from E.N.S.-Paris.\n\nPrinceton can receive up to six graduate student nominations from ENS-PSL for the purpose of research only. Students must be nominated by ENS-PSL before they can apply. These E.N.S. students are not on the Procter Visiting Fellowship and hold the status of VSRC while at Princeton and are enrolled for the spring term only. Students are not eligible to take courses for official credit and are only permitted to audit a course with prior permission from the instructor.\n\nApplication Submission Dates July 1 through September 30 Program Dates\n\nJanuary 1 through May 31\n\nProgram Length Spring Term Application Fee None\n\n(International applicants only)\n\nAll international nondegree students must arrive in the U.S. with a valid F-1 or J-1 student visa. The Davis International Center will assist with the visa eligibility documents (I-20 for F-1 students or DS-2019 for J-1 students) after admission is offered."
