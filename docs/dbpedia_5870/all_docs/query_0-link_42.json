Let’s first consider a simple random walk starting at 0 with steps of 1 and –1 occurring with equal probability. Here is a pure Python way to implement a single random walk with 1,000 steps using the built-in random module: In [247]: import random .....: position = 0 .....: walk = [position] .....: steps = 1000 .....: for i in range(steps): .....: step = 1 if random.randint(0, 1) else -1 .....: position += step .....: walk.append(position) .....: See Figure 4-4 for an example plot of the first 100 values on one of these random walks: In [249]: plt.plot(walk[:100]) Figure 4-4.\n\n…\n\nTurns out, we can compute this using argmax, which returns the first index of the maximum value in the boolean array (True is the maximum value): In [257]: (np.abs(walk) >= 10).argmax() Out[257]: 37 Note that using argmax here is not always efficient because it always makes a full scan of the array. In this special case, once a True is observed we know it to be the maximum value. Simulating Many Random Walks at Once If your goal was to simulate many random walks, say 5,000 of them, you can generate all of the random walks with minor modifications to the preceding code. If passed a 2-tuple, the numpy.random functions will generate a two-dimensional array of draws, and we can compute the cumulative sum across the rows to compute all 5,000 random walks in one shot: In [258]: nwalks = 5000 In [259]: nsteps = 1000 In [260]: draws = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(nwalks, nsteps)) # 0 or 1 In [261]: steps = np.where(draws > 0, 1, -1) In [262]: walks = steps.cumsum(1) In [263]: walks Out[263]: array([[ 1, 0, 1, ..., 8, 7, 8], [ 1, 0, -1, ..., 34, 33, 32], [ 1, 0, -1, ..., 4, 5, 4], ..., [ 1, 2, 1, ..., 24, 25, 26], [ 1, 2, 3, ..., 14, 13, 14], [ -1, -2, -3, ..., -24, -23, -22]]) Now, we can compute the maximum and minimum values obtained over all of the walks: In [264]: walks.max() Out[264]: 138 In [265]: walks.min() Out[265]: -133 Out of these walks, let’s compute the minimum crossing time to 30 or –30.\n\n…\n\n, Introspection-Introspection %quickref magic function, About Magic Commands quicksort method, Alternative Sort Algorithms quotation marks in

gain anything at a formal level by having this new definition. But the analysis in terms of random walks provides some additional intuition for PageRank as a measure of importance: the PageRank of a page X is the limiting probability that a random walk across hyperlinks will end up at X, as we run the walk for larger and larger numbers of steps. This equivalent definition using random walks also provides a new and sometimes useful perspective for thinking about some of the issues that came up earlier in the section.\n\n…\n\n. . . . . . . . .

there has been a growing public fascination with the complex “connectedness” of modern society.\n\n…\n\n(If their current page has no out-going links, they just stay where they are.) Such an exploration of nodes performed by randomly following links is called a random walk on the network. We should stress that this is not meant to be an accurate model of an actual person exploring the Web; rather, it is a thought experiment that leads to a particular definition. In Section 14.6, we analyze this random walk and show the following fact: Claim: The probability of being at a page X after k steps of this random walk is precisely the PageRank of X after k applications of the Basic PageRank Update Rule. 2As an aside about our earlier motivating example, one can check that using a value of s in this range doesn’t completely fix the problem with Figure 14.8: nodes F and G still get most (though no longer all) of the PageRank under the scaled update rule with such values of s.\n\nMathematical Finance: Core Theory, Problems and Statistical Algorithms by Nikolai Dokuchaev\n\nBlack-Scholes formula, Brownian motion, buy and hold, buy low sell high, discrete time, electricity market, fixed income, implied volatility, incomplete markets, martingale, random walk, risk free rate, short selling, stochastic process, stochastic volatility, transaction costs, volatility smile, Wiener process, zero-coupon bond\n\nProposition 2.24 Under the assumptions and notations of Definition 2.23, for all measurable deterministic functions F such that the corresponding random variables are integrable. Problem 2.25 Prove that a discrete time random walk is a Markov process. Vector processes Let ξ(t)=(ξ1(t),…, ξn(t)) be a vector process such that all its components are random processes. Then ξ is said to be an n-dimensional (vector) random process. All definitions given above can be extended for these vector processes. Sometimes, we can convert a process that is not a Markov process to a Markov process of higher dimension. Example 2.26 Let ηt be a random walk, t=0, 1, 2,…, and let Then ψt is not a Markov process, but the vector process (ηt,ψt) is a Markov process. 2.5 Problems Problem 2.27 Let ζ be a random variable, and let 0≤a<b≤1.\n\n…\n\nFor simplicity, we shall use below stationary processes and white noise in the sense of Definitions 8.1–8.3, but all results are valid for wide-sense stationary processes and for the white noise defined as a wide-sense stationary process with no correlation and zero mean. 8.2 Simplest regression and autoregression The first-order regression model can be described by a one-dimensional equation © 2007 Nikolai Dokuchaev Review of Statistical Estimation 141 yt=β0+βxt+εt, t=1, 2,…. (8.1) Here yt and xt represent observable discrete time processes; yt is called the regressand, or dependent variable, xt is called the regressor, or explanatory variable, εt is an unobserved and are parameters that are usually unknown. error term, The standard assumption is that (8.2) Special case: autoregression (AR) Let us describe the first-order autoregressive process, AR(1), as yt=β0+βyt−1+εt, (8.3) where εt is a white noise process, are parameters. The AR(1) model is a special case of the simplest regression (8.1), where xt= yt−1. It can be shown that εt is uncorrelated with {ys}s<t. If −1<β<1, then there exists a stationary process such that as t→+∞. If β=1 and β0=0 in (8.3), then yt is a random walk (see Definition 2.6). A random walk is non-stationary and it does not converge to any stationary process. In fact, if |β|≥1, then Var yt→+∞ as t→+∞. This implies that many standard tools for forecasting and testing coefficients etc. are invalid. To avoid this, we can try to study changes in yt instead: for example, the differences zt=yt−yt−1 may converge to a stationary process.\n\n…\n\nDefinition 2.5 Let ξt, t=0, 1, 2,…, be a discrete time random process such that ξt are mutually independent and have the same distribution, and Eξt≡0. Then the process ξt is said to be a discrete time white noise. Definition 2.6 Let ξt be a discrete time white noise, and let t=0, 1, 2,…. Then the process ηt is said to be a random walk. The theory of stochastic processes studies their pathwise properties (or properties of trajectories ξ(t, ω) for given ω, as well as the evolution of the probability distributions. © 2007 Nikolai Dokuchaev Mathematical Finance 18 Definition 2.7 A continuous time process ξ(t)=ξ(t, ω) is said to be continuous (or pathwise continuous), if trajectories ξ(t, ω) are continuous in t a.s.\n\nAsset and

the accessibility of information. The least that can be said is that the conclusions of the searches carried out in order to test efﬁciency are inconclusive and should not be used as a basis for forming clear and deﬁnitive ideas. 9 Fama E. F., Behaviour of Stock Market Prices, Journal of Business, Vol. 38, 1965, pp. 34–105. Fama E. F., Random Walks in Stock Market Prices, Financial Analysis Journal, 1965. Fama E. F., Efﬁcient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work, Journal of Finance, Vol. 25, 1970. 10 This approach is adopted in this work. 11 Refer for example to Bechu T. and Bertrand E., L’Analyse Technique, Economica, 1998. 46 Asset and Risk Management 3.1.2.2 Weak form The weak form of the efﬁciency hypothesis postulates that it is not possible to gain a particular advantage from the range of historical observations; the rates therefore purely and simply include the previous rate values.\n\n…\n\nBonds 141 By differentiating the value of the portfolio, we have: dVt = −Pt (s1 )(µt (s1 ) dt − σt (s1 ) dwt ) + X · Pt (s2 )(µt (s2 ) dt − σt (s2 ) dwt ) = [−Pt (s1 )µt (s1 ) + XPt (s2 )µt (s2 )] · dt + [Pt (s1 )σt (s1 ) − XPt (s2 )σt (s2 )] · dwt The arbitrage logic will therefore lead us to  −Pt (s1 )µt (s1 ) + XPt (s2 )µt (s2 )   = rt  −P (s ) + XP (s ) t t 1 2  P (s )σ (s ) − XPt (s2 )σt (s2 )   t 1 t 1 =0 −Pt (s1 ) + XPt (s2 ) In other words: XPt (s2 ) · (µt (s2 ) − rt ) = Pt (s1 ) · (µt (s1 ) − rt ) XPt (s2 ) · σt (s2 ) = Pt (s1 ) · σt (s1 ) We can eliminate X, for example by dividing the two equations member by member, which gives: µt (s1 ) − rt µt (s2 ) − rt = σt (s1 ) σt (s2 ) This shows that the expression λt (rt ) = µt (s) − rt is independent of s; this expression σt (s) is known as the market price of the risk. By replacing µt and σt with their value in the preceding relation, we arrive at Pt + (a + λb)Pr + b2 P − rP = 0 2 rr What we are looking at here is the partial derivatives equation of the second order, which together with the initial condition Ps (s, rt ) = l, deﬁnes the price process. This equation must be resolved for each speciﬁcation of a(t, rt ), b(t, rt ) and λt (rt ). 4.5.1.2 The Merton model31 Because of its historical interest,32 we are showing the simplest model, the Merton model. This model assumes that the instant term rate follows a random walk model: drt = α · dt + σ · dwt with α and σ being constant and the market price of risk being zero (λ = 0).\n\nMathematics for

τ S(nτ ) 2 1 2 = 1 + m + σ τ + σξ(n + 1), 2 and so S(nτ + τ ) − S(nτ ) ≈ 1 m + σ 2 S(nτ )τ + σS(nτ )ξ(n + 1). 2 Since ξ(n + 1) = w(nτ + τ ) − w(nτ ), we obtain an approximate equation describing the dynamics of stock prices: S(t + τ ) − S(t) ≈ 1 m + σ 2 S(t)τ + σS(t)(w(t + τ ) − w(t)), 2 (3.8) where t = nτ . The solution S(t) of this approximate equation is given by the same formula as in Proposition 3.7. For any N = 1, 2, . . . we consider a binomial tree model with time step of length τ = N1 . Let SN (t) be the corresponding stock prices and let wN (t) be the corresponding symmetric random walk with increments ξN (t) = wN (t) − n is the time after n steps. wN (t − N1 ), where t = N Exercise 3.25 Compute the expectation and variance of wN (t), where t = n N. 3.\n\n…\n\nExercise 3.24 Write S(1) and S(2) in terms of m, σ, τ , ξ(1) and ξ(2). Next, we introduce an important sequence of random variables w(n), called a symmetric random walk, such that w(n) = ξ(1) + ξ(2) + · · · + ξ(n), and w(0) = 0. Clearly, ξ(n) = w(n) − w(n − 1). Because of the last equality, the ξ(n) are referred to as the increments of w(n). From now on we shall often write S(t) and w(t) instead of S(n) and w(n) for t = τ n, where n = 1, 2, . . . . Proposition 3.7 The stock price at time t = τ n is given by S(t) = S(0) exp(mt + σw(t)). Proof By (3.2) S(t) = S(nτ ) = S(nτ − τ )ek(n) = S(nτ − 2τ )ek(n−1)+k(n) = · · · = S(0)ek(1)+···+k(n) = S(0)emnτ +σ(ξ(1)+···+ξ(n)) = S(0)emt+σw(t) , as required. 68 Mathematics for Finance In order to pass to the continuous-time limit we use the approximation 1 ex ≈ 1 + x + x2 , 2 accurate for small values of x, to obtain S(nτ + τ ) 1 = ek(n+1) ≈ 1 + k(n + 1) + k(n + 1)2 .\n\nOne Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch\n\nair freight, Apple's 1984 Super Bowl advert, Boeing 747, book value, buy and hold, Carl Icahn, corporate raider, cuban missile crisis, Donald Trump, fixed income, index fund, Irwin Jacobs, Isaac Newton, junk bonds, large denomination, money market fund, prediction markets, random walk, shareholder value, Silicon Valley, Teledyne, vertical integration, Y2K, Yom Kippur War, zero-sum game\n\nI also found it difficult to integrate the efficient-market hypothesis (that everything in the stock market is “known” and prices are always “rational”) with the random-walk hypothesis (that the ups and downs of the market are irrational and entirely unpredictable). Already I’d seen enough odd fluctuations to doubt the rational part, and the success of the great Fidelity fund managers was hardly unpredictable. It also was obvious that Wharton professors who believed in quantum analysis and random walk weren’t doing nearly as well as my new colleagues at Fidelity, so between theory and practice, I cast my lot with the practitioners.\n\n…\n\nI was thrilled to be hired at Fidelity, and also to be installed in Gerry Tsai’s old office, after Tsai had departed for the Manhattan Fund in New York. Of course the Dow Jones industrials, at 925 when I reported for work the first week of May, 1966, had fallen below 800 by the time I headed off to graduate school in September, just as the Lynch Law would have predicted. RANDOM WALK AND MAINE SUGAR Summer interns such as me, with no experience in corporate finance or accounting, were put to work researching companies and writing reports, the same as the regular analysts.

An example of modeling a Markovian/memoryless random variable is modeling short-term stock price behavior and the idea that it follows a random walk. This leads to what is called the Efficient Market hypothesis in Finance. For more information, refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk_hypothesis.

of prices and of asset manager performance since then have lent credence to the idea that the market is efficient enough to make it impossible to determine whether top asset managers’ performance is due to anything but luck. The theory also implies that looking for exploitable patterns in prices, and in other forms of publicly available data, will not lead to strategies in which investors can have confidence, from a statistical perspective. An implication of the EMH is that prices will evolve in a process indistinguishable from a random walk. However, another branch of financial economics has sought to disprove the EMH. Behavioral economics studies market imperfections resulting from investor psychological traits or cognitive biases.\n\n…\n\nTherefore, if they lose against the informed traders (the first terms in equations 1 and 2 below) and win against the uninformed traders (the second terms in equations 1 and 2 below), their profits are a vH 0.5 1 a v 0, (1) vL 0.5 1 v b 0. (2) b The difference between the ask and bid prices, or the spread (S), is then given by S vH 1 0.5 1 vL 1 0.5 1 . (3) Moreover, by further simplifying the model with the assumption that 0.5 , the spread prices follow a random walk at the intraday level becomes a linear function of the probability of informed trading (π): S vH vL . (4) Intraday Data in Alpha Research213 The importance of Glosten and Milgrom’s results lies in the illiquidity premium principle discussed above, stating that higher spreads increase the expected

programming, higher-order functions, random walk\n\nIf you don’t understand what your program does, you can read it 100 times and never see the error, because the error is in your head. Running experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple tests. But if you run experiments without thinking or reading your code, you might fall into a pattern I call “random walk programming,” which is the process of making random changes until the program does the right thing. Needless to say, random walk programming can take a long time. You have to take time to think. Debugging is like an experimental science. You should have at least one hypothesis about what the problem is. If there are two or mor"
