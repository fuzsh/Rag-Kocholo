Have an account? .\n\nThere are thousands of universities all over the world, but only a handful are recognized as the best of the best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Center for World University Rankings recently released a list of the top universities in the world and also listed the best universities in specific countries and continents.\n\nThe CWUR, which is based in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, looks at the quality of education, prestige of faculty members, and quality of faculty research at each university to compile its annual list.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nWe've put together a list of the best universities in 35 countries, as determined by the CWUR. Some of the universities are hundreds of years old with storied histories, while others are newer but are making strides with their research and academics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArgentina: University of Buenos Aires\n\nWorld rank: 378\n\nLocation: Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nThe University of Buenos Aires is the largest university in Argentina, with around 300,000 total students. It is especially known for its \"science and technique\" structure, which is made up of approximately 6,000 researchers and scholars working on more than 1,500 research projects. Three Nobel Prize winners attended the university: Dr. Bernardo Houssay, Federico Leloir, and César Milstein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustralia: University of Sydney\n\nWorld rank: 95\n\nLocation: Sydney, Australia\n\nThe University of Sydney was founded in 1850 and currently has about 51,400 students. The university was ranked eighth in the world for its education program and 13th for accounting and finance, as well as law. In 2013, Sydney alumni were ranked the fifth-richest in the world, according to Wealth-X.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustria: University of Vienna\n\nWorld rank: 205\n\nLocation: Vienna, Austria\n\nThe University of Vienna was founded by Duke Rudolph IV in 1365 and is the oldest university in the German-speaking world. The university has approximately 92,000 students and 6,700 academic employees. Nine winners of the Nobel Prize have been affiliated with the university either through teaching or research.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBelgium: Katholieke Universiteit Leuven\n\nWorld rank: 94\n\nLocation: Leuven, Belgium\n\nKatholieke Universiteit Leuven has approximately 41,300 students and offers classes in both English and Dutch. The courses are research-based, and the university offers three-year bachelor's programs and one- or two-year master's programs. The number of international students at the university stands at 7,400, practically double what it was 10 years ago. Notable alumni include Paul Bulcke, CEO of Nestle, and Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrazil: University of São Paulo\n\nWorld rank: 131\n\nLocation: Buntantã, São Paulo, Brazil\n\nThe University of São Paulo is young compared with many other established universities, as it was founded in 1934. It provides free tuition, which is a major draw for students; the university gets about 150,000 applications each year out of which only about 11,500 are accepted. Its main campus is located in the wealthy city of São Paulo, but its 90,000 students are spread between campuses in seven cities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCanada: University of Toronto\n\nWorld rank: 31\n\nLocation: Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nUniversity of Toronto has about 83,000 students spread between three Canadian campuses: one in Toronto, one in Mississauga, and one in Scarborough. Its students are not just from Canada — more than 150 countries are represented. More than 700 undergraduate programs and more than 400 graduate programs are available, but the university is ranked very highly for its education, English, and geography programs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChile: Pontifical Catholic University of Chile\n\nWorld rank: 450\n\nLocation: Santiago, Chile\n\nThe Pontifical Catholic University of Chile is a private university with approximately 22,654 students. Over the years, the university has made advances in many fields, including chemistry, engineering and medicine. Its influence even extends to America — back in 2011, the University of Notre Dame signed an agreement with PUC for a dual graduate degree program in civil engineering and the geological sciences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina: Peking University\n\nWorld rank: 55\n\nLocation: Haidian, Beijing, China\n\nPeking University has about 24,000 students studying at its 2,743,532 square-foot campus in Beijing. It prides itself on its impressive faculty, which includes members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and the Third World Academy of Sciences.
