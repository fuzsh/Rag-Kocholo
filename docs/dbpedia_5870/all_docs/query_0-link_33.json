This reference volume is also an integral part of a larger research and publishing project, the origins of which date back to the end of the twentieth century, when the global and Russian academic community formed a new ­interdisciplinary field – globalistics. By the time a large amount of theoretical and applied knowledge had accumulated in this field, a multitude of new specific concepts and generalizing interdisciplinary categories had emerged, together with a large number of organizations, periodicals, and specialized literature. In various areas of theory and practice a mass of brainpower had emerged, whose activity focused on the study of globalization and its possible consequences. All this, as well as rapidly increasing knowledge of global processes and their manifestations, was undoubtedly of positive significance for understanding the realities of the modern world but, at the same time, brought major challenges to the development of research in this area due to the lack of systems. Thus serious obstacles arose during the development of this new academic discipline, making the task of imposing order on such varied and diverse information particularly relevant. A priority was to make an inventory of creative ideas, generalize them and order them according to good practice approved knowledge accumulated in globalistics to date. Typically, such problems are solved by the publication of reference books. This task was entrusted to the Russian Philosophical Society, the Russian Academy of Environment, Centre of Science and Applied Programs Dialogue, the international public organization Concerned Philosophers for Peace and the Project Paideia of Boston University (usa), which ­embarked on the preparation of the international interdisciplinary encyclopedia Globalistics.2 The main objective was to compile and organize the most important theoretical results obtained to date in research into globalization processes and their possible consequences. The encyclopedia, prepared by 450 of the most renowned experts from 28 countries, was published in 2003 in 1 The Global Studies: Persons, Organizations, Editions. Encyclopedic Directory, ed. A.N. Chumakov, I.V. Ilyin, and I.I. Mazour (Moscow, 2012). 2 S.v. “Dialog,” The Global Studies Encyclopedia, ed. I.I. Mazour, A.N. Chumakov, and W.C. Gay (Moscow, 2003). In Russian and English.\n\nx\n\nFrom The Editors\n\n­Russian and English, and became the first reference book in the new interdisciplinary field of globalistics. The next stage of the project was the preparation and publication in 2005 of the international globalistics encyclopedic dictionary,3 in which 647 authors from 58 countries took part. The main objective of this publication was to inventory, clarify the meanings and put in order an entire set of basic concepts and categories. The book received widespread acceptance in the academic community professionally engaged in various aspects of globalistics. The English edition of this dictionary was published in 2014.4 Both editions, encyclopedia and encyclopedic dictionary, played an important integrative and methodological role in the new discipline and gave a big impetus to the development of interdisciplinary interaction in the study of all complex of processes and issues of global world. They have also become a valuable source of up-to-date information, based on a generalization of a multitude concrete examples and actual data from various spheres of life in the global community and their interaction with the environment. It should be noted that the West also understood the need to solve this issue, but was not able to embody a similar project until nine years later. Thus in 2012 American colleagues published a fundamental work on global studies – ­Encyclopedia of Global Studies, edited by H. Anheier, M. Jurgensmeyer, and B. Fessel. The book was created, as noted by the publishers, to standardize key concepts in a rapidly growing area of global studies. By global studies the authors of the encyclopedia imply analysis of events, activities, ideas, processes and threads that are transnational or can affect all regions of the world. It is noteworthy that, according to M. Jurgensmeyer, while global studies flourished at the start of the twenty-first century, a powerful impetus to the field was given by the Club of Rome in the late 1960s, as well as by fundamental works from the Soviet school of globalistics. In this regard, the Russian scientific school identifies two main stages of global studies: 1) the study of contemporary global issues (late 1960s–early 1990s.) 2) investigation of the processes of globalization (beginning of the 1990s–today).\n\n3 The Global Studies International Encyclopedic Dictionary, ed. A.N. Chumakov and I.I. Mazour (Moscow, Saint Petersburg, & New York, 2006). 4 Global Studies Encyclopedic Dictionary, ed. Alexander N. Chumakov, Ivan I. Mazour and William C. Gay, with a Foreword by Mikhail Gorbachev (Amsterdam and New York, 2014), xi.\n\nFrom The Editors\n\nxi\n\nBoth of these stages are now recognized as contributing to the establishment and development of modern globalistics, which is an interdisciplinary field of scientific knowledge, embracing various scientific disciplines engaged in the research of global processes and their possible consequences. Thus, the immediate objectives of the encyclopedia and encyclopedic dictionary have been met. At the same time another critical issue remains: the systematization of information on academic journals and publications, specialists, organizations, and periodicals in the field of globalistics. The urgency of fulfilling this task was dictated by the fact that, in the c­ ontext of growing globalization and intensification of world contradictions, interest in globalistics is increasing and will continue to increase worldwide in the future. There is already a demand for knowledge not only about the state of theoretical advances in this area but also information about who has carried out relevant work and where, which organizations, universities, and other structures are purposefully engaged in global issues. An analysis of the most relevant periodicals and specialized literature will also be of great value to all involved in global studies. Lack of such information significantly reduces opportunities for interdisciplinary research and broad international participation, and also hampers effective interaction between academics, public figures, and politicians of various countries and helping to create a theoretical understanding of global issues. This applies to both theoretical research, related to the preparation, for example, all kinds of analytical material such as reports, and practical focus on contemporary global issues (development of specific proposals for change and improvement of the existing governance structures, preparation of legal acts, development of mechanisms for their implementation, etc.). In other words, over the last forty years of intense theoretical research, globalistics not has only accumulated a vast amount of theoretical material but has formed a particular academic discipline with its own representatives, organizations, specialized literature, and network of interdisciplinary connections and relations. Putting it all in order and creating a complete system was and is a matter of time. It began when the above-mentioned Globalistics Encyclopedia and Globalistics Encyclopedic Dictionary were published, which released the creative power necessary to expand the discipline. Another impetus was the creation at Moscow State University of a Faculty of Global Studies, through which students could accumulate a lot of information in different languages. To further study of the discipline, the Faculty of Global Studies at msu, the Russian Philosophical Society, and the Scientific and Production Corporation Intellektualnye Sistemy agreed to cooperate on a project originally called “Who’s who and what’s in Globalistics.” The aim of the project was the\n\nxii\n\nFrom The Editors\n\n­preparation and publication of an international, interdisciplinary, encyclopaedic handbook to cover the agents, organizations, and publications on the subject. Implementation of this plan eventually determined the final name of the proposed manual – Globalistics: People, Organizations, Publications5 – in which each of the sections had a set of specific goals and objectives. PEOPLE. Collect, as far as possible, detailed information about Russian and foreign academics and experts who have made outstanding and significant contributions to the development of globalistics, the emergence of a holistic, global, and systematic world and (or) its interpretation. Assess and select 300 of the most significant Russian and foreign contributors to the discipline. ORGANIZATIONS. Gather, as far as possible, detailed information on a global scale and assess and select the most important Russian and foreign organizations, universities, centers, faculties, departments, etc. whose main aim is the study of globalization, global issues, and other aspects of globalistics. EDITIONS. Collect, as far as possible, detialed information about Russian and foreign periodicals (specialized journals), thematically focused on globalistics. On the basis of expert judgment select the most significant Russian and foreign source materials (monographs) on various aspects of global world, ­globalization and its consequences. Of course, the editors and the creative team headed by them are fully aware that they were tackling an extremely complex issue on a planetary scale, where certain shortcomings and omissions could occur because the project is the first of its kind in the world. It is also important to note that, to ensure the highest standards of information was selected, only the world’s top experts in the field of global studies were involved, this notwithstanding the large number of volunteers whose knowledge of different languages enriched the project, even if it also complicated coordination of the process of creative cooperation and decision-making on a number of controversial issues. Nevertheless, this longterm project undertaken by a large international team eventually came to its logical conclusion, and now this work is also being published in English. The English version of the book The Global Studies Directory: People, Organizations, Publications significantly differs from the Russian edition. Firstly, since the book was published in Russia, a lot of changes have taken place in global studies. Secondly, to better reflect the world’s achievements in the field of global studies, the number of individuals representing Russian globalistics was significantly reduced. At the same time, the list of representatives of other 5 Global Studies: Persons, Organizations, ed. A.N. Chumakov, I.V. Ilyin, I.I. Mazour (Moscow, 2012).\n\nFrom The Editors\n\nxiii\n\ncountries actively conducting research in the field of global studies was greatly expanded. Now that our work on the English edition of Globalistics Directory: People, Organizations, Publications is drawing to a close, we would like to extend our deepest and most sincere thanks all those who have participated in this multidimensional and multi-year project. In addition to the members of the Expert Council, whose names are published on the front pages of the Directory, we also thank the numerous teams of academics and specialists who participated in gathering information and writing articles for this edition. A large team of collaborators, graduate students, and undergraduates at msu’s Faculty of Global Studies deserves special mention: their analytical research work has played a crucial role in gathering information from multiple sources in different languages. As we are unable to mention all contributor names, we would like to thank the most active participants of the project and highlight the second-year Master students at msu’s Faculty of Global Studies, Krupin Stanislav and Nesterenko Valeria, whose creative and selfless work proved to be particularly valuable and productive. In conclusion we would like to emphasize that the work presented here is an important, but not the final stage in the development of global studies. It is based on the latest achievements in the field of globalistics, reflects its current state and, of course, will be continued in print form (as supplemented reprints of this handbook) and by new forms of data collection and dissemination (­replication) information, for example, through the creation of an Internet portal with a continuously updated database. This publication is the first example of an edition designed both for specialists and anyone interested in the development of the modern global world, global processes and specific outcomes that have accrued in the field of globalistics.

After studies in physics, in environmental protection and in economics, business administration and law, Ahamer worked on air emissions, energy, ­climate change, and global economic scenarios at the Austrian Federal Environment Agency and at iiasa. He has lectured at six Austrian universities on subjects including environmental systems sciences, ethics, systems thinking, and social and cultural geography. On behalf of the Austrian government, he was one of the first one hundred Europeans to be sent in the role of ­Pre-Accession ­Adviser to an applicant country to the European Union, for which purpose he was registered in the Diplomatic Protocol. After eu Twinning projects in Slovenia and Slovakia with the aim of supporting candidate countries’ administrations in implementing the eu acquis communautaire, he organized conferences in Central Asia and later co-authored the terms of reference for three eu ­Twinnings in the three Caucasian states. For the detection and analysis of global long-term trends, he created the Global Change Data Base (gcdb), and for the creation of consensus solutions to complex, interdisciplinary, and international problems involving multiple stakeholders he devised the web-supported negotiation game Surfing Global Change (sgc), which was shortlisted as a finalist in the largest European prize on didactic media, Medidaprix 2007. As a member of the Steering Committee for Global Studies, Ahamer cofounded Austria’s most comprehensive and cross-disciplinary developmental curriculum, Global Studies (gs), in Graz and gave all gs-specific lectures there to over ninety students annually. More of his affiliations are listed in the ­Marquis Who’s Who in the World, where he has been a biographee since 2010. He received an honorary medal for scientific cooperation from the office of the Moscow Mayor in 2013. Ahamer is co-editor of six peer-reviewed journals and is an editorial board member or reviewer for over three dozen books and international journals. His main ideas on the dialogical structure of reality, discourse in humanitarian ethics, redefinition of space on the basis of communication, ­techno-socio-economic megatrends, and the evolutionary sequence of structural transitions (meta-trends) are described in his monograph, Mapping G ­ lobal Dynamics, published by Springer, the first volume of a trilogy.\n\n© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���8 | doi 10.1163/9789004353855_002\n\n4\n\nPEOPLE: AITMATOV–AKHLAQ\n\nWorks: Mapping Global Dynamics – Geographic Perspectives from Local ­Pollution to Global Evolution (Springer, 2015); Tracing Global Dynamics – ­Milestones, Landmarks and Transitions in Techno-Socio-Economic Evolution (Berlin, 2016).

December 12, 1928, Sheker, Kyrgyzstan; d. 2008) – Prominent Kyrgyz writer, founder (1986) of the international ­movement Issyk-Kul Forum, concerned with the moral and intellectual development of mankind in an era of global issues on the basis of the ideas of humanism and the unity of mankind. The Issyk-Kul Forum was the first informal association of prominent thinkers of our time in the ussr and in spiritual terms was a breakthrough for that era, but it did not receive the proper support and following that it deserved. For many contemporaries Aitmatov’s thoughts and actions seemed controversial, but can now be seen as prophetical; his words “The new generation should join in globalization, but we cannot forget our roots” sound extremely relevant today. Aitmatov’s ideas have continued to be developed by intellectuals through the Issyk-Kul Youth Forum, “Youth of cis: Cultural Diversity, Tolerance and Acceptance.” AKAYEV, Askar Akayevich (b. 1944, Kyrgyzstan) – Kyrgyz politician and statesman, scientist; President of the Kyrgyz Republic (1990–2005); President of the Academy of Sciences of the Kirghiz ssr (1989–90). Since 2006 Akayev has been a major researcher in the field of applied mathematics and optics, chief scientific researcher at the. I.R. Prigogine Institute of Mathematical Studies of Complex Systems at Lomonosov Moscow State University, a foreign member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the coordinator of the subprogram “Complex System Analysis and Modeling of Global Dynamics” of the Praesidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences. From 1990 to 2005 he was President of the Kyrgyz Republic. Akayev has made a significant contribution to the methodology of modelling global socio-economic and political processes. His research has been focused on the development of techniques for forecasting global dynamics based on the modeling of long-term cyclic processes. This research acquired special urgency during the global financial and economic crisis (2008–09). Akayev compiled forecasts for global socio-economic development in the first decade of the twenty-first century and, in particular, he predicted the second wave of the global financial crisis (beginning in August 2011).\n\nPEOPLE: AITMATOV–AKHLAQ\n\n5\n\nWorks: Transition Economy from a Physicist’s Point of View (­Mathematical Model of Transition Economy) (Bishkek, 2000); Thinking about the Future with Optimism: Reflections on Foreign Policy and World Order (Moscow, 2004); “A New Methodology for Predicting Long-Term Cyclic Dynamics of the Global System and Russia,” in Forecast and Modeling of Crises and Global Dynamics (Moscow, 2009) (co-author V.A.

June 1, 1976, Bamyan, Afghanistan) – Muslim philosopher and professor, who has made significant contributions to dialogue among civilizations with regard to comparative philosophy, modernization, and global studies. Akhlaq received his Doctorate of Philosophy at the University of Allame ­Tabatabaii in Tehran (2009) and graduated from the Great Islamic Seminary in Mashhad, Iran. He has been an Advisor of the National Academy of Sciences in Afghanistan and is the author of several books and papers on mutual understanding between Islam and the West. Currently, Akhlaq is a Visiting Scholar at both the Catholic University of America and the George Washington University. He also leads a Muslim community in North America that contributes to the building of a more multicultural community for the global era. Akhlaq was one of the first Muslim scholars to deal with issues of globalization in the context of the philosophical dialogue between Islam and the West. He treats globalization as the natural outcome of Enlightenment philosophy, examining the metaphysical and philosophical features of the New World in light of the development of rationalism, epistemology, humanism, and the study of world affairs. He considers the development of rationalism – which, like rationality itself, has both positive and negative aspects – to be the central issue in globalization. He argues that although globalization seems to be an entirely new and revolutionary phenomenon closely connected to Western modernity, it is a product of humanity. Nowadays, multiple cultures participate in the shaping of global life. Akhlaq has articulated principles from the Quranic verses that encourage Muslims to make positive contributions, alongside non-Muslims, to build a better community for all. For example, in the case of immigration, the Quran highlights how mixing with other peoples enriches the content of one’s faith and encourages people to work together to enhance their lives. Similarly, when the Quran refers to the prophets as the brothers of infidels, it reveals a wider\n\n6\n\nPEOPLE: ALESHKOVSKY–AMELI\n\nperspective on brotherhood related to humanity rather than to a particular faith. Because justice is central to the Islamic faith, and because there is a strong connection between Islam and politics throughout the Quranic verses, Islamic commands and the earliest practise of Islam, in Akhlaq’s view, ­together give a greater balance to politicized Islam. The current form of politicized ­Islam comprises three aspects: the reaction to Western colonialism, the political potential of Islam, and the process of modernization in various regions where the Islamic faith is predominant. It feeds both Islamophobia and the clash of civilizations in the Islamic context, which changes the nature of the interaction between Islam and the West from a mutual cultural understanding to a politics of temporary policies. According to Akhlaq, the distinction many Muslim scholars make between globalization and globalism, by which they equate globalization with ­Westernization and approach it pessimistically while admiring globalism as a good idea for humanity, is invalid. He takes a positive approach to globalization, discussing the ability of reason to understand itself and its potential for learning through an empirical process, to reform its mistakes, and to progress further. He also encourages Muslims to take a more active role in the process of globalization and shows that they can make a contribution to the Global Culture without losing their own tradition of intellectualism. Accordingly, he highlights three aspects of Islam: (a) the Islamic emphasis on human values such as rationalism, empirical argumentation, world affairs, immigration, multi-characteristic identity, dealing with other nations, and working for common values among humanity; (b) the historical meeting and metaphysical agreement between Western philosophy, particularly Enlightenment philosophy, and Islamic Peripatetic philosophy; and (c) Islamic spirituality and intuition, which inspires people in two directions: first, towards openness and modern values like freedom, individualism, and human rights, and second, by reminding them not to lose their humanity under the pressure of globalism and secularization. Based on his analysis of rationality as the core of the New World, Akhlaq sees in gloabalization the capactiy both for totalitarianism and for openness to others. Opportunity acts as a double-edged sword; this is the nature of life and the meaning of human struggle. He recommends the use and exploration of rationality in examining religious and intuitional sources, the diversity of real life, the fusion of horizons, and the idea of progress. Individuals have only one judge – reason – but they have multiple sources of knowledge. Globalization promotes reason without forcing one to neglect diverse sources or to examine one’s rational achievements.\n\nPEOPLE: ALESHKOVSKY–AMELI\n\n7\n\nWorks: From Rumi to Nietzsche: The Meditation on Tradition, Modernity and Post-modernity (Qum, 2007); The Philosophical Discourse between Islam and the West (Qum, 2008); The Enlightenment Tradition in Islam and the West (Tehran, 2009); From the Tradition of Balkh to the Modernity of Paris (Kabul, 2010); “Identity and Immigration: A Quranic Perspective,” in Building Community in a Mobile/Global Age: Migration and Hospitality (Washington dc, 2013); “The Gates to Violence in the Current Politicized Islam,” in Religion: Key to Understanding Violence and Promoting Peace in Global Times (Washington dc, in press).

Amin spent his childhood and youth in Port Said, where he attended a French high school and earned a Baccalauréat in 1947. From 1947 to 1957 he studied in Paris, earning a diploma in political science (1952) before graduating in statistics (1956) and economics (1957). After arriving in Paris, Amin joined the French Communist Party (pcf), but later distanced himself from Soviet Marxism and became associated for some time with Maoist circles. With other students he published a magazine entitled Étudiants Anticolonialistes. In 1957 he presented his thesis, supervised by François Perroux among others, originally titled The Origins of Underdevelopment – Capitalist Accumulation on a World Scale but retitled The Structural Effects of the International Integration of Precapitalist Economies, a theoretical study of the mechanism which creates so-called underdeveloped economies. After finishing his thesis, Amin returned to Cairo, where he worked from 1957 to 1960 as a research officer for the government’s Institution for Economic Management. Subsequently Amin left Cairo to become an adviser to the Ministry of Planning in Bamako (Mali) from 1960 to 1963. In 1963 he was offered a fellowship at the Institut Africain de Développement Économique et de Planification (idep). Until 1970 he worked there as well as being a professor at the\n\nPEOPLE: AMIN\n\n9\n\nUniversity of Poitiers, Dakar and Paris (of Paris viii, Vincennes). In 1970 he became director of the idep, which he managed until 1980. In 1980 Amin left the idep and became a director of the Third World Forum in Dakar. Amin has written more than thirty books, including Imperialism & Unequal Development; Specters of Capitalism: A Critique of Current Intellectual Fashions; and Obsolescent Capitalism: Contemporary Politics and Global Disorder and The Liberal Virus. His memoirs were published in October 2006. For Amin, economic ascent and decline is largely determined in our age by the following “five monopolies”: (1) the monopoly of technology, supported by military expenditures of the dominant nations; (2) the monopoly of control over global finances and a strong position in the hierarchy of current account balances; (3) the monopoly of access to natural resources; (4) the monopoly over international communication and the media; and (5) the monopoly of the military means of mass destruction. Recent economic performance is an illustration of the evolving mechanisms of the future Kondratieff cycle that began in the mid-1980s. Dependency and World Systems theory, in the tradition of Amin, identifies four main characteristics of the peripheral societal formation: (1) the predominance of agrarian capitalism in the “national” sector; (2) the formation of a local bourgeoisie which is dependent on foreign capital, especially in the trading sector; (3) the tendency toward bureaucratization; and (4) specific and incomplete forms of proletarization of the labor force. High imports by the periphery, and hence, in the long run, capital imports, are the consequence of the already existing structural deformations of the role of peripheries in the world system, namely by (1) rapid urbanization, combined with an insufficient local production of food; (2) excessive expenditures of the local bureaucracies; (3) changes in income distribution to the benefit of the local elites (demonstration effects); (4) insufficient growth of and structural imbalances in the industrial sector; and (5) the resulting reliance on foreign assistance. The history of periphery capitalism, Amin argues, is full of shortterm “miracles” and long-term blocks, stagnation and even regression.

ANDERSON, Chris (b. 1961) – American journalist, chief editor of Wired; predicts a world where everything is free and there is no need for advertising. ­Networks will change the world, and every digital sector will become free.\n\nPEOPLE: ANDERSON–ANNAN\n\n11\n\nAnderson proposed the theory of the “long tail”: “In a Long Tail economy, it’s more expensive to evaluate than to release.” He describes a new business model with zero costs. This model has little to do with our modernity, in which advertising guarantees revenue; on the contrary, it is based on a new reality in which there will be no need to advertise. “It ends in this economy of waste,” he says. If the incremental cost of making content that was originally produced for physical distribution available online is low, the price should be low too. To explain how this is possible, Anderson uses the example of nuclear energy. If electricity were too cheap to be measured – so cheap that it would spend for nothing – there would exist an electricity economy. Everything would run on electricity, because it would cost nothing. Such is the case today with the technology revolution. In fact, he strongly believes that “free” is the future of business. All the technology of the computer revolution is too cheap to measure. As more and more companies become digital, services and products will become available through software and downloads. This means that everything will be free. Companies like Google and Yahoo, earning billions of dollars, are based on the business model of giving something for free. This “donation economy” is based on free labor and no advertising. “Any industry that has become digital, will eventually become free,” he concludes. The future will be digital and, more importantly, free.

ANNAN, Kofi Atta (b. 1938, Ghana) – Diplomat who served as the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1997 to December 2006. Annan and the United Nations were the co-recipients of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize “for their work for a better organized and more peaceful world.” From February 23 until August 31, 2012, Annan served as un – Arab League Joint Special Representative for Syria, to help find a resolution to the ongoing conflict there. In 2000, ahead of the Millennium Summit, he issued a report entitled “We the peoples: the role of the United Nations in the 21st century.” The report argued that the significant geopolitical changes and increased globalization experienced over the previous 50 years required the United Nations to reassess and transform the way it operates. The report called for member states to “put people at the center of everything we do. No calling is more noble, and no responsibility greater, than that of enabling men, women and children, in cities and villages around the world, to make their lives better.” At the end of the Millenium Summit, delegates adopted the Millennium Declaration, in which they committed to a new global partnership to reduce extreme poverty\n\n12\n\nPEOPLE: APPADURAI–APPIAH\n\nand set out a series of time-bound targets, which subsequently become known as the Millennium Development Goals. In the late 1990s, increased awareness of the destructive potential of epidemics such as hiv/aids pushed public health issues to the top of the global development agenda. In April 2001, Annan issued a five-point Call to Action to address the hiv/aids pandemic. Stating that it was a “personal priority,” Annan proposed the establishment of a Global aids and Health Fund, “dedicated to the battle against hiv/aids and other infectious diseases” to stimulate the increased international spending needed to help developing countries confront the hiv/aids crisis. In June of that year, the General Assembly of the United Nations committed to the creation of such a fund during a special session on aids, and the permanent secretariat of the Global Fund was subsequently established in June 2002. In 2007, Annan established the Kofi Annan Foundation, an independent, not-for-profit organization, which works to promote better global governance and strengthen the capacities of people and countries to achieve a fairer, more peaceful world. The Foundation believes that fair and peaceful societies rest on three pillars: peace and security, sustainable development, and human rights and the rule of law, and they have made it their mission to mobilize the leadership and the political resolve needed to tackle threats to these three pillars, ranging from violent conflict to flawed elections and climate change, with the aim of achieving a fairer, more peaceful world. In May 2009 Annan became a global fellow of the School of International and Public Affairs. The Global Fellows program brings students together with global practitioners to share their first-hand knowledge and experience of life as an international or public figure. He is also a fellow of the Committee on Global Thought appointed by the university. On October 7, 2010 Annan was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Global Center for Pluralism, Canada’s new international research and education center dedicated to the study and practice of pluralism worldwide. APPADURAI, Arjun (b. 1949, Mumbai) – Contemporary social-cultural anthropologist recognized as a major theorist in globalization studies. In his anthropological work, Appadurai discusses the importance of the modernity of nation-states and globalization. He was formerly a professor at the University of Chicago where he received his m.a. (1973) and Ph.D. (1976). After working there, he spent a brief time at Yale before going to the New School University. He is currently a faculty member of New York University’s Media Culture and Communication department in the Steinhardt School.\n\nPEOPLE: APPADURAI–APPIAH\n\n13\n\nFor Appadurai, the global situation is interactive rather than singly dominated. In his widely cited paper “Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy,” Appadurai argues that in this new conjuncture the invention of tradition and other identity markers becomes slippery, as the “search for certainties is regularly frustrated by the fluidities of transitional ­communication.” He also stresses that there are various fears besides that of Americanization: “it is worth noticing that for the people of Irian Jaya, Indonesianization may be more worrisome than Americanization, as Japanization may be for Koreans, Indianization for Sri Lankans, Vietnamization for Cambodians, Russianization for the people of Soviet Armenia and the Baltic republics,” and it must be acknowledged that “one man’s imagined community is another man’s political prison.” Appadurai differentiates between five dimensions of global “scapes” that flow across cultural boundaries: (1) ethnoscapes, the landscape of persons, which constitute the shifting world in which people live; (2) technoscapes, the global configuration of technologies moving at high speeds across previously impermeable borders; (3) financescapes, the global grid of currency speculation and capital transfer; (4) mediascapes, the distribution of the capabilities to produce and disseminate information and the large complex repertoire of images and narratives generated by these capabilities; and (5) ideoscapes, ideologies of states and counter-ideologies of movements, around which nationstates have organized their political cultures. Appadurai stresses that globalizing and localizing processes, or “global homogenization” and “heterogenization,” feed and reinforce each other rather than being mutually exclusive, and he calls for more anthropological studies on the “production of locality.” Works: Worship and Conflict under Colonial Rule (1981); Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy (1990), of which an expanded version is found in Modernity at Large (1996); Fear of Small Numbers (2006). APPIAH, Kwame Anthony (b. 1954, London) – British philosopher, cultural theorist, and novelist whose interests include political and moral theory, the philosophy of language and mind, and African intellectual history. Appiah was born in London, raised in Kumasi, Ghana, and educated at Bryanston School and Clare College, Cambridge, where he earned his b.a. (First Class) and Ph.D. in philosophy. Appiah taught philosophy and ­African-American studies at the University of Ghana, Cornell, Yale, Harvard, and Princeton from 1981 to 1988. He was the Bacon – Kilkenny Professor of Law at Fordham University in the fall of 2008, and until recently a Laurance S. ­Rockefeller ­University\n\n14\n\nPEOPLE: ARAB-OGLY\n\nProfessor of Philosophy at Princeton (with a cross-appointment at the University Center for Human Values). Until the fall of 2009, he served as a trustee of Ashesi University College in Accra, Ghana. He is currently a professor of philosophy and law at nyu. He has also lectured at a number of universities and other institutions worldwide, including in the us, Germany, Ghana, South Africa, and Paris. Appiah served on the board of the pen American Center and was on a panel of judges for the pen/Newman’s Own First Amendment Award. He has received several honours and many nominations. He was the 2009 finalist in the arts and humanities for the Eugene R. Gannon Award for the Continued Pursuit of Human Advancement. In 2010, he was included by Foreign Policy magazine on its list of top global thinkers. On February 13, 2012, Appiah was awarded the National Humanities Medal at a ceremony at the White House. Appiah has been influenced by the cosmopolitanist philosophical tradition, which stretches from German philosophers such as Hegel through W.E.B. Du Bois and others. In his article “Education for Global Citizenship,” Appiah outlines his conception of cosmopolitanism. He defines cosmopolitanism as “universality plus difference.” Building on this definition, he asserts that the former takes precedence over the latter, that is: different cultures are respected “not because cultures matter in themselves, but because people matter, and culture matters to people.” Initially he defined it as a problem, but later Appiah determined that the practice of a citizenship of the world and conversation is more suitable in a post-9/11 world. Therefore, according to Appiah’s take on this ideology, cultural differences are to be respected insofar as they are not harmful to people and in no way conflict with our universal concern for every human’s life and well-being. In Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers, Appiah introduces two ideas that “intertwine in the notion of cosmopolitanism” (Emerging, 59). The first is the idea that we have obligations to others that are greater than just the sharing of citizenship. The second idea is that we should never take for granted the value of life, and we should become informed about the practices and beliefs of others. Appiah has been a critic of contemporary theories of Afrocentrism. In his essay “Europe Upside Down: Fallacies of the New Afrocentrism,” he argues that current Afrocentricism is striking for “how thoroughly at home it is in the frameworks of nineteenth century European thought,” particularly as a mirror image to Eurocentric constructions of race and a preoccupation with the ancient world. He also finds irony in the conception that if the source of the West lies in ancient Egypt via Greece, then “its legacy of ethnocentrism is presumably one of our moral liabilities.” His critique of contemporary Afrocentrism\n\nPEOPLE: ARAB-OGLY\n\n15\n\nhas been strongly criticized by some of its leading proponents, such as Temple University African American Studies scholar and activist Molefi Asante, who has characterized Appiah’s work as “anti-African.” Works: The Politics of Culture, the Politics of Identity (2008); In My Father’s House: Africa in the Philosophy of Culture (1992); Color Conscious: The Political Morality of Race (1996); Kosmopolitische Patriotismus (2002); Africana: The Concise Desk Reference (2003); The Ethics of Identity (2005); Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (2006); Experiments in Ethics (2008); Lines of Descent: W.E.B.

June 14, 2001, Moscow, Russia) – Russian scientist in the fields of globalistics, demography, and social forecasting; author of many books on social forecasting and futurology. Arab-Olgy graduated from the Faculty of Geography of Lomonosov Moscow State University (1947), the graduate school of the Institute of Philosophy of the ussr (1951), was a Doctor of Philosophy (1981), and a professor. From 1966 to 1971 he was the head of the Department of Sociology, Institute of International Labor Movement Sciences of the ussr. From 1993–2001 he was Lead Researcher at the Rights Institute, Russian Academy of Science. In 1971 he was elected professor at the Sorbonne. He also worked for several journals, including Issues of Philosophy (1953–58), Issues of World and Socialism (1958–65), World Economy and International Relations (1972–86), and Communist – Free Thought (1986–94). From the late 1960s Arab-Ogly’s scientific and social activities were closely connected with the study of contemporary global issues from the perspective of population growth and the prospects for social development. His scientific works on global demographic trends were among the first in the emerging globalistics of that time. They are complex, based on the methodology of philosophy and natural science disciplines. They contain a significant proportion of criticism of the Club of Rome forecasts; warnings; and polemically developed ideas of post-industrial society. He also introduced a classification of different kinds of global forecasts by their nature and duration. Arab-Ogly actively cooperated with many international environmental and demographic organizations. In the late 1980s and early 1990s he participated in the international ecumenical movement. According to Arab-Ogly, global issues are primarily technological, and therefore not just generated by humans, but potentially solvable by humans as well. The prevention of negative consequences arising from scientific and technological progress, spontaneity and uneven social development, short-sighted\n\n16\n\nPEOPLE: ARCHIBUGI–ARENDT\n\nstate policies, and human behavior requires mobilization of the ­entirety of “human potential” – humankind’s transition to self-regulation of its activity. The further preservation and development of life on Earth will involve controlled co-evolution of humankind and its environment. His work has had a significant impact on the development of research on globalistics.

ARCHIBUGI, Daniele – Italian economic and political theorist. His research focuses on the economics and policy of innovation and technological change, the political theory of international relations, and political and technological globalization. Archibugi studied economics at the University of Rome La Sapienza, where he worked with Federico Caffè, and earned his D.Phil. at spru, University of Sussex, under the direction of Christopher Freeman and Keith Pavitt. He has worked and taught at the universities of Sussex, Naples, Cambridge, Sapienza University of Rome, luiss University of Rome, Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto and swefe University, Chengdu. He was Leverhulme Visiting Professor at the London School of Economics, and Lauro de Bosis Visiting Professor at Harvard University. In June 2006 he was appointed Honorary Professor at the University of Sussex. He currently works at the Italian National Research Council in Rome and at Birkbeck, University of London. Together with David Held, Archibuggi has been a key figure in the development of cosmopolitanism and of cosmopolitan democracy in particular, namely the attempt to apply some of the norms and values of democracy to global politics. He has advocated substantial reforms in international organizations, including the United Nations and the European Union. He has criticized the G7, G8, and G20 summits as undemocratic and argued for a more transparent gathering for global politics. He has also taken a position against a League of Democracies, arguing that the same demands would be better served by\n\nPEOPLE: ARCHIBUGI–ARENDT\n\n17\n\na democratic reform of the United Nations. He is among the promoters of a directly elected World Parliament. Archibugi and Jonathan Michie developed a taxonomy of the globalization of technology in which they distinguish among three main devices of transmission of know-how: international exploitation of innovations, global generation of innovation, and global collaborations in science and technology. As chairman of an Expert Group of the European Research Area on international collaboration in science and technology, he has pointed out that the demographic decline in Europe, combined with the lack of vocation among youngsters for hard sciences, will generate a dramatic shortage of qualified workers in less than a generation. This will jeopardize the standard of living of Europeans in key areas such as medical research, information technologies, and knowledgeintensive industries. He has argued for substantial revisions to European immigration policy in order to accommodate at least two million qualified students in science and engineering from developing countries in a decade.

ARENDT, Hannah (b. October 14, 1906, Linden, Germany; d. December 4, 1975, New York) – Political thinker, philosopher, and researcher on issues of the totalitarian epoch of the formation of global relations. Arendt was a pupil of Heidegger, from whom she adopted the phenomenological method, and a friend of Karl Jaspers. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, she fled Germany for France and in 1941 emigrated to the United States. Her comprehensive work The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951) is a comparative study in which Nazism and Stalinism are analyzed from the political and historical points of view. Much attention is paid to Arendt’s report on Eichmann’s trial in Jerusalem, published in 1963, entitled “A Report on the Banality of Evil.” In the philosophical work The Human Condition (1959), Arendt develops a theory of human action that is the result of in-depth analysis of the ancient polis, described by Plato and Aristotle. According to Arendt, justice is a part of human relations. In the system of human relations, only obligations and agreements are able to create “some isolated islands of predictability” or “isolated\n\n18\n\nPEOPLE: ARON–ARRIGHI\n\nislands of certainty in an ocean of uncertainty.” In this case, she refers to the Roman legal system as a core element of political life. Describing the issue of political violence and political power, Arendt argues that violence is carried out in accordance with the categories of means and goals. The modern man refuses to be active in politics, while political power tries to establish stability through justice, supported by mutual obligations and treaties. The proper condition for such political power is a culture of sincere communication. Arendt’s political theory is based on phenomenological anthropology and is considered an example of a global political concept. Works: The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), trans. from English I.V.

Dubin (Moscow, 2003). ARON, Ramone (b. 1905, Paris; d. 1983, Paris) – French philosopher, sociologist and political scientist. Founder of the critical philosophy of history. Political columnist for the newspapers Le Figaro (from 1947) and Express (from 1977). Professor at Collège de France (from 1970). Aron’s historical and philosophical ideas preceded the understanding of world events in the context of global integrity. By the “critical philosophy of history” he meant the foundation of the theory of historical knowledge, considering the main object of the philosophy of history to be logical/theoretical and historical issues. He understood historical science as the reconstruction of the past based on historical facts that are understood as an inner experience, rather than as an objective historical reality. However, he did not consider the science of history to be the simple and clean reproduction of what happened in the past. He believed that a sequence of events cannot be seen twice, as there is no historical recurrence. In history, every event happens only once. Aron denied the objective nature of historical facts; the past represents an irrational stream of events, devoid of objective logic. In the study of social determinism, he followed the theory of factors, according to which in the historical process there is no unilateral determination by a given factor, but rather all factors are equal. Aron rejected social progress, believed that the notion of progress is axiological, and claimed that history is dramatic and irrational. In the last years of his life Aron thought a lot about the future of human society. He believed there would come the dawn of universal history, when war and conflict between nations and states would disappear. Humanity, Aron noted, was progressing toward an entirely industrial society.\n\nPEOPLE: ARON–ARRIGHI\n\n19\n\nAron’s philosophical and historical ideas played an important role in the spiritual life of France and influenced the formation of a global outlook. They were adopted by many French historians and philosophers who opposed the prevalence of positivism in the social sciences.

ARQUILLA, John (b. 1964, usa) – American military theorist, specializing in international relations, cyber and network warfare, and cyber terrorism. Received his Ph.D. at Stanford University in 1991. Professor of defense analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School, Director of the Information Operations Centre. Received the Hamming Award in 2001, and the Schieffelin Award in 2002. Arquilla’s concept of “network cyber warfare,” which he developed together with his colleague D. Ronfeldt, is widely known. The term has been used repeatedly by former us secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld to describe the nature of the conflict in Iraq. According to Arquilla, cyber war is an attempt to gain an informational advantage over the enemy. This can be achieved by controlling cyberspace and communication, as well as by destroying the enemy’s flow of information. Cyber attack can be highly unpleasant and even subversive, but not devastating. The most famous examples of this type of social networking war have been the unexpectedly massive and highly successful performances of anti-globalists in Seattle, wa and Genoa.

June 18, 2009) – Italian scientist in the fields of politics, economics, and sociology. Professor of Sociology at Johns Hopkins University. Professor of Sociology at Fernand Brodel Centre for WorldSystems Analysis (Binghamton) from 1979. One of his most famous works was a trilogy about the origins and transformations of global capitalism. The first book in the trilogy, The Long Twentieth Century. Money, Power and the Origins of Our Time, was released in 1994. Scientific interpretation of globalization, according to Arrighi, combines several cognitive models, which together form a concept. In his paradigm, he admits the existence of a new theoretical possibility, which consists in the fact that the new historical and even philosophical and historical models again become possible as globalization gains more mature forms. Even his “long” twentieth-century concept can be considered successful in a variety of ways\n\n20\n\nPEOPLE: ASHBY–ATTFIELD\n\n(in particular, the interpretation of the historical and philosophical category “Modern era” as referring to the second half of the nineteenth century, which actually lasted until 1914). This concept can be seen as more adequate than the actual interpretation of the long nineteenth century. The relevant problem in Arrighi’s interpretation of globalization is that the specific and particular significance of globalization is negated. Like other successors of Wallerstein’s world-system theory, Arrighi’s process is also reductionist. What we intend to consider in the form of the globalization as a new phenomenon is, just in ­Arrighi’s eyes, not a new phenomenon. Concretely, Arrighi adapts analysis of the financial side of the capitalism to the present. On this basis, he denies the specifically new character of globalization. The novelty of his cyclical theory is that he combines the conservative character of cyclical theories with the most recent insights that have arisen in the last two decades because of the reconstruction of monetary capitalism. Thus, contemporary globalization represents the fourth round of global development and has a cyclical structure itself. The first iteration of the cycle is marked in medieval Genoa. Later, another cycle of financial processes manifested in the Netherlands and England in early modern times. The next iteration of the cycle occurred during the depression years of 1873–76. The process of accumulation forms a cycle, while the economy experiences a material expansion and stimulates production. In the second phase the financial expansion occurs, including speculation. We can say that the virtualization of the money economy occurs due to its effects. This interpretation does not lack a cyclical economic rationality, and certainly forms the skeleton of the global economy. However, this theory pays very little attention to political and social components, not to mention new structures in cultural systems and liberation movement. As reasonably noted by many critics, Arrighi consistently returns to the processes around capital. Taking into consideration the particularities of globalization history in the 1990s and 2000s, at which time this deficiency became evident, Arrighi’s rhetorical appeal to territoriality and imperial contexts also cannot be ignored. It creates a “production concept of capital,” sometimes a mirror image of Machiavelli, who analyzed the situation in the Italian citystates, but did not draw conclusions about the absence of central authority. In general, this is a denial not only of the other (sub)systems in favour of the economy, but also of the study of the nature of qualitative leaps that have occurred in the last twenty years in various fields, from computer science to the money economy. What is important is that, in its theoretical justification, he turns to China (Adam Smith in Beijing: Lineages of the 21st Century, 2007); however, it can be challenging to interpret this explanation due to insufficient “historical distance.”\n\nPEOPLE: ASHBY–ATTFIELD\n\n21\n\nASHBY, William Ross (b. November 15, 1903; d. 1972, London) – English mathematician, cybernetician, author of Introduction to Cybernetics (translated into Russian in 1959), a pioneer in the study of complex systems. He graduated from the University of Cambridge. In 1948 Ashby invented the homeostat, a unit of four magnetic systems with cross feedbacks. When unstable, the magnets move, accidentally changing the wiring system of the homeostat and finding a new position at which the state of equilibrium is achieved. The homeostat has an option for self-organization: it can to some extent change the parameters of placement and adjust to a sustainable equilibrium with the environment at a certain randomness in the internal structure (for example, when changing parameters or relations with the environment, partial failure, and so on). The term “self-organization,” introduced by Ashby in 1947, refers to the control of processes (spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal) in an open system through the coordinated interaction of multiple elements. In the 1960s the term was applied to systems theory, and in the 1970s and 1980s to the physics of complex systems. Ashby also formulated the basic principle of control: the diversity of the control system must not be less than the diversity of the controlled object. In other words, in order to control a large (complex) system, the control system must contain its own variety. Because it is impossible to create such a complex organ in practice (for example, in the economic system), it is reasonable to refer to management subsystems, which solve problems independently in a relatively small area of the system. Thus, the principle provides a theoretical hierarchical structure to economic systems. It also requires the empowerment of information processing, which can be achieved, for example, when creating an automated control system. Ashby’s theories are crucial for modern globalistics faced with the challenge of managing the global world. ATTFIELD, Robin (b. 1941) – British historian of science and philosophy, specializing in environmental philosophy and environmental ethics; teacher in the Department of Philosophy, University of Cardiff, since 1968. Attfield represents the conservative trend in environmental ethics, opposed to a radical break with the scientific, philosophical, and cultural heritage of the Western European tradition. According to Attfield, the complex of “­management of nature” ideas as an expression of the global mission of humanity is quite firmly rooted in Western culture, which still has not lost its value. Management of nature is associated with environmental responsibility, and an environmentally reconsidered ethical utilitarianism tradition is sufficient to determine the philosophical assumptions and the general principles of environmental ethics. Attfield criticizes moral atomism, recognized as ­determining the benefit and vital interests of the individual species, as well\n\n22\n\nPEOPLE: BAICHUN–BARBER\n\nas holism, p ­ referring the good of the entire biosphere. From his point of view, rejecting normative ethics, with its insistence on the inviolability of individual rights, holism precludes a positive attitude towards all living things. ­Modifying ethical utilitarianism, he uses the idea of the self-worth of individual living beings and their species. According to Attfield, living beings are endowed with moral status by analogy with humans and their spiritual, intellectual, and ­psychic abilities. The more distinctly a living being displays these abilities, the higher its status. Unlike supporters of the “land ethic,” Attfield believes that the land, inanimate things, ecosystems, and the biosphere as a whole (as well as the noosphere) do not have any moral status.

May 17, 1965, Heylun-jian, China) – Chinese philosopher, translator, and professor at Beijing Normal University; co-author of the international encyclopedic dictionary Globalistics (2006). Baichun graduated from Harbin Normal University in 1988, and from the graduate school of the Faculty of Philosophy, St. Petersburg State University, in 1993. He has participated in and organized many international forums, congresses, and conferences. He is the founder and director of the Research Centre of Russian Culture at Beijing Pedagogical University, where leading foreign and Chinese scholars regularly lecture on issues of culture, religion, the global world, and modern globalization. Baichun views globalization from the perspective of the opportunities it provides to the traditional cultures of individual nations for entry into the world arena. Much attention is paid to Russia, China, India, and other countries that are developing their own cultures apart from the dominant Western culture, thereby changing the modern world and the prejudice that shapes the future of humankind and, ultimately, world civilization. Noting that globalization can only be controlled through intercultural dialogue, he pays considerable attention to the relations between East and West, in which a special dialogue between Russian and Chinese cultures occupies a special position.

BAN, Ki-moon (b. 1944, North Chungcheong Province) – Eighth and current Secretary-General of the United Nations. Before becoming Secretary-General, Ban was a career diplomat in South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in the United Nations. He entered diplomatic service the year he graduated from university, accepting his first post in New Delhi, India. In the foreign ministry, he established a reputation for modesty and competence. The Secretary-General of the United Nations has the ability to influence debate on nearly any global issue. Although unsuccessful in some areas, Ban’s predecessor, Kofi Annan, was successful in increasing the un peacekeeping presence and in popularizing the Millennium Development Goals. Ban early on identified global warming as one of the key issues of his administration. In a speech before the un General Assembly on March 1, 2007, Ban emphasized his concerns about global warming: “For my generation, coming of age at the height of the Cold War, fear of nuclear winter seemed the leading existential threat on the horizon. But the danger posed by war to all humanity – and to our planet – is at least matched by climate change.” BARBER, Benjamin R. (b. August 2, 1939, New York) – American political theorist and author. He is Senior Research Scholar at the Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society of The Graduate Center, The City University of New York; president and founder of the Interdependence Movement; Walt Whitman Professor of Political Science Emeritus, Rutgers University; and Senior Fellow at the usc Center on Public Diplomacy since 2005. Barber served as an outside adviser to President Bill Clinton and a foreign policy adviser to Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential campaign. He has advised political parties and political leaders in the uk, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Finland, and Italy on civic education and participatory institutions, and has done the same, more controversially, with civil society and government leaders in Turkey, the Emirates, Libya, and China. As a political theorist, Barber argues for a renewed focus on civil society and engaged citizenship as tools for building effective democracy, particularly in the post-Cold War world. His current work examines the failure of nationstates to address global problems, and argues that cities and intercity associations are more effectively addressing shared concerns.

Barlybaev graduated from Lomonosov Moscow State University in 1972 and taught political economy at Bashkir State University (bsu) from 1976–89. He served as head of the Economics Department of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bashkortostan from 1990–92; chairman of the Fund’s assets, then chairman of the State Committee of the Republic of Bashkortostan for managing state property, from 1992–95; Vice President for Economics at bsu, 1995–99; Deputy of the State Duma, 1999–2003; and Professor, Russian Academy of Public Administration under the President of the Russian Federation, since 2004. Barlybaev was one of the developers of legislation for, and a participant in, reforming the economy of the Republic of Bashkortostan in the ­post-Soviet ­period. Since 2000 he has been researching the concept of sustainable development and issues of globalization in the context of philosophical a­ nthropology. On the basis of his analysis of the interrelation between nature, humans, and society, he designates a special system – bioanthroposocioagrotechnosphere – and examines its structure. He describes eighteen p ­ arameters of human ­nature in the structure of a single system, which determine the quality of orientations and spheres of globalization, and finally the appropriate measures for the transition to sustainable development. This approach allows him to go beyond the concepts according to which human nature has no system integrity, globalization processes are limited to a couple of directions, and measures for the transition to sustainable development do not have concrete practical content.

BAUDRILLARD, Jean (b. July 27, 1929, Reims, France; d. March 6, 2007, Paris) – French sociologist, cultural specialist, postmodern philosopher, and photographer. Professor of Sociology at University of Paris in Nanterre. One of the most famous thinkers on the phenomenon of postmodernism, and on the contemporary state of Western civilization, which is characterized by the proliferation of artificial, non-genuine formations and mechanisms, and simulacra of social existence. Baudrillard introduced the concept of “hyperreality” as the development of the Marxist concept of the superstructure. The basis of hyperreality is a simulation. The units of the hyperreal are simulacra, signs or not self-identical phenomena, referring to something else, thus simulative. He developed the doctrine of the three orders of simulacra – copies, functional analogs, and simulacra themselves. He included in the third order of simulacra all modern phenomena, including money, public opinion, and fashion, that operate on the principle of symbolic exchange. Baudrillard became known to the general public in 1991 when he published the essay “The Gulf War did Not Take Place,” about the anti-Iraq campaign. Based on his theory of the “hyperreality of simulacra,” Baudrillard concluded that this campaign was the first “virtual war” in world history, the events of which were designed by the media. Baudrillard developed this theory further in reference to the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001: he considered them the beginning of “World War iv, in which globalism opposes itself” (“The Spirit of Terrorism”).

BAUMAN, Zygmunt (b. 1925, Poznan, Poland) – English sociologist. Participated in World War ii in the Polish Army, formed in the ussr. After the war he taught sociology at the University of Warsaw. In 1968 he emigrated to Israel, where until 1972 he taught at Tel Aviv University. He then moved to the uk and is currently an honorary professor at the University of Leeds.\n\n26\n\nPEOPLE: DE BEAUVOIR–BECK\n\nBauman analyzes in detail the social and cultural issues of globalization in the context of the social and psychological characteristics of a consumer society. He sees the basic meaning of globalization in an uncertain, uncontrollable, independent nature and the absence of central control of processes in the world. Bauman considers globalization and territorialization (the formation and maintenance of a set of weak states) as two sides of the redistribution of sovereignty, power, and freedom of action on a global scale. Globalization results in the redistribution of privilege and deprivations, wealth and poverty, power and powerlessness, freedom and limitations. Dissemination of quasisovereignties and territorial division do not indicate the arrival of a large number of equal partners on the world stage.

DE BEAUVOIR, Simone (b. September 1, 1908, Paris; d. April 14, 1986, Paris) – French writer and philosopher, whose work had a great influence on the development of the feminist movement and women’s emancipation; supporter of humanistic existentialism; partner of J.P. Sartre. She received the Prix Goncourt for her novel Les Mandarins (1954). In 1949, de Beauvoir published The Second Sex, a fundamental historical and philosophical study of the complex issues related to the role of women in the modern world: what is “feminine destiny” and what is behind the concept of the “natural function of sex”; how and why is the situation of women in this world different from that of men; is a woman able in principle to establish herself as a complete person, and if so, in what circumstances; what conditions restrict the freedom of women and how can they be overcome. The Second Sex has a special place in feminist literature, functioning rather as a women’s bible for several generations. It is one of the most comprehensive, fundamental historical and philosophical studies of issues associated with women. Works: Pour une morale de l’ambiguit (1947); Le deuxime sexe (1949); Le Mandarins (1954); La Vieillesse (1970). BECK, Ulrich (b. 1944; d. 2015) – German sociologist; professor at Munich University and London School of Economics; theorist of the concepts of “reflexive modernization” and “risk society.” Known for his work on the periodization of the modern age and the complex investigation of contemporary globalization. Founder and chief editor of the journal Soziale Welt.\n\nPEOPLE: DE BEAUVOIR–BECK\n\n27\n\nBeck sees the origins of globalization in the economic sphere and links this phenomenon with the activity of transnational corporations and the ­formation of a global economy. The main issue, associated with globalization, is that political view beyond the traditional categorical frameworks of the nation-state, political aftermaths, caused by the influence of economic mechanisms. This view is expressed through the opening to political interference and control of institutions of industrial society, which have traditionally been independent from it. The economy functioning on a global scale undermines the foundations of the national economy and the national state. Globalization policy aims not only to get rid of union restrictions, but also to weaken the politics of nation-states. He introduced the concept of “subpolitics,” describing it as an extra chance at action and usurpation of power outside the political system, which is obtained by corporations acting on the whole space of the world community. Based on his analysis of the value and ideological components of contemporary global processes, Beck considers the differences between the concepts of “globality” and “globalization,” on the one hand, and “globalism,” on the other. Globalism means that the world market displaces or replaces political activity; it is an ideology of domination of the world market – the ideology of ­neoliberalism. It operates on a purely economic basis and reduces the multidimensionality of globalization to only one – economic – dimension, and therefore the ecological, cultural, political, social, and civilizational aspects of globalization become subject to the world market supremacy measurement. At the ideological core of globalismis the elimination of the fundamental difference between politics and economics. The main objective of politics is to define the legal, social, and environmental framework according to which economic activity is carried out. Globalism makes it possible to control the state, society, culture, and foreign policy as a simple organization. Globality means that everyone lives in a global society in which there is no place for the isolated spaces. World society implies a commonality of social relations that cannot be integrated in national state policy or be determined by it. Meanwhile, the key role is played by self-identification, that is, how the world society is perceived by its members, to what extent the peoples and cultures of the world perceive themselves in the mutual intertwining of their differences, and to what extent this self-perception within the global society becomes a significant factor of behavior. Globalization is a process by which nation-states and their sovereignty are intertwined in a web of transnational actors and subjected to their powerful capabilities. An essential feature of the current state of the world is the\n\n28\n\nPEOPLE: BELL–BENTLEY\n\ni­ mpossibility of eliminating the globality that has already emerged. Thus, while there are various logics of ecological, cultural, economic, political, and sociocivic globalization, irreducible to each other, they can only be deciphered and understood in terms of their interdependencies.

January 25, 2011) – American sociologist, w ­ riter, philosopher, author of the theory of post-industrial society. Bell graduated from City College in New York, then from Columbia University. In 1960 he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. From 1959 to 1969 he taught sociology at Columbia University, and from 1969 to 1990 he was Professor of Sociology at Harvard University. In 1999 he received the Alexis de Tocqueville Award for humanism. In his first major publication, The End of Ideology, Bell laid out his thesis on the exhaustion of the existing political ideologies. He offered up moderate social reformism, free markets, and civil liberties to replace the “programmed” ideologies of the time – fascism and communism. In American scientific communities he became one of the leading theorists of the social and political sciences. In 1973, Bell gained worldwide fame with The Coming of Post-Industrial Society, in which he posited the transition from a society based on industrial economics and capitalism, to a post-industrial society based on knowledge – a “knowledge society.” Rapid scientific and technological progress, the development of information and communication technologies, the growing influence of scientific and expert communities, as well as the centralization of power are the main indicators of post-industrial society. Bell also examines cultural aspects of perturbations, arising contradictions of a transitional society. He addressed this and other issues in Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism, published in 1976. By 1980 he was already referring to a new “information society,” and he predicted that scientific and technological advances in the sphere of communications would have a direct effect on the scientific learning process and on the specifics of future forms of human employment, which would be radically transformed as a result of the transition to post-industrial society. Bell described himself as “a socialist in economics, a liberal in politics and a conservative in culture.” Works: The End of Ideology: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties (New York, 1965); The Coming Post-Industrial Society (Moscow, 1999);\n\nPEOPLE: BELL–BENTLEY\n\n29\n\n“­Social Frameworks of the Information Society,” in New Technocratic Wave in the West (Moscow, 1986), pp. 330–342; Era of Disunity (with V.

He is a professor of sociology and public administration at the University of the Philippines Diliman, as well as executive director of Focus on the Global South. Born in Manila, Philippines, Bello became a political activist following the declaration of martial law by then-president Ferdinand Marcos on September 21, 1972. Educated at Princeton University, where he did his Ph.D. in sociology in 1975, he subsequently taught at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was a research associate with the Center for South East Asian Studies. He served as executive director of the Institute for Food and Development ­Policy (Food First) in Oakland, California prior to founding Focus on the Global South, a policy research institute based in Bangkok, Thailand. He is also a guest professor at Binghamton University, where his lectures focus predominantly on issues of globalization. Bello currently sits as a member of Congress in the Philippines’ House of Representatives, where he serves as the political party Akbayan’s second nominee. In 2003, Bello was awarded the Right Livelihood Award, whose website describes him as “one of the leading critics of the current model of economic globalization, combining the roles of intellectual and activist.” He is also a fellow of the Transnational Institute (based in Amsterdam), and is a columnist for Foreign Policy in Focus. In March 2008 he was named Outstanding Public Scholar for 2008 by the International Studies Association. Bello currently sits on the board of directors of the International Forum on Globalization.

Two awards have been named for him: the Bentley Book Prize (est. 2012) of the World History Association and the Jerry Bentley Prize in World History of the American Historical Association (est. 2014). In his 1993 book Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and ­Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times, Bentley examines processes of cultural exchange and religious conversion before modern times. His 1996 pamphlet “Shapes of World History in Twentieth-Century Scholarship” discusses the historiography of world history. Bentley’s interests included processes of cross-cultural interaction and cultural exchange in modern times. In his works, he separates time into the following periods: early complex societies, 3500 to 500 bce; the formation of classical societies, 500 bce to 500 ce; the postclassical era, 500 to 1000 ce; an age of cross-cultural interaction, 1000 to 1500 ce; the origins of global interdependence, 1500 to 1800 ce; an age of revolution, industry, and empire, 1750 to 1914 ce; and contemporary global realignments, 1914 to the present.

March 17, 1929, Vienna) – Austrian Lutheran theologist and sociologist, living in the United States, a representative of the socioconstructivist field in sociology. Berger’s major works are devoted to the development of a phenomenological sociology of knowledge, sociology of religion, the theory of modernization, cultural globalization, and the development of the “third world.” As a sociologist of religion, Berger insisted on the tendency to revitalize religion in modern society. Although he publicly acknowledged in the late 1980s that religion is not a dominant social force, he noted that in many cases (e.g. in the United States) it asserts itself much more persistently now than in the past. He points to the fact that pluralism and the globalized world fundamentally affect the way an individual experiences a state of religious belief, where faith is increasingly considered an individual search for personal religious preferences.\n\nPEOPLE: BERGER–BERNAL\n\n31\n\nIn his work Berger paid great attention to the issue of cultural g­ lobalization. He considered language, the business elite or “club of intellectuals,” social movements, and popular culture to be its driving forces. In 2004 he c­ o-authored The Many Faces of Globalization: Cultural Diversity in the Modern World with Samuel Huntington. Exploring the phenomenon of globalization from the positions of five superpowers, the authors aim to prove the existence of a global culture. Despite the fact that globalization has American roots, according to the authors, it is wrong to regard it as a centrally directed force, like classic imperialism. They instead analyze the primary trends that constitute global culture. Berger’s most famous work is Social Construction of Reality, a treatise on the sociology of knowledge (1966), co-written with Thomas Luckmann. Works: Social Construction of Reality (with T.
