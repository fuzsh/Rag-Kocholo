Substantively, it has been a very good year. In every discipline, whether one be concerned with the na- ture of matter, the structure of the universe, planet earth, the nature of life^ortbebehaviorof amanasasoidalbeing, the yearluisbeeiiiDftriGed by aterling accompKshineinfc. Our sense of uodeirBtanding oontinueB to expand beyond any ezpectatioi^ hsAd mumt youth by thoae of ns hm gathered today. If there is one salient conclusion that emerges, it is that everything IS vastly more complicated than wc had once imagined : the cosmos ana its immense unexplained phenomena; the atomic nucleus and its myr- iftd mtorconversions of matter and energy ; the medianisms of chemi- cal readdons; the fonnation of eajih^ crnet and depoaitkm of an bodies; the stracture, metabolism and regulatory controls of living organisms ; the multiplicity of phenomena and innumerable intercon- nections with the central nervous system. And certainly the once warmly regarded sociological and economic theories are entirely too crude as eitlier descriptors or predictors. ' My favorite set of findings for the year, to dramatically demonstrate bow much more complicated are natural phBuomena l^ian we expected and how mnch we have yet to learn — ^and you will forgive my parochial reference — concern the &tructore and functioning of DNA, in widch an alphabet of four letters is utilized to spell out thrf^o-letter words. In at least one family of viruses, where there is a great premium for compressing as much genetic information as possible into a minimum of physical material, the linear sequence of bases is actually \"read\" in aU three possible reading frames, so that large portions of tiie same linear sequence direct the syntheses of three distinct functional pro- teins! Evolution appears to be the graatiost of all cryptographers! Whether similar arrangements operate in procaryotic or eukarr^otic chromosomes is as yet unknown. In complete contra.st, in eukaiyotic genome-s the sequence of bases responsible for synthesis of a given pro- tein may be interrupted several times by runs of hundreds of bases whidi, at least for me formatioin of the protein in question, are com- pletely silent and untransoribed. It is not dear how synthesis of the uninterrupted polypeptide chain is managsd^ bn£ the arrangement af- fords opportunity both for the evolutionary appearance of new pro- teins and for regulation of the rate of protein synthesis. Neither of' these circumstances had been anticipated. Everything is more compli- cated, more wondrous than we had imagined. ' Copyrighted material 2 Patently, our work is far from done. !Many pfreat surprises must surely remain in store; deeply satisfying as has been the progress of ecience in our tim^ the best is yet to come. But it will not be easy. The more remote from our sexises, the more subtle, tike more profound the phenomenon that we wish to probsy the more difficult, the more demanding, fuad ipso farfo, the more expensive M^ill be the eifort iei|Qited to gftin a foothold at the neact level of understanding. And from that standpoint, how ^^0 the affairs of science in Wash- ington? There are reasons for satisfaction. This Administration's team of leaders of the g ovOf i H uent^ sdenoe and technology programs is now in place. And a competent team it is. Ftank Press, a front rank seiantist of sreat good tudgment, continues to enjoy a comfort- able rnpport with the rresiaent and ^yifh the major fij^ures of the Executive Office. Although he lacks a PSAC, he draws assistance from a series of well constituted ad h4yc panels. Rob Perrv is well iiied to direct B. ^ D. in the Department of Defense: Don Fredrick- fion and Hans Stetten, tried and true, continue at NIH; Didc Atldn* son and Geom Pimentel more than amply warrant our trust at the helm of the NSF; Norm Hackei nian has been supefb as Chairman of tlio National Science Board — I hope that his soon -to-be-chosen successor will do as well : Bob Frosch and Al Tjovelace are scientific administrators of proven competence in charge of NASA; John Deutsch, in charge of research at the Department of Energy, is an ^excellent scientist of good scientific taste and judgment; Bill Menard, -who has just been sworn in as Director of the Geological Survey iipon our recommendation, has our complete confidence. Don Kennedy mav well be the most talented scientist who has ever led the Food and Dmg Administration nnd KmpRt Ambler at the Bureau of Standards warrants his place in the succession of distinguished direc- tors of that organization. It is no secret tliat I was disturbed when the Administration aocepted- the resigfnation of Bob White as Administrator of NOAA and doubly 80 when he was succeeded by an attorney rather than a scientist. Hiat statement in no way reflects on the competence, jiidfrmont. or integrity of Richard Frank; It is a simple statement of principle. I was yet furtlier disturbed when an attorney was also appointed to the slot of Dei>utv Dir-ector of that agency. However, I subsided when informed fthat three of the scientists whom we had reoonmundcd for the Deputy^ fMMt had been approached and bad dedined. NOAA has, however, placed excellent scientists at the head of its operating: programs; in- deed, two of them were the chairmen of the relevant NKO cornmittees. In sum, this is an excellent first-line team, and the scientific com- munity as well as the nation should be pleased. Their success will be ours. . , . ji J At OTA, Mim Daddario, the founding Director, has rengned and his place taken by Russell Peterson, erstwhile Chairman of the Council on Enviionmental Quality and former Governor of Delaware. Patent- ly, the results aia not yet in for OTA ; it remains to be demonstrated wliether this or^nization can achieve the ends for which it. was created. Its politicization, when the Act wns amended on the House floor to create a \"Technology Assessment Board\" which is really a Copyrighted material 1 3 joint Congressional committee with full authority to direct the fano* tioning of OTA, freighted this fledgling organization with baggage which has been a serious burden and may yet prove to be simply too heavy to carry. OTA has engaged the goodwill and eliorts of some of the natioifs leading scientists, engineers, and physicians, but they have laboi-ed under a handicap. All of us are indebted to ^lim Dad- dario bore the brunt of tliat {process and wish Buss Peterson well as he gets off to a fresh start In several ways, the problems that now beset American science are the consequence of its success. From the time when the Council of tliis Arndemy once argued that grants from the Federal Government in supxx^ft of research at universities are undesirable and may be un- constitutional, we have come to a federal Iv. & D. budget in excess of $27 billion of which $3^ billion supports research in &e uniyer8itie& In the eight years following the peak of federal support of basic research — in fiscal 1967 — the philoeophicnl force of the Mansfield Amendment, external political pressure for the attainment of demon- strably applicable results and the understandable impulse to achieve early practical results, rendered mission a£2:encies with declhiing pur- chasing power decreasingly comfortable in the support of basic re- search — whatever they thought of its BBcessity or desirability. Total federal support for basic research declined by twenty percent, in conr stant dollars. It is gratifying to note that this trend is being reversed by the present Administration. Particularly welcome is the reinstitu- tion in the Defense Department of a program of suppoi-t for relevant fundamental research, led by Ruth Davis. Not only is the financial support welcome, I am pleased tliat a step will be taken to beirin to rebuild the broken bridges between the Department and the ^ atiou's seientific community. Meanwhile, tlianks to the growth of its appropriation, the National Science Foundation has come to have the lead role for the Federal Government in the support of most areas of physical science and many areas of biolofrical and social science. That prospect would ha\\ e de- lighted those who drafted \"Science The Endless Frontier,\" the bhie- print for NSI\\ and those who have led the Foundation for a quarter centurr. But NSF ie now a billifHi dollar a year agency thereby realiz- ing Bill MeElroy's goal. XIH is more than twice as large. No endeavor tiiat utilizes tax dollars on that scale can be expected to escape political scrutiny or political maneuvering. They have become higldy visible and potentially attractive to both the Executive Branch and the Con- gress as an instrument for accomplishing more or other than the sup^ port of science alone. And therein lies the danger — danger that the budgets or programs of these agencies will come to seem attractive as instruments for catalysis of social change, or for sending signals to selected political constituencies. We should not be surprised if, in the future, such attempts may be made; should we see such in the' fifing, we should be prepared to ix?mind all concerned that the prima t v mission of the National Science Foundation is to assure the strength of the national scientific endeavor and that the mission of NIH is to support that research which will enhance our cai>abihty to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease. Other considerations snould nsA distort or handicap the achievement of those ob jectives. Copyrighted material 4 Ovor the yoars, the role and composition of the Xational Science l5oanl hiivo cliangcd considerably. When the funds available to the Foundation were of the order of those available to the trustees of the Rockefeller Foundation, for example, that Board could consider and. approve individiial actions much as does the Board of the Koekefeller Foundation which it was designed to emulafo. Xow that the nTimial budi^et more nearly approximates the capital of the Rockefeller Foun- dation, the Board can no longer exercise such detailed oversight but its role in framing policy has become all important. In the construction of that Board there are lesritimate pressures to assure repi-esentation of private and public institutions, large universi- ties and small collets, industrv, minorities, and women, as well as that vasruely defined entity termed \"the public interest,'' while also assuring^ w ide geographic distribution of the membei-ship. I trust that, amoQ^ thf'so. thoro will also be a sufficient cadre of genuine carrl cfirr^nnj^ scientists to assure that the values cherished by the scientific commu- nity are adequately represented as well. Accordingly, I await witli great interest the appointments to the National Science Board which are espjected next month. Presidents Ford and Carter have found satisfaction in the fact that total federal support for basic research in the current fi'^cal year, in constant dollars, has finally been restored to the level of the previous high, fiscal year 1967. And ^ve all were cheered by the fact that the President's Dudget request for fiscal year 1979, if approved by the rV)!igress, would provide a five percent increase, in constant dollars. Keveilheless, from all scientific disciplines, one hears that available funds are woefully insufficient to support the scientific enterprise. It is im nortant to note the basis for this seeming discrepancy. In the deciido 1967 to 1977, the total community of emplovorl soion- tists with doctoral degrees virtually doublcrl from 1?)5,000 to 207,000. Across tlint decade, the number of Ph.D.'s in tlie physical sciences grew bv 5.9 percent per year, those in the social sciences by 8.3 percent per year and those in the life sciences by 9.5 percent per year. By no means itU are engaged in the performance of research ; but it may reasonably be assumml that the fraction of all those so i>repared who desire to do research has not changed sign i fi c a ntly over this period. Second, each year, the work of Fcienco grows more sophisticated, re- quiring more elaborate equipment and more ti-ained liaiuls. hence grows more expensive. Tt is difficult to assign a value to this factor, but if it is merely 3.5 percent ]^r year, then the growth of the scientific com- munity and increased sophistication, combined, would have required an increase in funding of 10 percent per year in constant dollars if the research community were to be maintained at the same level of relative efiectiveness as was the community of 1967. Presf^iiflv nvailnble funds are perhaps one-third of those projected by such a calculation. When, to these circumstances is added the increasing fraction of total appro- priations for research that is utilized to defray indirect costs, it is easy to understand the widespread anguish among us. . ' Patently, federal financial support of basic research, in constant dollars, is'not going to double or treble in the foreseeable future. And in Tiiht of that drcumstance, the fact that, for demographic reasons, the flow of young people into science will soon begin to subside may appear Copyrighted material 5 to be a cause for cheer, rather than otherwise, providing that a reason- able portion of all the brightest young people will continue to End But therein lies the rub. That same demographic decline, •with sihrinking student bodies, has already been discounted by those re* sponsible for universities' staffing patterns. The opportunities of young ■scientists for tenure track positions are being severely restricted and young people know it. Hence, we could stand in danger of losing much of an entire generation of young scientists — a loss that should be sim- ply muusoeptable to the nation. Accordingly, it is impemtive that fed« •eral science-supporting agencies be dearly cognizant of these circum- stuices, that they prepare to fund much larger numbers of postdoc- toral fellows than ever before, and with lonc^er tenure than in the past. Moreover, all federal agencies, particularly the National Science Foundation, should prepare to fund on a substantial scale, in all disciplines, programs comparable to the Career Development Awards of the National Institutes of Health, designed for individuals more 'Or less at the assistant professor leveL with positicms vondisafed for «t least five years and renewable once. Such programs could provide -opportunity for younff and mid-career scientists while the present cohort of tenured faculty moves through time. This will not be inex- pensive but it may prove absolutely essential if the vitality of basic research is to be sustained in American universities. The research project grant and contract system was developed by the Federal Gorenunent partly as an outgrowth of the pattern of research fimding through the OSRD during World War II, partly mimicking the pattern developed earlier by the great philanthropic foundations. This arrangement avoided the pitfall of reliance on di- rect support of universities by a Federal Government that lias delib- erately eschewed responsibility for their fiscal stability and avoided conflicts such as those involved in supporting church-related institu- tions. And it enabled support of talented investigators wherever they may be. The research project grant/contract system has been an enor- mous success. The Peer &view System which is at its heart has occa- sionally been attacked on various grounds but has successfully with- stood each onslaught. The report of our Committee on Science and Public Policy in this regard should be available very soon. But we have discovered that the piper payer does call the time; witness the applications for funds for interdisciplinary or applied research whtai such agency programs beckon. In response to external pressures for greater \"accountability,** program managers in every agency have demanded of investigators apj^ieations and diverse re- ports in ever finer detail, demanded in advance detailed descriptions of experiments as yet undone, denying seasoned investigator the flexibility of following wherever the i-esearch trail takes them, deny- ing them tlie iiexibilit}^ to use available funds as wisely as possible. And as, oonoomitantly, the period for which reseaioh snppcvt Is eom- mitted shortens, due to the understandable desire of eaen agency to spread its funds and support among as many promising investigators as possible, fin increasing fraction of each investigator's effort is claimefl by the task of applying and reporting. Under these circum- stances, investigators find themselves propounding applications for Copyrighted material \"safe research,\" describing work tliat the}' doom tmlikolv to fail. To be sure, both invest igatoi-s and agency program managers will have satisfied the requirement for accountability. No one will have daift what be i^idd not have done. Bt tccaanting standards there has been no fraud. But the nation will have been cheated, deprived of ydiii Buf^ happen were each investigator given opportunity to essay his ohancior rlrenm?. The time has come to reverse this process. Divoi so altemativo ho- haviors and arrangements are available. We know tliom in tlie .s. It is time for the agencies to so plan, to gain the concurrence of their Congressioiial comnittees and, while we can, restore the benevolent partnership between the government and sciaifle, particularly aca* demic science which, in only two decades, gave our country the ^*eat- est scientific enterprise the world has evoi' known. Othoi wiso. *f may become necessary to consider some alternative to the project grant/ contract system which has linked the goveruxnent and universities in this endeavor. Nor am I out of sympathy with the bele^^ered presidents of our univereities. A substantial researdi enterprise on campus really does engender substantial indirort costs, no small fi-action of which has been generated by the regulatory activities of the Federal Govern- ment. To be sure, a univoi sity wliicli pT'o])oses to bo the l(x*us of «ii<-]i an enterprise should undoi-stand its own obligation to be more than merely host. Given the multitude of pressures upon each such insti- tution, the Federal Govcnunent understands tliat it must defray a substantial share, perhaps the full share of the total indirect costs associated with the federally 8upp<»ted research enterprise. I cannot speak to the equity or appropriateness of the newly annoimoed for- mula for computation of such costs or to the reasons that the formula will have such disparate effects on different universities. But, until all universities use essentially iniiform accountinof practices, that problem will probably remain. By so doing it will become far simpler to demonstrate that claims for the indirect costs of research are just that, not a bid lor funds to support some other uniwsity fimotioR. And there is another price for For seveml years, numbers of individuals, aware of scientific accomplishment, aware of the inter- play between science and technolo^r}'. have held science to account for the undesirable consequences of insufficiently regulated technolo^n^: they would punish science not for what it has learned but for the uses to which that knowledge has been put. Today we are becoming aware of those who would inhibit further scientific progress out of concern fbr what society mtjbt^ one day do with knowledge we do not yet have. That flupely underHes the exaggerated fears expreased ior the safety of research with recombinant DNA. It has been necessary to defend this remarkably successful endeavor ajrainst the threat of excessive regulation, occasioned by allegations of imanrined but undocumented attendant risks. In view of other recent events, we are coi-tain soon to witness attempts to regulate research in reproductive biology because of the asnrted luk sf wtpuSHf easily imainned, but thus nr, totally undocumented meoBss of the vesearob itself. And tiiat quarrel may be sven move bitter thm that conoenmig feoombinant DNA. Be on guard. Copyrighted material 7 ' The fall off in industrial productivity, the decline of innovative new industrial staits lias become a matter of widespread coiicem. It is -oleariy a threat to tlie vitality of the Ameiieaa ecoiK>my and hence to much else that we cherish. The Council Committee on National Science Policy, chaired by Frank Westheimer, has several timeB discussed this prohlGin. The discussion has been led by Ralph Gomory whose absence from the Coinicil will be a sore loss. These same concerns have been much on the minds of our Committe on Science and Public Policy and of the Council of the National Academv of Engineering as well. We have ag^d to conduct, in the Assembly of Engineering of the Na- tional Meeeaich Cooncil, an intensive and thoughtful analysis of that problem. One token of that problem, which may or may not be a major aspect thereof, is the decline in tlio conduct of basic research in indus- trial laboratories. Only a handful of industrial laboratories continue to engage in this endeavor. American industry, therefore, is losing the listening posts wherebv it tuned in on world science and may, in future, lack for those wlio both stimulate and set standards for applied xeseaidL That is a problem for each technology-based company. Meanwhile, this circumstance has given new currency to the idea that the Federal Government should provide support for basic re- search in industrial settings. That is an appropriate use of the IR & D funds that accompany Federal contracts for applied research and de- velopment. And we have long discussed the potential merits of joint university-industry r^arch. But, for the nonce, I consider support of basic research in industrial laboratories to be an inappropriate course for the goyemment. If, indeed, there might be provided a significant increment in the support of fundfiinenM research at this tiine» it should be utilized instead to upgrade and replace tlie scientific equipment of laboratories now limited in capability by outmoded or worn-out major equipment. Proo^rain managers should no longer be surprised by tlie fact that in a genuine sense, scientific ec|uipment depreciates very rapidly, that many forms of apparatus sfatrald he wntten off in about five years. Scientific equipment should not be regarded as labor-saving devices; it determines that questions may be asked and what understandings may be wrested from nature. r^et me turn now to life at the Academy and the National Research Council. With tlie election this morning, tlie total membership of tJie Academy has reached 1,299; the total number of members elected since 1868 including the initial group of forty-eight is 2,199. We ap- pear to be a lopg-hved lot. Nine members of the Academy have now passed their ninetieth birthdays of wliom Joel Elldebrand, who is well past ninety-six, is the dean. The others, in descending Older of seniority are ifarvey Fletcher, Walter Miles, Elvin Stalcman, Alex- ander Wetfnore, Jerome Hunsaker, Raymond Birge, Edwin Fred, and Will Rose. Michael Heideibe^ ger will join that distinguished coni- pany on Saturday of this week. We are proud, indeed, to share mem- Denni^ with thmn^ And in yiew of the oualificstions of th^ whom you elected to m^nbeisliip today, it is evident that the membership of the Academv continues to fly the standard of Newton, Darwin, Max- well, and Wiliard Gibbs. Indeed, as Boh Sinsheimer has recently noted, • . culturally, we have cloned Galileo many thousand fold.\" 41-80e— 79 — s Copyrighted material 8 The National Research Council continues to function well in its \\mrrent mode. Wliile tho Govorninnr Board monitors overall programs and policies, decisions concerning specific study projects to be under- taken are determined by the 65 members of the Academy who, together with 35 members of X^VE and lOM are among the 144 distinmiished scientists who constitute the Assemblies and OMiimissions of the Be- •searoh Council. The magnitude of this activity, in which each project requires an appropriate committee, will be evident from the fact that. dnT iTri\" calendar 1077. 2.01 (> individual appointments were made to mmmittee meml>ership. (22^ Tvere memljers of tliis Academy, 163 mem- U'v^ of XAE. and 79 members of lOM.) Of the total. 43 percent were individuals wlio had never previously served on anv NRC committee. Hie mean age of those appointed was 50.1 years, about as you might expect, but they ranged from 26 to 83 years of age. From time to time you have received information concerning the specific subject matter under consideration by this large, diverse ap- T-»nratus. We have just is^n^d the third in the new series of Annual Reports of the Xational Kesearch Couneil. ^Vfuch effort has pono into these Reports; I commend them to your attention and would wel- come your comments. The latest issue contains a series of interesting ef^says by representatives of each of the Ocmmiissions and Assemblies of tlie NRC. My own statement attempts a summary of the extent to Avliirh the major recommendations offered in X^KO reports during 197n and early 1077 have found implementation. T admit to having been surprised and gratified by the high ^batting average*' thus revealed. One study report issued last year generated significant political discomfoit*--that conoernini; the clinical operation of hospitals in t he Veterans Administration. Since the bulk of its specific recommenda^ tions are now in the process of implementatioii, the overall value of the report is unchallenged. Its controversial recommendation was that the \"Veterans' Administration hospitals be gradually phased into the gen- eral systern of community hospitals around the countrv, except for tho.se required to provide care to veterans with disabilities developed in the course of their military service. Although this suggestion has not found acceptance, it is now generally adcnowlednfed tnSt the prob- Hem for n^hich it was offered as a solution is indeed real and will re- quire pomo cobition that will ho financiallv and politically acceptable. One of tho pT incipa] criticisms of tho XKO voiced in the past has Ven that the time required to generate a renort is excessive, particu- larly when set against the timeframe of leo^islative and executive l>rai>ch needs and elective terms of office. We have agreed that, when fhe White House or other component of government indicates that a rapid response is imperative, we would attempt to so respond or do- clino the requesf . Two requests from the White House Science Office — to T o\\'iow the operation and scientific accomplishment of the proiects sunported under tho T'^'S-TTSSP .Toint Agreement on Science and Tech- nology and to project the nossible consequences of a sea-le^ ol canal ficross the Panamanian isthmus — were each completed within sixty days. And. at the rNiueflt of a Ooniorressional eommittoe. an examina- tion of the trouMod status of tho main ensrine of the Spaee Shuttle l>y an ad hoc panel <^ the Assembly of Engineering was aooomplished Copyrighted material 9 within less than two months. We were pleased with these outcomes, but these efforts caimot be models for the normal functioning of an insli- ttttion made possible by Tolimteer activity. The NRO continues to be as supportive as possible of the national ■fundamental research endeavor. Most requests from government are of a rather different character however. This year we have found it desirable to constitute new major Boards concerned, respectively, with Computer Science and Technology, Climate, Toxicology, and Keha- bilitation of the Physically Handicapped. At this time, the most politically sensitive issue on our plate may T^e the consequence to humans of exposure to relatively low levels of ionizing radiation. We seem about to undertake studies of what hap- pened to the 350,000 military personnel and 40,000 civilians who were observers at one or more scries of detonations of nuclear weapons. We have also been asked to examine the overall qualitv and appro- priateness of the program of studies concerning the biological effects •of low levels of ionizing radiation that has been supported b^ the De- partment of Energy and previously by EBDA and the AEC. These •studies will require an extraordinanly large effort which will be much in the public eye. A word is m order concerning the status of our Committee on Nuclear and Alternative Enerjory Sources (CONAES). The reports of the major Panels and Kesource Groups of the study are now being pre- pared for publication as rapidly as possible, not as NBC reports m tiw ordinary sense but as detailed working papers that were submitted to ■CONAES by especially constituted ^oups, A draft report of the fommittoo itsolf hn=; under<rone a most intenpive review by the Report Review Committee and is beinjr revised, hopefully for the last time, hy CONAES. Since the national ener*^ problem is hardlv likely to disappear in the next few months, the regrettable delay in issuance of this r^ort is a matter of only small moment. But the principal cause for the delay is noteworthy. To assure that our report in thus eritieal area would have adequately taken into account the major points of A-iow that could be identified in advance, we brought into being a halanced committee containin^r individuals whose views conoeminr!: the desirability of economic frrowtli and that of nuclear energy' span the full spectrum. All have been educated by tlie committee process. But the polarizations built into CONAES remain as a profound ideoloori- cal conflict, reflecting the conflicts in the nation at large. To obtain from the Committee a report that can be useful to tiie American people nnd their government in framing national energy policy and to which the entire committ4?e is largely agreed has proved to be a fonnidahle taslv indeed. Afv reading of where they come out is that the nation will be fortunate if, between now and the year 2010, we shall at all times be able to generate, by all means, the amount of eTiercry that will be demanded, even if, througliout this period, we also make a determined effort to minimize demand by \"conservEtion\" practices. Much of the effort of the National Research Council is concerned with the problems of risk and hazard in the human environment and the face of unrortaintv. A series of re- ports fi-om the Commission on Natural Resources, sponsored bv EPA, was addressed to such problems. EPA has responded by asking CNR Copyrighted material to provide a model of its recommended process, by considering a spe^ cific newly controversial pesticide. Earlier, a panel of the Aiembly of Life Sciences reported to EPA ixuDOsadng the status of heptachlor and chkflcdane as carcinogenB. That report was commended by the adimiuatvative law judge at EPA as a model effort — ^but it left him to wonder concerning the validity of extrapolation from large dose.^ to very low doses, from a few susceptible rodent si>e<\"ies to man, and whether the d<>!^e resjwnse curve is linear to the origin or there in a threshold. And those are scientific, not legal questions. A ^anel in the Aj^nibly of Life Sciettoes, at the request of the Congress, is curreiitly wrestling with the data oonoeming the possible eatcinogenicity of saccharin ^Yhile a paraJlel panel in tlie lOM has been assigned to the task of formulating a general Btatement concerning a ])liilosophy appropriate to food additives and food contaminants generally. One day, their report may provide the guidance requiied by future admin- istrative law judges. In a nimiber of studies in tlie last several years, coet/benefit analyses that attempted to assess the dollar ma^tude of the consequences of one or anotJier form of environmental pollution ha\\-e had recourse to multiple regression analyses, not infrequently involving some yard- stick such as changing property values as a suiTOgate for lo'^s mensur- able estimates of damage or heMcfit. AVhile such rcgres^^ion analyses are accepted by many economists, this approach has l>een challengexl l)V others among us. An interesting seminar on this subject was convened by the Assembly of Behavioral and Social Sciences at the request of the Vice President, This has heij^htened our intention to clarify the status of this intellectual tool for these purposes. Much of the eflfoit of the NKO is concerned, therefore, with the regu- latory activity of goveniment. The continuing growth of regulation as an expiession of our national intention to minimize risk, where we can do so, has given me pause. Each regulation is framed with gi*eat go<xl intention. Quite conceivably each such regulation might successfully withstand challenge and seem justified by available evidence. What is troublesome is the sum of these regulations. They begin to increase the costs to Ameiicam consumers of a great many products while b«ooming a damper on innovation by encourajring defensive rnfhor tlian innova- tive K. & D. and by generating a climate of uncertainty in industry. The academic w^orld has been relatively little affected to date, l^ut that tiiue may not be long off. Many of you will be aware of the regulations con- oeminsr tiie handling of benzene; I am informed that the Department of HEW is now considering a set of legulations prescribinsr laboratory behavior with respect to a list of putative carcinogens. If those regula- tions are mm^o orenerally applicable, a large fraction of all laboratories would V)e significantly affected. AVork in the laboratory would l>ecome me<ihaiiically awkward and the costs of such work would surelv in- crease to some extent. Hence sudi regulation should proceed with the greatest care. And an overreguiated society wiiich does not shai*e belief in the wiaion of its regulations will, in due course, fall out of compli- ance — which is morally destructive. Me4inwhile, I am pleased to note that in smne respects, our national regulatory fen'or is being moderated by experience. Witness the fact tlrnt whereas in its original foiiu the Clean Air Act gave no heed to the Copyrighted material 11 financial costs of achteYmg the-stendards iov automotivQ misBicms or ambient air quality that wei-e.presmbedy the 1977 amendments to this Act nieak oi reconciling the marginal costs of compliance with the marginal benefits to be achieved. A nation which tolerates tlie carnage on the hisrhways, and tiie consequences of tobacco and alcohol can scarcely do otherwise. ■ ^ . One further new enterprise is -worthy of yottr attention. Tba Act which cPuMted ti&e Office of Sdanee «nd Technology Policy within tba Executive Office of the President mandated the preparation by that Office of an Annual Report on the statuse of science and technolojry, 5een from the federal vantage point, as well as an annual rolling Five- Year Outlook antiri|)ating prospective problems and opportunities with respect to science luid teciinolo|ry. The modest sized staff of OSTP, with its multitude of responsibilities, is insufficient also to manage preparatkm of theGeTBi>ort8. Accordingly, with the otmaent of the Congress, President Carter transferred these responsibilities to the National Science Foundation whose staff will be responsible for gen- erating the Annual Repoi-t. Dr>. Prc^^ and Atldnpon have requested that the Academy accept responsibility for the Five- Year Outlook whioh is to be prepared on a biennial basis. The Governing Hoard of the National Research Council and the Council of the Academy con- sider this an appropriate activity of the institution- and, indeed, & •desirable opportonitj to which we should be pleased to respond. Plan- ning of the nrst such exercise is now underway; The National Bcfleaich Council continues to be a principal instru- ment for various international scientific endeavors. We are beginning tlie effort, through our Climate Board, to help develop a World Climate Study Program. A paiiel. chaired by Guy Stever. has com- pleted, on time and in great style, the task of helping the Department of State prepare for the UN Conference on Science and Technology for Development. You heard earlier from Dr. Kates concerning tlio activities of our rommittec on Human Rights and j^ou will understand that our re- lationship with the official scientific community of the Soviet Union is somewhat strained. We are responsible for the science policy and the physics research components of the program of the US-USSR Joint Commission on Science and Technology as well as for the longstanding inter-Academy Exchange Program. Many among us, both for purely scientific reasons and in the hope of a more stable detente, would like to see these programs expanded as would the Soviet Academy. The bilateral seminars in several fields have been highly successful and this program could certainly be expanded with great mutiial l)enefit. But others, sorely troubled by the personal circum- stances of some of our Soviet colleagues, would prefer that these pro- grams be cancelled. I continue to consider that the latter course would £e a serious error and that we shotdd keep open our current communi- cation lines and maintain the current level of activity, cooperating in those areas that seem most rewarding. But, in the current parlnnce of diplomacy, in our minds there is a loose linkage. Until Soviet au- thorities offer the minor civility of a reply to the queries addressed to them by our Committee on Human Rights, until we know the fate of Yuri Orlov and Anatoly Shcharansky, until there is evidence of con- Copyrighted material % - 12 8tructiye attention to the rights of such scientists as Kovalev, Ginsburg and Levich, I consider that we would be ill-advised to respond affirma- tiyely to proposals for an increase beyond the current level of ex* change activity. Finally, I slioiild like to note that 1979 will mark two diflferent cen- tenaries. The United States Geological Survey will celebrate its 100th birthday. The program of our Annual Meeting next year will take cognizance of that fact and our program will be, in significant part^ a celebration of a century of glorious service to our country. Next spring will also mark the 100th anniversarjr of the birth of Albert Einstein. Appropriate scientific sjnnposia in honor of hia memory are being planned at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton and elsewhere. It is our hope that we may take note of tliat event in a rather different way, by unveiling a monument to Einstein to be placed on the southwest comer of our grounds as shown on tliese slides. The monument was conceived by Robert Berks (the sculptor tespimsible for the head of Jack Kennedy in the hall of the Kennedy Center). It is 28 feet in diameter and 12 feet high; the figui*e is hk, bronze, the bench is in the marble of our building. At his feet, the heavens are reflected in black granite with stainless ftecl stars and planets as they appeared at midnight, at 40° N. latitude on the evenings of his birth. The Commission of Fine Arts of the District of Columbia has already given enthusiastic approval of our plan for the placement of this Memorial We hope that this monument will be seen by all who travel on Constitution Avenue as symbolic of the profound beauty of the intellectual constructs of science, as a symbol of what the progress- of science has meant to our civilization, ancl that it will rekindle in the- hearts of our fellow citizens faith that science is the most powef ul toojt by which mankind can build a better future.

The evidence is more circamstantial than direct. As sdentists jfrom the Center for Disease Control of theU.S* Public Health Seirvice put it, \"No associatioa ms found between illness and contact trith birds, mainmals, or souvenirs. Patients did not complain of insect bites. A hypothesis of airborne spread is difficult to test directly, but it is con- sistent with the observed association of illness with time spent in the lobby and on the sidewalk in front of the hotel. Several patients with Legionnaires^ disease and most with Broad Street pneumonia [i.e., had the disease, but iieitiier attended the convention nor had recently en- tered the hotel] had only transient exposure in these areas and no identifiable exposure there other than to air.\" * How far does pollen travel i The question is of some importance — to interpreting the geographic diversity of plant life, and to aidin<i the mapping of historical vegetation patterns through an analysis of fossil j)ollen.^ Such knowledge is considered basic, but some of its uses are not ; for ezunple, pollen analysis may be used by oil companies to determine the histories of stratigraphic layers, helping the seardi for new petroleum deposits. \"WHiat are the effects of pollutant gases and particles on biological materials in the air, from pollen to microorganisms? Is there, for ex- am[)le, a synergistic relationship between some pollutants and the infectivity of microbes, the first perhaps a carrier for the second? These questions all deal with l»iological materials in the air — ^how the^ travel, how far, and the relationship of their aerodynamic prop- erties to their various effects, whether on legionnaires or on plants. Thus, the questions are properly within the province of aerobiology, the scientific discipline concerned with such matters. The formal name was coined in the 1980's, but the concerns of aerobiology are more ancient, focused originally on airborne pathogens and attracting the interests of Louis Pasteur and Joseph Lister, among others. Aerobiology grew up with this emphasis on diseases, reinfcmsed by the interest, dunng and after World War H, of several nations, includ- ing the United States, in developing germ warfare techniques (and therefore needing to know sometning of how microbes behave in air, particularly indoors). However, aerobioloer^', with its contemporary concern for materials in air, is today considered an umbrella science for a variety of more specialized disciplines. These include, for in- »Fra8er.

However, the historical antecedents of aerobiology— or, more ex- actly, its earlier, somewhat provincial emphasis oa disease asped»— monn tliat problems, techmnues, and data common to seeminpfly distinct sciences, such ns palynology and entomology, have often escaped attention and have therefore neither been well investigated nor efficiently used. Sampling techniques, analysis of aerodynamic properties oi different particfes (such as tlieir rate cit setlilmg) , or attempts to relate aerial movements to biolofncal effects (such' as the relation of release times and dispersal of pollen to allergy patterns) Tiavebeen developed or done for individual sciences, rather than shapea in a way to be broadly useful for many sciences. Research has tended to be compartmentalized. Broad principles generally applicable did not emerge. Karely was a truly comprohensivc approach used to design a research program, for example, in incorporating the aerobiological view in an analysis of the biological, physical, and chemical dynamics of an ecosystem. The unification effort really began with the International Biological Program flBP), especially with the U.S. effort to develop nn IBP Aerobiology Proirram. As remarked in an IBP volume, \"Before the inception of tlie US/TBP Aerobiology Program, aerobiology tended io be fragmented and had little cohesiveness as a discipline. The US/ IBP Aerobiology Program provided a cohesive framework by con- sidering aerobiology in a syst^ns analysis framework where eadi par- ticle is considered with respect to its source, release into the atmosphere, dispersion, deposition, and impact.\" • In part to continue the IBP momentum, a Committee on Aero- \"biology has been established %Yithin the Assembly of Life Sciences, with support from the U.S. Uopartment of Agriculture, the National Aero- nautics and Space Administration, and the National Science Founda- tion. The purposes of the committee indnde an effort to encourage the maturation of aerobiology as a discrete and coherent science, to con- sider whether it would assist in launching an American professional sorioty for aerobiology, to define the boundarios of flip f]i?ripline, to iv>to (lio key issues that should be addressed from an aerobiological perppocti\\-p, and to determine whether these issues are being addressed bv federal a£:encies.

The research difficulties are consid- erable. For instance, as remarked in NaZure^ \"the study of pollen move- ment has been rendered difficult by the problem of relating pollen grains, once dispersed, to their sources.\" ° Moreover, the distance trav- •elled by poUmi gi'ains depends on their dfinsttsBB and aarodjmia^te; ^hich vary among specMS. Sarrounding plants may filter pollen move- ments, shapiiix the pattern of plant growth; for e(za]nple,.the hasel flower? more ammdantly on the forest periphery aad In obanngB thaa it does in the interior of the forest. Aside from research, a better way of gathering and collating data is needed. While worldwide samplings of allergenic pollens arejpnb- lished yearly in the Statistical Bep^ of the PoUen and Mold Comr mittee of the American Acadaimr of PoUen and Allergy, similar data on nonallergens are not as available. SIiAirr PATHOGENS There aie suffici^t examples of })lant diseases caused by airbome organisms, primarily fungi, to alone justify a more active research pro- gnun in aerobiology. For instance, the com hHght epidemic in the United States in 1970 was caused by airbome spores and resulted in a fifteen percent overall loss in harvest yields. Similarly, rice blast epi- demics are attributed to airbome fimgi, while an outbreak of coffee rust in Brazil may have been due to fungi windblown from Africa across the South Atlantic. If one had a clear idea of the rate and pat- tern of travel of plant pathogens, such as fungi and insects^ more effec- tive prophylaxis might be possible* Certainly, improved air sampling and better use of collected data may make it possible to contain an ini* tial infection and prevent it from becoming an epidemic / , SflCROFAUNA, IXCLUDINO INSECTS Again, there are research difficulties; for example, it is at best haz- ardous to generalize on the pattems and rates of travel of insect spe- cies, since these mav depend on the time of release, the -wind conditions fit the time, and other factors. Moreover, some insect species, such as tiphids, ar carried long distances, while others, such as leafhoppers, mosquitoes, houseflies, and moths, are restricted by natural barriei-s, ^eatlier conditions, and similar factors.

Copyrighted material 18 teric aspect ot medicine.^ Obviously, some of the interest in learning' how pollen «Bd fungi are diatributod through the air is a^Ucabii to medicine. Furthennore^one would like to know more of the relation- ship of the size and shape of pollen, aad the topography of the liingSt to their rate of settling and deposition in different parts of the respira- tory tract. There is considerable uncertainty about the movements of microorganisms in the air and their potential for producing infections by that route. While airborne infections are hardly a major category or eontemporagy diiiwn<\\, theie am dooiMawited insfeaneee when diaeaaes caused by bacteria (anthrax), rickettsia (layer), and Tirasea (hoof- and-month disease^ have spread because of meteorological conditions or aerosolization. Also, given its intimate concern with the spread of infectious diseases, aerobiolo^ can contribute to developing an«l im- proving technology for the high-level containment of experiments in- volving very infectious agents and recombinant DNA. EFFECn OF TGUJOTdam Air pollutants fall partly into the ambit of aerobiolo^ry in that pollutants may influence the development of plant disease by modify- ing the progress of a disease, the host, or the vinilence of a particular pathogen, \"nius, pollutant oases, especially ozone and sulfur dioxide,, can imiibit the germination of some pollens and fungal spores; and they may aflfect the viability of airborne fungi and bacteria. Pol- lutants may also kill bacteria: perhaps carbon monoxide interrupts cvtochrome enzymes, sulfur and nitrogen oxides cause letlial pH. changes, and so on, meh^bologt ^ Atmospheric transport can be microscale (travel times and space- limited to less than an hour and a few hundred meters), mesr>^<^ale Ctime and space on a scale of days and a few hundred kilometers), and macroscale (a year or more and global transport). Each scnle presents different conditions and is therefore a different arena for study ; for instance, sinks for atmospheric materials, important on a meoo- or macroscale, are nonexistent at a microscale level. The aero- biologist, beyond applying known meteorological methods to his science, must consider other factors, including the conditions under which pollen, fimgi, and other biological materials are released, their aerial characteristics, and so on. Biological particles can also be nuclei for cloud condensation and ice formation and can serve as surfaces for chemical and physical interactions. These latter effects, while- real and important, are poorly understood. In addition, the indoor^ or intramural, movements of bacteria and allergens reflect certain: -meteorological characteristics of diffusion and turbulence, which must be considered. These are some of the issues that now concern aerobiology. In all, thev add up to a fnirly large bank of unknown data and missing methods. Very broadly, we are largely ignorant of the biological con- tent of the atmosphere and its interactions with life on the ground* We need to imflrove our ability to relate changes in disease patterns •Laiifmalr, Alexander D.

We tend to believe tliat airborne diseases are largely, if not exdusiTely, transmitted indoors, becanse we have no infoima- tion on outdoor tranamission. Not that airborne infections indoors are not a very real problem; there is ample evidence, as indicated earlier, that staph infections are transmitted in various ways indoors, including through hospital laundry chutes, while home heating and xiir conditioning ducts can be serious sources of allergenic dusts and molds. ^As an aside, the evidence is not persuasive that modern forced-air ventilating systems are more, or even as, sanitary as earlier practices that depended on very large room sizes and open windows to dilute and change indoor air. ) As to a lack of methods, there is no one instmmont yet developed that can adeouately sample all the sizes and types of materials in tlie atmosphere. Partly as a result, monitoring programs are inadequate. Some of these sampling and monitoring problems are of a piece with inadec|uate research. As one illustration of the problem, it was recently pomted out that, ''Apart fnm the serions problem of where to sample in relation to where people Hve, how frequently to sample, with what response times and averaging times, etc., we're not sure what to sample, and by what method. It is clear that the biolo^st would like to sample fine sulfuric acid mist, but no such method exists for community atmospheres. It would be desirable to measure acid sulfates, but acid sulfates are formed in part on the filter after sam- ples are collected. We would like to identify specific sulfates, since the range of sulfate toxicity is wide, but present collectors yidd too little material for analysis.\" ^ The Committee on Aerobiology will take up some of these matters, as well as others, and plans to issue its final report in 1979.

Copyrighted material Copyrighted material ASSEMBLY OF MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES Sun, Weather, and Cjumate Chan^ is usually more intriguing than stasis, and in the matter of the possible effects of the sun on climate, the interesting question is not the effect of the sun on climate, but the relation of solar chcmges to climate changes. That the sun has an effect on the earth's climate is a trivial assertion, given the role of solar heat and its daily and sea- eonal Tuiitioiis in shaping and diiviiig wind flow, clouds and ndi^ ooean carreniB, and other aaeoited facton tiiat, put together* detennine T^eather and the pattern of clinuite. But wh^er solar cnan^ are followed by climatic changes is a much slipperier issue to which the immediate, scientifically conservative answer would seem to be no. There are two reasons for being negative. The first is that by direct measurement — whether on the groimd or from space, for a day or for several years — ^the amount of sunlight, or radiant energy, streaming to the earth seems to stojr Tirtnally unchanged. If there are any changes in the total solar radiation, thej are less Aan one percent of the total amount measnred, although larger changes could ooeur over Icmger periods. Given apparently invariant sunlight, the suspicion falls on more subtle changes in the sun's output, such as the influence of sunspots* Buti here the Objection is that there is no obvious way by which simspot pattema can affect the earth's dimate. However, the lack of an explana- tion has not discouraged an intense interest in sonspolr-dimate rela- tions. Simapota are dark s^ota on the photosphere, or visible surfsce, of the sun. They are sometimes seen singly, and more often in groups or clusters ; thev are the marks of intense magnetic fields that come up to the surface irom within the sun. Various solar events are linked to these strong magnetic fields, the most spectacular of which arc solar flares and eruptive prominences — ^geysers of hot solar gas rising at times thousands of mHes above tiie photosphere and penetoating through the solar corona, the normally invisible, halo of the sun. What makes sunspots so intriguing is their manner of occurrence^ Best known is a well-established cycle of elovon years between maxima or minima in their numbers ; there is also a twenty-two-year cycle, if one includes the fact that ma^etic polarities of the sunspot clusters reverse evenr successive eleven years. These cyolBS do occur.

But there (2X) • ■•• Copyrighted material 22 are no detailed explanations of liow the solar ma^etic cycle and climate might be causally related. One may speculate that sunspot activity changes the chemical composition of the upper stratosphere, which could affect the heating of the lower troposphere^ where cumate is nm^^. Or that char£:ed. particles carried a\\vay from the son by the solar wind interact wiw tiie earlflilB ma^etic field to in some way affect the climate. But those remain sriiesscs. Moreover, any effort to establish a causal chain is confronted by a swarm of other possible influonees on tlie climate. These include inter.ictions between oceans and ice caps and between oceans and the atmosphere, as well as changes in the par- ticulate, ozone, and catbon dioxide content of the atmosimere.'Chan<2:os iii the earths orbit as it travels through 8pa)ce also may bring aboiit climate chants. • ' There is, finally, tho po?sil)iHty that in lookinjr at simspots one is roally lookin^f only at Xewton's pebble on the beach, fnilin*; to see the ocean of truth beyond : for sunspots are only the most visible indicators of solar activity, and hence may indicate more portentous changes oc-* cnrring beneath the surface of the sun. It may be these latent events, ^i^aled by changes in snhspots, thatliave a modulating effect .on th^ earth's climate. These subtle and possibly dow scdar dumges, While perhapis trifling on a solar scale, may be momentous on an earthly one, and may constitute the trirr;G:er mechanism or the force itself thata^ off climatic chancre. But, again, that is argument, not proof. A student of the subject, John A. Eddy of the National Center for AtniQspheric Research, has written that, • • • . ; . The trouble is that weather and climate changes can hai)pen in spite of the snn. Observable solar changes might have troposiAeric effects, but not neeesfterily^ The earth coTiIrl enjoy dmmatic weather and varied Himate, with droughts and he&t 'waves and ice ages» even if the sun were ioeiced to a perfect thermostat and didnt change Its output at alt in photons, particles, or whatever. There are lots of inputs to tho woather machine, and many of them are intrinsically more vari- alile, more immediate in their effects, and more poorly known than the rather stahle sun.

Between 1645 and 1715, the number of sunspots reported was unusually low, probably lower than the normal minima in the eleven-year cycle : and for some ten-year inter- vals no sunspots at all were reported.

The acute interest in observing the skies accounted for extensive records of what the sun, amon^ other bodies, was doing. The curious absence of sunspots — ^remarkc^ upon by the contemporary oh^^erv^ei-s, but not thought unusual — was pointed out in tho late nineteenth oentnry by a German astronomer, Gustav Sporer, and soon taken up in much greater detail by E. W. Maunder, superintendent of the solar department at the Greenwich Observatory. Iklaunder's reports, between 1894 and 1922, neither gathered much sup- port nor a great deal of attenti<m; modem reappraisal, however, has verified the apparent reality of his claims.' Moreover, the Maunder Minimum did suggest that the sun was capable of odd behavior, which surpassed, in its duration and in the virtual absence of sunspots, lx)th the eleven- and twenty-two-year cycles. It therefore opened tlie po?,sil)ility that there were other solar variations to consider in looking for a climate connection. That the Maunder Minimum does indeed carry a story has been limply verified by tracing the history of the sun back several thousand years, uang the related tools of radioactive carbon dating and tree- ring chronology. Badioactive carbon, **C, is formed in the upper xitmosphere by cosmic rays. Incorporated into carbon dioxide, the radioactive carbon enters by photosynthesis into plants, including trees. The sun's extended magnetic field is one of the modulators of cosmic ray activity, and hence radiocarbon production. Therefore, in principle, one can trace the history of the sun back several thousand years by measuring the amount of radiocarbon, relative to nonradio- active ^*C, in the wood of datable tree rings. Tree rinjS^ that were formed when solar activity was high, i.e., when there wn e many sun- spots, should contain reduced amounts of ^*C; those formed during periods of extended low solar activity, like the Maunder Minim^ mj should show increased radiocarbon. \"UHien the tree-ring record of the sun's activity is plotted in this fashion, one finds evidence of a series extended of minima and maxima of solar activity like the Maunder Minimum—not a simple alternating series, but rather cyclic variations of clustered maxima and minima. If these are plotted , a 2,500-year cycle emerges; the Maunder Minimum is a point on the plot ; the 11- ant] 92-year cycles are filtered out in the radiocarbon record and the 80-year cycle is scaled into insignificance.' Moreover, there are intriguing correlations of this long-term record of solar activity with climate history (the latter, oddly, more poorly known) . As John Eddy has pointed out, [t]he correspondence, feature for feature, is almost the fit of a key in a lock. Wherever a dip in solar activity occurs . . . the cUmatB flwlngs ooldward, and mid-latitnde glaciers advanro.

To assist Egypt, the U.S. A^^ency for International Development (AID) has embarked on a three-year program totaling about $9 million. A part of that program includes an effort by the XRC, acting tlirongh its Board on Science and Technology for International Development of the Commission on International Relations, to assist the Egyptian Academy of Scien- tific Research and Technology in its efforts to strengthen and reorient E^ptian R. & D. The immediate difficulty is that there is simply no tradition in Eg} pt of major involvement by its scientific and technological cadre in ap- plied research. Nominally applied research institutions are used in good part for university-oriented thesis research, there is a mismatch between the structure and organization of Egypt's scientific institutions and government's declared needs. In all, as one evaluation phrased it, while \"Egj'pt as a society is committed to development, and Egypt has created over the past 25 years an impressive scientific and technological community,\" it remains a fact **that this community has been upon the periphery of the prevailing development process.\" * That situation nmst be viewed against E^pt's current condition : a country with a foreign debt greater than its annunl Gross National Product, a dense and growing population, extremely limited natural resources, and an inflation rate officially given as about thirtj^-threc percent anntially but probably closer to fifty percent. The Egyptian population is now about 37 million people, but an average g^o^vth rati^ of 2.2 to 2.5 percent annuall}^ it is growing by 800,000 to 1 million people each year and will reach 70 to 80 million by the vear 2000. The population is extremely concentrated, with no major cities in 80uthem< ov upper Egypt and the narrow strip of land along the Nile and the Delta now the most densely populated region in the world.

Urbaniza- tion is rampant, tlic normal situation witli developing countries, and an actual majority of the populations of Cairo and Alexandria are now first-ironorfition fellaliin who have immigrated from the countr\\'side. TliL'se oloincnts afiinu the judgment that \"[r]ural congestion, urban crowdnig, unemployniont and underemployment, deteriorating infra- structure and insufficent social services of increasingly poorer quality are only a few of the problems of Egypt.\" * Such conditions emphasize the urgent need for indigenous science and technology, relying largely on local adaptoHon of foreign tech- noloiiy, to participate in staunching Egypt's economic decline and in markedly impro\\Tng conditions. The tools for the task are at hand. As already iiny^liod, Eg>'pt has in being a considerable scientific appa- ratus whose ostensible if poorly realized role is to apply research to nationni needs. Tliat point is indeed a constant refrain to three recent studies of Egypt's problems in applying science and technology for national ptirpose^. The first study was in the form of a workshop held in 1975. joint ly by the Egyptian Academy of Scientific Beaearch and Technology, tlie tT.S. National Science Foundation, and the National Research Council.' The second was by a team from the Besearch Tri- nTi<xle Institute that used a survey approach to analyze the current status and possible development role of Egyptian science and tech- nology'.* The third, somewhat more parochial, study was an analysis by a team from the National Science Foundation on Egypt's needs in scientific instrument ation.* All three efforts looked generally at the Egyptians' scientific ap- paratus, including the univernties, of which uiere are eight major ones; but with over ninety percent of the student population concen- trated in three universities and forty-four percent in Cairo University alone. However, the emphasis in the analyses was on the national iiisti- tutions for coordinating, funding, and supervising research efforts^ These institutions are the already-mentioned Academy for Scientific Eesearch and Technology (ASRT), the National Research Centre (NKC), and, in the case of the NSF instrumentation study, the Scien- tific Instruments Centre. A word about these instituticms. There is no counterpart to ASRT in the United States, since it combines the role of the National Science Foimdation in funding basic research, the role of mission-oriented agencies such as the Department of Enerfn^ in the planning and sup- port of supposed!}^ \"relevant\" re.search, the policvmaking role of tlie President's OfTice of Science and Technology Policy, and the advice- giving role of the National Research Council.

The National Research Centre's role is described by its title. It is housed in several buildings scattered about Cairo, eiriploys about 1,4^0 professionals, and, while adniinistmtively it is responsible to the president of the academy, in reality it receives funding and direction from several ministries. The NRC is akin to one of tlie national labora- tories in the United States, but has research programs in widely diver- tent fields, including technology transfer, food and agriculture, ealth and environment, energy, and natural resources. The assessments made of the ASRT and the NRC, by the work- shop and by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) stucly team, be- speak a common problem: Research that is supposedly applied is more often basic, and, however the research is categorized, is almost universally at a considerable remove from governmental priorities and goals. Thus, \"Strategically important national needs of Egypt are not yet being met in any significant way by Academy-funded re- search.\" « Further, \"significant improvement is needed in the national relevanco of NRC research.-' Of course, these problems are hardly unique to Egypt, nor news to its leaders. The issue is remedies, which is much more difficult. As a practical matter, for example, it is very costly to transform basic into applied research and follow-up development. Thus, the cost ratio in the United States is 1 :5 or in percentage ratios of four, twenty, and seventy-six percent. The financial demands therefore increase fivefold once a decision is made to proceed bovoTul laboratory research. A less palpable, but possibly even more dilHcult, |)i o]ilom is that of scientific culture and tradition: the cues by which a scientist assesses his standing and attains promotions, tenure, higher pay, and prestige. Finally, the emi phasis on applied les^ardi is diflTcult f of many i^seafbh scientists to fathom, because they have trained within a milieu of basic science, been inculcated with a strong belief in the wortli of basic re- search per se, and, moi-e practically, oeca use their livelihoods are de- pendent upon papers published rather than projects completed. It should again be remembered that the problem is hardly unique to Egypt. As two analysts of the role of scientists in development put it, the problem is that £t] here. is no tradition of purposeful research, mainly because there are no ez- tenial users around to convey tli^r needs and wants to the sdoitists, and there is no established culture of such links between the aonrtemic and the practical. Thus the doctrine of academic freedom, according to which every professor dioald be quite at liberty to work at any sdentifie topic that pleases bis fancy* la cacclcd to an eztmnev' Aside from transforming the cultural cues that motivate scientists, the reorienting of Egyptian science and technoloo^y must also seek to avoid the easy solutions, such as the ^vholoi^nlp nfh)ption of foreifrn technologioR, which may on a hrst-ordor basis a])])c;ir to be suitable but turn out to be intolerant or maladaptive to local conditions.

Davenport Implicit in the last statement is that applied researcli, purposefol and committed to certain goals, must be nurtured by fiist-class basic resean^ Th»t principle is clearly leoognized by the Egyptians, and the universities are intended to remain as centers of fundamental re- search, with the national institutions, such as the National Research Centre, increasingly turning their research toward the needs of the state. Of course, ffood applied research does oocnr in E^^pt, but overall it tends to be the exception. For example, the Egv'ptian Petroleum Re- search Institute, originally a part of the university-oriented National Research Centre, has been indepcnrlont since 1071. Its research and de- velopment pronrram, rather than being acadomically oriented, is now entirely applied, interacts strongly with industry, is adapting foreign teclinologies to Egyptian i)roblems, and, as the surest signs of its suc- cess, has licensed Egyptian technolo^ to foreimi users. Other specific successes in applied research include Uie pilot plant production of pulp and paper from sugar plant bagasse and the introduction of highly innovative machinery into the textile industry. ^ Tlie role of the overall program funded by AID in which the Xa- tional Kesearch Council is participating is to assist the Egyptian scien- tific and^ technological research community in reorienting its research toward institutional capability in the management of R. & D., NRC, through its Board on Science and Technology for International Development, will assist in three ways: Policy planning and management functions of the Academy of Scientific Research and Technology, including establishing a high- level U.S.-Egyptian Joint Consultative Committee.

Copyrighted material CO^BIISSION ON NATUEaVL KESOUKCES PoiiTGHLOBINATBD B1PHEKTI8 Qf THE EnTIKONHKNT The Committee for an Assessment of Polychlorinated Biphenyls in the Environment of the Commission on Natural Resources will seek to identify the seneiio probleniB associated with peisistent compounds, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's), that are widely used and dispmed in the environment. The study is funded by the U.S. En- vironmental Protection Agj&cucy^a (POb) Office of Besearch and Development. PCB's were chosen for study because of the complex issues raised by their regulation and tlie range of alternatives for their control, Tliese issues encompass many of the problems presented by^ other chemipals that are both persistent and widespread : the chlorinated pesticides Emme, DDT, aldrin/dieldrin, Heptachlor/Chlordane, and othere. For example, the control options to be considered by the committee include the {prevention of further release of PCB's to the environment, enhanced microbial or photochemical degradation, and removal by dredging, by harvesting of biota that concentrate PCB's, and by in- canerati^ of PCB-contaminated wastes. Many of these control meas- ures may be applicable to other persistent poUutants ; thus, the lesson learned from the options available for the cleanup of PCB's from the Hudson River, especially any analvses of the merits of dred^ng the river's sediments, should be useful for evaluating available options for cleaning up Kcpone that has accumulated in the James River. PCB's were first synthesized late in the nineteenth centurjr, but they were not commercially produced until 1929. Commercial mixtures of FC»'s, or fonnnlations containing sndi mixtures, have been used indus- trially as cooling liqiiids, dielectric fluids, heat transfer ajpents, and for other electrical applications ; they also have been used in paints, ad- hesives, rubber, certain s}Tithetic resins, inks, cutting oilS| and pattern waxes. Many of these uses now have been abandoned. However, the dominant use of PCB's is in transformers and capaci- tors, and it is the uWquity of these devices that accounts for the exten- fflve presence of PCB's in both Hght and heavy industrial equipment and m many bousehol d a ppliances. The properties of PCB^s that most uses exploit are their stability to extremes of heat and light, their nonflammability, and their efficiency in transferring heat. The problem with PCB's is that they can also move throughout the environment and accumulate in fat tissue of humans and animals. were first reoognised as an environmental contaminant in 1966 during studies on the aoenmulation of ddt in food chains. Samples of fat tissue from both humans and wildlife contained not only DDT and its metabolite DDE, but also unidentified yet persistent materiala These turned out to be PCB's. In 1968, after additional evidence (29) Copyrighted material 30 showed that PCB's were widely distributed in birds and fish, a poison- ing incident in Japan raised the specter of a widespread human health hazard. Eice oil used in cooking was contaminated during manufiusture by PCB's from a faulty heat-cxchaTi<]:e unit. The victims sufTorod, in addition to headaches and nausea, from a variety of se\\ ere symptoms ranging from skin lesions to eye problems; the poisonmg was serious enough to be a factor in the death of at least 29 of the 1,300 victims of the '^i usho^ (rice-oil ) disease. In addition to these acute health effects of PCB's, recent evidence indicates that carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and suppression of the body's immune system are also health effects oi PCB's. The levels of FOB contamination in the Yusho incident are greater than the levels to which people are generally exposed ; but the incident did demonstrate that P(jB's pose a risk to human health. PCB's accu- mulate in the food chain, and many iish are particularly prone to con- centrate them. People who consume contammated fish regularW may aocumula f PCB's. PCB's also are directly hazardous to fish, birds, and other wildlife, for these chemicals can inter&r with reproduction. The hazards associated with PCB's are further compoimrlod by the finding' that they enhance the toxicity of certain other enviconmental pollut- ants, such as DBT and dicldrin . The health and ecological ellects of pen's as a commercial mixture have been studied extensively, but the toxicity of individual isomers I s so. Since chlorination of biphenyl to form PCB's can produce 210 different isomers, of which about 100 are found in commercial mix- tures, detorminiTifr tlie toxicity of individual components is extremelv difficult. Further, polychlorinated dilx^nzofiirans, which are contami- nants of some PCB mixtures and also possible degradation products of light, bacteria, or extreme heat, may be responsible for some and per- haps most of the health effects associated with PCB exposure. Much has already been done to control PCT's— by voluntary action on the part of the industrial manu&cturer, Monsanto Industrial Chemicals Corporation, nnd by regulatory actitm in the United States at the federal and state levels.' Tn addition, manv other coimtrios now regiilati) PCB's. In the United States, for example. Monsanto, as early as 1971, restricted sales of PCB's for use in closed electrical systems. In Vyi2 and 1978, the Food and Drug Administration reduced the levels of PCB's allowed in foods and eliminated the use of paper food wrappmgs impregnated with them. The Toxic Substances Control Act, whicli been me law in 1976 and is one of the few examples of direct con/rros>ional re^ndation of an individual substance of a com- mercial mixtin-e. requires the administrator of EPA to promulgate rules for the disposal and labeling of products containing PCB's. The act restricts PCB use to totally enclosed systems and bans the manu- facture of PCB's two years after the act's passage and ^eir process- ing or distribution after two and one-half years. However, exemptions are possible. • To date, regulations required under the Toxic Snbstnncos Control Act on disposal methods and marking of all items containing PCB's have been proposed; and regulations limitinc: the discharge by certain industries of effluents that contain PCB's have been issued in final form by EPA under the authority of the Federal Water Pollution Copyrighted material 31 Control Act* These regulations prolribit direct discharge of PCB's by the mannfactuTeis of the chemicate and greatly limit discharges by maimftustiirers of electxical equipnft^ OONlimUIMO PB0BCEM8 Other regulations by EPA for limiting air emissions of PCB's and specifying their recovery from solid wastes possibly will be. developed by EPA. However, because of the persistence of PCB's in nature, problems will still exist even if all planned regulations are published and enforced. These problems are the focus of the NRC study. Approximatey 1.25 billion pounds of PCB's have been produced and used in the United States. Only a very small proportion, esti- mated to be 55 million pounds (4.4 percent), has been destroyed, either by high temperature indneration or by slow microbial or photo- chernical degradation in the environment. Some 750 million pounds (60 percent) of the PCB's manufactured are contained in various pieces of equipment still in use todaj^. Possibly, this amount of PCB's can be effectively disposed of; but it is more likely that the PCB's contained in a large number of small pieces of ec^uipment used in homes and in industry will eventually reach the environment, adding to the estimated 440 imllioia pounds already tliere. Of that 440 million pounds, an estimated 290 million pounds are in landfills from where they may in time be dispersed throughout the environment. The re- maininij 150 million pounds are in the air, water, soil, and sediments. With the Hudson River closed to fishinfr because of PCB's, and fishing in the Great Lakes and other bodies of water threatened by PCB contamination, the NKC committee will look carefully at the altemativeB tor controlling farther release of PCB's^ for accelemting their degradation, and for removing and destroying them. The three primary objectives of the study are : 1. To develop a model of the transport and fate of PCB's in the emdronment. This will permit a determination of the length of time and levels at wliich PCB's are expected to remain in the environment. Tlie model will also be used to identify stages in the movement of PCB's where regulatory intervention would be appropriate. 2. To recommend means of quantifjnnf:: the porsistence of a substance in the. environment, appropriate tests for pei'sistcnce, and, if possible, tests that mi^^lit nave identified the hazards of PCB's at an early stage and therefore might identify other such substances before they are widely used. d. To determine through cost-benefit analysis the envircHuneii- tal and health advantages and disadvantages of options for con- trolling further release of PCB's, for removinrr thorn from the environment, and for accelerating their degradation j and then to determine the costs and benefits of these options. In the analysis of costs and benefits, an effort will be made to be as Quantitative as practicable within the limitations of time, funds, and tne uncertainties of the underlying data and assumptions. For cases in which costs and benefits are not quantifiable in a meaningful way, qualitative descriptions will be used. Copyrighted material 32 Tlaa study should indicate whether farther regulatory sctions are neceasaiy to alleviate the most liazardous exposures of PCB's and to suggest avenues of re8eai:ch likely to provide insight into the moat vexing problems. These results, including an analysis of control meth- ods now employed, should provide a framework for dealing with other persistent pollutants. Nathan Karch.

This amendment added section 16 to the act, which reads, in part : Sectioii 16.

The TransporUtion Kesearch Board, recognizing the need for fur- ther azammatibn of the issues involved in uiis area, estahlished the Committee on the Transportation Disadvantaged to study problems relating to the elderly, handicapped, and economically disnd v!inta<red, inchiding the services that various types of transportation should pro- vide and the impact and vahie of transportation programs. Historically, transportation planners have designed systems to ac- commodate work trips and the needs of those who have cars, can afford taxis, or are relatively mobile.
