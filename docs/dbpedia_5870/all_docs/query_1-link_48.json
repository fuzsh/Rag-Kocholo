        "text": "A unique education\n\nENS Paris-Saclay has a distinctive educational approach, which is embodied by the institution's new diploma programme.\n\nThe School puts singular emphasis on research-led teaching, interdisciplinarity and an international outlook. All normalien students are active in building their own study path and receive individual supervision from top-level academics.\n\nThe six strong points of a normalien education are:\n\nresearch-led teaching, a springboard to PhD study,\n\ntraining to teach in higher education,\n\nan education enriched by the School's multidisciplinary nature (it is the only ENS that brings together science, engineering, the social sciences and design);\n\na personalized programme with individual supervision\n\nan education that leads to a wide range of career opportunities in education, research, the senior civil service and the private sector,\n\nan internationally-focused education that promotes mobility.\n\nProgramme\n\nAs soon as students arrive at ENS Paris-Saclay, they are able to build their own personalized study path (from the final undergraduate year to doctoral level) to suit their career plan.\n\nThe programme includes laboratory internships in France or abroad. It may also include a period of study abroad or be part of a dual degree programme with a French grande Ã©cole."
