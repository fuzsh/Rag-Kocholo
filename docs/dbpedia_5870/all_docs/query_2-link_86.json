Look at the Nobel prizes to alumni ratio...\n\n=> https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2016.20757\n\n\"Two schools dominate the rankings: École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. These small, elite institutions each admit fewer than 250 undergraduate students per year, yet their per capita production of Nobelists outstrips some larger world-class universities by factors of hundreds.\"\n\nAgreed. Ecole Normale Superieure is a very small elite institution with the best students in the world. This is largely thanks to the \"classe preparatoire\" system which is uniquely French. Until recently (it might have changed?) ENS did not have university status so that students got actual degrees from other institutions including Sorbonne, EHESS, etc., and professors had other affiliations as well."
