ENS Paris-Saclay is one of the most prestigious and selective French grandes écoles. Like all other grandes écoles, this elite higher education institution is not included in the mainstream framework of the French public universities. Along with the École normale supérieure (Paris), ENS Lyon and ENS Rennes, the school belongs to the informal network of French écoles normales supérieures, forming the top level of research and education in the French higher educational system. In 2014, ENS Paris-Saclay became a founding member of the University of Paris-Saclay consortium, an initiative to integrate and combine resources from a number of different grandes écoles, public universities, and research institutions. The school currently plans to move in 2019 to a new campus located in the commune of Gif-sur-Yvette on the Saclay plateau, France's \"Silicon Valley,\" where it will be near other members of the Paris-Saclay research-intensive and business cluster.",
