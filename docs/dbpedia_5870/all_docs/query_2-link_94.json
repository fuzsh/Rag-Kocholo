        "text": "École normale supérieure\n\nAn école normale supérieure (French pronunciation: ​[ekɔl nɔʁmal sypeʁjœʁ]) or ENS is a type of publicly funded higher education institution in France. A portion of the student body, admitted via a highly-selective competitive examination process, are French civil servants and are known as normaliens. ENSes also offers master's degrees, and can be compared to \"Institutes for Advanced Studies\". They constitute the top level of research-training education in the French university system. The history of écoles normales supérieures goes back to 30 October 1794 (9 brumaire an III), when École normale de l'an III was established during the French Revolution. The school was subsequently reestablished as pensionnat normal from 1808 to 1822, before being recreated in 1826 and taking the name of École normale in 1830. When institutes for primary teachers training called écoles normales were created in 1845, the word supérieure (meaning upper) was added to form the current name. The Savary Law of 1984 restructured higher education in France and classified écoles normales supérieures within the category of établissements publics à caractère scientifique, culturel et professionnel.As of January 2014, there are four existing ENSes: École normale supérieure, located in Paris École normale supérieure de Lyon, located in Lyon École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay, located in Cachan, near Paris École normale supérieure de Rennes, located in RennesA twin institution has existed in Italy since its foundation by Napoleon Bonaparte, the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa."
