Gérard Debreu was a French economist and mathematician who won the 1983 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. He is best known for his work developing general equilibrium theory and mathematical economics. Some of his most important contributions include proving the existence of economic equilibrium using topological methods, introducing contingent commodities to model uncertainty, and establishing that economies have a finite number of price equilibria. He spent much of his career at the University of California, Berkeley developing rigorous mathematical foundations for microeconomics.",
