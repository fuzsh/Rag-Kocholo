        "text": "Bernard Cornet was born in Algiers where he spent the first years of his childhood by the Mediterranean sea, forging the warm personality that is so characteristic of him. He received his high school education in Perpignan in the south of France close to the Spanish border, and in 1969, he joined the Ecole normale supérieure in Paris. In 1972, he obtained the “agrégation de mathématiques” and 1 year later his PhD in Mathematics from the Université Paris-Dauphine. He then went to the University of California at Berkeley to study Economics with Gérard Debreu, under a Fulbright fellowship. The time spent at Berkeley, during the golden years of Mathematical Economics, has deeply influenced his lifetime research. Bernard is currently Professor of Mathematics at the Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, Chair Professor at the Paris School of Economics, and Oswald Distinguished Professor of Microeconomics at the University of Kansas. He has visited several universities throughout the world, with a lifelong relationship with CORE, Université catholique de Louvain, where he spent four years, first as a Research Fellow, later as the Research Director, and more recently as a CORE Distinguished Lecture Series recipient.\n\nBernard started his research life with a remarkable study of dynamical models in Economics, both from the normative side (planning procedures, accessibility of Pareto optima, and neutrality) and from the descriptive side (Non-tâtonnement exchange processes, Walrasian exchange processes), together with the study of discontinuous differential equations that emerged from these models. Then, his pioneering paper, introducing non-smooth analysis and Clarke’s normal cone in Economics, started a series of papers on increasing returns in a general equilibrium framework, many of which with Jean-Marc Bonnisseau. His most recent interest concerns financial markets, first with the study of general equilibrium with incomplete markets allowing for exogenous and endogenous portfolio constraints, and more recently the study of financial markets with frictions with the goal of explaining super-hedging prices as a nonadditive (Choquet) expectation, mainly in collaboration with Alain Chateauneuf.\n\nBernard has also made several contributions to general equilibrium theory: the study of externalities with a continuum of agents, linear exchange economies, generalized equilibria, and to stability and comparative statics in optimization theory. The research contributions of Bernard cover an impressively wide range of topics, and it is always a pleasure to hear Bernard give a talk and realize how a complex problem can be made so simple. He certainly likes to transmit his passion to young researchers, and his influence can also be seen through his numerous PhD students most of whom are now our colleagues in the profession.\n\nIn addition to his influential works in Economics and Mathematics, Bernard has provided tremendous service to the profession. In Paris, he founded the Department of Applied Mathematics at the Université Paris 1 and the research center in Mathematical Economics that has produced many French researchers in the field. In Europe, he has contributed to the integration of the European higher education system with the creation of a European (Erasmus Mundus) Master and Doctorate with other European universities and has been the Chair of the yearly European Conference in General Equilibrium Theory during the past 20 years. Bernard’s entrepreneurial activities have been beneficial to master and doctorate students, and also to undergraduate students, such as the more recent transatlantic exchange between his two alma mater institutions in Paris and Kansas. Last but not least, he has been the Editor in chief of the Journal of Mathematical Economics for more than 10 years, with extensive editorial activity in other Journals.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, a conference, organized in Paris to celebrate the 65th birthday of Bernard, gathered his friends and colleagues who came from all over the world. In order to express our appreciation for his contributions to the profession and his leadership, and also to give back the warm friendship we received over the years, we are pleased to edit a two-volume symposium in his honor. All the papers are contributions by his friends, colleagues, and students, and several of them were presented in the 2014 Paris conference.\n\nWe wish Bernard all the best for a long and healthy life as well as for the continuation of his vibrant research activities for many years to come."
