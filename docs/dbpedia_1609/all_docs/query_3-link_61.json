Our software, with the newly released #GreenAmmonia feature, can help make that happen. 📌 Find out more about the feature here: https://lnkd.in/deSwFsRr #CleanHydrogen #GreenHydrogen #HydrogenTechnology\n\n🚀 The 19th of September you can join Southern Lights free webinar: Keys to Preparing a Competitive Proposal for the Hydrogen Bank. Attend the event if you want to: 🔍 Learn about the EHB hydrogen auction system, including the procedures and critical dates for the second auction, set for December 2024. 🎯 Acquire crucial knowledge on the requirements and strategies for successful participation in the EHB hydrogen auctions, helping your projects stay ahead of the curve. 🌍 Explore the wider impact of the H2 auctions on the growth and expansion of the European hydrogen industry. 💡 Gain valuable insights from the first hydrogen auction results to uncover the key strategies for securing a winning bid. Webinar hosts: 👤 Felipe Gallardo is a hydrogen expert with long experience in clean energy business development & tech sales. He has hundreds of citations in scientific journals for green hydrogen tech research. 👤 José Cáceres is a Civil Electrical Engineer specialized in Power Electronics, and hydrogen consultant with years of experience in the renewable energy industry and tech development.\n\n🚀 Product Release 1.10.0 is here! What is new? 👉 You can now add a hydrogen storage to your project! This allows you to achieve a steady hydrogen output even if your energy input is varying. The operations of the storage will attempt to meet a 'target hydrogen output' with the given storage size and the hydrogen production. You can set your target to a fixed value or to a target with. In the cost section you can add any costs to the hydrogen storage to include for example CAPEX costs, OPEX costs and more. 🖥️ Interested in getting a demo of our product? Reach out to info@southernlights.io.\n\nWhy Waiting for Perfect Regulations Might Leave You Behind in the Hydrogen Market🚀 Regulations Always Lag Behind Innovation moves fast. Waiting means missing out on benefits, as seen in recent European Hydrogen auctions. A second auction is coming, and this is likely to be the case again. ⏳ Skeptics Will Doubt Doubters exist in every new market and technology as it was the case a few years ago with wind, solar, storage. The market is moving fast with many green hydrogen projects underway as this is the main and best viable solution to decarbonize many sectors hard to electrify as chemical industry, steel production or heavy transportation 🌍 Development Takes Time Development of hydrogen and Power-to-X projects from concept to FID is lengthy and can take more than 5 years if everything goes well.
