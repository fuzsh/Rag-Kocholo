On the other hand, Australia and New Zealand witnessed the southern lights or aurora australis.\n\nWhat are Auroras?\n\nAn aurora is a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic).\n\nAuroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.\n\nThey are also commonly known as the northern lights (aurora borealis) or southern lights (aurora australis).\n\nWhat is the Aurora Borealis?\n\nOften called the Northern Lights, it occurs in the northern hemisphere, predominantly in regions near the Arctic Circle.\n\nThis includes countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Canada, and Alaska.\n\nThe northern lights result from charged particles from the sun, mainly electrons and protons, colliding with the Earth’s magnetosphere and interacting with gases in the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nThese collisions produce colourful displays of light, primarily in green, red and purple hues.\n\nWhat is the Aurora Australis?\n\nAlso known as the Southern Lights, it occurs in the Southern Hemisphere, primarily around the Antarctic Circle.\n\nIt can be seen in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Antarctica, and parts of southern South America.\n\nThe southern lights have the exact underlying cause as the Northern Lights, i.e., charged particles from the sun interact with the Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere in the Southern Hemisphere, creating similar colourful light displays.\n\nUnderstanding the Northern and Southern Lights Phenomenon\n\nThey occur due to activity on the surface of the Sun. The star continuously releases a stream of charged particles, mainly electrons and protons, and magnetic fields called the solar wind.\n\nAs the solar wind approaches the Earth, it is deflected by the planet’s magnetic field, which acts like a protective shield.\n\nHowever, some of the charged particles are trapped in the magnetic field and they travel down the magnetic field lines at the north and south poles into the upper atmosphere of the Earth.\n\nThese particles then interact with different gases present there, resulting in tiny flashes that light up the night sky.\n\nFor example, when solar wind particles collide with oxygen, a green colour light is produced. Interaction with nitrogen produces shades of blue and purple.\n\nCan the Auroras Expand to Midlatitudes?\n\nWhen the solar wind is extremely strong, auroras can expand to midlatitudes.\n\nThis happens when the activity on the Sun’s surface goes up, leading to solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are essentially extra bursts of energy in the solar wind.\n\nIn these situations, the solar wind can be so strong that it can cause a geomagnetic storm/ a magnetic storm, which is a brief disruption of the Earth's magnetic field.\n\nGeomagnetic storms can also affect space-dependent operations like Global Positioning Systems (GPS), radio and satellite communications, flight operations, power grids, and space exploration programmes.\n\nOne such geomagnetic storm that was triggered after a CME (from the AR13664 region of the sun) struck the Earth was the cause of the recent aurora events that were observed in many regions of the world.\n\nQ.1. What are coronal mass ejections (CMEs)?\n\nA CME is a significant ejection of magnetic field and accompanying plasma mass from the Sun's corona into the heliosphere. CMEs are often associated with solar flares and other forms of solar activity.\n\nQ.2. What is the Hanle Dark Sky Reserve (HDSR)?\n\nThe HDSR, spanning an area of approximately 1,073 square kilometers, was recently designated by the Union Territory of Ladakh to control man-made light pollution and preserve the area's dark skies.\n\nSource: Severe solar storm triggers rare auroral arc in Ladakh sky\n\nDH\n\nIE\n\nSevere solar storm triggers rare auroral arc in Ladakh sky"
