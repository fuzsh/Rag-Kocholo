        "text": "Bandon Preserve\n\nA unique experience in every way, Bandon Preserve is a 13-hole par-3 course that delivers a level of enjoyment matched only by the spectacular views. Opened in 2012 and designed by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw, Bandon Preserve begins high atop a sand dune and rolls down toward the beach. The Pacific Ocean provides the backdrop to every hole and the course’s mission through the support of the Bandon Dunes Charitable Foundation is to promote a region where healthy ecosystems drive a vibrant economy.\n\nThe opening hole puts a short iron in your hands with the prevailing wind at your back. Pay attention to the hole location as this green is deep from front to back. Avoid the front bunker, a shot hit to the right will release onto the green.\n\nThis hole features a back-to-front sloping green with a large deep bunker guarding the front. A shot played to the back half of the green is the prudent play. The cross wind places an emphasis on yardage.\n\nThis deceivingly short hole plays tougher than first glance. The mound left of the green is a good target as the ball will release down to the hole. There is a ridge in the center of the green which hides the back portion.\n\nThis hole plays downhill to one of the resort’s largest green complexes. Mounds left and long will assist a shot hit to a back hole location. This double green shares putting surfaces with No. 7.\n\nWith the most dramatic elevation change on the course, this hole offers spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean. The prevailing wind will challenge a high ball flight. Avoid left as it slopes severely away from the green.\n\nNo. 6 is the “discovered hole” and plays at the lowest elevation on the course. Playing into the prevailing wind, proper club selection and ball flight is essential. Bunkers guard the front and left side of this green. The tall mound right of the green is a good bailout play, shooting the ball down to the hole.\n\nThis elevated green can play as the longest hole on the course. Pay attention to the hole location as it will greatly affect club selection. This undulated green can make for some difficult two putts.\n\nThe shortest hole on the course does not allow one to see the bottom of the flagstick. This punchbowl shaped green will assist a slight miss long and right. Be cautious of the ridge left center of the green as balls will feed far from the hole.\n\nSpectacular views of the Pacific Ocean and back 9 of Bandon Dunes make this an overwhelming tee shot. Pay attention to the elevation change as distance control is essential. The mound left of the green can provide forgiveness. Sensory overload is the cause for a miscue on this hole.\n\nThe last blind tee shot on the course as you can only see the top of the flag. This hole plays slightly uphill. Bunkers guard the front, left and back of the green. The green extends farther right than you anticipate.\n\nThis hole appears to be uphill but actually plays level. A shot to the right and long of the green is a safe play as it will feed back onto the green. Anything too far left winds up in Cut Creek.\n\nPay close attention to the wind here as there is typically a cross breeze coming from the left that can heavily play into your target selection. There is a large ridge that splits the green down the center creating two tiers. Favoring the right green tier on this hole will promote an approach that uses the terrain to your benefit.\n\nThe final hole provides unique options off the tee for those brave enough to try them. The tee shot is played into the prevailing wind and is not always best navigated with a lofted club. It has become tradition for all Bandonistas to putt down the left side of the approach, funneling their tee shots onto the green."
