        "text": "Every night of the year â rain, hail or moonshine â Fran Davis steps out onto her back deck, aims her camera at the southern sky and fires the shutter. She then peers into the rear display, waiting a few expectant seconds for the long exposure to resolve.\n\nFor people like Fran, who trade sleep for the thrill of seeing the aurora australis, or southern lights, the camera is like a gold miner's pan. What might appear to the naked eye as nothing more than a smudge of haze across the stars can suddenly set the LCD screen alight like a breathtaking jewel.\n\nAny sign of colour and Fran will dispatch a brief post online â something like, \"Bright pink. Sth Bruny\". The 66-year-old grandmother will then grab her camera gear and car keys, bid her husband goodnight and head out the door.\n\nIn half an hour Fran could be setting up her tripod on a wild bluff overlooking the Southern Ocean. She might spend an entire moonless night there, with only wallabies and possums for company, lost in the task of capturing another aurora.\n\nThree years ago, the very thought of such a venture would have turned Fran's blood cold. She had been afraid of the dark for her entire life. This was not just a case of the jitters; Fran's phobia induced sheer, disabling terror.\n\nShe had never been able to reason away her little-girl conviction that horrific menace occupied every shadow. Even when living in the safest of suburbs, she couldn't bring herself to walk to her own clothesline at night. Finding herself alone in the pitch-black outdoors was her perfect nightmare.\n\nFran became a little obsessed with the idea of capturing an aurora for herself. She joined the Aurora Australis Tasmania Facebook page and at once found a community of people happy to share photography tips and aurora forecasts.\n\nShe bought a camera, lens and tripod and when she finally found the nerve to venture out to shoot her first aurora, something unexpected happened. Absorbed in the task at hand, her fear evaporated.\n\nIn place of the familiar debilitating panic, a profound sense of calm came over her. And the change stuck. Before she knew it, Fran was out most evenings. The night had become her sanctuary.\n\n\"It was almost an instantaneous thing. I was just not afraid any more. I could stay out at night and time has no meaning, absolutely no meaning at all.\n\n\"You're just this insignificant little creature under all this magnificent nature.\"\n\nThis natural wonder also delivered Fran a surprising new community. When she joined the Facebook group it had about 200 members and, being so far south, she was often the first person outside Antarctica to confirm the presence of an aurora. In quick time Fran became recognised as the group's forward scout, known affectionately as 'The Canary'.\n\nIf the Facebook group is a barometer of interest in the aurora australis, interest is booming: in the three years since its inception, membership has risen from a handful to more than 24,000.\n\nThere are other gauges, though. In one Hobart photography store, the manager described auroras as the \"new rainforests\", chasing them being Tasmania's latest photography fad. Demand was high for \"aurora lenses\" â wide-angled, fast primes that do not come cheap. Then there was last year's Australia Post release of a southern lights stamp collection.\n\nBut the Facebook group is the southern lights water cooler, a rolling hub of aurora talk, aurora predictions and aurora photography.\n\nMargaret Sonnemann, the group's founder, has watched its rise with pride and wonder. The 61-year-old painter, who originally hails from the southern United States but has lived in Tasmania for a quarter of a century, witnessed her first aurora many years ago.\n\nOn the road home from Launceston to Hobart she noticed the capital glowing like it was on fire. She pulled over to take in the spectacle.\n\n\"It was as if I had seen music,\" she says.\n\n\"We got out of the car and spent a lot of time screaming. I'd heard about auroras before but never seen one. I was just so amazed.\n\n\"It's completely silent but yet there's this aspect that fills you with joy.\"\n\nAfter this experience Sonnemann craved another. Word of mouth was the only network available then and it routinely failed her â she only ever heard about an aurora after the event. She tried to find a way to be forewarned but struck out. Eventually, she gave up.\n\nYears later, she lucked upon her second aurora. It was then she resolved to never miss another. When Facebook took off, she recognised there was an opportunity to create a real-time aurora grapevine.\n\n\"I realised it was an ideal situation for sharing 'I can see an aurora now' information,\" she says.\n\nHer enterprise improved her hit rate out of sight.\n\n\"I've seen about 30 in the last two or three years.\"\n\nGood fortune has as much to do with that as anything. Seeing an aurora is not like going out to marvel at a full moon. There are so many variables involved it's more like trying to plan a family picnic under a rainbow.\n\nSonnemann's Facebook members thrive on the constant stream of data coming from billions of dollars worth of satellite gear. Various websites, and now apps, display this information in real time. Yet in spite of all the whizz-bang tripwires, the southern lights can be maddeningly elusive.\n\nThey can turn on when least expected or do a no-show when every indicator is off the charts. You can't always see them when they are there because, like stars, they can be obliterated by sunlight or blocked by clouds. They are more likely to last 30 minutes than three hours. And their intensity varies enormously: in some cases you would never know the lights were there; in others you would be gobsmacked by a stunning, psychedelic play of light.\n\nThat said, there is a sweet spot when it comes to aurora viewing because they tend to occur more often when the Sun is at its most volatile â the solar maximum. This is the period before and after a radical manoeuvre the Sun pulls every 11 years, in which it flips its magnetic field completely: north becomes south and vice versa. The last solar maximum occurred in late 2013, early 2014.\n\nNow, the Sun is slowly morphing towards its next dormant period, or solar minimum, in 2017-18.\n\nWhile auroras are known to be more prevalent around the peak of the solar cycle, there is really no telling when one will occur.\n\n\"Historically, some of the biggest events happen after the peak or before the peak,\" says Jeffrey Newmark, NASA's heliophysics division director. \"They can happen any time during the solar cycle.\"\n\nNo-one has spent more money trying to fathom the Sun than NASA. Newmark estimates the organisation has spent $5 billion in the last decade alone â yet even to this day much of its behaviour remains a mystery. Newmark's field may be young in an historical sense but it has an ancient imperative.\n\n\"Man has always tried to understand the Sun,\" he says. \"The Sun drives all energy and life.\"\n\nAnd it is the Sun where all auroras are born.\n\nKeeping us safe from solar storms is a regular day at the office for our planet. We don't just bask in the Sun's warmth and light, we feel its breath. Traversing the Sun's upper atmosphere, Earth is exposed to constant radiation in the form of 'solar wind'. Occasionally high-intensity gusts known as solar storms occur: these are the hurricanes of interplanetary space and are powerful far beyond any earthly measure.\n\nIn 'space weather' terms Cyclone Yasi, a category 5 cyclone that reached 285 kilometres per hour, was but a draft. Solar storms can hit Earth at speeds in excess of 700 kilometres per second.\n\nTo get advance warning of these storms you have to watch the Sun. And the best way to read the Sun's temperament is to look at its sunspots, those dark, relatively cool blotches that were first noticed by humans thousands of years ago.\n\nIn the mid-1800s, the solar cycle was discovered, a pattern in which the number of sunspots peaks every 11 years. But in 1859, an English amateur astronomer named Richard Carrington realised that sunspots could have a direct impact on Earth.\n\nHe was monitoring sunspot behaviour when the Krakatoa of auroras struck. During what would become known as the Carrington Event, the light emanating from both poles was so strong you could read newspapers by it in Brisbane and New York.\n\nSunspots are vast mosh pits of magnetic energy measuring up to 50,000 kilometres across. Great arcs of energy protrude out towards space, get sucked back in, pushed one way or pulled another, combine or split. And when they snap into a more stable alignment, a huge amount of energy can explode from the Sun in an extraordinary burst of light and heat called a solar flare.\n\nA particularly powerful solar flare can tear off a section of the Sun's outer layer, the corona, and send it rocketing through space â like the buckshot spray following a muzzle flash. This is a coronal mass ejection, or CME â a vast plasma cloud containing billions of tonnes of charged particles. Travelling at up to 1,000 kilometres per second, it can reach Earth in less than two days.\n\n\"The power is unimaginable compared to what we have here on Earth,\" says Newmark.\n\n\"The CME is a billion tonnes of material travelling at a million miles an hour. A huge amorphous cloud travelling through interplanetary space. The size of the Earth is almost infinitesimal compared to these. They're much larger than the Sun itself. They can fill a huge volume of space.\"\n\nSmaller, slower CMEs can also arise from filament eruptions in which a strand of the Sunâs outer layer is cast off.\n\nA third source of solar storms is a coronal hole, basically a vast pore in the Sun's magnetic field. With nothing to hold particles back, a 'firehose' effect is created and a high-velocity stream of particles escapes the Sun, sometimes striking the Earth.\n\nWhen these solar storms reach Earth, the planet's magnetic field contorts. On the daylight side, it is squashed and on the night side it is stretched. As the magnetosphere on the night side recoils to its usual state, charged particles are sucked back into the atmosphere. Following magnetic field lines, they rain down around the north and south poles.\n\nEn route, these charged particles â electrons and protons â crash into the Earth's atmospheric gases. As these gas molecules recover from the collision they release energy as light.\n\nItâs the same process that makes a neon light glow. But instead of lighting up a tube, an aurora illuminates a massive, dynamic electrical current running between Earthâs atmosphere and space.\n\nThe colours vary according to which molecules are being hit and at what altitude. Oxygen at the auroraâs base â typically a height of 100 kilometres â gives off green or yellow but higher up it produces red. Nitrogen can emit blue, red or purple.\n\nThe stronger the aurora the further it will push out from the poles. The auroras of the Carrington Event, the result of successive CMEs, were so strong they lasted three days and were visible from Cuba. Crowds gathered in the streets of New Orleans to watch the reddened sky.\n\nBut while some people drank in the visual feast, others recoiled at the sight, convinced it was the dawn of the apocalypse.\n\n\"The superstitious and the fanatical had dire forebodings, and thought it a foreshadowing of Armageddon and the final dissolution,\" wrote CF Herbert in his account of the Carrington aurora published in Perth's Daily News in 1909.\n\nThese days solar storms don't tend to prompt fears of humanity perishing in a wave of death rays, but they do raise other legitimate concerns.\n\nA CME's greatest danger comes via the geomagnetic storm it can generate. CMEs have a strong magnetic field of their own that can interfere with Earth's and pour strong currents into electrical wiring.\n\nThey regularly cause radio blackouts and can damage the electrical componentry of satellites â which are not protected by Earth's atmosphere â even slowing them down enough for them to fall out of orbit.\n\nVarious studies have found those disturbances can have adverse effects on the human body. Last year, a research team found geomagnetic storms were a significant risk factor for strokes, triggering 3 per cent of incidents around the world.\n\n\"Of 16.9 million new strokes currently happening in the world every year, almost a half million of these strokes could be attributed to geomagnetic storms,\" the team, led by the Auckland University of Technologyâs Valery Feigin, found.\n\nOther research links geomagnetic activity to increased rates of heart attack and even suicide.\n\nMessing with our bodies is one thing but what of the potential for CMEs to wipe humanity off the face of the Earth? In that sense they do not pose an existential threat. At least not directly.\n\n\"This is not a worry about life,\" says Newmark. \"This has gone on for the entire history of the Sun. What we call space weather events â solar flares, solar storms, CMEs â that's really going to affect our technological society more than life.\"\n\nThe concern regarding a CME's electromagnetic barrage is not that it will fry your smartphone but that you may have no hope of recharging it. Or getting water out of your tap. Or getting your heater working. Or your car refuelled. Or your toilet to flush. And not just for days but for months, perhaps years.\n\nDuring the Carrington Event, the penny dropped that auroras and geomagnetic storms were connected when it wreaked havoc with the internet of the day â the telegraph system. Some wires became so loaded with induced current that poles, stations and even paper caught fire. Operators across France reported sparks shooting out of the wires. Two operators on opposite sides of the US â one in Boston and one in Portland â reportedly unplugged their batteries and communicated using the current induced by the aurora alone.\n\nIn 2012, when a Carrington-class CME missed Earth by a week, many felt we had dodged a bullet. It prompted some to wonder what would happen if a CME of that size struck again. What if a supersized geomagnetic storm surged over the bulk of the planet, overloading our intricately wired, electricity-dependent, undersea cable-connected global civilisation?\n\nAccording to Murray Parkinson from the Bureau of Meteorology's Space Weather Services, a team that monitors space weather and issues warnings, we need take such a threat seriously.\n\n\"It is wise to prepare for the worst,\" Dr Parkinson says. \"In a highly interconnected world we are becoming more vulnerable to space weather.\"\n\nIn 1989, a geomagnetic storm blew out the power grid in Quebec, Canada, leaving 6 million people without electricity for nine hours. In 2003, a storm blacked out Sweden and disrupted satellites, airline travel and communications.\n\nBut reports examining the US's vulnerability to space weather events suggest things could get a lot worse: more than 130 million people living in black-out; millions dying from diseases borne of poor sanitation; weakened oil and gas pipelines; the US rendered a developing nation; the recovery costing trillions and taking up to 10 years.\n\n\"There will be very eminent scientists in the US space weather community preaching the doomsday scenario, which is possible though unlikely,\" says Dr Parkinson.\n\n\"But the world is probably not fully prepared for the worst-case-scenario-type event.\"\n\nSo how is Tasmania placed, given its proximity to the aurora? According to TasNetworks innovation engineer Derek Jones, Tasmania's electricity grid is not as vulnerable as those in North America featuring very long, high-voltage lines.\n\n\"The longest one we have in Tasmania is about 110 kilometres and that would probably be the most vulnerable, although that's still short and low voltage compared to the really vulnerable places like Canada,\" he says.\n\n\"Tasmania is fairly low risk but we monitor it anyway and if we damaged anything it's not likely to be the sort of equipment that directly supplies customers.\"\n\nDr Parkinson says Queensland's electricity operators have shown the most interest in monitoring space weather because of the lengths of their transmission lines.\n\n\"In Queensland, relatively minor geomagnetic storms will induce small but significant current surges in the grid, and the whole east coast of Australia is interconnected,\" he says.\n\n\"The question I think people need to ask themselves is how will populations respond to a situation in which they are without electricity for months on end, possibly several years in an extreme event?\n\n\"No electricity means no transport, no food, no water. How will that society respond?\"\n\nYou don't have to drive far in the dead of night to find a place where you feel you have Tasmania all to yourself. Except, that is, if your destination is one of the more accessible aurora vantage points.\n\nTake the boat ramp at Howden, a small bayside hamlet 20 minutes south of Hobart by car. Approaching the ramp along a winding dirt road, the headlights cutting a funnel between towering pines and black water, you could begin to feel uncomfortably isolated.\n\nBut at the road's end you may struggle to find a spot, both for your car and your tripod.\n\n\"It does get crowded down here,\" says Warren Donnelly, a keen aurora chaser who caught the bug a few years ago after seeing his first aurora from his backyard one night.\n\nTaking a moment away from his camera and turning off his headlamp, Donnelly says even with a modest forecast, up to 50 people can descend on Howden boat ramp.\n\nTo the south, the channel stretches into the distance to meet low-lying terrain over which the aurora rises.\n\nOn this night there was only a handful of people, staying put even though a full moon was diluting the strength of a vibrant aurora. But three years ago, before the aurora Facebook page came into being, even this would have been a crowd.\n\nBack then a handful of aurora chasers had the run of the entire island. From the vantage points they scoped out â vast, south-facing vistas replete with natural features like water, beaches, cliffs and trees â came photos that others tried to emulate.\n\nAnd with the pervasive advance of social media and digital photography, these old hands have been pushed to find even more remote spots to continue their work undisturbed.\n\nDonnelly, for one, enjoys the company. He gets to put a face to a name he knows from the internet, and to improve his photography.\n\n\"It's a great socialiser, and you're getting tips from other photographers who have been doing it longer than I have,\" he says.\n\nAs much as aurora chasing is about the experience of witnessing it, it is also about the art of photography. And the two are very different things.\n\nWhen set to exposures that typically range from 10 to 30 seconds a camera is better equipped than the human eye to detect and soak up colour at night. While the naked eye sees the movement and shape of the aurora, it is typically a desaturated, or even black-and-white, version of what the camera can capture. It is common to see hints of colour but only during strong aurora events are the colours unmistakable and strident.\n\n\"I recall two solar cycles ago, when I was in the scouts, half the southern sky was a rainbow of colours,\" remembers Ian Stewart, one of the pioneers of aurora photography in Tasmania. \"That was the first time I'd seen an aurora.\"\n\nSince then, the true glory of most of the auroras Stewart has witnessed has only been revealed by his camera.\n\n\"With the naked eye you see the movement but very rarely the colour,\" he says. \"But that's part of the attraction of photographing it: you'll see the aurora in all its spectacular colour.\"\n\nThe southern lights have not just spawned a league of local enthusiasts, they have given rise to new phenomena: aurora tourism. People are travelling to Tasmania for the express purpose of seeing an aurora, or at least factoring it into their plans as they would a trip to the Museum of New and Old Art in Hobart.\n\nThe need for an uncommon alignment of events â a solar storm that strikes Earth at the right angle on a cloudless night with a forgiving moon â makes planning a viewing futile. But being a lottery doesn't seem to dent the aurora's lure.\n\n\"Last January, in 2014, a coronal mass ejection occurred after this amazingly huge X-flare,\" remembers Sonnemann.\n\n\"X is as big as you can get, and there's this great CME heading right towards Earth. It got national coverage in anticipation of what was meant to be a fabulous aurora. People flew down here from interstate.\"\n\nAbout 100 people gathered at each of the more popular vantage points â Mount Wellington, Mount Nelson and Dru Point at Margate â to see this aurora that seemed to be almost guaranteed. But then nothing happened. The southern lights failed to show.\n\nTo take the guesswork out it, aurora apps have cropped up, channelling real-time data from satellites straight into the palm of your hand. With colourful displays, shifting dials and graphs it's sophisticated telemetry.\n\nStanding at the Howden boat ramp, someone will invariably have their nose in one, saying things like \"the KP's rising\" or \"the BZ's heading south\" and everyone will understand that that's good news in aurora-speak.\n\nAurora tourists like Nancy Leston from Vancouver, Canada, wouldn't leave home without these apps.\n\nLeston, 57, learned about the southern lights while researching her five-week trip to Australia. Following her find, she extended her time in Tasmania from a few days to a week to increase her chances of seeing an aurora.\n\n\"I have visited Alaska and Yukon but have never seen the northern lights,\" she says. \"Imagine how exciting it was to learn of the southern lights, and that it might be possible to see them when I'm there.\n\n\"I'd never even heard of them before, and many of my Aussie friends haven't managed to see them. Some didn't even know about them. That made me want to see them even more. Seeing the aurora would be truly special and unique feature of my visit.\"\n\nMelbourne university students Olia Borzyak, 22, and Benjamin Farrow, 24 spent every night of their week-long Tasmanian trip trying to catch an aurora. Like Leston, they had no luck but Borzyak has vowed to return until she is successful.\n\n\"I've always been mesmerized by the northern lights but in my ignorance I didn't realise the southern lights were ever seen by people, let alone visible from my own country,\" she says.\n\n\"I was extremely excited to see them as soon as I could. And I still feel the same way, and will continue to visit Tasmania until I see them.\n\n\"So many of my friends talk about ticking northern lights off the 'bucket list', completely unaware that we have essentially the same thing a one-hour flight away!\"\n\nSeasoned aurora chasers insist the mystery of the phenomenon is a large part of its appeal. And while advanced solar weather technology may take some of the guesswork out of catching an aurora, human sightings trump high-tech forecasts every time. Margaret Sonnemann does not recommend relying too much on an app.\n\n\"We have great satellite imagery of what's happening on the Sun, we have satellites that surround the Earth that tell us when things are hitting our atmosphere, but between the Sun satellites and the Earth satellites the pulse can be lost.\n\n\"So that's why the most reliable way to find out about an aurora is someone saying, 'I see one now' not 'we think it's going to happen'.\"\n\nThat is why so many people count on real-time alerts from the likes of 'The Canary', Fran Davis.\n\nAnd it seems Fran will happily serve as a sentinel for as long as she draws breath. Her commitment to all things aurora runs far deeper than most people know.\n\nFran says that aurora photo she came across back in 2012 did more than transform her life; it saved it.\n\nIt arrived just after she had returned home from spending five months living with her dying mother. The two were extremely close, more like sisters. During those last days they often talked about the afterlife, and of heaven.\n\n\"Let me know that you're there,\" Fran would tell her mother. \"Send me a sign.\"\n\nBut all their preparedness proved to be little comfort to Fran once her mother died. She felt utterly bereft, the root of her bearings gone.\n\n\"I was lost.\"\n\nBut not long into her pursuit of the aurora, Fran discovered that the boundless might of the cosmos had an intimate touch; standing beneath it Fran sensed a fresh connection with her mother. She suspects she will sound batty to say so but Fran felt it was perfectly natural to speak to her mother out there â and in return she felt her mother's presence and reassurance.\n\nIn the last place she would have looked, Fran found deep consolation.\n\n\"I know it's not rational but she was just so incredibly important to my life,â she says.\n\nâI felt she'd sent me this to replace her.\""
