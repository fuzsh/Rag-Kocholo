        "text": "Monday, April 24, 2023\n\nThis is a follow-up to the continuing story of the severe geomagnetic storm that reached Earth Sunday night. This was advertised to be a big event, and it did not disappoint. Based in the Mid Atlantic region, it is rare to see the Northern Lights this far south, but occasionally it happens. Most recently, there was an event on March 23 that was documented down to North Carolina.\n\nHere is a look at 10 new photos of the Aurora across Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia. If you missed my prior report, I will add those below.\n\nK-Index\n\nThe Planetary K Index is a measure of the intensity of Earth’s electrical field disruption. This reached severe levels and peaked at 8 a few times overnight. This often correlates with visible aurora south of 40ºN, which means our region.\n\nAurora Photos\n\nVirginia\n\nI want to start off with the Aurora Pillar seen in NW Frederick County in Virginia. Jill Cook captured one of the most vivid displays in the region.\n\nMaryland\n\nThese first two pics appeared to have captured an Aurora Pillar, with interact with one crystals lower in the atmosphere.\n\nAurora In Baltimore County, Maryland\n\nI received this photo contrasting with the power lines from @BaltimoreBSRK\n\nSee more photos and location of this viewing…\n\nAurora in Ellicott City, Maryland\n\nThis from Sami Uddin @9sami98 on Twitter\n\nAnother From Sami in Ellicott City\n\nThe Quad-Screen from Sami\n\nCarroll County, Maryland\n\nAurora in Westminster, Maryland\n\nThis is from Rick Edwards showing the green and purple hue.\n\nAurora in Hampstead, MD\n\nThis color shows up behind this cluster of trees. Thanks to Kelly Hayes.\n\nAurora in Sykesville\n\nNick Proudfoot had to leave the exposure open longer and the clouds may hinder your view here… But I see the purple shade to the sky just above the tree line.\n\nWestern Maryland\n\nDeep Creek Lake in Garrett County\n\nThis from The Deep Creek Lake Times. See their Facebook page to give them a follow.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes From Kyle Brochet\n\nMore Photos From My Prior Report\n\nStonehenge Aurora\n\nOne of the more spectacular views was seen over Stonehenge in the UK. This may end up on a widely distributed poster or high gloss photo near you.\n\nSee the photographer here Stonehenge Dronescapes\n\nNew Jersey Aurora\n\nThis glowing view was captured by…\n\nMaryland Aurora Lights\n\nCentral Maryland did get a faint view as shown by James Wilinghan. He identified that there was clearing after sunset.\n\nSt. Louis Aurora Lights\n\nThis is at a similar altitude to Baltimore and has a wonderful display seen here.\n\nKaleidoscope Aurora in Montana\n\nCory Mottice captured what looked like a tied-eye shirt at a Grateful Dead Concert at times.\n\nREPORTS:\n\nNEW: April Heat Wave History\n\nWinter 2023 Recap: My BUSTED Snow Outlook\n\nLa Niña Has Ended. El Niño May Return By Fall\n\nSubscribe for eMail Alerts\n\nSTEM Assemblies/In School Fields Trips Are Back\n\nClick to see more and ‘Book’ a visit to your school\n\nPlease share your thoughts, best weather pics/videos, or just keep in touch via social media\n\nFacebook: Justin Berk, Meteorologist\n\nTwitter\n\nInstagram\n\nRESTATING MY MESSAGE ABOUT DYSLEXIA\n\nI am aware there are some spelling and grammar typos, and occasional other glitches. I take responsibility for my mistakes, and even the computer glitches I may miss. I have made a few public statements over the years, but if you are new here you may have missed it: I have dyslexia, and found out during my second year at Cornell University. It didn’t stop me from getting my meteorology degree, and being first to get the AMS CBM in the Baltimore/Washington region. One of my professors told me that I had made it that far without knowing, and to not let it be a crutch going forward. That was Mark Wysocki and he was absolutely correct! I do miss my mistakes in my own proofreading. The autocorrect spell check on my computer sometimes does an injustice to make it worse. I also can make mistakes in forecasting. No one is perfect predicting the future. All of the maps and information are accurate. The ‘wordy’ stuff can get sticky. There has been no editor that can check my work when I needed it and have it ready to send out in a newsworthy timeline. Barbara Werner is a member of the web team that helps me maintain this site. She has taken it upon herself to edit typos, when she is able. That could be AFTER you read this. I accept this and perhaps proves what you read is really from me… It’s part of my charm.\n\n#FITF"
