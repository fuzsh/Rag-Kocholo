As a result of the draw-down, the boat ramp at Swift Forest Camp on the Lewis River in southwest Washington will be out of service starting in early September.\n\nThis week, PacifiCorp received the Emergency Response Award from Edison Electric Institute in recognition of the companyâ€™s response to the 2023 Smith River Complex fires in Northern California."
