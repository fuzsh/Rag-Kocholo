In addition, many of Ontario’s national parks, provincial parks, conservation areas and wilderness spaces are prime places to witness the Northern Lights.\n\nSouthwestern Ontario\n\nPoint Pelee National Park\n\nSituated at the southernmost point of the Canadian mainland, Point Pelee was designated as a Dark-Sky Preserve (DSP) by the Windsor Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC) in 2006 for its commitment to protecting the nighttime environment. On selected Dark-Sky Nights, the park stays open until midnight for optimal stargazing. Bring binoculars or a telescope or even view millions of stars with the naked eye.\n\nLocation: 1118 Point Pelee Drive, Leamington\n\nHuron, Perth, Waterloo and Wellington\n\nPoint Farms Provincial Park\n\nJust north of the town of Goderich, Point Farms Provincial Park offers an expansive view of the night sky over Lake Huron.
