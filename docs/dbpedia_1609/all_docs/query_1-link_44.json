        "text": "Mission Statement\n\nOur mission: Steward the City’s public infrastructure and environment in a manner that contributes to Alameda’s livability and sustainability.\n\nOur vision: Alameda is the best performing, most talented, and efficient Public Works department in the Bay Area.\n\nOur values:\n\n“Together, we go further.”\n\nCollaboration and cooperation among our staff and with other departments helps us have more fun, create better ideas, and serve more Alamedans. Involvement of key partners and stakeholders helps us correct flaws in our work, improve our service, and promote transparency.\n\nSafety\n\nWe believe the safety of the public, and our staff, is paramount.\n\nIntegrity\n\nWe are honest and ethical with each other and the public.\n\nService\n\nWe exist to serve the public and one another. Excellent service is responsive, transparent, efficient, and results-oriented.\n\nInnovation and growth\n\nSolutions to the adversity we experience will come through empowering staff to thinking differently and constantly grow.\n\nClean Water Program\n\nWith the Clean Water Program, the City is committed to providing Alameda residents and businesses practical solutions to help reduce stormwater pollution. Learn more here.\n\nZero Waste Program and Services\n\nThe City is a leader in recycling and composting, from passing new initiatives to providing resources for residents and businesses to contribute. Learn more about what the City is doing and how you can help here.\n\nEarth Day\n\nPlease click here for more information about Earth Day.\n\nCity Projects\n\nLearn about projects happening all around the city here.\n\nAnnual Reports\n\nTo view a user-guided 2014-15 Annual Report that takes about 10 minutes, click here.\n\nTo view a more in-depth 2014-15 Annual Report with voice-over that is 23 minutes, click here.\n\nIn the 1950’s, the Utah Corporation created five connected lagoons along the southwest shoreline of Alameda, between the original coast and the new South Shore Development.\n\nThe South Shore Lagoon system brings in salt-water from the San Francisco Bay and supports diverse wildlife.\n\nAlthough the lagoons are privately owned and can be used for recreational uses by the adjacent property owners and members of the Alameda West Lagoon Homeowners' Association (AWLHOA), the lagoon system is also a storm drainage retention and treatment pond for portions of Alameda Island.\n\nThe South Shore Lagoon system is divided into segments:\n\nLagoon 1: Westline to Grand\n\nLagoon 2: Grand to Willow\n\nLagoon 3: Willow to Park\n\nLagoon 4: Park to Broadway\n\nLagoon 5: Broadway to Court\n\nLagoon Maintenance\n\nTo view the North Shore Dock spec and South Dock Spec drawings, click here.\n\nPer Alameda West Lagoon HOA, the board is not going to lower the lagoons this year, but will lower next year in April or May.\n\nWater Quality\n\nThe Public Works Departments and the AWLHOA are jointly responsible for maintaining the water quality. Inspection and debris removal is performed weekly. Water quality of the lagoons is monitored through use of indicator bacteria. You can view test results on the AWLHOA\n\nTo control algal blooms and widgeon grass, aquatic pesticide treatments are applied under the regulatory authority of the Regional Water Board. Here is the City’s notice of intent(PDF, 89KB) per the Statewide General National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit for Residual Aquatic Pesticide Discharges to Waters of the United States from Algae and Aquatic Weed Control Application. The City’s Aquatic Pesticide Application Plan(PDF, 1MB) (APAP) describes the project site, aquatic plant and algae nuisances, aquatic pesticide products expected to be used, the monitoring program, and Best Management Practices to be followed. The use of aquatic pesticides within the Alameda Lagoons is necessary to manage the lake and maintain the beneficial uses that include storm water retention, fishing, swimming, boating, aesthetics, and a habitat and resting place for waterfowl and migratory birds.\n\nTo submit a comment, question or service request on any of the lagoons within this system, please do so here."
