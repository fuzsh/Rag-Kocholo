This phenomenon is caused when energized particles from the sun smash into the earth’s upper atmosphere at intense speed. As earth’s magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles (there are southern lights, too), the process transforms […]",

        "text": "Where to See Them?\n\nLake Superior beaches make great viewing areas for the northern lights in the Munising area. If NOAA is predicting solar activity, check out Sand Point Beach, Miners Beach or Twelvemile Beach as many people have had luck seeing them at those locations.\n\nKeep in mind that the auroral display is low on the horizon because of the area’s latitude, so you don’t want to go somewhere deep in the woods where your view can be easily obstructed.\n\nDon’t Forget About the Sunsets, Too!\n\nNothing compares to catching a sunset over Lake Superior, especially in the Pictured Rocks where rays reflect off towering cliffs and sea caves. We suggest checking out Sand Point Beach and Miners Beach for some of the best views."
