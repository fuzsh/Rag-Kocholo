        "text": "Whether these are Australis or Borealis, the auroras represent one of the most exquisite natural speeches.\n\nWith a few exceptions, beauty, in the fullest sense of the word, culminates in manifestations courtesy of nature. The geometry of the orchid, the peacock’s colorful baggage, the lively rhythms of cracks in stone walls, or the evanescent elegance of fog are but a few examples to support this premise.\n\nAmong the myriad gifts which nature bestows upon our senses, the unequivocal paradises destined to impart lessons in beauty and perfection, there is one which is particularly radiant —perhaps because it comprises a series of qualities that, when combined, can easily induce an ecstatic state: the Northern and Southern Lights.\n\nParadisiacal choreographies which mark the memory of anyone who has the privilege of seeing them, the auroras are exclusive to the more extreme latitudes. Perhaps this geographical exuberance adds to their implicit beauty even more.\n\nFortunately, there are several spots around the world from which we can appreciate the auroras with indelible clarity. The following are ten places where, due to a series of atmospheric circumstances, you can envelop yourself in an aural blanket while you remember that perhaps we live, at least at the present moment, in the best of possible worlds.\n\nAurora Borealis (Northern Hemisphere)\n\nAreas surrounding Reykjavik, Iceland’s capital.\n\nKiruna, Sweden’s most septentrional city.\n\nIvalo, a small town located in the north of Finland.\n\nThe area known as Lake Superior, in Ontario, Canada.\n\nPractically anywhere in Greenland.\n\nAurora Australis"
