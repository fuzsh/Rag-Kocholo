        "text": "To answer this, we start with the sun whose energy production is far from even and fluctuates on an 11 year cycle. Maximum production coincides with high sunspot activity when processes on the sunâs surface throw particles far out in space. These particles are called the solar wind and cause the northern lights.\n\nThe sunâs surface temperature is approximately 6,000Â°C, much cooler than the interior which is several million degrees. In the sunâs atmosphere or corona, the temperature rises again to several million degrees. At such temperatures, collisions between gas particles can be so violent that atoms disintegrate into electrons and nuclei. What was once hydrogen becomes a gas of free electrons and protons called plasma. This plasma escapes from the sunâs corona through a hole in the sunâs magnetic field. As they escape, they are thrown out by the rotation of the sun in an ever widening spiral â the so-called garden-hose effect.\n\nAfter 2-5 daysâ travel trough space, the plasma reaches the earthâs magnetic field compressing it on the daylight side of the earth, and stretches it into a âtailâ on the night side. A few of the particles penetrate down to the earth along the lines of magnetic field in the polar areas. Most, however, are forced around the earth by the magnetic field and enter the âtailâ which stretches out into a long cylinder. Its diameter is equivalent to 30-60 times the earthâs radius, and its length up to 1000 times the same radius. It is, in effect, as if the earthâs magnetic field creates a tunnel in the plasma current from the solar wind. Inside one end is the earth, and around its surface the earthâs magnetism and the solar wind interact. The magnetic tail is divided into two by a sheet of plasma. The magnetic field lines from the earthâs north and south pole stretch out in their respective halves such that the fields are in opposition. The electrons and protons in each half of the plasma rotate in opposite direction forming a huge âdynamoâ with the positive pole on the side of the plasma sheet facing dawn and the negative pole facing evening. The âdynamoâ is driven by the current of charged particles between the two poles.\n\nWhen the northern lights break out the following happens. The solar wind strengthens and the magnetic tail becomes unstable. Charged particles dive inwards towards the center of the tail and cause it to increase in length and to taper. The particles draw the magnetic field lines toward the center where they meet causing a magnetic âshort-circuitâ approximately 15 times the earthâs radius above the earth on the night side. This occurs especially at the âdynamoâsâ two poles where a large amount of energy becomes stored. The magnetic field lines from both sides of the plasma layer now act as conductors in the âdynamoâsâ outer circuit.\n\nThe most active region of the auroral oval typically becomes visible around local midnight. This region is also the widest part of the oval in the north-south direction, so your best chance of seeing aurora borealis is around local midnight. (Note that this is astronomical midnight, which may be an hour or two different from civil or âwall clockâ midnight due to daylight savings time or other peculiarities in your time zone.)\n\nSpectacular aurora borealis displays due to geomagnetic disturbances may be seen at any time when the sky is dark, but they are relatively unpredictable. Under average conditions, observations around local midnight are most likely to yield results.\n\nIt is not possible to predict auroral activity very far in advance. As solar activity increases and decreases in 11 year cycles, the forecast is less predictable, the further away from maximum activity we are. Forecasts usually are limited to a few days based on current observations of solar flares and sunspots.\n\nSo, if you are planning a trip monthâs in advance, consider the previous âfaqâs. Beyond that, we can truly say âyour guess is as good as oursâ.\n\nâ\n\nHowever, you may want to consider the phases of the moon as the winter skies with snow on the ground may be very bright under a full moon. Therefore the darker nights around new moon seem to be better for the observation of the Aurora Borealis."
