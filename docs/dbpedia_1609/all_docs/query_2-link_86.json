        "text": "The NOAA's solar flare forecast had one small blind spot: Contrary to the agency's prediction that sightings of the aurora borealis in the southern U.S. states wouldn't include Florida, many reported seeing the Northern Lights all up and down the Sunshine State last night, and they posted the receipts on social media.\n\nAs midnight neared Friday evening, Mike Theiss, a veteran storm chaser, posted stunning photos on X that he said were shot from Key Largo, where he's based.\n\n\"Northern Lights RIGHT NOW over #KeyLargo Florida, this is insane to see the Aurora Borealis so far south!\" Theiss shared at 11:12 pm. in a post that has logged more than a million views on the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nTheiss, who maintains the website Extreme Nature, is also featured in a National Geographic series called Storm Rising, chasing storms and that adrenaline rush. We DM'ed him for details and will elaborate if and when we hear back.\n\nHe wasn't the only one: Local lensman @depotsma ventured forth to Big Cypress National Preserve and captured some stunning images away from the Magic City lights. He was kind enough to let us share one of his shots to top this post.\n\nStorm chaser Jeff Gammons (@StormVisuals) checked in on X from Okeechobee County.\n\nAnother X user caught a glimpse from Sunny Isles Beach!\n\nJulia Bergeron, who shoots for the publication nasaspaceflight.com, posted from Canaveral National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nAnd here's a view from Palm Bay in Central Florida.\n\nFeel free to troll X for more sightings."
