        "text": "HARRISONBURG, Va. (WHSV) - Several solar flares have been directed toward earth this week and after an impressively strong G-5 solar storm Friday night, another strong solar storm is expected Saturday night. NOAA has updated the forecast for Saturday night for a G4 and G5 solar storm at times. Remember this comes as waves. So you’ll get a burst, then a lull then another burst.\n\nThe stronger the solar storm, the further south the northern lights can be seen. On Friday night, Aurora was seen as far south as Mexico and the Bahamas/South Florida. It’s possible to see them again Saturday night.\n\nPersonally, I use an app called Space Weather Live for Kp alerts. I have them set at 7+.\n\nYou can also look at the Space Weather Dashboard from NOAA for storm strength, timing, and more information and that link is below if you scroll down. Many people on Friday night were capturing the lights from their own backyard. Do not expect to just look out the window and see the lights.\n\nHowever, what you see in photographs, is not what you would see with the naked eye.\n\n“I can start picking up the aurora in the distance on a 30 second exposure on my camera, but that’s not going to show up to my naked eye. So you really need very bright aurora and it needs to be really far south for you to start seeing it.”\n\nSome of the best places would be on Skyline drive and at Spruce Knob. If you want a better map showing light pollution, click here:\n\nThis solar storm could be strong enough for you to see it without a camera. So the best advice from Forister: “You need to be in dark skies where you are but also dark skies looking to the north and that’s your best chance to see the northern lights”\n\nForister has captured the aurora from Skyline Drive multiple times over the last few years so it is possible so see , but don’t expect to just stand outside and magically see lights dancing in the sky. “You still have to be patient, let your eyes adjust and it may be several hours before you start to see the lights”\n\nNow space weather forecasting is very different from-- well, typical weather forecasting. So disappointment is possible.\n\nHERE’S THE LINK FOR THE LATEST STRENGTH ON THE SOLAR STORM AND TIMING UPDATES- click here for the latest forecast and updates\n\nWhen you look at the link below, you’ll notice the KP index for May 11th, that’s the strong solar storm on Friday night, early Saturday morning that’s already happened. Now you will see the forecast for Saturday night, early Sunday morning it’s now at a G4 and G5 at times. So this may rival Friday night. Times are given in UTC time. So 09-12UT for May 12th is 11pm, that’s early Sunday morning from 5-7am, locally. (You’re subtractive four hours from military time).\n\nHonestly, I would sign up for alerts through an app and go out once the Kp hits 7, or just head out after dark and once the skies clear from time to time.\n\nWe will start to clear out this evening but not fully clear. So there will be a few clouds but a good amount of clearing in some areas.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nOr just try to use night mode on your camera phone.\n\nMore from NOAA Space Weather:"
