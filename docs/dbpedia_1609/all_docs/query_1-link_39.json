It is the City's goal to improve it's roads with it's available funds and while not all roads can be improved as early as desired, the City welcomes and considers the community's input in deciding which roads to prioritize for improvement. Roadway improvement requests are tracked by the engineering team and can be sent to engineering@cityofepa.org.\n\nThe Adopted 2024-2028 PMP can be found HERE.\n\nSpeed Hump Requests\n\nThe City Council has adopted a process for citizens to request speed humps on their streets.
