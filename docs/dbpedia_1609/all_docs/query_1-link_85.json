        "text": "PARIS – Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson stood in the entry and bellowed, then clapped his hands twice.\n\nThe American Noah Lyles bounded onto the track. Showman? Or too amped up for the moment? Before the start, he kept talking to himself. The NBC cameras focused on him and, in the stands, his mother, Keisha Caine Bishop.\n\nSome moments passed. A lot of nervous energy. So much nervous energy. Lyles jumped, in front of the blocks. Thompson turned around to take a look at the stands, then pointed down the track.\n\nHere, in the pause before the gun goes off, is always one of the defining moments of any Olympic Games. Everywhere in our world, kids do some version of this – race ya.\n\nEvery number of years, this most elemental thing, let’s race, comes to supreme fruition, the hopes and dreams of kids everywhere coiled into the explosive energy of the 100 meters at the Olympics.\n\nThe night before, in the rain, Julien Alfred of Saint Lucia had won the women’s 100. She ran with strength and composure. Sha’Carri Richardson of the United States took second. You could see in Richardson’s eyes when she was introduced that the moment was – too much. Not for Alfred, now winner of Saint Lucia’s first-ever medal. Of any color.\n\nNow, on a beautiful night in Paris, 72 degrees, no rain, a very slight tailwind at their backs, it was time for the men.\n\nWho would be the guy?\n\nThere can only be one fastest man in the world.\n\nOther races, other events, surely command attention. But it is the men’s 100 that produced track and field’s biggest name, Usain Bolt. It is the men’s 100 for which the stadium went dark Sunday night. The crowd went ooh and ahh for a light show.\n\nThen the bright lights came back up.\n\nAll eight guys settled into the blocks.\n\nAnd on this Sunday night, Noah Lyles would silence – after one of the great hype campaigns in American history – every critic.\n\nBy five-thousandths of a second.\n\nLyles had won the 100 last summer at the world championships in Budapest.\n\nThompson had emerged this spring and summer as the who-is-this-guy rival from Jamaica.\n\nThey crossed in 9.79.\n\nBoth of them.\n\nThe electronic timer, though, goes out to thousandths.\n\nIt put Lyles, in Lane 7, at .784.\n\nThompson, Lane 4, .789.\n\nThe American Fred Kerley, who took second in Tokyo three years ago behind Italy’s Marcell Jacobs, crossed third here Sunday, in 9.81.\n\nSouth Africa’s Akani Simbine was fourth, 9.82; Jacobs next, 9.85. The race was so fast that Jamaica’s Oblique Seville finished last, eighth, in 9.91.\n\nWorld Athletics said it was the first time ever eight men had broken 10 seconds in a wind-legal race.\n\nIt also marked the first time the United States won this Olympic men’s 100 in 20 years, since Justin Gatlin, in Athens.\n\nIt also marked the first time the Americans put two guys into a top three in a men’s Olympic 100 since Athens.\n\nFor the first time, eight men broke 10 seconds in a wind-legal race.\n\nLyles’ 9.79 is the fastest, by a tick, he has ever run a 100.\n\nHe did it in – for him – classic fashion.\n\nLyles has to make up for a relatively poor start with a devastating close. At 10 meters, Lyles was eighth, dead last. By 50 meters, halfway through the race, he was seventh.\n\nAt 60, he was third.\n\nAt 90, he had closed to second – just one-hundredth of a second behind Thompson, who had been in front of the race from the 30-meter mark on."
