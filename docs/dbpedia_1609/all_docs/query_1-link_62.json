The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:01 a.m., in room SD-342, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Ron Johnson, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Johnson, Ayotte, Ernst, Sasse, Carper, McCaskill, and Peters. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN JOHNSON Chairman Johnson. Now that I have my cup of coffee, this hearing will come to order. Senator Carper will be a little bit late, so he told me that I could start the hearing without him. Let me first welcome our witnesses. Thank you for your thoughtful testimony. I have read it all. I hope every Committee Member has read it all. I hope everybody in the audience has, and I would encourage members of the public to read this testimony and pay attention to this hearing. I was first made aware of the potential threat of electromagnetic pulse (EMP), disruptions to our electrical grid and geomagnetic disturbances (GMD) well before I ever became a United States Senator. But I think like most members of the public, it is one of those scary things that is, ``Ah, that is just science fiction. What are the chances of that?'' When I became a United States Senator, I was briefed by a couple gentlemen who gave me a booklet that I read that made me pretty concerned. This was probably a couple of years ago, and I started talking to other Members, and a lot of those Members never really even heard of this threat. I have raised this in secure briefings with members of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and I have been told, ``OK, we are on that. We are looking into it.'' But the fact of the matter is that this was first made public and declassified in 2004, and we had a congressional commission on that. And then we had another commission in 2008, and the dangers posed by EMP and GMD have been well known really for decades but made public now for over 10 years, and we literally have not done anything. So the purpose of this hearing is to basically stop and pull our head out of the sand, and start paying attention to this very real threat. We are going to be debating a nuclear deal with the State of Iran. We already know we have North Korea with both nuclear weapon capability and ballistic missile technology, and that ballistic missile technology is improving in North Korea. We know that Iran has those exact same ambitions, and I guess now we have a deal that is going to end an embargo on their ballistic missile technology. There are satellites that are orbiting overhead that could potentially deliver a nuclear explosion that would cause something like this. So this is a threat that is real and that we need to acknowledge. Now, as I was made aware of this and I started talking to colleagues, a lot of time people's opinion of this was marginalized by, ``Well, those are just lobbyists that want to sell the Federal Government some protections.'' I think we need to keep our eyes open for that type of conflict. But it is no reason to not be addressing this and taking a look in a very serious fashion. So today we have I think, a good panel of witnesses, starting with Ambassador James Woolsey and Joseph McClelland and Richard Garwin and Chris Currie and Bridgette Bourge--am I pronouncing that correctly? Ms. Bourge. Yes, Senator. Chairman Johnson. That is actually unusual that I get it right the first time.--some people that will give us the truth and give us the information on this. So I am looking forward to your testimony. When Senator Carper gets here, we will give him an opportunity to make an opening statement as well, but let us just start by maintaining the tradition of this Committee, which is that we do swear witnesses in. So if you would all rise and raise your right hand. Do you swear that the testimony you will give before this Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God? Mr. Woolsey. I do. Mr. McClelland. I do. Mr. Garwin. I do. Mr. Currie. I do. Ms. Bourge. I do. Chairman Johnson. Thank you. Please sit. Our first witness will be Ambassador James Woolsey. Ambassador Woolsey is the former Director of Central Intelligence and Ambassador to and chief negotiator for the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty from 1989 to 1991. He is currently the Chairman of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and is a venture partner with Lux Capital Management. Ambassador Woolsey. TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE R. JAMES WOOLSEY,\\1\\ FORMER DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE, AND CHAIRMAN, FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES; ACCOMPANIED BY PETER VINCENT PRY, PH.D., EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE TASK FORCE ON NATIONAL HOMELAND SECURITY Mr. Woolsey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the interest of our 6-minute limit, I will summarize quickly several major points. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The prepared statement of Ambassador Woolsey appears in the Appendix on page 49. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- First of all, the Earth has been being bombarded by electromagnetic pulses for about 4\\1/2\\ billion years, so in one sense, this is not a new issue. And I am not going to get into the details of the difference between the different wavelengths from electromagnetic pulses versus those created by the Sun and the like, but will generalize more in the interest of time. We have a very serious problem with exactly what you described: lack of willingness to admit or understand at the beginning that this could be as serious as it is given how horrible it is. People tend to want to shove those types of issues aside. But, in fact, there are ways in which electromagnetic pulse threats are more serious than a conventional version of a nuclear threat. For example, deterrence may not work at all with respect to electromagnetic pulse. The reason is we may not know where the pulse came from. If everything goes dark, it may be a solar event, and it may be North Korea. Furthermore, a satellite can be launched into orbit with a southern trajectory, so it misses, at least initially, all of our radars and other sensors that are focused north. And, second, it could be launched--a Scud with a warhead could be launched from a freighter off one of our coasts. We recently had a North Korean freighter picked up by the Panamanians that had two air defense missiles in it, each capable of putting something into orbit. So we have a very serious problem from the point of view of deterring particularly a country such as Iran or North Korea that is not playing by anywhere close to the standards of rationality that one would see even in, let us say, China or Russia when we are having tense relations with one another. So I think that is the first and biggest problem. We do not just have a probability issue the way one would have if we were only worried about the solar EMP events. That could be bad enough because we are due for a very large pulse event. The last one occurred over a century and a half ago, and we are due for another. But that could come anytime or not come for some time. The decision by a North Korean leader or an Iranian leader that it is time to destroy the electric grid of the United States is a different matter. We do not know what they are going to do and when. People say, ``Well, they are not crazy.'' But sometimes individual government leaders such as Adolf Hitler are mad north by northwest. They have horrible objectives, and they pursue them very diligently. The objectives are not something any of us would sympathize with. The same could well be true of an Iranian missile, which they have now, and an Iranian nuclear weapon, which I think even under this agreement they are likely to have or be able to have within months to perhaps a year or two. The use of electromagnetic pulse has been embodied in writings in the East, Russian and Chinese particularly. I would call everybody's attention to the work of the Russian General Vladimir Slipchenko in his military textbooks which focus on EMP together with cyber as the new mode of warfare. An EMP for the North Korean, Iranian, Russian, and Chinese point of view is part of cyber and a particularly deadly part. There have been a number of efforts for us to find some way to take positive steps to do something about electromagnetic pulse, whether from a nuclear weapon or from the sun, and they have all been thwarted. Washington is completely dysfunctional on this issue and has been for some time. The amount of money involved is relatively small by infrastructure need standards. According to the EMP Commission, about $2 billion, about what we give in foreign aid to Pakistan every year for dealing with the essentials of the electric grid, $10 to 20 billion, according to the Commission, would protect all of the critical infrastructures from nuclear EMP attack. From the point of view of the cost of improvements in our infrastructures that are badly needed, that is not a great deal of money. But so far the resistance in the North American Electrical Reliability Corporation (NERC), and in industry has been solid and total. They have been able to prevent steps by individual States that have wanted to take action, and they have done everything they possibly can to keep the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act (CIPA) and the reestablishment of the congressional EMP Commission and the SHIELD and GRID Acts all bottled up and not being able to be passed by the Congress. One, perhaps two pointed observations by Texas State Senator Robert Hall, a former Air Force colonel and himself an EMP expert, characterizes the behavior of the electric utilities and their lobbyists on this matter, Mr. Chairman, as ``equivalent to treason.'' Thank you. Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Ambassador Woolsey. Our next witness will be Joseph McClelland. Mr. McClelland is the Director of the Office of Energy Infrastructure Security (OEIS) at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). His office provides leadership, expertise, and assistance to identify, communicate, and seek comprehensive solutions to potential risks to FERC-regulated facilities from cyber attacks and physical threats such as electromagnetic pulses. Mr. McClelland. TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH MCCLELLAND,\\1\\ DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY, FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Mr. McClelland. Thank you, Chairman Johnson, for the privilege to appear before you today to discuss threats to the electric grid in the United States. In the interest of time and pursuant to your request, I will skip over the section that details the E1, E2, and E3 threats. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The prepared statement of Mr. McClelland appears in the Appendix on page 62. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- My name is Joe McClelland, and I am the Director of the Office of Energy Infrastructure Security at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. I am here today as a Commission staff witness, and my remarks do not necessarily represent the views of the Commission or any individual Commissioner. Under Section 215 of the Federal Power Act, the Commission is entrusted with the responsibility to approve and enforce mandatory reliability standards for the Nation's bulk power system. These standards are developed and proposed by the North American Electrical Reliability Corporation. Section 215 of the Federal Power Act provides a statutory framework for the development of reliability standards for the bulk power system. However, the nature of a national security threat by entities intent on attacking the United States through its electric grid stands in stark contrast to other major reliability events that have caused blackouts and reliability failures in the past. Widespread disruption of electric service can quickly undermine the U.S. Government, its military, and the economy, as well as endanger the health and safety of millions of its citizens. Therefore, to provide a significantly more agile and focused approach to these growing cyber and physical security threats, the Commission established our office in late 2012. Our office's mission includes responses to geomagnetic disturbances and electromagnetic pulses. Just briefly, in 2001 Congress established a Commission to assess and report on the threat from EMP. In 2004 and again in 2008, the Commission issued reports on these threats. One of the key findings in the reports was that a single EMP attack could seriously degrade or shut down a large part of the electric power grid. Depending upon the attack, significant parts of electric infrastructure could be ``out of service for periods measured in months to a year or more.'' And some would say that is optimistic. In order to better understand and quantify the effect of EMP and GMD on the power grid, FERC staff, the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Department of Homeland Security, all three agencies, sponsored a single study conducted by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2010. The results of the study support the general conclusion of prior studies that EMP and GMD events pose substantial risk to equipment and operation of the Nation's electric grid and under extreme conditions could result in major long-term electrical outages. Unlike EMP attacks that are dependent upon the capability and intent of an attacker, GMD disturbances are inevitable with only the timing and magnitude subject to variability. The Oak Ridge study assessed a solar storm that occurred in May 1921, which has been termed a 1-in-100-year event, and applied it to today's electric grid. The study concluded that such a storm could damage or destroy over 300 high-voltage electric grid transformers and interrupt service to 130 million people with some outages lasting for a period of years. To help address these matters, the Commission has used both regulatory and collaborative actions. Under its regulator authority, the Commission ordered NERC to develop two GMD reliability standards for the bulk power system, requiring new operational procedures and vulnerability assessments. Under its collaborative programs, the Commission actively participates with Federal agencies and industry members to establish action plans, develop risk assessments that identify key energy facilities, and prioritize best practices that exceed regulatory requirements at those facilities for cyber and physical security matters, including both GMD and EMP. In addition, the Commission continues to facilitate threat briefings to industry members and cooperate with our international partners to compare ongoing initiatives. Internationally, over a dozen nations have GMD and/or EMP programs in place or are in the early stages of addressing or examining the impacts of GMD and EMP. For the United States, although GMD baseline standards and some best practices are being established for portions of the electric grid, few entities have taken steps to address EMP on their systems. In conclusion, these types of threats pose a serious risk to the electric grid and its supporting infrastructures that serve our Nation. Thank you for the opportunity to be here today, and I would be delighted to answer any questions you have. Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. McClelland. Our next witness is Dr. Richard Garwin. Dr. Garwin is a Fellow Emeritus at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, testifying in his personal capacity. He brings significant experience on issues related to electromagnetic pulse. In what is now the Los Alamos Laboratory, he outlined the first design for a hydrogen bomb and wrote the first paper on the electromagnetic pulse from nuclear explosions in the atmosphere. He has served as an adviser to the Federal Government for decades on national security issues, including by serving on the JASON Defense Advisory Board. He is a member of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, among other organizations, and he has received the Enrico Fermi Award, the R.V. Jones Award for Scientific Intelligence, and the National Medal of Science. Dr. Garwin, when we met earlier, I remembered reading a briefing that Enrico Fermi referred to you as one of the only true geniuses he had ever met, so I think that is pretty good praise from somebody that is also a genius. We are looking forward to your testimony. Dr. Garwin. TESTIMONY OF RICHARD L. GARWIN, PH.D.,\\1\\ FELLOW EMERITUS, IBM THOMAS J. WATSON RESEARCH CENTER Dr. Garwin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Actually, Ambassador Woolsey created the R.V. Jones Award, which was later awarded to me. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The prepared statement of Dr. Garwin appears in the Appendix on page 69. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The spectacular images of Pluto this week from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) New Horizons probe provoked great interest in our solar system. But our solar system is a matter for concern, as well. The 1,200 people injured in February 2013 at Chelyabinsk, Russia, from a bolide--a meteor--brought substantial focus on low-probability, high-consequence events. Among these are particularly intense magnetic storms from space--weather events or coronal mass ejections from the Sun, possibly even more intense than the 1859 Carrington Event in the pre-electric grid era. Another potentially great impact on the electrical grid and modern society is the electromagnetic pulse from high-altitude nuclear explosions, on the order of 100 kilometers or more above the Earth's surface. The United States has been a leader in long-distance transmission of electrical power, but its system differs in characteristics, management, and organization from those of other advanced States. Nevertheless, there is much to be learned from and by the United States in working to make our electrical grid robust and economical in the modern era of technological threats and opportunities. I begin with my recommendations to ease and essentially solve the severe problem posed by geomagnetic storms induced by space weather--specifically by the routine ejection from the sun of enormous blocks of plasma that travel out within the solar system and reach the Earth typically in a couple of days. Most of these coronal mass ejections do not reach the Earth. They go in other directions. When they do reach the Earth, they cause displays of the Northern Lights and Southern Lights, and, more importantly, the magnetized plasma and its incorporated magnetic field merge with the magnetic field of the Earth and change it by a relatively small amount, which, however, can create large currents on long electrical conductors such as pipelines, telegraph wires in the old days, and the electrical power transmission system--the Bulk Power System. Very serious consequences are estimated for such an event of a magnitude that can be expected to occur at random once per century. I emphasize that a once-per-century event might occur next week; it has a probability of 10 percent of occurring within the next 10 years--a time in which we can and should take measures to reduce and essentially eliminate its impact on the Bulk Power System of the United States. But events expected to occur once in 20 years can cause significant damage and disruption. My recommendations regarding the Bulk Power System: Missing in Federal policy and practice is a program to: One, train and equip utility and transmission operators to bring down within seconds--that is, to switch off--transmission lines that are at risk of being damaged; Two, implement ``rapid islanding'' of the grid, to maintain a large fraction of the power consumers in operation by the use of whatever island--that is, local--generation capacity exists; this also facilitates restoring the Bulk Power System to operation, in contrast with a so-called black start. Three, fit transmission lines on a priority basis with ``neutral current-blocking devices''--capacitors--in the common neutral-to-ground link of the three-phase transformers of extra-high-voltage transmission systems at one end of the line--whether three-phase transformers or three single-phase transformers. Where transformers at both ends are autotransformers, this may not be possible, in which case series-blocking capacitors in the power lines themselves should be installed and could be kept shorted until an EMP event is recognized, or a geomagnetic storm. Four, alert grid operators and others to a high-altitude nuclear explosion within thousandths of a second of the event (by detection of the unambiguous very brief E1 pulse). In my supplemental testimony submitted for the record, I provide support for these recommendations and explain why they would largely and immediately also eliminate long-lasting damage to the extra-high-voltage transmissions system that might otherwise result from a high-altitude nuclear explosion. So if we solve the problem that is sure to arise from space weather and geomagnetic storm, we will solve the long-distance transmission problem from high-altitude nuclear explosions, which may or may not arise. Those are also deterrable if they are from a place like North Korea or Iran, and, it is better to plan to deter them by means of our projected response, as well as to prevent damage from their happening. But those are two arms of the response. I should say that in 2011 I was a co-author of a study by the JASON group, ``Impacts of Severe Space Weather on the Electric Grid,'' and on pages 3 to 5 of that report, there are recommendations that include the ones I am giving now. Also, interestingly, there is the so-called E-PRO Handbook, the electric protection handbook, Executive Summary 2014 and International E-PRO Report of September 2013. That specifically advocates geomagnetic storm-induced current blockers, the neutral current ground interruptors, series capacitance in lines, reducing transformer loads, and real-time threshold- based transformer protection. Finally, I say that series-blocking capacitors in the power lines themselves are poorly understood. These are small devices, not like the enormous fields of transformers, of capacitors that are deployed for power--factor correction. But it is a little difficult to understand them because they have to be bigger in capacitance but smaller by a factor of 100 or 30 altogether because they have less energy storage, less mega- volt ampere ratings than the power factor correction. But maybe as a result of this hearing, they will get more attention. Thank you. Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Dr. Garwin. And that obviously is the purpose of this hearing. Our next witness is Mr. Chris Currie. Mr. Currie is a Director of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), where he leads the agency's work in evaluating emergency management, national preparedness, and critical infrastructure protection issues. In this role, Chris has led reviews of numerous Federal programs and efforts to prevent, plan for, and respond to natural and manmade disasters and terrorist attacks. Mr. Currie. TESTIMONY OF CHRISTOPHER P. CURRIE,\\1\\ DIRECTOR, HOMELAND SECURITY AND JUSTICE, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE Mr. Currie. Thank you, Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Carper and other Members that are here today. We appreciate the opportunity to be here today and testify. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The prepared statement of Mr. Currie appears in the Appendix on page 77. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Within the United States there are 16 critical infrastructure sectors, for example, water, transportation systems, agriculture, and, of course, energy. The energy sector ties all of these sectors together, and without it, the others just cannot function. This makes protecting it a national security priority. So I think the others on the panel have done a really good job of setting up the EMP and the solar weather threat. Both could cause power outages across large parts of the country for a long period of time. That threat was so great that Congress established a whole Commission on EMP in 2001, which issued reports in 2004 and 2008, and had many recommendations. GAO is currently evaluating the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to address EMP threats and electromagnetic threats in general, and today I would like to share our preliminary findings in two areas: the first is the extent to which DHS has addressed the 2008 EMP Commission recommendations; and the second is DHS' efforts to coordinate with other Federal agencies and industry stakeholders to mitigate risks to the electric grid. So far, we have found that DHS has taken some actions to mitigate the threats to the grid. These include developing mitigation projects and planning for the consequences of an event like an EMP, among other things. So two quick examples of these actions are: DHS is developing an R&D prototype transformer that would allow utilities to replace critical large transformers within a week, as opposed to the months it could take now, and it is currently testing that. Also, for example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is developing a specific Incident Annex to deal with a long-term power outage, and while this is not specific to electromagnetic threats, this plan would address one of the biggest side effects of an EMP or solar event. In regard to coordination, we have found so far that DHS has coordinated with stakeholders to address some but not all risks to the electric grid. Some of these actions address electromagnetic threats. For example, DHS participates in interagency working groups that are designed to prepare and respond to space weather events. However, our preliminary work shows that DHS has not fully coordinated with stakeholders in areas like sharing threat information, identifying key infrastructure assets, and identifying research priorities, just as examples. So, for example, within those areas, energy industry officials told us that they lack sufficient threat information to determine if they should take actions to mitigate against an EMP. They also said that this information would help them justify these investments to their management and shareholders. And this is similar to our past work and recommendations related to cyber threats. In that work, we found that Federal agencies' efforts to share information did not always meet industry expectations, in part because of restrictions on information that can be shared. And DHS has since taken steps to implement those recommendations in that area, including granting security clearances and establishing a secure mechanism to share cyber threat information. In another example, we have found that DHS and the Department of Energy have not identified the most critical energy substations and transformers on the grid. This was a key recommendation of the EMP Commission, and this information would help prioritize investments to mitigate against the largest vulnerabilities. There are a couple final and overarching points I would like to make based on our work. First, while DHS has taken some actions, as I have mentioned, there has been no integrated effort to address the EMP Commission recommendations. In fact, we have seen some confusion within DHS about who is responsible for taking lead on this. Second, although DHS is not required by law to implement the Commission's recommendations, many of the recommendations align with responsibilities that DHS and DOE already have for protecting critical infrastructure and coordinating these efforts, such as under the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. For example, DHS and DOE have not identified roles and responsibilities for addressing electromagnetic impacts to the grid. As we complete our review, we will continue to evaluate the extent that DHS has implemented the EMP Commission recommendations and determine where specific coordination efforts could be improved, and we expect to issue our final report later this year. This completes my prepared remarks, and I would be happy to answer any questions you have. Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Currie. Our final witness is Ms. Bridgette Bourge. Ms. Bourge is a senior principal for legislative affairs at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), where she leads the work on homeland security policy issues. She previously served as a consultant to the Department of Homeland Security on critical infrastructure issues. Ms. Bourge. TESTIMONY OF BRIDGETTE BOURGE,\\1\\ SENIOR PRINCIPAL, LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS, NATIONAL RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION Ms. Bourge. Thank you. It is an honor to be here to testify today on behalf of the industry about the threat of solar storms and electromagnetic pulses on the bulk power system. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The prepared statement of Ms. Bourge appears in the Appendix on page 97. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As the Chairman mentioned, I do work for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. I advocate for best security practices that recognize the reality of the threat environments on behalf of a service organization that serves over 900 not- for-profit electric utilities providing reliable power to over 42 million people in 47 States. As member-owned, not-for-profit utilities, electric cooperatives focus on providing reliable electricity at the lowest reasonable cost. Anything that undermines that mandate undermines our members. Our member owners bear every cost. There is never any debate over whether a proposed project benefits cooperative stakeholders or cooperative customers. They are one and the same. I am not going to get into defining EMPs or GMDs. I think we have gone into that quite a bit here. I do want to stress, though, that we are a little concerned that there is some misinformation out there that fails to reflect the reality and factual danger of either phenomenon. These two are entirely separate threats, both in nature and in execution, with different causations and impacts. Yet they are, nevertheless, regularly conflated as the same. GMDs are common, relatively common natural events that can result from a solar storm. We actually had a few weeks ago a 3- day occurrence of GMDs at a G3 level. You saw no impact from the bulk power system. You felt nothing from that. We have standards and processes in place to address the GMDs at those levels. As you heard from Mr. McClelland, we are in the process of waiting on an additional set of standards that will help us plan for the 100-year event scenario. So industry does address the GMD. We are aware of that issue and highly engaged on that issue, and we are continuing to address that issue. Electromagnetic pulses from a nuclear detonation are a little different, from our perspective. They require a different technology solution. They also require different planning, different mitigation, different preparation. I would actually like to read from the EMP Commission here where it says, ``It is not practical to try to protect the entire electrical power system or even all high-value components from damage by an EMP event. There are too many components of too many different types, manufacturers, ages, and designs. The cost and time would be prohibitive. Widespread collapse of the electrical power system in the area affected by EMP is virtually inevitable after a broad geographic EMP attack, with even a modest number of unprotected components.'' So basically the EMP Commission even had the same view of protecting the grid will not guarantee the grid stays up. So we have to look at this, separate the issues. A GMD is a solar storm. It is something we do work on, we do address. EMPs are something we also address through policy and planning, not so much through the technology solution, because we do not see it as something we can guarantee survival on. We do try to protect it, and we do want to look toward planning scenarios so that we can recover from it. When you hear people talk about spare transformers, that is an idea that we think is very valuable and should be looked at most certainly. And you see some bills actually over in the House proposing that type of concept, and the Department of Energy, I believe, just recently put out a request for information on how they might be able to do such a thing. That is an area of focus where industry thinks that we would be very beneficial to turn toward. We have to remember when you are conflating the EMPs and GMDs, you have the chance of impacting existing standards, existing processes, existing mitigation efforts. GMDs are something that impacts the electric grid. It is something that impacts communications systems. EMPs are something that impacts all critical infrastructure. If you have a microprocessor, more than likely you are going to feel an impact. You are going to have an impact on our hospitals, on our transportation, on our fuel lines. These are interdependent critical infrastructures. They rely on us, but we also rely on them. If we have no fuel, if we have no water to cool, we will not function. So when you say everyone else needs electricity to work, electricity needs others to work as well. So simply finding a way to harden a grid that will, per the EMP Commission, still likely come down, when no one else is hardened, when we still will fail because there are no protections anywhere else does not seem like the best focus of our energy and time. We want to focus on that recovery scenario for the low-likelihood, high- impact events like an EMP, which we do see as distinctly different than the GMD. That is the conclusion of my testimony. If anyone has any questions, I would be happy to answer them. Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Ms. Bourge. I will start the questioning, but before I start the clock, I did a pretty good job of convincing all the panel members not to describe E1, E2, E3, and GMD, so nobody did. So I guess what I would like to do is I think Mr. McClelland might be the best person to, please just kind of walk us through really what we are talking about here, because it is, EMP is different from the GMD, although there are certainly similarities in terms of some of the effects on some of it. So if you would just kind of educate us on that, and then I will start asking questions. Mr. McClelland. Sure. Mr. Chairman, I will read, because I have summarized it very succinctly, and I think comprehensively. So within a paragraph, I think I can address it here at your request. Chairman Johnson. Thank you. Mr. McClelland. GMD and EMP events are generated either from naturally occurring or manmade causes. In the case of geomagnetic disturbances, or GMDs, solar magnetic disturbances periodically disrupt the Earth's magnetic field, which in turn can induce currents on the electric grid that can damage or destroy key transformers over a large geographic area. Regarding manmade events, EMPs can be generated by devices that range from small, portable, battery-powered units through missiles equipped with nuclear warheads. In the case of the former--the battery-powered units--the equipment is readily available that can generate localized high-energy bursts designed to disrupt, damage, or destroy electronics such as those found in control systems on the electric grid. The EMP generated during the detonation of a nuclear device is far more encompassing and generates three distinct effects: a short high energy radio-frequency-type burst called E1 that destroys electronics; a slightly longer burst that is similar to lightning termed E2; and a final effect termed E3 that is similar in character and effect to the GMD targeting the same equipment including key transformers. Any of these effects can cause voltage problems and instability on the electric grid, which can lead to prolonged wide-area blackouts. So the key distinction between the two, geomagnetic disturbances and we will go with the nuclear because it covers the range--the nuclear EMP is that nuclear EMP generates two other effects: E1, which damages and destroys electronics; E2, which is similar to lightning, and the common belief in the community is that E2 has been mitigated or is readily mitigated by the lightning practices of the utilities today; and then E3, which is a longer-term effect which generates those geomagnetically induced type currents that destroy key pieces of transformers. So if you mitigate against GMD, you have mitigated really against everything but E1, the E1 effect from a nuclear detonation. Chairman Johnson. Let me just ask the open question: Does anybody disagree with that basic description? Or would you want to tweak it in some way? Ambassador Woolsey. Mr. Woolsey. I do not disagree. Most of what I know about these issues I have learned from Joe McClelland. But I want to stress that the EMP Commission did not--repeat, not--conclude that it is futile to protect the grid. The Commission recommended protecting the grid in such a way that it would fail gracefully, essentially, so it could be quickly recovered. But the industry across the board has gotten very, very good at pointing the finger at other parts---- Chairman Johnson. And, again, we will get into that discussion. Mr. Woolsey. All right. Chairman Johnson. Again, right now I just want to lay the predicate in terms of this is what we are talking about. Mr. Woolsey. Got it. Chairman Johnson. E1, E2, E3, EMP versus GMD, and GMD and EMP with the E3 that is a similar effect. OK. I just wanted to get--and I also did want to--you talked about a G3 level happening all the time. What would be the level of the 100-year event or the Carrington Effect? What is that on the scale? Anybody? Mr. McClelland. That is going to be like a K8, K9 effect, and we have not seen one. So we have not seen a 1921 level effect. We have seen two others, and they are very interesting. One is in 1989. We saw about a half of a 1921 event, and it collapsed the grid of Canada. The Quebec grid collapsed very quickly. We also saw a fraction of that event in South Africa in October 2003 that destroyed over 12 large bulk power system transformers. It was very small, so it did not collapse the grid, but it was off for a prolonged period of time, destroyed that critical equipment at a very low level. Chairman Johnson. OK. So you had the Carrington Effect, which was, what, 1859? Mr. McClelland. 1859. Chairman Johnson. And that in this G-scale would be a G8 or G9? Mr. McClelland. Well, I would say K9. Chairman Johnson. OK, K9. Again, not that this really means anything to anybody, but it just kind of gives order of magnitude. So you had the Carrington Effect, which was kind of once in a century, but that has been 150 years. Then we had the 1921 event, what would that have been on that scale? Mr. McClelland. I have the nanoteslas, but as far as relating it to the K-factor, I am sorry, I would not be able to answer that question here. Chairman Johnson. Way more than a G3, though? Mr. McClelland. Yes. Chairman Johnson. How about on a scale of 1 to 10? I am just trying to get some sort of idea of the magnitude of these things, from a Carrington to what we are seeing, almost background noise, but this is happening all the time. And we have all seen disruptions to TV signals, satellite signals, that type of thing, but kind of the minor annoyances. I think it is also true that Lloyd's of London says that on average there is about $2 billion worth of damage from these G3 types of effects annually. Again, so Carrington was massive; 1921 was not quite as massive as the Carrington Effect. Correct? Mr. McClelland. Right. Chairman Johnson. The next one was in Canada? Mr. McClelland. Yes, in 1989. Chairman Johnson. In 1989. Do you have that on a scale? Mr. McClelland. I do. I can pull it up for you. If the 1921 event was 5,000 nanoteslas, the Canadian event was about 1,100 or 1,200 nanoteslas, so about a fifth. I would say about a fifth. Chairman Johnson. It was a fifth of the 1921 event, and it shut down all of Canada's electrical grid? Mr. McClelland. It shut down Hydroelectric of Quebec, the entire Quebec grid, shut down in 93 seconds; 6 million customers were out of power for about 10 hours. The estimated cost, I have heard cost estimates of $1 to $2 billion, but very minor equipment damage. So they were able to restore very quickly, but still the cost was very significant. Chairman Johnson. But a fifth the size of the 1921 event, which smaller than or less intense than the Carrington Effect. Mr. McClelland. Right. Chairman Johnson. And then the last one was, you said, in South Africa? Mr. McClelland. Right. That was the South African event. Again, in orders of magnitude, that was probably about half to a quarter of the Canadian event. It was a very low level event, but it stayed on for a period of days. The grid did not collapse. It did not cause consumption, overconsumption, reactive power flow. So the grid stayed on. Equipment saw prolonged exposure to this event, and months later, over a period of months, 12 transformers were lost due to that event. Chairman Johnson. Then it was true that in 2012 there was a coronal discharge or a solar flare, whatever we want to call it, that was pretty massive. Dr. Garwin, can you comment on that? Mr. Garwin. No. Chairman Johnson. OK. Mr. Garwin. Some of these things are not really on an appropriate scale because, activity on the Sun is not necessarily reflected in a geomagnetic event on the Earth. It depends on the polarity of the plasma that is ejected. And many of the things that happen on the Sun are spectacular, but their coronal mass ejections go in different directions. Chairman Johnson. OK. I saw a satellite picture of us missing this by about 9 days. Anybody know anything about this and can comment on it? Ambassador Woolsey. Mr. Woolsey. I just got tipped from my friend who is the Chairman or the Staff Director of the EMP Commission, and he tells me that on July 23, 2012, there was a Carrington-level event. It missed us by 3 days. Mr. Garwin. That means it just went off in a different direction. Chairman Johnson. Correct, but had the Earth been in its-- had it affected the Earth, it is going to only--does it only affect the side facing the Earth? Mr. Garwin. No, the entire Earth, especially the polar regions, but even down into the mid-latitudes Carrington--the only long wires in those days were telegraph wires. Chairman Johnson. Right. Mr. Garwin. So no grid to bring down, no pipelines, but it did play havoc with telegraph wires, burned up some telegraph offices, and it would be much worse. It would collapse societies. But if the transformers are off, they are not damaged, and so the worst that would happen, if you take proper preparations, is that you would have to turn off transformers which have not been sufficiently mitigated. But the ones that have been mitigated or which do not have the connections that make them vulnerable--so-called Y connections instead are delta connections, which work just as well--those are immune to geomagnetic storms. Chairman Johnson. Go ahead. Mr. McClelland. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman. To answer your question, because I do have the numbers here, the July 2012 event was about a quarter or about 25 percent of the size of the 1921 event. The 1989 event that collapsed the Quebec grid was about a tenth of the size of the 1921 event. And the event is called ``the Halloween Storm of 2003 for South Africa.'' That was about a 50th of the size of the 1921 event. And I do have those numbers and can provide that information. Chairman Johnson. But, again, the granddaddy of them all was the Carrington in terms of our history that we have witnessed. Do you have any kind of relationship to that? Mr. McClelland. I am sorry. I do not have that information. Chairman Johnson. But bigger than 1921? Mr. McClelland. Yes, bigger. Chairman Johnson. Ambassador Woolsey. Mr. Woolsey. Joe or Dick could correct me if I am wrong, but 1921 affected, I think, North America only; whereas, the Carrington Event of 1859 affected the entire world. Chairman Johnson. OK. Ms. Bourge, again you are making a distinction between EMP and GMD and to a certain extent implying that, boy, there is just not much we can do about EMPs, so, you know---- Ms. Bourge. Well, I certainly do not mean to be implying there is not much we can do about EMPs. I think planning and talking at a national level across the critical infrastructure in identifying interdependencies, figuring out where government can help industry and where industry can help industry and what are the most logical ways to go about addressing this low- likelihood, high-impact situation, as we would with many others. Whenever you are talking about a catastrophic situation, sometimes protection and mitigation has to be looked at, but so does recovery. And you have to balance how much effort should be put on ahead of time and how much effort should be put on that recovery situation instead. Chairman Johnson. Dr. Garwin, you have made four recommendations. Have you ever seen any kind of cost estimate of what it would cost to implement your recommendations? Mr. Garwin. The EMP Commission has those $2 billion. They do not exactly align with these recommendations. But the neutral current-blocking device which solves the problem on the EHB, the bulk transmission system, those might cost about $100,000 per transformer. That is cheap compared with the several million dollars per transformer, and it is very cheap compared with the damages that would be avoided. Chairman Johnson. Do you know how many transformers would have to be protected? Mr. Garwin. A couple hundred in a priority---- Chairman Johnson. Literally, $100,000 times a couple hundred? Mr. Garwin. Yes, that is right. You know, $100,000, that is---- Chairman Johnson. That does not even show up in the Federal budget. That is pocket change. Mr. Garwin. Right. But we do not have the census. We do not have from the transmission companies the details as to which transformers are most vulnerable, so we do not know where to start. Chairman Johnson. So we have not even done that, which 200 transformers should have $100,000 worth of protection? Mr. Garwin. Yes, and there are some that will not help because they are autotransformers, and so you cannot separate their ground---- Chairman Johnson. Mr. McClelland, you---- Mr. McClelland. I am sorry. I guess it really does depend-- the substation number does depend on the outcome that one is pursuing. If it is grid stability and continuity, then it is a small, relatively small number of substations. So 55,000 critical substations, as Dr. Garwin has indicated, would number in the hundreds. If, however, it is to preserve the integrity of the Department of Defense or the offsite power supply to nuclear power stations, then criticality of load becomes an important issue. In that case, you may escalate from a few hundred to a thousand or more substations. In addition, it is important to state that Dr. Garwin I think focused on just one aspect, geomagnetic disturbance. Electromagnetic pulse requires E1 hardening, too, and---- Chairman Johnson. I understand. So the point being is let us not make perfect the enemy of the good. Let us not sit back and go, ``Well, if you cannot protect everything, protect nothing.'' Let us start protecting things. Mr. McClelland. Right. Chairman Johnson. Literally, $100,000 times 200, was it? What is the math on that? I made a mistake earlier. I need a calculator. It is not much. Somebody described the Commission is established, starting in 2004 when we declassified what we knew dating back to the 1960s, right, when we were doing nuclear testing and we realized, whoa, something pretty strange is happening or something pretty damaging, and we classified that. We declassified in 2004, correct? And we set up a Commission--this is for Dr. Garwin. Mr. Garwin. No. It was long before. It was recognized in 1962 by a high-altitude nuclear test. It was explained a couple years later, never was classified. The only thing that is classified is the details of the construction of the nuclear weapons that caused this. Chairman Johnson. So it was just ignored. It was something pretty scary, and we did not want to acknowledge it, so we put our head in the sand, and our head is still in the sand, by and large. Mr. Garwin. Well, people tried and, of course---- Chairman Johnson. I am not blaming you. I am just saying that is the position---- Mr. Garwin [continuing]. And the EMP Commission has been trying, but here is what the EMP Commission said, if you look on page 6 of my submittal for the record. So E1, this very sharp pulse that has no counterpart in a natural phenomenon, does not affect people, no direct harm to humans or animals, gasoline-fueled automobiles, 3 stopped running out of 37, but all restarted without incident, and then, in particular, the electrical grid. But Ms. Bourge is right. The country runs on other than electricity, and so you have to protect more than the electrical grid. But our subject is the electrical grid, and to protect the electrical grid even against E1 is not the big problem that protecting all of society is. So electromagnetic relays that send current and voltage were immune to E1, and the electronic protective relays, they were the toughest devices tested, and they could be even tougher, according to the EMP Commission, with minor filtering on them. So it is something that is doable, is to protect the bulk power system not only against the geomagnetic storms and against E3 from high-altitude nuclear explosions, but also against E1. That would not solve the problem of society because we depend upon a lot of other things. And if all of our furnaces and water pumps and so on go out because of the personal computer type things that are used in them, that is a bad day. Chairman Johnson. But we can protect ourselves against something like the Carrington Effect, the 1921 effect, and we can do that for a relatively low cost. And, again, it is something that has a 10 to 12 percent probability of happening every decade, and we escaped something massive by a couple days in 2012. Am I stating that correctly? Mr. McClelland. Yes. Mr. Woolsey. Yes. [Witnesses nod in agreement.] Chairman Johnson. So, again, let us go back to 2008, and I want to start with you, Mr. Currie. I am going to go through Recommendations A through O of the 2008 EMP Commission, and I really want just a simple yes or no on these. Have we done this? OK? Do we understand the system network level vulnerabilities, including cascading effects? Do we understand that? Has DHS done that? Mr. Currie. No, DHS has not done that. Chairman Johnson. So we do not even understand the system or network level vulnerabilities, including cascading effects? Mr. Currie. Not for geomagnetic threats. No, DHS has not done that. Chairman Johnson. OK. Well, that was the first recommendation. So, again, this is in 2008, and now it is 2015, and I can actually do that math in my head. That is 7 years. OK. B, Evaluate and implement quick fixes. Mr. Currie. They are evaluating some quick fixes, like the project I mentioned, the transformer quick fix project, and that is---- Chairman Johnson. So do you think seven--I am not beating up on you. Seven years later, that is not exactly a quick evaluation of a quick fix, is it? Mr. Currie. Right. Chairman Johnson. So we still have not done that. We are kind of evaluating it. Seven years to evaluate a quick fix that could cost minimal dollars, that would go a long way toward protecting the absolute critical substations and transformers of an effect that we know will happen again with 100 percent certainty, right, Dr. Garwin? We will be hit by one of these solar flares with 100 percent certainty? Mr. Garwin. Right. Chairman Johnson. Sometime in the future. Mr. Garwin. Right. Chairman Johnson. We have known about this publicly since 2004. In 2008, these recommendations. Seven years later, we have virtually done nothing in terms of some quick fixes that would cost $100,000 per transformer--when, by the way, we spent $800 billion in 2009 and 2010 on a stimulus package looking for shovel-ready projects. This would have been a pretty good shovel-ready project, wouldn't it? Mr. Garwin. Well, the criterion was too severe because it takes longer than a year to go from something which is there actually to get it running. You have all that planning and budgeting, and it should have lasted longer, and we should have fixed our infrastructure more widely. Mr. Currie. Senator Johnson, can I mention one thing? Chairman Johnson. Sure, Mr. Currie. Mr. Currie. One of the things that makes it hard--and this has made our work really hard--is there is no one at DHS that sort of line by line tracks what efforts coincide with these recommendations. Chairman Johnson. No, I will stipulate the dysfunction with government, OK? And, again, we are describing dysfunction. This is a serious threat; 100 percent certainty this will happen, and we have done nothing, having known about this publicly since 2004, we have done nothing. We have spent minimal amounts of dollars on a quick fix to protect a big chunk of our iron structure. Not perfect, not protecting everything, but just doing the bare minimum, we have done nothing. Let me go on. C, have we developed national and regional restoration plans? Yes or no. Mr. Currie. According to our work, DHS has not done that. There may have been discussions about that in the Sector Coordinating Council. Chairman Johnson. So 7 years later, we have not developed national and regional restoration plans. By the way, if anybody wants to challenge this, pipe in. We have plenty of time. I am the only questioner, which is kind of nice. Ms. Bourge. Chairman Johnson---- Chairman Johnson. I wish every member of the Committee were here to hear this, though. It is unfortunate they are not. But, again, if anybody wants to challenge this, step in. Do you want to say--have we developed a national or regional restoration plan? Ms. Bourge. Actually, I want to go one back from there. I want to talk about whether or not we have done nothing, because I think the issue got a little conflated here on the EMP versus GMD. Industry has done things on GMDs. We have standards implemented. We are in the process of pending approval from FERC on a second set of standards to build toward the 100-year event. Chairman Johnson. Have we installed anything? Have we actually protected anything? So industry, great, God bless you, I love industry. So industry has done some studying. The government has not. Ms. Bourge. I could not say what DHS has done specifically or not. Chairman Johnson. That is why we have GAO here, and he said government has not done anything. So God bless industry. I am glad you are moving forward. We should start installing some of these things. D, have we assured the availability of replacement equipment. Have we done that? Mr. Currie. No. It is being researched, but there is no assurance. Chairman Johnson. Ah, research. Love research. Some of these transformers are 2 years out in terms of lead time, correct? Mr. Woolsey. Yes. Chairman Johnson. Two years out. Mr. Woolsey. And the last time I looked, Mr. Chairman, they were made only in--the big ones, only in South Korea and Germany. Chairman Johnson. So anybody with a brain in their head looking at this would go, what we ought to do--again, we are going to spend $800 billion looking for shovel-ready projects and shovel about $2 billion into some replacement transformers and just keeping the spare parts. Wouldn't that have been a rational response, take $2 billion and buy a bunch of transformers and store them so that we can restore power from that---- Mr. Woolsey. Some transformers are not fungible. You cannot just take one and put--but people here who know more about that---- Chairman Johnson. That would, of course, require some research and some planning, which we did not do that either. So let me keep going on. Mr. Garwin. As they say, the good is the enemy of---- Chairman Johnson. No. The perfect is the enemy of the good, I know. And just government does not work, and I think this is pretty obvious. Mr. Garwin. You can make replacement transformers that are modular and stack them up, and that is a good way to do it. But it is very difficult to get people to agree on a particular course. And in industry and commerce, you have competition, so people buy what is most effective and what---- Chairman Johnson. Right, and, of course, the point of this hearing is to lay bare how ridiculous it is that we have done nothing, and we have let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and we have allowed governmental dysfunction to prevent us from even doing the basic first little quick fixes to begin protecting our critical infrastructure. That is the purpose of this hearing. Let me go on. E, assure availability of critical communications channels. Have we done that, Mr. Currie? Mr. Currie. So we focus on the energy sector, and one thing that was not mentioned is that the EMP Commission report actually covered other sectors, like telecommunications and banking and finance and raised threats in those areas, too. I do not have knowledge of the communications area. Chairman Johnson. Well, again, and I agree with your assessment in your testimony, too. We have 16 critical infrastructures, and they all depend on energy. So, again, we are trying to prioritize what you are trying to address--again, not going to solve all of them. In other words, do nothing, so try and start solving something. The top priority would be protect our electrical infrastructure, correct? F, expand and extend emergency power supplies. Have we done that? Mr. Currie. That is not something we have looked at as DHS because they would not be responsible. Chairman Johnson. I will take that as a no. Extend black start capability. Mr. Currie. It is something that they have looked at as their research and development for installing these transformers that can be easily replaced, but I am not aware of---- Chairman Johnson. So looked at it. Then that would be what we would have to do. Pre-purchasing some of these replacement transformers is really what we are talking about, right? And getting those in a position so that we do not have to rely on transportation to put them in service. Mr. McClelland. Mr. McClelland. If you do not mind, Mr. Chairman, I would like to revisit just a couple---- Chairman Johnson. Sure. Mr. McClelland. Not from the DHS perspective, but from FERC's perspective. Regarding item No. 1, identify critical facilities, the Commission did finish comprehensive network modeling, has identified the most critical substations and nodes on the electric power grid, conveyed that information to the industry, and then offered assistance. And this is in conjunction with DOE and DHS, so they were our partners on this. We did collaborate, so we have identified those critical nodes, met with the subject matter experts who own and operate those critical nodes, and offered assistance, joint assistance for cybersecurity with DHS and also assistance on both GMD and EMP mitigation procedures and techniques. We have also collaborated with our partners at the Department of Defense (DOD) to identify mission-critical facilities and essentially perform the same function for our partners at DOD. So work has been done. I cannot speak to independent efforts by DHS. The work was not specifically driven by GMD and EMP. It was driven in the threat context and used for both cyber GMD and EMP. On the second item, I do not want to overrepresent it. I think it is important to say that the NERC standards are a baseline approach, so they are a foundational approach. They are certainly not best practices, and they certainly would not represent best practices that the industry could bring to bear. However, NERC did put operating procedures in place so that when they receive alerts and bulletins from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) folks regarding space weather events, they are given an alert, and they can take operational action. That is just operational action, though. It does depend on human beings to actuate procedures in order to protect the system. There is a second phase of that standard. The second phase of that standard regards a self-assessment by the industry to determine whether or not they need to take protective measures, automatic protective measures against GMD. And the Commission has questioned some of the aspects of that standard in regards to the 1-in-100-year event and the baseline that NERC submitted for the Commission's review. Chairman Johnson. OK. So that is good news. I would have assumed we would have been looking at this. I am sure there is, with all the paper being produced around here, there are some studies. We need to start implementing some protections, though, and prioritizing those things. Ambassador Woolsey. Mr. Woolsey. Mr. Chairman, just one illustration. It takes NERC sometimes quite a while to come up with these standards. In 2003, after the Great Northeast Blackout in Canada--and it started, I think, in Cleveland, with a tree branch touching a wire--NERC undertook a Vegetation Management Plan. It took them slightly over 10 years, until 2013, to come up with that. The United States was engaged in World War II for 3 years and 8 months, so that is essentially three World War II's that it took NERC to figure out what to do with vegetation. I do not know how long it took them to handle a much more complex problem, like, say, squirrels. Ms. Bourge. Mr. Chairman, if I could add one thing---- Chairman Johnson. Squirrels are a 100 percent probability as well. [Laughter.] Ms. Bourge. The NERC process has been changing and growing and establishing itself over the years, and that was more in its infancy. At this point we have gotten better with standards. I am not going to say we are perfect, but we have gotten better in the process of getting them done, and for an example, we had a request from FERC to create physical security standards last year, and we did that, I believe, in 82 days. Chairman Johnson. Again, this is a different example, but I know the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has established standards in case the Ebola virus ever came to the United States, and the first time it happened, we had some young nurses contract Ebola because--again, you can write up standards, but if you do not test it, if you do not actually have the protective gown and equipment in place, the standards, the piece of paper does nothing. Let me just continue, because I just want to--and, again, anybody can answer this. If it is yes or no or, maybe or partially, let me know. Prioritize and protect critical nodes. Have we prioritized and protected critical notes? Mr. McClelland. Mr. McClelland. The studies that FERC has performed do prioritize the critical nodes for the industry. Chairman Johnson. So we prioritized but no protection. Mr. McClelland. No, the protection is voluntary. There is no EMP standard, and the Commission has said on numerous occasions that for national security the standards are not adequate. Chairman Johnson. OK. So, listen, I am somebody who hates overreaching government, overregulation. But let us face it: Voluntary is not working so good. From my standpoint, this is something that needs to be addressed, and if government has to pay for it, again, that is why I go back to the old stimulus, $800 billion, we could have done a lot of protection with just a small little fraction of that, and it is just a shame, it is just unconscionable we did not. Mr. McClelland. I can just add to that quickly. We have seen just a handful of utilities move forward with EMP mitigation. One or two have been very proactive. The cost for both GMD and EMP mitigation at those stations is relatively small. It has been 1 to 2 percent--for EMP mitigation included. Chairman Johnson. When the administration in 2009 was looking for those shovel-ready projects, did NERC ever raise its hand and say, ``We have one here''? Mr. McClelland. I do not know. Chairman Johnson. I wish they would have. Mr. Woolsey. Not to my knowledge, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Garwin. There is a generic problem in the government, as evidenced by our late friend Jim Schlesinger when he was Secretary of Defense. They needed a fiscal stimulus, and Schlesinger came up with $5 billion to be spent. He said, ``We do not need it for defense, but I am the only one in the government, the only Cabinet Secretary, allowed to have contingency plans for spending money we do not have.'' And so we spent that $5 billion on defense. Schlesinger said we did not need it, but it was a good thing to do, according to the administration and the Congress. We ought to have contingency plans lined up for things that we do not have money to do, and you have to be able to say no to them to stay within the budget. Chairman Johnson. Well, again, the purpose of this hearing is to raise this issue, this contingency and a real high--this is not a contingency. This is an imperative. This is a top priority from my standpoint. I, Expand and assure intelligent islanding capability. Dr. Garwin, that was part of your testimony. Have we done anything there? Mr. Garwin. I do not know. Chairman Johnson. Mr. McClelland. Mr. McClelland. I would say not, no. Chairman Johnson. OK. Assure protection of high-value generation assets. [No response.] No? Correct? I guess we will just assume no unless somebody wants to--OK. Assure protection of high-value transmissions assets. [No response.] No. Assure sufficient numbers of adequately trained recovery personnel. Have we done that one? [No response.] No. Simulate, train, exercise, and test the recovery plan. Have we done that? [No response.] No, we have not done that. Develop and deploy system test standards and equipment. [No response.] Have not done that. The final one, you can all breathe easy now, establish installation standards. [No response.] So this is pretty remarkable. From 2008, we had all these recommendations, seems like pretty common-sense recommendations, things that responsible individuals would have hopped right on and said, ``This is a problem, this is a threat, this needs to be addressed, this is a priority.'' And we have virtually done very little. We have done some. We have done some studies. We need to start using those studies. We are, by the way, going to be introducing a piece of legislation--and I have it here somewhere. Oh, I know. This passed in the House. One of the reasons we are holding this hearing now is I wanted the House to move first. It is called the ``Critical Infrastructure Protection Act.'' To me, this is just bare minimum. And it was amazing to me. Ambassador Woolsey, can you describe the problems we had even passing this in the House? It is going to require DHS to prepare a strategy to protect critical infrastructure against electromagnetic threats. Mr. Woolsey. I think this is the one that go through the House and was stopped in the Senate--Peter Pry has followed the legislation on this more closely, if we can ask him, former Chief of Staff of---- Chairman Johnson. Sure. Why don't you come forward? I will let you provide the information without being sworn in. Mr. Woolsey. Progress, particularly in the House, of CIPA. Mr. Pry. Well, it was passed in the House, but like in the last week of the last Congress. It passed unanimously, as a matter of fact, but we just ran out of time. I think the bills you are thinking about are the SHIELD Act and the GRID Act which were held up for years in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. One of them, the GRID Act, did pass the House unanimously in 2010, and it came over to the Senate. But one Senator anonymously put a hold on the bill, and then it died. And that is the closest we came. Chairman Johnson. I actually was going to get to the SHIELD and GRID Acts. Right now we are just talking about CIPA, because I think the House--is it Homeland Security?--has actually reported out of Committee, and hopefully the House will pass it. And I want to bring this up and report it out of our Committee as well, and it is one of the reasons I held this hearing, was to get Committee support for just a bare minimum. Again, this is sort of a study as well. But we need to move past studies as quickly as possible and develop a strategy and start implementing it real quick. And I think some of these things we are talking about here, the $100,000 for some of these critical transformers, I do not think we need a strategy or a study. I think we should just do it, quite honestly. I will amend this bill to authorize the dollars to do just that. Mr. Garwin. One problem is that some of these remedies are so cheap, so that is the reproduction cost. But the design, the test, that costs really a lot of money, and then you put it into production. But you have to decide what it is you put into production. So that is why there has not been a lot of supply- industry interest in this, because the market is not all that big. Chairman Johnson. Mr. Currie, do you want a quick---- Mr. Currie. Yes, sir. On the cost issue, one of the things that we are looking at--when we talk about this, we tend to talk about just replacing existing equipment now. Another option that is easier and cheaper is, as you redesign systems, as they need natural replacement, that you consider hardening in this, too, which can be cheaper and easier to do as well. Chairman Johnson. That is fine. But, again, that is replacing. That is further out in the future. Let us take a look at what we have now. Let us address that. Let us offer some protection now. I think I will yield back my time remaining, my 7 minutes here. [Laughter.] Senator Carper. I will say you have made the most of it. Chairman Johnson. I have it right here. It says all 7 minutes, so I have not even begun. I will say I wish we have had really good attendance at these hearings, and this is probably the least attended hearing, and it is unfortunate. I will ask---- Senator Carper. They are all waiting in the anteroom until you finish. Chairman Johnson. I will ask that you review what has already been stated here, Senator Carper. This is unbelievable. It is just unbelievable. So if you have an opening statement, I am happy to have you make it now. But I really want you to review the testimony, and I want you to review the initial questioning here, and what we have not done is pretty jaw- dropping and how little it is going to cost to just offer some basic protection, this is something we need to prioritize. We need to get moving on this now. But why don't you make your opening statement? Then we will continue on with questions. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CARPER Senator Carper. OK. Thanks. I apologize to our witnesses. First, my train was running about an hour and a half late. That is enough of a trouble. And the Northeast corridor was shut down for a while. And I got here, and I got distracted on another big issue that we are facing in the Senate today. But, Mr. Chairman, thanks very much for holding this hearing, and thanks to our witnesses as well for joining us. Threats to the homeland have evolved, as we all know, considerably over the last 15 years. In the months after 9/11, the most pressing threat to our homeland came from al-Qaeda terrorists planning attacks from remote caves in Afghanistan. Today the terror threat has become far more diverse. Some terror groups are still seeking sophisticated attacks against high-profile targets. Other groups, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), are attempting to inspire extremists all over the world--including right here in the United States--to carry out simple attacks within their own communities, sometimes lethal attacks. We are also being attacked daily in cyberspace. In many ways, we are dealing with an epidemic of online theft and fraud. This epidemic is growing at an alarming rate and touches many of the people in this room, including on this side of the dais, as attacks become more sophisticated and more disruptive. And the challenges we faced with the recent Ebola outbreak and our ongoing efforts to counter the spread of avian influenza remind us that threats to our homeland are not just manmade. To address these evolving threats, we must always look to stay at least one step ahead of the bad guys or, in some cases, Mother Nature. At the same time, we have to reluctantly accept the reality that our Nation cannot protect against every threat, or potential threat, out there. Though we should always strive for perfection, we simply do not have the resources to achieve 100 percent security all of the time. I know that, and I think we all recognize that. That is why it is so critical that we prioritize our homeland defenses. We must focus on those threats that our experience and intelligence tell us are most likely to occur and would have the gravest effects if, God forbid, they should become a reality. Today's hearing gives us an opportunity to assess two different potential threats to our electrical grid: man-made electromagnetic pulses, and geomagnetic disturbances caused by space weather. Each of these threats poses some degree of risk to our communities. That much is clear. Our job, however, is to assess that risk and figure out where these threats rank in the spectrum of everything else that our country faces. For example, we must determine how likely electro-and geomagnetic threats are to occur given our existing preparations and deterrents. And if they were to occur, how would they impact our homeland? The answers to these basic questions become all the more important and urgent amid the horrific reminders of the existing challenges we already do face from domestic terrorism and homegrown violent extremism in our own communities--attacks like those that occurred recently in Chattanooga and in Charleston. I hope today we can make some progress on this front and that our witnesses can provide us with a clear-eyed assessment of these threats. I look forward to questioning, but I am going to yield on my questions to Senator Ernst and Senator Ayotte and then maybe pick up the chance to ask my own questions in a few minutes. Thank you. Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Senator Carper. Senator Ernst. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ERNST Senator Ernst. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Ranking Member Carper. I would like to start, of course, with a discussion. I know the DOD was brought up earlier--and, first, I apologize. I want to thank all of you for being here today as well. I know many of us are dashing from meeting to meeting. But the DOD was brought up as far as our military is concerned, so, Director Woolsey, I would like to direct this to you first. I am interested in your thoughts on the potential impact of whether it is a natural or manmade EMP on our military capabilities, and if you could I guess detail or general observation, either, on where we are most vulnerable and how we should prioritize our efforts to harden these areas in our military and mitigate some of the threats that have been discussed here today. Mr. Woolsey. Well, 99 percent of--maybe it is like 97 percent of the military are on the grid. That is where they get their power. Senator Ernst. Correct. Mr. Woolsey. I think in California there is one hot water steam facility, but that is it. So since we have 16 critical infrastructure and they all in one way or another depend on electricity, although electricity depends on them--they are interacting. But if the grid goes down, there is no special arrangement for the military. They are hungry and thirsty just like everybody else. And so in a real crisis one might look to the National Guard or whatever to maintain order. They are going to be worried about their families starving and not having water just like everybody else. So we have a very fundamental problem that the infrastructure at least in this country is essentially completely integrated, and one good thing is that Defense often has less difficulty making decisions and moving out, and sometimes they have a bit of extra money, so sometimes if you have a cooperative arrangement between Defense and other parts of the government, and particularly on something like this, Defense could kind of take the lead, particularly in areas like the corridor in the middle of Texas, which has several major military bases on it as well as several cities. And it would be a way to move out relatively quickly, perhaps, on getting some of these changes to the transformers and the rest that we have been talking about here. Senator Ernst. So you would say they would be a priority; they would need to be a priority. Mr. Woolsey. Absolutely, but, I mean, hospitals are going to be a priority because they will not have electricity, et cetera, et cetera. The military would certainly be front and center. Senator Ernst. Certainly. And do you believe that we could adequately protect our installations here? What about post bases that we have overseas? Mr. Woolsey. Well, there are different threats, both for geomagnetic--except for the really huge Carrington Effect 1859 event, the events like even the railroad one of 1921 occur only over part of the Earth. So if something like that hit us, unless it was a gigantic Carrington event, it might well not hit our bases in other parts of the world. And if they were hit, then they might not be in the United States. But whether it is in Britain or Germany or here, we cannot assume that our military is going to have electricity and power and function any different really than the rest of society. They are going to depend on British transformers in Britain. Senator Ernst. Based on those host countries. Mr. Woolsey. Yes, I am sure they have generators and fuel that will last for 2 or 3 days or something like that, like a lot of businesses do. But we are used to planning for weather- caused outages, which will last 2, 3, or 4, maximum 4 or 5, let us say, days. And that is not what this would be. This would be an outage for a very long time. Senator Ernst. OK. Mr. McClelland, I think you had some information. Mr. McClelland. I do. In 2008--and, actually, Mr. Woolsey was a part of this initiative. It was the Defense Science Board Task Force that wrote a report in February 2008 called ``More Fight, Less Fuel.'' The primary objective of that task force, as I remember, was to evaluate battlefield needs and dependency on fuel. They inadvertently found, however, they came up with two primary determinations. The second was very serious and was a surprise, and I would just like to read an excerpt from the memorandum from Dr. Schlesinger. Senator Ernst. Please. Mr. McClelland. He said, ``The task force concluded that DOD has two primary energy challenges,'' and this is the second: ``Military installations are almost completely dependent on a fragile and vulnerable commercial power grid, placing critical military and homeland defense missions at an unacceptable risk of extended outages.'' And so that report went on then to detail the findings as well as recommendations to help correct that circumstance. Senator Ernst. So in your assessment then, it would be important that not only are we ensuring our troops are prepared for war, but also that they would be prepared in situations like this to make sure we can eventually step up into military operations. Mr. McClelland. Absolutely. Senator Ernst. OK. Thank you very much. I have very little time remaining, but I do want to thank all of you for participating today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Senator. I will use your time, because we have not adequately described this. Ambassador Woolsey, you said ``a very long time.'' Lay out exactly what would happen in a massive GMD or an EMP. Lay it out. Describe what this is going to look like. This is not a 2- week or a 3-week power outage. Talk about the electrical grid going down and everything shuts down. Mr. Woolsey. Well, I will take a quick stab at it and then lateral it to Joe and Dick, if they want to add, because they both know a great deal about this issue--more than I, really. You have the short wavelength effects that operate line of sight, so if you---- Mr. Garwin. Short time. Mr. Woolsey. Short time. Chairman Johnson. I really do not want to impinge too much on Senator Ayotte's time here. Kind of get by the technical aspects to now the grid is down. Mr. Woolsey. All right. Chairman Johnson. And just describe what happens to society when the grid is down for--you said ``a very long time.'' We are talking a year or two, because we cannot get these transformers. Mr. Woolsey. It is briefly dealt with in the Commission report of 2008, and there are essentially two estimates on how many people would die from hunger, from starvation, from lack of water, and from social disruption. One estimate is that within a year or so, two-thirds of the United States population would die. The other estimate is that within a year or so, 90 percent of the U.S. population would die. We are talking about total devastation. We are not talking about just a regular catastrophe. Chairman Johnson. I think that made the point. Senator Ayotte. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR AYOTTE Senator Ayotte. Thank you, Chairman. Ambassador, you certainly made the point, which brings me to my question. I serve on the Armed Services Committee as well, and in February, our Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) both testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee regarding worldwide threats. It is our annual worldwide threats hearing. And this was obviously intended to be a comprehensive assessment, yet neither of them even mentioned the EMP threat in their lengthy written testimony provided to the Committee or in the oral testimony. So, Ambassador Woolsey, what explains this notable silence? If you look at collectively your tremendous experience in so many key positions in our government, how would you assess our awareness about this threat? And do you worry that there is a gap in terms of the intelligence community's (IC) and our overall focus on this devastating threat? Mr. Woolsey. Senator, it is a great question, and it is one of the things that perplexes everybody who looks at this. How could this be such a terrible threat and nobody has paid attention to it for quite a while, sometimes even in DIA and DNI testimony? I think there are two things going on. First of all, all parts of government and individuals are strapped for cash these days, and so to stick one's neck out in a bureaucratic situation in which you say, ``I understand that. That is my agency's responsibility. We will take charge, and here we go,'' you may find that it is being taken out of your hide. And so you do not have any real prospect to get added resources to do something, even if the resources are a couple of billion dollars, very small in these terms. So that is, I think, one thing that is going on. Another is that it has enough of a technological component that people tend to think of it as science fiction. I gave a speech to a group of very distinguished scientists, and one came up afterwards and said, ``Come on, Woolsey. You cannot mean this. Newt Gingrich writes novels about this.'' I said, ``Well, Tolstoy wrote a novel about the war in Europe in Napoleonic times. It did not mean it did not happen.'' But people get into the mode of thinking that this is so horrible if it goes the way it might--and there are books, there are good sort of dystopian books--one called ``One Second After''--about this, and so people get into not wanting to think about it, not wanting to worry about it because it is too terrible. I think that those two phenomena--and, finally, we kind of first knew about this--and, Dick, correct me if I am wrong--as a result of the atmospheric or high-altitude nuclear test just before the Atmospheric Test Ban Treaty came into effect, we and the Russians. And we dealt with the problem from the point of view of protecting the Strategic Air Command's assets, bombers, radar aircraft, and so on. But everybody kind of thought of it as, well, this is one thing that would be terrible if we had a nuclear war with the Soviets, so it is kind of a lesser included case. And the problem is that it is not now a lesser included case. If Iran gets one nuclear weapon, relatively primitive, just like what we dropped on Hiroshima, and can put it into a simple launcher, a Scud--they give Scuds to the Houthis in Yemen--a Scud and put it into orbit at, say, 100 kilometers, which is the easiest thing to do in space, the first thing we did, the first thing the Russians did, launch a little satellite into space. They get into space, and it is low-Earth orbit, and it is going around the Earth a couple of times a day or so, it crosses the United States. If you have that up there and you are the Iranians and that morning you wake up and think you really mean the ``death to America'' business, then you can pickle it off and go, ``Boom,'' and knock out the American grid. It is not just a lesser included case of strategic--and, by the way, the Iranians are rather good at deception. They might try to make it look like it was North Korea or something. Senator Ayotte. And North Korea otherwise could do it. Mr. Woolsey. North Korea otherwise could do it. Senator Ayotte. They are not know for---- Mr. Woolsey. Try to make it look like it is Iran. Senator Ayotte [continuing]. Really rational leaders all the time. Mr. Woolsey. So there are several factors, but when you put them all together, the government--and I guess finally with respect to electricity, the functions of government with respect to the electric grid, particularly after it was in part--competition introduced into it around 2000--is you have FERC, you have NERC, you have State authorities, you have different kinds of ownership practices in industry. You have chaos from the point of view of trying to have anybody in charge of a coherent policy. There is only one person, I think, who can set this priority for the Nation and get people going, and that would be the President of the United States. Senator Ayotte. And from what I hear from your testimony, you would say that it is very important that the President do that, whether it is this President or the next President, but as soon as possible. Mr. Woolsey. I absolutely think as soon as possible, because even if you are willing to hope that things will work out OK with North Korea and with other nuclear powers that could orbit a satellite, Iran is explicitly genocidal with respect to both us and Israel, and they are, I think, months maybe--I hope years, but quite possibly months away from having a nuclear weapon. Senator Ayotte. Well, and, of course, under the agreement that has been released, the U.N. Resolution against intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and their missile program will be lifted in 8 years, but the intelligence estimates have been that they would have ICBM capability this year, is what we have heard. So we know that, yes, the Scud would be the more primitive form, but they are also working on more advanced forms that could deliver these types of weapons and could have the same effect. Mr. Woolsey. Absolutely right. And the thing that is a problem here is that this is easier, an EMP shot is easier than launching a long-range missile at a target on the Earth. The shooter does not have to worry about reentry, does not have to worry about accuracy, none of that. They just need to get into orbit and detonate when the orbit takes the satellite over the United States. Senator Ayotte. Well, I want to thank all of you for being here. I did not get to a question which I will submit for the record, but there is some really important work being done on this issue at the University of New Hampshire (UNH), and they are actually a leader in the field of heliophysics and researching this area, and also the impact of actually building space aircraft instruments to predict and detect solar eruptions, but also other types of events are important that we have referenced today. So I am going to submit a question for that, and I want to give UNH a shout-out for their important work on this. And I think this is a wakeup call, Mr. Chairman, for important work we could do on this Committee to really raise the attention level of what would be a devastating impact on our country. So I thank you all for being here. Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Senator. It definitely is a wakeup call, although the wakeup call was first broadcast in 2004, then 2008. And, by the way, I did do a quick calculation using my iPhone here: 200 critical transformers at $100,000 would be $20 million. That is it, $20 million and we would go a long way toward at least protecting a good chunk of our electrical grid. Mr. Woolsey. About a third of a fighter aircraft. Chairman Johnson. $20 million, that is it. We are going to include that on our CIPA bill. Mr. Garwin. Could I reduce some confusion here, perhaps? Chairman Johnson. Sure. Mr. Garwin. Jim Woolsey and I worked together in 1998 on the Missile Threat Commission, and we said there it is not only the ICBMs but it is short-range missiles, cruise missiles, or ballistic missiles from freighters that could threaten the United States. Now, some people do not like to hear that because they like to build defenses against ICBMs, and it is hard to defend against these little things--even harder to defend against ones that do not have to actually reenter but could detonate over the United States. However, never mind radars. We do see every launch of a significant ballistic missile, even Scuds, with the warning satellites. And so we know where it is fired from. If it is a long-range missile fired from Iran or North Korea, we know. There are easier ways for those countries to commit suicide than to send a nuclear weapon to do EMP that does not kill anybody directly but may kill tens of millions of people indirectly. But among those would be many Iranians and North Koreans, and, one ought to say that, in my opinion. Chairman Johnson. Well, thank you, Dr. Garwin. Senator Carper. Senator Carper. Thanks again, everybody. I think I would like to start off my first question with Mr. Currie--thank you for being here--and Dr. Garwin. Here is my question: We have heard about high-altitude nuclear detonations and the EMP threat that they could pose. Where do manmade EMP threats rank in the spectrum of all homeland threats? Do you want to take a shot at that, Mr. Currie? Mr. Currie. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question. So that is the responsibility of DHS to assess those types of threats, and one of the things we found in our work is that DHS has not done that. They have not sort of incorporated the EMP or geomagnetic threat into their assessments yet. And there has been some confusion at DHS, too. When we asked them the question of who is responsible for doing that, there has been some confusion around who is supposed to do that. Senator Carper. OK. Dr. Garwin. Mr. Garwin. Nuclear weapons are not very widely available, and to add to that, the capability of launching them over the United States is also not something they find in the ordinary terrorist cell. So that is a blessing. The suitcase battery-operated EMP generators, they can cause damage at a substation, but there are a lot of other ways to cause damage at a substation by shooting the transformer---- Senator Carper. We saw that near San Jose. I saw it with my own eyes. Mr. Garwin. Yes. Or, for instance---- Senator Carper. Metcalf. Mr. Garwin [continuing]. Nuclear power plants. You use a little bit of explosives on the towers, and you bring down all the offsite power. That is why nuclear power plants have backup diesels, and we have taken that much more seriously after the Fukushima Daiichi meltdowns. But it took awhile to realize that the U.S. plants did not have sufficient battery capacity, did not have sufficient protection of their diesels. So the high-altitude nuclear explosion EMP threat is real. It is very special. We have many other problems of homeland security: disease spread by terrorists, for instance, as was mentioned; many other problems; widespread just shooting in marketplaces, which is endemic in the rest of the world-- fortunately, not so common here; bringing down the commercial aviation sector by various means. So Homeland Security has a lot of things to think about. Senator Carper. I like to say it is a busy neighborhood. Mr. Garwin. And EMP, we should fix the E3 threat. We should fix the solar storm threat. And then we should move on and do the E1 hardening and tell people that they are going to be out of business if such a thing happens, and that is an unnecessary vulnerability of the country. Senator Carper. Ms. Bourge, do you want to comment on what Mr. Currie and Dr. Garwin just said, please? Ms. Bourge. Thank you, Senator. What I would add to that is that the EMP threat is a lower-likelihood threat, but it is one of the highest-impact threats that you can find out there. And I think that is one reason that even though it is a very low likelihood, it is a very important issue, and a lot of people talk about it. Maybe not as many as should, and hopefully we are moving toward getting to public-private partnerships across the infrastructures to do so. But for now, it is a low-risk, high-impact threat. And as industry, we address those type of threats in a defense-in-depth approach, and so we take into consideration all threats, but then we do have to also factor in the likelihood, the ability to protect against it, the cost and impact on the consumers, and many other considerations as we are doing that to decide which threats we are going to address which ways. And so just because it is a low likelihood does not mean we do not think about it, but it means that it is one of the ones that is not the first that we are fixing. Senator Carper. All right. My followup to you, if I could, we have heard today that it could take as little as $20 million to upgrade 200 transformers in the United States. Would you like to address that number or that assertion? Ms. Bourge. So I have heard that number before in the past. Usually, I have heard it in reference to---- Senator Carper. Do you have any idea how many transformers there are in the country? I do not know. Roughly. Are there 100,000? Are there 50,000? Ms. Bourge. I believe you are looking at around 20,000 of the major transformers. Senator Carper. Major. Ms. Bourge. But I would have to confirm that number. Senator Carper. OK. Ms. Bourge."
