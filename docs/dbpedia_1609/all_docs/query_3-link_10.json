Towards the end of the show there was a glow with ruffling curtains of faint colour,\" Rebecca told BuzzFeed News.\n\nRebecca also managed to capture this time lapse of the spectacular show.\n\n“Skywatchers were the beneficiaries of a lucky coincidence in recent days,” Jonathan Nally, editor of space news web site SpaceInfo.com.au, told BuzzFeed News.\n\n“Put it all together, and you had perfect conditions for aurora watching” Nally says. He added that we’re roughly at the peak of the solar activity cycle right now.\n\nOf course social media also blew up, with many posting their own images across Twitter and Instagram. #NoFilter.\n\nLike BuzzFeedOz On Facebook.\n\nShare This Article"
