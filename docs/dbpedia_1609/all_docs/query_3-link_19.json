        "text": "Geomagnetic storm offers a chance to see colourful auroras, but authorities are taking precautions\n\nA series of powerful solar storms made the northern lights unusually visible far south Friday, and could dazzle again on Saturday night in Canada.\n\nScientists expected the geomagnetic storm would lead to colourful auroras overnight not only in Canada, but the northern United States and parts of Europe too.\n\nIt could also cause some disruptions to communications over the weekend.\n\nHere's a closer look.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nThe sun goes through an 11-year cycle, with a minimum and a maximum of activity. During the solar maximum — which we are in now — more sunspots can be seen across the sun's surface.\n\nVery often, they are followed by what's known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), a huge burst of charged particles that are carried along the solar wind.\n\nIn this case, the sun produced a series of CMEs beginning Wednesday, and they are headed toward Earth, said the U.S.-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\n\"It's exciting,\" said Ian Cohen, deputy chief scientist for Space Exploration at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab. \"What makes this really unique is that we've had multiple, as many as five, over the last couple days that have all subsequently been directed at Earth.\"\n\nWhere can I see the northern lights?\n\nIf Earth is in the path of these charged particles, as it is in this case, the particles can interact with our own magnetic field and then with molecules in the upper atmosphere, which then gives us the northern lights, or aurora borealis.\n\nThat means, with a clear sky, the northern lights could be visible across much of Canada on Friday night, and perhaps Saturday night as well.\n\nThe latest storm could produce northern lights as far south in the U.S. as Alabama and Northern California, according to NOAA.\n\n\"As these coronal mass ejections hit, those northern lights can actually creep down to lower and lower latitudes,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"It's not anything anyone needs to be concerned about, but it is a nice reminder and indicator that we do have this connection to the sun.\"\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nAn extreme geomagnetic storm in 2003 took out power in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa.\n\nThe most intense solar storm in recorded history, in 1859, prompted auroras in central America and possibly even Hawaii.\n\nNOAA space weather forecaster Shawn Dahl had said that was an \"extreme-level event\" that was not anticipated in this case, but he said it could come close.\n\nCohen said authorities, as well as satellite and electricity operators, track these events and take the necessary precautions.\n\n\"They can mitigate the effects, but most of the time nothing happens,\" he said.\n\nKyle Reiter, space weather forecaster at Natural Resources Canada, said in Canada these \"impacts are things that we actively monitor, and there are things that we account for in our operations of aviation, power transmission networks, et cetera.\"\n\n\"Those users are actively monitoring circumstances. They have contingency plans and they're aware of the situation.\""
