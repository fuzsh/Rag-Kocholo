        "text": "One of the most common items on countless bucket lists is the Northern Lights. These explosions of color in the sky are limited to certain areas of the world in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere (where they are naturally called the Southern Lights) and occur when highly charged electrons from solar winds interact with elements in the atmosphere. They create dizzying patterns in rainbows of color and the name Northern Lights seems so insignificant for the beautiful wonder they are.\n\nSnapshot Survey\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts!\n\nPlease subscribe for your personalized newsletter:\n\nEmail address\n\n1\n\nAlaska\n\nVia The Northern Lights, Alaska - ...\n\nAlaska is one of the first places that comes to mind when thinking of the Northern Lights.\n\n2\n\nGreen Waves\n\nVia Aurora #28\n\nThe shapes created by the light depend on the distribution of the charged particles in the atmosphere and wind direction.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\n3\n\nIceland\n\nVia One off the bucket list\n\nIceland is another of the countries lucky enough to experience the spectacle of the Northern Lights.\n\n4\n\nFinland\n\nVia davidclapp.co.uk\n\nAn incredible green sweep over the snowy pine forest.\n\n5\n\nRainbow of the Night Sky\n\nVia PHOTOS: 10 Best Places To ...\n\nThe color of the aurora borealis is totally dependent on which mineral particles are in the atmosphere.\n\nRelated Videos about\n\n6\n\nShaft\n\nVia Northern Lights - Aurora Borealis\n\nMuch like cloud formations, you can find all sorts of\n\nshapes in the light show.\n\n7\n\nProof That Thor Exists\n\nVia Mixed Magnificent Photography | From ...\n\nAnd if you have an active imagination you can see Asgard!\n\n8\n\nNorthern Lights\n\nVia From moon 2 moon\n\nWhen you look at the tiny dots that are the town, you can understand the scale of the spread of the lights.\n\n***\n\nThe Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis, are a natural light display in the sky caused by collisions between electrically charged particles released from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere. The lights are visible in the Northern Hemisphere, usually in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. The colors of the Northern Lights vary, ranging from pink, green, yellow, blue, and violet. The colors are caused by different types of gases, such as oxygen and nitrogen, in the atmosphere.\n\nThe Northern Lights can be seen in the night sky for several hours at a time. They can occur any time of the year, but they are most visible during the dark winter months. The lights are most visible in areas with low light pollution, such as the Arctic and Antarctic regions.\n\nThe Northern Lights have long been a source of fascination and awe. They have been the subject of myths and legends for centuries, and have been associated with the gods and goddesses in many cultures. The lights have been seen as a sign of good luck, and have been used as a source of inspiration for art, literature, and music.\n\n9\n\nMinot, North Dakota\n\nVia fanpop.com\n\nThe caption that came with this photo claims that North Dakota is the only US state other than Alaska that experiences the Northern Lights.

Whether viewed from a cozy lodge tucked away in the snowy expanse or on a brisk expedition under the stars, the sight is nothing short of magical – a natural symphony of light that whispers the ancient secrets of our solar system.\n\n18\n\nErsfjord, Norway\n\nVia 7 Simply Amazing Places - ...\n\nOne of my favorite pictures of the Northern Lights.\n\n19\n\nLappish Winter\n\nVia Northern lights in Lappish winter\n\nA better reason to visit Lapland than Santa Claus.\n\n20\n\nOctober Aurora\n\nVia October Aurora\n\nSteve McDougall took this amazing shot of the aurora borealis in Northern Manitoba, Canada.\n\n21\n\nNature's Kali\n\nVia The Northern Lights: Trip of ...\n\nKali is the word we Brits use for sherbet powder.\n\n***\n\nSherbet powder, sparkling like a handful of crushed diamonds, calls to mind the shimmering auroras that grace the polar skies. As sweet on the tongue as the Northern Lights are to the eyes, kali delicately dances across the senses. In hues of vivacious pinks and greens, these celestial dancers perform a ballet in the vast cosmic theatre.

The light created from neon lights is usually a bright, glowing color. The colors of neon lights can range from blues, greens, yellows, and even reds.\n\nNeon lights are often used to create interesting and unique visual displays. They can be used to create signs, advertisements, and even art pieces. Neon lights are commonly used in nightclubs and other entertainment venues to create a vibrant atmosphere.\n\nThe Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, is a natural phenomenon that occurs in the night sky in the northern hemisphere. It is caused by the interaction of charged particles from the sun and the Earth's magnetic field. The Northern Lights are usually seen as a curtain of colorful lights in the sky, ranging from blues, greens, yellows, and even reds.\n\nThe Aurora Australis is the Southern Hemisphere's version of the Northern Lights. It is seen in the night sky in the southern hemisphere and is caused by the same interaction of charged particles from the sun and the Earth's magnetic field. The colors of the Aurora Australis are usually similar to those of the Northern Lights.\n\n29\n\nThe Hand of God\n\nVia The light and the lighthouse\n\nCan you see it?\n\n30\n\nWonders of the Norwegian Sky\n\nVia flickr.com\n\nThe wonders of our world!

Natural light shows, they result from particles emitted by the sun that collide with Earth's magnetic field. The charged particles energize atoms in our atmosphere, producing a stunning spectrum of colors. From ethereal greens to vivacious pinks, these celestial curtains dance across the sky, offering a mesmerizing performance that inspires artists and scientists alike. Those fortunate enough to witness their magic carry the memory of this otherworldly spectacle forever.\n\n46\n\nAlaska\n\nVia 30 Brilliant Aurora Photography For ...\n\nThe formation here is almost like geometric planes of light.\n\n47\n\nAurora Australis, Antarctica\n\nVia Aurora Australis - Antarctica\n\nI really hope that's a falling star in the top right because that would make this picture even more magical.\n\n***\n\nThe Aurora Australis, or Southern Lights, are a spectacular natural phenomenon that can be seen in the night sky in Antarctica. They are created when electrically charged particles from the sun collide with the Earth’s atmosphere. This collision causes the particles to become excited and emit light, creating beautiful curtains of bright colors that can stretch across the night sky.\n\nThe Aurora Australis is typically seen in the southern hemisphere, including Antarctica, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand, and Australia. The best time to see the Aurora Australis is during the winter months, when the sky is dark and clear. The aurora can appear in a variety of colors, including greens, blues, purples, pinks, and whites.\n\nThe Aurora Australis is a beautiful reminder of the power of nature, and it can be a thrilling experience to witness this natural phenomenon. It is also a reminder of the importance of protecting the environment, as the Aurora Australis is affected by pollution and other environmental changes. Seeing the Aurora Australis in Antarctica is a truly unique experience, and it is sure to be a memory that will last a lifetime.\n\n48\n\nAurora Australis and the Milky Way over Queenstown, New Zealand\n\nVia All sizes | Our Galaxy ...\n\nIn my humble opinion, New Zealand is the most incredibly beautiful country on Earth. This underlines it.\n\n***\n\nThe Aurora Australis is a natural phenomenon that occurs in the Southern Hemisphere, with its most frequent sightings being in New Zealand. It is a spectacular display of light in the night sky, usually seen as a green or pinkish glow in the sky. The Aurora Australis is caused by solar particles entering the Earth's atmosphere and colliding with oxygen and nitrogen, creating a colorful and beautiful display.\n\nThe Milky Way is also visible from New Zealand, and can be seen as a bright band of stars in the night sky. It is the galaxy that our Solar System is a part of, and is made up of hundreds of billions of stars.
