        "text": "Why Alaska?\n\nIf you’re browsing northern lights–viewing vacations, you’ve likely seen trips to Norway, Canada, Sweden, Iceland, and Greenland. They’re all great places, but here are 4 reasons why Alaska tops the list:\n\n1. Easy Travel from the Lower 48\n\nYou can book nonstop flights to Anchorage year-round from major U.S. hubs (like Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Seattle, and Portland), so you can get here in just a few hours—no passport required.\n\n2. Fall or Winter\n\nFrom mid-November through March, you can check into a lodge or look for the lights each night as you try a different activity, like ice fishing or dogsledding. And if you’re on an aurora quest from mid-August to mid-September, (Fall) there’s still time to enjoy summer activities, like visiting Denali National Park or taking a glacier cruise.\n\n3. Great Odds\n\nVisitors to Alaska who spend 3 nights looking for the lights from Fairbanks have a 90% chance of spotting them!\n\nHow to Increase Your Chances of Seeing the Lights?\n\nThere’s no guarantee, of course: Clouds may cover them, or they may simply not show up in your location. Fortunately, there are a couple of ways to greatly improve your chances of seeing the aurora:\n\nPlan 5-7 Days\n\nDedicate at least 3 nights to looking for the lights, so that you, too, will have a 90% chance of seeing them. It can work as a three- or four-day trip centered on a weekend, but then you will need to be more focused.\n\nGo to Fairbanks and the Auroral Oval\n\nFairbanks sits just below the main auroral band, offering dark skies, minimal light pollution, and clear views of the night sky - all of which make the area a sweet spot for northern lights viewing.\n\nThe city has a variety of aurora-viewing venues, from a number of scenic drives and parks to cozy cabins and lodges. With the airport located just a short drive away, visitors can fly into Fairbanks and be at a world-class aurora-viewing venue in less than an hour.\n\nLodges & Overnight Tours\n\nNorthern Alaska Tour Company offers 3-day/2-night (and longer) trips from Fairbanks to Coldfoot Camp above the Arctic Circle. Located halfway between Fairbanks and Prudhoe Bay, this is an exceptional spot to see the lights.\n\nIniakuk Lake Wilderness Lodge, a fly-in luxury wilderness lodge inside Gates of the Arctic National Park, offers one of Alaska’s most exclusive experiences for viewing the northern lights. Step outside or scan the sky from the lodge’s huge picture windows.\n\nJust an hour from Fairbanks is Borealis Basecamp, where you can book your own clear-roofed igloo for the night.\n\nSalmon Berry Tours offers 6-day/5-night packages from Anchorage. You’ll work your way north, stopping in Talkeetna, and look for the northern lights each night once you reach Fairbanks.\n\nWild Journeys Alaska offers custom, private multi-day packages (3+ nights) from Anchorage. Enjoy fun activities during the day and 3 nights of aurora viewing. Going for more than 3 nights? You’ll get an aurora forecast each day, so you can pick which 3 nights to chase the lights.\n\nEvening Tours\n\nFrom Fairbanks\n\nAurora Pointe is a northern lights–viewing venue just 15 minutes from downtown Fairbanks. You’ll find a beautiful, warm space serving coffee, tea, and locally made snacks while you wait for the lights to appear.\n\nWith Alaska Wildlife Guide, you can leave from Fairbanks and combine a soak in Chena Hot Springs with your search for the aurora.\n\nTravel beyond the Arctic Circle to see the lights with Northern Alaska Tour Company. Drive, fly, or do both!\n\nFor something really unique, head out with Rod’s Alaskan Guide Service for a night of ice fishing. You’ll be nice and warm in a cabin out over the lake as you cast your line and enjoy refreshments. The wide-open view is perfect if the aurora makes an appearance.\n\nFrom Anchorage\n\nOn the Anchorage Aurora Quest with Alaska Photo Treks, you'll pho­to­graph alpen­glow on snow-capped moun­tains, frosty scenes glow­ing in rich win­ter light, wildlife wan­der­ing snowy paths, city lights reflect­ing on the water at twi­light, and pos­si­bly even the north­ern lights!\n\nWith Wild Alaska Journeys, you’ll head out of Anchorage (or Wasilla/Palmer) between 9 and 11 p.m., and for the next 7 or so hours, you’ll be on a hunt for the aurora!\n\nOther Tips"
