        "text": "MetService meteorologist Clare O’Connor couldn’t say whether the solar storm would continue tonight but recommended viewers to look earlier in the evening, from after sunset to about 9pm.\n\n“It will gradually become cloudier towards midnight so you have a better chance of seeing it if you’re out early,” she said.\n\nClouds were coming from the west, so Whakatāne and towns further east could expect to see the solar flare for longer.\n\nPresident of the Astronomy Society David Grieg said it was a “fantastic” and “awesome thing” to have checked off his list.\n\nWatching from Pyes Pa, he said red glow beams peaked at 8.45pm but also flared up at 12.15am, 12.30am and 2.30am.\n\nHe compared watching auroras to fishing, as it was a long but worthwhile waiting game.\n\nWhat is an aurora?\n\nThe Southern lights were the result of charged particles from the sun coming close to the earth and challenging its magnetic field.\n\n“The particles interact with the atmosphere and those interactions release energy which can be seen through the colour displays in the sky,” MetService’s O’Connor said.\n\nThe aurora season could be predicted through the sun’s 11-year cycle, with the peak of the current cycle due next year.\n\nO’Connor said last night was the most “dramatic” and “uncommon” aurora she had witnessed.\n\nShe was surprised at the red colour of the sky, as past auroras she had witnessed in the South Island had been a pale green colour.\n\nThis was due to its strength. Light displays don’t often reach the North Island, but with last night’s sky were seen as far north as Northland.\n\nDarkness, minimal cloud cover and the charged particles interacting with the earth were all needed for the geomagnetic storm to be viewed by the naked eye.\n\n“You’re best to go to an unobstructed view where you can see southward – most phones will have a compass if you’re not quite up to date with what north or south is, and ideally you want to leave the city lights behind you.”\n\nCold snap\n\nAt about 6.30am this morning, Rotorua was recorded to have the second-coldest temperature of the month for 50 years at minus 3.3 degrees, with Tauranga at 3.3 degrees.\n\nWhile the Bay of Plenty region could expect warmer but still frosty mornings on Monday and Tuesday, seasonally average temperatures would return after that.\n\nTonight, Tauranga could expect a minimum of 6 degrees, Rotorua at 3 degrees and Whakatāne 2 degrees."
