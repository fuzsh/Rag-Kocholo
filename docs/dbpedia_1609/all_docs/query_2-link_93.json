Boeing filed a suit against Virgin Galactic, accusing it of retaining commercialized secrets that the 2 companies had exchanged portion moving to make a caller mothership, which ne'er came to fruition. Were There Any Scenes Cut Connecting Ghostbusters: Afterlife to Frozen Empire? On Friday, Boeing asked a national justice successful Alexandria, Virginia, to contented a tribunal bid blocking Virgin Galactic from further utilizing proprietary information that was shared betwixt the 2 companies arsenic portion of an statement successful 2022, according to the complaint. Boeing is accusing Virgin Galactic of ‚Äúretaining, using, and threatening further usage of commercialized secrets‚Äù that beryllium to the institution and its Virginia-based subsidiary, Aurora Flight Sciences, the ailment read. In July 2022, Virgin Galactic announced an statement with Aurora to plan and manufacture its adjacent procreation mothership. The mothership is utilized to transportation a spaceplane and merchandise it astatine an altitude of 44,500 feet (13,500 meters) supra the ground. Virgin Galactic is successful the process of processing a caller procreation spaceplane, called Delta, to transportation abstraction tourists to suborbital heights astatine a much predominant pace. The caller spaceplane, however, requires an upgraded version of Eve, Virgin Galactic‚Äôs existent mothership model. This enhanced mentation is designed to beryllium quicker to nutrient and easier to maintain, aiding the institution successful scaling up its operations.

The unusual sight is enough to send people flocking to social media to report the arrival of aliens, but in fact what we‚Äôre witnessing is a historic arrival of a different kind: Starlink. Owned by the infamous Elon Musk, Starlink is a network of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite arrays, and apart from inadvertently sowing panic about the arrival of aliens amongst the uninformed, more importantly, it‚Äôs changing the way people all over the world access and use the internet. And while Starlink is currently the most established and credible LEO satellite internet provider, it‚Äôs already clear to us that it will certainly not be the last to enter this exciting new market. Big names including Jeff Bezos‚Äô Amazon have thrown their hat into the ring and soon, yachts - and everyone else - will be truly spoilt for choice in the satellite internet game. In our last article with TSM Superyacht Technology, we discussed how LEO satellite internet is changing the internet game for the maritime industry, especially the superyacht sector. Now, once again in partnership with TSM Superyacht Technology, we‚Äôre going for a spacewalk to take a more detailed look at the who‚Äôs who of LEO satellite internet, both existing and still to come. #StarlinkRevolution #YachtConnectivity #SatelliteInternet #LEOSatellites #YachtingLife #NauticalInnovations #MaritimeInnovation #TSMTechnicalExcellence #MaritimeConnectivity #InnovativeSolutions #YachtTechnology #Yachting #YachtCrew #SuperYacht #Technology #Connectivity #Entertainment #IT #YachtManagement #YachtOwner #TSM\n\nBlue Origin to remain grounded for now following crash probe. by AFP Staff Writers - Washington (AFP) US aviation regulators said Wednesday that Blue Origin must complete \"21 corrective actions\" before it can resume launches, closing a probe into an uncrewed crash last year that set back Jeff Bezos's space company. The Federal Aviation Administration report into the September 12, 2022 \"mishap\" said failure of an engine nozzle caused by higher-than-expected engine operating temperatures caused the New Shepard rocket to fall back to the ground shortly after liftoff, even as the capsule carrying research experiments escaped and floated safely back to Earth. \"During the mishap the onboard launch vehicle systems detected the anomaly, triggered an abort and separation of the capsule from the propulsion module as intended and shut down the engine,\" said the FAA. The fact the capsule ejected right away was viewed positively, suggesting that any crew would have been safe if they had been aboard. But \"the closure of the mishap investigation does not signal an immediate resumption of New Shepard launches,\" the agency said. Blue Origin responded with a post on the social media site X, saying \"We've received the FAA's letter and plan to fly soon.\" In all, Blue Origin has flown 31 people -- some as paying customers and others as guests -- since July 2021, when Bezos himself took part in the first flight. While it has been grounded, rival Virgin Galactic, the company founded by British billionaire Richard Branson, has pressed on, flying four spaceflights so far this year. The two companies compete in the emerging space tourism sector, offering a few minutes of weightlessness in \"suborbital\" space. Virgin Galactic tickets were sold for between $200,000-$450,000, while Blue Origin doesn't disclose its ticket prices publicly. https://lnkd.in/dNnqTYcj\n\nThe SpaceX Travel Card is an interesting concept, but it's important to understand that it currently doesn't exist as a real product or service offered by SpaceX. Here's a breakdown of the concept: Origin: The idea likely originated from a Reddit post or creative concept showcasing what booking space travel with SpaceX might be like in the future. Functionality (imagined): This card would hypothetically allow users to book flights to various destinations in space, including the Moon and other planets. It might also include features like: Selecting the date and number of travelers. Viewing available flights and launch windows. Managing travel documents and boarding passes. #SpaceX #TravelCard #IA"
