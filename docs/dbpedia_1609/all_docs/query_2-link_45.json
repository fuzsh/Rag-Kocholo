        "text": "WASHINGTON, DC — The U.S. Postal Service Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\n\nH. Glen Walker will be on hand at the Smithsonian National Postal Museum on Oct. 1 to dedicate a series of stamps meant to draw attention to the global role of polar scientific research.\n\nThe two 41-cent Polar Lights stamps feature the aurora borealis and the aurora australis, or the northern and southern lights, meteorological phenomena that have been part of human folklore since the dawn of history. Today, the polar auroras are the subject of scientific investigation as part of the International Polar Year, a multinational research program that will focus on the Artic and Antarctic until March 2009.\n\n“Beyond their obvious beauty, these stamps also carry a message,” said Walker. “Just as it is our privilege to enjoy the wonders of nature, it is also our duty to preserve and protect these wonders.”\n\nAlso scheduled to make remarks at the First-Day-of-Issue ceremony are Allen Kane, director of the Smithsonian National Postal Museum, and Cheryl Ganz, the museum’ acting chief curator for philately. “The Smithsonian National Postal Museum is very pleased to host the First-Day-of-Issue ceremony for the Polar Lights stamps,” said Kane. “U.S. postage stamps tell the story of the nation’ history, heroes and heritage. The National Postal Museum brings these stories to life through its exhibits and programs.”\n\nThe Postal Service produced 80 million of the stamps in panes of 20 which were designed by Falls Church, VA-based artist Phil Jordan. The photograph of the northern lights is the work of Fred Hirschmann of Wasilla, Alaska; the photograph of the southern lights is by German photographer Per-Andre Hoffmann.\n\nStarting Oct. 1, the Polar Lights stamps can be purchased online at the Postal Store at www.usps.com/shop, by calling toll-free 800-STAMP-24, at philatelic centers nationwide and at local Post Offices.\n\nPolar Lights Backgrounder\n\nOct. 1, 2007, the U.S. Postal Service will issue this pane of 20 41-cent stamps with two designs that feature photographs of the polar lights, often known as auroras.\n\nThe polar lights are a luminous glow seen in the night sky at high latitudes surrounding the north and south magnetic poles. These auroras are the result of a magnetic storm — when Earth’ magnetic field is unusually active due to a dynamic interaction with the Sun. During magnetic storms, energetic electrons descend from space and collide with molecules in the upper atmosphere, leading to the emission of green and sometimes red light. Auroras come in different visual forms, including arcs, curtains and rays, and are a relatively common sight in Alaska, Canada and northern Europe. During particularly intense magnetic storms, auroras can occasionally be seen in some of the lower 48 states as well.\n\n“Aurora” is the Latin name of the ancient Roman goddess of the dawn. The aurora borealis are the northern lights, and the aurora australis are the southern lights. Through history, auroras have inspired a colorful folklore, especially among northern Europeans and the Inuit people of Siberia and North America, where the lights have been attributed to human or animal spirits and have sometimes been thought to foretell ominous news. Today, the aurora is the subject of scientific investigation, with researchers from many countries collaborating during International Polar Year 2007–2008.\n\nThe two designs on this pane of 20 stamps feature photographs of auroras. The photograph of the aurora borealis, the northern lights, was made by Fred Hirschmann of Wasilla, AK. It shows the northern lights over the Talkeetna Mountains in Alaska. The photograph of the aurora australis, a phenomenon of the southern polar region, was made by Per-Andre Hoffmann of Stuttgart, Germany who resides in Manila, Philippines.\n\nThe header image on the pane of stamps is a photograph of the aurora borealis by LeRoy Zimmerman of Ester, AK. Phil Jordan of Falls Church, VA, was artistic designer.\n\nJeffrey Love of the U.S. Geological Survey served as a scientific consultant to the U.S. Postal Service for this project. He also wrote the text that appears on the back of the stamp pane.\n\nThe two stamps on this pane of 20 were featured on the International Polar Year 2007–2008 souvenir sheet in February.\n\nEighty million of the Polar Lights stamps were printed.

The beautiful sight is a result of a magnetic storm, when Earth's magnetic field is unusually active due to a dynamic interaction with the Sun. During magnetic storms, energetic electrons descend from space and collide with molecules in the upper atmosphere, leading to the emission of green and sometimes red light. Throughout history, the polar lights have inspired a colorful folklore; today the aurora is the subject of scientific investigation as part of the international Polar Year, with many nations collaborating to understand this and other fascinating phenomena.\"\n\nText on back of each stamp:\n\n\"The northern lights or aurora borealis are a common sight in the northern polar region; here they appear over the Talkeetna Mountains in Alaska. During particularly intense magnetic storms, aurora borealis can occasionally be seen in some of the lower 48 states as well.\"\n\n\"The southern lights or aurora australis are the polar lights as seen in the Southern Hemisphere. Auroras often appear in visual forms that combine aspects of arcs, curtains, and rays; this photograph shows an aurora over Antarctica, where hints of red indicate particularly strong magnetic activity in space.\"\n\nMarginal Markings:\n\nFront: ©2006 USPS • Plate position diagram • Price \".41 x 20 = $8.20\" • 4 Plate Numbers •\n\nBack: Descriptive text on back of stamp • Barcode \"461900\" • USPS Logo •\n\nPhilatelic Products\n\nThere are five philatelic products available for this stamp issue:\n\n461963 – First-Day Cover Set of 2, $1.58\n\n461968 – Digital Color Postmark Set of 2, $3.00\n\n461991 – Ceremony Program, $6.95\n\n461993 – First-Day Cover Keepsake, $9.68\n\n461999 – Digital Color Postmark Keepsake, $11.20\n\nHow to Order First-Day Covers\n\nStamp Fulfillment Services also offers first-day covers for new stamp issues and Postal Service stationery items postmarked with the official first-day-of-issue cancellation.
