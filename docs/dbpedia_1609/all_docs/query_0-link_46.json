Disabilities and the library: Fostering equity for patrons and staff with differing abilities. ABC-CLIO.\n\nAbstract: Librarians need to understand the needs and abilities of differently abled patrons, and anyone responsible for hiring and managing librarians must know how to provide an equitable environment. This book serves as an educational resource for both groups.\n\nUnderstanding the needs and abilities of patrons who are differently abled increases librarians’ ability to serve them from childhood through adulthood. While some librarians are fortunate to have had coursework to help them understand the needs and abilities of the differently abled, many have had little experience working with this diverse group. In addition, many persons who are differently abled are—or would like to become—librarians.\n\nDisabilities and the Library helps readers understand the challenges faced by people who are differently abled, both as patrons and as information professionals. Readers will learn to assess their library’s physical facilities, programming, staff, and continuing education to ensure that their libraries are prepared to include people of all abilities. Inclusive programming and collection development suggestions will help librarians to meet the needs of patrons and colleagues with mobility and dexterity problems, learning differences, hearing and vision limitations, sensory and cognitive challenges, autism, and more. Additional information is included about assistive and adaptive technologies and web accessibility. Librarians will value this accessible and important book as they strive for equity and inclusivity.\n\nFeatures:\n\nIdentifies the differently abled who are patrons and employees in libraries\n\nDetails the needs and abilities of a special clientele\n\nEncourages the interest of management in hiring applicants who are differently abled\n\nIncludes chapters written by working librarians, educators, and researchers\n\nOffers advice to strengthen services, programming, collection development, accessibility, and legal compliance\n\nLink: https://www.abc-clio.com/products/a5549p/\n\nKIM THOMPSON\n\nThis chapter overviews a model of inclusion that can help organizations in decision-making for an inclusive workplaces, including decisions about hiring practices and the design and support of inclusive workplace cultures once a hire is settled.\n\nCitation: Thompson, K.

I study media discourses that position cultural and social anxieties with particular attention on affect and trauma, cultural politics of identity, gender, intercultural/intergroup representation, Jewish identity and (post)assimilation, and media and film criticism.\n\nCitation: Moscowitz, David. “The Postassimilationist Performativity of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.”\n\nAbstract: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin have presented the world with contrasting styles of media projection dating to Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. I regard Zelenskyy’s media use as a model for effective postmodern argument by employing a postassimilationalist positioning of his Jewish identity. Zelenskyy negotiates a liminal space that distinguishes social constraint and construction to invite qualities of argumentative identification that reify how “becoming-Jewish necessarily affects the non-Jew as much as the Jew” (Deleuze and Guattari 291).\n\nLINWAN WU and CHANG-WON CHOI (Ph.D. alumnus)\n\nCitation: Choi, C-W., & Wu, L.

For example, while child abductions are rare, research has found that as high as 72% of US parents fear that their child will be abducted. Much of what we learn about this crime comes from media reports, which tend to over exaggerate the threat of abduction. Therefore, our study is one of the first experiments to test whether specific kinds of child abduction news stories influence parental perceptions of kidnapping.\n\nCitation: Weatherred, J. L., & Moscowitz, L. (2022). Exemplification of child abduction in US news media: Testing media effects on parental perceptions and assessment of risk. Journal of Experimental Criminology, 1-20.\n\nAbstract: The objective of this study is to advance the literature on exemplification theory and how media coverage can impact public perceptions of crime. This 3-condition, between-subjects experimental design tests whether specific child abduction news stories influenced parental concerns, in particular their estimation of the likelihood of the crime as a threat in their own communities and for their own families. The level of proximity may explain why parents exposed to the extreme news exemplar perceive child abductions to be a problem in their own community, but not necessarily perceive the crime as a personal threat likely to happen to one’s own child or family. Theoretical and practical implications about news coverage and its impact on public perceptions of crime are discussed.\n\nLink: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11292-022-09535-9\n\nPANELS/PRESENTATIONS\n\nCANDICE EDRINGTON\n\nPresented at NCA. The presentation was Honoring PLACE: Digital Activism Through Communication and was sponsored by the Activism and Social Justice Division. National Communication Association was held in New Orleans, LA, November 17th-20th.\n\nAbstract: From the Suffrage Movement to modern-day feminism, from Abolitionists to the Civil Rights, Black Lives Matter, and #MeToo movements, the role of communicators has been vital to activist work and social change for centuries. Today's movements rely upon the speed and connectivity of social media because through participatory media groups of people mobilize quickly, resulting in impactful action and messages that reverberate throughout the social sphere. This social connectivity and advocacy work resonates with Gen-Z learners. As social activism and engagement among youth continues to rise, within the classroom communication educators have an opportunity to teach tomorrow's communications practitioners to use their agency as creators and consumers to explore issues of identity, diversity, justice, and action through digital activism.\n\nCANDICE EDRINGTON\n\nPresented at NCA.

(2022, accepted). Expectations, rejections, and reviewer 2: Publishing demystified. Panel presented at ALISE Conference 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, October 24–26.\n\nAbstract: Navigating the pressures and processes of academic publishing is a challenge for doctoral students and recent graduates. While there is a growing expectation that doctoral students and recent graduates are capable of immediately producing publishable research and survive in a “publish or perish” environment, many doctoral students have misperceptions of and remain uncertain about how to navigate the publishing process (Rich, 2013). However, while the quantity of publications does not necessarily equate to success in the job market, publishing productivity is critical in finding employment (Hatch & Skipper, 2016). As such, doctoral students need to consider the publishing process early in their program so they can present a competitive publishing record when entering the job market. Yet, many universities do not provide formal training on understanding scholarly publishing or devote efforts to include explicit content on navigating the publishing process (Hanafizadeh & Shaikh, 2021). This panel from ALISE’s Doctoral Student Special Interest Group will therefore address this gap by presenting advice and strategies for doctoral students at any stage of their program, focusing on expectations of publishing as a doctoral student and best practices for publishing research. Panelists, comprised of early-career faculty and doctoral candidates with admirable publication records, will discuss their experiences with publishing, specifically through discussions of (1) expectations for publishing productivity as a doctoral student; (2) their decision-making processes about where to submit research for publication; (3) their strategies for publishing most efficiently; and (4) their experiences with publication rejections. Panelists will provide insight into the typical workflows of the publishing process, detail the most common pitfalls when submitting research for publication, and describe how to effectively address these pitfalls in manuscripts to minimize chances of receiving rejections. Drawing on the experiences of the panelists, attendees will learn of best practices for submitting research for publication and understand how to address fundamental issues and pitfalls of publishing to help increase their chances of getting their work published.\n\nVANESSA KITZIE, NICK VERA (iSchool PhD candidate), and JESSELYN DREESZEN BOWMAN (iSchool PhD student)\n\nCitation: Kitzie, V., Wagner, T.L., Francis, D., Vera, A.N., & Dreeszen Bowman, J.

Paper presented at ALISE Conference 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, October 24–26.\n\nAbstract: This paper addresses limitations of LIS education at the intersection of consumer health, community engagement, and amplifying marginalized voices. The authors propose a curricular outline for an MLIS course on community-based health promotion taught by community health workers (CHWs) who are LGBTQIA+. Queer theory and participatory learning inform this outline, serving as lenses for understanding health information injustices and leveraging community-based strengths to address them. The proposed curriculum utilizes existing research, training, and partnerships between the authors, CHW training specialists, and LGBTQIA+ CHWs. The latter received training using elements of the proposed curriculum and substantiated its offerings with their embodied knowledge and lived experiences. We plan on implementing this curricular outline in 2023.\n\nVANESSA KITZIE and NICK VERA (iSchool PhD candidate)\n\nCitation: Kitzie, V., Vera, A.N., & Wagner, T.L. (2022). Understanding the information creation practices of LGBTQIA+ community health workers. Paper presented at the 85th Annual Association for Information Science and Technology Conference 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, October 29 – November 1.\n\nAbstract: This paper reports on preliminary findings from an action research project partnering health sciences librarians with community health workers (CHWs) who are LGBTQIA+ to create information resources for the CHW's community. Findings report on twelve virtual semistructured interviews with CHWs from South Carolina and eleven virtual brainstorming meetings between CHWs and health sciences librarians. The authors analyzed verbatim interview and meeting transcripts using a combination of deductive and inductive qualitative coding. Findings demonstrate 1) external barriers constrain and motivate information creation; 2) the presence of preexisting information, knowledge, and resources within the CHWs' communities; 3) that CHW-librarian pairs brainstormed how to codify and iterate what already exists; 4) that librarians adopted a reference role when brainstorming and suggested resource ideas within and outside of the CHWs' communities. Implications include strategies that researchers and practitioners can adopt to leverage existing experiential and embodied knowledge within LGBTQIA+ communities.\n\nKIM THOMPSON and ANDREW WAKELEE (MLIS alumnus)\n\nJuried conference paper for ALISE 2022 conference.

Juried paper presented at the Association for Library and Information Science Education 2022 Conference: Go Back and Get It—From One Narrative to Many, 24-26 October, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA.\n\nAbstract: While Spanish is the most spoken non-English language in the United States (US), Spanish-speakers face barriers to information access that may continue to impede their inclusion and careers in libraries. Despite a stated commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, the library profession continues to greatly underrepresent Spanish speakers in its collections and workforce. By looking at Social Identity Theory and the Theory of Information Poverty, we propose ways for libraries to better meet the needs of Spanish-speakers and to better include them in their workforce. This paper details an overview of the theoretical framework, provides a literature review on the Spanish-speaking community’s relationship to libraries, analyzes US job ads data for inclusive wording towards Spanish-speaking applicants, and provides practical steps that libraries can take to make their workforces and outreach programs more inclusive.\n\nJOURNAL ARTICLES\n\nYING YING CHEN, SEI-HILL KIM, JUNGMI JUN, JACOB LONG, ALI ZAIN (SJMC PhD student), COLIN PIACENTINE (SJMC PhD student)\n\nPublic Understanding of Science ranks 26/95 (Q2) in Social Science Citation Index-Communication by its Journal Impact Factor (IF=3.7 in 2021).

Anti-intellectualism Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Discursive Elements and Sources of Anti-Fauci Tweets. Public Understanding of Science.\n\nAbstract: Anti-intellectualism (resentment, hostility, and mistrust of experts) has become a growing concern that influences the public understanding of science during the pandemic. Using topic modeling and supervised machine learning, this study examines the elements and sources of anti-Fauci tweets as a case of anti-intellectual discourse on social media. Based on the theoretical framework of science-related populism, we identified three anti-intellectual discursive elements in anti-Fauci tweets: people-scientist antagonism, delegitimizing the motivation of scientists, and delegitimizing the knowledge of scientists. Delegitimizing the motivation of scientists appeared the most in anti-Fauci tweets. Politicians, conservative news media, and non-institutional actors (e.g., individuals and grassroots advocacy organizations) co-constructed the production and circulation of anti-intellectual discourses on Twitter. Anti-intellectual discourses still resurged under Twitter’s content moderation mechanism. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for building public trust in scientists, effective science communication, and content moderation policies on social media.\n\nYING YING CHEN, SEI-HILL KIM, CHANG WON CHOI (SJMC PhD alumnus)\n\nCommunication Methods and Measures ranks 1/95 (Q1) in Social Science Citation Index-Communication by its Journal Impact Factor (IF=8.04 in 2021).\n\nCitation: Chen, Y., Peng, Z., Kim, S., Choi, C. (Accepted for publication). What we can do and cannot do with topic modeling: A systematic review. Communication Methods and Measures.\n\nAbstract: This systematic review examines 105 empirical studies that applied topic modeling as part of communication research. The review addresses three challenges (theory building and testing, research design, and the assessment of reliability and validity of topics) and seeks solutions from previous studies to advance the application of topic modeling. Regarding theory building and testing, we found that previous studies have mainly used topic modeling to explore the production of communication content on digital platforms. Moreover, we found integrating other analytical methods and merging ready-made or custom-made data will advance research design, helping future studies identify potential predictors and outcomes of the topics in communication messages. Lastly, we found inconsistencies in reporting reliability and validity, indicating that the procedures of topic modeling have not become fully standardized yet. Our review provides implications and strategies for future studies to maximize the strength of topic modeling.\n\nJABRI EVANS\n\nThis article will be published in a special issue of the Journal of Global Hip-Hop Studies focused on the \"Hip-Hop and the Internet.\" The volume is being edited by Dr. Steven Gamble. The female rap artists that I have spoken with over the last two years of field work have described to me a number of ways that Hip-Hop/racial stereotypes still map onto their interactions with their online audiences on social media. Essentially, while they are serving to empower their personal pathways to digital clout and financial success, they are also reproducing the status quo of hyper-sexualized representations of Black female bodies in mass media.\n\nCitation: Evans, J.M.

Findings indicate that respondents felt conflicted in potentially exacerbating stereotypes about women in hip hop music, but also as sexual performers they felt empowered by taking ownership of racial stereotypes, their safety during interactions with men and how their bodies were commodified for pay. Ultimately, this study introduces insights on the digital evolution of hip hop culture’s relationship with sex work and reveals newfound ideological tensions faced by Black women rappers who are using sexual dance economies to adopt new direct-to-consumer business models on the internet (particularly on social media) to self-promote, sustain and develop their careers.\n\nVANESSA KITZIE\n\nCitation: Kitzie, V., Tsai, T., Martzoukou, K., Mabi, M.N., & Greyson, D.

An international lineup of information researchers shares their experiences using the participatory, visual elicitation technique Information World Mapping (IWM) in their work. The authors begin with an overview of IWM, detailing its origins and emerging directions. They summarize their application of IWM to describe information behaviors/practices across various locations, cultures, disciplines, and technology access environments. The authors conclude by discussing key questions and areas of exploration for IWM in information research, including cultural influences, changes in media and methods for data collection, power dynamics, and researcher positionality and reflexivity. Insights offer new possibilities for the next phase of IWM in information research, including challenges and areas for innovation.\n\nPANELS/PRESENTATIONS\n\nCLAYTON COPELAND and KIM THOMPSON\n\nCitation: Charbonneau, D., Copeland, C.A., Dali, K., Mallary, K.J., Smith, A. & Thompson, K.M.

Association for Library and Information Science Education 2022 Conference: Go Back and Get It: From One To Many, Pittsburgh, PA.\n\nAbstract: The COVID-19 global pandemic has presented tremendous health-related challenges that affected workplace dynamics and social interactions. Although effects of the pandemic have been felt worldwide, some communities and individuals have been disproportionately impacted and overlooked in the pandemic response. This ALISE Disabilities SIG session will explore issues around topics related to disability, accessibility, and/or the intersection of both in various LIS educational and library contexts. The proposed session will consist of four interactive panel presentations offering perspectives relevant to the conference theme “From One Narrative to Many,” along with recommendations relevant to LIS educators and practitioners. The overall goal of this panel is to bring attention to the importance of shifting DEI discussions to a more inclusive, and welcoming Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA) framework for everyone, with disability and accessibility as integral parts thereof. The panel session will consist of four panel presentations. Presentation topics include: 1) Examining disability definitions and models, 2) Strategies for incorporating universal design for learning (UDL) into online courses, 3) Experiences of disabled and neurodiverse PhD students in LIS during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 4) Defining barriers and identifying solutions for accessible, inclusive teaching and learning environments. At the end of the presentation, panelists will have an opportunity to interact with attendees to discuss the implications of the presentations for a range of various communities such as students, educators, library practitioners, and community members. To help facilitate an interactive discussion format, attendees and panelists will engage together in small group activities and conversations about practices for addressing some of the most pressing issues and concerns highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, attendees will be asked to reflect and comment on how the presented ideas may be applicable to their respective personal and professional environments and attendees will further be invited to share any additional recommendations.\n\nCLAYTON COPELAND\n\nPresentation for ALISE conference.\n\nCitation: Copeland, C.A. & Mallary, K.J.

We conducted eight semi-structured interviews to collect data from individuals. Content analysis was guided by framework analysis of the interview transcripts. The social factors revealed in the study are social identity, social groups, social authorities, social spaces, social media, and social algorithms. These factors work together and isolate individuals from heterogeneous information. Social identity may decide other factors; correspondingly, the information filtered by social groups, authorities, spaces, media, and algorithms reinforces individuals' social identity. The tendency may reinforce bias on pandemic information and put people at risk. The research may provide an implication to information platforms to reconsider their algorithm designs and a direction for information literacy training programs to break the deficit assumption on individuals.\n\nLink: https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pra2.739\n\nJOURNAL ARTICLES\n\nLEIGH MOSCOWITZ, NANDINI BHALLA (Ph.D. alumna), and JANE O’BOYLE (Ph.D. alumna)\n\nOur article entitled \"Selling Yoga ‘Off the Mat’: A 10-year Analysis of Lifestyle Advertorials in Yoga Journal Magazine\" was just published in the Journal of Communication Inquiry.\n\nCitation: Bhalla, N., O’Boyle, J., & Moscowitz, L.

The most common format was a regular feature, entitled “Off the Mat,” which promotes yoga lifestyle products identified by the magazine as “our partners.” This study also found that yoga-related products and female practitioners were the most common image categories displayed in advertorials. As the use and reach of advertorials increase, in the form of native ads in digital media, this study discusses the implications for the continued commodification of yoga and the role of advertorials in print magazines.\n\nLink\n\nYINGYING CHEN and CINDY YU CHEN (Ph.D. student)\n\nKey implications from the study: First, news media is typically the major source of climate change information for the public and a critical determinant for successful climate change advocacy movements, but our findings reveal that the role of news media in climate change communication is more complicated. News media’s emphasis on political claims and the use of aggressive words did not work toward building public consensus on scientific facts. Particularly, overemphasizing political conflicts by partisan media could mislead the public and foment increasing polarization concerning climate change. Second, aggressive tweets from state actors are impactful in raising public attention to the climate change issue, but they also politicize the issue and could make public opinion more polarized. As social media platforms utilize the impact of state actors to bring more traffic, how the content moderation mechanisms moderate aggressive tweets from the state actors remains an open question for more attention.\n\nCitation: Yuan, S., Chen, Y., Vojta, S., & Chen, C.Y. (2022) More aggressive, more retweets? Exploring the effects of aggressive climate change messages on Twitter. New Media & Society.\n\nAbstract: Although an increasing amount of aggressive and polarized tweets about climate change are being observed, little is known about how they spread on Twitter. This study focuses on how different types of network gatekeepers use aggressive styles and how the styles affect their propagation. The current study employed a computational method and identified 951 influential accounts from 7.25 million tweets about climate change in 2019 and 2020. We analyzed their use of aggression and politicized cues, and the relationship with the volume of retweets. Results showed that even though aggressive tweets were a small portion of the overall tweets about climate change, aggressive tweets were more likely to be politicized and retweeted. Specifically, aggressive tweets from politicians received the most retweets and news media amplified the aggression.\n\nLink\n\nROBERT MCKEEVER, BROOKE MCKEEVER, and GEAH PESSGROVE (Ph.D. alumna)\n\nCitation: Pressgrove, G.N., McKeever, R., McKeever, B.W., & Waters. R.D. (Accepted for publication). Investigating membership retention: employing public relations theory to better understand relationship management. Journal of Nonprofit & Public Sector Marketing.\n\nAbstract: Though nonprofit management literature frequently discusses the importance of communication and cultivating relationships with donors, members, and volunteers, research on how individuals process organizational messages is sparse. This study proposes a model theoretically based on communicative action problem solving that details a sequential chain of communicative actions that predict behavioral intentions to support organizations. Using an online survey of members of a state museum (n = 363), this study found support for how individuals process organizational messages. Specifically, individuals that perceive a strong relationship with an organization are more likely to seek out information from or about that organization. After seeking out information, individuals filter messaging to keep the most helpful content while ignoring other content before ultimately sharing those messages with their personal network. Through sequential mediation analysis, the data supports the hypothesized order of active communication processes and extends the conceptual linkages discussed by nonprofit management literature between organization-public relationships and behavioral outcomes.\n\nLEIGH MOSCOWITZ\n\nOur paper entitled “Well, He Is Paid to Be Violent…”: How Athlete Identity Alters Perceptions of Domestic Violence Incidents was recently published in the Howard Journal of Communications.

(2022). “Well, He Is Paid to Be Violent…”: How Athlete Identity Alters Perceptions of Domestic Violence Incidents. Howard Journal of Communications, 1-16.\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this study is to determine if perceptions of violence related to race, gender and sport will impact audience reactions to domestic violence issues involving an athlete. Specifically, this study will examine how these elements of an athlete’s identity could affect his/her perceived image when faced with domestic violence accusations. A 3 (perceived race) X 2 (gender) X 2 (sport) factorial experiment was conducted using a national convenience sample of 626 participants from Qualtrics Panels. Results provided evidence that an athlete’s race and gender could have an impact on their perception during domestic violence cases, with the male athlete (regardless of the race of the athlete) and the White athlete (regardless of the gender of the athlete) facing more negative perceptions. Furthermore, the violent nature of the sport did not have an impact on the perceptions of the athlete. This study provides further evidence about the role that gender and race play in how domestic violence is perceived during criminal transgressions.\n\nLink\n\nLINWAN WU\n\nExamining the psychological process of developing consumer-brand relationships through strategic use of social media brand chatbots.\n\nCitation: Lin, J-S., & Wu, L. (2022). Examining the psychological process of developing consumer-brand relationships through strategic use of social media brand chatbots. Computers in Human Behavior. DOI: 10.1016/j.chb.2022.107488\n\nAbstract: As brands increasingly integrate artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled automation as part of their communication efforts, marketers have employed social media brand chatbots to provide personalized responses to consumers and facilitate relationship building. However, how specific facets of consumer–brand relationships may be manifested in the process of consumer–brand interaction via social media brand chatbots warrants further investigation. Hence, the current research develops a conceptual model to examine how perceived contingency, a defining psychological determinant of social media brand chatbots, determines consumer−brand relationship outcomes via different motivational experiences and consumer engagement. Based on the survey conducted in the U.S. (N = 491), the findings reveal that perceived contingency is positively related to gratifications of information seeking, social interaction, and entertainment, while information seeking and social interaction lead to enhanced consumer engagement. In addition, consumer engagement helps deepen brand intimacy, strengthen affective commitment, and increase chatbot-related behavioral intention and purchase intention. The findings further show that social-interaction gratification and consumer engagement are crucial components that underline how consumers’ perception of contingency can foster strong, affect-laden brand relationships when marketers capitalize on the conversational capabilities of social media brand chatbots. Theoretical and practical implications, as well as limitations and directions for future research, are discussed.\n\nLink\n\nPANELS/PRESENTATIONS\n\nDENISE MCGILL\n\nMy photograph has been accepted into a juried photo exhibit \"The Everyday Landscape: Contemporary Topographics.\" It features 24 photographers from across the country.

Drawing from a theoretical framework that blends dialogic communication, public relations, and rhetorical message strategies, and digital social advocacy, this study examines the Black Lives Matter and March For Our Lives movements. A Twitter content analysis found that Black Lives Matter and March for Our Lives use the sympathy identification strategy most frequently although this strategy did not generate the most engagement from their followers.

(2022), Do You Agree?: The Psychology and Legalities of Assent to Clickwrap Agreements, Richmond Journal of Law & Technology, 28:4, 623-656.\n\nAbstract: When first accessing a website or online service, users are confronted with terms of service and privacy policies. These terms and policies are adhesion contracts which the user must accept to use the website or service. Virtually all users simply click “I agree” without reading the terms of these contracts. The law construes this as consent based on whether a “reasonable person” would understand that the click constitutes assent to those terms and policies. But studies show that various psychological factors such as obedience of authority can play a role in ill-informed acceptance of such contracts. This article argues that the law should take such psychological factors into account and suggests a framework for doing so.\n\nLink: https://jolt.richmond.edu/files/2022/08/Haun-Robinson-Final-for-Publication.pdf\n\nPANELS/PRESENTATIONS\n\nCANDICE EDRINGTON\n\nI participated in this month's Sydney Lectures panel.

Berlin, Boston: De Gruyter. https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110687262-007\n\nAbstract: The first half of 2020 proved to be very busy as Americans were forced to tackle two pandemics: COVID-19 and racism. While COVID-19 began in other countries before making its way to the U.S., the racial injustices that were taking place in the United States sparked unprecedented protests around the globe. The stay-at-home orders established due to the COVID-19 pandemic forced citizens to not only take a break, but to take inventory of the harsh realizations lived by African Americans every day. Three deaths of unarmed Black people (Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd) over the span of a few months prompted a resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement both online and offline. Although the deaths of Arbery and Floyd received much attention from the media, Taylor’s death was not publicized nearly as much. The lack of media attention surrounding Taylor’s death, in comparison to both Arbery and Floyd, illuminated the intersectional invisibility of Black women and their voices. Created for the purpose of amplifying the voices of Black women, Bozoma Saint John initiated the #SharetheMicNow campaign. This campaign suggested that relationships between White women of power and Black women are a step in the right direction in the fight for social justice. The goal of this chapter is to highlight how White women of celebrity stature allowed Black women activists and celebrities to take over their Instagram accounts for a day to discuss their social justice efforts and to share how others could get involved. Using a case study approach, this chapter seeks to reveal how the #SharetheMicNow campaign used technology to promote dialogue and collaboration during a time of heightened awareness of racial injustice.\n\nLink: https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110687262-007\n\nCONFERENCE PAPER\n\nALI ZAIN and JACOB LONG (SJMC Faculty)\n\nCitation: Zain, A. and Long, J.

However, the effect on message credibility and verification intention was statistically insignificant. Label’s effect also remained the same across mainstream social media platforms. Results showed that effect of label on accessing verified information did not mediate through message credibility and verification intention, indicating participants exclusively relied on heuristic cues to make a behavioral decision as suggested by the Heuristic Systematic Model.\n\nALI ZAIN\n\nCitation: Zain, A.

The mission of librarians is to improve society through facilitating knowledge creation, preservation, and dissemination. When the pandemic began, many libraries closed their doors, yet they took the opportunity to transform their services to various types of formats and continue the provision of essential information and innovative services to their user communities. This poster covers and shares examples of how librarians have stepped up to being leaders in the communities they serve, especially focusing on how librarians have gone far beyond to provide non-traditional library services to their communities, during the pandemic and beyond. It addresses the significance of creating diversified workforce in libraries, as well as how to integrate equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in the libraries' strategic plans. The poster also highlights leadership qualifications in times of crisis, taken from the results of three situation-specific studies on the provision of disaster health-information services by public libraries. Additionally, tips for community engagement will be shared based on results from several information professionals from several different countries.\n\nLUCILIA GREEN, JENNA SPIERING (iSchool Faculty), and JESSELYN BOWMAN DREESZAN (iSchool PhD Student)\n\nCitation: Spiering, J., Bowman, J. D., & Green, L. (2022). A systematic review of K-12 LGBTQIA+ school and public library research. International Association of School Librarianship International Conference, Columbia, SC.\n\nAbstract: To date, an exhaustive examination of LGBTQIA+ topics in international school and public library research has not been conducted. Studies on the topic tend to privilege North American library settings, and are frequently based on previous works published in English, often not considering the varied contexts and cultural issues at play in different countries. The IFLA School Library Guidelines clearly state “school libraries around the world, in their many forms, share a common purpose: the enhancement of teaching and learning for all;” a statement based on a core IFLA value, “the belief that people, communities, and organizations need universal and equitable access to information, ideas and works of imagination for their social, educational, cultural, democratic, and economic well-being” (Schultz-Jones and Oberg, 2015, p. 12). Such inclusivity in school library practice is bolstered by inclusivity in school and children's library research. The study significantly contributes to school and children's library practice by aggregating and presenting school and public library research on LGBTQIA+ students, communities, policies, and issues in an accessible and thematic manner. It further contribute to school and children's library research in two ways: a) by identifying gaps in school and public library research on LGBTQIA+ topics that need to be addressed, and b) by highlighting both problematic and successful approaches, settings, procedures and methodologies in the examination of LGBTQIA+ topics and populations.\n\nLUCILIA GREEN\n\nThis session brings together a collection of presentations highlighting the ways libraries in different communities have harnessed the healing power of reading and literacy in partnership with music, art and other creative efforts, to enable community healing and well-being; reading for the heart, the mind and the soul.\n\nCitation: Green, L.

American Journal of Health Behaviors, 46 (3), 304-314(11). https://doi.org/10.5993/AJHB.46.3.9\n\nAbstract: Objectives: Emerging evidence indicates that young adults who use e-cigarettes can withhold greater exposure to COVID-19 risk. We examine how young e-cigarette users perceive COVID-19 related threat of e-cigarette use and benefit of cessation as compared to traditional ones, applying the health belief model. We investigate changes of such perceptions during the pandemic and their associations with past attempt and future intent to quit e-cigarette use. Methods: We collected responses from US young adults (aged 18-25) who have used e-cigarettes in the past month by conducting 2 waves of online surveys in 2020 (wave 1, N=165) and 2021 (wave 2, N=347). Results: Young e-cigarette users in wave 2 reported greater estimates of COVID-19 and traditional threat as well as COVID-19 and traditional benefit of quitting than wave 1. However, we also found significant increases of e-cig dependence, perceived barriers of quitting, and the percentage of young e-cigarette users (33%) who had never attempted to quit in the past month. Importantly, a COVID-19 benefit of cessation and efficacy of quitting were significantly associated with cessation intent. Conclusions: Ongoing efforts are required to track post-pandemic e-cigarette risk perceptions and behaviors, as well as to identify strategies to mitigate increased dependence and usage of e-cigarettes.\n\nLink: https://doi.org/10.5993/AJHB.46.3.9\n\nAMIR KARAMI, SPRING B.

Among various social media channels, Twitter provides an efficient platform for researchers and politicians to explore public opinion regarding a wide range of topics such as the economy and foreign policy. Current literature mainly focuses on analyzing the content of tweets without considering the gender of users. This research collects and analyzes a large number of tweets and uses computational, human coding, and statistical analyses to identify topics in more than 300,000 tweets posted during the 2020 U.S. presidential election and to compare female and male users regarding the average weight of the discussed topics. Our findings are based upon a wide range of topics, such as tax, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of the topics, there exists a significant difference between female and male users for more than 70% of topics.\n\nLink: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667096822000404\n\nJABARI EVANS\n\nCitation: Evans, J.

Using the narratives of the participants within the program, I draw on participant observation online and in-depth interviews collected to explore the link between the tenets of Connected Learning and digital participation in this artistic community of practice. I explore participants’ work within social media platforms toward building their creative skill, cultivating a public voice, connecting to mentors and communication that strengthens the social bonds within their peer community. This study’s findings affirm prior studies that suggest late adolescence is an important time frame where children are developing social identities online in affinity spaces, but in ways that are tied to civic engagement, self-empowerment and critical skill development for their future pathways. To conclude, I suggest that investigating participant activity on social media platforms as a part of field work can help ethnographers to better connect their impact to the agency and life trajectories of their youth participants.\n\nJUNGMI JUN, MARY ANNE FITZPATRICK (SJMC Faculty), ALI ZAIN (Ph.D. Student), and NANLAN ZHANG (SJMC Ph.D. alumna)\n\nCitation: Jun, J., Fitzpatrick M.

Modeling guided inquiry and school librarian instructional partnerships to pre-service teachers through digital video production. Journal of Education for Library & Information Science. Advanced Access.\n\nAbstract: The last ten years in school library research reflect an expanded definition of information literacy along with a stronger emphasis on in-depth information literacy development, concluding that a fundamental shift in instruction provided by school librarians is needed; one that not only helps students find information, but develops students’ abilities to interact with, and learn from information, engaging with it in critical ways. Collaboratively designed and implemented through an instructional partnership between the school librarian and a classroom teacher, Guided Inquiry instruction helps students gain meaningful understanding and develop a personal perspective by exploring, comparing, and contrasting multiple information sources. Despite the frequently touted benefits of instructional partnerships between school librarians and classroom teachers, these structures are rarely, if ever, modeled by school library and pre-service teacher educators. This study examined the process and challenges inherit in designing and modeling Guided Inquiry units of instruction, through a school librarian instructional partnership model, in pre-service teacher education, exploring its impact on teacher candidate willingness to identify school librarians as co-teachers. Findings from the present study indicate Guided Inquiry units co-taught by school library educators and teacher educators help teacher candidates both successfully navigate the research process and develop a mental model of the school librarian as a co-teacher.\n\nROBERT MCKEEVER, FRANKWADDELL (Journalism faculty, University of Florida), and HOLLY OVERTON (former SJMC faculty)\n\nCitation: Waddell, T.F., Overton, H., & McKeever, R.

Computers in Human Behavior\n\nAbstract: Online data collection services are increasingly common for testing mass communication theory. However, how consistent are the theoretical tenets of theory when tested across different online data services? A pre-registered online survey (N = 1,546) examined the influence of the presumed influence model across subjects simultaneously recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and Qualtrics Panels. Results revealed that model parameters were mostly consistent with the IPI theory regardless of data source. Methodological implications are discussed.\n\nPANELS/PRESENTATIONS\n\nFEILI TU-KEEFNER and ABBY BRICKER (iSchool Grad Student)\n\nCitation: Tu-Keefner, F., Hobbs, A., & Bricker, A. (2022, July 26-29). Fighting an infodemic through accurate, intelligible COVID-19 Information: An analysis of the readability level of authoritative online consumer health information. To be presented at the 87th IFLA World Library and Information Congress, Dublin, Ireland.\n\nAbstract: Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 virus and its variants have affected lives worldwide and have advanced a mistrust of science. The World Health Organization points out that global health professionals, public health professionals, and information professionals have fought not only against this rapidly evolving virus but against an infodemic as well. Because uncertainty, fear, conspiracy theories, and distrust are associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic, the public needs access to accurate information and clear, specific instructions to help them act appropriately. Therefore, source credibility is key to successful risk communication.\n\nDuring this public health crisis, people must be able to identify and access specific and comprehensible information in order to protect themselves and their families. Individuals need information that is easy to understand, makes sense based on their knowledge, is convenient to access, and is easy to use. Also, it must be accurate and come from authoritative sources to aid in behavior changes and health decision-making. Public health experts suggest that a critical component of source credibility is the use of multiple channels, including Internet portals, to disseminate reliable information to those who need it. Therefore, the Internet is a major source for publishing, disseminating, and accessing massive lay- and professional-oriented COVID-19 information because of its 24/7 availability and easy access.\n\nThis study examines the Flesch-Kincaid grade levels of the COVID-19 consumer health information in English published by credible sources (for example, public health agencies) shared on the websites of the public library systems of the twenty largest cities in the U.S. It investigates whether the information provided by these authoritative organizations can support the evidence-based health information access activities of adults from the general public in the U.S. This content analytical study examines the reading level of the resources to see if they are compatible with the guidelines of the American Medical Association for patient education materials (i.e., at a sixth-grade level). The results show that the documents reviewed in the study are not compatible with this reading level. Information provided by authoritative sources must be made easy to understand and access, or it cannot support the fight against the current infodemic. Communication professionals, public health professionals, and information professionals must monitor online COVID-19 consumer health information to assess whether the general public can easily access it and use it for evidence-based problem-solving. Health information specialists must promote the concept of accessing credible information published by authoritative sources by partnering with public librarians to deliver health information literacy-related courses to their users.\n\nKAREN GAVIGAN\n\nPresented a session at the International Association of School Librarian's Conference: The session was entitled Never Forget: Using Graphic Novels to Teach Students about the Holocaust\n\nSHANNON BOWEN\n\nCitation: Governmental Use of Social Media and AI during Disasters, Crises, and Emergency Response, paper presented at BledCom, Slovenia, July 2, 2022\n\nAbstract: Introduction and Purpose. This paper explores the conference theme of whether social media could use a reboot in communicating with stakeholders during disasters, crises, or emergencies. To some extent, this “re-boot” is not optional: it is happening due to rapid changes in technology such as AI and machine learning, and due to social changes and pressures from the sustained crisis of the global Covid-19 pandemic. Literature Review: This study examines the literature of issues management in crises, emergency, and disaster management, as well as government and public affairs, ethics of governmental relations, and applications of artificial intelligence in communication and social media use. RQ: This paper asks, to what extent are public affairs officers (PAOs) - or Public Information Officers (PIOs) - using social media, advanced computational methods, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help manage crises, emergencies, and disasters? Method: Data collection and analyses is still ongoing: Two focus groups and 8 in-depth interviews with 40 PAOs working in governmental agencies were conducted to understand how social media is used during a crisis, the extent to which misinformation interferes with accurate information, and the potential for AI application in optimizing efficiencies during a crisis or natural disaster. Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research. Hurricane response was used as an example in a coastal southeastern state in the USA. This research is illustrative of response in that state but due to variances in states and governing structures, and across nationalities, the conclusions should not be applied to other areas without further study. Future studies could compare and contrast other states, public sector organizations, and nationalities in use of social media and AI in emergencies. Results and Conclusions: Officials detailed the extent to which they used different social media platforms during such an emergency, how media relations takes place, how misinformation is handled (from honest mistakes to maleficent bad actors), and how citizen-stakeholders are communicated with via social media during crises. Participants want an AI that can show sentiment analysis, monitor news sources, measure the reach of their own messages disseminated via social media, and find problematic or incorrect information. Currently, research, data analytics, and AI are little-used in governmental public affairs, especially during crises. This finding shows a need for formative and evaluative research, as well as a potential for marked improvement in efficiencies via AI applications. Practical and social implications. PAOs/PIOs could have a revolutionized ability to identify information reach, flows, provenance, and authenticity as well as to address misinformation on social media via the use of AI. As a computer science team develops the AI supporting this research, the use of AI and machine learning will be tested which can speed the efficiency and accuracy of responses to hurricanes and other crises/disasters. Emergency management could be improved in numerous ways and used in many locales.\n\nSHANNON BOWEN\n\nPresented \"Co:Cast Crisis Observatory\" as the Human-Centered Design Lead, National Science Foundation Expo, Washington DC\n\nVANESSA KITZIE, JESSELYN DREESZEN BOWMAN (iSchool PhD Student), and KATHIA VALVERDE (Arnold School, Center for Community Health Alignment)\n\nCitation: Kitzie, V., Valverde, K., & Dreeszen Bowman, J. (2022). Developing an LGBTQIA+ specialization for Community Health Worker (CHW) training. Poster to be presented at the National LGBTQ+ Health Conference, Chicago, IL, July 28-30.\n\nAbstract: LGBTQ+ populations experience significant barriers to obtaining affirming healthcare. One key barrier is informational, as LGBTQ+ persons find it challenging to learn about their health needs, know what medical professionals to trust, and navigate healthcare systems. These difficulties are the byproducts of LGBTQ+ people left out of formal knowledge production centered on their health issues and needs. This project addresses these inequities by training and certifying LGBTQ+ people as Community Health Workers (CHWs).\n\nCHWs act as critical intermediaries between healthcare systems and their communities, often underserved and experiencing health challenges. CHWs promote community health via outreach, community education, informal counseling, social support, and advocacy. CHW training allows participants to develop the necessary skills to implement these interventions and community action for health promotion. Training functions as an important way to bring LGBTQ+ people to the forefront of conversations in formal spaces like healthcare systems.\n\nPer these acknowledged needs and benefits of CHW training, the project team recruited a cohort of 11 LGBTQ+ community leaders from across South Carolina (SC). SC LGBTQ+ residents experience more severe health challenges than national averages. The cohort received foundational CHW training to enhance core competencies relevant to the emerging CHW profession. The training was facilitated in a participatory learning format focused on sharing the lived experience of training participants and included 161 hours of learning content. Participatory learning allows long-term information retention and application while developing skills in the field instead of short-term retention of theoretical information that may go unapplied.\n\nAfter completing foundational training, this same cohort participated in a 30-hour pilot specialization training for CHWs working with LGBTQ+ people. The training explored unique approaches that could serve LGBTQ+ people while considering the cultural humility necessary to navigate intersectional identities outside the LGBTQ+ umbrella. In addition, the cohort built upon and shared their lived experiences to substantiate the curriculum for future cohorts who may have less knowledge on the given topic.\n\nQualitative evaluation results from the cohort indicated that the combination of foundational and specialty track training allowed them to (a) critically think about their experiences, (b) contribute to training for future peers and allies, and (c) develop skills to apply in their respective communities in the following ways: Using training materials when engaging with health professionals. Developing a community resource guide to support community members. Engaging in advocacy work for trans-inclusive birthing centers in SC. Developing sustained networking opportunities. Further, CHWs at large have expressed interest in taking future iterations of the training to more effectively and inclusively conduct community health work. Significant lessons learned include: Providing a platform to intentionally foster sustained community connections. Providing a neutral party for CHWs to communicate concerns. Emphasizing the need for LGBTQIA+ CHWs because of the context they provide based on lived experience and specialized training.\n\nWhile many lessons were learned, the CHW field, especially as it relates to serving LGBTQ+ populations, still holds unexplored avenues. The information collected from this experience can serve as a solid foundation for those that wish to build upon them.\n\nSPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS\n\nSHANNON BOWEN\n\nIntegration of several recent papers and 1 ongoing project to determine ethics of strategically managing issues with/for stakeholders during difficult times (such as the pandemic, natural disasters, DEI, terrorism, war, and social unrest).\n\nCitation: Strategy under uncertainty: How U.S. organizations respond to socio-political challenges, new ethical and political research perspectives.

(2022). LGBTQIA+ inclusive children’s librarianship: Queer-positive policies, programs, and practices. (approx. 75,000-word book). Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO.\n\nAbstract: This book breaks new ground, offering school and public librarians serving children in grades K–8 a roadmap for implementing and upholding queer-inclusive programs, policies, and services. School and public librarians are serving ever greater numbers of LGBTQIA+ children and families. Transgender children may begin to express a strong sense of gender identity as early as 2–3 years of age. Children are also identifying as gay much sooner than earlier generations—often between the ages of 7 and 12. Additionally, more children than ever before are living with LGBTQIA+ caregivers. In seeking to make our programs and services inclusive and equitable for these growing populations, librarians may court controversy and face community backlash from patrons who feel queer-inclusive content is inappropriate for young children. This book codifies a set of best practices for librarians as they rise to this challenge, defining queer-inclusive programs, identifying potential barriers to implementation, and offering strategies and resources to overcome them.\n\nLink: https://www.abc-clio.com/products/a6348p/\n\nBOOK REVIEW\n\nERIC ROBINSON\n\nA review of Eric Robinson's Cyber Law and Ethics: Regulation of the Connected World, co-written with Mark Grabowski of Adelphi University, said that the internet law textbook \"helps nonlawyers understand the general issues\" and is a \"noteworthy addition[] for any journalism and media communication professor seeking fresh ideas and instructional paths.\"\n\nCitation: Lipschultz, J.

Vaccines, 10(7), 1046. https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10071046\n\nAbstract: The high uptake of COVID-19 vaccines is one of the most promising measures to control the pandemic. However, some African American (AA) communities exhibit vaccination hesitancy due to mis- or disinformation. It is important to understand the challenges in accessing reliable COVID-19 vaccine information and to develop feasible health communication interventions based on voices from AA communities. We conducted 2 focus group discussions (FGDs) among 18 community stakeholders recruited from 3 counties iSouth Carolina on 8 October and 29 October 2021. The FGDs were conducted online via Zoom meetings. The FGD data were managed and thematically analyzed using NVivo 12. Participants worked primarily in colleges, churches, and health agencies. We found that the challenges of accessing reliable vaccine information in AA communities primarily included structural barriers, information barriers, and a lack of trust. Community stake- holders recommended recruiting trusted messengers, using social events to reach target populations, and conducting health communication campaigns through open dialogue among stakeholders. Health communication interventions directed at COVID-19 vaccine uptake should be grounded in ongoing community engagement, trust-building activities, and transparent communication about vaccine development. Tailoring health communication interventions to different groups may help reduce misinformation spread and thus promote vaccination in AA communities in the southern states.\n\nLink: https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/vaccines/vaccines-10-01046/article_deploy/vaccines-10-01046.pdf?version=1656519941\n\nVANESSA KITZIE\n\nCitation: Kitzie, V., Floegel, D., Barriage, S., & Oltmann, S.M. (2022). How visibility, hypervisibility, and invisibility shape library staff and drag performer perceptions of and experiences with drag storytimes in public libraries. The Library Quarterly: Information, Communication, Policy, 92(3), 215-240.\n\nAbstract: This article uses data from interviews with public library staff and drag performers to understand how discourses surrounding queer visibility, hypervisibility, and invisibility affect library staff members’ and performers’ perceptions of drag storytimes. Informed by interviews with library staff and drag performers, we argue that hypervisibility and invisibility narratives mark drag storytimes as dangerous and trendy and may unduly influence how some library staff members view these events. Conversely, other staff members and drag performers engage in significant tactical emotional and physical labor to recognize these events as inherently queer and powerful critical literacy programs. Understanding how varying degrees of visibility mediate library staff and performer perceptions of and experiences with drag storytimes lends insights into larger narratives centered on queerness and belonging within libraries. Drag performers’ narrative accounts also offer paths by which library staff may work with performers to promote authentic queer visibility.\n\nLink: https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/719915\n\nVANESSA KITZIE\n\nCitation: Oltmann, S.

Advance online publication. https://doi.org/10.1177/09610006221100853\n\nAbstract: Drag storytimes are increasingly popular programing events in which drag performers lead storytime in public libraries or other settings; they have been both popular and contentious. In this study, we utilized data from a national survey of 458 library staff and 26 subsequent interviews to investigate connections between drag storytime, intellectual freedom, neutrality, and other core librarianship values. The data was analyzed inductively and several key themes emerged: hosting drag storytimes is an intellectual freedom stance; various perspectives on the American Library Association stance in support of drag storytimes; connections to other core values; emphasizing diversity to serve one’s community; and contesting the neutrality of libraries. We found difficult-to-reconcile stances of “presenting all sides” and “taking a side,” but we suggest a way forward by focusing on the outcome of collective self-governance (based on core values of intellectual freedom and democracy).\n\nPANEL/PRESENTATION\n\nFEILI TU-KEEFNER and ABBY BRICKER (MLIS student)\n\nThis is a conference presentation at the Medical library Association's 2022 annual convention.

Do your general public users understand the COVID-19 health information you have provided? A content analytical study. To be presented at Medical Library Association Annual Meeting & Exhibition, New Orleans, LA.\n\nAbstract: Objectives Because uncertainty, great fear, conspiracy theories, and distrust are associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic, people need access to accurate and easy-to-understand information to help them act appropriately. Major health organizations in the U.S., such as the NLM and the Mayo Clinic, have created web portals to rapidly release authoritative COVID-19 health information to a large population. These resources published via MedlinePlus and Mayo Clinic have been widely promoted for user access in public libraries. It is essential to examine whether these authoritative COVID-19 health information resources facilitate health information access by adults from the general public. Methods This study examines the levels of readability and comprehension of the COVID-19 health information distributed via MedlinePlus and by the Mayo Clinic. The research design for this study is based on Savolainen's everyday life information concepts and Dervin's sense-making methodology. The research purposes are to 1) better understand the connections between readability levels and consumer health information comprehension; 2) investigate whether the authoritative COVID-19 health information provided can support the evidence-based health information access activities of adults from the general public. The sample populations analyzed are identified through accessing the COVID-19 health information shared on the public library systems' websites of the twenty largest cities in the United States. Microsoft Office software is utilized for content analysis and to calculate the averages of the readability scores of the COVID-19 health information provided by the targeted organizations. Results The study examines the reading level of the resources to see if they are compatible with the guidelines of the American Medical Association (AMA) for patient education materials (i.e., at a sixth-grade level). The results show that the documents reviewed in the study are not compatible with this reading level. Information provided via MedlinePlus and the Mayo Clinic must be made easy to understand and access. Conclusions This study shows the readability levels of the commonly used authoritative COVID-19 consumer health information distributed via MedlinePlus and by the Mayo Clinic) are higher than the AMA recommendations for patient education materials. Most of the public libraries and public librarians are not aware of the use of MedlinePlus for user services; education programs must be provided to public librarians and the general public to promote the awareness of MedlinePlus and MedlinePlus Español. Publishers, such as the National Library of Medicine, must strive to lower the readability levels of their COVID-19 consumer health information. Health information professionals need to actively join the force to monitor the readability levels and to produce consumer health information in low grade-level readability on COVID-19, as well as fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and infodemic.

In the present study, a 2 (stock photo and staff photo) by 2 (positive valence and negative valence) study is conducted to examine audience reactions to emotional images in a news context. Within photojournalism research, audience reactions toward neither of the twin photojournalistic values of emotion and credibility have been well studied. Viewer perceptions are measured through: self-reported arousal levels using three 9-point items on a bipolar scale, credibility perceptions using the previously-developed News Photo Credibility Scale, and visual attention using the eye-tracking measures of fixation duration and fixation count.
