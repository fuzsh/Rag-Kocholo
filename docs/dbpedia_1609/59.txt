Aurora Australis Southern Lights

The Aurora Australis Southern Lights, is a mesmerizing natural flux light display that graces the southern hemisphere with its ethereal beauty. This celestial phenomenon, mirroring the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis), occurs in the high-latitude regions surrounding the Antarctic Circle. This captivating solar cycle spectacle is primarily visible in countries like Australia, New Zealand, Antarctica, and parts of South America.

What are the Southern Lights?

The Aurora Australis is a celestial dance of light caused by the interaction of charged particles from the solar wind with interplanetary magnetic fields and atmosphere. These charged particles, mainly electrons and protons, collide with gases in the Earth’s atmosphere, producing vibrant hues of green, pink, purple, and red that paint the night sky.

When and Where to Witness the Aurora Australis Southern Lights?

The sunspot cycle, occurring roughly every 11 years, influences solar activity and creates sunspots. These sunspots lead to increased solar wind, resulting in the captivating aurora, such as the Aurora Australis Southern Lights

The last solar cycle peak occurred in 2013, and the next peak is expected between 2023-2025. This is exciting for aurora enthusiasts, as the intensity of the southern lights aligns with the 11-year solar cycle.

NASA predicts peak solar activity in 2023-2025, making it an ideal time to plan a trip to witness the aurora australis.

The sunspot cycle is linked to magnetic pole reversals every 11 years, completing a 22-year solar cycle. Despite pole changes, the sun’s behavior remains consistent within each 11-year cycle, adding to the allure of this captivating solar dance.

To witness this extraordinary natural phenomenon, one must venture to regions with high latitudes, ideally close to the magnetic pole. The best times to catch a glimpse of the Southern Lights are during the winter months when the nights are longest. We start and finish our seasonal tours according to the Russel McPherron effect; within the Equniox and Solstices or what Scientists call the “equinoctial effect”. Remote locations, away from light pollution, enhance the visibility of the auroras, providing an unobstructed view of the celestial spectacle. PLEASE NOTE: there is no guarantee we will see the Aurora Australis Southern Lights.
