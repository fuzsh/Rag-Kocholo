        "text": "Introduction\n\nEpithelial tissues play a vital role in our bodies. They form the protective outer layer of the body and line the body cavities.\n\nEpithelial tissues are mainly divided into two categories based on the number of cell layers they possess:\n\nSimple Epithelial Tissue\n\nSimple epithelial tissues consist of a single layer of flattened cells that rest on a non-cellular basement membrane made of a network of fibres.\n\nFour main types of simple epithelial tissues exist:\n\nSimple Squamous Epithelial Tissue\n\nSimple Cuboidal Epithelial Tissue\n\nSimple Columnar Epithelial Tissue\n\nPseudo Stratified Epithelial Tissue\n\nFor more details: Tissues\n\nStratified Epithelial Tissue\n\nStratified epithelial tissues have two or more cell layers. These tissues are primarily found within the body cavity and the inner lining of organs.\n\nStratified epithelial tissues are further classified based on cell shape. There are three main types:\n\nTransitional Epithelial Tissue\n\nStratified Squamous Epithelial Tissue\n\nStratified Cuboidal and Stratified Columnar Epithelial Tissue\n\nThe fundamental distinction between simple and stratified epithelial tissues is the number of cell layers. Simple epithelial tissues have a single cell layer, while stratified epithelial tissues have multiple cell layers stacked on top of each other.\n\nLet's delve deeper into the differences between Simple and Stratified Squamous Epithelium."
