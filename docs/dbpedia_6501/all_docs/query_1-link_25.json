        "text": "Stratified epithelia contain two or more layers of cells.\n\nThe function of this type of epithelium is mostly protective - the higher the number of layers, the more protective it is. It is good at withstanding abrasion.\n\nThis type of epithelium is constantly renewing itself. Cells in the bottom layer divide, and the daughter cells move towards surface maturing and then degenerating.\n\nThis type of epithelium can either be keratinising (i.e. the skin) or non-keratinising (i.e. the oesophagus).\n\nStratified squamous keratinising epithelium\n\nThis type of epithelium is protective against chemical and mechanical damage, and water loss, and is found in skin, and oral epithelia.\n\nThis is an example of thin skin. There are around 8-10 layers of cells. It's difficult to see the basal lamina in the region of the dividing cells, in the basal layer. Notice how the cells become more flattened towards the top (apical) layer. Cells at the top are flattened and have flattened nuclei - these cells are dying.\n\nIdentify the keratin, basal and apical layers.\n\nThe oesophagus is an example of a stratified squamous non-keratinising epithelium.\n\nThis epithelium is protective - through its many layers. However, it does not need the layer of keratin, for protection against drying out.\n\nTransitional epithelium is found along almost all of the urinary tract.\n\nIts appearance changes as the epithelium becomes stretched. In unstretched cells (this is what you would normally see in a histological section), the rounded superficial cells bulge out (as shown here)."
