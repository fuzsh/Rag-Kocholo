        "text": "Epithelial cells are the building blocks that pack together tightly and line organs and blood vessels. They make up primary tissues throughout the body. The purpose of epithelial cells is to function as a barrier, protecting the body from mechanical damage, invading micro organisms and the loss of body fluids. Epithelial cells tend to cluster together, and have a tight, pavement-like appearance.\n\nBut this is not always the case, such as when the cells are derived from a tumor. Therefore, detection of epithelial cells has a central role in research and diagnostic of cancer. Biochemical markers allow to make a positive identification. A range of antibodies has been established for detection of individual epithelial cells. Traditional epithelial marker are Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA also called MUC1) and pan cytokeratin. EMA is not produced by all epithelia, though, among them gastrointestinal epithelia and endocervical epithelia. Below you can find a selection of recommended standard markers. If you need a marker for a specific tissue, browse our ful list down below.\n\nRecommended Standard Markers:\n\nanti-Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA/MUC1) antibody\n\nanti-pan Keratin antibody\n\nanti-EpCAM antibody\n\nanti-Cytokeratin 1 antibody\n\nCytokeratins\n\nThe intermediate filament proteins in the cytokeratin group are almost exclusively found in epithelial cells, they make up the major part of the cytoskeleton. This is way they serve as excellent epithelium marker. Until now, 20 different cytokeratins have been discovered, all of which can be organised in two groups: the acidic cytokeratins (type A, 9-20) and the basic cytokeratins (type B, 1-8). Epithelial cells always express a type A cytokeratin together with a type B cytokeratin. They will form a complex, ensuring every epithelium contains at least 2 cytokeratins.\n\nSpecific epithelia can thus be detected by the correct combination of cytokeratin antibodies or with antibodies directed against a single cytokeratin. For example, cytokeratin 15 is a marker of hair follicle stem cells. This immunohistochemical analysis serves the allocation of tumours, or rather the matching of metastases and their primary tumour, because all epithelia and their associated tumours express a certain set of cytokeratins. Therefore, the location of the primary tumour can be limited to certain tissues based on the cytokeratins present.\n\nCell Adhesion Molecules\n\nMost other epithelial markers are cell adhesion molecules, which play a role in the tight junctions between epithelial cells to make them impermeable. Among them E-cadherin, a cell-cell adhesion molecule at the contact areas of epithelial cells. E-cadherin is expressed in all epithelia, except for neuronal epithelium.\n\nThe epithelium specific antigen EpCAM is also a cell adhesion molecule and occurs in most healthy epithelial cells, but not in mucous squamous epithelium like the one in the upper airways and intestine. EpCAM is also a tumour marker, just as CA125 Ovarian Cancer Antigen is, a cell surface protein.\n\nUnder normal conditions, CA125 is additionally expressed in the cornea, conjunctiva, the middle ear and in the trachea.\n\nRecommended antibodies:\n\nE-Cadherin (Cadherin-1,CD324) antibody\n\nEpithelial-specific Antigen (EpCAM) antibody\n\nMarker of Epithelial Cells\n\nBelow you may find the most frequently used markers for epithelial cells including their specificity. By clicking on the antigens in the \"selected antibodies\" column you will reach the corresponding products."
