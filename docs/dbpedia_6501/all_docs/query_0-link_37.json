        "text": "Conjunctival inclusion cysts are thin-walled benign cystic lesions, lined with a non-keratinizing epithelium containing serous fluid. They are usually symptomless but can cause cosmetic disfigurement, reduced motility, foreign body sensation and dry eye due to unstable tear film when they increase in size.\n\nDisease Entity\n\nConjunctival inclusion cyst developed after a trabeculectomy surgery, measuring approximately 1.5 mm. Note deposition of epithelial cells forming a pseudohypopyon. Conjunctival Cyst ICD-9 DATA 372.75 ICD-10 DATA H11.44\n\nConjunctival Cyst is recognized by the following codes as per the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) nomenclature:\n\nICD-9\n\nICD-9 DATA\n\n372.75 Conjunctival Cysts\n\nICD-10\n\nICD-10 DATA\n\nH11.44 Conjunctival Cysts\n\nH11.441 Conjunctival cysts, right eye\n\nH11.442 Conjunctival cysts, left eye\n\nH11.443 Conjunctival cysts, bilateral\n\nH11.449 Conjunctival cysts, unspecified eye\n\nOther links\n\nLinks:\n\nMeSH Website\n\nDisease Database\n\nDisease\n\nInclusion cysts are benign cysts filled with clear serous fluid containing shed cells or mucoid material ( Figure 1).[1]Inclusion cysts constitute 80% of all cystic lesions of the conjunctiva. The average onset age is 47 and occurrence has no gender predilection.[2]\n\nThey are formed from an inclusion of the conjunctival epithelium into the substantia propria, forming a central cystic cavity due to epithelial cell proliferation. The cyst wall is composed of non-keratinized lining epithelium and connective tissue. [3]They can be either primary or secondary, and are usually asymptomatic. Treatment is required if discomfort develops or any impairment of function due to the size.[1]\n\nEtiology\n\nPrimary conjunctival inclusion cysts are congenital. Secondary cysts can be spontaneous or, most commonly, due to inflammatory conditions of the conjunctiva[4], such as pterygium, pingueculitis[5], chronic keratoconjunctivitis[6] and pyogenic granuloma[7], or following ocular trauma[8] or surgery, such as cataract [9], strabismus[10], enucleation[11] or scleral buckle placement[12].\n\nRisk Factors\n\nThe following causes have been cited for secondary conjunctival inclusion cyst:\n\nInflammatory conditions of the conjunctiva (e.g. pterygium, pingueculitis[5], chronic keratoconjunctivitis[6] or pyogenic granuloma[7])\n\nTrauma[8]\n\nSurgery[9][10][11][12]\n\nSub-Tenon anesthesia[13]\n\nGeneral Pathology\n\nA cyst is an abnormal vesicle containing gas, fluid or semi-solid material, with a membranous framework. It can develop in various locations e.g., eyelids, conjunctiva and anterior segment.[14] Post-traumatic or post-surgical cystic formation is often seen.[15]\n\nCyst walls are composed of layers of non-keratinized lining epithelium and connective tissue.[3]\n\nPathophysiology\n\nExcessive invagination of the caruncular epithelium or fornix during embryonic development leads to the formation of primary inclusion cysts.[16] The presentation of these cysts varies from birth to old age.[4] Secondary inclusion cysts can occur either naturally or under inflammatory conditions of the conjunctiva. Anything that causes detachment of a portion of conjunctival epithelium can cause a secondary inclusion cyst, such as surgery or trauma.[8] Sub-Tenon anesthesia is one such example of surgical trauma that can result in an inclusion cyst.[13]\n\nIn addition, it is known that cyst formation involves inflammatory processes, therefore the immune system plays a role. Individual factors, such as autoimmune diseases, can also contribute to changes in the immune response resulting in differing degrees of cyst formation.[15]\n\nPrimary prevention\n\nPrimary conjunctival inclusion cysts cannot be prevented, as it is a congenital disease. Avoiding conjunctival inflammatory processes and ocular trauma can reduce the chance of developing a secondary inclusion cyst.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nHistory\n\nMany patients may be asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients may complain of a \"round lesion\" on the surface of the eye, which may be associated with an increased cyst size or foreign body sensation.\n\nPhysical examination\n\nDiagnosis of conjunctival inclusion cyst is essentially clinical (Figure 3A). Histopathology can confirm the diagnosis, although this is not usually necessary. Slit lamp examination should include a measurement of the size of the cyst, assessment of the characteristics of its wall(s), and internal content, and whether it transilluminates (Figure 3B). The walls are usually thin and translucent. The fluid is usually clear; however, in rare cases, epithelial cells can deposit at the bottom of the cyst and form a pseudo-hypopyon (Figure 4). It is also important to evaluate the eye for signs of previous trauma, previous eye surgery, or active inflammatory processes.\n\nFigure 3. Large conjunctival inclusion cyst in the lower conjunctiva.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSmall conjunctival inclusion cysts are generally asymptomatic or only cause mild sensations indicating the presence of a foreign body. Larger cysts can cause pain, motility disturbance, visual defect or refractive error, and cosmetics concerns. Sometimes, the conjunctiva around the cysts can become injected due to dry eye or from the friction from the edge of a contact lens.\n\nIn a clinical-histopathological study that analyzed different varieties of conjunctival cysts[4], the most common symptoms were, in decreasing order:\n\nProgressive increase in cyst size\n\nCosmetic disfigurement\n\nForeign body sensation\n\nProptosis\n\nOcular motility restriction\n\nBlurred vision\n\nDiagnostic procedures\n\nThe diagnosis of conjunctival inclusion cyst is usually clinical and may be confirmed by pathology; however, there are some imaging modalities that can be useful for diagnosis. Corneal and conjunctival tumors can be visualized by AS-OCT and UBM, two noninvasive imaging techniques. [17]The use of imaging modalities is helpful for preoperative planning, surgical decision-making and to confirm cyst characteristics. Several studies on the quality of AS-OCT and UBM show that they provide useful information about the internal features, extension, size, and shape of the cysts.\n\nUltrasound biomicroscopy (UBM)\n\nUBM is a high-resolution noninvasive tool of great value for the diagnosis of anterior chamber cystic lesions. UBM can assess their content (whether hypodense or hyperreflective) [18] differentiating them from solid lesions.. [19] Through UBM examination, it is possible to define whether the cyst has primary or secondary origin. Consuelo et al. observed that secondary implantation cysts have relatively thick walls and that their content may be hypodense (translucent) with several particles in suspension (probably desquamating epithelial cells - Figure 4) or arranged in hyperreflective concentric layers corresponding to keratin lamellae. On the other hand, primary cystic lesions were characterized by a thin, highly reflective wall with hypodense content.[20]\n\nFigure 5.

Ultrasound biomicroscopy 50 MHZ transducer, immersion technique.\n\nAnterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT)\n\nAS-OCT is ideal for imaging structures from the surface of the eye to the level of the iris. [21]A disadvantage of AS-OCT is that it cannot visualize early pathological changes smaller than 5 μm such as early dysplasia.[21][22]When comparing AS-OCT and UBM, AS-OCT is the better imaging technique for small cystic structures. This is especially useful for nevi as they often contain small cysts. In contrast, UBM is a better technique to determine tumor margins.\n\nFigure 6. Asymptomatic bulbar conjunctival inclusion cyst at the nasal area.\n\nComparison of UBM and AS-OCT showed that UBM had a better tumor visualization and better resolution of the posterior margin. UBM also had a better resolution for pigmented as well as for nonpigmented tumors. However, AS-OCT showed better resolution of the anterior border and better resolution of the anterior segment anatomy. Posterior tumor shadowing was rarely found in UBM images and more common in AS-OCT. The image quality was good in UBM but less in AS-OCT. The study shows that AS-OCT is superior to UBM for the imaging of conjunctival lesions, since AS-OCT offers a higher resolution and conjunctival lesions are superficial and mostly not pigmented.[17][23]\n\nLaboratory test\n\nConjunctival Inclusion Cysts are diagnosed clinically, therefore, laboratory tests are not required.\n\nHistopathology\n\nFigure 7.

After informed consent is obtained, including a review of risks, benefits, and alternatives, the patient is positioned at the slit lamp with their head firmly positioned against the bar. The ocular surface may be cleaned with betadine. Under topical anesthesia of the ocular surface with 0.5% proparacaine, using a 27 or 30 gauge needle attached to a syringe, the cyst can be aspirated. Care must be taken not to puncture conjunctival vessels, or the globe during the procedure. Post-operative care may include a brief period of restrictions (i.e. swimming), the use of antibiotic drops, and / or a follow-up visit.\n\nMedical therapy\n\nGenerally, these cysts may disappear spontaneously; however, persistent cases require treatment. Surgical excision of the cyst is the best treatment, but thermal cautery under slit-lamp visualization[25] or YAG laser of the cyst has also be performed.[9][26]\n\nThere are reports on the application of TCA (trichloroacetic acid ) 20–25% for superficial conjunctival cysts with high success rates, and also reports of TCA 10%-20% injection into conjunctival cysts in ophthalmic and anophthalmic sockets[27], as well as children and multiple cysts, with 100% success (Figure 8).[28] Mihir Kothari et al. reported two cases of conjunctival inclusion cysts following strabismus surgery treated using a paired injection technique, which consists of using two 31 G insulin syringes, one empty syringe (syringe 1) and the other filled with 0.5 mL 70% isopropyl alcohol (syringe 2), simultaneously. The fluid from the cyst is aspirated into syringe 1 as the cyst is simultaneously filled with the alcohol from syringe 2 to prevent collapse. Once all the alcohol from syringe 2 is injected, aspiration (syringe 1) is stopped. The cyst remains inflated and filled with alcohol throughout the procedure. Thirty seconds later, the cyst is emptied by aspirating the alcohol with syringe 1 (Figure 9). There was no recurrence in a nine-month-follow-up.[24]\n\nNejat et al., treated five eyes with conjunctival cysts using atmospheric low-temperature plasma (ALTP) - PANIS method (plasma-assisted non-invasive surgery). Procedure was started by applying a plasma spot on the highest point of the cyst, and then other spots applied in a spiral at the base of the cyst to debulk it. The conjunctival cysts were removed using the white handpiece of the plasma generator device (Plexr, GMV s.r.l Grottaferrata, Italy). They concluded that ALTP can be used as a new approach to treating conjunctival cysts.[29]\n\nSupplementary video of a case series paper \"A Novel Approach to Treatment of Conjunctival Cyst Ablation using Atmospheric Low-Temperature Plasma\" published in the open access journal Clinical Ophthalmology by Farhad Nejat, Khosrow Jadidi, Shiva Pirhadi et al.[29]\n\nSurgery\n\nExcision of the conjunctival inclusion cyst can be performed under topical anesthesia with 0.5% proparacaine, associated with subconjunctival infiltration of lidocaine around the cyst. A non-traumatic tweezer can be used to assist in removal of the cyst. A small incision is made and the blunt tip of scissors introduced between the cyst and Tenon capsule, to separate the cyst from the surrounding tissue. After blunt dissection around the anterior aspect of the cyst, the next step is to carefully free the base of the cyst. Removing the cyst intact decreases chances of recurrence. If there is no conjunctiva remaining for primary closure over the wound, then the scleral bed may be left open or a conjunctival autograft or amniotic membrane may be used to cover the defect. Send the excised presumed cyst to pathology.\n\nCheck the videos below for a better understanding:\n\n1) Surgery video from Figure's 1 patient.\n\n2) This video illustrates the removal of a conjunctival inclusion cyst in inferior fornix, similar to the patient's cyst in Figure 2.\n\nReproduced from Dr. Neeraj Sharma, Aravind Eye Hospital\n\n3) This video demonstrates the simple technique of conjunctival epithelial cyst removal without sutures.\n\nReproduced from Dr. Manju Meena, Pink City Eye and Retina Centre, Jaipur, India.\n\nSurgical follow up\n\nThe follow-up time for each patient who underwent surgical excision of the cysts varies. The photo in Figure 12 illustrates a patient 2 months after excision.\n\nComplications of Surgical Excision\n\nAs the cysts are thin walled, rupture is common during excision. Recurrence is the main postoperative concern. Careful and intact removal of cyst is necessary to prevent recurrence.[4]\n\nPrognosis\n\nPrognosis for conjunctival inclusion cyst is usually very good.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nYou can also visit AAO website to check out this multimedia.\n\nHere is a video showing a large, translucent cyst on the conjunctiva of the eye. This is most likely an epithelial inclusion cyst. These occur when epithelial cells are trapped under the conjunctiva (from prior surgery) and continue to produce mucinoid secretion. This was removed via excision with an attempt to remove the entire cyst wall to prevent recurrence.
