        "text": "What type of epithelial tissue is found in the walls of the urinary bladder to provide it with the ability to distend? a. simple cuboidal epithelium b. transitional epithelium c. pseudostratified columnar epithelium d. stratified squamous epithelium.\n\nShort Answer\n\nExpert verified\n\nThe type of epithelial tissue found in the walls of the urinary bladder that provides it with the ability to distend is \\(b. Transitional epithelium\\).\n\nStep by step solution\n\n01\n\nDefine the Epithelial Tissues\n\nFirst, let's define each type of epithelial tissue: a. Simple cuboidal epithelium: Single layer of cube-shaped cells, found in glands and ducts, functions in secretion and absorption. b. Transitional epithelium: Contains multiple layers of cells that can change shape when stretched, found in the urinary system, allows for distension to accommodate the fluctuating volume of urine. c. Pseudostratified columnar epithelium: Appears stratified but is actually a single layer of cells with a variety of heights, found in the respiratory tract and some glands, functions in secretion and movement of mucus. d. Stratified squamous epithelium: Multiple layers of flattened cells, found in areas of high friction such as the skin, mouth, and esophagus, functions in protection against abrasion.\n\n02\n\nIdentify the Appropriate Epithelial Tissue for the Urinary Bladder\n\nBased on the functions of each type of epithelial tissue, we can determine which one best aligns with the urinary bladder's ability to distend. a. Simple cuboidal epithelium: This type of tissue focuses on secretion and absorption, which does not directly relate to the need for distension. b. Transitional epithelium: This tissue allows for the distension of organs in the urinary system, making it a likely candidate for the urinary bladder. c. Pseudostratified columnar epithelium: This type is specialized for secretion and movement of mucus, which is not particularly relevant to the urinary bladder's function. d. Stratified squamous epithelium: While this type protects against abrasion, it does not aid in providing the ability to distend.\n\n03\n\nChoose the Correct Answer\n\nBased on the descriptions and functions of each type of epithelial tissue, the best match for the walls of the urinary bladder is b. Transitional epithelium. This type of tissue allows for the necessary distension as the bladder fills with urine."
