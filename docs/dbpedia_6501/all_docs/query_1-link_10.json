        "text": "Stratified squamous epithelia have two or more layers of cells, with a superficial squamous layer and basal layers that are usually cuboidal or columnar. Mitosis occurs in this basal layer and the newly produced cells differentiate as they are forced outward. The nuclei of these cells become condensed and eventually disappear as they reach the outermost layers. They are eventually sloughed off at the free surface. This type of epithelium can withstand abrasion because the loss of cells from the surface does not compromise the underlying tissue."
