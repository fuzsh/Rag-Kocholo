        "text": "The cervix, the lower fibromuscular portion of the uterus, measures 3-4 cm in length and 2.5 cm in diameter; however, it varies in size and shape depending on age, parity and menstrual status of the woman.\n\nEctocervix is the most readily visible portion of the cervix; endocervix is largely invisible and lies proximal to the external os.\n\nEctocervix is covered by a pink stratified squamous epithelium, consisting of multiple layers of cells and a reddish columnar epithelium consisting of a single layer of cells lines the endocervix. The intermediate and superficial cell layers of the squamous epithelium contain glycogen.\n\nThe location of squamocolumnar junction in relation to the external os varies depending upon age, menstrual status, and other factors such as pregnancy and oral contraceptive use.\n\nEctropion refers to the eversion of the columnar epithelium onto the ectocervix, when the cervix grows rapidly and enlarges under the influence of estrogen, after menarche and during pregnancy.\n\nSquamous metaplasia in the cervix refers to the physiological replacement of the everted columnar epithelium on the ectocervix by a newly formed squamous epithelium from the subcolumnar reserve cells.\n\nThe region of the cervix where squamous metaplasia occurs is referred to as the transformation zone.\n\nIdentifying the transformation zone is of great importance in colposcopy, as almost all manifestations of cervical carcinogenesis occur in this zone."
