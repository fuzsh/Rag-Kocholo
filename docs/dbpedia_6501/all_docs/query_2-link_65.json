        "text": "mucous membrane, membrane lining body cavities and canals that lead to the outside, chiefly the respiratory, digestive, and urogenital tracts. Mucous membranes line many tracts and structures of the body, including the mouth, nose, eyelids, trachea (windpipe) and lungs, stomach and intestines, and the ureters, urethra, and urinary bladder.\n\nMucous membranes vary in structure, but they all have a surface layer of epithelial cells over a deeper layer of connective tissue. Usually, the epithelial layer of the membrane consists of either stratified squamous epithelium (multiple layers of epithelial cells, the top layer being flattened) or simple columnar epithelium (a layer of column-shaped epithelial cells, the cells being significantly greater in height than width). These types of epithelium are notably toughâ€”able to endure abrasion and other forms of wear that are associated with exposure to external factors (e.g., food particles). They also typically contain cells specially adapted for absorption and secretion. The term mucous membrane comes from the fact that the major substance secreted from the membranes is mucus; the principal constituent of mucus is a mucopolysaccharide called mucin.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nhuman disease: Maintenance of the integrity of skin and mucosal linings"
