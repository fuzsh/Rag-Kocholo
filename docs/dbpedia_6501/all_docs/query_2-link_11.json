        "text": "The Many Faces of Neoplasia\n\nJeremy R. Jass in Understanding Pathology, 2020\n\nThe term ‘stratified’ means that the cells are piled up like the bricks of a wall. Those nearest the top become flattened like slates and are shed. Stratified squamous epithelium occurs in the skin, mourn, oesophagus, vagina and ectocervix. The most common type of cancer occurring in all these sites is a squamous cell carcinoma. In the skin, the flattened cells accumulate a protein within their cytoplasm called keratin. The cells in all squamous epithelia are tightly held together by patches of adhesion molecules forming junctions called desmosomes. These specialised characteristics ensure the squamous epithelium is relatively tough and waterproof. Keratin production and desmosomes may be seen in squamous cell carcinomas of all sites, even those in which their normal counterpart does not produce abundant keratin (e.g. in sites such as the oesophagus and cervix).\n\nImmune function of epithelial cells\n\nPhillip D. Smith, Richard S. Blumberg, Thomas T. MacDonald in Principles of Mucosal Immunology, 2020\n\nIn general, there are two broad histological types of epithelia that line mucosal surfaces: stratified squamous epithelia and simple epithelia, which can be columnar or cuboidal (Figure 5.1). Stratified refers to the presence of multiple epithelial layers that are composed of squamous cells in the vagina, urethra, rectal canal, mouth, esophagus, pharynx, and nasal surfaces. Most often, the stratified squamous mucosa immediately abuts the skin, or is located close to it, and these surfaces do not participate in large-scale selective transport of materials necessary for life. The stratified squamous epithelium that is associated with mucosal tissues is distinguished from the squamous epithelium of the skin by the fact that the former is noncornified, i.e., there is not typically a dense layer of acellular keratin on the apical, i.e., luminal, surface. This can, however, develop in squamous mucosa as a response to chronic injury and is present in some neoplasms, e.g., esophageal verrucous (squamous cell) carcinomas.\n\nRole of Vitamin C in Chronic Wound Healing\n\nQi Chen, Margreet C.M. Vissers in Vitamin C, 2020\n\nThe skin is composed of two main layers—the outermost epidermis and the underlying dermis, with the differing structures of the two layers clearly reflecting their distinct functions. The epidermis is a stratified squamous epithelium predominantly made up of keratinocytes. The keratinocytes closest to the dermis, termed the basal cells, divide, and cells move outward toward the surface, differentiating as they do so (Figure 9.1). During differentiation, keratinocytes lose almost all of their organelles and much of their cytoplasm, they increase production of specialized structural proteins, their cell membrane is replaced by a cellular envelope of cross-linked proteins, and they secrete lipids [2,3]. These changes allow the formation of the outermost epidermal layer, the stratum corneum, which consists of flattened, metabolically inactive cells, now termed corneocytes, sealed together with lipid-rich intercellular domains forming a nearly water-impermeable barrier (Figure 9.1). The stratum corneum interacts with the external environment and fulfills almost all of the physical barrier function of the skin [4]. The epidermis is continually renewing; it takes 30–60 days for new keratinocytes to reach the skin surface [1].\n\nDevelopment and machine-learning optimization of mucoadhesive nanostructured lipid carriers loaded with fluconazole for treatment of oral candidiasis\n\nPublished in Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy, 2021\n\nMohammed H. Elkomy, Mohammed Elmowafy, Khaled Shalaby, Ahmed F. Azmy, Naveed Ahmad, Ameeduzzafar Zafar, Hussein M. Eid\n\nFigure 10 provides the histological photomicrographs of the buccal mucosal tissue (lip) of rabbits isolated from the control group (A), the group received FLZ-NLC (B), and the group received FLZ-CTS-NLC (C). The images are very similar. The structure of the stratified squamous epithelium is normal. Also, the stratum basalis columnar cells are within normal size without any shrinkage. All epithelial cells are tightly packed without intercellular bridge disruption. No nuclear changes are present. The submucosa of all groups shows no histopathological changes. The treated group (Figure 10(B,C)) shows little vacuolation in the stratified squamous epithelium and some epithelial cells show karyolysis which is insignificant. Consequently, the FLZ-NLC and FLZ-CTS-NLC are considered highly biocompatible.\n\nHigher degree of keratinization correlated with severe bone destruction in acquired Cholesteatoma\n\nPublished in Acta Oto-Laryngologica, 2023\n\nYisi Feng, Zhuohao Li, Wuhui He, Ying Xiong, Yu Si, Zhigang Zhang\n\nIn this study, we identified highly keratinized ectopic epidermis in cholesteatoma matrix as a potential inducer of bone erosion. Keratinization is known to be a process involving keratinocyte differentiation, during which proliferative basal cells expressing K5 and K14 are keratinized and transit to the postmitotic suprabasal layer with upregulated K1 and K10. In stratified squamous epithelium, epithelial cells are gradually cornified and die as they move to the superficial cell layer, forming the stratum corneum [13]. Therefore, the expression levels of K1 and K10, as well as the thickness of the stratum corneum, can be regarded as markers of epidermal keratinization. K1 and K10 were also detected in clinical samples of cholesteatoma [14,15]. In the present study, high K10 expression and a thicker stratum corneum in the cholesteatoma matrix correlated with more severe bone resorption induced by cholesteatoma. Animal experiments also supported these findings. The implantation of highly keratinized skin from mouse tails resulted in more damage to mice calvaria. It was suggested that in cholesteatoma, these highly differentiated keratinocytes were induced by fibroblasts from the perimatrix [16]. Furthermore, K1, the ligand of K10, can maintain the integrity and mechanical stress of the epidermis and is involved in decreasing the release of IL-18, which is known to synergize with IL-12 and IFN-γ and inhibit osteoclast formation [17]. Therefore, it was implied that K1 could promote the process of osteoclastogenesis, which suggested that bone destruction tended to be caused by the epidermis that was more keratinized.\n\nTherapy for prevention and treatment of skin ionizing radiation damage: a review\n\nPublished in International Journal of Radiation Biology, 2019\n\nJosé L. Soriano, Ana C. Calpena, Eliana B. Souto, Beatriz Clares\n\nFigure 3 schematizes the main layers of skin. Dermis and epidermis are the two main layers of skin, which are separated by a dermal-epidermal junction protein thin layer called basement membrane. The epidermis is the outer region of human skin, which comes from the embryotic ectoderm and contains no blood vessels. It consists of stratified squamous epithelium primarily composed of keratinocytes and other types of cells such as melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells. The lowest portion of the epidermis is the basal layer, which is in contact with the basement membrane (Larcher et al. 2007). The basal layer contains proliferating cells undergoing continuous division and provides a source of cells that move up through suprabasal layers of the epidermis. Beneath the basement membrane is the dermis. The dermis, which is derived from mesoderm, is an underlying connective tissue that contains nerve and vascular networks, lymphatics, as well as epidermal appendages such as glands (sebaceous, endocrine and apocrine), hair follicles and nails. In both cases, in sebaceous glands and hair follicles, proliferation takes place. The former is in the basal layer of the sebaceous gland, and the latter is in the matrix cells of the hair bulb. Other types of cells in the dermis are fibroblasts, macrophages, and mast cells. Finally, the hypodermis is the connective and adipose tissue underlying the skin and located below the dermis. However, it is not actually considered as a part of skin."
