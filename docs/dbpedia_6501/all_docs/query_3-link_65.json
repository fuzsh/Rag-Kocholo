        "text": "An epithelium is the type of tissue that covers surfaces, usually the linings of hollow organs in the body, or in the case of the skin, the outer surface of the body. In many cases, adjacent epithelial cells are linked by tight junctions so that the epithelium forms a barrier that regulates the movement or substances across it (see the web page on Epithelial Transport). The figure below shows a schematic of a simple epithelium, modeled after the epithelium lining the small intestine.\n\nEpithelia are comprised almost entirely of cells. The apical surface faces the lumen (inside of a hollow organ) while the basal or basolateral surface is adjacent to the underlying tissue. In many epithelia, the apical surface is specialized. For instance, in the small intestine, the apical plasma membrane is folded into microvilli (see below) to increase the surface area for absorption of nutrients. Every epithelium has a basement membrane, that binds the epithelium to the underlying connective tissue. The basement membrane consists of a thin layer of extracellular proteins that is located next to the basolateral surface. Blood vessels do not penetrate through the basement membrane. In practice, the basement membrane is too small to be seen except on an electron micrograph (EM). In the lecture we will look at an EM of the skin epithelium that shows the basement membrane.\n\nEpithelia are classified according to whether they consist of a single layer of cells (simple) or multiple layers of cells (stratified). Epithelia are also classified by the shape of the cells: squamous (flat), cuboidal, or columnar. Be able to identify the following examples, where they are found in the body, and what type of epithelium they are (for example: simple squamous epithelium). Terms shown in purple boldface may appear on a quiz section test.\n\nIn the textbook*, figure 3.10 (p. 78) is a useful overview of different types of epithelia. In this figure, epithelia are classified according to function, as opposed to shape and cell number. Figure 3.15 (p. 86) illustrates the structure of the skin.\n\n*Pages and figure numbers refer to the 8th edition of Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach by Dee Silverthorn.\n\nExamples\n\nEpidermis of the Skin\n\nThe figure at right shows a low-magnification view of thick skin, such as you would find on the surface of your fingertip where your fingerprint is. At this low magnification you can see the three layers in the skin. The outer region is the epidermis, which forms the surface of the skin. The middle region is the dermis, which contains dense connective tissue, blood vessels, and nerves. The innermost layer is the hypodermis, which contains loose connective tissue and adipose tissue, along with sweat glands, blood vessels, and nerves.\n\nThis next image is at higher magnifcation and focuses in on the epidermis. The epidermis is classified as a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium. Cells divide at the basal surface of the epithelium, and as new cells are generated, older cells are pushed towards the apical surface. As cells move apically, they become very flattened (squamous) and they fill up with an intracellular protein called keratin (for this reason, cells in the epidermis are referred to as keratinocytes). This type of epithelium is protective, with the keratin layer acting to protect the underlying tissue from abrasion and dehydration.\n\nThis image focuses on the keratinocytes (purple layer) at high magnification. Note that cells appear dark at the apical surface, where they are filling up with keratin.\n\nOPTIONAL: Melanocytes, which produce pigment, are located on the basal surface of the epidermis. Although they produce pigment, their cytoplasm appears clear in this stain. See if you can find a melanocyte in this picture.\n\nEndothelium\n\nThe endothelium is the simple squamous epithelium that lines all blood vessels. The very smallest vessels, capillaries, are made up of just endothelium. A healthy and intact endothelium acts as a barrier that isolates the blood from underlying tissue, preventing the formation of a blood clots. Endothelial cells also send important signals, affecting things such as tissue growth and blood flow. In the brain, there are tight junctions between endothelial cells, limiting the permeability of the endothelium, and protecting neurons in the brain from toxins and other potentially neuroactive substances in the blood. This functional barrier is known as the blood-brain barrier.\n\nThe image below shows capillaries in the upper part of the dermis. Note how each white space is outlined by a single layer of thin dark cells; this is the endothelium.\n\nSmall Intestine\n\nThis low-magnification view shows the different regions of the small intestine. In the digestive tract and other organs, the layer of tissue next to the lumen is called the mucosa. The mucosa is sometimes called a \"mucous membrane\" because it is covered with a layer of mucus. The mucosa consists of a small amount of connective tissue and a highly folded simple columnar epithelium. The folds of tissue that poke out are called villi (singlular: villus), and the folds that dip down are called crypts. The folding of the epithelium increases the surface area available for absorption of nutrients.\n\nThe image at the left shows part of a villus at high magnification. The absorptive cells (pinkish red) in the simple columnar epithelium are called enterocytes. Scattered among the enterocytes are mucus-secreting cells called goblet cells that stain pale blue. At the apical surface of the enterocytes, there is a dark line which occurs due to a web of proteins that anchor the microvilli, folds of the apical plasma membrane that further increase the surface area for absorption. Another term for the microvilli is \"brush border\". We will look at several EMs that show microvilli in the lecture.\n\nAirway Epithelium\n\nThe airway epithelium lines the passages that conduct air into the lungs. (Airways conduct air into the lungs whereas tiny sacs called alveoli are where gas exchange occurs.) The airway epithelium is classified as a pseudostratified ciliated epithelium. Although it is a simple epithelium, it appears stratified because nuclei of different cells are at different heights, hence the term \"pseudostratified\". An important function of this epithelium is the movement of mucus out of the respiratory tract. Mucus, which is secreted by goblet cells and submucosal glands, traps particles and pathogens. The beating of the cilia, located at the apical surface, moves the mucus toward the pharynx (throat) where it can be swallowed."
