        "text": "Author: Alice Ferng, B.S., MD, PhD â€¢ Reviewer: Uruj Zehra, MBBS, MPhil, PhD\n\nLast reviewed: September 11, 2023\n\nReading time: 10 minutes\n\nKey facts about the simple epithelium Function and classes Function: absorption and filtration processes\n\nClasses: squamous, cuboidal, columnar, pseudostratified Simple squamous Location: blood and lymphatic vessels, air sacs of lungs, lining of the heart\n\nFunction: secrets lubricating substance, allows diffusion and filtration Simple cuboidal Location: secretory ducts of small glands, kidney tubules\n\nFunction: allows secretion and absorbtion Simple columnar Location: bronchi, uterine tubes, uterus - ciliary columnar; digestive tract, bladder - nonciliated columnar epithelium\n\nFunction: allows absorbtion, secretes mucous and enzymes Pseudostratified columnar Location: trachea and most of the upper respiratory tract (ciliated cells)\n\nFunction: secretes mucus which is moved with cilia Clinical relations Metaplasia, dysplasia, neoplasia\n\nThis article will discuss the histology of the simple epithelium.\n\nSimple squamous\n\nSimple epithelium can be divided into 4 major classes, depending on the shapes of constituent cells.\n\nThe cells found in this epithelium type are flat and thin, making simple squamous epithelium ideal for lining areas where passive diffusion of gases occur. Areas where it can be found include: skin, capillary walls, glomeruli, pericardial lining, pleural lining, peritoneal cavity lining, and alveolar lining.\n\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains are one of the most common stains used in histology and viewed under simple light microscopy. Generally, hematoxylin is a dark blue or violet stain that is basic/positive and binds to basophilic substances such as nucleic acids. Therefore, nuclei of cells will appear as round blue structures, and eosin Y is used as a counterstain. Eosin stains eosinophilicstructures in shades of red, pink or orange, and will highlight other structures of the cell.\n\nEndothelium is a type of epithelium found on the inner surface of lymphatic and blood vessels. The endothelial cells that line the vessel are simple squamous cells.\n\nMesothelium is composed of specialized mesothelial cells, which are found as a monolayer of squamous epithelial cells lining the basement membrane and supported by dense irregular connective tissue. Mesothelium is therefore found lining body cavities and organs (e.g., the pleura, peritoneum, pericardium, and male and female internal reproductive organs).\n\nSimple cuboidal\n\nThis epithelium is composed of cells which are roughly equal in height and breadth with spherical and centrally placed nuclei. There are few cases in which microvilli are found on the free surface of the cuboidal cells which are best seen by electron microscopy. The cytoplasm has more organelles like endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria compared to simple squamous, which are responsible for several metabolic and functional activities.\n\nThese cells offer secretory, absorptive, or excretory functions and therefore often provide protection via active (pumping material into or out of the lumen) or passive mechanisms depending on the physiological location and cellular specialization. Due to its function, simple cuboidal epithelium often differentiates to form secretory or ductal portions of glands.\n\nAreas where this type of epithelium can be found include: the surface of ovaries, renal tubule walls (e.g., the small collecting ducts of the kidney or lining of nephrons), the internal walls of the seminiferous tubules of the male testes, the pancreas, the salivary gland, parts of the eye, and follicles the thyroid.\n\nNeed a hand learning the different types of epithelial tissue? Check out our epithelial tissue quizzes and free worksheets.\n\nSimple columnar\n\nIn this type of epithelium, the height of cells exceeds the width of the cell and seem closely packed narrow columns. The apical surfaces of these cells face the lumen and the opposite surface faces the basement membrane. The ovoid nuclei are usually placed towards basal surface.\n\nThis type of epithelium is commonly adapted for secretion, absorption and protection. As a protective epithelium, it lines the minor ducts of many exocrine glands, while as a secretory epithelium it lines the stomach and uterine cervix. As absorptive columnar epithelium is characterised by the presence of striated border on its apical surface. The striated border of the cells is the surface modification of absorptive columnar cells and consist of numerous non-motile minute microvilli which give the striated or brush border appearance on light microscopy and increase the surface area for absorption.\n\nGlandular goblet cells are a type of simple columnar cell that functions to secrete mucins, a major component of mucin. As described previously, the nucleus of a goblet cell is found polarized at the base of the cell (near the basal surface), as well as the other cellular organelles. The rest of this elongated cell type is composed of cytoplasm occupied by membrane-bound secretory granules that serve to secrete mucin, and are polarized towards the apical surface. Goblet cells are found lining the intestinal tracts, respiratory tracts, and conjunctiva of the eye, where the secreted mucus functions to help protect the membrane through formation of a protective mucinous layer that provides lubrication and protects the organ lining from foreign irritants.\n\nSome of the simple columnar cells are lined with motile cilia and therefore termed as ciliated columnar epithelium. Due to the movement of the cilia in ciliated columnar epithelium, this type generally plays a role of clearing or moving substances or very small foreign bodies. Ciliated columnar epithelium is therefore found in the respiratory tract where mucous and air are pushed away to clear the respiratory tract. Other areas where ciliated columnar epithelium is found are the fallopian tubes, the uterus, and the central canal of the spinal cord. In the female reproductive system, the ciliated columnar epithelium lines the lumen of the uterine tube and the movements generated by the cilia propel the egg towards the uterus.\n\nCheck the following study unit for a structured way to learn everything about the simple epithelium.\n\nPseudostratified\n\nThe nuclei of cells in this type of simple epithelium appear at different levels and therefore give a false impression that the cells are in many layers. In pseudostratified epithelium, all the cells reach the basement membrane even though the nuclei will lie at different levels in the tissue, reflective of the irregular layering of tall and thin cells. However, only the taller cells will reach the free surface. Pseudostratified epithelium is also sometimes referred to as respiratory epithelium, since ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelia is mainly found in the larger respiratory airways of the nasal cavity, trachea and bronchi.\n\nPseudostratified columnar epithelium with stereocilia, another sub-classification, can be found in the epididymis, a highly coiled genital duct of the male. Non-ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelia can be found in the membranous part of ductus deferens. Finally, pseudostratified columnar epithelium can also be found forming the straight, tubular glands of the endometrium in females.\n\nSolidify your knowledge about the simple epithelium with the following quiz!\n\nTo go even further, you can check our resources about different types of epithelial tissue!\n\nÂ© Unless stated otherwise, all content, including illustrations are exclusive property of Kenhub GmbH, and are protected by German and international copyright laws.
