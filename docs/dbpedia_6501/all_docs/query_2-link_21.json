The others are connective tissue (support cells, immune cells, blood cells), muscle tissue (contractile cells), and nervous tissue. Organs represent various combinations of these four basic tissue types, which thus comprise the entire body. Each tissue type retains its fundamental character wherever it occurs.\n\nOVERVIEW.\n\nCHARACTERISTICS of epithelial tissue.\n\nContrast with connective tissue.\n\nTERMINOLOGY for describing epithelial tissue.\n\nCOMMON TYPES of epithelial tissue.\n\nGlands.\n\nREPLACEMENT of epithelial tissue.\n\nEpithelial tissue pathology.\n\nExamples.\n\nFor additional introductory exercises, see Ed (The Path Guy)'s Basic Histology Gallery.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe boundary between you and your environment is marked by a continuous surface, or epithelium, of contiguous cells.\n\nThe shape of this boundary is complex, continuing unbroken from skin through various orifices and including the many invaginations into the internal organs of the respiratory, urinary, digestive, and gastrointestinal tracts.\n\nSeveral of the body's organs are primarily epithelial tissue, with each cell communicating with the surface via a duct or tube. Examples include lung, kidney, and liver.\n\nThroughout these organs (with very few exceptions) the epithelial surface remains uninterrupted by any gap between adjacent cells. All exchange of materials and information (nutrients, gases, wastes, sensation, heat) between the body and the environment must take place across this epithelial boundary.\n\nEpithelial tissue thus serves both as a protective barrier for the body and as an active interface with the environment. The structural and functional integrity of this epithelium is vital for normal health.\n\nEpithelial tissue is one of the four basic tissue types.\n\nSeveral features characterize epithelial tissue and distinguish it from connective tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue.\n\nEpithelial tissue covers surfaces with an uninterrupted layer of cells. [More]\n\nEpithelial cells are attached to one another. [More]\n\nIntercellular spaces in epithelium are small. [More]\n\nEpithelial cells are polarized. [More]\n\nEpithelial cell nuclei are typically fairly large and euchromatic. [More]\n\nEpithelial cells are separated from the underlying tissue by a basement membrane. [More]\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nCHARACTERISTICS OF EPITHELIAL TISSUES\n\nNearly all epithelial tissues share some common features:\n\nEpithelial tissue comprises an uninterrupted layer of cells. Epithelium covers nearly all external and internal body surfaces.\n\nEven when an epithelial surface seems to be penetrated by a hole (such as a the pore of a gland) that hole is really just an invagination of the epithelium (i.e., the glandular duct is itself lined by epithelium, and the secretory portion of the gland is also epithelial tissue). [Example]\n\nEpithelial cells are attached to one another. Special devices (intercellular junctions, tonofilaments) provide for structural integrity of the epithelium. There are several types of cell junctions.\n\nAdhering junctions provide mechanical attachment. Their shape may be that of bands (zonulae adherens) or spots (maculae adherens, also called desmosomes). Keratinocytes (epidermal cells) are joined to one another by many desmosomes.\n\nTight (occluding) junctions block diffusion; they typically form a seal or gasket around the apical end of cells comprising simple epithelia (i.e., epithelia comprising only a single layer of cells). This junctional type helps assure adequate separation between different fluid compartments (i.e., between the contents of the intestine and the interstitial fluid of the body).\n\nGap junctions provide direct intercytoplasmic communication between joined cells. That is, ions or small molecules can pass through gap junctions directly from the cytoplasm of one cell into the cytoplasm of an adjacent cell, without passing into intercellular space.\n\nIn typical columnar epithelia, these junctions usually occur in a junctional complex near the apical end of the cell.\n\nIntercellular spaces in epithelium are small. Within the epithelium, the narrow spaces between cells are sealed off from the external environment by cell junctions near the free surface of the cells. Compared to ordinary connective tissue, epithelial tissue has very little interstitial fluid.\n\nEpithelial tissue is polarized. An epithelium has a free surface, the apical surface, exposed to the outside, and an attached surface, the basal surface, resting on the underlying connective tissue.\n\nIn a simple (single-layered) epithelium, each cell is polarized.\n\nThe base of the cell is attached to an underlying basement membrane while the apical end faces free space.\n\nLateral surfaces are attached to neighboring epithelial cells.\n\nIn light microscopy, the junctional complex is sometimes visible as a terminal bar.\n\nA cytoskeletal support of intracellular fibers is also sometimes visible as a terminal web.\n\nPolarization of epithelial cell structure is particularly evident in secretory and absorptive cells where the arrangement of intracellular organelles reflects the directional transport of material.\n\nLess visible but equally important is the localization of membrane proteins, which confer special properties to the membrane (i.e., for cell junctions or for active or passive transport of ions and molecules in and out of the cell), to apical, lateral or basal surfaces of the epithelial cell.\n\nEpithelial cell nuclei are often similar in size and shape. Because typically epithelial cells are metabolically active, their nuclei tend to be fairly large and euchromatic (in contrast to those of most connective tissue cell nuclei).\n\nEpithelial cells are separated from the underlying tissue by a basement membrane. The basement membrane is a thin sheet of collagen and glycoproteins produced in part by the epithelial cells themselves and in part by underlying connective tissue cells (specifically, fibroblasts).\n\nThe basement membrane serves to regulate cell behavior and can limit the spread of some neoplasms.\n\nIn certain places, the basement membrane assumes major significance. (For example, in glomeruli of the kidney it serves as a filter for blood plasma on its way to becoming urine.) In other places, the absence of a basement membrane is notable and functionally significant. (For example, the absence of a basement membrane in the liver permits blood plasma to contact hepatocytes directly.)\n\nBasement membranes are at best inconspicuous in H&E stained preparations, but they can be demonstrated with PAS stain or certain silver stains.\n\nThese common features confer a characteristic appearance upon most epithelial tissues, no matter how various their cells may be. In nearly all epithelia, cells are attached to one another and thus evenly spaced, in distinct contrast with connective tissue cells which are scattered and not attached.\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nCONTRAST WITH CONNECTIVE TISSUE\n\nThe characteristics of epithelial cells (above) contrast with those of connective tissue cells, which are not attached to one another and so tend to be randomly distributed, often with conspicuous spaces containing extracellular matrix in between neighboring cells.\n\nMany support cells and immune cells are typically unpolarized and quiescent, with little cytoplasm and with nuclei containing condensed chromatin (i.e., heterochromatic).\n\nI n contrast, because many epithelial cells are actively manufacturing, secreting, absorbing or dividing, epithelial cells usually have conspicuous cytoplasm and large, relatively euchromatic nuclei (with finely granular chromatin) and with prominent nucleoli.\n\nEach of the following examples illustrates the distinct difference between epithelial tissue and connective tissue. Click on a thumbnail image for an annotated enlargement.\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nDESCRIPTIVE TERMINOLOGY\n\n\"Simple\" signifies a single layer of epithelial cells.\n\n\"Stratified\" signifies two or more layers of epithelial cells.\n\nBy convention, a stratified epithelium is described according to the shape of cells on its free surface. Regardless of whether the surface cells are squamous, cuboidal, or columnar, the underlying cells are usually cuboidal.\n\nPseudostratified signifies that two or more rows of nuclei give the (false) appearance of a stratified epithelium. But because each cell rests on the basement membrane, this is \"really\" a single layer of cells.\n\n\"Squamous\" (from squama, scale) describes cells that are flattened.\n\nSquamous epithelial cells are typically inconspicuous in cross section, appearing as thin lines with a bulge at the nucleus.\n\nA simple squamous epithelium is so thin as to be barely visible by light microscopy.\n\nA stratified squamous epithelium is quite thick, with squamous cells on the surface overlying deeper layers of taller cells.\n\n\"Cuboidal\" describes cells that are rather box-shaped, not flattened.\n\nCuboidal epithelial cells typically appear square or rectangular in cross section, with a round, centrally placed nucleus.\n\nA cuboidal epithelium is typical of glandular ducts.\n\n\"Columnar\" signifies that the cells at the free surface are considerably taller than wide.\n\nBy convention, cells are called columnar if their height is at least twice their width, and cuboidal if not so tall.\n\nA columnar epithelium is often associated with secretion or absorption.\n\n\"Glandular\" describes epithelial tissue found in glands and specialized for exocrine or endocrine secretion.\n\n\"Transitional\" describes a specialized type of epithelium which lines urinary passages.\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nTYPES OF EPITHELIAL TISSUE\n\nThe most common types of epithelial tissue are regularly associated with particular functions and locations.\n\nStratified squamous epithelium consists of flattened (squamous) cells on the surface overlying multiple layers of cells that are usually cuboidal.\n\nStratified squamous epithelium is usually protective. The multiple layers are too thick for efficient transport of materials (neither secretory or absorptive). The innermost layer continually produces cells (via mitosis) to replace those lost from the outer surface.\n\nOuter layers may be keratinized (dead and hardened) on dry surfaces such as skin. Keratinization provides extra protection against abrasion and dessication.\n\nAlternatively, outer layers may be nonkeratinized on wet, mucous surfaces, such as the cornea of the eye, the lining of the upper GI tract (e.g., cheek and esophagus), and the lining of the vagina.\n\nSimple columnar epithelium consists of a single layer of tall (columnar) cells.\n\nSimple columnar epithelium is usually involved in active secretion and/or absorption of material across the single cell layer, or (if ciliated) in movement along the surface. Simple columnar epithelium lines the digestive tract and the female reproductive tract (as well as numerous other surfaces).\n\nA pseudostratified columnar epithelium appears stratified, typically with nuclei located in at least two more-or-less distinct levels. But in fact every cell rests on the basement membrane, so the epithelium is technically \"simple\", in spite of appearances.\n\nA pseudostratified columnar epithelium is characteristic of the respiratory tract and of the ducts in the male reproductive system.\n\nCuboidal epithelium is characterized by boxy (cuboidal) cells comprising the surface layer of the epithelium; if the epithelium is stratified, the deeper layers are also usually cuboidal. Nuclei in cuboidal cells are usually round. (Note that an epithelium is named for the shape of cells in the outermost layer, on the epithelial surface. Both stratified squamous and stratified cuboidal epithelia typically have cuboidal cells in deeper layers.)\n\nCuboidal epithelium is commonly encountered in glandular ducts. Depending on location and cellular specialization, cuboidal epithelial cells may be active (pumping material toward or away from the lumen) or passive (not altering the duct contents). Small ducts typically have a simple cuboidal epithelium. Larger ducts may have a stratified cuboidal epithelium.\n\nSimple squamous epithelium consists of a single, very thin layer of flattened (squamous) cells.\n\nSimple squamous epithelium may be located at sites of rapid diffusion, such as the lining of lung alveoli, the lining of blood vessels (called endothelium), and at sites where very little activity is occuring, such as Bowman's capsule in the kidney and the lining of major body cavities (called mesothelium).\n\nTransitional epithelium, also called urothelium, is a stratified epithelium lining the distensible walls of the urinary tract. The name \"transitional\" derives from this tissue's ability to change its shape from cuboidal to squamous when stretched.\n\nEndothelium and mesothelium are special names given to the lining of certain internal surfaces.\n\nThe entire circulatory system (heart, arteries, veins, capillaries, sinusoids and lymphatics) is lined by a simple squamous epithelium that is called endothelium.\n\n(The inner lining of the cornea is also called \"corneal endothelium,\" but that is a different specialized tissue.)\n\nThe major body cavities (peritoneal, pleural, pericardial) are lined by a mesodermally derived simple squamous epithelium that is called mesothelium.\n\nGlandular epithelium is specialized for secretion Glandular epithelium forms more-or-less complex invaginations of epithelial tissue that lie deep to the surface epithelium that lines obvious external and internal body surfaces.\n\nGlandular epithelium may be differentiated into secretory units (which can be specialized for various products) and ducts (which typically appear less specialized, although ducts may function actively to reabsorb water and thus concentrate the secretory product).\n\nAlthough large exocrine glands like the liver and pancreas may appear solid, each secretory cell has an apical surface exposed to a lumen. This lumenal space, in turn, leads through ducts to the outside of the body.\n\nFor more on glands, click here.\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nREPLACEMENT OF EPITHELIAL TISSUE\n\nCertain epithelia, notably epidermis and intestinal epithelium, are continually recycled, with new cells being created by mitotic activity while old cells are sloughed off (from the surface of the epidermis or the tips of intestinal villi). Many additional epithelial cells (not just those of skin and intestine) have the ability to respond to the stimulus of injury with mitotic activity and cell migration, to regenerate tissue following damage. This confers on most epithelia an \"automatic\" ability to deal effectively with injury by replacing lost tissue with new growth from undamaged edges.\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nEPITHELIAL TISSUE PATHOLOGY\n\nThe surface location of many epithelial tissues exposes them to a variety of insults, ranging from mechanical damage (cuts, scrapes) and active penetration (mosquitoes, parasites, hypodermics) to bacterial and fungal attack and poisoning by toxic chemicals.\n\nIn simple clean wounds of the skin, one of the earliest healing accomplishments may be proliferation and spread of epithelial keratinocytes, re-establishing epidermal continuity in as little as 24 hours. Deep (third degree) burns are so serious largely because they destroy the many epithelially-lined hair follicles and sweat glands that invaginate deep into the dermis and serve as efficient sources of epithelial regrowth after more superficial injury.\n\nThe importance of epithelial cell regeneration is dramatically illustrated by recovery from cholera. A toxin from the cholera vibrio kills the intestinal epithelium. Resulting loss of bodily fluid from the uncovered mucosa leads to copious diarrhea, massive dehydration, and death within a few days. However, if patients can be kept hydrated for those few days, epithelial replacement by stem cell division will restore normal function.\n\nWhen an epithelial cell's ability to divide is stimulated inappropriately, it can result in the formation of a tumor. Cells in epithelial tumors often retain their basic epithelial character, remaining attached to one another and differentiating to form layered structures. As long as the neoplastic cells respect the basement membrane, the tumor will remain localized. But once cells break through this boundary they can enter circulation and metastasize.\n\nThe name carcinoma is applied to any cancer (malignant neoplasm) of epithelial origin; adenocarcinoma names a cancer of glandular origin. (Cancers of mesenchymal origin are called sarcomas.)\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nComments and questions: dgking@siu.edu"
