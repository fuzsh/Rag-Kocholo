        "text": "Groups of connected cells form tissues. The cells in a tissue may all be the same type, or they may be of multiple types. In either case, the cells in the tissue work together to carry out a specific function, and they are always specialized to be able to carry out that function better than any other type of tissue. There are four main types of human tissues: connective, epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissues. We use tissues to build organs and organ systems. The 200 types of cells that the body can produce based on our single set of DNA can create all the types of tissue in the body.\n\nEpithelial Tissue\n\nEpithelial tissue is made up of cells that line inner and outer body surfaces, such as the skin and the inner surface of the digestive tract. Epithelial tissue that lines inner body surfaces and body openings is called mucous membrane. This type of epithelial tissue produces mucus, a slimy substance that coats mucous membranes and traps pathogens, particles, and debris. Epithelial tissue protects the body and its internal organs, secretes substances (such as hormones) in addition to mucus, and absorbs substances (such as nutrients).\n\nThe key identifying feature of epithelial tissue is that it contains a free surface and a basement membrane. The free surface is not attached to any other cells and is either open to the outside of the body, or is open to the inside of a hollow organ or body tube. The basement membrane anchors the epithelial tissue to underlying cells.\n\nEpithelial tissue is identified and named by shape and layering. Epithelial cells exist in three main shapes: squamous, cuboidal, and columnar. These specifically shaped cells can, depending on function, be layered several different ways: simple, stratified, pseudostratified, and transitional.\n\nEpithelial tissue forms coverings and linings and is responsible for a range of functions including diffusion, absorption, secretion and protection. The shape of an epithelial cell can maximize its ability to perform a certain function. The thinner an epithelial cell is, the easier it is for substances to move through it to carry out diffusion and/or absorption. The larger an epithelial cell is, the more room it has in its cytoplasm to be able to make products for secretion, and the more protection it can provide for underlying tissues. Their are three main shapes of epithelial cells: squamous (which is shaped like a pancake- flat and oval), cuboidal (cube shaped), and columnar (tall and rectangular).\n\nFigure 7.4.2 The shape of epithelial tissues is important.\n\nEpithelial tissue will also organize into different layerings depending on their function. For example, multiple layers of cells provide excellent protection, but would no longer be efficient for diffusion, whereas a single layer would work very well for diffusion, but no longer be as protective; a special type of layering called transitional is needed for organs that stretch, like your bladder. Your tissues exhibit the layering that makes them most efficient for the function they are supposed to perform. There are four main layerings found in epithelial tissue: simple (one layer of cells), stratified (many layers of cells), pseudostratified (appears stratified, but upon closer inspection is actually simple), and transitional (can stretch, going from many layers to fewer layers).\n\nFigure 7.4.3 The layerings found in epithelial tissues is important.\n\nSee Table 7.4.1 for a summary of the different layering types and shapes epithelial cells can form and their related functions and locations.\n\nTable 7.4.1\n\nSummary of Epithelial Tissue Cells\n\nSo far, we have identified epithelial tissue based on shape and layering. The representative diagrams we have seen so far are helpful for visualizing the tissue structures, but it is important to look at real examples of these cells. Since cells are too tiny to see with the naked eye, we rely on microscopes to help us study them. Histology is the study of the microscopic anatomy and cells and tissues. See Table 7.4.2 to see some examples of slides of epithelial tissues prepared for the purpose of histology.\n\nTable 7.4.2\n\nEpithelial Tissues and Histological Samples\n\nEpithelial Tissue Type Tissue Diagram Histological Sample Stratified squamous\n\n(from skin)\n\nSimple cuboidal\n\n(from kidney tubules)\n\nPseudostratified ciliated columnar\n\n(from trachea)\n\nConnective Tissue\n\nBone and blood are examples of connective tissue. Connective tissue is very diverse. In general, it forms a framework and support structure for body tissues and organs. It’s made up of living cells separated by non-living material, called extracellular matrix, which can be solid or liquid. The extracellular matrix of bone, for example, is a rigid mineral framework. The extracellular matrix of blood is liquid plasma.\n\nThe key identifying feature of connective tissue is that is is composed of a scattering of cells in a non-cellular matrix. There are three main categories of connective tissue, based on the nature of the matrix. They look very different from one another, which is a reflection of their different functions:\n\nFibrous connective tissue: is characterized by a matrix which is flexible and is made of protein fibres including collagen, elastin and possibly reticular fibres. These tissues are found making up tendons, ligaments, and body membranes.\n\nSupportive connective tissue: is characterized by a solid matrix and is what is used to make bone and cartilage. These tissues are used for support and protection.\n\nFluid connective tissue: is characterized by a fluid matrix and includes both blood and lymph.\n\nFibrous Connective Tissue\n\nFibrous connective tissue contains cells called fibroblasts. These cells produce fibres of collagen, elastin, or reticular fibre which makes up the matrix of this type of connective tissue. Based on how tightly packed these fibres are and how they are oriented changes the properties, and therefore the function of the fibrous connective tissue.\n\nLoose fibrous connective tissue: composed of a loose and disorganized weave of collagen and elastin fibres, creating a tissue that is thin and flexible, yet still tough. This tissue, which is also sometimes referred to as “areolar tissue”, is found in membranes and surrounding blood vessels and most body organs. As you can see from the diagram in Figure 7.4.4, loose fibrous connective tissue fulfills the definition of connectives tissue since it is a scattering of cells (fibroblasts) in a non-cellular matrix (a mesh of collagen and elastin fibres). There are two types of specialized loose fibrous connective tissue: reticular and adipose. Adipose tissue stores fat and reticular tissue forms the spleen and lymph nodes.\n\nDense Fibrous Connective Tissue: composed of a dense mat of parallel collagen fibres and a scattering of fibroblasts, creating a tissue that is very strong. Dense fibrous connective tissue forms tendons and ligaments, which connect bones to muscles and/or bones to neighbouring bones.\n\nSupportive Connective Tissue\n\nSupportive connective tissue exhibits the defining feature of connective tissue in that it is a scattering of cells in a non-cellular matrix; what sets it apart from other connective tissues is its solid matrix. In this tissue group, the matrix is solid- either bone or cartilage. While fibrous connective tissue contained cells called fibroblasts which produced fibres, supportive connective tissue contains cells that either create bone (osteocytes) or cells that create cartilage (chondrocytes).\n\nCartilage\n\nChondrocytes produce the cartilage matrix in which they reside. Cartilage is made up of protein fibres and chondrocytes in lacunae. This is tissue is strong yet flexible and is used many places in the body for protection and support. Cartilage is one of the few tissues that is not vascular (doesn’t have a direct blood supply) meaning it relies on diffusion to obtain nutrients and gases; this is the cause of slow healing rates in injuries involving cartilage. There are three main types of cartilage:\n\nHyaline cartilage: a smooth, strong and flexible tissue. Found at the ends of ribs and long bones, in the nose, and comprising the entire fetal skeleton.\n\nFibrocartilage: a very strong tissue containing thick bundles of collagen. Found in joints that need cushioning from high impact (knees, jaw).\n\nElastic cartilage: contains elastic fibres in addition to collagen, giving support with the benefit of elasticity. Found in earlobes and the epiglottis.\n\nBone\n\nOsteocytes produce the bone matrix in which they reside. Since bone is very solid, these cells reside in small spaces called lacunae. This bone tissue is composed of collagen fibres embedded in calcium phosphate giving it strength without brittleness. There are two types of bone: compact and spongy.\n\nCompact bone: has a dense matrix organized into cylindrical units called osteons. Each osteon contains a central canal (sometimes called a Harversian Canal) which allows for space for blood vessels and nerves, as well as concentric rings of bone matrix and osteocytes in lacunae, as per the diagram here. Compact bone is found in long bones and forms a shell around spongy bone.\n\nSpongy bone: a very porous type of bone which most often contains bone marrow. It is found at the end of long bones, and makes up the majority of the ribs, shoulder blades and flat bones of the cranium.\n\nFluid Connective Tissue\n\nFluid connective tissue has a matrix that is fluid; unlike the other two categories of connective tissue, the cells that reside in the matrix do not actually produce the matrix. Fibroblasts make the fibrous matrix, chondrocytes make the cartilaginous matrix, osteocytes make the bony matrix, yet blood cells do not make the fluid matrix of either lymph or plasma. This tissue still fits the definition of connective tissue in that it is still a scattering of cells in a non-cellular matrix.\n\nThere are two types of fluid connective tissue:\n\nBlood: blood contains three types of cells suspended in plasma, and is contained in the cardiovascular system.\n\nEryththrocytes, more commonly called red blood cells, are present in high numbers (roughly 5 million cells per mL) and are responsible for delivering oxygen from to the lungs to all the other areas of the body. These cells are relatively small in size with a diameter of around 7 micrometres and live no longer than 120 days.\n\nLeukocytes, often referred to as white blood cells, are present in lower numbers (approximately 5 thousand cells per mL) are responsible for various immune functions. They are typically larger than erythrocytes, but can live much longer, particularly white blood cells responsible for long term immunity. The number of leukocytes in your blood can go up or down based on whether or not you are fighting an infection.\n\nThrombocytes, also known as platelets, are very small cells responsible for blood clotting. Thrombocytes are not actually true cells, they are fragments of a much larger cell called a megakaryocyte.\n\nLymph: contains a liquid matrix and white blood cells and is contained in the lymphatic system, which ultimately drains into the cardiovascular system.\n\nFigure 7.4.11 A stained lymphocyte surrounded by red blood cells viewed using a light microscope.\n\nMuscular Tissue\n\nMuscular tissue is made up of cells that have the unique ability to contract- which is the defining feature of muscular tissue. There are three major types of muscle tissue, as pictured in Figure 7.4.12 skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle tissues.\n\nSkeletal Muscle\n\nSkeletal muscles are voluntary muscles, meaning that you exercise conscious control over them. Skeletal muscles are attached to bones by tendons, a type of connective tissue. When these muscles shorten to pull on the bones to which they are attached, they enable the body to move. When you are exercising, reading a book, or making dinner, you are using skeletal muscles to move your body to carry out these tasks.\n\nUnder the microscope, skeletal muscles are striated (or striped) in appearance, because of their internal structure which contains alternating protein fibres of actin and myosin. Skeletal muscle is described as multinucleated, meaning one “cell” has many nuclei. This is because in utero, individual cells destined to become skeletal muscle fused, forming muscle fibres in a process known as myogenesis. You will learn more about skeletal muscle and how it contracts in the Muscular System.\n\nSmooth Muscle\n\nSmooth muscles are nonstriated muscles- they still contain the muscle fibres actin and myosin, but not in the same alternating arrangement seen in skeletal muscle. Smooth muscle is found in the tubes of the body – in the walls of blood vessels and in the reproductive, gastrointestinal, and respiratory tracts. Smooth muscles are not under voluntary control meaning that they operate unconsciously, via the autonomic nervous system. Smooth muscles move substances through a wave of contraction which cascades down the length of a tube, a process termed peristalsis.\n\nWatch the YouTube video “What is Peristalsis” by Mister Science to see peristalsis in action.\n\nWhat is Peristalsis, Mister Science, 2018.\n\nCardiac Muscle\n\nCardiac muscles work involuntarily, meaning they are regulated by the autonomic nervous system. This is probably a good thing, since you wouldn’t want to have to consciously concentrate on keeping your heart beating all the time! Cardiac muscle, which is found only in the heart, is mononucleated and striated (due to alternating bands of myosin and actin). Their contractions cause the heart to pump blood. In order to make sure entire sections of the heart contract in unison, cardiac muscle tissue contains special cell junctions called intercalated discs, which conduct the electrical signals used to “tell” the chambers of the heart when to contract.\n\nNervous Tissue\n\nNervous tissue is made up of neurons and a group of cells called neuroglia (also known as glial cells). Nervous tissue makes up the central nervous system (mainly the brain and spinal cord) and peripheral nervous system (the network of nerves that runs throughout the rest of the body). The defining feature of nervous tissue is that it is specialized to be able to generate and conduct nerve impulses. This function is carried out by neurons, and the purpose of neuroglia is to support neurons.\n\nA neuron has several parts to its structure:\n\nDendrites which collect incoming nerve impulses\n\nA cell body, or soma, which contains the majority of the neuron’s organelles, including the nucleus\n\nAn axon, which carries nerve impulses away from the soma, to the next neuron in the chain\n\nA myelin sheath, which encases the axon and increases that rate at which nerve impulses can be conducted\n\nAxon terminals, which maintain physical contact with the dendrites of neighbouring neurons\n\nAttributions\n\nFigure 7.4.1\n\nConstruction man kneeling in front of wall by Charles Deluvio on Unsplash is used under the Unsplash License (https://unsplash.com/license).\n\nBeige wooden frame by Charles Deluvio on Unsplash is used under the Unsplash License (https://unsplash.com/license).\n\nTambour on green by Pierre Châtel-Innocention Unsplash is used under the Unsplash License (https://unsplash.com/license).\n\nTags: Construction Studs Plumbing Wiring by JWahl on Pixabay is used under the Pixabay License (https://pixabay.com/es/service/license/).\n\nFigure 7.4.2 and Figure 7.4.3\n\nSimple columnar epithelium tissue by Kamil Danak on Wikimedia Commons is used under a CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en) license.\n\nSimple cuboidal epithelium by Kamil Danak on Wikimedia Commons is used under a CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en) license.\n\nSimple squamous epithelium by Kamil Danak on Wikimedia Commons is used under a CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en) license.\n\nFigure 7.4.4\n\nLoose fibrous connective tissue by CNX OpenStax.
