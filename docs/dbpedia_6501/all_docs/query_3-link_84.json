        "text": "Structure and/or Key Feature(s)\n\nGingival epithelium is an umbrella term for the cells lining the external surface of the gingiva, the junctional epithelium, and the epithelium covering the gingival sulcus.\n\nThe epithelium of the attached gingiva is predominantly a parakeratinized stratified squamous epithelial layer. The nature of the epithelium obscures the extensive vascular supply in the lamina propria which gives the tissue its pinkish color. The underlying lamina propria has tall connective tissue papillae and rete pegs which gives the tissue itâs stippled appearance (Fehrenbach and Popowics, 2015).\n\nWhile most oral mucosa is parakeratinized, the marginal gingiva has a distinctive surface layer of orthokeratinized stratified squamous epithelium. Orthokeratinized epithelium is a specific type of epithelium in which the cells of the keratin component are nucleus free. Parakeratinized epithelium, on the other hand, contains nucleated keratinocytes (Wolf and Rateitschak-Pluss, 2011).\n\nThe gingival sulcus is described as the inner surface of the free gingiva which lies next to the tooth. The epithelium of the gingival sulcus is nonkeratinized and described as stratified squamous.\n\nApical to the epithelium and surrounding the neck of each tooth, the junctional epithelium is also a nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelial lining."
