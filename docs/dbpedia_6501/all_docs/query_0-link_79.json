        "text": "Prostatic calcifications are a common finding in the prostate gland, especially after the age of 50. They may be solitary but usually occur in clusters 7.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThey are rare in children, infrequent below age 40, and common in those over 50. Their number and size increase with age 8. Reported prevalence range is very wide and can range between 7-70%11.\n\nClinical presentation\n\nProstatic calcifications are most often an incidental and asymptomatic finding, but they have been associated with symptoms such as dysuria, hematuria, obstruction, or pelvic/perineal pain. Occasionally calcifications can be passed via the urethra 1,2.\n\nPathology\n\nOne of the key mechanisms for development of prostate calcifications is thought to be calcification of the corpora amylacea and simple precipitation of prostatic secretions 9.\n\nEtiology\n\nProstatic calcification may be either primary (idiopathic) or secondary to 2,6 :\n\ndiabetes mellitus\n\ninfections - e.g. tuberculosis or bacterial prostatitis\n\nbenign prostatic hypertrophy - calcification occurs in 10%\n\nprostate cancer\n\nradiation therapy\n\niatrogenic - urethral stents or surgery\n\nAssociations\n\nchronic pelvic pain syndrome 4,5\n\nvoiding dysfunction: rarely reported with large extrinsic calculi 11\n\nlarge prostatic volume 10\n\nRadiographic features\n\nProstate calcifications are most often bilateral and found in the posterior and lateral lobes although unilateral calcification can also be seen.\n\nPlain radiograph\n\nVariable appearance from fine granules to irregular lumps and can range in size from 1 to 40 mm. If there is significant prostatic hypertrophy the calcifications can project well above the pubic symphysis 1,2.\n\nUltrasound\n\nCalcifications appear as brightly echogenic foci that may or may not show posterior shadowing 3.\n\nCT\n\nCalcifications appear as hyperattenuating foci of variable thickness 3.\n\nMRI"
