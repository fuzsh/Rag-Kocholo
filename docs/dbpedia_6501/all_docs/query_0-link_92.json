However, we are not debating Google's method of ranking sites. I could understand the relevance of the above statement if we both would make up our minds by what Google tells us is popular or much linked to. I suppose neither of us does.\n\n<!--QuoteBegin--></div><table border='0' align='center' width='95%' cellpadding='3' cellspacing='1'><tr><td><b>QUOTE</b> </td></tr><tr><td id='QUOTE'><!--QuoteEBegin-->\n\nTBH all those sites saying all those things about circumcision is utter nonsense. Honestly, when has circumcision ever stopped men from masturbating. Further more, if botched circumcision causes 2400 mutilations per year, what about all the people who are similarly crippled by too long or too tight foreskin?<!--QuoteEnd--></td></tr></table><div class='postcolor'><!--QuoteEEnd-->\n\nThe point is not that circumcision stops men from masturbating, which is indeed a very queer supposition. The point is that's the way they thought back in the 19th century. Circumcision as masturbation prevention tool is just one more of the bizarre thesises put forward by doctors of a bygone era to discourage sexual behaviour, since what we now hold as a norm would have seemed highly deviant and perverse to them. Remember that the methods employed to discourage the layman's sexual appetite were, until very recently, mostly rather unpleasant and actually downright unnatural, which has as a result promoted both sadistic and masochistic behaviour as means of trying to find an outlet for repressed sexual urges.\n\n<!--QuoteBegin--></div><table border='0' align='center' width='95%' cellpadding='3' cellspacing='1'><tr><td><b>QUOTE</b> </td></tr><tr><td id='QUOTE'><!--QuoteEBegin-->Further more, if botched circumcision causes 2400 mutilations per year, what about all the people who are similarly crippled by too long or too tight foreskin?<!--QuoteEnd--></td></tr></table><div class='postcolor'><!--QuoteEEnd-->\n\nLike me? Well, I can indeed imagine that if I had less foreskin than now, I'd most likely opt for circumcision. But remember that this would be a choice made by me. The infant does not get a choice, and unless the child suffers from other penile dysfunctions or disfigurements like microp-enis (thanks, swear filter), a too tight foreskin becomes apparent only when the child starts having erections. I can simply not understand why someone would want preventive surgery for something that is extremely unlikely to happen to them, especially when the surgical procedure's complication rate is higher than the incidence of foreskin-related problems.\n\n<!--QuoteBegin--></div><table border='0' align='center' width='95%' cellpadding='3' cellspacing='1'><tr><td><b>QUOTE</b> </td></tr><tr><td id='QUOTE'><!--QuoteEBegin--> WTH?!? People are actually comparing female circumcision to male circumcision?!? Female circumcision, that is to say, removal of the clitoris usually, can commonly renders a woman infertile as well as incapable of any orgasms or sinfections. Female circumcision is plain and simply barbaric. Look at any studies or talk to any (rare in the US) circumcized woman, they will tell you how much they hate it and wish it hadn't happen and how it still causes pain years after the procedure was made. <!--QuoteEnd--></td></tr></table><div class='postcolor'><!--QuoteEEnd-->\n\n\"Can commonly render a woman infertile\"? If this statement had anything to do with reality, then shouldn't FGM-practising societies have been on the decline for a long time? And yes, I am comparing them. Even though the female variant of circumcision is much more brutal and destructive, both operations share common ground in that they are unnecessary genital mutilations. Note that some circumcised males have also reported constant pain that refuses to go away even after years have passed. There's no difference whether the child under the knife is male or female. They should still be able to decide it for themselves when they are mature enough to be able.\n\n<!--QuoteBegin--></div><table border='0' align='center' width='95%' cellpadding='3' cellspacing='1'><tr><td><b>QUOTE</b> </td></tr><tr><td id='QUOTE'><!--QuoteEBegin-->Here it is, Wikipedia's definition of keratinization, a process we all go through every day of our lives. (quote snipped)<!--QuoteEnd--></td></tr></table><div class='postcolor'><!--QuoteEEnd-->\n\nYes, and cancer is actually just cells undergoing uncontrollable mytosis, thus reproducing constantly. It's still harmful.\n\nPenile keratinization means the drying and hardening of the outer shell of the head. A keratinized head looks crackled and wrinkled when not **** (what? e-rect is now a bad word?), unlike an unafflicted head which is smooth. The hardening and drying are not limited to the head alone, but that is the part where it is most noticeable. [skip the following paragraph if firsthand physical observations, which help to understand the issue under discussion somewhat, disturb you]\n\nThe foreskin protects against the drying of the head, a matter I have been able to personally observe. I am unfortunate enough not to have a foreskin big enough to cover the entire head, and also possess a skin type that dries easily, forcing me to apply skin cream to my body every morning after shower so it won't start itching. These two problems combined have resulted in a slightly keratinized head, a process I have managed to stall but not prevent with the application of aforementioned lotions. Unfortunately, nothing beats having a good ol' foreskin, so I must admit that I am somewhat envious to intact men who have a plenty of it.\n\n[edit]I am the king of broken quote tags.[/edit]"
