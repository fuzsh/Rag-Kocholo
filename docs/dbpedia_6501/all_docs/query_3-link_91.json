        "text": "Orthokeratinized Stratified Squamous Epithelium\n\nOrthokeratinized stratified squamous epithelium demonstrates a keratinization of the epithelial cells throughout its most superficial layers (see Figures 9-3 and 9-4). Orthokeratinized epithelium is the least common form of epithelium found in the oral cavity. It is associated with the masticatory mucosa of the hard palate and the attached gingiva. It is also associated with the specialized mucosa of the lingual papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue. As this tissue matures, it forms keratin within its superficial cells, showing a visible and physiological difference in the cells as they migrate superficially.\n\nLike nonkeratinized epithelium, orthokeratinized epithelium has a single basal layer, or stratum basale, undergoing mitosis. This layer also produces the basal lamina of the adjacent basement membrane. Unlike nonkeratinized epithelium, however, orthokeratinized epithelium has more layers superficial to the basal layer: four separate layers with somewhat distinct divisions.\n\nSuperficial to the basal layer is the prickle layer, or the stratum spinosum. This layer is named for an artifact that occurs when the epithelial cells of this layer are dried for prolonged microscopic study; the cells shrink as a result of cytoplasm loss but still maintain their cellular junctions of desmosomes (see Figure 7-5). Thus, a prickly or spiky look results when the individual dehydrated epithelial cells are shrinking but still joined at their outer edges. Once they migrate to this superior a level in the tissue, cells of the prickle layer lose the ability to undergo mitosis, such as noted in the deeper basal layer. The prickle layer makes up the bulk of orthokeratinized epithelium.\n\nSuperficial to the prickle layer is the granular layer, or stratum granulosum. The epithelial cells in this layer are flat and stacked in a layer three to five cells thick. In their cytoplasm, each of the cells has a nucleus with prominent keratohyaline granules, which stain as dark spots. The keratohyaline granules form a chemical precursor for the keratin that is found in the more superficial layers.\n\nThe most superficial layer in orthokeratinized epithelium is the keratin layer, or stratum corneum, which shows variable thickness depending on the region. The cells in the keratin layer are flat and have no nuclei, and their cytoplasm is filled with keratin. This soft, opaque, waterproof material is formed from a complex of keratohyaline granules and intermediate filaments from the cells and stains as a translucent dense material. The outer cells of the keratin layer, or squames, show increased flattening and also shedding or loss, because they are no longer viable.\n\nIn addition, parts of the keratin material are also shed as a result of the turnover of the tissue. However, these squames and their cornified cell envelope make up a major part of the epithelial barrier and are continuously being renewed. The epithelial barrier serves as protection from physical, chemical, and pathogenic attack, as well as dehydration and heat loss, that sometimes occur in the oral cavity environment."
