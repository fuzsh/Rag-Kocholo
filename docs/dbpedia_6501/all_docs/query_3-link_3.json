        "text": "Nonkeratinized\n\nIt is important to realize that the difference between “nonkeratinized” and “keratinized” stratified squamous epithelium (SSE) is not the absence or presence of keratin, respectively. Instead, the distinction lies in the amount of keratinized cells present inside the epithelium because both types actually contain this type of fibrous protein.\n\nNonkeratinized SSE is composed of a variable number of layers. The cells in the deeper, basal layer appear cuboidal with a clear cytoplasm usually, due to their glycogen content. The cells in the surface layer are squamous, or flat. The basal layer is attached to the basement membrane, a sheet of extracellular matrix proteins. It also contains stem cells that are crucial in the self-renewal process. Stem cells continuously divide within the basal layer and migrate towards the apical layer. They replace old cells within this layer, which in turn are subsequently shed as anucleated squamous cells.\n\nNon-keratinized epithelium usually bears a mucous membrane, which serves as an additional protective and lubricating layer of the epithelium. It may be seen in the some parts of the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, distal ureters, vagina and external female genitalia. Nonkeratinized epithelium does contain some keratinized cells, however the amount of keratin deposition will vary depending on the level of dessication and abrasion it may be exposed to. For example, in instances of individuals with a history of chronic smoking or alcohol use, the epithelia of the oropharynx and upper digestive tract can become atypically keratinized. Furthermore, clenching or grinding of teeth against the non-keratinized epithelium of the buccal mucosa may result in the formation of calloused tissue.\n\nAs the amount of keratin is quite low in this sub-class of stratified epithelium, the flat shaped cells retain their normal, characteristic nuclei and metabolic functions.\n\nKeratinized\n\nKeratinzed stratified squamous epithelium is important in tissues exposed to regular physical abrasion, as well as the possibility of desiccation (drying out) and water loss. Keratinized epithelium, is composed of numerous layers of dead squamous cells, which are specially structured to be waterproof and reduce evaporation from underlying tissues. Therefore they constitute an important part of the epidermis or external skin. They are also found in certain regions of the oral cavity (e.g. hard palate, dorsum of the tongue) where eating, speaking and breathing could result to significant loss of water. Keratinized cells are most commonly identified by their anuclear appearance.\n\nSkin\n\nWhile nonkeratinized SSE contains a relatively small amount of keratin, the keratinized sub-class is full of it. The best example of keratinized SSE is the epidermis of the skin. It consists of either four distinct layers in thin skin or five in thick skin. They are called, starting from the deepest:\n\nstratum basale\n\nstratum spinosum\n\nstratum granulosum\n\nstratum lucidum (specific to thick skin)\n\nstratum corneum\n\nStratum basale\n\nThe stratum basale (basal layer) consists of stem cells that continuously divide by mitosis to give rise to keratinocytes. These basal keratinocytes have a small amount of basophilic cytoplasm, closely packed nuclei, and a cuboidal or low columnar shapes. They are arranged in a single layer and contain highly irregular and folded basal surfaces with a high number of hemidesmosomes, which are responsible for the attachment of the stratum basale to the lamina lucida of the basement membrane.\n\nThe basal layer also contains scattered melanocytes. These cells contain specific granules called melanosomes, which are responsible for the production of the precursor to pigment melanin. This pigment gives the skin its characteristic colour and protects against ultraviolet radiation. In routine H&E stains, melanocytes appear rounded with a clear cytoplasm. However, in more detailed examinations, it is clear that melanocytes contain some specific cytoplasmic processes which extend between keratinocytes within the stratum spinosum. These processes are used for transferring melanosomes to keratinocytes, which ultimately situate like a cap over their nuclei.\n\nStratum spinosum\n\nThe stratum spinosum (spinous layer) consists of keratinocytes that have migrated from the stratum basale, located below. The stratum spinosum is in fact multilayered, rather than one discrete and single layer. Keratinocytes also synthesize cytokeratins (intermediate filaments) that subsequently aggregated into tonofibrils. The surface of these cells contains desmosomes, which form intercellular junctions. In this layer, the keratinocytes are shaped like a polyhedron, have round-oval nuclei, prominent nucleoli and cytoplasms. They also synthesize cytokeratins (intermediate filaments) that subsequently aggregated into tonofibrils.\n\nStratum granulosum\n\nAs the keratinocytes continue their migration, they enter the stratum granulosum (granular layer). As the cells mature, they synthesize irregularly shaped keratohyalin granules (densely basophilic) that contain various proteins, such as involucrin, loricrin and filaggrin. These protein types interact with the previously produced tonofibrils, to result in cross-linked intermediate filaments called keratin.\n\nThe keratinocytes also produce lamellar bodies, which are tubular or ovoid shaped granules that are assembled by the Golgi complex. In fact, these bodies are heterogenous mixtures, or assemblies of probarrier lipids, lipid processing enzymes, proteins, and proteases. They can be membrane bound and hence coat the cell’s membrane or secreted within the extracellular space. Their contents allow the lamellar bodies to form an epidermal water barrier, which is hydrophobic. This overall process is called keratinisation (cornification). This is considered a special type of apoptosis because the typical cellular fragmentation is replaced by keratin accumulation. In the epidermis, keratinisation happens continuously. However, its rate can be induced by excessive abrasion. Some examples include incorrectly fitted teeth within the oral cavity (nonkeratinized SSE) or high frictional levels of the skin (keratinized SSE), leading to calluses. Overall, the high amount of keratin makes the epidermis extremely resilient to the constant mechanical abrasion it is exposed to.\n\nStratum lucidum\n\nThe stratum lucidum is apparent only in thick skin, providing protection against increased friction This layer contains visible eosinophilic cells, but as a whole, this layer is highly refractile and stains quite poorly. The cells contain a high amount of keratin, hence the nucleus and other organelles have disrupted morphologies.\n\nStratum corneum\n\nThe stratum corneum is the topmost, non-living, cellular layer of the epidermis composed of terminally differentiated keratinocytes. They are filled with keratin intermediate filaments, giving them quite an irregular and flatter shape than normal. In addition, they are quite thin, anucleated, and have no cytoplasmic organelles, hence they are metabolically inactive.\n\nTheir plasma membrane is also thickened and their pH ranges between 4.5 to 6. At this stage, they are known as keratin squames. Together they form a pattern called orthokeratosis, which is the normal presentation of squamous cells in the stratum corneum, that when together, create a basket-weave pattern. The squames are also coated with an extracellular layer of lipids, allowing them to repel water and make the epidermis and efficient water barrier. In this layer, the process of desquamation happens regularly. It involves the exfoliation and loss of the squames through the degradation of their intercellular desmosomes.\n\nTo review the basics of the epithelial tissue, try out our fully customizable quiz below:\n\nLayers\n\nWhen a respective structure of the urinary tract fills up with urine, the pressure inside increases, subsequently increasing the surface area. To accommodate this phenomenon, the individual cells unfold and flatten. This ability is the reason for the high variation in the number of cell layers observed in nondistended components of the urinary tract, mentioned above. In fact, this number is consistent throughout, being two or three layers.\n\nFollowing hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E), surface cells from empty excretory components are termed umbrella (dome shaped) cells. They have a cuboidal shape and a curved apical surface that bulges into the lumen, giving them a large and rounded appearance. They can also contain two nuclei. However, their appearance is influenced by the extent of distention, so it can vary. Upon examination with the transmission electron microscope (TEM), the cells’ apical surfaces contain regions of modified plasma membrane called plaques. These plaques are especially rigid and thick. They are also attachment points for actin filaments, extending from their inner surfaces into the cytoplasm of the cells. These filaments prevent excessive stretching during distension. Plaques are separated by interplaque regions, which consist of normal plasma membrane. In relaxed states, the plaques are invaginated, forming distinctive fusiform vesicles. However, they are only apparent rather than completely closed vesicles because their lumens are continuous with the cells’ exterior. These vesicles unfold and disappear during distention, as the plaques become part of the cell surface. Umbrella cells also display small vesicles and mitochondria.\n\nAs urothelium is classified as stratified epithelium, it is multi-layered. Underneath the umbrella cells, which are located at the surface, a layer of intermediate cells can be found. They have a pyriform shape and contain long, thin cytoplasmic processes (tails) that anchor the urothelium layers to the basement membrane via special anchoring proteins. Both of those layers originate from basal cells, which form the deepest layer of TE. This single cell layer directly contacts the connective tissue and capillary bed."
