On my way to Comrat, the capital city of GAGAUZIA.

I went there by public transportation and the bus driver was so nice to stop for me at the Welcome to Gagauzia-sign. He was the one who took my picture there ðŸ˜œðŸ˜… even he didnâ€™t understand a word of English ðŸ˜‰

Sunflowers and interesting water wells in a big coffee maker form all the way to Comrat ðŸ˜‰

Gagauzia (officially the Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia) is an autonomous territorial unit of Moldova.

After World War I, the territory of Gagauzia became part of the Kingdom of Romania, then part of the Soviet Union, back to Romania and then incorporated into the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. As the Soviet Union began to disintegrate, Gagauzia declared independence in 1990, but was integrated into Moldova in 1994.
