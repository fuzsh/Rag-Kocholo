        "text": "MOSCOW\n\nA meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the head of Moldova's Turkic-majority autonomous region of Gagauzia has called attention once again to rights of Gagauz Turks and the issues they face.\n\nGovernor of the Gagauz Autonomous Region Yevgeniya Gutul met with Putin on the sidelines of the World Youth Forum in Russia's Black Sea city of Sochi last week.\n\nThe Moldovan administration has opposed the meeting.\n\nThe pro-Russian Shor party under the Gagauzia administration has claimed that authorities in Moldova were preparing to detain Gutul over the meeting, which came on the same day as a meeting between Moldovan President Maia Sandu and her French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in Paris.\n\n\"Our meeting with Macron takes place in the context of new attempts by Russia and its representatives to put additional pressure on my country,\" Sandu said in a statement.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed that Sandu sought to settle a score with Gutul.\n\n\"They are putting pressure on Moldova's regional administrations, trying to prevent their activities, holding mask demonstrations, cutting budget revenues, and since they do not have support within the country, they are looking for this outside Moldova,\" Former Moldovan President Igor Dodon said in a statement.\n\nTension in elections\n\nGutul, a member of the Shor party, won the regional presidential election in Gagauzia in May 2023.\n\nOn the same day as the presidential elections in the region, Moldovan anti-corruption forces carried out searches over alleged \"irregularities\" in the Central Election Commission of the Gagauzia Autonomous Region.\n\n\"There is no doubt that numerous violations were committed in the election,\" Sandu said.\n\nIrina Vlah, then-president of the Gagauzia Autonomous Region, responded to the Moldovan administration by asserting that \"our election bodies are subjected to pressure.\"\n\nVlah underlined that the region's status should be respected.\n\nGutul, who won that election, alleged that she and her family were also under pressure.\n\nProtests were held in Comrat, Gagauzia's capital, due to searches at the election commission.\n\nDespite her electoral victory, Gutul's membership in still awaits approval in the national capital Chisinau, causing further friction.\n\n-\n\nAlthough Gagauz Turks are recognized as a people in Moldova with the autonomy status they gained in 1994, they continue to face problems related to the functionality of their rights.\n\nMuch of the legislation enacted in Moldova since 1994 contradict the establishment law of the Gagauzia Autonomous Region\n\nThis has led to uncertainties on how autonomy is to function and the full use of the powers it grants the local government.\n\nThese uncertainties may lead to dispute on the division of power between the Gagauzia administration and the central government, causing many Gagauz to lose various rights deriving from their autonomy.\n\nThree draft laws have been prepared in 2017 on Moldova's regional structure, decentralization, and local administration, expected to be approved by the Moldovan administration.\n\nMany in Gagauzia want to see the region’s autonomy enshrined in the country’s Constitution.\n\nWhile various reforms are being carried out in Moldova, Gagauzia may not benefit from these due to its special status.\n\nFaced with these conditions, the region is often viewed as an ordinary region in the country.\n\nDue to the uncertainty of its status, Gagauzia was negatively affected by changes made by the central government in the tax system and lost its right to collect taxes.\n\nThe revisions tie tax zones across Moldova to Chisinau, causing difficulties for Gagauz Turks’ economic and social autonomy.\n\nChisinau and Comrat also diverge on policy concerning Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nWhile Moldova has sided with Western states in their support for Ukraine, the Gagauz administration has preferred to remain neutral, while also providing humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.\n\n*Writing by Gozde Bayar ​​​​​​​"
