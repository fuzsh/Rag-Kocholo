Orheiul Vechi is an open-air museum that spans several centuries of Moldovan history. The site includes remnants from various eras, including Dacian, Geto-Dacian, and medieval periods. It provides a unique insight into the life and architecture of past civilizations that inhabited this region. One of the most notable features of Orheiul Vechi is the Cave Monastery, carved into the limestone cliffs by Orthodox monks.

The site also features the remains of ancient fortresses, medieval settlements, and traditional Moldovan houses. In the afternoon, we will return to Chisinau to explore the highlights od the city.

Its impressive walls and towers reflect a blend of Ottoman and European architectural styles. Then, we will continue to the Milesti Mici winery, renowned for housing the world's largest wine cellar - a subterranean network stretching over 200 kilometers. This extensive labyrinth stores approximately 2 million bottles of wine, earning it a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. The winery is celebrated for its high-quality red, white, and sparkling wines, produced using traditional methods and local grape varieties. In the afternoon, we will arrive in Tiraspol, the capital of Transnistria. Transnistria is a thin strip of land wedged between Moldova and Ukraine. It is home to more than 500,000 people and has a parliamentary government, a standing army, and its own currency. It has all the trappings of an independent nation—but isn't. You won't find it on many maps, and not a single member of the United Nations recognizes its existence. Visiting Tiraspol feels like traveling back in time to the period of the USSR. The cityscape is dominated by Soviet-era architecture, monuments, and symbols, including statues of Lenin and Soviet insignia, reflecting its complex political status and historical ties to the Soviet Union. Tiraspol's streets and public spaces are adorned with Soviet-style murals, and many public buildings maintain their original communist-era design. We will spend the night in a hotel in Tiraspol.

In Beshalma, we will learn more about the Gagauz community - an ethnic group with a distinct cultural and linguistic identity. They are known for their unique blend of Turkic language (Gagauz), Orthodox Christian faith, and rich traditions that reflect both their Turkic heritage and the influences of the broader Eastern European region.
