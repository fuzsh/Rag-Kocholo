We can say that Belarus has helped us save our countryside, including in Moldova. Two workshops to assemble Belarusian tractors were set up in Gagauzia, which allowed us to buy equipment at a reasonable price. I hope we will continue our fruitful cooperation and build new contacts,” noted Konstantin Sibov.\n\nChairman of the People's Assembly of Gagauzia Dmitry Konstantinov is confident that the exhibition will help visitors learn more about Belarus. “We have lived side by side with Belarusians for centuries. We have always helped each other. This exhibition will help our people to get to know Belarus better, and above all from an economic point of view. Gagauzia has been cooperating with Belarus for a long time,” he emphasized.\n\nFirst Deputy Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia Ilya Uzun noted that it is Belarus that sets the right vector of development.\n\n“Belarus is one of few republics that have gained true independence. The Belarusian people have a spine. We have a lot to learn from them. This exhibition clearly shows in what direction we need to move. We are only taking the first steps, and Belarus is showing the way. I would like to wish good luck to your people,” Ilya Uzun noted.\n\nSubscribe to us\n\nTwitter"
