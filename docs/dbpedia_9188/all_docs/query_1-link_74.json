        "text": "Description\n\nThe Miras-Moldova reporting project aims to promote the culture of Gagauzia. There is a lack of published information on the traditions of the autonomous region, and volunteers will utilize video and photo reporting to uncover insights about Moldovan ethnic minorities, focusing on the Gagauzian people. Reports on the social and cultural life of Gagauzia will be promoted both within Moldova and to the international community. Volunteers will also inform the Gagauzian society about European integration processes and provide research support to media and local NGOs in need of information. The volunteers are welcome to create and implement their own ideas about how they would like the Gagauzian society to be viewed and raise awareness about this minority internationally.\n\nСместување, храна и транспорт\n\nThe volunteers are accomodated in a big house in the center of Comrat, which is the capital of Gagauzia. The house is fully adapted for the volunteers' needs and is perfectly located. The transportation in Gagauzia is very developed and accessible. All the transportation costs related to the project implementation will be covered by the organisation.\n\nTraining during the activity\n\nWhen carrying out their service, the volunteers will have to attend up to two trainings in Ukraine.\n\nParticipant profile\n\nWe are looking for the volunteers who are interested in Journalism or have an experience in writing, photographing and video editing. The participants are encouraged to send their CVs and motivational letters to be considered. The preferable countries are France, Spain, Austria, Turkey, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, Germany and Czech Republic."
