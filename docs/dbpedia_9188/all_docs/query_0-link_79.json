        "meta_description": "Home to the Gagauz culture, Comrat is a pleasant city and capital of the region of Gagauzia. While Comrat was recognized as a town in the year 1957, the earliest settlements in the town can be traced back to the 18th Century. Renowned for the production of red wine, Comrat is a town of wineries and contributes greatly to the wine industry of Moldova. The architecture has stark Soviet influences with cathedrals and churches in the characteristic onion-shaped domes, like the Russian Renaissance buildings. The Cathedral of St.John the Baptist and adjacent churches with striking yellow walls and silver domes have become de facto defining landmarks for Comrat. A monument dedicated to Vladimir Lenin is another popular tourist attraction. A quaint city, Comrat is a charming place with an air of peace and a culturally rich environment.",
