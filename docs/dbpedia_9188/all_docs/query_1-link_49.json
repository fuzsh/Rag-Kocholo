In the pages of the present paper we propose the analysis of the administration organization of the GagauziÐ° Autonomous Administrative- Territorial Unit of the in RÐµÑ€ubliÑ Ð° MÐ¾ldÐ¾vÐ°, with particularity at the City Hall of Comrat Municipality, in order to highlight its self-determination right. The research carried out shows that their own national emblems - flag, coat of arms, but also the establishment by referendum of their own capital, are prerequisites for the Gagauz autonomy. We found that, from the point of view of the administrative-territorial division, the autonomous territory of Gagauzia is divided into rayons, cities and villages, the Comrat Municipality representing the administrative center of the Gagauz autonomy. In Gagauzia, the local public administration bodies are the Gagauz Bascan, the People's Assembly and the Executive Committee. At the level of Comrat Municipality, the authorities exercising attributions in matters of local interest are the Municipal Council and the Mayor, the latter being assisted by three deputy mayors. From the analysis of the administration organization of the Gagauzia Autonomous Administrative-Territorial Unit, we noticed that it has a special legal status consisting of the right of the gagauz people to self-determination.",
