        "text": "An ambitious wine tourism project\n\nIf you hit the road to the very south of Moldova, in the Gagauzia region, you will notice the road signs are written in Cyrillic, “Russian” letters. You enter the region of Moldova where the locals speak Russian. It is also a wine region called Valul lui Traian where Vinuri de Comrat is located. The winery is included in the Moldova Wine Road “RO-MD Cross Border Wine Tourism Cluster Development”.\n\nThe winery project of Comrat started in 1945 with ambitions and enthusiasm. Before the history of the winery began, during the first half of the 20th century, vodka was produced in the same buildings. Even though the oldest building dates from 1894, the facilities have now been carefully restored. Everyone had their hands full to clean and restore the stone to its original grandeur. “But it is important to keep something from the old times, everything shouldn’t be brand new”, says general director Anatolii Hmelevschi for the BKWine Magazine. “We want to become an important tourist destination, unique for Moldova”, he continues.\n\nThe line of wines\n\nVinuri de Comrat produces about 3mln bottles of wine per year, including red, white and rose, dry, semisweet and sweet wines.\n\nWe have 12 stores of our own products in Moldova:\n\nComrat\n\nCompany store № 1 (str. Vinzavodskaya 1)\n\nCompany store № 2 (Pobedy str.129)\n\nCompany store № 4 (Tretiakov str.19)\n\nCompany store № 1 (str. Lenin, 203)\n\nCahul\n\nCompany store № 1 (Republicii str.12/2)\n\nMagazin de Company store № 2 (Stefan cel Mare str. 26/1)\n\nChisinau\n\nCompany store № 1 (str. Alecu Russo 6, ap.1)\n\nCompany store № 2 (Gh. Asachi str., 52)\n\nCompany store № 3 (Minsk str., 49/1)\n\nCompany store № 4 (Dacia str., 10)\n\nCompany store № 5 (P.Zadnipru str., 1/2)\n\nCompany store № 6 (E.
