        "text": "„The autonomous territorial unit with special legal status \" Gagauzia was created in 1995 as „a form of the Gagauzia people’s external self-determination.\" By giving to ATU Gagauzia a special legal regime, the Moldovan legislature demonstrated a preferential interpretation of the concept of local autonomy. A local territorial collectivity of the II level acquired, on the basis of ethnicity, a high degree of autonomy compared to similar local territorial collectivities. The following consequences of ATU Gagauzia creation are outlined: the establishment of the privileged conditions of development for a local territorial collectivity on the basis of ethnical principle; fostering the collective rights for ethnic minorities; the territorial fragmentation of the administrative territorial units; the discrimination and marginalization of Moldovans from localities of Gagauzia; awarding expanded powers to the Assembly of Gagauzia comparative to the district Councils; the influence of the external factors on the processes from Gagauzia; fostering the isolationist and separatist tendencies. The European option of Moldova requires the shift of emphasis to the local initiative and strengthening the regional centers, being necessary a rethinking of the existing administrative-territorial structure. It is clear that current territorial fragmentation does not contribute to the local economic development and it does not favor to the formation of the cooperative relationships between central authorities and local ones. Therefore, the need of territorial administrative delimitation reform is obvious. Moldova should avoid the award of special autonomies based on the ethnic principles or under the pro-imperial pressure. The reform should be carried out in the spirit of the principles of the European Charter of Local Self-Government.\n\nThis article describes the process of self-determination and the creation of a territorial autonomy of the Gagauz people in the Republic of Moldova. It also analyses the situation in the autonomy after the change of government in Chisinau in 2009 and evaluates the current status of accommodation of the Gagauz’ interests in the country. Aspects of state-building and the influence of external actors are explored as well. Gagauzia (Gagauz Yeri) is one of the first post-Soviet autonomies. Since its establishment in 1994, no violent conflict has taken place there. However, the Gagauz language and culture remain relatively unprotected, and incentives as well as support for the integration of the Gagauz are low. The article outlines the potential for future disputes between the central government and local authorities, due to continuous attempts to limit Gagauzia’s self-governance and conflicting interpretations of how the autonomy should work. Furthermore, struggles between Gagauz political leaders and other local realities hamper the successful realization of Gagauz Yeri. With respect to Moldova’s efforts to resolve the Transnistrian conflict and to integrate with the European Union, compromises and cooperation through an ongoing dialogue between the centre and autonomy are clearly due. Resolving the remaining stumbling blocks could make Gagauzia a living, rather than symbolic autonomy.\n\nIn southern Bessarabia, a multi-ethnic region on the Moldovan-Ukrainian border, one ethnic group, the Turkic speaking Gagauz, have managed to negotiate a unique autonomy status with the Moldovan government in 1994. Neither their Bulgarian neighbours nor the Gagauz on the Ukrainian side of the border have achieved a similar degree of political autonomy. The analysis presented here looks into the historical factors that enabled autonomy for the Gagauz in Moldova. It wraps up the literature on the emergence of the autonomy status and draws on interviews with activists and educators. It appears that a unique geopolitical constellation was more decisive for the achievement of autonomy than local or national ethno-politics. The comparison with neighbouring groups suggests that under the precarious economic circumstances in the region, the effect of autonomy on the preservation of language was rather small. The main effect of the autonomy was that the Gagauz elite had the means to adopt their own geopolitical position, sometimes contradicting the central government. With the beginning of the Ukrainian Russian conflict in 2014 this characteristic of Gagauz autonomy came to be seen as a potentially dangerous precedent in Ukraine.\n\nA pro-Communist and pro-Russian separatist movement emerged and came to power in the Gagauzia region of Moldova in the late Soviet Union by declaring a republic there. But this conflict remained largely non-violent, in contrast to such pro-Russian regions as Transdniestria in Moldova and Donbas in Ukraine. This conflict was resolved peacefully as a result of a compromise agreement between the Gagauz separatists and the central government of Moldova. This deal established the Gagauz autonomy with a right to collect and keep all major tax revenues and a right to secede if Moldova were to join Romania. This study shows that the autonomy status of Gagauzia was successful in prevention of armed conflict there. However, the autonomous status did not end regional political divisions and did not end or significantly diminished support for separatism and pro-Communist and pro-Russian orientation in Gagauzia. The parliamentary, presidential, and local election results and public opinion polls consistently showed much stronger support for pro-Communist/pro-Russian candidates in the Gagauz autonomy, compared to the rest of Moldova, with the exception of pro-Russian Transdniestrian Republic. The distinct political values and pro-Russian orientation of the Gagauz in independent Moldova were linked to the historical experiences of this Turkic and Orthodox people. The critical juncture in the evolution of Gagauz political culture was the nineteenth-century mass migration of the Gagauz people from Bulgaria to the Southern part of Moldova, with the aid of the Russian government, to avoid persecution as a Christian Orthodox minority in the Ottoman Empire. The distinct historical experience of the Gagauz shaped their political behavior and attitudes during the post-Communist period. The fiscal relations between Gagauzia and the national government of Moldova also experienced a certain conflict over tax revenues remaining in the autonomous region. But the tensions in the fiscal relations were much less significant than the political and geopolitical divides and Gagauzia retained the right to keep all major tax revenues collected on its territory. Since Gagauzia remained one of the least developed and urbanized regions in Moldova, the Gagauz budget increasingly relied on transfers from the state budget of Moldova. This study suggests that the Gagauz autonomy and its fiscal relations with Moldova can serve as a model of successful peaceful resolution of a separatist conflict even though they unlikely to significantly diminish political and geopolitical divisions with the central government. But such a model would be most applicable to cases of minority regions, autonomous regions, and non-violent separatist conflicts in order to prevent or resolve such conflicts and, especially, to prevent them from turning violent. However, the Gagauz autonomy model failed to resolve the conflict in similarly pro-Russian Transdniestria region in Moldova. This suggests that such model would be problematic in resolving conflicts in separatist regions after these regions experienced armed conflicts and gained de facto independence, such as Transdniestria or Donbas. For example, the Gagauz autonomy model might have helped to prevent the separatist conflict in pro-Russian Donbas in Eastern Ukraine from turning into a civil war in 2014, but it would not be accepted after this region experienced a civil war and Russian military interventions and became de facto independent. The same applies to various other countries with similar minority regions, autonomous regions, or separatist regions."
