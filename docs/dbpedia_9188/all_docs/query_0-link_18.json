The two are watching over a future fun park, though there’s little to protect beyond some new streetlights, a pile of timber and a scaffolding arch that will carry its name: GagauziaLand.\n\nA field in one of Europe’s poorest countries may seem like an inauspicious place for a family attraction, but the site isn’t just an amusement park."
