        "text": "Salut dragii mei! (Hello, my dears!)\n\nBefore I traveled to Moldova this summer, I had no idea what was waiting for me. Ironically, I was born in a country that borders Moldova (Ukraine), but didn’t know anything about my southern neighbor!\n\nI had no idea that it was one of the best undiscovered wine destinations in Europe. It didn’t occur to me that it was full of green nature, beautiful landscapes, lavender fields, and waterfalls. And I definitely didn’t know that it was home to a “country within a country” — or rather, a country that doesn’t technically exist!\n\nEven though Moldova is the least-visited country in Europe, it won’t be for long — once you visit Moldova, you’ll want to tell everybody about it. ;)\n\nLet’s check it out!\n\n🇲🇩 Moldova is perfect for … 🇲🇩\n\nBudget travel – Soviet architecture – Wine tasting – Unique churches – A Hidden gem in Europe\n\nWHAT TO KNOW BEFORE TRAVELING TO MOLDOVA\n\nWHEN TO GO TO MOLDOVA\n\nThe best time to visit Moldova is in the spring, especially during April or May. Temperatures are moderately warm, there are fewer tourists, and the countryside is full of green hills and color.\n\nSpring: Pleasant temperatures hovering around 15 to 18 C.\n\nSummer: Also a good time to visit, especially if you are planning to make your way to Odessa to enjoy the beaches.\n\nFall: August to October – Starting to get chilly but still a nice time to visit, especially if you can come during the wine festival in November.\n\nWinter: November to mid-February. Temperatures fall – and so does snow. Many places in smaller towns are closed for the winter.\n\n–\n\nHOW MUCH TO BUDGET FOR MOLDOVA\n\nMoldova is a very budget-friendly country. In fact, it’s one of the cheapest countries in Europe!\n\nI would recommend budgeting around $25 to $35 per day as a starting point, which includes accommodation, food, and entrance to tourist attractions.\n\nHere are the averages prices you can expect to pay for accommodations, food, and transportation in Moldova.\n\nHostels: Less than $10/night for a bed in a dorm roomHotels: $30 to 35 per night\n\nFood: about 120 MDL( $7 per lunch, including entree and drink)Coffee: around 20 MDL ($1.15 USD)\n\nBus from Chisinau to Old Orhei, about an hour drive: 26 MDL ($1.50 USD)Taxi in Chisinau: Around 40 MDL ($2.50 USD) for a taxi from the airport to the center Bus ticket in Chisinau: 2 MDL ($0.12 USD)\n\nTourist attractions: Less than $5 per attraction – most tickets usually cost $1 or $2 USD\n\n–\n\nGETTING HERE // HOW TO GET TO MOLDOVA\n\nFLIGHTS\n\nThe easiest way to get to Moldova is by taking a flight. There are dozens of airlines that fly directly to the capital airport, Chisinau (KIV), including budget airlines like WIZZ. The national airline, Air Moldova, flies from 30+ destinations in Europe.\n\nCompare prices and buy airline tickets to Moldova here\n\nBUS\n\nYou can easily get here by taking a bus to Chisinau from neighboring countries.\n\nI took the bus from Chernivtsi (Ukraine) to Chisinau and it took about 7 hours. There are busses to other major cities in Moldova, such as Balti, Tiraspol, and more.\n\nTRAIN\n\nFor people who want to explore and travel around Eastern Europe, there is a popular overnight train that goes from Kyiv to Chisinau. Other popular routes include Odessa – Tiraspol – Chisinau.\n\n–\n\nHOTELS // WHERE TO STAY IN MOLDOVA\n\nHotels in Moldova can be hit or miss, so it’s really important to pay close attention before booking. Since tourism in Moldova isn’t as popular as in other countries (it’s one of Europe’s least visited countries!), you might encounter hotels that haven’t been updated since the USSR, staff that don’t speak English, or amenities that are common in typical hotels. However, don’t let this scare you! There are also plenty of hotels that are quickly being updated to accommodate tourists, which means that you can score an amazing hotel at a great price.\n\nOne unique thing to do in Moldova is stay at a Pensiunea (sometimes called a Resedinta or a Pensiunea agroturistică). This is a sort of agricultural-style guesthouse/bed and breakfast where everything is decorated in a traditional style, the food is made fresh every day from the nearby garden, and it feels like you’re staying at your Moldovian grandmother’s summerhouse. :)\n\nI had the chance to stay at one of these accommodations in Orhei and loved it – in fact, it was one of the highlights of my trip! If you’re interested in learning more, I’ve written about it below.\n\n–\n\nTRANSPORTATION // HOW TO GET AROUND MOLDOVA\n\nSince Moldova is a compact country, it’s easy to get around – both inside a city and between cities.\n\nBUSSES: There are plenty of busses that go between cities. This is your best option if you are planning to go beyond the capital – for example, if you’re planning to do a day trip from Chisinau or travel between different cities in Moldova. Busses are cheap, plenty, and you might have interesting company on the ride. ;)\n\nTRAINS: Trains in Moldova exist, but they’re very slow and infrequent. Your best bet is either taking an intercity bus or renting a car.\n\nTAXI: If you want to quickly get between Point A and Point B, taking a taxi is a great idea. I used a taxi in Chisinau since they were cheap and readily available – Yandex Taxi was the best, but iTaxi is great too if you like to have options.\n\nCAR RENTAL: I rented a car to get from Chisinau to Orhei and was extremely surprised at how well the whole experience turned out. The roads were in excellent condition, cities were clearly marked, and if you get hungry, you can pull over and buy a snack from the grandmas selling fruit on the side of the road. ;P\n\n–\n\nWHAT TO PACK FOR MOLDOVA\n\nMoldova is pretty standard when it comes to packing, since it has well-defined seasons and the clothing associated with it (dresses in the summer, jackets and jeans in the fall, etc.)\n\nHowever, there are a few special items that I recommend packing for your trip to Moldova:\n\n✔ Pickpocket-proof Purse : Although Moldova is a safe country, it still has a problem that’s common in many places: pickpockets. I recommend a small purse, like this one, that is slash-resistant and has zippers.\n\n✔ A Large Scarf : For ladies planning to visit any of the churches or monasteries in Moldova, don’t forget your scarf! It’s a requirement to wrap a scarf around your head before entering a church. Some churches offer free scarves to tourists, but it’s a good idea to have one with you just in case there aren’t any available.\n\n✔ “Nice” Clothing : If you’re planning to go on a winery tour (more on that later!), you’ll want to wear nice clothing to really stand out in photos. This means a cute dress for ladies and a nice shirt/slacks combo for gentlemen.\n\n✔ A Warm Jacket : Speaking of wineries… If you’re planning on visiting an underground winery, I highly recommend taking a warm jacket or cardigan. The temperature down there is always a stable 50 F (10 C) and it can get pretty chilly! Throw over a warm cardigan and beat the cold. :)\n\n✔ Wine Bottle Protector : Ok ok, last part about wineries, I promise! There’s probably a high chance you’ll want to buy a few bottles of wine after your wine tour – make sure they arrive in once piece by packing them in these useful pouches.\n\n✔ Comfortable Shoes : The terrain in Moldova can be hard on your shoes (and feet). Make sure you pack a comfortable pair of walking shoes, especially if you plan to visit Old Orhei or do some hiking. I wear these Adidas Superstar shoes and love them.\n\n✔ Plug Adapter: Moldova has C and F outlets – Make sure your electronics can be charged by bringing these plug adapters along. I’ve been personally using this set for 4 years and highly recommend them!\n\nDAY ONE\n\nCHISINAU\n\nStart Your Trip to Moldova in the Capital That’s Frozen in Time\n\nSince most travelers usually start their trip to Moldova by taking an airplane or train into the country’s capital, Chisinau, this is where our itinerary will also start.\n\nFor first-time travelers, I recommend one to two days in Chisinau. If you’re in a rush, it’s compact enough to see in one day, but I recommend two to get a taste of authentic Moldova.\n\nThere are plenty of tourist attractions in Chisinau that will fill up your day, including parks, museums, cafes, and more. Since it’s not a huge city like Paris or Moscow, you can really take your time and explore: grab a pastry from a bakery, sit in the Stefan Cel Mare park, and do some people watching. :)\n\nOn another note, Chisinau is perfect for fans of Soviet architecture and history, especially since most of the city was rebuilt after being bombed in World War II. You can find classical Stalinist buildings almost anywhere you look, such as the Parliament, and other remnants of the Soviet Union at the Victory Memorial and the Eternal Flame.\n\nIf you’re really interested in diving deep into the country’s history, I recommend going on a guided tour: most tours are budget-friendly, the tour guides speak excellent English, and you’ll finally know what the heck is going on in that huge mural near that one church.\n\nI recommend this Chisinau Walking City tour, which is a perfect introduction to Moldova and its capital.\n\nIf you want an in-depth look into Chisinau, I also recommend booking a specialized tour (Cold War, Jewish history, bike tour, etc) – in that case, I highly recommend Nicolai as a guide. :)\n\n–\n\nWHAT TO DO IN CHISINAU\n\nStart at the Triumphal Arch & Cathedral Park Arcul de Triumf & Parcul Catedralei\n\nGet to know Chisinau by starting your day at the Triumphal Arch, which is also coincidentally where locals meet each other — hey, it’s a convenient spot in the center and hard to miss! The Arch was built in 1840 to commemorate the overthrow of the Ottoman Turks by the Russian Empire in 1828 and remains a national symbol to this day.\n\nFrom here, you can also walk to Cathedral Park, which is behind the arch. It’s a lovely little square where you can sit and people watch (or wait for Google Maps to load so you can go to the next point 😉).\n\nȘtefan cel Mare Central Park\n\nLocated diagonally across Cathedral Park, Stefan cel Mare Park is the oldest park in Moldova and a nice spot to hang out. In the front of the park, you’ll see a large statue of Stephen the Great (Ștefan cel Mare as the locals call him), which is one of the most important figures in Moldova’s history.\n\nGet to Know The Country at the National Museum of History of Moldova Muzeul Național de Istorie a Moldovei\n\nThe National Museum is, in my opinion, one of the best places in Chisinau and the perfect place to get acquainted with the history of Moldova. It has more than 250,000 exhibits detailing the history of the country, from ancient times to the royal family, to the USSR and finally to today.\n\nIf you’re into architecture, you’ll love the gorgeous rooms and the ornate decorations. I think I spent a half hour just staring at the ceiling (in a good way!) and the beautiful details.\n\nBudget 10 MDL ($1 USD) for a ticket and about 2 hours to walk through the entire museum. As a bonus, all of the signs are in English, and the employees also give you a little piece of paper with extra details when you walk into a room.\n\nNational Museum of Ethnography and Natural HistoryMuzeul Naţional de Etnografie şi Istorie Naturală\n\nif not for the exhibits inside, go just to see the gorgeous building, which looks like it could have been transported from Morocco or Oman. There’s also a lovely garden.\n\nAdmire the Architecture at St. Teodora de la Sihla ChurchBiserica Sfânta Teodora de la Sihla\n\nSure, Chisinau has plenty of interesting churches, but the St. Teodora de la Sihla Church is my favorite thanks to its gorgeous Byzantine architecture and blue roofs.\n\nWalk on the City’s Main Pedestrian Street, Yevgeniy Doga StreetStrada Eugen Doga\n\nLike any good Eastern European city, Chisinau has its own pedestrian street called Eugen Doga (named after a famous composer). Although it’s a fairly small street, there are plenty of cafes, restaurants, and breweries here. Don’t forget to take a photo of the “Sculpture of Lovers” statue.\n\nCentral MarketPiata Centrala\n\nThe central farmers market in Chisinau. It’s similar to what you would see in bazaars in other Eastern European countries and there are plenty of kiosks selling fresh fruit, vegetables, local types of cheese, and more. If you plan to visit this market, bring lei with you, since not many Moldovan grandmas accept credit cards here. ;)\n\nStroll along the Waterfront at Valea Morilor ParkLacul “Valea Morilor”\n\nJust a little outside the center of Chisinau is the Valea Morilor Park. This huge complex is loved by locals and is an especially great place to visit during the summer, when the weather is nice and the activities are in full swing. Kids will love the theme park (Aventura Park). There’s also the gorgeous winding staircase, Scara Cascadelor, and the smallest monument in Moldova that features the Little Prince.\n\nFUN FACT: Moldavian archaeologists recently discovered the fragments of a mammoth skeleton at the bottom of the lake in Valea Morilor Park.\n\nChisinau Railway StationGara feroviară din Chișinău\n\nNormally I don’t put stations on my itinerary, but how could you pass up this cheerful pink station? Just take a look at the Google photos – isn’t it so cute? 😊\n\nIf you’re planning to travel from Chisinau onward, there’s a high chance you’ll go through this station. It has daily and/or weekly departures from Chisinau to Bucharest, Kiev, Moscow, Minsk, Warsaw, Saint Petersburg, and Odessa. There are also many trains each week to neighboring Romania (Bucharest, Iasi, and so on), as well as daily service to Tiraspol.\n\nIf you’re planning on visiting other countries after Moldova, I have a section on that as well – scroll to the very bottom or Ctrl + F “Where Should I Travel After Moldova?” to find it. :)\n\n–\n\nWHERE TO EAT IN CHISINAU\n\nAs with most capital cities, there are so many places to eat in Chisinau no matter your budget, location, and taste. From hipster cafes to traditional Moldovan restaurants and everything in between, here are some of the places that I’ve personally eaten or have asked locals about.\n\nPropaganda Cafe – This is a can’t-miss in Chisinau! The cafe can be a little hard to find if you’re not familiar with the street, but once you’re inside, you’ll be glad you found it. The entire cafe is decorated like a Soviet house, complete with vintage Lenin posters and old USSR knickknacks.\n\nBesides being very aesthetic and fun to look at, the food here is phenomenal. I had the syrniki (cottage cheese pancakes), Napoleon cake, and a smoothie. The Napoleon was my favorite dish because it tasted exactly the way my grandma bakes it. Likewise, the service was friendly and helpful.\n\nLa Placinte – La Placinte serves traditional Moldovan food, such as meat, dumplings, mamaliga, desserts, etc. in a cute ethno-style restaurant. There are half a dozen locations in Chisinau, all conveniently located near the center.\n\nTucano Coffee – If you’ve been missing your daily dose of Starbucks, check out its Eastern European counterpart ;) This colorful and cheeky cafe chain can be found all around Chisinau with cute names like Brazil, Jamaica, and Costa Rica – a nod to coffee-producing countries where they source from.\n\nCreme de la Creme – If you’re walking along the pedestrian street (Strada Eugen Doga), you’ll come across this cute French-style cafe. There’s a nice selection of cakes and coffee, as well as outdoor seating.\n\nGastrobar – Like the name says, this gastronomic-style restaurant has trendy dishes and a lovely atmosphere to boot. As a bonus, they’re open late.\n\nZaxi – Upscale sushi and cocktail restaurant with stunning views from the terrace.\n\nCarpe Diem – All of the locals that I met recommended this as the palace to go for wine, and they’re right: Carpe Diem is a hybrid wine store and wine bar with excellent service. The employees there helped me pick out a wine and even gave a small degustation so I knew how it tasted before I bought it. If you don’t have time to go to a winery, definitely go here!\n\n–\n\nWHERE TO STAY IN CHISINAU\n\nMY TOP PICK\n\nWine Hotel\n\nFor my trip, I stayed at Wine Hotel, which, personally, I think is one of the best accommodations in Chisinau. Where else do you get one glass of wine for free per day? ;)\n\nThe rooms are large and spacious with modern amenities, plus they have a lovely panoramic view of the city from the balcony.\n\nThe hotel also has a wine bar / restaurant where breakfast (included in the rate) is served daily. This is perfect for traveling Moldova on a budget, since you get a delicious meal and won’t need to waste time finding a breakfast cafe.\n\nThere are only a few rooms at Wine Hotel, so the service is personalized for each traveler. When I was checking out and going to Old Orhei, the manager even sent a security guard to load my luggage into the rental car.\n\nFinally, with a hotel being called Wine Hotel, they need to live up to their expectations, right? And they did exactly that: every day, guests can choose one of three different wines and receive a complimentary glass. The staff were also extremely knowledgeable and advised me which wines to buy when I went shopping for souvenirs.\n\nReserve Wine Hotel on Booking.com\n\n–\n\nMID-RANGE HOTELS IN CHISINAU\n\nTulip Residence & Spa\n\nThis Thai-style hotel has charming decor, a delicious breakfast buffet, and clean rooms.

The rooms aren’t the most modern, but if you’re looking for the total Soviet experience, stay here. ;)\n\nReserve Hotel Chisinau on Booking.com\n\nCasa Daca Boutique Hotel\n\nA cute boutique hotel (there are only 18 rooms!) decorated in a minimalistic style with hints of traditional Moldovan elements.

This hostel is decorated with vintage Soviet posters as well as a cool mural. It’s fairly small (there’s room for only 12 people), but the atmosphere is friendly and the beds are comfortable.\n\nReserve Retro Moldova Hostel on Booking.com\n\nAmazing Ionika Hostel\n\nThis *amazing* hostel (get it?) is consistently rated as one of the best hostels in Chisinau, and it shows. Although it’s not a party hostel, there’s still an upstairs area to hang out and get to know your hostelmates, as well as group tours to Transnistria and around the city.

In Moldova, anything is possible. ;) This aptly-named apartment has a lovely view of the city skyline, as well as a sweeping terrace and two bedrooms. Likewise, it’s located close to the center but in a quiet area.\n\nReserve this penthouse apartment on Booking.com\n\nDAY TWO\n\nTRANSNISTRIA & TIRASPOL\n\nVisit the Country That Doesn’t Exist\n\nOne of the biggest “tourist attractions” in Moldova (if I can call it that) is, ironically, a country within a country. Or to be more specific, a country that doesn’t exist.\n\nHow did this happen? Back in the 1990s the Soviet Union fell apart and Moldova became an independent country like the rest of the ex-USSR states. However, a small strip of land on the Ukrainian border felt isolated in this new country, as it was home to many Russians who wanted to keep their land as a socialist republic. A war broke out, then a ceasefire, and finally a breakaway state. This is how the story of modern Transnistria began.\n\nEven though Transnistria has its own currency, border, parliament, national anthem, military, postal system, currency, license plates, and even citizenship, it is one of only a handful of places around the world that doesn’t technically exist. The self-proclaimed state is not recognized by the rest of the world — not even by Russia, one of their closest allies.\n\nTransnistria, Transdniestria, Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, Приднестровье — no matter what you call it, it’s a very interesting and unique place, and a must-do in Moldova.\n\nWhen you cross the “border” from Moldova to Transnistria, you’ll usually be given a 10 hour limit on your visitor registration paper (more on that in the next section). I think 10 hours is plenty of time to explore the capital, Tiraspol, and the nearby city of Bender and to get a good idea of Transnistria. However, travelers can get up to 45 days in Transnistria if they provide proof of accommodation.\n\nBefore we dive into traveling to Transnistria, there’s one question I want to answer. It’s the most common question, which is:\n\nIs it safe to visit Transnistria? Yes, it’s perfectly safe. Although it might sound scary to visit an unrecognized country (or realize that there’s no embassy there), it is perfectly legal and safe to do so. The people are friendly, the border officers didn’t ask any questions, and I had no problems at all while I was there.\n\nHOW TO GET TO TRANSNISTRIA\n\nThe easiest and most common way to get to Transnistria from Chisinau is by taking the marshrutka (a type of sprinter car). There are dozens of marshrutkas from the Central Bus Station that depart every 20 minutes or so. Look for the marshrutka with either “Tiraspol” or “Тирасполь” on the windshield. If you get lost, don’t be afraid to ask for help – the drivers are very friendly and know a little bit of English.\n\nTickets cost 37 MDL ($2 USD), and the ride takes approximately 1.5 hours.\n\nWhen you get to the border, everybody leaves the bus and enters a small building to go through the immigration process. The officer asks a few basic questions (what’s the purpose of your visit, how long will you be staying, etc.) before giving you a piece of paper with your details. If there’s one piece of information I can give you about this whole trip, it’s: do not lose that piece of paper unless you want problems on the way back. Also don’t overstay the time written on that paper. 😅\n\n–\n\nWHAT TO DO IN TRANSNISTRIA\n\nTransnistria is made up of 10 cities and many little towns and villages, but we’ll be focusing on the big two today: Tiraspol and Bender (sometimes called Bendery). Tiraspol is the second largest city in Moldova and the capital of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, while Bendery is a city with important historical significance.\n\nNo matter where you go in Transnistria, this country is like an open-air USSR museum. Statues of Lenin, socialist murals, and flags with the hammer and sickle will really make you feel like you hopped into a time machine went back to the USSR.\n\nWHAT TO DO IN TIRASPOL\n\n🔴 October 25th Street – Named after an important date in Soviet history (the day the October Revolution started), this street is also important, as its the main street that runs through Tiraspol. One thing that really surprised me was how wide this street is – even the pospekti in Minsk couldn’t compare to this street!\n\n🔴 House of Soviets – Near the beginning of the October 25th street is the House of the Soviets (photo above). This grand building was originally where important Soviet figures, such as deputies, met and discussed governmental things. Nowadays it’s home to the city hall.\n\n🔴 Suvorov Square – The grand park of Tiraspol, Suvorov Square is a huge plot of land with statues, benches, and mementos of Transnistria. In the summer, it turns into a colorful square from all of the blooming flowers.\n\n🔴 T-34 tank and Saint George Chapel – Just across Suvorov Square is another Soviet memento commemorating the USSR’s victory in World War II. A little further is St. George Chapel, which feature gold domes and Orthodox murals on the side.\n\n🔴 Presidential Palace – This unassuming brown and white building is where the President of Transnistria, as well as the parliament, meet to do very important things. There’s also a (you guessed it) Lenin statue.\n\n🔴 I Heart Tiraspol Sign – If you want to show your love for your new favorite city, there’s an “I Heart Tiraspol” sign in front of De Wollant Park.\n\n🔴 Hang out near the Dniester – Transnistria literally translates to “beyond the Dniester,” and a little piece of Tiraspol gives you the opportunity to see this magnificent river. Towards the end of De Wollant Park is a little bridge and some small kiosks selling ice cream and drinks in the summer. If you have some free time, grab a snack and watch the boats float by.\n\n🔴 Dom Knigi – If you’ve been wandering around Tiraspol looking for a souvenir shop, this is the best place. Half of the store sells books (that’s what the name translates to :)) and the other half has all sorts of Transnistria-related souvenirs like hats, pins, postcards, magnets, and more.\n\n🔴 City Library – One of my favorite places in Tiraspol. It might seem a little hipster, but I really liked the second floor, where you can find a colorful mural and a library that’s still in the 1970’s. The address is Strada Sverdlov 78.\n\n–\n\nWHAT TO DO IN BENDER\n\n🔴 Bender Fortress – The most famous landmark in Bender, this fortress had humble beginnings as a wooden fort before being redeveloped into a strong fortification by a sultan during the Ottoman period. You can also go inside and walk around the area or go to the top for a nice view of the river.\n\n🔴 Noul Neamt Monastery – An all-male Moldovan Orthodox monastery located just outside of Bender and Tiraspol, this building was used asa hospital during the USSR before being restored into a church.\n\n🔴 Bendery Bus Station – One of the most colorful bus stations that I saw in my life. The teal interior was so stylish that there was even a photoshoot going on when I walked by. If you’re hungry, check out the themed CCCP canteen on the second floor.\n\n🔴 Memorial Park in Bendery – A small square that contains interesting monuments and statues from the USSR.\n\nTRAVEL TIP: Psst, wanna play a game? Count how many Lenin statues you find in Transnistria and send me your final number on Instagram. ;)\n\n–\n\nWHERE TO EAT IN TRANSNISTRIA\n\nKumanek – This was the Ukrainian restaurant where I ate during my little trip to Transnistria and one of the highlights of my time in Tiraspol. It has a large menu, delicious food, and outdoor seating with cute ethnic decor.\n\n7 Pyatnits Cafe (7 Fridays Cafe) – Nice cafe with both Western and local-style food, WiFi, and friendly workers.\n\nLove Cafe – A sweet cafe with decor that makes it look like it was taken from a street in Paris. There’s also an English menu.\n\nKvint – Did you know Transnistria has its own distillery? Kvint produces more than 20 million bottles a year of its famous spirits and brandies. If you want to try a real taste of Tiraspol, there are daily tours at the Kvint factory.\n\nFUN FACT: A bottle of Kvint once made its way into space along with Yuri Gagarin.\n\n–\n\nWHERE TO STAY IN TRANSNISTRIA\n\nAlthough one day should be plenty to explore all that Transnistria has to offer, some travelers prefer to travel slowly and take a few days to really get to know the area. You’ll find most of the accommodations in Tiraspol, although there are a few hotels and apartments for rent in Bender as well.\n\nHOSTELS IN TIRASPOL\n\nLenin Street Hostel\n\nIf you love portraits of Lenin and enjoy your decor in a nostalgic Soviet style, this is the hostel for you. ;)\n\nThe owner, Dimitri, loves to meet his guests and show them around the city. There are both dorm rooms and private rooms (seriously, check out those cool Lenin portraits) and breakfast included. It’s not a party hostel, but the atmosphere is very friendly and a place where you can make new friends.\n\nReserve Lenin Street Hostel on Booking.com\n\nLike Home Hostel\n\nLike Home has earned the title of best hostel in Tiraspol (and probably Transnistria as well) thanks to its homely atmosphere and friendly owners.

And that you can visit it in Moldova?\n\nFUN FACT: Did you know Moldova is the 11th largest wine-producing country in Europe and the 20th largest wine producing country in the world?\n\nThanks to its fertile land and location, Moldova’s history of winemaking spans thousands of years. In fact, one of the chief exports of Moldova in medieval times was — you guessed it — wine!\n\nMoldova became the main supplier of wine to other countries in the Soviet Union in the 1940s (supplying nearly 70 percent of all wine!) all the way up until the mid-1980s, when the then-president Mikhail Gotbachev launched an anti-alcohol campaign. Thanks to these “dry laws,” more than 35% of vineyards across Moldova were shut down almost overnight and the economy suffered greatly. Some wineries were smart enough to hide their most important wines — some spanning back to 1901! — such as Milestii Mici. They constructed a huge wall on wheels that would roll to the side to reveal the hidden room full of rare and valuable wines.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, the vineyards in Moldova were back to making wine in full swing, but not for long. Two huge Russian embargoes on Moldovan wine in 2006 and 2013 (Russia didn’t take too kindly to Moldova wanting to join the EU) forced winemakers to diversify. Nowadays, Moldovan wineries are perfecting their craft and targeting foodies from the European Union, Japan, and China.\n\nWill you be charmed by the delicious and fresh taste of Moldovan wine? There’s only one way to find out!\n\nHow to Choose a Moldovan Winery\n\nIf you want to go on a Moldova wine tour, there are a few things to consider:\n\nDo you want to go by yourself or with a tour? For the underground wineries, such as Milestii Mici and Cricova, you’ll need a car. You can either go with a tour company or hire a taxi in Chisinau to take you to the winery, since, obviously, the winery won’t let you wander the tunnels without supervision (unless you want to get lost – my driver regaled me with a lot of stories about lost tourists 😅).\n\nDo you want to visit one winery or multiple wineries in one day? If you have the whole day, I recommend going on a multi-winery tour to see the best of Moldovan wines. If you only have a few hours (for example, 3 or 4 hours), you can still fit in a wine tasting tour at one winery.\n\nWhat type of wine do you prefer? Although Moldova primarily makes white wine (70% of all production is white wine!), red and table wines are also popular and readily available at most wineries. If you’re like me and have no idea what you like, there are wine tasting tours in Moldova that give\n\nyou 3 to 5 different wines to taste.\n\nTRAVEL TIP! If you’re planning to do a wine tour at one of the underground wineries, such as Milestii Mici or Cricova, it’s best to bring a lightweight jacket or cardigan (like this one). The temperature stays a constant 50 F (10 C) all year round, which means it can get pretty chilly!\n\nMILESTII MICI\n\nI chose Mistii Mici (also known as Mileștii Mici) as the winery to go wine tasting on this trip for three main reasons:1. It has the biggest wine collection in the world (!!) and is one of the most famous and well-known wineries in Moldova (the others being Cricova and MIMI) 2. It’s only a 20 minute drive (14 km) from Chisinau to Milestii Mici, making it perfect for a quick stop or a full day tour3. The wine fountain — but more on that later ;)\n\nMilestii Mici winery. If you ask any Moldovan local what they think of Milestii Mici, they’ll probably reply that it’s one of the best wineries in Moldova. Spoiler alert: I asked my driver the same exact question, and got the same exact reply – as we were heading to Milestii Mici, no less. ;)\n\nWith more than 200 kilometers of underground tunnels and more than 2 million bottles of wine, Milestii Mici is home to the biggest wine collection in the world.\n\nMilestii Mici’s history began when an old limestone mine was “refurbished” in the late 1960s and turned into the state-owned winery that we know today. One of the unique things about Milestii are the two “wine fountains” near the entrance. PSA – Unfortunately it’s not real wine that comes out of the fountain, but it makes for a cool photo nonetheless. :)\n\nFUN FACT: Celebrities such as Obama store their own wine at Milestii Mici – prices start at 500 Euro a year if you want to have your own storage “cellar”!\n\nI absolutely loved my tour at Milestii Mici and would highly recommend this winery as a starting point in your Moldovan wine tasting journey.\n\nThe way it works is simple: you book a tour, the driver comes to your accommodation in Chisinau, and you make your way to the Milestii Mici winery. From there, you check in at the front desk and wait in line until it’s your turn to go underground (go check out the fountain while you wait!) You’ll have a few other cars in your “tour group” as you drive from point to point in the underground tunnels and stop to listen to the guide before moving on. At the end, depending on your tour package, you’ll be treated to a wine degustation and a delicious and authentic Moldovan lunch. Sounds great, right?\n\nP.S. – if you have the chance, definitely try the Mărgăritar wine. It instantly became my favorite wine, and *ahem* I might have bought 5 bottles to take home with me…\n\nBOOK A WINE TOUR TO MILESTII MICI HERE\n\n–\n\nCRICOVA\n\nCricova is the second largest wine cellar in Moldova, boasting over 120 kilometers of underground tunnels. It’s especially known for its sparkling wine, which can be found on the table of almost every Moldovan during New Years Eve festivities.\n\nFUN FACT: In 1966, famous Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin visited Cricova for a wine tasting and emerged two days later (with some assistance).\n\nBOOK A WINE TOUR TO CRICOVA WINERY HERE\n\n–\n\nCASTEL MIMI WINERY\n\nCastel Mimi Winery is a gorgeous chateau that looks like it was transported directly from France. The only “wine castle” in Moldova, Mimi winery brands itself as a wine resort where guests can relax and enjoy wine. This sprawling complex includes a restaurant (The White Owl), an outdoor pool, a wine bar, and a hotel (Seven Stone Chalets Hotel).\n\nFUN FACT: Founder Constantin Mimi supplied the Russian army with his wines during World War I.\n\nBOOK A WINE TOUR TO CASTEL MIMI HERE //\n\nBOOK A ROOM AT CASTEL MIMI BOUTIQUE HOTEL HERE\n\n–\n\nCHATEAU VARTELY\n\nAlthough Chateau Vartely is one of the youngest wineries on this list (It was founded in 2008!) it’s already well-known in Moldova for its premium wine. Located near Orheiul Vechi, Vartely is a bit further out but well worth it!\n\nYou can even stay overnight and explore Old Orhei the following day — check out the section below for more information.\n\nBOOK A WINE TOUR TO CHATEAU VARTELY HERE //\n\nBOOK A ROOM AT CHATEAU VARTELY’S HOTEL HERE\n\n–\n\nPUCARI\n\nFound in 1827, Pucari is the oldest winery in Moldova and remains relatively unchanged to this day. In fact, the underground cellars kept their cross-shaped tunnels, as a reminder of the time when the production of wine in the country was controlled by the church.\n\nIf you have extra time and prefer to stop and savor everything the winery has to offer, Pucari recently launched a boutique hotel with ten rooms. There’s also a tennis court, two lakes, a restaurant and wine bar, and even a children’s playground.\n\nBOOK A WINE TOUR TO PUCARI HERE //\n\nBOOK A ROOM AT PUCARI’S HOTEL HERE\n\nDAY FOUR\n\nOLD ORHEI\n\nStunning green landscapes, cheerful Moldovan “bunicile”, and a monastery built into a cave\n\nPhoto credit: Calin Stan\n\nOld Orhei (known as Orheiul Vechi in Moldovan) is an area 35 miles (60 km) north of Chisinau that is comprised of three villages: Butuceni, Morovaia and Trebujeni.\n\nIt is one of the most popular day trips from Chisinau and is famous for its rolling green hills, cozy bread and breakfasts (perfect for travelers looking to relax in nature!), and its most famous site: a monastery built into a cave.\n\nAfter it was added to UNESCO’s list of World Heritage Sites, Old Orhei came into prominence and is now one of the best places to visit in Moldova— and you’ll see why when you arrive!\n\nTake a small hike up to Orhei Vechi Monastery, taste homemade mamaliga at a bed and breakfast, revel in the beautiful nature, and enjoy this hidden gem of Moldova.\n\nThe best part about traveling to Old Orhei is the flexibility: you can do a half-day tour from Chisinau (about 3 – 4 hours) or stay overnight to get a real feel of the Moldovan countryside. Besides the activities mentioned below, there isn’t much else to do – which is a plus if you’re interested in exploring nature and a minus if you’re into the bustle of city life. Hopefully that gives you a little insight so that you can pick the duration of your stay in Old Orhei. Let’s check it out. :)\n\nHow to Get to Old Orhei\n\nYou can get to Old Orhei via public transportation (a large van known as a marshrutka) or via rental car (which is what I did).\n\nMarshrutka to Old Orhei\n\nYou’ll want to go towards the back of Chisinau’s Piata Centrala (Central Plaza), where all of the busses and marshrutkas depart. There should be plenty of busses leaving daily – you’ll want to look for the one that has a sign with “Trebujeni” or “Butaceni” on it. Don’t worry, they’re close to each other, so it doesn’t really matter which one you take.\n\nThe ticket costs about 26 MDL (about $1.50 USD) and the journey takes about one hour. From Trebujeni it’s a 30 minute walk to the main sites, and from Butuceni it’s only about 15 minutes. Be sure to preload Google Maps beforehand because it can be a little confusing where to go— you’ll want to set “Orhei Vechi Monastery” as your destination, and you’ll know you’re close if you see the Orheiul Vechi Complex wooden sign at the entrance.\n\nTo get back to Chisinau, you can just head back to where you were dropped off. Be sure to ask beforehand what time the marshrutka comes so that you can plan your day.\n\nDriving/Taxi to Old Orhei\n\nFor the trip from Chisinau to Old Orhei, I rented a car because it was convenient and I didn’t have to stick to the bus schedule. As a bonus, it’s easier to drive on the dirt roads over to your accommodation and to get between places (such as the monastery and a restaurant).\n\nThe drive is about 55 km long and takes approximately 1 hour. The roads are really nice, but be sure to keep an eye on the speed limit so you won’t need to bribe the police. (*ahem* 😅)\n\nWhat to Do in Old Orhei\n\nOrhei Vechi Monastery\n\nOrhei Vechi Monastery is the biggest tourist attraction in Old Orhei for two reasons. First of all, a monastery built into a cave?! How cool is that? And second of all, the (somewhat) hidden view from the back. But before we visit the monastery, let’s dive into a bit of history.\n\nThere’s a historical legend that said the leaders of the Golden Horde (a Tatar group that lived in the area) hid their gold and treasures in the walls of the cave’s rocks when they found out that their city was under attack. Is there still gold in the walls? Nobody knows — and I didn’t want to anger the monks and find out 😅 — so the legend is still out there.\n\nBesides gold, the monastery was also a popular place to hide Orthodox Christians during the USSR times, when religion was banned in the country. Even after the fall of the Soviet Union, the cave is still used today by Orthodox monks, who live and pray inside.\n\nThe cave is a popular spot for tourists who visit it to see the colorful altar and icons inside. It is also one of the most important religious sites for Moldovan pilgrims who visit every year to pray.\n\nWhile I was there, the friendly monk mentioned that there is also a lovely view of the surrounding area. When you arrive, go straight ahead and there’s a small back “door” (AKA it’s really just a hole in the wall), and you’re there.\n\nYou can also go into the little side room, which is where the monks used to sleep back in the day. Don’t worry, now they have much more comfortable rooms that are outside of the cave. :)\n\nAfter the 1990s, the church services were moved to the new church nearby. It’s a short 5 minute walk between the two spots and the next thing on our list.\n\nTRAVEL TIP! Since this is a religious site, please remember to wear conservative clothing. For men this includes a shirt and pants, and for women it should be a long dress and a scarf wrapped around the head. Although it’s not strictly enforced (i.e. there’s nobody at the entrance), also consider donating a few lei to help the monks with the upkeep.\n\nNew Ascension Of St. Mary Orthodox Church\n\nThis is the church I was talking about :)\n\nTo the right of the cave monastery is the Orthodox church that was built in 1905. It’s a lovely compound that has a garden and a small church that you can go inside. On the side is a gift shop where you can buy small laminated icons, souvenirs, and other church-related things.\n\nThe Stone Cross\n\nThe final part of the Orheiul Vechi Complex, this stone cross is a few steps away from the cave monastery. When I was exploring the area, there was a small queue to get a photo with this cross. After asking one of the men in line, I learned that if you put your hand over the flower on top, your wishes will come true.\n\nVisit the neighboring town of Orhei\n\nIf you’ve finished visiting all of the tourist attractions in Old Orhei and have some spare time, you can also explore the nearby town with (almost) the same name.\n\nThe drive from Old Orhei to Orhei is about 35 minutes and takes about 30 km. There you’ll find different stores, restaurants, parks, and more. There’s even an amusement park called Orheiland. :)\n\nA little further you can also find the Curchi Monastery, one of the most beautiful buildings in Moldova. If you want to learn more, I’ve written about it in-depth at the “Other Places to Visit in Moldova” section below.\n\n–\n\nWhere to Stay in Old Orhei\n\nSince the town is small, there are only a few hotels in Old Orhei — but, like the old saying goes: quality over quantity! In fact, some of my favorite memories from Moldova were at the bed and breakfast that I stayed near Old Orhei.\n\nRESEDINTA ROTUNDU\n\nLocated in Butuceni, Resedinta Rotundu is one of the best accommodations near Old Orhei, and this was where I stayed overnight during my mini-trip here.\n\nOne of the first things that jump out at you at Resedinta Rotundu is the cute, colorful, and kitschy decor, which makes it feel like a cheerful Moldovan grandma lives here.\n\nThe second thing that jumps out is the extremely friendly staff. While waiting for the food, I went over to the garden out front and and talked with the two ladies. They were more than happy to give me a small tour of the fruits and veggies that they grow after I mentioned that my grandma also had a small garden. Later in the day, the credit card terminal wasn’t working and the older gentleman working as an electrician graciously gave me a lift to the nearby city of Orhei.\n\nSpeaking of the garden, I want to make a special note of the food here. I dined at Resedinta Rotundu twice, once for lunch and once for breakfast the day after. All of the dishes cooked at the restaurant are taken from the garden, eco-friendly, and fresh. The menu has a variety of options that include both Moldovan dishes and international ones. If you have time in the morning, definitely don’t skip breakfast: it’s absolutely amazing! The soft homemade bread, the chocolate-covered pancakes, the fresh-pressed juices, and the fluffy yogurt. If I could have one breakfast for the rest of my life, I would dine at Rotundu.\n\nFinally, the rooms are large, comfortable, and have everything you need – in the traditional Moldovan decor, of course. ;)\n\nOn a trip, it’s the little things that count — and my entire experience at Resedinta Rotundu made my trip to Moldova even better.\n\nBook Resedinta Rotundu on Booking.com\n\n–\n\nVILA ROZ\n\nJust a stone’s throw away in Trebujeni, Vila Roz is another picturesque pensiunea surrounded with hills and nature. The owner, Luba, is a native of the area and loves to delight her guests with traditional dishes at the on-site restaurant.\n\nThe name, “rose villa” comes from both the cheerful rose-colored building as well as the lovely rose garden on the property. During the spring and summer seasons, don’t forget to smell the roses (literally) – they’re delicious!\n\nThere are also complimentary bikes, hammocks, and an outdoor pool (!!) to make the most of your stay.\n\nBook Vila Roz on Booking.com\n\n–\n\nWhere to Eat in Old Orhei\n\nAgain, since the town is small, there are a limited amount of options.\n\nIf you’re only visiting Old Orhei on a day tour, I recommend buying some snacks in the city and bringing them with you (such as sandwiches, trail mix, bottled water, etc.)\n\nIf you’re staying overnight, most of the hotels and accommodations in Old Orhei will have at least one restaurant on-site, and many will even have breakfast included in the rate.\n\nFor travelers who have a rental car, there are way more options in the nearby city of Orhei (the regular Orhei, not Old Orhei ;)).\n\nIn case you’re limited to Orheiul Vechi, here are some restaurants in Old Orhei that you can try:\n\nButuceni Restaurant: One of the best restaurants in Old Orhei, Butuceni is known for its delicious dumplings (seriously, try them) and traditional food. If you have time, definitely sign up for their cooking class – you won’t regret it!\n\nCasa din Lunca Restaurant: A popular restaurant among locals that has a beautiful dining room and fresh food.\n\nResedinta Rotundu: I’ve written above my stay above, but even if you’re not a guest, I recommend eating at Resedinta Rotundu. Everything is homegrown, organic, and yummy – especially the desserts.\n\nEpoca de Piatră/Pivnițele Brănești: Translated to “Stone Age,” this restaurant/brewery is built into a cave — you can’t miss it, as it has huge Hollywood-style letters announcing the entrance. The specialties here include delicious grilled meat and local craft beer.\n\n–\n\nOld Orhei Tours\n\nIf you don’t have a rental car, prefer not to drive, and hate the thought of waiting for a bus in the hot sun, there are plenty of Old Orhei tours from Chisinau. The way it works is your driver will pick you up from your hotel in Chisinau, drive you to Old Orhei, and have your guide walk you through the main attractions before driving back to the capital.\n\nI recommend this Orhei Vechi Monastery Complex Tour from Chisinau, which includes a visit to all of the main sites in Old Orhei, the open-air museum, and even a traditional dinner.\n\nIf you want to see all of the tours going to Old Orhei, you can check them out here.\n\nTHE END\n\nBACK TO CHISINAU\n\nThat’s it for our trip to Moldova! The final day is a “free day,” which means you can spend as much or as little time as you’d like in Chisinau.\n\nIf you still have free time, feel free to check out some of the sites listed in “Other Places to Visit in Moldova” below.\n\nIf you want to travel onward, I have also put together a small list of other places you can visit across the border — since Moldova is sandwiched between Romania and Ukraine, you’ll find plenty of options for those two countries. :)\n\nWHAT OTHER PLACES SHOULD I VISIT IN MOLDOVA?\n\nSource: jorono\n\nBesides the top three places to visit — Chisinau, Transnistria, and Old Orhei — there are plenty of hidden gems in Moldova. Here are a few that were recommended to me by locals or that I’ve read about in guide books.\n\nSoroca – Soroca is the “unofficial” Roma capital of Moldova due to the large population of Roma people living there. The biggest attraction in Soroca are the huge and over the top mansions – there’s even an area, Gypsy Hill, where you can see the best ones. Other attractions include Soroca Fortress and the Candle of Gratitude.\n\nSaharna Monastery – Located in a small village called (*drumroll*) Saharna, this monastery is surrounded by a lush forest and nature. After walking around the complex, visit the other main tourist attraction of Saharna: the 22 waterfalls that are sprinkled around the area! There’s also a full day tour that takes you around Saharna, Tipova, and the surrounding areas. BOOK YOUR TOUR TO SAHARNA HERE.\n\nCodru Reserve – Codru is the oldest forest reserve in Moldova. Located about 50 km north of the capital, it makes for a perfect day trip from Chisinau.\n\nCredit: HomoCosmicos\n\nCurchi Monastery (Manastirea Curchi): The red and white colored monastery was built more than 250 years ago and has a history as colorful as its exterior: it started as a small wooden church, then rebuilt into the current style, bombed during the USSR, and then served as a psychiatric hospital until 2002. Finally, the government allocated money to restore the building to its former self, and now locals and tourists from around the world visit it.\n\nCredit: Léonard Cotte\n\nCobusca Nouă – You don’t have to fly all the way to France to get those Instagram-worthy photos of yourself in a lavender field – just go to Moldova! Located in a small village, the best time to visit these fields are in June, when the lavender is in full bloom.\n\nBălți – Often referred to as the “Northern Capital” of Moldova, Balti is the country’s second largest city. If you’re traveling for Chisinau to Chernivtsi, Ukraine, this is a good spot to stop and break up the long journey. Attractions include the large square and the Saint Constantine and Elena Cathedral.\n\nGagauzia – Similar to Transnistria, Gagauzia is another autonomous region of Moldova. The population is more related to Turkish people than Moldovans (even the language!). It’s a 4 hour bus ride to Comrat, the capital city.\n\nWHERE SHOULD I TRAVEL AFTER MOLDOVA?\n\nMoldova is neatly sandwiched between two countries, Ukraine and Romania, which makes it easy to choose your next destination. Here are a few options:\n\nUKRAINE\n\nChernivtsi – One of the most beautiful cities in Ukraine (and my hometown *cough*), Chernivtsi is teeming with intricate architecture, beautiful pedestrian streets, and one of the most famous UNESCO sites in Ukraine: Chernivtsi National University! Chernivtsi is located near the border of both Romania and Moldova, and can be reached via a 7-hour bus ride from Chisinau or a 3-hour bus ride from Balti.\n\nREAD MY CITY GUIDE TO CHERNIVTSI HERE!\n\nOdessa – Odessa is the seaside resort of Ukraine featuring over 30 km of coastline and plenty of beaches. Although it might seem like Odessa is a summer destination, it’s actually perfect all year round! This city features friendly locals, elegant palaces, and the perfect place to take a stroll along the waterfront. It takes 4 hours by train from Chisinau to Odessa. As an option, you can also do Chisinau-Tiraspol-Odessa and have a stop in Transnistria on the way there.\n\n–\n\nROMANIA\n\nIași – Iasi is the biggest city in eastern Romania and a lovely place to spend a day wandering around on your way to Cluj-Napoca or Brașov. Don’t miss the Palace of Culture or the park in front of it. It takes 3.5 hours by bus or 5 hours by train to get from Chisinau to Iasi.\n\nBucharest – From one capital to another ;) There are so many things to do in Bucharest that I could write another blog post, but some of my favorite highlights were the National Theatre, Cărturești Carusel bookstore (seriously, this is the most beautiful bookstore I’ve seen in my life), and the dozens of parks scattered around the city. The best option is to take a night train, which takes about 13 hours from Chisinau to Bucharest. Otherwise there are daily busses as well.\n\nThat’s all for this travel guide to Moldova! I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed traveling through this undiscovered but warm and friendly country.\n\nLet me know what you think in the comments below: Have you been to Moldova? Do you want to go? And which of the places would you love to visit the most?\n\nI’m off to enjoy a glass of Milestii Mici wine — but before I go, I wanted to say…\n\nMulțumesc frumos ca ați citit blogul meu și va doresc bun voiaj!\n\nLike it?
