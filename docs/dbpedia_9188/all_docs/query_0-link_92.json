There we will learn about the history, culture and daily life of the Gagauz from ancient times to the modern days.\n\nAfter enjoying a mini concert of Gagauz songs and dances, we head to Copceac to visit the last working “colhoz” from Moldova - a type of run by state farm. Here we will have a traditional Gagauz lunch, and experience the old communist life.\n\nThe “Victory” collective farm was founded in 1947 and now is the leader in producing and exporting fruits and vegetables in the southern area of Moldova. It is the only surviving collective farm after the collapse of USSR.\n\nReturn to Chisinau.\n\nIncluded meals:"
