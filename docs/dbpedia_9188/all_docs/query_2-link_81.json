        "text": "Crossing the bridge in Otaci is a nightmare with the frigid winter weather that has once again descended across Moldova.\n\nOne of my dear Moldovan friends is now working for an NGO that is distributing aid and helping organize volunteer efforts to serve Ukrainian refugees in Moldova; she watched, heartbroken, as a mother “weeping, her face destroyed,” traversed the bridge with a young child in her arms.\n\nContinue reading “Moldova Welcomes Ukrainian Refugees” →\n\nThis is everything you could want to know – and more! – about Comrat’s first Journalism Mentoring Program.

He called my host mother’s name, and I leaned out of the shadow of the summer house to summon his attention: “Anna Nikolaevna’s not home right now.”\n\nThe first thing that struck me was his smile, replete with silver grills.
