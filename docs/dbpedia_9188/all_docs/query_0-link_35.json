        "text": "Join us on an unforgettable adventure in Moldova, the least visited European country with less than 12 000 visitors per year. Moldova offers unspoiled nature, preserved history and great wine for every taste. Become one of the few travelers stepping into Transnistria - a breakaway republic in eastern Moldova, where Soviet values are still upheld and people fight for independence. Explore Gagauzia, a little-known region covering 1,848 square kilometres in Moldova's south, that comprises a cluster of cities, towns and villages amongst mainly rural and agricultural landscapes. This unique region is predominantly inhabited by an ethnic Turkic group whose origins remain somewhat enigmatic and mysterious.\n\nHighlights:\n\n♦ Chisinau - the capital and main city in Moldova.\n\n♦ Milestii Mici - the largest wine \"underground city\" in Europe, which takes place in Guinness World Records\n\n♦ Tiraspol - the capital of Transnistria a thin strip of land wedged between Moldova and Ukraine\n\n♦ Comrat - situated in the central part of the Budzhak steppe on the Yalpug river, it is the capital and the largest city of the autonomous area of Gagauzia.\n\nItinerary:\n\nDay 1.

Chisinau City Tour - Orheiul Vechi - Chisinau\n\nOur day starts with a visit to the complex of Orheiul Vechi, a significant historical and archaeological site in Moldova, located about 60 kilometers north of Chișinău. Orheiul Vechi is an open-air museum that spans several centuries of Moldovan history. The site includes remnants from various eras, including Dacian, Geto-Dacian, and medieval periods. It provides a unique insight into the life and architecture of past civilizations that inhabited this region. One of the most notable features of Orheiul Vechi is the Cave Monastery, carved into the limestone cliffs by Orthodox monks. The monastery dates back to the 13th century and includes a church and several small cells where monks lived and prayed. The site also features the remains of ancient fortresses, medieval settlements, and traditional Moldovan houses. In the afternoon, we will return to Chisinau to explore the highlights od the city. As the political, economic, and cultural heart of the country, it boasts a mix of Soviet-era buildings and modern developments, reflecting its complex past and ongoing growth. The city is known for its vast green spaces, such as Ștefan cel Mare Central Park, which offer residents and visitors a serene escape. B/-/-\n\nDay 3. Chisinau - Milesti Mici Winery - Tighina Fortress - Tiraspol (Transnistria)\n\nAfter breakfast at the hotel, we are heading to our first stop for the day - Tighina Fortress, a historic stronghold located in the city of Bender. Built in the 15th century by the Ottoman Empire, the fortress has played a crucial role in regional military history, witnessing numerous conflicts and changing hands multiple times. Its impressive walls and towers reflect a blend of Ottoman and European architectural styles. Then, we will continue to the Milesti Mici winery, renowned for housing the world's largest wine cellar - a subterranean network stretching over 200 kilometers. This extensive labyrinth stores approximately 2 million bottles of wine, earning it a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. The winery is celebrated for its high-quality red, white, and sparkling wines, produced using traditional methods and local grape varieties. In the afternoon, we will arrive in Tiraspol, the capital of Transnistria. Transnistria is a thin strip of land wedged between Moldova and Ukraine. It is home to more than 500,000 people and has a parliamentary government, a standing army, and its own currency. It has all the trappings of an independent nation—but isn't. You won't find it on many maps, and not a single member of the United Nations recognizes its existence. Visiting Tiraspol feels like traveling back in time to the period of the USSR. The cityscape is dominated by Soviet-era architecture, monuments, and symbols, including statues of Lenin and Soviet insignia, reflecting its complex political status and historical ties to the Soviet Union. Tiraspol's streets and public spaces are adorned with Soviet-style murals, and many public buildings maintain their original communist-era design. We will spend the night in a hotel in Tiraspol. B/-/-\n\nDay 4. Tiraspol - Tvarditsa - Beshalma - Comrat (Gagauzia)\n\nToday, we will explore some of the villages in the region, populated by different minority groups. We will start with a visit to the village of Tvarditsa, where the population is mostly ethnic Bulgarians who moved here in the 19th century during the wars for the liberation of Bulgaria from the Ottoman Empire. In Beshalma, we will learn more about the Gagauz community - an ethnic group with a distinct cultural and linguistic identity. They are known for their unique blend of Turkic language (Gagauz), Orthodox Christian faith, and rich traditions that reflect both their Turkic heritage and the influences of the broader Eastern European region. In the afternoon, we will arrive at Comrat - the capital of the autonomous region of Gagauzia. The region has its own assembly, executive committee, and cultural institutions to preserve and promote Gagauz's identity and heritage. Overnight in a hotel in Comrat.. B/-/-\n\nDay 5.
