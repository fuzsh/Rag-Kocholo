        "meta_description": "LWG Lausitzer Wasser GmbH &amp; Co. KG and the municipal water supply company Su Canal Comrat in the Republic of Moldova entered into an utility partnership at the end of 2023 to strengthen the water infrastructure in Comrat and improve the management of drinking water and wastewater services. Comrat, the capital of the Gagauzia region with a population of 26,400, is located in the south of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nThe first visit took place from 22 January to 25 January 2024. Five colleagues from LWG travelled to Comrat for the mission.\r\n\"Our aim is to pass on our knowledge to our colleagues in Comrat in order to raise their work to a higher level of efficiency,\" emphasised Jonas Krause from LWG Lausitzer Wasser. In the first stage, the focus will be on reducing energy consumption, increasing the use of renewable energies and developing a guideline for action, including for the renovation of the wastewater and water drainage network in Comrat. This collaboration offers the opportunity to share proven expertise and experience in order to find sustainable solutions to the challenges facing the water infrastructure. However, the challenge lies not only in the technical implementation, but also in overcoming language barriers. \"The biggest challenge could be communication, as the Moldovan colleagues primarily speak Russian and Romanian,\" explains Jonas Krause.",

        "text": "The initiative for such a project also came from Martin Apelt, the engineer and team leader of the LWG's technical office. He has already been involved in voluntary and humanitarian work in this region on several occasions. \"It is a matter close to Mr Apelt's heart to make a contribution to the people in this south-east European region and former Soviet republic. His expertise and specialist knowledge can also be used and implemented in this project, which we are happy to support and thank GIZ for funding the project,\" says Marten Eger, Managing Director of LWG. \"An exchange of experience always helps both partners move forward, which is important to me,\" emphasises the Technical Managing Director of LWG.\n\nThe plan for the current phases includes online introductions, face-to-face meetings, technical meetings and on-site visits in Moldova and Germany - an exchange of experts between the participating companies. A delegation from Su Canal Comrat is scheduled to visit Cottbus in early April to provide training in occupational safety and work on reducing water losses.\n\nThe utility partnership between the LWG and the water supply company Su Canal Comrat aims to create a future-orientated, efficient and sustainable local water infrastructure in order to improve the quality of life of citizens and make a small contribution as LWG to the global goal of worldwide sustainable development."
