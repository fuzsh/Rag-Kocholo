        "text": "In Cebu City, it is almost impossible to go anywhere and see anything that has not been dedicated to the Grand Old Man of Cebu. Whether a school, a military camp, a street, or even a fountain, the name President Sergio Osmeña Sr. has been attached to these landmarks and institutions.\n\nBorn on September 9, 1878, Sergio Suico Osmeña Sr. traces his roots to the wealthy and prominent Chinese-Mestizo clan from the old Parian District of Cebu. A historical marker along Juan Luna Street in the downtown area has been installed to mark his birthplace.\n\nBut unlike with most presidential ancestral houses we visited where the presidents were born and spent their childhood, the Osmeña Museum along Osmeña Boulevard is housed in a building built in the 1950s. It was in this house where the President Osmeña retired after his political defeat against Senator Manuel Roxas in the 1946 presidential election.\n\nThe Osmeña retirement house has been under the care of the College Assurance Plan. The ground floor is being used by the organization as office while the second floor is set up as if it was the President’s living quarters, complete with period furniture and around 500 personal belongings and memorabilia.\n\nEvery part of the museum evokes recollections of Osmena’s political career including his coats, hats, shoes, official mace and Cadillac."
