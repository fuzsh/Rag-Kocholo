Jackson of the United States Supreme Court. As the new head of the Philippine Commonwealth-in-exile, Osmeña was invited to be with Gen. MacArthur during the landing at Leyte.\n\nWhen the liberation campaign came to an end, after the unconditional surrender of Japan, Osmeña faced a formidable job of reconstruction with all the energy, wisdom and dedication of which he was capable.\n\nOsmeña was defeated by Manuel Roxas in the elections held on April 23, 1946.\n\nOsmeña then retired to his home in Cebu, where he spent the remaining years of his life until his death on October 19th 1961."
