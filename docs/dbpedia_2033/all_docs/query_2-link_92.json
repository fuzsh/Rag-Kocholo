        "text": "President Osmeña had been, throughout his life, a very religious man. He was born, bred, and educated, a Roman Catholic. He was not just another Catholic. he was a practicing Catholic.\n\nHe never missed religious obligations. He went to church regularly, and whenever time and opportunity allowed it, even daily.\n\nEven while on exile in the United States during the war years, he never failed to go to church.\n\n- Memoirs by Elpidio I. Valencia"
