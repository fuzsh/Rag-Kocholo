He was Vice President under Manuel L. Quezon, and rose to the presidency upon Quezon's death in 1944, being the oldest Philippine president to hold office at age 65. A founder of Nacionalista Party, he was the first Visayan to become President of the Philippines.\n\nPrior to his succession to the Presidency in 1944, Osmeña served as Governor of Cebufrom 1901–1907, Member and Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives from 1907–1922, and Senator from the 10th Senatorial District for thirteen years, in which capacity he served as Senate President pro tempore. In 1935, he was nominated to be the running-mate of Senate President Manuel L. Quezon for the presidential election that year. The tandem was overwhelmingly re-elected in 1941.\n\nHe was the patriarch of the prominent Osmeña family, which includes his son (former Senator Sergio Osmeña, Jr.) and his grandsons (senators Sergio Osmeña III and John Henry Osmeña), ex-governor Lito Osmeña, and Cebu City mayor Tomas Osmeña.\n\nBorn\n\nSergio Osmeña\n\nSeptember 9, 1878\n\nCebu City, Spanish East Indies\n\nDiedOctober 19, 1961 (aged 83)\n\nQuezon City, PhilippinesResting placeManila North Cemetery, Santa Cruz, Manila,\n\nPhilippines Political party Nacionalista PartySpouse(s) Estefania Veloso (1901–1918; her death); 10 children\n\nEsperanza Limjap (1920–1961; his death); 3 childrenAlma materUniversity of San Carlos\n\nSan Juan de Letran College\n\nUniversity of Santo TomasProfessionLawyer, SoldierReligionRoman Catholicism\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Osme%C3%B1a"
