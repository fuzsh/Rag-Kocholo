        "text": "The real father of former president Sergio Osmeña Sr. was finally known after 145 years.\n\nOsmeña, who was born on Sept. 9, 1878, in Cebu, was thought to have been fathered by Pedro Singson Gotiaoco, a Chinese immigrant tycoon, out of wedlock.\n\nAnother name being floated as his father is Antonio Sanson, a prominent and wealthy man who owned extensive land holdings in their hometown.\n\nBut The Philippine STAR via The Freeman reported on Sunday, June 4 that through DNA testing, it was found that his real father was Sanson.\n\nHistorians and even Osmeña's descendants have long noted how the country's first Visayan president refused to talk about his parentage, including topics about his mother Juana Osmeña.\n\nThe identity of his father was never known even after his death in 1961.\n\nTo put an end to all speculations over the years, Osmeña's descendants commissioned genealogist Todd Sales Lucero to trace his heritage.\n\nLucero used traditional genealogical methods and DNA technology to trace Osmeña's paternity.\n\nHe took DNA samples from Tomas Osmeña, the former mayor who's the direct male-line grandson of Sergio Sr. and son of ex-senator Sergio Osmeña Jr.; Pedro Go, a direct male-line grandson of Pedro Gotiaoco; and Ronnie Sanson, a direct male-line grandson of Julian Sanson, a first cousin of Antonio Sanson.\n\nFor the Osmeña-Gotiaoco DNA, only nine of the 23 markers matched but for Osmeña-Sanson DNA, it was a 100% match on all markers, the STAR reported.\n\nEx-mayor Osmeña said knowing his grandfather's real father won't define him, as it's his works and acts that really matter. In any case, he said the truth will finally put a stop to speculations.\n\nDescendants, meanwhile, told The Freeman they're all happy with the truth coming out and look forward to meeting more relatives on the Sanson side."
