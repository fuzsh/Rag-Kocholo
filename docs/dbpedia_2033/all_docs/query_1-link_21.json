They played the part of proud and liberation they conscious in new collective power that why many people demand for bigger part for the future of their country for which they fought with.\n\nManuel A. Roxas, the third of the Quezon Osmeña triumvirate credited with the struggle for Philippine independence from the American regime, was born on January 1, 1892 in Capiz, Capiz, now Roxas City.

Rodriguez, invited the Ford Foundation and\n\nthe Rockefeller Foundation \"to establish a rice research institute\" in Los Baños, Laguna. This led to the establishment of the International Rice Research Institute in 1960.\n\nRepublic Cultural Award\n\nIn addition to his laws and programs, the Garcia administration also put emphasis on reviving the Filipino culture.
