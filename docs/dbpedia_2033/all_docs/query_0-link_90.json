        "text": "The Fuente Osmeña Circle is not your typical nature park. Some know it as the popular circular field in the heart of Cebu City, or as one of the liveliest venues during the Sinulog parade.\n\nIt has all you want in a park – a spacious field for recreational activities, a walkway for jogging, and benches to kick back and enjoy the ambiance.\n\nThis recreational area, aptly dubbed “The Heart of Cebu,” also celebrates one of the most notable Cebuanos in Philippine history.\n\nSERGIO OSMEÑA\n\nThe park commemorates the “Grand Old Man” Sergio Osmeña, Sr., the first and only Cebuano to be elected President of the Philippines. Osmeña succeeded Manuel L. Quezon to become the country’s fourth President from 1944 to 1946.\n\nBorn on September 9, 1878, Osmeña was a distinguished lawyer who graduated from the University of Santo Tomas, the oldest school in the country, in 1903. Three years after graduating, he became the provincial governor of Cebu at 28.\n\nDespite having little political experience, Osmeña maintained order and cooperation in the province, building trust in the municipal government.\n\nHe traveled to the United States on multiple missions to fight for Philippine independence. Osmeña was elected President after Quezon passed away from tuberculosis in 1944.\n\nHe was Vice President under the Quezon administration since the implementation of the Commonwealth in 1935.\n\nOsmeña lost his re-election campaign to Manuel Roxas in the first election of the Philippines as an independent republic in 1946.\n\nDespite his short tenure as the head of state, Osmeña remained an integral figure in Cebu’s political history, becoming the patriarch of one of the country’s most prominent political families.\n\nSeveral relatives of Osmeña Sr. held mayoral, gubernatorial, congressional, and even legislative positions in the government throughout the years.\n\nA circular walkway surrounds the outer portion of the park, ideal for leisurely activities like jogging or taking a stroll. You can also sit and relax on one of the many benches in the area.\n\nThe open grass field is perfect for more intense outdoor activities, like dancing or martial arts. It’s spacious enough, and the surrounding trees make it convenient to hang out during the day.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT AT FUENTE\n\nThe good thing about public transportation in Cebu is that there are many routes you can take when traveling around the city.\n\nThere are also many business establishments in the area, from famous fast food chains and small-scale eateries to large shopping malls. It is also within walking distance of Mango Avenue, the famous nightlife area in Cebu City, known for its numerous bars and clubs.\n\nYou can expect a large crowd in December, where they light up the Tree of Hope every year. Many Cebuanos go to the park to hang out and enjoy the festivities in the evening during this time.\n\nThe Fuente Osmeña Circle pays homage to the only Cebuano to be elected President of the Philippines. Its name translates to Osmeña’s fountain, commemorating the dedicated statesman’s efforts to bring independence to the country.\n\nThe park continues to host some of Cebu’s most awaited events, making it more recognizable than other notable historical landmarks.\n\nIt is an iconic structure that is closely associated with Cebu and is undoubtedly the city’s most well-known nature park.\n\nHOW TO GET THERE"
