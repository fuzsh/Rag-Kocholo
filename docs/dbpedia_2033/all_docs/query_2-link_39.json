        "text": "Background\n\nOsmeña was born on September 9, 1878 in Cebu City, Philippines to Juana Osmeña y Suico, who was reportedly only 14 years of age at the time. Owing to the circumstances of his birth, the identity of his father had been a closely guarded family secret, allegedly a Go related to the now Gokongwei. Although carrying the stigma of being an illegitimate child -\n\nJuana never married his father - he did not allow this aspect to affect his standing in society. The Osmeña family, a rich and prominent clan of Chinese Filipino heritage with vast business interests in Cebu, warmed to him as he established himself as a prominent figure in local society.\n\nCareer\n\nOsmeña served as prosecuting attorney of several provinces and in 1904 was chosen provincial governor of Cebu. He became a member of the Philippine Assembly in 1907 and was immediately and unanimously chosen speaker of that body. In 1922 he was elected to the Senate to lead the independence movement in the upper chamber. He was the leader of the Independence Mission of 1931 to the United States, which culminated in the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act, the forerunner of Philippine independence. This act, however, was rejected by the Philippine Senate under the leadership of Manuel Quezon. In 1934, after Osmeña and Quezon had exchanged positions, Osmeña supported the Tydings-McDuffie Act, providing complete independence for the Philippines. In 1935 the rival factions of the Nacionalista Party, led by Osmeña and Quezon, united in the interests of national independence, and Osmeña became vice-president of the commonwealth. As a result of the prolonged illness of President Quezon, Osmeña's responsibilities as vice-president were great, especially during the years of the government in exile during World War II. He acceded to the presidency of the Philippine Commonwealth upon the death of Quezon on August 1, 1944, and three months later accompanied General MacArthur's invasion troops onto the beaches of Leyte. After his return to the Philippines, Osmeña seemed more hesitant and chose a middle ground on most of the issues. He was unable to regain his former popular appeal, and his popularity declined. His opponent, Manuel Roxas, after campaigning aggressively, was elected to the presidency of the new republic, and the interim Commonwealth, in April 1946. Osmeña died in Manila, October 19, 1961."
