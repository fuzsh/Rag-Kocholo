        "text": "Sex refers to your biological sex that you were assigned at birth (e.g. male, female, intersex).\n\nIntersex refers to those whose sexual or reproductive anatomies do not fall under the typical definitions of male or female. People who are intersex may identify as men, women, or non-binary genders.\n\nSexual orientation refers to who it is that you are romantically and/or sexually attracted to. It also goes deeper than this and includes people who you form strong emotional or mental bonds with. You do not have to be certain of your sexual orientation or pick a label.\n\nQuestioning describes individuals who are working to understand their sexual orientation or their gender identity. People who are questioning may continue doing this throughout their lives or may eventually identify with a specific orientation or identity.\n\nGender identity refers to the gender with which you identify. These typically involve man, woman, and non-binary genders. To better understand gender, it is important to understand that the gender binary, which assumes that the only two genders are men and women, is limited in scope and fails to recognize and account for the various gender identities that can exist.\n\nNon-binary describes individuals whose gender identities go beyond the binary categories of “man” and “woman” such as gender non-conforming, gender-fluid, or genderqueer. Some transgender individuals identify as non-binary as well.\n\nGender non-conforming describes those who do not adhere to traditional ideas and stereotypes about how they should look and act based on their biological sex.\n\nGender-fluid describes those whose gender identity may change over time.\n\nGenderqueer describes those whose gender identity does not adhere to and is not represented by the gender binary (man or woman).\n\nTransgender individuals are those whose biological sex is different than their gender identity.\n\nSexual orientations typically include, but are not limited to, gay and lesbian (e.g. attraction only to your same gender), straight (e.g. attraction only to a binary gender opposite yours), or another sexual orientation which can include bisexual (e.g. you are attracted to men and women), pansexual (e.g. you are attracted to people regardless of their gender), demisexual (e.g. you are only attracted to individuals you have formed a close emotional bond with, regardless of physical characteristics) and beyond.\n\nNote that while the term gay formerly described only men who were attracted to men it can also be used to refer to anyone who is predominantly or only attracted to their own gender. The term lesbian generally refers to women who are mostly or only attracted to other women. The bisexual, pansexual, and demisexual categories are included as one group for the purposes of this quiz because their definitions broadly involve attraction to more than one gender. Still, they are distinct from one another and are different points along the same spectrum of sexual fluidity. You do not have to belong to any specific category.\n\nMore facts behind the Gay Test"
