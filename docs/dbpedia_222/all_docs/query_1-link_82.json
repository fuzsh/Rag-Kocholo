        "text": "‘After five years, do you have to be so piss-elegant?’\n\nA married school teacher comes under suspicion when one of the girls from his school is murdered on the banks of the river Thames. The police discover he’s romantically involved with one of her classmates, and the couple was in the area when the crime occurred. Then another student from the school is kidnapped and killed…\n\nBrutal, complex Italian-West German Giallo that pulls few punches as its narrative unfolds. Director Massimo Dallamano co-writes with Bruno Di Geronimo, and the two deliver a tight, intricate thriller that mixes serious themes with a compelling mystery.\n\nDashing young gym master Enrico Rossini (Fabio Testi) works at an all-girl Catholic school where he is popular with the students, if not the older faculty members. His wife Herta (Karin Baal) also teaches there and suspects him of playing around, as their marriage has disintegrated into recriminations and squabbling. Her instincts prove to be spot on as Testi has begun a secret relationship with 18-year-old student Elizabeth Seccles (Cristina Galbó). The lovebirds are busy canoodling in a boat on the river when the first killing happens nearby, and Galbó glimpses the flash of a knife and a dark figure, although she’s unsure exactly what she’s witnessed.\n\nHearing about the murder the following day, Testi rushes to the scene. His impulsive action puts him firmly in the crosshairs of lead investigator Inspector Barth (Joachim Fuchsberger), as the victim was a girl from his school. Testi denies being in the vicinity, of course, to avoid embarrassing explanations. Galbó also clams up, despite the victim being a friend, believing that her testimony is too vague to be of much help anyway. Then, a second girl from her class, Jane Bryant (Pilar Castel), is kidnapped outside her home one night and viciously slain.\n\nTesti and Galbó come clean to the Inspector, the girl believing that the figure she glimpsed on the river bank was dressed in a long, black robe like a priest. The investigation focuses on the school, with Headmaster Mr Leach (Rainer Penkert) and his staff coming under official scrutiny. As well as Testi and Baal, there’s the nervous Professor Newton (Antonio Casale), clerics Father Webber (Marco Mariani) and Father Herbert (Antonio Anelli), Professor Bascombe (Günther Stoll) and history master Joesph Kane (John Gayford). Fuchsberger theorises that one of them used secrets revealed in the church confessional to target his victims. Meanwhile, Testi pursues an independent line of enquiry and comes to believe that the solution lies with a mysterious and elusive girl named Solange Beauregard (Camille Keaton).\n\nFirst and foremost, this is a very serious-minded thriller with some uncomfortable moments and shocking elements, enhanced by director Dallamano’s grounded, matter-of-fact approach. There are no outlandish set pieces here or overt visual flamboyance, with the occasional flourish so well-integrated into the presentation that it passes almost unseen. The film also addresses some dark themes other than teenage homicide. Sexual repression and catholic guilt are the catalysts for the tragedy that unfolds as acts of adolescent rebellion lead to life-changing consequences and, eventually, murder.\n\nThere is plenty to unpack in Dallamano’s film, but it’s still principally a mystery. Who is the killer, and what can the motive be behind the slaughter? The director offers few clues as events unwind, but the mystery is constantly absorbing rather than frustrating, and very few viewers will likely have worked out anything of significance with barely a quarter of an hour of the runtime remaining. Everything ties up neatly in the end, although a few minor plot points don’t bear close scrutiny.\n\nDallamano’s handling of Galbó’s role in the story is the only weak point. It’s never really clear how she manages to see what she does that day by the river. Later on, the nightmare that triggers her memory of the long, dark robe worn by the killer coincides with the moments of Castel’s murder. It’s almost as if Galbó has a psychic link with the assassin. However, the idea is never developed any further or presented with any real credibility. The undercurrent of hostility toward the catholic church is handled far better, though, with the girls ultimately as much the victims of a lack of guidance and out-moded teaching as the killer’s blade.\n\nThe cast delivers good performances across the board, aided by the depth with which the characters are written. Testi is hardly the conventional hero, professing his love for Galbó while simultaneously attempting to lay her, scarcely appropriate behaviour for a teacher towards a schoolgirl, even if she is (just about) of age. Some justification is present initially in the conduct of his wife, Baal, who is cold, bitter and antagonistic. However, subsequent developments cause the audience to side with her rather than the feckless Testi, and these character shadings help to keep the audience invested and off-balance. There’s also an eye-catching turn from Keaton as the wordless Solange, her eyes, gestures, and body language conveying far more than reams of dialogue could.\n\nDallamano also infuses proceedings with a heavy sense of voyeurism, his camera work often inviting the audience to participate. Characters are seen through keyholes, undergrowth and, briefly, in the confessional. Shot composition is also meticulous and deliberate; the camera often focuses on the actor furthest away while the other is very close to the lens at the edge of the frame. This approach is never distracting and helps to heighten the feel of eavesdropping on private conversations. However, making one of the characters an actual peeping tom is a little on the nose and feels somewhat redundant. The general attention to realism means that there’s plenty of teenage flesh on display, but the director is careful never to sexualise his young cast and tip the film over into the exploitation arena.\n\nTechnical credits are also high with high-quality work, particularly the understated, masterful score by legendary composer Ennio Morricone. His incredible 60-year career brought dozens of awards, including a much-overdue Oscar for Quentin Tarantino’s ‘The Hateful Eight (2015). The lighting and cinematography by Aristide Massaccesi are also top-notch, but his subsequent career was unlikely to merit the attention of academy voters. He directed almost 200 films under multiple names but is best known as Joe D’Amato, the alias he assumed here. Projects ranged from several entries in the adult ‘Emanuelle’ series, to post-apocalyptic shenanigans like ‘2020 Texas Gladiators’ (1983) and ‘Endgame’ (1983), to three entries in the abysmal sword and sorcery series featuring Ator, the Fighting Eagle, which culminated in the truly dreadful ‘Quest For The Mighty Sword’ (1990). Most of his later time was spent in the hardcore arena, delivering video gems such as ‘Some Like It Hard’ (1995) and ‘Anal Strippers X-Posed’ (1997). Occasionally, he ventured into horror with low-budget exploitation titles like ‘Zombie 5: Killing Birds’ (1985) (starring Robert Vaughn!) and ‘Frankenstein 2000’ (1992).\n\nSadly, Dallamano’s life was cut short by a car crash in November 1976. He’d begun his career as a cinematographer just after the Second World War, arguably reaching its peak with his work on the first two films in Sergio Leone’s ‘Dollars’ trilogy starring Clint Eastwood. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his first directorial assignment was the well-regarded Spaghetti Western ‘Bandidos’ (1967). It was the final film on which he worked as a cinematographer. He followed up with the excellent Giallo ‘A Black Veil For Lisa/La Morte Non Ha Sesso (1968) and his trashy but undeniably enjoyable take on Oscar Wilde’s ‘Dorian Gray/Das Bildnis des Dorian Gray (1970). Subsequently, he tried his hand in several genres, including comedy, supernatural horror and the police procedural, the latter being a vital element in his other excursion into Giallo ‘What Have They Done to Your Daughters?/La polizia chiede aiuto’ (1974).\n\nTesti worked his way into the film industry as a stuntman and with uncredited bits in well-known films such as ‘Barbarella’ (1967) and Sergio Leone’s ‘Once Upon A Time in the West’ (1968). He quickly graduated to second leads in smaller productions like obscure Giallo ‘Death Knocks Twice/Blonde Köder für den Mörder’ (1969). Leading roles in low-budget adventures followed, such as ‘The Avenger, Zorro/El Zorro justiciero’ (1969) (which seems to have remained unreleased for three years) and the Spaghetti Western ‘One Day at Dawn…Django Meets Sartana!/Quel maledetto giorno d’inverno… Django e Sartana all’ultimo sangue’ (1970). His big break came courtesy of Vittorio De Sica’s Oscar-winning ‘The Garden of the Finzi-Continis/Il giardino dei Finzi Contini’ (1970), which firmly established his status as a leading man in his homeland. He has worked steadily since and successfully transitioned to television in the 1980s.\n\nAmerican-born Keaton became somewhat famous as the lead in the controversial rape-revenge vehicle ‘I Spit On Your Grave’ (1978), which bothered many a sweaty film censor in the early days of video home rental. Following on from her appearance as Solange, Keaton had taken the lead in Riccardo Freda’s horror ‘Tragic Ceremony/Estratto dagli archivi segreti della polizia di una capitale europea’ (1972). However, the film only received a limited release, even in Italy, although it has been restored for blu ray in recent years. A couple of other undistinguished horror projects followed, and she returned to America for the notorious ‘I Spit On Your Grave’ (1978). A few scattered appearances over the next few years seemed to indicate the end of her career. However, working the convention circuit in the new century led to a return in low-budget horror ‘Sella Turcica’ (2010). Subsequent projects included Rob Zombie’s ‘The Lords of Salem’ (2012) and independent horror films where she rubbed shoulders with veteran genre stalwarts such as Barbara Steele, Gunnar Hansen, Tony Todd, Heather Langenkamp, Dee Wallace, P J Soles and Adrienne Barbeau. She reprised her role as Jennifer in the belated sequel ‘I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu’ (2019) and took the lead in the home invasion drama ‘Cry for the Bad Man’ (2019).\n\nA Giallo for those seeking more than just extravagant kills and an escalating body count. Essential viewing for fans, and with some appeal to more mainstream audiences.\n\n‘Our annexe is used for unusual guests and their extravagant desires.’\n\nA young blonde is found strangled on a moonlit beach, and her priceless necklace is missing. With the police at a loss, her husband turns to a small private detective agency to bring the murderer to justice…\n\nUnfocused meander through some well-worn mystery tropes in this Italian Giallo from director Harald Philipp, who doesn’t seem to have a sufficient grasp of the various elements to connect them in a satisfying manner. There’s the ‘cookie-cutter’ whodunnit puzzle, the hunt for the valuable jewel, feuding mobsters, and a hero who comes over as a cut-price James Bond.\n\nMoonlight washes the empty beach where handsome young artist Francesco Villaverde (Fabio Testi) frolics with beautiful blonde Lois Simmons (Femi Benussi). Little do they know that they’re being watched by handyman Riccardo (Mario Brega) who seems to be enjoying the show. But when things start to get really interesting, Testi has some kind of a psychotic episode, and Benussi is found dead in the sand shortly afterwards.\n\nBenussi’s older husband, Mr Simmonds (Renato Baldini) engages local P.I. Pepe (Leon Askin) after the police fail to find the killer (and barely appear in the movie at all). Askin can’t do it alone though and convinces smooth American operator Bob Martin (Dean Reed) to help. This doesn’t sit well with Reed’s girlfriend Ellen (Ini Assmann) who thought they were going back to the States to get hitched. So he brings her along on the job instead, which turns out to be a shrewd tactical move.\n\nYou see, Askin and Reed have already pegged Testi as the likely culprit, mainly because he’s painted a nude of the murdered girl and the picture includes the missing necklace. It’s a mystery why the police didn’t tag him as ‘a person of interest’, especially considering his past predisposition to violence towards women and time spent in a mental hospital. Still, I guess they had good reason to rule him out. Reed then has Askin and Assmann pose as father and daughter and ensures that she and Testi meet and get close. What a guy! Pimping out his girlfriend to a psychotic killer while he gets handsy with the local girls working the mob-fronted hotel ‘The Sun and Sea’. Of course, that’s all part of his investigation and completely necessary.\n\nThis dubious boarding establishment is run by Charley Hemman (Werner Peters) and Amato Locatelli (Riccardo Garrone), who run crooked gambling on the ‘Estrella’ floating just offshore, as well as letting their girls roll drunks in the bar. But they have a problem; a jumbo loan due to mobster Ferretti, who sends his wife Sophia (Anita Ekberg) and enforcer the Professor (Adolfo Celi) to collect.\n\nThe original release of this film is listed as having a running time of 96 minutes. That accounts to some extent for the disjointed feel the film has now because almost 20 minutes of footage is missing in the versions currently available. These missing scenes might have helped establish one of these story threads as the primary focus. As it plays now, the initial murder investigation begins taking a back seat to the mob-related intrigue before the two join rather clumsily for the climax.\n\nWithout giving too much away, Peters and Garrone decide to avoid paying back the mob loan by having Testi and maneater Ekberg meet. Hopefully, bedroom antics and murder will follow. How they can be sure that Testi is the killer and how this outcome would get them out of hock with an organised crime syndicate anyway is a bit obscure, but hey! At least it’s a plan. Meanwhile, Reed makes instant friends with Peters’ vicious attack dog, Fritz, after a dip in the pool. I guess the canine recognises a nice bloke when he meets one. This looks like it’s going to be vital at the finish, but then it isn’t. Sure, Fritz the Wonder Dog lends a helpful paw, but I think Reed would have coped on his own.\n\nWhat would make a far more interesting film than this is the story of Reed’s life. After first training as an actor, he signed to Capitol Records in 1958 as a singer, being promoted to the teenage market. Although never very successful on home turf he was a big hit in South America and, while on tour there in the early 1960s developed a radical political philosophy that had him tagged back home as ‘Red Elvis.’ Rather than return to the U.S., he remained in Argentina until a change of government saw him deported, and he relocated to Europe, spending a lot of time in East Germany. His records continued to sell, and he was immensely popular in the Soviet Union where he also toured.\n\nReed was a vocal opponent of American foreign policy, but never renounced his U.S. citizenship and continued to file the necessary tax returns. An appearance on CBS’ ’60 Minutes’ in 1986 provoked hate mail when he compared U.S. President Ronald Reagan to Josef Stalin. Six weeks afterwards, Reed was found dead near his home in East Berlin. The official verdict was accidental drowning, but suicide was suspected because of problems with his third marriage. A suicide note was uncovered after German reunification in 1990, but members of his family still believe that he was murdered. A documentary in 2004 also floated the possibilities that he was working for the KGB, the Stasi or the CIA.\n\nA muddled and clumsy Giallo that will appeal only to completists. The original cut probably solves some of its issues, but it’s hard to believe that it would result in a very significant improvement."
