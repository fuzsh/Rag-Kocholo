Make it two, they’re small.\n\nVerson Jetorix: “Fabio Testi foils a faked kidnapping attempt on a rich industrialist so he can get a job as the man’s bodyguard. Tonino Valeri’s crime film, inspired by events in the chaotic Italy of the time, is an action-packed and slightly wacky ride.”\n\nOliver Reed breaks up a foursome with J&B.\n\nVerson Jetorix: “Pretty good slice of Fabio Testi Eurocrime despite Oliver Reed being in it.”\n\nA nice shot of Fabio Testi and a bottle of J&B.\n\nVerson Jetorix: “Undercover cop Fabio Testi working for David Hemmings takes on the drug trade in this fashion-challenged thriller. Not much to write home about, really, the usual stuff. The villains weren’t strong enough to make much of an impression.”\n\nSalverio Marconi grabs the J&B.\n\nThe mob bosses meet around a bottle of J&B.\n\nPicture postcard J&B.\n\nRomano Puppo breaks up the party with his machine gun.\n\nVerson Jetorix: “Fucli/Testi crime. Not a classic in my view.”"
