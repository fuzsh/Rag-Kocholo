        "text": "Starring: Cristina Galbo, Fabio Testi, Joachim Fuchsberger\n\nDirector: Massimo Dallamano\n\nMassimo Dallamano’s infamous giallo concerns a group of posh Catholic schoolgirls who are being butchered in a highly sexualized manner by a crazed assailant. One of the girls (Cristina Galbo) thinks she has glimpsed the killer, and meanwhile the randy gym teacher (Fabio Testi) with whom she’s having an affair finds himself liked for the murders by the local plod (Joachim Fuchsberger).\n\nLushly shot in ‘scope on location in England, the film transplants all the usual beloved giallo tropes to an upper crust, decidedly unswinging London. Aside from a plethora of mini skirts, there’s little evidence of the sexual revolution having taken place, but this actually works to the film’s advantage, making its fantasy vision of a leafy, genteel London seem less rooted in its time than that all those movies that tried to cash in on ’60s psychedelia.\n\nThere’s a peculiar echo of Hitchcock’s Psycho in the story structure, which falls rather awkwardly into two halves. That aside, though, What Have You Done to Solange? offers – by giallo standards – a satisfying and logical mystery puzzle, along with everything else you would hope for in a movie of this genre: opulent scene-setting, pretty young actresses, a pervasive air of kinkiness and a controlled brutality in the set-pieces – as in a pivotal bathtub murder which still has a visceral power to shock. Its sexual attitudes are contradictory and unreconstructed, but it’s far more beautiful to look at than most other films made in Britain at the time. 7/10\n\nTRANSFER\n\nA very nice HD transfer, with no grain or damage and a sharp level of detail, and the typically Italian palette of earthy browns, ruddy skin tones and faded blues (plus acid English greens) comes across beautifully. The early Thameside sequences look very fresh and dewy, the wide-angle shots inside the girl’s school have a 3D depth, and the amber-lit scenes of the pupils taking confession are also very crisp. There’s a choice of English or Italian audio. The latter is perfectly serviceable, but the English dub, with its more nuanced script and voice acting, is the place to start. (The actors actually spoke the dialogue in English to help with the lip synch.) 8/10"
