        "text": "The question of politics in Italian cinema continues to exercise critics and scholars to a remarkable degree. This is demonstrated by several contemporary research initiatives, and by the continued deployment of the concept of political or social commitment (impegno) as a live and value term in the writing of Italian cinema history. Contributors to this roundtable were invited to interrogate critical assumptions about political value in Italian cinema, and to consider the various ways in which a film or genre can deal with politics or be deemed ‘political’. The roundtable is grouped roughly into three sections: the first deals with cinema and politics from a variety of historical and theoretical perspectives; the second deals with different genres and modes; the third deals with individual filmmakers and their films. In this introduction I do not try to summarize the articles, which should be read on their own terms, but limit myself to gesturing at certain themes that seemed to me to emerge as important across the sections.\n\nIn the period between 1948 (and the first elections of the new Republic, that put the DC in charge of the country) and 1978 (when the first erotic cinemas emerged in Italy), Italian cinema was characterized by increasingly sexualized representations. This timeframe saw a high level of conflict in public discourses on the “question of sex”, intended broadly, which brought into question issues like intimacy, affective relationships, the construction of gender roles and identities. All of these processes merged in that overall “transformation of intimacy” that sociologist Anthony Giddens identified: the public emergence of the private meant that spaces once regulated at a personal and individual level became socially pertinent, and the object of collective negotiations. In parallel, there was a radical change in habits (synthesized in the legal concept of “buon costume”, public morality), with a progressive weakening of a so-called sense of decency. In 1969, Callisto Cosulich had already recognized this phenomenon, describing it with the metaphor of the “Italian cinema’s ascent to sex”: an ascent that corresponded concretely to the diffusion of a sexualized imaginary, that was predominantly embodied in the eroticization of the female body. In the very years of Cosulich’s volume, the sexualization of cinema had started to overlap with the first appearances of mass-produced pornography, in print, for adults. Within just a few years, cinematic porn was to break free of its isolation, via two semi-institutional channels that paralleled the mainstream: private televisions and adult film theatres. The end of the 1970s appeared to signal the end of this phenomenon, described by Ortoleva as the definitive “decline of obscenity taboos”. The conference aims to stimulate discussion between the disciplines of film and historical studies, on the main themes of the PRIN 2015 research project Comizi d’amore, and in particular on four general questions: - the role played by cinema in the progressive sexualization of the media system (and in particular the popular press, which the project has already mapped out extensively, as available on its database); - the role of cinema within a series of key historical junctions for the project’s theme (the clericalization of institutions during the Centrist years, the Merlin Law, the creation of the centreleft, youth movements, the feminist movement, gay liberation, the sexual revolution, debates on divorce and abortion, reforms of family rights); - the connection between the sexualization of cinema and the emergence of pornography; - the specificities of the Italian case."
