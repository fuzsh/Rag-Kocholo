        "text": "Vanity set\n\nLarke Optics and Frank\n\nFrom a vanity set in luminous acetate to a bold lipstick and scarf, there’s beauty in this bespoke set. Inspired by the French ivory vanity sets that were de rigueur during the late 19th century, Larke Optics and Frank have created a modern-day dresser set which comprises a hand mirror, three accessory trays, a lidded box and a vase. Made from Larke’s signature luminous acetates, each piece has been crafted using the tools and techniques of spectacle production.\n\nLarke Optics\n\nA spectacle wearer since childhood, Laura Nicholson launched her company Larke Optics in 2013. Backed by a keen eye for craftsmanship and individuality, Larke’s bold, architectural frames are handmade in England from finely patterned Italian acetate. www.larkeoptics.com\n\nFrank\n\nFrank is a London design studio run by Pam West and Matt Edmonds. Since launching in 2001, it has enjoyed an ongoing partnership with Established & Sons, designing its ‘M5’ table, ‘Corona’ lamp and the ‘Store’ vessels. The studio also designs captivating retail interiors and exhibitions. www.frankhome.co.uk\n\n'Maiden Voyage' lipstick and scarf\n\nLinder and Lipstick Queen\n\nInspired by her travels, ‘Maiden Voyage’ is artist Linder’s take on lipstick. ‘I’m leading a nomadic existence at the moment, with a feeling of being permanently en voyage,’ she explains. She has certainly explored the colour spectrum thanks to the savoir-faire of beauty brand Lipstick Queen. Linder has also designed an elegant scarf, featuring her own artwork, to match the bold lipstick.\n\nLinder\n\nBritish visual artist Linder has mastered the art of collage over three decades of experimenting with two-dimensional and three-dimensional forms as well as light, music and textiles. Her striking compositions feature the female body and traditional ideas of beauty borrowed from both contemporary culture and fine art.\n\nLipstick Queen\n\nEntrepreneur Poppy King founded Lipstick Queen aged 18, when she failed to find a lipstick to her liking. Developing it into a brand that strives to answer women’s quest to find the lipstick of a lifetime, King has, 20 years on, created a colour library that covers both the classic and the unexpected. www.lipstickqueen.com\n\nVanity clutch\n\nSalako and Isaac Reina\n\nWith the organisational capabilities of a well ordered beauty bag and the sleek looks of a clutch, this dual-purpose concept by Jimo Salako makes a stylish travelling companion. Realised in collaboration with Isaac Reina in soft navy leather, the bag’s simple construction lends it a sophisticated edge. Its discreet form has room to hold grooming essentials, while functional details such as a magnetic closing and removable elastic grips inside add to its practicality.\n\nSalako\n\nHair stylist Jimo Salako has worked for a host of fashion brands including Comme des Garçons, Fendi and Stella McCartney, as well as a plethora of magazines. In 2013, he expanded his reach by opening the Salako salon in London, offering his legendary haircuts to a wider public. His sculptural creations were recently seen at New York’s MoMA as part of a Björk retrospective. www.salakolondon.com\n\nIsaac Reina\n\nSpanish-born Isaac Reina established his eponymous leather goods brand in Paris in 2006. With a background in architecture and fashion (and previous experience as the design assistant to Véronique Nichanian, Hermès’ menswear director), Reina approaches his product work with formal simplicity, attention to detail and a remarkable colour sensibility. www.isaacreina.com\n\n‘Nail me!’ nail jobs\n\nPhilippe Malouin, Kenzo, Wallpaper* and Nails Inc.\n\nWith our unique new nail bar up and running we turned to friends Philippe Malouin and Kenzo to contribute the ultimate nail job. And we couldn't resist adding our own colour, Wallpaper* Blue, to this grooming fest. Developed with paper expert James Cropper, it has become our signature shade. Powered by Nails Inc., this trio of nail jobs explores our passion for colour, material and good design.\n\nPhilippe Malouin\n\nIts speckled surface mimicking a Milanese floor, Philippe Malouin's terrazzo-print nail appliqué combines marble and granite crumbs over a cement base. www.philippemalouin.com\n\nKenzo\n\nWith a nod to Kenzo's S/S 2015 menswear collection, Humberto Leon and Carol Lim's nail features dynamic stripes – a miniature version of the Kenzo universe. www.kenzo.com\n\nNails Inc.\n\nInspired by the nail bars of New York, Thea Green founded Nails Inc. in 1999 in London. It offers a vast palette, exclusive colours, and pattern collaborations. www.nailsinc.com\n\nSide table\n\nAldo Bakker and De Castelli\n\nThe brief for Aldo Bakker’s Handmade project was loose – it just had to fit with this year’s entertaining theme. With metal handcrafting specialist De Castelli, he moulded a single sheet of brass into a table with the perfect proportions for handling an espresso and some biscotti.\n\nAldo Bakker\n\nBakker sketches first, then finds a function afterwards. Many of his pieces are produced for galleries, but some have found their place in the collections of Georg Jensen, Puiforcat and Sèvres. www.aldobakker.com\n\nDe Castelli\n\nA host of high profile designers – including Michele de Lucchi, Philippe Nigro and Aldo Cibic – have sought out De Castelli’s advanced metal handcrafting skills to produce pieces under the De Castelli Edition brand. www.decastelli.com\n\nFruit bowl\n\nStudio Zanini and Villa della Pietra\n\nReferencing Brazilian modernist architecture, designer Zanini de Zanine chose to forgo the traditional fruit bowl shape for a flat, tray-like surface with a small sunken section. Carved from Armani marble, the resulting piece will turn even a humble bunch of bananas or row of apples into a domestic sculpture.\n\nStudio Zanini\n\nBorn in Rio de Janeiro, Zanini de Zanine spent his formative years working with Sergio Rodrigues. Recently named Maison&Objet Americas Designer of the Year, Zanini produces furniture for his own studio, as well as for global brands such as Cappellini. www.studiozanini.com.br\n\nVilla della Pietra\n\nBrazilian stone supplier Villa della Pietra, based near São Paulo, specialises in natural materials, such as limestone and marble, for use in residential projects, as well as in the production of smaller designs, such as elegant vases. www.villadellapietra.com.br\n\nSpoon set\n\nDavid Collins Studio and Cutipol\n\nInspired by his personal collection of vintage cutlery, Simon Rawlings, creative director of David Collins Studio, devised this spoon set, appropriate for cheese, oysters, eggs, caviar, sorbet and soup. Using Cutipol’s Goa range as a starting point, the handles feature the studio’s signature blue shade.\n\nDavid Collins Studio\n\nThe David Collins Studio is renowned for its sophisticated interiors of restaurants, bars, stores and private homes. The studio is now led by Simon Rawlings. www.davidcollins.com\n\nCutipol\n\nPortuguese family-owned firm Cutipol makes beautifully handcrafted cutlery, combining a spirit of innovation with the preservation of traditional manufacturing techniques. www.cutipol.pt\n\n'Table Dressing’ off-site installation\n\nBrioni and Lobmeyr\n\nWhen designing this year’s A/W collection for Brioni, creative director Brendan Mullane had turned to Vienna’s Spanish Riding School and the Wiener Werkstätte for inspiration. In response to this Austrian influence, we worked with Mullane alongside celebrated Viennese glassmaker Lobmeyr to honour the country’s aesthetic heritage. The result of our creative conversation was a striking table, taking centre stage in the courtyard, which featured six tabletop guests – miniature mannequins created especially by Brioni – outfitted in replicas from the Brioni collection, which had been reproduced in painstaking detail by Brioni’s master tailors at its Penne factory. Our dinner party also included six full-size Brioni-clad mannequins. www.brioni.com; www.lobmeyr.at\n\n‘Naja’ drinks-menu magnifier\n\nRon Arad, Smith & Harris and Louisa Guinness\n\nRon Arad’s playful ‘Naja’ magnifying glass is an evolution of the classic monocle. Developed in collaboration with metalworker Smith & Harris and jewellery gallerist Louisa Guinness, the serpentine gold tube design is named after the Naja cobra.\n\nRon Arad\n\nArad’s work spans large-scale buildings and iconic product design. Recent accolades include becoming a Royal Academician in 2013. www.ronarad.co.uk\n\nSmith & Harris\n\nSilversmith Dennis Smith and jeweller Gareth Harris launched their company in 1980, producing metalwork that ranges from large sculptural objects to fine jewellery. www.smithandharris.com\n\nLouisa Guinness\n\nGuinness works with artists such as Anish Kapoor and Grayson Perry to develop pieces that merge artistic fair with fine silversmithing. www.louisaguinnessgallery.com\n\n‘Magnify on a Stick’ food-menu magnifier\n\nLindberg and Ludwig Reiter\n\nWe don’t need help reading our dinner menus (yet), but we would be delighted to flourish this ‘Magnify on a Stick’ magnifying glass – composed of a black-coated, rose-gold stick and an anaconda leather wristband – at any table.\n\nLindberg\n\nDanish design tradition and technical innovation meet in Lindberg’s eyewear, handcrafted using carefully sourced materials. www.lindberg.com\n\nLudwig Reiter\n\nThis family-run shoe manufacturer has been handcrafting Goodyear welted shoes and fine leather goods from its Vienna base since 1885. www.ludwig-reiter.com\n\nBike flask\n\nYorgo Tloupas and Martell\n\nThe invention of designer and keen cyclist Yorgo Tloupas combines a water flask with a compartment for a post-ride celebratory drink. Working with cognac maker Martell’s style director, Axelle de Buffevent, he designed the water section in steel and, for the cognac, a screw-in glass base. The cap is attached with a leather tab, and the whole clips into a standard bike bottle clasp: shown here on a chrome frame by bespoke bike maker Heritage-Paris. www.heritage-paris.com\n\nYorgo Tloupas\n\nParis-based Tloupas is an art director who co-founded the studio Yorgo&Co in 2011. An avid snowboarder and biker, he has combined art direction for the likes of Cartier, Lacoste, Saint Laurent and Intersection Magazine (which he co-founded) with championship-level bike polo and co-ownership of ski firm Black Crows. He recently spent time in the Martell archives researching a logo redesign. www.yorgo.co\n\nMartell\n\nFrench cognac house Martell celebrates its 300th anniversary this year and is honouring the landmark with exclusive editions, artist collaborations and celebratory dinners. Also for the occasion, style director Axelle de Buffevent, who is behind the brand’s more adventurous artistic collaborations, has worked with Yorgo Tloupas to redesign the Martell logo and its emblematic swallow. www.martell.com\n\nCrossword\n\nJulia and Smythson\n\nFor our Handmade show in Salone, we decided to create a puzzle that visitors could take on and conquer, so we matched stationery brand Smythson with Julia, a design practice known for its playful use of type. Smythson created the puzzle’s cover based on its iconic Nile Blue Panama diary, while Julia designed the grid, creating patterns inspired by the likes of the Memphis Group, the Bauhaus, Frank Lloyd Wright and Oscar Niemeyer.\n\nJulia\n\nWe have a longstanding relationship with Julia, founded in London in 2008 by Valerio Di Lucente, Erwan Lhuissier and Hugo Timm. The studio brings together graphic and spatial design, collaborating with clients from both the cultural and commercial sectors on a broad range of projects, including typefaces, books, magazines, exhibitions, posters, websites and identities. www.julia.uk.com\n\nSmythson\n\nEstablished in 1887, Smythson is a leading maker of British luxury leather goods. In 1908, Frank Smythson invented the world’s first practical, portable diary, known for its cross-grain leather and featherweight paper; the brand is now internationally renowned for its timeless style, and each piece bears Smythson’s trademark exquisite craftsmanship. www.smythson.com\n\n'Honeycomb’ shades/dividers\n\nRich Brilliant Willing\n\nInspired by the transformative qualities of light, New York lighting specialist Rich Brilliant Willing has created a series of sculptural dividers to help set the right mood on any table. The pieces, which are made from perforated, powder-coated metal panels in honey-toned hues, can be shaped around a candle, or other source, so that light playfully peeks through.
