        "text": "Michael Colby: Other Lives: The Story Songs of Michael Colby (Jay Records), a cycle of story songs by lyricist Michael Colby (Charlotte Sweet, Ludlow Ladd), with music by a variety of composers, including Alex Rybeck, Larry Hochman, Joseph Thalken and Steven Silverstein, produc ed by John Yap. The CD features Musical Director Michael Lavine accompanying veterans Janet Aldrich, Bethe Austin, Ari Axelrod, Klea Blackhurst, Stephen Bogardus, Le Donna Burns, David Edwards, Sarah Rice, Luke Nephat, Jane Seaman, Dan Hoy, Sean McDermott, Megan Styrna, Marianne Tatum, Maureen Taylor, Deborah Jean Templin, Deborah Tranelli, Joshua Turchin, Stuart Zagnit and newcomers Lauren Baker, Talia Cutulle, and Heeya Kim.\n\nTerry Gibbs: The Terry Gibbs Songbook (Whaling City Sound) celebrates the career of vibraphonist-composer Gibbs, who at age 99 has had a career of over eight decades, The CD features 15 original songs, including “Let’s Go To Rio” and “I Was Loved.” Additionally, the collaboration between Gibbs and songwriter Bobby Troup appears in “Those Eyes, Those Lips, That Nose, That Face, That Girl.” Soprano sax player and singer Danny Bacher provides the vocals on the album. Among the musicians on the CD are Scott Hamilton, Harry Allen and Tom Ranier, among others. With a discography of 80 albums, Gibbs’ also penned the book, Good Vibes: A Life in Jazz, which received the 37th Annual ASCAP Deems Taylor Award in 2004. A few years later, he was r inducted into the ASCAP Wall of Fame.\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK original Broadway cast recording (Wine & Peaches) features the show’s complete score, comprising 90 minutes of music, including orchestral interludes. The music and lyrics by Tony, Emmy and Grammy Award winners and Academy Award nominees John Kander & Fred Ebb, with additional lyrics by Pulitzer, Tony, Emmy and Grammy Award winner and Academy Award nominee Lin-Manuel Miranda. Like the show, the album will be a love letter to New York City, with music ranging from Afro-Cuban rhythms and traditional Big Band, to classic Broadway showstoppers.\n\nTatiana Eva Marie: Two at the Most (Turtle Bay Records) is a collection of romantic songs from the Great American Songbook presented in an intimate duo setting. This is the singer’s seve nth CD as a leader. She was named “one of the best young singers around” by the Wall Street Journal and was nicknamed the Gypsy-jazz Warbler by the New York Times, with music inspired by her French and Balkan heritage and a love for the Parisian art scene era spanning the 1920s to the 60s. Pianist Jeremy Corren joins the chanteuse on features such as “The End of a Love Affair,” “Penthouse Serenade,” “Sophisticated Lady,” “You Go to My Head” and more. Between them, Tatiana Eva-Marie and Corren create a retro feel that would not be out of place in a 1940s nightclub. They play together regularly, and their empathy and mutual respect is palpable."
