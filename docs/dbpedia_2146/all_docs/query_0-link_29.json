        "text": "You know someone is special when you've known them forever and still find yourself listening with rapt attention anytime they talk. Aman Narang is one of those people. I loved listening to him take a turn in the hot seat with Harry Stebbings talking about founding Toast, what he screwed up, and occasionally admitting the things he got right. He's so talented and driven but has zero ego and is radically honest and self-aware...a key reason he's been on one of the most effective people I've ever known. What a treat - enjoy! https://lnkd.in/ew_RP-9Q\n\nEvery year we at Bessemer Venture Partners spend WAY TOO MUCH TIME staring at our collective belly button asking ourselves one question: What's going on with The Cloud? The answer this year, detailed in our State of the Cloud report may disturb you...it's dead! But don't fret. A new AI Cloud has risen up that has us more excited than ever about the decade ahead for The Cloud. Most exciting: reality so far is outpacing the insane hype. Read on for the Top Five trends we're tracking most closely: https://lnkd.in/eB6N9dds\n\nAs we polled our 60 investors for the 2023 \"State of the Cloud\" we were shocked at the level of optimism we heard despite recent gloomy headlines...kudos to AI for yanking us into the Cloud Multiverse. With Talia Goldberg, Michael Droesch, Janelle Teng, Ariel Sterman, and Caty Rea - and a special shout-out to our fearless content leader Christine Deakers! https://lnkd.in/eTASQ2TT\n\n“Don’t let perfection get in the way of progress.” This is just one of the many incredible insights my friend from business school shared with me on this episode of Wish I Knew. The incomparable Carolyn Childers, CEO & Co-founder of Chief—cut her professional teeth at the best-of-the-best companies, between investment banking and big businesses. But when faced with the challenge of straying from a traditional corporate path to start her own company, founding her business—Chief—became her biggest move yet. Don’t miss this episode where we share how a Fortune 500 exec ignited her own startup. https://lnkd.in/eav-Mx6X\n\nCongrats to Danielle Cohen-Shohet and the GlossGenius team on an awesome financing and welcome to our new partners Imaginary. GG's customer obsession gave rise to an incredible product that makes life easier for thousands of beauty and wellness professionals. Finally the software in this industry can be beautiful too!\n\nIncredible outcome for an amazing team. Congratulating Haroon Mokhtarzada, Idris Mokhtarzada, Yahya Mokhtarzada and the rest of the world-class TrueBill team on a well deserved exit. I only wish I had more time to spend learning from them how killer consumer products are built. Looking forward to watching their continued growth as they improve the financial health of millions of consumers in the years ahead.\n\nCongratulations to Steve Fredette, Aman Narang, Jonathan Grimm, Chris Comparato and the rest of the incredible Toast team on their IPO. From the moment the founders crashed in the empty office next to mine I knew they were different. They didn't care what VCs thought (which at the time was not much about restaurant software!), they just wanted to build something that mattered - and wow could they build things fast. In the years since we led their first institutional round in 2015 it has been a joy to see their obsession with product and customer success fuel expansion into tableside payments, online ordering, payroll, lending, and essentially every aspect of restaurant life. I feel so lucky they let me tag along for the ride. Thank you Toast! bvp.com/toast bvp.com/memos/toast"
