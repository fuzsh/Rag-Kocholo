Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to his decades-long career as a jazz musician, Tony Bennett was also an artist.\n\nBennett studied music and painting at the New York High School of Industrial Arts. At 16, he dropped out of school and took a job as a waiter to help support his family.\n\nHe painted portraits of other jazz legends like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, as well as landscapes and urban scenes.\n\n\"I've always done the two things that I love to do, which is sing and paint, and it's wonderful being honored about it,\" he told Reuters at an exhibit of his work in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe signed his paintings, which have been exhibited around the world, with his birth name, Anthony Benedetto.\n\nThe United Nations commissioned paintings from Bennett in honor of its 50th anniversary in 1995. In 2000, he hosted an exhibit entitled \"What My Heart Sees\" at the Catto Gallery in London.\n\nThree of his paintings are part of the Smithsonian's permanent collection.\n\nHis painting of Ella Fitzgerald is part of the National Museum of American History's collection. The Smithsonian American Art Museum exhibits his landscape of Central Park, and his portrait of Duke Ellington is available to view at the National Portrait Gallery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBennett described himself as \"a perpetual student of learning how to paint\" in a 2009 interview with Smithsonian magazine.\n\nEven as his music career took off with hits such as \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco,\" Bennett said he would alternate between singing and painting, picking one back up when he needed a break from the other.\n\n\"It would be a big lift,\" he told Smithsonian magazine. \"It created a state of perpetual creativity. There is no need for vacation or to retire.\"\n\nRead next\n\nArt Celebrities\n\nAdvertisement"
