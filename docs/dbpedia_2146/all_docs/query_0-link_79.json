In 2011, she appeared as Australian singer Cody Simpson's love interest in the music video of the song \"On My Mind\" as part of her early work and several years later, in 2016, she had role in a second music video, \"Love To Love You Baby\" by French model and singer Baptiste Giabiconi, a cover of the homonymous song by Donna Summer released in 1975.\n\nOn October 25, 2015, Baldwin worked as a TV host at the 2015 MTV Europe Music Awards in Milan, Italy, revealing by the side of Italian supermodel Bianca Balti and English rapper Tinie Tempah the winner of the Best Music Video Award, won by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis for the video of their song \"Downtown\".\n\nOn June 19, 2016, she co-hosted with model Gigi Hadid announcing a live exhibition by Shawn Mendes at the 2016 iHeartRadio Much Music Video Awards in Toronto, Canada.\n\nStarting May 2, 2017, she began hosting a new TBS show Drop the Mic with rapper Method Man, which features 4 celebrities facing off in a series of rap-battles.\n\nIn 2017, Baldwin featured on the cover of Spanish Harper's Bazaar alongside male model Jon Kortajarena and the American, British and Japanese editions of Elle.\n\nOn November 23, 2018, it was confirmed that Baldwin was married to Canadian singer-songwriter Justin Bieber.

Bennett plays 'Hunter,' a pregnant, young housewife, whose seemingly perfect existence takes an alarming turn when she begins compulsively and uncontrollably eating dangerous objects. The film made its world premiere at the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival, garnering massive critical acclaim, including Bennett's award for Best Actress.

Her father was African-American and her mother is of mostly English and German descent. Halle first came into the spotlight at seventeen years when she won the Miss Teen All-American Pageant, representing the state of Ohio in 1985 and, a year later in 1986, when she was the first runner-up in the Miss U.S.A. Pageant. After participating in the pageant, Halle became a model. It eventually led to her first weekly TV series, 1989's Living Dolls (1989), where she soon gained a reputation for her on-set tenacity, preferring to \"live\" her roles and remaining in character even when the cameras stopped rolling. It paid off though when she reportedly refused to bathe for several days before starting work on her role as a crack addict in Spike Lee's Jungle Fever (1991) because the role provided her big screen breakthrough. The following year, she was cast as Eddie Murphy's love interest in Boomerang (1992), one of the few times that Murphy was evenly matched on screen. In 1994, Berry gained a youthful following for her performance as sexy secretary \"Sharon Stone\" in Flintstones: Die Familie Feuerstein (1994). She next had a highly publicized starring role with Jessica Lange in the adoption drama Die andere Mutter (1995). Though the movie received mixed reviews, Berry didn't let that slow her down, and continued down her path to super-stardom.\n\nIn 1998, she received critical success when she starred as a street smart young woman who takes up with a struggling politician in Warren Beatty's Bulworth (1998). The following year, she won even greater acclaim for her role as actress Dorothy Dandridge in made-for-cable's Die Geschichte der Dorothy Dandridge (1999), for which she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a TV Movie/Mini-Series. In 2000, she received box office success in X-Men (2000) in which she played \"Storm\", a mutant who has the ability to control the weather. In 2001, she starred in the thriller Passwort: Swordfish (2001), and became the first African-American to win Best Actress at the Academy Awards, for her role as a grieving mother in the drama Monster's Ball (2001).\n\nBorn Hayley Catherine Rose Vivien Mills in London in 1946, she is the daughter of the great actor Sir John Mills and the well-known novelist-playwright Mary Hayley Bell. Her sister is the actress Juliet Mills. She grew up in her parents' home, an outgoing, funny child, and, because she spent so much time with her parents and their friends, very intelligent. When she went to boarding school at age nine, however, she became very shy around kids her own age. She found solace in theater productions at her school. She was noticed playing at her parent's home in 1958 by director J. Lee Thompson, who immediately cast her opposite her father in the thriller Tiger Bay - ich kenne den Mörder (1959). Her debut performance turned heads around the world, from Germany, where she won an award at the Berlin Film Festival, to Hollywood, when Walt Disney came knocking at her door. He signed her to a five-year contract. For her first film for the studio, Alle lieben Pollyanna (1960), she won critical raves, box-office success, and a special Juvenile Academy Award. Her second Disney film, Die Vermählung ihrer Eltern geben bekannt (1961), in which she played twins, was even more popular. She continued to appear in routine Disney films like Die Abenteuer des Kapitän Grant (1962) and Summer Magic (1963), as well as films outside the studio like ...woher der Wind weht (1961), based on her mother's novel, and Das Haus im Kreidegarten (1964), again co-starring with her father. Though Disney gave her a somewhat more adult role in the mystery film Der Millionenraub (1964), she had begun to tire of her sunny, innocent Pollyanna image. After completing Alles für die Katz (1965), she left the studio for good. Alles für die Katz (1965) was still a success, as was her first post-Disney film, Columbia's Immer Ärger mit den Engeln (1966). Then, she shocked her fans by appearing in the comedy Honigmond '67 (1966) with her father. There was an even bigger surprise in store when she fell in love with the film's director, Roy Boulting, who was 33 years her senior. She lived with Boulting for five years after he divorced his wife. They married in 1971 and had a son, Crispian Mills, in 1973. By this time, he'd taken control of her career, and, as a result, she made many bad film choices that left critics and audiences cold. By 1975, her film career had pretty much tanked. She separated from Boulting that year and moved in with actor Leigh Lawson, with whom she had a son, Jason, in 1976. They split up in 1984. She appeared in three TV-movie sequels to Die Vermählung ihrer Eltern geben bekannt (1961) in the 1980s, and also appeared in the BBC miniseries Im Land des Feuerbaums (1981) and the TV series Good Morning, Miss Bliss (1987), later re-titled California High School - Pausenstreß und erste Liebe (1989). She hasn't done much film work in several years, preferring to concentrate on her burgeoning career in theater. Her greatest success in theater, so far, has been the role of Anna in \"The King and I\", which she has played in many touring stage productions throughout the 1990s.\n\nHaley Joel Osment is an American actor who has proven himself as one of the best young actors of his generation. He is the first millennial male to have received an Academy Award nomination for acting.\n\nOsment was born in Los Angeles, California, to Theresa (Seifert), a teacher, and actor Eugene Osment. His sister is actress Emily Osment. His ancestry includes Irish, along with German and English/Scottish. Haley began acting at the age of four, when he tried out for a Pizza Hut commercial in a shopping mall. The commercial launched his career, and he landed his first television role later that year. As a young child, his first film role was as Forrest Gump (1994)'s son, also named Forrest Gump, in the 1994 film of the same name as well as making a small appearance in Lifesavers - Die Lebensretter (1994). He had roles in numerous TV series, including Thunder Alley (1994), The Jeff Foxworthy Show (1995), and, most notably, the final season of Murphy Brown (1988), in which he replaced Dyllan Christopher as Murphy's son Avery. Osment also made numerous guest appearances in various TV series, including Die Larry Sanders Show (1992), Walker, Texas Ranger (1993) (as a child dying from AIDS), Ein Hauch von Himmel (1994), Chicago Hope: Endstation Hoffnung (1994), Pretender (1996), and as a child dying from leukemia in the emotional episode 'Angels and Blimps' (1999) of the series Ally McBeal (1997). Osment starred in Bogus (1996) with Whoopi Goldberg and Gérard Depardieu, and appeared in the 1998 made-for-TV movie Das Grauen am See (1998) with Yasmine Bleeth, as well as I'll Remember April (1999) with future The Sixth Sense - Nicht jede Gabe ist ein Segen (1999) co-star Trevor Morgan.\n\nHe first achieved stardom in 1999 when he appeared in the blockbuster The Sixth Sense - Nicht jede Gabe ist ein Segen (1999), co-starring Bruce Willis. For this role, Osment won the Saturn Award for best young actor. He was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Michael Caine, with whom he would later star in Löwen aus zweiter Hand (2003). Osment (voice) also made three minor guest appearances on Family Guy (1999) in 2000. One of Osment's lines in The Sixth Sense - Nicht jede Gabe ist ein Segen (1999), \"I see dead people,\" is often repeated or parodied on television programs and in other media. The 2000 Academy Awards ceremony honored another of Osment's future co-stars, BestActor Kevin Spacey, who, along with Helen Hunt, appeared in Osment's next film, Das Glücksprinzip (2000). The following year, Osment appeared in Steven Spielberg's A.I.: Künstliche Intelligenz (2001), cementing his stature as one of the leading young actors in Hollywood. This role earned him his second Saturn Award. Also in 2001, Osment starred in a Polish film, Edges of the Lord (2001), as Romek. The movie was never released theatrically in the United States. Osment has since provided voices for Die Country Bears - Hier tobt der Bär (2002) and Das Dschungelbuch 2 (2003). More recently, Osment was the voice of Sora, the main protagonist of the Walt Disney Company and Square-Enix's Kingdom Hearts (2002) video-game series, which was extremely financially successful as well and generally well-received critically. He was also the voice of Takeshi Jinno in the \"Time to Shine\" episode of the IGPX: Immortal Grand Prix (2005) anime TV series.\n\nOsment also worked in Home of the Giants (2007), playing a high school journalist opposite Ryan Merriman and Danielle Panabaker. He also played Helmuth Hübener in the film Truth & Treason (????). On July 20, 2006, Osment was injured in a one-car accident. His blood-alcohol content was measured at 0.16%, twice the legal limit in California. On August 18, he was charged with four misdemeanors, including driving under the influence of alcohol and possession of marijuana while driving. He pleaded no contest on October 19 and was sentenced to three years' probation, 60 hours in an alcohol-rehabilitation and education program, a fine of $1,500, and a minimum requirement of 26 Alcoholics Anonymous meetings over a six-month period.\n\nIn 2006, Osment took a hiatus from Hollywood and studied acting at the Experimental Theatre Wing at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, graduating with Honors and a Bachelor's Degree of Fine Arts in 2011. He also appeared on Broadway in a 2008 production of David Mamet's American Buffalo, and in John Logan's Red at the Philadelphia Theater Company in 2011.\n\nOsment returned to the screen in 2012 with I'll Follow You Down (2013), co-starring with Gillian Anderson, Rufus Sewell, and Victor Garber, Sassy Pants (2012) with Anna Gunn and Diedrich Bader, then appeared in two seasons of Amazon Studios' comedy series Alpha House (2013), written by Pulitzer Prize winner Garry Trudeau and starring John Goodman. His many additional credits include Comedy Bang! Bang!, Kevin Smith's horror comedies Tusk (2014) and Yoga Hosers (2016), Entourage (2015) (Warner Bros.' silver screen extension of the award-winning HBO dramedy), the award-winning independent comedy The Sex Teacher (2014), the hit FX series What We Do in the Shadows (2019), the Hulu science fiction comedy Future Man (2017), and the true crime thriller and 2019 Sundance Film Festival Selection Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile (2019) starring Zac Efron as Ted Bundy, and featuring Lily Collins, Kaya Scodelario, Jim Parsons, and John Malkovich.\n\nHaley Ramm has been making a name for herself over the past decade working alongside Hollywood veterans such as Jodie Foster, Sean Penn, Hope Davis, Jason Bateman and Peter Sarsgaard. Her innocent beauty coupled with her gritty roles in film and television have made her a standout among young Hollywood. Haley most recently starred in Hulu's thriller Light As A Feather and is well known from her starring role in the Freeform drama Chasing Life. She can next be seen starring opposite Keke Palmer in the Showtime film PIMP from Executive Producer Lee Daniels.\n\nAt age three Haley Ramm, a Dallas native, started dancing in local studios. Her love of dancing on stage led to enrollment in acting classes and, at the recommendation of a teacher, her parents began looking for an agent. Almost immediately she signed an agency contract. After a few years of booking independent shorts and a slew of Hasbro commercials, Haley and her family ( with the help of her Dallas agent) discussed giving Los Angeles a shot.\n\nUpon making the move from Texas, she began booking roles and capturing audiences in co-star / guest-star roles and blockbuster films. After finding a manager in L.A., she booked small guest roles on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000) and Yes, Dear (2000). Those television roles were followed by two national commercials. Then she booked what was to be her feature film debut in Rumor Has It... (2005). The Rob Reiner-directed film went through script rewrites and her role as \"the young Jennifer Aniston\" was cut to merely still shots. Soon after came Flightplan (2005). Just a few short months after completing \"Flightplan\" she booked the role of Kelly Beardsley, Dennis Quaid's daughter, in the comedy Deine, meine & unsere (2005). It was another great opportunity to work with phenomenal actors. Dennis, Rene Russo and Jerry O'Connell proved to be great role models with strong work ethics. Soon after came Into The Wild (2007), X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), Skateland (2010), Red State (2011) and Disconnect (2012).
