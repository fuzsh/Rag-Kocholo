        "text": "It’s been awhile since I shared a round-up of books on my radar. Below, sharing my dream summer reading list, hopelessly ambitious as it might be.\n\nFOR A DARK THRILL RIDE // What Lies Between Us by John Marrs. This is all you need to know: “Every other night, Maggie and Nina have dinner together. When they are finished, Nina helps Maggie back to her room in the attic, and into the heavy chain that keeps her there.” Um, what?\n\nFOR POETIC CRAFTSMANSHIP IN A FAMILY-FOCUSED NOVEL // The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett — A lot of buzz about this book, which traces the stories of a family across multiple generations, interrogating “the lasting influence of the past as it shapes a person’s decisions, desires, and expectations.” Most intriguing to me? Reviewers have likened Bennett’s voice to Toni Morrison. Must read.\n\nFOR A TOTAL BRAIN VACATION // The Heir Affair by Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan, which comes out in early July. I absolutely loved the pre-cursor to this book — it actually made my list of the absolute best beach reads — and you know I love all things royal.\n\nFOR ELEGANT PROSE // The Night Watchman by Louise Erdrich. Ann Patchett described it pithily as follows: “The night watchman is trying to save Native lands while a young woman is trying to save her sister. Gorgeous, brilliant, important — everything you could want in a novel.” OK, Ann! I’m in.\n\nFOR NON-FICTION THAT READS LIKE LYRICAL FICTION // The Warmth of Other Suns by Isabel Wilkerson — Currently reading this non-fiction account of the Great Migration of Black Americans from the South in the early twentieth century. It reads like lyrical fiction: compelling, poetic, highly attuned to the personal. I have underlined countless sentences in this book out of the sheer rhythmic joy of reading them, and, of course, there is a lot to chew on content-wise.\n\nFOR A JUICY MEMOIR SET AMONG THE FASHION ELITE // The Chiffon Trenches: A Memoir by Andre Leon Talley. A love a juicy memoir, and here is one from a fashion industry veteran who is both a fashion icon in his own right and a conduit to the hush-hush of the fashion elite. I think I will listen to this on audiobook — I love hearing memoirs read by the authors themselves.\n\nFOR A NOVEL THAT BLURS THE LINE BETWEEN FACT AND FICTION // Rodham by Curtis Sittenfeld. This book seems to be enjoying a polarized reception — some absolutely love it and others hate it passionately — and for that reason, I’m desperate to check it out. I love a good book controversy. As its name suggests, the book is a fictional account of Hillary Clinton’s life. Sittenfeld pulled off a similar undertaking in American Wife, a fictionalization of Laura Bush’s life that I enjoyed a few years ago, although I did wonder how she managed to write damning bits of it without some sort of lawsuit filed against her…\n\nFOR INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM IN SILICON VALLEY (I.E., IF YOU LIKED BAD BLOOD) // Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber by Mike Isaac. A close-up look at the rise of Uber, the outsized personality of its storied founder, Travis Kalanick, and a sweeping (incriminating) interrogation of the venture capital world in the early oughts and beyond.\n\nLooking for something else? Consider my summer reading list from last year (loved so many of the books on this list) or check out my list of 10 books that will change your life.\n\nAnd in case you’d prefer to shop from BookShop, a digital boutique that enables you to purchase from small book sellers across the country, I have listed all of these selections and a couple of other picks here.\n\nWhat other must-reads are on your list for summer 2020?!\n\nPost Scripts.\n\n+A clip-on book light if your significant other goes to sleep earlier than you do.\n\n+I was surprised to see that Crate and Barrel discontinued the beloved leaning bookshelves we have flanking our media console in the living room — what a shame! I always get so many compliments on them, and they almost look like they could be built-in. They now have a similar though more modern style available here. LOVE these for apartments because they don’t block out as much light and give the impression of something custom-built. (Look for less with these.)\n\n+These edgy but polished bracelets are SO chic! They have that kind of Carter clou bracelet vibe — fierce but sophisticated? Love.\n\n+Chic Matisse-inspired cocktail napkins.\n\n+More finds to elevate your next at-home happy hour.\n\n+I bought these plastic cups in college and still use them constantly. Perfect for the beach / backyard, dishwasher-safe, and punchy.\n\n+Beautiful bread boards / pizza peels using reclaimed wood.\n\n+All of Serena and Lily’s lighting is on sale! I have always been drawn to their woven pendants, but also love this textured table lamp and these epic coral sconces. Wow!\n\n+Mentioned this Friday, but Minnidip was recently restocked at Target and there are still some available. I ended up ordering this watermelon style, although I still die over this pink confection. Boys can wear pink, too (duh), but I have to be honest and say that Hill has a lot of girly things in his life…trying to balance it out.\n\n+More amazing summer finds.\n\n+This statement mini is UNBELIEVABLE. The sleeves! The pleating! The Monet-esque pattern. Wow wow wow.\n\n+This boat-print HVN dress is so fun. This label does such a good job with their prints and cuts — walking the narrow walkway of “retro chic” without ever looking dated or fuddy-duddy. Obsessed! Also — I feel like Charlotte York in this label.\n\n+These strawberry print jams are so cute! Mr. Magpie and I are planning to take the children to a berry picking farm (pretty much the best excursion for social distancing!) and Hill will of course have to wear his strawberry jon jon. Currently eyeing either this Proper Peony or this LaCoqueta for mini.\n\n+I, of course, will be wearing my strawberry earrings (marked down to $60!). And how good are these lemon earrings?!\n\n+Speaking of fruit: this citrus-print dress (on sale) is magic. Also love this grapefruit-print one by the same label.\n\n+Hard to think about wearing boots right now, but this is such a good bargain for the quality."
