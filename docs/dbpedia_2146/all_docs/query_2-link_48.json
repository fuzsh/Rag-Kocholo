        "text": "A graduate of Lesley University, Jessica has a Master’s degree in Expressive Arts Therapy with a specialization in Mental Health Counseling. “I found a lot of healing through the arts and music growing up and wanted to be able to help people find creative ways to cope with life’s challenges and express themselves,” she explains. “I enjoy working with a variety of patients and helping them overcome their challenges.”\n\nJessica says she is a strength-based and person-centered clinician. “I use person-first language and do not refer to people as their diagnosis. Many people describe me as a compassionate, non-judgmental person who is not afraid to advocate for their patients. I also encourage my patients to become advocates for themselves.\n\nJessica performed her graduate clinical training in a Dissociative Disorder and Trauma inpatient unit where she discovered her passion for working with people who have a history of trauma and need a high level of care. “After I graduated with my Masters, I worked primarily in a partial hospitalization program with adolescents and adults and enjoyed facilitating group therapy, helping people cope when in a crisis, and find concrete coping skills to use in their everyday lives.”\n\nIn her work Jessica enjoys engaging with people, carefully listening to what they are going through, and helping them find resources that they may never have heard about before. “I enjoy empowering people by educating them so that they know how to help themselves and also navigate to their resources in the community. It’s a passion of mine, and why I am grateful to be an Integrated Clinician at Reliant. I enjoy being an LGBTQIA+ affirming and non-judgmental clinician to various cultures of individuals and families.”\n\nIn her spare time, Jessica loves art and being creative. “Right now, my projects consist of working with resin to capture memories using photos and words that I want to capture and protect. I also enjoy playing with my two cats.”"
