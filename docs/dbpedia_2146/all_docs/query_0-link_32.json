Nebo Chicken Fry (Yell County)\n\nSlovak Oyster Supper (Arkansas County)\n\nSoup Sunday (Pulaski County)\n\nCrissy’s Pub Style (Saline County)\n\nTusk & Trotter American Brasserie (Benton County)\n\nLoca Luna and Red Door (Pulaski County)\n\nWoods Place (Ouachita County)\n\nDoe’s Eat Place (Pulaski County)\n\nBig Banjo Pizza Parlor (Jefferson County)\n\nThe Faded Rose (Pulaski County)\n\nCharlotte’s Eats and Sweets (Lonoke County)\n\nHerman’s Ribhouse (Washington County)\n\nDaisy Queen (Searcy County)\n\nThe Dixie Pig (Mississippi County)\n\nRay’s (Drew County)\n\nOld South Restaurant (Pope County)\n\nDairyette (Montgomery County)\n\nHugo’s (Washington County)\n\nTaliano’s Italian Restaurant (Sebastian County)\n\nBrave New Restaurant (Pulaski County)\n\nK Hall & Sons (Pulaski County)\n\nAward finalists were announced at an event Monday (May 13) hosted by the Division of Arkansas Heritage. Ryall was accompanied by Shea Lewis, secretary for the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism, and members of the Arkansas Food Hall of Fame Committee.\n\n“Food is such a defining feature of Arkansas, having the potential to tell stories with just one bite,” Lewis said. “Our finalists are perfect examples of this, and we’re honored to recognize their impact on the state’s dynamic food culture.”\n\nHonorees will be inducted into the Arkansas Hall of Fame during a special event in September 2024.
