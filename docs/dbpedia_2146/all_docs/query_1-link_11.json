        "text": "Whether you are a festival girl or nostalgic for the 1990s, you'll find your swimwear match among these 18 brands brightening up the swimwear scene this season all while contributing to a more committed fashion inspired by travel, vintage and the frenzy of festivals.\n\nWhat swimwear brands should you know before summer? Swimwear, the first essential to slip into your suitcase for a trip to the water's edge, can be imagined according to the season's desires and trends. The proof is in these 18 pretty brands where you can treat yourself to the swimwear nugget of summer 2023 without further delay.\n\n18 swimwear brands to buy for summer\n\nThe committed one: Talia Collins\n\nTalia Collins, an ex Vogue Paris stylist launched her eponymous brand with the goal of helping to protect the ocean with her line of on-trend, personalizable swimwear. Launched in August 2018, the label has been supporting the Healthy Seas association since its inception, while offering the ultimate swimwear essentials.\n\nWhy we love it: For its timeless, monochrome one-pieces with built-in SPF 50 UV filters.\n\nShop the Talia Collins swimsuits here.\n\nThe wild one: Hunza G\n\nOriginally baptized Hunza, this ready-to-wear label began life under the direction of Peter Meadows. Today, the label is known as Hunza G, and is headed up by Georgiana Huddart. The London-based brand has an impressive claim to fame - it was behind one of the dresses worn by Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman.\n\nWhy we love it: For its straightforward cuts and pop colors, perfect for copying the looks of Gilda Ambrosio and Giorgia Tordini.\n\nShop The Attico swimwear here.\n\nThe Parisian one: Yasmine Eslami\n\nWith minimalist cuts and delicate printed fabrics, Yasmine Eslami's swimwear offer is timeless. Mixing inspirations from the South of France with a fiercely Parisian spirit, her swimsuits are both chic and sexy. It's hardly surprising that they have become a go-to for Parisiennes on vacation.\n\nWhy we love it: For its classic, impeccable cuts, which can be worn summer after summer.\n\nShop Yasmine Elsami swimwear here.\n\nThe graphic one: Louisa Ballou\n\nFreshly graduated from the prestigious London school Central Saint Martins, Louisa Ballou quickly made print and color mix and match her visual signatures, combining a wide and infinitely varied color palette with graphic and sometimes even reversible cut-outs.\n\nWhy we love it? For its quality designs, made using responsible supplies, and plastic free packaging.\n\nShop Akoia Swim swimwear here.\n\nThe retro one: Fisch Swim\n\nPropelled to the forefront of the fashion scene in the summer of 2019, worn by top model Elsa Hosk, Fisch Swim has won over a whole host of It girls. Its secret? Its pieces designed in Saint Barthélemy and made in Italy.\n\nWhy we love it: For its green but still very fashionable swimwear, made from recycled fishing nets.\n\nShop Fisch Swim swimwear here.\n\nThe most cutting edge one: Isa Boulder\n\nIn addition to being one of the hottest swimwear labels of the moment, Isa Boulder is committed to making its pieces locally in Bali, from recycled premium fabrics. Led by two friends, Cecilia Basari and Yuli Suri, the brand delivers an almost experimental interpretation of the swimsuit.\n\nWhy we love it: For its highly Instagrammable bikinis with graphic drapes and retro cuts.\n\nShop Isa Boulder swimwear here.\n\nThe most elegant: Dolla\n\nDolla is the contraction of Dolores and Carla, the names of a grandmother and her granddaughter who share the same passion for fashion. For her brand, Carla was inspired by her grandmother's elegance while imagining a retro swimwear wardrobe respectful of the environment, a tribute to the Mediterranean.\n\nWhy we love it: For its simple but effective swimwear where each swimsuit is adorned with a removable palladium and gold-plated chain, inspired by one of the swimsuits seen in a portrait of Dolores.\n\nShop Dolla swimwear here.\n\nThe most sophisticated: Calarena\n\nHeading to the Corsica, where Marie-Luce and Sandrine have been imagining, since 2004, a beautiful summer wardrobe, a tribute to the charm of the Mediterranean. Made in their family workshops in Italy, Calarena swimwear brilliantly combines timelessness and suggested sexiness.\n\nWhy do we love it? For its well-cut swimwear pieces, often enhanced with jewel details and its Mare line, in collaboration with the creators of the Isula brand, or to treat yourself to a sun oil, created with Made in Maquis Nucca, to prolong the summer.\n\nShop Calarena swimwear here.\n\nThe retro one: Ephemera\n\nDesigning swimwear silhouettes with retro charm, Ephemera swimsuits are made to last much longer than one summer. Launched in 2012 by Nicole Banning, this label fuses pure Australian aesthetics and French elegance.\n\nWhy we love it: For its swimsuits, sometimes color-block, sometimes vintage-looking, and always sexy, made in Italian lycra.\n\nShope Ephemera swimwear here.\n\nThe graphic one: Medina Swimwear\n\nFaced with a polluting fashion industry, Lourdes Medina is committed to a more responsible creation with her eponymous label. The costumes are made totally from Econyl, and part of the profits are donated to organizations working to protect the oceans."
