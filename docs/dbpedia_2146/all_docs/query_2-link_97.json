        "text": "Deep down in my heart of hearts, I know that skirts and dresses look better on me than pants do. Still, as someone who stands tall at 5'1\", that hasn’t stopped me from looking for the best trousers for petite women out there. My one requirement: they should fit off the rack.\n\nYou could say I’ve been looking for these “holy grail” pants for years. Earlier this fall I thought I found my sartorial white whale in the form of High Sports’ beloved cropped kick flare, but since they aren’t quite as cropped as I’d like, it makes shoe pairings trickier than expected. I’ve been defaulting to jeans lately, cuffing up hems and letting the frays drag, but felt my rebellious flame reignited after ordering a pair of flowy, Loulou Studio wide-leg trousers back in February, which I so desperately wanted to fit but really couldn’t make work without a trip to the tailor. It was a sad walk to the UPS store to drop off my return.\n\nResolute on my quest, I spent the last few weeks trying out a number of styles in various fits and fabrics to find work-appropriate pairs that walk the line between cool and edgy and polished and timeless. (Also, they had to all be flats-friendly.) My thoughts on each style below, but a few takeaways first that I hope might resonate with you:\n\nA 27” inseam is the Goldilocks number for a full-length; anything shorter can be considered cropped on my frame, anything slightly longer puddles—that’s not necessarily a bad thing, it just depends if you’re precious about letting your hems sweep ground. (Experts have previously shared that the ideal pant inseam for petites is between 25 and 31” depending on the shoe you’re wearing.)\n\nDon’t sleep on the petites section anymore—the fits are remarkably good these days!\n\nShopping online? If the model is wearing something “cropped,” rest assured it’s a full-length IRL.\n\nPerhaps a note-to-self in disguise, but try not to get too attached to a certain brand. I tend to shop specific labels out of preference and loyalty, sometimes forgetting there’s more to explore—this was a nice exercise in expanding my own shopping habits.\n\nFind the eight pairs that made the cut—all figuratively, of course—below.\n\nMaria McManus\n\nhigh-waist wool crop pants\n\n$690\n\nNORDSTROM\n\n$690\n\nBERGDORF GOODMAN\n\n$690\n\nMARIA MCMANUS\n\nMaria McManus High-Waist Wool Crop Pants\n\nIt was love at first try with these kick flare pants from Maria McManus. A contemporary classic with lots of styling mileage, they’re crafted out of a luxe stretch-wool and have a 25.5” inseam that allows for an ankle reveal that’s the stuff of petite dreams. Bare skin in a ballet flat! Flaunt a fancy sock! If you want a trouser that means business, your search ends here.\n\nCos\n\ntailored wool pants\n\n$150\n\nCOS\n\nCos Tailored Wool Pants\n\nThe widest leg trouser I have quite possibly ever worn this convincingly, I was on the fence about how this Cos pair would initially fit. Too roomy legs don’t do much for me, but the fitted waist actually balances out the volume. There’s definitely some dragging at the bottom, but it works if you’re intentional about. My Adidas SL72 sneakers keep it relaxed; a heel would put it into dressy territory, which goes against the commuter-friendly vibe I was trying to channel. I’m wearing a regular size 2; I would have opted for the 2P had it been available—I think the length would be ever so slightly better as the inseam here is 28.34”.\n\nVince\n\nhigh-waist wool crop pants\n\n$244\n\nNORDSTROM\n\n$325\n\nVINCE\n\n$244\n\nSAKS FIFTH AVENUE\n\nVince High-Waist Crop Pants\n\nBoth Vogue.com editor Chloe Malle and senior market editor Madeline Fass recommended I try Vince for my story—and I get why. The brand nails the minimal but comfy vibe and these pull-on pants are the kind you reach for when your mind is doing that “I have nothing to wear” thing.\n\nFitted but relaxed around the knees and thighs, they hit right below the ankle bone but don’t puddle thanks to the 27” inseam. I paired them with mesh flats from The Row here to show the taper, but they’re very versatile—I’ve worn them both with sneakers and pointy heeled boots. The waist is true to size; I’m wearing an XS. (For some other silhouettes, like the High Waist Bias Pant, which I really liked but definitely needs tailoring, I’d recommend sizing down.)\n\nToteme\n\nfluid drawstring trousers\n\n$390\n\nTOTEME\n\n$390\n\nNET-A-PORTER\n\n$390\n\nMYTHERESA\n\nToteme Fluid Drawstring Trousers\n\nAs much as I love Toteme trousers and want them all to work for me, so few actually do! These linen pants however are fantastic. I’m wearing them here again with my mesh flats to illustrate length, but since the hem is just a tiny bit too long, I’d most likely style them with a little heeled sandal since they could benefit from the extra height. (The product descriptions don’t list any inseam, but based off the other pairs I’ve tried, I’d say these are around a 28”.) The waist is true to size; I’m in a DK32.\n\nAritzia\n\nEffortless pants\n\n$148\n\nARITZIA\n\nAritzia Effortless Pants\n\nAritzia’s pant selection is vast, and I was curious to see how the petite style would fare against the regular, having tried neither before. The difference is minimal, but I’d recommend the “short” option, which is tailored to people in the 5’0”-5’2” range and has a more desirable 30” inseam when you’re going for a certain amount of ankle slouch; the standard is 31.5”. I’m wearing a size 0, which is true to size compared to the fit guide (though some reviewers say it runs slightly smaller).\n\nDôen\n\nLavon pants\n\n$298\n\nDOEN\n\nDôen Lavon Pants\n\nPale yellow with a delicate lace trim, these pull-on pants are quite possibly my favorite style of all. I love them with a sneaker and button-up to showcase a more playful side of my personality, but can easily see myself wearing them with a cute cardigan and Mary Janes, or a T-shirt and heeled sandals. It looks like a vacation-only kind of pant, but it’s actually quite versatile. And while it might not be work appropriate for all offices, it feels perfectly right for a Summer Friday at Vogue HQ. The 27” inseam is again a winner.\n\nLeset Kyoto Carpenter Pants\n\nLeset\n\nKyoto carpenter pants\n\n$280\n\nLESET\n\nThe spring runways blessed us with an abundance of utilitarian-chic cargo pants, but how to wear them when pocket placements can throw off the proportions entirely? Leset’s are technically a “cropped” pant with a 24.5” inseam (unlike the Yoko Cargo Pant, which goes down to the model’s ankle with a drawstring tie and also has patch pockets) so the length works here. They’re made of a crisp cotton that’s great for warm weather, and thanks to the longer topstitched utility panels, you get the illusion of length. I’m wearing a size S here; an XS would fit better but I can get behind the slightly oversized look. I see these styled on the weekend with a fitted tank and leather thong sandals.\n\nTibi\n\nchino Sid pants\n\n$425\n\nTIBI\n\nTibi Chino Sid Pants\n\nThe horseshoe silhouette isn’t one I gravitate to for perhaps obvious reasons, but these from Tibi made me have a change of heart. They come in a petite size run, which certainly helps, with vertical seams down the side in lieu of pleats. I sized up here for a more relaxed fit, but could have actually stuck to my regular 24 and still kept the roomy silhouette. The inseam to bring it home? A 27” inch, naturally."
