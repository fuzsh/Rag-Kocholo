        "text": "Happy Friday Friends!\n\nToday we’re excited to share Talia & Bennett’s wedding from last August with you. Their wedding is just the sort we love to be a part of: great couple, fab venue, and tons of personal details!\n\nThese lovebirds got hitched at the Adamson House in Malibu. Not only does the venue have an incredible view, the house and grounds of the estate are equally gorgeous. With a backdrop as stunning at the Adamson House (which is a historic estate, you should go visit!), we didn’t have to go over board with décor to make everything look lovely. Thankfully, Kim Fox Photography was there to capture each and every detail beautifully.\n\nWe chose to replicate the feel of the coast in our aesthetics, from the custom designed printed items (compliment of a friend of the couple) to bringing the colors of sand, water, and driftwood into our table-scape! We introduced this look to the dining tables by using matte tan lines as our base and adding satin aquamarine runners to frame the table. Then we placed a chocolate napkin atop white china plates to bring the look together. Talia wanted the floral designs to have a wildflower, fresh picked from the field, feeling to them. We used a variety of vibrant colored flowers, small to mid sized blooms and textured greenery to bring this vision to life. A mixture of white washed pails and almost milk-glass style vessels were used to display our “hand-picked” arrangements. Finally, Talia added touches of red to her personal style to keep things spicy (check out her shoes, super foxy!)\n\nOne of the aspects of this wedding that I appreciated the most was just how invested Talia & Bennett were in making the day truly reflect their story, style, and personality. They weren’t afraid to get their hands dirty and took on many a DIY project…my kind of couple! They got engaged in Italy, and brought back with them some crazy good olive oil; so it was only fitting that they divvy it up into small bottles, tether a cute tag around them, and make them their favors. Bennett has been known to brew a keg or two in his day, for the wedding, he doctored up a specialty “I Do Brew”. It was served with the weddings featured beer. On every guest’s plate was a small box of caramels made by Talia and Bennett’s friend and amazing pastry chief, Justin Chao of Le Bon Garcon (his caramels made Oprah’s favorite things list a few years ago!).\n\nWhen it came time for the ceremony, family members were super involved, which made the whole thing feel deeply intimate and personal. The couple got married under a chuppah built by Bennett and his new father-in-law; the top of the chuppah was a piece of Talia’s mother’s wedding dress, and both sets of parent’s wedding anniversary dates-as well as the wedding couple’s anniversary- were embroidered onto it. We hung wildflower arrangements in mason jars from the large tree that anchored their ceremony. Bennett’s aunt, a professional French horn player, played the music that accompanied the bride and groom down the aisle. Talia’s grandmother also officiated the ceremony. The Ketubah, a reminder to the couple of their vows to each other, was signed by Talia & Bennett’s 5 siblings and siblings-in-law.\n\nOnce our lovebirds were officially hitched, the whole party feasted like kings via a family style dinner by Whoa Nelly Catering. Just thinking about the food on their wedding day still makes my mouth water. Talia & Bennett didn’t feel tied to many reception traditions, so we threw out the old rulebook and just focused on everyone dancing and having a great time. Bennett’s been a member of a few bands throughout his life, so it was an extra special treat for the wedding quests when he, with two of the bands he is a part of, were able to have a live jam session during the celebration. At the end of the night, the happy couple hopped on the last shuttle with their friends and family (and the left over alcohol) to get the after-party going. It was definitely a night to remember for all!\n\nAfter the wedding, I asked Talia if she had any advise for those in the midst of planning their weddings, and here is what she had to say: “Treat the entire planning process as a celebration. Whether you’re a natural planner or not, celebrate each decision; it takes away some of the pressure from having to get just one day totally perfect, and by the time the wedding is here you feel like you’ve been celebrating for a year already—a truly great feeling. (And if you have Marisa by your side, you really can feel like you’re celebrating all year long!).”\n\nVendor Love"
