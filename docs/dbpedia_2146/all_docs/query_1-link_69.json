        "text": "Learner Tien won his first round match today at the ATP Challenger 75 in Lexington, beating Rio Noguchi of Japan 6-4, 6-1, and shortly thereafter withdrew from the USTA National Championships in Kalamazoo. As the defending champion coming into last year's tournament, Tien was the top seed, and he would have been again this year, with his ATP ranking of 242 the best of any player competing in Kalamazoo this century.\n\nWithout Tien, the top seed goes to 2023 finalist Trevor Svajda, the only other player in the draw who has won an ITF Pro Circuit title. 2022 16s champion Darwin Blanch, a $15K finalist two weeks ago in Tunisia, is the No. 2 seed, followed by Roland Garros boys champion Kaylan Bigun. Jagger Leach, who was projected as a top eight seed, withdrew today with an elbow injury.\n\nThe 18s top 16 seeds:\n\nThe US Open qualifying acceptances were revealed today, with 219 the ranking cutoff for both men and women. Eleven US men are currently on the list, including Mackenzie McDonald, who is the first player on the alternate list and will get in with any withdrawal between now and the start of the qualifying tournament. There are 15 US women on this initial acceptance list, with Louisa Chirico, at 219, the last direct qualifying entry.\n\nOnce Kalamazoo begins on Friday, I won't have much time to track the three USTA Pro Circuit tournaments this week, including the ATP Challenger in Lexington, the women's W75 in Lexington and the men's $25,000 tournament in Edwardsville Illinois.\n\nAlthough they have been dealing with rain and heat delays this week, the qualifying was completed on time today in Edwardsville, with six of the qualifiers Americans: Braden Shick(NC State), Aadarsh Tripathi(UCLA), Michael Zheng(Columbia), William Mroz(Illinois), Nicolas Kotzen(Columbia) and Gavin Young(Michigan).\n\nWild cards were awarded to Oliver Okonkwo(Illinois), Kyle Kang(Stanford), Adam Neff[8](UNC, SMU) and Preston Stearns(Ohio State). The top seed is Andres Martin(Georgia Tech), with Colin Sinclair(Cornell) of the Northern Mariana Islands the No. 2 seed. Only two main draw matches were played today, with No. 4 seed Will Grant(Florida) and Kenta Miyoshi(Illinois) of Japan advancing to the second round.\n\nAt the W75 tournament in Lexington, four of the eight qualifiers are Americans: Katrina Scott, Whitney Osuigwe, Jessica Failla(USC, Pepperdine) and Lea Ma(Georgia).\n\nJust two wild cards were awarded to Fiona Crawley(North Carolina) and Elizabeth Stevens(Kentucky), with Robin Anderson(UCLA) getting a special exempt spot after reaching the finals of the W50 in Dallas. Stevens lost to top seed Lily Miyazaki(Oklahoma) of Great Britain 6-3, 6-1 this evening. In another first round match today, recent Michigan graduate Kari Miller, using one of her ITA/ITF Accelerator entries, defeated No. 3 seed and WTA 166 Talia Gibson of Australia 7-6(2), 6-0 for her first main draw USTA Pro Circuit victory since 2022. Rebecca Marino of Canada is the No. 2 seed this week in Lexington.\n\nAt the WTA 500 in Washington DC, 18-year-old wild card Clervie Ngounoue played 2022 NCAA singles champion Peyton Stearns in the first round, with the former Texas Longhorn earning a hard-fought 6-3, 7-6(3) victory."
