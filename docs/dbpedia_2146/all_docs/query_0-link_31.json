        "text": "Naples 15's Caffé & Pizza Sospeso\n\n“Suspended” Coffee & Pizza:\n\nIn Naples once upon a time there was a beautiful habit. When a person was happy for some reason and wanted a coffee, instead of paying for one they paid for two. One they drank and the other was reserved for someone worse off who couldn’t afford it. In other words this was a coffee offered to humanity.\n\nHere at Naples 15 we would like to take the initiative of the caffe sospeso and offer the Pizza Margherita suspended.\n\nOur customers may participate by paying only half price for the second (suspended) pizza as a donation. You can enable those whom are less fortunate to eat a hot meal. This can also be done traditionally with a coffee. As a Neopolitan I grew up with this tradition and I believe it makes the heart feel better when you can do something for someone you don’t know and receive nothing in return.\n\nIf you are in need, please come in and ask our wait staff if there are any suspended pizzas available.\n\nLearn more about this popular Neopolitan tradition. Or please read this excellent book written by acclaimed author and philosopher, Luciano De Crescenzo called; IL Caffe Sospeso.\n\nLearn more about Ischia, Chef Salvatore Di Scala’s hometown!\n\nIschia and Pocida: The Italian Islands that leave Capri in the Shade\n\nWe are proud to share where our high quality Italian products come from. Check out Lioni Foods and Gerardo Di Nola here\n\nUPDATE: We’ve been getting a lot of awesome press (Internationally!) for running this great program. Visit the links below and take a look at what the rest of the world thinks. Grazie!"
