        "text": "This week, Olivia Wei and I planned and hosted the first ever #MacysStyleCrew Influencer Dinner for 16 of our Style Crew Influencers celebrating the launch of the program this season. During dinner, Sara A Holmgren interviewed Maria Menounos, who gave inspiring advice on how to overcome obstacles in life and follow your passions and curiosity. Sara also interviewed Paige DeSorbo and Hannah Berner of the ‚ÄúGiggly Squad‚Äù podcast and Bravo‚Äôs ‚ÄúSummer House;‚Äù both gave great advice on how to think about the negativity that comes with being in the public eye and being your true self to your audience. Before leaving, the influencers got fun goodie bags with some items from several of our vendors! Thanks to our agency partners, event planner, and the rest of our internal teams for making this event and the program possible! You know who you are and we couldn‚Äôt do it without you! And of course, thanks to our amazing creators who we had the pleasure to meet and get to know - all kind and wonderful people that we‚Äôre lucky to have as Style Crew members!
