Houston handles day-to-day operations, scheduling of practices and workouts, fundraising, budgeting, team travel, campus relations, alumni relations, the annual golf tournament, the Mike Jacobs Football Camps each summer, and other duties as assigned by the head coach and football staff.\n\nHouston came to Mercer after spending three years at Gardner-Webb University, serving as director of football operations and coaching the team’s wide receivers. Houston joined the Runnin’ Bulldogs after serving two seasons as a graduate assistant at North Greenville University on the Division II level. In addition to his work with the Gardner-Webb receiving corps, Houston handled the day-to-day logistics, fundraising, alumni relations, budgets, recruiting, and other duties as assigned in his role as director of football operations. In 2019, Houston was part of a Gardner-Webb staff that signed a top 50 recruiting class for the first time in school history.\n\nIn 2019, he led a young receiving core that ranked atop of the Big South conference. Sophomore Izaiah Gathings and freshman Devron Harper earned First Team All-Big South honors with Gathings leading the conference with 71 catches, 1,046 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns. As a freshman, Harper had 51 receptions for 653 yards and 4 touchdowns. He averaged 12.3 yards per catch and was named a Freshman All American and Freshman All-Conference player.\n\nGathings was named Stats FCS National Player of the Week Honorable Mention twice that season and set a Big South record after posting 10-plus catches and 100-plus receiving yards in four consecutive weeks. Harper finished second in conference play after catching 51 passes for 653 yards and four touchdowns. Harper garnered Big South Conference Freshman of the Week honors twice and was named the FCS Freshman of the Week once. His 90-yard reception against Hampton set a record for the longest reception by a freshman in Big South Conference history.\n\nHe saw receiver Kyle Horton earn All-Big South honors in 2018 after leading the Runnin’ Bulldogs in catches, yards and touchdowns. Horton also earned All-Big South accolades as a kickoff return specialist, in addition to his spot on offense.\n\nDuring his two seasons as a graduate assistant with the Crusaders, Houston worked with the defensive backs, a position he also worked with for three seasons as a student assistant coach.\n\nHouston also worked with the Crusaders’ linebackers prior to his involvement with the secondary. In 2016, Houston was part of a North Greenville staff that directed the Crusaders to an outstanding campaign. NGU finished with a sparkling 9-5 record overall – including a 5-1 mark at home. That lone loss came in a competitive game against eventual SoCon champion and NCAA Division I FCS playoff participant The Citadel in early October. The Crusaders picked off 17 passes on the season, with 10 different players getting into the act. North Greenville also broke up 58 passes, helping limit opponents to a 125.10 pass efficiency rating. North Greenville advanced to the NCAA Division II Playoffs before falling to North Alabama in the second round.\n\nNorth Greenville intercepted 14 passes as a team in 2015, with 35 break ups – holding opponents to a 109.40 pass efficiency rating. That effort helped the Crusaders to a solid 7-3 mark, which included a 4-0 record at home. Houston was on staff as an undergraduate assistant in 2014, helping North Greenville to a 7-5 record and a win in the 2014 NCCAA Victory Bowl over Shorter. The Crusaders’ defense picked off 18 passes, limited opponents to a cold 102.60 pass efficiency rating and returned two interceptions for touchdowns.\n\nHe was a student on head coach Carroll McCray’s staff as a sophomore in 2012, working with a secondary that intercepted 12 passes – and helping a staff mold the Crusaders past a tough start to win five times in the final six games.\n\nHouston’s freshman season at North Greenville was a magical one, as he was part of Jamey Chadwell's staff that led the Crusaders to an 11-3 mark and a trip the NCAA Division II quarterfinals. That included two-straight wins over nationally-ranked teams in November before a narrow, 28-23, loss at 8th-ranked Delta State to close the season.\n\nNorth Greenville won nine consecutive games before its loss to the Statesmen, including wins over traditional South Atlantic Conference contenders Lenoir-Rhyne, Carson-Newman and Catawba. The Crusaders then whipped No. 19 Mars Hill, 58-32, in the Division II playoffs. North Greenville’s defense was particularly disruptive, recording 75 tackles for loss, 21 sacks and 24 interceptions on the season.\n\nHouston, a native of Easley, South Carolina, graduated from North Greenville in 2015 with a degree in sports management – with a focus on coaching. He completed his master’s degree in December 2016 at North Greenville, graduating with a degree in business administration (MBA). He and his wife, Laney Houston, reside in Macon, Georgia.\n\nCollegiate Coaching Timeline\n\n2020-Pres. – Mercer University\n\nDirector of Football Operations\n\n2017-2019 – Gardner-Webb University\n\nDirector of Football Operations / Wide Receivers\n\n2015-2017 – North Greenville University\n\nGraduate Assistant / Defensive Backs / Operations\n\n2011-2015 – North Greenville University\n\nStudent Assistant / Linebackers / Safeties / Operations"
