        "text": "Hi, friends! April really got away from me ‚Äî I posted here way less than I like to, which was a bit disappointing on a personal note. But when I looked back at why, I realized it was because April was so full of wonderful things. My family had a big Easter celebration with our first pool day of the season, and then celebrated my niece‚Äôs third birthday the following weekend. Two weekends ago I went to Toledo, Ohio, to visit some friends I hadn‚Äôt seen in ages (two of them I hadn‚Äôt seen in over two years!). And last weekend, my husband and I went to the North Georgia Mountains for a family reunion ‚Äî last time we saw them was in January 2020, before we hit quarantine. And in the midst of all of that, I still managed to squeeze in 14 books, which is an all-time record for me, and received my second COVID vaccine ‚Äî as of today, I‚Äôm fully inoculated, which is a great feeling. So while I took a break from blogging, I had so many wonderful things to fill my time with üôÇ\n\nHere are the books I got to read this month. There were some great ones, good ones, and also my least favorite read of this year (and maybe ever!). In order, I read:\n\nThe Babysitter by Liza Rodman and Jennifer Jordan. Thank you to Atria and Mystery Book Club (courtesy of Jordy‚Äôs Book Club and Boston Book Fanatic on IG) for the free finished copy and the chance to participate in MBC. This is a thrilling, slow burn memoir about a woman who discovers later in life that her kind childhood babysitter was one of the most prolific serial killers of the 60s.\n\nBoy Erased by Garrard Conley. I got to read this memoir with one of my book clubs. It tells the heartbreaking story of Conley being outed to his family and his time at a church-sponsored conversion therapy program.\n\nShadow and Bone by Leigh Bardugo. I read this one through the recommendation of one of my closest friends, Lauren, in anticipation of the upcoming Netflix series based on the series! I absolutely loved the book, and ‚Äî no surprise ‚Äî think it‚Äôs better than the show!\n\nThe Last Exiles by Ann Shin. Thank you to NetGalley and Park Row Books for the free eARC in exchange for an honest review. This was a heartbreaking tale of a young couple living in North Korea who become separated and go against all odds to be reunited. It‚Äôs a sad tale but still full of a sense of hope that really resonated with me. Full review to come.\n\nAnna K Away by Jenny Lee. Thanks to NetGalley and Flatiron Books for providing a free eARC ‚Äî as you may know, Anna K was one of my favorite novels of 2020, so I couldn‚Äôt wait to get my hands on this book. This one sucked me in just as much, and while I thought it lacked some of the charm of the first book, it still was a great read that really explored how teenagers deal with grief and heartbreak.\n\nWe Are Watching Eliza Bright by A. E. Osworth. Thank you to Grand Central Pub and Novel Suspects for the free ARC in exchange for an honest review. I posted my full review of this one on its pub day, which you can view here. But this was a hell of a debut that covered misogyny and gender violence in the gaming industry, based on the real-life Gamergate. I highly recommend to those who love suspenseful novels and interesting and unreliable narrators.\n\nThe Legend of Korra: Turf Wars by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. This was my first ever comic series that I read! I adore Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra, so no surprise I loved the follow up story.\n\nArsenic and Adobo by Mia P. Manansala. This was a fun, easy read that totally flipped how I view the genre ‚Äúcozy mystery,‚Äù bringing with it excellent representation and diversity, while still providing a more lighthearted take on the usual darker or gruesome mysteries/thrillers I tend to go for. I look forward to more in this collection! I‚Äôll be posting a full review soon.\n\nThe Beautiful Ones by Silvia Moreno-Garcia. Thank you to NetGalley and Tor Books for the free eARC ‚Äî I love SMG and honestly will read anything she writes. This one felt like I was reading a Jane Austen book, but with an added element of telekinesis and magic. I‚Äôll be writing a full review soon!\n\nThe Legend of Korra: Ruins of the Empire by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. After reading the first set, I couldn‚Äôt wait too long to read this one! The story was equally as great with gorgeous illustrations.\n\nLove in Color: Mythical Tales from Around the World, Retold by Bolu Babalola. I‚Äôm currently working on writing up this review, but it‚Äôs so hard because there‚Äôs SO many good things to say about it! Usually with a short story collection,, I struggle to connect with at least a few of the stories. All of these were great and stunningly beautiful.\n\nThe Maidens by Alex Michaelides. Thank you to Celadon (partner) for the free ARC in exchange for an honest review. I have lots of thoughts on this one, but I am truly struggling to organize them into something coherent! I read this book so quickly, but there are some parts that just felt‚Ä¶ off for me? Especially compared to his first one. At some point, I hope to get a review up when I can figure out my thoughts more.\n\nSuch a Fun Age by Kiley Reid. This was my first audiobook I checked out this year! I listened to it on my drive to and from Toledo and was so impressed. It‚Äôs definitely a character-focused book and I loved how nuanced each character was while addressing some difficult topics revolving around race, privilege, and more.\n\nThe Last Letter from Your Lover by Jojo Moyes. And this, sadly, ended my month on a low point. This is by far my least favorite book of the year, and maybe one of my least favorites ever. It just didn‚Äôt do it for me. It was for a book club, so it was good to discuss with friends, but this definitely won‚Äôt be one I‚Äôll recommend or revisit in the future.\n\nWhat books did you get to in April? Any standouts or ones that fell flat? Let me know in the comments or on IG!\n\nThanks for bearing with me, folx‚Ä¶ I am beyond behind on reviews here. I‚Äôve been overbooked (get it üòâ I‚Äôm all for a good pun!) with ARCs and just great backlog reads that I wanted to take time to do what I love most ‚Äî read. Now that I‚Äôve cleared up my schedule, I‚Äôm hoping to be more consistent with my blogging and catch up on writing reviews to highlight some really incredible books and authors.\n\nAs I‚Äôve mentioned before, I love a debut! I think reading and reviewing them is an honor. And when it comes to debuts I‚Äôve read in 2021, The Last Revival of Opal & Nev is definitely top of the list. Dawnie Walton is such a talent, and you better bet I‚Äôll be reading whatever she decides to publish from here on out. Like, she could publish her grocery list, and I‚Äôd be all about it!\n\nQuick synopsis: This story follows the infamous rock duo Opal and Nev, nobodies who rose to fame in NYC in the 70s. In 2016, journalist S. Sunny Shelton is curating a collection of interviews from and about them as they prepare for a reunion tour, but a new allegation threatens everything Opal, Nev, and now Sunny have worked for.\n\nNow I‚Äôm as big of a Daisy Jones and the Six fan as about anyone else, so I was at first a bit hesitant ‚Äî this book, while quite different, followed the same oral story format, which I thought may feel too similar to Daisy Jones. But I was definitely wrong ‚Äî in my opinion, this book shines so much brighter than Daisy Jones. I loved that coupled with the interviews are editor‚Äôs notes from the point of view of Sunny. These notes help develop Sunny as equally a main character, next to the titular Opal and Nev, and allowed the present day to become a story of its own, parallelling and moving on from that of Opal and Nev back in the 70s.\n\nOpal, however, was my favorite character. She was bold, imperfect, bright, and brave. I loved how she knows exactly who she is and never tries to be anything she isn‚Äôt. Most importantly, she unabashedly stands up for what she believes in.\n\nI don‚Äôt want to give away any spoilers, but what made this book so incredible and truly a step above Daisy Jones is how it shows the effects that white supremacy ‚Äî and taking a stand against it ‚Äî has on women of color, and especially Black women. It‚Äôs a powerful testament, both sobering yet full of hope. Especially in the context of 2016, when Sunny is performing these interviews and publishing this book. This book took turns I couldn‚Äôt have anticipated, and it both sucked me into this fictional story and reminded me of the lengths we still need to go for racial equality in our real-life society.\n\nHave you ever just wanted to love a book SO much, and no matter how much you try, it just doesn‚Äôt seem to work out? That‚Äôs how I felt about The Lost Apothecary, unfortunately. Billed by Book of the Month as a historical fantasy and touted by just about everyone else as the next big hit, I felt in my heart it was going to be one of my favorite reads of March, if not 2021! While there was still much to like about it, it fell ended up falling a bit flat for me.\n\nQuick synopsis: In 18th century London, a mysterious apothecary named Nella sells her goods to a specific clientele ‚Äî woman looking to escape oppressive lives at the men in their lives. When 12-year-old Eliza comes into her shop, an unspeakable accident will put everything Nella has worked for at risk. In modern-day London, Caroline goes on vacation alone to escape heartbreaking news about her marriage and discovers a token from the past that will force all three women‚Äôs lives to intersect.\n\nThere was much to like about this book ‚Äî I enjoyed the three main characters, but especially Nella and Eliza. I thought Penner‚Äôs character development with them was excellent as was the plotline, so much so that I sort of dreaded when I‚Äôd start a chapter based in modern-day London! Not that I didn‚Äôt like Caroline, but I do have a fascination with that time period and found Nella‚Äôs mission (and Eliza‚Äôs role in it) to help women admirable. It felt timely, important, and transcendent of time, which is clear in how that same oppression from men catches up with Caroline in modern time as she deals with marriage issues.\n\nOverall, however, I didn‚Äôt enjoy the writing style. I felt that it was a little too much telling versus showing, so I didn‚Äôt feel myself transported into this story the way I had hoped. There were also a couple of plot points that felt rushed (but I won‚Äôt mention because of spoilers). Additionally ‚Äî and this was probably my biggest issue ‚Äî I felt a sort of disconnect between how the past storyline and the present storyline were supported to relate. I think for me, I hoped for a much stronger connection to tie them all together. Individually, each story was good, but together, it felt too disparate and forced.\n\nBut most importantly, I really thought there‚Äôd be more fantasy involved since it was billed as a historical fantasy genre. Book of the Month has typically done a great job labeling their picks in my opinion, and based off past options that are in this genre, I was expecting more fantasy, such as Addie LaRue, The Library of Legends, Things in Jars, or Gods of Jade and Shadow. I didn‚Äôt think The Lost Apothecary had nearly as much fantasy ‚Äî perhaps just a touch of magical realism, but even for me, it felt a bit of a stretch.\n\nThat said, there are so many awesome reviewers out there that have rained praises upon this book! So while this book didn‚Äôt live up to its hype for me, I still think that many will love it and connect greatly with its story. For those who like historical fiction, female-powered books, or stories with parallel storylines, this would probably be an awesome fit. But if you, like me, were thinking this was going to have a lot of fantasy elements, this may fall flat based off the genre description alone.\n\nI‚Äôm a day late on my March wrap-up post AND it just snowed for the first time in a month ‚Äî so that‚Äôs the April Fools Day joke, right?? But living in the Midwest, you just have to accept that Fake Spring is a real thing and you‚Äôll inevitably get that last snow sometime in late March or even April. Hopefully it‚Äôs the last one of the season, however!\n\nOn a reading note, this month was a great month for me. Typically, I read around eight books, but this month I got through a whopping 11 books! There were many awesome reads, some of which I‚Äôve already reviewed, some of which are to come. I‚Äôve probably spent just a little too much time reading and not enough keeping up with reviews on here and Instagram. But I promise ‚Äî they‚Äôre coming soon!!\n\nHere are the books, in order, that I got the chance to read this month, plus a short summary. Also, check out my new Betta fish, Reggie! Sadly, Barry passed away (may he RIP) after nearly two years. But we‚Äôre excited to welcome Reggie to the family!\n\nWatch Her by Edwin Hill. This suspense/mystery features Hester Thursby, Harvard librarian and master finder/researcher. I loved the whodunnit aspect, the alternating POVs, but mostly, I loved Hester. Check out my full review here. You better be sure I‚Äôll be going back to read books 1 and 2 at some point! Also, thank you to Books Forward and Kensington Books for this free ARC in exchange for an honest review.\n\nThe Lost Apothecary by Sarah Penner. This book follows two parallel storylines, that of modern day Caroline, who is on vacation alone after a shocking revelation from her husband, and that of Nella, an apothecary who sells her concoctions to women in need of help against the oppressive men in their lives and whose run-in with young Eliza will forever change their lives. My full review will be coming soon.\n\nThe Northern Reach by W. S. Winslow. This is a slow-burn collection of interrelated stories about the residents of a coastal Maine town and how throughout the 20th century, they intersect, intermarry, and intermingle. With a dash of magical realism and truly atmospheric writing, this one is great for fans of historical fiction. Thank you to Flatiron Books for the free ARC in exchange for an honest review, which you can read here.\n\nThe Push by Ashley Audrain. Living up to all the hype, this suspense novel unpacks the darkest side of motherhood and was truly a profound read. I was often disturbed and unsettled, but as a reader, I appreciated the way this book made me think hard about motherhood and womanhood. Check out my full review here.\n\nAnatomy of a Scandal by Sarah Vaughan. This was a book club choice that I read with some college friend that was a thought-provoking dissection of how both media and the justice system often let those who commit heinous acts of sexual assault/rape get away and how victims are often to blame. This book is being turned into a Netflix series and I cannot wait.\n\nMy Year Abroad by Chang-rae Lee. So I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever spent this long on a book! Like no joke, I was reading it for about a month. It‚Äôs a slow, arduous read, but also beautifully written, telling the story of how Tiller, a young, not-so-ambitious American, is taken under the wing of Pong, an enigmatic and charismatic businessman, and the events of their year abroad. Thank you to NetGalley and Riverhead for this free eARC in exchange for an honest review.\n\nDial A for Aunties by Jesse Q. Sutanto. Definitely the stand-out novel of the month, this story ‚Äî part contemporary fiction and part romance ‚Äî follows Chinese-Indonesian Meddy, whose aunties must come to the rescue after a blind date gone horribly wrong. What follows is a hilarious, heartwarming tale of of five women trying to cover up an accidental murder, work the biggest wedding of their careers, and Meddy‚Äôs run-in with an old flame. What could possibly go wrong? Thank you to Berkley and NetGalley for the free eARC in exchange for an honest review.\n\nA Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J. Maas. This was a buddy read and a total ‚Äúbookstagram made me do it.‚Äù The first book of the series, this story follows Feyre, a young girl cursed to live among faeries as punishment for a crime. A mix of Beauty and the Beast, Hunger Games, Spinning Silver, and a whole bunch of other fun fantasy tropes, this book was a fun, sexy read. I‚Äôm excited for the next ones to come!\n\nThe Final Revival of Opal & Nev by Dawnie Walton. This Book of the Month selection and debut novel is an oral history of the famous (yet fictional) rock n‚Äô roll duo, Opal and Nev, who rise to fame in the 70‚Äôs. While it is a thrilling biography of sorts, it is also an indictment of consequences of protesting injustices has on women of color, especially Black women, versus men. Another stand out of the month.\n\nLast Night at the Telegraph Club by Malinda Lo. This book follows 17-year-old Lily Hu, growing up in San Francisco Chinatown in the 1950‚Äôs. She is struggling with her budding feelings for a female classmate, but throughout the story, must find the courage to be true to herself while falling in love for the first time. It‚Äôs a touching, heartbreaking, yet hopeful read.\n\nGet a Life, Chloe Brown by Talia Hibbert. This fun, super steamy romance follows Chloe Brown, who after a near-death experience, makes a list of things to do that will help her ‚Äúget a life‚Äù and step out of her comfort zone. Enter her superintendent, Red, who is the perfect person to help her cross off this list and perhaps fall in love with along the way.\n\nWhat was your favorite read of the month? Let me know below or send me a message on Instagram!\n\nJust like in January, I am so excited for the eight books I got to read this month. I tried to include books by Black writers to honor Black History Month, along with one eARC and even a Western ‚Äî a totally new genre to me! I also picked up a childhood classic, which was an awesome reminder that children‚Äôs books can be as thought-provoking, if not more so, than many adult books.\n\nHomegoing by Yaa Gyasi. What a great way to start off February, and as a buddy read with one of my favorite bookstagrammer friends. This story was incredibly told and so unique in its format, as it told the diverging stories of two half sisters unknown to each other on the Ghanaian Gold Coast. This short read still read like an epic and was full of incredible character development. You can check out my full review here.\n\nOutlawed by Anna North. This one was probably the most fun read of February and so different than anything I had ever read. I‚Äôm not too familiar with the Western genre, but I typically think ultra-masculine and white, so it was awesome to see that totally flipped on its head in terms of female, racial, and LGBTQ+ representation. It wasn‚Äôt my favorite read of the month (a solid three stars), but it was still a fun traipse into the Wild West. You can read my full review here.\n\nThe Echo Wife by Sarah Gailey. This is my first sci-fi of 2021, I believe, and I‚Äôm so glad I got a chance to check this one out early by receiving an eARC from NetGalley and TOR. The Echo Wife was my quickest read of the month ‚Äî I read it in only two sittings! I loved the domestic thriller vibes, and it really forced me to think about the ethical dilemma regarding the technology of cloning. My full review can be viewed here.\n\nThe Mothers by Brit Bennett. After reading The Vanishing Half (Bennett‚Äôs second novel) last year, I knew that I‚Äôd need to add her debut to my TBR. This book is so different than The Vanishing Half, but told with the same level of tenderness. The three main characters ‚Äî Aubrey, Nadia, and Luke ‚Äî really hold this story together. While each is imperfect and certainly makes mistakes, this story was full of compassion. I‚Äôll be posting my full review on my blog soon.\n\nThe Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. How did I go my entire childhood and adult life without reading this wonderful gem of a story?! Well, luckily my mother-in-law gifted me a beautiful pop-up version for my birthday. This is proof that children‚Äôs stories can be just as, if not more, full of meaning as any adult book out there. I highly recommend if you haven‚Äôt read it already!\n\nInfinite Country by Patricia Engel. Similarly to Homegoing, this amazing, lyrical, evocative story reads like a true, full-length epic, but manages to pack all that meaning and character development into less than 200 pages. This Own Voices story tells the tale of a family separated by their mixed-immigration status and the lengths they go to reunite. My full review can be read here.\n\nUncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man by Emmanuel Acho. If I could recommend a single book to someone looking to learn more about race in America, this would be it. Acho‚Äôs book reads as if you‚Äôre sitting down with him having a cup of coffee, while addressing all of the many questions regarding race and the Black experience you‚Äôve probably had. It felt so intimate and compassionate, which is so valuable when it comes to these tough conversations. Check out my review here.\n\nThe Removed by Brandon Hobson. In my goal to expand my reading experiences to include marginalized and underrepresented voices, I decided to pick up The Removed, a genre-bending novel about a Cherokee family reeling in the aftermath of Ray-Ray‚Äôs death by the hands of police. This was a touching and emotional story. While it wasn‚Äôt my favorite book of the month, I certainly enjoyed this new perspective and a different take on police brutality. I‚Äôll be posting a review for this one soon.\n\nWhat did you read this month, and which book was your favorite? Let me know in the comments below or reach out to me on Instagram!\n\nSo in case it isn‚Äôt evident already, I tend to be drawn toward books that are dark, intense, satirically funny, mysterious, or pretty much bound to make me an emotional wreck. But I try to pick a book outside of my norm at least once a month, whether that is through tone or topic. In January/early February, I decided to go with Outlawed, as I have never read a book with a Western setting before! This one was a short, fun trip outside my norm that provided a great escape into the wild West, full of adventure. Overall, this book had awesome feminist vibes and positive LGBTQIA+ representation, and I. Am. Here. For. It!!!\n\nQuick synopsis: In a town where barren women are thought to be witches and blamed for everything that goes wrong, Ada finds herself on the run as an outlaw when she fails to provide her husband with a child. A talented doctor, she joins up with the Hole in the Wall gang, a band of other outcasts led by the Kid, their enigmatic and charismatic leader.\n\nThis book was overall such a fun-filled ride. I loved Ada‚Äôs fighting spirit and appreciated how she had to really battle her own internal struggles of craving both motherhood and acceptance, but also recognizing and wanting to fight her society‚Äôs hatred toward barren women and groups experiencing ‚Äúotherness,‚Äù such POC, queer-identifying people, and more. While this setting ‚Äî ‚ÄúIn the year of our Lord, 1894‚Äù (pg. 1) ‚Äî seems so far from today‚Äôs time, it definitely helped me recognize the ways our society has advanced and become more accepting, but also the ways we‚Äôre often still stuck in the past when it comes to stigmas surrounding motherhood, sexual freedom, and queer identity especially.\n\nAdditionally, I loved the wide range of characters, such as the Kid, Lark, Cassie, Agnes, and many more. For a short book that was largely plot-driven and not as focused on character development, I still greatly enjoyed getting to know these characters, their personalities, their triumphs, and their struggles. I wish the book had perhaps dived a bit deeper into who each character is since I tend to gravitate toward character development over plot, but with Ada, Lark, and the Kid in particular, North did a great job building back stories for them that were both tragic yet uplifting and made me just want to totally cheer for them until the very end! It was also awesome to see such a diverse, inclusive cast in terms of sexual and gender identity and race. When I think ‚ÄúWestern,‚Äù I typically think White and ultra-masculine, so it was cool to see this genre totally flipped on its head in terms of inclusivity.\n\nWhile I probably won‚Äôt pick this book up again, I‚Äôll definitely recommend it to any readers looking for a flat-out fun, high-stakes adventure filled with friendship and the search for acceptance ‚Äî of others and of oneself. And I‚Äôll certainly be looking forward to seeing how it translates to the small screen with Amy Adams at the helm.\n\nLast year, I read Transcendent Kingdom, and it instantly became a favorite of 2020 due to its incredible character development and exploration of tough topics such as religion, racism, addiction, and mental health. So of course I went into Homegoing with HIGH expectations. Through powerful storytelling that discusses the collective power of memory and the meaning of home, I fell in love with this book even more than Transcendent Kingdom and think this one needs to be read by everyone ASAP! It was just that incredible, thought-provoking, heartbreaking, and so much more.\n\nQuick synopsis: Two half sisters in 18th century Ghana ‚Äî unknown to each other ‚Äî find themselves on two very different paths: one, the wife of a wealthy Englishman who lives in the Cape Coast Castle, the other imprisoned in the castle‚Äôs basement and destined for slavery in the U.S. The book proceeds to tell the parallel storylines of these two half sisters through multiple generations, across continents.\n\nThis book‚Äôs format is unlike any other I have read before. The first two chapters tell the stories of half sisters Effia and Esi, while chapter three focuses on Effia‚Äôs son Quey, and chapter four discusses Esi‚Äôs daughter Ness, chapter five is Quey‚Äôs son James, chapter six is Ness‚Äôs son Kojo, etc., etc. While each chapter reads like a standalone story, it is clear that they both build off of the previous generation‚Äôs experience, while paralleling with that of their generational counterpart over the course of eight total generations. This may be a tad confusing to explain and is a bit complicated to read at first, but Gyasi provides readers with a family tree at the start of the book ‚Äî I had this page dog-eared and flipped back pretty much every chapter to make sure I had my characters straight! It was a huge help. But this complicated, multigenerational story was so worth every word.\n\nWhat was most incredible about each chapter was how invested I became in the individual character. Each chapter was perhaps 20 or 25 pages in length, yet by the end of each one, it felt like I had known these characters as deeply as if I had read a full-length novel about them. Each chapter often takes place over a number of years and dives deeply into not only the character‚Äôs experiences but also their emotions, livelihoods, and innermost thoughts. Each character was so well-developed in such a short amount of space, that I wished I could have had an entire book on each of them! And over the course of these eight generations, I got to the end of this novel feeling as if I had read an entire epic ‚Äî yet over the course of only 300 pages. The character development and generational storylines felt as expansive as if had a bird‚Äôs eye view of this family tree, yet as intimate as if I knew each family member personally.\n\nMost importantly, I loved how the book addresses the role of shared, generational memory. As each half sister‚Äôs family line parallels the other‚Äôs, it is clear the role of generational memory. Each character carries the weight of the love, trauma, pain, hope, livelihood, and much more of the generation(s) before them. It is a heavy weight, sometimes a burden, other times a blessing. But it is a powerful idea, nonetheless, and an important one.\n\nAdditionally, I loved the exploration of what home means. As each generation either builds upon the parents‚Äô or grandparents‚Äô choices or decides to forge a new path for him or herself, home took on many meanings. It made me ponder ‚Äî is home a place? An idea? The people we call family? Or something greater or far more intangible?\n\nAs we begin this wonderful month of celebrating Black History Month, this book reminded me of the importance of reading own voices stories. I am so thankful for own voices writers like Gyasi who are willing to share stories like this one that can help us as readers continue to learn from and empathize with characters whose experiences are different then our own. Just another of the countless reasons I love fiction!\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt checked Homegoing out, I highly recommend it, as it is short, sure to get you thinking, and full of incredible character development and writing quality from Gyasi. If you have, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts! Comment below or reach out to me via Instagram.\n\nHappy Black History Month! While I think we as readers have a real responsibility to read stories by diverse voices all year long, I do think cultural celebratory months such as this are a wonderful opportunity to take a step back, reflect, educate ourselves, amplify diverse voices, and most importantly celebrate! To start off this incredible month of recognizing and celebrating Black history, I wanted to share a stack of some of my favorite books by Black writers that I have read or have on my TBR.\n\nFor me, I hope that this month is one where I not only reflect on all I‚Äôve learned and where I have room to grow when it comes to being a voice for racial inequality, but also to use my love of reading to joyfully celebrate and highlight Black voices, especially this month!\n\nSo here are some mini synopses of the books featured here that I have read, ranging from romance to fantasy, and memoir to coming of age.\n\nThe City We Became by N.

Comment below or message me on Instagram!\n\nFor my first-ever review on this blog, I wanted to highlight one of my top reads of 2020 ‚Äî The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue by V.E. Schwab. This one was all over bookstagram, so when it became available as Book of the Month‚Äôs October pick, I absolutely knew I had to grab it! Plus as a former English major, I love finding stories that take classic literary tropes ‚Äî in the case of Addie LaRue, a Faustian bargain ‚Äî and twist and mold them into something razor sharp and fresh. Schwab 100% accomplished that with her 442-page masterpiece, and what screams fall-ish, spookier vibes than a deal with the devil?! Plus, if it‚Äôs any testament to my love for this fantasy-driven, historical fiction-laced, and romance-tinged story, my rescue pup is named is even named Addie after the book!\n\nQuick synopsis: After Addie ignores the advice of a village elder ‚Äúto never pray to the gods that answer after dark,‚Äù she strikes a deal with a dark, alluring, yet dangerous stranger that forces her to walk invisible across time, history, and geography. Determined to make peace with what it means to be forever alone and forever forgotten, Addie finds adventure in the world around her for the next 300 years. All that changes, however, when she meets a stranger in a bookstore later who finally remembers her face.\n\nThe first thing that grabbed my attention as a reader, even in the slow burn of a start, was Schwab‚Äôs mastery of language. Her prose is gorgeous, perfectly balancing detailed character development and a winding, provocative plot, both of which sucked me in. I‚Äôm usually a fast reader, but this one had me slowing down in order to savor each sentence down to the letter. It had me deeply thinking about my own choices, regrets, would-be‚Äôs, and future opportunities.\n\nBut where this story really captured my heart was Addie herself. She is exactly the type of character whom, as a reader, I adore deeply. She is courageous, intelligent, independent, resourceful, and clever, yet so achingly human in all of her imperfections. Despite the limitations of her curse ‚Äî never being remembered by anyone ‚Äî she manages to live her immortality to the fullest, attempting to find adventure in each new day while still experiencing the hardships that all humans face: that is, heartbreak, pain (physical, psychological, and emotional), loss, fear, etc. Addie is the sort of character I wish I could be friends with in real life, which for me, is the true mark of an amazing, well-developed character. Her story is an incredible testament to the importance of living life to the fullest, loving deeply, and staying true to yourself.\n\nBut the most important facet of this story, for me at least, was its exploration of what makes up one‚Äôs identify. Is is a face, a name, an idea, or something else entirely? Addie‚Äôs experience of living forever, yet never being remembered, takes the idea of identity ‚Äî or lack thereof ‚Äî to a new level. And while I can almost assuredly say that none of us will experience anything exactly like it, don‚Äôt many of us at least understand her struggle to find herself?\n\nAs a 25-year-old woman, identity is one of those themes that is close to my heart. It feels like every action I take, every choice I pursue is in constant pursuit of finding my own identity. I related so much to Addie‚Äôs search for herself, even when it seemed nearly impossible. Her journey reminded me of the importance of living life fully, loving deeply, and staying true to yourself ‚Äî all ingredients that lead to recognizing and understanding one‚Äôs identity."
