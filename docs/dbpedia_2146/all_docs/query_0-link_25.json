She is the meetings and events coordinator for a company with a distributed workplace.\n\nHer colleagues are located across the United States. And her CEO and CHRO are working hard to bring everyone together for a company-wide conference. But Talia knows there is a high risk that the event could easily turn into a boring, muddled mess.\n\nGiven the company’s distributed workplace model, team members don’t necessarily know each other IRL, or know each other as well as they might have pre-pandemic. The stakes for her are high, and Talia feels like she needs to bring in someone from the outside, who actually knows what they are doing, to amp up the conference experience.\n\nSo, Talia asks David: Can a Comedian Save My Company’s Boring Conference?\n\nDuring this information packed episode, we revisit David’s answer to the question “what’s your work fit?’ His personal vision surely will resonate with many career professionals.\n\nAbout our guest:\n\nDavid Horning is stand-up comedian and founder of Water Cooler Comedy David Horning.

He’s working on a client service team at a co-located office located in a major city.\n\nBy all accounts, Bennett is doing well on the job. And his boss seems to enjoy working with him. But Bennett almost always takes on more tasks and responsibilities than he needs to, because it seems to please his boss. And it does. The boss wrote in his first review of Bennett: he has a lot of grit!\n\nBut Bennett’s behavior doesn’t make his team mates happy.\n\nThat cold splash of water to the face happened recently when one of Bennett’s co-workers called him out for taking care of others—most notably their boss—and not himself. And it’s true: Bennett seems to be working crazy long hours, not taking care of himself, and he is starting to dread the job and is thinking of finding a new one.\n\nSo, Bennett asks: how can I avoid being a people pleaser?\n\nDuring this information packed episode, Jahmaal also answers “what’s your work fit?’ His personal vision surely will resonate with many career professionals.\n\nAbout our guest:\n\nJahmaal Marshall is the founder of the Listen Then Speak, LLC consultancy and the executive producer and host of the Listen Then Speak Podcast.\n\nThis episode originated as a live show on August 16, 2023.
