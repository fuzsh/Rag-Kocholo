        "text": "“ Hello, my love. You should've warned your play date: I'm the only one who can bite you. „ ~ Talia to Bruce in Son of Batman.\n\n“ Talia: How is it I ever loved either of you?\n\nBruce: I don't think you ever did.\n\nTalia: Oh beloved, you have no idea. I have thought of little else for the last twelve years. But nothing, not my passion, not the death of my father, not even our child could bring you to my side. I know now I will never have you in this life... but perhaps in death! „ ~ Talia and Bruce's final conversation in Batman: Bad Blood.\n\nTalia al Ghul is a supporting character in the DC Animated Movie Universe. She is the leader of the League of Assassins.\n\nShe was voiced by Morena Baccarin, who also played Adria in Stargate SG1, Anna in 2009's TV remake V, Karen Walker in Spy, Cheetah in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Leslie Thompkins in Gotham.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBackstory[]\n\nOne night, years ago, Talia spent the night with Bruce Wayne and tricked him into being with her, which lead to her being pregnant with their son, Damian. Talia kept the child a secret from Batman and raised Damian in the ways of the League of Assassins. Talia also made a clone of Damian called Heretic, with the goal of creating a perfect soldier for the League of Assassins.\n\nSon of Batman[]\n\nWhen Damian was older, Talia, Damian, and Ra's were overseeing the training of the League until they were breached by a League of Assassins led by Ra's al Ghul's former henchman, Deathstroke. Talia led the defense of the League's base, then after the death of Ra's, brought her son to Batman for safety.\n\nBatman and Robin raid Deathstroke's lair, which is pumping gallons of Lazarus Pit liquid and manufacturing Man-Bat ninjas. Deathstroke shoots Talia, causing her death; while Robin pursues Deathstroke, Batman submerges Talia in a Lazarus Pit, and after a delay, she returns to life.\n\nDeathstroke was eventually defeated, and Talia departed to rebuild the League into something better than the terrorist group Deathstroke made it, leaving Damian with Batman, parting ways on friendly terms.\n\nBatman: Bad Blood[]\n\nHowever, after this, Talia has abandoned her morality and relinquished her compassion for both Damian and Bruce, seeing both primarily as tools to serve her purpose. While not mentioned, it seems plausible that the evil waters of the Lazarus Pit had gradually corrupted her. Talia plots to use Bruce to use the new communication software of Wayne Enterprise to brainwash the various political leaders of the world.\n\nShe recruits various villains to serve as her henchmen, including a dangerous bat-themed warrior called the Heretic, who turns out to be an artificially aged clone of Damian. Though, due to Heretic's emotional insecurities from lacking memories but wanting maternal affection, Talia executes him; Heretic's partner, Onyx, seems disturbed but remains silent. Talia discards Heretic since, thanks to Mad Hatter's technology, she successfully brainwashed Batman into obedience.\n\nA team of Batwoman, Robin, Nightwing, and Bat-Wing, as well as Alfred, infiltrates the floating structure that Talia hijacked. Batman's trance is broken and her efforts are ultimately thwarted by the \"Bat-Family\" and Talia is furious that she failed at both ambitions of controlling the world and having Bruce at her side, Talia retreats.\n\nShe proceeds to escape on her jet, but is confronted inside by Onyx and counterattacks, but their struggle causes the jet to crash (intentionally or otherwise) and leaving their fates unknown, although it is likely that Talia and Onyx perished in the explosion; even if Talia did survive, she either vanished underground or was killed during Darkseid's second invasion, thus the League of Shadows was leaderless until Damian took the mantle.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nOriginally, Talia was a loving woman who cared deeply for her father and son, wanting to protect Damian from Deathstroke and lamenting her father's' death. She also held strong feelings towards Batman, often acting seductively in their reunion and affectionately calling him \"beloved.\"\n\nAfter being revived by a Lazarus Pit and taking up leadership as head of the League of Shadows, she displays a complete change in her personality. She now acts more coldly, killing Heretic upon hearing his grievances, callously voicing pity in spite of resorting to murder. This extends even towards those she once loved, as she brainwashes Bruce without remorse, claiming to have cleansed him of all the pain he's endured.\n\nTalia also displays coldness towards her own son, calling him a \"bastard\" and ordering Bruce to kill him with the claim that they could always make more children. Although Talia claims that her actions were an act of love for Bruce and Damian, Damian speculates that it was all about control for her, and that any love she may have had was gone completely, while Bruce believes that she never loved either of them to begin with.\n\nOverall, Talia though one of the more honorable villains at first, became a monster over time, whose descent into evil could have been provoked by the Lazarus Pit's dark aftereffects, or maybe simply leading the League drove her into cruelty. It seems more likely to be the Pit, since everything she once believed becomes corrupted into a version that erases compassion and turns desire for love into obsession for control. Not only does she stop caring about Batman and Damian, but her heartless nature becomes apparent when she endangers various lives. This makes her the evilest version of Talia to date.\n\nGallery[]\n\nImages[]\n\nVideos[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIt is unknown what caused the drastic change in her personality, though it could be speculated that she forced the Mad Hatter to remove her emotions in an effort to become a better leader.\n\nAnother theory could be that exposure to the Lazarus Pits warped her mind, something that once happened to her father from bathing in the Lazarus Pit again and again. Considering the Lazarus Pits in the DCAMU were created by Trigon, whose essence is corruption, it is highly plausible that Talia was once the more morally grey individual who truly loved Bruce and their son, but the evil took root during her resurrection in the Pit, which ultimately twisted her into her worst self.\n\n[]\n\nTalia al Ghul on the Pure Evil Wiki\n\nNavigation[]\n\nAnimated Movie Universe Villains\n\nAnimated Features\n\nJustice League: The Flashpoint Paradox: Professor Zoom | Wonder Woman | Aquaman | Ocean Master | Black Manta | Deathstroke | Lex Luthor | Clayface | Rogues (Captain Cold, Captain Boomerang, Top, Heat Wave, & Mirror Master) | Joker | Yo-Yo\n\nJustice League: War: Darkseid | Desaad | Parademons | Ocean Master\n\nSon of Batman: Deathstroke | League of Assassins (Ra's al Ghul & Talia al Ghul) | Ubu | Killer Croc | Man-Bats\n\nJustice League: Throne of Atlantis: Ocean Master | Black Manta | The Trench | Lex Luthor\n\nBatman vs. Robin: Court of Owls (Samantha Vanaver, Talon, Owls Lieutenant, & Talon Warriors) | Dollmaker\n\nBatman: Bad Blood: League of Assassins (Talia al Ghul, The Heretic, Onyx, Firefly, Tusk, Mad Hatter, Electrocutioner, Hellhound, Calculator, & Killer Moth) | Black Mask\n\nJustice League vs. Teen Titans: Trigon | Legion of Doom (Lex Luthor, Cheetah, Solomon Grundy, Toymaster, & Weather Wizard) | Atomic Skull | Ra's al Ghul | Blackfire\n\nJustice League Dark: Destiny | Ritchie Simpson | Felix Faust | Demons Three\n\nTeen Titans: The Judas Contract: Church of Blood/H.I.V.E.
