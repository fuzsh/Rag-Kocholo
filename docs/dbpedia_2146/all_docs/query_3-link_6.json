        "text": "The first and last time a New Zealander won the Miss Universe crown was way back in 1983 when Lorraine Elizabeth Downes downed the competition in St. Louis, Missouri. That was almost three decades ago. Do you think itâ€™s time for another Kiwi to bring home the title to her country?\n\nGlobal Beauties has recently picked her as the Face of the Universe 2012. Could it be a sign of positive things to come her way, or work the other way around and make her miss the cut to the Top 16?\n\nIâ€™m still not 100% sold to Taliaâ€™s chances, but the preliminaries might tell another story and see her zooming to the top of the charts and join the staple favorites so far. Weâ€™ll seeâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰\n\nDrumming up attention for controversial Miss Universe New Zealand 2012 Avianca Bohm is effortless. You see, the 22 year-old fashion model joined the national pageant despite the fact that she is not a citizen of the country â€“ a South African in fact. There were rumors that one of the organizers allegedly allowed her to take part, thinking that she could never win the title. But she did. And now that the crown is on her head, she decided not to abdicate and instead, resorted to legal proceedings to help her keep the title. So hereâ€™s the thing. She will be greenlighted to participate in Miss Universe 2012 if she gets to be issued a New Zealand passport by August. Failure to do so will mean that the next in line, Talia Bennett, will take her place.\n\nSounds like a simple settlement, right? Well, unless a new development in this scenario transpires in the next month or so. If something like this happened in Binibining Pilipinasâ€¦â€¦oh, waitâ€¦.it already did. Venus Raj was threatened with dethronement just last 2010. In the end, the all-important passport saved the day. ðŸ˜‰"
