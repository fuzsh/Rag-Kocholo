(Sept. 26, 2023) – North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University has announced its newest cohort of Cheatham-White Scholarship recipients, representing some of the highest-achieving students among members of the class of 2027.\n\nThe 15 scholars hail from North Carolina, with the others from Georgia, Texas, Virginia, Michigan and New Jersey.\n\n“The Cheatham-White Scholars of 2027 bring not only their exceptional talents but also their commitment to positive change,” said Margaret I. Kanipes, Ph.D., N.C. A&T Honors College dean. “Their presence is a beacon of hope and promise, lighting the way for a brighter future in our academic community. We are delighted that they have chosen N.C. A&T as their home.”\n\nThe Cheatham-White Scholarship, established in 2018, is named for Henry P. Cheatham and George H.
