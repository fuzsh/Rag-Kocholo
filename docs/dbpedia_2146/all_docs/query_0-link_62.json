        "text": "Review: The Winter Queen, by Boris Akunin\n\nTranslated from the Russian by Andrew Bromfield\n\nRandom House, 2003. 242 pp. $13\n\nOne fine May afternoon in 1876, a young man of wealth and excellent prospects shoots himself in Moscow’s Alexander Gardens. At first, the police assume that his suicide is merely an instance of youth disaffected with life, resembling other, similar cases from recent months. Chalk the violence up to the nihilism of the young generation that doesn’t appreciate how wonderful Russian life is, and call the case closed.\n\nBut that theory, though conveniently self-congratulatory, fails to account for crucial circumstances. Why would a young man kill himself when, to all appearances, he had everything to live for? Why, at the time he shot himself, did another young man, an interested onlooker, run away? Why did the suicide’s revolver have only one bullet in the cylinder, which he spun before shooting himself? (That deadly game, by the way, bears the name “American roulette” in these pages.) Finally, who stood to benefit financially from the young man’s death?\n\nThe only copper to question these oddities is an oddity himself, nineteen-year-old Erast Fandorin. A former university student of well-to-do background left impoverished by his father’s inopportune death, Fandorin has chosen the police, of all careers for which his talents might have prepared him. Socially shy but physically courageous when the job demands, he speaks several languages, works diligently, is incorruptible, believes in justice, and lives according to the dictum that a gentleman keeps his word (perhaps because of the English nanny who had such an influence on him).\n\nOne may ask, as his superiors never do (though they privately wonder) why this boy is a cop. They might also wonder how he’ll survive. The answer? He’s lucky, not just astute. In a clever stroke that’s typical of the novel, Fandorin wears a corset out of vanity—and when the garment’s tough exterior saves his life, he’s grateful but embarrassed. That tells you what you need to know.\n\nFandorin reminds me of a somewhat more worldly version of Dostoyevsky’s Prince Myshkin in The Idiot. But The Winter Queen reads more like Tolstoy—a concise Tolstoy, to be sure—as with this description of the garden in the opening scene:\n\nThe public strolling the alleyways between blossoming lilac bushes and flower beds ablaze with the flaming scarlet blooms of tulips was smartly decked out: ladies holding aloft lacework parasols (to avert the threat of freckles), nannies minding children in neat little sailor suits, and young men affecting an air of boredom in fashionable cheviot frock coats or jackets cut in the short English fashion. With nothing apparently portending any disagreeable turn of events, a lazy satisfaction and gratifying tedium suffused the atmosphere, mingling with the scents of a mature and confident spring season.\n\nThe narrative seems Tolstoyan too, with gaming tables, beautiful women, break-ins, shootouts, enemies becoming sworn friends in a heartbeat, and marvelous coincidences all playing a part. This is decadent Russia as literature has portrayed it, and though some of it’s tongue in cheek and very funny, other parts are deadly serious.\n\nWhichever the case, little that happens fulfills expectations, at least not entirely. But despite enough misdirection to cause a continental traffic jam, the attentive reader will figure out who the real villains are before Fandorin does. In a book as brief and fast-moving as this, that doesn’t bother me. But the jacket blurb that calls Akunin the “Russian Ian Fleming” surely exaggerates.\n\nThe Winter Queen is more thriller than mystery, though what appears a simple crime of violence sets off the action. As the story progresses, Fandorin acquires state security clearance, so he’s no longer a policeman. The threat of an international conspiracy, the constant “no—and furthermore” that complicates our hero’s path but makes the pages turn, and the larger-than-life characters he meets make the narrative feel appropriately grand. The stakes have risen enormously since the opening scene and suicide, far greater than the motive for a single gunshot.\n\nAt times, the comic-opera tone feels studied and grates, so that the reader’s unspoken question, “What now?” occasionally comes with a grimace, not just pure anticipation. That comic tone also clashes with the ending, as if the author were trying to pull the rug out from under everything all at once, which I find too tricky by half and ungenerous besides. Still, Akunin (a pen name) has written at least ten Fandorin adventures and is apparently much beloved in Russia and abroad. It’s easy to see why.\n\nI’m glad to have sampled one of his tales, but I’m not sure I’d read another, engaging as The Winter Queen is.\n\nDisclaimer: I obtained my reading copy of this book from the public library.\n\nReview: The Third Daughter, by Talia Carner\n\nMorrow, 2019. 390 pp. $17\n\nIn 1889, Batya’s family flees a pogrom and the Russian village they’ve known all their lives for an uncertain destination. Taking to the road with as much of their meager belongings as they can manage, they find temporary sanctuary in a nearby town.\n\nBut they can’t live on charity forever, and when a wealthy man named Yitzik Moskowitz, a local hero—whom they also met on the road—makes a triumphant entry to the town, he renews his acquaintance with fourteen-year-old Batya right away. Fair-haired and pretty, she’s half his age, but when Moskowitz asks her father for her hand, making several guarantees, both the girl and her father are swept away.\n\nHe’s observed the proper formalities, which suggests he respects Jewish tradition, and he speaks to Batya’s parents as if they were his equals. Yes, he promises to wait to marry her until she turns sixteen, and to bring her to “America,” where he lives and has “important business interests.” Batya and her family believe that God has truly rewarded them.\n\nNot quite. No sooner has Batya’s betrothed gotten her away from her family than he rapes her and ships her across the ocean to Buenos Aires. He doesn’t accompany her on the voyage but sends a hireling to keep tabs on her aboard ship. This guy is one mean, vicious bastard, and you get the feeling he enjoys his work.\n\nReaders, this section of the novel is the rawest of raw and very disturbing but also faithfully rendered and undoubtedly true to life. Like her alleged husband-to-be, Batya’s new escort employs violence, sexual and otherwise, to break her spirit while giving her occasional treats, such as chocolate or beautiful clothes, the like of which she’s never seen before.\n\nThroughout, Batya clings to the hope that her betrothed didn’t intend for her to suffer this way and has been misled by the brute who’s torturing her during the ocean crossing. After all, everything that has happened on board ship shows contempt for Jewish law, and wasn’t Moskowitz a man faithful to his roots? Her naïveté is perfectly believable and all the more heartbreaking for it.\n\nBut her first views of Buenos Aires tell her that “America’s” streets aren’t paved with gold:\n\nBedraggled men wearing yarmulkes lugged baskets, carried water pails, fixed broken stairs, or offered meager belongings for sale. A band of filthy children hit empty cans with sticks, then set upon an emaciated dog, laughing as they whacked its bony back and ribs. Through ground-floor windows Batya noticed women in headscarves hunched over sewing machines, while above them women with painted faces leaned out second- and third-floor windows, calling out to passersby. One of them dangled huge breasts, barely covered, over the windowsill.\n\nThe reader knows long before Batya does that her betrothed is no husband and his business interests are brothels. And since the population of Buenos Aires — and Argentina at large — is overwhelmingly male, this business is exceptionally profitable, especially the way he operates it. The prostitutes’ food, clothing, ocean passage, and medical care must be reimbursed from the earnings. If a newcomer dies or refuses to work, the experienced prostitute assigned to show her the ropes pays whatever management has spent on the unwilling or deceased recruit.\n\nMeanwhile, Batya’s family (with no last name, oddly) has no idea what her circumstances are, because the house hires a scribe to write fairytales home about the mansion she lives in, the wonderful marriage she’s made, and so forth. Such is slavery of mind as well as body. Yet despite all this, Batya never gives up her dream to rescue her family from Russia.\n\nThe ingenuity and determination with which she sets out to achieve this makes up the bulk of The Third Daughter, and a remarkable tale it is. She faces setback after setback to be sure, and over time the opportunities that present themselves offer a stark choice: save her family or herself, but not both.\n\nAlong the way, she becomes skillful at giving pleasure, which she sometimes receives — even occasional tenderness — from her favorite clients. But having been duped once, Batya’s unwilling to believe any more lies, and therein hangs her dilemma.\n\nCarner’s grasp of historical detail, vivid throughout, is one pleasure the novel offers. I also appreciate her devotion to creating an authentic Jewish background in every locale. Circumstance modifies religious observance, which saddens the characters, who wish they could follow their traditions to the letter—another layer of authenticity.\n\nDuring the course of her education in street smarts and plans to escape, Batya takes many risks. The degree to which she gets away with breaking rules seems convenient at times, though in fairness, her life remains difficult enough. The ending is also somewhat predictable, given the moral and cultural values espoused in the book.\n\nStill, The Third Daughter is a powerful, moving story, and I recommend it.\n\nDisclaimer: I obtained my reading copy of this book from the public library.\n\nReview: An Unofficial Marriage, by Joie Davidow\n\nArcade, 2021. 278 pp. $26\n\nSaint Petersburg, 1843, the Imperial Theatre. Twenty-five-year-old Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev, who’s written dribs and drabs but is better known as an aristocratic man-about-town of intellectual interests, attends the opera. He sits in the cheapest seats, because his wealthy mother, upset at his idleness, gives him an allowance he considers meager. But even from that height and distance, to see and hear Pauline Garcia Viardot, a twenty-two-year-old soprano, sends him into ecstasy.\n\nThe ecstatic Russian audience applauds Viardot at length, which hasn’t happened in, say, Paris, where she lives, because the operatic hierarchy dictates who’s in and who’s out, and they turn up their noses at her. Her elder sister, a celebrated singer, died tragically young, and Pauline performs under her shadow. But that night in Saint Petersburg, Turgenev believes himself her most enthusiastic supporter and insists on meeting her.\n\nShe is so unlike any other woman he has ever seen that he is unable to force his gaze from her strange face, the face of an exotic, alien being. Her eyes—so large, so black, encased by thick lids that give her an almost amphibian aspect—might be petrifying. But she looks at him so gently, smiles so softly, he feels as though he has been given some special dispensation, as though in her great wisdom, she has not failed to recognize the kindness of his heart, and so has decided to spare him.\n\nIt’s love, in other words. And Turgenev can’t abide the thought that her husband, Louis, an art collector much older than she, shares her bed. For decades, Turgenev pursues her, from Russia to France, to England, and points in between. Wherever she’s performing or living, there he goes, whenever he can. As for marrying too, well, his mother has plenty of candidates, but Ivan fends them off.\n\nHowever, Turgenev, passive, possessive, and childish as he can be—and a terrible hypochondriac—isn’t the impossible, unwanted third leg of a triangle. Far from it. Pauline loves him too, and though she resists Turgenev’s desires for physical intimacy, she shares them. What’s more, Louis, who’s not blind, realizes what’s going on beneath the surface and takes the high road.\n\nConscious that Pauline doesn’t love him, despite her fondness, caring, loyalty, and sensitivity to his needs—and that Turgenev appeals to her in ways he can’t—embraces the Russian as a dear friend. Louis invites him hunting, a passion of his at which Turgenev excels, and seeks his help and advice in translation projects. Wherever Louis and Pauline make their home, Turgenev’s welcome.\n\nHistory remains vague, if not entirely mute, as to what actually happened between Pauline Viardot and Ivan Turgenev. Davidow, however, has an answer, as only fiction can provide. But the awkwardly titled An Unofficial Marriage isn’t just a will-they-or-won’t-they novel, though sexual tension underlies every chapter, if not every page. Instead, here’s an unusual coming-of-age story about two great artists—Viardot eventually became a star—finding their voices, literally or figuratively.\n\nFurther, the 1840s and 1850s, the story’s core, are a tumultuous time, full of revolution and new ideas, which the main characters must navigate, sometimes in peril of their lives or liberty. That provides historical background for them to push against and a plethora of famous names, as bushels of artists and intellectuals float through these pages.\n\nAn Unofficial Marriage tells its story in short chapters, generally separated by months or years. I’m wary of this method, which allows the author the chance to hit the high notes while ignoring the doldrums in between, but at a price of continuity and depth. For the most part, Davidow works ably around the drawbacks so that you don’t notice the lack of a unified plot or overarching theme. The question, posed at the beginning about two extraordinary people of their time, holds throughout: can they find happiness together?\n\nSeveral elements work in the novel’s favor. For one thing, I believe the characters implicitly. I can see why Turgenev would pursue Viardot, why she’d be interested, and why her husband would befriend him so as not to lose her altogether. Their relationships make sense.\n\nDavidow’s grasp of historical context, necessarily brief to accommodate the narrative structure, also puts you in the story. So does her understanding of opera. What Pauline feels during rehearsal and performance, what draws her to opera, and why so many composers want to work with her all come through. In fact, if anyone’s artistic growth needs more flesh, it’s Turgenev, whose progress as a writer—distinct from literary fame—is vague by comparison. Still, writer and singer support and influence each other’s artistic efforts. They’re collaborators, in several senses of the word.\n\nAn Unofficial Marriage tells an unusual story, in an unusual way. I enjoyed it.\n\nDisclaimer: I obtained my reading copy of this book from the public library.\n\nReview: Midnight in St. Petersburg, by Vanora Bennett\n\nSt. Martin’s, 2016 371 pp. $26\n\nIn 1911, Inna Feldman flees Kiev for St. Petersburg, a place she has no right to be. Nor does she have the right to travel there, or anywhere. But having stolen identity papers, the young Jewish woman makes a desperate attempt to escape the anti-Semitic violence in Kiev, always seething beneath the surface and recently erupting because of the prime minister’s assassination. This being Russia, popular sentiment blames the Jews.\n\nWhat’s more, on her travels she meets Father Grigory, a peasant priest who takes a kind interest in her. Students of Russian history will recognize him by a different name, but for now, what matters is that Inna confides in him another reason she left Kiev. She’s an orphan, and her guardians are emigrating to Palestine, which means she has nowhere to go. Inna hopes their son, Yasha Kagan, who works in a violin-maker’s studio in St. Petersburg, will take her in. She refers to Yasha as “cousin,” but he’s not family; she doesn’t have one.\n\nFrom these tenuous connections, Inna manages to ingratiate herself with the Lemans, the violin makers, learning the craft. She also captures two hearts, Yasha’s and that of Horace Wallick, the Lemans’ friend, an Anglo-Danish craftsman who works for the famous Carl Fabergé jewelers. The two rivals for her affections appeal to her for different, almost contradictory reasons.\n\nYasha draws her for his social conscience, in part. He writes leaflets for revolutionary groups and talks about injustice and the need for change. His looks and passionate nature also get her attention, though she deplores his bad temper and immature, selfish outbursts.\n\nBy contrast, Horace is patient and thoughtful, and Inna admires his worldliness, which he displays with charm and subtlety when he squires her around St. Petersburg. His instinctive generosity earns her gratitude, but of course Horace wants more than that, and he’s willing to wait.\n\nBennett excels at characterization, and the well-rendered love triangle amounts to much more than romantic intrigue to spice the pages of a swiftly moving narrative. Yasha and Horace represent two strains of Russian thought: the big-thinking, big-talking political activist who thinks he can change the world, versus the genteel, sensitive, sophisticated traditionalist who likes things as they are.\n\nFrom the first, you sense the author knows her ground. She conveys the fickle passions of the Russian crowd, the dyed-in-the-wool anti-Semitism, the hopeless incompetence of the governing elite, and their complete disregard for human suffering. You don’t have to read the afterword to guess that Bennett lived there for years and has imbibed the language, culture, customs, and history that inform every page.\n\nI would have liked Yasha’s and Inna’s Jewishness to receive more expression, though neither practices the faith, in their search for who they are. But at least Inna struggles with her legacy rather than dismiss it permanently with a shrug; Bennett’s too capable a novelist for that. Besides, Inna can’t forget who she is, because every passing stranger is ready to hate her for her face. This is Russia, after all.\n\nAs you might expect, Bennett conveys the political and social atmosphere with a keen eye, whether during the final years of peace before 1914 or the upheavals that follow. I do wish the narrative didn’t jump from 1912 or so to 1916, skipping the outbreak of war and the two hard years that ensue, though I’m guessing she wanted to keep the novel from bloating.\n\nNor is her goal to show everything. Unlike, say, Janet Fitch in The Revolution of Marina M or Chimes of a Lost Cathedral, Bennett relies more on small moments than epic scenes, more often showing something like the down-and-out person sifting through garbage rather than the crowd outside the Winter Palace.\n\nI admire the way those small moments stand for something larger, as with this description of the violin maker’s craft:\n\nIt was frightening all the time, of course, this work, but a small, manageable fear—a fear born of love. You lived with it as you scraped away, a shaving at a time, never quite sure you’d mastered the tools, hoping you didn’t cut your wooden infant’s throat before it took its first breath.\n\nOne theme is the purpose and meaning of artistry in life—recall that Horace fashions pretty baubles—and what part creating beauty plays in happiness. And Inna, though she seems to succeed rather quickly at the luthier’s craft, nevertheless struggles with terrible stage fright, which holds her back from performing on the instrument at which she has real talent, nurtured over years.\n\nMidnight in St. Petersburg is one of those gently surprising novels that takes hold of you and entices you onward. I highly recommend it.\n\nDisclaimer: I obtained my reading copy of this book from the public library.\n\nReview: The Revolution of Marina M., by Janet Fitch\n\nLittle, Brown, 2017. 800 pp. $30\n\nMarina Dmitrievna Makarova, as old as the century in 1916, can’t wait to break free of her constrained, privileged existence in Petrograd — or thinks that’s what she wants. Change is in the air, and desperation grips Russia, an empire bleeding its life away in a world war practically nobody supports, except her parents. Refusing to accept their rules or blandishments, she has a love affair or two, one with a fellow poet; marches on behalf of oppressed workers; and glories when the revolution topples the tsar. You can guess that this family will soon fracture even more.\n\nBut though Marina has been true to herself, she pays a terrible price. What the revolutionaries promise bears no relation to what happens in reality, and this passionate young woman, whose motto seems to be, “Act first, think afterward,” finds out the hard way. To name just two problems, it’s difficult to tell which threat is worse, famine or the Cheka, the Bolshevik secret police.\n\nAs a bourgeoise, Marina’s already an enemy of the state and can’t be too careful, constantly having to prove herself despite who she is, a direct opposite to the advantages she enjoyed in her youth. Taking care doesn’t entirely square with her impulsive nature, but she’s also a quick study and finds she has more inner resources and survival skills than she knew.\n\nThe novel opens in California, 1932, so there’s no question she survives the revolution. As my regular readers know, I detest prologues, but there’s a practical reason for this one. The current volume is only the first of a series; the author has apparently decided not to leave the reader hanging at the end, and I think she’s right. Further, the journey’s more about how and why than where, and Marina covers a lot of ground, emotionally and physically.\n\nThroughout, however, Fitch realizes the Russian atmosphere, be it Petrograd or rural peasantdom, with bold, lush strokes and complete authority. With unflagging attention to detail, she renders the idealism and mercilessness that suffuses the air, and gives you back alleys, great houses, and, in this instance, a Cheka prison:\n\nThe smell of wet walls and mold, and a dirty animal odor, increased as we descended. A slaughterhouse stench. He [the guard] walked me down the dim hall. Muffled voices came from behind thick doors. A rising shriek snaked from the base of my spine and coiled around my heart, squeezing my throat in its knot. We passed yellow walls the color of old teeth. Black sticky floors sucked at our shoes. Bare bulbs buzzed overhead. The rest of the country was plunged in darkness, but the Cheka would have its electricity.\n\nLike the Russian novels Marina M. evokes, this one has much more to it than a sweeping lens and epic events — it’s the characters who count the most. Marina takes center stage, but her lovers come through with brilliant clarity, as do her mother, younger brother, and a radical revolutionary friend. You understand what motivates these people, all of whom have inner lives for the reader to navigate. So much happens that it seems our heroine has lived a full lifetime by her nineteenth birthday, but that weight never feels like a burden, even at over eight hundred pages. That’s because Fitch keeps you in touch with the feelings of the moment.\n\nMuch of the novel revolves around Marina’s sexual awakening, mirroring her political cognizance, as she learns more about attraction and sex as power. Though she enjoys men as lovers, she seldom loses her perspective on who gets to make decisions, and who has to follow them; who gives the orders; and who does the work. This is particularly trenchant, because the revolution that was supposed to honor all work and eliminate the roles of master and servant clearly hasn’t touched relations between men and women. Once, when she witnesses a peasant wife completely efface herself before her husband, Marina observes privately that Marx may have believed that power belongs to those who control the means of production, but this mother, who has produced four children, is her husband’s chattel.\n\nMarina M. is also about betrayal, involving parents, children, lovers, ideals, or merely the greed and envy of the comrade listening at the keyhole. Marina, both victim and perpetrator, wants what she wants and won’t be denied. If at times she seems excessively larger than life or has an insight perhaps more convenient than earned, these are minor blemishes on an otherwise exceptional, engrossing novel.\n\nDisclaimer: I obtained my reading copy of this book from a neighborhood free library. I’m grateful to whoever donated it.\n\nReview: The Lost Season of Love and Snow, by Jennifer Laam\n\nSt. Martin’s, 2017. 334 pp. $17\n\nHe’s almost thirty, already Russia’s greatest poet, passionate, witty, and joyfully charismatic. She’s sixteen, gorgeous in the way that inspires poems, and yearns to free herself from a stifling household and a cruel, domineering mother. Poet and beauty are immediately attracted, and their wish comes true. Yet their marriage turns tragic, for Alexander Pushkin dies after a duel fought to defend his wife’s honor. History has blamed Natalya, because, as this novel argues, no matter what the truth, the woman’s always at fault.\n\nLaam has written biographical fiction from Natalya’s first-person point of view, to set the record straight, and I think she largely succeeds. Yet in service to the argument, the novel occasionally suffers, so though I admire and recommend The Lost Season of Love and Snow, several parts mar the total effect.\n\nThe novel begins with Alexander on his deathbed. Since everyone who knows anything about Pushkin knows he lost his life to a duel — and if you don’t know, just read the jacket flap — this puts the author in a bind. Does she reveal this out front, or does she attempt to leave the ending a surprise? Obviously, she chooses the up-front approach, and as prologues go, this one works better than most. Yet the choice demands that all tension thereafter resides entirely in the how, and since we’re told who the killer is, that places a further obstacle in the storyteller’s way. A retrospective risks making every scene superfluous until the villain enters the narrative.\n\nTo her credit, Laam does her best to overcome this problem. The courtship sections offer plenty of reversals, and Natalya suffers doubts as to her suitor’s fidelity and whether he sees her only as a bauble to possess. These anxieties create some tension and amplify the theme. Yet I was impatient to get through these scenes, and not only because the real story comes later. Natalya’s mother and two sisters are flat characters, each unfailingly mean-spirited or warm. Though the meanness provides the chance for conflict, we already understand that Natalya can’t wait to escape, so, in a sense, drawing this out serves little purpose. If, however, the author had begun the story with the courtship and suggested foreboding about the upcoming marriage, neither she nor the reader would have had to work as hard.\n\nBut the two principal players carry the show, and once they marry, their passion for one another comes through loud and clear. And as a married woman making her way in St. Petersburg society, Natalya feels the danger escalate, and so do we. This web of gossip and intrigue centers on the czar, Alexander’s patron but also a known womanizer, who woos Natalya while thwarting her husband. (Known to history as the Iron Czar, Nicholas I unfortunately comes across in these pages as wooden instead, but at least he’s plenty threatening.) Further, she acquires a reputation as a flirt, not entirely undeserved, though of course nowhere near the way jealous tongues would have it.\n\nBesides, Natalya’s motives are more nuanced than anyone could have understood. As she observes late in the narrative:\n\nMore and more, I sought escape from our little family dramas in masquerades.… When I wore my costumes, I was no longer a wife and mother with debts and a distracted husband, but a character from a fairytale, a figure from history — a goddess. Once a group approached me at a ball to tell me how fine I looked, I longed for more people to do so. I was no longer the decorative poet’s wife. For once in my life, I felt valued for myself, not for how well my presence reflected someone else’s glory.\n\nI like this psychological observation, which doesn’t go too far toward feminism for the time, yet sends a message. Even better, I like another gambit Laam tosses out during a flirtation between Natalya and the man who eventually forces Alexander to challenge him to a duel. Distressed by her husband’s spendthrift ways and haphazard work habits, she briefly fantasizes life with the worldly, handsome, wealthy philanderer — unconsciously killing off Alexander, if you will. Natalya immediately draws back, but I wish she’d toyed with her fantasy more persistently, for it would have engaged the boundary between thought and action that causes so much trouble in public misperception. Nevertheless, Laam is being very brave, here, risking her heroine’s reputation in the reader’s eyes. That is the author’s theme, and The Lost Season of Love and Snow tackles it forthrightly.\n\nDisclaimer: I obtained my reading copy of this book from the public library.\n\nReview: A Single Spy, by William Christie\n\nMinotaur/St. Martin’s, 2017. 388 pp. $26\n\nAlexsi Ivanovich Smirnov, the orphan-thief protagonist of this superb, hair-raising thriller, is both feral and sympathetic. I wouldn’t have thought that possible, but, then again, if you read A Single Spy — and if you like this genre at all, I suggest you do — you’ll discover that many things are possible.\n\nThe first is that Alexsi, as a mere teenager, is more than a match for the smugglers he’s taken up with in Azerbaijan. This would be a dangerous occupation anytime, but in 1936, there are Russian soldiers on one side and rival gangs on the other, and no one can afford scruples. Still, Alexsi trusts his instincts. As a practiced thief, he has a sixth sense for when others intend to rob or sell him, and whoever tries winds up with his throat cut. However, the NKVD catches him where he shouldn’t be, and just when he thinks he’s about to get a bullet in the skull, they startle him by offering him a job. If he passes their tests — and the penalty for failure is that bullet — he’ll work for them, doing the killing, robbing and prowling he’s always done, except for the state. The rewards can be enormous, as he learns immediately:\n\nThe first thing Alexsi noticed was that, unlike every other Soviet apartment, there wasn’t anyone else living there. Which was unprecedented in his experience. There were freshly painted walls and thick blue curtains. A sofa, chairs, a table. Spare and severe furniture, in the Soviet style, but to his eyes unbelievably luxurious. A gas stove and a refrigerator instead of an ice box. He opened it up and was greeted by a gust of cool air and shelves filled with food. Milk, sour cream, butter, cheese. If they were trying to impress him, it was working.\n\nBut everything’s a test. No question his handlers ask is ever innocent, no matter how it sounds, so he must think one step ahead, always. His greatest asset is his poker face, which conceals more than they know, in particular a detestation for bullies and a soft spot for a friend’s family, his only childhood respite from a violent, abusive father.\n\nIn the abstract, it seems improbable that an NKVD agent, hired and trained to be a ruthless operative for Comrade Stalin, would possess both a human core and a healthy skepticism of the Soviet regime. Yet Alexsi, despite his savage instincts for survival, has a code that tells him not to hurt anyone who hasn’t tried to harm him. Naturally, his instructions and that code will conflict. And the complications multiply, because he can only escape the fearful, terrifying Soviet Union by accepting an assignment to Berlin. There, he eventually joins the Abwehr and becomes a double agent, reporting everything back to Moscow at the risk of his life. Caught between two fires, Alexsi must be slippery indeed to avoid the flames. “No — and furthermore” governs every moment. Not only must he please his two masters while avoiding detection, once more, no conversation is innocent, no matter with whom. He takes to heart his NKVD mentor’s advice never to reveal his true identity to anyone, for any reason — and if they guess, he must find a way to dismiss it convincingly. The tension fairly ripples off the page.\n\nAlexsi’s vantage point allows him to make private observations, comparing the two totalitarian regimes he knows. For instance, the night of Kristallnacht, he’s studying in a university library, when he overhears someone ask nervously whether the rioting in the streets has been authorized. If it is, that means they can go see what’s happening; if not, they must stay put. Alexsi thinks, This could only happen here.\n\nWhile reading A Single Spy, I thought often of Alan Furst’s Night Soldiers, another excellent thriller about the training and adventures of an NKVD agent. Christie takes a different approach, making Alexsi’s education a tutorial affair rather than at a school among inquisitive classmates, probably essential to the scheme, because it allows the spy-in-training to keep his inner self private. But the novels are similar in at least two respects. Both rely on atmosphere, and both introduce plenty of sex. Christie even has Alexsi’s training include it, in a chilling scene that I find hard to believe and suspect was included for its titillation. The only other false note is how Aleksi, as a junior agent in Berlin, manages to be told certain monumental secrets from none other than Wilhelm Canaris, the chief of the Abwehr.\n\nBut these are quibbles. Overall, A Single Spy satisfies in many ways.\n\nDisclaimer: I obtained my reading copy of this book from the public library.\n\nReview: The Romanovs, 1613-1918, by Simon Sebag Montefiore\n\nKnopf, 2016. 744 pp. $35\n\nIn college, I studied two semesters of Russian and Balkan history with a professor who spiced his lectures with tidbits about outsize personalities, such as the aptly named Vlad the Impaler. Indeed, so well known was Professor Marcopoulos for his dry wit and remarkable breadth of knowledge that people not enrolled in the class would ask me, “Has he gotten to Rasputin yet?” because they wanted to sit in when he did.\n\nConsequently, I can’t read a book like The Romanovs without hearing my late teacher’s voice, seeing his long, looping script as he wrote the names of key figures on the blackboard, and starting in recognition when those names, which I haven’t heard uttered in more than forty years, pop up in Montefiore’s text. There’s plenty in The Romanovs that Dr. Marcopoulos would have enjoyed, including the focus on autocrats as determinants of history, and the depth of garish splendor and corruption that marked the dynasty.\n\nI particularly like the section on Catherine the Great, which successfully merges the story of her private life with her politics, including precious insight into the way she viewed power. “‘One must do things in such a way that people think they themselves want it to be done this way,’” she said. When challenged, Montefiore argues, she could be ruthless but was never cruel, and preferred subtle diplomacy to banging her desk with a fist. As a woman, she might not have survived otherwise; Frederick the Great, for one, a noted misogynist, thought she was incapable.\n\nOnce, when her secretary remarked on her boundless power, she laughed and replied that it wasn’t so easy. “‘I take advice, I consult and when I am convinced of general approval, I issue my orders and have the pleasure of observing what you call blind obedience. And that is the foundation of unlimited power.’” Regarding legends of her sexual appetites, Montefiore recounts her many love affairs, yet insists that all she really wanted was a warm home life, “sharing card games in her cosy apartments and discussing her literary and artistic interests with her beloved.”\n\nUnfortunately, Catherine’s is the only full, satisfying portrait in the book. Peter the Great comes in second, and I like aspects of Montefiore’s characterizations of Alexander II and his spineless, narrow-minded grandson, Nicholas II. Overall, however, I question the historical and narrative choices Montefiore makes, his writing style, and the numbing amount of often extraneous detail.\n\nThe author explains (repeatedly) that he’s the first to research troves of private letters that have only recently been made available to historians. I understand his pride and applaud his diligence. But just because he’s found astonishingly frank letters about sexual practices, pet names, and innumerable affairs with ladies-in-waiting and ballerinas doesn’t mean these must all be included. Such tales do convey the unbelievable corruption that plagued Russia (and still does), and some are entertaining. But I can’t help think that Montefiore simply couldn’t let any of them go, an emphasis that seriously mars his work.\n\nThe Romanovs often reads, and looks like, a suitcase that’s stuffed so full that it’s ready to spring open at the slightest touch. The text repeats itself in wordy prose that can be confusing or vague or, in some cases, unintentionally funny because of poor grammar. (Montefiore also uses the word girl when the context clearly suggests woman, an annoying, provocative lapse that, incidentally, belies his portrayal of Catherine the Great as a victim of sexism.) Voluminous footnotes occupy the bottom of almost every page; if they don’t contribute to the main narrative, why are they there, and why so many? Sexual escapades take up so much room that significant historical events and movements sometimes seem almost an afterthought. And at historical turning points, the author never looks back, refusing to ask “what if,” having summarily decided–as he says once–that “counterfactual speculation is pointless.”\n\nReally? What if it leads to deeper analysis of what actually happened? For instance, I never knew that as a prince, Alexander II visited England and charmed Queen Victoria, newly on the throne and still unmarried. Alexander’s father, Nicholas I, said, “Forget her,” and the son duly complied. But such a marriage would have changed Europe and altered the dynastic succession in Russia. Surely that’s worth a paragraph, and something illuminating might have come from it.\n\nI can’t recommend plowing through all of The Romanovs. But, as I said, several sections are worth your time, as are the stunning photographs. I also like the last three pages very much, about the ways that subsequent Russian regimes, including Putin’s, have adopted Romanov style and policies. I could have read more about that happily.\n\nDisclaimer: I obtained my reading copy of this book from the public library.\n\nReview: The Fall of the Ottomans: The Great War in the Middle East, by Eugene Rogan\n\nBasic, 2015. 485 pp. $32\n\nNot everyone will be interested in how and why the Ottoman Empire entered the First World War, and what resulted, but maybe they should be. Pick any current headline about that region, and you’ll find its roots in Rogan’s narrative, whether it’s Turkish denial of the Armenian genocide, machinations over Iraqi oil, or the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\nOf the four imperial thrones that the war toppled, Westerners probably know least about the Ottomans. (The other three were Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia.) Turkey, having fought two revolutions and three wars between 1908 and 1914, needed peace desperately. By playing the Russians off against the Germans, Turkish diplomats adeptly sought promises that would allow their country to remain neutral. But hawks who feared that their empire would break apart unless Turkey backed the winning side, successfully pushed to join the Central Powers.\n\nYou have to wonder how history might have played out had Turkey stayed neutral. What, for instance, would have happened to Palestine and the oil-producing regions? I wish Rogan had devoted space to this, but he doesn’t go in for speculation. Rather, using an astonishingly impressive array of Turkish, Arab, and European sources, he traces military campaigns and the politics that influenced or resulted from them, quoting the participants. Rogan argues that the diplomatic promises the Allies made to each other, Arab nationalists, or Zionists, derived from panic (usually overblown fears of jihadists) or fuzzy, short-term thinking. If pressed, Allied diplomats would have insisted they had promised less than the potential beneficiaries believed. Little did they know how their words would be parsed for decades to come.\n\nFrom the military side, Gallipoli gets much of Rogan’s attention, deservedly so. From the Turkish perspective, the Allied invasion signified the Crusades revisited, an attitude prevalent in the Middle East today concerning Western military power. The Turkish victory, which cost the Ottomans even more lives than the Allies, resulted from tenacity and brilliant generalship. The Allied disaster came about from ad hoc strategy executed by inept tacticians; if you believe, as I do, that the British and imperial soldiery were lions led by donkeys, Gallipoli could be Exhibit A. Rogan captures the misery, the heroism, and the fear, as with this memoir of the last moments before “going over the top”:\n\nThe moments appeared like hours–the suspense–then the officer, his eyes glued on his watch following that finger (of death) slowly, so slowly, but surely moving to destruction–maybe a second left to live–for this is sacrifice–this is the moment when all hearts are sad and heavy–when you will hear some muttering a prayer. . . .\n\nBut the greatest service Rogan renders in The Fall of the Ottomans is, I think, his thorough, vivid, and decisive handling of the Armenian genocide. To show how the tension between Turk and Armenian increased, he explains Turkish fears of Armenian collaboration with the Russian enemy, for which there was some evidence. As for what followed, Rogan names names, places, dates, and, when possible, numbers. His chilling descriptions recall aspects of the Holocaust, as with eager civilians who participated, or long, forced marches, during which thousands of Armenians, dying of thirst or starvation, were clubbed or bayoneted to death. I didn’t know that Greek Christians were deported and dispossessed (though not killed), or that Assyrian Christians met the same fate as the Armenians. These facts, rarely mentioned, are surely significant.\n\nAfter the war ended, the Turkish government prosecuted eighteen defendants accused of ordering or carrying out the massacres, hanging a few and convicting the others in absentia. (Armenian agents tracked down the missing defendants and assassinated all but one.) Apparently, the Turks were trying to placate the victors, hoping to gain favorable peace terms. When that didn’t work, the country went to war again, led by Mustafa Kemal, the hero of Gallipoli, and fixed the borders more to Turkish liking. Whether that resentment led to Turkish intransigence about admitting the genocide, Rogan doesn’t speculate.\n\nI’d have liked The Fall of the Ottomans much better had the author written more carefully. The narrative, full of repetitions and clumsy phrases, plods sometimes. But if you read this book, I guarantee that you won’t look at Middle Eastern politics in quite the same way again.\n\nDisclaimer: I obtained my reading copy of this book from the public library."
