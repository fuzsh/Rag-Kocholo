        "text": "The Sherman ISD trustees want to know what happened in the now-reversed decision to remove a transgender student from his role in the high school’s production of Oklahoma!\n\nThey unanimously voted Friday in support of opening a third-party probe into the situation, which turned Sherman into a national symbol for the backlash against LGBTQ rights.\n\nThe school board also voted to immediately remove Superintendent Tyson Bennett from supervising the fine arts program until further notice.\n\nSome theater families who spoke to trustees during Friday’s special board meeting wanted Bennett to face steeper repercussions over the way district officials treated their children. Other community members urged the board to support the superintendent.\n\nBennett declined to comment after the vote. Phillip Hightower, the father of the student at the center of the controversy, called the decision a “good start.”\n\nRelated:Why was a transgender Texas boy removed from a lead role in the school musical ‘Oklahoma’?\n\nRoughly 30 people signed up for public comment during Friday’s special meeting. Several — including local pastors and current and former Sherman ISD employees — said they came to support Bennett.\n\nBob Jones, a former athletic director, said he believes the superintendent cares for every child in the district. He drove five hours from Galveston to speak up for Bennett.\n\nJones turned to the people sitting in the board room and asked for anyone who had never made a poor decision to stand up. None did.\n\n“Get your pound of flesh somewhere else,” he said.\n\nSeveral others criticized Bennett’s leadership and moves made earlier this month when Max Hightower lost a coveted part in the Sherman High School musical. The 17-year-old senior was supposed to play Ali Hakim, a male character. On Nov. 3, shortly after Max assumed the role, his father got a call from the principal.\n\nPrincipal Scott Johnston said the school enacted a new policy that “only male actors can play male roles, and only female actors can play female roles,” Phillip Hightower recalled. School leaders would no longer allow Max, who is transgender, to play the part he’d been cast in.\n\nOn Monday night, after hours of emotional public comment, the school trustees reversed course. Board president Brad Morgan issued an apology.\n\n“The board is committed to uphold its ethical duties to include being continuously guided by what is best for all students in our district,” he said.\n\nRelated:Amid ‘Oklahoma!’ controversy, Sherman High School families speak out to board\n\nMax will get to sing his solo on stage. Girls who had been cast as male characters also got their parts back. For many in the community, the reversal isn’t enough.\n\n“There still needs to be accountability,” Phillip Hightower said.\n\nFor him and others in Sherman, accountability includes repercussions for Bennett. The superintendent has led Sherman schools since 2022, after serving in several other roles within the district.\n\nMatthew Krov, a Sherman father, asked the school board to take action to protect students.\n\n“We want you to uphold the very minimum of what we expect in education which is, do no harm,” he said. “Tyson Bennett has harmed students.”\n\nThe controversy over Oklahoma! reignited other complaints against Bennett’s leadership.\n\nAnna Clarkson directed musicals for Sherman High between 2014 and 2017. During the Monday night school board meeting, she said the Oklahoma! decision brought her back to 2015, when the high school put on a production of Legally Blonde.\n\nThat show features some LGBTQ characters and a humorous song in which Elle Woods and others try to determine if a person is gay or European — a key plot point. She recalled that the local newspaper published a story about the production ahead of opening night.\n\nClarkson told the trustees that after the article came out, Bennett called a meeting with her and her principal. Clarkson said Bennett asked “how in the world I thought it was appropriate to have lesbian and gay characters in a high school production.”\n\nUltimately, the show went on. It was already close to opening and sponsors had invested in the production.\n\nAs Clarkson recounted her experience in the meeting, those in the packed board room gasped. Bennett did not respond at the moment. He also did not immediately respond to a Thursday email from The Dallas Morning News seeking comment.\n\nFor Phillip Hightower, other stories about Bennett’s tenure are part of what’s motivating him.\n\n“If nothing happens, if there is no accountability and no change of direction, the pattern will continue,” he said.\n\nAfter the board’s vote, he said he hopes the investigator uncovers the truth about what happened at Sherman High. He hopes it leads to the removal of the superintendent.\n\nHis son didn’t join him for Friday’s meeting. Max was at a theater festival instead.\n\nThe DMN Education Lab deepens the coverage and conversation about urgent education issues critical to the future of North Texas."
