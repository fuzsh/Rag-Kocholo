        "text": "🔔Life Update. Long post alert.🔔 I'm sure some of you have been wondering why you haven't heard or seen anything from me this week? Well, Monday morning I heard the words that I've honestly never heard before...\"I have to let you go, you're just not a fit\"! My mind went numb, my heart broke and the anxiety was in full momentum!!! It was so out of the blue, I don't even have the words still, to fully convey all that has been going on this week. Maybe, a good way to describe it is emotional and mental whiplash. Having everything taken from you in a moment is something I have been more than acquainted with the last few years. (in life in general) Honestly, I thought I had finally found the place that would last for years, a place that would truly value all that I bring to the table?🥺 Sure, there was a huge learning curve and mistakes were made, there is absolutely no way around that in a new role. I'm doing my best to take the \"high road\" in all of this. My mind reels with questions, thoughts and emotions. When you put 110% into everything you do and everyone you meet, things like this hurt at a very deep level! 💔 Hopefully, you know that I am not trying bad mouth anyone, but I have always been #aunthentic and #honest with everyone here and I couldn’t not share about what’s going on now with my #linkeinfamily. I truly have no idea what is next? Right now (if you want the raw and real truth) I have no strength to start again...but I am thankful for #family and #friends who have been encouraging, loving and lifting me up during this time. Thank you, it is appreciated more than you know! 🫂💚😊 Stay tuned for updates. There’s a season for everything. #nextchapter P.S. If you know of an open role that may be a good fit? Send it my way. 🙋🏻♀️ #marketing #events #promoter #socialmediamanager #contentcreation #relationships #community #connector #wichitakansas #openforwork\n\nHey LinkedIn fam! 👋 Today, I want to talk about the incredible impact we can make by spreading positive thoughts.🌼 In a world that can sometimes feel overwhelming, a simple positive thought has the power to uplift, inspire, and create a ripple effect of goodness.🌼 Whether it's through a kind word, an encouraging message, or sharing inspiring content, let's make a conscious effort to spread positivity in our professional lives.🌼 By spreading positive thoughts, we create a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone can thrive.

I think it speaks to what we really care about as humans. I am certainly no influencer but this was interesting to me. For a couple months I have been posting daily, some HUB International company content (well designed) and targeted. Some random post or reposts that catch my attention but overall last week 3 post had the most impressions: 1. Being real about how we feel seems to resonate. I think it might happen unconsciously. We all have struggles, some obvious but most are not. 2. Helping others find happiness. Looking for a job is stressful and having an open roll in your company is more work for you until it is filled. Asking for help made this post spread quickly. It reminded me that I have great friends as well as how much humans do want to help each other. Just ask. 3. Real life events. People love sports and small peaks into others lives. Not sure why but when it’s real, it resonates. Lesson = be real and be human. It will attract attention.\n\nHey there, amazing community! 🌟 I recently read a post that spoke to me. It suggested that people write not just to be liked, but to be seen. It struck me how much we all crave to be acknowledged and valued. This inspired me to open up and share this post with you all. 💖 I have a two-part invitation for you: Firstly, let's connect more! Instead of just scrolling past a post and liking it, let's use the hashtag #HeyThereISeeYou and leave a comment. Especially on posts with a green banner, let's take a moment to show some love and support. Together, we can create such an uplifting and positive space. 🌈 Secondly, I know how draining the job search process can be. It's tough out there! That's why, starting this Thursday, I'll share one valuable thing I learned during my job search. My aim is to make it more empowering and offer better support to help you keep going. I encourage you to join in too! You have grown so much, and one thing is certain - it will only increase your gratitude for your journey. Use the hashtag #EnjoyableJobSearchLearning and transform our experiences into something positive. Can we come together and make this a reality? 🚀 I'm rooting for you! #DevelopersCommunity #PositiveVibes #SupportEachOther #InspireAndBeInspired\n\nHello LinkedIn family, I hope this post finds you all in high spirits!
