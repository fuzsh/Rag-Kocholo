Russell Library has a collection of Book Club Kits, which include 6 or more copies of each book and a discussion guide, all packaged together in a handy portable tote bag. Scroll down to see available titles.\n\nWhy Use a Book Club Kit?\n\nIt can be difficult to choose a book for a book discussion group and find enough copies for all the members of the group. We’ve made it easier by offering a wide variety of reading choices including bestselling fiction, biographies, award winners, and non-fiction.\n\nWhat is a Book Club Kit?\n\nEach Book Club Kit contains multiple copies of one title that has been selected especially for book club groups, plus a large print edition, if available. The exact number of copies in each kit is noted on the catalog record and marked on the tag attached to each bag. In addition to the books, the kits include a notebook with discussion questions, reviews, author biographies, and book club tips to stimulate discussion. You can visit the library catalog to reserve a kit, or ask any staff person for assistance.\n\nBook Club Kits can be borrowed by any book club. The kits are checked out as a whole by one member of the book club, who makes the individual copies available to club members. Each book in a kit is numbered so leaders can account for copies borrowed by group members. The person borrowing the kit will be responsible for returning it as a complete set. Books or parts of the kit cannot be returned separately.\n\nReserve a Kit!\n\nIf the Book Club Kit you wish to borrow is currently checked out, you can place a hold on it.\n\nTo place a Book Club Kit on hold, search for the title in the online catalog, select the “Place Hold” button, and fill in your name and library card number.\n\nHow long may Book Clubs keep a kit?\n\nThe loan period for Book Club Kits is 60 days.\n\nMay the kits be renewed?\n\nYes, a Book Club Kit loan will automatically renew for 60 days, if there are no holds or reserves on it.\n\nWhat if a book is lost?\n\nIf your group loses a book, there will be a replacement fee for the lost copy. The fee varies depending on the format of the book.\n\nBook Club Kits\n\nBecoming\n\nBy Michelle Obama\n\nIn her memoir, Michelle Obama chronicles the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address.\n\nBlack Cake\n\nBy Charmaine Wilkerson\n\nEleanor Bennett’s death leaves behind a puzzling inheritance for her two children, Byron and Benny: a traditional Caribbean black cake, made from a family recipe with a long history, and a voice recording.\n\nThe Book Woman of Troublesome Creek\n\nBy Kim Michelle Richardson\n\nTraveling librarian, Cussy Mary Carter is not only a book woman, she’s also the last of her kind, her skin a shade of blue unlike anyone else.
