        "text": "Document 1: Memories of Fran Boggs Metcalf\n\nOn December 7, 1941, the entire United States of America was shocked, frightened and angry that the Japanese would dare to attack our country. This horrible tragedy soon emanated into sensational, nationwide patriotism…My brother Jim was in the Navy, stationed at a Navy air base at that time, and wrote interesting letters about how much he enjoyed being an aviation mechanic. He was very convincing and I decided right then that I was going to join the Navy and follow in his footsteps…\n\nOn my 20th birthday, since this was the age requirement, I took a streetcar downtown and was sworn in as a Navy WAVE, an acronym for Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service…It was July 21, 1944 when I was sworn in on a delayed entry…\n\nFinally, I arrived at Floyd Bennett Field Naval Air Station. We were quartered in the women's bunkroom, 50 women to each bunkroom, four bunks to a cubicle (two upper, two lower), with clothes closets at the end of the bunks…We had a community type shower, no curtains or privacy, with long rows of sinks, toilets and mirrors adjoining the shower room…\n\nThere was practically no dissention, as the women were all congenial. I remember only two incidents in the bunkroom. One person wanted to keep her kitten in the barracks, while others didn't like the idea. The other instance was the time when some of the women wanted the windows open, while only one woman objected. Their differences were settled amicably…\n\nWomen could be in the WAVES if they were married with no children, but not if they were pregnant, which is not the case today. I remember that one woman was discharged when it was discovered that she was pregnant.\n\nWe were not allowed to leave the base in slacks. Full dress uniforms were mandatory. Slacks and jeans were proper dress on the base. I remember my bell-bottom jeans that were so comfortable for working…\n\nI was finally assigned to an airplane crew... I carried lots of tools, washed props down, changed oil filters, unbuckled cowling and dusted cockpits. I worked on F4Us, F4Fs and PBYs…\n\nI never accomplished my intention of becoming an airplane mechanic…While many of the women were adept in their jobs as mechanics, that wasn't in my future. One morning a WAVE officer walked through the ACU Outfights office and was incensed at the language that she heard. She told them to get a woman in that office immediately. So, that is how I finally got my job in the office of ACU Outflights, logging in airplanes flown in from Grumman Aircraft, and then logging them out, after they were checked by the plane crews, to go aboard aircraft carriers going out to sea…\n\nI recall how I kept aspirin in my desk drawer at ACU Outflights for the young sailors, many younger than myself, who would arrive for duty with terrible hangovers. I knew it was possible they could be transferred onto ships going out to sea. Some of them were only 17 and I was 20, so they seemed like little boys to me.\n\nI still meet with my bunkmate, Amy Foster Feluk, several times a year continuing our 60-year friendship in 2004…\n\nDocument 1 was written by Fran Metcalf, March 22, 2004. Fran’s complete memories are available in the National Archives’ catalog.\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nWhy did Fran keep aspirin in her desk for the young sailors?\n\nWhy do you think the WAVE officer wanted to “get a woman in that office” with the men who used foul language?\n\nWhy do you think that WAVES were not allowed to leave the base wearing pants? How do you think Fran felt about this rule?\n\nWhat were Fran’s reasons for joining the WAVES?\n\nDocument 2: Memories of Amy Foster Feluk\n\nI went into the Navy in September 1944. Boot Camp was at Hunter College in the Bronx, New York…Finally, I was assigned to Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, New York. I went from the Bronx, Hunter College to Flatbush by the subway, by myself. They gave me instructions on how to travel. A \"cattle car\" met me at the Flatbush Avenue subway station and took me to Floyd Bennett Field. The cattle cars were semis with enclosed trailers. When I arrived at the front gate, they checked me in, and sent me to the WAVES barracks.\n\nWAVES were on duty on a four-day duty schedule. One weekend we were off on Saturday, one weekend we were off on Sunday, one weekend we were off on Saturday and Sunday, and one weekend we were on duty all weekend…\n\nOn the base WAVES had to go to mess, church or the PX (post exchange) by cattle car. Standing room only! …The hangars were on the opposite side of the base. I worked in Hangar A. I was a trainee Apprentice Aviation Machinist Mate. The unit was A.C.U. or Aircraft Commissioning Unit…\n\nOn weekend pass or anytime we were free, the WAVES normally headed for Manhattan. WAVES would leave the base in cattle cars and go into Flatbush to take the subway into Manhattan. We would go to the U.S.O. [an organization that provides services to people in the military] first. It was located on Times Square. The U.S.O. would have free tickets or passes for musicals, movies, roller skating, dance clubs like the Copacabana and Toots Shor's, and to Radio City Music Hall.. If we stayed in Flatbush, WAVES would go to the Blue Mirror, which had dancing and drinks, or we would go to a restaurant to have some \"good\" food like hamburgers, hot dogs and food we didn't get on the base. Sometimes we went to Coney Island in Brooklyn…\n\nOne thing I learned was to watch out for props when they were turning. I saw one sailor lose the top of his head when he walked into the propeller.\n\nWhile being on the basketball team I sprained both knees while guarding. The game was between Christmas and New Year 1945 in Rhode Island. When I came back I was put on KP [kitchen police] in our bunkroom. I was there for two months, as I could not work on the airplanes at the time.\n\nDocument 2 was written by Amy Feluk, March 22, 2004. Amy’s complete memories are available in the National Archives’ catalog.\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nWhy do you think Amy emphasized the fact that she traveled to Flatbush by herself?\n\nWhat does the fact that Amy could not work on the airplanes with sprained knees tell you about the physical requirements of her job?\n\nDid Amy and the other WAVES do more relaxing or more exciting activities on their days off? Why do you think they sought out that type of activity?"
