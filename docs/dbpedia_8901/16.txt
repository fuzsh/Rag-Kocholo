Confession: My fear of ants came from a 1977 horror movie starring Joan Collins entitled “Empire of the Ants.”

This film was basically about giant mutant ants who go around killing people. Yes, these are the kinds of movies that I was raised on – I blame a couple of uncles…

Radioactive waste created the mutant ants. The ants then went on to terrorize a beachfront paradise community. Joan Collins played the area’s corrupt real estate developer.

The film was directed by monster film regular Bert I. Gordon, who was known for different low-tech effects projection techniques. As such, the effects in this film, along with the photography in general, were pretty dated. The plot, for those not of child age, will also come across as quite thin.
