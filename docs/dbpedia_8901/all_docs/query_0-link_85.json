        "text": "It’s Creepy Crawlers month here at Horror Press, and while there may be something creepier, there’s certainly nothing crawlier than one of my favorite subgenres of the 1950s: the giant nuclear bug movie. Name a creepy crawler. An insect, an arachnid, four legs, six legs, eight legs, a hundred… If it exists, somewhere in 1950s cinema it has been irradiated, grown to terrifying size, and crushed puny little humans beneath its mighty, composited feet. On this month’s Horror 101, we’re here to give you a quick and dirty breakdown of the who, what, and why behind this towering titan of science fiction tropes.\n\nWhy Were 1950s Sci-Fi Movies Obsessed with Radiation?\n\nWouldn’t you be obsessed with radiation if you were living in the years after the atomic bombs were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II? Sure, in America, plenty of people at the time were pretty pleased with themselves about said atrocity. But those concerns were nevertheless ever-present. Did the testing we performed to put the bomb together already plant the seed of our own destruction in our soil, water, and DNA? Will other countries pick up on what we did and, in return, split the atom on our smug asses? These fears have carried on into the modern era, of course, but the ongoing Cold War stoked those tensions to a fever pitch in the 1950s.\n\nIt might seem unlikely that people flocked to see movies about scientists tampering in God’s domain and having their nuclear testing go wrong and bite them in the ass. Or the torso. Or the head. However, like many a good horror movie, those giant nuclear bug titles provoked a reaction by playing into those fears, only to have the intrepid heroes solve them, neutralize the threat, and probably mack on a sexy lady scientist at some point in the process. Or, more likely, mack on a sexy lady who’s the daughter of a scientist – the 1950s weren’t exactly a haven of progressive virtue.\n\nWhatever the case, those movies poke at the wound a little bit, only to bandage it up and tie a little bow around it by the end. They offered the same cathartic experiences as horror stories throughout time, allowing audiences a glimpse into their deepest fears just long enough for them to begin to cope with them.\n\nWhat Are Some Key Giant Nuclear Bug Movies?\n\nThem! (1954, dir. Gordon Douglas) – Them!, which follows giant ants rampaging around New Mexico, isn’t fucking around. It literally ends with a character more or less staring into the camera and wondering what other horrors the Trinity test and ongoing nuclear testing may have unleashed that we are as yet unaware of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTarantula (1955, dir. Jack Arnold) – Arnold didn’t direct too much else under the giant nuclear bug territory, but he did helm It Came from Outer Space, Creature from the Black Lagoon, and The Incredible Shrinking Man, so when he talks, you listen. The titular tarantula that took to the hills has been embiggened thanks to tests attempting to use a radioactive element to create an artificial super-nutrient, showcasing how even the best intentions can lead to destruction and chaos. Oppenheimer who?\n\nBeginning of the End (1957, dir. Bert I. Gordon) – This schlocky but entertaining venture follows USDA testing of radioactive fertilizer causing a cloud of giant locusts to tear their way through Illinois. Keep an eye on this Bert I. Gordon fellow. The notorious B.I.G. made plenty of giant movies, nuclear movies, and bug movies, though not always at the same time, including King Dinosaur (1955), The Cyclops (1957), The Amazing Colossal Man (1957), War of the Colossal Beast (1958), The Spider (1958), Village of the Giants (1965), The Food of the Gods (1976), and Empire of the Ants (1977).\n\nMonster from Green Hell (1957, dir. Kenneth G. Crane) – The giant wasps here are exposed to cosmic radiation. I’ve decided that this premise does count for the list, because even though our scientific hubris didn’t come from exposing the wasps to radiation on purpose, we still sent wasps up to space in the first place, which seems like a silly idea if you ask me.\n\nMothra (1961, dir. Honda Ishirô) – OK, the Japanese monster movie Mothra is a little outside the scope of its study for multiple reasons, not the least of all being its year of release. However, it does involve a giant nuclear moth who defends her remote island home against further nuclear testing. The combination of gentleness and power at the center of both the story and the titular figure in Mothra is a beautiful button on a decade of tension and dismay, offering a way forward beyond mere catharsis.\n\nFor more giant bug fun without the “nuclear” part, see The Black Scorpion (1957), The Deadly Mantis (1957), and The Spider (1958). For a giant nuclear octopus, see It Came from Beneath the Sea (1955). For a non-giant nuclear teenage werewolf, see I Was a Teenage Werewolf (1957). For the granddaddy of giant nuclear monsters, see Honda’s previous monster movie Godzilla (1954), which of course was already a riff on the giant nuclear dinosaur movie The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking to expand your horror knowledge even more? Check out our other HORROR 101 articles here!\n\nAs August’s theme is Road Trip Month here at Horror Press, there is one aspect of horror out on the open road you might have forgotten about. While most of the action takes place on the asphalt as psychotic hillbillies chase their prey down in trucks and slashers hide in the backseat of their target’s cars, both killers and victims alike need somewhere to stay on long nights. You need a place to lay your head down. You need a hotel.\n\nAnd because Horror Press always has the concerned traveler in mind, we’ve reviewed some classic horror movie hotels and motels and rated how nice they’d actually be to stay in.\n\nWe’re factoring in four key qualities and rating them on a scale of 1 to 10:\n\nThe quality of the staff and management\n\nThe cleanliness and comfort of the rooms\n\nThe amenities available to guests\n\nOh, and most importantly, how cool I am with dying here (abbreviated as H.C.A.I.W.D.H?).\n\nBecause…it’s a horror movie hotel, you’re probably going to die there.\n\nWe’ll be beginning with the most unpleasant and working our way up to the best. Unsurprisingly, we start with…\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRATING HOTELS IN HORROR\n\nTHE KAHIKI PALMS MOTEL (THE DEVILS REJECTS)\n\nEven before the brutal torture and murders that took place here, the Kahiki Palms Motel wasn’t a sight for sore eyes when pulling off the highway. It’s got many of the same problems the Bates Motel has (more on that later), and the place is completely filthy even before the Firefly’s step foot in it.\n\nBeyond that, you’re in the middle of Texas cooking in the heat, with no AC and an ice machine that has definitely got sand in it. No bueno. The exterior looks cool at least, just stop and take some photos out there without actually checking in.\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 1/10\n\nROOMS: 1/10\n\nAMENITIES: 1/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 1/10\n\nSEVEN DOORS HOTEL (THE BEYOND)\n\nThe Seven Doors Hotel is smack dab in the southern United States, in a woody and almost swampy part of Louisiana, near New Orleans but sitting directly over one of the seven gates to hell. It’s in disrepair, like many of the others on the list, but that’s nothing a little tender care and love from the new management can’t fix!\n\nJust kidding, this place is unfixable.\n\nYou should never stay at a hotel being run out of desperation. The owner, Liza, is hard up on cash and willing to put up with some supernatural nonsense to try and turn a profit, but she’s in way over her head. Some people just don’t have the heart or brains for hospitality, let alone hospitality when there’s some Lovecraftian black magic going on. An abundance of zombies and a possessed dog put this pretty low on the list of voluntary stays, especially when there aren’t any good views of nature to make up for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteer clear of this weird antebellum health hazard if you can, although a one-night excursion might be your only choice if the state of Airbnb in New Orleans is as terrible as it is everywhere else.\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 3/10\n\nROOMS: 5/10\n\nAMENITIES: 3/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 3/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOVERALL RATING: 3/10\n\nBATES MOTEL (PSYCHO FRANCHISE)\n\nLet’s get all the iterations of this place out of the way, since they’re pretty much the same: they’re kind of sleepy, fairly dusty, and completely underserviced given they don’t get much business. The biggest highlight of staying here is that beautiful house out back, and you don’t even really get to enjoy that outside of seeing Norman pace in the window. Sorry, seeing Mother pace in the window. There’s a difference.\n\nAssuming you are not a woman Bates falls in love with or someone investigating him, you’re pretty safe; after all, it’s just him. But it’s also just him running the motel. He is fairly nice when he isn’t consumed by a homicidal persona but remember: all it takes is one of his mental breakdowns happening during the night for him to be in a mumu walking around with a kitchen knife while the front desk phone is left ringing. Next thing you know, you’re waiting for room service while he’s cleaning up the remains of some private detective off the floor. You’re alive, but you’re also waiting for a cold, probably poorly cooked burger.\n\nStaff and management get two points since it’s technically one guy with two personalities, but that’s being generous.\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 2/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nROOMS: 4/10\n\nAMENITIES: 3/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H.?: 6/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 4/10\n\nTHE HOTEL CORTEZ (AMERICAN HORROR STORY: HOTEL)\n\nI’m not staying here, there’s like eight different ways you could die and none of them are good! Why would I ever—wait was that Lady Gaga?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSTAFF AND MANAGEMENT: 10/10\n\nROOMS: 6/10\n\nAMENITIES: 6/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 1/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 6/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHE YANKEE PEDDLER INN (The Innkeepers)\n\nI like Ti West’s directing, but I’m not going to Connecticut to sleep in a tough queen bed with a scratchy quilt. It could be worse, as we’ve seen with previous entries on this list, but it could also be better. Claire and Luke seem like pretty reliable employees, and as long as you don’t go around swinging crystal pendulums and disturbing the traumatized ghosts, you should be fine. 6’s across the board, I guess?\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 6/10\n\nROOMS: 6/10\n\nAMENITIES: 6/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 6/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOVERALL RATING: 6/10\n\nTHE DOLPHIN HOTEL (1408)\n\nThere is only one room in the hotel that is technically haunted, but we have to assume you’re getting that one because it’s kind of the whole premise of the movie. In which case, you have a 99% chance of dying in a horrible way, and you don’t get any rest or relaxation as the spirits haunting Room 1408 pump your brain full of harrowing illusions.\n\nIt’s not a very safe space for people wrestling with trauma or suffering from pre-existing mental health issues, but I guess what a haunted house is? Our protagonist, Mike, does manage to escape in the end (at least, one of the four endings this film has, I haven’t seen the others), but unless you have a bottle of 151-proof in your luggage to torch the place, you’re ironically kind of cooked.\n\nStaff seemed nice when they aren’t letting you walk to your death, it’s got a good view, and you’ll at least have something interesting to write about if you make it out of there.\n\nEditor, don’t even think about it.\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 7/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nROOMS: 7/10\n\nAMENITIES: 7/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 1/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 6/10\n\nTHE OVERLOOK HOTEL (THE SHINING, DOCTOR SLEEP)\n\nA scary giant hedge maze, snow-blanketed exteriors, and a high-quality turn-of-the-century architectural experience. Good lord, it even has high vaulted ceilings and clean-cut interior design. There are even opportunities to go skiing nearby. The Overlook gets a bad rap for being the site of a bunch of gruesome killings, but in their defense, your honor, the hotel was just evil. All that other stuff happened because the vibes were off.\n\nIs it possible to rehabilitate the place like the Torrance family tried? Not at all. Will you die if you stay there? Absolutely. Is it kind of worth it, cause the place is just so gorgeous? I’m not here to make that judgement for you, but you know you only get to travel so many times in your life, you might as well make the last one a bang.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can always count on the management and other guests to be particularly friendly, helping you out of pickles like getting locked in a pantry. They enable your bad habits too, of course, but at least you’ll have company once you’ve frozen to death out there. Who knows, they might even put you in one of their cool time paradox photos!\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 8/10\n\nROOMS: 8/10\n\nAMENITIES: 6/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 6/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOVERALL RATING: 7/10\n\nTHE GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL (TWIN PEAKS)\n\nThis is objectively the right answer, no? The entire Great Northern Hotel is gorgeous with its rich, dark, wood interiors, lit warmly and designed with comfort in mind. It’s serene, has a beautiful look to it, and if you’re not Dale Cooper, your chances of getting shot in the stomach are zero to none!\n\nAnd sure, the Horne Family that runs it is, on occasion, embroiled in scandal. And MAYBE Benjamin Horne is an irredeemable piece of garbage who wants to tear down the Ghostwood forest. And MAYBE he also owns a combination casino and brothel that he frequents. And MAYBE he’s partially responsible for the murder of a young woman who may or may not have been tortured to death by a demon/spirit/tulpa/doppleganger/Lynchian nightmare but…I mean, look at it! Tell me you wouldn’t want to stay there! Stop trying to take this away from me!\n\nAt least the Great Northern doesn’t have fish in its percolator.\n\nSTAFF & MANAGEMENT: 2/10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nROOMS: 10/10\n\nAMENITIES: 10/10\n\nH.C.A.I.W.D.H?: 10/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 8/10\n\nAdvertisement"
