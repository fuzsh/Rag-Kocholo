        "meta_description": "This is a list of giant monster films according to their release date. Films involving giant monsters began with the 1925 film The Lost World, as developments in cinema and animation enabled the creation of realistic giant creatures. This was followed by the 1933 classic King Kong. These early films had themes of adventure and exploration of unknown regions, and incorporated fights with giant monsters as a climactic element. The development of atomic weaponry in the 1940s gave rise to its involvement in popular themes. Japanese cinema began its foray into giant monster films with the 1954 film Godzilla, a giant reptile created by nuclear radiation. The Americans brought out their own film along similar themes with 1953's The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, featuring an Arctic hibernating dinosaur, and 1954's Them!, which involved giant irradiated ants. The British followed with Gorgo in 1961, and 1955's Tarantula had a spider rather than insect. Japanese cinema continued with a giant moth in Mothra, and turtle in Gamera. Dinosaur-themed films experienced a revival in the 1960s with a 1960 remake of The Lost World, 1966's One Million Years B.C., and 1969's The Valley of Gwangi. Movies featuring Godzilla and Gamera were made into the 1970s, and 1976 saw a high-profile remake of King Kong. Awareness of toxic waste in the 1970s may have inspired 1979's Prophecy, which featured a giant mutant bear in the woods in Maine.",

        "text": "The Lost World is a 1925 silent film adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 book of the same name. The movie was produced by First National Pictures, a large Hollywood studio at the time, and stars Wallace Beery as Professor Challenger. This version was directed by Harry O. Hoyt and featured pioneering stop motion special effects by Willis O'Brien (an invaluable warm up for his work on the original King Kong directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack). Writer Doyle appears in a frontspiece to the film. In 1998, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\nKing Kong is a Pre-Code 1933 fantasy monster adventure film co-directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, and written by Ruth Rose and James Ashmore Creelman after a story by Cooper and Edgar Wallace. The film tells of a gigantic island-dwelling gorilla-like creature called Kong who dies in an attempt to possess a beautiful young woman. The film stars Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong and Bruce Cabot, and opened in New York City on March 2, 1933 to good reviews. Kong is distinguished for its stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien and its musical score by Max Steiner. The film has been released to video, DVD, and Blu-ray, and has been computer colorized. In 1991, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically and aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nThe character \"Santa\" is a vagabond whose main source of income is locating lost coins on the streets of Tokyo. He is dating the pretty girl Omitsu, but her father Seizo does not consider him suitable for becoming his son-in-law. Seizo breaks-up their relationship and finds a new, wealthy boyfriend for Omitsu. Santa figures that he needs money to regain his girlfriend, and starts desperately seeking for a job. But nobody is willing to hire him. Noticing that the foreign-import film \"King Kong\" is a box office hit, Santa offers to dress up as King to promote a movie theater that is playing this film. He is hired on a try-out basis. Santa starts regularly appearing as King Kong in theaters, and goes on staged rampages against miniature buildings. During one of his performances, he notices Omitsu with her new boyfriend. Blinded by rage, Santa goes on a real rampage and chases after the man, both inside and outside the theatre. Santa beats up the man and leaves his unconscious body on the streets. But the audience thinks that his rampage was part of the performance and they are enthusiastic about it. He gets offered a higher salary for repeat performances, and he now has enough money to gain Seizo's approval and to start dating Omitsu again.\n\nThe Beast from 20,000 Fathoms is a 1953 science fiction film directed by Eugène Lourié and stars Paul Christian, Paula Raymond and Cecil Kellaway with visual effects by Ray Harryhausen. The film is about an atomic bomb test in the Arctic Circle that unfreezes a hibernating fictional dinosaur, a Rhedosaurus, that begins to wreak havoc in New York City. It was one of the first monster movies that helped inspire the following generation of creature features, coining it with the atomic age.\n\nGodzilla (ゴジラ Gojira?) is a 1954 Japanese science fiction film. The film was directed by Ishirō Honda and produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka. In 1956, a heavily edited version was released in the U.S. as Godzilla, King of the Monsters!. The original Japanese-language version is now available in the United States and Britain under the title Gojira. It was the first of many \"giant monster\" movies (known as kaiju) to be produced in Japan, many of which also feature Godzilla.\n\nThem! is a 1954 American black and white science fiction film about man's encounter with a nest of gigantic irradiated ants. It is based on an original story treatment by George Worthing Yates. It was developed into a screenplay by Ted Sherdeman and Russell Hughes for Warner Bros. Pictures Inc., and was produced by David Weisbart and directed by Gordon Douglas. It starred James Whitmore, Edmund Gwenn, Joan Weldon and James Arness.\n\nOne of the first of the \"nuclear monster\" movies, and the first \"big bug\" film, Them! was nominated for an Oscar for Special Effects and won a Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing. The film starts off as a simple suspense story, with police investigating mysterious disappearances and unexplainable deaths. The giant ants are not even seen until almost a third of the way into the film.\n\nGodzilla Raids Again (ゴジラの逆襲 Gojira no Gyakushū?), also known in the United States as Gigantis, the Fire Monster, is a 1955 Japanese black and white tokusatsu kaiju film directed by Motoyoshi Oda, written by Shigeaki Hidaka and Takeo Murata, and produced by Toho. It was the sequel to the previous year's successful Godzilla and was the second film in the Godzilla franchise. It is the first film to feature Anguirus. It is the first film in the series (and in kaiju eiga) to feature a battle between two monsters. Although director Ishirō Honda and composer Akira Ifukube did not return for this sequel, the special effects were once again created by Eiji Tsuburaya.\n\nThe English title Godzilla Raids Again was created by Toho in the 1950s, but only appeared onscreen in later US television and home video releases. The 1959 U.S. release was titled Gigantis the Fire Monster, and Godzilla's name was changed for this version of the film. The American and Japanese versions of the film vary considerably.\n\nHalf Human, originally released in Japan as Jūjin Yuki Otoko (獣人雪男?, lit. \"Monster Snowman\"), is a tokusatsu film produced and released by Toho Film Productions Ltd. in 1955. The film was made by Toho's legendary Godzilla production team of Ishirō Honda, Eiji Tsuburaya, and Tomoyuki Tanaka. This was director Honda's second assignment in the kaiju (or monster) genre, after the original Godzilla (1954). According to Wikipedia Japan, the movie has been removed from circulation due to the original screenplay describing the inhabitants of the remote village similar to the Ainu people as being deformed from generations of inbreeding. However, no such reference is made in the film's dialogue, but for this reason broadcasters and media publishing companies have refrained from showing it.\n\nt Came from Beneath the Sea (1955) is an American science fiction film produced by Sam Katzman and Charles Schneer for Columbia Pictures, from a script by George Worthing Yates designed to showcase the special model-animated effects of Ray Harryhausen. It was directed by Robert Gordon and stars Kenneth Tobey, Faith Domergue, and Donald Curtis. Much of the filming was done at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard, including scenes aboard a submarine, and several naval personnel were given supporting roles. One of the main radar man characters is Joseph R. Fanning from Valdosta, Ga. He was an instructor there at the San Francisco Naval Base.\n\nRodan, released in Japan as Sora no Daikaijū Radon (空の大怪獣 ラドン?, lit. \"Radon, Giant Monster of the Sky\"), is a 1956 tokusatsu film produced by Toho Studios. It was the studio's first daikaiju eiga filmed in color (though Toho's first color tokusatsu film, Madame White Snake, was released earlier that year). It is one of a series of \"giant monster\" movies that found an audience outside Japan, especially in the United States, where it was originally released as Rodan! The Flying Monster!\n\nBeginning of the End is a 1957 American science fiction film directed by Bert I. Gordon and starring Peter Graves and Peggie Castle. The film is about an agricultural scientist (Graves) who has successfully grown gigantic vegetables using radiation. Unfortunately, the vegetables are then eaten by locusts (the swarming phase of short-horned grasshoppers), which grow to gigantic size and attack the nearby city of Chicago. The film is generally recognized for its \"atrocious\" special effects and considered to be one of the most poorly written and acted science fiction motion pictures of the 1950s.\n\nThe Giant Claw is a 1957 science fiction film about a giant bird that terrorizes the world. Produced by Clover Productions under the working title 'Mark of the Claw' and released through Columbia Pictures, it starred Jeff Morrow and Mara Corday, and was directed by Fred F. Sears. The film has been a staple of the bootleg video market with only two official VHS releases (one in the USA through Goodtimes Home Video and the other through Screamtime in the United Kingdom) to date. Columbia Pictures finally released the film officially to DVD in October 2007 as part of the two disc four film set Icons of Horror Collection - Sam Katzman.\n\nVaran the Unbelievable, released in Japan as Giant Monster Varan (大怪獣バラン Daikaijū Baran?), is a 1958 daikaiju eiga (giant-monster movie) directed by Ishirō Honda (drama) and Eiji Tsuburaya (tokusatsu), and their last black-and-white monster film. The title character Varan is one of Toho Studios' least-famed creations. Although shown in Japanese-language theaters in the USA, the film saw general U.S. release in 1962 only after being heavily revised, in the manner of Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, to have all principal scenes reshot with American actors. Indeed, the plot itself was generally revised, and the Japanese material consisted only of special effects, a few incidental shots, and the ending scene."
