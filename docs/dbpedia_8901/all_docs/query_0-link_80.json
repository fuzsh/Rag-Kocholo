        "text": "Like spiders and scorpions, ants also helped make some of the best horror films in history. And unlike those good-natured, friendly bugs like Flik and Z from A Bug’s Life and Antz, the ants you’ll meet in these movies would definitely scare the brains out of you! They’re big, they’re smart, and they’re hungry for human flesh!\n\nLuckily, most of them don’t exist in real life; your pest and termite control can only handle normal-sized vermin in any case. Want to check out some of these scary flicks? Here are some:\n\nThe Naked Jungle (1954)\n\nMail-order bride Joanna (Eleanor Parker) is having a difficult relationship with her new husband Christopher Leiningen (Charlton Heston). But will a host of invading Marabunta ants save their marriage, or will it just harden Christopher’s resolve to send his wife back to the US as the ants destroy the home he worked so hard to build?\n\nThem! (1954)\n\nAnts at least eight feet or longer were found killing locals from the sleepy town of Alamogorde, New Mexico. Soon these gigantic bugs were causing nationwide panic as they try to expand their territory and establish colonies, leading the president of the United States declared martial law on Los Angeles and urging the people to fight the ants on spillways and sewers underneath the city. It’s us or them!\n\nScary ants, aren’t they? Good thing these guys don’t exist in real life, ‘cause no normal man would be able to kill them, much less stop them! But you can sleep rest assured that if they DO accept, pest control services will be here for you.\n\nPhase IV (1974)\n\nWhile the ants featured in this flop film were not a freakishly big as their cousins elsewhere, they’re definitely more intelligent! This is largely thanks to an unknown cosmic incident which left them more evolved and enhanced. Now it’s up to a group of scientists and a small family to try and stop them. Heroes and villains can be found from both sides as they battle it out, leaving audiences wondering who the good guys are between the two.\n\nEmpire of the Ants (1977)\n\nLoosely based on H.G. Wells’ short story of the same name, this flick also features giant ants that resulted from a combination of human foolishness and toxic spill. Led by their sentient queen, these ants are determined to wipe out humanity and build an evil ant empire. But will a group of people led by shady land developer Marilyn Fryser stop them?\n\nIt Happened at Lakewood Manor (1977)\n\nThe old Lakewood Manor Hotel suddenly found itself under siege by a swarm of unusually dangerous and aggressive ants, and it’s up to a small group of hotel guests and staff to get everyone out as the establishment gets overrun by millions of these hostile crawling insects.\n\nLegion of Fire: Killer Ants! (1998; flesh-eating ants)\n\nSomewhat a remake of the 1954 film The Naked Jungle, it features Marabunta ants that came all the way from South America to wreak havoc on the small town of Burly Pines. Against them stand Dr. Jim Conrad, Sheriff Jeff Coy and school teacher Karen.\n\nThe Bone Snatcher (2003)\n\nWhen people kept inexplicably disappearing in a desert diamond mine, a team led by Dr. Straker is sent to investigate. Little did they know that the cause for all the trouble is a species of intelligent ant-like bugs bent on killing them for their bones.\n\nThe Hive (2008)"
