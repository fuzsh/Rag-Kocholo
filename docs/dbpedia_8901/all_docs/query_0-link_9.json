        "text": "*. We begin with some footage of regular ants just doing their thing while a voiceover warns us not to take any of this lightly. “This is the ant. Treat it with respect, for it may very well be the next dominant life form of our planet. Sound incredible? Impossible? Have you ever taken a good, close look at what the ant is all about?”\n\n*. OK, that’s a closer right there. Have you ever taken a good, close look at what the ant is all about? Hm? And we’re not done yet. “Frightening, isn’t it, that a creature as small as an ant is able to have a fair claim to rank next to man in the scale of intelligence? They have a sophisticated communication system. Specific messages are transmitted from one ant to another, through the use of a chemical substance called pheromones. It causes an obligatory response. Did you hear that? Obligatory. Pheromones give an order that cannot be disobeyed. It’s a mind-bending substance that forces obedience. But we don’t have to worry about it. That’s business better left to the ants . . .”\n\n*. Obligatory! Did you hear that? Well then buckle up because we’re in for a rocky ride.\n\n*. Empire of the Ants was director Bert Gordon’s follow-up to his equally schlocky The Food of the Gods, with the two films constituting a kind of H. G. Wells diptych. Some people lump in American International’s Island of Dr. Moreau to make it a trilogy, but that movie is a different beast altogether. In any event, I defy anyone to find a connection between Wells’s story “Empire of the Ants” and this movie, which is supposedly “based on” it. I mean, there’s the title. And there are ants. But that’s it.\n\n*. The film proper kicks off with some barrels of radioactive waste being tossed into the ocean and one of them subsequently washing ashore while oozing what looks like liquid mercury. Then cut to Joan Collins as a real estate promoter arriving on that same Florida shore in a boat filled with people she’s trying to sell on an idyllic retirement community that’s really just a swamp in the middle of nowhere.\n\n*. There’s nothing to see at the building site but the tour group is soon set upon by giant ants. This is just one of many puzzles the film throws up. How did the ants get so big so fast? I mean, we see a barrel of radioactive waste wash ashore. We see it’s sprung a leak and tiny ants are crawling over the silvery sludge coming out of it. This is the day the tour arrives! So the ants grow to monster size not in weeks or months but in a matter of hours or even minutes. Then, when the party escape to a nearby town the very next day they find that the ants have already taken it over using those commanding pheromones that force obedience. Those ants are fast operators!\n\n*. The time scheme is just part of the general air of goofy slack though. There are also continuity errors. Dialogue that isn’t synched with people’s mouths being open. And of course the special ant effects have them changing size wildly and some shots where they don’t align with the rest of the action at all. In the fight on the boat we see Joe waving his paddle wildly in the air, not even in the direction of the giant ants processed on the right side of the screen.\n\n*. So it’s a terrible movie. But is it a good bad movie? Years ago I would have said no, but it’s grown on me. I almost felt sorry for bitchy “mean queen” Joan Collins having to chaperone these jerks around. What a dislikable bunch of moochers, decked out in their polyester WKRP in Cincinnati best just to go on a free boat trip and get some free food and booze (where did the caterers disappear to?). Lecherous Larry is the worst, but even the old people (“All we wanted was to have an easy life”) got on my nerves.\n\n*. But just to stick with the oldies for a moment, I have to wonder what happened to them. Not this old couple in particular, but old people in movies of this sort. In disaster movies of the ’70s you often had token old people showing up, giving work to aging stars. Think of their appearance in films like Airport or Towering Inferno. Audiences seemed to like seeing favourite old stars in new settings. But after that they sort of disappeared. The only people you see in disaster movies nowadays are young adults or kids. I assume this is mainly the result of the audience for movies permanently settling in the 16-24 year-old age demographic during this same period. Nobody wants anything to do with old people anymore, even in movies where they’re running away from monsters.\n\n*. Like a lot of bad SF movies the vision is let down by a low budget. But Gordon certainly had a lot of ideas for this one and to his credit he doesn’t stint on getting as much ant action as he can on screen. Sure it looks silly and unconvincing, but he was trying. What’s more, the pheromone booth is inspired and he got good production value out of that sugar refinery. Best of all, it zips along quickly, and even the parts without the ants are funny in their evocation of mid-’70s moral squalor and crimes of fashion. Go to the ant then! Consider its ways and be wise."
