        "text": "Lost Reels launches a series of classics, curios and forgotten gems on 16mm with the inspired pairing of Ray Harryhausen’s golden age stop-motion sci-fi / horror masterpiece and Bert I. Gordon’s unintentionally hilarious cult classic.\n\nLaunching a series of classics, curios and forgotten gems on 16mm, Lost Reels presents Monsters Attack! a double bill of sci-fi/horror monster features. The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953) is a bone fide classic, responsible for a whole 1950s sub-genre of radiation-magnified monsters and malevolent aliens from outer space. It continues to engage audiences with its swift pace, economic run-time, and the frequent appearances of Ray Harryhausen’s brilliant stop-motion monster. In comparison, Empire of the Ants (1977) is best remembered as a testament to genre resilience. In the mid-70s all writer/director Bert I. Gordon needed was a Florida swamp, a group of soap opera actors, and a reworking of Them! (1954) to deliver a commercially successful monster feature. Frequently laughable the film has an undeniable camp value, and the sight of Joan Collins valiantly staying in character while being dumped into a muddy river and squaring off against poorly superimposed ants is unmissable.\n\nTo celebrate this inaugural Lost Reels event all ticket holders will be entered into a free raffle for an original vintage UK quad poster of Empire of the Ants by legendary poster artist Brian Bysouth:\n\nThe Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953), directed by Eugène Lourié, visual effects by Ray Harryhausen. Run time: 80 minutes.\n\nHaving served his apprenticeship as King Kong (1933) animator, Willis O’Brien’s assistant on Mighty Joe Young (1949), Ray Harryhausen’s first solo effort was The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, produced by Warner Brothers and based on a short story by his friend science fiction writer Ray Bradbury. The film was a huge success and is largely responsible for a whole sub-genre of monster-on-the-loose films. The role of military authority figures, and the trope of the aging scientist and his brainy attractive daughter were replicated in Them! the following year and many other 1950s sci-fi/horror films including Harryhausen’s follow-up, It Came from Beneath the Sea (1955). What makes Beast most remarkable is the creature itself and how Harryhausen imbues it with a real personality, even pathos. Scenes such as the lighthouse attack are beautifully conceived and staged, and the New York City rampage and amusement park climax are high water marks for the stop motion technique even today. Among the capable and pleasant B-movie cast keep an eye out for a young Lee Van Cleef in a small role as a police marksman during the fiery rollercoaster climax.\n\n16mm print courtesy of Lost Reels.\n\nEmpire of the Ants (1977), directed by Bert I. Gordon. Run time: 89 minutes.\n\nH.G. Wells wrote a story called Empire of the Ants but it bears little resemblance to this tale of a devious estate agent (Joan Collins) trying to sell dodgy condos to an unsuspecting tour group prior to an attack by giant ants. Starting with a classic disaster movie set up (unlikeable characters assemble so the audience can decide who to root for when the killings begin) it becomes a prototype for Jurassic Park (1993), when the condo tour goes horribly wrong. As the ants attack to faux-Jaws (1975) music and Them! sound effects, scenes include an elderly couple leaving the relative safety of the group for a flimsy outdoor cabin, “We’ll be safe in there” they say (guess what happens), and as marauding ants close off escape routes for another group, one of them screams, “They’re herding us like CATTLE!” The hilariously inept special effects only add to the film’s appeal (they actually look better in 16mm than higher definition formats) and the cast heroically play it straight even when ‘fighting’ thin air overlayed with badly superimposed ant footage or unconvincing ant puppets. A ludicrous third act twist reinvigorates the film just as it threatens to drag, cementing the film’s status as an accidental cult classic. The final scene featuring the beleaguered survivors is priceless.\n\n16mm print courtesy of Lost Reels. This vintage print has intermittent scratches and lines during the first 40 minutes.\n\nLost Reels is an independent film organisation dedicated to bringing forgotten, lost, or unavailable films back to UK cinemas. The 16mm series celebrates the modest and enduring 16mm format by screening classics, curios, and forgotten gems, mostly as double bills. Events consist of a well-known title paired with something more unusual, obscure, or even radical. The goal is to make each programme feel inspired. Visit Lost Reels at lostreels.co.uk and follow on Twitter and Instagram at @lostreelsuk.\n\nDoors open at 17.00, for a 18.00 start. Each film will be preceded by an introduction and the event will close with the poster raffle around 21.30.\n\nRefreshments will be available in our licensed cafe/bar.\n\nTICKETS & PRICING\n\nTickets £14 in advance or on the door."
