Formerly sitting near the present JFK Center in Washington, DC, the statue was moved as a result of I-66 construction. Finally in 1961, the statute came home to Salem, Illinois, and following an act of Congress in 1975, the statue ownership was officially given to the City.\n\nPhoto by Duane Hall, HMDB.org"
