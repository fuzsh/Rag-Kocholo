Cause of death was maybe rabies or an appenditis. He was buried about 8 June 1881 in Sullivan County, Missouri. Birth, marriage, and death data is from the personal family records of Ivah Bessie Peters.\n\nA number of careful researchers believe that Silas Peters who married Anna Powell was the son of James Henry Peters and Nancy Peters of Virginia. James and Nancy were cousins who married. For example, it is listed that way in \"Historical Account of the Peters Family\" compiled by June Louise (Shaull) Lutz in 1886. I believe that the following settles the issue in favor of Silas being the son of Tobias Peters and Elizabeth Scarborough of Anderson County, TN. (RGB)\n\n\"Silas Peters and Anna Peters to John Key dated June 1, 1839\n\nThis indenture made and entered into this 1st June 1839 between Silas Peters\n\n& Anna Peters his wife of State of Missouri and County of Lafayett of the\n\none part they being legatees of Tobias Peters deceased and John Key of the\n\nstate of Tennessee and County of Anderson of the other part witnesseth that\n\nthe said Silas Peters & Anna his wife for and in consideration of the sum of\n\nTwenty One Dollars to him in hand paid the receipt whereof is hereby\n\nacknowledged hath bargained and sold and by these presents bargain, sell and\n\nconvey unto the said John Key his heirs and assigns all their right, Title,\n\nClaim, interest and demand in and to a certain tract or parcel of undivided\n\nland it being the real estate of Tobias Peters deceased, situated in the\n\ncounty of Tennessee beginning on Youngs line on the Black Oak Ridge and\n\nrunning with what was formerly John Bounds line but now William Tunnells to\n\nthe back line of Youngs survey thence with said survey to John Tunnels line\n\nthence with Johns line to his corner on the North side of the Black Oak\n\nRidge thence with said Tunnells 2 tracts of land containing 200 acres be the\n\nsame mor or less.

Silas Peters (Seal)\\\n\nAnna (Her mark) Peters (Seal)\n\nState of Missouri, County of Lafayett\n\nBe it remembered that at a term of the county court began and held at the\n\ncourthouse in the town of Lexington in the county and state aforesaid on the\n\n12th day of August 1839 on the 3rd day of said tem appeared Silas Peters &\n\nAnna Peters whose names appear on the forgoing deed of conveyance to John\n\nKey in open court they being personally know to one of the member of said\n\ncourt to be the persons whose names are subscribed to said instrument as a\n\nparty thereto and acknowled the same to be their act and deed for the\n\npurposes there in mentioned the said Anna Peters being first made acquainted\n\nwith the contents of said deed by the court and upon examination separate\n\nand apart from her said husband acknowledged that she executed said deed &\n\nrelinquished her right of dower to the real estate there mentioned\n\nvoluntarily freely and without compulsion or under influence of her said\n\nhusband.\n\nIn Testimony whereof I Henderson Young, Clerk of said court herein set my\n\nhand and affix the seal of said court this 14th day of August 1839.\n\nH. Young, Clerk by Wm. Spratt, D. C.\n\nThe following was written by Nada Pendergraft, sent to me by Joan McKinney.\n\nSilas was quite a hunter and trapper. He had a very large smoke house and often killed as many as 5O hogs during the winter, and hung the meat in this smokehouse. He would also have barrels of kraut, pickles, and sorghum. They dried apples, and the pumpkins were cut in rings and were hung on broomsticks and poles to dry. His house was quite a social center for the whole community, and they often had as many as 50 or 60 visitors on Sunday.\n\nSilas went to California during the big gold rush in 1852 and brought back a considerable sum of cold with which he bought 600 acres of land and built the big new frame house upon it. He was a great walker, thinking nothing of a 25 mile trip in one day. He was traveling horseback to California and ran out of water on the desert. His horse was so starved for water that it fought Silas, and he had to leave it and go on afoot. When he was nearly dead from thirst he came to a camp of friendly Indians, and they gave him water, only a teaspoonful at a time until he was able to drink more.\n\n(Note: Silas was enumerated both in Missouri and in California in 1850. I believe he must have traveled first to California in 1849 or 1850, rather than in 1852 as reported by Nada Pendergraft. RGB)\n\nThe following was also sent to me by Joan McKinney.\n\nIn a clipping from \"The Kansas City Star\" about 1935 was a whole page telling of a trip to the gold fields, of about 25 young men from around Independence, Mo. The leader was Bennett C. Clark, who had been Clerk of the County Court for 1840-1849. On April 11, 1849, Clark and 25 other young men met at Maston's bridge on the western edge of Werner and waited for a couple of friends. The first days drive took the Caravan to Indian Creek. They were breaking their mules gradually to the hardships of the trail, and ten miles of Missouri mud was enough for one day. That was May 3, 10 days later they picked up a Judge Story of Saline Co., Mo., and two voyagers and eight persons from Ohio. They had a hard time getting up the slippery banks of the Waukarusha Creek near Lawrence, Kansas, and ferried across the Kaw River near Le Compton, Kansas. Clark was Captain of the wagon train, his Diary was treasured by his late grandson Dr. B. Clark Hyde of Lexington, Mo. They kept up their spirits on the trip by \"Gearing\" at each other when the going was tough. June 12, they were in Wyoming, their mules were thin and the grass was short and it was raining. They reached South Pass June 24, 1849. They passed Fort Hall, Idaho, and found mosquitoes unbelievably large and blood thirsty. They found no gold at Goose Creek where the Mormons had found gold, but enjoyed very fine trout. On July 18,1849, Newton C. Peters (\"Brother of our Silas\") and Clark with Wm. T. Cole pressed on ahead of the rest to reach Sutton' s Fort and arrange for provisions. They were encouraged by the grass that looked like clover, blue grass and Timothy. But Sutters or Suttons Fort was leagues away and the wolves howled late at night. July 26 the wolves came too close to the wagon. July 27, they came with a company from Virginia, and listened to the negroes sing. The heat was terrible in the afternoons and they traveled by moonlight half of the night. There was 65 miles of dust, sand, and alkali, and bones of oxen, men and mules. They made the trip in three days. There was no grass and they found puddles of water that they mixed with flour to feed the mules. Truckee River looked like Paradise. The Diary ends August first with them in western Nevada. Clark was ill here, and friends took him to San Francisco. He returned to Missouri by ways of Panama, New Orleans, and St. Louis. Clark went back to Clerk of Court, and died an old man of many years. He had a long white beard, and was highly honored at Boonville when aged 71.\n\nSilas Peters and Anna Powell were married on 21 February 1839 in Odessa, Lafayette, Missouri. Anna Powell12,29,30, daughter of Richard Powell and Rachel James/Jeems, was born on 15 May 1821 in near Lexington, Lafayette County, Missouri. She appeared in the census in 1840 in Lafayette County, Missouri. Age 15-19, enumerated with her husband Silas Peters. She appeared in the census in 1850 in Sullivan County, Missouri.
