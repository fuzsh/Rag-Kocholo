        "text": "Glenn Copple (1888 – 1965) was appointed Deputy to Yuma County (Arizona) District Attorney Henry C. Kelly.\n\nGlenn was born in Nov 1888 in Centralia, Illinois to Silas Bryan & Julia (Roper) Copple, who married in 1884. He was their second son. Silas Bryan Copple’s paternal great-grandparents were Jacob [Peter] Copple and [Mary] Elizabeth Garren [Pfoutz?], who are my 6th great-grandparents.\n\nGlenn was in the military from Aug 1917 to July 1919, and after arriving home back in Centralia, was a lawyer. He moved to Yuma, Arizona prior to January 1925, which is when he became the assistant District Attorney.\n\nHe married Janet Anne Burnell in 1934 in Phoenix, Maricopa County, and they had a son Gordon Burnell in April 1936 in Los Angeles County, California. The family was back in Yuma County, Arizona as of the 1940 census. Glenn died in Oct 1965, presumably in Arizona, but is buried in San Diego County, California. His widow died in 1982, and his son Gordon died in 1987 at the age of 51.\n\nGlenn was my 3rd cousin 4 times removed.\n\n“Attorney Glen Copple is Named,” The Morning Sun (Yuma, Arizona), 2 Jan 1925, pg 1, col 6; Newspapers.com (https://www.newspapers.com : accessed 13 January 2020).\n\nThis newspaper clipping appears to be about the estate of the late Samuel Copple (c 1824 – c 1852) of Marion County, Illinois. Samuel was one of at least 11 children born to David [Allen] Copple & Lavina Huckleberry who resided in Marion County, IL late in their lives. David was likely the son of Jacob [Peter] Copple and [Mary] Elizabeth Garren (or Pfouts), and thus would have been a brother to my own ancestor Philip (c 1784 – 1850).\n\nSamuel was born in Washington County, Indiana circa 1824. Washington County, Indiana was the original destination for my Copple and Wright families; they arrived in the area circa 1809, purchasing land there before moving from Wayne County, Kentucky (their first stop after leaving the Rowan County, North Carolina area).\n\nJudging from the 1830 and 1840 census records, and the land patent images available at BLM’s online site, it appears the Copple family moved to Illinois when Samuel was about 15 years old, stopping in the Jefferson/Marion County area. (Both counties are adjacent to each other, Marion having been created from part of Jefferson in 1823.) [1]\n\nSam married Maria Railey in January 1847; they had 2 daughters: Ellen and Sarah. Sam died at about the age of 28, and his widow married Abner Faulkner within a fairly short time.\n\nEli Copple is listed as the Administrator of Sam’s estate; Sam had an older brother Eli, who also lived in Marion County, Illinois.\n\n“Administrator’s Notice,” Salem Weekly Advocate (Salem, Illinois), 25 Mar 1852, pg 3, col 7; Newspapers.com (https://www.newspapers.com : accessed 20 September 2019).\n\n[1] “Marion County, Illinois,” Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Marion_County,_Illinois : accessed 24 October 2019).\n\nGrant Milton Copple was likely my 4th cousin 3 times removed. He was the son of William Linton Copple and Lenora (Stough) Copple, both Iowa natives.\n\nLaura Olive Shay was the daughter of Harry Shay, a native of England, and Olive Hill, a native of Rock County, Illinois.\n\nSadly, their marriage lasted only 7-1/2 years, ending with Laura’s death at the age of approximately 27 years. She was survived by her husband Grant, and by their three young children.\n\n“Shay – Copple,” The Daily Times (Davenport, Iowa), 20 Jul 1920, pg 17, col 5;\n\nNewspapers.com (https://www.newspapers.com : accessed 20 September 2019).\n\nMy second cousin 5 times removed, Sam Copple, a native of Jefferson County, Illinois, was born in July 1837 to William and Abigail (Handley) Copple. Sam’s paternal grandparents, John and Catherine Copple, were first cousins to each other.\n\nSam served in the Civil War for 3 years as a part of the 11th Illinois Volunteer Infantry. It was during this time he wrote the editorial below.\n\nI had never heard the term “Copperhead” as it relates to the Civil War. According to the online Encyclopedia Britannica, was a pejorative term for Northerners who wanted to negotiate a settlement with the South rather than fight a war to preserve the Union.[1]\n\n“Letter from the 11th Ill. Reg.,” Centralia Sentinel (Centralia, Illinois), 20 Aug 1863, pg 2, col 4; Newspapers.com (https://www.newspapers.com : accessed 12 December 2013)\n\n[1] “Copperhead – American Political Faction”, Encyclopedia Brittanica (https://www.britannica.com/topic/Copperhead-American-political-faction : accessed 24 Sep 2019).\n\nCite/link to this post: Cathy M.
