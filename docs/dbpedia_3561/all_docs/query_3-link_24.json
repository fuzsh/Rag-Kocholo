        "text": "HISTORY NEBRASKA MANUSCRIPT FINDING AID\n\nRG2952.AM: Mary Elizabeth (Bryan) Allen, 1872-1962\n\nPapers: 1920-1962\n\nLincoln, Lancaster County, Neb.: Genealogist\n\nSize: 2.0 cu.ft.\n\nBACKGROUND NOTE\n\nThe precise date of the arrival of the first Bryan from Ireland remains unknown, but it was before the Revolutionary War. The family has been traced back to 927 A.D. in Ireland, and about 1600 in America. Silas Lillard was born in Virginia at the original Bryan home in America. He was married to Mariah Elizabeth Jennings on his 30th birthday at Walnut Hill, Illinois. He served for 8 years in the Illinois Senate and a 6 year term in the Circuit Court at Salem. Three children, Virginia, John, and Hiram died in infancy. William Jennings Bryan was the fourth eldest living son born March 19, 1860, then Charles Wayland (former Governor of Nebraska, 1923-1925 and 1930-1935), born in 1867, three others and the youngest, Mary Elizabeth born in 1872, were born in Salem, Illinois.\n\nMary Elizabeth received her early schooling in Salem and later attended the University of Nebraska. On June 28, 1898 she was married to Thomas Stinson Allen (U.S. District Attorney for Nebraska, 1915-1921, and a prominent Lincoln attorney), and moved to Lincoln where she lived until her death on April 25, 1962. She was the last relative of William Jennings and Charles Wayland Bryan living in Nebraska. She was survived by a nephew, William Jennings Bryan, Jr., of Laguna Beach, California.\n\nFor a more complete account of the Silas Lillard and Bryan family in America, see the Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society, Volume 42, 1949, pp. 57-79.\n\nSCOPE AND CONTENT NOTE\n\nThis collection consists of 3 boxes of manuscript material and oversize material arranged in two series: 1) Genealogical Data and 2) Printed Material and Clippings. The bulk of the material relates to the efforts of Mrs. Allen to collect genealogical information about the Bryan and related families. Also included are clippings about her, her father, and her husband.\n\nNote: For photographs, see the photo component [RG2952.PH].\n\nINVENTORY\n\nSeries 1 – Genealogical Data, 1920-1942\n\nBox 1\n\nFolder\n\nBryan family correspondence\n\nJennings family correspondence\n\nLillard family correspondence\n\nDavidson, Logan, McClure families correspondence\n\nFreeman family correspondence\n\nWoods family correspondence\n\nAllen family correspondence\n\nMiscellaneous correspondence\n\nBox 2 (Notes and Notebooks)\n\nFolder\n\nBryan-Lewis Families\n\nBryan Family\n\nBryan (Maryland Branch)\n\nBryan (Biographies)\n\nBryan (Virginia marriages)\n\nBryan-Boone-Lillard\n\nBryan-Lillard\n\nBryan-Lillard-Jennings\n\nBryan-Asher-Jennings\n\nBryan-Lillard\n\nJennings Family\n\nJennings Family\n\nJennings Family\n\nFreeman Family\n\nWoods Family\n\nDavidson-Logan-McClure\n\nDavidson\n\nLillard Family\n\nLogan\n\nRelated Families: Von Puhl, Barbour, Bland and Randolph\n\nBox 3\n\nFolder\n\nNotes on Family History\n\nChart of Bryan Family to Mary E.
