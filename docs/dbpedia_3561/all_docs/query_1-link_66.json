        "text": "Kyle are you from this Hilliard family?\n\nYou got some of it right but there is more. I know I read about Nash Co., NC somewhere but I'll have to look that up again.So not real sure about that.. But here's the rest of what I know to be true, since my family line comes from 3 of Silas' children.\n\nSilas Hilliard was born in NC in 1770 and died in Waresboro, GA and burial was at Kettle Creek, Church, GA.\n\nNote:\n\nHistory of Ware County, Georgia by Laura S. Walker\n\nPublished 1934 Macon, Ga. by The J. W. Burke Co. Publishers\n\nNote For History of Ware County:\n\nSilas Hilliard came to Georgia from North Carolina.\n\nSilas and Abegail Hilliard probably had at least two other daughters. Mr. and Mrs. Hilliard lived successively in Screven, Bulloch and Bryan County,Ga. before moving to Ware County, Ga. in 1827. He served in Capt. James A. Sweat's company of Ware County Militia, 1838-39, in the Indian War.\n\nMr. Hilliard lived with his grandson, Capt. Cuyler W. Hilliard, until his death.\n\nChildren\n\n1. Nancy HILLIARD b: 1797 born in Bulloch County, Ga., a daughter of Silas Hilliard. (This is my grandparent on my grandmother's side.. She marries Joseph Underhill--His son William was my grandmother's grandparent..)\n\n2. Thomas HILLIARD b: 6 JUN 1805 in Ware GA. (his son Cuyler has a son named Thomas who is my grandparent on my grandfather's side)\n\nI believe Nancy & Thomas to have the same mother.. maybe it is the same mother.I even found an account where Thomas was born 1806.. And I wondered if his mother died during child birth .. and then he marries Abegail in 1806 to help take care of the kids...that's guessing..\n\n-----------\n\n3. James HILLIARD b: 1810 (Married Nancy Register..They have 9 children that I know of.. and one he names after his father Silas..who later moves to TX)\n\n4. Anna E. HILLIARD b: 19 MAR 1815 in GA. (Anna marries Thomas Hilliard {Cuyler's son}so Anna is also my grandfather's grandparent)\n\n5. Benjamin HILLIARD b: 1817 (not sure who he married)\n\n-------------\n\nNow if you read the above about Silas living successively in Screven, Bulloch and Bryan County,Ga. before moving to Ware County, Ga. in 1827. Now I can't explain how he showed up on so many census reports.. but he was defiantly in Screven and Bulloch Co., GA during the census reports you say are the other Silas.. at least according the the notes made from the Ware Co. History, published in 1934.Also is it possible that if you owned land in several counties, which he might have, that you have to register with the census in those counties?? Guessing again.Not sure.\n\nIf I could find a brother or sister of Silas and track down his parents, I could probably sort this all out.\n\nI have one living relative of my grandfather who is 83..his sister.. And I will try to find out more family history.If I find out the parents I will let you know."
