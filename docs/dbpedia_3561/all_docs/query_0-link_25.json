        "text": "History of the Culpeper Minute Men Battalion 1775\n\nAt the Virginia convention held May 1775, in Richmond, the Colony of Virginia was divided into 16 districts and each district instructed to raise and discipline a battalion of men \"to march at a minute's notice.\"\n\nCulpeper, Fauquier and Orange counties, forming one district, raised a cadre of 350 men, 150 men from Culpeper, 100 from Orange and 100 from Fauquier, called the Culpeper Minute Men. Organized July 17, 1775, under a large oak tree in \"Clayton's old field\" (later known as Catalpa Farm).\n\nThe Committee of Safety commissioned Lawrence Taliafero, of Orange, to be the Colonel; Edward Stevens, of Culpeper, to be the Lieutenant Colonel; and Thomas Marshall of Fauquier to be the Major of this Battalion. They also commissioned ten Captains for the Companies which were to make up the Battalion, among them were: John Jamieson, then Clerk of Culpeper County and a member of the Committee of Safety; Philip Clayton; James Slaughter; George Slaughter; and Capt. McClanahan, A Baptist minister, who regularly preached to his troops. (It was the custom then to put all the Baptists in one Company, for they were among the most strenous supporters of liberty, The Methodists went into another, according to the wishes of the Committee of Safety which recommended that the different religious denominations each organize companies of their own kind.)\n\nThey adopted uniforms consisting of hunting shirts of strong, brown lines, dyed with an extract of the leaves of trees (probably the broad of oak leaves). On the breast of each shirt was worked in large white letters the words: \"LIBERTY OR DEATH.\" (A wag of the times said that this was too severe for him, but that he would enlist if they could change the motto to \"Liberty or be Crippled.\"\n\nTheir flag had a rattlesnake with 13 rattles, coiled in the center, read to strike. Underneath it were the words: \"DON'T TREAD ON ME.\" On either side were the words: \"LIBERTY OR DEATH.\" And at the top \"THE CULPEPER MINUTE MEN.\" The Minute Men took part in the Battle of Great Bridge, the first Revolutionary battle on Virginia soil.\n\nNo sooner were they formed than the companies of Culpeper Minute Men were absorbed into regiments of the Continental Line, and by Act of Assembly in October 1776, they were dissolved and merged into the militia.\n\nSeveral original Culpeper Minute Men were sufferers at Valley Forge.\n\nThe Culpeper Minute Battalion\n\n19 August 1775-17 December 1776\n\nThird Virginia Convention passed an ordinance on 19 August 17751 that grouped counties into military districts, mandated the districts to raise minute battalions, and also raise a company of regulars. The counties of Orange, Fauquier, and Culpeper were grouped together and required to raise a minute battalion of 10 companies of 50 men each. The regulars were to be a rifle company.2\n\nOfficers were appointed by the newly formed Committee of Safety for the District. Lawrence Talifferro of Orange County was appointed colonel, Edward Stevens of Culpeper was appointed lieutenant colonel, and Thomas Marshall of Fauquier major. In proportion to the population of the counties, four minute companies were to come from each of Fauquier and Culpeper, and two from Orange.\n\nAt the beginning of September recruiting for all of the companies, including the company of regulars, was under way. Although company of regulars and the minute companies began their existence together with the meeting of the district committee of safety, they very soon parted ways. Regular companies were to rendezvous at Williamsburg whereas minute companies were to rendezvous at a location set the by the District Committee of Safety, in this case, at the town of Culpeper. Records of the Committee of Safety for 18 September 1775 show the regulars under Capt. John Green drawing 15 rifles3, an indication that they were already in Williamsburg. Indeed, of all of the regular companies in Virginia, Green’s was the first to arrive in Williamsburg and pass inspection. He became the senior captain of the Virginia Continental Line and his company assigned to the First Virginia Regiment on October 21st.\n\nThe Culpeper Minute Battalion was reported within a few hours march of Williamsburg by Purdie’s Virginia Gazette reported on October 20th and on October 23rd the captains of the Culpeper Minute Battalion were definitely in Williamsburg starting to draw equipment.4 However, there were weapons for only half the Battalion. On October 24th, five companies of the Culpeper Minute Battalion were ordered to Norfolk with the Second Virginia Battalion under Col. William Woodford.\n\nThe next day the Committee of Safety received word that British ships are at Hampton threatening the town. Col. Woodford took a company of regulars and 50 minutemen armed with rifles under Capt. Abraham Buford to defend the town. Because the minute companies were armed with both muskets and rifles, volunteer riflemen from other companies of the Battalion replaced some of Buford’s own men who were not equipped with rifles. Buford’s men were stationed in a house and at a breastwork that had been constructed. Their accurate rifle fire soon had an effect. The sailors were unable to man their guns except where protected by netting. A British pilot boat, the Hawk Tender, was captured. The British lost 2 killed, 3 wounded, and 8 captured. 5\n\nBy the end of the first week of November it was clear that half the Culpeper Minute Battalion could not be equipped. On November 8th The Committee of Safety ordered the Commander-in-Chief of the Virginia forces, Col. Patrick Henry, to discharge the remainder of the Culpeper Minute Battalion from duty at Headquarters. 6 The married men were discharged and single men joined other companies. 7 Col. Taliaferro led half the Battalion home while Lt. Col. Stevens remained to lead five companies to Norfolk under Col. Woodford of the 2nd Virginia. The companies discharged were those of\n\nCapt. William McClanahan, Culpeper Capt. William Blackwell, Fauquier\n\nCapt. John Williams, Culpeper Capt. James Scott, Fauquier\n\nCapt. William Payne, Orange\n\nThe companies remaining in service were those of\n\nCapt. Abraham Buford, Culpeper Capt. John Chilton, Fauquier\n\nCapt. John Jameson, Culpeper Capt. William Pickett, Fauquier\n\nCapt. Joseph Spencer, Orange\n\nBy November 15th Woodford’s troops were equipped and on the march.\n\nThe land route from Williamsburg to Norfolk had a critical choke point at Great Bridge on the south branch of the Elizabeth River. Governor Dunmore erected a fort here to block Woodford’s approach. Governor Dunmore ordered Capt. Charles Fordyce to attack early in the morning of the 9th.8 The choke point now worked against the British. Fordyce commanded about 120 men, but they could advance only six abreast across the causeway. Most of the defenders held their fire until the British were within 50 yards of the lines. The British were staggered by the volleys that followed. Fordyce was killed with over 14 bullets in his body. The British retreated. Col. Edward Stevens led men of the Culpeper Minute Battalion over open ground in the action. The only American casualty was a Fauquier County private in Capt. William Pickett’s Co., Benjamin Arnold. He was wounded in the wrist. British casualties are more difficult to determine. The British did manage to drag off the bodies of a number of their dead. Col. Woodford initially reported the British casualties at 12 killed and 17 wounded who had been captured, but reported the next day that the British casualties were much higher.9 Leven Powell wrote that the total number of British casualties 102.10 Whatever the number, it was large enough that Dunmore could no longer hold the choke point at Great Bridge. Dunmore retreated to his ships and the fall of Norfolk to Woodford was inevitable. Although it would not be until 9 July 1776 that Dunmore finally was forced from Gwynn’s Island, the British had lost Virginia.\n\nWoodford quickly moved to Norfolk and intermittent fighting occurred between the American forces on land and the British forces on ship. On January 1st the British landed soldiers who set fire to Norfolk. Virginia troops burned most of the remaining houses.11 On January 2nd some of the Battalion was discharged to return home. Two of Capt. Buford’s men were killed on January 21st by a cannonball.12 The balance of the regiment was sent home in late March. Capt. William Pickett’s Company from Fauquier were paid through April 2nd, 1776.13\n\nThe Council of the State of Virginia called two battalions of minute men into service on August 10th, 1776. Unlike the order of 1775, the call was made for companies from six different districts. Culpeper was required to provide two companies.14 One was a company commanded by Capt. James Nash and was in service at least from August 19th to August 22nd.15 The other company appears to have been under Capt. Abraham Buford. 16 The men were stationed near Jamestown, where many of the men became sick and some died. 17 The last date of documented active service for the Culpeper Minute Battalion was when Lt. Elijah Kirtley drew rations and forage from October 3rd to November 20th, 1776. 18\n\nMinute battalions throughout the state lost officers and men to the newly forming continental regiments as well as the Virginia State Line in 1776. On 17 December 1776 the House of Delegates passed an ordinance abolishing the minute battalions. 19\n\nAlthough in existence for only about a year and a quarter, the Culpeper Minute Battalion had a major impact on the American Revolution. It was involved in engagements at Hampton, Great Bridge, and Norfolk and did garrison duty at Jamestown. The engagement at Great Bridge was a strategic victory making it inevitable that Lord Dunmore would have to abandon Virginia. Virginia was free to provide critical troops and provisions both to the North and South until 1781, when the enemy returned to Virginia. Without this support from Virginia, the outcome of both northern and southern battles of the Revolution could have been very different.\n\n1 Scribner, Robert L. and Brent Tarter: Revolutionary Virginia: The Road to Independence, Vol. III, Virginia Independence Bicentennial Commission and University of Virginia Press, Charlottesville, 1977, p. 466.\n\n2 Hening, William Waller, Statutes at Large, Vol. 9, Richmond, 1821, pp. 9-34.\n\n3 Scribner, Robert L. and Brent Tarter: Revolutionary Virginia: The Road to Independence, Vol. IV, Virginia Independence Bicentennial Commission and University of Virginia Press, Charlottesville, 1978, p. 123.\n\n4 Ibid., p. 263.\n\n5 John Page to Thomas Jefferson, 11 Nov. 1775, in Boyd, Julian P.
