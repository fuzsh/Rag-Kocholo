Thomas Bryan b: 1735\n\n--------At this point Martha Strode was 44 years of age.\n\n Information: 1684, Llanelwedd, Builth Wells, , Brecon, Wales. Morgan received his education at the English School at Brussels, the same as his father; however, we found no evidence this Morgan was educated as a mariner.\n\nThe years of mysteries concerning parents of this man should never have occurred. He was purportedly born in Sweden to an Irishman who landed in Virginia in 1650 with his parents, who then removed to Sweden, married, and had a son born in Sweden. Then the man and his wife removed to Ireland where he spent the remainder of his life attempting to restore the family power and authority. Somehow, after his father died 1694 in Ireland, this man purportedly landed in Pennsylvania, married there, and then migrated south to Virginia. Hopefully, the mysteries will someday disappear.\n\nStrangely, if Morgan Bryan was the son of Francis Bryan as purported, why did he not name a son, Francis Bryan? During our research there were no males named Francis among Morgan and Martha's children. The given name Morgan is unique to four Bryan males, all of them descending from William in four direct generations, Morgan-to-Morgan; Morgan-to-Morgan, and Morgan-to-Morgan, and the name Morgan appears in the descendant lines of Cornelius Bryan (O'Bryan).\n\nSince publication of the two books Boone Volume I, and Boone Volume II we have expended considerable effort to prove where Morgan Bryan was born, and stand on the location of his mother and her parents in Wales. Denmark has excellent birth records beginning 1620-1650, and other than the nine children of Capt. William Morgan and his second wife, we found no other Bryan or variant spellings thereto until mid 1750. We checked Denmark for any record of a Francis Bryan there 1600 to 1700 with no proof located. We do not believe the birth year of 1671 is even reasonable for this Morgan Bryan in that, if he did not marry Martha Strode until 1719 as is purported by Bryan Family Researchers, he would have been aged 48 years old, which would not be at all common during the era of concern.\n\nPerhaps of even greater significance, in following the descendants of Morgan Bryan and Martha Strode, we have yet to prove one male descendant named Francis Bryan....\n\n Virginia Land Grant: 3 Oct 1734, Orange County, Virginia.

PETER'S Episcopal Church here is preparing to celebrate its 302d year. It is the oldest Episcopal parish in New Jersey, dating from 1685, or nearly a century before the nation was born.\n\nAlthough an official state publication, ''Fifty New Jersey Firsts,'' calls St. Peter's the oldest Episcopal parish in America, the Rev. J. Rodney Croes, the rector, is not ready to lay claim to that distinction.\n\n''It is a matter of dispute,'' he said, ''and three other Episcopal parishes may be older than ours. For me, it is honor enough to be the oldest parish in New Jersey, and that is a claim no one disputes.''\n\nSt. Peter's traces its origins to the first prayer assembly of a group of 12 Church of England communicants who designated themselves the Congregation of St. Peter's Episcopal Church.\n\nSoon after their meeting, they set about erecting a church, using the foundation of an abandoned courthouse. The site is not far from the bluff overlooking Raritan Bay where St. Peter's stands today.\n\nTwo other edifices followed the first, the third being the brick-and-mortar American Gothic house of worship that shelters the flock today.\n\nIn 1706, Queen Anne presented the parish with a set of handwrought communion silver - it is still in use - and in 1718 King George I granted St. Peter's its official charter.\n\nThe most serious threat to the church occurred around 1770, when the area surrounding New Perth, as the city was then called, was ravaged by smallpox. Fatalities reduced the number of parishioners to fewer than 100 and forced Gov. William Franklin to evacuate the city, then the state capital, for Trenton.\n\nThe Governor, incidentally, was a son of Benjamin Franklin and a vestryman of St. Peter's. He was arrested by Gen. George Washington in 1776 for having served as Governor for the British.\n\nDuring the Revolution, St. Peter's was commandeered, alternately, by British and American troops. They ransacked its interior, converting it into a barracks and stable; burned pews and floor boards for firewood and ripped up gravestones for tabletops and ovens.\n\nEvidence of gunfire can still be seen in damaged gravestones in the burial ground around St. Peter's.\n\nBoth church and cemetery are listed in the National Register of Historic Places, a compilation of the United States Department of the Interior.\n\n''But we're not merely an historical relic,'' said Father Croes. ''Our history is rich, but the history we write today is equally important.\n\n''We'll mark our anniversary with a visitation by the Bishop of New Jersey in June, but we're not making a gigantic thing of it.\n\n''More important to us are the social outreach programs we conduct on a daily basis for the elderly, for drug addicts, for alcoholics and for inner-city kids, whom we get out onto the waters of Raritan Bay each summer through a sailing program.\n\n''It gets them off the streets, motivates them to do better in school and opens them up to the beauties of God's great outdoors.''\n\nThe ethnic character of St. Peter's parish has changed dramatically over the centuries, along with that of Perth Amboy itself. Today, 35 percent of the parish's 500 active members (and 1,000 inactive) are black and there are several interracial couples.\n\nThe first black man to vote in America, Thomas Mundy Peterson, was a member of St. Peter's and is buried in its graveyard. He voted in the Perth Amboy mayoral election of March 31, 1870, one day after adoption of the 15th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\n''We are probably one of the best-integrated parishes in the diocese,'' said Father Croes.\n\n''There is a tremendous potential in the urban challenge - the challenge of racial harmony, housing for the poor, environmental detoxification, etcetera. And we're ready for it.\n\n''Our parish motto is: 'Nothing is hopeless.' ''\n\n---------------\n\nPerth Amboy Township was formed on October 31, 1693, and was enlarged during the 1720s to encompass Perth Amboy city. Perth Amboy served as the colonial capital from 1686 until 1776.

William and his son John were killed by Native Americans at the Falls of a river, and the falls were named after the Linville family.\n\n---------------\n\n\"Two men named Linville from the forks of the Yadkin went to hunt on the Watauga River between 1760 and 1770. They employed John Williams, a lad of sixteen, to go with them, keep camp and cook for them. They were sleeping in the camp when the Indians came on them and killed the Linvilles. They \"shot Williams through the thigh,\" but he escaped and rode a horse from the mouth of the Watauga \"Hollows in Surry\" in five days. He recovered from his wound and became a man of influence.\n\nIt is now almost certain that these falls have taken their name from these two men, who may have visited them before their last hunt and told the people of their location and beauty, for Dr. Draper (note, p. 183) records that the stream itself was named from the fact that in the \"latter part of the summer of 1766 William Linville, his son and a young man had gone from the lower Yadkin to this river to hunt, where they were surprised by a party of Indians, the two Linvilles killed, the other person, though badly wounded, effecting his escape.\n\nThe Linvilles were related to the famous Daniel Boone.\n\n\" It is a matter of record that a family by the name of Linvil---probably an economic way of spelling Linville---were members of Three Forks Baptist Church and lived on what is now known as Dog Skin Creek, or branch, but which stream used to be called Linville Creek. The membership of that church shows that Abraham, Catharine and Margaret Linvil were members between 1790 and 1800, while the minutes show that on the second Saturday in June, 1799, when the Three Forks Church were holding a meeting at Cove Creek, just prior to giving that community a church of its own, Abraham Linvil was received by experience, and in July following, at the same place, Catharine and Margaret Linvil also were so received. Several of the older residents of Dog Skin, Brushy Fork and Cove Creek confirms the\n\nreality of the residence of the Linville family in that community.\n\nIn September, 1799, Brother Vanderpool's petition for a constitution at Cove Creek was granted, Catherine Linvil having been granted her letter of dismission the previous August.\n\nSource: Murphey Papers, Vol. II, p. 386\n\n69.
