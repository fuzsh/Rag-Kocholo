        "text": "NotesCemetery is well maintained. Notes in Remarks column were provided by J. Robert Swank. Many of the Rows are irregular and some start in further than other rows. Facing the headstones, the rows are recorded from the bottom to the top of the hill and the stones from left to right. Section 001 is the main body of the cemetery. Section 002 are the remaining old graves and are located in the upper right hand corner of the cemetery along side of Route 732. Mr. Swank referred to it as being the west end of the cemetery. In 1937 John W. Wayland recorded some of the older stones. Mr. Wayland noted \"One of the English chapels built in Augusta Parish prior to the Revolutionary War stood in the old part of the Dayton Cemetery. See A History of Rockingham County, Page 255.\" A sign at the cemetery states it was Established in 1747. A Historical Sign notes as follows, The first church in Rockingham County was built on this site in 1747 on land owned by Captain Daniel Harrison of the Colonial Militia. Serving as a \"Chapel of Ease\" for Augusta Parish, the first building is believed to have been built of logs. The chapel was replaced by a larger frame building some 20 years later. Following the Revolutionary War, the church was used by a Methodist congregation; it was sold and functioned as a barn until it was torn down about 1900."
