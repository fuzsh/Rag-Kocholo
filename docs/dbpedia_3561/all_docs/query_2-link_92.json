Landon Paul Silas weighed in at nine pounds, five ounces. Both mother and son are doing great but Silas is eager to give his newborn son an anecdote that will remain a priceless memory for generations to come.\n\n\"I'm so happy,\" said Silas. \"This has been an unbelievable week with the birth of my son. Both Misty and Landon are doing great. Getting my first win this Saturday night would be a dream come true.\"\n\nThe anticipation of the arrival of Silas’s first born has tried to play havoc with his ARCA Racing Series career but Silas answered any questions whether or not his focus on racing would be sidetracked last weekend at Iowa Speedway. After missing both practices and qualifying to be at his wife’s side, the veteran driver flew to the Newton, Iowa speed plant late Saturday afternoon to partake in the Prairie Meadows 200 presented by SPEED on Mediacom. After starting at the rear of the field (33rd), Silas maneuvered his No. 11 Rockingham Speedway / Palm Beach Grading Ford Fusion into the top-10 before a late race slide forced the Fast Track Racing driver to cross the line 13th.\n\n“I want to thank everyone on the Fast Track team for their efforts last weekend at Iowa,” added Silas. “In case I don’t tell them enough, I appreciate everything they’ve done for me not only this year but especially the last couple of weeks. I want to also thank Johnny Sauter for practicing the car last Saturday; he did a great job with the setup. Despite the adversity we faced, I think we were pleased with the results.”\n\nWith the ARCA Racing Series (ARS) presented by RE/MAX and Menards returning to the tricky MMP for a night of short track thunder, Silas wants to make a statement that his team, despite the bad luck they’ve taken in this year, is still capable of running up front while hoping to make a substantial gain in the championship chase.\n\nAfter starting 15th last year at Mansfield, Silas methodically used patience to guide his Concord, North Carolina team to one of their 10 top-10 finishes in 2009 with an eighth place outing. With the momentum carrying on the personal side, the likeable ARCA driver is determined to deliver a similar performance.\n\n“A top-10 is great, but I’m looking for a lot more than that this weekend,” Silas sounded. “Mansfield is such a tricky place. It’s really like nothing we compete on during the year. One thing is for sure, you cannot afford to be a slouch. You have to be on your game from the moment the green flag drops to the moment you take the checkered flag. It’s an intense race but it makes a great treat for the fans.”\n\nEntering the 10th race of the season, Silas, a four year ARCA veteran is 12th in the ARCA Racing Series championship point standings with three top-10 finishes including a season-best eighth at Texas Motor Speedway in April. Just 70 points separate Silas from cracking into the top-10 in the standings. 275 credits separate the Fast Track Racing pilot from fifth in the overall championship chase.\n\nNason, Yeager, Gerson, White & Lioce P.A., MTW Services, Inc., Palm Beach Grading (PBG) and Rockingham Speedway will all sponsor Silas’s Ford Fusion for his 81st career ARCA start.\n\nThe Tim Richmond Memorial ARCA 200 (200 laps / 100 miles) is the 10th of 20 events on the 2010 ARCA Racing Series presented by RE/MAX and Menards schedule. The second annual ARCA race at Mansfield Motorsports Park is a one-day show. Practice begins Saturday July 17 with an hour and half practice session planned from 2:30 p.m. – 4:00 p.m. Menards Pole by Ansell qualifying is set for later in the day slated to begin at 5:00 p.m. The event will take the green flag shortly after 8:00 p.m. The race will not be televised but race coverage including live timing and scoring throughout the week will be available through the BAS Racing Network in conjunction with the ARCA Racing Network (ARN) online at arcaracing.com presented by ARCANation.com. All times are local.\n\nFor more on Bryan Silas please visit, BryanSilasRacing.com.\n\nVisit Fast Track Racing on the web at, FastTrackRacing.com."
