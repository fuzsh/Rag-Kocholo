        "text": "MARY EFFIE [O'BRYAN] BAUSELL\n\nTIMELINE\n\nSubmitted by Ricci Powell.\n\nSee also her family page.\n\nA little context from Ricci:\n\nI also want to submit a chronicle of my grandmother's life. Mary Effie (O'Bryan) Bausell comes from a long line of Hickory Countians. Her father Silas Wright O'Bryan was born in Morgan County but was in Cross Timbers, Hickory County by age 16 with his parents Caleb Hall and Mary Catherine (Robinson) O'Bryan where they homesteaded and lived the rest of their lives. Both of them were born just over the county line in Mack's Creek in 1827. Mary Effie's mother Mary Emaline (Hewgley)O'Bryan was born in Jordan in Hickory County in 1854. All of Mary Effie's uncles and aunts stayed in Hickory County all their lives and most of her siblings did also. Her last cousin to live on the Caleb Hall O'Bryan homestead was named Bertha O'Bryan\n\nand she never married. She stayed on the homestead and took care of her parents General Ivy & Sarah O'Bryan until they died. After their death, she continued to live on Ivy & Sarah's old homestead alone without water or electricity until she moved into a small house in town about 1990 where she stayed until her death about 3 years later. Bertha was 71 yrs old before she enjoyed electricity and indoor plumbing.\n\nMy grandmother left this chronological outline of her life and I just typed it up in a narrative format. It contains both her early childhood all the way thru her 50 years of marriage and to the date of her death, so it covers 1890 thru 1981. She lived in and around Hickory County for 33 years before moving west. There are many Hickory County names and many tales of everyday life in Hickory county and the surrounding areas. It might be very helpful to other researchers.\n\nMary Effie's Timeline\n\nMARY EFFIE (OBRYAN) BAUSELL\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\n1890- 1909\n\nMarried first to a cousin (Joseph Fulton Drennan), Mary Emeline (Hewgley) had four children by Drennan. Lucy Drennan (died at 1 yr), a baby boy (died at birth), Kanzada Drennan and America Drennan. Joseph Drennan would die about 1877. They may have divorced before his death, records are unclear.\n\nSilas Wright OBryan married Mary Emeline (Hewgley) Drennan on December 27, 1880 in Cross Timbers, MO.\n\nOffspring born to Silas Wright OBryan and Mary Emeline (Hewgley) OBryan\n\n1- General Ivy OBryan\n\n2- JoAnne Annie OBryan\n\n3- Katherine Lovada\n\n4- Mary Effie  THE SUBJECT OF THIS CHRONOLOGY\n\n5- Rose Zetta\n\n6- Othello\n\n7- William McKinley (died 3 days old)\n\n1890\n\nMary Effie was born on May 20, 1890\n\nSilas and Mary couldnt agree on a name for Mary Effie. Silas called her Jeff. Because they couldnt agree, Mary Effie had no official name. Mary Effie named herself at the age of 5 when she entered school.\n\n1892\n\nKanzada (Mary Effies half sister) and husband Tom Huffman fell in love with Mary Effie and wanted to adopt her. They even offered to buy Mary Effie for their own. Silas OBryan refused.\n\n1894\n\nSilas had spleen and kidney problems. He sold all his cattle, hogs, and sheep, kept the home and rented it to Jeff Stewart (his farm hand). He bought two new wagons and covered them with canvas and oil cloth. He bought six horses (2 teams). Oldest son Ivy drove one wagon, Mary Emeline drove the other wagon and they packed up and moved to Ft. Smith, Arkansas.\n\n1896\n\nThe OBryans moved back to Cross Timbers, MO and set up house. Jeff Stewart (farm hand renting the house) built a cabin on Silas property and lived there. Jeff set up the farm for Silas.\n\nMary began school in Cross Timbers at the Mulberry Schoolhouse. This was when Mary named herself. Mulberry Schoolhouse was a one room school. One student was in school until he was 21 (Andy Rich). Pupils only went to school if they wanted. No law requiring school attendance. Mary would only reach the 3rd grade before making her way in the world working for others.\n\nSilas was on the school board and in politics (republican). The School board selected the teacher and the families paid the teacher. Silas was Road Overseer, an official position paid by the county taxes. All property owners were taxed.\n\nSilas was not an MD but was a doctor by nature. He used Dr. Pierces Doctor Book, it was his bible and he studied it on his own. He never charged for services.\n\n1897\n\nMary Effies baby brother died shortly after birth and was buried at Mayberry Place, a private cemetery on private property.\n\nMary was in 2nd grade and was already reading and writing. Silas taught his children at home. His subjects were reading, writing, and arithmetic. The class size was about 25 students; John Drennan (17 yrs old and Mary Emelines cousin) was the teacher. The school had a pot bellied stove and when boys didnt behave, they sat on the stove a short time. Teachers could spank but it was limited. Teachers were responsible for all the cleaning of the school. Silas made benches and desks for the pupils. Pupils brought their lunches and were not allowed to leave. Games were Hopscotch, Hide n Seek, Kick the Can, and Wheres the Marker.\n\nSilas made shingles for the buildings and houses in the area and Mary Effie worked with him bailing shingles.\n\n1898\n\nMary Effie was in 3rd grade and walked 1½ miles to school. If you were late  you were punished. School hours were 9-4, five days a week. Friday nights at school were spelling bees, debates, music and singing. There were many school picnics (at least once a month) with home made ice cream.\n\nSilas had an ice house he kept locked. He lined it with sawdust and stored the ice from winter packed in newspapers. They also had ice in the house. Silas dug a hole on the north side of the house, lined it with sawdust, and again wrapped the ice in newspaper and this was ice for the home.\n\n1899\n\nMary was to begin the 4th grade. Her eyes had developed granulated eyelids late in the 3rd grade and she had to quit school. She was blind and had to sleep under the bed as light would be too intense. Marion Thomas, a friend of Silas took Mary Effie to Latham, MO to Dr. Latham (town named after Dr.). There, her eyelids were turned inside out and the eyeballs were scraped. She stayed for 3 days and had to cover one eye and look through a black veil doubled twice to filter the sunlight. This was the end of school for Mary Effie. Mary started working for others and helping her sisters when they needed help.\n\nSilas gave Mary Effie her own horse at age 9 and Mary and Silas went into the shingle business together. Although women were expected to be white and not tanned in those days, Mary Effie worked like a man and never covered her hair or hands, for Mary Effie and Silas were a team. Mary made herself an entire new outfit and bought the first factory made coat in her life. She made all her own clothes except for the coat. Mary Effie would continue to make all her own clothes throughout her life. Her 5oth Wedding Anniversary dress would be the exception.\n\n1900\n\nMary Effie now 10, went to Rodgers Arkansas with her half sister Kanzada and husband Tom. They traveled by covered wagon on dirt roads. Along the way, a mad dog bit the mule and the mule went mad. They had to shoot the mule. The mule was frothing at the mouth and biting chunks of wood. They took their time but were constantly on the watch for mad dogs.\n\nTom had a bottom farm, Kanzada worked in town and Mary Effie kept care of the children. None of the doors in the log house would stay closed. Mary could hear the locks click and the doors swing open. The house was considered haunted but Mary Effie was unafraid.\n\n1903\n\nMary Effie was 13 when she left home. She worked for Marion Thomas and wife and took care of the children. Her wages were $.13 a day and she stayed there until Mrs. Thomas died. Then Mary Effie went to Aunt Rachel (Hewgley) Ashleys (Mary Emelines fathers sister) house in Gordon, MO. Mary took care of her for room and board and had the weekends off. Aunt Rachel always bought Mary Effie gifts.\n\nThen Lillie and Leslie Stafford bought the General Store and Post Office. Mary went to work for them caring for the children for $3.50 per week. Lillie was a close family friend.\n\n1904\n\nAt 14 Mary Effie quit working for the Staffords and went to work for Ray Heyden and Grace. She took care of the children for $3.50 per week, but did no cooking. They owned the Childers Post Office and General Store. Mary lived at home 1½ miles from Childers.\n\nMary made all her own clothes all by hand, even the buttonholes. There was only one sewing machine in town belonging to her sister Annie. Mary Effie made her own patterns, she had never even seen a pattern. Marys sister Katheryn made patterns in Kansas City for Emery & Thayers and they sold!!!!\n\n1905\n\nMary Effie worked for the McFarlans. Mrs. McFarlan had a new baby making it eight children. They had a big farm and Mary worked for $5.00 per week. Mary Effie stayed there for over a year.\n\n1906\n\nKanzada (half sister) bought Mary Effie some new clothes. Mary went to work for older sister Annie in Fristoe, MO. Mary Effie left Annies house because John, Annies husband tried to rape her. She got on the mail truck and went home.\n\n1907\n\nMary Effie now 17 was back at home when her older sister Katheryn became pregnant with little Charlie. Mr. Cox sent Charlie Cox away to Ratton, NM and kept a guard on him so he could not marry Katheryn. Katheryn did not let anyone know she was pregnant. She left for Oklahoma to Uncle Ellick (Alex) OBryan. Silas tried to find Katheryn, wrote to Uncle Ellick and he told Silas Katheryn was there. In the meantime, Katheryn had gotten on a train  not knowing what to do or where to go. She met a woman who took her in, then contacted Silas. He went to the womans place and took Katheryn home. Katheryns mother (Mary Emeline) was very bitter and did not help Katheryn. The two half sisters (Kanzada and America) caused trouble for Katheryn. Silas ordered America out of the yard, never to come back. Mary Effie would stay at home to help Katheryn with the baby.\n\n1909\n\nMary Effie meets Herman Lee Bausell and courting begins. Herman composes many love poems to Mary Effie. Mary Emeline and Silas do not approve of Herman Lee Bausell. Mary Effie and Herman make plans to elope.\n\nHERMAN LEE BAUSELL AND MARY EFFIE OBRYAN\n\nA CHRONOLOGY OF THEIR MARRIED LIFE\n\n1910\n\nMary Effie OBryan married Herman Lee Bausell March 25, 1910 in Hermitage, MO. Katheryn (Mary Effies sister) made Marys wedding dress. Mary and Herman planned to elope as Marys parents didnt approve of Herman. Little Charlie (Katheryns son) told the parents before the elopement could take place and a visiting uncle promised Mary Effie a trip to Kansas City if she would change her mind. Herman and Mary refused to give in to the pressure and were married. Rose (Mary Effies sister) took advantage of the trip to Kansas City.\n\nAfter the wedding they lived with Hermans parents Fuller Isaiah Bausell and Mary Francis (Knifong) Bausell. Mary Francis did not care for Mary Effie and kicked Mary out one day while Herman was gone. Silas OBryan went and got Mary Effie and brought her home to stay. Mary Effie refused to go back to Hermans parents home and Herman until he had secured a place of their own. It would be Silas (known as Doc OBryan) who would tell Mary Effie she was pregnant. Many decades later Mary Effie would say that although she watched animals on the farm mate and give birth all the time, it just never occurred to her that she was pregnant. She would know from now on!!\n\nOn December 21, 1910 Thelma Irene Bausell (the first of eight children) was born in Cross Timbers, MO, two months premature, weighing in at 3½ pounds. Her bed would be a dresser drawer.\n\n1911\n\nHerman had joined the Army and was in Pensacola, FL. Herman had gotten a house, cleaned and painted it and laid 40 yards of carpet. (Mary Effie would later lay straw under the carpet to make it soft). Mary Effie took her first train ride (to Pensacola, FL) to join Herman where he surprised Mary Effie with her first home. Herman Lee didnt like the Army and he bought his way out early and they returned to Cross Timbers, MO in 1912.\n\n1914\n\nCloyd Lee Bausell was born January 12, 1913 in Cross Timbers, MO. (#2)\n\nHerman built a covered wagon that slept the two children and the 2 adults, and held all the kitchen equipment. It had two covers over the top and mosquito netting so they could have fresh air and they made their way to western Kansas. When they arrived in western Kansas, Mary cooked for the men in the fields for $.75 a day until she learned she could get $2.75 per day bailing hay. She got the job and saved her money. Herman had a moustache she detested and she told him she would give him her savings if he shaved it off. He agreed. Herman didnt keep his end of the bargain so when he was asleep Mary Effie cut off half of his moustache. Of course he had to shave the other half so Mary Effie won!! They lived in this covered wagon for a year, saved their money and then returned to Missouri. Now living in Kansas City, Mary Effie worked at a shirt factory and Herman worked at the state fair grounds. In Fall, Herman went to work for the Missouri/Kansas/Topeka Railroad. Herman wanted to go back into the service (WWI) but Mary wouldnt agree.\n\n1915\n\nHermans mother sent a message that Fuller (Hermans father) was dying. They immediately packed up and went home to Milan, MO. only to find nothing wrong with Fuller. It seems Mary Francis wanted Mary Effie there to help her catch up on all her work. Herman went to work with his Uncle Brad Knifong and was only home on the weekends. After Mary got all her mother-in-laws work caught up (and while Herman was away working with Uncle Brad), Mary Francis kicked Mary Effie and the two children out in the rain. Mary Effie with two children in tow, walked to Hermans Uncle Georges (George Flemm Bausell also married to a Knifong) sons house. Upon hearing of this, Herman and Uncle Brad went and got Mary Effie, and the two kids, Thelma and Cloyd and moved them into a home owned by Uncle Brad Knifong in Yellow Creek, MO. (not far from Milan). Here they raised crops, turkeys and chickens.\n\n1916\n\nMary Effie and Herman were both baptized into the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS).\n\n1917\n\nHerman and Mary Effie were once more back in western Kansas (Aliceville) working the hay harvest, and corn fed cattle and saving their money. They moved to Sedalia, MO and bought a house. Herman went to work for the Missouri Pacific Railroad. Mary Effies sister, Katheryns boy (Little Charlie) passes and is buried at Sweed Cemetery in Jordan, MO. with a beautiful large headstone. Herman is ordained as an Elder in the RLDS Church, and begins his 45 year pastoral career.\n\n1918  1919\n\nFrederick Madison Bausell is born on March 28, 1918 in Sedalia, MO (#3)\n\nMary Effies sister Katheryn marries Charlie Cox (father of Little Charlie) in Ratton, New Mexico. Charlie Cox never got to see his son.\n\nAfter being laid off from the Railroad, Herman traded the house for a wagon and team and moved to Cross Timbers /Jordan area of Hickory County, MO. They rented a farm and raised 80 acres of corn and maze. A flood washed everything away. Mary Effie and the children moved ½ mile from the Mulberry school while Herman went to western Kansas with Joe Yates to work in the wheat harvest.\n\n1920\n\nKenneth Wright Bausell in born on July 15, 1920 in Cross Timbers, MO. (#4)\n\nMary Effies sister Othello (OBryan) Chappelow gives birth to her first child, Rowena Maxine. Mary Effies sister Rose Zetta OBryan marries Earl Hodges in Independence, MO. On July 4th.\n\nHerman still working in the Kansas fields and saving his money came home with his first car, a Stanley Steamer. Everyone came to see it. It was nothing but trouble and sat more than it was driven. Herman traded it for an Essex Touring Car which ran very well.\n\n1921 - 1922\n\nFrederick Madison Bausell (Mary Effie and Hermans 3rd child) passes on March 25, 1921. He is buried on his 3rd birthday in Sweed Cemetery in Jordan, MO. not far from Little Charlie. Herman and Mary Effie move back to Sedalia where Mary Effie cooked and Herman worked in the fields.\n\nThey then moved on to Kansas City where they got word that Hermans brother was not expected to live, so they went back to Milan, Mo and once again went to work with Uncle Brad Knifong. Herman rented a farm and the crops were to be 50/50 with Uncle Brad financing the deal.\n\nHerman (now ordained by The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) baptized and confirmed Cloyd Lee Bausell.\n\n1923\n\nOliver Max Bausell is born on June 20, 1923 in Milan, MO. (#5)\n\nMary Effie claims to have carried Max for 10-11 months. This was her first child to be delivered by a doctor and weighed in at 14 pounds!!!!\n\nHerman and Mary Effie decide to move to Colorado.\n\n1924\n\nOthello Jean Bausell is born in Utleyville, CO on October 8, 1924. (#6)\n\nArriving in Utleyville, CO, Herman begins working for McNess Products. After building his own merchandise cabinets, Herman drives the car into the fields selling household products.\n\n1925\n\nMary Effies sister Katheryn (OBryan) Cox (mother of Little Charlie) passes in Trinidad, New Mexico while Mary Effie and Herman are still in Colorado.\n\n1926\n\nWanda Rose Bausell is born on January 31, 1926 in Graft, CO. (#7)\n\nHerman and Mary Effie are living in a Dugout, 3 bedrooms, kitchen, and front room. Herman continues to sell McNess Household Products. Herman also buys up old batteries and brass radiators. He makes $500 on this and they decide to buy a laundry. The laundry did not work out and they moved back to Utleyville where they farmed on 80 acres with a crop of beans. ****After harvesting the beans, they traded their Model T Ford in for a Nash, packed up the family.\n\n1927\n\nHerman finds himself with Inflammatory Rheumatism and is bedridden. Cloyd at age 13 drives the Model T and takes over Hermans McNess Products route to support the family. Mary Effie sells 8 horses, 14 cows, 35 hogs, 200 chickens and moves the family to Springfield, Colorado. Mary Effie runs a laundry from home and cares for the family. Cloyd picks up and delivers laundry in the Model T. Herman sits on a stool and does the flat ironing. Thelma (now 17) goes to work as a waitress and also travels to Prichert for the berry crop. Doctor Hamilton is paid by regularly cleaning his office and doing the laundry. Herman couldnt hold a regular job due to his health, but could put up a house when he was able to work. Herman and Mary built 2 houses on 2 lots in Prichert and sold them for cash to feed the family.\n\nHerman and Mary Effie travel to Cross Timbers, MO on a visit to see Mary Effies parents (Silas and Mary Emaline OBryan) and family. They stay about 6 weeks and this would be the last time Mary Effie would see her parents. Silas and Mary Emaline would see all of Mary Effies children except the last one.\n\n1928\n\nNow back in Utleyville, CO, Herman plants 80 acres of beans and moves an old house onto the property for the family to live in. Cloyd works for Roy Webb and feeds the family until the crop comes in. Thelma takes care of the house and kids while Mary Effie (pregnant once more), works in the fields with Herman.\n\n1929\n\nBruce Byron Bausell is born on August 28, 1929 in Utleyville, CO. (#8)\n\nMary Effie and Herman lived about 65 miles from the nearest doctor (Dr. Hamilton); therefore Bruce was 2 hours old when the doctor arrived. Britty Cashaw and Sister Berry (Cloyds boss wife) delivered Bruce. Dr. Hamilton declares A healthy boy with square shoulders weighing in at 12 pounds. Cloyd rides a horse to deliver the news to the rest of the children that We have a baby brother.\n\nThe family sells out, packs up, and on Christmas day heads for Imperial Valley, CALIFORNIA!!\n\n1930\n\nBy the time the family arrived in Imperial Valley in February, they had a total of $.50 to their name. This money was for milk for the new baby. Immediately upon arriving, the entire family (including all children except baby Bruce) went to work picking cotton. Hermans new song was Eleven cent cotton and forty cent meat, how in the world can a poor man eat. Living first in the open, they moved into a deserted house. Herman and Cloyd got jobs at the Ice Plant in El Centro, CA. Herman traded wages for food and there was plenty to eat.\n\nMary Effie went to work for Mrs. Scolia in Seely, CA baking bread and pies. Mrs. Scolias daughter had told her she wouldnt come and visit anymore if she didnt give up the café. After Mrs. Scolia got to know Mary Effie and the rather large family and found out she was Irish, she gave the run down café to Mary Effie!! So Mary Effie got the cafe and Mrs. Scolia went to live with her daughter in Hollywood, CA. The men set to work renovating the café. Herman built several new tables, three 12 foot long ones and several smaller ones. They put in a new sink, stove and refrigerator. The old sink was used as a playpen for baby Bruce. After Herman put in a new toilet and shower, the family moved and lived in the back of the café. Herman continued to drive the ice truck while Mary Effie worked the café. Mary Effie sold monthly tickets and did all the cooking, even the bread and pies. Mary Effie would work the café for four years.\n\nOthello Jean was starting first grade so Thelma took her to El Centro and bought her black patent Mary Jane shoes to start school. Wanda Rose (Wendy) would run off and follow Jean to school and squeeze into Jeans seat. One day Wendy (afraid to leave school), wet her pants and Wendy and Jean sat there for hours. After that, the teacher decided to enroll Wendy in school too.\n\nThelma ran away to San Diego and met Mike Grimm, USN. They would marry in 1932.\n\nCloyd helped in the café and met Junior Pippenger who was hungry, alone and had an old car. Cloyd brought him home. Junior lived with the Bausells until he married, and was a close family friend.\n\n1931\n\nThe family finally bought and moved into a home on New River and Highway 80 in Seely, CA. The house was large and it sat on 5 acres. During the Depression, entire families would come up Hwy 80 tired, hungry and looking for work. Mary Effie did her best to feed anyone she could.\n\n1932\n\nThelma marries Michael Bennie Grimm in San Diego, CA. Mike had been in the Navy since 1928 and would go to work for L.B. Price Co. upon his discharge in 1934. In 1935 Herman would baptize Mike into the RLDS (Reorganized Latter Day Saints) Church.\n\n1933\n\nThe family packs up and moved to San Diego, CA. They bought the house at 4802 Kenmore Terrace. The house cost $600 @ $6.00 per month. The children all came down with the measles and a quarantine sign was put on the door. This measles epidemic would cause vision problems for baby Bruce for the rest of his life. The children started school and Kenny would walk them to and from school until they learned their way. Cloyd was still in Seeley, CA with the Ice Route, coming home on weekends. Herman went to work doing odd jobs then started working for $1.00 a day, six days a week.\n\n1934 - 1936\n\nHerman goes to work for L.B. Price Co. and Cloyd takes over the service station on Park Blvd and El Cajon where Herman had worked. Later Cloyd would also start working at L.B. Price as a collector.\n\nMary Effie has gall bladder surgery and Herman does all the cooking. Your choice: baked beans, baked beans or baked beans.\n\nWendy is put into a Sanitarium for Anemia and not expected to live. After 18 months, she was able to come home in 1936 but could only go to school ½ days and would have to spend another year in 5th grade.\n\nCloyd passes on May 15, 1936 in San Diego, CA from a ruptured appendix that had gone green (gangrene), just six months before Penicillin was available over the counter which would have saved his life. Wendy is down with the mumps and cant attend Cloyds funeral.\n\nKenny goes into the Sanitarium with Tuberculosis for six months but finally is well enough to come home.\n\nSix months after Cloyd passes, Max is extremely ill with Pneumonia. The Dr. flies Penicillin in from New York (now its available) for Max, and although he has an allergic reaction to it, it saves his life.\n\nAll medical procedures are done at the County Hospital for no charge and Mary Effie proclaims THANK YOU USA!! AND THANK YOU LORD!!.\n\nTimes are hard and Thelma (now married to Mike) brings clothes and helps Mary Effie and Herman any way she can with the children.\n\n1937\n\nMary Effies father (Silas Wright OBryan) passes on March 23, 1937 in Kansas City, MO. Mary Effie cannot afford to go to the funeral.\n\nKenny and Max now in their teen years and flexing their testosterone are constantly at each other. Kenny and Max get into a fight in the Egyptian Theatre and Kenny is in jail for the week-end. Herman sells Old Bessie the cow to get bail money for Kenny.\n\nKen gets his first suit. Max wears it out without Kens permission and Ken sees him out at night time on the city street. Max takes the suit off and hands it to friend Bob Landis and he and Ken fight under the street light with Max in only his shorts.\n\nJean works at the cleaners for $.30 hr. on the 3-9 night shift and all day on Saturdays. Max and Ken both work at the 12th St. Market. Max as a vegetable trimmer for $21 per week and Ken for $39 per week. Ken gets fired for slipping change under the runner by the cash register. When Ken told them they werent paying him enough, they rehired him for more money.\n\n1938\n\nKen graduates from Hoover High School (the first graduate in the Bausell family). When Mary Effie and Herman could not afford a suit for Ken, Hoover High School bought Ken an entire outfit for graduation, including the shoes.\n\n1939\n\nMary Effies mother (Mary Emaline (Hewgley) Drennan OBryan) passes on March 25, 1939. Once again Mary Effie could not afford to go to the funeral. Mary Effie signs over her share of the estate to Othello (OBryan) Chappelow and her husband Cecil who cared for Silas and Mary Emaline in their later years.\n\nHerman is working at the Civic Centre as a gardener and is also remodeling and adding on to the house on Kenmore Terrace. Ken is still working at the 12th St. Market. Max is driving a Liquor truck and Mary Effie is working at the Good Will.\n\n1940\n\nHerman will finish the addition and remodel on the Kenmore Terrace home in 1940. Mary Effies sister Othello (OBryan) Chappelow and husband Cecil will visit San Diego and the entire California Bausell Clan will have dinner and step out for the night in La Jolla with the visitors.\n\n1941 - 1942\n\nThelma and Mike pick up Herman, Mary Effie and Bruce and travel to Missouri where they will visit with all the relatives of both the OBryan and Bausell sides of the family. Many photos are taken and they will prove to be the last group pictures of Mary Effie, her sisters and half sisters. The pictures of Herman with his brother Allen and family also will be the last group shot. These photos (as with all family photos starting in 1898) will be treasured and passed down in the family. Herman, Mary Effie and the family were in church when they heard about the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe war is on and the family finds themselves all working for Consolidated Air Craft. Herman works in the parts bin, Mary Effie works the drill press. Kenny works there about six months.\n\nKenny finally enters the Army on February 9, 1942, after failing his first urinalysis (TB) but had a friend submit his second specimen and passed. Max enters the Army on February 2, 1942 and is sent to Ft. McArthur, San Francisco, CA.\n\n1943\n\nKenny meets and marries Pat Fields in Los Angeles. Pat would divorce Kenny that same year. Jean graduates from high school and goes to work for Consolidated Aircraft with Herman and Mary Effie as a draftsman in the Engineering Dept.
