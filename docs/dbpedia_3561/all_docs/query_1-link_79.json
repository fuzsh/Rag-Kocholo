No English, Australian, or New Zealand Morphew (variant spellings) have submitted tests and are invited to do so. Results show the following:\n\nY-DNA Tests for Descendants of Silas Morphew I (~1752 to 1807)\n\nSubject 159482: 1  J. Morphew (~1720-<1783), 2  Silas Morphew I ~1752-1807, Aaron Morphew, Gaynor Prince Morphew (1848  1922). This subject had 35/37 markers matched with the next subject 128995. Their common ancestor was Silas Morphew (~1752  1807)\n\nSubject 128995: 1- J. Morphew (~1720-<1783), 2- Silas Morphew I ~1752-1807, 3- Uriah Morphew/Murphy ~1780->1840, 4-Hiram Morphew/Murphy ~1815->1860, 5-Abijah F. Murphy 1847-1888, 6-William Robert Murphy 1877-1945 and on for 7 generations. This subject had 64/67 markers match with subject 48170 making their common ancestor to be James Morphew (ca1715 to <1783).\n\nY-DNA Tests for Descendants of James Morphew II (~1750 to 1829)\n\nSubject 48170: 1 - J. Morphew (~1720-<1783), 2-James Morphew II ~1750-1829, 3-Joseph Morphew ~1775->1820, 4-James Morphew 1805-1871, 5-Rev. William H. Morphew 1829-1912, 6-Riley H. Murphy 1853-1935 and so on for 8 generations.\n\nSubject 180150: 1 - J. Morphew (~1720-<1783), 2  James Morphew II ~1750-1829, 3  Joseph Morphew (~1775->1820), (probably Benjamin Franklin Morphew I (1811  1897). Has 35/37 matches with the first 3 subjects.\n\nY-Dna marker comes from the y-chromosome and only males can pass this on. This makes for an excellent test confirming Morphew lines. So far, no mismatch marker has been identified as common to a certain line of Morphew, but more tests may do so.\n\nSilas Morphew + Elizabeth England lived in the following locations, some still being speculative.\n\n1775 - Chatham County, N. C: Marriage of Silas Morphew to Elizabeth England.\n\n1783 - Guilford County, N.C: Guilford County Quakers mention Silas has moved.\n\n1785/86 - Surry County, N.C: tax lists\n\n1790 - Burke County, N.C: \"Silas Murphy\" on U.S. Census list with the Englands.\n\n1807 - Burke County, N.C: \"Silas Murphey\" recorded death near Morganton.\n\n1810 - Wilkes County, N.C: Elizabeth Murphey near sons Silas and Uriah.\n\n1814-1823 - Knox County, Tn: Children marry here: Silas, Obediah, and Jennie.\n\n1830 - Roane County, Tn: Elizabeth Murphey (Silas widow) - head of household on U.S. Census.\n\nSilas married Elizabeth England at Chatham County, N.C. in 1775 with the source being Arlie C. Morphew. Why Chatham County has been the source of much speculation, but it has not been well researched yet. John England was clearly living in Rowan County, N.C. in 1768 (tithable record) and in the newly divided off Surry County in 1771 (tithable record). In fact, what were both doing in Chatham? Arlie Morphew speculated that John England, father of Elizabeth, traveled back and forth to his father, William England, in Chatham County.\n\nSilas Morphew was considered a Tory by some, at least enough to attempt to hang him. We dont know the year, which could tell us more of the story. The years could be from 1775 to 1783. After the war, Tory lands and property were seized. In Wilkes County, Benjamin Cleveland hunted down his enemies for hanging. Cyrus Grubb states Silas was saved when a woman held him up by the legs till help came. In this case, Silas needed to leave the area for a safer site and, perhaps, we will find him living in an unusual location. He does give us one clue. The Quaker Church records at Deep River (Guilford County) note the following:\n\n1783  Guilford County, North Carolina: Deep River Quaker Meeting on their 7th month 1783 notes Silas Murphy having been under the care of the preparative meeting, now requests to be joined in membership which this meeting grants (From Quaker microfilm records at Guilford Collage). The Quaker Encyclopedia indicated he had moved.\n\n1785 - Surry County, North Carolina taxable: 1785 \"Silas Murphy\" and 1786 \"Silas Murphew,\" but Silas has no acreage.\n\n1786 Census of Surry County, N.C: Silas Murphy is in Captain Wrights district and shows 1 male 21-60 years of age, 3 males under 21 and above 60, 2 white females all ages. His brother James is also listed here.\n\n1790 - Burke County, North Carolina Census: Silas Murphy is recorded and in the same county is Daniel England, John England Sr., John England Jr., Joseph England, and Thomas England, all related to Silas wife Elizabeth.\n\n1790 July  Wilkes County, North Carolina: Silas Murphey is recorded present at the Wilkes County estate inventory sale of Youngs Coleman. His sister, Sarah Morphew was Colemans widow.\n\n1791 Yakin County (formerly Surry County) Land Grant Map: Map shows Silas Morphew with a land grant near Forbis Creek (details not known). This was formerly seen at the website nealancestry.com/scncmap.htm.\n\n1795  Burke County, North Carolina: Silas is mentioned in the will of John England, father of Elizabeth, which was probated at Burke County. It gives to Silass wife one calf, one cow, no more, no less. The wording suggests that John England had disapproved of Silas, but the reason is not known. Silas was probably living in Wilkes County at the time.\n\n1790 to 1800  Old Ashe County (now Watauga County): Membership list at Three Forks Baptist Church (formerly Ashe County, now Watauga County) includes Elizabeth Morphew. The list covered the years 1790 to 1810. If Silas was living there, he entered no land in the South Fork of New River area.\n\n1807 November 10  Burke County: \"On 10 November (1807), Robert Craig, Esq. of Morganton, (died) of a sudden illness. Also, Messrs Silas Murphey, John Bryant, Jonathon Duckworth, __ Moor, and Mrs. Mary Bradley, in the vicinity of the same place. All of whom were called in the course of four days of the disease which has proved so epidemical of late, in every quarter of the union.\"\n\nTM, Thursday, 10 December 1807, Volume 3, page 4, as entered in \"Abstracts of Vital Records from Raleigh, North Carolina Newspapers 1799-1819,\" Volume One.\n\n1810 US Census of Wilkes County: Silas' death was confirmed in this census which lists Elizabeth Murphy head of the household, with possible names added:\n\nElizabeth Murphey - 1810 U.S. Census of Wilkes County:\n\n2 females 0-<10; 1 female 10-<16; 2 females 16-<26 - Rhoda, Jennie, Peggy, Kizzy, and Sallie.\n\n1 female 45+ - Elizabeth Morphew\n\n3 males 16-<26  Silas, John M., Aaron (Where is James?)\n\nComment: Note that one son is missing here and Uriah Murphy/Morphew has his own Wilkes Census. Some of Elizabeth's daughters seem rather young and that raises questions about grandchildren.\n\nAfter this point in time, the trail of Elizabeth England Morphew becomes hard to follow. Until recently, she was thought to be the oldest female in the 1820 and 1830 household of Silas Murphy, who lived in the Burke County, North Carolina. Evidence is increasing that this Silas belonged to James Morphew (born ~1750) and that the correct Silas Murphy/Morphew, Jr. had migrated to Tennessee to become a Private in the War of 1812-1814. An 1830 Census of Roane County, Tennessee records an Elizabeth Murphy who must be our Elizabeth England Morphew. She was head of the household and was born between 1750-1760. This same 1830 Census lists Obediah Murphy and John McCarroll, who married Permelea Morphew. Elizabeth does not appear again, but by 1840, Uriah Murphy is now in the same county.\n\nIt is not known where Silas and James were buried. However a very old Morphew-Gentry Cemetery is located at Stony Fork, Watauga County, North Carolina, on a mountain top along the eastern bank of the South Fork of New River. Readable grave stones belong to descendants of Silas, including Cyrus Grubb, who furnished some of the earliest clues about the clan. As one inspects the rows of Morphew stones, the dates become older as one walks east. In the eastern-most grave stones, the writing is no longer legible, and one wonders if these belong to Silas and even Mary Morphew, wife of the first known Morphew who probably immigrated to America.\n\nThe cemetery is located 7-8 miles east of Boone, North Carolina, and approximately 3 1/2 miles north. Drive east from Boone, N.C. along route 421/221 to the church center called Laxon (still in Watauga County), turn Northwest on old state highway road for 0.7 miles, then north on county road 1353 (Hardin Road). As one drives north, a small creek will meander along the west side of the road. This creek suddenly turns west to empty into the South Fork of New River. Not far from this point may be seen the cemetery on top of a high hill along the west side of the road.\n\nJames P. Morphew adds: The Morphew Cemetery in Watauga County is known as the Morphew  Gentry Cemetery and its directions: Hardin Road now directly intersect Hwy 421 with a nice clear sign, if you happen to be looking and sober. The cemetery is the west side, less than a mile up, but difficult to see. Turn left on All Hallows Road, which ascends up to it, rather steeply, behind a couple of dwellings. Dont be shy, step on it, my car made it. Headstones legibly go back to the early 1800s, there is indeed one Silas Morphew, and a few other Morphew of varying legibility and suspicion. This cemetery is listed as the Morphew Cemetery on findagrave.com and lists grave stones.\n\nThanks go to James P. Morphew, email courtesy 15 January 2013.\n\nI am very much interested in the problems of the Morphews during and following the War of Independence. Because it was so much earlier than the Civil War, accounts are dim. As fond as I am of Silas, the first, I do not believe that the story is quite true, at least the hanging. The story my father told me is so vividly impressed upon my memory.\n\nMy father never told any of these gruesome tales about his fore-bearers, so when my brother, as a young boy, came home from Ash County and Watauga where he had been visiting, he had heard even wilder tales concerning the adventures of the Morphews and Greers and Grubbs. What Clevelands men had failed to do, the Yankees did! And to cap it all, the Grubbs told him that one Morphew, Silas, had been hanged! We had something at last, on the Wiggins and Deveres  none of them could match a tale like the one we had about Silas.\n\nWhen my father heard that my brother was telling this tale about Silas Morphew being in some big battle and getting hanged and rescued, he told us that it was not true. The reason I remember it so vividly, I was so disappointed! My father said that Silas Morphew and his wife were visiting cousins. Rumors were going around that rewards were being offered for the capture of Tory Spies.\n\nSome rough necks, my father called them, came to the house and accused young Silas of being a spy. They marched him out across the clearing and into the woods. His wife and cousin followed along begging and crying and entreating hard and fast, then they began to interrogate him. To each question they asked, Silas is reported to have answered with a riddle. Finally the men went off and left Silas, and no wonder, bested as they were at every turn with the riddles.\n\nDespite not being hanged, Silas seems to have emerged from his ordeal as a hero, for, according to my father, that spot where Silas was tried was named Riddle Gap. (Uncle Jim Morphew told me the men heard a noise and left Silas.) There is a Riddle Creek in Watauga County, a Riddle Gap in Yadkin, and a place once called Riddle in Surry.\n\nThe Morphews and Greers got their cash money by gathering medicinal herbs and roots high up in the mountains and carrying them many miles to the trading centers. In later years, several of the Greers and Morphews established a huge crude drug plant.\n\nLeah Greer Barrow added that her grandfather John U. Greer was born in Ashe County, North Carolina in 1867 and died 1972 in Pike County, Kentucky. Lean \"grew up digging Mayapple and Bloodroot for my grandfather. He wouldn't let us dig the gensing. He would pay us a little money and then he would lay it out to dry. He then took it to his cousin for money. ...I ran into a girl in Aiken, South Carolina with the name tag of Greer. She married the grandson of R.G. Greer in Pikeville, Kentucky that had the herb business. She told me that they were back in business. My nephew lives in our home place and he sells the ginseng around $450.00 a pound. His first cousin had an herb company in Pikeville, Kentucky, and it is still in operation today.\" (e-mails courtesy Leah Greer Barrow, 9 and 10 April 2006).\n\nA descendant of John England, Bess A. Machtley of West Chester, Pa. has quite a book on the Englands, and I will quote a ...reason (why) John England went to Chatham County, N.C. before moving on to Burke County by 1790. Mrs. Machtley is a descendant of Aaron England, son of John England.\n\nWilliam England, born Tyrone Ireland, came with the first Scotch-Irish immigration to Chester County, Pa., and was the first known England to settle in America. He located in Somerset County, Maryland, after marrying 1st to Elizabeth Wilcox or Wilcoxin. One son was born - William England. He married 2nd to Mary Watson, daughter of William Watson, Gloucester, N.J. There were four sons to this 2nd marriage, all born in Maryland: Daniel, Joseph, Samuel, and John England. With the tide of immigration moving south, he took his family in 1760 to Chatham County, N.C. where he received a large land grant. (The reason John went to Chatham County to see his father before going to Burke County). Of course Silas went along to get Elizabeth, but was back in the vicinity of Deep River Quakers. Very shortly thereafter, Mrs. Machtley says there is some doubt about John Englands religion, maybe none, but we do know that Elizabeth was a member of Three Forks Baptist Church. Mrs. Machtley says she lived down the road from the land of Goshen Quaker meeting house and cemetery.\n\nIn the same letter, Arlie changes the subject: Another Morphew has popped up  Jesse Morphew, who died in 1810 and had 2560 acres of land in one tract and another 2500 acres, purchased in 1809, all in White County, Tennessee. On May 15, 1811, an inventory of his estate was made by Uriah Morphew and presented to the courts on that date (will book A-10). Now this is something else - for who was Jesse Morphew and why would Uriah Morphew be inventorying his estate?\n\nIndex to Early Tennessee Wills and Administrations lists a Jesse Murphrey, 1811 in White County, Tennessee Will Book A/p10. Surname spelling is unclear and may be Murphey or Murphrey. His estate administration has not been reviewed  JRM.\n\nThe following are the children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren of Silas Morphew and his wife Elizabeth England. More concise dates are needed and inaccuracies need to be identified. As the genealogical framework of names, dates, locations, and census records develops, hopefully more stories will come forth. These Morphews moved frequently, which makes tracing them more difficult.\n\nChildren will be noted with roman numerals (I) (II) (III), etc\n\nGrandchildren noted with (1) (2) (3), etc.\n\nGreat grandchildren with (i) (ii) (iii), etc.\n\nGreat-great grandchildren with (a) (b) (c), etc.\n\nGreat-great-great grandchildren with (aa), (bb), (cc)\n\nGx4 grandchildren with (^1), (^2)\n\nCensus and Other Records for Uriah Morphew:\n\n1804 - Wilkes County, N.C: Uriah is a witness for Moses Hull versus Landrine Eggers Trial\n\n1810 - US Census of Wilkes County, North Carolina with wife and two daughters.\n\n1811 - White County, Tennessee tax list: Uriah Murphy\n\n1812-1814 War: Private Uriah Murphey enlisted in Major John Chiles' Battalion, Mounted Gunmen, East Tennessee. John Chiles was from Knox County and was probably where his troops were recruited. Also, there was a Private Uriah C. Murphey in Colonel Thomas H. Benton's 2nd Regiment of Tennessee Volunteers, who may or may not be the same Uriah with a second enlistment.\n\n1814 April 3: Noted delinquent on Knox County taxes; \"tax release\" in 1815.\n\n1830 - US Census of Roane County, Tennessee: Possibly Uriah is one of unnamed members in the Roane County household of Elizabeth Murphy. This is the same county where his brothers Obediah Morphew and Silas Morphew lived. Earlier U.S. Census records from 1790 to 1820 for Eastern Tennessee were destroyed in a fire(s).\n\n1840  US Census of Roane County, Tennessee: Uriah Murphy, a wife, and one son, who could possibly be Hiram Morphew. Other children have left the nest. Oddly enough, yearly tax records do not pick him up, but taxes for these years are strange: i.e. tax imposed for use of State such as gold watches, jewelry, plates, paintings, slaves.\n\n1850 - Roane County, Tennessee census record: Nancy Murphy (1782/83) is living with the family of Hiram Murphy (Morphew). This is the only evidence we have that Uriah married a second time, unless this is another name for his first wife.\n\nToo little is known about Uriah and family records are needed to clarify the information. Children of Uriah Morphew + Anna Fairchild (probably) are poorly understood, and seem to include:\n\n(1) (probably) Charlotte (Morphew/Murphy), born 1807 North Carolina and living beyond 1860. Charlotte's maiden name being a Morphew was suggested by Barb (Durham) Smith, in her e-mail of 6 March 2005. Charlotte married Singleton Durham about 1826. \"Charlotte belonged to the Prospect Baptist Church in Roane County...and wrote a letter of resignation about 1852\" (e-mail of Barb Smith 24 March 2005). No family records mention her. The following associations strongly suggest a relationship to the Morphews.\n\n1. 1830 - U.S. Census of Roane County: Singleton Durham next to Obediah Murphey. Singleton and Charlotte then go separate ways by 1840.\n\n2. 1840 - U.S. Census of Roane County: Charlotte Dearham without a husband is next to Richard Snow, who married Sarah J. Morphew in 1829.\n\n3. 1850 - U.S. Census of Roane County: Charlotte Durham is two entries away from Richard + Sarah Morphew Snow.\n\n4. 1860 - U.S. Census of Wright County, Missouri: Charlotte Durham now living in household of son, James Harvey Durham + Sarah E. (Rose) Durham. Two entries away are Hiram + Emeline Murphy/Morphew.\n\n5. Name \"Charlotte\" name is used for children's names by Sarah Morphew Snow and Hiram Murphy/Morphew. Likewise, Charlotte used the name of \"Hiram\" for one of her children.\n\n(2). Daughter #2, name unknown, born 1800-<1810 (best between 1807-<1810), per census records.\n\n(3). (possibly) William Morphew, born ~1810 and married ~1827. No family record mentions him or to whom he belongs. The only record found on him is the 1830 U.S. Census of Monroe County, Tennessee with his name clearly written \"William Morphew.\" After this point, his trail is lost.\n\n1830 - US Census of Monroe County, Tennessee: William Morphew: 1 male + 1 female born 1825-1830 (0-<5); 1 female born 1810-1815 (15-<20); 1 male born 1800  1810 (20-<30). An unnamed daughter and son need identification.\n\nA 2005 query asked whether William Morphew's male son, name unknown, could be that of a Thomas L. Murphy (~1827 ->1900) who married in Grainger County, Tennessee on 13 June 1826 to Susan Boatright. They moved to Polk County, Missouri by 1850, Cherokee County, Kansas by 1880 and Benton County, Arkansas in 1900.

Abijah Fairchilds Murphy (1847 Tennessee to 1888) questionably married 1st to Elizabeth __ and definitely to Minerva __ by the year 1874. Marriage records for Wright County, Missouri did not survive for this period of time.\n\nFrom Bernice Robinson and Jean Murphy: \"Older living Arkansas relatives knew Abijah Murphy as \"Bibe\" and believed him to be the father of the clan, but records proved that untrue, rather he was the oldest son. Living descendants reported Abijah did marry, and fathered four children but they did not know his wife's name. Grandson, William Rodney Murphy stated that Abijah made a trip by covered wagon to Texas, and somewhere in 1877 Texas, his father (William Robert Murphy) was born in the covered wagon. He did return to Arkansas, and both he and his wife are buried in McCullough Cemetery, but with no markers and exact dates of death unknown. John Murphy, a grandson, reported Abijah died when John's father was only 10 years of age, established his death late 1887 or early 1888.\"\n\nLocations found for Abijah Fairchild Murphy  census and other records:\n\n1860 - Wright County, Hartville County, Missouri, Abijah with parents.\n\n1870 - (possibly) Wright County, Hartville P.O., Missouri as Elijah + Elizabeth.

John Thomas Murphy (21 February 1908 Sharp County, Arkansas  15 November 1979 - buried McCullough Cemetery) married Marie Freeze and had two children: (^1) Robert Thomas Murphy and (^2) Wanda Murphy\n\n(bb). James Archie \"Arch\" Murphy, Sr. (18 June 1910 Banks Community, Sharp County, Arkansas to 1968 in an auto accident) who married in Pocahontas, Randolph County, Arkansas to Hazel Bell Powell (13 February 1920 Sharp County to 7 December 1987 and both buried Bradford Cemetery, Sharp County). Hazel was the daughter of Neil Powell and Alice Smalley, and had 8 children. They belonged to the Church of Christ.\n\n\"After finishing the 8th grade and about grown up, my dad became a boxer and went around the county for matches. Someone was always trying to whip him, even though he weighed only 140 pounds. He soon became a champion in three counties. Even when he went to dances or parties, someone would try to whip him. He wouldn't back down and could even beat someone twice his size and could fight 2 or 3 men at the same time.\n\nMy dad told me that he and his brother Luther, who was 5 ½ years younger, got into a fight with the Weaver brothers at Banks School. This school was used for school, church, and social functions. Luther was a hot head and he pulled a knife and cut one of the brothers. Arch told others that he did it because Luther was so young and scared. Arch went to the Pea Farm Prison for the attack where convicts worked in a pea field. A few days later while Arch was working in the fields, he asked the guard if his gun was loaded because he was going to run away. The guard said, 'now Arch, you don't want to do that, I'll shoot you.' He ran and the guard shot him in the leg but he kept running. He hid out at his older brother John's house for three weeks. Later he went anywhere he wanted and was never arrested.\"\n\n\"At the age of 19, Arch lost his left eye when a piece of steel hit him while hammering on a car. When he was in his late twenties, he went with a couple of guys to Kansas to work in the wheat fields. While there, Dad was standing behind the car when a big truck ran off the road and hit him, throwing him over the car which was totaled. He flew almost 90 steps, hitting the highway on his face and chest. Arch was taken to a hospital were they left him in the hallway on a stretcher for dead. His boss heard about it, went to the hospital, and found him in the hallway unconscious. He made them take him into the operating room and fix him up. He was out for about 40 hours and off work for quite a while. After that, one leg was smaller than the other from his injuries.\"\n\n\"Dad used to call square dances and danced; that's how he met Hazel Bell Powell who became his wife. Later, Arch, Hazel and her sister Lois moved to Oklahoma to work because Arch had a cousin there. Lois ended up marrying his cousin Clifford Kimbro.\"\n\n\"Their 3rd child, Betty Sue, died in 1946 at the age of 5 when she came down with diphtheria. Hazel was told by Mary Murphy that a visitor had brought in the deadly bacteria on his clothing.\"\n\n\"I remember going to Indiana to pick tomatoes, Michigan to pick cherries and southern Arkansas to pick cotton for school clothes money. Dad worked in timber, cut logs, and hewed out cross ties with a broad axe. He could hew out 21 to 22 ties a day. He would cut logs and load them by himself. During summer time when school was out, I worked with him using a cross cut saw. I remember the first chainsaw he bought was so big that it took two men to operate it.\"\n\n\"Dad would take time off from work to take people to the doctor or to town. Rheta Powell, Hazel's younger cousin, told me that he would cut and haul wood to them when her parents were out of wood. Arch would often stop his car to pick up others who were walking. He was a teaser. Wanda Baldridge was nine when Arch married Hazel. Wanda thought the world of Hazel, but Arch would tease Wanda until she wanted to choke him. He would pull her onto his lap and she would bite and kick him. Everyone would be shelling beans on the porch and he would sit by Wanda, so then she would move and so would he. Hazel would tell him to leave her alone. Wanda was 'so embarrassed.'\"\n\n\"I remember an old school bus Dad bought. He cut off the body to haul logs. It didn't have any doors on it. One day, Dad had been drinking and ran it into the ditch. He fell out and the back wheels ran over him pushing him facedown in the mud in the ditch. It was dark when Dwayne Young came by and found him moaning. Dad spit up mud for a long time after that and I remember him in bed for a week. I'm not saying this because he was my dad, but he was the toughest person I know. My brother-in-laws found that out by working with him.\"\n\n\"In 1958, he was working on a pipeline in Aurora, Illinois. At quitting time, they were putting up blockades and signs when a lady ran him over and dragged him under her car. After operating on him, the doctors placed him in a body case. He tried to get Social Security disability but was turned down twice.\"\n\n\"In 1959, he bought a log house with 40 acres in Sharp County with settlement money from the accident. Social Security still wouldn't help him. After a while, he told the Social Security people where they could put their money. He still had five kids to support. He threw away his back brace and went to work cutting wood. He would come home at night, sit down in a chair to rest, and could barely get up afterwards. In 1964, he went to work on a pipeline as a teamster driving a truck in Illinois. Later he returned to Arkansas, bought a new truck, and went to see his brother Lee before heading back to Illinois. After leaving Lee's house, he had a heart attack on the road and hit a bridge. My dad, Arch Murphy, Sr. died 21 July 1968.\n\nFrom \"My Dad was the Toughest Man I Ever Knew,\" by James Archie Murphy, Jr. with Jean Murphy, 31 May 2007\n\n(cc).

Luther was an auto finisher and buffer.\n\nFrom Jennifer Langley, email of 28 February 2009  thank you Jenny:\n\n\"Luther's grandchildren called him 'Peto' (pronounced 'pee-toe') which my older sister Mitzi started as she was the first grandchild. We called our grandmother Thelma 'Nany' (pronounced 'nanny') which my sister also started.\"\n\n\"I have fond memories of Peto, although very few, as he moved out of state when I was very young. He used to sit us on his calf with his leg propped over the other while holding our hands and move his leg up and down saying 'ride the pony up to town, hold on tight so you don't fall down.' He never seemed to tire of it and he would laugh just as hard as we would. He would catch me in the butter as I loved sneaking into it, and wouldn't tell my mom. She caught him once with me on his lap, butter in one hand and tablespoon in the other. He called my mother Karen, his older daughter \"Sissy.\" From what I can remember, he was a gentleman and was always very kind to us. He and my Nany spoiled all of their grandkids. Luther never hesitated to tell someone exactly what he thought or how things were.\n\nAfter Luther and Nany divorced and he moved to Arkansas, we went to visit him. I remember he told us to stay way from the river because of the snakes. He also killed a tarantula in the house in front of us. He passed away when I was fourteen.\"\n\n(ee).

According to Jean Murphy, he had at 6 children, 16 grandchildren and 6 great grandchildren at the time of his death.\n\nFrom Calvin Murphy II: \"My father was one of those young men who went to the post office on Monday, 8 December 1941 and lied about his age to get into the war. He claimed to be 16 and that meant he was drafted into the Navy in 1943. He fought in some of the closing battles of World War II, like Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and later in the Korean conflict. During his 19 years and 6 months in the Navy, he earned 14 medals, including the Asia-Pacific Campaign medal, Good Conduct, 8 battle medals, and a letter of commendation from President Harry Truman.

On 30 September 1850, Silas Morphew became the postmaster for the Brushy Flat Post Office in Watauga County, N.C., and later was reported to be Postmaster of Rutherwood in Watauga County. Postmaster General records show Silas unsuccessfully bid for several postal routes, including from Greer's Store to Trade, Tennessee and Boone to Gap Creek in 1880.\n\nSilas and Louisa Morphew lived in the following locations:\n\n1850  US Census of Watauga, Watauga County, North Carolina: Silas Morphew 27, farmer without anyone else.\n\n1860  US Census of Blue Ridge, Watauga County: Silas Morphew 36 with Louisa Morphew 26 with Margarett S.

He was living with horse trader and barber in Boone, Watauga County and no wife. Watauga County, (DB 2/392) has a declaration for _ F. Morphew - deceased of McDowell County by his administrator M. F. Morphew. The first initial of _ F. Morphew is unreadable. This involved Alice Morphew, a minor who was under the guardianship of R. L. Nichols and involved 2 tracts of land. Alice is likely to be their daughter.\n\nAs a lawyer, J. F. Morphew has several impressive records. Google Books report him representing cases in (1) 1896 North Carolina Supreme Court, (2) 1887 US Circuit Court and (3) 1898 United States Supreme Court!\n\n(iii).

Thank you James!\n\nThings we know for sure, as well as can be remembered, from what I was told, so it must be true. Around 1905, James McDonald Morphew built a house on a couple of hundred acres on the south bank of the south fork of New River, near Brownwood (a 1-store corner), a few miles from Todd, all in Ashe County, NC, to impress his new (lastest) 3rd wife, and get her out of the rain. He and his wife, Ruth Goodman Morphew, raised 5 children in the house, by the river, and the railroad tracks.\n\nIn 1919, the youngest, William, age 5, passed away from an unknown, sudden sickness. William is buried there in the Morphew-Gentry cemetery, with ancestors going back at least to the early 1800s (some stones are unreadable). The Riverside house still stands, new red, surrounded by a wonderful ridge-top subdivision. Had he known, he would have kept the land. The death of William so saddened his mother that the family sold the Riverside estate in 1919 or 20, and moved north 15 miles to Beaver Creek (near West Jefferson) where her (Goodman) family owned much of the valley, and still does, along with a few other Ashe County important families (just ask them). Ruth Morphew was with child at the time, making the move by horse and wagon all the more enjoyable.\n\nIn 1920, she gave birth to her youngest, Paul, said to be a bit indulged, as the youngest by 9 years. In 1925, James M., Ruth and the family built a house on the west edge of the County Seat of Jefferson (which is 2 miles from West Jefferson, but far superior, unless, of course, you are from West Jefferson), near where James had opened a country store, and kept a farm. They remained in Jefferson until they passed, James in 1946 and Ruth in 1959.\n\nChildren of James MacDonald Morphew and 1st wife Naoma M. Michael:\n\n(a).

Paul Everett Morphew (18 October 1920 to 15 February 1998 and buried at Jefferson Cemetery, Jefferson, Ashe County) ^^\n\nIrene remained in Jefferson, taking a job at the Post Office in the mid-30s, at the suggestion of her family for reasons unknown (possibly a discount on Stamps?), becoming Post Mistress of Jefferson in 1939, which scared the daylights out of her. (We have the Commission, signed by FDR). So scared was Irene that she only lasted until 1978, and still enjoys one of those inflation-adjusted Fed pension that we hear about. Irene just celebrated 101st birthday last September 2012. Ah, but she drank little and never smoked in public.\n\nAll four boys  Glen, Howard, John and Paul moved to Detroit in the 1920s and 30s, where the money was, and they didnt have to steal from their fathers cash register. All the sons of James M. are now passed. Howard in the 1970s, John in 1985, Glen in the 90s, and Paul in 1998. All took to smoking and drinking a healthy, early ages and continued well into their sixties and seventies, except Glen, who quit smoking after a heart attack for some unknown reason, and was punished by living much longer.\n\nPaul Morphew (1920-1998) and Iris managed to have two lovely children while meandering around Detroit for 45 years. In Detroit, nobody stayed in Detroit, but nearby. Paul, the indulged youngest, retired from Ford Motor in 1980, and moved with his Northern wife (Iris Carpenter Morphew of Wellington, Ohio) back to Ashe County, up on Big Horse Creek, Northwest of Lansing, up a creek, as it were. Lansing is some 10 miles from Jefferson, population 200 in the 1980 census, allowing for the occasional absence from Church. Paul and Iris and various mutts relaxed on Horse Creek entertaining any relatives that stopped by, and could find it. Paul passed in 1998 and is buried in Jefferson, it being a smaller hill than the Morphew-Gentry ridge. Iris moved closer to West Jefferson, with many thanks from the other drivers between Big Horse Creek and Jefferson.\n\n^ Quoted family information is from James P.

John Grub was born 19 April 1818 and died 20 September 1890 with both buried at Morphew-Gentry Cemetery, Watauga County. In 1870, they lived in Stony Fork/St. Ony Fork Township, Watauga County, North Carolina. They had the following children: (i) Cyrus A. Grubb (17 December 1844 N.C. to 28 November 1919), (ii) Mary L. Grubb (1852/53 N.C.), (iii) Ellen Grubb (1859/60 N.C.), (iv) Margaret E.

Sarah (Sally) Morphew (5 January 1840 to (probably) 20 June 1903) did not marry, was a weaver, and was living with her mother in 1860 Watauga County, North Carolina, and later with her brother Levi Morphew in 1880 and 1900. The Morphew-Gentry Cemetery has a gravestone for a Sarah Morphew, who died June 20, 1903.\n\n(11).
