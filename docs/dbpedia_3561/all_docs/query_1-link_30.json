Bryan, 11 Sep 1872 - 22 Jul 1950.\n\nRoscoe M. Slaton was the son of Mandy Slaton and a Mr. Fairchild, but Roscoe was raised by Mandy and her husband Silas Bryan. Mandy and Mr. Fairchild never married. Mandy wanted to marry him, but her mother (Mary Anne Moore) wouldn't let her. Mandy tried to force the issue by getting pregnant, but her mother still wouldn't let her marry Mr. Fairchild. (information from Lynn Alvin Slaton)\n\nUpon learning of her pregnancy, Mandy's father beat her unmercifully. (information from Jack McCampbell, story told to him by his mother Ollie C. Free who the daughter of Mandy's sister Rebecca Slaton.)\n\n(Maybe William W) Fairchild2,28,40, son of Oliver Fairchild and Martha Clowers, was born about 1871 in [Tennessee]. His given name, his birth date, and his birth place are all just guesses. Even his surname is debatable, since it is known only from oral family history.\n\nAmanda Melzina (Mandy) Slaton and (maybe William W) Fairchild had the following children:\n\n103\n\ni.\n\nRoscoe Moore Slaton3,28,76,77,78 was born on 17 July 1891 in Dandridge, Jefferson County, Tennessee.76 Roscoe's birth place comes from his World War I military record. (RGB)\n\nHe appeared in the census in 1900 in Sevier County, Tennessee. Slaton Roscoe 5 Sson m s w Jul 1894 TN TN TN.\n\nHe was missing from the census in 1910. He may have been missed in the census because of serving on active duty in the army at the time.\n\n76 He sailed from the Canal Zone in Panama to New York: S.S. Colon, sailing from Cristobal, C.Z., Sept. 15th, 1915, arriving at port of New York, Sept. 26th, 1915, Slaton, Roscoe M., age 24, male, single, born Danbrdige (sic), Tenn., July 17th, 1891, resides Dandridge, Tenn.\n\nRoscoe died on 4 February 1917 at the age of 25 in Duval County, Florida.77 He was in the military, but he died from the flu rather than from military service. Florida Death Index Information: Name: Roscoe M Slaton; Death Date: 1919; County of Death: Duval; State of Death: Florida; Race: White; Gender: Male. There is a discrepancy between family records that indicate that he died in 1919 and the death index that indicates that he died in 1919. The death index may be correct, especially given that there was a flu epidemic in 1919.\n\nHe was buried on 8 February 1917 at Shady Grove Cemetery in Jefferson County, Tennessee. Sgt AM Casual Det Group One.\n\nRoscoe Moore Slaton was the son of Amanda Melzina (Mandy) Slaton and Mr. Fairchild. Mandy's mother was opposed to the marriage, and either prevented it, or else caused it to end in divorce or annulment. Mandy later married Silas Amberson Bryan who was my g grandfather's brother, and Roscoe was raised by Mandy and Silas.\n\nMr. Fairchild was an engineer, and Roscoe inherited some of his father's abilities. Roscoe spent considerable time at sea, and wrote to his mother about developing a ship-to-shore radio. Roscoe's tombstone says Sgt AM Casual Det Group One. The index of World War I soldiers at the Tennessee State Library and Archives says that he served in the U.S. Navy. That index is the only source I have for Roscoe's middle name. At the time of his death, he was working in Jacksonville, Florida around the shipyards.\n\nAmanda Melzina (Mandy) Slaton and Silas Amberson Bryan were married on 11 November 1895 in Jefferson County, Tennessee.\n\nSilas Amberson Bryan70,71,79,80,81,82,83,84, son of William Allen Bryan and Malissa E.
