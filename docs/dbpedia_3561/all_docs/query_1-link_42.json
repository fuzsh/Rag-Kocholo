Julia lived about 20-5 years with him.ï¿½ He then married Permelia (Goodrum) who had much land and goods and 9 children by Mr. Goodrum.ï¿½ She had Shephard sign a 20+ page Pre-nupt.ï¿½ At age 70, June 1900 Census,ï¿½she is Permelia Stone with the Goodrum children.ï¿½ No Shephard, she is a widow.

He was born ca 1811; died ca. 1852 in Tallapoosa County, Alabama.\n\nG. F. Stone was enumerated in the 1840 census of Calhoun County, Florida. The household was recorded: 1 male 20-30, 1 female 15-20. In the first statewide election on 26 May 1845, G. F. Stone voted at Ochesee, Jackson County, Florida. G. F.
