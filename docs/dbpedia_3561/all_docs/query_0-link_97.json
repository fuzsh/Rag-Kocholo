FISHERWILMINGTON STAMP AND PRINTING COMPANYPublishers WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA MCMXXIX\n\n“CHARACTER is as important to a state [city or county] as to individuals,” and that estimate is ∽ ∽ chiefly based upon the achievement and conduct of its citizens.\n\n—Wheeler\n\nGeo Davis\n\nGEORGE DAVIS\n\nAmong all the great men who have adorned the annals of North Carolina, no one deserves to take precedence of George Davis, whose virtues rendered him illustrious, while his abilities, culture and public services gained for him an eminence that no other North Carolinian has enjoyed. * * * He was admired for his learning and his talent, beloved for his personal excellence and venerated for his patriotism and for the exalted sentiments which animated him in every walk of life. * * * He particularly was distinguished as a scholar, an able lawyer, for his decided convictions, severe integrity and high sense of right and honor, while as an orator, he probably had no equal in the United States.—Samuel A. Ashe.\n\nGEORGE DAVIS, born in New Hanover County, March 1, 1820, died in Wilmington, February 23, 1896, probably brought greater distinction to North Carolina, as statesman, patriot, scholar and orator, than any other son of this great old commonwealth. His outstanding services as a citizen have left an undying impress upon his native city and state and his patriotism in the statesmanship of the Confederacy aroused the admiration and developed the close personal friendship of the illustrious Davis and the more illustrious Robert E. Lee.\n\nOf a family stock that dated back to the earliest settlements in the two Carolinas, Sir John Yeamans and James Moore, he loved all things American and especially he loved the American Union. Throughout the perilous days preceding the Confederacy, he sought, by every honorable means, to effect an agreement between the North and South that might prevent secession and civil strife, with all the horrors of such a conflict. He was one of the delegates to the Peace Congress, in Washington, in 1861, and, during the same month, at Montgomery, Ala., where the Confederate government was established a few days before Lincoln's inauguration. In June, of that year, he was chosen as one of North Carolina's senators in the Confederate Congress, at Richmond, and was re-elected in 1862. In January, 1864, he became Attorney-General in President Davis’ Cabinet, in which position he remained until the Confederacy crumbled, April 26, 1865, at Charlotte, to which city the Southern government was removed following Lee's surrender.\n\nThen came Lincoln's assassination and the North's delirium in its vengeance cry for the blood of President Davis and the members of his Cabinet. Mr. Davis first sought refuge at the home of his brother, Bishop Thomas F. Davis, of the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina. Later, he went to Florida and eventually attempted escape to British soil in an old abandoned boat. After a harrowing and dangerous experience on the seas, he landed at Key West, submitted to arrest and was sent as a prisoner to Fort Hamilton. He finally was released on parole agreement not to leave North Carolina.\n\nUpon his return to Wilmington, he reopened his law offices and began the practice of law in an effort to retrieve the fortune he had lost during the war. He continued active practice for thirty years and during that time appeared as counsel in some of the most important litigation in the legal annals of the Lower Cape Fear. He was the legal adviser in the organization of the Wilmington & Weldon Railroad (now part of the Atlantic Coast Line) and handled its affairs with such admirable accuracy that it always was free from legal embarrassments. He was employed, together with Judge Thomas Ruffin, to advise the legislature in the matter of the sale of the Western North Carolina Railroad and his work in that case is described by a North Carolina historian as “a marvel of skill.” In 1878, he was offered the appointment of Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, but declined, perhaps the only instance in the history of the state, that he might continue in private practice and make adequate and proper provision for his family.\n\nOn November 17, 1842, he married Mary A. Polk, daughter of Gen. Thomas Polk, of Mecklenburg County and great-granddaughter of Thomas Polk, one of the signers of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. Of this marriage was born the late Junius Davis, who also became one of the best known citizens and lawyers of his generation and whose biographical history appears in this volume. Mary Polk Davis died in 1863. On May 9, 1866, he married Miss Monimia Fairfax, of Richmond, Va., to whom he became engaged while Attorney-General of the Confederacy.\n\nHistorians and biographers, including Hume, Ashe and others, allot great space to the life and achievements of this great Wilmingtonian, according him a high rank\n\namong the notable men of the Southland. His home city, grateful for his constructive service as a citizen, has erected a bronze statue to his memory. The late Dr. Sprunt, in his “Chronicles of the Lower Cape Fear,” describes him as “a beloved leader whose memory will continue with increasing veneration.” The late Dr. T. B. Kingsbury, famous editor of the Wilmington Star during the dismal Reconstruction period, compared him with Pericles, Cicero, Burke, Fox and Sheridan, in appearance, in patriotism and effective oratory and Edward Everett wrote in his diary that “he (Davis) had no peer in eloquence and logic.” The widow of President Jefferson Davis, in a letter to Dr. Sprunt, wrote: “Mr. Davis’ public life was irreproachable” and “my husband felt for him the most sincere friendship as well as confidence and esteem,” while General Lee loved him with all the pure affections possible to that great heart and a short time before his death was a guest at the Davis home in Wilmington. Louis T. Moore, student of men and events in the Lower Cape Fear, in an article, “George Davis: Citizen of Wilmington,” says:\n\n“Among those who brought honor and glory to his native state, an outstanding figure is the Hon. George Davis, of Wilmington. As Attorney-General of the Southern Confederacy, he held the love and esteem of President Jefferson Davis and of Gen. Robert E. Lee; as a peerless and eloquent orator, he occupied a place peculiarly his own; as a learned and distinguished lawyer, his counsel and guidance were always sought; as one whom the state wished to honor in life, he probably stands alone in having declined the high position of the State Supreme Court, which consideration for the maintenance of his family forced him to do; and last, but not least, as a true gentleman and Christian, his life was such as to indelibly impress itself upon the community and state in which he lived.”\n\nPREFACE\n\nThe great English historian, Macaulay, one of the most brilliant minds of the last century, said: “The history of a country is best told in a record of the lives of its people.” In conformity with this idea, the “Biographical Sketches of Wilmington Citizens” has been prepared. Instead of going to musty tomes and taking therefrom dry statistical matter that can be appreciated but by few, I have gone to the leading citizens of this fine old city, assembled the data descriptive of their individual lives and am submitting, through biographical sketches, an accurate portrayal of Wilmington's consequence at this time. No more interesting or instructive book could be presented to the public of this section. Each narrative is a romance in itself. Some have maintained a mangnificent family tradition, born into culture and wealth, they have added to the heritages of generations; others, with limited advantages, but through industry, careful economy and native ability, have risen into notable influence; also this volume tells how that many in the pride and strength of young manhood left the store, the bank, factory, railroad office and every trade and profession and, at their country's call, went forth valiantly across the seas to sacrifice their lives in the cause of freedom for all mankind—these Wilmington young men became a mighty part of the greatest, most genuinely idealistic and most successful army ever mobilized in all the military annals of the world. The life of every man in this volume should be read with the most careful consideration. Each is an examplar of good citizenship, of accomplishment and all constitute a class of men, the type of which has been responsible for every step in the tedious progress of human liberty and advancement since civilization began. Wilmington is and always has been peculiarly fortunate in the remarkable caliber of its leading citizens. Its first colonists were sturdy, cultural and brave and included in their list governors, jurists, military chieftains and outstanding statesmen and patriots. Two citizens of Wilmington attended the Constitutional convention at Philadelphia and one became a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Local environ has produced two notably distinguished admirals of the American navy and one world-famous President of the United States once lived here. In art, America's greatest painter boasted a family connection with this city and the present ruling prima donna is a native. This volume contains the summary of the life of a president of one of the greatest railway systems in America; of another, whose philanthropic generosity has caused his memory to be beloved by every one in this entire section; one whose forensic ability and statesmanship attracted national recognition during the nation's most dangerous crisis; another whose huge heart and splendid mind created and perfected a boys’ organization that has built character and developed some of the best known citizens in the South; and still another whose genius for colonization has reclaimed millions of acres and received the commendation of peoples in two hemispheres. The present spirit of Wilmington is the same as it was almost two hundred years ago when the original settlers helped to lay the foundation of a nation destined to become the mightiest on earth; the same spirit that forcibly resisted an unjust tax assessed by a foolish monarch a decade before the Boston Tea Party; the identical spirit that caused Fort Fisher to be the last of the Confederate strongholds to crumble before an unparalleled assault by land and sea; and the same spirit that has met every demand in the past for valor in defense of meritorius causes. Had Wilmington with its illustrious history been located in some northern section, its glories would have been perpetuated in song and story more impelling, more courageous and more in the fitness of things than the dashing tales of the Reveres, the tea tax resistance in a New England harbor, Sheridan's ride down the Shenandoah and scores of other “inspirations” for paens in prose and rhyme. Sherman's march was less brave than the resistance offered it, yet this heroic resistance remains to this day unsung. Coming generations will appreciate this volume and treasure it because it contains so much that would never find its way into public records and which otherwise would be inaccessible. Great care has been taken in its compilation and every opportunity possible given to those represented to insure correctness in what has been written and I earnestly believe I give to the readers a work with few errors of consequence. Before concluding I especially desire to thank Mr. J. O. Carr, Colonel Walker Taylor and Mr. George B. Elliott with whom I first discussed the publication of this book; to Louis T. Moore, Thomas W. Davis, Lamont Smith, Fred E. Little, W. R. Yopp and the secretaries of the various organizations which are reviewed in the last pages of this volume. Also various histories have been consulted and copiously copied, particularly Dr. James Sprunt's “Chronicles of the Cape Fear.”\n\n—R. H. FISHER\n\nDATA ABOUT THE CITY OF WILMINGTON\n\nCollaborated by\n\nLOUIS T. MOORE\n\nExecutive Secretary Wilmington Chamber of Commerce\n\nWe, of the present day, are so imbued with the notion of this being an age of progress and enlightenment, as compared with its predecessors, that we very frequently either altogether deride the attainments and performances of our forefathers, as being unworthy of our attention, or regard them with such a cold patronizing glance, that our approval of them is rather an insult than an honor to their memory. And yet there are times when this self laudation is not only ill-timed, but unfounded; when it would contribute much more to our present benefit, if we thought how little, rather than how much we had progressed, and considered, that, while running more speedily than our predecessors, we may be on an entirely different line, instead of the direct roadway which they were pursuing. It would be well, then, if everyone were, at least, familiar with the leading events connected with the history and early settlement of the community in which he resides, and had some knowledge of the character of the people to whom the civilization of today is much indebted.\n\nOf all the departments of intelligent research, the study of historical events is certainly the most interesting, having attractions peculiarly its own. The student of human nature here finds the lives of all kinds of men, the circumstances that led to the formation of their characters, and the influence they exerted upon their contemporaries and their posterity. The student of prophecy here finds the data upon which his surmises regarding the unforseen future must be built. Gathering together the tangled webs of the past, and looking at their issues, he has some guide as to what is likely to spring from the events going on around him, and a clue to the movements and changes to which in turn these will give rise.\n\nThe voluminousness of historic detail, however, brings with it one or two serious drawbacks—one is, that it is impossible to overtake all history, and it is therefore, needful to confine one's attention to a comparatively limited portion of it. It would be impossible, for instance, to write a complete history of the world for a single year—for no building could contain the books that would have to be written—a lifetime would not suffice to write it—a lifetime would not be long enough in which to read it.\n\nRecognizing the full force of what we have said, and, also, that “brevity is the soul of wit”—as well as having a due regard for the purposes with which this volume is published—we content ourselves with endeavoring to present, in as concise a shape as we may, some few of the principal events of the past history of the city of Wilmington, trusting that we may be able to make, at least, some slight record of those early times so pregnant of the city's future greatness and importance, as well as of her latter days of permanent and assured prosperity.\n\nBefore proceeding at once with our subject, it would, perhaps prove of interest to our readers to know that there are many who contend that the name of the majestic river, to which Wilmington owes her existence as a city, should be called by another name: That is to say, that Cape Fear should be Cape Fair. It is said that the name was originally so given because its surroundings presented to the early adventurers so fair and attractive an appearance. It is, furthermore, stated by some authorities that neither the cape nor the river were ever called by the present name until after 1750, and never officially until 1780. The preponderance of evidence, however, is strongly in favor of the existing name as against the more attractive appellation. The word was unquestionably often spelled “Fair”, and there is therefore, some foundation for the controversy. The true explanation of the apparent misnomer is, doubtless, to be found in the fact, that in those days a most startling latitude and license in the matter of spelling was universally allowed and most recklessly indulged in—every man, being as it were, his own Webster. Plantation was “plantacon”; proposals were “proposealls;” grant was grannte;” engage, “inguaige;” growth, “groathe,” and so on ad infinitum.\n\nIn pursuing this inquiry, it must be borne in mind that it is to the name of the cape, and not that of the river, that investigation must be directed, as for nearly a hundred years the cape bore its name before the river was known to history.\n\nIn De Bry's map of Lane's expedition, 1585, although no name is given to the cape, the two latin words “promontorium tremendum,” sufficiently attest the knowledge of its location and dangerous existence. In the narrative of Sir Richard Grenville's first expedition in the same year, the following entry is read for the month of June, 1585: “The 23rd we were in great danger of a wreck, on a breach called the Cape of Fear”. Again, two years later, in the narrative of White's first voyage, we are told that in July, 1587, “had not Captain Stafford been more careful in looking out than our Simon Fernando, we had all been cast away upon the breach called the Cape of Fear.” It will be observed that in those days a “breach” constituted a beach.\n\nThe river at first bore a different name, being called Charles river, and it was some time after 1663, that it took the name of the cape, and was called Cape Fear River. The first settlement on what is now Cape Fear River, was made in 1659, or 1660, but it was abandoned in 1663. In the same year one of the first acts of the Lords Proprietors of the Colonies, after receiving the liberal grant from the Crown, was to publish an important document, denominated the “Declaration and Proposealls to all y't will plant in Carolina.” It was published in August, 1663, and one of the first results effected was during the autumn of 1665, when Sir John Yeamans, with a colony of men from Barbadoes, sailed into Cape Fear River in search of a site for a settlement.\n\nIt was one of the strict requirements of the “Proposealls” of the Lords Proprietors that for every fifty acres of land granted there should always be one man “armed with a good firelock musket, performed boare, 12 bullets to ye pound, and with 20 pounds of powder and 20 pounds of bullets.” That is what colonization meant in those days. It was not so much against the Indians, however, as it was against the pirates, who infested the coast, and the Spaniards in Florida, that these precautions were necessarily taken. It was probably through fear of the latter that the Lords Proprietors were so anxious that settlements should be made to the westward of Cape Fear in order that the North and the South Provinces might the more readily afford each other mutual aid and protection. However that may be, the first condition in the “Proposealls” was: “If ye colony will settle on the Charles River, near Cape Feare, wch seems to be desired, it shall be free for them soe to doe, in ye larboard side entering. If in any other parte, of ye Terrytory, then to chose eithr side, if by a rivr.”\n\nThis “Terrytory,” on both sides of the Cape Fear River, early was formed into a county, 1728, and called New Hanover in honor of the House of Hanover, then on the English throne. While its present boundaries are Duplin County, on the North; Onslow County, East; Atlantic Ocean, South; and by the Cape Fear and South Rivers on the West, separating it from Brunswick and Bladen, at that time it included what now is all of New Hanover and a part of Brunswick Counties. However, because of the peculiar situation of New Hanover County, its narrow peninsular confines and the condition of the soil, the history of the county always has centered in the history of its principal settlement, first Brunswick and later, Wilmington.\n\nIn its early years, records show, Brunswick County was in Carteret Precinct (County), which was established in 1722 and ran down the coast to the unknown confines of North Carolina, and back into the wilderness without limitation. New Hanover, under the rearrangement in 1728, embraced the territory now in Duplin, Sampson, Bladen and Brunswick Counties. It was not until shortly before the Revolution, or in 1764, that Brunswick was formed from the counties of Bladen and New Hanover. Brunswick, incidentally, derives its name from the Prince of Brunswick, who, in 1764, married the British King's eldest daughter.\n\nThe organization of counties, naturally, followed the founding of settlements. Consequently, settlements flourished along the lower Cape Fear River, prior to the organization of New Hanover County. Brunswick settlement, destined in time to yield to Liverpool, then Newton, then Wilmington, antedated the establishment of New Hanover County by many years. This was in the regular course of events. The colonists were empowered to fortify the mouth of the river, and were presented by the King with twelve pieces of cannon and a considerable amount of ammunition for that purpose. Agreeably to the terms and stipulations contained in the “Proposealls,” Sir John and his men landed on the west side of the river, selected a site, and laid the foundation of a town. In honor of the reigning King, it was called Charleston, or as it was at first, and for years afterward written, Charles Town.\n\nAmong historians there has been much doubt and uncertainty as to the exact place selected, but tradition has fixed the spot beyond dispute. It was at, or near the junction of Old Town Creek with the river, about eight miles below Wilmington, on the\n\nwest side of the river, an evidence of this may be found, if any were wanting, in the fact that just before the Civil War, an old cannon was found, deeply imbedded in the earth, and almost devoured by rust, at this spot.\n\nThe town “assumed immediate importance, and in less than two years numbered eight hundred souls; and built up an important trade with the West Indies, particularly in timber and staves”. And such was the desire for emigration to it from Barbadoes that the Legislature there felt called upon to pass an act prohibiting “the spiriting people off the Island”. Its prosperity, however, was but temporary, and it soon began to decline. It can now only be conjectured what caused its decay. At any rate in 1671 Sir John was appointed to succeed Governor Sayle, and together with most of the colonists, sailed for Port Royal in the Southern Province, and afterwards removed to the neck of land between Ashley and Cooper Rivers, and founded the present city of Charleston, S. C. Many of his descendants are still living.\n\nThe new town afterward went totally out of existence, and it is conjectured that what few inhabitants it had left founded the old town of Brunswick, a few miles down the river. Brunswick was situated on the west bank of the Cape Fear, some sixteen miles below the present City of Wilmington, at the place afterwards known as Fort Anderson, which was the scene, during the late War between the States, of one of the most terrific bombardments known in the history of modern warfare.\n\nOur first authentic knowledge of Brunswick begins about 1720. In 1725, Colonel Maurice Moore, a grandson of Sir John Yeamans, received from the Lords Proprietors a grant of 1500 acres of land on the west side of the river, and proceeded to lay off a town on its most eligible site, which he called Brunswick. Emigration rapidly set in. Many gentlemen, we are told, came here from both Carolina and Virginia and others from England. In the same year, also, a number of educated gentlemen, disgusted with the despotic laws of New England, settled here. It was from ancestors such as these that many of the most illustrious names in the history of this section were handed down to the present day.\n\nThe exposed roadstead of Brunswick, and the discovery that its harbor was unsafe for such crafts as were then in use for bringing produce from the upper rivers, necessitated a further exploration up the line of the river for the purpose of securing a more suitable place for the reception and shipment of the produce then constituting the principal articles of export from this part of the Province. The present site of the City of Wilmington was determined upon as the best for the purpose required.\n\nAccordingly, in 1730, the first settlement was made, a village was laid out, and wharves and buildings first erected. It was called New Liverpool. In 1732, a survey having been made for the purpose of laying it out as a town, the settlement was called Newton, or New Town. In 1735, John Watson received a grant for 640 acres of land, situated on the east side of the Cape Fear River, and including the village or town of Newton.\n\nIn 1739, through the influence of Gabriel Johnston, then Governor of the Province, the name of Newton was changed, by Legislative enactment, to Wilmington, in honor of his patron, Spencer Compton, Earl of Wilmington. From this time forward, the town of Wilmington grew rapidly in wealth and population, while the old town of Brunswick sank into obscurity and decay. Brunswick was finally abandoned. It is believed by some that Brunswick was burned by the British during the War of the Revolution, but that Wilmington had previously absorbed almost the entire population.\n\nIt was near Brunswick, that, on the 8th of August, 1775, Josiah Martin, the last Colonial Governor of North Carolina, fulminated his proclamation against the famous Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence, the Governor at the time, being on board H. M. Ship Cruiser, whither he had fled from the righteous indignation of the people.\n\nThe only vestiges of Brunswick now remaining are the walls of old St. Philip's Church, which was built, about 1729, of brick imported from England. The walls are two feet thick, and apparently strong enough to stand another century or more of exposure. It is, by the way, a somewhat memorable circumstance that during the terrific bombadment of Fort Anderson, during the Civil War, by the Federal fleet, on the day and night of February 18th, 1865, not a shell, or even the fragment of a shell, struck the old church, although its walls frowned upon the war vessels from the immediate rear of Anderson.\n\nDr. James Sprunt, in his “Cape Fear Chronicles” quotes from Swann's Collections\n\nof Public Acts, the Act of Incorporation passed by the Assembly in 1739, “erecting the village called Newton, in New Hanover County, into a town and township, by the name of Wilmington; and regulating and ascertaining the bounds thereof.” The Act is signed by Gabriel Johnston, governor; William Smith, president; and John Hodgson, speaker. It follows:\n\nSection 1. Whereas, several merchants, tradesmen, artificers and other persons of good substance, have settled themselves at a village called Newton, lying on the east branch of the Cape Fear; and whereas, the said village by reason of its convenient situation at the meeting of the two great branches of Cape Fear River, and likewise, by reason of the depth of the water, capable of receiving vessels of considerable burthen, safety of its roads beyond any other part of the river and the secure and easy access from all parts of the different branches of the said river, is, upon those and many other accounts, more proper for being erected into a town or township than any other part of said river.\n\nSection 2. Be it therefore enacted by His Excellency, Gabriel Johnston, Esq., Governor, by and with the advice and consent of His Majesty's Council and General Assembly of this province, and it is hereby enacted, by the authority of the same, that the village heretofore called Newton, lying on the east side of the Northeast branch of Cape Fear River, in New Hanover County, shall, from and after the passage of this Act, be a town and township, and the said village is hereby established a town and township by the name of Wilmington, the bounds whereof shall be and are circumscribed in manner following: That is to say, to the northeast by the lands of His Excellency Gabriel Johnston, Esq., upwards and below, by the lands of Michael Dyer; to the westward by the northeast branch of Cape Fear River; and to the eastward by a line drawn between the said lands of His Excellency Gabriel Johnston, Esq., and Michael Dyer, one hundred and twenty poles distant from the river.\n\nSection 3. And be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that forever after passing of this Act, the inhabitants of near the said town, qualified as hereinafter mention shall have the privilege of choosing one representative for the said town, to sit and vote in the General Assembly.\n\nSection 4. And for ascertaining the method of choosing the said representative, be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that every tenant of any brick, stone or framed inhabitable house, of the length of twenty feet, and sixteen feet wide, within the bounds of the said town, who at the day of election, and for three months next before, inhabited such house, shall be entitled to vote in the election for the representative of the said town, to be sent to the General Assembly, and in case there shall be no tenant of such house in the said town, on the day of election, qualified to vote as aforesaid, that then, and in such case, the person seized of such house, either in fee-simple, or fee-tail, or for term of life, shall be entitled to vote for the Representative aforesaid.\n\nSection 5. And be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that every person who, on the day of election, and for three months next before, shall be in actual possession or an inhabitant of a brick house, of the length of thirty feet, and sixteen feet wide, between the bounds of the said town upwards, and Smith Creek, and within one hundred twenty poles of the northeast branch of Cape Fear River, shall be entitled to, and have a vote in the election of a Representative for the said town (unless such person be a servant), and shall, as long as he continues an inhabitant of such house, within the said bounds, enjoy all the rights, privileges and immunities, to which any inhabitant within the said town shall be entitled, by virtue of said Act.\n\nSection 6. And be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that no person shall be deemed qualified to be a Representative for the said town, to sit in the General Assembly, unless, on the day of election, he be, and for three months next before, was seized, in fee-simple, or for the term of life, of a brick, stone or framed house of the dimensions aforesaid, with one or more brick chimney or chimnies.\n\nSection 7. And be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that forever, after the passing of this Act, the court of the county of New Hanover, and the election of the Representatives to be sent to the General Assembly, and the election of Vestrymen and all other public elections, of what kind or nature soever, for the said county and town, shall be held and made in the town of Wilmington, and at no other place whatsoever, any law, statute, usage or custom, to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nSection 8. And be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that from and after the passage of this Act, the Collector and Naval Officers of the port of Brunswick (of which port the said town of Wilmington is the most central and convenient place, both for exportation and importation by reason of its navigation and situation), shall constantly reside in the said town, and there keep their respective offices, until His Majesty shall be pleased to give his directions to the contrary. And likewise, the clerk of the court of the county of New Hanover, and the register of the said county, shall constantly hold and execute their respective offices in the said town of Wilmington; and that if either of the said officers shall neglect or refuse so to do, he so neglecting or refusing, shall, for every month he shall be a delinquent, forfeit and pay the sum of five pounds proclamation money; to be sued for and recovered, by him who shall sue for the same, in the general court of this Province, or in the county court of New Hanover, by action of debt, bill, plaint, or information, wherein no essoin, protecyion, injunction or wager of law shall be allowed, and one half of such forfeiture shall be for the use of the person who sues for the same, and the other half shall be paid to the commissioners for the time being, appointed for regulating the said town.\n\nSection 9. And for the due regulating of the said town, be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that Robert Halton, James Murray, Samuel Woodard, William Farris, Richard Eagles, John Porter and Robert Walker, Esquires, are hereby established and appointed commissioners for the said town; and the said commissioners, or a majority of them, and their successors shall have, and be invested with all powers and authorities within the bounds of the said town of Wilmington, in as full and ample manner, as the commissioners for the town of Edenton have or possess, by virtue of any law heretofore passed.\n\nSection 10. And whereas the justices of the county court of New Hanover, at the court held at Brunswick, on Tuesday, the eleventh day of December last, have imposed a tax of five shillings per poll, to be levied on the tihable inhabitants of the said county, between the first day of January, and the first day of March, one thousand seven hundred and thirty-nine; and afterwards, one other tax of five shillings per poll to be levied on the said inhabitants, between the first day of January and the first day of March, one thousand seven hundred and forty, towards building a court house and gaol in the town of Brunswick, for the said county.\n\nSection 11. Be it enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that the justices of the said county court, shall, and are hereby directed to apply the said levy or tax towards finishing and completing the courthouse already erected in the said town of Wilmington, and towards building a gaol in the said town.\n\nSection 12. And be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that if any one or more of the said commissioners shall die, or remove out of the county, that then and in such case, the surviving or remaining commissioners shall, within six months after the death or removal of such commissioner, present to His Excellency, the Governor or Commander-in-Chief for the time being, three persons, one of which the said Governor or Commander-in-Chief is hereby empowered to nominate and appoint; and the commissioners so appointed shall be invested with the same powers and authorities, as any commissioner nominated by this Act.\n\nIn 1738, the Parish of St. James embraced the whole of New Hanover County. At that period there was no parish church, and in 1747, the Court House was used as a place of worship. During this year the lot upon which the Church of St. James now stands was presented to the Parish by Michael Wihgins, on which the first church was afterward erected. It was nineteen years in course of construction, and when finished was a huge structure of brick, without ornament, but of most ample accommodation within. It gave place in 1839, to the present more commodious and elegant structure.\n\nAn interesting incident in the history of this church is worthy of mention in connection with the city's history. In 1749, a number of Spanish privateers, availing themselves of the defenseless position of Cape Fear, entered the harbor and committed a number of depredations upon the inhabitants. The people hastily collected and attacked them. During the action one of the pirate vessels was blown up and captured, and a number of valuables were taken from the wreck. The proceeds of this property were afterward applied to the building of the churches of St. Philips and St. James at Brunswick and Wilmington. Among other acts of the General Assembly of North\n\nCarolina, will be found one passed, in 1760, authorizing a lottery to raise money to build the church of St. James Parish at Wilmington, and appropriating part of the effects of this vessel to the same object. Modern lottery companies are here presented with a precedent as to the righteousness of their undertakings.\n\nAmong the many valuable things found in this pirate ship was an “Ecce Homo”, a painting of the Saviour in one of the scenes of his passion as described in St. John XIX, 5. This fine painting is still preserved in the vestry room of St. James Church, and constitutes an historical and venerable attraction which brings many visitors to Wilmington. It is assumed that the painting came into possession of the pirates following one of their marauding descents upon the South American coast or an attack upon the West Indian Islands.\n\nColonial life was lively and substantial, along the Lower Cape Fear, throughout the period between the settlement of Brunswick and the beginning of the Revolution, nearly fifty years. Col. Alfred Moore Waddell, who like Dr. John Hampden Hill and, later Dr. James Sprunt, interested themselves purely as a matter of love in recording the early annals of this region, describes the life of the planters in his “A Colonial Officer and His Times,” as follows:\n\n“In the Southern end of the Province, at Brunswick and Wilmington, and along the Cape Fear, there was an equally refined and cultivated society and some very remarkable men. No better society existed in America, and it is but simple truth to say that for classical learning, wit, oratory and varied accomplishments, no generation of their successors has equaled them.\n\n“Their hospitality was boundless and proverbial, and of the manner in which it was enjoyed there can be no counterpart in the present age. Some of them had town residences, but most of them lived on their plantations, and they were not the thriftless characters that by some means it became fashionable to assume all Southern planters were. There was much gaity and festivity among them, and some of them rode hard to hounds, but as a general rule they looked after their estates and kept themselves as well informed in regard to what was going on in the world as the limited means of communication allowed. There was little display, but in almost every house could be found valuable plate, and, in some, excellent libraries. The usual mode of travel was on horseback, and in gigs, or chairs, which were vehicles without springs but hung on heavy straps, and to which one horse, and sometimes by young beaux two horses, tandem, were driven; a mounted servant rode behind, or, if the gig was occupied by ladies, beside the horse. The family coach was mounted by three steps, and had great carved leather springs, with baggage rack behind, and a high, narrow driver's seat and box in front. The gentlemen wore clubbed and powdered queues and knee breeches, with buckled low-quartered shoes, and many carried gold or silver snuff-boxes which, being first tapped, were handed with grave courtesy to their acquaintances, when passing the compliments of the day. There are persons still living who remember seeing these things in their early youth. The writer of these lines himself remembers seeing in his childhood the decaying remains of old ‘chairs’ and family coaches, and knew at that time, several old negroes who had been body servants in their youth to the proprietors of these ancient vehicles. It is no wonder that they sometimes drove the coaches four-in-hand. It was not only grand style, but the weight of the vehicle and the character of the roads made it necessary.\n\n“During the period embraced in these pages (early Colonial Period), four wheeled pleasure vehicles were rare, and even two wheeled ones were not common, except among the town nabobs and well-to-do-planters. The coaches, or chariots, as a certain class of vehicles was called, were all imported from England, and the possession of such a means of locomotion was evidence of high social position. It was less than twenty years before the period named, that the first stage wagon in the colonies, in 1738, was run from Trenton to New Brunswick, in New Jersey, twice a week, and the advertisement of it assured the public that it would be fitted up with benches and covered over ‘so that passengers may sit easy and dry.’ ”\n\nIn the “Cape Fear Chronicles” (Dr. Sprunt), are listed some of the prominent lower Cape Fear men and the names of their plantations of Colonial and Revolutionary days. The list includes Governor Burrington, of Governor's Point; Gen. Robert Howe, of Howe's Point; Nathaniel Moore, of York; Governor Arthur Dobbs, of Russellboro; all below what is now the historic Orton plantation: “King” Roger Moore, of Orton; James Smith, of Kendal (now part of Orton); Eleazer Allen, of Lilliput; John Moore,\n\nof Pleasant Oaks; Nathaniel Rice, of Old Town Creek; John Baptista Ashe, of Soring Garden, afterward called Grovely; Chief Justice Hasell, of Belgrange; Schnecking Moore, of Hullsfields; John Davis, of Davis Plantation; John Dalrymple (who commanded Fort Johnston) of Dalrymple Place; John Ancrum, of Old Town; Marsden Campbell, of Clarendon; Richard Eagles, of the Forks, Judge Alfred Moore, of Buchoi; John Waddell, of Bellville; Gov. Benjamin Smith, of Belvidere; all below Wilmington. And continuing further along the river, may be mentioned Cornelius Harnett, at Hilton; John Hill, at Fair Fields; Jehu Davis, Rock Hill; Parker Quince, Rose Hill; John Burgwin, the Hermitage; Dr. Nathaniel Hill, Rocky Run; the Lillingtons of Lillington Hall; Moseleys, Moseley Hall; the Swanns, Cutlars, and others, whose names continue prominent in the life of this section.\n\nIn 1758, sixty persons owned houses in the town of Wilmington, valued in the aggregate at $6,625. In 1762, the population of the place approximated one thousand persons. February 25th, 1760, the citizens were granted a charter erecting Wilmington into an incorporated borough, to consist of a Mayor, a Recorder and eleven Aldermen. John Sampson was chosen Mayor, and Marmaduke Jones, Recorder. Among those elected Aldermen were Cornelius Harnett, Dan Dunhibben, Arthur Mabson, Sam Green and Moses John deRossett. The borough had power to enact its own laws and send a Representative to the General Assembly. It seems, however, that a portion of this charter must have been subsequently set aside, as we find that afterwards the names of five gentlemen chosen appear as Commissioners.\n\nIn September, 1761, a violent equinoctial gale raged along the coast of Carolina in the vicinity of Cape Fear. It lasted four days, and was very disastrous in its effects. Such was the fury of the storm, that the waves forced open a new passage from the river to the ocean. What is known as New Inlet, which was closed about forty or fifty years ago at great expense and trouble by the Federal Government dates its existence from this great storm.\n\nOn September 1st, 1764, the first newspaper ever published in Wilmington, made its appearance. It was called the Cape Fear Gazette, and Wilmington Advertiser, and was edited and published by Andrew Stewart.\n\nNorth Carolina is certainly entitled to precedence over the other colonies in taking steps toward throwing off the British yoke, for at Charlotte, in Mecklenburg County, on the 20th of May, 1775, there was drawn, signed and sealed, the famous Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. But Cape Fear as a section, anticipated the action of the State. The Stamp Act received the King's Assent March 22nd, 1765. The people of North Carolina were so warm in their indignation, and so violent in their opposition to this flagrant violation of the rights of the colonies, that Governor Tryon, who was called by the Indians, the “Great Wolf of Carolina”, was afraid to convene the General Assembly.\n\nEarly in 1766, the British sloop-of-war Diligence, arrived in the river Cape Fear, having on board the stamped paper destined for use of this Province. On the 6th of January, the Governor issued a proclamation announcing the circumstance, and calling on all persons authorized to act as distributors of the stamps to make application therefor to the commander of the sloop.\n\nOn the first notice of the arrival of this vessel, Colonel John Ashe, of the County of New Hanover, and Colonel Waddell, of the County of Brunswick, assembled the militia of the two counties. They marched at the head of the troops to the town of Brunswick, where the sloop was anchored, and notified the commander of their intention to resist the landing of the stamps. It was judged best by him not to make the attempt.\n\nA party was then left by the colonists to watch the movements of the vessel. The rest of the militia marched back to Wilmington, carrying with them one of the boats belonging to the vessel. Having fixed a mast in it, with a flag attached, they hoisted it on a cart and drove triumphantly through the streets of Wilmington—the inhabitants all joining in the procession. At night the whole town was illuminated.\n\nOn the next day a great concourse of people, headed by Colonel Ashe, proceeded to the residence of the Governor, then situated on the south side of what is now Market street, between Front and Water streets, and demanded audience with James Houston, one of the Council, who had been appointed Stamp Master for the Province. The Governor first declared his intention not to allow it, unless Houston would come willingly, but the people threatened to set fire to the house, and proceeded to make preparations for so doing.\n\nThe Governor then requested Colonel Ashe to step inside and talk over the matter with the Stamp Master. Houston, finding himself so obnoxious to the people, went with them to the market house, nearby, where he took a solemn oath not to proceed with the duties of his office. The people then gave him three cheers and conducted Houston back to the Governor. Thus ended the first overt act of armed resistance to the British Crown. This display of real and defiant resistance to the Crown, antedated the much heralded Boston Tea Party nearly eight years, and given its proper setting in history properly should be recognized as the real beginning of the subsequent American Revolution.\n\nIn the latter part of February, at a general militia meeting in the town of Wilmington, the Governor offered to the people there assembled a barbecue ox and a number of barrels of beer. They were refused; the ox was thrown in the river and the beer poured out on the ground. The Stamp Act was repealed, and on the 26th of June, the Mayor, Aldermen and Recorder of Wilmington presented an address to the Governor, congratulating him upon the fact. This manly resistance to oppression on the part of the people of the Cape Fear section, was but the first exhibition of a valor and patriotic enthusiasm that soon brought about a revolution against the most powerful Government on the face of the earth, which finally resulted in the establishment of American liberty and independence.\n\nIn August, 1774, the citizens of Wilmington sent to the relief of the people of Boston, who were then suffering many privations from the arbitrary enactments of the British, a large sum of money and a vessel of provisions. The vessel was tendered free of cost by Parker Quince, Esq., and the captain and crew refused any compensation for their services.\n\nOn the 19th of June, 1775, after the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence had been signed, the citizens of Wilmington assembled and unanimously resolved themselves into an association, whose avowed object was resistance to the Government of Great Britain by an appeal to arms. A committee of safety was appointed, which remained in office until February 1776, and means of defense against the British were immediately collected and arranged. War was imminent, and the utmost prudence and foresight were exercised in making the necessary preparations to meet the emergency.\n\nIt is a properly prideful and glorious fact that the spirit of freedom, manifest in Wilmington and the entire Cape Fear section was active against the unjust acts of the British monarch even before the peoples of other colonies. Martin and Williamson, in their histories of North Carolina, Col. John Wheeler, and our own John Hampden Hill, Dr. Sprunt and Samuel A. Ashe, all are agreed upon this fact and each emphasizes the magnificent patriotism of the section. Wheeler, who was not a New Hanover County product, in writing of the period immediately preceding the Revolution says:\n\n“There is no portion of North Carolina more early and more sincerely devoted to liberty than New Hanover County. Long before the Revolution, its inhabitants, led by John Ashe, showed indomitable resistance to the tyrannical acts of England. This section of the country was more exposed to the presence of the enemy than any part of our state and none showed firmer opposition. In July, 1774, on the Boston port bill being enacted by Parliament, the citizens of Wilmington met and declared ‘the cause of Boston, the common cause of America.’ In the next month, the citizens sent, by Parker Quince, a ship load of provision to their suffering brethren in Boston.\n\n“On adjournment of the first Continental Cngress (in October, 1774) on the 23rd day of November, 1774, the freeholders of Wilmington held a meeting and elected a Committee of Safety, of which Cornelius Harnett, John Quince, Francis Clayton, William Hooper, Robert Hogg, John Ancrum, Archibald McLain, John Robinson and John Walker were members. In 1775, the citizens of New Hanover formed an association for defense of their liberties, with the citizens of Brunswick, Bladen, Duplin and Onslow; and declared themselves ready ‘to go forth and be ready to sacrifice their lives and fortunes to secure the freedom and safety of the country.’ When Governor Martin summoned His Majesty's Council to attend him on board the sloop-of-war, in the Cape Fear River, in January, 1776, the Committee informed the members, then on their way, that they could not consistent ‘with the safety of the country, permit them to attend the Governor.’ A more decided act does not appear in the annals of any state.”\n\nThese patriots did not hesitate, even though they knew they occupied a revolutionary aspect, and that they were, at any moment, liable to British attack. They fully\n\nappreciated the fact that Fort Johnson was the key to the district: knew that it was defended by British bayonets, and that Governor Martin, the executive head of affairs in the State, had taken refuge there. They were fully aware, also, that the guns of the British man-of-war Cruiser, commanded the place. Yet, in the face of all this, they were determined that Fort Johnson should be reduced. Thoroughly frightened by the demonstrations of the colonists, Governor Martin caused the guns and stores of the Fort to be removed to the Cruiser, and was preparing to follow them himself, when on the 18th of July, Colonel John Ashe and his followers appeared before the walls of the Fort. Martin immediately fled to the ship, the works at Fort Johnson were burned and destroyed under its very guns, and Colonel Ashe and his men returned to Wilmington. In the language of another. “Thus, nobly upon the Cape of Fear, closed the first act of the drama, and when the curtain rose again, George, by the Grace of God, King, was King no longer, but the Constitution reigned, and the free people of North Carolina governed themselves.”\n\nDuring the Revolution, the town of Wilmington became a place of much military importance. The most important event of this period, perhaps, as regards the town of Wilmington, was the battle of Moore's Creek. This occurred about eighteen miles from Wilmington, where the county bridge now crosses that stream. It was fought on the 27th of February, 1776, between the Scotch Tories, under Brigadier General McDonald, and a small body of patriot Whigs, under Colonels Caswell and Lillington. The Tories were on their way to Wilmington to effect a junction with Sir Peter Parker and Major General Sir Henry Clinton, who arrived in Cape Fear with a military and naval armament, on April 18th, 1776. The Tories were completely routed with great loss of both men and arms. The victory was an exceedingly important one, for the reason that it entirely broke up an intended British campaign in North Carolina. Clinton, being sorely disappointed at the result, and despairing of obtaining a foothold in the Cape Fear section, after landing with a part of his troops and devastating a portion of Brunswick County, re-embarked and sailed for Charleston on the 4th of June.\n\nIn 1780, the town of Wilmington became one of the military posts of the British army in America. A handsome dwelling house at the corner of Third and Market streets (still occupied by the present owner) was used as the headquarters of Lord Cornwallis during the occupancy of the town by the British. The enclosure around the graveyard of St. James’ Church was removed, the edifice stripped of its pews, and other furniture, and converted first into a hospital, next into a block house for defense against the Americans, and last into a riding school for the dragoons of Tarleton. The original church was built of brick, and extended thirty feet into what is now Market street, standing about fifty yards east of the present edifice. Materials from the original building were used in the present structure.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War the history of the town became blended with the records of the common country, and we hasten on. In the period extending from the close of the Revolution to the second war with Great Britain, the people of Wilmington and its vicinity were distinguished for gaity, cordiality, genercsity and sociability—traits which have ever marked the community even to the present day. Many opulent planters made the town their residence for a part of the year. Men of leisure, in conjunction with gentlemen of the liberal professions, moderated and refined the spirit of trade, and gave an elevated tone to society. The woods furnished game in abundance, and the river and neighboring ocean many varieties of fish. Racing was greatly indulged in, and gentlemen prided themselves, rather upon the quality of their horses than the style of their equipages. Style was hardly considered of so much importance then, as now.\n\nIn the Wars of 1812 and with Mexico, Wilmington was not lax in zeal and patriotism. The blood of many of the town's splendid sons was shed upon the heights and plains of Monterey, Buena Vista and Palo Alto. The city's contribution to the War of 1812 was notably distinguished in the person of Captain Johnston Blakely. Captain Blakely's achievements as commander of The Wasp, his daring and successful attacks upon the British, even in their home ports, almost parallels the gallantry of John Paul Jones during the Revolution and stands out boldly in all the world's annals of maritime warfare.\n\nPrior to the late War between the States, Wilmington had become one of the most prosperous and wealthy cities in the South. With a safe and convenient port, the outlet of the most highly productive portions of this great State, her trade and commerce\n\nhad grown to extensive proportions, and an era of unbounded prosperity was being enjoyed. But cruel war came again, commerce was prostrated, trade paralyzed, and society completely demoralized for the time.\n\nEvery available man was needed in the Southern armies, and the port was blockaded by the Federal fleet. Although the State did not secede until the 20th of May, 1861, North Carolina for more than a month had been committed. In fact, a Wilmington Military company, in January, 1861, really committed the first overt act, marching upon Fort Caswell, at the mouth of the Cape Fear River, and taking possession of the reservation in the name of the State. The fort was formally offered to the Governor of North Carolina, who replied in effect that as hostilities had not been declared, he would suggest and advise its return to the representatives of the National Government, who had been dispossessed. This was done, but nevertheless, the capture of this reservation, really stands as the first real offensive on either side during the War between the States.\n\nThe news of the bombardment and capture of Fort Sumter by the Provisional forces, on the 14th of April, fired the people of North Carolina with patriotic zeal, and fearful lest Forts Caswell and Johnson, at the mouth of the Cape Fear River, should fall into the hands of the enemy, the young men of Wilmington rushed to arms. On the 15th of April, Col. John L. Cantwell, then commanding the 30th regiment of the North Carolina militia, was ordered to proceed, with the volunteer companies under his command, to Smithville (now Southport) and Caswell and occupy the forts there.\n\nThis order was countermanded the same day, but on the day following, a final telegram was received from Governor Ellis directing his previous order to be at once put into execution. On the morning of that day, therefore, four volunteer companies from this city, the Wilmington Light Infantry, Captain Wm. L. de Rossett; the Wilmington Rifle Guards, Captain O. P. Meares; the German Volunteers, Captain C. Cornhelson, and the Cape Fear Light Artillery, Captain John J. Hedrick, embarked for the fort. This, and the almost simultaneous seizure of Fort Macon, in Beaufort Harbor, was the signal for the revolution in North Carolina.\n\nIt is certainly a fact worthy of note that the news of the secession of the State from the Federal Government, and the call upon her people to arm themselves, was first made known to the pioneer troops of Cape Fear upon the parade ground of Fort Caswell. These four companies were the first in this section to take active part in the commencement of hostilities, and eventually gave to the war some of the most illustrious names that the South can boast. In the meantime troops began to assemble from all parts of the State, and the most distinguished men of the time offered themselves to the Executive for service. The terrific struggle between North and South began in earnest, and troops were rapidly advancing to the front. A Federal blockade was soon placed upon Southern ports, nothing but battles were thought or spoken of, and commercial enterprise was looked upon as a thing of the past.\n\nDuring this period, however, every effort was made by leading citizens of this community, who joined with those of other sections of the State, to prevent the epochal strife. It is of historic interest that this city used every possible effort to adjust the differences between the North and South. A distinguished resident of Wilmington, the Hon. George Davis, was selected by Governor Ellis as a member of the delegation of eight North Carolinians to attend the Peace Convention at Montgomery, Ala., in February, 1861. Mr. Davis, historians agree, loved the Union and steadfastly counseled moderation, but he like Gen. Robert E. Lee, declined to permit his state to be invaded by hostile armies. As evidence of his talent and patriotism, he was chosen attorney general of the Confederacy in which position he served with distinction and constructive statesmanship—a monument erected to his memory by a grateful people now stands at Third and Market streets, one block east of the great Cornelius Harnett statue. Other names prominently identified with the period are James H. Dickson, Robert H. Cowan, D. A. Lamont, Thomas Miller, Donald MacRae, Robert G. Rankin, James H. Chadbourn, A. H. Van Bokkelen and O. G. Parsley.\n\nCape Fear River, though unmolested until near the close of the war, before long was recognized as one of the few links connecting the Confederacy with the outside world. The low, swift English built blockade runner became a frequent guest in these waters, and revived to some extent the dormant spirit of commercial enterprise, and the city began to assume some appearance of its former activities. Merchants and ship agents from abroad flocked to the city, railroad trains were filled with cotton and naval stores, either for the Government or private parties, and new buildings and\n\nwarehouses were erected to accommodate the increasing supplies arriving here, both for exportation and for the Southern Army.\n\nThe Army of Northern Virginia, in 1863 and 1864, drew much of its supplies from the Port of Wilmington. A large percentage of the army munitions furnished to the different ordnance and quartermaster departments of the Confederate States was received by blockade runners through Wilmington.\n\nThe importance of Wilmington as a post was not lost upon the Confederate Government, even as early as the first year of the war. Generals Gatlin, Anderson and French being successively placed in command, new works were projected, new fortifications built and requisitions made upon the War Department for men and material for the construction of these defenses. Yet work was delayed by the want of energy and skill of those commanding the department, and it was not until November, 1862, that operations were commenced in earnest. In that month, General W. H. C. Whiting, by order of the War Department, assumed command of the Post and the supervision of the Cape Fear defenses.\n\nThen the work commenced with vigor. The grounds at Fort Fisher were energetically pushed forward to completion. Smith's Island was cleared, and the foundation of Fort Holmes established. Fort Pender at Smithville (now Southport), was built, and soon the guns of Fort Anderson, first called Fort St. Philip, the last great work of the defenses which fell to the Federal hands, frowned from the heights of Old Brunswick. No means were spared, and no labor was begrudged that could contribute to the defense of the river. Day by day the work went bravely on, new additions were constantly made to its defensive strength, until, at length, numerous guns looked forth threateningly to the sea from the five principal forts of the river. Torpedoes and sunken obstructions were placed in the river, batteries frowned from every bluff and the city itself was surrounded with a chain of entrenchments.\n\nOf so great importance to the Confederacy, and one of its chief strongholds, it appears strange that Wilmington should have escaped attack until during the last year of the war. The nature of the coast and the known strength and durability of the fortifications, were enough, it seems, to deter the hazard of an attempt until December 23rd, 1864. On that day, memorable for all time, the Federal fleet appeared in the offing, opposite Fort Fisher, and at about two o'clock that night, Butler's Yankee Toy, the powder boat, was exploded near the works with no other result than that of affording the Confederates a gratuitous display of fireworks.\n\nThe next day, the Federal fleet, numbering fifty-two vessels, was ranged in line of battle opposite the fort, and, at about noon, opened a terrific bombardment. The fort replied slowly but steadily, until after an uninterrupted contest of five hours, the fleet retired. On the next day, the bombardment was resumed with redoubled vigor, and with a force, up to that time unprecedented in the history of the world. Shot and shell were literally hurled in an almost solid mass at the fort, and the air was filled with flying fragments. The gallant defenders held manfully to their posts and hurled defiance back.\n\nIn the midst of the fight, a landing was effected by the enemy at Anderson Battery, at the head of the sound, and advanced to attack the fort. The assault was assisted by an increase of fire from the fleet, which endeavored to prevent the Confederates from manning the parapet to resist the attack. General Whiting and Colonel Lamb, who were in command of the fort, were the first at the post of danger, and encouraged by their brave example, the men swarmed to the parapet, and the enemy were driven back to their entrenchments. That night the entire fleet was withdrawn.\n\nShortly afterwards, the land forces also re-embarked on their transports and the Federal force left for the North, defeated. Over twenty thousand shot and shell had been expended by the fleet in their futile attempt to reduce the fort.\n\nThe strength of Fort Fisher, as a defensive work, was vastly overrated by the Federal commanders, and it could easily have been taken by Butler at this time if a concentrated effort had been made. Its chief value to the Confederacy lay in the aid it afforded blockade runners in entering, or leaving, the port. Space requires that we pass over many acts of heroism on the part of the defenders of Fort Fisher, the memory of which will forever be cherished in the fond recollections of this people. One can only mention that little band of boys, yet children, who constituted the only defense of their mothers and sisters in Wilmington at this time, who alone stood guard over\n\nthe prisoners at this city on the night of the great bombardment, and who were “as true to the trust confided to them as if their leader had numbered fifty instead of fifteen years.”\n\nThe fatal time soon came, however, when Fort Fisher was doomed to fall, and when the Confederacy was destined to receive a fatal blow, from the effects of which it never recovered. Suddenly and without warning, the Federal fleet again appeared before Fisher on the 13th of January, 1865. Troops were landed at Anderson Battery, and when General Hoke arrived later in the day with his division, he found the line of the enemy confronting him, stretched across the entire peninsular from ocean to river.\n\nAt the first news of the intended attack, General Whiting had hurried to the assistance of Colonel Lamb, and these two heroes of the first great battle made vigorous preparation for a second defense. Although not exactly in the nature of a surprise, the attack came at a most inauspicious moment. Forts Fisher, Caswell, Anderson, Pender and Holmes, near the mouth of the river, and comprising the defensive strength of the Cape Fear, had become almost entirely stripped of troops for action at other points, and the division, under General Hoke, was then stationed at, or near Wilmington, but, between Fort Fisher and Wilmington, there intervened about twenty miles of sandy, tedious road.\n\nAt 2 o'clock, on the morning of the 13th, Hoke's command left for the fort, but arrived too late to prevent the landing of troops. In the meantime, General Whiting had left for the front. About noon, on the 13th, the fleet opened fire upon the fort, and a more terrific and terrible bombardment than the first, then ensued. The object of the enemy was plainly apparent. It was their intention to cripple the fort as much as possible by the fire of the fleet, and to make easy a projected assault by the land forces. Success rewarded their efforts.\n\nSo terrible was the fire of shot and shell that it was almost impossible to man the guns of the fort. The garrison were driven to the bomb-proofs and kept closely confined there. From noon of the 13th, until three o'clock, on the afternoon of the 15th, a period of fifty-one hours, the terrific bombardment was continued without cessation. At the last named hour, the fire of the fleet was suddenly raised, and the land forces were discerned moving to the assault of the fort. The assault was made in two columns, each advancing to the different points of attack.\n\nThe first numbered about two thousand, and was composed of sailors and marines, who moved up the line of sea beach, while the other, numbering four thousand, charged along the bank of the river, and made their attack on the left hand flank of the fort. The first column mentioned was easily driven back, and made no second attempt. The second was temporarily checked in its advance, but upon being strengthened by reinforcements, again advanced and succeeded in entering the fort. But Fort Fisher did not yield even then without a final and desperate struggle. The Confederates fell back in disorder, but not in confusion, and stubbornly contested every foot of the enemy's advance. From traverse to traverse they, retreating, fought the overwhelming force of numbers, driving them back. The fight was continued in this way for six hours, until, at length, the last traverse was torn from the hands of these brave defenders, and they were forced beyond the enclosure of the fort. Thus was Fort Fisher captured. It never surrendered.\n\nThe conflict ceased, and at about midnight, there being no means of escape to the mainland, General Whiting was compelled to surrender his command as prisoners of war. In this engagement, the loss of the Confederates while severe, was not nearly so large as that of the Federals. The losses of the former amounted to two hundred and fifty killed, wounded and missing, while the latter lost over eight hundred. So Fort Fisher fell, and, on the same night, the works south of it, and commanding Main Bar, consisting of Forts Caswell, Holmes and Pender, were destroyed and abandoned, and their garrisons moved to Fort Anderson. It was plain to be seen that Wilmington eventually must fall into the hands of the enemy.\n\nFort Anderson, on the site of the ancient town of Brunswick, still defiantly commanded the approach to the city. The river was filled with torpedoes, and sunken obstructions, and General Hoke was strongly entrenched between the advancing army and Wilmington. On the 17th of February, a portion of the Federal fleet steamed up the river and commenced the bombardment of Fort Anderson. The fire was returned as slowly and deliberately as if the garrison were at target practice. In the meantime, General Schofield had marched up from Smithville (Southport) with a land force of\n\neight thousand men, to co-operate with the fleet in the reduction of the fort. He was confronted by Hagood's brigade, which had been thrown over by Hoke to the assistance of the fort, and which was strongly entrenched, presenting an effectual barrier to his advance. Hagood's left rested on the fort and his right on Orton Mill Pond. Finding his path so completely obstructed, Schofield made a detour to his left around the pond, which was about nine miles in circumference, with the intention of striking Hagood on the flank. This movement could not be opposed with the small force on hand, and the immediate evacuation of Anderson became an imperative necessity.\n\nOn Sunday, the 19th, before daylight, the guns were spiked and the garrison quietly withdrew. This fort had been considered almost impregnable, and it has been often contended that, if a sufficient land force had been available to protect its rear, it could never have been taken. As it was, the bombardment left it comparatively uninjured. The garrison retreated rapidly, and paused the same day at Town Creek, where a few entrenchments had been hastily thrown up.\n\nOn the next day the line of retreat was resumed, and that night they reached Wilmington. On the following day, the advance of the Federals could be plainly seen marching along the causeway on Eagle's Island, but a shell, fired from the corner of Front and Market streets, informed them that the defenders of Anderson were in the city, and suddenly checked their onward march to take possession, which they had supposed an easy undertaking. They again endeavored to advance, but a few more shells drove them back in confusion. Skirmishers were then sent forward by both sides.\n\nIn the meantime, as soon as Anderson had been evacuated, Hoke had gradually fallen back upon the city, but still presenting a defiant front. On the morning of the 21st he reached Wilmington and effected a junction with Hagood and Hedrick. Then it was that Wilmington was evacuated, the enemy entering the next day, and with it expired the most sanguine hopes of the final success of the Confederate cause.\n\nReluctantly, one is compelled to pass over many of the incidents connected with the occupation of the city by the Federal forces, nor would it serve any real purpose to relate many of the events then transpiring. There is one incident of the Federal occupation, however, which viewed in any light reflects neither reputation nor credit upon the officers in command. The Rev. Dr. A. A. Watson, who was at the time Rector of St. James Episcopal Church, was ordered by the Federal authority to offer prayer in the church service for the President of the United States, instead of the President of the Confederate States. Feeling that he had no canonical or sympathetic right to do so at the time, Dr. Watson refused, and continued to pray for the head of the Confederate Government. The keys of the church were then seized by order of Major-General Schofield. Subsequently, Brigadier General Hawley, later a United States Senator from Connecticut, ordered that the edifice itself be seized and converted into a hospital. Members of the congregation begged him to spare their beloved church and offered him any number of more suitable and convenient places for the purpose. He was inexorable, however, and commanded a force of twenty-five negro soldiers, in charge of a negro officer, to proceed to the building with pick-axes and tear out the pews and other furniture. His orders were obeyed, the pews were thrown into the streets by negroes, and for the second time in its existence the historic and venerable church of St. James was turned into a military hospital.\n\nTo the discredit of the State, it should be mentioned that Hawley, while a North Carolinian by birth, having been born in Robeson County, was carried when an infant by his parents to Connecticut. It is some compensation to North Carolina, at least, to say that this party spent his entire life in the North, and had neither sentiment nor disposition which the South could claim with any degree of credit. During his occupation of Wilmington, this renegade boastingly averred that he had returned to his native state to teach the people “correct principles”. The conduct of this moral educator of the people would certainly seem to indicate that during his lifetime sojourn in Connecticut he had acquired peculiar notions as to what constituted correctness of principle, and that a preliminary step in this branch of knowledge consisted in the wanton and uncalled-for desecration of a House of God. One is free to confess, that to those not so enlightened, as this combination General-Senator Hawley, his conduct, on the occasion mentioned, would appear to indicate a most unfortunate ignorance of the ordinary decencies of life and an entire absence of reverence for the Almighty.\n\nBefore drawing the curtain upon the events of the war, one may be pardoned a few words in regard to the swift and silent blockade runners, whose incomings and outgoings\n\ngave to Wilmington so much of commercial importance during 1863 and ’64. The blockade runners were English steamers built more for speed than carrying capacity. They were painted a French gray, or lead color, which blended with the atmosphere so as to make detection extremely difficult. They carried a pilot and signal officer, and when ready to leave port, dropped down the river near the mouth of the inlet, waiting for a dark night to slip out.\n\nThe guns of Fort Fisher commanded the entrance to the harbor, and no vessels could pass in, or out, without the knowledge of those within the fort. Signals were consequently arranged, and an officer placed on board each ship in control of that branch of the service, and by such means those in command of the fort could easily distinguish friend from foe. In running into the harbor the same precautions were necessary. When a runner approached the fort, which was, of course, always at night, the signal officer on board displayed a peculiar light and made a certain signal, which was answered by the fort, and she then passed in without molestation.\n\nThe blockading fleet lay out some four or five miles distant from the fort, and the danger of running in or out, was the risk of capture by them. In making the passage, the ship displayed no light, and the most rigid discipline was enforced. It frequently happened that in the darkness they ran so near the blockading fleet as to be heard by them, the noise of the wheel betraying their presence. Rockets would immediately be sent up and a fire opened. If coming in, a dash was then made to get under the guns of the fort; if going out, all steam was raised and a chase of the most exciting character began, the ships dashing through the water at a tremendous rate, the blockader firing continually at the fleeing runner, hoping by a well directed shot to disable her, and the latter using every means that skill and ingenuity could suggest to effect escape.\n\nA great portion of the cargo was frequently thrown overboard to avoid capture. Instances were not infrequent when large amounts of gold, shipped out for foreign purchases were tossed into the sea when escape became impossible. In the early days of blockade running, the ships engaged were rarely captured, as they were much faster than the vessels of the blockading fleet. Very soon ships equally fast were obtained by the Federal Government, rendering escape more difficult. It is remarkable when the risk attending the running is considered, that so little damage should have been done to life and property. Some vessels were run upon the beach to prevent capture, but none were sunk outright by the blockading fleets. Individual acts of heroism were frequent.\n\nAfter the close of the War between the States, and upon the re-opening of the port, the most gloomy anticipations as to the future were advanced. Little cotton and scarcely any turpentine had been produced during the war, and it was generally supposed that home manufacture and foreign shipment had exhausted the last bale and barrel of each. But as soon as it was ascertained that shipments could be made North with perfect security, the market became flooded with both cotton and naval stores, commerce suddenly revived and Wilmington began to rise again to commercial importance in the maritime world. A direct foreign trade began to be established and shipments were made to the principal points in Europe, the West Indies and South America. It was during this period, as well as prior thereto, that Wilmington was recognized as the leading naval stores market and port of the country.\n\nOn the 20th of February, 1866, the act incorporating Wilmington into a city was ratified by the Legislature, and, on Thursday, the 8th day of March, it was accepted by the citizens through the ballot box. The governmental form of Mayor and Board of Alderman, continued for many years, having been reinforced for a period with a supplementary Board of Audit and Finance, the latter having supervision and control of financial expenditures.\n\nIn its history, Wilmington has been devastated by three great conflagrations, each of which prostrated the place for a period of time. The most devastating of the three occurred Sunday, February 21st, 1886. At this time, practically the entire river front, from Chestnut street north, was destroyed, as well as a great portion of the northern section of the city. The spirit and determinination of the citizenship asserted themselves after each fire, however, and a larger and better community resulted.\n\nWilmington suffered extremely, after the end of the War between the States, from\n\nthe rule of “carpet baggers”—this infamous type of humanity having plundered many sections of the South. The era of tyrannical despotism finally reached such extremes, as to result in the formation of the Ku Klux Klan, by the flower of Southern manhood. This body worked silently and effectively for the protection of the home and fireside, and many interesting stories of its accomplishments locally could be retold if space permitted.\n\nIn 1898, and for several years prior, Wilmington and North Carolina were under the rule of radicals. These disreputable leaders mislead the negro population, the Republican Government having placed negroes as policemen, magistrates, as members of the board of aldermen, county commissioners, etc. Conditions soon became of such drastic nature that the white men were forced to organize to protect their wives and children. Colonel Roger Moore, an outstanding Wilmingtonian, who was in command of the Third North Carolina Cavalry, at the end of the War between the States, was placed in command by the citizens movement, and he was in full charge of the entire situation until martial law was declared and the state militia took charge on November 10th, 1898, following a race riot in which a number of negroes were killed, and two white men severely wounded.\n\nThe Wilmington riot, generally referred to, locally, as “The Revolution” was caused by the injection of the negro into politics and the inevitable assertion of self-importance by some members of that race. Although the situation had been threatening for some time, it became seething as a result of the appearance, from time to time, of “editorials” in a negro newspaper, The Daily Record, published by a negro named Manly.\n\nCol. Walker Taylor, then in charge of the local National Guards troop and still a most highly respected and influential citizen of Wilmington, has a copy of one of the negro's (Manly's) editorials of that period. The editorial was nauseatingly insulting. It said: “Poor white men are careless in the matter of protecting their women. Especially on the farms. They are careless of their conduct toward them, and our experience among poor white people in the country teaches us that women of that race are not more particular in the matter of clandestine meetings with colored men, than are the white men with colored women. Meetings of this kind go on for some time until the woman's infatuation or the man's boldness, bring attention to them and the man is lynched for rape. Every negro lynched is called a ‘big, burly, black brute,’ when, in fact, many of those who have been thus dealt with had white men for their fathers, and were not only ‘black’ and ‘burly’ but were sufficiently attractive for white girls of culture and refinement to fall in love with them as is very well known to all.”\n\nManifestly, a situation developing that character of negro editorial, was aggravatedly serious and required positive treatment. And the treatment was administered, promptly and definitely. At the regular monthly meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, held Thursday, October 6, 1898, resolutions, adequately covering the subject, candidly attacking a political regime that permitted such a condition, were passed. These resolutions, a copy shows, were signed by Col. Walker Taylor, George Harriss, George Harriss, Jr., H. C. McQueen, Hugh MacRae, Judge George Rountree and thirty-three other prominent citizens.\n\nIn the meantime, there were numerous developments. Direct attention was called to the numerous negro officeholders. The list, printed by The Messenger, showed thirteen negroes on the police force; four in the health department; seventeen in the fire department; forty magistrates; three negro aldermen; three at the customs house, including the collector and deputy collector; seven at the courthouse, including register of deeds, coroner, constable and other positions; and four deputy sheriffs. Alex. Sprunt & Son and other business men, individually and collectively, sought to impress Governor Daniel L. Russell with the gravity of the situation, but his letter, in reply to one from the Sprunt company, indicated that he regarded the protests as purely partisan matters.\n\nSeemingly, the entire nation was observing the crisis, for that exactly was what it was relative to white supremacy. The Washington Post, under the caption of “It Cannot Be Done” forecast the result, in the event the negro was not removed from politics. A portion of The Post's editorial stated: “Even General Grant, who had conquered the Confederate armies in the field, could not with all the civil and military power of the country at his back, force negro rule upon the Southern whites. The thing is out of the question. It cannot be done. And those who engage in such a desperate enterprise will reap only the harvest of dismay and ruin.”\n\nIn early November, a huge mass meeting was held, fully a thousand being in attendance. A committee was appointed by Chairman A. M. Waddell, composed of Judge George Rountree, Hugh MacRae, Colonel Taylor, Iredell Meares and S. H. Fishblate, to prepare resolutions in the nature of an ultimatum. The original copy of these resolutions, written in long-hand, is in possession of Mr. MacRae at this time. It demanded the banishment of certain negroes, the resignation of various officials and called upon all white citizens to enforce the demands. A copy of the demands were forwarded to a negro committee, which was given until a stated hour the following day to make reply. The negroes agreed to every demand but foolishly mailed, instead of personally delivering the reply, which did not arrive until after the zero hour and the “Revolution” had begun.\n\nThese resolutions were signed by hundreds of people, including Judge Rountree, Col. Roger Moore, J. L. Grafflin, Thomas W. Wright, B. G. Empie, F. H. Stedman, A. P. Yopp, P. L. Bridgers, S. W. Westbrook, J. F. Post, Jr., W. H. Yopp, F. S. Westbrook, George L. Peschau, H. C. McQueen, F. A. Montgomery, J. W. Plummer, Jr., Hugh MacRae, Colonel Taylor, Martin Newman, W. S. Herring, Don MacRae, J. R. Davis, Junius Davis, E. G. Yopp, J. W. Wright, F. H. Fechtig, Herbert McClammy, John W. Reilly, F. W. Harriss, W. E. Yopp, W. H. Wright, M. H. Bellamy, George Harriss, Jr., James Reilly, Walter H. MacRae, and great groups of others.\n\nA committee of twenty-five was appointed by the chairman to carry out the provisions of the resolution. Those on this committee were Junius Davis, Hugh MacRae, F. H. Fechtig, F. A. Montgomery, Joseph R. Davis, P. L. Bridgers, and nineteen others. On November 10, Colonel Taylor, post commander, 2nd Regiment, North Carolina State Guards advised Governor Russell: “Situation here serious; I hold military awaiting your prompt orders.” Charles S. Davis, major 11th U. S. Infantry and acting adjutant general, answered instead of the governor and instructed Colonel Taylor to act to preserve peace. He also ordered Commander G. L. Morton, naval reserves, to report to Colonel Taylor. Companies also were sent from Clinton, Maxton, Franklinton and Kinston to reinforce the Wilmington guards. However, before peace was restored, Colonel Taylor's report to the adjutant general states, eleven negroes (all unknown) had been killed and three whites (one unknown) wounded.\n\nThe riot continued for less than 24 hours, the white citizens of Wilmington thus gaining control of the Government. The radical leaders, who had so badly advised the negroes, were driven from the city, and the negroes were assured full friendship and protection as long as they recognized the fact that the white men of Wilmington, and of North Carolina, intended to remain at the helm of government. Since this crucial time, for which the negroes were not as much responsible as their despicable white radical leaders, the relationship between the races has been of a kindly and friendly nature.\n\nThe Wilmington Riot, or Revolution, is the only instance except one other, in all the 190 years history of the city, in which the racial problem required drastic handling. In 1831, six negroes were tried for seeking to incite an insurrection. They were given a studiously fair trial, were convicted and hanged on a single scaffold. The incident was an overflow of the Nat Turner rebellion in Virginia. The local plot to rebel was quickly discovered and promptly suppressed by soldiers from Fort Johnston.\n\nSome years ago, the aldermanic form of Government was changed to a semi-Commission form, with a Mayor, and a single Commissioner to represent each Ward. Later, the second form was superseded by the true form of Commission Government, with three Commissioners, elected at large, being placed in authority.\n\nSince the War between the States, Wilmington as a city has steadily and surely progressed in population, wealth and commercial importance. In proportion to population, the city is one of the most stable and dependable in the South.\n\nThe industrial, port, agricultural and resort advancement of the City of Wilmington, is dealt with elsewhere in this volume. The purpose of this article is to give a chronological sketch of the different eras of development of the present community, dating from the earliest Colonial periods to the present time. Thus, to some good purpose, it may be hoped, has been traced the history of the Cape Fear region down to a period within the recollection of all of the present generation. Through the terrible and trying ordeal of several wars, this city has bravely passed, having an honorable and enviable record made by her sons who served in the Revolution, the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the War between the States, the Spanish-American War, and the great\n\nWorld War. From each conflict period, the city emerged like iron from a furnace, strengthened and purified. Today, her diversified industries give forth those sounds of prosperity and general well-being which quicken the pulse of a nation and prolong the life of a Republic.\n\nIn the prosperity of today, may the memory of the glorious past be ever fondly cherished. As the ancients were wont to twine the dark wreath of the cypress with the amaranthus and the rose, so let us join the memory of days gone by with the golden opportunities of the present and the brilliant promise of the future.\n\nSTORIES OF THE OLD PLANTATIONS\n\nby\n\nDr. John Hampden Hill\n\n(The following was written by Dr. Hill about 1845. It was never printed in book form. The original manuscript is owned by Thomas W. Davis, well-known attorney of this city, and was loaned for use in this volume of Biographical Sketches of Wilmington Citizens.)\n\nWhen Sir John Yeamans was governor of the Island of Barbadoes, he fitted out a small vessel, and sent her under the command of a Captain Hilton, on a voyage of discovery. Hilton, according to instructions, located along the shores of the mainland, until he discovered the mouth of the Cape Fear River, which he entered and ascended with his vessel as far as the junction of its two main branches, now known as the North West and the North East. Here he anchored and proceeded with a small boat to ascend, selecting the North East branch as the most inviting for farther exploration. Several points attracted the attention and admiration of the adventurers, to which they attached names more or less characteristic, and it is somewhat remarkable that even at this remote time, many of those places retain the names given them by the first white men who had passed that way. Such for instance, the first attractive point on the right bank of the River as they ascended was named Hilton, in compliment to the commander of the party. Without encountering any unusual adventures, so far as tradition relates about the highest point which they reached was a place called Stag Park, named so by them, on the West bank of the stream. The tradition is that they saw a herd of deer on a handsome bluff, which overlooks the stream at this point. Standing amidst a magnificent park of forest trees, they gazed with startled amazement at these new intruders into their sylvan retreat, little knowing that they were the forerunners of far more formidable persecutors, than their red skinned cotenants of the forests. Meeting with some obstruction to his farther ascent, Hilton with his party, returned to their vessel, and after exploring a short distance up the North West branch, from the banks of which they were assailed by some Indians, they set sail for Barbadoes, to make report of their discovery.\n\nSir John Yeamans himself, afterward visited the Cape Fear, and brought a colony with him and made a settlement on the West Bank of the River, near the mouth of a stream which he named Charles River, now known as the Old Town Creek. Finding this location unhealthy and otherwise unsuitable, Yeamans soon abandoned it, and sailing farther South, he settled with his colony at the junction of the Ashley and Cooper rivers, when he founded the city of Charleston, naming it after his Sovereign and patron Charles II.\n\nNot designing to follow the progress of Yeamans with his colony, we will return to the Cape Fear, of whose early traditions the writer has undertaken at the solicitations of some much valued friends to narrate (so far as his memory serves) some imperfect sketches. After this section began to be visited and settlements made by emigrants from Europe and the other provinces, amongst the earliest places that attracted attention was Stag Park. It was first located and patented by George Burrington, then governor of the Province of North Carolina. This Governor Burrington was a very worthless and profligate character, so much so that on one occasion being at Edenton, he was presented by the Grand Jury of Chowan County, for riotous and disorderly conduct on the streets with a party of rowdy companions. Of such material as this, did our English rulers make governors for the guardianship of the lives and fortunes of their loyal subjects in these provinces. After having disgraced himself in America, Burrington returned to England, where still pursuing his profligate habits, he not long after lost his life in a street brawl, in the city of London. Before that event he had contracted a debt to a Mr. Strudwick, for which he mortgaged the Stag Park estate of ten thousand acres, and a large body of land which he owned in what was known as the Hawfields in Orange County. Mr. Strudwick sent his son Edmund to look after his property thus acquired in this country. The tradition was that this gentleman had fallen into disfavor with his friends on account of having married an actress in the City of London, which was the cause of his coming to settle in America. His residence was divided between Stag Park and the Hawfields. He left a son whom the writer has only heard mentioned as Major Strudwick and as quite an influential citizen of Orange County, where he chiefly resided. He married a Miss Shephard of Orange, by which marriage there were several sons and daughters, of whom the late\n\nMr. Samuel Strudwick of Alabama was the eldest. This gentleman was a successful planter and acquired a large estate. Of high intelligence and remarkable for his fine conversational talent, Dr. Edmund Strudwick of Hillsboro, is well-known as one of the ablest physicians of the State, and especially eminent as a surgeon. Betsy, the elder daughter married Mr. Paoli Ashe, and was the mother of the Hon. Thomas Ashe, one of the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, and a gentleman distinguished alike for professional ability and great worth and purity of character.\n\nStag Park was sold about the year 1817 for division among the heirs and purchased by Ezekiel Lane, Esq., for $10;000. This gentleman, we will have occasion to mention farther on. The next place descending the North East is the Neck, the residence of Governor Samuel Ashe, who together with his brother, General John Ashe, were among the most prominent and influential characters in the Cape Fear region both before and after the Revolutionary War. Governor Ashe held with distinction the position of District Judge up to the time of his election as Governor of the State. His oldest son, John Baptiste Ashe, was also elected Governor, but died before he could be inducted into office. There were two other sons of Governor Ashe, Samuel and Thomas. The latter was the grandfather of the present Judge Ashe, already spoken of, and the former will be mentioned farther on. There was still another son named Cincinatus, who with some other youths of the Cape Fear gentry, volunteered as midshipmen on board a privateer fitted out at Wilmington, and commanded by a Captain Allen, an Englishman. The vessel went to sea and was supposed to have been sunk by a British ship, or foundered in some other way, as she was never more heard of. The writer remembers when he was a child, an old lady, a Mrs. Allen, entirely blind, the widow of an English Captain, who lived with the families of the North East, first with one and then another, with whom she was always a welcome guest and treated with much respect and consideration.\n\nStill below the Neck and within the precinct known as Rocky Point was Green Hill, the residence of General John Ashe. This gentleman did more probably than any man in the Province, towards rousing the spirit of resistance against what was called British oppression. He was the prime mover and leader of the party which resisted the then governor in his attempt to enforce the Stamp Act. And when the war of the Revolution did break out, he raised a regiment at his own expense, so ardently were his feelings enlisted in the cause.\n\nBut the history of General Ashe's services, is or ought to be known well to the people of the Cape Fear. But it may not be known that he died in obscurity, and the place of his interment cannot be pointed out. The story is that on a visit to his family at Green Hill, in feeble health, he was betrayed by a faithless servant to a party of soldiers sent out from the garrison at Wilmington for his capture. Taken to Wilmington, he was confined in Craig's bull pen as it was called. Here his health became so feeble that he was released on parole and attempted to get to his family at Hillsboro. But he reached no farther than Sampson Hall, the residence of Colonel John Sampson, in the county of that name. Here he died and was buried, and there is neither stone nor mound to mark the spot. General Ashe left a son who also had served in the war of the Revolution. This was Major Samuel Ashe. He was an active politician of the Democratic Republican party and represented for many years the county of New Hanover in the legislature.\n\nOf the three daughters of General Ashe, one of them married Governor Joseph Alston of South Carolina, another married Mr. John Davis, and the third Mr. William H. Hill, the most talented man of the family, with the most brilliant promise of distinction when he died at the early age of thirty-six. This Green Hill property is now owned by the estate of the late Major John Walker. The Ashe family in early times, after the Revolution, differed in politics with the generality of the Cape Fear gentry. The Governor and his sons with the exception of Colonel Samuel Ashe were leaders of the Republicans or Jeffersonian faction, whereas the large majority of the gentry and educated class were Federalist of the Hamilton school. After the adoption of the Federal Constitution and a Republican form of government established, there is no doubt but that a good deal of feeling and prejudice existed against what was called too much liberty and equality. And the practice of some of the old Republicans was not always consistent with their professed principles. A little ancedote which the writer remembers to have heard will illustrate this. One day there came to the Neck a plain country man to see Governor Ashe on business. His errand was not finished before the Governor's dinner hour arrived. He was invited in, but seated at a side table, and helped from that at which the Governor and family dined. The man took no umbrage,\n\nquietly ate his dinner and made no remark. It chanced that sometime afterwards the Governor was traveling to his summer residence in the up country, when night overtaking him, he stopped before a house on the roadside, and sent in his servant to know if he could get a night's lodging. He was invited in, and hospitably welcomed. When supper was ready, he was shown to a side tab"
