Bryan was a farm laborer, teacher, school superintendent, lawyer, state legislator, judge, and father of William Jennings Bryan. Bryan resided in his native Culpepper County, Virginia until 1840, when he emigrated west to Lincoln County, Missouri, where he engaged in a farm business with his brother. In 1842, he moved to Marion County, Illinois, where he received a common school education and labored on a farm until he could receive enough education to teach school. He began teaching in 1844, and a year later he matriculated to McKendree College, graduating in 1849. Soon after graduating, he became superintendent of schools for Marion County, serving in that position from 1850 to 1852. In 1850, he owned real property valued at $120. In addition to teaching, Bryan read law and in 1851, he earned admission to the Illinois bar, and in 1852, commenced practicing law in Salem, Illinois. In November 1852, he married Mariah E.
