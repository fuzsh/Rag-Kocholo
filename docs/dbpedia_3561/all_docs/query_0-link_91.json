He was educated at Yale college, and was graduated in 1795, while teaching his profession, and began his labors in his native town, where he conducted an academy for three years. He then removed to Plainfield, N.J., where he was made rector of the academy. In 1803 he was chosen principal of the Bacon academy, Colchester, Conn., where he remained seven years, when he removed to Andover, Mass., as principal of Phillips academy. Here for twenty years he directed the preparatory training of many of the nations greatest minds, and as well helped to organize and advance numerous charitable associations, which have since become of national renown. In 1833, in connection with the work of the American Sunday school union, he went to Illinois, where he personally organized over five hundred Sunday schools. Yale conferred upon Mr. Adams the degree of LL.D. in 1854.

He was graduated from Wesleyan university in 1841, and for two years following was teacher of mathematics in Wilbraham academy. In 1842 he joined the New England conference, and from 1843 to 1845 preached at Colchester, Conn., having been transferred to the Providence conference. In 1845 he became principal of Wilbraham academy, resigning the position in 1848 to become principal of the Conference seminary at East Greenwich, R. I. This position he retained until 1854, being a member of the house of representatives of the state in 1852. From 1854 to 1857 he was commissioner of public schools of Rhode Island, and editor of the Rhode Island Schoolmaster. In 1854 he was again a member of the state legislature and also appointed a visitor to the military academy at West Point. He removed to Ohio in 1857 and for two years occupied the chair of ancient languages in Ohio university. From 1857 to 1863 he was president of the Wesleyan female college at Cincinnati, and from 1863 to 1869 was president of the McKendree college at Lebanon, Ill. In 1865 Wesleyan university conferred upon him the degree of D.D., and he received the degree of LL.D. from McKendree college in 1876. In 1874 he was chosen president of the Southern Illinois normal university at Carbondale. Ill., and held that office until his death, which occurred Jan. 7, 1894.\n\nALTGELD, John Peter, governor of Illinois, was born in Prussia in 1848, and early in life came to America with his fathers family, who settled on a farm near Mansfield, Ohio. His education was scanty, and at the age of sixteen he volunteered in the army, engaging in the final campaigns of Grant. He served with his regiment until it was disbanded at Columbus, O., and then worked on his fathers farm, studied in the library of a neighbor and at a private school at Lexington, O., and for two years taught school. He then left home and travelled from state to state earning a precarious livelihood, until, in 1869, he reached St. Louis, where he studied law, and removing to Savannah, Mo., in 1870, he was admitted to the bar. In 1874 he was elected prosecuting attorney for the county. In October, 1875, he resigned and removed to Chicago, Ill. In 1876 he was a candidate before the democratic caucus of the state legislature for United States senator. He was fairly successful in his law practice, and his first surplus of $500 he invested in a city lot, which he soon sold at a handsome profit. During the succeeding five years he accumulated a moderate sum, and in 1882 he made a real estate deal which astonished even Chicago. He bought seventy-five acres of land in the suburbs for from $2,500 to $3,000 an acre, making a payment down of $30,000 in cash. Two-thirds of the cash was supplied by a friend in Lake View, and the remainder Mr. Altgeld borrowed from other friends, until he found himself in debt nearly $200,000. He subdivided the property, had the streets improved, and afterwards sold out the land at an immense profit. This was the largest real estate transaction that had ever been made in Chicago, and it contributed greatly to Mr. Altgelds reputation as a shrewd business man. He subsequently bought $225,000 worth of property in a single purchase, and borrowed at one time $380,000 to improve the same. The Unity building was erected in 1895, and his entire holding of Chicago real estate was estimated in 1896 to be worth from one to five millions of dollars. In 1886 Mr. Altgeld accepted the democratic nomination for the office of judge of the supreme court, and though the district was accounted Republican by 12,000 votes, he was elected by a fair majority, a result largely due to the perfect organization of his canvass. In August, 1891, he resigned from the bench. The democratic state convention of April, 1892, nominated him for governor of Illinois. No Democrat had been elected to that office since 1856, but Altgeld began a campaign which was remarkable for its thoroughness, and he carried the election by a good majority. The most notable act of his administration as governor was the pardon of the anarchists who had been condemned to long imprisonment for complicity in the Haymarket murders in Chicago in May, 1886. His action raised a storm of indignant protest from all parts of the country. In July, 1894, the riotous railroad strikers in Chicago and vicinity were in possession of the shops and rolling stock of the roads coming into Chicago, and congested the traffic. President Cleveland sent United States troops to the protection of the roads, and Governor Altgeld protested against the act as interfering with the rights of the state. He was a delegate to the Democratic national convention of 1896, and an unsuccessful independent candidate for mayor of Chicago, 1899. He is the author of Our Penal Machinery and its Victims; Live Questions. He died at Joliet, Ill., March 12, 1902.\n\nAMES, Julia A., editor, was born in Livingston county, Ill., Oct. 14, 1861.

She died Dec. 12, 1891.\n\nANDREWS, Edmund, surgeon, was born in Putney, Vt., April 22, 1824. After his graduation from the University of Michigan in 1849 he took up the study of medicine, receiving the degrees of M.D. and A.M. in 1852. From 1851 to 1853 he was demonstrator of anatomy in the university, and in 1853-54 was also assistant lecturer on anatomy. In 1854 and 1855 he was professor of comparative anatomy and demonstrator of human anatomy, resigning to accept a position in the Rust medical college. He went to Chicago in 1856, where he became a prominent surgeon. He aided in founding the Chicago medical college, and was made professor of the principles and practices of surgery and of clinical and military surgery in that institution. At the outbreak of the civil war, he joined the 1st Illinois light artillery as hospital surgeon. After the war he visited the chief European hospitals. He was surgeon-in-chief of Mercy hospital, consulting surgeon of various charitable institutions, and taught the science of surgery in the Northwestern university medical school. He made many valuable improvements in surgical instruments and his original investigations led to the use of free incision, digital exploration, and disinfection of lumbar abscesses, which treatment had been supposed unsafe. He published a work, Rectal and Aural Surgery, which passed through several editions. He was for many years president of the Chicago academy of science, and president of the Illinois state medical society. In 1881 he received the degree of LL.D. from the University of Michigan.\n\nARNOLD, George, author, was born in New York city, June 24, 1834. Before he arrived at school age his parents removed to Illinois, where he attended the public schools until his fifteenth year; they then settled at Strawberry Farms, N.J. Having a talent for drawing, he entered the studio of a painter in New York, but soon abandoned his purpose of becoming an artist and devoted himself to literature. His contributions to Vanity Fair and the New York Leader soon brought him into popular favor, and a series of articles, entitled the McArone Papers, added to his reputation, and established his fame as a humorist. His poems are remarkable for their sweetness and delicacy of sentiment. His works were collected after his death by William Winter, and published in two duodecimo volumes. The Jolly Old Pedagogue is his best-known poem. He died Nov. 3. 1865.\n\nARNOLD, Isaac Newton, statesman, was born at Hartwick, Otsego county, N.Y., Nov. 30, 1815, son of George W. Arnold, physician, who emigrated from Rhode Island in 1800 and settled in the wilderness of western New York. In 1835 he was admitted to the bar, and the following year removed to the village of Chicago, Ill. When Chicago was organized as a city, he was elected city clerk and subsequently held other municipal offices. He was a representative in the Illinois state legislature, 1842-43, and in 1856; a presidential elector in 1844, and was elected to the 37th and 38th congresses, serving, 1861-65.

He served in the civil war, being a 1st lieutenant in the 10th Connecticut volunteers, which formed a part of the Burnside expedition against North Carolina. After the battle of Newbern he was promoted to a captaincy, and took part in the movement from Hilton Head, S.C., against Charleston. He was repeatedly detailed as judge-advocate of regimental and brigade court-martial. In 1863 the impairment of his health led him to resign. He was professor in the Boys Academy, Albany, 1864-67; at St. Johns College, Annapolis, Md., 1867-68; at the Illinois state university in 1868, and at Rutgers college, where he held the chair of history, political economy and constitutional law, 1868-82.

He was brought by his father to Philadelphia in 1815. Being left fatherless at an early age, he supported himself and his brother by following the occupation of a weaver. In 1830 he removed with his brother to Springfield, Ill., where he studied law, was admitted to the bar, and established himself in practice. His oratorical ability brought him into prominence, and in 1837 he was elected a member of the state legislature. In 1840 he took his seat in the state senate. In 1842 he was one of three Whig candidates for the office of representative in Congress from Illinois before the nominating convention, John J.

He volunteered for service in the Mexican war in 1848, raised a regiment in Illinois, and fought gallantly in the battles between Vera Cruz and the city of Mexico. General Shields being incapacitated in the engagement at Cerro Gordo, Colonel Baker was given the command of his brigade and led it during the remainder of the campaign. Returning to Illinois at the close of the war he was elected a representative to the 31st Congress in 1848. In 1850 he declined a nomination to the 32d Congress and became interested in the Panama railroad. He removed in 1851 to California, where he led the bar as the most eloquent orator in the state. In 1860 he took up his residence in Oregon, and was elected in the same year U. S. senator. He took his seat, March 4, 1861.

The son acquired a good education, and in 1790 taught school in Monongahela. The following year he began to preach, and in 1793 left his fathers house and travelled the circuit with the presiding elder. In 1794 he joined the itinerary, and travelled two years on the Alleghany circuit, being ordained as deacon in 1796. He was afterwards in Pittsburg, New York, Boston, Provincetown, Mass., and in Nantucket. In 1807 he returned to Virginia and remained there until 1815, when he removed to Chillicothe, Ohio, to become editor of the Western Christian Monitor, at that time the only existing Methodist periodical. In 1817 he removed to Illinois, where he founded a settlement, and built up the town of Mt. Carmel, and, says a biographer, Showed himself the truly great man in all the details of this new business, planning public measures and economical arrangements, devising mechanical improvements, for which he had rare genius, directing the instruction of the youth and simplifying its modes, ministering as pastor to the congregation, and meanwhile advancing in his own personal studies and improvement. In 1822 he was at St. Louis, in the itinerant ministry, and in 1823 was made presiding elder of the Indiana district, which included eleven large circuits. As a preacher he was gifted with overpowering eloquence, though his style was quite free from any element of the sensational, and he was designated the Demosthenes of the West. He was the author of Essays on the Truth of Christian Religion (1811). He died Oct. 7, 1824.\n\nBEECHER, Edward, educator, was born at East Hampton, L.I., N.Y. Aug. 27, 1803, son of Lyman and Roxana (Foote) Beecher. He was graduated at Yale in 1822; fitted for the ministry at Andover, Mass., and New Haven, Conn., and was a tutor in the Hartford high school and at Yale, in 1825. He was pastor of the Park St. Congregational church, Boston, Mass., 1826-30, president of Illinois college, Jacksonville Ill., 1830-44, pastor of the Salem St. church, Boston, 1844-55, and of the Congregational church at Galesburg, Ill., 1855-70. He was also professor of Biblical exegesis in the Chicago theological seminary, became assistant to his brother in the editorial management of the Christian Union at Brooklyn, N.Y. in 1872, and pastor of the Congregational church at Parkville, N.Y. in 1885. He was also editor-in-charge of the Congregationalist for several years. He was run over by a railroad train in 1888 and although he had his leg amputated, entirely recovered from the shock. The degree of D.D. was conferred upon Mr. Beecher by Marietta college in 1841. His best known works are: The Conflict of Ages and The Concord of Ages, in which he announces the view that man is in a progressive state; the present life being the outcome of a former one, and the preparation of another life after death. Evil, however, will continue in the future life, and the struggle between it and good will still go on until some far-off future, when evil will be finally subdued, and universal harmony be forever established. The utterance of such radical views in regard to the future life necessarily made a profound impression upon the thought of the day and aroused much comment. His publications include: Address on the Kingdom of God (1827); Six Sermons on the Nature, Importance and Means of Eminent Holiness throughout the Church (1835); Statement of Anti-slavery Principles (1837); History of the Alton Riots (1838); Baptism: its Import and Modes (1850); The Conflict of Ages (1853); The Concord of Ages (1860); History of Opinions on the Scriptural Doctrines of Future Retribution (1878), and The Papal Conspiracy (1885).

He was graduated from Illinois college, Jacksonville, in 1843, his half-brother, Edward, being at the time president of the institution. He was master of a grammar school in Philadelphia for two years, and then principal of the High school at Hartford, Conn. In 1852 he formed and assumed the charge of the New England Congregational church at Williamsburg, Brooklyn, L. I. In 1854 he accepted a call from the Independent Congregational church of Elmira, N. Y., afterwards known as the Park church. Here his success throughout a long pastorate was very marked. At first he had a small congregation, with many financial and other burdens, and no suitable church building; and afterwards a church of nearly one thousand members, a Sunday school with as many children in attendance, and a church building well fitted for worship, instruction, and social home-church life, where he introduced novel and successful methods of church work. During the civil war he was for a time chaplain of the 141st New York volunteers. Mr. Beecher was always broad-minded, generous-hearted, genial and unpretentious, an all-round man in religion, politics and social intercourse; not the slave of any past opinions, but suiting his methods and views to the present. His writings consisted principally of editorials and articles furnished the Elmira Advertiser & Gazette under the head of Miscellany. In 1870 he published a volume of locates entitled Our Seven Churches one of them on the Episcopal church having an especially large and separate circulation. In 1853 he visited France and England; in 1864-65, South America; in 1873, England; and in 1884, California. His death occurred at Elmira, N.Y., on the same date as that of his sister, Mary Foote (Beecher) Perkins, March 14, 1900.\n\nBEECHER, William Henry, clergyman, was born at East Hampton, N.Y., Jan. 15, 1802; the eldest son of Lyman and Roxana (Foote) Beecher. His father directed his studies until he entered Andover theological seminary. He was ordained a clergyman in the Congregational church in 1830, and took his first pastorate at Newport, R.I. In 1833 Yale college conferred upon him the honorary degree of A.M. He went to Ohio in 1837 and located in Putnam, Muskingum county. He remained in the Western Reserve some years, engaged in missionary work, and returned to New York to fill a pastorate at Batavia. He returned to Ohio and preached at Toledo, where he established a church, of which he was pastor for several years, and was made president of Illinois college, Jacksonville, in 1843. The climate undermined his health, and he returned east and labored in Reading and North Brookfield, Mass., at which latter place he also served as postmaster.

During the Mexican was he served as captain of a company in the 2d Illinois volunteers, and took an active part in the battle of Buena Vista. He represented Illinois in the national house of representatives in the 31st, 32d and 33d congresses, from December, 1849, to March 3, 1855, and his emphatic opposition to the Missouri compromise involved him in a controversy with southern Democrats. The question as to the bravery of the soldiers from the north as compared with that shown by the south in the Mexican war led to a debate with Jefferson Davis, and resulted in Mr. Bissell being challenged by Mr. Davis. He accepted the challenge, and chose muskets as the weapons to be used at thirty paces. The friends of Mr. Davis interfered at this juncture and the duel was never fought. On the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska bill, Mr. Bissell separated from the Democratic party and was elected governor of Illinois on the Republican ticket, serving by re-election from 1856 until his death, which occurred at Springfield, Ill., March 18, 1860.\n\nBLACK, John Charles, statesman, was born at Lexington, Miss., Jan. 27, 1839.

He was prominent with his regiment in thirteen battles and skirmishes and in two great sieges. He was wounded at Pea Ridge Ark., and again at Prairie Grove, Ark. These wounds being in his arms, he was incapacitated for field service and entered the invalid corps. At the close of the war he resigned his commission and returned to his home in Danville, Ill. It was his purpose to return to Crawfordville and complete his collegiate course, but he concluded to immediately take up the study of law at Chicago, and in 1867 he was admitted to the bar of the supreme court of Illinois, and to that of the supreme court of the United States in 1869.

His education was obtained in an academy at Chicago, and at Knox college, Galesburg, Ill. His limited means did not enable him to pursue a full course, and for a number of years he worked as a mechanic in Chicago. He invented a process for half-tone engraving, and made the first half-tone cut ever produced in Chicago, that of Chief Justice Fuller of the supreme court. While supporting himself as a mechanic, he studied law, and was admitted to the Illinois bar. In 1861 he was elected judge of Cook county for the term of four years, and was re-elected in 1865.

Helmer, assumed the editorship of the Chicago Legal News.\n\nBRADWELL, Myra (Colby), lawyer, was born in Manchester, Vt., Feb. 12, 1831, daughter of Eben and Abigail (Willey) Colby. Her childhood was passed in Western New York, whence, in 1843, her parents removed to Schaumburg, a town near Chicago. Her education was acquired at a seminary in Elgin, where she later became an instructor, afterward teaching in Cook, Kane, and Lake counties, Illinois, and in private and public schools in Memphis, Tenn. In 1852 she was married to James B. Bradwell, a Chicago lawyer, and studied law under the instruction of her husband. In 1858 she was refused admission to the bar, on the ground of her being a woman. The case was carried to the supreme court of the United States with the same result. Twenty years later she received, without renewed request, a license to practise in Illinois. In 1868 she began the publication of the Chicago Legal News, which she continued to conduct, up to the time of her death. Mrs. Bradwell was actively interested in philanthropic work, being one of the founders of the Illinois industrial school for girls, and devoting much time to private charities. She was a member of the womans branch of the Illinois centennial association, vice-president of the first woman suffrage convention in Chicago, a member of the board of lady managers of the Worlds Columbian exposition at Chicago in 1893, and chairman of the committee on law reform of its auxiliary congress.

He re-organized the returned Ohio regiments at Camp Dennison; was in command at Natchez from July, 1864, to May, 1865; was appointed presiding officer of the commission which met to examine into the cotton claims, and was mustered out of service with the rank of major-general of volunteers at the close of hostilities, when he revived railroad interests in the south. In 1872-73 he edited the Illinois State Journal; in 1873 he removed to Ripon, Wis., and practised law until 1877, when he was appointed by President Hayes governor of Idaho. At the expiration of his term in 1880 he resumed the practice of his profession at Ripon, Wis.

From 1887 until 1897 he was professor of geology and mineralogy in the University of Missouri. He was made a member of various scientific societies, and, besides, the volumes incidental to his geological surveys, he has written several hundred articles of scientific interest, chiefly geological, published in various pamphlets.\n\nBROSS, William, journalist, was born at Montague, Sussex county, N.J., Nov. 4, 1813. He acquired an academic education, was graduated from Williams college in 1838, and taught school until 1848, when he took up his residence in Chicago, Ill., where he was a bookseller and publisher. He was one of the founders of the Daily Democratic Press in 1852, which was consolidated with the Chicago Tribune in 1858, and at the time of his death was president of the Tribune association. From 1865 to 1869 he was lieutenant-governor of Illinois, and in that capacity signed the thirteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States, on behalf of the state, which was the first of all the states to adopt that amendment.

In 1861 he was appointed United States senator by Governor Yates, to succeed Stephen A. Douglas, who died June 3, but the appointment was not confirmed by the legislature of Illinois, and W. A. Richardson was elected to fill the unexpired term. In the senate he served from 1861 to 1863, and actively supported all the war measures of the government, except the confiscation bill. In 1866 he was appointed Secretary of the Interior in the cabinet of President Johnson, and for a time acted also as attorney-general. At the close of Johnsons administration he resumed the practice of the law, which he followed at Quincy, Ill., until his death, Aug. 10, 1881.\n\nBRYAN, Charles Page, diplomatist, was born in Chicago, Ill., in 1856, son of Thomas Barbour Bryan (q. v.). He was educated at the University of Virginia and was graduated at Columbian law school in 1878. He was admitted to the bar in that year and in 1879 removed to Colorado, where he served as a representative in the state legislature and as colonel in the military staff of Governor Eaton. He returned to Chicago in 1883; served four terms in the state legislature and visited Europe twice in the interest of the Worlds Columbian Exposition. He also served as colonel on the staffs of Governors Fifes, Eglesby and Altgeld of Illinois; was appointed envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to China in October, 1897; was transferred to Brazil in January, 1898, and to Switzerland in September, 1902.\n\nBRYAN, William Jennings, statesman, was born at Salem, Marion county, Ill., March 19, 1860; son of Silas Lillard and Mariah Elizabeth (Jennings) Bryan, grandson of John and Nancy (Lillard) Bryan, and great-grandson of William Bryan, born in Culpeper county, Va., about 1765. His grandfather removed from Culpeper county to Point Pleasant in western Virginia shortly after his marriage, and in 1852 his son, Silas Lillard, was married and removed to Salem, Marion county, Ill., where he was a lawyer of high standing, for eight years state senator, and for twelve years a circuit judge. Until his tenth year, William was taught at home, then entering the public schools, and, in 1875, Whipple academy, the preparatory school of Illinois college, at Jacksonville. When fourteen years old he joined the Presbyterian church, and in 1880 made his first appearance as a speaker at a political meeting. In June, 1881, he was graduated at Illinois college with the highest honors, and was also chosen class orator. In 1884, by invitation of the faculty, he delivered the masters oration, and received the degree of M.A. During his college course he won five prizes. Immediately after his graduation from college he entered the Union college of law in Chicago, where he had as a classmate Henry, son of Lyman Trumbull, and thus gained the privilege of the use of Mr. Trumbulls law office for study after school hours. He was admitted to the bar, beginning his law practice July 4, 1883. On Oct. 1, 1884, he was married to Mary Elizabeth Baird of Perry, Ill., who afterwards studied her husbands profession, and won admission to the bar, not for the purpose of practising, but in order to be in intelligent sympathy with Mr. Bryans business life. Until 1887 he practised in Jacksonville, Ill., removing in that year to Lincoln, Neb., where he became a law partner with Mr. Talbot, but did not share in his railroad business. He early took an interest in political affairs, was a student of the science of government, and soon became known for his knowledge of political questions. In 1890 he received the unanimous nomination of the Democratic party as representative from the first Nebraska district to the 52nd Congress. He was elected in an overwhelming Republican district, receiving 6,713 more votes than his chief competitor, a result attributable largely to his exceptional ability as a platform orator and the persistency with which he personally prosecuted the canvass. His reputation had preceded him to Congress, and he was placed on the Ways and Means Committee, one of the youngest members to be ever thus honored. His speech on the tariff, delivered March 16, 1892, was made a campaign document in the canvass of that year, resulting in the second election of Mr. Cleveland, and was universally commended for its lucid statement of the tariff question then at issue. Though a Democrat, and running on a Democratic platform, he was re-elected in 1892 in a district which gave the Republican state ticket a plurality of six thousand at the same election. In the 53rd Congress he was again placed upon the Ways and Means Committee. He also took an active part in the silver debate, which began with the extraordinary session, and on Aug. 16, 1893, made a speech in favor of The gold and silver coinage of the Constitution. In this speech he advocated the free coinage of silver at the ratio of sixteen to one, without waiting for the consent of any other nations, claiming that the adoption of a bimetallic standard by the United States would force the other nations, England only excepted, to adopt the standard as final. On July 4, 1892, he made a notable speech in Tammany Hall, New York city, that greatly increased his reputation as an orator, and on May 30, 1894, he delivered an oration at Arlington cemetery, Virginia, at the memorial services over the soldiers graves, which was listened to by the President and his cabinet, and was widely published as an exceptional oratorical effort. As political editor of the Omaha World Herald he represented his paper at the Republican convention at St. Louis, June 19, 1896, and there was the first newspaper man to obtain a definite acknowledgment of the intention of the leaders to stand for gold, notwithstanding the declaration in their platform in favor of bimetallism. This, to him, radical measure greatly increased his faith in the success of the Democratic party, if it could be induced to adopt the free coinage of silver as the political issue of the campaign. When the convention met at Chicago, July 9, 1896, Mr. Bryan was a delegate, and while awaiting the report of the committee on platform he addressed the assembly. His speech electrified the audience, the different delegations bringing forward their standard, and clustering them around the young orator. One of the oldest conservative and experienced newspaper correspondents of a gold organ telegraphed to his paper: As he (Bryan) spoke I thought I could see the presidential halo about his brow. The next day Mr. Bryan was found to have captured the convention, and after the heroic fight made by the gold standard Democrats to stem the silver tide, Mr. Bryan was nominated as the Democratic standard bearer. At the national convention of the Silver party at St. Louis, July 24, Mr. Bryan received the nomination of that party as he did that of the Peoples party. In the canvass that followed Mr. Bryan took the stump, and in the course of the campaign made 592 speeches in 477 cities and towns, in 27 states of the Union, travelling 18,831 miles between July 12 and Nov. 2, 1896. This was an example of industry and earnestness unprecedented in the history of politics in America. At the general election Nov. 3, 1896, he was defeated in the election, receiving 176 electoral and 6,351,042 popular votes. He became colonel of the 3rd Nebraska volunteers July 13, 1898, and joined the 7th army corps at Jacksonville, Fla., which corps was ordered to Savannah, Ga. He resigned from the army Dec. 10, 1898, and entered actively into the campaign against the annexation of the Philippine Islands, declaring that the United States could not permanently endure half republic and half colony, half free and half vassal.

She was married when eighteen years old to Francis F., son of Pierre Chouteau, Jr., and partner in the firm of P. Chouteau, Jr., & Co., fur traders. The newly married couple decided to make their home at a point on the Missouri river near Black Snake Hills, which location became the site of the city of St. Joseph, Mo. The journey was made on a flat-boat, and after living there two years they removed to the present site of Kansas City, Mo., where they established the first trading post and built in the woods the first log house erected in that section. Here her husband acquired title to large tracts of land and extended his domain to the mouth of the Kansas river, making it to include all the valuable farming land in the vicinity. The city of Kansas City was subsequently built upon a portion of this property, and squatters located on other sections and gave title to new settlers. The question of ownership in this way became much involved, and long and expensive litigation ensued, in which Mrs. Chouteau after her husbands death sought to recover possession, her claims amounting to over $5,000,000. The statutes of limitation operated to deprive her of her rights, the decision being made by the highest courts, in November, 1888, but two weeks before her death. She was a liberal benefactress and distributed her large fortune in promoting the interests of the Roman Catholic church, of which she was a devout member. She built in Kansas City the first church edifice, and her liberality during her life expanded with the growth of the church and its institutions in that locality.
