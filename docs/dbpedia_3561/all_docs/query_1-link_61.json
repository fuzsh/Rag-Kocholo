OH. She was born Nov 23, 1836 Big Run, Athens Co. Ohio, died April 14, 1881 and is buried Paint Rock Cemetery, Logan Co. AR. Silas m. 2nd Letha Yielding Lowry Oct 16, 1881 Logan Co. AR. She was a widow. They had two children and divorced. She was born about 1845. She died 1929. She remarried to a Smith. Silas m. 3rd Arbelle E. Copeland Jan 1, 1885. She was born Aug 12, 1846 AL and died Jan 20, 1940 Logan Co. AR at the home of her daughter, Millie Lee and is buried Paint Rock. She was a member of the Free Will Baptist Church.\n\nSilas enlisted for a term of 3 years or duration of the Civil War. He was a private in Captain Daniel M. Bates Company A 18th Regiment of the Ohio Infantry Volunteers Feb 16, 1864 at Marietta, Ohio.\n\nRecords of his pension papers and copies of the roll calls during the war show the following information: He was listed as a farmer at the time of enlistment, his post office was Big Run, Athens Co. Ohio, his description lists color of eyes as blue, light hair and complexion, height 5 ft 7in. He spent many months in Chattanooga, Tennessee. On Oct 9, 1865 he was discharged at Augusta, Georgia. The war was over.\n\nOct 6th, 1868 Silas and his wife, Abigail, with 5 children left Ohio for Arkansas. They journey took three months. They traveled by train and boat down the Ohio River and the Mississippi River and up the Arkansas River to Roseville, AR. Silas' brother, John, and Abigail's brother, Truman Driggs were already living in Driggstown near Paris, Arkansas.\n\nJohn Shirley, Silas' brother, sold Truman Driggs 160 acres in Driggs. He set aside a section for a school.\n\nIn the Fall of 1871 Silas fell from a tree while gathering nuts near his home in near Paris, Arkansas. He dislocated his left wrist. This information was found in a form filled out possibly for a claim. It was filed with his pension papers.\n\nSilas purchased 40 acres at Paint Rock near Paris, Arkansas July 19, 1879 for $125. He cleared the land and built a two story house and lived there until he died. He grew cotton and owned a cotton gin. He planted many kinds of fruit trees, had a large garden, raised hogs, chickens, had a cow and a horse.\n\nSilas preserved his vegetables by digging a large circular hole in the ground. Straw was spread over the bottom of the hole and the vegetables placed on the straw, then covered over with more straw and dirt. They had plenty to eat all winter. The smoke house was filled with meat.\n\nFour more children were born to Abigail and Silas near Paris, Arkansas, three sons and a daughter. The seventh child, George Quinn, died in his youth. Abigail died April 14, 1881.\n\nSilas married Letha Yielding Lowry Oct 16, 1881. They were the parents of two sons, Elmer and Owen Parmer. She was also step mother to eight children.\n\nOne day Silas and the boys were working in the field near the house. John Wesley, oldest son of Silas and Abigail, heard his little sister crying and crying. He knew something must be wrong so he ran to the house. His sister was sitting on the side of her bed and he could see she'd been beaten. He yelled \"Jesus crept, Moses wept and under the bed the devil slept\". Letha ran from the house. John Wesley went back to the field and said nothing. When evening came, they went into the house. There was no supper nor was Letha there. Silas never said a word and didn't ask any questions.\n\nLetha and Silas divorced October 4, 1884. Elmer was under 2 years of age and Owen Parmer was seven months old. Silas agreed to let Letha keep them provided she lived nearby. Gradually she started moving further and further away. Silas, who always wore a beard, shaved it off and went to Letha's and took Elmer and Owen Parmer. No one recognized him, not even the kids. Silas raised the boys.\n\nSilas married Abelle Copeland January 1, 1885 and they were the parents of two daughters, Myrtle and Millie. Arbelle was a very sweet person and a great mother and grandmother to Silas' family.\n\nThe grandchildren tell how they looked forward to going to Grandpa Silas' house as he always gave them a piece of candy. He kept a large box by his fireplace. In it he stored peppermint sticks. He always had red delicious apples in barrels in the basement of the old house. He was very fond of children.\n\nSilas and Arbelle would sit by the fire and smoke pipes and have a piece of candy before going to bed every night.\n\nLogan County Arkansas was formed from parts of Franklin, Johnson, Scott and Yell counties and this was approved March 22, 1871. At that time however, Logan County was named Sarber County. Silas was was elected County Treasurer Oct 13, 1874. An act of the General Assembly changed the name of Sarber to Logan County December 15, 1875. Silas served as County Treasurer until 1878. He hid the county money under the house through a trap door. There no safes in the county offices.\n\nSilas' favorite word was 'by cracky'. He had a deep voice and always wore a beard. He was strong and could lieft a 500 pound bale of cotton. He had long arms and could reach his knees standing straight up. He became blind in his old age.\n\nSilas was in the hospital in Paris, Arkansas for about five days before his death Feb 29, 1924. He lived 87 years, 10 months, and 10 days. Cause of death was listed on death certificate as 'strangulated inguinal hernia'.\n\nSilas Shirley\n\nAbigail Driggs Shirley\n\nLetha Lowry Shirley\n\nSilas and Arbelle Copeland Shirley\n\nChildren of Silas and Abigail Driggs :\n\n(a).

April 7, 1916 in Little Rock, Pulaski, AR. and is buried in Paint Rock Cemetery, m. Francis Marion Williams Aug 21, 1882\n\nParis Express, Thursday, April 13, 1916\n\nMrs. Martha Williams of Little Rock, died at their home last Friday. Deceased was the eldest daughter of Mrs. Silas Shirley of this county, and the remains were brought here for interment in Paint Rock cemetery, near the scenes of her childhood days. The funeral Sunday was largely attended by relatives and friends of the family.\n\nParis Express, Thursday, April 27, 1916\n\nIn Memory of Mrs. Martha Williams\n\nApril 7th 1916 the Angel of Death visited the home of Marion Williams, 2900 State St., Little Rock, and took from it the mother of that home.\n\nShe was the daughter of Silas Shirley and was raised at Pint Rock near Paris. She was born at Athena, Ohio, and moved here Oct. 1868. In August 1882, she married Marion Williams. To this happy union were born three sons, two dying in infancy. The other one (Herbert) has ever made his home with his parents and the three little grandchildren will miss her love and kindness as much or more than her husband, son, adopted daughter-in-law.\n\nShe was a Freewill Baptist and had lived a Christian life from early youth. Funeral services were held at Paint Rock church Sunday at 1 p.m. Rev. Andrew Best assisted by Rev. Silas Lovett conducted the service. Interment in Paint Rock Cemetery.\n\nA blood vessel bursting upon her brain (Cerebral Hemorrhage) was the cause of her death. All that skilled Physicians and nurses and loving hands could do was done but all of no avail. She fought the hand of the Grim Monster of Death with a heroism almost unheard of but it was a case beyond the power of mortal hands. Her suffering was beyond the power of language to describe.\n\nWe cannot see God's wisdom in taking a Christian life, a life that was so near and dear to us, from us. Perhaps it was to draw us nearer to him.\n\nAll we can do is to bow resigned unto the Father's will and prepare to meet her beyond the clouds of earthly cares.\n\nThe many beautiful floral offerings, the many consoling talks given by friends lightens the burden of grief but the greater consolation is that she was prepared to go.\n\nLong after all that was mortal of her returns to the mother earth from whence it came, may her noble life still be fresh in our memories and lead us to a better life.\n\nElmer A.
