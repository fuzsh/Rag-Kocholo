Mary Susie Boatright, daughter of Wm. Hay who died at Collinwood about two years ago, Susie was then a school girl.\n\nShortly after the death of her father she was courted by a young man by the name of Boatright from Cherry Hill, Ala. She gave him her heart and hand in holy wedlock, but soon she lost her health and drifted into tuberculosis and was induced to try Dr. Burns, but she was too far gone for any doctor to restore her to health again.\n\nHer mother rented a suit of rooms in the Rholing block, where they were living when the death angel came and took Susie to that beautiful home above to meet her dear father, who was waiting at the beautiful gate to welcome her.\n\nSurrounded by a concourse of loving friends, she fell asleep in the arms of Jesus on Sunday night July 16, 1916. Susie bore her suffering with patience until the good Lord saw proper to call her home. She was about nineteen years old and had lived a devoted life from her childhood up. She leaves a mother and three sisters.\n\nHer mother came to Lawrenceburg in distitue circumstances but cast her lot among those good Christian people, no better people can be found anywhere, and they responded nobly to the wants of this worthy family.\n\nThe funeral services were conducted in a very impressive way by Prof. E. O. Coffman of Lawrenceburg, and the remains of little Susie were laid to rest in the Cedar Hill Cemetery on the 17th. The bereaved family has the heartfelt sympathy of the entire community.\n\nTennessee, Death Records, 1908-1958 Name: Mary Susie Boatright Gender: Female Birth Date: 18 Sep 1897 Birth Place: Lawrence, Tennessee Age: 18 Death Date: 11 Jul 1916 Death Place: Lawrenceburg, Lawrence, Tennessee Father's Name: Will Hay Father's Birth Place: Maury, Tennessee Mother's Name: Sallie Smith Mother's Birth Place: Lawrence, Tennessee\n\n10-1781B.
