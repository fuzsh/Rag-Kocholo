        "text": "Today I spent about 2 hours validating that the computer-generated indexes already created — and not all 50 states are yet done — were accurate. I worked on Indiana, Oregon, and Arizona. Technology has come such a long way in the past 10 years; I am amazed at how accurate the indexed data appears already.\n\nYou can validate names in a given state, or, if the name validation is complete, you can validate family groups. And the cool thing is you can select names, so for the family groups I was validating (in Oregon and Arizona) I specifically searched for COPPLE households. (And recognized some of the names I already have in my COPPLE tree on Ancestry.com)\n\nThere is plenty to do for anyone interested, and you can do just a little bit or do a lot — any amount helps get the indexing done faster.\n\nBack in the spring of 1935, three daughters were born to Mr. and Mrs. Jesse Ross Copple, who were Oklahoma natives living in Arizona at the time.\n\nI believe this Jesse Ross was married to Mary Elvira Goins, and was kin to me through both my Copple and Wright lines. His 3rd great-grandparents were Jacob Peter Copple and Mary Elizabeth Garren (or Fouts). Their son Jacob Peter Copple married Elizabeth Wright, who was also kin to me, being the granddaughter of Richard and Ann [- ? -] Wright, my 7th great-grandparents.\n\nThe likely family tree of these triplets, my distant cousins, is below:\n\n“Girl Triplets Born in Gilbert,” Arizona Republic (Phoenix, Arizona), 3 May 1935, p. 38, col 3; Newspapers.com (https://www.newspapers.com : accessed 25 Sept 2020).\n\nThis is the wedding notice of my great-great grandparents, Samuel Adams Englehart and Libby Copple (here listed as Libby Jewell). I posted about Sam here. He was 26 in December 1878 when he married Libby Jewell at the home of her adoptive mother, Mrs. Polly Esther (Keeler) (Jewell) (Fike) Rose.\n\nLibby was 17 years old on her wedding day. She was born in Mendocino County, California in 1861 to Ben Franklin Copple and his wife Phoebe (Harvey) Copple, who died in childbirth or very soon after Libby was born. But that’s a story for another post.\n\n“Married: Englehart-Jewell,” Healdsburg Enterprise (Healdsburg, California), 26 Dec 1878, pg 2, col 1; digital images, California Digital Newspaper Collection, (http://cdnc.ucr.edu : accessed 3 Sep 2020).\n\nLucile McDonald, a native of Collin County, Texas, married Earl Harold Copple in Kerr County, Texas (in what is known as the Texas Hill Country) on 17 February, 1941. She was 24 years old.\n\nHer husband Earl was 32 years old and also a Texas native, being from Kimble County (adjacent to Kerr.) Earl was one of 10 children and the youngest son born to Virgil O. and Rosa (McDonald) Copple. Earl may be related to me twice over, as his paternal grandparents were cousins in some degree.\n\nThe bride was married in blue, with a corsage of pink carnations.\n\n“McDonald-Copple Marriage Solemnized,” Kerrville Mountain Sun (Kerrville, Texas), 20 Feb 1941, pg 2, col 3; Newspapers.com (https://www.newspapers.com : accessed 21 June 2020).\n\nBeulah Elaine Copple, daughter of Henry Ellis Copple and Julia (Williams) Copple was possibly my 4th cousin 4 times removed (a descendant of Nicholas Copple who died in 1808 in Rowan County, NC, and his wife).\n\nBeulah was born in 1892 in South Carolina, married Rev. Samuel Long in 1916, and had two sons. She died at the age of 50.\n\nThe wedding notice ran to two columns, and was quite detailed about what the bridal party wore. Here is only the first column.\n\n“Monroe [Beulah Copple marries Sam Long],” The News and Observer (Raleigh, North Carolina), 3 Sep 1916, pg 7, col 6; Newspapers.com (https://www.newspapers.com : accessed 31 August 2020).\n\nAs best as I can determine, Claiborne Copple of Jackson County, Indiana — who, in this article is apparently suspicious of his wife’s fidelity — is a possible distant cousin of mine via his father David (1794 – 1835) and grandfather John (1768 – 1838).\n\nClaiborne was born circa 1827 probably in Kentucky (but possibly in southern Indiana), likely one of at least 10 children. He married Mary Holt, his first wife, in Clark County, Indiana in 1856, and resided in Clark County at the time of the 1860 census. By 1863, though, when he signed up for the Civil War draft, he was in Jackson County, Indiana. His wife died circa 1876, and he remarried to an Elizabeth King in 1877.\n\nHe was found in the 1880 census in Jackson County, Indiana. (As an aside, I have not found any information on when he died, nor have I found him on the 1850 and 1870 censuses.) It is apparently wife #2 (Eliza) who was “in the company of James Cole”.\n\n“He Smelt a Mouse,” Jackson County Banner (Brownstown, Indiana), 2 Nov 1882, pg 5, col 4; Newspapers.com (https://www.newspapers.com : accessed 7 February 2020).\n\ncathymd, “Copple/Wright Line – DNA Kinship — Working Data Tree”, Ancestry.com (https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/person/tree/62591313/person/36185456378/facts : accessed 7 February 2020).\n\nIn October 1924, a teen-aged Benjamin Garl Copple (c 1906-1986) was accused of attempted murder of a young woman and man, while he was under the influence of liquor. Ben was married at the time, to a Bernice Amott his “child bride”, who was only 15 at the time of the article in February 1925. Ben had reportedly been working for the sheriff until the day before, under an assumed name (not given in the article) and an assumed age (22). His father, A. M. Copple [Alpheus Marvin] testified on his behalf.\n\nBen Garl Copple was born sometime between 1903 and 1907 probably in Colorado to Alpheus Marvin Copple (1881 – 1944) and Lucinda Mary Whitlock (1884 – 1978), both natives of North Carolina. The family was living in Las Animas County, Colorado in 1910, and in Salt Lake City in 1920.\n\nAfter the shooting incident in October 1924, Ben married Bernice Amott (who was with him on the day of the shooting, per the article below) on 26 January 1925. The article states Bernice was filing for an annulment of the marriage and that must have gone through, as Ben married Edith Olga Shafer on 27 June 1925.\n\nThe 1930 census found Ben and Edith, with their daughter Joyce, in Salt Lake City, and Ben worked as a laborer. In 1940, they were in the Los Angeles area, where Ben worked as a truck driver.\n\nBenjamin Garl’s paternal grandfather shared the same name as my 3rd great grandfather: Benjamin Franklin Copple, but that Ben Copple lived his entire life in North Carolina. Ben Franklin Copple’s parents were Henry and Frances “Franky” (Miller) Copple. Henry’s parents are unknown; however Frances Miller’s father Isaac Miller lived in the vicinity with 3 Copple households in Davidson County, NC, which I’ve traced as my kin. It is possible — but not certain — that Henry’s parents were Jacob Copple and Delilah Plummer.\n\nIf so, these Salt Lake City Copples are distant cousins to me.\n\n“Got Liquor as Undercover Man,” Salt Lake Telegram (Salt Lake City, Utah), 18 Feb 1925, pg 2, col 8; Newspapers.com (https://www.newspapers.com : accessed 13 January 2020).\n\nGlenn Copple (1888 – 1965) was appointed Deputy to Yuma County (Arizona) District Attorney Henry C. Kelly.\n\nGlenn was born in Nov 1888 in Centralia, Illinois to Silas Bryan & Julia (Roper) Copple, who married in 1884. He was their second son. Silas Bryan Copple’s paternal great-grandparents were Jacob [Peter] Copple and [Mary] Elizabeth Garren [Pfoutz?], who are my 6th great-grandparents.\n\nGlenn was in the military from Aug 1917 to July 1919, and after arriving home back in Centralia, was a lawyer. He moved to Yuma, Arizona prior to January 1925, which is when he became the assistant District Attorney.\n\nHe married Janet Anne Burnell in 1934 in Phoenix, Maricopa County, and they had a son Gordon Burnell in April 1936 in Los Angeles County, California. The family was back in Yuma County, Arizona as of the 1940 census. Glenn died in Oct 1965, presumably in Arizona, but is buried in San Diego County, California. His widow died in 1982, and his son Gordon died in 1987 at the age of 51.\n\nGlenn was my 3rd cousin 4 times removed.\n\n“Attorney Glen Copple is Named,” The Morning Sun (Yuma, Arizona), 2 Jan 1925, pg 1, col 6; Newspapers.com (https://www.newspapers.com : accessed 13 January 2020).\n\nJames Garfield Copple may be my 3rd cousin 5 times removed. He was born either in Sep 1882 (according to the 1900 census) or on 8 Sep 1883 (according to the Draft Registration he filled out for World War I) or on 8 Sep 1884 (according to the Draft Registration he filled out for WWII).\n\nHis parents were Lemon Copple (c 1837 – c 1888) and Elizabeth (Daniels) Copple, who married in 1865 in Douglas County, Kansas. He married Jeanette Thomassen by 1916, when they were both living in Tulsa, Oklahoma. (The article below references the fact that he was a Tulsa businessman.) By 1920, he and his wife had 2 children, and were living in Indiana. As of 1930, when this article was published and during the census enumeration, the family was living in Cass County, Indiana, which is where Logansport is. Some time after 1942, he and his wife had moved to Tucson, Arizona, where he died in 1949.\n\nJames’ father, Lemon, was likely the son of Jacob Copple and Malinda Everman. After that, it gets unclear. There are numerous Jacob Copples and John Copples (the possible grandfather of Lemon) which are not clearly sorted out by most Ancestry.com users. But many Ancestry trees have Lemon in Illinois or Indiana, whereas he was clearly — at least according to the Federal Census records — in Kansas.\n\n“How Did you Happen to Come to Logansport,” Logansport Pharos-Tribune (Logansport, Indiana), 9 May 1930, pg 4, col 4; Newspapers.com (https://www.newspapers.com : accessed 27 Dec 2019)."
