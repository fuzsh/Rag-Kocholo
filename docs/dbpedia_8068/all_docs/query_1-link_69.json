Examples include .be (Belgium), .in (India), and .mx (Mexico). The rules for registration of ccTLDs vary by country. Some countries are unrestricted, meaning that anyone in the world can register, while others have certain restrictions, such as residency. The listing for each ccTLD indicates any restrictions.",
