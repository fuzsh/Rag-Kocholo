        "text": "Last updated January 10, 2022\n\nWhat are TLDs/domain extensions?\n\nHow did domain names appear?\n\nWhat are the most popular TLDs?\n\nWhich are the ones to avoid?\n\nHow many TLDs are there?\n\nThe most expensive domains in the world\n\nWhere should you register your domain name?\n\nWhat are the most popular TLDs?\n\nIt is not easy (may be even impossible) to get a completely accurate number of the registered domains of each TLD, as not all registries publish their domain count. That's why in the following table, we have made an overview of the data coming from 4 reputable providers: Verisign, DomainTools, W3Techs, and ZoneFiles.io. The table is sortable, just click on the title of the column.\n\nTLDVerisign ↕ DomainTools ↕ W3Techs ↕ ZoneFiles.io ↕ .com 143146,089,24349.3%144,129,895.net 13.1 10,105,5983.5%13,175,070.org 10.1 10,105,5984.8%10,130,631.de16.3 14,773,1542.1%7,303,903.icu 6,026,079 <0.1%6,020,041.uk13.3 10,971,078 1.7%5,554,029.ru5.7 4,832,5345.6% 4,972,532.info 4.5 3,411,2100.8%4,484,174.top 3.4 3,411,2100.1%3,418,124.xyz 2.5 2,524,1920.3%2,515,631.tk25.1 29,216,1740.1%404,591.cn23.0 14,948,6760.4%1,888,205.ga 5,668,021<0.1%205,664.cf 5,497,355<0.1%137,799.nl5.9 5,210,8760.5%2,293,373\n\nAs you can see from the data the only thing that all reports fully agree on is that .com still reigns supreme. Dotcom has become more or less synonymous with the World Wide Web, and it doesn’t seem like it will be dethroned any time soon.\n\nAs to country-code TLDs, as long as they keep their real numbers private, all we can enjoy are various flavors of speculation.\n\nYou can find information about the providers and their methodology below:\n\nWhich are the ones to avoid?\n\nSpamhaus.org (an organization fighting spam on the Internet) maintains a list of TLDs with the worst reputation based on the amount of email spam originating from them.\n\nTheir ranking uses a formula that is based on the number of registered domains and the number of \"bad\" domains. We strongly recommend that you check their website for the most current list (it is updated very frequently):\n\nPositionDomainBadness Index1..live5.792..buzz5.463..gq4.854..tk4.755..fit4.606..cf4.337..ga4.288..ml3.999..wang3.5510..top3.23\n\nThe most expensive domains in the world\n\nIt is speculated that the most expensive domain ever sold is cars.com. It was reportedly purchased for $872 million USD by the company Gannet Co., Inc.\n\nOther notable sales are these of CarInsurance.com, Insurance.com, VacationRentals.com, and PrivateJet.com, but these deals usually include transfer of other assets as well, or aren't verifiable.\n\nThe following list includes only all-cash sales of domains (not websites, or businesses including domains):"
