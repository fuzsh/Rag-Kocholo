        "text": ".SU was the country code top-level domain name assigned to the Soviet Union in 1990. Although the Soviet Union was officially dissolved in 1991, the domain name has been maintained and is still in use today. However, because the .su domain is less tightly regulated than other top-level domain names, the .su domain has attracted hackers, scammers, and cyber criminals. Of course, not all of the .su sites are malicious; plenty of legitimate .su sites exist as well.\n\n(Note: .ru is the top-level domain name that is currently assigned to Russia.)\n\nSatter, Raphael. Associated Press. (2013, May 31). Old Soviet Union Domain Name Attracts Cybercriminal Interest. Retrieved from http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2013/05/31/ussr-old-domain-name-attracts-cybercriminals.html\n\nThe acronym URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.\n\nA URL is essentially a reference (or address) to a website's unique location on the Internet. A URL is made up of several parts, and even if you're not familiar with the term \"URL,\" you're probably already familiar with its basic structure. The following are examples of simple URLs:\n\nhttp://www.usa.gov\n\nhttps://www.an.edu\n\nhttps://americannational.blackboard.com\n\nOne important part of a URL is the domain name. In the examples below, the domain names are written in red.\n\nhttp://www.usa.gov\n\nhttps://www.an.edu\n\nhttps://americannational.blackboard.com"
