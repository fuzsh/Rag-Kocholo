        "text": "This list of Internet top-level domains (TLD) contains top-level domains, which are those domains in the DNS root zone of the Domain Name System of the Internet. A list of the top-level domains by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is maintained at the Root Zone Database.[1] IANA also oversees the approval process for new proposed top-level domains for ICANN. As of April 2021 , their root domain contains 1502 top-level domains.[2][3] As of March 2021 , the IANA root database includes 1589 TLDs. That also includes 68 that are not assigned (revoked), 8 that are retired and 11 test domains.[1] Those are not represented in IANA's listing[2] and are not in root.zone file (root.zone file also includes one root domain).[4]\n\nTypes\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Top-level domain § Types\n\nIANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:[5]\n\ninfrastructure top-level domain (ARPA)\n\ngeneric top-level domains (gTLD)\n\ngeneric-restricted top-level domains (grTLD)\n\nsponsored top-level domains (sTLD)\n\ncountry code top-level domains (ccTLD)\n\ntest top-level domains (tTLD)\n\nOriginal top-level domains\n\n[edit]\n\nSeven generic top-level domains were created early in the development of the Internet, and predate the creation of ICANN in 1998.\n\nName: DNS names\n\nEntity: intended use\n\nAdministrator: managers\n\nNotes: general remarks\n\nIDN: support for internationalized domain names (IDN)\n\nDNSSEC: presence of DS records for Domain Name System Security Extensions\n\nName Entity Administrator[6] Notes IDN DNSSEC SLD IPv6 .com commercial Verisign This is an open TLD; any person or entity is permitted to register. Though originally intended for use by for-profit business entities, for a number of reasons it became the main TLD for domain names and is currently used by all types of entities including nonprofits, schools, and private individuals. Domain name registrations may be successfully challenged if the holder cannot prove an outside relation justifying reservation of the name,[7] to prevent \"squatting\". It was originally administered by the United States Department of Defense. Yes Yes Yes Yes .org organization Public Interest Registry This is an open TLD; any person or entity is permitted to register. Originally created as a miscellaneous category as stated in RFC 920 (October 1984) \"...any other domains meeting the second level requirements,\" and clarified in RFC 1591 (March 1994), \"This domain is intended as the miscellaneous TLD for organizations that didn't fit anywhere else. Some non-government organizations may fit here.\"[8][9] While mainly non-profits have used this domain, it was never restricted from miscellaneous use.

In the U.S., its use was restricted in 2001 to post-secondary institutions accredited by an agency on the list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies. This domain is therefore almost exclusively used by American colleges and universities. Some institutions, such as the Exploratorium, that do not meet the current registration criteria have grandfathered domain names.
