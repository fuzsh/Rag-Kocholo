These were:\n\n.com\n\nA gTLD originally denoted for commercial and business organisations but is now used by all kinds of websites.\n\n.org\n\nA gTLD originally denoted for non-profit organisations but is now used by a wider range of outfits including communities and schools.\n\n.net\n\nA gTLD originally denoted for companies working within the network technologies sector but is now being used by any website.\n\n.edu\n\nA gTLD originally denoted for educational institutions across the world but is currently only used in the US. It is also now officially an sTLD (see below).\n\n.mil\n\nA gTLD denoted for US military use only and remains so to this day. It is also now officially an sTLD.\n\n.gov\n\nA gTLD denoted for US government agencies only but today it is used by governmental bodies right across the US from states and towns to native American tribes â for example, there is the Native Sovereign Nations (NSN) Domain Program, which enables tribes to register a .gov domain. Finally, .gov is now officially an sTLD.\n\nFrom 6 to 1,600\n\nSince these six gTLDs kick started the process, the number of generic top level domains available has grown to nearly 1,600 today. Examples of gTLDs include .biz, .info, .store, .tech, and many more. Expect new gTLDs to continue being created as the need for new and original general top level domains continues to grow."
