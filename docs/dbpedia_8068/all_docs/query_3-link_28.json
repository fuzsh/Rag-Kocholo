        "text": "A broad overview of TLDs, and an up-to-date catalog of the available TLDs available for purchase, including .pizza and .ca.\n\nA top-level domain, or TLD, is the part of a URL that follows the last period, such as .com, .org, or .net. It's also known as a domain extension.\n\nWhen you register Squarespace domains, you can choose from the TLDs below.\n\nWe don't offer most country code TLDs, such as .ru, for registration or transfer.\n\nReview the registration terms column in the table below for how long you can initially register your domain. After your initial registration term is over, we'll charge the payment method on file for another year of domain registration. We’ll then continue to automatically renew your domain on an annual basis.\n\nTo transfer a domain to Squarespace, its TLD must be listed below. The price is what you'll pay for an additional year of registration.\n\nTo find a domain's price, you can search for it on our domain name search page or in your domains dashboard.\n\nDomains may be subject to state and local sales taxes. If your domain is subject to tax, you’ll see it added at checkout. To learn more, visit our guides on taxes in the United States, European Union, or Australia.\n\nIf you're interested in a TLD that isn't included in the list below, you can register one with a third-party provider and connect it to your Squarespace site instead.\n\nTip: You can register multiple similar domains (like as mydomain.com and mydomain.net) or use a TLD that matches the subject of your site (like mydomain.fishing or mydomain.jewelry).\n\nAvailable ccTLDs\n\nCountry code top-level domains (ccTLDs) follow different rules than most other TLDs we offer. The list below shows which ccTLDs are available for purchase through Squarespace and where you can find the specific requirements and features for each ccTLD.\n\nAustralia: .au and .com.au domains\n\nCanada: .ca domains\n\nCocos (Keeling) Islands: .cc domains\n\nEuropean Union: .eu domains\n\nFrance: .fr domains\n\nGermany: .de domains\n\nIndia: .co.in domains\n\nItaly: .it domains\n\nJapan: .jp domains\n\nMexico: .mx and .com.mx domains\n\nNew Zealand: .nz and .co.nz domains\n\nPalau: .pw domains\n\nPoland: .pl domains\n\nThe Netherlands: .nl domains\n\nUnited Kingdom: .co.uk, .org.uk and .uk domains\n\nUnited States: .us domains\n\nIf you're interested in a ccTLD that isn't included in the list, you can register one with a third-party provider and connect it to your Squarespace site instead.\n\nAvailable TLDs\n\nA-D\n\nTLD Registration terms (years) .academy 1 to 10 .accountant 1 to 10 .accountants 1 to 10 .actor 1 to 10 .agency 1 to 10 .airforce 1 to 10 .apartments 1 to 10 .app 1 to 10 .archi 1 to 10 .army 1 to 10 .art 1 to 10 .associates 1 to 10 .attorney 1 to 10 .au (Register or connect only.
