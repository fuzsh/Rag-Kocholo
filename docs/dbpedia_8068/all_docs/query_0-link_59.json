        "text": "Domain names are more or less internet addresses for the 1.8 billion websites out there on the web.\n\nWith over 367 million domains registered, some stand out as top-level domains (TLDs).\n\nThese TLDs are highly sought after because they indicate a site's purpose, business, or location.\n\nAbout 58% of websites use one of the top five TLDs, which can make a site seem more credible and authentic.\n\nFor instance, a .com domain often makes customers view a website as legitimate.\n\nThis article explores the most popular TLDs, the total number of TLDs available, and much more.\n\nTLDs (Top-Level Domains) organize the internet's domain name system by categorizing websites based on their purpose, owner, or geographical location.\n\nWhen a computer loads a website, it starts with the top-level domain (TLD) to find the right data.\n\nAll the information for all general TLDs or gTLDs is located in 13 root name servers.\n\nSo, for example, the root name server for .org will contain all information about .org websites, but not for .com and vice versa.\n\nICANN, a nonprofit group, oversees top-level domains by coordinating their global distribution to other organizations.\n\nThe most common and easiest way to register a domain name is through a domain registrar, which requires selecting one that aligns with your needs based on pricing and features.\n\nUsually you can find available TLDs and their registration costs on a domain registrar's website.\n\nBut to have a website, you'll also need web hosting. To get both at the same place, choose an appropriate provider that offers both services.\n\nVerpex, for instance, includes a free domain name in all hosting plans, plus free privacy protection and 24/7 support.\n\nAlthough you can definitely find a TLD with an affordable price tag, there have been instances when people have paid enormous amounts of money to get a particular domain name.\n\nFor example, the most expensive domain name in 2023 was AI.com, which was sold for $11 million.\n\nHowever, the most expensive domain name overall is CarInsurance.com, which was sold for over $49 million in 2010.\n\nTop-level domains (TLDs) are crucial online, serving as a business's digital address.\n\nThey shape how customers see your business, with the more popular extensions boosting credibility.\n\nTop-level domains (TLDs) can include numbers, but they must also have letters; purely numerical extensions aren't allowed.\n\nAnd yes, getting the .com extension may seem like the best option right now, but even if you don't manage to get this one, you have over 1500 other TLDs to choose from!"
