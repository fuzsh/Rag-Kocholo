There are hundreds of local businesses wondering the same thing.\n\nIt’s about location, location, location, right?\n\nThat’s why we came up with this handy post on the pros and cons of using a country code top level domain or a ccTLD.\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn if you should use a ccTLD for your website and some popular examples.\n\nGet ready to get country.\n\nAbout Country Code Top Level Domains\n\nMost people are familiar with websites that have top level domains like .com, .net and .org. For instance, nameboy.com.\n\nOn the other hand, A country code top level domain (ccTLD) is a domain name extension used for geographic locations.\n\nThere are well over 200 country code TLDs available today.\n\nHere’s the difference between a TLD and a ccTLD. Each country has a two-letter code. The ccTLDs are the shortest domain extensions with only two characters, and generic TLDs have three.\n\nFor example, the United State’s code is US and the country code domain is .us.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of a ccTLD:\n\nA country code top level domain may be a good fit for businesses trying to build brand awareness in a specific location.\n\nLet’s take a look at the pros of ccTLDs first.\n\nPros to ccTLDs\n\nWe’re going to start out with a few pros of choosing a country code top level domain for your website.\n\nDomain Availability\n\nAvailability is a pretty important factor when you choose a domain name.\n\nWe recommend your first choice always be a .com. If that’s taken, a ccTLD might be easier to find.\n\nHowever, you should probably avoid this if there’s a well-known .com that already exists, because it could cause confusion.\n\nOverall, there’s a better chance of finding a domain name if you choose a ccTLD, but it might be in competition with a similar website.\n\nFor example, if you bought coffeeshop.us because coffeeshop.com was taken, people might just visit the .com and miss your website altogether.\n\nIf you’re not sure about availability, you can search for it in a domain name generator for some help with suggestions.\n\nConnection\n\nBy connection, we mean the association that your domain has with your location. And more specifically, to the people in that location visiting your website.\n\nYou may not know this, but there are descriptive domain extensions that help the visitor know it’s a specific type of website.\n\nFor example, the .md domain extension helps visitors know it’s a medical doctor or a healthcare website.\n\nCountry code top level domains are the same way, in that it tells visitors that the site is local.\n\nYour domain name could be a connection between the community and your local business.\n\nLocal Search\n\nTypically, when you search locally, you type in your area or use the term “near me”. That helps search engines know where you’d like to see search results.\n\nFor example, if you were looking for dentists in Hong Kong, China, you may type this in the search engine:\n\nHaving a country code top level domain helps the search engines and the users find your location.\n\nIf this dentist, located in China, had a .cn domain name extension, the local results may recognize this in the search.\n\nStill not sure if a ccTLD is the right choice for you? Let’s take a look at some of the downsides next.\n\nCons to ccTLDs\n\nCountry code top level domains aren’t for everyone. Let’s take a look at some cons to ccTLDs.\n\nSearch Engine Optimization\n\nYou might think that if you’re based in the UK, it’d make sense to use a domain ending in .co.uk.\n\nBut did you know that your domain ending sends a signal to Google about the audience you’re targeting?\n\nThe search engines assume that content on a .us domain targets people in the United States. Which is great for sites that are actually targeting those countries but can pose a problem if they aren’t.\n\nIf you’re based in one location, but your target audience is worldwide, you’ll want to avoid using a country-specific domain.\n\nThat said, there are a few exceptions to the rule!\n\nFor example, Google treats some country code domains such as .co or .me, as generic rather than targeted to their related countries. But you’ll want to double-check your keywords before committing to a ccTLD.\n\nCost\n\nWhen it comes to the cost, it’s a bit unpredictable. Their pricing is considered “unregulated”, meaning it’s determined by the country that offers the domain name.\n\nThis style pricing means that the initial cost of a ccTLD could be more than some top level domains.\n\nThis also means that the price can change from year to year. The cost to renew the domain name might be a bit higher in the future, as well.\n\nMore on domain pricing can be found at the best places to find a domain name for sale.\n\nUnique Rules\n\nThere are some unique rules when it comes to country code top level domains.\n\nccTLDs are controlled by each country’s government. They set their own guidelines for who can register and use their domains.\n\nThis includes things like identity verification or rules related to censorship and freedom of speech.\n\nThese rules can change at any moment. And, even though these changes are rare, it’s best to know the ccTLD basics.\n\nccTLD Examples\n\nNow that we know a little more about ccTLDs, let’s talk about some examples.\n\nZoom.us\n\nProbably the most popular ccTLD you may know of is Zoom. Their website is zoom.us and it’s trusted by a lot of people. Over 468,000 people to be exact.\n\nTheir ccTLD is .us, because they are a United States-based company. However, they also purchased zoom.com, because it is the most widely used generic TLD.\n\nGov.cn\n\nA popular website in China is Gov.cn. It’s a Chinese-run media website with the ccTLD domain .cn which is currently the most used country code top level domain.\n\nWeb.de\n\nWeb.de is another example of a ccTLD. It’s a popular German-based website for technology resources.\n\nThe .de domain extension is the second most popular ccTLD.\n\nNHS.uk\n\nThe last example of a popular ccTLD is nhs.uk, a health-related website located in the United Kingdom.\n\nAnd here are the most popular ccTLDs currently:\n\nIn comparison, here are the most popular top-level domains worldwide:\n\nSo, in learning all of this about country code top level domains, have you decided if it’s for you?\n\nShould You Use a ccTLD?\n\nIt’s decision time!
