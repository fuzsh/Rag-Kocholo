        "text": "The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority‚Äôs (IANA‚Äôs) official list of domain extensions has around 2,000 options as of the time of this writing.\n\nThe sheer size of this list can make the prospect of choosing a domain extension overwhelming, but the choice becomes easier when you understand what these extensions actually mean.\n\nüëâ So, in this guide, we‚Äôll explain everything you need to know about domain extensions:\n\nWhat they are\n\nWhat they mean for your website\n\nTypes and list of domain extensions\n\nThe three most common domain extensions\n\nLet‚Äôs get started!\n\nWhat are domain extensions?\n\nDomain extensions, or top-level domains (TLDs), are the suffixes that follow the last dot in a website‚Äôs domain name. Examples include .com, .org, or .net. These TLDs serve as online identifiers, classifying websites according to their organization type, location, and purpose.\n\nHistory of domain extensions\n\nThe history of domain extensions can be traced as far back as the 1980s, when the IANA kicked off with six domain extensions. Each of them represented a different type of organization.\n\nThere was:\n\n.com, which stands for ‚Äúcommercial‚Äù\n\n.org, which stands for ‚Äúorganization‚Äù\n\n.gov, which stands for ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù\n\n.mil, which stands for ‚Äúmilitary‚Äù\n\n.edu, which stands for ‚Äúeducation‚Äù\n\nThey were soon joined by country code TLDs, which started rolling out in the 1990s. Their role was to represent different countries and territories using determiners like:\n\n.jp for ‚ÄúJapan‚Äù\n\n.de for ‚ÄúGermany‚Äù\n\n.uk for the ‚ÄúUnited Kingdom‚Äù\n\n.us for the ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù\n\nThen in the early 2000s, the list of domain extensions expanded further to provide options for other types of industries, interests, and communities:\n\n.info, which represents ‚Äúinformation‚Äù\n\n.pro, which stands for ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù\n\n.biz, which is short for ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù\n\nBut, it was not until 2012 that ICANN made drastic changes to its domain extension registry, allowing anyone with a large enough budget to create custom top-level domains [1]. That was the beginning of the rise of branded TLDs like .bmw, .google, .sky, etc.\n\nWhat do domain extensions mean for your website?\n\nPurpose üéØ\n\nInitially, the aim of domain extensions was to categorize websites based on their type or purpose.\n\nFor instance, websites ending in .com were meant to be commercial, while .org was typically chosen by nonprofit organizations to distinguish themselves from educational or governmental entities.\n\n.co and .biz, on the other hand, have gained recognition as appropriate domain extensions for online business sites, whereas .info is often adopted by informational sites like research platforms.\n\nLocation üìç\n\nCode top-level domains (ccTLDs) ‚Äì like ‚Äú.us‚Äù for the United States and ‚Äú.uk‚Äù for the United Kingdom exist to associate brands with a specific country or region.\n\nBranding üçé\n\nThe choice of domain extension can influence your brand identity, brand recall, localization, and brand protection.\n\nFor example, when it comes to reinforcing brand recall, you want to choose a memorable domain extension that helps your brand stand out above its competitors.\n\nA .com extension meets this need, because it happens to be the most memorable domain extension. Consumers give it a memorability score of 44% [2]. Another great performer is .co, which ranks second with a score of 33%.\n\nTypes and list of domain extensions\n\nOn IANA‚Äôs database, you‚Äôll find all the domain extensions classified into three primary types:\n\nCountry-code top-level domain (ccTLD)\n\nSponsored top-level domains (sTLDs)\n\nGeneric top-level domains (gTLDs)\n\nHere are their details‚Ä¶ üïµÔ∏è\n\n#1. Country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs)\n\nCountry-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) are designed to cater to specific countries, sovereign states, and territories. They usually come in two initials drawn from the Latin alphabet.\n\nYou won‚Äôt be able to register random ccTLD extensions, though. Many of them have geographical restrictions that require you to be a resident of the host country, territory, or sovereign state.\n\nThese domain extensions are typically controlled from within the host country by government agencies or non-profit organizations.\n\nHere‚Äôs a quick list of domain extensions for specific countries:\n\n.za ‚Äì South Africa\n\n.us ‚Äì United States\n\n.uk ‚Äì United Kingdom\n\n.sa ‚Äì Saudi Arabia\n\n#2. Sponsored top-level domains (sTLDs)\n\nThese domain extensions are associated with a specific community or group, which is represented by a sponsor. You‚Äôll notice that they‚Äôre not available for public use like their generic top-level domains (gTLDs) counterparts. Instead, sTLDs are restricted to specific niches or industries.\n\nTake, for instance, sponsored top-level domains like .gov and .edu. The former is strictly reserved for government bodies in the US, whereas the latter is exclusively meant for educational institutions.\n\nOther examples of sTLD domain extensions include:\n\n.int ‚Äì sponsored by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for international organizations\n\n.gov ‚Äì sponsored by the General Services Administration (GSA) for U.S. government agencies\n\n.edu ‚Äì sponsored by EduCause for accredited degree-granting institutions\n\n#3. Generic top-level domains (gTLDs)\n\nGeneric top-level domains, commonly known as gTLDs, are versatile domain extensions that are not limited by regional affiliations or country codes. Unlike country-specific domains, they do not require a representative and can be possessed by anyone, regardless of location or background.\n\nThere are two types of gTLDs:\n\nRestricted ‚Äì These domain extensions are reserved for accredited businesses, professionals, or individuals with special qualifications. Examples of restricted gTLDs include .biz, .name, and .pro.\n\nUnrestricted ‚Äì Unrestricted gTLDs are open for registration by anyone, without any restrictions on acquisition. Some of the most popular unrestricted gTLDs include .com, .net, .org, and .info.\n\nThree most common domain extensions\n\nOut of the roughly 2,000 domain extensions in IANA‚Äôs database, the most popular ones (excluding country-code TLDs) are:\n\n.com\n\n.org\n\n.net\n\n.com\n\nThe .com domain is the most widely recognized and commonly used option for websites, making it the default choice for many individuals, businesses, and organizations.\n\nIt was originally intended for commercial entities. However, over time it has grown to become the primary top-level domain option across the board, and by a wide margin. As of the time of this writing, it has a market share of about 52.8% of all the registered domains globally, [3] and the gap between .com and the second most popular domain extension, .org, is staggering.\n\nThis dominance, however, means you might struggle to find an appropriate domain name using this extension. Find out more by reading our in-depth guide to the .com domain extension.\n\n.org\n\nThe .org gTLD, which holds a market share of 4.4%, is the second most popular domain extension.\n\n.org here stands for ‚Äúorganization‚Äù, as the extension was originally meant for non-profit organizations. However, this requirement was only enforced temporarily, after which it was indefinitely suspended by ICANN.\n\nThe generic top-level domain is now open for use by all types of entities.\n\n.net\n\n.net is the other option that you might be looking into ‚Äì as it‚Äôs the fourth most popular domain extension, with a market share of 3.1%.\n\nIt has its origins in the term ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù, and that‚Äôs because the domain extension was initially designated for organizations in the networking technologies space.\n\nThe restrictions on its usage were never strictly enforced, though. And so, over time, .net evolved into a ‚Äúgeneral purpose namespace‚Äù, which now serves as a viable alternative to .com domains.\n\nFinding the best domain extension for your site\n\nYou can, of course, dig through IANA‚Äôs list of domain extensions for ideas."
