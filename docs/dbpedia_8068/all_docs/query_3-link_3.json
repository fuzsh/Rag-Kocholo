        "text": "Overview\n\nMost U.S. government websites end in .gov or .mil, but some end in .com, .org, .net, or other top-level domains. To enhance discoverability and public trust, we maintain a list of known government domains that don’t end in .gov or .mil. Federal executive branch agencies must ensure their non-.gov or .mil domains are on the list. Read more in the Federal Zero Trust Strategy and Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services.\n\nThe list is used by several U.S. government services, including USA.gov to support their all-of-government search, and the .gov Registry to support an inventory of government domains.\n\nAnyone can submit a domain to the list.\n\nWhat domains are in scope of this list?\n\nAll non-.gov and non-.mil domain names registered by your agency, or by a contractor on behalf of your agency, must be included in this list. This includes domains that are not even used on the internet but are merely registered.\n\nDomain Description Example Registered to facilitate redirects agency.com which may redirect to agency.gov Serve some infrastructure purpose,\n\neven if not public-facing agencyapi.com\n\nagency-dashboard.net Registered by a contractor on behalf of the agency agencycampaignsite.us Registered long ago and is not expired legacyagency.org Registered to prevent others from obtaining it\n\n(sometimes called “defensive registrations”, which includes “typo” domains) ouragency.com\n\n0uragency.com\n\nhouragency.com\n\nDo not add individual subdomains or hostnames within a domain that’s already on the list. For example, report agency.com, but do not also report saas.agency.com.\n\nReport a “subdomain” if (1) your agency has a domain registered on a country-code top-level domain (or other “public suffix”) or (2) your agency publishes federal information on nongovernmental domains that you do not operate.\n\nDomain Description Example Registered on a country-code top level domain us-agency.org.uk Subdomains publishing federal information exampleagency.university.edu\n\nDomains registered by grantees\n\nGenerally, report a domain if it is registered pursuant to the terms of a grant and used for federal purposes, but do not report domains registered by grantees which your agency does not oversee or technologically support.\n\nWhat domains are out of scope of this list?\n\nThis list excludes the domains of third-party online services where the agency is merely a user or a customer, not the domain’s registrant.\n\nDomain Description Example Software-as-a-service sites agency-my.sharepoint.com\n\nagency-service.slack.com Cloud-managed resources s3.amazonaws.com Social media sites twitter.com\n\nlinkedin.com Code repositories github.com/agency\n\nGather domain names. Domains are sometimes confused for “websites”, so consider asking for a “list of websites/domain registrations we manage” from the following types of roles:\n\nExternal affairs, web publishing, or press team.\n\nDNS managers, network/security operations.\n\nBudget or accounting teams who might process domain registration payments to registrars like GoDaddy, Network Solutions, Namecheap, etc.\n\nIf you have questions about whether a certain domain should be included, open an issue in Github or email us.\n\nSend your updates. We will review all submissions before including them on the list.\n\nFor multiple additions or any changes:\n\nOpen an issue in GitHub. No technical knowledge or code is required, but a GitHub account is. You can also open pull requests.\n\nSubmit bulk changes via email using our template (.csv format).\n\nFor single additions, use this form:\n\nWhat’s Included in the List?\n\nFederal, state, local, tribal, commonwealth, and territorial government agency websites.\n\nFederal reserve banks and branches.\n\nFederal home loan banks.\n\nLibraries, archives, and museums, including Presidential libraries.\n\nDepartment of Defense websites for recruiting and service academies.\n\nTravel and tourism websites for states and U.S. territories.\n\nState lotteries.\n\nCooperative extensions.\n\nCombined federal campaigns.\n\nGovernment sponsored enterprises (such as Fannie Mae).\n\nFederal and state retirement systems.\n\nTask forces (such as the Preventive Services Task Force) and commissions (such as the 9/11 Commission).\n\nA few select, non-government organizations (such as the Red Cross) and public-private partnerships.\n\nWhat’s Not Included in This List?"
