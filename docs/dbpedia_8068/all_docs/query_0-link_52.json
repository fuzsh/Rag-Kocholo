        "text": "Appendix D: Internet Addresses and Domains\n\nEveryone who has watched television, listened to the radio, or surfed the web in the last half-dozen years is familiar with Internet addresses or, more precisely, Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). In fact, these addresses have become so commonplace that many companies now include them, often in place of telephone numbers, as the primary contact information in their advertisements.\n\nAn Internet address is actually the verbal translation, or domain name, of a numeric Internet Protocol (IP) address, which represents a unique computer location on the Internet. For example, when the domain name nces.ed.gov is keyed into a web browser, the browser asks a server for the actual IP address (in this case, 165.224.221.98), which tells the browser how to get to the site. Users generally are not even aware that these numbers exist and, for almost all operations, use the shorthand Internet address rather than the numeric IP address.\n\nAn Internet address is broken into several different segments separated by periods. The address segments are read in backwards order to determine the location of the server. The first component of an Internet address is the top-level domain (TLD), which identifies the nature of the address owner's business. The TLD most people are familiar with is .com (\"dot com\"), short for commercial. In addition to .com, there are several other generic TLDs, including .org, .edu, and .net, as well as country-specific TLDs such as .us and .uk. The rules for using a particular TLD vary; for example, virtually anyone can get a .com address, but, for the most part, .edu addresses are available only to institutions of higher education.\n\nThe following table identifies a few of the TLDs that are currently available. New domains are being added constantly.\n\nTop-Level Domains\n\nRestrictions .com None - Anyone can register. Originally restricted to for-profit companies. .net None - Anyone can register. Originally for network infrastructure Companies only. .org None - Anyone can register. Originally for nonprofits only. .edu Limited to institutions of higher education (except for grand-fathered institutions). .gov United States federal and state governments only. .jp Japan's country code. Limited to organizations, institutions, and individuals in Japan. .name None - Available to anyone who wants to register a name domain (e.g., john_smith). .mil United States military only. .kids For noncommercial children's content. Not yet available. .biz None - Anyone can register. .info None - Anyone can register. .us None - Anyone can register. The .us domain is the United States country code. Originally limited to a geographic system of naming ( www.name.state.us ), but being reformed. .tv Tuvalu's country code (an island nation in the South Pacific). No restrictions. Widely used for television-related industry.\n\nThe second-level domain (SLD) is the portion of the URL that identifies the owner of the IP address. The rules for SLDs are even less regulated than those for TLDs. Some TLDs, such as .com, have no restrictions at the second level, so virtually anything can be registered. Others have significant SLD restrictions, such as .us, which requires state identifiers at the second level.\n\nStarting from the TLD and working backwards, the Internet address provides information about the address owner. Using the example nces.ed.gov, it can be determined that the address owner (TLD) is\n\n.gov, meaning it is affiliated with the U.S. government;\n\n.ed.gov, meaning it is part of the U.S. Department of Education (SLD); and\n\nnces.ed.gov, the National Center for Education Statistics at the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nSimilar rules apply as more and more domains are added to an address. The drawback to increasing the levels of information within an Internet address is that the address can become unwieldy. The more levels in the address, the more difficult it is to remember. School districts have been traditionally sequestered in the .us domain, and they consequently often have web addresses that can be hard to recall from memory.\n\nWhen choosing a domain name, one should exercise judgment in determining whether a short and simple or longer and more descriptive name is appropriate, and then check to see if it is available for use. Companies that sell domain names for profit quickly snatch up simple domain names. To check the availability of a domain name or to register a name, one should go to any online domain registrar, such as www.register.com or www.networksolutions.com. The cost of registering and maintaining a domain name is approximately $35 per year."
