Country code top-level domain definition

A country code top-level domain (ccTLD) is the top-level domain reserved for a geographical area identified with a country code (generally a country, sovereign state, or a dependent territory). ccTLDs identifiers are usually composed of two letters â the areaâs ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, also known simply as the country code.

Open vs restricted ccTLDs

ccTLDs are often restricted to entities that have a substantial link to the geographical area, like citizenship or a physical presence. Some ccTLDs, however, have no such requirements, being open to anyone for registration. Open ccTLDs are typically used for branding opportunities â for example, when the country code happens to be a popular acronym (like âTVâ or âCCâ).
