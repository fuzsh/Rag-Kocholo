        "meta_description": "British autograph card by the Rank Organisation. Sent by mail in 1959.\n\t\n\tDark and mysterious British actress <b>Barbara Steele</b> (1937) is nicknamed 'The Queen of All Scream Queens'. She was the star of one of the masterpieces of the Italian horror cinema, Mario Bava's <i>La maschera del demonio/Black Sunday</i> (1960), about witchcraft.\n\t\n\tBarbara Steele was born in 1937 in Birkenhead, Cheshire, England. She studied to become a painter at the Chelsea Art School and in Paris at the Sorbonne. In 1957, she joined an acting repertory company. She was reportedly the last person to be signed as a contract player by the J. Arthur Rank Organization. Her feature acting debut was in the British comedy Bachelor of Hearts (Wolf Rilla, 1958) starring Hardy Krüger. At age 21, strikingly lovely Barbara Steele, with the hauntingly beautiful face, large eyes, sensuous lips, and long dark hair got her breakout role as the evil yet sexy witch Princess Asa Vajda opposite John Richardson in the Italian Gothic horror film La maschera del demonio/Black Sunday (Mario Bava, 1960). It was the directorial debut for cinematographer Mario Bava, and it was exquisitely atmospheric photographed. After its American success, she was cast as the original female lead to Elvis Presley in Flaming Star (1960). She walked off the picture after an argument with director Don Siegel and was replaced by Barbara Eden. She did star in Roger Corman's The Pit and the Pendulum (1961) opposite Vincent Price. In 1962, she answered an open casting call and won a role in Federico Fellini's 8½ (1963). She only had a small role, but it was memorable. Reportedly, Fellini wanted to use her more in the film, but she was contracted to leave Rome to start work on her next horror film, L'orribile segreto del Dr. Hichcock/The Terror of Dr. Hichcock (Riccardo Freda, 1962). More horror films followed, such as Lo spettro/The Ghost (Riccardo Freda, 1963), Danza macabra/Castle of Blood (Antonio Margheriti, 1964), and Un angelo per Satana/An Angel for Satan (Camillo Mastrocinque, 1966) with Anthony Steffen. This success lead to her being typecast in the horror genre, where she more often than not appeared in Italian films with a dubbed voice. The nadir was appearing in Curse of the Crimson Altar (Vernon Sewell, 1968), with Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee. It was mainly eye candy, with scantily-clad women in a cult. \n\t\n\tBack in America, Barbara Steele met screenwriter James Poe.  They married and remained together for many years. Poe wrote an excellent role for Barbara in They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (Sydney Pollack, 1969). The role ended up going to Susannah York, and Barbara wouldn't act in films again for five years. She returned to the cinema in Caged Heat (Jonathan Demme, 1974). She played the wheelchair-bound warden, and her performance won positive reviews. In 1977, she appeared in a film by Roger Corman, based on the true story of a mentally ill woman, I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (Anthony Page, 1977) with Bibi Andersson. Unfortunately, her scenes wound up on the cutting room floor. Barbara appeared in Pretty Baby (Louis Malle, 1978), but she was in the background the whole time, and her talent was wasted. She and James Poe got divorced in 1978. He died two years later. Steele also appeared in three horror films: David Cronenberg's Shivers/They Came From Within (1975), Piranha (Joe Dante, 1978), and The Silent Scream (Denny Harris, 1979). Then she retired from acting for a decade. She had success as a producer. She was an associate producer for the miniseries The Winds of War (Dan Curtis, 1983) starring Robert Mitchum, and produced War and Remembrance (Dan Curtis, 1988), for which she got an Emmy Award. Her horror fans were delighted when Barbara showed up again, this time on television in Dark Shadows (Dan Curtis, 1991), a revival of the beloved 1960s supernatural soap opera. And she has developed a relative fondness along with a sense of ironic humor about her horror queen status, which was evident in her appearance in Clive Barker's documentary A-Z of Horror (1997). Steele appeared in several films in the 2010s, including a lead role in the horror film The Butterfly Room (Jonathan Zarantonello, 2012) and a supporting role in Ryan Gosling's Lost River (2014). Barbara Steele has a son with James Poe, Jonathan Jackson Poe (1970).\n\t\n\tSources: KD Haisch (IMDb), Wikipedia, and IMDb.\n\t\n\t<b>And, please check out our blog <a href=\"http://filmstarpostcards.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">European Film Star Postcards</a>.</b>",
