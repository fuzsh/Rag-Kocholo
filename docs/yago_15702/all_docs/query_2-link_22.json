        "text": "Barbara Lee Steele Ferguson, our beloved Nana, went home to be with her Lord on January 11, 2024, surrounded by her loving family. Born in Dalhart, TX, on April 28, 1931, to Herman and Erma Steele, she embarked on a life journey that has touched countless friends and inspired her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren for a lifetime.\n\nBarbara grew up as an only child and often spoke of how Jesus became her friend and companion at a very early age. She enjoyed the attention of her extended family, especially fishing trips to New Mexico and Colorado and visits to aunts, uncles, and cousins living there. She developed a deep love for the outdoors, nature, and especially the mountains. After graduation from Dalhart High School, Barbara attended Colorado Women’s College and was a graduate of the University of Texas in Austin.\n\nBarbara married the love of her life, Robert Chappell Ferguson, Jr., in 1953, beginning a partnership that lasted 6 decades. They dearly loved Dalhart and contributed time and resources to many organizations, including the LaRita Theatre, the XIT Museum, Coon Memorial Auxiliary, and Central Methodist Church. Exhibiting her exuberant flair for the dramatic, Barbara performed as the beautiful heroine opposite the dastardly villain in many an XIT melodrama.\n\nFrom her earliest years of service teaching Sunday school, singing in the choir, leading women’s groups, and actively participating in many committee leadership roles to her later years as a friend and spiritual mentor communicating her faith through cards, letters, and emails, Barbara lived her life on mission. She could rise early every morning, sipping her favorite cup of coffee, with her Bible and study materials stacked around her. She knew precisely where her strength was found and never missed an opportunity to share favorite scriptures or uplifting stories and quotes to encourage others.\n\nAbove all, Barbara was devoted to her beloved husband of 63 years, Bob. B&B were both lifelong learners who deeply valued personal study, music, history, and travel and instilled in their children and grandchildren a love of learning. Lively discussions around the dining room table were a common occurrence in their home, and they always had a rich collection of inspirational insights to share.\n\nEvidence of their zest for life, B&B moved to Granbury, TX, in 2008, where they began a new adventure of lake life, joined Lakeside Baptist Church, enjoyed theater, boating, and dinner clubs, and formed countless new friendships. Barbara loved being near the water, birdwatching, gardening, and entertaining. She could also play a mean game of bridge! The couple returned to the Texas Panhandle in 2012, where they made many new friends together at Park Place Towers in Amarillo, TX. Our Nana exuded an indomitable spirit of perseverance and grace. Even amid physical pain and limitations, Mom chose joy. She often quipped, “You’ve just got to call on old Percy,”…her name for perseverance. She will be best remembered for her radiant smile, her undaunting faith, her quick wit, and her unwavering commitment to her Lord and her family.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband, Bob, in 2016.\n\nShe is survived by her children: Beth and Ike Carter of Dalhart; Susan and David Hurt of Ransom Canyon; and Lee and Jamye Ferguson of Marshall, Texas. Her eight grandchildren are Cy and Genevieve Carter of Smithtown, NY; Matt and Kathryn Carter of Aledo, Texas; Ben and Liz Carter of Midland, Texas; Eric and KJ Hurt of Prosper, Texas; Andrew and Rachel Hurt of Plainview, Texas; Daniel and Halee Ferguson of Lewisville, Texas; Abigail and Joshua Drake of Grand Prairie, Texas; and Sarah and Blake Rasbury of Crandall, Texas. She was blessed with 12 great-grandchildren: Chappell, Price, Sterling, Mary, Adair, and Ellis Carter; James, Ballard, Camden, Schuyler, and Haddie Hurt; Phoebe Ferguson and Everlee Drake, arriving May 2024.\n\n“She fought the good fight; she finished the race!” Her enduring spirit of faith and service lives on in the hearts of her children and grandchildren, who gathered around her to cheer her on to her heavenly home.\n\nShe is with God, and since He is with us, she cannot be far away.\n\nThe family suggests memorials be sent to the XIT Museum (XITmuseum.org) at 108 East 5th Street, 79022, or to a charity of your choice."
