        "text": "HE SAID\n\n“Sometimes I feel I’d like to do stand-up material again. But you’ve got to stand up there for an hour. I mean, it’s different to stand up for five minutes.” – Woody Allen at 88.\n\n“As Cesar [Adam Driver’s character in Megalopolis] says, we’re all one family. You’re all my cousins. We are one. We are the human family. As you see at the end, that’s who we should pledge our allegiance to: our entire family and to this beautiful home, Earth, that we have. That’s my wish. That it’s the children who are going to inherit this beautiful world from us. The most important word we have is the most beautiful word in any language: esperanza. Hope .” – Francis Ford Coppola.\n\n“There’s never been a more beautiful man on-screen,” – Chris Hemsworth on Brad Pitt.\n\n“When we grew up – Muhammad Ali and JFK and Sean Connery. Those were men. We wanted to be like them. They were all witty and handsome and had broad shoulders. Hugh Grant has the shoulders. He has the wit. He likes to drink. He knows how to have fun. He knows how to put people at ease.” – Jerry Seinfeld on Hugh Grant.\n\n“‘If I play it in a concert hall now, just like if you play the Herrmann Psycho motif, they laugh. It’s become camp. Which is fine! But it frightened people at the time.” – John Williams on his boom-boom-boom Jaws score, among his record 54 Oscar nominations!\n\n“John has been my primary creative partner across my entire film career. And that’s not gonna end until we do.” – Steven Spielberg on John Williams.\n\n“As any artist or any actor or painter, you are always hypercritical of your own work. If you’re not, and you’re satisfied with what you’re doing, that would be death to me. If I watched a performance… and thought, ‘My God, I’m fantastic in this,’ that would be a sad day.” – Gary Oldman on why he calls his Sirius Black in Harry Potter mediocre.\n\n“With my apologies to all the other people I’ve met, he’s my favorite human… Because his charm and funniness is what I dreamed of when I was a kid in the 60s. I wanted to be a charming, witty man. That never happened.” – Jerry Seinfeld, still on Hugh Grant.\n\nCCC CLIPS\n\n>> Recent Oscar-winner Robert Downey Jr is after four next time… He’s playing “all the white guys” in Korean director Park Chan-wook’s The Sympathiser – a US politician, a CIAgent, a college professor and a film-maker.\n\n>> Spielberg and Scorsese - sounds like a law firm – are producing a heavy series based on their 1999 thriller-teaming, Cape Fear… Pierce Brosnan enters werewolf country in Wolfland, second film directed by his son, Sean…\n\n>> Code-named Tiva, the NCIS spin-off about Tony and Ziva – Pablo De Conte and Michel Weatherly - is no longer NCIS: Europe or NCIS: Trust No One but NCIS: Tony and Ziv. How come that took so long…\n\n>> Evangeline Lily – the Lost Kate, Ant Man’s Wasp, Tauriel in three Hobbits and damn nearly Wonder Woman – has retired. Or, “stepped away from Hollywood”… Film-making twins Mark and Michael Polish finally working again, writer-helming half each of There There – dozenth film of Mark’s daughter Logan – Lolo to her mates…\n\n>> Yesssss, Precious! Andy Serkis is returning to Middle Earth to direct and, naturally, star in The Hunt for Gollum. - And staying in Peter Jackson country to be Captain Haddock in Tintin 2 and 3.\n\n>> Bio-picks Jennifer Lawrence will be Ava Gardner (!) in Sinatra…Harry Lawtey (Industry’s Robert) is young Richard Burton when Toby Jones as his mentor, Mr Burton - also with the Welsh Aimee-Ffion Edwards, who has cleverly double whammied Peaky Blinders and Slow Horses."
