        "text": "Roger William Corman\n\n(April 5, 1926 – May 9, 2024)\n\nThe great producer/director/cultural icon Roger Corman has passed away at 98. It might take us months to fully comprehend what a big deal that is.\n\nAs for me, I can remember exactly when Mr. Corman became part (a big fat part) of my Movie Life.\n\nEvery summer growing up, we’d head to Strawn, Texas, and stay a few weeks with my grandparents. Being a movie-collecting family, and this being the pre-home video 1970s, we would pack a 16mm projector and a stack of prints for the trip. One particular summer, when I was 10 or 11, one of the films that made the trek (in a Chevrolet station wagon) was Roger Corman’s Pit And The Pendulum (1961). (Budd Boetticher’s Buchanan Rides Alone was there, too.)\n\nStrawn is a tiny town of about 850 people — a couple hours West of Dallas. My grandfather, AG “Flint” McCullough, was a real cowboy — he trained cutting horses. My grandmother, Zelma McCullough, worked in Strawn’s lone grocery store. They were wonderful people.\n\nSummers in Strawn get really, really hot. And sitting under the window-unit air conditioner at my grandparents’ house, watching Pit And The Pendulum projected onto the bright white living room wall, was a nice way to beat the heat.\n\nI ran that print of Pit And The Pendulum several times over those three weeks — on one of those green Bell & Howell projectors some of us remember from high school. I can still hear its clicky purr mixed with the hum of the A/C. Can recall the brownish color of the slightly-faded ‘Scope print. (No telling what it looks like now.) And can still recite a lot of its dialogue.\n\nWatching that film so many times, I started to get a sense of how movies work. The power of cutting to a closeup. How the lack of light can be more impactful than the presence of it. Just what music can do. How widescreen (Panavision, in this case) can be used to startling effect. And on and on.\n\nThis sent me digging for any Corman movie I could find, which in those days meant learning his filmography and scouring the TV Guide, hoping to happen upon something. I read Ed Naha’s book on Corman over and over.\n\nRoger Corman not only taught me about movies, he taught me to love them. I really owe him an awful lot.\n\nBarbara Steele\n\n(Born December 29, 1937)\n\nAt 10 years old, Roger Corman’s Pit And The Pendulum (1961) just blew me away. With its innovative use of color and ‘Scope (shot by Floyd Crosby), it’s one of the first times I remember getting as wrapped up in a movie’s technique as I was in the story.\n\nIt was also the first time I encountered Barbara Steele, who somehow managed to be both lovely and creepy in the same shot. Miss Steele seems to gave been born to appear in Gothic horror films, and she’s in some of the best — Pit And The Pendulum, Black Sunday (1960), Castle Of Blood (1964), etc.\n\nHere’s wishing her a happy 86th birthday.\n\nAlways wondered what happened to the portrait Vincent Price “paints” of her in Pit And The Pendulum. (“She was that substance of loveliness… I tried to capture it, but it was the way she walked and moved – her smile, her voice.”) Wouldn’t you love to have that above your mantel?\n\nFilm Masters continues their Filmgroup releases with a stunning Blu-Ray of The Terror — with The Little Shop Of Horrors along for the high-definition ride. Both get a Cadillac 4K scan from nice 35mm material.\n\nThe Terror (1963)\n\nProduced & Directed by Roger Corman (& Francis Ford Coppola, Monte Hellman, Jack Hill)\n\nStarring Boris Karloff, Jack Nicholson, Sandra Knight, Dick Miller, Dorothy Neumann, Jonathan Haze\n\nRoger Corman’s The Terror is a patchwork quilt of a Gothic horror movie, done in bits and pieces — beginning with Boris Karloff walking around the sets for AIP’s The Raven as they were being torn down. A busload of writers and directors messed around with it for about a year. As you’d expect, the results don’t make a whole lot of sense (Leo Gordon’s original script was altered each time it was passed from one director to another), but there’s something oddly fascinating about the whole thing.\n\nJack Nicholson is a French officer who winds up at the castle of Baron von Leppe (Boris Karloff) after trying to locate a mysterious young woman he met on the beach (Sandra Knight). Things get convoluted and confusing from there, with a witch and her son, a deal with the devil, a ghost and a flooded crypt added to the mix. It was not based on a Poe story, but if someone thought it was part of Corman’s successful Poe Cycle, that was fine!\n\nI once had a fairly-decent 16mm dupe print of The Terror, and have tried out several of its previous video releases, so I’m very familiar with the movie and what it looks like. NEVER thought it would look at good as it does here. The color is vivid and consistent, and the picture is surprisingly sharp — with allowances for the crazy way it was shot. The framing is perfect (Vistascope is just the standard 1.85.) and the sound is crystal clear. Film Masters has done a terrific job with The Terror.\n\nThe Little Shop Of Horrors (1960)\n\nProduced & Directed by Roger Corman\n\nStarring Jonathan Haze, Jackie Joseph, Mel Welles, Dick Miller, Myrtle Vail, Jack Nicholson\n\nEverybody knows the backstory on The Little Shop Of Horrors — another Corman movie shot on leftover sets (this time, from Corman’s own A Bucket Of Blood). Interiors were shot in a couple days (after a few days of rehearsal) with a budget of just $28,000. To keep things moving quickly, multiple cameras and fixed lighting were used, sitcom style.\n\nSeymour Krelboined (Jonathan Haze) develops a man-eating plant he names Audrey, after a coworker he’s sweet on (Jackie Joseph). The plant becomes an attraction at the little flower shop where Seymour works, so his boss looks the other way when Seymour feeds it a bum who was hit by a train. Things escalate from there. Oh, and it’s all played for laughs. The picture is known for Jack Nicholson’s scene, but Mel Welles is terrific as Haze’s boss. (Of course, it spawned a musical play and a film based on that play.)\n\nThe Little Shop Of Horrors went out in a double feature with Mario Bava’s Black Sunday, then again with Corman’s Last Woman On Earth (both 1960). Then it became a staple on the late show and cheap VHS tapes. Again, Film Masters has come through with a small miracle — though it doesn’t glow quite like The Terror, this is the best I’ve ever seen The Little Shop Of Horrors look. It’s clean and sharp with nice, solid blacks. I saw things I’ve never noticed before, giving new life to a film I’ve seen a couple dozens times. And the proper framing makes a huge difference.\n\nFilm Masters has given us some nice extras, with the prize going to the second part of Ballyhoo’s documentary on Corman’s Filmgroup, his independent production company he operated while he was doing the Poe pictures for AIP. I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nI’ve written this a thousand times: an upgraded transfer can transform an old film. Film Masters proves that here, twice, showing that The Terror and The Little Shop Of Horrors weren’t as raggedy-looking as we once thought. I was blown away. This two-disc set comes highly, highly recommended.\n\nAs the major studios abandon their classic films on DVD, Blu-Ray and 4K, smaller, independent firms are coming along to take up some of the slack — loading up collectors’ shelves and showing the majors how to treat a film, ANY film, with respect. One of the companies to watch is Film Masters. They’re announcing titles at a rapid pace (“like the Russians are in Jersey,” to quote Gene Hackman in The French Connection), with the latest being an actual double feature from 1961, The Devil’s Partner and Creature From The Haunted Sea.\n\nThe Devil’s Partner\n\nDirected by Charles R. Rondeau\n\nStarring Ed Nelson, Edgar Buchanan, Jean Allison, Richard Crane, Byron Foulger\n\nThis tale of devil worship and demonic possession in a small town in New Mexico was produced in 1958. Gene and Roger Corman bought it release in a twin bill (from their company Filmgroup) with their own picture, Creature From The Haunted Sea. It’s a pretty solid little movie, with some terrific character actors like Edgar Buchanan and Byron Foulger.\n\nCreature From The Haunted Sea\n\nProduced & Directed by Roger Corman\n\nStarring Antony Carbone, Betsy Jones-Moreland, Edward Wain\n\nWritten by Charles Griffith in a week (so Corman could get some tax incentives while making a couple films in Puerto Rico) and shot in five days, Creature From The Haunted Sea is part crime picture, part monster movie — and a total hoot all the way through. A few years later, Corman had Monte Hellman shoot some additional scenes to pad it out for TV.\n\nFilm Masters is pulling out all the stops, again. You get both versions of Creature From The Haunted Sea (theatrical and TV), commentaries, an essay and a documentary from Ballyhoo on Filmgroup. Coming in January 2024.\n\nKnowing these films, and knowing what to expect from Film Masters, this comes highly recommended.\n\nA few days ago, over on 50 Westerns From The 50s, I posted a list of the Westerns released on DVD and Blu-Rays by Olive Films. Turns out a number of us are looking to fill some gaps in our collections — before they’re either gone or going for crazy collectors’ prices. And now, here’s a list of some of their other titles. This is by no means everything — just the stuff that falls within the scope of this blog.\n\nSome of these titles have already been re-issued (or are on the way) by other companies. But some may never see the light of day again, given the current state of physical media. From a couple of Republic serials to a handful of Regalscope pictures, there are some real jewels here.\n\nAs very special thanks (again) to Laura from Laura’s Miscellaneous Musings, who was a HUGE help with bringing this together.\n\nBetty Boop, Vols. 1-4\n\nSabotage (1939)\n\nS.O.S.

Olive Films put some terrific movies in our hot little hands. It’s a shame they didn’t make it. This proves the point that’s been made over and over on this blog — if we don’t support the companies that put these things out, they won’t be putting them out anymore. Okay, now I’ll climb down from my soapbox and put The Return Of Dracula back on."
