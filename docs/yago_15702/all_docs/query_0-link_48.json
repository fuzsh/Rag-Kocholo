Angelucci directed the film Miele di donna (A Woman’s Honey) in 1981 (with Fernando Rey, Catherine Spaak, Clio Goldsmith, and Luc Merenda) which competed at the Nice Film Festival. An author of novels, he has published L’Amore in corpo (Love in the Body) (1984) and Federico F (2000). As an essayist, he has published various works on cinema, including Amarcord, Casanova, E la nave va, Ginger and Fred, and A Director's Notebook. He has also authored the photo essays La Dolce Vita and Un regista a Cinecittà (A Director at Cinecittà). An author of film treatments, screenplays and television programs, he has created documentaries on cinema, including a TV movie on Fellini's Casanova (1967) and two documentaries dedicated to Fellini's work: Gli attori di Fellini (Fellini's Actors) and Fellini nel cestino (Fellini in the Trash Bin) (1984).

In 1993/94, at the behest of Fellini himself, Cinecitta International asked Angelucci to supervise the reissue of the director's entire opus (23 films). These were presented at the Lincoln Center in Autumn of 1993.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2000, Angelucci was appointed by Fellini’s family and the City of Rimini as Director of the Fondazione Federico Fellini. His duties included the organization of conferences, publications, film festivals, as well as the creation of a research center and archive in order to preserve the memory and promote the study and appreciation of this great director.\n\nPeter Bonadella\n\nPeter Bondanella is Distinguished Professor of Comparative Literature and Italian Studies at Indiana University.

Her 1990 release, An Angel at My Table, a study of the troubled life of New Zealand writer Janet Frame, solidified Campion’s reputation for directing forceful, unconventional female leads.\n\nIn 1992, The Piano, which centers on a strong willed mute woman chafing against an arranged marriage in colonial New Zealand, unleashed a flood of critical praise.

Steele’s first American feature, Roger Corman’s 1961 adaptation of Poe’s The Pit and the Pendulum, furthered Steele’s reputation as a mistress of horror.\n\nIn 1962, Steele responded to an open casting call and landed a small but significant part in Federico Fellini’s 8½. Steele continued acting in feature films throughout the next two decades, appearing in Jonathan Demme’s Caged Heat (1974), David Cronenberg’s They Came from Within (1975), and Louis Malle’s Pretty Baby (1978), among others.\n\nAfter Steele retired from the screen following the 1980 death of her ex-husband, screenwriter James Poe, she found success as a producer.
