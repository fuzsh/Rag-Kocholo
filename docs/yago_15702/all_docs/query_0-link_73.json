        "text": "Arrow Films\n\nFrom the Merchant of Menace, Vincent Price, and the King of the Bs, Roger Corman, come Six Gothic tales inspired by the pen of Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nIn The Fall of the House of Usher, a young man learns of a family curse that threatens his happiness with his bride-to-be. In The Pit and the Pendulum, a brother investigates the untimely death of sister, played by Barbara Steele. Tales of Terror adapts three Poe classics, Morella, The Black Cat and The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar, each starring a horror icon. The Raven is a comic take on the famous poem concerning three rival magicians. In The Haunted Palace, a newcomer in a New England town is suspected of being a warlock. And in The Tomb of Ligeia, filmed in Norfolk and at Stonehenge, a widower's upcoming marriage plans are thwarted by his dead first wife.\n\nThe six films boast a remarkable cast list: not just Price and Steele, but also Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, Lon Chaney Jr, Basil and a very young Jack Nicholson. Adapted for the screen by Richard Matheson and Robert Towne, these Six Gothic Tales now rank as classic examples of sixties horror cinema.\n\nSPECIAL EDITION CONTENTS:\n\nHigh Definition Blu-ray presentation of all six features\n\nOriginal uncompressed mono PCM Audio for all films\n\nOptional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for all films\n\nTrailers for each film\n\nReversible sleeves featuring original and newly commissioned artwork for all films\n\nTHE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER\n\nAudio commentary with director and producer Roger Corman\n\nAn interview with director Joe Dante\n\nInterview with author Jonathan Rigby\n\nVideo essay by critic and filmmaker David Cairns examining Corman s film in relation to Poe's story\n\nArchival interview with Vincent Price\n\nTHE PIT AND THE PENDULUM\n\nAudio commentary with director and producer Roger Corman\n\nAudio commentary by critic Tim Lucas\n\nA new making of documentary featuring Roger Corman, star Barbara Steele, Victoria Price and more!\n\nShot in 1968 to pad out the film for the longer TV time slot, this scene features star Luana Anders\n\nPrice reads a selection of Poe's classic stories before a live audience\n\nTALES OF TERROR\n\nAn hour-long documentary on Roger Corman featuring contributions from James Cameron, Martin Scorsese and Ron Howard\n\nCritic and novelist Anne Billson discusses the contributions of our feline friends to genre cinema\n\nThe Black Cat, a 1993 short film adaptation of Poe's classic tale directed by Rob Green (The Bunker)\n\nTHE RAVEN\n\nPeter Lorre: The Double Face, Harun Farocki s 1984 documentary, subtitled in English for the first time\n\nAn interview with the legendary novelist and screenwriter Richard Matheson\n\nAn interview with Roger Corman about making The Raven\n\nThe Trick, a short film about rival magicians by Rob Green (The Bunker)\n\nPromotional Record\n\nStills and Poster Gallery\n\nTHE HAUNTED PALACE\n\nAudio commentary by Vincent Price s biographer David Del Valle and Ron Chaney, grandson of Lon Chaney, Jr\n\nKim Newman on H.P.
