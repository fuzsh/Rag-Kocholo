Francis is told that his sister, although very much in love with Nicholas, had become increasingly depressed by the gloomy atmosphere of the castle and had spent most of her time in the dungeons built by Nicholas's father during the Inquisition. One night, after locking herself inside an iron box in the torture chamber, she died of fright. The explanation fails to satisfy Francis, and he decides to remain for a few days. Gradually it becomes apparent that Nicholas is obsessed with the thought that he may have buried his wife alive, a fate that befell his adulterous mother.

Although no exact budget was cited in the 4 Aug 1960 LAT, it was noted that AIP was moving away from low-budget fare and focusing on films that cost $500,000 or more, at that time.\n\nThe film was ready for release by mid-Jun 1961, according to a 23 Jun 1961 DV item. It opened on 23 Aug 1961 at the Palace Theatre in New York City, and the following week, a premiere event took place at Chicago, IL’s Roosevelt Theatre, as noted in a 25 Aug 1961 DV brief. For the occasion, a “giant pendulum” was hung from the marquee, and was set to swing during the last fifteen minutes of the picture to make sure no one was allowed into the theater at that time.\n\nDespite mixed reviews, the film became a box-office success. By early 1962, it was poised to surpass The Fall of the House of Usher’s $1.2 cumulative million domestic gross, according to the 28 Feb 1962 Var. Based on those earnings, Corman continued to produce and direct adaptations of Poe’s work, including Premature Burial and Tales of Terror (1962, see entries), and The Masque of the Red Death (1964, see entry).\n\nLess\n\nIn sixteenth-century Spain, Francis Bernard journeys to the foreboding castle of Nicholas Medina, the husband of Francis's recently deceased sister, Elizabeth.
