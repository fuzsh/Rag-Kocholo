        "text": "- What's your first name?\n\n- Harry.\n\nStop worrying, Harry.\n\nCos I got it straight from the top.\n\nIt's a hundred to one that\n\nwe'll never see combat again.\n\nIs that the real word, Colonel?\n\nFrom the top?\n\nFrom the top. A hundred to one.\n\n- Fragile Fox One.\n\n- This is Division. Colonel Bartlett there?\n\nYes. Hold on just a minute.\n\nColonel Bartlett.\n\nGeneral Parsons wants to see all\n\ncommanders as soon as possible.\n\n- Tell the general I'll be right over.\n\n- Thank you, sir.\n\nSo, that being the situation...\n\nI want you to relax\n\nabout Erskine. Ride it out.\n\nA year from now, you'll be a civilian\n\nagain, adjusting to the problems of peace.\n\nI feel better already, Colonel.\n\nThat's the ticket, Harry.\n\nCan you see me with a shave,\n\nhaircut, some toilet water?\n\nYou talk like you're the last guy left.\n\nAnd we don't know if we're going back.\n\n- Colonel's driver told me.\n\n- What does he know?\n\n- All right, there's the lieutenant. Ask him.\n\n- OK, I will.\n\nHey, Lieutenant, about that scuttlebutt.\n\nIs it for real?\n\n- What scuttlebutt?\n\n- About us being out of it.\n\n- Don't bet on it.\n\n- I hope they're right for once.\n\nLet's face it, I'm a hero.\n\nI got the blood lust.\n\nI'm a glory hound, and when I get...\n\nBut you just don't like to fight.\n\nThat's my problem, Chaplain. I'm yellow.\n\nPFC Bernstein, plump fat coward. Can\n\nI get a section eight for being yellow?\n\nMost of the guys'd all go to hell in a\n\nbucket for you or Lieutenant Woodruff.\n\nThe way things are, this outfit's\n\ngot an esprit de garbage pail.\n\n- Your French stinks.\n\n- So does the morale.\n\nBeat it.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nLieutenant Costa, sir.\n\n- Russians!\n\n- He's a regular Cossack. He's real tough.\n\nBut underneath it all, Snowden,\n\nthere beats a heart of solid rock.\n\nStop the scratching, Bernstein.\n\nI'm just checking to see\n\nif I got my dog tags.\n\nHello, Lieutenant.\n\n- I thought I'd find you here.\n\n- So, what happened?\n\nYou jerk. Why did you blow up?\n\nForget that. I saw the colonel leave.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nI talked to him. I told him that\n\nwe were in no shape for combat.\n\n- All right, let's go!\n\n- And?\n\n- What's going on over there?\n\n- Never mind. What did he say?\n\nHe already knew about Cooney,\n\nand he was understanding.\n\nSure. Understanding.\n\nYou'd think those two\n\nwere a vaudeville team.\n\nErskine and Clyde:\n\nfunny sayings, eccentric dances.\n\nJust a couple of little ol' country boys.\n\nUp to their knees in blood.\n\nWhat it adds up to is this:\n\nwe've nothing to worry about\n\nas far as Cooney is concerned.\n\nThe word from upstairs is\n\nit looks like we're out of the shooting.\n\n- What if we're not?\n\n- He said it's a hundred to one that we are.\n\nWhat if we have to go back up? The\n\ncolonel conned you out of any action.\n\nHe didn't con me.\n\nHe talked straight sense.\n\nYou haven't got it figured. I have.\n\nIf we go back, I got a solution for Cooney.\n\nA simple one. No channels to go through.\n\n- Just a nice, simple solution.\n\n- What? Joe! What would you do?\n\nI got it figured.\n\nJust let him goof once more.\n\n- Look, don't get any funny ideas.\n\n- I mean it, Harry!\n\nLieutenant!\n\nGet your men on the road\n\nin 20 minutes, sir. Full packs.\n\n- Back to France?\n\n- No, sir. We're going back up.\n\nThere's been a big breakthrough.\n\nThe paratroopers are already\n\non their way up.\n\nAll right. Better get over\n\nand alert the platoon.\n\nI want all platoon leaders outside the TP\n\nonce their men are on the road.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nWell?\n\nA hundred to one, huh?\n\nJoe! Joe!\n\nCooney is still in command,\n\nfor better or worse.\n\nAnd that's the situation. And I'm the exec.\n\nIf anything happens to him...\n\nI don't care if it's you or anyone else.\n\nThe office makes the man, huh, Harry?\n\nLet's wait and see developments.\n\nThe section we're concerned with is...\n\nNow, here we are. And the...\n\n- May I have your attention?\n\n- Sorry.\n\nHere we are. You got it?\n\nWe want this town, La Nelle.\n\nYou won't need this map till you get there\n\ncos you can see it from the hill.\n\n- What does G-2 say?\n\n- Nothing.\n\nIt hasn't been taken yet.\n\nI don't care how you do it. Just do it.\n\nRight. Will do.\n\nKeep contact with me on the 201.\n\nMaybe the Krauts have pulled out.\n\nIf they have, walk in.\n\nIf they haven't, run them out.\n\n- Can we expect any assistance?\n\n- All the other companies are committed.\n\nThis operation on La Nelle\n\nis strictly Fox Company.\n\n- OK, sir.\n\n- Good luck.\n\nWell, Woodruff, looks like Fox Company's\n\ngot another tough job.\n\nHitting the town\n\nfrom both sides would do it.\n\nWe can use Weapons\n\nin reserve for the 1st and 2nd.\n\n- I'll take Weapons, you take 1st and 2nd?\n\n- That's sound enough. Jackson!\n\nGet Lieutenant Costa over here.\n\nTell him to bring his platoon sergeant.\n\n- Come on, on the double!\n\n- Yes, sir.\n\nIf the first platoon gets pinned,\n\nwe can cover them.\n\nLet's take a closer look here.\n\nNow, supposing...\n\nsupposing we send a platoon\n\nto probe down the road here.\n\nNobody there, they walk in.\n\nWe follow 'em.\n\nIf they meet with any resistance...\n\nHere. They take this old house,\n\nhere in the outskirts, and they hole up.\n\n- I don't know about that.\n\n- Your idea is sound. It's very sound.\n\nBut it's rigid. It's by the book.\n\nThis way we hold off\n\ntill we see what's what,\n\nthen we can hit 'em from either side.\n\nAnd we got a base of fire\n\nright here in the town, if we need it.\n\nYes, sir, that's the plan.\n\nThat would be one method, I suppose.\n\nHey, Costa.\n\nWe've got another\n\nnasty little job to do here.\n\nLa Nelle?\n\nYeah. Division wants it occupied.\n\nWe got the assignment.\n\nThere may be Krauts in there.\n\nMost likely not.\n\nLet's just go on the basis that there are.\n\nHere. You take your platoon\n\nright down this road here.\n\nYou'll be covered most of the way.\n\n- You get there, you outpost the town.\n\n- Sounds nice and neat, Captain.\n\nNow let's go on the basis that\n\nthe joint is just crawling with Krauts.\n\nI'm in there with one platoon.\n\nWhat happens?\n\nYou take this house here in the outskirts\n\nand you hole up.\n\nWe hit them with the rest of the company.\n\nYou give us a base of fire.\n\nIf we need it. Got it?\n\nYou run into any real trouble,\n\nwe'll be behind you.\n\nI hope.\n\nAll right, if you don't like it, I'll get\n\nLieutenant Miller's platoon to try it.\n\n- Are you for it, Harry?\n\n- Joe, I think it should work.\n\nToliver, we'll move the men\n\ndown the road in a platoon column.\n\nRoad's covered till about\n\n400 yards from the house.\n\nThat last stretch I don't like.\n\nWide open. Could be trouble.\n\nOnly thing good about it is it's downhill.\n\nWhat?\n\nIf they're dug in, they could\n\ngive us a hard, hard time.\n\nNo use trying to crawl it.\n\nThere's no cover.\n\n400 yards in battle gear\n\nis too far to run,\n\nso we'll walk the first half\n\nand then we'll kick out.\n\nAnd pray. What do you think?\n\n- It could be a real, real crock, sir.\n\n- Get the men moving.\n\n- I'll be with you in a minute.\n\n- Yes, sir.\n\nThat's a mighty fine platoon sergeant\n\nyou got there.\n\nThe best.\n\nAnd he's not gonna wind up\n\nin any wringer.\n\nHim nor any of the rest of my men.\n\n- What do you mean by that?\n\n- Just this."
