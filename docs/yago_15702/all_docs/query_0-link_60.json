Click here to sign up for our free weekly newsletter.\n\nThe macabre comedy Poor Things (2023) has a lot going for it — Holly Waddington’s gorgeous BAFTA-winning costumes; Jerksin Fendrix’s delightfully distorted score; the dreamy BAFTA-winning sets by Shona Heath and James Price; and the freshest, funniest dance in any movie this past year.\n\nIt’s easy to be dazzled by Yorgos Lanthimos’s $35 million period piece when productions with far greater budgets aren’t as lush. Add the uninhibited performances by BAFTA-winner Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo into the Steampunk mix and audiences might be so bewitched, they’ll buy into the movie’s pro-feminism spin. After all, if the f-word solely means giving women the same opportunity as men then Poor Things is a feminist win since it lets co-producer Stone push a male gaze just like the big guys.\n\nIn this coming-of-age fantasy, “two nerds create the perfect woman who promptly turns their lives upside-down.” Wait, that’s the tagline for John Hughes’s teen sex comedy Weird Science (1985). Of course, it also applies to Tony McNamara’s adaptation of Alasdair James Gray’s novel “Poor Things: Episodes from the Early Life of Archibald McCandless M.D., Scottish Public Health Officer” (1992).\n\nNote, the Victorian-set book is a fictional autobiography by McCandless. During the 19th century, unreliable narrators popped up in a number of Gothic classics including Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” (1897); Robert Louis Stevenson’s “Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde” (1886); Emily Brontë’s “Wuthering Heights” (1847); Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Cask of Amontillado” (1846); and Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus” (1818), on which Poor Things is heavily influenced.\n\nWhile Gray’s novel uses the unreliable narrator device, screenwriter McNamara takes a different approach and presents the story from the wide eyes of its heroine: a grown woman with the brain of a baby.\n\nSpoilers ahead:\n\nLooking like scream queen Barbara Steele, Stone first appears against a saturated sky of Hammer horror blue. As the distraught and pregnant Victoria Blessington, she jumps from a bridge to commit suicide. Her supposed corpse is pulled from the Thames by the freaky Scottish scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) who transplants the still-living brain of Victoria’s unborn daughter into her reanimated body.\n\nAfter this re-birth, Godwin names his creation Bella and she calls him God. The film shifts to black-and-white to reflect Bella’s infant-like point of view as Godwin’s colleague McCandless (Ramy Youssef) moves in to document her development. There’s not much concern for Bella’s emotional IQ but great attention is devoted to her sexual awakening. Needless to say, the premise heavily plays into the antifeminist “Born Sexy Yesterday” trope.\n\nWhile seemingly at a toddler level, Bella begins to masturbate. It appears she reaches climax by inserting an apple (an apple?) into her vagina sans stimulation of her clitoris. In keeping with this naive notion of female anatomy, the film shows Bella eating, spitting, urinating, but never having a period. Imagine that: a beauty with an insatiable need to orgasm who has a child’s mentality instead of a visible menstrual cycle. Sounds more like a man’s dream girl than an empowered woman.\n\nNevertheless, the film presents Bella as a sensual being who is literally in touch with herself. Godwin says she is “progressing at an accelerated pace” yet Bella appears stuck on sex. If ever there was an argument that males don’t know how it feels to be female, this is it. As Steve Martin once joked, “I could never be a woman. I’d just stay at home and play with my breasts all day.”\n\nSure, young women grow in part through their sexual experiences. But to suggest it’s liberating for one with the maturity of a toddler or a tween to walk about town in bloomers and sleep around in general feels like pre-#MeToo manipulation. There’s a word for having sex with someone who lacks the agency to consent and it’s not feminism.\n\nStill, McCandless (who is an educated adult) falls in love with kiddie-brained Bella and agrees to marry her. When a Lothario lawyer named Duncan Wedderburn (Ruffalo) visits to draw up the papers, he notices Bella’s wayward tendencies and runs off with her. As the two head for Lisbon, the film stock switches to vivid color.\n\nIn Duncan’s defense, he’s uninformed of Bella’s cerebral situation, though he must know something is amiss. Initially, he’s aroused by her unconventional behavior until she tires of him. Per her preoccupation with sex, Bella does Duncan then moves on. In nearly every respect, she behaves like a stereotypical man. When she’s supposed to show empathy for the human condition, she throws Duncan’s money at the problem. There are never any signs of womanly compassion for either her lover or for mankind. As a result, Duncan becomes brokenhearted and broke while Bella acts like a sociopath.\n\nThanks to a mentor (Martha Von Kurtzroc), Bella expands her horizons. Apparently, she is a pragmatic thinker yet sees no obstacles in working for a madam (Kathryn Hunter) at a Parisian brothel. Instead of worrying about contracting a social disease or getting beat up, knocked up or locked up, Bella finds sexual pleasure in her submissive co-worker (Suzy Bemba).\n\nShortly after, she returns to England to visit a dying Godwin and marry McCandless. But the wedding ceremony stops when General Blessington (Christopher Abbott) appears. He’s the husband of Victoria Blessington, which would make him Bella’s father. Although McCandless is aware of this, he remains mum when his betrothed leaves with Blessington.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the surviving spouse turns out to be cruel, hence Victoria’s suicide attempt at the start of the plot. When Bella stands up to him, they struggle with a pistol and Blessington winds up shooting himself in the foot. Then, in the film, she performs an outrageous operation by implanting a goat’s brain into his body. The end?\n\nWhile wacky enough to match the movie’s surreal mise en scène, this conclusion differs from the book which offers a much-needed feminist twist. The novel has Victoria McCandless (aka Bella Baxter, aka Victoria Blessington) refuting McCandless’s tale. According to her, there was never a baby brain transplant. Most likely, the 25-year-old Victoria survived her suicide attempt and was nursed back to health by Godwin and McCandless.\n\nVictoria’s account frees the story of its creepy underage issues. Even if she endured a brain injury from the fall, Victoria still had the maturity to consent to sex, unlike Bella. And any inaccurate depictions of how a woman feels can be attributed to the skewed interpretation of McCandless, who would rather weave a science fiction yarn than admit his fiancée was promiscuous with other men. By eliminating McCandless as the unreliable narrator, McNamara becomes a women’s liberation mansplainer.\n\nScreenwriters cannot include everything from book to movie, but it’s counterproductive to cut essential information from the original source in favor of adding new and unnecessary material. Instead of fabricating Felicity (Margaret Qualley), for example, McNamara could have noted that Bella became Victoria McCandless, M.D., suffragette, pacifist and birthing stool advocate. Without this character arc, Poor Things endorses sexual exploitation over female emancipation."
