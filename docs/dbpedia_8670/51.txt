Sir Michael Caine, born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite Jr. on March 14, 1933, in Rotherhithe, London, is an iconic British actor known for his distinguished career spanning several decades. He grew up in a working-class family, and his father was a fish market porter while his mother was a charlady. Caine’s interest in acting was ignited during his time at Wilson’s Grammar School when he performed in school plays.

After completing his education, Caine served in the British Army for two years during the Korean War.
