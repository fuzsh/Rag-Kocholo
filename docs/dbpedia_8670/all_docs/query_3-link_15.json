        "text": "The 70-year-old actor, star of classic movies like The Italian Job (the original version), and the Harry Palmer films, unveiled the plaque yesterday outside St Olave's Hospital, where he was born in 1933.\n\n\"This Blue Plaque means more to me than a star in the Hollywood walk of fame ever would,\" he said.\n\n\"Iâ€™ve won a few awards in my time, but this really is the greatest - I would not have missed coming here today for the world.\"\n\nSir Michael was honoured by the people of Southwark themselves, who voted for him to have a plaque, along with Charles Dickens - whose memorial was unveiled by Simon Callow earlier this year.\n\nCllr Nick Stanton, Leader of Southwark Council, said: \"The success of the Blue Plaques campaign has been astonishing. We are absolutely honoured to be welcoming Sir Michael back to the borough.\"\n\nJonathan Ross - who backed the Hollywood star for a plaque - said: \"Sir Michael Caine is one of the few people who manage to combine stardom with total honesty.\n\n\"He is an inspiration to a generation of actors, filmgoers and critics while staying true to himself and his roots as a Londoner.\""
