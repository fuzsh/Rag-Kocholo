        "text": "The Pilgrims sailed to Southampton on 5th August 1620 where it was joined by the Speedwell. This ship proved to be un-seaworthy forcing them to turn back twice before The Mayflower took on some of her passengers. She finally set sail from Plymouth, south west England on 6th September 1620 with 102 passengers aboard.\n\nTwo months later they arrived along the east coast of America and landed in Plymouth Bay, Massachusetts, on 21st December. They were the first permanent European settlers in America.\n\nAs an organisation, (Southwark Heritage Association) we raise all the funding each year. The course is designed to introduce young people to the idea of a career in the travel and tourism industry through a structured programme of accredited training and work experience as “Ambassadors for the Borough”. The Project is successful in achieving its main target outputs, and in adding to the young peoples knowledge and pride in their local History and Heritage. It also helps to enhance the links between the local Heritage Association, Travel industry, local Schools, Colleges, and Youth Organisations.\n\nOnce the student’s interest has been rekindled and they attain the confidence through our guidance and interaction with members of the general public, they return to school with a better idea of what they want to do and how to achieve it. We are now taking students from seven local secondary schools with more wishing to take part as the course reputation has become better known.\"\n\nIf you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact us at 020 8299 0470 or 07702167187"
