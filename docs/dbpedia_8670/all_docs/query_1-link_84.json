        "text": "Michael Caine, our beloved Hoagie in JAWS The Revenge has announced his retirement from acting after a 70 stellar career. Sir Michael Caine, born as Maurice Joseph Micklewhite Jr. on March 14, 1933, is a British actor with a career spanning over six decades. His remarkable journey from a working-class background to becoming one of the most respected and beloved actors in the world is a testament to his talent, work ethic, and versatility.\n\nBorn in South London, Caine grew up in a modest family. His early years were marked by hardship, but he discovered his passion for acting at a young age. He took on the stage name Michael Caine in honor of his favorite movie, \"The Caine Mutiny.\"\n\nCaine's career began in the theater, but he soon transitioned to film. He gained recognition with his role in the film \"Zulu\" (1964), which showcased his ability to command the screen. However, it was his performance in \"Alfie\" (1966) that truly propelled him to stardom. His portrayal of the charming and morally ambiguous Alfie garnered him his first Academy Award nomination.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Michael Caine's career is his incredible versatility. He has tackled a wide range of roles across various genres, from drama to comedy, action to thriller. His ability to adapt to different characters and deliver authentic performances has earned him a reputation as one of the most versatile actors in the industry.\n\nCaine's illustrious career includes a string of memorable films. He won his first Academy Award for his supporting role in \"Hannah and Her Sisters” (1986) and a second for \"The Cider House Rules\" (1999). Caine was filming “JAWS The Revenge” (1987) when he won his first Oscar and was inable to attand the cermenot so co-star Sigourney Weaver accepted on hs behalf. Other notable films in his vast filmography include \"The Italian Job\" (1969), \"Get Carter\" (1971), \"The Man Who Would Be King\" (1975) and \"Educating Rita\" (1983).\n\nAs Caine's career continued, he remained an influential figure in Hollywood. His work in the 21st century, including roles in films like \"The Prestige\" (2006) and \"Inception\" (2010), demonstrated his enduring appeal and ability to adapt to modern cinema.\n\nCaine has also made a mark as a mentor, offering advice and guidance to younger actors. He published his autobiography, \"What's It All About?\" in 1992, sharing insights into his life and career.\n\nHow Michael Caine saved life of 'JAWS The Revenge' co-star\n\nBefore Jaws the Revenge Michael Caine had to escape Peter Benchley’s The Island\n\nMichael Caine and Richard Dreyfuss to team up for JAWS sequel\n\nMichael Caine's illustrious career is a testament to his talent, resilience, and adaptability. From his humble beginnings to his status as a knighted actor with multiple Academy Awards, he has left an indelible mark on the film industry. Caine's ability to captivate audiences with his performances, regardless of the genre, will continue to inspire and entertain generations of moviegoers, solidifying his place as one of the most iconic actors in cinematic history.\n\nRumours that Michael Caine has retired from acting just so it means he is unavailable to reprise his role in JAWS 5 are completely unfounded. You can catch Sir Michael in ‘The Great Escaper’ (his final acting role) as true-life hero Bernard Jordan who escapes from his care home to attend the 70th Anniversary of the D-Day Landings in France."
