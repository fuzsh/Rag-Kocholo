        "text": "Law has also been part of several high-profile franchises over the years, including 2019 as the MCU`s main antagonist to Captain Marvel. He`s an extremely reliable actor who always adds something new and refreshing to his characters, even in films that may not be the most critically acclaimed. Law was born in Greenwich, England, to parents who were both teachers. He showed an early interest in theatre and joined the famous National Youth Theatre as a teenager. After several appearances in short films and on stage, Law found his breakthrough in a production of Jean Cocteau`s play, Les Parents Terribles, which earned him a number of London critics` best newcomer awards. Its success was so great that when the play was re-performed on Broadway (named in “Indiscretions”), Law was the only British actor to repeat his role in the New York production. He received a Tony Award nomination for this performance and also attracted the attention of American directors and casting staff, who almost immediately began to engage the actor in a number of strong film roles. Law, an admirer of Sir Laurence Olivier, suggested including the actor`s image in the 2004 film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. With the help of computer graphics technology, images of young Olivier were incorporated into the film, in which Dr. Skull, a mysterious scientific genius and supervillain, is played. [16] [17] Also in 2004, Law played the lead character in Alfie, the remake of Bill Naughton`s 1966 film, in which he played the role of Michael Caine; [5] and went on to play another of Caine`s leading roles in the 2007 film Sleuth, adapted by Nobel laureate Harold Pinter, while Caine played the role of Olivier. Also in 2007, Law starred alongside Norah Jones in the romantic drama My Blueberry Nights, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival.[18] Jude Law is able to balance big changes in tone and tackle projects with experimental and ambitious blends of comedy and drama. He is also capable of being absolutely hilarious and eccentric, delivering devastating moments of emotion.\n\nWriter-director David O. Russell is certainly taking bold turns with his films, and 2004`s “I Heart Huckabees” is his craziest project to date. A bizarre satire on psychology, consumerism, class, and relationships, “I Heart Huckabees” is not meant to be fully enjoyed on first viewing. Law had the unique challenge of having to be completely sincere and not afraid to act like a fool. There was a danger that the satire would be too obvious if its performance was too exaggerated. Law, however, is subtle enough to incorporate the film`s latent humor into his performance. “Hugo” revolves around the exploits of young adventurer Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield). One of the reasons Hugo is such an assignable character is the tragic origin of his isolation. The first moments show a sensitive relationship between the boy and his father (Law), a widowed watchmaker. Hugo`s father tragically dies in a fire in his factory, but leaves his son with craftsmanship and technical knowledge.\n\nThe film focuses on the influence of pop star Celeste (played by child Raffey Cassidy and adult Natalie Portman) who survives a school shooting that profoundly affects her life. Young Celeste writes the song “Wrapped Up” about her experiences and is courted by a mysterious and anonymous producer (Law) who promises to make her a star. Law makes his motives ambiguous disturbing. Law played Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes (2009) and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011), a younger Albus Dumbledore in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018) and Yon-Rogg in Captain Marvel (2019); They are all among its most profitable publications. Other notable roles include Contagion (2011), Hugo (2011), Side Effects (2013), The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) and Spy (2015); and the television series The Young Pope (2016) and The New Pope (2020). After playing the role of a young version of Albus Dumbledore in the Fantastic Beasts franchise, Jude Law has once again been put in the spotlight of the great Hollywood. The actor has been involved in many different and unique projects over the years, most notably known for his wave of popular romantic comedies in the 2000s.\n\nIn 1994, Law played his first major role in the British crime drama Shopping, which also starred his future wife Sadie Frost. In 1997, he became known for his role in Oscar Wilde`s biography Wilde. Law won the Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer for his portrayal of Lord Alfred Douglas, the glamorous young lover of Stephen Fry`s Wilde.[5] In Andrew Niccol`s science fiction film Gattaca, Law played a former disabled swimming star living in a dystopia obsessed with eugenics.[13] In Clint Eastwood`s Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, he played Billy Hanson, a prostitute killed by an art dealer played by Kevin Spacey.[5] In 1998, Jude Law played Steven Grlscz, an experienced vampire and seducer, in The Wisdom of Crocodiles. In 2004, Law launched a campaign to raise £2.5 million for the £12.5 million renovation project of the Young Vic Theatre. [63] [64] He is currently Chair of the Young Vic Committee and has expressed pride in making Young Vic a “nurturing bed” for young filmmakers. In 2006, he joined Robbie Williams in the celebrity football match “Soccer Aid” for UNICEF.[65] [66] The film revolves around a young man named Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) who is determined to pursue his dreams, even though he is considered “unfit” for many jobs due to undesirable genetic traits. Freeman wants nothing more than to become an astronaut and is willing to defy official guidelines to go into space. In order to participate in the training program, he made a deal with Law`s character, Jerome Eugene Morrow. Jerome, who is confined to a wheelchair, allows Vincent to steal his identity by giving him genetic material. After his outstanding supporting role in “The Aviator” in 2004, it was exciting to see Jude Law do another collaboration with the great Martin Scorsese.\n\n“Hugo”, released in 2011, is a very different film from the rest of the legendary director`s filmography. Scorsese is known for his violent films that revolve around Catholic guilt and the mafia. However, “Hugo” is an adaptation of a children`s novel and tells a classic adventure story. Law adds to the magic of this joyful celebration of a film with a critical scene in the opening of the film. Born and raised in London, Law began acting in theatre. After finding small roles in feature films, Law was recognized for his role in Anthony Minghella`s The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor and was nominated for an Oscar. He also enjoyed critical and commercial success in Steven Spielberg`s Enemy at the Gates (2001), Steven Spielberg`s A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) and Sam Mendes` Road to Perdition (2002). He has also received praise for starring in the war film Cold Mountain (2003), the drama Closer (2004) and the romantic comedy The Holiday (2006), for which he received Oscar and BAFTA nominations. Law was born on 29 December 1972 in Lewisham, south London, the second child of Margaret Anne Heyworth and Peter Robert Law, both teachers.\n\nHis father later became, according to Law, “the youngest director in London.” His mother was adopted, but later reunited with his Welsh biological mother, Meinwen Parry.[1] He has one sister, Natasha.[6] Law was named David after one of his parents` best friends, but has been called by his middle name since birth.[5] The name Jude comes from “a bit of both” from the book Jude the Obscure and the Beatles song “Hey Jude”. Law grew up in Blackheath, a neighbourhood in the borough of Greenwich,[7] and attended John Ball Primary School in Blackheath and Kidbrooke School before attending Alleyn`s School.[5] [5] Jude Law is one of the most versatile actors of his generation. With more than two decades in the industry, it`s impressive that Law continues to reinvent himself. Law belongs to a generation of young stars who appeared in the late 90s and were often cast in leading roles because of his natural charisma and ability to reliably inspire an audience. Law plays writer Daniel Woolf, who is inspired to write a famous novel after a chance encounter with a young woman named Alice Ayres (Natalie Portman). Daniel`s relationship with Alice ends his engagement to photographer Anna Cameron (Julia Roberts). In his boredom, he also cheats on Larry Gray (Clive Owen), a prominent doctor, in a fake online relationship. When each of his partners discovers his illegal ways, Daniel is forced to face the consequences of his actions and he is pushed into a series of embarrassing situations. “Closer” is bubbling with excitement thanks to Law`s electric performance.\n\nIn 2006, he played the role of Kate Winslet`s only brother in The Holiday, a modern American romantic comedy written, produced and directed by Nancy Meyers. After his appearances in a number of historical dramas and science fiction films from the early to mid-2000s, Law stated that he struggled to address the contemporary role in this film."
