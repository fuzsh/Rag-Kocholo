        "text": "An icy, elegant blonde with a knack for playing complex and strong-willed female leads, enormously popular actress Faye Dunaway starred in several films which defined what many would come to call Hollywood's \"second Golden Age.\" During her tenure at the top of the box office, she was a more than capable match for some of the biggest macho stars of the 1970s. Then an overwrought turn in the disastrous biopic Meine liebe Rabenmutter (1981) effectively derailed her career - but, at the same time, made her a bit of a camp favorite in the gay community - though she's been afforded infrequent opportunities worthy of her talent since that unfortunate halt.\n\nBorn prematurely on Jan. 14, 1941 in Bascom, FL, Dorothy Faye Dunaway was the daughter of MacDowell Dunaway, Jr., a career Army officer, and his wife, Grace April Smith. After a stint as a teenaged beauty queen in Florida, she intended to pursue education at the University of Florida, but switched to acting, earning her degree from Boston University in 1962. She was given the enviable task of choosing between a Fulbright Scholarship to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts or a role in the Broadway production of \"A Man For All Seasons\" as a member of the American National Theatre and Academy. She picked the latter, enjoying a fruitful stage career for the next two years, which was capped by appearances in \"After the Fall\" and \"Hogan's Goat.\" The latter - an off-Broadway production in 1967 - required Dunaway to tumble down a flight of steps in every performance, earning her a screen debut in the wan counterculture comedy Die Meute (1967). Just five months after its release, however, she was wowing audiences across the country as Depression-era bank robber Bonnie Parker in Arthur Penn's controversial Bonnie und Clyde (1967). Her turn as the naïve but trigger-happy and sexually aggressive Parker earned her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations, and provided a direct route to the front of the line for Hollywood leading ladies in an unbelievably short amount of time.\n\nDunaway followed this success with another hit, Thomas Crown ist nicht zu fassen (1968), in which her coolly sensual insurance investigator generated considerable sparks with playboy and jewel thief Steve McQueen. She then bounced between arthouse efforts like Puzzle of a Downfall Child (1970), directed by her ex-boyfriend, photographer Jerry Schatzberg, and the revisionist Western Doc (1971), as well as big-budget efforts like Little Big Man (1970), which cast her as a predatory preacher's wife with designs on Dustin Hoffman's reluctant Native American hero. Dunaway also balanced these projects with several well-regarded theatrical productions, including a 1972-73 stint as Blanche Du Bois in \"A Streetcar Named Desire,\" and notable TV movies like The Woman I Love (1972), which cast her as the Duchess of Windsor, and TV broadcasts of Hogan's Goat (1971) and Nach dem Sündenfall (1974). But her turn as the duplicitous Lady De Winter in Richard Lester's splashy, slapstick take on Die drei Musketiere (1973) and its sequel Die vier Musketiere (1974) preceded a long period of critical and box office hits, starting with her masterful performance in Chinatown (1974).\n\nDunaway's turn as Evelyn Mulwray, the mysterious woman who draws detective Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) into a dark and complicated web of murder, incest, and catastrophic business deals, seemed the epitome of every femme fatale to ever stride across a chiaroscuro-lit scene in classic noir. But Dunaway also found the horribly wounded core of her character as well, and turned Evelyn from a pastiche to a full-blown and emotionally resonant human being. Critics and award groups rushed to nominate Dunaway for the role, and she netted her second Academy Award nod, as well as Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations. Dunaway had fought hard for her performance - her battles with director Roman Polanski were no secret - but sadly, she lost the Oscar to Ellen Burstyn for Alice lebt hier nicht mehr (1974). However, it would be Dunaway's performance which stood the test of time.\n\nHigh-gloss turns in Flammendes Inferno (1974) and Sydney Pollack's political thriller Die drei Tage des Condor (1975) preceded one of her best television performances; that of Depression-era radio preacher Aimee Semple MacPherson in The Disappearance of Aimee (1976). Even more startling was her sterling role in Network (1976), Paddy Chayefsky's blistering take on the television industry. Dunaway pulled out all the stops as an executive on the rise who stops at nothing to advance her career - even bedding veteran producer William Holden. Critics again rose in unison to praise Dunaway, and she finally netted an Oscar for the role, as well as a Golden Globe.\n\nSurprisingly, Dunaway's career began to falter after her Oscar win. She was effective as a fashion photographer who experiences disturbing visions in Die Augen der Laura Mars (1978), but was wasted in thankless roles as the dissatisfied ex of washed-up boxer Jon Voight in Der Champ (1979) and wife to Frank Sinatra's detective in Die erste Todsünde (1980). And then came Meine liebe Rabenmutter (1981), director Frank Perry's biopic of actress Joan Crawford based on the tell-all book by her daughter Christina Crawford. Crawford herself had praised Dunaway in the early stages of her career, and while some critics gave positive reviews to her performance - in particular, the extent to which she physically transformed herself into Crawford - most fixated on the hysterical dialogue and garish scenes of child abuse. Clips of Dunaway as Crawford bellowing \"No wire hangers!\" became immediate laugh-getters on late-night television, and a substantial gay following rose up in response to the film's high camp value. Dunaway, however, found none of the response amusing, and later admitted her regret in taking the role. Whether laughable or pure genius, no one could deny that Dunaway threw her everything into the role. The film's continued cult success proved she had succeeded in becoming Crawford.\n\nThe fallout from \"Mommie Dearest\" obscured Dunaway's follow-up projects, which included the title role in the TV movie Evita Peron (1981) and a return to Broadway in 1982's \"The Curse of an Aching Heart\". Discouraged, she moved to London with her second husband, photographer Terry O'Neill, who had also served as a producer on \"Mommie Dearest.\" For the next few years, Dunaway appeared sporadically in films, most of which underscored her newly minted status as a camp icon. Die verruchte Lady (1983) was an absurd, near-softcore period drama by Michael Winner, with Dunaway as an 18th-century highway robber. Fans of her early dramatic work were similarly aghast by her turn as a shrieking witch battling Helen Slater's Girl of Steel in Supergirl (1984). Only a Golden Globe-winning appearance in the cumbersome miniseries Die Straßen von Ellis Island (1984) offered any respite from the negative press which now continued to follow her.\n\nDunaway returned to the United States in 1987 following her divorce from O'Neill, and attempted to rebuild her career and reputation by appearing in several independent dramas. She was widely praised for her performance as a once-glamorous woman felled by alcohol in Barbet Schroeder's Barfly (1987), and served as executive producer and star of Skandal in Cold Sassy (1989), a TV adaptation of the popular novel by Olive Ann Burns about an independent-minded woman who romances a recently widowed store owner (Richard Widmark). Dunaway was exceptionally busy for the remainder of the decade in both major Hollywood features and independent fare, though her strong women now occasionally sported an unfortunate shrill side. She was Robert Duvall's frosty wife in the dystopian thriller Die Geschichte der Dienerin (1990) and contributed a vocal cameo as Evelyn Mulwray in Die Spur führt zurück (1990), the ill-fated sequel to \"Chinatown\". Other notable performances came as the unhappy wife of psychiatrist Marlon Brando in Don Juan DeMarco (1994), as the daughter of imprisoned Klansman Gene Hackman in Die Kammer (1996), and as a bartender caught in the middle of a hostage standoff in Kevin Spacey's Albino Alligator (1996). She later received Screen Actors Guild and Golden Globe nominations as the matron of a wealthy Jewish family in turmoil in The Twilight of the Golds (1996). Perhaps her best turn of the decade was as a seductive murderess who attempts to sway the unflappable Lt. Columbo (Peter Falk) in Der Tote in der Heizdecke (1993), which earned her a 1994 Emmy. She won her third Golden Globe as modeling agency head Wilhelmina Cooper in the biopic Gia - Der Preis der Schönheit (1998), starring Angelina Jolie as doomed model Gia Carangi.\n\nThe 1990s were also not without incident for Dunaway. She was embroiled in an ugly lawsuit against Andrew Lloyd Webber after he closed a Los Angeles production of his musical version of \"Sunset Blvd.\" with claims that she was unable to sing to his standards. The suit was later settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. A national tour of Terrence McNally's \"Master Class\", about the legendary opera diva Maria Callas, ended with her involvement in a suit over legal rights to the play. The project was expected to become her next great film role but remained uncompleted more than a decade after the 1996 tour. Her attempt at sitcom stardom in It Had to Be You (1993), co-starring Robert Urich, was met with universal disinterest, and the project was announced as being retooled without Dunaway prior to its cancellation.\n\nDunaway's schedule remained busy from 2000 onward, mostly in television and small independent features. She co-starred with Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix as the wife of career criminal James Caan in The Yards - Im Hinterhof der Macht (2000), then made her directorial debut with the short The Yellow Bird (2001), based on the play by Tennessee Williams. Younger audiences had their first taste of Dunaway's particular star power as Ian Somerhalder's mother in Die Regeln des Spiels (2002), Roger Avary's amped-up adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel, before Dunaway turned up the heat as a merciless celebrity judge on the reality series The Starlet (2005).\n\nDunaway penned her memoirs, Looking For Gatsby, in 1995, one year before receiving her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Attached throughout her professional career to intriguing men ranging from Lenny Bruce to Marcello Mastroianni, she was twice married; her first husband was singer Peter Wolf of the popular seventies rock group, The J. Geils Band. Liam O'Neill, her son by second husband Terry, followed in her footsteps with minor acting roles beginning in 2004. His father later dropped a bombshell in 2003 by revealing that Liam was not their biological son, but was adopted - a claim that Dunaway had previously denied.\n\nA series of occasional roles in little-seen films followed, but Dunaway was unexpectedly thrust back into the public eye at the 2017 Academy Awards. Reunited with Warren Beatty on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" the pair were tapped to present the Best Picture award to close the night. Before proceeding onstage, Beatty was mistakenly handed a backup envelope for Best Actress in a Leading Role, which had already been won by Emma Stone for La La Land (2016). Unsure what to do when he opened the envelope and discovered the error, Beatty stalled for time and showed the card to Dunaway; misunderstanding his intent, the actress announced that the Best Picture Oscar went to \"La La Land.\" During producer Jordan Horowitz's acceptance speech, he was informed that the actual Best Picture winner was Moonlight (2016). During the onstage chaos that ensued, Beatty delivered a heartfelt explanation and apology for the snafu while undergoing good-natured ribbing from host Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nAfter a break from her career and the memorable Oscars moment, Dunaway got back in the saddle as an actress working more frequently. Over the next year, she appeared in three films, starring in The Bye Bye Man (2017), Der Fall Jesus (2017) and Tödliches Verlangen (2017). She also fronted Gucci's summer 2018 ad campaign for their Sylvie handbag. Dunaway looked like she was going to return to Broadway with 2019's \"Tea at Five,\" a one-woman show in which she portrayed Katharine Hepburn, but she was fired from the play due to backstage fights with production staff during its Boston run. What followed was a lawsuit brought by her former assistant and a wave of articles alleging decades of bad behavior, with many declaring the 78-year-old screen legend \"canceled.\"\n\nDunaway laid low for the next few years, save for a role alongside fellow cancel culture victim Kevin Spacey in Franco Nero's L'uomo che disegnò Dio (2022), for which she replaced Nero's wife Vanessa Redgrave. Then, after extensive persuasion, documentary filmmaker Laurent Bouzereau managed to gain her cooperation for Faye (2024), a somewhat exonerative biographical account in which Dunaway reveals she has bipolar disorder. The documentary premiered to rave reviews at Cannes in spring 2024 and airs on HBO this summer. Next up for Dunaway is FATE, a supernatural mystery from director Jonathan Baker co-starring Harvey Keitel, Mena Suvari, Andrew McCarthy and Brandon Routh.\n\nStocky, genial-looking supporting actor Ned Beatty was once hailed by Daily Variety as the \"busiest actor in Hollywood.\"\n\nNed Thomas Beatty was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to Margaret (Fortney) and Charles William Beatty. He grew up fishing and working on farms. His hometown of St. Matthews, Kentucky, is hardly the environment to encourage a career in the entertainment industry, though, so when asked, \"How did you get into show business?\" Beatty responded, \"By hanging out with the wrong crowd.\" That \"crowd\" includes some of the industry's most prominent names, such as John Huston, Steven Spielberg, Robert Altman, Paul Newman, Richard Burton, Charlton Heston, Marlon Brando and Robert Redford.\n\nBeatty garnered praise from both critics and peers as a dedicated actor's actor. He started as a professional performer at age ten, when he earned pocket money singing in gospel quartets and a barber shop. The big city and bright lights did not come easy, though. The first ten years of Beatty's career were spent at the Barter Theater in Abingdon, Virginia. He then moved on to the Erie Playhouse in Pennsylvania, the Playhouse Theater in Houston, Texas, and the prestigious Arena Stage Company in Washington, D.C. He was also a member of Shakespeare in Central Park, Louisville, Kentucky. Later, he appeared in the Broadway production of \"The Great White Hope\". At the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, he won rave reviews when he starred in \"The Accidental Death of an Anarchist.\"\n\nIn 1971, Beatty was chosen by director John Boorman for the role of Bobby Trippe in the hit film/backwoods nightmare Beim Sterben ist jeder der Erste (1972). Co-star Burt Reynolds and Beatty struck up a friendship, and Ned was then cast by Burt in several other films together, including Der Tiger hetzt die Meute (1973), Ein Supertyp haut auf die Pauke (1975), and the abysmal Der rasende Gockel (1983). Ned's talents were also noticed by others in Hollywood and he was cast in many key productions of the 1970s turning in stellar performance, including an Academy Award nomination of Best Supporting Actor for his role in Network (1976). Beatty was also marvelous in Nashville (1975), under fire from a crazed sniper in Turm des Schreckens (1975), an undercover FBI man in the action comedy Trans-Amerika-Express (1976), as Lex Luthor's bumbling assistant, Otis, in the blockbuster Superman - Der Film (1978) ... and he returned again with Gene Hackman to play Otis and Lex Luthor again in Superman II: Allein gegen alle (1980).\n\nBeatty continued to remain busy throughout the 1980s with appearances in several big budget television productions including Die Tage von Pompeji (1984). However, the overall caliber of the productions in general did not match up to those he had appeared in during the 1970s. Nonetheless, Beatty still shone in films including The Big Easy - Der große Leichtsinn (1986) and Das vierte Protokoll (1987). Into the 1990s, Beatty's work output swung between a mixture of roles in family orientated productions (Gullivers Reisen (1996), Tom Sawyer und Huckleberry Finn - Die Rückkehr nach Hannibal (1990), etc.) taking advantage of his \"fatherly\" type looks, but he could still accentuate a hard edge, and additionally was cast in Radioland Murders - Wahnsinn auf Sendung (1994) and Im Sumpf des Verbrechens (1995). His many other films include Der Spielgefährte (1982), Alle Männer des Präsidenten (1976), Der Ketzer (1979), Touchdown - Sein Ziel ist der Sieg (1993), Spring Forward (1999), Hear my Song - Ein Traum wird wahr (1991) -- for which he earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor -- Bodyswitch - Verhexte Küsse (1992), Spiel des Lebens (1998) and Cookies Fortune - Aufruhr in Holly Springs (1999). Beatty's numerous television credits include three years on the NBC series Homicide (1993), Der letzte Ritt (1995) and The Boys (1993).\n\nBeatty received an Emmy Award nomination for Best Actor for his performance in Fürs Vaterland zu sterben (1979) opposite Carol Burnett, and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Family Channel's Last Train Home (1989). Other notable credits include Der Schutzengel (2004), The Execution of Private Slovik (1974), Golda Meir (1982), Pray TV (1982), the miniseries Robert Kennedy and His Times (1985), Lockerbie: A Night Remembered (1998) and T-Bone und Weasel (1992). He also had a recurring role on Roseanne (1988) and performed musically on television specials for Dolly Parton and The Smothers Brothers.\n\nIn 2001, Beatty returned to his theatrical roots starring in London's West End revival production of Tennessee Williams' \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" with Brendan Fraser. He also appeared in the production on Broadway in 2003/2004 with Jason Patric and Ashley Judd. In 2006, Beatty completed three features to be released next year: The Walker (2007); Paul Schrader's film also starring Woody Harrelson, Kristin Scott Thomas and Lily Tomlin; Paramount Pictures' Shooter (2007) starring Mark Wahlberg; and Der Krieg des Charlie Wilson (2007), Mike Nichols's film with Tom Hanks, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julia Roberts. Also in the 21st century, Beatty turned out a terrific performance in the popular WO DER ROTE FARN WÄCHST (2003). Blessed with eight children, Ned Beatty enjoyed golf and playing the bass guitar. He gave himself until the age of 70 to become proficient at both. He died at age 83 of natural causes on June 13, 2021 in Los Angeles, California."
