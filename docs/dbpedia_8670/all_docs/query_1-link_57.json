        "text": "Michael Caine is a distinguished actor, renowned for his cockney accent and powerful depiction of roles. He was born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite Jr. in a working-class family in South East London and was named after his father, who was a porter at a fish market. Beginning from a humble background, he went on to become one of the most celebrated stars in the English as well as American entertainment industry. In a career spanning more than 60 years, Caine has appeared in around 115 films, earning numerous awards and nominations. Today, he is regarded as a British film icon and ranked as the ninth highest-grossing star. In spite of such adulation, he remains a family-oriented private person interested in charity work. Although he had to change his name at the beginning of his career, he never forgot his roots and thus when he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000, he accepted the honor as Maurice Micklewhite. Apart from being an established actor, Caine is also a reputed writer and has authored 11 books, which include his autobiographies ‘What’s It All About’ and ‘The Elephants to Hollywood.’"
