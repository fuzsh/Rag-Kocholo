        "text": "This slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nEveryone in Islington’s got a story. Settle down for a cup of tea and a biscuit with the Scarbrough family (who’ve lived in Islington for years) and the chat switches from history to celebrity at rapid speed. If you want to know what Superfan Holly and her mother Helen Romero get up to, or see some of Jenny and Don Scarbrough’s fabulous postcard collection of local views from long ago then read on… Pix in gallery of Helen with her Jed Alert top and Jenny and Don with postcards.\n\nHelen Romero’s 13-year-old daughter, Holly, is the fifth in her family to be brought up in Islington. Her granddad, Don, who runs the locksmiths at 158 Blackstock Road, was brought up in Dillon Place, N7, a cul-de-sac long ago knocked down. It’s now the Sobell Leisure Centre. Don’s mum was born in 1904 at Gee Street, near the Barbican, N1, and he also remembers his Nan living at Sondenberg Road, opposite the Rainbow.\n\n“There used to be a bomb site on Isledon Road, just opposite. From about eight to 16 years I played on that bombsite every day,” says Don. His wife, Jenny, 63 – who’s lived in Islington since she was eight – and daughter Helen exchange a glance. They still can’t work out how anyone could amuse themselves all day outside with only the occasional treat to the seats known as ‘the Gods’ at the old Empire theatre (now Vaudeville Court, N4) to watch variety shows. But Don clearly loved his bombsite playground regaling me with tales of a very different childhood to his own daughter’s. All those years ago he and friends were allowed to ride on the fire engines, but if things went wrong the kids had to take themselves to hospital. “I broke my arm when I was nine or 10,” remembers Don, “I went up to hospital on my own because my mum was at work. I used to cut my head a lot and need it bandaged a lot too – once I fell off the bed on to a china potty and had to have a lot of stitches. Then there was the time I was hanging on to the back of a lorry and fell off, and had to have a lot of stitches. And then I got knocked off a bicycle….\n\n“…and had to have a lot of stitches,” laugh Jenny and Helen\n\nThere’s a passionate energy to this family. Helen’s 36 now, but before she was born Don and Jenny spent their early married days searching antique and postcard fairs for Islington postcards. They have about 50, many with messages written and posted in the very early 1900s. “Dear Mother, I’ve had an awful day…” reads out Jenny as she chooses local views that are still easy to recognise today. “You’d look through 100s, and they weren’t cheap, you can see they were about a tenner even then. The ones without the writing were the most expensive. ” And there was competition too – “ It felt like wherever we went there was a postman from Highbury who had been there just before us and bought what we wanted… We never met him.”\n\nNow it’s Helen and Holly’s turn to put the collecting gene to good use as Jedward superfans.\n\nMum and daughter –sometimes with granny Jenny too – have met Jedward everywhere, Tower Bridge, Greenwich Observatory, Heathrow… At Hadrian’s Wall this summer Holly even had her hair plaited by one of the brothers – all preserved for posterity with video and pictures. The girls even managed to send a message to Jedward when they were in the Big Brother house at Boreham Wood – a 30 second blast of their song, I’m your biggest fan, played on Helen’s sound system from a forest at the rear of the property.\n\n“We heard John and Edward shout ‘I love you guys’ from over the wall. Next thing we knew four cops came out of the trees with guns, but they were soon having a laugh and we took our photo with them. Another time we released 100 helium balloons with the initials J and E on them. They got tangled up in a tall tree so you could see the security men trying to climb it to get to them…”\n\n“It’s not stalking,” says Helen trying to explain the concept of Superfan. “I mean it’s better than being a football fan. Jedward have 700,000 plus twitter followers but they know their fans always find them. They come out and chat when we find out where they are after one of our Jed Alerts. They share biscuits with their fans. How many Arsenal footballers would do that? I even got the go-ahead from their mum who’s always with them, she told me ‘The boys love you fans, it’s what they’ve always wanted.’”\n\nClearly there’s a lot of truth in the saying that the family who plays together stays together. Stroll down to see some pictures from Jenny and Don’s fabulous postcard collection. Can you recognise these local landmarks?\n\nLEFT: Highbury Park, 1904 – better known now as Highbury Barn\n\nRIGHT: Gillespie Road, undated, showing what it looked like before Arsenal tube was built.\n\nABOVE: This Highbury Place postcard was bought for £6.10. The omnibus is just on the Highbury Corner roundabout and to your left there is now Highbury Pool.\n\nABOVE: Highbury Park Terrace, 1905 – the note says “Dear Annie, I hope you enjoyed yourselves at the sea.”\n\nABOVE AND BELOW: X-marks the spot on this postcard of Highbury Park. It’s to Maud, who lived in Putney, from Mabel who worked here in Highbury. Amazingly the card is stamped 25 December 1903, 12.15am (post offices clearly worked astonishing hours) and says. “Just a few lines to wish you a happy christmas. This is our H (house) where I have put two crosses.” It’s tempting to imagine Maud and Mabel as sisters working hard on Christmas Eve for their respective employers’, but still determined to snatch time to write a postcard.\n\nThe Quadrangle at St John’s Hall, Highbury burnt down years ago. The Scarbrough’s were unsure where the Quadrangle used to be. Was it where St John’s school is sited or on land behind the Children’s Home* (now converted into flats)? Jenny tells me: “My friend and her two brothers were abandoned on the steps of St Johns’ church. She was put into the Children’s Home. It was a beautiful place, but they kept the area at the back as a field because they couldn’t grow flowers on it because there were millions of bones. That’s why it’s called High Bury – we’ve got all the 1665 plague victims of London.”\n\nDon and family run A Buckenham (locksmiths) at 158 Blackstock Road, N5.

Through the 1920s NCH added a hospital, hostels and a staff training centre. In 2008 NCH Action for Children, which by now had its HQ in Hertfordshire, sold the building for conversion to flats. These were beginning to be occupied from 2012 onwards – look for the animal topiary hedges in the flower beds near the bus stop.\n\nOver to you\n\nWhat do you think about a family passion like postcard collecting or being a superfan?

And yes, this islington people blog is inspired by Spitalfields Life written by the Gentle Author.\n\nEveryone in Islington has a story, so meet butcher David Mayers – a butcher all his working life, but one who has “never had to butcher animals”. Interview by Nicola Baird.\n\n“I went to school with Rod Stewart*,” says David Mayers as we start the interview in his spotless shop, Highbury Butchers on Blackstock Road. It’s a Monday, the one day of the week the business is closed, so he’s doing a bit of redecorating and has time to be interviewed. Turns out that the pop star famous for his spiky hair-do and songs like Maggie May was in the top form when David started at the boy’s school William Grimshaw in Muswell Hill (now known as Fortismere)*. “I also used to go up with Rod to Highgate Woods and make up a team for football. He was really good at football – he played for the Highgate Red Wing. We used to get jealous when he got famous and popped over to his dad’s paper shop in his fast cars.”\n\nDavid left school when he was 16 or 17 and started work in a butchers shop as a trainee. But since 1979 – in his early 20s – he’s run the excellent Highbury Butchers by the bus stop on the corner by Mountgrove Road with his wife Sally who is now in charge of the accounts and the rigorous cleaning duties – although she’s often behind the counter too.\n\nEight butchers to choose from\n\n“When I came to Blackstock Road there were about eight butchers,” he remembers. “There was Stewarts, William Brothers, Dewhursts, at the Hi Fi shop over the road was Prime Meats, where I used to work – in those days you moved on to improve yourself – and was partners with the German butchers, Sez’s and Sons, that’s now the big charity shop, Second Chance. There was one down Gillespie Road, Wallers, and there was Middletons and Sons which I bought. Then on the hill there was an Irish butcher by the zebra crossing at Riversdale Road, and up at Highbury Barn they had Frank Godfrey, http://www.godfreys.co/ and there was a butcher opposite Frank Godfrey too. I remember that when one butcher shut the butcher blocks, wall tiles of dairy and beef cattle and old fashioned gold leaf signs and big gold leaf swans they used in the window display all went to America.”\n\nWith London’s main meat market Smithfield a few miles away and centuries of livestock being brought for slaughter to the abattoirs at Caledonian Road, it is perhaps no surprise that the area had so many butchers. Perhaps what is surprising is that David remembers when he started as a Saturday boy – delivering meat on a bike up at East Finchley and then as a trainee at one of the three branches of Pulham and Sons up at Muswell Hill – the competition was no problem. “We were all busy selling to customers and local restaurants. It was quite hectic, with long hours. People didn’t have fridges so they bought for the day.”\n\nBack then butchers were known as hard drinkers. “If you look at the old pictures you can see there was a pub on every corner at Smithfield. Even when I went there the porters* would be in the bar drinking. You’d have to give them a list of where the meat was that you’d ordered and they’d pick it up for you,” says David laughing at the memory.\n\nOld business\n\n“This butcher had been here since 1905.” David points out the rail where the meat was hanged, the site of the trap door it was dropped through to be stored in a wooden fridge and kept cold by bocks of ice. “There was just a marble slab in the shop window, it wasn’t refrigerated so I put in chiller cabinets,” he explains, then smiles remembering the former shopkeeper’s eccentric shop hours. “He was shut on Mondays and Thursdays and at lunch time for an hour and a half. His wife used to cook his dinner and then he’d lay on the camp bed for a sleep. He was about 70 years and wanted to retire. And when you bought anything from the shop you paid a cashier in the office over there.”\n\nThe new look Highbury Butchers has survived well, probably because David, now 57, has been adept at providing what shoppers want. There’s all sorts of meat – all British sourced from Quality Standard Mark* suppliers plus ready-to-use sauces and eggs. Behind the counter is an authentic butcher’s block on which are laid eight sharp-looking knives. “It’s all to do with animal welfare,” explains David pointing at one supplier’s poster. “This producer has some free range hens and the others are inside on hay. They’ve got Radio 2 playing! They are dry plucked and they do not add water to the meat. It means the chicken lasts a week in your fridge. Meat plumped up with water does not.”\n\nNew ways of shopping\n\n“I think since the recession we’ve got busier,” he notes. “People have maybe cut back on restaurants. You can buy a couple of sirloins (steaks) for £10, a fiver each – but if you go out for a meal could cost you £50. Years ago mothers used to bring their daughters in and teach them the cuts of meat. They’d say what beef was good for braising or frying or what to use for lamb stew – lamb breast is cheaper than chops. But it’s different now. Young people read cook books, usually Jamie Oliver, and come in asking for certain cuts. We always advise what’s best. My wife uses his books too – and we give out a lot of recipes in the shop.\n\nFor the first few years Sally and David lived upstairs. “We moved to Kent 20 years ago, when my son was one year old. We’re in Orpington but we start early – there’s not much traffic at the time we leave. The couple now have two sons, one at college doing business and the other about to go to university to study electrical engineering. “They help out at weekends and Christmas. My youngest has a part-time job at Sainsbury’s – working here has done him in good stead because he’s good with people.”\n\nHowever David is not so impressed by the meat supermarkets sell. Seems there is a secret to meat storage – hanging it so it matures and ultimately tastes better. “People buy with their eyes,” explains David, “so if it looks nice and fresh at the supermarket they get it. But it’s not really matured, so not so tasty (and it may be plumped up with water). As butchers have gone the supermarkets have a monopoly and they put the prices up. I’ve looked around and we’re no dearer. What’s more people can come in here for one or two chops or sausages – in a supermarket you tend to have to buy a pack. People tell us supermarkets make them buy things they don’t want, because it’s on offer or a two for one, and then you don’t get around to eating it and chuck it away.”\n\nDavid’s words make sense. I’ve been unable to pass on to my meat-eating daughter the meat-buying and cooking skills of a thrifty mum because I’m a vegetarian. If you have a similar family dilemma, or if you love meat and want help buying a bigger range of cuts, be sure to visit a butcher like David Mayers, so you can ask the questions Jamie Oliver cook books (and careful budgeting) makes us want to ask…\n\nHighbury Butchers, 183 Blackstock Road, London N5 – is open Tuesday to Saturday.Tel: 020 7226 2339.

Here’s what life’s like at the Oasis, plus Yehia’s plans to make it even better.\n\nInterview by Nicola Baird.\n\n“I love it here in Islington. Because I live in Highbury I used to walk in the fields with my children. But this is the best spot,” says Yehia El-Nemer who runs the Oasis cafe at the top of Highbury Fields – just by the 2 o’clock club and the tennis courts. Without that café, and Yehia’s unfailingly gentle smile and enquiry “How are you?” Highbury would be a less welcoming place.\n\n“I give my life to here,” says Yehia smiling. “I’m here seven days a week from 8am until 7pm. Nine o’clock in the summer time. It’s hard work. But it’s very friendly. I know everybody – all the famous people. There’s Boris*, Nick – he’s my best friend – and Clive. Lots of writers, actors, painters and famous people.”\n\nMothers are also big clients making use of the tables in the dog-free fenced area opposite which always seems to catch the sun. Yehia, who will be 60 in April 2013, has added the toys toddlers adore (push cars and a little slide) so that little children can play safely outside without heading for the traffic and buses on Highbury Grove. It helps that he’s a dad. And a very proud one, his eldest Charles, 19, is in his first year at York University studying economics and Alexander, 16, is at Camden Girls School. “They are both very good tennis players,” adds Yehia. “Alexander is #5 in the county (Middlesex) and coaches. They both started playing tennis aged four and always went to the Highbury Fields tournaments.”\n\nYehia learnt tennis when he was a child too. Tennis is obviously still important to Yehia – it’s the background music at the Oasis as players use the nearby courts. He also sells tennis balls alongside the cakes and delicious main meals.\n\nYehia was born in Cairo, Egypt and originally trained as an agriculture engineer dealing with import and export of fruit and vegetables. In the 1980s he came to the UK and worked in hotel management for 30 years. It’s all been preparation for running the Oasis which he took over around 2004 from Anna and her husband who were retiring to go back home to Italy.\n\nSeventeen applied for the café lease, including Starbucks. Yehia came second, but luckily for him the winning bid – from a mum he knew at St John’s Highbury Vale Primary where his boys went to school – pulled out. “The council phoned me and said they liked my CV and business plan. So I took over. I’d worked in so many hotels – Jarvis (previously London Embassy) and the Royal Lancaster and started as a food and beverages manager so I knew suppliers. I didn’t work as a chef but I knew about cooking. When I opened Oasis I tried the Egyptian food I like and people loved it.” The menu now is mixed Egyptian and English food – most popular is the Egyptian potatoes, the aubergine special and falafels. “People like the Egyptian pasta with béchamel sauce too (it’s like a lasagne). And I serve a lot of children’s food.”\n\nWhile most of us talk about the weather, Yehia’s business depends upon it. “Knowing the weather is not for me only. As soon as these Highbury people see the sun and the warm they come here. There is no doubt – where else will they go? I listen to the weather report a week before, and the night before too, because I have to get the orders right; contact the staff (two work part time at Oasis) and know what to cook. On a good day about 200 people will come by. But when the weather is not so good and no one but the dog walkers and tennis people come, then you only go home with £20 in your pocket.”\n\nYehia – his family name means tiger – has ambitious plans to make his café better for winter visits with a double-glazed, covered sitting area to keep his customers warm.\n\nHe’d also like to see the council offering another loo, currently there is only one superloo that costs 20p to use. “There should be more toilets – what do mothers who are pregnant or toddlers do? Where can they go?” he says.\n\nHis café has 10 tables in a roofed but open-walled area so most years he closes in January and February, although sometimes his nephew Mohamed will open on winter weekends. “This year I will go to Egypt, see my family and relax. I like to go to the beach and chat with friends. And I’ll learn more Egyptian dishes. I want to work on my lentil soup.”\n\nYehia may be the one you recognise behind the Oasis counter but he also finds time to notice all the changes to the area. “Highbury has more and more houses – there are building at the old university at the top of the hill and at Aberdeen Studios, the old office area on Highbury Grove. Houses are everywhere, so I want a bigger kitchen and to extend the menu to attract more people.”\n\nHere’s hoping Yehia’s plans come off as it would mean local residents would be able to bump into each other at the Oasis every day of the year, rather than just when the sun shines. See you there.\n\nOasis in the Park café, Highbury Fields, N5 is open every day from 8am to dusk (later in the summer). In the morning there is delicious coffee and a range of cakes including raisin scones and apricot flapjacks. For lunch and summer evenings try the Egyptian specials. Children’s meals approx, £2.50.\n\nWords\n\nBoris, Nick, Clive – Boris Johnson, Nick Robinson, Clive Anderson\n\nOver to you\n\nWhat do you think of this wonderful man and the Oasis cafe?

Interview by Nicola Baird.\n\nBorn in London in 1948, Edward Smith, has been in Islington since he was 17. His father didn’t like to be tied down, so Edward remembers a peripatetic childhood. “I think he rented 21 homes so we were in Chelmsford, and Surrey and I was at school in Cambridge,” says Edward. “But we used to come to Islington for the once a month missionary meeting. Sometimes my father would get a taxi from Waterloo station up to Highbury and you could see Islington was really poor. It was full of bomb sites*, and the famous bomb site at Highbury Corner*. The gentrification didn’t happen until the 1980s.”\n\n“My parents weren’t missionaries, but they were supportive,” explains Edward. But the missionary link led to the family first moving into the Foreign Mission Club*, still in Aberdeen Park, N5, and later to being offered a first floor flat in a missionary house at Hamilton Park West, N5.\n\n“My father worked in the City until the war (1939-45). He decided to be a volunteer and the RAF* took him. He was an officer. He didn’t have a gun. He never went up in a plane. But he supported the troops on the ground. He’d have to get 500 men from York to London say. To stop them absconding he lined the train platforms with food! I never could understand why that worked. But he was at Bristol and saw a bombing raid. It terribly shook him up. He became a bit ill, but avoided mental hospital. As a child we’d go by train together to see cricket matches and he was terrified of lightning. If there was a storm he’d hide under the seats. It was so embarrassing. It might have been to do with the war. He died when I was 22, so my mother (who was a pharmacist) and I moved to the smaller basement, you’d call it a garden flat now. I remember looking down the hill (towards Arsenal, Finsbury Park and Holloway) and thinking I’m going to live there…”\n\nAnd he has. In fact he has only lived in five places as an adult – all in Islington. His current home is with a housing association in N4. “I was working as a postman, and in the 1980s this got you on the council list, I only waited two years. People said it was badly paid, but I thought the money was fantastic, I felt like I was rolling in it, and it didn’t seem like much work.”\n\n“I didn’t go to university, but from school on until the age of 30 I had 100 jobs. It was so easy to get a job then. I got two in one morning once, though that was at Madame Tussauds and the Planetarium. It’s not like that now. I worked in a library, the library is no longer there. I worked on the railways, as a rent collector at Gatwick airport. I was privately educated – my parents weren’t very wealthy, they spent all their money educating me. They were warned that I shouldn’t read George Orwell’s Down and Out in Paris and London, but I did…” Maybe that’s what made me try so many manual jobs?”\n\nChess however has been a constant in Edward’s life.\n\n“I learnt to play chess at school when I was about 11. All the kids had pocket chess sets made of cardboard and would play on the bus home. When I was 19 I met someone who had grown up in Islington, been to a secondary modern here. He was an Islingtonian*, who went on to teacher training. We used to play chess a lot. With no mercy! If you made a mistake, that was it. He won a lot, perhaps because he was more confident. But I hated losing,..”\n\n“I have another friend, a genius chess player who I met on an accountancy course. I still play him, but on a computer. That helps my game, even though over the last three years I’ve only beaten him once – it was the best move of my life!”\n\nThis year (2012) he was urged by a church-going friend to set up a weekly chess club at St Thomas’ Church, N4 where he’s been a regular since 1996. Here he teaches the newbies, instructs on some finer moves (eg, the fork played with a knight) and provides cake. The officiating is done with a light touch and helped by Robert. “The chess club gives us older people the chance to view the younger members of the church,” writes Edward in his first chess club newsletter.\n\nEven if rooks and bishops aren’t your thing it’s worth going to chess club, just to hear more fascinating tales from Islington people.\n\nSt Thomas’ chess club is on Mondays, 7.30-9pm. Drop in (under 16s must be with an adult). Cost: £1-£5 (fees explained at the first session). Entrance can be a puzzler – it’s on St Thomas’ Road where the church has a door nearest to the houses.\n\nWords\n\nForeign Mission Club – founded in 1893 and now known as the Highbury Centre, is at 20-26 Aberdeen Park, N5. The short history on its website claims the club has hosted thousands of missionaries, Christian ministers, overseas and home visitors. It still offers short and up to three month stays, B&B and conference facilities. Edward’s family were Plymouth Brethren.\n\nIslington bomb sites – Highbury Corner was hit by a V2 on 27 June, 1944 killing 26 people and leaving 150 inured, see the memorial plaque on site, and also here.

Interview by Nicola Baird.\n\n“Everyone knows (my colleague) Ozzie,” says Suleyman, 40, who runs the buzzing Arsenal Food & Wine shop, on the corner of Ambler and Blackstock Road, with Ozzie. “He’s family – my wife is a cousin of his,” he explains.\n\nBut people know Suleyman well too, as for the past four years Ozzie and Suleyman have kept this impressive local shop open from 8am to midnight, taking it in turns to do the early or late shift – so that both men do a seven hour day.\n\nBorn in the town of Kaysairi, in the central part of Turkey, Suleyman is proud to be an Alivi and speaks three languages Kurdish, Turkish and English. He seems effortlessly to switch between these three, simultaneously serving a stream of customers while being interviewed. Clearly his first year of a business degree, before it became too precarious for him to continue studying in Turkey, has stood him in good stead. “It was very dangerous, and now Turkey is terrible again, many journalists are in jail,” he says regretfully. As a result he ended up in London.\n\nIn the UK his first job was making women’s jackets, first at a factory in Leighton, and then Hackney. “I’m good at sewing,” he says smiling, “my brother taught me.” Next step was to work in his sister’s shop in Clapton. “I learnt everything about shops through experience,” he adds good humouredly. That said he has big ambition for his two young daughters, 10 and 12 years– including the hope that they will be able to finish any university course.\n\nFor now Suleyman’s life is tied up with Arsenal Food & Wine. “I like to buy different things, I like this shop. Customers say it looks very small from outside. They come in once, and then they come again. We have so many things you can’t find in other shops.” It’s true: come here for your basics, but you can also choose from three different sorts of olives, fresh walnuts, gluten free stock, FSC-certified toilet roll, healthy and Fair Trade items, all sorts of Mediterranean produce and a range of lagers. That’s probably why competition from nearby Tesco, Lidl and Sainsbury’s has not been a problem.\n\n“So many of our customers support small shops, we’ve seen two or three shops close. But we try to make this different, so it’s not the same as the others. Everything is quality, and there is more organic. When customers need something we try to get it, that’s how we started with organic and Ecover refills.” Indeed last year impressed residents from the Blackstock Triangle (households living in the area between Blackstock, St Thomas’ and Gillespie Roads gave Suleyman and Ozzie (see photo above) an award for being their favourite local shop. Quite a crowd collected by the zebra crossing to celebrate with a big picture at the impromptu certificate handover – and of course it made the local Tribune newspaper too.\n\nSuleyman may be behind the counter most days, but he is a huge fan of the area. “Islington is just better. For example I live in Edmonton on a street like Ambler Road, but there nobody speaks. Even my next door neighbours will only say hi, and that’s it. But here it’s different. People are so friendly.”\n\nArsenal Food & Wine, 68b Blackstock Road, N4\n\nOpen 8am-late. Sells all household needs, stocks fresh veg, all sorts of dairy items/grains/tea/alcohol. There is organic and gluten free stock. Plus one of the few places in Islington to offer Ecover (soap, washing up liquid, all purpose cleaner) refills.\n\nOver to you\n\nWhat do you think of this wonderful man and his shop?

Interview by Nicola Baird.\n\nMost Tuesdays Ron Pace is up in Highbury. As ever he’s dressed in flat cap, work boots and a blue jumper, but today he’s leaning on a bollard outside Drayton Park Primary School, N5 studying the slow dismantle of the RNLB lifeboat in the playground. Ron’s a touch arthritic, so ready for a chat before he heads up hill to his Highbury yard. Behind the expensive houses and Olden Community garden there’s an unexpected piece of old Islington which still has stables, manure pile and a pigeon loft.\n\nRon was born at home in Freeling Street, N1 in 1935, and seems to have forever been one of Islington’s originals. His father ran a yard with 12 driving horses, mostly Welsh cobs, in Pembroke Street, not far from King’s Cross – the site is now flats. And Ron was impatient to follow him into horse business.\n\n“When I was a boy at Gifford Street School (kids started at about five and left at 14) I’d bunk off and go and borrow a horse and cart and go scrap totting. I’d find old iron, rags, metal just lying in the street. By the time I was 12 I was in the fruit game. I went round with a horse and cart selling tomatoes, beetroot, potatoes, apples, pears door to door. And on Sundays I’d sell winkles and cockles. The other kids were jealous because they didn’t have horses, they were just lahdidahs, did nothing.”\n\nTram traffic\n\nRon grew up seeing trams along Caledonia Road, Upper Street and Essex Road but there were still plenty of horses pulling carts in London. “I didn’t have a favourite horse, and my dad had two or three men who looked after them. I liked breaking them into harness.” He laughs and then admits, “I can ride, but have never really been riding! It’s better if a horse is trained at one thing, not ride and drive.”\n\nAs a youngster he enjoyed visiting the blacksmith at Star Street, Paddington – an essential visit made every six weeks by horses using tarmac roads. “I started pulling shoes off for the farrier, and not long after I started putting them on,” he says with a characteristic twinkle. When we meet up in the street Ron often talks about doing a shoeing job for a mate’s Shire – huge heavy horses, weighing around a tonne, which require considerable skill to shoe – especially if you’re 77. It ought to be a young man’s game but blacksmiths, like Ron, seem to have special abilities to stop their clients’ horses leaning on them.\n\n“So much has changed, especially prices,” he says matter-of-factedly. “I can remember going to Elephant and Castle and buying a cob for £14, and a set of harness for five quid.” These days a top class Welsh Cob stallion can fetch nearer £10,000. Though Elephant & Castle still has eclectic offerings at its daily market, finding a horse (other than as a motif on a Tshirt) is unlikely.\n\nFlying changes\n\nHorses may be Ron’s first love but he’s an expert with other animals too. He often brings a Jack Russell terrier up to his yard, and he has a soft spot for bantams, canaries and homing pigeons.\n\n“I only got racing pigeons for my kids,” he claims. But his two sons and daughter have long grown up and Ron still has 19 birds – many he bred himself.\n\nIt’s a marvellous feeling to be in London hearing the swift flap of racing pigeons as they woosh over you at 50mph, racing towards Arsenal’s Emirates stadium, and then seem to turn as one and flash back for another circle, and another, before disappearing from view. Turns out they were Ron’s. He’s surprised by my interest. “There used to be pigeons everywhere,” he explains. “Twelve or 14 pubs round here had them. You could bet on them you see. There’s a few left – go to the Wood Green Social Club, they’ve still got pigeons.”\n\nNext stop: Wood Green.\n\nWords\n\nWelsh cobs – hardy native breed approx 13-14hh (hands high), 130cm -143cm measured from the withers at the base of the neck.\n\nLahdidahs – work that doesn’t involve hard graft (eg, printers in Fleet Street working for the Star or Standard), or doing nothing.\n\nScrap totting – collecting and selling unwanted items. Nowadays the council takes on this job by offering recycling and rubbish collection.\n\nBlacksmith/farrier – skilled job shaping hot metal to fit a horse’s foot. Horses need reshoeing every six-eight weeks, costing approximately £50-70 per set of four shoes.\n\nOver to you\n\nWhat do you think of this wonderful man?
