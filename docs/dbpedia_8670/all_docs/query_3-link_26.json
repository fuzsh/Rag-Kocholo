        "text": "PASTOR CORONEL\n\nIn January 1950, at the age of ten I went on a huge cattle round up, riding a donkey. The place called Campo Triangolo, a huge track of grassland that was supposed to belong to the Bruderhof. The Bruderhof took me to Paraguay in 1941 as a British War Orphan, from Nottingham England. As an orphan on the Bruderhof I spent most of my school years ‘working’ or as it was called: In ‘Ausschluß’ exclusion for having ‘evil thoughts’ for having been born illegitimate, inheriting the Sin of my mother, according to Heini Arnold “Die Sünde deiner Mutter ist in dir, und die muß ich dir austreiben.”\n\nThis cattle round up had an important effect on my later life, on this day I first met Pastor Coronel, he was about five years older than me. His uncle Don or rather ‘Mayor’ Coronel owned a neighbouring Estancia Ranch to the Bruderhof, his Estancia was called San Martin. In Paraguay landowners/estacieros like to give themselves military titles for importance hence the ‘Mayor’ like Captain Mainwaring,\n\nThis round up usually provoked lots of confrontations, many different owners of cattle could never agree on who owns what cattle as many cattle had such a variety of brand marks on them, making them look like graffiti walls, in Paraguay all animals are suppose to be branded on the left only. Mayor Coronel habitually carried a gun, he must have read the little red book by Chairman Mao, were it says on page forty-eight: “The Power Of The People Comes Out Of The Barrel Of A Gun.” For this reason he was highly respected or feared, pending on your language? It was him, who let me shoot his Colt ’45 revolver for the first time in my life; the recoil hurt my thumb, this made all the Paraguayan onlookers laugh really loud. There were other Paraguayan people who knew me, first and foremost my good friend Benito Alvarez, a most learned cattle thief, he called me Hobý that means blue in Guarani because of my blue eyes, he knew me from when I was four years old. Felix Prieto was there too, he called me Castigado because I was so much in Ausschluß, I was six the first time we met and Felix wanted to know why I was not with the other children? When there was food to be had, he made sure I was first with the best piece of ‘Hasado’, barbequed meat! Paraguayans are very fast in finding out what is really going on and inventing names for any one or anything. Most called me ‘Maico’ as they could not pronounce my English name. Even at that time my friends were indigent Paraguayans boys, not boys from the Bruderhof who all ostracised me all my life and to this day.\n\nIn the afternoon Mayor Coronel said to Pastor “che-ogar-pé” in Guarani means going home. Pastor in turn said to me: “ya-há” what means lets go. So I did to the annoyance of the Bruderhof Brothers, after all it was Mayor Coronel who had a gun and they would not argue with him? Some how they had separated about twenty head of cattle. In Paraguay when driving cattle any distance one has what is known as a ‘Sinuelo’ a ‘trained’ leader ox, but the sinuelo from Mayor Coronel was a cow, a skinny cow, a ‘vaca flaca’. A friend of Pastor, Pastor and myself set off with these cattle back to San Martin. On the way we stopped at our friend Basilio Vera, a puestero from the Bruderhof. A puestero is a person who lives on the boundary of an estancia as a sort of ‘watchman’. We had afternoon tea and some food prepared by Basillios wife or compañera, she too made a big exhibit of friendship over me for my blue eyes and blond hair. The food reflected this unreserved affection to me too! After dark we proceeded towards San Martin. Cattle with funny marks on them walk much better in the dark, so I was told! Two big steers had to be slaughtered for some reason before Sunrise? When slaughtering takes place in Paraguay, the vultures let anyone know where some-one is slaughtering, to cattle thieves they are known as: The Judases Of The Sky. There were no problems as regards ‘selling’ all the meat - instead of money paid to his workers.\n\nIn 1956 I left Paraguay for North Dakota U.S.A. Before that time I met and visited Pastor many times. He and his family lived in Puerto Rosario, near the big river Rio Paraguay. I also made friends with his mother, which is very important in Paraguay in validating any friendship for life! I also introduced him to ‘Jopp’ the baker of the Bruderhof. All Paraguayans liked the products of the bakery that he produced. ‘Jopp’ his real name was Joseph Stängel a Bavarian, who had gone through a really good apprenticeship in Bavaria, learning his trade as a baker! Jopp too was stigmatised by many from the Bruderhof, his academic education was very limited, but yet he was a most fantastic baker. Paraguayan baking was most basic to say the least. Jopp really enjoyed eating ‘wild-life’ so when something was ‘hunted’ like armordillos,quatii, iguana or aligator, he would bake it in the large oven, turning it into a delicacy, especially the ‘Waldhüner’! The fat Ipa-ca-a.\n\nMy friend from the day at Campo Triangolo was Pastor Coronel, his friendship served me very well for life, especially after he became the Chief of The Paraguayan Army and Head of the Paraguayan Police in the sixties when Alfredo Strößner was President of Paraguay. Paraguay, a ‘Coca-Cola State’ The U.S.A. demanded a strictly ‘None-Communist Paraguay in the centre of South America preventing another Vietnam?’ By this ‘virtue’ Paraguay’s ‘Government’ received huge amounts of Dollars,\n\nGrants/gifts/aid/bribes call it what you like, in many forms from the U.S.A. State Department and by those conditions Paraguay had to adhere too, a most rigid dictatorship. As a result the Paraguayan currency: the Guarani was the strongest currency in all of Latin America for many years!\n\nIn the sixties I returned to Paraguay on various visits, especially to ‘our’ Tapiracuay River. So many really good childhood memories of mine float on that river! Pastor had become a very power-full personality. He had acquired Tacuatii, an estancia about ten Km away from San Martin. Tacuatii was an estancia one knew about but not visit, in my childhood this was the ‘real’ Wild West, owned by a variety of characters, who never seemed to live very long for some reason? Between Tacuatii and San Martin was Pegua-hó another place of ‘Golgata’ were horrible things happened to some horrible and not so horrible people too? On one of my visits as always enjoying a ride on a beautiful horse in a most beautiful Paraguayan Landscape. It was late afternoon when I came across this ‘gringo’? He was walking all by himself, looking absolutely miserable? I passed him, after about hundred meters I turned went back to him asking him “who are you”? It turned out he was from Arizona, spoke Spanish and was ordered to cultivate a friendship with my friend Pastor Coronel; to him Paraguay was a mere monkey country. He asked me where he could find a place to have a drink, so I told him to take a seat behind me on the horse, what he did. We road to Carolina were ‘Tito’, Hernando Jimenez owned a boliché cum cilombo. A boliché is a drinking establishment in Paraguay and a cilombo a Paraguayan whorehouse. We sat outside in the twilight and talked till long after dark. Tito lent us a horse for the ride back to Tacuatii. Next morning a small plane came and took this yank (lets call him Sam) back to Asunción after he gave me a card with a phone number on it so we can make contact in Asunción.\n\nIn Asunción we met again. The place he directed me too was on the corner of a street called Azara and the Avenida Indepedencia National. This same bar use to be owned by Schorschel, his real name was Emil Wolff a German Jew, his place was used for years by Nazis and Jews who were all involved in ‘business’ and all of them good friends. As a fourteen year old the Bruderhof put me to work in Asunción were they bought a new house in Vulgecio Moreno, they rented a large house in Indepedencia Nationa two doors down from Wolffl. I went to Schorschel’s bar with Alfred a Brother from the Bruderhof who wanted a drink of beer but had no money but I did, so we went together. Soon Schorschel approached me for some ‘business’ in wood turned products that the Bruderhof was selling. That is how I became a good friend of Schorschel. With Jews the key to a good friendship is ‘money’. When I came round to Schorschel’s with wooden ‘articles’ he called me ‘Weihnachtsmann’ and I called him ‘Saujud’.\n\nThis bar had not changed a lot apart from being filthy but still frequented by iffy characters like Sam. Not long after we were at the bar, I was still telling him about Schorschel, when another colleague of his, of the same ilk arrived, obviously ‘arranged’? We met a few times, them trying to get me drunk without success! They spent a lot of money on me, on ‘wining, dining and whoring’, then they offered me a job, infiltrating ‘communist’ organisations in Uruguay, the Tupamaros. Not long before that, the Tupamaros kidnapped and killed two Americans, an Embassy-attaché and an agriculture adviser. I really enjoyed those people although I was a traitor to them. Even the bank hold-up, a very prominent Bank of Uruguay, on the Diez-Y-Ocho de Jullio the main street of Montevideo, nicking a safe from a Swedish Company that broke the back axle of a car was also quite funny and rewarding as far as females were concerned, Uruguay has very beautiful women until their mid thirties. Most Latin American people can’t concentrate for long and hardly ever consider consequences, that was prevalent with the Tupamaros.\n\nAfter my ‘work’ in Uruguay these Americans gave me other ‘jobs’ in other parts of the World but mainly in Latin America, Panama, Colombia, Argentina and Chile. During the Falklands War in 1982 in Patagonia. In Chile I was few times, that led me to having documents from WW2 that some Americans still desperately want to own, especially those of Hugo Bleicher! Three times I walked through the Darién Gap, from Colombia to Panama and got to know ‘Academias Americana’ in the jungles of Panama, the forerunner of Guantanomo Bay under Manuel Noriega. Once I met him personally, to many people known as: Cara-PiñaPineapple Face because of his Small Pox Scares in his face. When Cara-Piña fell, Guantanomo Bay had to be established. In former Yugoslavia I had some good times in the nineties, before that I got to know it quite well when I had a ‘job’ driving busses through to Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. Americans and Israelis are always quite keen to learn about gunrunning in any part of the World? Israelis too had given me ‘jobs’ finding characters in some parts of the World. With my Bruderhof accent nobody can ever guess my Nationality. The Thames Valley Police refer to me with: “you fucking foreigner, fuck off back to your own fucking country you are nothing but a fucking nuisance”. In Puerto Gallegos I was Manfred Peiler with an Argentinean Cedular. From the Israelis I learned a lot about ‘enhanced interrogations’ as it is them who are the best in the World on this subject from my encounters with them in the pursuit of obtaining facts, the most effective are the very simple to apply methods.\n\nOn the eighth of February 1984 a gang of crooks obtained the property next to mine here in Windsor. I own a huge garden here in Windsor, in The Royal Borough land and property are of great interest to most people as The Royal Borough is suppose to be a ‘posh’ place to live? From that day to this I had a lot of ‘problems’ because of these criminals. There were times when I could not live in my house here because of so many threats on my life with knives and firearms. No place in the World have I been, were I was threatened so much by thugs with knives and fir-arms here in Windsor, I was shot at three times and hit once. The only way I survived here in Windsor is because of the support and protection I got from Israelis and Americans both are very keen to learn about movements of gangster’s dealings, gunrunning, drug-dealings, identity fraud, very prevalent in The Royal Borough and how crooks get away with all that, simply by bribing certain ‘elements’ Of The Authorities here in the UK. Even the people from the Town Planning get roped in as these criminals, who command over huge sums of money. Four times I had the windows of my house smashed, car tyres cut, car windows smashed, on Christmas Eve ‘Kristall-Nacht’ was executed, Home Secretary Theresa May and MP for Maidenhead was informed of this fact, Thames Valley Police Officers, who are personally known to her simply let it happen like the Nazis did with the Einsatztruppen, State sponsord hooligans and thuggs. Since February1984 when this crimminal gang aquired the house next to mine, I was arrested eleven time and all the police can accuse me of is: \"you fucking foreigner, why don't you fuck off back to your own fucking country, you are nothing more than a fucking nuisace\" All this because of my Bruderhof Accent that I am proud of! Nobody can ever guess my Nationality, The Bruderhof has given me a great asset in life. The many jobs I had all over the World are all thanks to the Bruderhof, than sadly now is run by a gang of American Gansters, who stop at nothing when it comes to MONEY!\n\nChristmas Eve 2010 I had experienced ‘Kristallnacht’ at my house, soon after I put it in a letter to Theresa May, The Home Secretary and all I got was a reply from some clown calling him/her self: Khaleen Edoo, sounds like a computer creation to me, telling me to write The I.P.C.C. They too have a large file of letters from me complaining about The Thames Valley Police going way back to the time when they were called: The Police Complaint Authority. Some time before that two police officers PC Reynolds 1268 and PC Nash 6319 called well after midnight, getting me out of bed, accusing me of putting rubbish on ‘my’ drive because Mrs Boyle had told them so. Telling me: “We don’t know what you do to her, every time she calls us she is in floods of tears.” When they came my windows were smashed and my house smelt of petrol as earlier the same evening hooligans incited by Mrs Boyle, purred petrol through my letterbox, those two things were of no relevance or consequence what so ever. Unbelievable the power police and criminals have in England. From the onset, February 1984 when the criminals came they had the full support of The Thames Valley Police, Theresa May as the MP for Maidenhead has them all as her personal cronies, what a marvellous arrangement! Theresa May is a really corrupt politician to say the least and some people say Paraguay is corrupt, at the same time; time and again you can see programmes on British TV about corruption in other countries? Two times I was badly beaten up by police, had CS gas sprayed in my face, attacked with a taser gun, in 2005 shortly after going through open heart surgery I was hit by a police car deliberately by PC Andrew King 2892 driving, PC Green was in the same car, they can do as they please! All because of my Bruderhof accent that the British State had imposed on me. Since all this started I had been arrested eleven times, apart from many other abuse the police perpetrated against me. In November five ‘lady’ police officer came to my house and started mauling me about, provoking violence, I lay flat on the ground and one in particular screamed at me: ”Calm down calm down” all this in most public, in the street by my house, exhibiting me as a most violent criminal. As they set about me, pulling and tossing me about, I was seventy years old then, the leader one farted like an old horse, she could not contain herself. They all had their ID numbers not exhibited. One I knew, she is: WPC Tamara Scott. Another one, I did not know, exhibiting no Number, a tall fat blond one who lives in Aylesbury shacked up with another police officer she was the most offensive perpetrator wanting to taunt me into violence. All this is a most blatant persecution by The Thames Valley Police and a cover up for aiding and abetting criminals in a variety of crimes. There is a lot more to all this, some of it very funny and rewarding and educational! ‘We’ also learned how police officers from the UK are cultivated by Russian Oligarchs in exotic places in order to ‘work’ for them in return for ‘pay’ and other rewards. With ‘enhanced’ interrogation many things come to light, this applies to lawyers too. Some simply go ‘missing’ in the UK and nobody cares, let alone asks questions. The corruption in The Royal Borough is no different to any other part of the World. Only because of my Bruderhof background and meeting Pastor Coronel was I able to pursue all this. Not having a ‘partner’ was/is a great asset, at any time I can go anywhere with out having to explain anything to any one!\n\nWhen all this started, my biggest handicap was that I was illiterate. I tried taking the crooks to The Slough County Court; they off course with all their money had excellent lawyers, the case did not even\n\n‘Last’ five minutes, when the judge shouted: “Not relevant to the case, case dismiss.” Those short five minutes cost me over £ 10,000 in an English Court Of Law - that is what I was a British War orphan for! Corruption in The Royal Borough has no bounds, nor pales! I was illiterate to the age of fifty-five. I started going to spelling lessons, with a most excellent teacher Margaret Wall, she taught me how to spell DECEIT and TREACHERY. It was Mr. Michael Trend MP who organised all this for me; he is the most outstanding Englishman in my eyes. No one else has ever done so much for me than Mr. Trend! From the spelling lessons I progressed to G.C.S.E. with Fiona Watson, who introduced me to Shakespeare by studying ‘Othello’ and many other English Literature Works. Mr. Trend had also organised for me to have ‘one to one’ English lessons with Andrew Grey, a most highly skilled teacher of the English Language! Two years he taught me. One year I was doing A Level English and English Literature, also with a most fantastic teacher, his name is Alistair Donaldson, many evenings after every one else had gone home, he taught me alone on aspects of King Lear or the best Literature, Great Expectations, till late into the night. Many characters that Pip had, I had too, especially Magwitch in the form of Fritz Freiburghaus, a Swiss accountant, who was one of the first go betweens as courier of the Swiss Banks and Nazis. For some reason he was kicked out by the Swiss Banks and banished to Paraguay were he worked in a sawmill before he joined the Bruderhof. From Fritz Freiburghaus I got ‘Great Expectations’ documents from Hugo Bleicher and Fritz Schwendt, a Nazi Jewish Swiss Banker, who ‘disappeared’ after WW2. All that and more, still benefits me today. Access to banks in ‘some’ Cantons, who ‘helped’ regarding iffy Crook-Money from the UK, which the ‘British-Taxman’ wanted to know about, was also accomplished through Fritz Freiburghaus?\n\nHad I not had the support of the Israelis or Americans I would have been killed long ago! As I am and live I’m very vulnerable in the UK. As I learned, here in England thousands of people go missing and “nothing can be done” we are told? Especially when it comes to ‘Property Fraud’ and the laxity of Her Majesty’s Land Registry, unbelievable how easy it is in England to falsify a Land Certificate! In England anything can be accomplished with violence, that is why I say today: “Unless You Heard A British Lawyer Or Police Officer Howl In Agony, You Haven’t Got A Clue What English Law Is All About!” Some of them ‘we’ hunted down to the end of The World, ‘we’ can find anyone anywhere. Quite amazing how similar the politics of The Royal Borough is to that of the Bruderhof! “How dare you say John Handcock is corrupt, he worships in Saint Georges Chapel in the Windsor Castle, where the Queen Of England worships Her Self!”? No different to Heini Arnold on the Bruderhof, a most Divine Brother, who preaches The Divine Word Of Jesus Vetter in Gemeindestunde and prays in full unity for the Great Love Of Jesus Vetter, this same ‘creature’ is the one who annaly penetrated me, an orphan on the Bruderhof from when I was seven years old, resulting, blood running down my legs. In 2004 a book was published by The Plough Publishing House of The Bruderhof. The book ‘HOMAGE TO A BROKEN MAN‘ - The Life Of J. Heinrich Arnold. This book has some quite impossible ‘credits’ Heinrich Arnold is the same paedophile who took advantage of me as a orphan in Paraguay, knowing that no one will ever persecute him for his crimes! He use to thrash me mercilessly, while I was working in the tropical heat, while he himself, sat in the shade watching me all the time, a few times I collapsed with ‘heat stroke’ hence my heart operation in 2005. On the credits on the flier goes: “With candor and honesty, Mommsen shares the joy and forgiveness of a Christian community. It is a “breathtaking story, and reads like a novel. I could not put it down.” This clown calls himself Donald Kraybill, author of ‘The Upside Down Kingdom’. Every time I try and read this Heini Book I get physically and mentally sick! Many people who were raised in the tropics, like from the Mennonites people who had heat stroke as children die very early in life, I was lucky, I went to The Brompton Hospital in Chelsea London.\n\nAll this was just a small introduction to the fantastic life that I had on the Bruderhof. The vast majority of members of the Bruderhof were really fantastically good people. Amazing how week the Bruderhof was, that a handful of American Gangsters can come along and destroy the whole set up in England, Paraguay and Uruguay. Many people who through much poverty had built up all those Bruderhof villages in three counties and a most outstanding hospital in Paraguay how easily these criminals destroyed all that and pushed many people out on the welfare State in the twilight of their lives, all on an argument on who stands well with Jesus Vetter. Every one who contributed to the demolishing of the Bruderhof Hospital in Paraguay is a cold-blooded, calculated murderer! With all the rights and wrongs of the Bruderhof, the Hospital always gave it all a Justification."
