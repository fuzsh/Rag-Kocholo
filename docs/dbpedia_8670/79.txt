Famous British actor Sir Michael Caine is celebrating his 91st birthday today.

Born on March 14, 1933, in the old St Olave’s Hospital, Rotherhithe, his family home was in Borough and he attended Wilson’s School in Camberwell.

In 2003, the Oscar, Golden Globe and Bafta-winning actor personally attended the inauguration of his Blue Plaque on the hospital site, as part of the scheme thought up by Southwark News.

Sir Michael was first named Maurice Joseph Micklewhite but adopted the stage name Michael White while treading the boards of Britain’s provincial theatres until the mid-1950s.

When he returned to London, he found there was already a Michael White performing in London so was persuaded to adopt a new name.

Discussing what his new sobriquet could be while talking to his agent from a telephone box in Leicester Square, he looked up at a billboard advertising The Caine Mutiny above the entrance to the Odeon Cinema, Leicester Square.

Being a huge fan of the star Humphrey Bogart, he decided there and then to adopt the surname Caine.

Caine surprised fans during his 90th birthday last year with a snap of him celebrating with Tom Cruise who worked with him in 2002’s Austin Power comedy Goldmember.

David Walliams and Denise Welch were also at the do at the River Cafe in Hammersmith.

In October last year, the movie star announced his retirement saying: “I keep saying I’m going to retire. Well I am now.”

Caine is normally active on X, formerly Twitter, but has been notably quiet over the last month.

His last post was on February 11 when he wrote: “Love Las Vegas, got married there”.
