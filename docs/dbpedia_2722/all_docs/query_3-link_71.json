        "text": "The Crown has returned to Netflix, and with it, we have our new queen, Olivia Colman, playing the actual queen.\n\nIn the third series, the show covers the years 1964 to around 1976 and the inspired-by-real-events plot will cover the Aberfan disaster, Harold Wilson’s time as Prime Minister and Princess Anne’s affair with Roddy Llewellyn.\n\nOne other major plot line will Lord Louis Mountbatten’s apparent coup against Harold Wilson, which features in the fifth episode of the new series and is called “Coup” – but what really happened at this time in history?\n\nHere’s everything you need to know:\n\nWhat did the Harold Wilson government look like?\n\nThe years under Harold Wilson’s premiership saw the abolition of capital punishment and the liberalisation of law on censorship, divorce, abortion, and the decriminalisation of homosexuality. He navigated the UK’s position with America during the Vietnam War, keeping British troops out of the conflict, and at home oversaw social reforms from education to pensions under an increase of income tax for top earners to 83 per cent.\n\nWhat happened in the ‘coup’?\n\nEssentially, in 1968, a newspaper editor and Bank of England director, Cecil King, attempted to persuade Lord Mountbatten to lead a coup d’état against Wilson’s Labour government.\n\nWhat actually took place?\n\nIn Peter Wright’s 1987 book Spycatcher, he claims that Lord Mountbatten met with King in 1968 to discuss displacing Wilson as prime minister and placing Mountbatten in the role instead. According to Wright’s telling of the event, Mountbatten regarded this as treason, so refused to go along with idea.\n\nIn former editor Hugh Cudlipp’s book Walking on Water he also tells a similar story of King being keen to depose Wilson and install an unelected government, headed up by Mountbatten.\n\nKing apparently believed that the country was headed for political and economic collapse, which is why he wanted to put Mountbatten in power.\n\nCudlipp explained King’s thinking in the book as: “A new administration would be urgently required, perhaps a new regime if only for a limited period, dominated by new men or at any rate not by political hacks.\n\n“Parliament, which had dug its own grave, would temporarily lie in it until national dignity and morale were restored. Parliament would remain the legislative chamber but it was futile to look solely to Parliament for the leadership required.”\n\nKing also referred to the idea in his diary and wrote: “Hugh asked him [Mountbatten] if it had been suggested to him that our present style of government might be in for a change. He said it had. Hugh then asked if it had been suggested that he might have some part to play in such a new regime. Mountbatten said it had been suggested, but that he was far too old.”\n\nCudlipp claims that he, King and Mountbatten met on the afternoon of 8 May 1968 at the Lord’s London house on Kinnerton Street, with Sir Solly Zuckerman, Chief Scientific Adviser to the government, also in attendance.\n\nBut when the idea was explained, Mountbatten reportedly turned to Zuckerman and said: “Solly, you haven’t said a word so far. What do you think of all this?”\n\nAccording to Cudlipp: “Sir Solly rose, walked to the door, opened it, and then made this statement: ‘This is rank treachery. All this talk of machine guns at street corners is appalling. I am a public servant and will have nothing to do with it. Nor should you, Dickie,” and then both men excused themselves.\n\nThe plot for a coup never went any further than this conversation, but King – as editor of the Daily Mirror – then published a front page cover calling for and end to Wilson’s government. King was sacked as chairman of the umbrella publishing group, International Publishing Corporation, 21 days later.\n\nIn 1979, Mountbatten was killed by an IRA bomb on his boat."
