        "text": "Netflix’s The Crown does wonders when it comes to sucking its audience back into the patriarchy; the acting, the sets, the costumes all point to pomp and circumstance where women were more ornamental than oratory. But because it’s the royal family, and we’re nothing if not fascinated by them, it doesn’t seem to bother us that Queen Elizabeth’s (Olivia Colman) story is so often dominated by the men around her.\n\nBecause The Crown focuses so much on the queen’s meetings with the prime minister, it might be easy—at least, until Gillian Anderson’s Margaret Thatcher arrives next season—to think there was only one woman in British politics at the middle of the century. But in season three, The Crown at last introduces a powerhouse in 1960s English politics: Marcia Williams (Sinéad Matthews), political secretary to Prime Minister Harold Wilson (Jason Watkins). A scene in episode three might come as an all-out shock with women literally at the table among all the staunch old white men at 10 Downing Street. (Making a few appearances along with Williams is Member of Parliament Barbara Castle, who, at 34 years, was the longest-serving female M.P. until 2007, the year the record was broken.) But unlike Colman’s Elizabeth, who is constitutionally mandated to keep her political opinions to herself, Williams and Castle are depicted as passionate and opinionated, bold female politicians made even bolder by their era.\n\n“She was an incredible figure [in British politics] working in a world surrounded by men,” said Matthews, who plays Williams (later Baroness Falkender, who died in February). Williams served as the prime minister’s private and political secretary from 1956 to 1983. She was perceived as having more influence over him than any other person in his party or life. “He saw personality traits and characteristics in her which he felt he—and the Labour Party—needed,” said Matthews “He didn’t have [those traits]; where he was laid-back, she was fiery.”\n\nThe mining disaster in Aberfan, Wales, which is the prime and solemn focus of episode three, killed 144 people, mostly children. The episode depicts how the tragedy became political, with Wilson’s Labour government unwilling to take the blame for the lax security standards implemented by the previous Tory leaders. So when Wilson reiterates this point, Williams scolds him, persuading him to look to the establishment—represented by the queen—in an attempt to deflect potential negative attention, thus scapegoating Elizabeth. Though it should be noted that, according to the research team, from everything they have read and know, Wilson would not have betrayed the queen’s confidence like that.\n\n“That scene perfectly encapsulates their relationship,” said Matthews. “He doesn’t get angry at her or confrontational [like she is with him]. He listens to her.”\n\nCrown creator and writer Peter Morgan brings in a historical research team 18 months before preproduction begins, creating stacks of facts to back up any dramatic moments Morgan has scripted. “Our job is to start macro and become more micro as the year goes on,” said head of research Annie Sulzberger.\n\nWhen it comes to Williams, she was alongside Wilson nearly every day of their working relationship. But in this instance she happened to have not been with Wilson when he learned of the Aberfan disaster, and thus did not travel there with him, according to the research team. But that did not make it inaccurate to write this scene of the two having an argument (with Williams winning) about their strategic approach to the disaster.\n\n“This [scene] presented itself as such an honest and illustrative depiction of their working relationship,” said Sulzberger, “and a clear motivating factor for sparking this sort of argument.”\n\nWilliams and Wilson’s working relationship was one of the more unique and mysterious partnerships in mid-20th-century English government, and it lasted for more than 20 years. According to Sulzberger and script researcher Daniel Janes, Williams was particularly ambitious in terms of her party’s future. Her run was during a particularly unsettled period in the United Kingdom’s political climate. After 13 years of Tory rule, her ambition wasn’t for her own advancement, though that would have obviously been a byproduct. Instead her ideals and hopes and dreams for the Labour Party far outweighed her own career climb.\n\n“She believed he was going to help return the government to the more socialist, left-leaning policy that she so much believed in,” said Sulzberger.\n\nNews\n\nNikki Haley Wants Her Own Voters to Get Off the Fence—and Back Donald Trump\n\nDuring her Tuesday night speech at the Republican National Convention, Haley addressed her past feud with the former president while giving him her wholehearted support: “You don’t have to agree with Trump 100 percent of the time to vote for him.”\n\nPolitics\n\nTrump Was Totally Not Being Serious When He Suggested He’s Going to Appoint Himself President for Life: Republicans\n\nThis is a guy who loves democracy, after all.\n\nRoyals\n\nThe Trump Shooter Searched a British Royal Prior to Assassination Attempt, Investigators Say\n\nThomas Matthew Crooks’s search history shows his interest in various public figures, including Joe Biden and Merrick Garland, as well as an unnamed member of the British royal family.\n\nPolitics\n\nFox News’ Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum Are in “Heaven” Covering 2024 Chaos\n\nThe anchors talked with Vanity Fair about Biden’s woes, Trump’s relationship with the conservative cable giant, and covering the 2024 election’s nonstop chaos. “It’s like drinking from a fire hose,” Baier said.\n\nPolitics\n\nUnderestimate Kamala Harris at Your Peril\n\nWhy Team Trump is scrambling as the veep has come out swinging.\n\nPolitics\n\n“Shut It Down”: Project 2025 Architects Rail Against the Administrative State Outside Republican National Convention\n\nAt at Monday event in Milwaukee, Heritage Foundation’s top brass bemoaned the “deep state” while attempting to draw (unconvincing) daylight between themselves and Donald Trump. “We’re not running for president,” said the executive director of the project.\n\nPolitics\n\nJoe Biden on J.D. Vance, His Call With Trump, and Why He’s Staying in the Race\n\nIn an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt, the president also said it was a mistake to refer to putting Trump in a bull’s-eye, though defended calling his rival a threat to democracy.\n\nPolitics\n\nDonald Trump’s GOP Acceptance Speech Gives America Whiplash\n\nThe former president, subdued in recounting last week’s assassination attempt, went right back to dishing out MAGA red meat. Despite talk of “unity” at the Republican National Convention, underneath was the same old right-wing agenda.\n\nCelebrity\n\nAmber Rose, Who Started Anti-Rape Culture SlutWalk Protest, Is Now a Full-On MAGA Shill\n\nThe pop culture fixture called Donald Trump “such an idiot” in 2016. At the RNC on Monday, she framed him as the country's only hope.\n\nPolitics\n\nWhere Do the Obamas Stand on Joe Biden? “If President Obama Was All In, He’d Be All In.”\n\nAs the threat of another Trump presidency looms, America turns its eyes to Michelle and Barack Obama, still the most powerful politicians in the world—whether they like it or not."
