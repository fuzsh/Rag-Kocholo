        "meta_description": "The famous detective, Sherlock Holmes, once solved a case by referring to “the dog that did not bark.” In the past 250 years of British history, republicanism is another dog that did not bark. This is particularly true of supposedly our most radical major political party, the Labour Party. Over the monarchy, as over constitutional matters generally, Labour’s instincts have been conservative. Even after 1997, when the party, led by Lord Irvine, has indeed embarked upon major constitutional ref...",

        "text": "3The Independent Labour Party, formed in 1893, a democratic socialist body, was initially republican in sympathies. Its founder, Keir Hardie, was always so. His speech of April 1894 in the Commons, at the time of the birth of a royal grandchild (the future King Edward VIII), condemning the House for finding time to celebrate a royal baby at a time when 251 Welsh miners had been killed in a terrible mining accident at Cilfynydd in south Wales, created a sensation. Hardie had written in his newspaper, the Labour Leader, that “the life of one Welsh miner is of greater commercial and moral value to the British nation than the whole Royal crowd put together, from the Royal Great-Grand-Mama to this puling Royal Great-Grandchild” (Morgan, Keir Hardie 72-3; Labour Leader, 30 June 1894). It gave Hardie a reputation for extremism which lasted for life. It was more damaging for his reputation than his socialism, his feminism or his pacifism. Hardie remained an outspoken republican, a view popular in his Welsh constituency of Merthyr Tydfil, which he represented in the Commons from 1900 to his death in 1915. During the Boer War, Hardie used the crisis further to attack the monarchy, to claim that King Edward VII had financial links with Cecil Rhodes’s mining enterprises in South Africa—“it is no secret that his Majesty has been all along a party to the war gang in South Africa.” He went on to allege that, at the royal funeral in 1901, militarists and their clerical allies had “used the Queen’s dead body as a recruiting sergeant” (Labour Leader, 11 July 190l). In 1907 Hardie and other Labour MPs were denounced for condemning Edward VII’s visit to meet the hated Czar of Russia by sailing up the Baltic in the royal yacht (Morgan, Keir Hardie 258). Hardie said that it meant that the King virtually condoned the atrocities of the Czarist regime in Russia. He continued to attack the King’s privileged and debauched life-style. For his pains, he was excluded from royal garden parties at the Palace—which it is inconceivable that Hardie would ever have attended anyway!\n\n4But the Labour Party generally was most reluctant to follow this lead. After all, virtually all European countries were monarchies or empires anyway prior to 1914. Ramsay MacDonald, leader of the party from 1911 was anxious to show his party as a moderate, constitutional party. After the first world war, when so many imperial dynasties disappeared, MacDonald gave this still further emphasis as a way of showing that Labour was fit to govern. In its entire history, Labour has had only one formal vote on the future of the monarchy, at the 1923 party conference. There, a republican motion produced just fifteen minutes of debate, and was humiliatingly defeated by 3,690,000 votes to 38,000 (Labour Party Conference Report of 1923).\n\n7Tony Blair after 1997 was harder to assess, so pragmatic a politician was he. But his political antennae led him to lead the royal mourning after the death of Diana in Paris in 1997, “the people’s princess” as Blair called her, and to defend the Queen over that crisis, and after as the death of the Queen Mother and the celebration of the royal golden jubilee of 2002. The Queen, Blair excruciatingly announced at a grand banquet, was “simply the best of British,” even a symbol of the alleged “cool Britannia.” When another crisis flared up in late 2002, with the collapsed trial of the former butler of Princess Diana, Paul Burrell, after the Queen surprisingly intervened, Blair was quick to rush in and state that the Queen was totally blameless and the royal prerogative in no way impugned.\n\n8Now why has the Labour Party been so sympathetic to the undemocratic hereditary crown and the royal family? Why has it never come close to embracing Republicanism, unlike, say, the Socialist Party in France or Germany? In part, it is because the monarchy has been surprisingly skilful in identifying itself with a variety of popular movements and aspirations after the first world war. After all, George V was well aware of the terrible fate of his cousin, the Russian Czar, Nicholas II, during the Russian revolution, especially after he refused to allow his cousin refuge in Britain itself (Rose 211). The monarchy variously identified itself with the transition from an empire into a Commonwealth in the years after 1945, with the growth of a multi-ethnic culture in Britain after 1960 (Prince Charles’s Trust has been a significant factor here as have been his efforts to identify with the ideals of the Muslim community), and with pressures for devolution in Scotland and Wales. In a remarkable jubilee pronouncement before the Scottish parliament at Edinburgh in 2002, the Queen warmly commended devolution for Scotland as strengthening the ties of unionism and loyalty that bound Scotland to the United Kingdom. This kind of adaptability has enabled the Crown to deflect criticisms that it is out of date and out of touch. Indeed, it is just conceivable that the current alienation from politicians amongst the British public (intensified by the Iraq crisis in 2003) could reinforce the prestige of the unelected monarchy still further.\n\n10On the other hand, it is clear that the public attitude to the monarchy is far less deferential than in the 1940s and 1950s. There is a marked decline in royal symbolism—far less playing of the national anthem (it has long since ceased to be played at the end of cinema performances or at sport events or concerts, and in Scotland and Wales is actively disliked), while the Union Jack is flown less often by far, and commonly identified with the neo-fascism of the National Front and the working­class supposedly racist supporters of West Ham United football club in the east of London. Since the 1970s, indeed ever since Prince Philip memorably complained that he was so hard up that he could hardly afford to play polo, there has been growing criticism of the style of the Crown—its vast, largely untaxed wealth; its lavish and anti-democratic lifestyle (at least presenting “debs” at Court has disappeared); its social exclusiveness such as the schooling of the royal princes at exclusive private schools such as Eton; its antique modes of speech—such as using “one” instead of “I”—and curious forms of pronunciation, its obviously undemocratic character. The spectacle of an anxious, uneasy Queen looking in at a pub or having tea with the tenant of a Glasgow council house provoked widespread ridicule. The satire directed against the royal family has become a major industry with Fergie, Sophie, Edward “count of Wessex,” various Spencers, and other baroque personalities simply figures of fun. There was scant public sympathy for the death of the unpopular Princess Margaret, commonly regarded as the “guest from hell” in social habits. And yet when my parents were told on their wedding day, 21 August 1930, that a little princess had just been born, it was said by their friends to be a sign of almost divine blessing!\n\n11The monarchy went through a dreadful period in the 1990s from the annus horribilis of 1992 with the memorable fire at Windsor, the long running tragicomedy of Charles and Diana, their divorce added to the divorces of Prince Andrew and Princess Anne and other misfortunes. It was hard to identify the British monarchy any longer with the cherished “family values” of George V or George VI or indeed the young Elizabeth II, when the royal family was perhaps as dysfunctional as any in the land. The jubilee of 2002 seemed to go quite well, with a popular rock concert at the Palace, until the Paul Burrell case and various other financial apparent scandals associated with Prince Charles’s household led to a further decline in esteem. What the current inquiry by Sir Michael Peat into the running of Prince Charles’s affairs will reveal remains to be seen. The newspapers forecast (9 March 2003) that, since it was conducted by a royal employee, it would just be another whitewash and carry no authority.\n\n13But the other reason why the monarchy has met with such limited criticism in Labour circles is simply that Labour has never seen republicanism as one of its priorities. None of its political philosophers has raised the issue since Harold Laski did so in 1932-3. Democratic socialism has been concerned with social and economic change rather than with institutional transformation, with issues of class not of hierarchical status. Labour has sought power—“la conquête du pouvoir” in Léon Blum’s vivid phrase—but within the existing framework and sense of national identity. The brief anti­monarchism of post-1931 soon passed away. The supposedly radical Army Bureau of Current Affairs during the second world war, which was conducted for troops serving at the front, in the deserts of Africa or the jungles of Burma, lauded the concept of “The Queen in Parliament.” That was the basis of our liberties, and it was what we were fighting for. There were only isolated rebels in parliament like the Scotsman, Willie Hamilton; there was just one dissentient in June 2002 in the Scottish parliament when a loyal address was presented to the Queen—he was the Independent Socialist, Tommy Sheridan. The Labour MPs probably include now many dozens of republicans (they are rumoured to include such ministers as John Prescott and Clare Short). To my personal knowledge, at least 20 Labour peers are members of a republican group, led by Lord (Jack) Dormand. But the issue is most unlikely to be raised publicly for many years.\n\n14I am currently chairing the Fabian Society Commission on the monarchy (due to report in late April 2003). It is an unusual body since the Crown is never publicly discussed in parliament or in the courts. We do not have royal commissions on the monarchy; its precise influence and key aspects of its role and its finances are unknown. Our Commission is looking variously at the political legal roles of the monarchy and the royal prerogative, its relationship to the established church of England, the Crown’s finances and property, and its social exclusiveness. We will try disentangle various themes that are too often confused—the constitutional role of the monarchy, the legal role of the Crown and the social and personal role of the Queen and royal family as individuals.\n\n15But we will not advocate a republic (a topic on which our ten members have different views). Our themes will rather lead to different possible conclusions. First there will be a critique of the royal prerogative in government (exercised in effect by the prime minister, notably in the right to declare war, as in the case of Iraq). This will, perhaps, be more a critique of the premiership than of the Crown. It will merge into a wider discussion of the general theme of centralization, unaccountability and secrecy in the pragmatic British governmental system, rather than of the monarchy. There will be discussion of the merits of a bill of rights and of a written constitution. Secondly, there will be a critique of the social detachment of the monarchy (going far beyond such issues as fox-hunting or polo), but also balanced against the clear awareness that, historically, the monarchy has been a powerful social glue, giving Britain an historic continuity since the seventeenth century, not known in France or other European countries. Until October 2002, opinion polls showed that a much more democratised monarchy was the most popular opinion. A republic was supported by only around 10­15 per cent, even amongst the young. At a time of doubt about the future of the United Kingdom and the endurance of the British identity—with the various changes implied by a multi-ethnic and multi­faith society, a transatlantic imported culture, membership of the European Union, and Celtic devolution at home—monarchy, even though much weaker than earlier, remains a point of continuity and perhaps of stability.\n\n16In the immediate future, therefore, republicanism is nowhere on our political agenda. But you should never say never in this unpredictable life. The United Kingdom has gone through tumultuous changes in recent decades since 1945, and continues to do so. It is not inconceivable at all that, some time in the coming years, the established Church, the pound sterling and even the monarchy could follow the Empire and the Union into the dustbin of history."
