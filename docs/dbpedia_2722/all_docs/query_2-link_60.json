        "text": "LONDON, Oct. 16 — One weekend 40 years ago, an industrial chemist from Huddersfield in England's grimy north took his son to London to see the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley.\n\nIt was the kind of trip many fathers were taking, but Herbert Wilson, the chemist, and his 8‐year‐old son Harold, were to make this one memorable. After a few hours at the exhibition — the world's fair of its era—the Wilsons strolled through Parliament Square, down Whitehall and eventually into Downing Street.\n\nThere, Herbert Wilson decided to take a photograph of Harold in a dramatic setting, so he posed the boy on the doorstep of No. 10, the Prime Minister's residence.\n\nThis photograph, showing a confident Harold on the threshold of power and fame—dressed in short trousers, schoolboy's jacket and cloth cap—has become familiar to millions of Britons. Today Britain realized that it was prophetic.\n\nWith the Labor party's victory in the general election, James Harold Wilson will be moving beyond the step at No. 10 and into the Prime Minister's office.\n\nAlthough Britain's new leader, born March 11, 1916, is one of the youngest men to become Prime Minister, his rise to power has been neither sudden nor surprising.\n\nHis father, now 81, handed down a political inheritance no less vigorous for its middle‐class origins than those of the famous and aristocratic families that have traditionally ruled Britain.\n\n“Blame me for his politics,” Herbert Wilson once said of his son. Some are inclined to do so, and to trace to the father another Wilson characteristic — a delight and a facility with facts, dates and figures. The retired chemist, for example, still enjoys squaring a guest's telephone number and then finding its square root.\n\nThe Labor leader's facility with facts was noted long before he got into politics. Recalling his scholarship, his Huddersfield headmaster said, “There was never anyone to touch him.” At Wirral Grammar School in Cheshire, where the Wilsons moved when Harold was 14, people talked for years of his “amazing memory.”\n\nYoung Wilson won a history scholarship to Oxford but, after consulting with his father, transferred from history to “modern greats”: philosophy, politics and economics. He won a first‐class degree, one of the highest ever awarded at Oxford, after scoring the equivalent of 17 A's in 18 examinations. His own tutor gave him a B‐plus.\n\nAfter a series of wartime desk jobs, Mr. Wilson was swept into the Commons in 1945 in the Labor landslide that ousted Winston Churchill. He represented Ormskirk, near Liverpool. Two years later, he became the youngest Cabinet member in a century, President of the Board of Trade at 31.\n\nMr. Wilson's friends argue that he could have stepped up the political ladder more surely if he had acted with his colleagues in Parliament. Instead, he frequently took unexpected and unorthodox steps. His critics say these were motivated not by principle but by opportunism.\n\nThe first such move came in 1951, just before Labor lost the election, when Mr. Wilson resigned from the Government with Aneurin Bevan, then Minister of Labor, causing a sensation. They quit in a fight over imposing extra national health charges to meet high rearmament costs imposed by the Korean war.\n\nMr. Bevan, to whom it was an emotional matter, objected to the charges. Mr. Wilson, to whom it was more a technical matter, disagreed with the cost of the military policy.\n\nIn any event, Mr. Wilson became associated with the party's left wing, headed by Mr. Bevan, but remained on its fringe and refused to be called a Bevanite. “I'm just a co‐belligerent, not an ally, he said.\n\nBy 1954, Mr. Wilson was back in the party's good graces. When Mr. Bevan, who had been restored to the shadow cabinet, quit again over foreign policy, Mr. Wilson was offered the post. He took it. Party leftists called it a sellout.\n\nIn 1955, after another defeat, the party began a move Hugh youth. ugh Gaitskell assumed the leadership. In 1960, Mr. Wilson challenged a politically weakened Mr. Gaitskell for the leadership, a move he described later as “the most difficult and upsetting” in his political life. Mr. Wilson lost the bid, and it was to earn him the distrust of party members who saw Mr. Wilson as a man constantly seeking the point of political balance and perching on it.\n\nIn 1962, Mr. Wilson fought George Brown, a party regular who was the trade unions' favorite, for the deputy leadership, and failed again. But the next year, after Mr. Gaitskell's death, Mr. Wilson defeated Mr. Brown and became the party's leader.\n\nThe leader confounded his critics by uniting the divided factions of the party and bringing it into the 1964 election more unified than were the Conservatives. The campaign strategy was Mr. Wilson's, emphasizing a. call to modernize Britain and seeking support for a radical government.\n\nThe Labor leader became identified as the exact opposite of the traditional political amateur, epitomized by the Conservative Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas‐Home. The Tories disparaged Mr. Wilson's “slide‐rule approach,” but he made capital of the comparison, recalling Sir Alec's earlier admission that he used matchsticks to work out economic problems.\n\nMr. Wilson has few political intimates. Shortly after being elected party leader he told a group of unsympathetic Laborites that they “should not be disappointed at not being asked to dinner” because “nobody is being asked to dinner.”\n\nThis forthright, frequently caustic approach to politics has been a Wilson trademark, along with a biting sense of humor that could make him the most quoted prime minister since Churchill.\n\nHe has been called the Mort Sahl of the House of Commons. It was Mr. Wilson who said, for example, that when Harold Macmillan, the former Conservative Prime Minister, landed at London Airport, R. A. Butler, one of his chief deputies, went forward and gripped him warmly by the throat.\n\nMr. Wilson is a chubby pipe smoker with a round face that has been called “cherrystone smooth.” He stands a few inches under 6 feet and lives in a modest semidetached house in Hampstead Garden, a middle‐class London suburb. He drives a Ford automobile, buys his suits off the rack and dislikes parties.\n\nHe married Mary Baldwin, a stenographer, in 1940. A friend at Oxford said she had been surprised when Mary said she was marrying an Oxford Don, “because she looked only, about 15.”\n\n“One day her husband came to coffee, too,” the friend added, “and he looked about 13.”\n\nThe Wilsons have two sons—Robin, who is 21 and studying at Oxford on a state scholarship, and Giles, 16, who attends the University College. School at Hampstead.\n\nMary Wilson has accompanied her husband on his campaign trips, but she is not fond of political life. “I always go to hear Harold speak,” she said once, “but I don't enjoy a good row in the House as some people do. It makes me curl up. I hate to see anyone at bay.”\n\n“When he comes home after a bad day,” Mrs. Wilson added, “I say, ‘Why don't you go back to Oxford?’ I lie awake worrying, but he can go right to sleep.”"
