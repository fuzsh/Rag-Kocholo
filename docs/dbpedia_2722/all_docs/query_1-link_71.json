He is pictured in the sitting-room of his small, eighteenth-century house.\n\n‘Sir Harold asked if he might use his pipe’, said Schwartz. ‘I replied that by all means I hoped he would. We entered into a deep discussion concerning manufacturing, and before long he was puffing with vigour. I was somewhat afraid that too much smoke would spoil the portrait. Happily, I did not ask him to stop.’"
