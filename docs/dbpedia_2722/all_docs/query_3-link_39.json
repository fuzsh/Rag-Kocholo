        "text": "When, 50 years ago, on 14 February 1963, Harold Wilson was elected leader of the Labour party, even many of his supporters – wrongly I now believe – thought him a politician without principle.\n\nWilson had endorsed Aneurin Bevan's denunciation of the American-led South East Asia Treaty Organisation, and then – when his hero had resigned from the frontbench in protest – taken the vacant place in the shadow cabinet. He had supported the Nato nuclear alliance, but when Hugh Gaitskell promised to \"fight and fight again\" to save Labour from unilateralism, Wilson had challenged him for the leadership on the grounds that party opinion must be respected. There was a rational justification for both decisions. But, in the emotional hothouse of the parliamentary Labour party, reason took second place to visceral loyalty.\n\nThe suspicion of dishonesty was increased by Wilson's publicised lifestyle. No one doubted his intellectual distinction, but his professed love of HP Sauce – like his enthusiasm for tinned, rather than smoked, salmon – seemed hard to reconcile with his years of dinners at Oxford high tables.\n\nWilson came from behind to win because of the belated recognition that his character weaknesses were less of a liability than the fatal flaws of his chief rival. George Brown – brilliant and mercurial – was an alcoholic and a bully. While Wilson ran an emollient campaign, Brown attempted to intimidate. MPs who shared Brown's \"moderate views\" could not bring themselves to give him their vote. Tony Crosland nominated Jim Callaghan as the alternative candidate of the \"revisionist right\". He was not, he said, prepared \"to choose between a crook and a drunk\". When Callaghan was knocked out on the first ballot, he chose the crook.\n\nThere were times, even during my first few months in parliament, when I should have recognised a politician of principle. During the early weeks of 1965, with Wilson now in No 10, I was among a group of backbench MPs who, impelled by the impertinence of youth, obtained audience with the prime minister in order to tell him the government should have devalued the pound. At first, he did not try to rebut our economic arguments, but relied on nonsense about Britain's standing in the world. Then he came to aggressive life. Sterling was a reserve currency, he said. India held sterling balances in London. He was not – not – prepared to reduce the value of funds desperately needed by the developing world. Back in 1951, Wilson had founded War on Want.\n\nThe prevailing view that Wilson was shifty was too strongly, and too widely held for me to resist. In the summer of 1961 – at the height of the unilateralist dispute – Dick Crossman, Oxford don and Bevanite, came to Sheffield to inspect our new housing development. I was deputed to show him round. After a quarter of an hour at the now famous Park Hill flats, he demanded to be taken to Burbage Moor on the city boundary. For the first 10 minutes of our walk he denounced Gaitskell – unacceptable as Labour leader because of his enthusiasm for ballroom dancing. For the rest of the two hours he excoriated Wilson for rather more serious character flaws, including duplicity and treachery. Eighteen months later, he claimed to be the manager of Wilson's leadership campaign.\n\nWilson's victory was welcomed by a wave of press enthusiasm which subsequent, cheap denigration – \"George Brown drunk is a better man than Harold Wilson sober\" – obliterated from the public memory. The Financial Times commended his \"intellectual ability, experience, political acumen and cool toughness\". Even the Daily Telegraph wrote in praise of his \"plain living and high thinking … the profound side to his speeches\" and his \"youthful bubbly quality\". And the public seemed to think the same. Labour's Gallup poll lead increased from 13% to 20%, Wilson's personal approval rating was 19% (compared with Gaitskell's 7%) and 64% of the sampled public described him as \"likable\". Only 7% disagreed.\n\nInevitably, the critics made their formal peace with the new leader, but privately continued to express their doubts – as Wilson himself described it – \"behind cupped hands\". It was a mark of their ingratitude, for when he formed a government, he treated them with remarkable generosity. Brown was made first secretary of state. Patrick Gordon Walker – who had boasted to me that although he lived within half a mile of the Wilsons in Hampstead Garden Suburb, he \"never had them in the house\" – became foreign secretary even though he lost his seat at Smethwick and was allowed to remain in office until he lost again in the Leyton byelection. Ten other Gaitskellites served in Wilson's first cabinet. Crosland and Roy Jenkins were given middle-ranking jobs with promises of swift preferment. Crosland filled the first cabinet vacancy. Jenkins leapt from minister of aviation to home secretary.\n\nTheir ingratitude was regularly exhibited at monthly meetings of the 1963 Club, where members conducted themselves very much as Bourbon émigrés behaved after the French revolution. Nostalgia for the glories of the previous regime was matched by fantasies about the prospect of recreating its splendour. Crosland left one dinner with the announcement that he might be prepared to discuss deposing Wilson if any of the advocates of rebellion had the slightest intention of putting their wild schemes into practice.\n\nWilson exploited the loose talk of conspiracy to help convince the Labour left that, despite their disappointments, they must protect him from the right. But occasionally he was persuaded that real plots had been hatched. One day in the summer of 1966, George Wigg MP – paymaster general and the prime minister's nark – confronted me with the news that he \"knew where I had been last Saturday\" and that the plot, that I had helped to hatch in a Kent country house, would come to nothing. In fact, I had been watching the final of the World Cup – an event that had escaped Colonel Wigg's attention.\n\nBy then I had become an object of deep suspicion and unyielding hostility. At the time, I blamed Wilson's displeasure on an episode of pure grand guignol that originated at my first meeting of the 1963 Club. Members had discussed the renationalisation of steel, a policy that everyone except me thought a waste of parliamentary time. I had no doubts that it was an incompetent cartel and said so. The dinner ended when it was time to vote and, as I pushed my way through the crowded division lobby, the unmistakable, plummy, voice of Woodrow Wyatt (then a Labour MP) rang out above the buzz of conversation. \"You should have heard this chap Hattersley. Perfect parody. Just the right accent. All the usual twaddle about accountability. It could have been the little man.\" The idea that I was expressing my real opinion in my normal (Yorkshire) voice had never passed through his head.\n\nBy 1968, I was high on the list of public enemies. Crossman, by then secretary of state for health and social security, was in need of a minister of state and offered me the job. At the shadow cabinet's dinner, which marked the end of Neil Kinnock's leadership and my nine years as deputy, Gerald Kaufman, once Wilson's press secretary, included in his eulogy an explanation of what went wrong. Crossman, in need of a minister of state, had proposed my name to the prime minister. Marcia Williams, Wilson's influential political secretary. Williams had suggested a number of other names – all of which Crossman dismissed. In desperation, she proposed a peer, the undoubtedly able Lady Serota. \"But, I know nothing about her,\" Wilson had said and Williams had replied: \"You know she is not Roy Hattersley.\" Not being me was qualification enough the secure Lady Serota's appointment.\n\nDuring the next eight years, I gave regular cause for offence by exhibiting my admiration for Jenkins and (combined with immense affection) Crosland. And I was regularly punished. On the eve of the last reshuffle before his resignation in 1976, Wilson – having noted the press speculation that I was to become secretary of state for Northern Ireland – stopped me to say that when promotion was on hand it was \"better to have one prime minister on your side than six newspapers\". He was right about that but – infinitely more important – right about far more than I was willing to concede at the time.\n\nHis second government was not a great success, but his first saw Britain through the troubled economic times that it inherited. He kept Britain out of Vietnam, despite dependency on the dollar, and avoided Labour tearing itself apart over Britain's future in Europe – a trick David Cameron has tried to duplicate without much success. During his premiership, capital punishment was abolished, homosexuality was decriminalised and abortion law relaxed. He takes the credit for the social reforms initiated by his ministers in the 1960s, just as Gladstone takes credit for the social reforms of the 1860s.\n\nUnlike Jenkins, Wilson was not a natural libertarian. Nor was he, like Crosland, a genuine egalitarian. And, despite the brilliance of his House of Commons performances, he lacked their elan. He was what used to be called \"a good Labour man\" – instinctively the enemy of privilege and certain that improvement in the lives of the disadvantaged and the dispossessed depended on the success of the Labour party. That is why he worked so hard, and sometimes deviously, to keep it united. I should have understood that 50 years ago."
