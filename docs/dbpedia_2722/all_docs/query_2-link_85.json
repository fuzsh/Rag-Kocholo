        "text": "Description\n\nAn exclusive limited edition photograph by Photojournalist Arthur Steel.\n\nThe British Prime Minister Harold Wilson (Labour) seated at his desk accompanied by Lowry’s ‘Lancashire Fair: Good Friday Daisy Nook (1946)’ painting hanging behind him; along with a portrait of the former British Prime Minister Lord Attlee.\n\nArthur recalls: “I’d photographed Wilson on many occasions and whenever he was out of the public eye he would smoke cigar’s. As soon as camera’s appeared the cigar would be put out and he’d start smoking a pipe. It was all about image, I also remember that he insisted on wearing a Gannex waterproof overcoat whenever he was photographed outside.”\n\n✓ Exceptionally rare limited edition photograph.\n\n✓ Direct from the Artist.\n\n✓ Non licensable images.\n\n✓ Printed by Metro Imaging.\n\n✓ Hand signed by Arthur Steel.\n\n✓ Video of Arthur Steel signing your print(s).\n\n✓ Certificate of Authenticity.\n\n✓ Free worldwide delivery.\n\n✓ Tracked & signed for delivery.\n\n✓ Paypal Pro protection.\n\n✓ Secure SSL payment protection.\n\n✓ 14 day money back guarantee.\n\n✓ Excellent customer care and service.\n\nBlack & White Film Grain:\n\nArthur’s photographs were all captured on 35mm film, a fast medium grain film called ‘Kodak Tri-x Pan’ with an ISO speed of 400. It enabled photojournalists at the time to shoot in relatively low light conditions. Nowadays, we are used to grainless images even at an iso of 800 and above. The grain effect adds to the character and charm of the images and dates the pieces accordingly. Arthur’s images cannot to be compared to todays grainless digital technology.\n\nSigned prints Vs. Unsigned prints:\n\nMost artists sign their prints at the bottom right corner of the piece. By signing a print, the artist approves it, and, claims it as his or her own work. Signatures count for a lot on the print market since they add to the artwork’s authenticity. The value of a signed print is higher than the value of an unsigned print, so if you have a choice, it’s always better to acquire signed prints.\n\nLimited editions Vs. Open editions:\n\nAs a rule limited edition prints are valued more highly and therefore are priced higher than the readily available open edition prints. Also, limited edition prints are collectible, which is not the case for open edition prints. Due to their scarcity, limited edition prints are prized, and collectors and art lovers will seek to create a collection of the same.\n\nCamera: Leica 35mm.\n\nFilm stock: Kodak Tri-X Pan.\n\nLocation: No.10, Downing Street, London.\n\nYear: 1969.\n\nCollection: Gold.\n\nPrint Type: Fibre-based Harman Galerie FB Digital.\n\nPrinted by: Metro Imaging.\n\nLimited Editions:\n\nAll prints are limited editions, no further prints are produced once sold.\n\n50″ prints / edition of 10\n\n40″ prints / edition of 20\n\n30″ prints / edition of 30\n\n20″ prints / edition of 30\n\n12″ prints / edition of 30\n\nBespoke: All prints are bespoke and printed to order.\n\nPresentation: 12 and 20 inch prints are titled, numbered, signed and carefully enfolded in acid free tissue paper, supplied flat in an acid free 4mm 3-ply box for delivery and storage purposes. The boxes are ideal for gift wrapping. The larger 30, 40, 50 and 60 inch prints are also titled, numbered, signed and carefully enfolded in acid free tissue paper and inserted into a rigid 4mm thick protective cardboard tube for delivery.\n\nOptional Dry Mounting for clients within the UK: Professional Dry Mounting of the larger print sizes can be arranged at no extra cost, the print would then be perfectly flat and ready for framing. However, this makes the overall size bulky and too fragile to send overseas. So, if you reside abroad, it is best that we send a rolled print directly to your chosen framer and you entrust them to carry out the works for you. We recommend that you check that your framer is fully insured as we cannot take responsibility for any damages that may occur during the mounting/framing process.\n\nDelivery: Metro Imaging based in Central London use an experienced shipping service to deliver the boxed and rolled prints. Metro take great care in ensuring the print(s) are very well protected and efficiently delivered anywhere in the UK or overseas. Acid free tissue paper protects prints from scratching/creasing. Metro also offer a vast array of delivery options to suit the recipient’s preference.\n\nCertificate of Authenticity: Each print acquired from The Arthur Steel Archive is accompanied by an individually signed Certificate of Authenticity.\n\nVideo of Authenticity: Newly printed bespoke prints are further authenticated by way of a short personalised video. Arthur Steel mentions your name on the recording prior to signing. For example, Arthur will say something like: “I’m signing this print of Harold Wilson, edition number 2/20 for Mr. Smith in New York.” For your records, the footage is then sent to you via email.\n\nWatermark: Watermarks will not be present on an original print.\n\nCopyright: © Arthur Steel / The Arthur Steel Archive."
