They've been living together since 1977.

The revelation cam about when the Bild reporter asked the actor what the secret was to a long-lasting relationship without a marriage certificate.

'We are married. Just recently," said Rickman. "It was great, because no one was there. After the wedding in New York we walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and ate lunch."
