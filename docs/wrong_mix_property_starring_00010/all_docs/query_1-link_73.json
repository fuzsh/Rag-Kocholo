        "text": "Family\n\nAbout Alan\n\nBiography\n\nRima Elizabeth Horton was born in a Paddington hospital near her childhood residence, 31, Bark Place, Bayswater, west London. She is the middle child from a working-class family of Labour voters, the daughter of Elice Irene \"Elsie\" (nee Frame) and Wilfred Stewart George Horton, the second youngest of an older brother, an older sister and a younger brother as well as an older half-brother, R. W. A. (b. 1931-d. 1992) and M. J. Horton (b. 1934) from her father's July 1929 marriage to Gwendoline M. W. (b. 1909-d. 2002) (General Register Office; Reg. no. ESE6, Entry no. 117; Vol. 1D 2740; Vol. 1d 1143; Vol. 2a 617; Vol. 5D 406; Vol. 11 970;). Through her husband, Alan Rickman whom she wed in 2012 in New York City, her nieces are Sarah M. Hodges (nee Rickman) and sisters, Claire L. and Amelia M. M. \"Amy\" I.\n\nHer mother was of Welsh ancestry, born in July 1906 in Upper Norwood, Surrey (Vol. 2A 337) to a domestic servant, \"Kate\" Frame (b. 1883 in Aberdare, Mid Glamorgan, Wales), an occupation she held since 18 (Vol. 11A 507). Her father, on the other hand, was English, born in September 1905 in Fulham (Vol. 1A 211). His mother, \"Emily\" D. (b. Jan. 1871-d. Jun. 1967) was also a domestic servant, left completely orphaned as a child and to be largely raised by her older brother, uncle and aunt (1881 England Census 4; 1891 England Census 13). Rima's parents wed circa March 1929 in Hammersmith (Vol. 1A 472). Her mother died in January 1984, aged 77 (Vol. 12 1804) while her father passed in February 2003, aged 97 (Reg. no. 6B 494; 1B 5).\n\nShe attended St. Vincent de Paul in Holland Park Avenue, a girl-only, non-Catholic primary school, which was run by Mrs Reid and Mrs Branley and had only 40 pupils at that time (Daily Entertainment News; Owoseje; Unofficial).\n\nAfter graduating from primary and secondary school, she studied at the Chelsea College of Art and Design (now called Chelsea College of Arts), where she would meet Rickman, then a budding actor. The couple started dating when she was 18 and he was 19. Although they had been living together since 1977, they never felt the need to make their relationship official in the eyes of the law until 2012, when they wed in a secret ceremony in New York City (Daily Entertainment News; Owoseje; Unofficial).\n\nCitations\n\n1891 England Census.
