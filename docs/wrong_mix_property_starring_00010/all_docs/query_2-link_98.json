        "text": "Like many actors and artists, Alan Rickman is a complex mix of passions and personality. He talks about his love and respect for writing, and the insecurity and self-criticism that so many creative people experience.\n\nHe has portrayed many powerful and intriguing characters, including Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series. In this video about Deathly Hallows: Part 2, he acknowledges author J.K. Rowling for “laying out such a kind of sure roadmap” with her writing of Snape. “You know what’s right and what’s wrong.”\n\nLoving the language\n\nIn his article Alan Rickman: Truly, deeply appealing (Los Angeles Times, November 20, 2011), Patrick Pacheco says “What really excites Rickman is the English language.”\n\n“It’s so rich and cruel and beautiful, like a fireworks display, and yet it can be so subtle and so crude,” says the 65-year-old classical actor and director. “Marry that to the stage and something mysterious happens. Don’t ask me what. It’s magical.”\n\nHe is currently playing Leonard, “the caustic and embittered novelist at the center of Theresa Rebeck’s new play, ‘Seminar,’ on Broadway.\n\n“Theresa’s writing is incredibly demanding,” he says in silky tones that belie his British working-class roots. “She’s like a Restoration comedy writer. It’s high style. The words are extremely well chosen, and sometimes you wish that word had not been chosen right next to that word because the equipment’s a bit rusty.” …\n\nThe article continues:\n\n“I can only see my limitations,” he says with a resigned laugh. “That’s just who I am. I was working with [director] Peter Brook once on Shakespeare’s ‘Antony and Cleopatra’ with Glenda Jackson, and he said, ‘The thing is, you’ll never be as good as the text.’ And that came as a kind of relief, really. I’m fascinated by my friends in the acting profession who can’t wait to get out there. I’m not on that list.”\n\nRickman’s wry insecurity is all the more surprising given his professional image as an assured, sexy and often enigmatic figure with a penetrating gaze and the ability to deliver the most innocuous phrase with sneering contempt. “I don’t see it at all like that. They [his characters] are just people to me,” Rickman says. “I’m a lot less serious than people think.”\n\nSam Gold, the director of “Seminar,” says: “Alan obviously has the ability to play imposing and intimidating characters, but what makes him special is his deep, deep well of empathy. You see the humanity.”\n\nEmma Thompson wrote in an email that during her frequent collaborations with Rickman, “It’s very difficult not to giggle, we laugh a lot, often in the wrong places.” Their most recent one is the BBC teleplay “The Song of Lunch,” which aired recently on PBS, in which Rickman plays an alcoholic poet trying to rekindle a love affair.\n\nThe actress, who wrote the Oscar-winning screenplay for “Sense and Sensibility” and starred with Rickman in that movie, noted that his performance in that film as Col. Brandon “… was everything I wanted for the role — virile yet sensitive, powerful yet quietly, slightly dangerous and miles more interesting than he is in the book…. There’s no one like Alan for a rich, mysterious inner life.” …\n\nBut whether he is playing Hans Gruber, Le Vicomte de Valmont, Severus Snape or John Gabriel Borkman, Rickman sees his primary duty as that of “storyteller.”\n\n“I suppose with any good writing and interesting characters, you can have that awfully overused word” — here he pauses before adding with a roll of the eyes — “a jouuuuuurney.\n\n“It might not be great, it might not be perfect, but it does answer the human need to sit there together and to be told a story.”\n\nRickman discovered just how powerful a story can be with the Harry Potter films.\n\nHe’s especially grateful for their youthful following. “I suppose if I plan to work well into my 80s, I’ll need them,” he quips.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe, the movies’ Harry Potter, is now appearing on Broadway in “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.” He calls Rickman “an invaluable and incredibly generous” mentor.\n\n“When I first met Alan, I was completely intimidated by him,” he says. “We had some very intense scenes together. At times, he’d actually scare me. But while he was always so strong and powerful, I also came to know him as self-deprecating, vulnerable and silly.”\n\nWatching him onstage, says Radcliffe, is to see a “virtuoso” in action. “He’s taught me that acting onstage demands a ruthless honesty, listening very carefully in a way that you lose your self-consciousness. When I was in ‘Equus,’ Alan actually cut short a vacation in Canada to return to see me for a second time and then took me out and gave me some simple, practical and yet profound advice. I’ve a very self-effacing attitude toward what I do, probably from a place of guilt for having so much success so young, but Alan has a deeply felt respect for the importance of acting.”\n\nRickman says the Potter epic provided a novel acting challenge. “It was tricky, because only three of the books had been written when we started. Though I had a clue about what his final story might be, it was only the smallest clue, and therefore there was a sense of playing two things at once, just in case you have to shift. ” Asked whether he was happy with the evolution of his character, Rickman said he thought that “Potter” author J.K. Rowling got it “dead right.”\n\nNow, he is looking forward to the release of the comic film caper “Gambit,” in which he costars with Cameron Diaz and Colin Firth. “God knows, we put ourselves out on the line with that, comedically,” he says a bit nervously. “It’ll be interesting to see how that turns out on the screen.”\n\nHe hopes to do more comedy, seeing the ridiculous as a reflection of the human condition. “I think there should be laughs in everything,” he says. “Sometimes, it’s a slammed door, a pie in the face or just a recognition of our frailties.”\n\nFor Rickman, it’s all part of the job description. The accompanying fame, money and acclaim all strike him as rather “obscene.”\n\n“Our abilities are nothing we can really take credit for,” he says. “Yes, there’s training. But I’ve worked with some great actors who didn’t train at all. You do your job, push your abilities as far as you can take them and hopefully, you can actually do something with this” — here he again pauses before adding — “this accident.”\n\nThat’s an appealing thought, isn’t it? – “Push your abilities as far as you can take them.”\n\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\nVisited 262 times, 1 visit(s) today\n\nø ø ø ø"
