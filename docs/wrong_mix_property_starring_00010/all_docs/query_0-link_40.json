        "text": "On Saturday night, director Richard Curtis and his family went to see a midnight screening of his film, Love Actually. His partner Emma Freud said it was the first time Curtis was seeing the movie in a cinema since the premiere in 2003.\n\nFreud, who was a script editor for the film written and directed by Curtis, live-tweeted the viewing that had only four other people in the audience. Her tweets provided insights into different plotlines and scenes in the movie, the biggest one being what happened with Karen (Emma Thompson) and Harry’s (Alan Rickman) relationship at the end of the film.\n\nIn the movie, Harry cheats on Karen with his secretary Mia.
