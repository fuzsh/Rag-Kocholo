        "text": "By Mark Naglazas – The West Australian; Via Georgiana, Alan Rickman Guestbook\n\nThere is a lot more to veteran stage and screen actor Alan Rickman than playing villains. He spoke to Mark Naglazas.\n\nWhen I was told that my interview with Alan Rickman would take place only hours after the local critics preview of Die Hard 4.0, I let rip with a little “Yippy-ky-yay, mother”.\n\nRickman made his big-screen debut playing the hyper-articulate uber-villain Hans Gruber in the first Die Hard flick, giving a performance of such scene-sucking Shakespearean relish that it both made him a star and defined his entire career.\n\nIndeed, Rickman was so good as the terrorist-turned-bank robber who taunted Bruce Willis blue-collar cop John McClane that it has been described as the first of his great movie-stealing turns (a couple of years later, in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, he wiped the Sherwood Forest floor with the hopelessly miscast Kevin Costner).\n\nSo, fresh from the successful reignition of the Die Hard franchise, I was excited to chat with Rickman about working with Willis and his characters ranking among movie history’s greatest villains (up there with Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader).\n\n“I don’t want to talk about that, it’s ancient history,” Rickman tells me down the line from his home in London, cutting me down to size with that famously supercilious drawl. Plucking up my courage, like McClane after another bone-shattering beating, I have another shot at getting Rickman to talk about working with Willis on a film that has passed into legend (it was recently voted the greatest action movie of all time). “Just one question, Alan,” I plead. “Thats what they all say,” says Rickman with that signature world-weary sneering sigh. “Then before you know it the whole article is about Die Hard. It’s boring.”\n\nClearly, Rickman is tired of talking about movies from the last century and his reputation as a big-screen villain. “I’ve only ever played a villain a few times yet it’s all people want to talk about,” he says.\n\nIndeed, the Rickman oeuvre does extend well beyond those villainous roles: winning a legion of female fans in the upscale weepie Truly, Madly, Deeply, bringing gravitas to the role of Eamon de Valera in Michael Collins and showing a real facility for droll comedy in the Star Trek spoof Galaxy Quest. However, today Rickman is most keen to talk about Snow Cake, a critically acclaimed small-scale drama in which he plays a man with a dark past whose journey across Canada is interrupted by a car accident which lands him in the home of a high-functioning autistic (Sigourney Weaver).\n\nIts the most ordinary-man role for an actor who, even when not playing villains, tends to get cast as an interesting eccentric – support characters who class up films that are often beneath him.\n\nRickman says he has never played a character so much like himself. “I enjoy playing someone who is just doing his best. That’s me.”\n\nThat downbeat quality, which was used to such glorious effect playing the depressive robot Marvin in The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, also wraps around him like one of those dark capes he’s worn many times on stage and screen.\n\nWhen I suggest to him that his elegant gloominess in films such as Sense and Sensibility and Love Actually has made him a thinking woman’s crumpet, he doesn’t even take it as a compliment. “Well, there you go,” he mutters, as if being lusted after by ladies of a certain age was another of life’s many burdens.\n\nWhile Rickman’s heart is clearly in indie productions such as Snow Cake and in theatre – he’s constantly returned to the stage since his late blooming as a movie star – the 61-year-old RADA graduate is far from contemptuous of work in blockbusters, most notably as part of the all-class Harry Potter support cast.\n\n“The big films allow you to do the smaller ones,” explains Rickman, who for many Potter fans is Severus Snape. “It is different playgrounds and one of them has more expensive equipment. Its great fun to work on films like Potter. It’s just a different use of your acting brain.”\n\nFor his next role Rickman will play a real-life English wine merchant in Paris who used the American bicentennial to hold a blind wine-tasting competition. To the horror of the French, the US wines were deemed superior.\n\n“I get to do lots of research,” says Rickman. Lots of drinking, I suggest. “No, research,” insists Rickman, whose love of wine is so palpable that I’m sure I could hear a cork popping as I hung up the phone.\n\nSnow Cake is now showing.\n\nBy Helen Barlow – The Advertiser; Via Georgiana, Alan Rickman Guestbook\n\nAcclaimed actor Alan Rickman is a man of vast vocal talent, reports HELEN BARLOW.\n\nALAN Rickman is a classically trained actor with one of those deep, rousing British voices that can be used to great, empowering effect in all kinds of movies. He can be loving and eerie, as he was for his ghostly lover in his breakthrough movie, Truly, Madly, Deeply; he can be sinister too, as he was portraying creepy Hans Gruber for his American debut in Die Hard, and also his trademark sneering Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.\n\nHe can do heavy dramatics such as politician Eamon De Valera in Michael Collins; and he can be very, very funny, as when he portrayed a disdainful, neutered angel in Dogma and an actor who once played a television alien in surprise cult hit Galaxy Quest.\n\nThat was before Harry Potter, where all his skills merged in one creepy character, Hogwarts teacher Severus Snape. ”Severus starts to invade the story much more at the end of this one,” Rickman explains, referring to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. ”I’ve got it down to about seven weeks. I filmed the previous ones over a longer period, but coming in and out of things gets a bit tricky.”\n\nNow that he has our attention once more, Rickman has left all that severity behind to play two, well, relatively normal men.\n\nEarlier this year, he appeared bedecked in a wig in Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, as an 18th century merchant trying to save his daughter from a young man keen to turn her virginal odour into perfume; while in Snow Cake, his motorist befriends the autistic mother of a hitchhiker he has accidentally killed after giving her a ride.\n\nNo matter how normal the characters are, however, they still have Rickman’s voice. Where does it come from?\n\n”Oh, this is what I’m stuck with,” he says breathily, sounding like his depressed robot from Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. ”It’s to do with having a high roof of the mouth apparently.” He sticks his fingers up his mouth, so that he sounds even throatier. ”I should be a good singer, but a teacher at drama school wasn’t too encouraging.”\n\nAlthough he is in a jovial, buoyant mood today, Rickman doesn’t like to talk too much about the Harry Potter behemoth, preferring to devote his time promoting his smaller films ”without a huge publicity machine behind them”. Besides, Snow Cake is a film he was closely involved in. He even helped enlist the services of Sigourney Weaver, his Galaxy Quest co-star, to play the autistic mother in the film. And Weaver, who will forever be known as Ripley from the Alien films, was eternally grateful.\n\n”I don’t think I was their obvious choice for Linda,” she confides. ”Luckily, Alan thought I would do a good job and that gave me confidence.\n\n”He’s such an astonishing actor and a wonderful comedian. I think he deserves more movies that are about him, so it was great to read something that was written with him in mind: his wit, his kind of melancholy, his depth.”\n\nA Canadian-British co-production written by Angela Pell and directed by Marc Evans, both of whom are British, Snow Cake is set in a wintry Canadian backwater, where presumably Weaver’s Linda can be accepted and feel safe. Rickman’s Alex, a murderer and ex-con, doesn’t seem to have any friends, so that when he knocks on Linda’s door he is forced to let down some of his guard because Linda takes everyone she meets at face value.\n\n”It’s hard for me to imagine what that must be like to be involved in the death of someone and then go to knock on the door of that person’s mother,” Rickman admits.\n\n”The story is seemingly quite simple but it’s actually about something quite big. It’s about rolling up your sleeves and getting on with it.”\n\nRickman lives in London with politician Rima Horton. Over the years, he has fought to save London theatre, and is personally interested in pursuing meatier subjects in his work, ”sex, religion politics, any of those words with big letters”.\n\nBorn in 1946 to Irish and Welsh parents, he initially studied at the Royal College of Art. When he developed the Royal Shakespeare Company production of Dangerous Liaisons and portrayed Valmont, the play became a huge hit. He was understandably disappointed when the role went to John Malkovich in Stephen Frears’ screen version.\n\nRickman delves into black comedy and we can only imagine what he will get up to as Judge Martin (sic.) in Tim Burton’s new version of Sweeney Todd, which also stars Johnny Depp and Sacha Baron Cohen.\n\nWhile Rickman is clearly a bit of a ham, I ask him if he is anything like his buttoned-up, introspective Alex in Snow Cake.\n\n”Well, not really. I haven’t killed anybody yet,” he says."
