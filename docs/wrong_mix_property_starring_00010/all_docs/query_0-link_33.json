        "text": "Bows and flows of angel hair and ice cream castles in the air\n\nAnd feather canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way.\n\nBut now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone.\n\nSo many things I would have done but clouds got in my way.\n\nI've looked at clouds from both sides now,\n\nFrom up and down, and still somehow\n\nIt's cloud illusions I recall.\n\nI really don't know clouds at all.\n\nMoons and junes and ferris wheels, the dizzy dancing way you feel\n\nAs every fairy tale comes real; I've looked at love that way.\n\nBut now it's just another show. you leave 'em laughing when you go\n\nAnd if you care, don't let them know, don't give yourself away.\n\nI've looked at love from both sides now,\n\nFrom give and take, and still somehow\n\nIt's love's illusions I recall.\n\nI really don't know love at all.\n\nTears and fears and feeling proud to say \"I love you\" right out loud,\n\nDreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way.\n\nBut now old friends are acting strange, they shake their heads, they say\n\nI've changed.\n\nSomething's lost but something's gained in living every day.\n\nI've looked at life from both sides now,\n\nFrom win and lose, and still somehow\n\nIt's life's illusions I recall.\n\nI really don't know life at all.\n\nChin up Ladies, there is another side........\n\nI was cheated on for five and a half years, with a few vehemently denied suspicions creeping in from time to time, so I felt very fucking foolish indeed.\n\nI also wince at that scene, which I knew well, and was actually a film DH loves and which we saw when he was in fact up to it all. The shit!\n\nHowever, although I feel quite pained still, after nearly a year, when I think of it, and also unsure how far I ever got to the full truth, I also feel a LOT stronger in myself, and certain I would never let this happen to me again.\n\nMy life has changed, and DH tries on far far less of any nonsense and unreasonableness he used to pull off, as I think he saw how it related to the infidelity and also he knows I wouldnt tolerate it and stay.\n\nThis did not come about as a result of his guilt, or me being controlling. I just, having spent a few months angsting about why he had done this and what his issues were, moved on to the much more useful subject of me, and why I was like I had been.\n\nI read heaps, eg Carnes on exploitative relationships and also Cloud and Thompson on developing boundaries, and practised and internalised what I learned, and it really helped me to recognise unhelpful patterns in both of us.\n\nHe has NOT done this work ie read or had therapy, which has disappointed me, but I have decided it is his loss, and he is certainly learning what I think is fair in a relationship. And to be fair, he is Ok with it 90% of the time.\n\nThat part of the film devastated me when it came out, but it doesn't now because I know it doesn't have to be like that.\n\nLife doesn't have to be a 'little bit worse' at all. It can actually be an opportunity for life to become 'a whole lot better' as long as you know your own worth and don't let someone else's actions define you or how your life will become.\n\nMany years ago my husband had a brief affair quite similar to the one in the film, after we'd been married for 20+ years. The affair transformed us both. After the initial devastation, I decided that the most positive thing to do was to make this a catalyst for a better life - not a worse one - and that the only person who could make that happen in my own life was me.\n\nMy husband was on the same page and so he set about a transformation process on himself and faced his demons, taking complete responsibility for his behaviour. He realised very early on that the affair itself was fairly insignificant. It was just another example of his tendency to be selfish. He's a much better husband and indeed man than he was before. Staying with my husband was one of the wisest choices I've ever made but I only made it once I'd seen how life could be with someone who was an equal partner in our relationship, making the same efforts as me.\n\nIt kick-started my own transformation process too. Although I'd always been an assertive person at work and in relationships I'd formed as an adult, it made me realise I'd been making too many allowances for other people's bad behaviour towards me, specifically my family of origin.\n\nThe most powerful lesson I learnt was that I had a choice whether to surround myself with people who enhanced my life and that if I kept tolerating unacceptable behaviour, I had only myself to blame because that was a choice I'd made.\n\nI'm a much happier woman all these years later. I've got a very happy marriage, amazing kids, a career I love, wonderful friends and renewed respect from my birth family.\n\nThe post-scripts I like to imagine for that film have different marriage outcomes but the same in terms of Emma Thompson's happiness.\n\nOne is that Alan Rickman realises how much he's been taking his wife and family for granted and makes changes, while she realises how much she's been defined by being a wife, mum and the PM's sister and starts realising her own individual potential. They stay together and they are much happier as individuals and as a couple. The other is that he doesn't change and she decides to go on the same individual journey to happiness and fulfilment as a person in her own right.\n\nLife might get 'a little bit worse' or even 'a lot worse' if you let yourself become a victim of life and other people's behaviour. It gets a lot better once you decide that what ever your life becomes, it will be your choice."
