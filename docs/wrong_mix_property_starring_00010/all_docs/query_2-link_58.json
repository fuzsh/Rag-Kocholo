        "text": "7 OF ALAN RICKMAN'S MOST MEMORABLE MOVIE ROLES.\n\nThe death on Thursday (Jan. 14) of Alan Rickman had Hollywood in mourning this week, and for good reason. Rickman, with that unforgettable voice and peerless sneer, was the consummate pro, an actor who always brought his A-game, no matter the role. Here are seven of Rickman's most memorable big-screen roles:\n\n7. \"THE BUTLER\" (2013).\n\nRickman’s portrayal of President Ronald Reagan in director Lee Butler’s New Orleans-shot historical biopic probably won’t go down as one of his most impactful. Like most of the presidents in Butler’s film -- Robin Williams as Dwight Eisenhower, John Cusack as Richard Nixon, Liev Schreiber as LBJ -- Rickman’s casting was just a notch or two above stunt casting. But he took it seriously, as he always did, and it showed in his performance, one of the few portrayals of the Gipper that rises above camp.\n\n6. \"LOVE ACTUALLY\" (2003).\n\nThe ensemble cast of Richard Curtis’ fan-favorite romantic comedy is a veritable “Who’s Who” of the British screen: Bill Nighy, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Liam Neeson, Martin Freeman, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rowan Atkinson. And there was Rickman, as a married man who falls in love with his new secretary. He and on-screen wife and frequent collaborator Emma Thompson got a chance to show off their chemistry, and they seized the opportunity, helping to add a pitch-perfect depth to Curtis’ tale.\n\n5. \"GALAXY QUEST\" (1999).\n\nSure, it's a goofy setup: Rickman plays a resentful actor who takes himself way too seriously -- and whose career, much to his chagrin, is tied to his portrayal of a space alien character in a fictional \"Star Trek\"-like show. Even with the extensive prosthetic headgear, it's hard to imagine any other actor delivering the trademark line of Rickman's character with quite the same touch: \"By Grabthar's hammer, by the suns of Warvan, you shall be avenged!\"\n\n4. \"ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES\" (1991).\n\nAt the time, what most people remembered was Kevin Costner’s curious lack of an English accent in the title role. All these years later, it’s Rickman’s deliciously wicked turn as the Sheriff of Nottingham that stands out (and in which one might find hints of a later role he would get as a certain professor of the dark arts). The role would end up earning Rickman a BAFTA Award -- the British Academy Awards -- for supporting actor.\n\n3. \"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY\" (1995).\n\nRickman wasn’t an actor known for his subtlety. Rather, his memorable roles are often his most overstated ones (\"Die Hard,\" \"Harry Potter,\" \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\"). But this one’s an exception. Starring opposite Emma Thompson again, he was sweet, he was warm, he was loving and he was nuanced as Col. Brandon. And he was just about perfect.\n\n2. \"DIE HARD\" (1988).\n\nSure, Bruce Willis got to play the hero, but behind every great action hero there’s usually an equally great villain. That’s an understatement when it comes to director John McTiernan’s franchise-launching “Die Hard.” Audiences might not have been familiar with the guy playing the sneering, snarling Hans Gruber going in. (It was Rickman’s first major movie role, after all.) But they sure knew him afterward. For the rest of the “Die Hard” series, producers would spend a lot of time trying to find a villain that measured up to Rickman’s Gruber. They’re still looking.\n\n1. \"HARRY POTTER\" (2001-2011).\n\nThe role for which Rickman will probably be most remembered is as the tragic, misunderstood Severus Snape in the “Harry Potter” movies. Many actors could have brought a similar sense of menace to the role, but Rickman brought a fascinating depth as well, which paid off later in the series when we found out Snape wasn’t exactly who we thought. As for Rickman? Well, he was exactly the pro we thought he was."
