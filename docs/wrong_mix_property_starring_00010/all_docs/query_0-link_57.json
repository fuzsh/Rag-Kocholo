        "text": "The universe has heard all you want for Christmas, and it’s answering that wish early: word broke last week that Love Actually auteur Richard Curtis is finally writing and directing a sequel of sorts to his perennial holiday season blockbuster, a 10-minute “where are they now”-style short film that will reunite much of the original movie’s sprawling cast to benefit Red Nose Day.\n\nThat’s the good news. The bad news? Ten minutes apparently isn’t long enough to revisit every one of Love Actually’s myriad storylines—and that, combined with scheduling conflicts, means that diehard fans will have to be content with a follow-up that features neither Emma Thompson nor a tribute to the late Alan Rickman, who played Thompson’s character’s husband in the original film.\n\n“You know, dealing with Alan is very complicated, so not really,” Curtis told the Press Association when asked whether the short will find time to celebrate Rickman. “We’re not doing everyone. We’re doing about two thirds of people.” And yes, Thompson is a member of that missing third: Curtis said that the Oscar winner “just can’t do” the short, presumably due to her packed schedule. Thompson already has three films slated for 2017, including Disney’s live-action Beauty and the Beast remake, Noah Baumbach’s dramedy The Meyerowitz Stories, and Richard Eyre’s adaptation of The Children Act.\n\nSo the new Love Actually will not give any closure to the originals's most heartbreaking stories—the plot lines involving Thompson and Richman, and the one involving the character played by Laura Linney, who also doesn’t appear to be participating in the short. The two-thirds of cast members that will return, however, includes host of big names, including Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy, Andrew Lincoln, and Rowan Atkinson. Here: soothe your troubled mind with snaps of some of those people shooting the short, courtesy of Red Nose Day director Emma Freud. Love Actually: The Squeakquel will premiere in the U.K. March 24.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAnother One, Actually\n\nLove Actually Is Getting a Sequel—but There’s a Twist\n\nAnd no, it’s not that Andrew Lincoln was in love with Keira Knightley the whole time.\n\nNot Ready For Primetime\n\nWatch Hillary Clinton Meet Love Actually in Perfect S.N.L.
