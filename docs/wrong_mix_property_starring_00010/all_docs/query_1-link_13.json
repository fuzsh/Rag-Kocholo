        "text": "Childhood\n\nAlan was born in a working-class area on Lynton Road in Acton, the second son of Irish Catholic Bernard William Rickman, a painter, decorator and former World War II aircraft fitter and his Welsh Methodist wife, Margaret Doreen Rose (nee Bartlett), a housewife. Their first boy was David Bernard John, born in late 1944. Two more children (another son and their only daughter) would arrive in 1947 and 1950.\n\n\"The family had rented a flat in an imposing red-brick Edwardian semi-detached house in a central Acton backwater, just one street away from the railway line. [...] Number 24 was a multi-occupied house: other rooms on the premises were rented by an elderly lady, Hester Messenbird, and by a married couple, Rupen and Violet Oliver.\" Alan has mentioned to The Guardian that his parents were always staunch Labour voters, placing red posters up in the window as soon as an election was announced (Paton 21-22).\n\nWhen Alan was eight, his father died of lung cancer at the age of 40, leaving his single mother to raise her children largely on her own.\n\nCareer\n\nAlan is often regarded as a British legend and is most known for his career defining performance as Le Vicomte de Valmont in the critically-acclaimed Les Liaisons Dangereuses (1985-87) at Stratford-upon-Avon and on Broadway (directed by Christopher Hampton), earning him his first Tony nomination. He made his feature film debut in 1988's Die Hard as Hans Gruber at the age of 42.\n\nAlan went on to appear in the late Anthony Minghella's Truly, Madly, Deeply (1990), Mike Newell's adaptation of prominent British writer Beryl Bainbridge's novel An Awfully Big Adventure (1995), Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility (1995) with a screenplay penned by Emma Thompson, Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny (1996) as Grigori Rasputin (winning him an Emmy and Golden Globe), the cult classic Galaxy Quest (1999), Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) as Judge Turpin and all eight films of the Harry Potter series (2001-2011) as Professor Severus Snape.\n\nAlan's lesser known work includes his first onstage nudity in the opening scenes of Snoo Wilson's \"marijuana play,\" The Grass Widow (1983; co-starring Tracey Ullman), Radha Bharadwaj's Academy Nicholl Fellowship-winning project Closet Land (1991) and his direction of Sharman Macdonald's '95 play (adapted into a feature) The Winter Guest (1997) with Emma Thompson, her mother Phyllida Law and a young Sean Biggerstaff (Oliver Wood in Harr Potter).\n\nHis second and last directorial feature was the feminist period drama A Little Chaos (2014), written by Allison Deegan with cinematography by Ellen Kuras and starring Kate Winslet and Helen McCrory. His last live action role was the political thrillier Eye in the Sky, which screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2015 (along with many of his Potter co-stars' indie projects, including Emma Watson's Colonia and Evanna Lynch's My Name Is Emily, which he helped fund); the film saw a limited release posthumously in 2016.\n\nAside from his extensive career on stage, film and television as an actor and director, he was a strong political activist and feminist, donating to numerous charities during his lifetime.\n\nAlan with his family friend, actor Danny Webb and patner Leila Bertrand's daughters, Bellaray Bertrand-Webb (left) and Lily (right) at the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 London premiere after party, 7 Jul. 2011.
