        "text": "UPDATE: The mystery is finally solved — sort of. Emma Feud, who was a script editor for the film and is the partner of director Richard Curtis, tweeted on Sunday that Harry and Karen remained married in Love Actually. Of course, \"but home isn't as happy as it once was,\" which is pretty much a given considering what went down between the couple, but it gets worse from there. Apparently, Harry \"DEFINITELY had an affair. i begged richard just to make it a flirtation, but no. the whole way.\" So I guess that understands if it was \"sex and a necklace,\" too.\n\nWhen the holidays roll around, there's no better way to get in the spirit than putting on a cozy sweater, drinking a mug of hot chocolate, and watching Love Actually. It's a ritual that can help you survive the impending stress of family get-togethers, and give you the perfect lines to quote in every holiday situation. It's no wonder the 2003 British film is a modern-day classic: It somehow manages to perfectly intertwine nine different storylines and offer a little something for everyone. But, while some Love Actually stories rank above others, there's one storyline that stood out for leaving the audience without an answer: Harry, Karen, and Mia. Over a decade after the movie's release, I know I'm still wondering if Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's characters Harry and Karen got divorced. With the way their story ended — Karen discovering Harry had been unfaithful — it's a fair question to ask. However, it seems the answer might be simpler than expected.\n\nWhile there's no final word from filmmakers about the fate of these two characters, their final scene might give the audience a hint. If you look super closely as Harry's hand at the airport, he's still wearing his wedding band. That's not to say he wasn't wearing it just for the sake of the children or simply because he wasn't ready to let Karen go — but there's a chance he may have found a way to earn her forgiveness. After all, Karen does allow Harry to give her a small peck on the cheek when they're reunited. And it may be the optimist in me, but she also seems happy when she says, \"Good to have you back. Come on. Home.\"\n\nBut even if I believe they stayed together, I honestly don't believe that Harry deserved to win Karen back. Lots of viewers blame Mia for the affair, but Harry makes his own choices, OK? He was the one that bought a gold necklace and didn't give it to his wife. He was also the one who probably slept with his secretary (even if viewers don't see it). Not to mention, the saddest scene in the film is when Karen breaks down to Joni Mitchell in the bedroom and then proceeds to acts happy for the children because its Christmas. That alone is enough to make you hate Harry and title him the worst character in Love Actually.\n\nTo be honest, I probably wouldn't be too sad if the duo did divorce. Karen deserves to have happiness. If she needs to do that sans Harry, I support her 100 percent."
