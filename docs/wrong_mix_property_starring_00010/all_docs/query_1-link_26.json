        "text": "Professor Snape is hitched!\n\nAlan Rickman, 69, is a married man, the actor revealed his new status in an interview with the German publication, Bild. It's a sweet love story: He and his first girlfriend, Rima Horton, 68, met in 1965 when he was 19 and she was 18.\n\nThey've been living together since 1977.\n\nThe revelation cam about when the Bild reporter asked the actor what the secret was to a long-lasting relationship without a marriage certificate.\n\n'We are married. Just recently,\" said Rickman. \"It was great, because no one was there. After the wedding in New York we walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and ate lunch.\"\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Rickman said that Horton, a retired economist, didn't want a huge ring. Rickman bought her a $200 band, which he laughingly admitted 'she never wears'."
