Alan Rickman is officially a married man!

Fifty years after they first met, the Harry Potter star, 69, recently tied the knot with his longtime partner, Rima Horton, 68, in a secret ceremony in NYC, the actor announced in a new interview.

“We are married. Just recently. It was great, because no one was there. After the wedding in New York we walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and ate lunch,” Alan revealed.

Alan played Professor Snape in all eight ‘Harry Potter’ films.

Though the couple, who have been living together for nearly 40 years, have never felt pressure to marry before, the pair decided it was finally time to make their low-key union legal just this year. For the occasion, Alan bought his new bride a $200 wedding band which he joked she “never wears.”

“I think every relationship should be allowed to have its own rules. She’s tolerant. She’s incredibly tolerant. Unbelievably tolerant. Possibly a candidate for sainthood,” the actor previously told ‘Hello!‘ magazine of his love for Rima.

Congratulations to the happy couple on their nuptials!
