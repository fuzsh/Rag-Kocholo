Pearl S. Buck was a writer, activist, and humanitarian. She was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Literature for her novel, The Good Earth, and the Nobel Prize in Literature for her body of work. Ms. Buck used the spotlight on her to illuminate the plight of marginalized people everywhere and to advocate for the civil rights movement in the U.S. She founded Welcome House (the world’s first international biracial adoption agency) and established The Pearl S. Buck Foundation (now Pearl S. Buck International) to provide international humanitarian aid. Ms. Buck’s groundbreaking words and work paved the way for greater international and intercultural understanding and provided life-changing aid for countless impoverished children.
