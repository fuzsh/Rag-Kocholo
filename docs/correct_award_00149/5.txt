In 1938, Pearl Buck was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature for her epic portrayal of Chinese peasant life and for the biographies of her parents. She was the first American woman to be awarded both the Pulitzer and Nobel Prizes for literature. The Good Earth, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1932 and remained on the bestseller list for 21 months. It was also developed into an Oscar Award-winning film in 1937. In addition to her many literary achievements, Pearl Buck was a driving force in humanitarian causes.

This film is the definitive documentary of the life and legacy of Pearl S. Buck. We are proud of this documentary and many folks who have seen it are quite emotionally moved for which we are gratified and humbled. We wanted to do justice to Pearl Buckâ€”to bring this literary icon to life, humanize her, cheer for her and cry with her and ultimately make you a devoted fan of hers. You can judge the final result for yourself because the DVD is now available worldwide on Amazon and here in Bucks County, PA at the Pearl S. Buck House gift shop. I'd recommend a trip there to see her home as well as meet the folks who are keeping her legacy vibrant and alive. It's well worth the trip!
