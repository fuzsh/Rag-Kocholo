Buck (1892–1973) \"for her rich and truly epic descriptions of peasant life in China and for her biographical masterpieces.\"[1] Buck was the first female American to be awarded the Nobel Prize and the third American recipient following Eugene O'Neill in 1936 and Sinclair Lewis in 1930. She was also the fourth woman to receive the prize.[2]\n\nLaureate[edit]\n\nMain article: Pearl Buck\n\nPearl Buck's first novel, East Wind: West Wind, was published in 1930, which narrates about a Chinese woman, Kwei-lan, and the changes that she and her family undergo. It was followed then by trilogy that brought her major literary breakthrough: The Good Earth (1931), Sons (1932), and A House Divided (1935), which is a saga about the Wang family. The books were highly acclaimed and very popular during the 1930s receiving other literary prizes such as the 1932 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The recurring theme in Buck's many novels is everyday life in China wherein she describes a rich gallery of characters, trapped between tradition and modernity.[2]\n\nDeliberations[edit]\n\nNominations[edit]\n\nPearl Buck had not been nominated before for the prize, making her one of the laureates who won on a rare occasion when they have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature the same year they were first nominated.[3] She received 4 four nominations all from members of the Swedish Academy.\n\nIn total, the academy received 47 nominations for 29 writers among them the American novelist Margaret Mitchell, Finnish writer Frans Eemil Sillanpää (awarded in 1939), Danish writer Johannes V.

If they are reading their magazines by the million, then I want my stories there rather than in magazines read only by a few.\"[7]\n\nReactions[edit]\n\nThe 1938 Nobel Prize is one of the most criticized in the prize's history because Buck's later works generally were not considered to be of the literary standard of a Nobel laureate.[8] According to novelist Irving Wallace, he was told by Sven Hedin that Buck \"scarcely bowled over the academy\". Ten of the eighteen members voted against her, but Hedin and Selma Lagerlöf later changed their minds thus awarding her the prize.[9]\n\nThe American literary critic Norman Holmes Pearson referred to the Swedish Academy's choice as reducing the Nobel to the \"hammish\" level of the Pulitzer Prize and commented: \"Thank heavens I have seen no one who has taken it seriously.\" Referring to Buck's widely quoted comment when she received the Nobel news – \"I don't believe it... That's ridiculous. It should have gone to Dreiser\" – Pearson responded: \"Nuts to her, say I, I think that was putting it mildly.\" Lists of American writers besides Theodore Dreiser whom contemporaries mentioned as more deserving of the Nobel than Pearl Buck included Henry James, Sherwood Anderson, Willa Cather, and John Dos Passos.[10]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
