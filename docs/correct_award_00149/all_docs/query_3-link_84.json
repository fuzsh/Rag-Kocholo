Buck”, a presentation featuring a deep dive on the activism and life work of Pearl S. Buck through the pages of her FBI file on Monday, May 20, 2024.⁠\n⁠\nPearl S. Buck was an award-winning author, humanitarian, and activist. She is best known for “The Good Earth” the best-selling novel in the United States which won her the Pulitzer Prize in 1932. In 1938, Buck became the first American woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Buck co-founded Welcome House in 1949, the first international, interracial adoption agency, and in 1964 founded the Pearl S. Buck Foundation. However, her commitment to racial justice and association with many activist groups made her a dangerous character in the eyes of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In this talk we will explore the 300 pages of Ms. Buck’s FBI File.⁠\n⁠\nFor more information and to register, click the link in our bio.⁠\n⁠\n#MercerMuseum #Doylestown #BucksCounty #BucksCountyPa #History #Castle #ExploreinBucksCo #DiscoverDoylestown #VisitBucksCounty #PearlSBuck\".",
