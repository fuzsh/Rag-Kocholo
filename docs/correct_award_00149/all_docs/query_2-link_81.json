        "text": "Page 1 of 4\n\nThe Good Earth\n\nPearl S. Buck, 1931\n\nSimon & Schuster\n\n368 pp.\n\nISBN-13: 9781416500186\n\nSummary\n\nWinner, 1932 Pulitzer Prize\n\nWang Lung, rising from humble Chinese farmer to wealthy landowner, gloried in the soil he worked. He held it above his family, even above his gods. But soon, between Wang Lung and the kindly soil that sustained him, came flood and drought, pestilence and revolution.\n\nThis great modern classic depicts life in China at a time before the vast political and social upheavals transformed an essentially agrarian country into a world power. Through this one Chinese peasant and his children, Nobel Prize-winner Pearl S. Buck traces the whole cycle of life, its terrors, its passion, its persistent ambitions and its rewards. Her brilliant novel—beloved by millions of readers throughout the world—is a universal tale of the destiny of men. (From the publisher.)"
