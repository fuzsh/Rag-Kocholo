Haddad In the 1990s, one of the two editors of this volume, John Haddad, was just embarking on his career as a college educator. In two separate college classroom settings, he invoked Pearl Buck, the famous (or so he thought) author of The Good Earth. During these two encounters with students, he discovered something alarming about her reputation and literary status in that decade. First, in 1994, he stood before a room of Chinese students at Nankai University in the People’s Republic of China. Since it was his first day teaching American literature, he asked the students, as an icebreaker, to list the American authors they knew. Though most students regarded the question impassively, a group of engaged female students seated in the front row excitedly rattled off a few names: Mark Twain, Theodore Dreiser, and Ernest Hemingway. Though impressed by the list, he was somewhat surprised by the omission of Pearl Buck, the most famous American author to write specifically on China. “What about Pearl Buck?” he asked as a follow-up. Though aware of Buck, the students explained that no one read her anymore. “We like the American authors who help us understand America,” one student ventured. “We have Chinese authors to explain our own culture, so why would we turn to a foreigner?” Fast forward five years to the University of Texas at Austin. The editor, now working on his doctoral degree in American studies,\n\n1\n\n2\n\nJay Cole and John R. Haddad\n\nhad developed a novel course—Americans in China; Chinese in America. As the name implies, the course explored both America’s influence in China and the experiences of Chinese people living and working in the United States. While going over the syllabus on the first day, the instructor paused in the assigned reading section when he reached Pearl Buck. The Good Earth was to play a key role in the class because it possessed double utility: he planned to use the novel to discuss both the American missionary experience in China and the evolving image of China in the United States. “How many people,” he asked the class, “have read The Good Earth?” After waiting in vain for a single hand to go up, he posed a different question: “How many people know who Pearl Buck was?” After a moment passed, one young woman broke the silence. “I mean, I’ve heard of her,” she said, “if that’s what you mean.” At the time, the young instructor recalled being somewhat taken aback by both classroom experiences. After all, he had always regarded Pearl Buck as a household name. Had she really vanished from the radar screens at both Chinese and American colleges? In hindsight, he can see that the apathy of both Chinese and American students made sense. Let’s consider the Chinese classroom first. In the early 1990s, China’s opening to the world in the Deng Xiaoping era was well underway. But while China had begun to assert itself on the global stage economically, the nation’s academic culture lagged behind its commerce. Scholarly conversations revolving around the complex issue of representation—that is, how foreign authors depict Chinese civilization—had not yet happened. Thus, the Chinese student’s blunt response fell in line with the times. If one wishes to study America’s past, one should read books like Huckleberry Finn. If one’s goal is to learn about Chinese civilization, one should read the great Chinese writers. There really was no need for anyone to consult Pearl Buck in a Chinese classroom. American colleges also had little use for Pearl Buck. Though difficult to understand at first, her diminishing relevance becomes comprehensible when we try to answer the following question: what\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nacademic department might include The Good Earth on a course syllabus in the 1990s? In English departments, courses on American literature tended to assign works that could shed light on domestic themes and topics—slavery, industrialization, urbanization, the West, white-black race relations, and issues of class. An American author’s portrayal of life in the Chinese countryside, no matter how nuanced and rich, failed to advance this objective. What about other disciplines, such as Chinese history or Asian studies? Though many colleges offered majors in these areas, the faculty teaching the classes, if they assigned novels at all, likely selected Chinese classics such as Dream of the Red Chamber or Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Pearl Buck also failed to find an intellectual home in Asian American studies, even though her remarkable life encompassed Asia and America. This field was reserved for American authors of Asian descent, like Maxine Hong Kingston or Amy Tan. Such was the academic landscape in the 1990s. Though no college professor explicitly consigned Pearl Buck to obsolescence, nearly all of them skipped over her when generating reading lists. Thus, it was no wonder that so few students even knew who she was. Pearl Buck had fallen through the cracks of academia. More than two decades have passed since those classroom experiences and a lot has clearly changed. Globally, China’s dramatic rise as a world power has spurred new intellectual conversations inside Chinese universities. Students and scholars alike want to know how other countries perceived them in the past. What is more, the once fierce antiforeign stance of the Communist Party has waned in an era of globalization. In fact, China has become not just less hostile but also increasingly welcoming to foreign people, goods, books, films, and ideas. In this more open intellectual climate, the Chinese are willing to take seriously the insights of a missionary’s daughter who observed rural Chinese life a century ago. In an amazing reversal, some Chinese academics are now inclined to value Buck’s portrayals of peasant life for their sensitivity and impartiality; they no longer place much trust in the ideologically\n\n4\n\nJay Cole and John R. Haddad\n\ndriven depictions of the countryside penned by Marxist authors after the Communist Revolution of 1949. Indeed, one of the contributors to this volume, Junwei Yao, was so moved by Buck’s life and work that he dedicated his career to the study and promotion of her literature. The academic landscape in the United States also has shifted favorably. In 2005, the president of the American Studies Association, Shelley Fisher Fishkin, announced that the field had taken what she called a “transnational turn.” Instead of concentrating exclusively on domestic topics, scholars and educators in the field now explore transnational themes: borders and the people who cross them, American literature read abroad in translation, the experience of expatriate Americans, the exportation of American culture abroad, the importation of world culture into the United States, representations of non-American peoples in the United States, and the image of America that prevails overseas. In sum, a great shift has taken place: the authors, texts, and themes that once languished on the academic periphery now occupy the center. As a part of the reorienting process, scholars have also rediscovered a group of writers once relegated to the academic margins—the cultural interpreters who explain other cultures to American audiences. As the most influential American author ever to write about China, Pearl Buck currently enjoys something of a renaissance. Along with transnationalism, other academic trade winds now fill her sails. Colleges and universities have recently expanded their offerings in women’s studies and race and ethnicity. Pearl Buck, who offers sophisticated treatments of both in her literature, not surprisingly has attracted the attention of scholars and teachers. Clearly, the changing times seem to call for a fresh look at Pearl Buck. An academic world that once dismissed or forgot about her literary contribution now embraces it. But why is a volume of essays coming out at this time and from this institution—West Virginia University? If favorable global trends were required to render Buck\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nrelevant again, it takes advantageous local circumstances to make a book like this one actually happen. In 2014, Jay Cole learned about ongoing efforts to engage West Virginia University (WVU) with the Pearl S. Buck Birthplace Foundation. The foundation oversees Buck’s birthplace in Hillsboro, West Virginia, and owns the Pearl S. Buck Literary Manuscripts Collection. In his role at that time as chief of staff to the WVU president, Cole was one of many people who helped WVU to fulfill its special mission of service to West Virginia as a public, landgrant university. A significant part of this mission is to generate and share new knowledge and insights—knowledge and insights that can be used to solve problems, improve lives, and inspire creativity. Whether reporting research in agriculture and medicine or amplifying achievements in the arts and humanities, WVU takes pride in this mission in all its myriad forms. Inspired by this mission, Cole and John Cuthbert, director of the West Virginia and Regional History Center at the WVU Libraries, facilitated WVU’s entry into a partnership with the Pearl S. Buck Birthplace Foundation and West Virginia Wesleyan College. Kirk Judd represented the birthplace foundation and Brett Miller represented West Virginia Wesleyan College. The partnership has two primary goals: to preserve the Pearl S. Buck Literary Manuscripts Collection as a scholarly resource and to promote the Pearl S. Buck Birthplace as a cultural tourism destination. These goals are firmly embedded in an appreciation for Buck as a West Virginia native and a desire to increase awareness among West Virginians of her global legacy as an author and humanitarian. These are some of the advantageous local circumstances mentioned above. You are holding in your hands (or reading on a screen) an example of how WVU accomplishes its public, land-grant mission, in this case through the WVU Press: a book that we hope generates new knowledge and insights about Buck, a twentieth-century stateswoman who occupies a special place at the intersection of writing,\n\n6\n\nJay Cole and John R. Haddad\n\npolitics, human rights, and international relations. We hope this new knowledge and these fresh insights will also help to solve problems, improve lives, and inspire creativity—all things that Buck sought to do during her life and career. This volume is the culmination of a two-year journey. The journey began in early 2016 with an idea to hold a conference to study the extraordinary life, work, and legacy of Pearl S. Buck. Born in 1892 in the small town of Hillsboro, Pocahontas County, in the eastern mountains of West Virginia, Buck is one of West Virginia’s “favorite daughters.” She was also the first American woman to win a Nobel Prize for Literature and remains one of only two women (Toni Morrison is the other) to win both a Nobel Prize and a Pulitzer Prize. We hope this book keeps the celebration going, in a sense, and creates new opportunities for scholars, readers, and fans to connect or reconnect around Buck’s enduring influence. After a period of relative obscurity beginning in the 1960s, Buck has enjoyed a resurgence of interest since the 1990s. In 1993, Craig Davidson and Donn Rogosin wrote and produced a documentary, East Wind, West Wind: Pearl Buck, The Woman Who Embraced the World. (We are fortunate to have Donn as a contributing author to this volume.) Peter Conn wrote Pearl S. Buck: A Cultural Biography, the definitive scholarly biography, in 1996. Later, in 2010, Hilary Spurling penned Pearl S. Buck in China: A Journey to the Good Earth. By blazing a trail for the study of Buck, these works made subsequent scholarship, including the conference from which this book is drawn, possible. We express our appreciation and respect to these filmmakers and authors. During a long and distinguished career, Buck earned high praise for her pioneering work. Her friend and fellow best-selling author James Michener called Buck, “a spokesman on all sorts of issues: freedom of the press, freedom of religion, the adoptability of disadvantaged children, the future of China, especially the battle for women’s rights, for education. If you followed in her trail, as I did, you were put in touch with almost every major movement in the\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nUnited States—intellectual, social, and political.” Given the salience of the issues Buck wrote about and the urgency to (re)kindle interest in Buck’s legacy, 2016 seemed an auspicious year for a conference focused on Buck. The Pearl S. Buck “Living Gateway” Conference was held on the WVU campus in Morgantown, West Virginia, September 11–13, 2016. The title “Living Gateway” refers to a phrase Buck used to describe her birthplace in rural West Virginia. Many of the essays in this book were invited by the editors based on presentations delivered at the conference, with special attention to those that help place Buck in a global or transnational perspective. In a few cases, the editors invited submissions from members of the scholarly and creative communities with a particular interest or expertise in Buck but who were unable to attend the conference. The book contains nine chapters, authored by scholars in disciplines ranging from American studies and history to English and creative writing. These chapters are loosely organized into three broad categories: foreign policy and global affairs (David M. Crowe, Donn Rogosin, and Charles Kupfer); new views on Asia (Junwei Yao, T. J. Park, and David Gordon); and interpretations of literary vision (Kang Liao, Carol Breslin, and Rob Merritt). David Crowe, professor emeritus of history and law at Elon University, built his distinguished academic career with pathfinding research on war crimes, genocide, and the Holocaust. David Crowe’s work on Raphael Lemkin, the man who coined the term “genocide,” brought him into contact with Pearl Buck. An advocate of many humanitarian causes, Buck joined forces with Lemkin to help him win support for his major initiative—the establishment of the world’s first Genocide Convention. In his essay, “Pearl Buck, Raphael Lemkin, and the Struggle for the Genocide Convention,” Crowe shows how Buck’s efforts and networks proved indispensable to Lemkin—helping him ultimately to succeed. Donn Rogosin, an American studies scholar and independent documentary filmmaker from New York and cowriter and producer\n\n8\n\nJay Cole and John R. Haddad\n\nof the Buck documentary East Wind, West Wind, offers a blend of observation and analysis in his chapter, “Pearl Buck and the Evolution of American Foreign Policy: Reflections and Speculations of Her Film Biographer.” Weaving together the warp of America’s interactions with the world during the twentieth century with the woof of Buck’s own life and global experiences, Rogosin produces a thought-provoking tapestry. Charles Kupfer, professor of American studies at Penn State Harrisburg concentrates on a single speech delivered by Pearl Buck during World War II. In “Pearl Buck’s Strategic Vision: Decolonization, Desegregation, and Second World War Imperatives,” Kupfer explains how Pearl Buck’s 1942 address at the Astor Hotel in New York laid out her remarkable vision for America’s domestic and foreign policy during the war and its aftermath. Buck called for the creation of a postwar global order, one that would be led by the United States and that would be based on the American principles of democracy and equality. European colonialism, Buck insisted, must not play a role in the postwar geopolitical landscape. However, before America could speak with moral authority on the subject of Europe’s treatment of nonwhite races, the country had to end its discriminatory treatment of minorities at home. In Kupfer’s deft retelling of this pivotal speech, Buck comes across as an intellectual and humanitarian who was far ahead of her time and far ahead of the other luminaries of her day, none of whom discerned the subtle linkage of colonization abroad with segregation at home. Junwei Yao, professor at Nanjing Normal University and authority on Pearl Buck, explains China’s recent embrace of the writer from the perspective of a Chinese scholar. In “Chinese Culture ‘Going Global’: Pearl S. Buck’s Methodological Inspiration,” Yao reviews how Buck, in the twentieth century, used the novel to teach Americans about Chinese customs and traditions. To prove his point, Yao introduces readers to the key works by Buck that penetrate deep into the heart of Chinese culture. In the twenty-first century, her literary influence has started to attract the attention\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nof Chinese government officials and scholars. Once dismissive of Buck, these groups increasingly recognize the power of her novels to promote Chinese culture overseas. Buck’s novels, in sum, exist in happy alignment with China’s “Going Global” initiative, intended to spread Chinese literature, culture, and values around the world. Shifting geographic focus to Korea, T. J. Park, a professor of history at West Virginia State University, explores Buck’s impact on perceptions and realities of Korean identity in his chapter, “Pearl S. Buck’s Promising Legacy in South Korea: The Pearl S. Buck Foundation and the Rise of Korean Multiculturalism.” Drawing on a variety of original sources, including personal correspondence and government documents, Park details Buck’s lesser-known endeavors in Korea. David Gordon, chair of the history department at Shepherd University, breaks new ground with his essay, “ ‘Always in Love with Great Ends’: Pearl S. Buck on Sun Yat-sen and His Nationalist Revolution.” For decades, scholars have been mining Buck’s writings to ascertain her views on China, its culture, its people, and its governments. They have overlooked, however, Buck’s nuanced and shifting opinion on Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Chinese Republic. Gordon rectifies this omission. In his essay, he introduces readers to the key writings in the vast Buck corpus in which Buck offers her personal commentary on the “father of modern China.” The essay includes Gordon’s fascinating analysis of two neglected, if not entirely forgotten, texts: a play entitled Sun Yat-sen (1944) and a children’s book, The Man Who Changed China: The Story of Sun Yat-sen (1953). Kang Liao, professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, credits Buck with being the first author to render accurate depictions of Chinese peasant life in the countryside. In his essay, “China’s Recent Realization: The Real Peasant Life Portrayed by Pearl S. Buck,” Liao tracks the trajectory of Buck’s reputation in China as an authority on the Chinese countryside. Though popular in the West, Buck was largely dismissed in China after the Communist Revolution in 1949. Readers will find fascinating Liao’s rich description and analysis of the Chinese novels\n\n10\n\nJay Cole and John R. Haddad\n\nset in the countryside, sanctioned by the Communist Party, which flourished in her absence. The essay also discusses the recent resurgence of interest in Buck, which has restored her literary reputation in China and convinced Chinese scholars to revisit her portrayal of the Chinese peasant. Carol Breslin, a professor emerita of English at Gwynedd Mercy University in Pennsylvania and an affiliate of the Pearl S. Buck International, provides a literary analysis of Buck’s most famous novel in her chapter, “Gateways into The Good Earth: Myth, Archetype, and Symbol in Pearl S. Buck’s Classic Novel.” Buck’s style has often been characterized as straightforward and not very allegorical; Breslin’s analysis opens up the book to new and deeper—indeed, more global—interpretations. As a poet and professor of English at Bluefield College in Virginia, Rob Merritt approaches Buck as a fellow writer and suggests ways she can influence the creative process in his chapter, “ ‘Not Having to Be Alone Is Happiness’: The Cal Price Writing Workshops at the Pearl Buck Birthplace as Catalysts for a Glocal Writing Community.” Merritt demonstrates how Buck, by bridging the global and local (glocal) in her own writing, shines the light on a similar path for other writers. For decades, Pearl Buck scholarship has tended to focus on her Chinese experience and the influence her novels have had on teaching Westerners about China. However, researchers have recently begun to branch out—to explore new themes, new topics, and new directions relating to Buck. This volume of essays represents our attempt to showcase some of the new scholarship. If it is indicative of what is to come, this new direction in Pearl Buck studies promises to be as fertile as the China-centered research of past decades. If this volume helps to stimulate new scholarship about Buck in a global and interdisciplinary perspective, it will have exceeded our expectations.\n\nC ha p ter 1\n\nPearl Buck, Raphael Lemkin, and the Struggle for the Genocide Convention David M. Crowe In 1947, Pearl S. Buck, one of the United States’ most prominent authors and social activists, joined forces with Raphael Lemkin, a Polish-Jewish lawyer who had fled Poland in 1939 and later settled in the United States, to try to convince the new United Nations to adopt a convention that declared genocide a crime under international law. Unlike Buck, who had won Nobel and Pulitzer prizes for her literary works, Lemkin, who came to the United States in 1941, was relatively unknown until he published his book Axis Rule in Occupied Europe in late 1944. It quickly gained a wide audience, particularly chapter 9 of the book, which coined and defined the crime of genocide. Buck, who had written widely about Japanese crimes in China during the war, was quite aware of the genocidal nature of such crimes, so when Lemkin asked her in 1947 to draft a memo that he would use to convince UN members to adopt a Genocide Convention, she readily agreed. Over the next eighteen months, she personally contacted a number of prominent international figures about the importance of adopting the Genocide Convention, and wrote articles for newspapers in the United States and Europe about its importance. After its adoption in 1948, she nominated Lemkin for the Nobel Peace Prize, and later wrote that 11\n\n12\n\nDavid M. Crowe\n\nshe was proud of all that she had done to help convince others of the importance of the convention’s adoption. She did so, she added, not only because of the importance of the convention but also her deep respect for Lemkin. At a distance, Buck and Lemkin would seem to have little in common, given the former’s life in China and the latter’s birth and early career in tsarist Russia and interwar Poland. Yet they shared a distant background that would partially play a role in the campaign they both helped wage to convince the United Nations to adopt the Genocide Convention in 1947–48. Both, in different ways, were refugees from war-torn East Asia and Eastern Europe. They were also gifted linguists and writers who were deeply committed to human rights in the broadest sense of the word. Buck left China in 1934 and Lemkin fled Poland seven years later in the face of the Nazi onslaught against that country, ultimately settling in the United States in 1941. Lemkin, a lawyer by training, had long been concerned about the impact of modern industrialized war on various ethnic groups. In the fall of 1933, he presented a paper at an International Conference for the Unification of Criminal Law in Madrid that drew on earlier works by prominent international jurists such as Vespasian Pella who called for new international laws against “crimes of barbarity” and “crimes of vandalism” that could cause “a common danger.” Lemkin’s paper embraced Pella’s ideas but also went further and discussed crimes that were both “attacks against individual human rights” that “relate to the relations between the individual and the collectivity.” The most serious of such crimes, he went on, were “acts of extermination directed against the ethnic, religious or special collectivities whatever the motive (political, religious, etc.), for example massacres, pogroms, actions taken to ruin the economic existence of the members of the collectivity, etc. Also belonging in this category are all sorts of brutalities which attack the dignity of the individual in cases where these acts of humiliation have their source in a campaign of extermination directed against the collectivity in\n\nBuck, Lemkin, and the Struggle for the Genocide Convention\n\n13\n\nwhich the victim is a member.” 1 Such acts, he added, were offenses “against the law of nations” that should be called “barbarity.” 2 He went on to discuss acts of vandalism, which he described as the “systematic and organized destruction of the art and cultural heritage” of a collectivity that presented its “unique genius and achievement.” 3 He then proposed legislation that, among other things, made it an “offense of barbarity” to commit “an action against the life, the bodily integrity, liberty, dignity or economic existence of a person belonging to such a collectivity (racial, religious, social).” He added that the “offense of vandalism” also be considered a crime if it resulted in the destruction of “works of cultural or artistic heritage.” 4 Though little came of these ideas at the time, they provided Lemkin with the nucleus of his later writings on war crimes and genocide. Buck, of course, was keenly aware that such crimes had been committed by the Japanese in China during the long conflict there from 1931 to 1945, though there is no indication that she was aware of Lemkin’s ideas. In late January 1932, for example, the Japanese military initiated “the world’s first air raid on an unprotected civilian target the size of Shanghai, setting the precedent for Guernica and the Second World War.” 5 This was followed five years later by the formal Japanese invasion of China, which triggered the War of Resistance or Sino-Japanese War, a conflict that still haunts Chinese-Japanese relations. Though estimates vary, approximately fourteen to sixteen million Chinese died in this conflict,6 while thousands of others suffered from unspeakable Japanese crimes and atrocities. The mass rape of Chinese women in Nanjing in late 1937 and early 1938 was only the “tip of the iceberg,” so to speak, of such crimes. The mass execution of civilians was commonplace, while tens of thousands of Chinese women were forced to become “comfort women” for the Japanese military.7 One Nationalist official, Chuang-Ying Hsu, was stunned by the “action(s) of Japanese soldiers towards women,” something “we can never dream of in [sic] this civilized world. The Japanese\n\n14\n\nDavid M. Crowe\n\nsoldiers—they are so fond of raping—so fond of women, and that one cannot believe.” 8 The Japanese also conducted cruel human biological experiments on captives and used chemical weapons during the war. In the fall of 1940, for example, Japanese planes dropped wheat that contained “plague-infected fleas” on the city of Ningbo in southern China.9 Pearl Buck wrote Eleanor Roosevelt in the summer of 1940 about what she called Japan’s unspeakable “barbaric invasion” of China. She hoped that Mrs. Roosevelt would consider contributing to the Women’s Committee of Tribute to China to help send medical supplies to save “the lives of thousands of Chinese woman and children.” Those who contributed to the fund would have their names inscribed in a Book of Hope, whose introduction spoke about the need to protect the “dignity and rights of human personality” that was threatened by the “destructive force” of “despotism in the world.” 10 She also addressed these crimes in several of the novels she wrote about China during the war. The first, The Patriot (1939), deals with the life of I-wan, the son of a wealthy Shanghai banker, and his involvement in the major upheavals that swept China in the 1920s and 1930s.11 She ends her second, and perhaps most poignant wartime novel, Dragon Seed: The Story of China at War (1941), with Lao Er, the son of the novel’s principal character, Ling Tan, answering his father’s question about whether there was a promise of rain: “Only a promise,’ ” Lao Er responded.12 She then begins the third book, The Promise, by writing that “in their despair men must hope, when a promise is given, though it is only a promise.13 The Promise (1942, 1943), deals with Chiang Kai-shek’s failed efforts working with the British in wartime Burma. Though only a novel, Dragon Seed describes in shocking detail Japan’s cruel treatment of the Chinese people during the War of Resistance. Over time, the Japanese found themselves bogged down in a war of attrition and by 1941 only controlled the important eastern parts of the country. The Japanese set up a collaborationist\n\nBuck, Lemkin, and the Struggle for the Genocide Convention\n\n15\n\ngovernment (the Government of National Salvation) under Wang Jingwei, a former ally of Chiang Kai-shek, in Nanjing (the old Nationalist capital), which called itself the Republic of China. Bold Chinese resistance (both Nationalist and Communist) played an important role in limiting Japan’s efforts to conquer all of China and ultimately helped defeat the Japanese.14 Dragon Seed begins months after Japan invaded China after the Marco Polo bridge incident outside of Beijing in early July 1937. After quickly taking Beijing, the Japanese moved southward, taking Shanghai after a three-month campaign against Chiang Kai-shek’s forces. They then moved westward to take Nanjing.15 It is at this point that a peddler tells Ling Tan, the principal character in Dragon Seed, that the “East-Ocean dwarfs” (the Japanese) had “killed men, women and children” in the north.16 This is a hint of what is to come, though in the early chapters of Dragon Seed Buck deals principally with the bucolic simplicity of the life of Ling Tan’s family.17 This soon changed as Japanese troops entered their village en route to Nanjing. At first, the villagers were only concerned about the “flying ships” that were bombing nearby Nanjing. Next came a flood of refugees, followed by the Japanese. Before they arrived, Ling Tan called the villagers together and they agreed that, being a “defenseless” village, they should greet the conquerors “courteously.” 18 Heartened by Japanese leaflets that promised villagers that they had nothing to fear from their troops, their hope soon turned to horror after they watched Japanese soldiers attack village elders with their bayonets. More shocking was the mass rape of an elderly woman, a crime repeatedly discussed in the novel. Ling Sao, Ling Tan’s wife, soon discovered, after listening to the stories of many of the female refugees, that the savage, brutal rape of Chinese women was commonplace in any area under Japanese control.19 Soon, these distant crimes reached the village. After occupying it, the Japanese demanded that all of the female refugees who had fled to Tan’s house had to come with them, or suffer the consequences. After a lot of fearful soul searching, the refugee women went with the Japanese\n\n16\n\nDavid M. Crowe\n\ntroops and became “comfort women” who were continually raped by Japanese soldiers.20 Ling Tan’s family soon fell victim to these crimes after his daughter-in-law, Orchid, innocently ventured into Nanjing, where she was gang-raped and strangled to death by five Japanese soldiers.21 As conditions worsened, Ling Er, one of Ling Tan’s sons, convinced the villagers to do what they could to resist the Japanese. This included refusing to grow certain crops and storing weapons for Chinese guerillas in the nearby hills. The book ends in 1941 with Ling Tang and his family crushed by the weight of Japanese rule. All that remained, in terms of hope, was “Only a promise.” 22 Dragon Seed provided American readers with a graphic picture of the crimes committed by the Japanese in China. The “Rape of Nanjing” had been fully covered by the press in 1937–38, and came to symbolize the cruelty of the Japanese occupation. It also stirred a deep hatred of the Japanese that was further inflamed after Pearl Harbor. Although rape is an eternal crime of war, it took on new meaning in World War II because it was used in Asia and Europe to deeply humiliate an enemy. It is estimated, for example, that Soviet troops raped as many as two million German women after they entered Reich territory in early 1945.23 The Germans committed equally ghastly crimes throughout Europe. The worst of these was the mass murder of six million Jews in ghettos, concentration camps, and death camps. It was stories of these crimes that motivated Lemkin to move beyond the ideas he proposed in 1933 and later call for a more robust body of war crimes law that would be enshrined in international legislation designed to outlaw them. Part of what motivated him was the rise of Nazism and Hitler’s adoption of stringent anti-Semitic laws and decrees that gradually stripped Reich Jews of their most basic rights and freedoms. Yet any distant concerns Lemkin had about what was taking place in Germany became deeply personal after Hitler invaded Poland in the fall of 1939. Lemkin, who fled to Sweden weeks after the invasion, left his parents and a large extended family\n\nBuck, Lemkin, and the Struggle for the Genocide Convention\n\n17\n\nbehind, most of whom were murdered by the Nazis in Treblinka or Auschwitz.24 Lemkin spent a year in Sweden where he collected documents on German occupation policies in Europe. In early 1941, he was invited to teach at Duke University’s law school and later moved to Washington where he worked as a consultant for the Board of Economic Warfare and the Foreign Economic Administration. In June 1944, he tried to get a position with the Office of Foreign Economic Administration as a consultant on continental law.25 Later that year, he published his seminal work, Axis Rule in Occupied Europe: Laws of Occupation, Analysis of Government, Proposals for Redress. For the most part, Axis Rule is Lemkin’s analysis of the large collection of documents that he had been gathering on Nazi and Italian occupation policies in Europe. Part 1, “German Techniques of Occupation,” looks at the German administration in occupied areas, and the Nazi use of police, law, and the courts to seize or control property, finance, and labor.26 Chapter 8, “The Legal Status of Jews,” briefly discusses their “special status” throughout Nazi-occupied Europe, followed by chapter 9, “Genocide.” The second part of his study, “The Occupied Countries,” deals specifically with general German and Italian occupation policies in various countries throughout Europe, while part 3 covers the specifics of occupation in each of these countries. For the most part, Axis Rule is usually read and studied only in the context of Lemkin’s brief chapter 9 on genocide. In part 1, “Genocide—A New Term and New Conception for Destruction of Nations,” he defines genocide as “the destruction of a national or ethnic group.” He then discusses the two phases of genocide, explaining that they involve the “destruction of the national pattern of the oppressed group,” and the “imposition of the national pattern of the oppressor.” 27 And though he thinks that such practices were normally described as “denationalization,” he argues that this interpretation often was used simply to describe the “deprivation of citizenship.” He also considers it inadequate because it did\n\n18\n\nDavid M. Crowe\n\nnot “connote the destruction of the biological structure,” or the “imposition of the national pattern of the oppressor.” Genocide, he explains, was the “antithesis” of the Rousseau-Portalis Doctrine, which was “implicit in the Hague Regulations,” particularly Hague IV (1907). According to this doctrine, war was aimed against “sovereigns and armies, not against subjects and civilians.” According to Lemkin, the current war in Europe was not just against “states and their armies, but against peoples.” Hitler’s concept of genocide, he adds, was based on “biological patterns,” not cultural ones. Some groups such as the Jews were “to be destroyed completely.” 28 In part 2 Lemkin discusses the eight “techniques” of genocide— political, social, cultural, economic, biological, physical, religious, and moral—and provides specific examples from various countries occupied by the Nazis, particularly Poland, to underscore the effectiveness of such “techniques.” He is extremely sensitive to Nazi policies against Jews and Christian Poles, particularly with cultural, religious, and economic issues. The Nazis, he adds, used biological and physical methods to depopulate and annihilate certain groups throughout Europe, particularly through forced malnutrition. They also practiced systematic religious persecution to destroy the idea of “religious leadership.” 29 In part 3 Lemkin proposes that with the end of the war in sight, amendments should be made to the “Hague Regulations [Hague IV, 190730] expressly to prohibit genocide in any war which may occur in the future.” Such amendments, he argues, must “consist of two essential parts: in the first should be included every action infringing upon the life, liberty, health, corporal integrity, economic existence, and the honor of the inhabitants when committed because they belong to a national, religious, or racial group; and in the second, every policy aiming at the destruction of the aggrandizement of one of such groups to the prejudice or detriment of another.” 31 He adds that genocide was not just a problem “of war but also of peace,” particularly in Europe, where minorities were continually being persecuted, both at home and abroad. He\n\nBuck, Lemkin, and the Struggle for the Genocide Convention\n\n19\n\nadvocates the creation of an “international multilateral treaty” that would provide strong legal protections for minority groups in each country. The signatory powers of such a treaty would also agree to include such provisions not only in their constitutions and criminal laws but also “penalties for genocide practices.” 32 Lemkin’s book created a bit of a stir in the United States because it came out just as Washington was giving serious consideration to the creation of a special tribunal to try German war criminals. Though the major powers had warned Germany and Japan’s leaders that they would be held legally accountable for war crimes committed by their troops, with the exception of the work of the United Nations War Crime Commission, little attention was given to this matter until it became apparent in the fall of 1944 that Germany would soon be defeated. The question of trying major German war criminals was closely linked to concerns about the nature of the Allied occupation of Germany once the European war was over. One of the first major proposals about the occupation was drawn up by Henry Morgenthau, Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s secretary of the treasury, in response to a State Department memo that argued for maintaining German unity and rebuilding German industry to ensure a “minimum standard of living” for the German people and enhance Germany’s ability to pay reparations and restitution. Instead, Morgenthau proposed that postwar Germany be transformed “into a primarily pastoral community” too weak to threaten Europe and the world.” 33 This idea was actively supported by the Society for the Prevention of World War III (SPWW3), which was made up of prominent, influential public figures in the United States. In the fall of 1944, the SPWW3 initiated a major campaign to convince the American public and US leaders to adopt Morgenthau’s plan. One of these figures was Pearl Buck, who was a member of the organization’s advisory board. In this role, she was asked to do everything possible to convince the US government to adopt stringent policies toward postwar Germany. As part of its national campaign, the SPWW3\n\n20\n\nDavid M. Crowe\n\nalso urged “commentators like Walter Winchell to ‘popularize’ the word ‘genocide’ to describe Nazi crimes.” It also urged the release of documents that confirmed “the Nazis’ unprecedented ‘campaign of terror and brutality.’ ”34 Pearl Buck saw all of this from a different perspective. A passionate advocate for civil and human rights in the United States, she saw international plans at the end of World War II, particularly what she considered “imperialistic” efforts to restore lost colonial empires, as a “return to the racial status quo,” which, if allowed to go forward, could cause World War III. She warned that if these colonial empires were restored then it would lead countries in Asia to turn “to Russia for leadership in the postwar struggle.” 35 At the time, Lemkin was involved in discussions about the creation of a tribunal to try Germany’s major war criminals. He wrote Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson soon after President Harry Truman appointed him chief US prosecutor for what would become the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal (1945–46), and suggested he read Axis Rule and a recent article he had written about genocide since they provided “some legal evidence as to war crimes.” 36 Lemkin was soon hired by the Pentagon’s War Crimes Office as a consultant for a prosecutorial “control squad” that would work on a sample trial brief. When this did not work out, Lemkin was chosen to work with Telford Taylor, one of Jackson’s top assistants, for “encyclopedic purposes in the War Crimes office.” 37 Lemkin, unfortunately, gained a reputation for being difficult to work with. In fairness, part of the reason was that he was plagued by nightmares and worries about the fate of his parents. He was also troubled by questions about the thoroughness of his research for Axis Rule. Regardless, he was ultimately sent to London where he was asked to work with the head of the Soviet delegation, Gen. I. T. Nikitchenko, and other organizations to gather further evidence on German atrocities in Poland.38 Lemkin, who was aggressively promoting his ideas about genocide, did everything he could to convince the prosecution to adopt\n\nBuck, Lemkin, and the Struggle for the Genocide Convention\n\n21\n\ngenocide as one of the charges in the Nuremberg indictment. Though his idea was rejected, it was included in Count Three, War Crimes, Section A, “Murder and Ill-Treatment of Civilian Populations.” The term was also mentioned during the trial by some of the prosecutors.39 Lemkin hoped this would help convince the judges to cite the term in their judgment, which they did not, even though the crimes they described in that section of the indictment dealing with the ill treatment of civilians certainly fit the definition of genocide: “In Poland and the Soviet Union these crimes were part of a plan to get rid of whole native populations by expulsion and annihilation.” 40 Disappointed, Lemkin was extremely critical of the outcome of the trial, calling it “wholly insufficient.” 41 Frustrated, he now turned his energies to the new United Nations, which was meeting at Lake Success in Long Island. He mounted a campaign to convince UN delegates to adopt a resolution that would recognize that genocide was a crime in international law, and he asked member states to begin the process of preparing a draft convention for consideration by the General Assembly. After considerable discussion in the UN’s Sixth (Legal) Committee,42 the General Assembly adopted two interrelated resolutions on December 11, 1946. Resolution 95(1) asked the Committee on the Codification of International Law (later the International Law Commission) to formulate “in the context of a general codification of offences against the peace and security of mankind, or of an International Criminal Code, of the principles recognized in the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal and in the judgment of the Tribunal.” Resolution 96(1) affirmed that genocide was “a crime under international law” that was “punishable.” It requested that the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) study the prospect of preparing a draft convention on genocide that “would be submitted to the next regular session of the General Assembly.” 43 In the spring of 1947, Lemkin was appointed to a committee of three prominent international lawyers (Vespasian Pella and Henri Donnedieu de Vabres were the other members) to prepare a draft\n\n22\n\nDavid M. Crowe\n\nGenocide Convention. Unfortunately, there were serious disagreements among Lemkin, Pella, and de Vabres about what should be covered in the draft, so they sent ECOSOC a wide range of options for a possible convention.44 Consequently, ECOSOC decided to ask the UN’s executive branch, the secretariat, headed by SecretaryGeneral Trygve Lie, to prepare a draft of the convention.45 It completed a new draft and submitted it to all UN member nations for further comment.46 Lemkin, now concerned about possible delays in the submission of a draft to the General Assembly, decided to give up his position with the War Department and move to New York, where he could mount a public campaign to ensure its adoption in a timely manner.47 One of the first people he turned to for help was Pearl Buck. At this point, it is difficult to gauge how well they knew each other. The New York Times and the New York Post had published numerous articles and editorials on Axis Rule and Lemkin’s efforts at Nuremberg and the United Nations, so she was well aware of his work.48 He only mentioned her once in his autobiography, but in a way that indicated they had been working together for some time.49 Lemkin also wrote that in “1945 and in subsequent years the contributions of individual women and of women’s organizations to the issue of genocide was considerable. . . . Unknowingly, they are the creators of moral philosophy for the benefit of every human being.” 50 This would certainly apply to Buck, whom one of her admirers wrote was an “ambassador-extraordinary for the cause of world peace and international understanding.51 Buck was extremely proud of her work with Lemkin, and Harris wrote in his biography of her that it was an example of her “interest in civil rights” that “held to the principle of equality for all.” 52 Lemkin first approached her in the summer of 1947 about writing a draft “manifesto” that could be used to convince UN members of the urgency of adopting the convention. The manifesto that she wrote stressed the urgency of a Genocide Convention, given the\n\nBuck, Lemkin, and the Struggle for the Genocide Convention\n\n23\n\n“recent genocide in Germany.” This was merely an example of similar crimes in history, she went on, while the “weak, the helpless, the innocent, wherever they are, live in continuing fear. The strong, the ruthless, the arrogant, can continue also, unless and until the principles of human decency are transferred into international attitudes, statements, and laws, providing for the effective protection of the weak, the innocent, and the helpless against the strong and the ruthless.” She added that “Life in our world is enriched by the diversity of cultures and ideas which proceed from variety in racial, national, and religious groups, even as a community is the better for variety in its citizens. The destruction of variety would be an intolerable loss to mankind, and there is no guarantee, moreover, that the surviving groups or group would be the best ones.” “Homicide,” she went on, is recognized throughout the world a punishable crime,” while genocide is “still allowed, condoned, and sometimes rewarded.” Yet in many ways, she added, genocide is a threat greater than war, for it is perpetuated in peace as well as war, it is contagious, spreading from one community to another, catching at fanatic fringes of the population and spreading like forest fire, through fear. Indeed, in the last war the victims of genocide were greater than the victims of war. It was now imperative for the global community to adopt a manifesto to remind mankind that human groups have the right to live in liberty and peace in accordance with other human individuals. Such free human groups, united by ethnical, religious, and cultural ties, are a great living force in civilization. The concept of the prevention of genocide envisages human groups in their organic entirety including physical existence, biological continuity, and the basic elements of spiritual life. The protection of the spirit is as important as the protection of the body.\n\n24\n\nDavid M. Crowe\n\nThe manifesto went on to say that the United Nation’s adoption of this “great and constructive principle” would reassure a world “divided by wars, misunderstandings, and uncertainties.” It is the “right of all human beings to live safely within the groups to which they have been born and to which they spiritually belong, and that the violation of this right, which is genocide, shall be held an international crime.” 53 Once the manifesto was completed, Lemkin asked Buck to “communicate with various world leaders” and ask them to support his efforts at the United Nations. What followed was a flurry of letters and wires from Buck to prominent international figures urgently asking them to sign the manifesto, which would be presented before the UN General Assembly with Lemkin’s proposal for official recognition of genocide as a crime. On September 3, 1947, Buck, along with Lemkin and François Mauriac, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1952, sent wires to Count Folke Bernadotte, the vice president of the Swedish Red Cross who played a key role in the liberation of prisoners in several concentration camps;54 Princess Julianna of The Netherlands (who became queen a year later); Paal Berg, the former chief justice of the Norwegian Supreme Court; the Norwegian writer Sigrid Undset, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1928; Gabriela Mistrala (Lucila Godoy y Alcayaga), the Chilean poet who received it in 1945; and Refling Hagen, a prominent Norwegian writer, asking that they send letters of support for the manifesto to the General Assembly.55 While these letters did help garner international support for the manifesto, it faced opposition from Great Britain and the Soviet Union. In meetings of the Legal Committee (LC) from October 1–6, Sir Hartley Shawcross, the British prosecutor at the Nuremberg trial, said that while he supported the idea that biological genocide was a crime, the convention went beyond this concept, thus creating “an entirely new body of international law.” If it was approved as written, he argued, “it would do more harm than good.” After\n\nBuck, Lemkin, and the Struggle for the Genocide Convention\n\n25\n\nconsiderable discussion, the LC voted to send it to Subcommittee 2 “to examine the procedure to be followed in considering the question of genocide.” 56 Initially, Lemkin and others saw this move as a tactic to delay action on the manifesto.57 But nine days later, Buck wrote Dr. Ricardo J. Alfaro, the Panamanian chair of the LC, praising the move and suggesting that the chair of the subcommittee be from China, a country that had a “high and fine record in regard to the treatment of human groups.” The letter, obviously written in consultation with Lemkin, then made a series of suggestions about changes in several of the articles. She added that people throughout the world, but particularly in the United States, “watch the work of the United Nations and long for great constructive measures.” She apologized for not meeting Dr. Alfaro personally to discuss all of this, but said she would be more than happy to meet him at his office. She also invited him for tea with her and her husband at their New York apartment. Dr. Alfaro wrote back that he would do everything he could “to secure prompt and thorough consideration of the draft convention.” 58 The new chair of the subcommittee was Tsiang Tingfu (Jiang Tingfu), the newly appointed Chinese ambassador to the United Nations. Buck had written him in mid-October seeking his support of Lemkin’s efforts to get the General Assembly to approve the genocide proposal. Tsiang thanked her for the letter and noted that “China has been in the vanguard of those who desire to see at all costs, a really living convention of genocide put into effect.” But he reminded her that even though genocide was “recognized and repudiated by all decent minded people,” its “prevention and punishment call for [a] careful and detailed definition of the crime” so “that nations or groups who would seek its perpetration, can find no legal loophole by which to justify their acts.” He also told her that he had been asked to chair Subcommittee 2, apparently unaware that she had nominated him for the position.59 On November 21, the General Assembly approved two resolutions (one from China) that asked ECOSOC to continue its work\n\n26\n\nDavid M. Crowe\n\non “the suppression of the crime of genocide, including the study of the draft convention prepared by the Secretariat,” and to report its progress at the next session of the General Assembly.60 A few weeks later, Lemkin asked Buck to send a new letter to twenty-two prominent intellectuals, writers, politicians, jurists, and academics, and share with them news about the United Nations’ decision. She wrote them that there were delegates who opposed the convention and, despite widespread support for it, “the battle is not yet won” since the secretariat’s draft convention was still being reviewed by UN member states. Buck also asked them to request their governments to urge the secretary general to expedite the “drafting of a final convention.” She included a copy of the resolution passed by Panama’s legislature supporting the convention, and included further information about the question of genocide “in the hope that you might find it possible to utilize it for arousing public interest in the subject.” 61 Lemkin approached Buck again in early 1948 and asked her to write an article for newspapers in Scandinavia and the United Kingdom about the convention. She responded that she had just sent letters to the editors of the Danish newspaper Politiken and the Manchester Guardian. In her “Letter to Denmark,” she said that when she lived in China she had always viewed Denmark as “a country of pleasant memory and of warm hope.” Her later visits there, she added, confirmed her sense that Denmark was a country of “humane common sense.” She was saddened when war swept through Denmark but was heartened by the brave Danish effort to save its Jews, the act of a nation that had always been “a leader in humanitarian affairs.” Consequently, she was pleased that Denmark was a member of the UN’s ECOSOC committee. She then defined genocide and explained why it should be considered an international crime. She was concerned, though, about legalistic criticism of the draft convention by some UN members. And while she thought that some of these concerns might have merit, she was fearful that such criticism might lead to delays in its adoption. She\n\nBuck, Lemkin, and the Struggle for the Genocide Convention\n\n27\n\nalso noted comments by Finn Seyersted, a member of Norway’s UN delegation, “that the Nuremberg Principles have to do with war,” while “genocide is a danger even in times of peace.” 62 For centuries, Buck went on, genocidal acts were always considered “affairs private to the nation,” meaning those who committed them were “not considered criminals.” Consequently, justice was often meted out via acts of revenge such as the murder of Enver Pasha, the Turkish leader responsible for the deaths of “hundreds of thousands of Armenians” during World War I. Such “single-handed justice is anarchical,” she argued, and now was the time to declare that individuals or groups who “commit genocide are guilty of [an] international crime.” She appealed to the people of Denmark to support efforts in the United Nations to adopt a Genocide Convention to ensure that the world was “safe for peoples of all creeds, races, nations, and cultures.” 63 Her more extensive letter to the Manchester Guardian heaped praise on the British for their sense of humanity and civilization, and said this was reflected in the fact that the head of the UK’s delegation to the United Nations, Sir Hartley Shawcross, took the lead in December 1946 to get the General Assembly to adopt Lemkin’s genocide resolution. She reminded British readers not only of the genocide of the Jews during the Holocaust, but also the genocidal murder of thousands of Haitians in the Dominican Republic in the 1930s. Such crimes, whether during times of war or peace, were threats to “humanity as a whole.” A “law against genocide,” Buck wrote, would have prevented Joachim von Ribbentrop from serving as German ambassador to the United Kingdom while his country was persecuting Jews. The same was true for the crimes of Enver Pasha, who walked the street of Tiflis (Tblisi), Georgia, as a free man before his assassination. She also restated Seyersted’s comments about mixing the laws of war with the laws of peace,” and added that “a world full of distress and anxiety cannot wait for security until lawyers have made up their minds about large codifications of international law.” From Buck’s perspective, the nature of genocidal\n\n28\n\nDavid M. Crowe\n\ncrimes, which took place during times of peace and war, demanded immediate attention and could not await the glacial deliberations of lawyers and others. She also pointed out the broad international support for the convention. She noted, for example, that there was a large body of UN material in the United Kingdom on the history of the Genocide Convention for those who wanted to know more about it, as well as Lemkin’s two principal works on the whole question of genocide— his 1946 article in American Scholar and Axis Rule in Occupied Europe. She ended by reminding readers of all that had been done by the British to alleviate the suffering of Christians during the Ottoman era, and hoped that once again the United Kingdom would lead the way “in this new humanitarian intervention, to prevent and punish genocide.” 64 Buck sent copies of these letters to Lemkin, who thanked her for them but mildly chided her for the way she used the word “genocide.” Apologetically, she wrote that she could “quite see that it should not be confused with mass murder.” 65 Buck also spent a lot of time in the spring of 1948 corresponding with diplomats and politicians she knew to garner support for the convention.66 In March, the ECOSOC’s Social Committee appointed an ad hoc committee made up of representatives from China, France, Lebanon, Poland, the United States, the USSR, and Venezuela to prepare a draft of the convention.67 Chaired by John Matkos, the US representative on the committee, it spent five weeks in April and May preparing a draft. Some of the early disagreements centered around the inclusion of political groups as possible victims of genocide and the question of cultural genocide. There were also questions about jurisdiction, and whether an international court should be created to handle such cases, or a criminal chamber of the International Court of Justice, which had been created in 1945. On April 28, the committee adopted a nine-article draft convention that included political groups, cultural genocide, and the jurisdiction of national courts or a “competent international tribunal.” 68\n\nBuck, Lemkin, and the Struggle for the Genocide Convention\n\n29\n\nSeveral days earlier, the new Committee for an International Genocide Convention had its first meeting in New York and asked Buck to join its campaign to garner further support for the convention. In late July, Lemkin learned that the ECOSOC would be meeting in Geneva in August to discuss the ad hoc committee’s draft. Worried about opposition from the British and the Soviets, and American opposition to the idea of cultural genocide, he flew to Geneva to do what he could to influence delegates about these issues.69 What he discovered was an intense British campaign to scuttle the convention. In a letter to Buck on September 7, he wrote that the British had tried to entice the American delegation to support placing the draft last on the ECOSOC’s agenda so that there would be little time to discuss it fully. At the same time, the British proposed that the convention be “divided in two parts.” The first would deal with physical genocide, which would be dealt with in connection with the codification of the Nuremberg Principles by the new International Law Commission (created by the UN to study the codification of international law). The second part would have the Human Rights Commission (which was preparing a Declaration on Human Rights) deal with the issue of cultural genocide which, Lemkin wrote, “does not deal with group rights at all.” In the end, he concluded, “the British won the Geneva fight.” 70 At its August 26 meeting, ECOSOC decided, in light of these differences, that it would send the draft convention and the minutes of its meetings to the General Assembly for further action when it met in Paris in September.71 Despite all of this, Lemkin concluded in his letter to Buck that “there are good chances to have the convention [discussion] in Paris,” although it was now important to do everything possible to “win the support” of as many delegates as possible. He concluded that “we have both decided to have a genocide convention and I hope we will have it in Paris with the help of noble friends.” 72\n\n30\n\nDavid M. Crowe\n\nOn September 24, the General Assembly asked the Legal Committee to study and report on the draft of the ECOSOC. What followed over the next two months were extremely intense meetings and discussions about the Genocide Convention. It still faced strong opposition from the British and at times the Soviets. The most intense discussions centered on article 2, which dealt with the groups that would be considered victims of genocidal acts. In meetings from October 7 through October 23, the committee decided to eliminate political groups and cultural genocide from the draft.73 Lemkin was extremely disappointed in the deletion of the latter and wrote that it left him with a “heavy heart.” But he was afraid to wage a new battle over this issue because it might “endanger the passage of the convention.” 74 On November 13, the Legal Committee appointed a subcommittee to prepare a final draft, which it completed ten days later. The LC sent the final draft to the General Assembly on December 3, and after several days of discussion voted unanimously on December 9, 1948, to adopt the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.75 Lemkin, who was present during the voting, was numbed by the outcome. It, for him, meant a “new partnership between two worlds: my own world of long, frustrating efforts, hopes, and agonizing fears, and this new official world which now made a solemn pledge to preserve the life of the peoples and races of mankind.” 76 Yet he also knew that this was only one phase of the struggle for the convention—next came herculean efforts to get individual states to ratify it. This was completed a little over a year after it was adopted, and on January 12, 1951, the convention came into force. Lemkin, who died in 1959, worked hard to convince the US Senate to ratify it, which it finally did on November 4, 1988.77 Pearl Buck was extremely pleased with the convention’s adoption and ratification, and she played a role in nominating Lemkin for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950. Lemkin thanked her for the\n\nBuck, Lemkin, and the Struggle for the Genocide Convention\n\n31\n\nnomination, and she wrote back that she was extremely pleased to do so. She was asked again to consider nominating Lemkin in 1958 (he was nominated for the Peace Prize in 1950, 1951, 1955, 1956, 1958, and 1959). She wrote him that she did not know when she nominated him for the 1950 prize that is was “impermissible for such winners [she won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1938] to nominate persons from other fields.” 78 She told US Representative Emmanuel Celler, who initiated the 1958 nomination, that she knew “Professor Lemkin and think very highly of him and his work.” In the end, Buck added, she “never regretted” the role she had played in supporting his efforts to get the United Nations to adopt the Genocide Convention.79 NOTES 1.\n\nRaphael Lemkin, “Acts Constituting a General (Transnational) Danger Considered as Offences against the Law of Nations,” 4. http://www.preventgenocide.org/lemkin/madrid1933-english.htm (accessed August 31, 2016). 2.

Buck would have felt at the election of President Barack Obama. It would have pleased her that a man of brown skin had finally achieved the highest political office in the land. During the 1930s and 1940s she had been an important voice in the increasingly vocal civil rights movement. As perhaps the most visible white member of the NAACP she had written for the organization’s magazine Opportunity, and Walter White, then head of the NAACP, had referred to her as one of the few prominent whites who really “understood” the plight of the black man in America. As she herself said, “I’ve a very close feeling for [the Negros’] situation because I remember what it was like to be considered inferior,” referring to her own upbringing as a girl in China where her white skin and blue eyes were not the privileged colors.1 She would undoubtedly have smiled when reflecting on the future president’s childhood: the offspring of a complicated multiracial union; raised in racially diverse Hawaii, with significant overseas time as a youngster in Indonesia, a majority Muslim country 35\n\n36\n\nDonn Rogosin\n\nof Asia; yet in many ways molded by his mother and grandparents’ Kansan roots. However, as a filmmaker who had the joy of documenting her remarkable life and recording many interviews with individuals who had known her well plus scholars who had studied her life and writing, I began to speculate on what Pearl Buck would think about American foreign policy during the Obama presidency. What kind of role had her extraordinary prolific career as a public intellectual and spokesperson for Asia played in the evolution of American foreign policy? My cerebral journey was touched off by a comment that Jim Thomson made on camera during our production of East Wind, West Wind: Pearl Buck, the Woman Who Embraced the World. Jim’s mother, Margaret Thomson, was Pearl Buck’s best friend in Nanking (now Nanjing), and Jim called Pearl Buck “Auntie Pearl.” His career included posts as a member of the National Security Council, head of the Neiman Fellows at Harvard University, and advisor to presidents. While working for Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles, he said, “Pearl came to Washington to warn the State Department that a coup in Korea was imminent and that Korean democracy was at risk.” Few Americans knew Korea the way Buck did, and she was correct, for shortly thereafter a military coup toppled the government in a bloody episode that reverberates to this day. “To Pearl’s great credit she wanted to use her influence for what we call today ‘human rights,’ ” Thomson said. Human rights, as projected during Obama’s terms, was an ideal at the heart of Pearl Buck’s worldview but also central to Obama’s foreign policy. By that I mean emphasis on individual rights as separate from the rights of sovereign states; equality for women and special status for children; protections for the disabled, the disadvantaged, and refugees; a belief in international law and diplomacy exercised within international organizations; an emphasis on people-to-people exchange and nongovernmental organizations\n\nBuck and the Evolution of American Foreign Policy\n\n37\n\nthat promote transparency and democracy; the projection of soft power; and the building up of what today would be called civil society. When did all these ideas, lumped together nowadays under the umbrella of “human rights,” become essential elements of American foreign policy, and could Pearl Buck have had a role in its flowering, I wondered?\n\nLaying the Foundation American foreign policy had an immaculate conception in George Washington’s farewell speech to the nation. “Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none or very remote relations,” Washington declared. It was “unwise” to get involved in foreign entanglements, he cautioned.2 But soon enough there were foreign issues aplenty to deal with, such as Barbary pirates, the Napoleonic Wars, the War of 1812, and the national debt. The isolationist impulse became deeply embedded in both policy and practice from the very beginnings of the nation. The Monroe Doctrine in 1823 might be the fitting capstone to this early period, essentially telling Europeans, “hands off our hemisphere.” The corollary received equal standing: America wanted nothing to do with the convulsive machinations of the “Great Powers” during Europe’s turbulent nineteenth century. America’s main direction in the nineteenth century was westward. This expansionist policy had enormous consequences for Mexico, who saw half their territory incorporated into the United States, and a few scares for Canada as well. But, it pretty much stopped at the water’s edge—until, that is, near the end of the nineteenth century, when the United States swiftly put an end to imperial Spain, annexed the Hawaiian Islands, sided with seven other imperial powers in putting down the Boxer Rebellion in China, and demanded huge reparations from China. The experience of the Boxer Rebellion seems to have had a large impact on young Pearl because, even at an early age, she understood\n\n38\n\nDonn Rogosin\n\nthat the upheaval building in Asia could not be contained. Her Chinese tutor had cautioned that she needed to make her life as an American because the Asians would not be distinguishing between good foreigners—meaning in Pearl’s young eyes, Americans—and imperialistic ones like the British, German, Japanese, and other colonial powers that had taken advantage of Chinese weakness. Pearl was proud that her parents had immersed themselves in Chinese life, unlike those nearby neighbors living in the British and French enclaves situated on the hills above her town of Zhenjiang (then Chingkiang). “I was old enough to read history myself and to see that Chinese historians and English historians gave entirely different versions of not only the same events but that each despised each other as a lesser breed,” Pearl said. Certainly that was the opinion of President Theodore Roosevelt, who had described the Chinese as an “immoral, degraded, and worthless race.” 3 Roosevelt’s views were completely at odds with the missionaries’ views of the Chinese, which Harvard’s John Fairbank characterized as a “deserving people who could be saved for Christianity, but had a long way to go.” Pearl Buck combined in her upbringing the intellectualism of her brilliant, harsh father, Absalom Sydenstricker, who had made the first Chinese translation of the Bible, with the gentle, inclusive Christianity of her mother, who had been raised as a Mennonite. The location of their mission was fortuitous as well since Zhenjiang was a significant trading port at the intersection of the mighty Yangtze River and the Grand Canal, and the site of important historic conflicts between the Chinese and European powers. The squabbles, rivalries, and animosities among the foreign powers often were mimicked by the Westerners posted to China, whether missionary, businessperson, or minor government official. This remote but strangely cosmopolitan outpost of late-nineteenth-century Western civilization sensitized Pearl to the petty, often ignorant attitudes that incubated and also emotionalized the power struggles of nations.\n\nBuck and the Evolution of American Foreign Policy\n\n39\n\nTime and time again Buck’s humanistic appreciation of foreign peoples, rooted in her childhood years in China, surfaced in her concern that American policy was working against American interest. To her, with the Christian mindset of her upbringing, this was primarily due to a misunderstanding or lack of knowledge about other cultures, and not just different national interests. The theme of cultural misunderstanding appears often in her writing and speeches. That assessment, spawned in the immediate aftermath of the Boxer Rebellion and reinforced by her own experience at Randolph-Macon Woman’s College in Virginia (where her schoolmates seemed totally uninterested in her Chinese background), motivated her zeal to educate both Americans and non-Americans about each other’s culture. Indeed, even the missionary lifestyle of her parents, moving back and forth between China and America, sometimes by way of Russia and northern Europe, internationalized her from her earliest days. The multinational mixture of foreigners in China gave her a worldly outlook within the trappings of a simple missionary lifestyle. However, there was a certain irony in her positions because of the strong Southern Presbyterian missionary culture in which she grew up. After all, her home church was a branch of the Presbyterian Church that had split over the issue of slavery and come down on the side of the Confederacy. But then, that irony would be magnified much more in the son of a Southern Presbyterian minister who assumed the presidency in 1912. Woodrow Wilson was the single most important figure in helping establish the groundwork for the human rights agenda, but was primarily known for his most significant failures: the lost peace of World War I and the lost fight for America’s place within the League of Nations.\n\nIsolation Meets Reality Wilson’s route to an internationalist approach was foreshadowed in a 1906 speech in which he said, “Soon the shores of Asia and\n\n40\n\nDonn Rogosin\n\nthen autocratic Europe shall hear us knocking at their back door, demanding admittance for American ideas, customs, arts.” 4 In these words we hear the same morally superior tone that epitomized the emerging American approach to foreign nations, whether under Wilson or Presidents Theodore Roosevelt or William Howard Taft, a strand that found its most explicit presentation in Henry Luce’s championing of the “American Century,” and perhaps lingers still in the rhetoric about American exceptionalism. America supported the “Open Door” policy in China, not desiring territorial concessions but demanding access for our businessmen. Rather than joining the Great Power alliances, the American stance was to use foreign policy to advance American business interests in the belief that dollar diplomacy was the most effective diplomacy. A telling illustration of the convoluted impulses in American policy was in America’s decision to use the exorbitant reparation payments from the Boxer Rebellion indemnity for scholarships for Chinese students to come to America and study. The traditional fear of foreign entanglements was so strong that despite Wilson’s personal support for England during the early years of World War I, Wilson remained true to the isolationist-dominated mood of the American public. It took a series of shocks—including the sinking of American merchant ships, the famous Zimmerman telegram, and the realization that the fate of his deeply admired parliamentary democracy might hinge upon the United States entering the war—that somewhat reluctantly forced Wilson to commit American forces. Wilson’s struggle with the cunning victorious Allied powers of World War I is well documented, and his losing battle for a more generous peace has frequently (indeed, usually) been cited as sowing the seeds of the Second World War.5 However, Wilson’s Fourteen Points, his legalistic explanation of America’s war aims, doesn’t come close to the basic human rights agenda of the Obama\n\nBuck and the Evolution of American Foreign Policy\n\n41\n\npresidency. The Fourteen Points was mostly concerned with the adjustments of diplomatic processes and territorial issues to the benefit of the victors, with its final point the establishment of a League of Nations. For Buck, this formative epoch of American foreign policy was material to analyze and reflect upon. She had a helper in this regard in her brother Edgar. He had served with the League of Nations as an epidemiologist doing truly groundbreaking, historic work on public health issues. Pearl Buck cites her brother as educating her about the great tragedy of the American departure from the League of Nations, calling it “at worst a disaster and at best a postponement of . . . common sense.” 6 Although Edgar died in the 1930s, it was not before playing an important role in the establishment of Social Security legislation and helping his increasingly prominent sister realize the critical importance of international institutions for the future world order. Of course, Buck’s views did not emerge in a vacuum. The very influential Carnegie Endowment for World Peace was created in 1910, and its leadership was instrumental in guiding Wilson’s thinking and that of others throughout the years between World War I and World War II. Clearly, the liberal thought of the time was a significant influence on Buck as she avidly absorbed the main currents of the new internationalism swirling again the tide of conservative, isolationist America during her Nanjing years. The core goal of internationalist thought from the initial Japanese attack on Manchuria in 1931 through the early 1940s, was to build a collective capacity in an international organization, an organization robust enough to deter war. In short, an organization with real power and not just a debating society. But it did not include an emphasis on human rights within its mission. Rather, it sought to rectify the perceived failures of the League of Nations, which had proved miserably inept in deterring Japanese, German, and Italian aggressive actions in the 1930s. Indeed, it was only when the immense horror of the Second World War, with its genocide,\n\n42\n\nDonn Rogosin\n\nits massive refugee creation, its enormous toll of predominantly civilian dead and injured became manifest that the human rights agenda took hold.\n\nThe Return to America When Buck returned to the United States in the 1930s, her agenda focused on genuine human rights: racial and gender equality, anticolonialism, and above everything else, supporting the Chinese people as they battled with Japan. Her particular interest was aiding refugees, not trying to fortify military positions or serving as an apologist for the Chinese government. Throughout the 1930’s, with China in the daily newsreels due to the ferocious conflict with Japan and the hapless Western response, and in significant measure because of Buck’s tireless efforts, American sympathy for China and the Chinese grew. According to Peter Conn, Pearl was extremely active in “almost all of America’s non-governmental dealings with China.” And, of course, with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, her views on China became even more sought after by opinion leaders. The powerful America affinity for China was not only of Pearl’s making. It was built on a long-standing American interest in China that had its origins in the increasingly important business ties during the nineteenth century and the missionary movement that flourished with increasing intensity in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth. Today American youngsters aren’t told to eat their vegetables and clean their plates because “children are starving in China,” but that expression became a cliché precisely because it was so often invoked throughout the twentieth century. (As a personal note, my mother fed me that line many times, along with a steady diet of Pearl Buck books in response to my request for something to read.) Raising money for Christian missionary work in China was a common Sunday church appeal.\n\nBuck and the Evolution of American Foreign Policy\n\n43\n\nHowever, it was Pearl Buck’s works—first the moderately successful novel East Wind: West Wind, followed by The Good Earth, then the movie version of the latter which won a Best Actress Academy Award for Luise Rainer in 1937, and finally the enormous publicity that resulted when Buck was chosen as the first American woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1938— that gave energy and passion to that affection. In Jim Thomson’s elegant expression, “She put a face on faceless China.” Pearl Buck’s commitment and devotion to the home of her youth never wavered. At first she helped to organize United China Relief, providing aid for the millions of Chinese refugees displaced by the Japanese/Chinese war, and building teaching hospitals behind the Chinese front lines. Later during World War II, Buck spearheaded the move to use the war as a rationale to repeal the racially motivated Chinese Exclusion Act of 1922. University of Michigan historian Harriet Mills, a daughter of Nanking missionaries, observes that Buck ran the campaign, financed the campaign, and celebrated the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act almost single-handedly from her office at the John Day Company headquarters on Broadway in New York City. Along with her husband, John Walsh, Buck took over and supported the influential Asia magazine, a monthly that, under their visionary leadership, sought to inform Americans about Asian developments and introduced Americans to such important future political and cultural leaders as Jawaharlal Nehru and Lin Yutang. Perhaps a more telling example of both her influence and relevance depended on the very strong bond between Buck and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Though they had met briefly in the 1920s, only after Buck returned to the United States in the 1930s did she begin a vital political friendship with Mrs. Roosevelt around their shared views on policy matters on race, gender, children, refugees, and developments in China and Asia. Most important, we know Mrs. Roosevelt communicated Buck’s insights directly to the president. One illustration of this occurred in the lead-up to the creation\n\n44\n\nDonn Rogosin\n\nof the United Nations where Mrs. Roosevelt played such a significant role in charting a course for the fledgling organization. It involved nothing less than the role China would play in the future United Nations. In the discussions about the makeup of the future U.N. Security Council, the United States wanted China to be included as a permanent member, but this was not the desire of the Churchill-led British wartime government, which already was thinking of Britain’s place in the postwar world. Would the British Empire, where the sun never set, be put back together, or would India, the African colonies, Malaysia, go their separate ways? Buck had been outspoken throughout the war years in pushing the view that the American war aims should be democracy, freedom, and especially independence for the former colonies of Britain and France, and these goals were most decidedly not the views of Winston Churchill or Charles de Gaulle’s French “government in exile,” for that matter. She refused to allow a war that she wholeheartedly supported to detract from her insistence that her racial and gender agenda not be delayed. In Peter Conn’s summation, “Pearl Buck seemed to be one of the few Americans who understood the elementary connection between the nation’s domestic behaviors and its foreign policy.” 7 The issue came to a head in 1943, when it became clear the Allies would eventually prevail and preparations for the post–World War II era commenced in earnest. At that time, the British wanted a Security Council without China. However, British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden reported that Roosevelt would be “suspicious” of any organization made up of only European and American countries, and that he (Eden) had “the strong impression that it is through the feeling for China that the President is seeking to lead his people to the concept of international responsibilities.” 8 Feeling for China? Who but Buck was most responsible for that feeling? She had burst upon the literary scene with The Good Earth at a time when the entire world was hungering for information about China. As John Fairbank observed, “it was at that point that\n\nBuck and the Evolution of American Foreign Policy\n\n45\n\nshe met up with history.” Simply put, the international community wanted to know much more about China, and it was through Pearl Buck’s eyes that they learned about the Middle Kingdom. For many decades after the publication of The Good Earth, Pearl Buck remained America’s most translated author after Mark Twain, a strong indication of her global impact. While the wartime Allies were debating and creating the future institutions of the postwar architecture, Buck was playing an informal role as advisor to her friend Eleanor Roosevelt, and by association President Roosevelt, on Chinese matters. Buck apparently had a good deal to do with raising President Roosevelt’s doubts about the long-term viability of the Chiang Kai-shek government. Buck felt instinctively that the Communists would win the war for the hearts and minds of the pragmatic Chinese peasantry. She was able to communicate with the president directly through personal letters about China that were requested by her good friend Eleanor Roosevelt. When Madame Chiang Kai-shek toured America in 1943, she received an overwhelmingly positive reception from her audiences: thirty thousand at the Hollywood Bowl and a joint session of Congress to which she gave an invited address, but not, interestingly enough, from President Roosevelt, who “couldn’t wait to get her out of the country.” His opinion was clearly reinforced by the twelve-page memo Buck sent Mrs. Roosevelt as a briefing on the Chinese situation, which included the recommendation that Chou En-lai’s views be solicited to better understand the real situation on the ground in wartime China.\n\nHer Hymnal Was Human Rights Pearl Buck used the wartime years to expand on her belief in what later came to called “soft power.” Perhaps the finest expression of this vision was her creation of the East-West Association, an educational and cultural effort that brought together Asians and\n\n46\n\nDonn Rogosin\n\nAmericans and was intended to promote understanding between East and West. Its activities included distributing reading lists to schools and sponsoring conferences and lectures. In short, it wasn’t overtly political. As Erik Barnouw, a participant in these activities, remarked, “she felt that the peace in the world in the future would depend on the extent the East and West could understand each other.” Buck simply said, “We are one world, and if we don’t know it, it’s dangerous.” In the euphoria resulting from the Allied victory in World War II her ideas were popular. But they quickly became less so once the Cold War took hold. And much of the recrimination of that period came down to the argument about how and why China was “lost.” If President Roosevelt was not seduced by Madame Chiang Kaishek’s fabled beauty and charm, he was very much aware of the American people’s interest in the fate of China. So too was his successor, President Harry Truman, who had to cope with the fallout from the Chinese Communist victory in 1949. As historian David McCullough noted, it was against the backdrop of a country that had developed its image of China in part from Buck’s popular writings that Truman tried to explain the loss of China.9 Truman commissioned a famous study of the events leading up the Communist victory, which squarely placed the blame on the nationalists’ corruption and incompetence and not the lack of arms or men. Poor Truman was confronted with a binary choice: accept the Communist victory or engage in a land war in Asia, a choice that also split his generals. The argument about who lost China was framed by the views of two children of China missionaries—Pearl Buck and Henry Luce. Luce, who had become America’s most important newspaper magnate, was as devoted to China as Buck, and he used his newspapers to push opinions that were diametrically opposed to Pearl’s. For Luce, the nationalist defeat was primarily due to the sowing of doubt about Chiang Kai-shek from China experts such as Buck and those she knew well in the State Department and within universities and even the military.\n\nBuck and the Evolution of American Foreign Policy\n\n47\n\nJames Michener observed that Luce, “with all his great power . . . had sided with Chiang Kai-shek . . . and he felt that anybody with any sense who didn’t follow him was a traitor or perhaps a communist.” His diagnosis was that some Americans had been deceived by the Communists and had weakened the anti-Communist forces. This had repercussions throughout the Cold War–dominated milieu of the 1950s, a time in America when Buck was among America’s most prominent liberals. Journalist Ross Terrill, who wrote the definitive book about Madame Mao, assessed it this way: “Pearl Buck was really a Confucian. . . . She did not think that Maoism amounted to what it claimed. In that sense, she was fundamentally against the Chinese communists,” but she knew Chiang Kai-shek far too well to defend him. Jim Thomson said, “It was to her great credit that she did not feel that our culture, and our politics, and our system had the answer for everyone else. Henry Luce never doubted it!” Along with other outspoken liberals of the 1950s, such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Buck’s friend Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, Buck went from the insider of the 1940s to a fringe public intellectual of the 1950s. In fact, she became a target for the FBI in the witch-hunting hysteria of the 1950s where her FBI dossier was two hundred pages long. Always quotable and readily available, her opinion that “the great thing Russia has created is an alternative to empire” didn’t help her during the dark days of the Cold War.10 Pushed from "
