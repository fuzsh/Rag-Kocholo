        "text": "Pearl S Buck though not Chinese, remained to be the only original source of China, for Americans and other world. Her fiction shows various aspects of China and Chinese life. They portray rural china, a revolutionary China, a changing China and also China at war. They depicts the Chinese migrant story his emotional psychological trauma. Her fiction made aware of the Chinese as human being to the other world who was just to be heathen for the western world. This paper in particular deals with the Chinese farmer which she has portrayed in novel The Good Earth. Pearl Sydenstricker Buck was, the first American woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, she wrote over seventy books in her lifetime, and she published several award-winning novels, including the Pulitzer Prize winner The Good Earth. This novel had the first literary representation of Chinese farmers not only for America but China also. Her work changed the image of the Chinese people in the American mind. China was a mysterious culture to many Americans, but to Pearl S Buck, it was the culture she had known so closely and intimately. Spending almost forty years of her life in China she had the firsthand experience of its culture, society and history. The image of China that she depicted in her works is much more real and valid than the exotic and strange images that were created on the basis of China town that prevailed during those days in America or those enacted by actress like Anna May Wong in Hollywood films. The Good Earth is a novel in the form of biography. The story follows Wang Lung's journey of life from his young man hood to old age. The narrator explains aspects of Chinese life revolving around Wang Lung, who barely manages to buy a very ordinary looking slave for his wife, bears three sons and a daughter, rises to the status of wealthy land owner through wrong means of theft, wants his children to keep his land forever but dies at a very ripe age with this desire unfulfilled as his children distribute the same land then and there while he is still on death bed. All along the novel, in the very fiber of the story she describes the Chinese tradition and culture, condition of farmers and women in society, religious practices, morality, necessity etc. Pearl Buck uses the inferior status of women in traditional China with great emotional impact. She has also focused on importance of family and showed it as the central unit of Chinese society\n\nThis paper observes the struggle for life of East Asia people that was portrayed in the novel The Good Earth. The Good Earth is also portrayal of a true account experienced by its author, Pearl S Buck. She got inspiration from the life of farmer in China. She wrote this novel using the original name as the main character. Those names are Wang Lung and O Lan. They are couple and their life is on farm. The objectives of this study are to find the pragmatic and sociological aspects of the Novel. This research applies content analysis approach to understand the pragmatic and sociological life in Chinese society, especially in the novel. The finding of the study shows that the utterances in the novel reflect various speech acts i.e. expressive, assertive, commisive, persuasive, directive, and phatic. In the sociological aspect, the life of rural people in Chine is somewhat similar with that of in Indonesia. Otherwise, rural people have life style in common i.e. working hard, struggle for life, defending their belonging, and loving the nature.\n\nWorld renowned authors Pearl S Buck (1892-1973) and Han Suyin (1917-2012) were both raised in China and had written extensively about the people and events of the land. Their autobiographies thus served as valuable references for modern China history. Many scholars have taken an interest in their literature due to their unique background as well as their gender. The proponents of post-Colonialism and feminism may suggest that Pearl's and Han's autobiographies were making political appeals, which could be divisive in nature. However, a closer textual reading of their texts denotes that their literatures were actually advocating mutual understanding and peaceful coexistence between the East and the West. This paper will examine the legitimacy issue, which is closely tied with the dilemmas, choices and identities of the characters in their autobiographies via the Ethical Literary Criticism (ELC). The implications of their autobiographies pave the way towards exploration of critical questions such as whether there would be a legitimate place for individuals of \" otherness, \" whether a people has the right to choose their own destiny, and whether a developing nation could earn the right to self-determine her own modernisation."
