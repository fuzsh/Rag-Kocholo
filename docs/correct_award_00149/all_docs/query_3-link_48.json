All these conditions help peonies stay away from disease problems. To arrange a seeding hole for a bare-root peony, dig the soil to a depth of 12-18inch. Work with garden tools to release the sides of the planting hole at the same time. It is very important and vital that the particular \"eyes\", or growth nodes, situated near the bottom of the old stem, end up no greater than Two inches under the soil surface area."
