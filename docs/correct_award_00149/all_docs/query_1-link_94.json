        "text": "Juan Manuel Santos, Kansas â€™73, is not the first Delta Upsilon to receive a Nobel Peace Prize. Three other DUs have been bestowed with the honor. In total, six DU brothers have won a Nobel Prize (in any category). Linus Pauling is the only person to be a sole recipient in two separate categories.\n\nDelta Upsilon is proud to boast six Nobel Prize recipients as members, four of whom have a Peace Prize. Per our research, we have found that 25 NIC, NPC or NPHC fraternities/sororities have members who have received a Nobel Prize as an individual.* Of these groups, none have more than two recipients in any category nor more than one Peace Prize recipient."
