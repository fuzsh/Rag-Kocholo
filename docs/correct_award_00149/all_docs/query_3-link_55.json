        "text": "The life of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Pearl S. Buck will be depicted through a new theatrical show titled Pearl, set to take the stage Aug. 27-30 at New York’s Lincoln Center.\n\nThe announcement was made today by Legend River Entertainment, a Beijing-based Chinese media company.\n\nThe show’s director and choreographer, Daniel Ezralow said, “[Pearl] is about the communication and transformation of curiosity.”\n\nPearl will be told in five symbolic stages — spring, river, flower moon and night — based on a poem written by Zhang Ruoxu. Each stage will represent a chapter in Buck’s life.\n\n“The creative collaborators that I have chosen have a worldly experience and minds that can be open to the marvelous possibilities of this show,” said Ezralow.\n\nAngela Xiaolei Tang, CEO of Legend River Entertainment, will serve as producer. Michael Cotton, whose work includes Michael Jackson’s This Is It, is the head of set and costume design. Other notable crew includes Howell Binkley, Jun Miyake and Mirada. American company Studiomusica USA will co-produce.\n\n“We want to produce a show which can help the international audience discover more about China,” said Tang.\n\nBuck’s life and novels bridge the gap between Chinese and American cultures. Her close proximity to Chinese culture — she spent her childhood in the country — influenced her novels later on. Over the past couple of decades, memorials and museums dedicated to Buck were created in China.\n\nThe Good Earth, Buck’s most popular novel, depicts a family’s life in a Chinese village before World War I. It was on the best-seller’s list for nearly two years and won a Pulitzer Prize in 1932. The book was also developed into an Oscar-winning film in 1937. Buck, who later won the Nobel Prize for Literature, is the first American woman to receive both awards."
