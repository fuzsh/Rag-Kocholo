Her parents, Absalom Sydenstricker and Caroline Maude were Southern Presbyterian missionaries who had travelled to China but came back to the United States for the birth of Pearl.\n\nWith so much commitment to their missionary work, Pearl’s parents went back to China when Pearl was just 5 months old.

In 1914, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa and became a member of the Kappa Delta Sorority.\n\nShe then got a position to become a psychology professor at alma mater right after completing her bachelor’s degree. One semester later, Pearl was forced to return to China after her mother fell ill.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIt was in China that Pearl met and fell in love with John Lossing Buck, who was an agricultural missionary.
