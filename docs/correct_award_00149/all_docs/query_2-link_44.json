        "text": "Pearl S. Buck (1892–1973) was an American author of literary fiction, non-fiction and children’s books. She won the Pulitzer Prize and the William Dean Howells Medal for her novel The Good Earth. Pearl was the daughter of American missionaries and spent much of her early life in China, which is where she set the majority of her novels and wrote about in non-fiction books. Following civil unrest in China, Buck returned to the United States in 1934. She also supported many causes, including civil rights, women’s rights and helping to establish Welcome House, the first international/interracial adoption agency. Buck was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1938, making her the first American woman to receive such an honour. She died in Vermont in 1973.\n\nPearl S. Buck became a published novelist in 1930 with the novel East Wind: West Wind. After a prolific career, her final published novel was 1974’s The Rainbow. Below is a list of Pearl S.
