        "text": "The Pearl S. Buck Advisory Committee and the Office of the President are pleased to announce the winners of the 3rd annual statewide Pearl S. Buck Writing Competition.\n\nLilah Coe from Herbert Hoover High School in Clendenin is the winner of the high school category. Coe’s poem, “West Virginia Is,” focuses on the various meanings West Virginia has. Esha Sachdeva from University High School in Morgantown won 2nd place for her poem “Our Garden” about valuing people of diverse backgrounds. As the high school winners, they have been offered a scholarship to the WVU Department of English’s West Virginia Writers’ Workshop.\n\nWVU student Regan Sands, an English major with a minor in Gender and Women’s Studies, takes home top honors in the undergraduate category. Sands’ winning entry was untitled and tells a story about the disconnect a person who leaves West Virginia may feel on returning.\n\nThe winner of the graduate category, Robin Harbrecht, is a student at Marshall University pursuing a M.A. in English. Harbrecht’s piece, titled “Endangered Species” compares and contrasts the lives of two mothers – one from the U.S. and one from Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe Pearl S. Buck Writing Competition is open to West Virginia students in graduate, undergraduate and high school categories, with top prizes awarded to entries in any literary genre that best reflect the life and values of author Pearl S. Buck. The full awards criteria, as well as full-text of the winning entries, can be found here.\n\nMelanie Page, associate vice president for creative and scholarly activity and chair of the competition’s awards committee, said, “All of the winning entries were inspiring. I found myself intrigued by the characters and narratives and very proud of our young West Virginia writers.”\n\nFor more information visit the Pearl S.
