        "text": "Join the Friends of the Bucks County Historical Society and speaker Samantha Freise for “Top Secret: The FBI File of Pearl S. Buck”, a presentation featuring a deep dive on the activism and life work of Pearl S. Buck through the pages of her FBI file.\n\nPearl S. Buck was an award-winning author, humanitarian, and activist. She is best known for “The Good Earth” (1931) the best-selling novel in the United States which won her the Pulitzer Prize in 1932. In 1938, Buck became the first American woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Buck co-founded Welcome House in 1949, the first international, interracial adoption agency, and in 1964 founded the Pearl S. Buck Foundation. However, her commitment to racial justice and association with many activist groups made her a dangerous character in the eyes of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In this talk we will explore the 300 pages of Ms. Buck’s FBI File.\n\nSamantha Freise is the curator at Pearl S. Buck House, a National Historic Landmark. She received a B.S. in Historic Preservation and B.A. in History from Southeast Missouri State University. She also graduated with distinction from the University of the Arts with a M.A. in Museum Education. Freise is also a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution in which she participates on the local, state, and national levels bringing awareness to historic preservation, American history, and service to veterans. She has a wide variety of experience working in museums and historic sites in Missouri, Pennsylvania, and the United Kingdom."
