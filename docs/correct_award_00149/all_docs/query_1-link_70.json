Buck was a writer, activist, and humanitarian, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Literature for her novel, The Good Earth, and the Nobel Prize in Literature for her body of work.\n\nThis catapulted her into the spotlight, which she used to create her platform of advocacy for marginalized people all across the world.\n\nThe Pearl S. Buck Foundation (now Pearl S. Buck International) provides life-changing aid for impoverished children, and promotes international and intercultural understanding.\n\nWe are honored to partner with the foundation to create a custom wall installation to honor donors to a capital renovation and expansion project.\n\nThe custom wall was created from a custom-cut wooden background, with brass plates, individual letters and graphics.\n\nInterested in a Donor Wall for your organization?\n\nWe continue to partner with non-profit organizations for their donor recognition needs, both locally and nationally. We excel at creating custom donor walls that merge your mission with your aesthetics."
