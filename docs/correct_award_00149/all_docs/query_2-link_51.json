        "text": "Pearl S. Buck was a writer, activist, and humanitarian. She was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Literature for her novel, The Good Earth, and the Nobel Prize in Literature for her body of work. Ms. Buck used the spotlight on her to illuminate the plight of marginalized people everywhere and to advocate for the civil rights movement in the U.S. She founded Welcome House (the world’s first international biracial adoption agency) and established The Pearl S. Buck Foundation (now Pearl S. Buck International) to provide international humanitarian aid. Ms. Buck’s groundbreaking words and work paved the way for greater international and intercultural understanding and provided life-changing aid for countless impoverished children.\n\nMission\n\nPearl S. Buck International provides opportunities to explore and appreciate other cultures, builds better lives for children around the globe and promotes the legacy of our founder by preserving and interpreting her National Historic Landmark home.\n\nVision\n\nThe legacy of Pearl S. Buck unites nations, societies, communities and individuals with an appreciation for cultural differences and a commitment to service.\n\nWe Believe\n\nAll children should receive education, nutrition and preventive health care to become self-sufficient.\n\nAll children should grow up with cultural competence to be successful in a global environment.\n\nAll individuals can improve conditions and resolve problems if they understand and appreciate cultural differences, establish relationships with people from other cultures and build strong alliances with different cultural groups.\n\nThe Pearl S. Buck House should inspire visitors to embrace and engage in continuing her legacy by making meaningful, lifelong contributions within the community."
