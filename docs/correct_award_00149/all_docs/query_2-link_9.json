        "text": "Pearl S. Buck was the very first American women to receive the Nobel Prize and the Pulitzer Prize. Buck won the Pulitzer Prize for best novel by an American author in 1932 for The Good Earth. In 1938, Buck won the Nobel Prize in literature for her portrayals of Chinese peasant life in several novels as well as for the biography of her parents (Buck, 1972). She held onto this prestigious distinction until 1993, when Toni Morrison was the second woman and first African American woman to receive both of these awards (“Toni Morrison”). Morrison was awarded the Pulitzer in 1988 for Beloved and Nobel Prize in 1993 for contributions to her field for literature (“Toni Morrison”). Morrison once commented on Buck’s writing “she misled me . . . and made me feel that all writers wrote sympathetically, empathetically, honestly and forthrightly about other cultures” (Conn, 1996). Morrison continues writing to this day and Beloved was regarded by the New York Times as the best work of American fiction for the past twenty five years (“Toni Morrison”)."
