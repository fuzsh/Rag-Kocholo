        "text": "FIRST EDITION OF PEARL BUCK'S CLASSIC, THE GOOD EARTH, IN RARE ORIGINAL DUST JACKET\n\nBUCK, Pearl S. The Good Earth. New York: John Day, (1931). Octavo, original gilt-stamped brown cloth, pictorial endpapers, original dust jacket. Housed in a custom cloth chemise and full morocco slipcase.\n\nFirst edition, first issue, of Buck's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about a Chinese farmer's sorrows and joys during the reign of the country's last emperor. An exceptional copy in scarce original dust jacket.\n\nHer greatest novel, The Good Earth, \"immediately became an international bestseller, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932, and made Pearl Buck's name a household word\" (ANB). She went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1938â€”\"the first American woman selected for Nobel recognition in any field. The award confounded early critical predictions of would-be publishers and literary agents, who warned that Western readers would take no interest in her fictional accounts of the ancient lands and peoples of Asia. Today her work is internationally acclaimed, and she remains one of America's most widely translated authors\" (Pribic, 66). First issue, with \"flees\" for \"fleas\" on page 100, \"John Day Publishing Company\" on copyright page. Old number on rear endpaper.\n\nBook fine, dust jacket near-fine with vertical crease to rear panel and light wear and toning to extremities. An exceptional copy."
