Is the actress best known for her roles in Lola… Once Upon A Time, Rebelde or Clase 406 really single again?\n\nUPDATE 21/07/2024 : This story seems to be false. (read more)\n\nValdéz spotted alone\n\nA fan spotted Grettell Valdéz walking alone, probably coming back from picking up her mail at the end of her several mile long driveway, on the afternoon of July 19, 2024. Was she all alone? “Definitely yes,” says the fan, adding that “She was wearing a large sweater and looked really cute!”\n\nIs Grettell back on the market?\n\nA rep for Grettell Valdéz was not immediately available for comment.\n\nTruth or rumor, when news that the actress - known for having been romantically involved with Patricio Borghetti - was splitting hit the internet Saturday (July 20), Twitter immediately exploded with pithy commentary. It seems everyone had an opinion on the matter:\n\n“Has anyone Grettell’s phone number?”\n\n— Mike Whedon (@mikywhedon) July 20, 2024\n\n“Hate to see Valdéz split up, but I thought the pairing was a little weird.”\n\n— AaronJ (@aaronjj) July 20, 2024\n\nBased on the facts (Valdéz spotted alone with a cute sweater), is there trouble in paradise or is it much ado about nothing?\n\n© 2024 MediaMass All rights reserved.
