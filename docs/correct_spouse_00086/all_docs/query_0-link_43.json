Is the actor best known for his roles in Teresa, Lola… Once Upon A Time or Rebelde really single again?\n\nUPDATE 21/07/2024 : This story seems to be false. (read more)\n\nBorghetti spotted alone\n\nA fan spotted Patricio Borghetti walking alone, probably coming back from picking up his mail at the end of his several mile long driveway, on the afternoon of July 19, 2024. Was he all alone? “Definitely yes,” says the fan, adding that “He was wearing a large sweater and looked really cute!”\n\nIs Patricio back on the market?\n\nA rep for Patricio Borghetti was not immediately available for comment.\n\nTruth or rumor, when news that the actor - known for having been romantically involved with Grettell Valdéz - was splitting hit the internet Saturday (July 20), Twitter immediately exploded with pithy commentary. It seems everyone had an opinion on the matter:\n\n“Has anyone Patricio’s phone number?”\n\n— Michelle Whedon (@mimiwhedon) July 20, 2024\n\n“So very sad… Those 2 were so great as a couple. So cute together.”\n\n— Crystal (@crystal_clear) July 20, 2024\n\nBased on the facts (Borghetti spotted alone with a cute sweater), is there trouble in paradise or is it much ado about nothing?\n\n© 2024 MediaMass All rights reserved.
