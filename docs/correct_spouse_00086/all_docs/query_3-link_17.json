It is a remake of the Argentine telenovela, Rebelde Way, adapted for the Mexican youth audience, leading to differences in characters' backgrounds. Rebelde originally aired from Monday, 4 October 2004, to Friday, 2 June 2006. It was replaced with Código Postal.\n\nRebelde is set in the Elite Way School, a prestigious private boarding school on the outskirts of Mexico City, with a major plot line revolving around six adolescent students – Mía Colucci Cáceres (Anahí), Roberta Pardo Rey (Dulce María), Miguel Arango Cervera (Alfonso Herrera), Diego Bustamante (Christopher von Uckermann), Guadalupe \"Lupita\" Fernández (Maite Perroni) and Giovanni Méndez López (Christian Chávez) – forming a band. Additional subplots involve the school's faculty and the students' parents. One trademark of the telenovela is the random use of English words and phrases, often used by fresa characters.\n\nAnother notable aspect is that the actors playing the band members are themselves in an actual group named RBD and perform most of the music used on the telenovela, including the opening theme song, \"Rebelde\". The group achieved international success from 2004 until their separation in 2009 and sold over 15 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling Latin music acts of all time.\n\nUnivision aired Rebelde weekdays afternoon at 3pm/2c from 21 March 2005, to 15 December 2006, replacing Corazones al límite. The last episode was broadcast on Friday, 15 December 2006, with Las dos caras de Ana replacing it on Monday, 18 December 2006.\n\nIn 2021, Netflix announced a reboot of the show, set for release the following year. The series, also titled Rebelde, was released on 5 January 2022, and is set 16 years after the end of the soap opera.\n\nCaesars Entertainment Group announced that Rebelde will take residence at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas for six months in June 2024.[citation needed]\n\nPlot[edit]\n\nThe Elite Way School is a private boarding school with international prestige where high-class students receive a high level of education to be prepared for a great future. The school has a scholarship program for people with low financial resources who have an excellent academic level. However, few even graduate since they are persecuted by a secret society called \"La Logia\" (\"The Lodge\"), whose purpose is to conserve the purity of the privileged class. Among the students are Mía (Anahí), Roberta (Dulce María), Miguel (Alfonso Herrera), Diego (Christopher von Uckermann), Lupita (Maite Perroni) and Giovanni (Christian Chávez). Six adolescents who, despite their differences, discover something that will unite them above all – their love for music.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nMain article: List of Rebelde characters\n\nStarring[edit]\n\nEnrique Rocha as León Bustamante\n\nJuan Ferrara as Franco Colucci\n\nNinel Conde as Alma Rey\n\nPatricio Borghetti as Enrique Madarriaga (seasons 1, 3)\n\nLeticia Perdigón as Mayra Fernández\n\nAnahí as Mía Colucci Cáceres\n\nDulce María as Roberta Alejandra Pardo Rey\n\nAlfonso Herrera as Miguel Arango Cervera\n\nChristopher von Uckermann as Diego Bustamante\n\nEstefanía Villarreal as Celina Ferrer\n\nKarla Cossío as Pilar Gandía\n\nZoraida Gómez as Jóse Luján Landeros\n\nJack Duarte as Tomás Goycolea\n\nMaite Perroni as Guadalupe \"Lupita\" Fernández\n\nEddy Vilard as Teódoro \"Téo\" Ruiz Palacios\n\nAngelique Boyer as Victoria \"Vico\" Paz\n\nRodrigo Nehme as Nicolás \"Nico\" Huber\n\nChristian Chávez as Giovanni Méndez López\n\nMichel Gurfi as Joaquín Mascaró (season 1)\n\nGrettell Valdez as Renata Lizaldi (season 1)\n\nMiguel Rodarte as Carlo Colucci (season 1)\n\nTony Dalton as Gastón Diestro\n\nHéctor Gómez as Hilario Ortiz Tirado (season 1)\n\nNailea Norvind as Marina Casares de Colucci (seasons 2–3)\n\nDerrick James as Santos Echagüe Robles / Santos Echague (seasons 2–3)\n\nDiego Boneta as Rocco Bezauri (seasons 2–3)\n\nMaría Fernanda Malo as Sol De La Riva (seasons 2–3)\n\nAntonio Sáenz as Iñaki (seasons 2–3)\n\nAllisson Lozano as Bianca Delight (seasons 2–3)\n\nViviana Ramos as Dolores \"Lola\" Arregui (seasons 2–3)\n\nRonald Duarte as Jack\n\nRafael Inclán as Guillermo Arregui (season 2)\n\nPatsy as Inés (season 3)\n\nAlso starring[edit]\n\nFelipe Nájera as Pascual Gandía\n\nPedro Weber \"Chatanuga\" as Pedro / Peter\n\nMaría Fernanda García as Alicia Salazar\n\nManola Diez as Pepa\n\nXochitl Vigil as Rosa Fernández\n\nGabriela Bermúdez as Elena Cervera de Arango\n\nAlejandra Peniche as Damiana Mitre de Ferrer\n\nLourdes Canale as Hilda Acosta / Profesora Hilda Bernard\n\nDobrina Cristeva as Yolanda \"Yoli\" Huber\n\nAbraham Stavans as Joel Huber\n\nJorge Zamora as Maurice\n\nAitor Iturrioz as Esteban Nolasco\n\nTiaré Scanda as Galia Dunoff de Gandía\n\nRoberto \"Puck\" Miranda as Cosme Méndez\n\nPatricia Martínez as Luisa López de Méndez\n\nCynthia Coppelli as Mabel Bustamante\n\nSalvador Julián as Carlos Velásquez\n\nLiuba De Lasse as Catalina \"Cata\"\n\nYessica Salazar as Valeria Olivier (seasons 2–3)\n\nGerardo Klein as Fernando Ferrer (seasons 2–3)\n\nLisardo as Martín Reverte / Octavio Reverte (seasons 2–3)\n\nLourdes Reyes as Julia Lozano (seasons 2–3)\n\nClaudia Schmidt as Sabrina Guzmán (seasons 2–3)\n\nAlfonso Iturralde as Héctor Paz (seasons 2–3)\n\nRoxana Martínez as Milagrosa (season 3)\n\nMiguel Ángel Biaggio as Javier Alanis (season 3)\n\nRecurring[edit]\n\nEleazar Gómez as Leonardo Francisco Blanco (season 2)\n\nFlorencia del Saracho as Romina (season 2)\n\nSpecial guest stars[edit]\n\nHilary Duff as herself[1][2]\n\nLa Quinta Estación as themselves\n\nLenny Kravitz as himself\n\nRicardo Montaner as himself\n\nTiziano Ferro as himself\n\nJosé Ron as Enzo\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Nominated Result 2006 Premios TVyNovelas[3][4] Best Telenovela Pedro Damián Nominated Best Lead Actress Ninel Conde Nominated Best Lead Actor Juan Ferrara Nominated Best Male Antagonist Enrique Rocha Nominated Best Co-star Actress Leticia Perdigón Nominated Best Co-star Actor Rafael Inclán Nominated Best Young Lead Actress Anahí Nominated Dulce María Won Best Young Lead Actor Alfonso Herrera Nominated Christopher von Uckermann Nominated Best Musical Theme \"Rebelde\" by RBD Won Best Direction Luis Pardo, Juan Carlos Muñoz and Felipe Nájera Nominated\n\nElite Way School uniforms[edit]\n\nCasual[edit]\n\nBoth girls and boys wear red sport jackets with matching ties, and long-sleeved white dress-shirts.

The production of the series conceived the idea of the musical group to promote both the characters and the show itself. The project quickly surpassed the telenovela in success, so much so that it can now be considered as a separate concept (as Erreway of Rebelde Way did in Argentina). The series was a great promotion for the group since it was able to reach all of Latin America, United States, and several European nations. The group is one of the most impressive in the Latin pop genre and has had great success in Hispanic countries, the U.S. and even Brazil, where the telenovela and the group were highly successful. The show's success was so great that during the third season, the producers decided to lengthen the time of the episodes to one hour and a half, being the first telenovela with such duration.\n\nMain songs[edit]\n\n\"Rebelde\" performed by RBD.\n\n\"Solo Quédate en Silencio\" performed by RBD.\n\n\"Malas Intenciones\" performed by Erik Rubín.\n\n\"Plástico\" performed by Natasha.\n\n\"Sálvame\" performed by Anahí (as part of RBD).\n\n\"Nuestro Amor\" performed by RBD.\n\n\"Aún hay algo\" performed by RBD.\n\n\"México, México\" performed by Anahí, Dulce María and Maite Perroni.\n\n\"Tras de Mí\" performed by RBD.\n\n\"Este corazón\" performed by RBD.\n\n\"No Pares\" performed by Dulce María (as part of RBD).\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
