The most popular girl and a queen bee at Elite Way School, she comes from a wealthy and privileged family who lives in Mexico City. Spoiled and self-centered, she, however, can be very loyal, attentive and tender towards those she loves. Her best friends are Celina and Victoria \"Vico\", but she's also very close friends with Lupita and Roberta. Mía starts RBD with her boyfriend Miguel and their friends Roberta, Diego, Giovanni, and Lupita, and acts as a songwriter for the band. She also loves fashion and acts as a stylist for her friends.\n\nMía falls in love with Miguel at first sight but keeps quiet since he starts dating her friend Celina. However, Mía is unaware that Miguel came to Elite Way in an attempt to grow close to her in order to exact revenge on her father, Franco, who Miguel holds responsible for his father's death. Despite her strong feelings for Miguel, Mía and Miguel argue constantly when they first meet. During this time, Mía briefly dates Joaquin and later starts a relationship with Gastón, who works at the school as a prefect and, knowing Mía and Miguel are interested in each other, tries hard to turn them against each other. Miguel is aware of Mía's relationship with Gastón and helps them protect their secret by telling Franco that he's dating Mía when Franco finds out about his daughter dating an older man who works at her school, even kissing her in front of her father, Gastón and the school's principal. They start dating and declare their love for each other, with Miguel growing increasingly divided between going through with his plans and letting go of his past and moving on with Mía. However, Mía uncovers the truth about Miguel's real reasons to approach her and, devastated, breaks up with Miguel. It is later revealed that Miguel's father's death was caused by Mía's Uncle Carlo. Miguel apologizes to Mía and her father and puts his past behind him. In the first season's finale, Mía surprises Miguel by joining him on his flight to Monterrey, where his family is originally from. In the second season, their relationship is more unified than ever, with only a few bumpy roads and short breakups. The couple takes a romantic trip to Cancun and grows closer when stranded on an island.\n\nIn the third season, problems hit the couple's path in the shape of Sabrina. Sabrina is the spoiled daughter of RBD's producer, whose crush on Miguel knows no boundaries. Sabrina's persistence in flirting with Miguel makes Mía jealous and puts a strain in their relationship; they eventually break up when Sabrina tells everyone she and Miguel slept together. In truth, Miguel got drunk and fell asleep; Sabrina snuck into his bed barely clothed and when he woke up told him they had sex.\n\nAfter their breakup, Mía grows deeply depressed. However, she finds comfort in her newfound friendship with Roberta, who is going through a similar rough patch with Diego and her mother. The two girls, who were at odds when they first met, grow close and start caring sincerely about each other. While struggling to come to terms with the end of her relationship with Miguel, Mía finds out that, instead of dying in a car crash like Franco told Mía, her mother is actually alive. Marina left her husband and toddler Mía because she was an addict, now she has recovered from her issues, she's back and wants a relationship with her daughter. At first, Mía is hurt and resentful that her father has lied to her about her mother for most of her life but eventually understands that Franco did that out of love for her trying to protect her from hurt and pain. Mía and Marina slowly form a relationship, bonding over the fact that Marina was also a singer when she was young, having passed her talent and love for the stage to her daughter.\n\nNear the end of the series, the truth between Miguel and Sabrina is revealed. However, since Miguel's in a coma, Mía blames herself for her harsh treatment of her boyfriend and pleads with him to wake up and come back to her. He eventually does during one of her daily visits to him, but as a consequence of his coma, he has memory problems and can only remember he has a girlfriend. When Mía asks him who is his girlfriend's name, he mistakenly says Sabrina, leaving Mía once again heartbroken and depressed. He finally remembers everything about Mía and their relationship during an RBD concert, while Mía's singing 'Sálvame', a song she wrote for him, Miguel decided to leave Mexico City and go back to his family in Monterrey. They finally talk when he's packing for his trip, with Miguel telling Mía that her song brought his memory back. Mía tearfully pleads with Miguel not to leave, saying she can't live without him; Miguel starts crying and they kiss, making up for good.\n\nMía's family grows at the end of the series: Franco marries Roberta's mother, Alma, and together they adopt Roberta's best friend, Jose Luján. Miguel proposes to Mía before the graduation ceremony at Elite Way, and she say yes.\n\nRoberta Alexandra Maria Reverte Rey[edit]\n\nRoberta ReverteRebelde characterPortrayed byDulce MaríaFirst appearanceOctober 4, 2004Last appearanceJune 2, 2006Created byCris Morena\n\nIn-universe informationOccupationStudent(former) singer(present)ParentsMartín Reverte (father)\n\nAlma Rey (mother)\n\nFranco Colucci (step-father)SiblingsMia Cáceres Colucci (step-sister) Jose Luján(step-sister)HusbandDiego Bustamante\n\nPlayed by: Dulce María\n\nMost likely the most rebellious student in Elite Way, Roberta is the only daughter of Alma Rey (Ninel Conde), a famous singer who gave birth to Roberta when she was very young, supposedly with her first husband, Mr. Pardo. However, Roberta eventually finds out that her biological father is Martín Reverte, a teacher at Elite Way, who joined the school in order to find his child. Roberta is a reckless, strong young girl with a short temper and a big heart. She has the tendency to find problem wherever she goes, not only for herself, but for others too, but she always finds inventive ways to work her problems out. She's the co-female lead of RBD along with Lupita and Mia, with whom she at first has a difficult and conflicted relationship (Roberta thinks Mía's too ditzy, dumb and shallow). Her best friends are her roommates, Lupita and Jose Luján.\n\nRoberta recruits a popular and handsome classmate, Diego Bustamante, to the band she's forming with Mía, Miguel, Lupita and Giovanni, but, in order to keep Diego's father León from finding out about the band, and to give Roberta an excuse to blow her mother off, they pretend they're dating. However, her strong personality and short fuses lead to a volatile relationship, with Roberta and Diego fighting a lot and hating each other. But, eventually, they fall deeply in love, although they both fight against their feelings and refuse to admit to it. They finally start dating for real, but eventually break up.\n\nIn season one, Roberta leaves against her will for a month in Spain with her adoptive father and is angry at herself when she spends a lot of time thinking about Diego. However, when she comes back, Diego has a new girlfriend: Paola, who really is a prostitute hired by León Bustamante to keep Diego away from Roberta, who León sees as inadequate for his son. After Diego breaks up with Paola, he makes a bet with his friends that he'll get Roberta to date him, and is successful. His friend Tomás tells Roberta the truth, and she dumps him, furious and heartbroken with his lie. However, Diego has sincerely fallen in love with Roberta during their relationship and tells her so, but she doesn't believe him.\n\nTo get Diego out of her head and her heart, Roberta becomes a serial dater throughout the series: she has relationships with Joaquin, Teo, Simon, Roger, Iñaki and Javier, who is Diego's nemesis and León's girlfriend's son. Javier actually helps León keep Diego away from Roberta, although he claims he wants to date her only to break her heart since she publicly humiliated him by turning him down. However, during this time Roberta and Diego become real friends, with Roberta helping Diego sort out his issues and solve his problems. Diego is outspoken about his love for Roberta, telling her he loves her whenever he has a chance; Roberta, however, won't confess to feeling the same.\n\nDuring the third season, Roberta and Alma's unstable relationship explodes when Martín Reverte is revealed as Roberta's father. Roberta finally admits she's hurt that her mother was always away, working when she was a child and didn't have time to be with her. She also admits that she was hurt that Alma acted more as a sister than as a mother when she was growing up. However, with Martín's help, she starts realizing that her mother truly loves her, and did everything there was in her power to give her the best life she could.\n\nIt's during this time that Roberta finally becomes friends with Mía, with Mía telling Roberta Alma and Franco are dating (and plan on marrying), and Roberta comforting Mía during her relationship problems with Miguel. It's Roberta who explains to Miguel why Mía was so hurt when Miguel said his girlfriend was Sabrina (after waking up from his coma). After a rocky patch in their relationship (Jose was jealous of Roberta having a growing family), best friends Roberta and Jose finally work out their problems and become family when Alma and Franco decide to adopt Jose.\n\nRoberta also helps Diego break free of León's toxic influence and orchestrates Diego's mother Mabel's return from abroad. León forced Mabel to abandon their house and their son, and Roberta secretly works to bring Mabel back to Diego's life. When Roberta tells him what she has done, he's stunned and demands her reasons for it. Roberta finally admits that she did it because she loves him, and they make up for good. During Franco and Alma's wedding reception, Roberta and Diego discuss their nervousness about sex, with Diego anxious because Roberta's supposedly more experienced than he is (he has some experience, but she has dated more than he has). Roberta shyly admits she's a virgin, and the couple happily decides to take their time before that step.\n\nMiguel Arango[edit]\n\nMiguel ArangoRebelde characterPortrayed byAlfonso HerreraFirst appearanceOctober 4, 2004Last appearanceJune 2, 2006Created byCris Morena\n\nIn-universe informationOccupationStudent(former) Businessman(present)ParentsElena Cervera (mother)SiblingsLoli Arango (sister)SpouseMia Colucci( wife)\n\nPlayed by: Alfonso Herrera\n\nMiguel Arango is a noble, down to earth, handsome, but \"short-fused\" young man. He is originally from Monterrey, Nuevo León (Mexico) which is where his mother and younger sister live in, but he can never afford to visit because his family is not very wealthy. Miguel is on a half scholarship causing him to be harassed by a secret society of students known as \"La Logia\", a sort of gang or mob organized to eliminate the \"becados\" (students with scholarships). He is in the Elite Way School to get revenge on Franco Colucci (since he believes Franco obligated his father to kill himself), not knowing he would fall for the man's daughter (Mia Colucci).\n\nHe later found out it was really Franco's brother Carlo who led Miguel's father to his death. When Miguel finds out he feels horrible (because he started dating Mia), and forgets his vengeful plans. Miguel has a constant on-again, off-again relationship with Mia, but they still and always have been madly in love from the first time they saw each other, even though they pretended that they hated each other. Miguel is friends with Roberta and is always helping her with anything she needs help on. Miguel has a strong sense of pride and dignity that often gets in the way of common sense. He finds himself in huge trouble with Mia after allegedly cheating on her with Sabrina Guzman (RBD's manager, event planner and the daughter of their producer) who has an extreme obsession with him and taking him away from Mia. She pretends to be his friend and after a heavy drinking session she makes him believe that they slept together and that she is pregnant (although this presumably never happened, but is furthered due to Sabrina's intention of blinding Miguel to her side and the fact that Miguel was drunk when the \"cheat\" occurred).\n\nHe later finds out through security camera videos that he never slept with her. He now tries desperately to win Mia back. He later falls into a coma due to an accident when he was hit by Gaston (the school's Prefect). Miguel wakes up from his coma and didn't seem to remember anybody except Diego. A few days later, he remembers his father thanks to Roberta (after a strong session of screams on her behalf) and a long discussion, after he mistakenly says that Sabrina is his girlfriend instead of Mia (even though he likes Mia without remembering their history together), which makes Mia want to get far away from Miguel. Later Miguel finds out through Diego and Roberta that the love of his life is Mia. He then tries to tell Mia that he finally knows who she is and why he has been having these feelings for her, when he saw her for the first time (after he wakes up from his coma).\n\nHe later gets all his memories back during an RBD concert, ironically while Mia is singing Salvame (their love song). Later on she takes him back, after she learns about the lies Sabrina came up with. Plus she is in love with Miguel. In the final episode, he gave Mia an engagement ring. Miguel and Mia were last seen at a bridge talking about their future.\n\nDiego Bustamante[edit]\n\nDiego BustamanteRebelde characterPortrayed byChristopher von UckermannFirst appearanceOctober 4, 2004Last appearanceJune 2, 2006Created byCris Morena\n\nIn-universe informationOccupationStudent(former) musician(present)ParentsLeón Bustamante (father)\n\nMabel Bustamante (mother)SpouseRoberta (wife)\n\nPlayed by: Christopher von Uckermann\n\nDiego is a very handsome and talented boy who is the son of the corrupt political leader Leon Bustamante. In the beginning of the series he dates Vico but later dumps her because she cheats on him with Tomas because he didn't ask her to go to his party. He also pretends to date Roberta so he will be able to play with RBD though he does really have feelings for her. After Roberta leaves for Spain because her dad is forcing her to go, Diego falls in love with Paula, a girl that is paid by Leon to sleep with him, because Diego was still a virgin. They fall in love and decide to run away together. Leon finds him and tells him the truth about Paula. Diego finds out that Paula not only slept with him, but also with his father, so he dumps her.\n\nOn a trip to Canada, he and Mia fake a relationship to make Miguel and Roberta jealous. It seems as though making each other jealous worked, because they ended the trip with a passionate kiss. Diego often shows that when he has problems, he tends to drink a lot, almost dying. He also shows that he is highly affected by the problems that surround his parents marriage. Towards the end of the first season, Diego falls, hitting his head, and pretends not to remember Roberta so that he can go out with her and win the bet he made with Tomas. He starts to fall in love with her, but when Roberta finds out why he went out with her she dumps him. He's crushed and tries to get her back. In the second season he wins the Student Body President elections because his team cheats and then shares the presidency with Roberta. He tries to get Roberta jealous in numerous occasions, with numerous girls including Sol and Lola, although he doesn't really last that long with any of them. In the third season, RBD start recording their album and go on tour. While on their way back Diego confesses his love for Roberta, because he thinks that the plane is going to crash and he's going to die. Roberta does the same. When the plane lands and they get off, he tells her that he was just kidding. However, later on he realizes that he really is in love and asks her to be his girlfriend, but she says no. After saving her and doing sweet things like giving her serenades, she finally decides to take a chance and they date. They break up later, because Roberta thinks that he is back to his old ways.\n\nShe finds out that it was just a misunderstanding and tries to get back with him, but he refuses, saying that he is tired of their on-and-off relationship. She then goes to find Diego's mom and brings her back, and that's when Diego and Roberta finally end up together for good. For the finale, they made out in a rowboat.\n\nLupita Fernandez[edit]\n\nLupita FernandezRebelde characterPortrayed byMaite PerroniFirst appearanceOctober 4, 2004Last appearanceJune 2, 2006Created byCris Morena\n\nIn-universe informationOccupationStudent(former) doctor(present)ParentsRosa Fernández (mother) Mayra Fernández (aunt)SiblingsDulce Fernández (sister) Lola (half-sister)SpouseSantos Echague\n\nPlayed by: Maite Perroni\n\nGuadalupe \"Lupita\" Fernandez is the good-girl-next-door in the series. She's beautiful, shy, sweet and tries to be nice and friendly to everyone. She always chooses to do what is right. Her family is lower middle class, and she's at Elite Way thanks to a scholarship obtained to her by her aunt, who works at the school's cafeteria. Lupita gets along well with everyone, being close friends with Mía and best friends and roommates with Roberta and Jose Luján.\n\nLupita's character is reportedly inspired partially by a friend of the writers, named Lupita Martínez. Lupita is sweet and quiet, but she has a complicated relationship with family and puts too much pressure on herself because of her scholarship and because she doesn't want to disappoint her aunt. This often leads to Lupita angrily telling people off whenever things are too much to her which then will make her rebellious. However, she likes to be helpful. She's part of RBD alongside Mía, Miguel, Diego, Roberta, and Giovanni, and she comes up with the band's name. She's a victim of La Logia, a secret society that strives to keep the school 'pure' and 'clean' of scholarship students.\n\nThroughout the first season, Lupita's in a relationship with Nico, a poor Jewish boy who studies at Elite Way. Although they're in love with each other, Nico's family opposes the relationship, mainly because Lupita isn't Jewish. They even bring Nico’s old girlfriend Karen, back to Mexico, hoping the girl will break him and Lupita up. At the end of the first season, because Nico's family is sending him away to Israel to study, Nico and Lupita have a symbolic marriage, witnessed by all of their friends. Nico leaves to Israel, promising to write to Lupita and to come back as soon as possible to marry her for real. Lupita is heartbroken that he's leaving, but has confidence that they'll work out in the end.\n\nIn the second season, Lupita finds out her father remarried and has a daughter with his second wife. Lupita's half-sister, Lola, is spoiled and jealous that Lupita is apparently their father's favorite. However, Lupita works hard to have a good relationship with her sister. Meanwhile, Lupita starts believing Nico has forgotten about her while in Israel, for he hasn't written to her at all since leaving. What she doesn't know is that Nico's mother has been holding his letters to Lupita back. Devastated, Lupita grows close to Santos, a classmate who has a crush on her.\n\nHowever, Santos' feelings for Lupita worsens her relationship with Lola. Lola has a crush on Santos and believes Lupita's pursuing him out of spite. With time, the sisters work out their problems and grow closer. Lupita starts to accept she has fallen in love with Santos, and they start their relationship. When Nico comes back, ready to pick up where he left it off with Lupita, leaving her stunned and confused.\n\nNico's return puts a strain on Lupita's relationship with Santos, but, after a while, she realizes it's Santos who she loves and tells Nico that she's over him and only wants to be friends. Nico is heartbroken but accepts Lupita's decision and Lupita is with Santos in the end.\n\nGiovanni Méndez Lopez[edit]\n\nGiovanni MéndezRebelde characterPortrayed byChristian ChávezFirst appearanceOctober 4, 2004Last appearanceJune 2, 2006Created byCris Morena\n\nIn-universe informationOccupationStudent(former) singer(present)ParentsCosme Méndez (father)\n\nLuisa López (mother)\n\nPlayed by: Christian Chávez\n\nGiovanni Méndez (originally called Juan) is a handsome, social, egotistical yet very funny guy. He is the character who engages in the most comical situations. He knows how to make friends, but has a problem with letting himself be taken by others and not knowing how to make his own decisions. He can also be very harsh at times. His best friends (and roommates) are Diego and Tomas.\n\nMéndez dyes his hair of many colors throughout the series (at the end of the series it was rose red). Coming from a rather poor family, Méndez actively tries to hides his low-class beginnings and parentage. For that very same reason, Méndez always shoots for a chance at easy money. Méndez's parents had humble beginnings but became rich after his father won the lottery. However, the personal administrator of the family fortune committed fraud and stole all of the family's possessions, which forced them to return to their original lives as the owners of a butcher shop. Méndez is also a hopeless womanizer, unable to remain faithful to just one woman (which mostly explains why his relationship with Vico ended in failure). He gets into a relationship with Augustina, a rich girl who gives Giovanni expensive gifts at the drop of a dime, wooing Giovanni to her feet.\n\nAlthough he is good at heart, some rich classmates consider him a sellout, which splits Giovanni between his devotion to one woman and his fixation for expensive gifts. But in spite of all that he continues going to school, and he is doing good with his personal life, family, friends, girls, fun activities, and as a member of RBD. He was also a member of \"La Logia\" (a secret society within the school hell-bent on getting scholarship students kicked out), until he betrays them to save Teo.\n\nJóse Luján Landeros[edit]\n\nPlayed by: Zoraida Gómez\n\nThe quintessential female athlete, raised in foster care because her wealthy mom didn't want to raise her. Her tuition is paid by an anonymous benefactor.\n\nShe dated Teo briefly at the beginning of the series. She is Roberta and Lupita's best friend and roommate. She shares with Roberta an explosive attitude and overall rudeness. She has been under the harassment of the school prefect, Gaston, for quite a while, leading her to investigate the reason why Gaston's grudge towards her. However, due to her meddling in Gaston's obscure past, she gets extremely upset and desperately wants her out of the way. Lujan not only finds out that Gaston is her co-benefactor, but also her personal guardian since she was just a little girl. Jose Lujan comes to appreciate Gaston's efforts, and even justifies Gaston's harsh methods and constant abuse. However, their time together is cut short when Gaston dies after enduring a severe car crash. She begins acting hostile towards Roberta since she is jealous that Roberta has both parents (Alma and Martin) in her life while Jose Luján doesn't have a single parental figure. She is later adopted by Franco and Alma. At the end of the series, she gets back together with Teo.\n\nVictoria \"Vico\" Paz[edit]\n\nPlayed by: Angelique Boyer\n\nVictoria is Celina and Mia's best friend. She has a reputation for being \"easy.\" At the beginning of the series, she is dating Diego and plays with his feelings because he cheated and lied to her. She played with his feelings by getting with Diego's best friend Tomas.\n\nVico comes from a family with a twisted background: her father left her, her mom, and her brother when Vico was very young. As a result, Vico was at the blunt end of her father's physical abuse and psychological torment in the second season when they meet again. While at school she felt helpless and unloved, at one point attempted taking pills to take her mind off things. Mia, her best friend, helped her get past it.

She has a habit of getting even in a drastic way when men scorn her. She often speaks in English.\n\nAt the beginning of the series, she used to write an anonymous newspaper filled with gossip called Anónimos (\"anonymous\") about her peers. At first, she is cold and ruthless (especially towards Mia and her friends). It is later revealed that Pilar is the only female member of La Logia. Pilar is also romantically linked to Joaquín until he leaves school after having sex with her in her father's office.\n\nIn the second season, she joins the equally malicious Sol de la Riva, along with Raquel and Michelle, in a group called \"Top Girls.\" However, in season three, due to the Gandías' divorce and her relationship with Tomas, she comes to her senses and begins to socialize a bit more, eventually becoming closer to her classmates.\n\nOn 2022 Netflix reboot, Pilar Gandia now marry to a famous producer named Camilo Cohen and is the mother and manager of the pop star sensation Jana Cohen Gandia.

She often uses her friend, Bianca to do her dirty work.\n\nShe had a short affair with Diego and Leonardo, which ended quickly due to her immaturity. Lola considers herself to be all alone in this world and thinks that no one could ever love her.

He has poor knowledge of English. Even though he tries to be an imposing authority figure, he comes out more as a dim-witted principal who is easily manipulated not only by his superiors, but also by the same students he wants to control. Sometimes, his antics and raging outbursts come out as more comical than menacing (especially his silly evil laugh). Also tends to act clumsy when in the presence of a gorgeous woman. He used to be in a relationship with Alma Rey. He's going through a divorce with his wife Galia, since she considers him to be 'weak' and 'easily manipulated' by Diego's father (the legal owner of the Elite Way School). In the last episode we see Galia winking at him. They talk privately at the pool and they somewhat get back together. In the last few scenes, Galia gives him a peck on the lips for the audience.

His past was just as obscure as Esteban's, as indicated by further investigations made by Jose Lujan, whom Gaston likes to downgrade and humiliate at any given chance. Jose Lujan stole his laptop, and finds information that leads her to believe that Gaston is her secret benefactor, but Gaston repeatedly denies it. After a while, Gaston gets annoyed by Jose Lujan's meddling with his affairs, and decides to get her out of the Elite Way School once and for all. In reality, Gaston's father (Ricardo Sisniega) took care of Jose Lujan when she was a dirty street orphan because she had saved his life (although how she did so is still unknown). Gaston's father had always compared Jose Lujan's strength of will to Gaston's weak spirit, which fueled Gaston's anger. When his father died in prison, Gaston was forced to look after Jose Lujan and see to her tuition as per his father's last wish. Although Gaston tried to blame Jose Lujan for his miserable existence, he really did love Lujan like a sister, as he admitted to in his final breath.

Has a crush on Mía and Alma Rey. Was suspected as an ex-convict serial-killer due to an unusual relationship with the Gaston's father Ricardo Sisniega.
