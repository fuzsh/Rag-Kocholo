        "text": "Dawn French and Lenny Henry (m.20 October 1984 - div.25 October 2010) (1 adopted child)\n\nFrench met Lenny Henry on the alternative comedy circuit. The couple married on 20 October 1984 in Covent Garden, London. They adopted a daughter, Billie.\n\nFrench has stated that Billie has always known that she was adopted, but once took out an injunction when a biographer came close to revealing the identity of Billie's biological mother. When faced with a question about how she and Henry would feel if Billie wanted to find out about her birth mother, French commented, \"Whatever she wants to do when she's 18, we'll support her. What I do worry about is anyone else making the decision for her.\"\n\nThe couple owned property in Fowey, Cornwall. The Â£2.3-million mansion with 40 rooms overlooks Readymoney Cove and neighbouring Poldridmouth Cove, known as smugglers' cove. The grade II-listed building dates back to the 19th century.\n\nOn 6 April 2010, French and Henry announced they were separating after 25 years of marriage. It was reported that the separation was amicable. They had decided to separate in October the previous year but left it until then as they were still in discussion over the separation. Their divorce was finalised in 2010."
