Are celebrities more likely to divorce or break up? Earlier this week news reports surfaced that Patricio Borghetti, 50, and his partner had split up. Is the actor best known for his roles in Teresa, Lola… Once Upon A Time or Rebelde really single again?

UPDATE 21/07/2024 : This story seems to be false. (read more)

Borghetti spotted alone

A fan spotted Patricio Borghetti walking alone, probably coming back from picking up his mail at the end of his several mile long driveway, on the afternoon of July 19, 2024. Was he all alone? “Definitely yes,” says the fan, adding that “He was wearing a large sweater and looked really cute!”

Is Patricio back on the market?

A rep for Patricio Borghetti was not immediately available for comment.

Truth or rumor, when news that the actor - known for having been romantically involved with Grettell Valdéz - was splitting hit the internet Saturday (July 20), Twitter immediately exploded with pithy commentary. It seems everyone had an opinion on the matter:

“Has anyone Patricio’s phone number?”

“So very sad… Those 2 were so great as a couple. So cute together.”

Based on the facts (Borghetti spotted alone with a cute sweater), is there trouble in paradise or is it much ado about nothing?
