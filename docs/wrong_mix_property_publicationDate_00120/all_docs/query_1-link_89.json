        "text": "Science-fiction, fantasy and horror reviews by Keith Brooke\n\nOver the years I've written reviews for the Guardian, Foundation, Interzone, Vector, Odyssey, Beyond and various other places. Most of my reviews these days are written for Arc and The Guardian (including contributing to the SF/F section of their 1000 novels everyone must read). The listing on this page is as comprehensive as I've been able to manage, and includes pretty much everything from 1997 onwards. Earlier reviews have been harder to track down and so aren't included here.\n\nA note on identities\n\nJust to complicate matters, I sometimes review under my other writing name, Nick Gifford. There's nothing underhand about this: it's simply that \"Nick\" writes fiction for young adults, so it makes sense to be him when reviewing other young adult fiction; and allowing Nick to review a few adult novels and art books helped plump up his CV in the early days!\n\nsort by author; sort by date; reviews at infinity plus; reviews for the Guardian; reviews for Arc.\n\nForthcoming reviews (all publications)\n\nWolves by Simon Ings (The Guardian).\n\nMost recent reviews\n\nSisters of the Revolution: A Feminist Speculative Fiction Anthology by Jeff and Ann VanderMeer (editors) (The Guardian, October 2015). The Spectral Book of Horror Stories by Mark Morris (editor) (The Guardian, November 2014). Time's Mistress by Steven Savile (The Guardian, October 2014). Hurricane Fever by Tobias Buckell (The Guardian, July 2014). The Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year: Volume Eight by Jonathan Strahan (editor) (The Guardian, June 2014). The Unquiet House by Alison Littlewood (The Guardian, May 2014).\n\nAll reviews\n\nBrian Aldiss (editor): A Science Fiction Omnibus (The Guardian, review published December 2007)\n\n\"This anthology may not quite change your world, but as a sampler of what SF can do it's hard to beat.\"\n\nLou Anders (editor): Sideways in Crime (The Guardian, review published June 2009)\n\n\"The high standard of the anthology is reflected by the fact that three of its stories have recently been shortlisted for the Sidewise Award for alternate fiction.\"\n\nMT Anderson: Feed (infinity plus, review published November 2003)\n\n\"Treads a very fine line between triumph and failure in the way Anderson has chosen to tackle his personally-invasive 1984-ish future.\" (Review by Nick Gifford.)\n\nPatricia Anthony: Flanders (infinity plus, review published February 2000)\n\n\"A ghost story of a kind, a dark fantasy of the dead. And if there's anywhere for ghosts, for young men dead long before their business with this world is complete, then it's the killing fields of the First World War ... If there's such a thing as the beauty of war, it's there in Anthony's prose: in the loving detail of awfulness, the vivid illustration of how low humankind can sink.\"\n\nTom Arden: Doctor Who Novellas: Nightdreamers (infinity plus, review published June 2002)\n\n\"Tom Arden captures the pantomime noir of Doctor Who to a T ... a warmly nostalgic chunk of high jinks.\" (Review by Nick Gifford.)\n\nKelley Armstrong: The Summoning (The Guardian, review published July 2008)\n\n\"Armstrong's gushing prose has the storyteller's knack of compelling the reader to start just one more chapter, despite knowing there must be a better way to spend one's time than this.\"\n\nNeal Asher: Prador Moon (The Guardian, review published October 2008)\n\n\"...this punchy and very violent short novel from the Essex hard man of science fiction.\"\n\nMike Ashley (editor): The Mammoth Book of Apocalyptic SF (The Guardian, review published June 2010)\n\n\"What emerges from most of these stories is that apocalypse is not so much about the end, but about new beginnings - that staple of SF, the blank canvas. In this volume, Ashley fills that canvas with consummate skill.\"\n\nSteve Aylett: The Complete Accomplice (The Guardian, review published October 2010)\n\n\"Steve Aylett is one of the great eccentrics of British genre fiction, whichever genre that might be.\"\n\nPaolo Bacigalupi: Ship Breaker (The Guardian, review published August 2011)\n\n\"Ship Breaker, while less striking than Bacigalupi's debut, shows that the acclaim was not misplaced...\"\n\nIain M Banks: Matter (The Guardian, review published March 2009)\n\n\"Another fine addition to Banks's Culture series.\"\n\nIain M Banks: The Algebraist (infinity plus, review published January 2005)\n\n\"There's something very odd about this book, something I still haven't quite managed to work out.\"\n\nPaul Barnett: The Paper Tiger Fantasy Art Gallery (infinity plus, review published November 2002)\n\n\"In a field wedded to pushing and breaking boundaries, so much of the art is safe ... The Paper Tiger Fantasy Art Gallery demonstrates how this need not be the case.\" (Review by Nick Gifford.)\n\nStephen Baxter et al: The Web 2028 (infinity plus, review published August 2000)\n\n\"Good light sf. Its greatest value, as with the first series, is that it introduces the next generation of readers to some of our best practitioners.\"\n\nStephen Baxter: Deep Future (infinity plus, review published August 2001)\n\n\"For a work of futurology, Deep Future dwells an awful lot on the here and now ... There's a real sense that there are two books here: the Clarkeian futurology sitting a little uncomfortably alongside the analysis of space history.\"\n\nStephen Baxter: Flood (The Guardian, review published July 2009)\n\n\"A fine addition to the British science-fiction tradition of disaster novels, reading like something John Wyndham might have written if he had tackled climate change on a global scale, laced with the kind of scientific rigour you would expect from Baxter.\"\n\nStephen Baxter: Mammoth - Book 1: Silverhair (infinity plus, review published March 1999)\n\n\"Like Watership Down, Mammoth makes for pretty grim reading at times: no whimsical flopsy-wopsy bunnies here... Like Adams before him, Baxter gets it just right ... Books like this should be part of the National Curriculum for science.\" (Review by Nick Gifford.)\n\nStephen Baxter: Mammoth - Book 2: Longtusk (infinity plus, review published October 2000)\n\n\"...exploring the truth behind the legend, the many ways in which history is glossed over and polished in the re-telling ... a fine piece of paleoanthropological fiction, combining science-fictional speculation of the highest order with his customary meticulous research.\" (Review by Nick Gifford.)\n\nStephen Baxter: Moonseed (infinity plus, review published September 1999)\n\n\"Baxter's Moonseed is a powerful, gripping novel which sets the brain as well as the heart racing.\"\n\nStephen Baxter: Origin (infinity plus, review published August 2001)\n\n\"Part-survival adventure and part-anthropological-speculation story, which sidesteps tangentially towards discovery of the true nature of the universe. Come to think of it, there aren't many books you could sum up quite like that...\"\n\nStephen Baxter: Space (infinity plus, review published April 2001)\n\n\"In dismissing standard explanations for Fermi's paradox, Baxter has set himself an almighty challenge: he has to come up with a better explanation. He does so, admirably, as you might expect from one of the deepest thinkers in modern sf.\"\n\nStephen Baxter: The Web: Gulliverzone (infinity plus, review published August 1997)\n\n\"This one's fun.\"\n\nStephen Baxter: Time (infinity plus, review published September 1999)\n\n\"I wouldn't go as far as they do on the cover - 'The millennium's last great SF novel' - but Stephen Baxter's Time is certainly a good one, albeit with slightly disturbing undercurrents.\"\n\nStephen Baxter: Traces (infinity plus, review published May 1998)\n\n\"There's much to admire in almost any Stephen Baxter story, but in certain stories there's everything to admire.\"\n\nPeter S Beagle: Sleight of Hand (The Guardian, review published March 2011)\n\n\"So here it is: a new collection of stories by one of the all-time greats.\"\n\nChris Beckett: The Holy Machine ([written for The Guardian, but not published there due to a clash], review published July 2010)\n\n\"A very timely dystopia that marks Beckett out as an author to follow closely.\"\n\nRobert Jackson Bennett: Mr Shivers (The Guardian, review published September 2010)\n\n\"A particularly striking debut novel.\"\n\nMichael Bishop: A Reverie for Mister Ray: Reflections on Life, Death and Speculative Fiction (infinity plus, review published May 2006)\n\n\"This book explores a whole range of fictional territories where each, in its way, is more real -- a magnified reality -- than the world around us.You couldn't hope for a more intelligent, engaging and downright companionable guide than Bishop.\"\n\nStephen Bowkett: The Web: Dreamcastle (infinity plus, review published August 1997)\n\n\"Bowkett's contribution to the Web series is concerned with the fuzzy borderland between the real and the virtual: what happens when you lose sight of the dividing line? What happens when someone deliberately muddies that distinction?\" (Review by Nick Gifford.)\n\nRay Bradbury: R is for Rocket and S is for Space (infinity plus, review published December 2005)\n\n\"This is Ray Bradbury. You shouldn't need to know anything more than that.\"\n\nRay Bradbury: Ray Bradbury: Stories, Vols 1 and 2 (The Guardian, review published December 2008)\n\n\"Collected in these two enormous volumes are classic works of speculative fiction.\"\n\nChristopher Brookmyre: Bedlam (Arc, review published February 2013)\n\n\"Like a good game, even while the graphics may be a little off, and the pacing a bit jerky, it gets its hooks into you and won't let go. I kind of like that.\"\n\nEric Brown et al: The Web 2028 (infinity plus, review published August 2000)\n\n\"Good light sf. Its greatest value, as with the first series, is that it introduces the next generation of readers to some of our best practitioners.\"\n\nEric Brown: Blue Shifting (infinity plus, review published July 1997)\n\n\"Blue Shifting isn't a collected works, it's a greatest hits.\"\n\nEric Brown: The Web: Untouchable (infinity plus, review published October 1997)\n\n\"A slick, fast-paced story, with all the atmosphere and deeply wrought characters we have come to expect from Brown.\"\n\nTobias Buckell: Hurricane Fever (The Guardian, review published July 2014)\n\n\"A fine, no-frills ecological technothriller, complete with a mad bad villain, fast-paced action and a race against the clock finale.\"\n\nPat Cadigan et al: The Web 2028 (infinity plus, review published August 2000)\n\n\"Good light sf. Its greatest value, as with the first series, is that it introduces the next generation of readers to some of our best practitioners.\"\n\nAlan Campbell: Scar Night (The Guardian, review published May 2007)\n\nFor reasons of space, the closing line was dropped from the published review: \"An unfeasibly good debut novel.\"\n\nOrson Scott Card: Ender in Exile (The Guardian, review published November 2009)\n\n\"The novel picks up thirteen year-old Ender Wiggin's story in the aftermath of the war he almost singlehandedly won against the alien Buggers... Unfocused and suffering from the need to pull together too many threads from connected stories, Ender in Exile will nonetheless be welcomed by the many fans of this series.\"\n\nStepan Chapman: Dossier: a collection of short stories (infinity plus, review published July 2001)\n\n\"These are tales that in past generations would have been read around the camp-fire... The language is simple, yet the simplicity of telling is often illusory, drawing the reader into dark twistings of the imagination.\"\n\nStepan Chapman: The Troika (infinity plus, review published April 1998)\n\n\"In novels like this ('novels like this' - what am I saying? There are no novels like this!)...\"\n\nBrian Clegg: A Brief History of Infinity (infinity plus, review published December 2003)\n\n\"Brian Clegg has just had me revisiting areas of mathematics I haven't even considered since university. And I enjoyed it.\"\n\nJohn Clute: Appleseed (infinity plus, review published November 2001)\n\n\"John Clute, with his wealth of experience and genre knowledge, may not get everything right first time out (it would be asking a lot to expect Appleseed to meet the critical standards Clute himself sets), but one thing is sure: he won't get it wrong for lack of thinking or effort.\"\n\nMichael Cobley: Seeds of Earth (The Guardian, review published February 2010)\n\n\"Merciless alien invaders, lost human colonies, mysterious secrets of the ancients... a gripping science-fiction adventure that combines the traditions of the field with a deft contemporary touch.\"\n\nPeter Crowther: Cities and Infinities (infinity plus, review published May 2003)\n\n\"British sf is flourishing and Peter Crowther has played an important part in this, providing opportunities for some of our best authors to work at a length that is generally assumed to be hard to publish successfully.\"\n\nPeter Crowther: Futures (infinity plus, review published May 2001)\n\n\"Novellas by four of the UK's leading sf authors put together in what is possibly the most handsome genre publication in recent memory.\" (Review by Keith Brooke and Nick Gevers.)\n\nMarianne de Pierres: Mirror Space (The Guardian, review published December 2009)\n\n\"In Mirror Space stuff happens, then something else happens and then it all pulls together, and then... the reader must wait for volume four.\"\n\nPaul Di Filippo: A Year in the Linear City (infinity plus, review published June 2002)\n\n\"Fiction of the highest order ... an author who genuinely comes close to defying all attempts at description.\"\n\nPhilip K Dick: Flow, My Tears, the Policeman Said (The Guardian, review published March 2007)\n\n\"...suddenly Dick is tugging at the thread again, unravelling Taverner's and the reader's perceptions as only he can.\"\n\nPhilip K Dick: Minority Report (infinity plus, review published September 2002)\n\n\"There are three Dicks at loose in this collection: the dazzler, the pedestrian and the downright weird.\"\n\nChris Dolley: Resonance (infinity plus, review published January 2006)\n\n\"Resonance is a tremendously accomplished book for a first published novel and immediately raises Dolley into the ranks of writers to watch.\"\n\nGardner Dozois (editor): The Best New SF 10 (infinity plus, review published November 1997)\n\n\"Gardner Dozois' annual gathering of his favourite short sf has become something of a benchmark for the genre...\"\n\nGardner Dozois (editor): The Mammoth Book of Best New SF 11 (infinity plus, review published February 1999)\n\n\"Gardner Dozois has earned our trust: he does the job more reliably than any of the others who have tried over the last two decades...\"\n\nGardner Dozois (editor): The Mammoth Book of Best New SF 13 (infinity plus, review published February 2001)\n\n\"Another year, another selection from Gardner Dozois, another hefty must-read.\"\n\nGardner Dozois (editor): The Mammoth Book of Best New SF 17 (infinity plus, review published July 2005)\n\n\"A fine anthology, easily matching the high standard set by earlier volumes in the series. So what's the problem?\"\n\nHal Duncan: Escape from Hell!
