        "text": "I do agree that the alpha female is getting out of hand a little lately. They're lopping off heads, slaying dragons and kicking groins in record numbers. Yet, the largest purchases and readership come from the female audience in urban, dark, paranormal/romantic fantasy. It's kind of a marketing decision. Below is a post I made on another board when we were contemplating what editors were looking for.\n\n\"Yeah, Pike, we best get ready. We best write like never before. I've spent a lot time analyzing this situation for the past two years, expending a ton of time doing it. That means watching the market, noting the debut sales, who they were sold to and why. My agent went into overdrive at the last BEA and got sucky-face with damn near every editor there to find out exactly what they were looking for. He took copious notes, wined and dined, hammered out strategies, and also noted the age and sex of every senior editor there. He put it all together and came out with a game plan to up the odds. I'll share what I know, and it's still no guarantee that we'll tear down these walls.\n\nMost of the acquiring editors are very savvy females between the ages of 28 and 42 years of age. This is an approximate demographic, which is really just an interesting fact. Yet, it has a slight bearing on where the market shift and presence is. These women are incredibly intelligent and have come from diverse backgrounds, all of them in professional capacities.\n\nThe sales indicate that paranormal romance is riding the highest wave at the moment. Romance has always been top gun, holding the first place position, both in sales and readership. But the fantasy/paranormal aspect, added to a solid love story, with \"steamy sex\" is a very popular candidate. Jackie Kessler's Hell's Belles is a perfect example of this type of book that hits all those marks. Thus its popularity. It doesn't mean that other genres are not being looked at. It just means eyes are peeled for this massive trend. This genre has enough legs that no one can predict when this genre/trend will cool off. It's more than safe to say that this genre will endure for at least three to four more years, but probably longer.\n\nRegardless of what type of book you've written, if the premise or concept (the gimmick or idea) behind the plot is not something unique or fresh, it's not going to get past the query/pitch stage either for you or your agent. In my opinion, editors are looking for that \"wow\" factor. Or why didn't I think of this idea! The concept is the first line of defense, and a good one can usually be summed up in a long sentence. You can fix voice/style, plot holes, mood, pace characterization and other elements. You cannot fix or repair a cliche plot--it's a death sentence (very quick automatic rejections) and a stake through the writer's heart.\n\nFor my prep, as far as concept and wow factor, I've been studying some of the old Twilight Zone, One Step Beyond shorts and M. Night Shalaman.\n\nLayering = red herrings, twists and subplots. Get em in there. You want something 3-D, and not totally linear and predictable. Make the editor really, really think, pause and wonder. Get a little bold, something that could go so far as to elicite a \"WHAT in the hell is going on here?\" Better to confuse than bore a reader. They'll turn the page just to see if this delightful mess straigtens out. TAKE CHANCES. That's what they're looking for.\n\nI was a straight SF writer of off-planet and futuristics. I'm not even going to tell you how difficult it was to get a full read from a major. In this genre, if you don't have a mind-blower, you're toast. Because in that genre, you're competing with the big names that are holding on to those very few publishing slots. If you write SF and have exhausted your markets, look into SFR--that's SF Romance. SFR is just starting to get a foothold in the industry and some new imprints have popped up to handle it. If you can taylor your SF piece to showcase a major romantic element, you can open up a whole new can of markets.\n\nI don't know what else to say. Be different--be bold--be ground-breaking. I would advise everyone to post their queries in the SYW and let the darts fly. Then, study that query really hard and, work in that \"wow\" factor. Every story has one--you just have to bring it up right to the front and play on it.\n\nTri\n\nUK writer Mike Carey has a very good series called the Felix Castor novels. There are 3 books for the moment : The Devil you Know, Vicious Circle and Dead Men's Boots. In the Uk they're available as paperbacks (Orbit). I think in the US the first part has just been published as a hardcover by Warner.\n\nSimon Green novels of the Nightside. These books are published by Ace. They have done an omnibus edition containting the first 3 volumes (A Walk on the Nighside).\n\nMike Resnick has written a nice little novel called Stalking the Unicorn. It was published by Tor in the 90's, it's out of print but not difficult to find. BTW, Resnick will bring out a sequel that will be published by Pyr next year. I believe they will also bring back the original novel back in print.\n\nAnd there is one \"female\" series I do recommend. Tanya Huff's blood novels. These were written back in the early 90's before this new hype so they are not \"tainted\" by some of the usual problems of modern urban fantasy.\n\nYes there is a tough female heroine and a vampire etc...\n\nbut the characters are real people and victories don't come cheap for the main characters. DAW has done new editions of these books in paperback omnibuses so they are good value for their money. In 2004 Huff started a spin-off of this series with a minor male character from the first series. This series has a strong homosexual content since the new main character is a gay man.\n\nAnd for some good old time pulp fun I do recommend Poul Anderson's Operation Chaos. Written in the 1960's, these novelets were published by Baen in an omibus edition somewhere in the 90's. Worth looking up !!\n\nYunno, its funny -- I'm watching Buffy right now and so far I think its brilliant TV. Yet I agree with you. I once read two sample chapters from one of Laurel K. Hamilton's Anita Blake novels, and that sample convinced me to never go near them, or the subgenre over which they reign supreme.\n\nI have no objections at all to strong, aggressive female characters, but I think you're right: lots of them are just so similar.\n\nI'd certainly say that this kind of stuff is being abused, becoming a type of formula fiction not uncomparable to the \"farm boy is chosen one destined to kill big bad dark lord\" material that has been pounded to death despite being a perfectly good story in theory, and that's a shame.\n\nMy experience doesn't extend much beyond the Dresden Files, but those should do you nicely if you haven't read them -- they are great fun, and I'd call the newer ones truly excellent. Mike Carey's aforementioned Felix Castor novels are supposed to be equally glorious, as are Charly Huston's (apparently very brutal) Joe Pit Casebooks.\n\nIt might not be entirely what you're looking for, but though I haven't read it I believe China Mieville's King Rat features a male main character. Its certainly urban fantasy, and though Mieville is one of those authors who's work I only occasionally connect with on a gut-deep level I'd definitely recommend checking out anything written by him -- he's a brilliant writer. I plan on reading King Rat in the new year, particularly if it transpires that Mieville's new novel Kraken is delayed out of 2008.\n\nOh yeah, and based on their amazon listings Pyr is indeed republishing Mike Resnick's Stalking the Unicorn. The sequel is called Stalking the Vampire I believe, and looks like its scheduled for the summer.\n\n________\n\nPRILOSEC LAWSUIT INFORMATION\n\nWhy, when peope make recommendation requests, do they so often feel the need to do so in melodramatic statements? 99% of the contemporary fantasy market is not suspense stories with spunky women kick-ass heroines (who existed long before Buffy was ever on the air.)\n\nThere are two separate category markets involved here. The paranormal romances, most of which are contemporary fantasy, are published by romance publishers and imprints, for the romance fan audience. They are marketed to SFF fans and sometimes placed in the fantasy or horror racks of bookstores, but most of the marketing is done to the romance community. The stereotype of the spunky female in that market is not Buffy, but romance heroines of many ages gone by, particularly heroines of suspense romance, which has always been a big part of the romance market, both of the category market and romance published in general fiction.\n\nThen we have the category fantasy market, and now, category horror market. Like the category mystery market and the general fiction thriller market, a large number of the titles in these markets have female protagonists and/or there are a large number of female writers. Also like mystery, there are a large number of titles that have male protagonists and/or are written by male writers. That several romance writers and female fantasy writers have done well doing series or novels that feature female protagonists does not mean that this is all there is. It means that's what you are paying attention to.\n\nIn actual fact, most horror does not feature a female protagonist. In contemporary fantasy, it's probably about half and half. So, possible titles, in addition to what's been mentioned so far:\n\nTim Powers: Expiration Date, Earthquake Weather, Declare, Last Call, Three Days to Never\n\nCharles de Lint: too many titles, some female lead, some male -- hunt for what you want.\n\nEric Nylund -- Dry Water\n\nStephen King -- most of them, try Gunslinger series\n\nTerry Brooks -- Running with the Demon and sequels\n\nJonathan Carroll -- most titles\n\nJohn Crowley -- Little Big, AEgypt and sequels\n\nRobert Holdstock -- Mythago Wood\n\nJonathan Lethem -- Fortress of Solitude\n\nSean Stewart -- most titles\n\nTad Williams -- War of Flowers\n\nClive Barker -- most titles\n\nDean Koontz -- some titles\n\nJerry Jay Carroll -- some titles\n\nClifford Chase -- Winkie\n\nMichael de Larrambeiti -- The Borribles\n\nKeith Donohue -- The Stolen Child\n\nGlen Duncan -- Death of an Ordinary Man\n\nHal Duncan -- Vellum, Ink\n\nJasper Fforde -- some titles\n\nJeffrey Ford -- some titles\n\nEsther Friesner -- New York by Knight\n\nGraham Joyce -- some titles\n\nChina Mieville -- King Rat\n\nMichael Moorcock -- some titles\n\nChristopher Moore -- most titles\n\nJames Morrow -- some titles\n\nHaruki Murakami -- some titles\n\nSam Savage -- Firmini: Adventures of a Metropolitan Life\n\nMichael Swanwick -- Jack Faust\n\nHarry Turtledove -- Darkness Descending\n\nJack Vance -- some titles\n\nSean Williams -- some titles\n\nTom Piccirilli -- some titles\n\nJoe Schreiber -- Chasing the Dead\n\nSteve Cash -- some titles\n\nCameron Rogers -- The Music of Razors\n\nRay Manzarek -- Snake Moon\n\nTom Holt -- some titles\n\nMark West -- In the Rain with the Dead\n\nLavie Tidhar -- An Occupation of Angels\n\nJon F. Merz -- Lawson the Vampire\n\nBrian Lumley -- Necroscope series\n\nWilliam Mark Simmons -- One Foot in the Grave, Dead on my Feet\n\nDan Vining -- The Quick\n\nWill Eliot -- The Pilo Family Circus\n\nThese are only some of the titles I have on file -- I'm disorganized at the moment. Of course, some of those works may have female main characters in addition to male protagonists and they may be seen by you as spunky. If you only are interested in noir mystery contemporary fantasy with a supernatural bent, like Jim Butcher's Dresden Files series, then that's a smaller slice of the pie. You may want to check out the Supernatural Fantasy thread in the archives for a host of titles that might be to your liking. And of course, there is the Recommendation Thread.\n\nI think the tendency among those of us, (like me), who don't know the market as well is to assume that whatever we see as being most visible is dominant. So far as I can tell, there's a bout of novels, generally in long-running series, of the type Jackal912 complains about doing very well just now: Hamilton (both series), Harrison, Harris, Armstrong, Saintcrow, etc. We just assume that such titles are dominant, like how someone looking at alternate realm fantasy might assume it is made up entirely of long series of door-stopper tomes containing hundreds of characters along the lines of Martin, Jordan, and Erikson's stories.\n\nAgain, I've got nothing against stories of this type featuring strong female leads, though the Hamiltonesque tendency that seems to have the stories consist mostly of sex bugs me. (Incidentally, it runs counter to the topic, but has anyone read Cherie Priest's series of southern ghost stories beginning with Four and Twenty Blackbirds? I've been wondering about them.) Its just the \"loudness\" of these novels, which presumably stems from how hot they are sales wise -- you just cannot not notice them. The same principle seems to me to be at least partially at work when people hate on the alternate realm epics or, heck, even Harry Potter.\n\nAnyhow, I believe Night Watch By Sergei Lukyanenko is told in first person from the point of view of a male character. The book's supposed to be mighty good, though I've heard mixed reports about the sequels.\n\nAs for De Lint, I've long been intimidated by how much he's written, but I recently checked out a sample chapter of his Moonheart on Tor's website and now can't wait to get the book. Yes, the main character is female, but from what I've read I don't think Sarah is the kind of female lead Jackal912's getting sick of. She does not kill demons by night; so far as I can tell she just owns an antique shop.\n\n________\n\nLovelyWendie"
