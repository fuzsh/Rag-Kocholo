        "text": "The Long Road Home by Robin Furth and Peter David, The Dark Tower Graphic Novels #2\n\nGunslinger Roland Deschain has seen the death of his lover Susan Delgado, and now the Big Coffin Hunters who burned her at the stake are in pursuit of Roland and his ka-tet Cuthbert and Alain. The friends are forced to flee into the desert with the deadly posse in hot pursuit - and Roland is in a coma!\n\nThe Long Road Home is the second comic book adapation in the graphic novels series and tell a never before told story. That of what happened after Roland's \"inauguration\" as a gunslinger in Mejis. Just in short, in the first book Gunslinger Born, the illustrated version of Wizard and Glass, how Roland fell in love with Susan and the corrupt town of Mejis with the Big Coffin Hunters and Rhea of the Coos. In the end Roland and his ka-tet, Alain and Cuthbert, managed to defeat them and get away with Merlyn's Grapefruit.\n\nThis second addition to the graphic novel series picks up with Roland and his ka-tet on the flee for the Big Coffin Hunters, however Roland is entranced by Merlyn's Grapefruit and by the grapefruit it's influence in placed into a coma. Now Alain and Cuthbert have to not only stay alive themselves but also have the burden of keeping Roland alive. And when chased down by people with guns and horses it is hard. Next to the focus on the Roland, Alain and Cuthbert, we finally get to see just what happened with Sheemie. In my review of Wizard and Glass I mentioned that Sheemie's character was just brilliant and that it is unable not to feel for him. That a lot of people underestimate him is only for the better I think, he is a smart boy but naieve, and this is precisely what the follow up shows. Sheemie ventures after Roland's ka-tet and comes across a hide-out and stumbles on a robot. Not just a robot, one from the company of North Central Positronics, does it ring any bells? Now Sheemie's life is about to change...\n\nThe story is a short one but one that pays off, I have been thinking about what happened after Mejis. I can fully imagine that for some readers of The Dark Tower series, this is a let down, that it might have been better to not have reaad what happened keep one guessing what might have happened, same counts for reading after the author's note in The Dark Tower. The sense of imagination. For me I like to get my answers and find that The Long Road Home offers a very clear way of direction for the story.\n\nBecause in the end, when you see this picture below, with Sheemie to the rescue, saying before hand that Roland deserves a hero.. but all he gets is Sheemie on a mule, well Sheemie rocks! Period.\n\nLabels\n\nSelfies by Lavie Tidhar \"Selfies\", by Lavie Tidhar, is a creepy little horror tale about the fate of a young woman who makes the mistake of a lifetime when she buys a new phone in the local mall. It is only a few weeks back that I read a different but very interesting short story of Lavie Tidhar, Dragonkin . I found this story directly to my liking, the synopsis and build up of the story was unique and got me excited by it's less is more writing style. In the end this story for me had so much going on that I hope to see Lavie Tidhar exploring it even further. That aside, now its time for Selfies . I think I can now safely say that Lavie Tidhar is an author to watch out for, his stories will get you thinking and will scare you twice over. I have been thinking a lot of the current situation with always being connected on social media and the likes. It's unavoidable. One thing that is connected with all of this is of course your smartphone, yes no longer a cell\n\nAuthor interview with Christopher Fowler.

One wrong move could mean the destruction of everything you know and love, but in the heat of battle, there are crystalline moments in which true humanity shines. Like many military authors, I often look to history for guidance on how to write the future. I’ve always looked at the Battle of Rorke’s Drift as the perfect sort of battle to represent an alien invasion. One hundred and fifty British soldiers in a remote outpost are beset by four thousand Zulu warriors. The odds seemed impossible, yet in the end the British won the day. The early Michael Cain movie Zulu retells this story and stands as one of my favorite military movies of all time. There are moments in the film that resonate. In the face of overwhelming attack, the sergeant major lowly commanding his men to take it easy. Right when everything seems los"
