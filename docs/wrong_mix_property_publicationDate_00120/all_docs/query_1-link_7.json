        "text": "I’m a huge science fiction fan, and, having read a list of what are alleged to be the top 200 science fiction novels, I decided to next tackle a read-through of all the Hugo Award winners and nominees for best novel. Let me know your thoughts and favorites. I’ve marked the winner as well as my own choice for which novel would win, had I the choice among the nominees. I’ve also dropped a short reflection on the year’s Hugo list at the end. There may be SPOILERS for the books discussed.\n\nJack Faust by Michael Swanwick- Grade: D+\n\nI found this a terribly difficult read. Swanwick does a fine job of making a premise for a sci-fi Faustian tale. In this book, an alien species that is going to die out comes to Faust with a bargain that will help usher in the death of all of humanity first. It’s a bit unclear why they want this, but suffice to say they’d rather outlive humans if that’s alright with Faust. It is. We then get launched into a truly depressing story of how knowledge comes at a price. This isn’t some kind of Luddite fantasy, however. It’s more a story of how human nature is, at its core, broken. The problem with this isn’t so much the premise. Indeed, the problem with the book isn’t even its rather ham-fisted look at religion or rather annoying asides about sex. The problem is that it turns out it’s just not very fun to have an unrelentingly cynical outlook on reality conveyed via an almost wholly unlikable cast of characters.\n\nForever Peace by Joe Haldeman (Winner, My Winner)- Grade: B+\n\nI was surprised when I was underwhelmed by Forever War. Sorry, fans, I guess I understood the idea, but it read to me like a novel out of time and place. It probably read much better and fresh when it first came out. Forever Peace, however, surprised me by impressing me. Haldeman’s clear concern with social and economic factors in the world doesn’t seem quite so overwhelming of the main plot and characters as it did in Peace. This isn’t a sequel, though it’s a kind of re-imagining of the same concept written about 20 years later. In Forever Peace, war is on Earth in which wealthy nations wage war upon so-called third world guerilla soldiers by using basically unstoppable “soldierboys,” which allow soldiers to link up with a machine warrior. The level of separation does not totally remove all feelings of shame and horror at the violence they perpetrate, however. I don’t think the book ever quite reaches the heights the ideas behind it could hit, but it’s a great read all the same. It makes you think, and that’s one of my favorite things about science fiction.\n\nCity on Fire by Walter Jon Williams- Grade: B\n\nA sprawling epic that is almost as much about the city in which it takes place as it is about the characters. Williams created an intriguing magical system in the first book in the series, Metropolitan, and that interest pays dividends here. The book loses its way at times, and Williams has a tendency to wander a bit from the path his characters are taking. Tons of growth happens, both for our protagonists and the overall momentum of the plot. One problem with this is that this book ends on–if not a cliffhanger–a bit of a confusing note. Where does the story go next? It’s a kind of feeling of being let down at the end that makes it hard to shake. As a reader, I felt unfulfilled at the end. Overall, though, this is a stronger book than the first in the series, and certainly a worthy read on its own.\n\nThe Rise of Endymion by Dan Simmons- Grade: B\n\nThe fourth book in the Hyperion Cantos series by Dan Simmons delivers another satisfying adventure with big ideas. In Rise we have a Roman Catholic Church which has created a kind of theocracy in order to try to control everything. A bunch of hand waving has to occur to make the plot get going. Simmons moved the story 275 years forward and relies quite a bit on some info dumping to set the stage for the events of the plot. Once the story gets going, it provides another mind-bending adventure that’s good but doesn’t quite reach the heights of the other books in the series. I would recommend it largely for those who enjoyed the other books in the series. It’s a satisfying enough conclusion, but likely not enough to lure new readers in.\n\nFrameshift by Robert J. Sawyer- Grade: D-\n\nCONTENT WARNING: Extreme, brutal violence, including sexual violence, in this book!\n\nThe book starts with an apparently random attack on some folks, one of whom has telepathy, at a university. Then, after that somewhat standard thriller fare, it shifts to a horrifically grotesque scene at a Nazi Concentration Camp with mass slaughter and individual sadism. It gets worse from there, as the book seems to be relentlessly focused upon the awful violence of Ivan the Terrible, the notorious (in real life) Nazi guard who apparently took sadistic pleasure in torturing fellow humans. And this brutality occasionally slows to a trickle, but at that point the shell shock is there. I admit I’m a little more squeamish about violence than I used to be, but this amount feels like it would get at even the most hardened soul. It’s awful. And I know that the real life things that happened were awful, too. I just, I guess I went in without knowing anything about the book and very much did not expect to get smashed in the face by such disturbing scenes.\n\nThe rest of the story is somewhat predictable fare, too. Sawyer attempts to mesh a kind of mystery novel in with telepathy and genetic engineering and there is at least one too many plot threads happening here for the good of the story. It doesn’t quite have the deftness a mystery requires, nor the relevance to the plot telepathy needed to have to make it all make sense. There’s a sense of incompleteness here, which, when coupled with the extremely high content warnings, made the book a dud for me. I like many of Sawyer’s other novels quite a bit, this one is just not for me.\n\n1998- ’98 wasn’t the best year. What I can say of it is that these novels are quite different by subgenre. Forever Peace was good, but didn’t get pushed into my upper echelon of sci-fi favorites. Overall, the year leaves me feeling pretty ho-hum about the whole experience, so let’s look at other releases from 1997 that would have been eligible, shall we? Wait, I haven’t really read any of those, nor do any of them strike me as major misses. Maybe it just wasn’t a good year for science fiction. The fantasy novels fare maybe slightly better, with The Long Patrol, a novel in the Redwall series that’s quite good and Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (the original release overseas). The Moon and the Sun by Vonda McIntyre is there, too, which I have yet to read but based on the other McIntyre I’ve read is likely at least passable. Overall, though, it looks like 1997 was just a tough year to draw nominations from. Are there any that stand out to you that I may have missed?
