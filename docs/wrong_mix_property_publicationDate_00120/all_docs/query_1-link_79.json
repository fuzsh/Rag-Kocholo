        "text": "Forever Peace by Joe Haldeman\n\nReview by Nicholas Whyte\n\nThis is the sixteenth in a series of reviews of those pieces of written science fiction and fantasy which have won both the Hugo and Nebula awards. I have been writing these in alphabetical order by title, and Forever Peace is the first of a run of four novels; the next three reviews will be of its predecessor The Forever War, Arthur C. Clarke's The Fountains of Paradise, and Fred Pohl's Gateway.\n\nJulian Class and his lover Amelia Harding are physicists at a Texas university in 2049. Julian is also a part-time conscripted soldier, fighting ten days a month in the Central American front of a war between the developed world and the developing world, but doing his fighting by remote control as the brains of a military robot. He and his platoon are linked by a neurological modification known as \"jacking\" which enables them to share each others' sensations, experiences and memories. He is also the part-time narrator of the book, which drops into third person now and then, giving the impression that his memories have been assembled by a later editor to make a coherent whole. Haldeman used a slightly similar presentation in his earlier The Long Habit of Living and I first came across this technique used to devastating effect in the books based on the TV series Yes, Minister! and Yes, Prime Minister! In this case, of course, it helps the author get around the problem of a first-person narrator who has suicidal impulses; by dropping into the third person now and again we readers are kept guessing as to whether or not the narrator makes it to the end of the book (cf. Podkayne of Mars, Flowers for Algernon.)\n\nWhen Haldeman writes in the foreword to Forever Peace that it examines some of the problems of his earlier novel, The Forever War, \"from an aspect that didn't exist twenty years ago\", one of the problems in question must surely be the evolution of humanity towards the day \"when violence towards another human being must become as abhorrent as eating another's flesh\", to use the words of Martin Luther King quoted in the first pages of the book. The aspect that (I guess) didn't exist in 1974 is the concept of nanotechnology and by extension the whole set of ideas about the human/computer interface associated with the cyberpunk movement, which came to the fore in sf only in the 1990s. It transpires that those who have been \"jacked\" with other people for more than two weeks become \"humanised\", incapable of deadly violence against other human beings. Julian and Amelia (who for various reasons are both excluded from being affected in this way themselves) decide that this is a Good Thing and conspire with their friends to get the entire command structure of the US military modified in this way.\n\nThere is a second conspiracy, one which they are working against. It turns out that the vastly ambitious particle physics experiment Amelia has been working on has the potential to end the universe (or at least the solar system) by replicating the conditions of the Big Bang. A millennialist conspiracy within the higher reaches of the US government decides that the end of the world would be a Good Thing and resolves to thwart Amelia's efforts to prevent the experiment from being carried out. Various agents are sent to stop them, including a memorably sexy female assassin. But the good guys triumph just in time. Some find the idea of such conspiracies at high level in the US government unconvincing. Well, first of all, it's a novel, and novels contain things which are not true but make a good story. Secondly, I've been sufficiently involved in shedding light on various Balkan conspiracies involving the highest levels of government that little can surprise me any more.\n\nThe future war in Central America is between a developed world fighting largely by remote control, and an indigenous population absorbing most of the casualties; from the 1997 perspective, this must have seemed a reasonable extrapolation from the 1990-91 Gulf War, and indeed Kosovo in 1999 and Afghanistan in 2001 were largely fought on that basis. Haldeman even has a massive, one-off attack on a major American city, though it's nuking Atlanta rather than jumbo jets in New York. The descriptions of the conflict are graphic, on a par with Lucius Shepard's Life In Wartime, and the narrative is particularly gripping as the assassin closes in on our heroes towards the end. As a novel, it works. The portrayal of Julian's suicidal impulses and emotional confusion is convincing, and we the readers can see what is really going on for Amelia through his perceptions. The fact that neither main characters is able to share in the jacked consciousness of the newly enhanced humanity is rather poignant. The final couple of pages, describing the victory of the good guys, are perhaps a little too rapid, and when we first encounter those who have already been \"humanised\" in their North Dakota hideout, I found the scene rather reminiscent of the decaying scientists in the 1983 Doctor Who story Mawdryn Undead, which slightly spoiled it for me. But in general, I felt the tone was more mature and the ending more plausible, if the style a little less raw, than Haldeman's earlier Hugo and Nebula winner, The Forever War.\n\nOne of the least successful aspects of Haldeman's earlier book is its portrayal of a pacifist end-state for the human race. The Big Idea of Forever Peace is that this pacifist end-state can be achieved by technological intervention; through the sharing of our common humanity via \"jacking\". Now, the idea that the Next Big Step in human evolution will involve a fundamental shift in consciousness is quite an old one, with honorable antecedents in Olaf Stapledon and George Bernard Shaw up to Arthur C Clarke's Childhood's End and Greg Bear's Blood Music. The angle is still an unusual one. I was reminded a bit of Frank Herbert's minor novel, The Santaroga Barrier, where the hero begins by rejecting the prospect of a new form of human consciousness but end up eagerly participating. Forever Peace's biggest flaw, as a novel examining issues of humanity and morality, is that it lacks an examination of the ethics of forcing major (and risky) brain surgery on people to bestow on them the benefits of the evolutionary leap forward.\n\nOn another matter entirely: since the Nebulas changed their eligibility criteria to allow novels to be considered two years running, the number of works winning both Hugo and Nebula has decreased quite dramatically. Between 1966 and 1996, 15 novels and 34 shorter works pulled off the double, ie on average more than one each year, in each case winning Hugo and Nebula for different years but awarded in the same year. Since 1996, one novel (Forever Peace) and one shorter work (Jack Williamson's \"The Ultimate Earth\") have managed to win both awards, in both cases for the same year but awarded in different years.\n\nIt seems quite clear that, for whatever reason, the profiles of the sf likely to win each award has diverged. My own experience is that the Nebula Award final ballot is not very useful for me in identifying novels that I would like to read, and two of the three awards for Best Novel made since Forever Peace are, in my humble opinion, completely incomprehensible*. The Hugo shortlist, on the other hand, always includes several books that I already own and I usually enjoy tracking down and reading the others; and while I may disagree with three of the four Hugos for Best Novel awarded since Forever Peace I can at least understand what the voters saw in them**. Perhaps there are SF readers out there for whom the Nebulas in recent years make sense, but I have not heard from any of them. If you are one, please let me know.\n\nNormally I like to link in to other people's reviews of a particular book in the body of my own article. The sheer number of reviews of Forever Peace on the web - I guess because this books actually came out when people were in the first flush of setting up their home pages - basically meant I couldn't do that this time. Here instead is a listing of those that I found at all useful when thinking about what to write:\n\nby Robert Francis at the SF Site\n\nby Steven H Silver, also at the SF Site\n\nby Donna MacMahon, yet another at the SF Site\n\nby John Mort, for Booklist magazine\n\nby Judy Clark, at Mostly Fiction\n\nby Aaron Hughes of the Denver Science Fiction & Fantasy Book Club\n\nby Noel K.

Briggs at Yet Another Book Review Site\n\nby Clinton Lawrence in Science Fiction Weekly\n\nby Florian Breitsameter (in German) at SF-Fan.de\n\nby Birgit Will (also in German) at epilog\n\nby John Savage in Savage Reviews\n\nby Evelyn Leeper at NESFA (and elsewhere)\n\nby Nick Christenson at JetCafe\n\nby Steve Troy at his Award Winners Review site\n\nby Joaqu√≠n Medina Serrano (in Spanish)\n\nby Dan Sobczak at Nuketown\n\nby Michael Rawdon\n\nby the Bloomington, Indiana, Science Fiction Discussion Group\n\nby John J Reilly\n\nby Megan C. \"Raven\" Morris of Raven's Reviews\n\nby Neal Ziring\n\nby James E. Henderson\n\nA Marxist analysis\n\nAlso I normally include the rankings of the book reviewed and its Hugo and Nebula rivals nominees from Tristrom Cooke's Internet Top 100 SF/Fantasy List. I had expected this to be a more laborious task for Forever Peace, because of the much larger number of books involved. I have in fact abandoned the attempt, really because many of the votes for Tristrom's list predate the publication of Forever Peace and unusually it simply doesn't provide sensible statistics. In this case I has prioritised the Amazon sales ranks of the other Hugo and Nebula short-listed novels against which Forever Peace competed1.\n\nThe next review in this series will be of Haldeman's earlier Hugo and Nebula winner, The Forever War.\n\nForever Peace won the 1998 Hugo Award for Best Novel\n\nOther novels shortlisted for Hugo: City on Fire, by Walter Jon Williams; The Rise of Endymion, by Dan Simmons; Frameshift, by Robert J.

Sawyer 181,106 - The Last Hawk, by Catherine Asaro 567,825 3388 Jack Faust, by Michael Swanwick 717,827 - City on Fire, by Walter Jon Williams\n\n* For the record: I consider The Parable of the Talents, by Octavia Butler, to be a comprehensible and worthy winner of the Nebula Award for 2000, though had I been voting I would probably have gone for George R.R. Martin's A Clash of Kings or Ken MacLeod's The Cassini Division. I cannot say the same for Greg Bear's Darwin's Radio, which beat both A Civil Campaign by Lois McMaster Bujold and Midnight Robber by Nalo Hopkinson for the 2001 award. And while the 2002 shortlist is generally uninspiring, with the singular exception of George R.R. Martin's superb A Storm of Swords, I simply cannot comprehend the award going to Catherine Asaro's The Quantum Rose, with its awful stereotyped romantic lead characters and contrived attempts to link the plot to quantum mechanics.\n\n** The Hugo Award I agree with was the 1999 one to To Say Nothing Of the Dog, by Connie Willis. For 2000 I'd have picked A Civil Campaign or Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon over A Deepness in the Sky, for 2001 Ken MacLeod's The Sky Road or George R.R. Martin's A Storm of Swords rather than Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and for 2002 Bujold's Curse of Chalion rather than Gaiman's American Gods, but I'll admit that it's a close call in all three cases and I certainly respect the judgement of those who voted the other way.\n\nTell me what you think!\n\nRelated pages on this site:\n\nsf index page | sf thoughts and links | a check-list of sf and fantasy set in Ireland\n\nlist of joint Hugo and Nebula winners | meta-review of the 2006 Hugo nominees | meta-review of the 2005 Hugo nominees | meta-review of the 2004 Hugo nominees | meta-review of the 2003 Hugo nominees | reviews of the 2002 Hugo nominees | thoughts on the 2000 Hugo nominations | all Hugo and Nebula winners | analysis of winners by age and year of birth | first time winners and gender balance\n\nAuthors: Tepper / Bujold / Willis / Russell | Pratchett / Martin / Gentle | Simmons / Strugatsky / Lem / Wells / Brunner | Zelazny | Clarke / Aldiss / McDonald / MacLeod\n\nReviews:\n\nPoul Anderson, \"Goat Song\"\n\nIsaac Asimov, \"The Bicentennial Man\"\n\nIsaac Asimov, \"The Gods Themselves\"\n\nGreg Bear, \"Blood Music\"\n\nGreg Bear, Darwin's Radio\n\nTerry Bisson, \"Bears Discover Fire\"\n\nTerry Bisson, \"macs\"\n\nLois McMaster Bujold, A Civil Campaign\n\nOctavia Butler, \"Bloodchild\"\n\nThe Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction\n\nMark Campbell, Pocket Essentials: Doctor Who\n\nOrson Scott Card, Ender's Game\n\nTed Chiang, Hell Is the Absence of God\n\nArthur C.
