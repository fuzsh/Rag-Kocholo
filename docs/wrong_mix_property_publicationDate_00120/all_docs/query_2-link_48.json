        "text": "It’s this week’s weird fiction to be discussed over at LibraryThing.\n\nReview: “The Graveyard Rats”, Henry Kuttner, 1936.\n\nThis will be a short one because there’s not much point doing a detailed description of this claustrophobic, short tale. It’s sometimes included in the Cthulhu Mythos though I see no overt connection other than, perhaps, the hint of ghouls under Salem’s graveyard which kind of links it, thematically, to H. P. Lovecraft’s “Pickman’s Model”. It’s also been included, with more justification, in anthologies of zombie stories.\n\nIt involves Old Masson, the caretaker of Salem’s graveyard. There are opening hints that Salem still has practitioners of witchcraft still about, and the locals give the cemetery a wide birth.\n\nMasson is a corrupt man who loots corpses for their gold teeth and other valuables interred with them. He has seen very large rats in the graveyard and the many strange, large burrows they have dug. They even cleverly gnaw through the ends of coffins and pull bodies out.\n\nAnd that is in the process of happening to a corpse Masson means to pilfer. He goes after, revolver in hand, into those tunnels, is attacked by those rats, sees strange figures behind them (ghouls presumably), and a corpse that comes to life.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nI’m not even going to pretend I’m off writing up new posts.\n\nSo, you get piece from the archives.\n\nRaw Feed (1989): The Company Man, Joe Clifford Faust, 1988.\n\nI liked four things about this book.\n\nFirst, Faust treated the topic of corporate warfare plausibly and rationally. In this world, most corporate warfare is sabotage and petty disruptions of research (“pizza deliveries”) and espionage. Assassination and bombings are extreme measures, and we see no corporate armies in the traditional sense. Faust avoids the sensationalism in this regard that I suspect others would have succumbed to.\n\nSecond, I liked the fact that Andrew Birch and Nello and most of the other company men we met weren’t hardened, evil killers. Killing is a rare event in their profession and not something they take to easily.\n\nThirdly, I liked Birch and Nello’s relationship and the general family atmosphere of the company men. Even at the end of the novel, after they clashed and Nello betrays Birch, Nello and Birch bear no hard feelings towards each other and part friends.\n\nFourth, I surprisingly liked Birch and Lucy Healy’s romance. Usually, a romance is thrown into these sort of action-suspense novels (whether sf or not) to provide a little sex. Interestingly enough, our hero Birch never has sex in this novel. An unusual feature, but I certainly did not mind. It was a good change of pace. The only sex in this book is of a decidedly unpleasant and/or kinky nature. Here, Birch’s meeting with Lucy was tender, realistic (I liked the touch of her being a devout Catholic reluctant to commit or have sex.) and was important in making Birch think about his life. I was glad they got together and stayed together. I also like Jade Healow, and Birch’s near romance with her. In fact, all the major characters were done well. Birch could be very irritable and raging at times (partly due to drugs, partly an act, and partly his true nature). I liked Birch and Nello shoring up each others’ resolves in their surveillance duties.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe point of my recent Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler reading is that I thought McQuay might have written this novel in a similar style though it’s not a detective story. After all, before this book, he wrote four Matthew Swain novels, a science fiction hardboiled detective series. That definitely was inspired by Chandler. But, no, there’s no real influence of Hammett or Chandler on this one.\n\nThis isn’t my first time reading McQuay. One of Arthur C. Clarke’s late career books (basically, outlined by Clarke, Richter 10, was actually written by McQuay. Not only did I make no notes on it, but it left no trace in my memory.\n\nI haven’t gone out of my way to read books set in Arabic or Islamic dominated futures, but this book was written earlier than others I’ve read: part of George Alec Effinger’s Budayeen series (1987), Donald Moffitt’s Crescent Sky series (1989), and Tom Kratman’s Caliphate (2008). Their attitude about the desirability and quality of life with such a prospect varies.\n\nReview: Jitterbug, Mike McQuay, 1984.\n\nUnlike with movies, it’s hard to tell what a publisher expected from a book, but I get the impression they expected this book to sell well. It was shepherded at Bantam Books by new, hotshot editor Lou Aronica. It has all the earmarks of a hoped-for bestseller. It was 406 pages of story – long for the time, has a map of the parts of the world (North America and the Arabian Peninsula) where the story takes place, a table of organization for the Light of the World corporation which runs the world, a glossary of terms (mostly Arabic and Islamic), a timeline running from 570 to 2151, and a long description of the symptomology, transmission, infection paths, and origin of the Jitterbug virus (in an oh-so 1980s, pre-HIV way, it’s a modified herpes virus). The cover art (was Mick Jagger the model for glowering character in the center?) looks like it was for a contemporary, exotic epic.\n\nAnd, yet, this book has faded from thought. It was never reprinted. McQuay died at a young age which probably didn’t help.\n\nNow, there are plenty of forgotten books. A quick look around the Web of a Million Lies doesn’t provide much reason why this is better remembered. You would expect some complaints about “Islamophobia”, but I didn’t see any. There are some people complaining about its “problematic” view of women. (Beware of any reviewer using “problematic” in any way but ironically.)\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWe’re sort of in the midst of series on science fiction detective and crime stories (at least in my association-driven mind — probably not obvious to you readers). So you get another Raw Feed while I write up new posts.\n\nThis stands as proof I don’t give good reviews to everything I read.\n\nRaw Feed (1992): Destroying Angel, Richard Paul Russo, 1992.\n\nThis was a disappointing novel.\n\nIt’s one of those crime stories where the crime and apprehension of the criminal is almost irrelevant, certainly not the thrust of story, and the cyborg Destroying Angel was not very interesting. Rather characters and the creation of a gritty, grimy world is the point of this book.\n\nRusso is pretty successful in creating that ambience with descriptions of heat, humidity, sweat, greasy coffee, and futuristic slums. But it’s an empty accomplishment in service of a contrived future. One senses another (fairly subtle) attack on conservative economics in the description of future street people which are there because of free market economics. Nothing explicit — just a feeling.\n\nThis book belongs to the cyberpunk sub-genre with a heavy emphasis on the low-life and not the hi-tech. Unfortunately, it’s incorporated the worst cyberpunk cliches with the high orbital colony of New Hong Kong as the heavenly rich paradise of wealth and regenerated limbs and the hell of the futuristic San Francisco with the Core serving as a sort of Mircea Eliadean world center for this novel (there’s even a reworked quotation from Dante’s Inferno at one entrance of the Core).\n\nOur hero Louis Tanner constantly ruminates about how grim and awful the world is, and the novel’s main story is him gaining hope. Yet it’s a contrived, illogical, cliched grimness. Besides the schism between rich orbiters versus poor Earthers being reminiscent of Walter Jon Williams Hardwired (and, to a lesser extent, William Gibson’s Neuromancer), the sleazy, elaborately secure, secretive Tenderloin and Core reminded me of George Alec Effinger’s Budayeen. (Skoozie reminded me of similar girlish skate punk character in Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash — though that and this novel were published virtually simultaneously.)\n\nContinue reading →\n\nI’m off writing up new posts. (Is my last post not proof of that?) So, you get the last bit of Vernor Vinge material in the archives.\n\nRaw Feed (2003): “The Cookie Monster”, Vernor Vinge, Analog Science Fiction and Fact, October 2003.\n\nVinge is very aware that this story is operating in a long tradition in sf, specifically the artificial world set up for amusement or research purposes. He even has his characters name some examples: Theodore Sturgeon’s “Microcosmic God”, Frederik Pohl’s “Tunnel Under the World“, John Varley’s “Overdrawn at the Memory Bank”, Robert Charles Wilson’s Darwinia, Moravec’s ‘Pigs in Cyberspace'” (I assume that’s Hans Moravec), Galouye’s Simulacron-3, David Brin’s “Stones of Significance” and Kiln People.\n\nI’m familiar with most of these as being about worlds simulated in mechanical simulacra or computers and the related theme of personality recordings and uploadings (which then can be inserted into a computer simulation). I don’t recognize Vinge’s own self-referential mention of “deathcubes”.\n\nI generally like this theme. In literary sf, I’m quite fond of the similar “News from D Street” by Andrew Weiner and Barry B. Longyear’s “Adagio”, but this story didn’t do much for me.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nIt’s last week’s subject of weird fiction discussion over at LibaryThing.\n\nReview: “The Hell Screen”, Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, trans. Morinaka Akira, 1918.\n\nLong on description, this story doesn’t exactly have an unexpected ending given its foreshadowing, but it’s still interesting and enjoyable. Ryūnoskuke supplied the source material for the famous film Rashomon. It’s famous for multiple narrators telling us their version of events, and maybe our narrator here doesn’t understand what’s going on either.\n\nThe story is told in 20 parts starting with many anecdotes about the High Lord of Horikawa. all of them deserving of “wonderment”. The narrator has served with him for more than twenty years.\n\nBut he’s not going to tell us much about them. He’s going to tell us about the most terrifying thing he saw in that time. It’s the story of Yoshihide, the painter of the Hell scene on a screen that’s part of the Lord’s treasure.\n\nPeople barely remember Yoshihide now, but, in his day, he was thought the greatest painter. He was already over 50 when the narrator first met him, an old man of vulgar appearance, slanderously nicknamed Saruhide (Monkey-hide). Yoshihide’s wife was dead then, and he had only one child, the intelligent and very beautiful Yuzuki, fifteen years-old and a lady-in-waiting in the Lord’s court.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nMore stuff from the archive regarding Vernor Vinge though, in this case, he’s just a small part of a big anthology.\n\nRaw Feed (2002): Explorers: SF Adventures to Far Horizons, ed. Gardner Dozois, 2000.\n\n“Preface”, Gardner Dozois — Brief look at the theme of exploration stories in world literature and exploration stories in sf. Dozois notes that the theme wanes and blooms in interest amongst writers. Ironically, when real space exploration, at least of the manned variety, was winding down, space exploration stories in sf were picking up. They used the new scientific findings for romantic and adventure stories set in space like the old planetary romances used uncontradicted speculations.\n\n“The Sentinel”, Arthur C. Clarke — This is at least the second time I’ve read this story which I did not remembered being set in 1996.\n\n“Moonwalk”, H. B. Fyfe — A man against nature tale that reminded me strongly of Jack London, particularly his “Building a Fire”, and the true story of mountain man John Colter. This 1952 story has the sole survivor of a lunar tractor accident walking away from it, trying to find help from his fellow explorers far away before his oxygen gives out. (His wife is one of the members of the lunar base.) Fyfe even throws in some grandiose descriptions of the lunar landscape.\n\n“Grandpa”, James H. Schmitz — The only other time I’ve read this story is about 25 years ago, but I remembered most of it. It’s still a clever story of the unraveling-a-deadly-secret-of-an-alien-ecosystem variety. It does, however, make me want to read more of Schmitz. He strikes me as just as clever at working out alien ecosystems.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe look at Vernor Vinge continues with another . . .\n\nRaw Feed (2000): A Deepness in the Sky, Vernor Vinge, 1999.\n\nThe only possible aesthetic objection, on a science fictional level, to this novel is that its aliens, the so-called Spiders, are not all that alien apart from hibernating in the centuries when their sun powers down, seeing across a spectrum wider than human eyes do (which complicates and inhibits the development of their version of tv), being seemingly smarter than humans, and, of course, their appearance. While Vinge creates some captivating alien characters in Sherkaner Underhill, Victory Smith, their children and Hrunkner, they are not as strange as the Tines in his A Fire Upon the Deep to which this is a prequel (his “The Blabber” also belongs to the series).\n\nIn every other respect – speculation and literary craftsmanship – this novel succeeds very well. Vinge introduced the idea of the Singularity in his Marooned in Realtime, and it was taken up by other sf writers as well as futurists.\n\nThe notion here that seems to be new is, perhaps, not as startling but perhaps more probable: the idea of a Programmer-Archaeologist. Humans, particularly the Qeng Ho, use computer systems, programs, and languages that have accreted for centuries. Some programs date back to before humanity’s venturing into space. Programmer-Archaeologists are just an extreme example of some of the tasks of modern programmers who try to determine exactly what a program can do, not do, and possibilities for modifications.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nI’m working on new stuff, so you get more old stuff on Vernor Vinge.\n\nRaw Feed (1992): Grimm’s World, Vernor Vinge, 1969.\n\nWhile it’s kind of unfair to criticize an author’s first novel after reading his superb latest one, I must say this was kind of a disappointment.\n\nThe first part was good. It was in the vein of Vinge’s “The Barbarian Princess” with Tatja Grimm ruthlessly manipulating others for her own ends — here to get a kingdom. There were some minor inconsistencies between this and “The Barbarian Princess” (Coronadas Ascvasenya is here called a First Proofreader, seemingly a step down from her assistant editorship of four years in the story’s past. Nor does she mention that she introduced Grimm to the wonderful Tarulle Corporation. (It’s a great world where sf is classic literature.) I wonder if this is resolved in the omnibus Tatja Grimm’s World.\n\nHowever, the second part with its Fortean we-are-property plot and warring aliens was kind of disappointing and boring. Oddly enough, I liked the landscape descriptions. Vinge’s lengthy descriptions in A Fire Upon the Deep were obviously not a fluke (as I recall his Marooned in Realtime had lots of landscape descriptions too).\n\nAnd I liked the details of a metal poor world. I also found the end of this — at least for the character of Svir Hedrigs — uncharacteristically grim.\n\nIt’s not sloth that’s keeping me from posting new stuff. It’s tweaking a new laptop and looking around for options to get another, legit copy of Microsoft Professional 2016 ’cause — with the exception of backup and security software — I don’t rent my software and media. I buy it.\n\nWhich is a long way of justifying why you get another installment on Vernor Vinge, a very short …\n\nRaw Feed (1992): “The Barbarian Princess”, Vernor Vinge, Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact, Sept. 1986.\n\nI haven’t read a bad Vernor Vinge story yet. This has, as you would expect, the same setting as Vinge’s Grimm’s World. It was nice to reread this tale of Tatja Grimm and how, with her formidable intelligence, she learns to use fraud and people as tools, here to save the editor of the wonderful floating Fantasie magazine which publishes science fiction on a primitive, metal poor world."
