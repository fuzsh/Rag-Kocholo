        "text": "It's been over a decade since I finished my fantasy book binge, which burnt me out on reading. Went through A-Z the fantasy sections of the libraries in my town, getting my hands on books that had somewhat interesting premises. But now that I've gotten older, I've been drawn to fiction that focuses on inter-character drama. Rather than big bads ending the world, epic-after-epic battles.\n\nIf I had to point to something, the BBC series I Claudius from the 1980's has the vibe I'm after. The dialogue was very well written, and gripping performances by the actors. Big events? Sure, but it's how a handful of characters speak about it and play off each other that keeps you hooked.\n\nIt's the same with roleplay, which I've done on and off over the years in multiplayer games. Writing out the dynamics between characters is great, even over mundane matters. Some of my favourite writing that I've done (and read!) was by others just fleshing out their characters' perspectives and emotions in response to another doing the same.\n\nIdeally high fantasy, as I love otherwordly settings. One of my favourite series was Dune (fairly common I reckon) from how alien the, err, alien world was written.\n\nThe usual recommendation I've come across are the Conan books by Robert E. Howard, but they were filled with sudden retcons, the main character was actually pretending the whole time and expected xyz, the protagonist is smartest, strongest, most beautiful person ever, etc. The books left me feeling more annoyed and disappointed, than wanting to read the next work ASAP.\n\n(Obligatory LoTR) I also tried reading the Lord of the Rings, as well as the Silmarillion, but Tolkein is very, very dry. Felt more like large exposition dumps with the characters as vehicles, rather than gripping dialogue that made me want to comb through each line, and how it was said.\n\ntl;dr: Serious high fantasy/sci-fi with gripping character interactions & naturally flowing dialogue.\n\nLooking forward to any recommendations!\n\nConan the our of the Dragon by Robert E Howard\n\nBloodstone by Karl Edward Wagner. first book in the Kane the mystic swordsman series\n\nKothar Barbarian Swordsman by Gardner Francis Fox\n\nLest Darkness Fall by L Spageu de Camp\n\nDay of the Giants by Lester Del Rey\n\nThe Broken Sword by Poul Anderson\n\nKnights Wyrd by Debra Doyle and James D MacDonald\n\nThe Dark World by Henry Kuttner\n\nBlack Gods Kiss by C L Moore\n\nCrom by Kenneth Flint\n\nThe Darwaith Trilogy by Barbara Hambly\n\nJohn Balladeer by Manley Wade Wellman\n\nThe Dragon Lord by David Drake\n\nWolf Moon by Charles de Lint\n\nStarting right out with a Conan book. Is that one better written than his other works? I've read Man-Eaters of Zamboula, and Gods of the North. Which, err, weren't great. Which of those in your list would you say have the best dialogue and character interactions?\n\nHigh fantasy with quality dialogue and character development which is not a Tolkein pastiche. Not S&S. Not EFP, but reasonably close to standard fantasy tropes. Hmmm.\n\nYou could try the Lyonesse books by Jack Vance. Typically delicious Vancean dialogue and wry humour.\n\nThree which are not typical high fantasy, but worth it for character development and quality writing:\n\nLud InThe Mist by Hope Mirlees\n\nTitus Groan by Mervyn Peake\n\nHowlâ€™s Moving Castle by Diana Wynn Jones\n\nI probably shouldn't rule out sword and sorcery tbf. That's a huge genre, and I do like mythical beasts and (especially evil) fantasy cultures. It's more the fighting avatars of gods, walking between planes of reality, etc., that are overused. I'm interested in other recommendations you've got.\n\nI'll check those books out! Thanks for the recommendations"
