The story is told by the gentle Frankenstein monster himself, picking up the story in the Arctic, June 1782. It continues, with addenda from divers hands, through to 1783. It is revealed that the monster was actually an extraterrestrial observing the experiment who happened, through the lightning bolt, to become intimately involved in it.\n\nBaen Books 65550-7, February 1986\n\nSaffron, Robert, The Demon Device\n\nDuring World War I the British government comes into information that the Germans are building a new type of weapon.

Upon returning to England he defuses the only existing atomic bomb and dumps it into the ocean  having been swayed by Albert Einstein's views about this device. Arthur Conan Doyle ostensibly communicated this story to the author by Spiritualistic means after his death.
