Dangers faced as the chase continues force the brilliant crew to devise evermore complex chemical, biological, and mechanical solutions to keep the ship and themselves intact and functioning.\n\nMid-August New Arrivals\n\ncompiled by John O'Neill\n\nSeptember. Back to School Ads. Admit it -- they still make your skin crawl. But as long as everyone else is buying books, you might as well get into the act. New titles this week include books by Elizabeth Hand, Brian Stableford, Joan Slonczewski, Mike Resnick, Timothy Zahn, R. Andrew Heidel, Denise Vitola, Patricia Briggs, Scott Westerfeld, Camille Bacon-Smith, and Margaret Weis and Don Perrin.\n\nBeyond the Wall of Sleep by R. Andrew Heidel\n\nreviewed by Chris Donner\n\nThis short collection of prose and poetry makes for an interesting if enigmatic mixture. There is something tantalizing about the writing itself, its honest portrayal of what soon becomes a common theme: searching. The stories are short and to the point, and they are also quite addictive.\n\nThe House of Doors by Brian Lumley\n\nreviewed by Stephen M. Davis\n\nA large, alien craft has landed in the Scottish countryside, taking on the appearance of a castle. The alien on board \"absorbs\" a group of humans into the structure to test human mental breaking points. Stephen found this to be either an unhorrific horror story or an uninspired SF novel.\n\nCyberweb by Lisa Mason\n\nreviewed by Thomas Myer\n\nThomas wasn't thrilled with this novel. To him, it is a bouillabaisse of overeager \"Big Brother\" machinations, needlessly desperate characters, and, strangely enough, in a fluid technological society, a class system as rigid and defined as a stained glass window.\n\nPi written & directed by Darren Aronofsky\n\nreviewed by Chris Donner\n\nAronofsky's first full-length film is a work of art, deftly displaying a fine sense of what is really emotive about a situation. While he portrays the beauty of everyday life quite convincingly, if Aronofsky wants you to be frightened, he doesn't waste time on tricks and effects. Instead, he simply loosens his hold on the bleak sense of fear and uncertainty that pervades this film, and you quickly learn what suspense is really about.\n\nThe Enemy Papers by Barry B. Longyear\n\nreviewed by Steven H Silver\n\nThe saga of Human and Drac interaction began in 1979 with the award-winning short story, \"Enemy Mine.\" It saw a sequel in the form of the novel, The Tomorrow Testament, and now the series is concluded in a new novel, The Last Enemy. All three are compiled in this one book, together with The Talman, the collected wisdom of the Drac which is quoted and alluded to throughout the three stories, and essays by Longyear about writing this series and about formulating an alien language.\n\nCandles For Elizabeth by Caitlín R. Kiernan\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nThe stories in this chapbook are Caitlín R. Kiernan stories and that makes them vitally important to the horror genre. There is no need to repeat the list of woes striking the horror fiction field. Before things can begin to look up again, true originals like Kiernan are going to have to get the credit and readers they deserve.\n\nSlant by Greg Bear\n\nreviewed by Alexander von Thorn\n\nThe surfeit of cryptic jargon, the dark cynicism and political allegory, the motif of mutilation, of direct neural interface to universes of information -- William Gibson pioneered this territory in the 80s. But Greg Bear is writing as much in the tradition of Aldous Huxley and Alvin Toffler as William Gibson. This novel is filled with profound ideas and striking images.\n\nStarswarm by Jerry Pournelle\n\nreviewed by Steven MacDonald\n\nPournelle's first solo outing in years is an old-style adventure novel. Like most of his work, this is hard SF, and yet the strongest element is unquestionably the characterization. It's a dynamic coming-of-age tale, set in the future. And it offers ample explanation for Pournelle's longevity as an SF writer.\n\nCarcosa\n\ncompiled by Rodger Turner\n\nCarcosa published only four books but their influence is evident throughout the field. Their books of stories by Manly Wade Wellman, E. Hoffmann Price and Hugh B. Cave plus the artwork of Lee Brown Coye and George Evans has influenced a generation of writers and artists.\n\nQueen of Demons by David Drake\n\nreviewed by Victoria Strauss\n\nWhat lifts this novel and before it, Lord of the Isles, well beyond the ordinary run of epic fantasy is the outstanding world-building. It's rare to read books that evoke a period and a culture as vigorously as is done for Drake's imaginary realm of the Isles. He's built a fictive society as vivid, consistent, and believable as any real one.\n\nBeaker's Dozen by Nancy Kress\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nWhat, exactly, distinguishes her fiction? It may be the sheer intelligence and curiosity behind the work. It may be the relevance of the subject matter. It may be the seamless storytelling. Just possibly, it is the instant attraction of her fiction that never wanes throughout the narrative, regardless of the length of the story.\n\nFreddy the Detective by Walter R. Brooks\n\nreviewed by Georges T. Dodds\n\nWith a generally optimistic outlook, Freddy, the resourceful talking pig, and the other denizens of Mr. Bean's barnyard give this book a genuine but not sickly-sweet feeling of family that lends them much of their charm.\n\nDeepdrive by Alexander Jablokov\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nIf only the human race had FTL propulsion, then we could touch the stars. Who knows what other life forms we might encounter and what technologies they might share with us? It seldom occurs to us that other races may have no intention of sharing.\n\nThe Novels of Jaran by Kate Elliott\n\nreviewed by Todd Richmond\n\nAt four volumes and over 2,250 pages, this series may seem daunting -- but it's certainly worth reading. The saga sweeps across the galaxy, involving war, romance, intrigue and treachery. The Jaran series is truly an epic masterpiece, conveying a story of the dreams of conquest and rebellion by a pair of charismatic men and the woman who is linked to them both.\n\nThe Wild Hunt: Vengeance Moon by Jocelin Foxe\n\nreviewed by Regina Lynn Preciado\n\nAs with all good curses, this one has a loophole. If someone is strong enough and cares enough about a member of the Wild Hunt to fight against the Goddesses' call, that Huntsman can be freed. It has happened once in all the centuries since the Hunt's inception... This is an original and compelling first novel, with a different twist on the fantasy genre. Be warned, however: it's the first in a series and stops short at a cruel cliffhanger.\n\nDream Thieves by Steven Lee Climer\n\nreviewed by Lisa DuMond\n\nThis novel is genuine horror, told in an almost baroque style that occasionally lulls the reader into a false sense of security as the charming Bavarian landscape flows by. And yanks you back with a claw to the throat. At times, the events are so disturbing, pulling away seems the only decent action.\n\nArthur C. Clarke & Lord Dunsany: A Correspondence edited by Keith Allen Daniels\n\nreviewed by Georges T. Dodds\n\nThis book collects letters between a giant of science fiction at the beginning of his career and an aging, solidly established writer of classic pure fantasy. It is perhaps because Clarke and Dunsany are of such diametrically opposed philosophies that each member of the pair could contribute something to the other.\n\nJack Faust by Michael Swanwick\n\nreviewed by Steven H Silver\n\nReprise review to coincide with the paperback release. It begins as a highly innovative retelling of Johann Faust's legend. Unfortunately, the momentum slows and Faust's descent into amorality loses steam along the way. But it's worth reading, despite this.\n\nNanotime by Bart Kosko\n\nreviewed by Wayne MacLaurin\n\nReprise review to coincide with the paperback release. Here is a startlingly realistic glimpse at our future and the world's reliance on oil as a major source of energy. This world of prying government is only a small leap from our own where computer use has made privacy a major issue.\n\nBeneath the Vaulted Hills by Sean Russell\n\nreviewed by Rodger Turner\n\nReprise review to coincide with the paperback release. Lord Eldrich, the last of the Mages, is on a tear and woe betide those who stand in his way. The priests who want to end his life, the cult who want his secrets and the minions who do his bidding all struggle to come to grips with the end of an era.\n\nSewer, Gas & Electric by Matt Ruff\n\nreviewed by Leon Olszewski\n\nIn a reprise review to coincide with the paperback release, Leon feels that readers who can take a joke will have a fun time. In this novel, set 26 years from now, you'll meet an outrageous cast of characters, including a hurricane lamp that contains the holographic image and personality of Ayn Rand, and a cybernetic beaver."
