        "text": "There is a rich and satisfying seam of sci-fi novels whose core themes overlap with those of The Knowledge. Here are the very best post-apocalyptic books, as well as other stories involving the exploitation of expertise for rebuilding civilisation, such as by time-travellers thrown far into either the past or future. I’ve listed my favourites below, including a selection of the very best top reads (but not dystopian fiction in general). Clicking the book covers or links will allow you to pick-up these novels yourself. If you’d like to explore this genre of literature further, see this list of post-apocayltpic book clubs around the world where you can discuss your thoughts on different books over a drink with new friends. Also see The Knowledge’s selection of the Best Post-Apocalyptic Movies, Best Post-Apocalyptic Games and Best Post-Apocalyptic Apps.\n\nTop 8:\n\nEarth Abides, George R. Stewart (1949)\n\nRecounts the tribulations and aspirations of a small community for the first few decades of their recovery after a global pandemic. Incidentally, the book title is a biblical quote on the transience of human life: Ecclesiastes, 1, 4 “Men go and come, but earth abides”.\n\nThe Day of the Triffids, John Wyndham (1951)\n\nFor me, the carnivorous plants are no more than a sub-plot in this incredible tale following the survivors of a global catastrophe and the inexorable unravelling of technological capability after the collapse of civilisation. The epigraph for Chapter 3 is taken from here.\n\nOn the Beach, Nevil Shute (1957)\n\nThe final months of a community in Australia as the radioactive clouds from a global nuclear war inexorably spread south towards them. A simple but utterly compelling story, and the ending is no less harrowing despite being clearly anticipated from the very first chapter.\n\nAlas, Babylon, Pat Frank (1959)\n\nA small town in Florida is spared outright annihilation by massive nuclear strike but not the consequences of a devastated society. This is the middle of the classic trio of post-apocaltypitic novels of the early nuclear age (along with Beach and Leibowitz) and served as the inspiration for more recent TV series like Jericho.\n\nA Canticle For Leibowitz, Walter M. Miller, Jr. (1960)\n\nAfter society is crushed by nuclear holocaust, a chapter of monks attempt to preserve and copy the remaining shreds of human knowledge through the ensuing Dark Ages to kindle the eventual recovery of civilisation. Spanning many centuries, Canticle accomplishes a breath-taking scope and offers a cautionary tale on the cyclicality of history.\n\nRiddley Walker, Russell Hoban (1980)\n\nTwo millennia after nuclear war destroyed civilisation, a primitive, nomadic community scavenges remnant iron and believes a curious set of myths.\n\nIsland in the Sea of Time, S.M Stirling (1998)\n\nAn unexplained event transports the island of Nantucket and its inhabitants back into the Bronze Age where they must use their modern knowledge to prevail.\n\nThe Road, Cormac McCarthy (2006)\n\nAn unrelentingly brutal story of father and son travelling through the devastation after an unexplained collapse of society. Also see the equally harrowing film adaptation\n\nOther recommendations:\n\nRobinson Crusoe, Daniel Defoe (1719)\n\nThe original story of restarting from scratch: shipwrecked on a tropical island\n\nA Journal of the Plague Year, Daniel Defoe (1722)\n\nFirst-hand account of the effects of bubonic plague ravishing London\n\nThe Swiss Family Robinson, Johann David Wyss (1812)\n\nEchoing many of the themes of Robinson Crusoe, a ship-wrecked family thrives on an isolated island in the West Indies.\n\nThe Last Man, Mary Shelley (1826)\n\nOne of the earliest post-apocalypse survivor stories. Few remain alive after the world is ravished by plague.\n\nThe Mysterious Island, Jules Verne (1874)\n\nFive American aeronauts are blown far off-course by a storm and crash-land on a deserted island. They must use they knowledge and ingenuity to build a civilised life for themselves. Far more detailed on the actual processes required than Robinson Crusoe\n\nAfter London, Richard Jefferies (1885)\n\nAfter an unspecified catastrophe, England begins to return to nature and the small groups of survivors recede back to a medieval lifestyle.\n\nA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court, Mark Twain (1889)\n\nHank Morgan dozes beneath a tree and wakes in Arthurian England. Using his knowledge of gunpowder he convinces the King that he is a more powerful wizard than Merlin, and attempts to modernise the populace with his other ‘inventions’.\n\nThe Time Machine, H. G. Wells (1895)\n\nThe unnamed inventor jumps far into the future to find a carefree society of Eloi, living among ruins with no industry of their own but cannibalised by the subterranean Morlocks. In later adaptations of the original book, the time-traveller returns to his London home to recover a handful of books to help the Eloi rebuild civilisation.\n\nThe Scarlet Plague, Jack London (1912)\n\nDecades after global epidemic, one survivor attempts to impart his knowledge to his grandchildren before it is too late.\n\nThe Cave Children, A. T. Sonnleitner (1918)\n\nTranslated into English (1971) from the German ‘Die Höhlenkinder’, a tale of two orphaned children in the Alps reinventing civilisation for themselves, one tool at time.\n\nThe Foundation Trilogy, Isaac Asimov: Foundation (1951), Foundation and Empire (1952), Second Foundation (1953)\n\nA ‘psychohistorian’ predicts the decline and fall of the Galactic Empire and attempts to minimise the recovery period by establishing a colony of the most capable individuals and compiling a compendium of all human knowledge.\n\nI Am Legend, Richard Matheson (1954)\n\nThe sole survivor of a mysterious pestilence struggles against hordes of the afflicted. A classic in the vampire/zombie genre. Also see the various film adaptations\n\nThe Death of Grass, John Christopher (1956)\n\nThe continuation of civilisation is threatened not by a plague that affects humans directly, but the crops and other grass species we rely upon.\n\nSome Will Not Die, Algis Budrys (1961)\n\nIn the wake of global epidemic, the survivors struggle to maintain civilised society as the emergent armies go to war.\n\nThe Drowned World, J. G. Ballard (1962)\n\nGlobal warming and rising sea-levels have inundated the cities and the torrid climate regresses to the Triassic era.\n\nThe Plague, Albert Camus (1967)\n\nTranslated from the French, this is a tale of a small town quarantined and isolated when it falls into the grips of a lethal plague.\n\nJunk Day, Arthur Sellings (1970)\n\nBands of post-apocalyptic survivors pick-over the remains of London.\n\nThe Flying Sorcerers, David Gerrold & Larry Niven (1971)\n\nA spacefarer crash lands on a primitive, magic-fearing planet and must improvise the technology needed to escape.\n\nZ For Zachariah, Robert C. O’Brien (1974)\n\nSixteen-year-old Ann has survived nuclear holocaust alone in an isolated valley, and fears the stranger she sees approaching.\n\nDeus Irae, Philip K. Dick and Roger Zelazny (1976)\n\nAn artist journeys through a landscape ravished by fall-out to paint the God of Wrath, the creator of the ultimate weapon.\n\nThe Stand, Stephen King (1978)\n\nA weaponised flu virus escapes containment and wipes out the majority of humanity, setting the stage for the apocalyptic battle between good and evil. Also see the film adaptation.\n\nDown to a Sunless Sea, David Graham (1980)\n\nThe passengers and crew of a long-haul jetliner survive the nuclear war mid-flight, but they must decide where to land.\n\nThe Last Children of Schewenborn (Die Letzten Kinder von Schewenborn), Gudrun Pausewang (1983)\n\nTranslated from the German, an unyielding tale of a family who survive the immediate effects of nuclear war but are wracked by effects of the radiation.\n\nThe Postman, David Brin (1985)\n\nA wanderer finds an old postal service uniform and brings hope of restored government to a post-apocalyptic society tormented by warlords.
