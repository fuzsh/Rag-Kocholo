        "text": "The Faust myth reinterpreted for the information age. At the turn of the 16th century in the city of Wittenberg, Magister Faust is made an offer he cannot refuse by a force he cannot resist. If he accepts the offer he will know all there is to know, have answers to the mysteries of physics, astronomy and religion that have long frustated him, but if he accepts he will also be condemning the human race to inevitable death. Or so says the demon, Mephistopheles. With the sharing of demonic knowledge comes the race for ever greater technological breakthroughs - within scant years the inventions of the twentiethcentury, the atrocity machines, are ready...Mesphistopheles' vision of the end of mankind is days away - a dictator is risen and the final nuclear confrontation looms\n\nMichael Swanwick was born in 1950. He is recognised as one of the most powerful and consistently inventive writers of his generation. THE IRON DRAGON'S DAUGHTER was shortlisted for the World Fantasy Award; it was a New York Times Notable Book, as was JACK FAUST. He has been nominated for the Nebula Award more than a dozen times and won a Hugo for his SF novel STATIONS OF THE TIDE. He lives with his wife and son in Philadelphia."
