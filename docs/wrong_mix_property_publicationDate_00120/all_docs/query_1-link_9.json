        "text": "A Reinterpretation of the Faust myth for the information age. Jack Faust despairs of ever finding the answers to the mysteries of religion, physics and astronomy that have plagued him for decades and is found by his assistant destroying every 1 of his precious books. But Faust's despair is not to last long, for the demon Mephistopheles has heard his loud entreaties and has come with a bargain - the soul of Faust in exchange for all the knowledge humanity could ever desire. But what will Faust do with this knowledge, carrying in his mind the burning image of the end that humanity will be brought to if he takes up the Demon's offer.\n\nMichael Swanwick was born in 1950. He is recognised as one of the most powerful and consistently inventive writers of his generation. THE IRON DRAGON'S DAUGHTER was shortlisted for the World Fantasy Award; it was a New York Times Notable Book, as was JACK FAUST. He has been nominated for the Nebula Award more than a dozen times and won a Hugo for his SF novel STATIONS OF THE TIDE. He lives with his wife and son in Philadelphia."
