        "text": "I have seen a lot of movies that are either filmed in Montana or based on a person from Montana, or a historic event that took place in Big Sky Country, and this is by far my favorite.\n\nNo, it's not A River Runs Through It, although that would come in 2nd for me, I am talking about, Father Stu.\n\nReleased in 2022, I finally got around to watching the film this past week and all I can say is WOW.\n\nIf you haven't heard of the film, check out the trailer below.\n\nI won't tell you how the story ends, but I will tell you that there are not many films I watch more than one time, and this is one that I will watch again and again. Following a story of dreams lost, to hope gained, Father Stu gives you an outlook on life that sometimes we need a reminder of.\n\nDon't be discouraged by the title of the movie if you are not into \"movies about religion\". This movie goes through so many life emotions that most of us can relate to, you will be thankful you watched it.\n\nNot to mention the main characters are some of our favorites.\n\nAnother great Montana movie to check out based on a real person is MAID.\n\nYou can find both of these films on Netflix, so the next time you are searching for something to watch while laying around on a lazy Saturday, check these out."
