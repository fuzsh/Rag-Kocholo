        "text": "For more than 100 years, filmmakers have used Montana landscapes in their work, perhaps none so grandly as 1998’s “What Dreams May Come.” That movie used Glacier National Park for heaven.\n\n{{#modules.acquisition.inline}}\n\n{{props.notification}}\n\n{{props.tag}}\n\n{{props.expression}}\n\n{{/modules.acquisition.inline}}\n\n...\n\nOur reporting. Your stories.\n\nGet unlimited digital access to exclusive content.\n\nFrom “A River Runs Through It” to “Winter in the Blood,” author Brian D’Ambrosio collected in his new book the stories and photos of 93 movies filmed, at least part, in Montana.\n\nThe 2003 film “Northfork” stood out among the Montana-tied films he researched. It’s the story set in 1955 in a small Montana town about to be submerged by the opening of a dam. Filmed in the Glasgow, Augusta and Great Falls areas, “Northfolk” was inspired by the filmakers’ grandfather’s tales of building the Libby and Hungry Horse dams. The brothers also made “Fast Walking” and “Diggstown” in Montana.\n\n“Personally, my favorite film is ‘Northfork,’ because of its visual and intellectual depth and complexity and because it is such a deep, introspective film,” D’Ambrosio said. “I love the performances and the cast and all of the rich, profound metaphors. It’s a haunting, mesmerizing piece of work, rich with allegories and fables, centered around the flooding of a Montana town. The cinematography is unfailingly breathtaking. It’s a chillingly beautiful piece of cinematic art.”\n\nFilmmaking brought actors Darryl Hannah, Brad Pitt, Ronald Reagan, Tom Hanks, Nick Nolte, Tom Cruise, Nichole Kidman, Clint Eastman and others to the Big Sky State.\n\nOddly, Helena-born actor and Oscar winner Gary Cooper, who starred in 141 or so Westerns, never shot a movie in his home state, though his last film, “The Naked Edge,” debuted in Helena at the Marlow Theater. Neither did Myrna Loy, Montana’s “First Lady of Film,” or Culbertson’s Lane Chandler.\n\nWhitefish author Dorothy Johnson’s “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance” was filmed in California and so was Choteau’s A.B. Guthrie Jr.’s “Shane,” which also included scenes from Jackson Hole and the Grand Tetons.\n\nBut Missoula filmmakers Alex and Andrew Smith have stayed true to their state, filming “The Slaughter Rule” with Ryan Gosling in the Great Falls area and “Winter in the Blood” around Havre.\n\nOne of the strangest adventures in making movies in Montana came with 1997’s “The Patriot” starring Steven Seagal, said D’Ambrosio. The plot centered on an ex-military doctor who combats a virus introduced to the Ennis community by an anti-government bad guy.\n\n“There are several stories about the militias in the state threatening production of Steven Seagal’s ‘The Patriot’ and I hadn’t realized before the book that the FBI needed to be called in, because the militia threatened to infiltrate and contaminate the set,” he said. “The militia even sent in imposters as extras. I was surprised at how serious the issues and incidents were surrounding filming, in terms of FBI protection and the threat matrix.”\n\nIn 1974, interest in filming in Montana increased as more movie studios started filming on location and the Montana Film Office was organized in Helena to woo yet more. Commissioner from then to 1990, Garry Wunderwald said he pitched eastern Montana’s wide-open spaces and soaring mountains – but also more.\n\n“We have locations that lend themselves to scenes other than strictly Western,” he said. “We’re trying to overcome the stereotype images and show people that there is more there than cowboys and snow-covered peaks.”\n\nBut yeah, Westerns.\n\n“People think of Montana when they think of the West. They don’t think Idaho or the Dakotas,” former film commissioner Sten Iversen told D’Ambrosio. “We have something special, and the film business knows it.”\n\nMontana lures movie makers and then movie makers lure more to Montana.\n\nHow many people came to Montana after watching “A River Runs Through It”? No doubt some anglers found their way to Montana trout streams because of the movie, D’Ambrosio wrote. The fly fishing industry grew 60 percent the year after it came out, and another 60 percent the year after, and trout streams Montanans liked to keep to themselves were not longer a secret.\n\nSet in Missoula but filmed in Bozeman (the Blackfoot River was too scarred by pollution and development; Missoula was deemed too modern-looking) the film is a retelling of Norman Maclean’s novella. It’s a series of memories of a Montana family in the 1920s and short on plot, which made it a trick for adapting into a movie. And, half the 104 pages are about fly-fishing.\n\nAnd it might never have been without an argument that began somewhere near Livingston, when actor Robert Redford teased writer Tom McGuane, calling him a “carpetbagger.” They shared their favorite western books, and McGuane put “A River Runs Through It And Other Stories” into Redford’s hands.\n\nA boulder on the Gallatin River became “Brad Pitt Rock” to the anglers who floated by.\n\n“A river, the sound of water flowing over rocks, an old man’s hands tying a fly to his line, and the movie’s evocative narration changed Montana forever,” D’Ambrosio wrote.\n\nMore recently, the acclaimed “The Revenant,” starring Leonardo DiCaprio as trapper Hugh Glass was mostly filmed in Canada and Argentina. But maybe the scene filmed at Kootenai Falls near Libby will draw some people with, uh, a taste for adventure. D’Ambrosio learned camera crews filmed the falls in July and overlaid snow and ice filmed in Argentina to the scene. DiCaprio stayed in Hollywood and acted before a green screen. That was probably for the best. Yvonne Hill, who owns the Sandman Hotel where the film stunt crew stayed, said in the book that DiCaprio’s stunt double was hurt twice, crushing his heel when a helicopter blew off course and then shattering his leg.\n\n“Nobody else has ever gone over Kootenai Falls and lived to tell about it,” she said.\n\nAnother movie that used the Kootenai River and falls was “The River Wild,” starring Kevin Bacon and Meryl Streep. The idea of the movie came from a fishing trip on the Smith River, though, D’Ambrosio found. Screenwriter Dennis O’Neil was sipping whiskey on the river banks thinking about what it would mean to be on a one-way-in, one-way-out river, if, say killers were on the loose. Streep nearly drowned filming in that wild river.\n\nMontana has been a stand in for China and San Francisco (“A Thousand Pieces of Gold”) and Oklahoma (”Far and Away”). It’s been Norway in “Wolf Summer” and upstate New York in “Devil’s Pond.”\n\nCinematographer Mikael Salomon, who filmed part of “Far and Away” and “Always” in Montana, “It’s a beautiful state with so much variety that it’s impossible for exteriors not to look good. Because of the landscape and latitude, the magic hour in the summer is consistently spectacular and long-lasting.”\n\nMany of the photos D’Ambrosio found had never been published before, such as one of actor Jack Nicholson in eastern Montana on the set of “The Missouri Breaks.”\n\n“Telefon” made a lasting impact when it filmed in Great Falls in 1977. The Charles Bronson spy thriller gathered a crowd for the blowing up of an annex at the old Paris Gibson Junior High School. It was due for being torn down anyway.\n\nDirector Don Siegel wanted to use a Los Angeles hotel, but owners rebuffed him. When he found a San Francisco option, Bronson dumped on the city. So they came to Great Falls. Siegel wasn’t sure how it would turn out – and neither did his head of demolition, who had never done such a scene. When no one was injured and it looked cool, Siegel “became choked up with emotion – a first for me.”\n\nReach Tribune Staff Writer Kristen Inbody at kinbody@greatfallstribune.com.
