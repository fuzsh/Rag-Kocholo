        "text": "TopBilled:\n\nA quick reminder that Jlewis is handling the reviews this month. He has chosen some very interesting documentary compilation films.\n\n***\n\nJlewis:\n\nIn French, original version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itll-GyFlmg\n\nIn English, 1948 U.S. version: https://archive.org/details/paris1900_201705/paris1900_201705reel1.mov\n\nThis month, I am attempting a rather peculiar topic rarely discussed in the entertainment literature: the historical montage documentary. That is, if I have the proper title for it. It is a genre that we pretty much take for granted today since anything historical and educational shown on TV or YouTube makes full use of previously released material, much of it in public domain as copyright control lapses over time. Yet there isn’t much discussion of it in print or online.\n\nFirst, an attempt at a history lesson is in order.\n\nI don’t know exactly when movies started borrowing clips from earlier movies with a conscious, historical perspective rather than just recycling footage in order to save money in re-filming a particular stock scene. Yet the weekly one-reel short film series, the silent PATHÉ REVIEW (1919-1930) and all-talkie PATHÉ AUDIO REVIEW (1929-1933) produced in the United States and the PATHÉ PICTORIAL that was its British counterpart but ran a staggering 51 years uninterrupted (1918-69), are good starting points for the discussion.\n\nThe Pathé Frères company that the brothers Charles, Émile, Théophile and Jacques had launched in Paris back in 1896 had plenty of material in their vaults by the time Terry Ramsaye, in particular, decided to make nostalgic trips down memory lane with such segments within the PATHÉ REVIEW reels such as “Dirty Work on the Crossroads” (Series 28: No. 31, a July 29, 1928 installment) snipping highlights from older multi-chapter serials THE SHIELDING SHADOW and THE TIMBER QUEEN, “We Remember” (Series 29: No. 23 from April 27, 1929) covering pre-war news items, the PATHÉ AUDIO REVIEW No. 9 (June 7, 1929) with 1890s footage in “Bygones” and No. 28 (October 22, 1929) covering a history of baseball with valuable footage of Babe Ruth and Tyrus Cobb in their youth.\n\nPathé probably made the more of these types of films over a four decade period than anybody else, but there was plenty of competition in the 1930s as other major Hollywood studios investigated their silent film vaults to see if anything was worth recycling for the Talkie Era, even if just for a short subject topic to be shown with the latest two reel comedy, cartoon or travelogue.\n\nFox Movietone had a rarely seen today (if any prints are still available) TINTYPES series produced by Truman Talley (1933-34). Paramount’s SCREEN SOUVENIRS (1931-1935) and its later special spin-off shorts such as MOVIE MILESTONES are vitally important for film historians due to their inclusion of long lost Paramount Famous Players-Lasky titles, such as the only remaining three minutes of Lon Chaney in THE MIRACLE MAN (1919). In 2010, the Warner Archive produced an excellent (costly, but worth the price) six disc DVD set VITAPHONE CAVALCADE OF COMEDY SHORTS COLLECTION that included some wonderful “Pepper Pots” like THE CAMERA SPEAKS (1934) featuring the legendary Billy Bitzer talking to his camera as we examine vintage footage from the Vitagraph (now Vitaphone) and other studio vaults.\n\nBack to Pathé, two other short subject series were collaborations with RKO Radio and Warner Brothers respectively. The former were the FLICKER FLASHBACKS (1943-48) directed by Richard Fleischer, a future feature director who also happened to be the son of cartoon producer Max Fleischer of Betty Boop and Popeye fame.\n\nThese tended to be comical and slightly mocking of the material presented but also included plenty of old Biograph material directed by D.W. Griffith that kept his name relevant in filmdom during his last years of life. In contrast, Robert Youngson’s multi-Oscar winning 10-20 minute Warner “novelties” and “varieties” of 1948-56 were much more serious and nostalgic in tone. (I will get into more Youngson in a future review.)\n\nAbout the time Fleischer started his final season of FLICKERS and just before Youngson got started on his, French moviegoers attending the Cannes film festival of September 1947 were given a special treat…\n\nPARIS 1900 a.k.a. PARIS MIL NEUF CENT.\n\nThe title is inaccurate since its clever montage of clips spans a whole span of time from 1895 (earliest Lumiere footage) through the war years of 1914 and even a bit later. It shares many similarities both with the Warner Youngson shorts (he was obviously influenced by its success) and another key U.S. produced featurette (about 50 minutes) made exactly ten years later: NBC’s television series PROJECT XX included an episode called THE INNOCENT YEARS (aired November 21, 1957) that also covered the 1890s through 1917, the key U.S. wartime year.\n\nThe producer of PARIS 1900 was the very prolific Pierre Braunberger, who also backed two documentaries covering Vincent Van Gogh, one of them an Oscar winner, that involved the great Alain Resnais, who also serves as assistant supervisor here. Three big names were also credited for their cooperation: veteran director-actor-playwriter Sacha Guitry, the famous antique specialist Jacques Damiot and Henri Langlois of La Cinémathèque Française, legendary in his obsession to preserve just about anything he could get his hands on since he felt that the only way anybody could judge the value of art was to have it available to see for himself or herself.\n\nThe director and writer in charge was a woman who had a far smaller filmography in comparison. Perhaps because the ladies always had fewer opportunities in a male dominated profession? Nicole Védrès is best known for this title and also a semi-controversial drama LA VIE COMMENCE DEMAIN (LIFE BEGINS TOMORROW) that garnished an “X” rating in the UK four years later.\n\nAs we open, the first lines in English are “Those were, so it seemed, the happy times.” Since we are rather light hearted here (even though we do learn later that these years were not always happy), the narration and some songs sung in the French original were done by popular comedy star Claude Dauphin, whom we’ve discussed fleetingly in an earlier review of TALE OF A FOX as a key animated character voice. When Arthur Mayer and Edward Kingsley acquired the U.S. distribution rights the following year, they chose an equally humorous voice to narrate John Mason Brown’s English translation: a great snooty Monty Woolley.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower opens our trip, along with the Paris World Exhibition of 1900, but surprisingly not the Olympic Games of that same year. 1900 was also the year of the first subway, the Métro, but it doesn’t get focused on until a second one is constructed a few years later and with a succeeding president overseeing it. Apparently the president of 1900, Émile Loubet, was too devoid of cinematic action for the screen to get any mention here, so we jump ahead to the more colorful Armand Fallières who dominated the country between the years 1906 and 1913, preening with visitors and becoming a visitor himself to Tunisia and other locales overseas. In Monty’s narration, he’s compared to Santa Claus.\n\nIt was very much a man’s world, but you know our female director/writer has plenty to say about the “weaker sex” and all of their great strides in suffrage and their right to wear trousers. Fashions change with the times as Monty our English guide states: “Liberation is the slogan of the day. Liberation not only from male dictatorship but also from the restraints of that more painful tyrant, the corset.”\n\nPredictably there are more key female figures in fashion and acting, not so much politics or running the country. Most important are Sarah Bernhardt and singer Polaire, the former appearing in one of the earliest “talkies” documented here with good matching of lips with soundtrack voice.\n\nSome of the gender oriented fads get ridiculed and I am sure Védrès wrote much of the material with her tongue in her cheek. For example, we see proper ladies making sure they get vaccinated in public with as many spectators as possible. Slightly creepy is the early century fetish of husbands having their wives photographed by a professional cameraman while sleeping!\n\nMuch focus is put on the many ways people entertained themselves at the time, particularly at amusement parks and at the beach. July 14th was that nation’s version of this nation’s July 4th and the French/American connection of having fun is further enhanced by the circus scenes featured, including Yank visitor Buffalo Bill Cody in all his glory.\n\nTechnology and its many marvels also influences the entertainment customs of the time with a dance craze inspired by the latest novelty, the airplane (and we see footage of Louis Blériot flying across the English Channel here), but the stretched arms resembling wings is counter-productive for many couples’ sense of intimacy on the dance floor.\n\nOf course, no documentary on Paris would be complete without The Arts. The footage of Impressionist painters are a key highlight, with Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir shown at work along with sculptor Auguste Rodin. I was surprised at how much Renoir smoked like a locomotive. There is also quite a bit of coverage concerning the major wars in artist styles, with Leon Bonnat (shown painting the portrait of Fallières) being the great “enemy of the Impressionists.”\n\nGuillaume Apollinaire, the famous poet and art critic, is seen in a rare “animated” sequence with André Rouveyre (which you can also find on his Wikipedia page), while other famous names of the art world such as Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso are only seen in stills or represented by paintings since virtually all of (if not all of) their cinematic footage post-dates the time frame here.\n\nAmong the writers profiled are quite a number who were women (since our film’s creator chose to spotlight them) and, of course, Marcel Proust. Art also finds its expression in stage acts, some involving acrobatics with a breathtaking skill that is still impressive today.\n\nOne key advantage of France being the nation profiled here is the wealth of motion picture footage available, since it was THE top movie making nation in the pre-Hollywood era. Early on, we get slapstick moments coming from some unidentified early comedy-reel with a Keystone-ish group of cops. The material is presented as if it is “real” life rather than “reel” life to emphasize a certain funny innocence of the Parisians.\n\nLater we gets clips from key serials and swashbuckler dramas but, unfortunately, no title information for the cinematically curious. I am also a bit disappointed that, despite the wealth of material presented, very little is mentioned of the creators apart from Ferdinand Zecca and Charles Pathé getting a brief nod. No mention of Georges Méliès even though some of his productions are recognizable here. I am guessing the film footage of early Maurice Chevalier comes from PAR HABITUDE (1911), but who knows for sure?\n\nDespite the overall easy-going tone of it all, we are occasionally reminded that they were not always the best of times. The great flood of 1910 is presented with a rather ominous orchestration, again reminding me of THE INNOCENT YEARS covering San Francisco’s earthquake of 1906 and the Ohio floods of 1913. There is also Franz Reichelt performing an aerial stunt from the Eiffel Tower that accidentally turns suicidal in 1912, as covered by the early newsreel cameras.\n\nThere are also a few glimpses of slum life, showing that not everybody was enjoying the care free life a.k.a. “This is the Paris that tourists do not see.”\n\nSocialism and other then radical political ideas are pushed forth in an effort to bring bread to many a table. One stunning sequence of newsreel clips involve the police chase and killing of anarchist and gang leader Jules Bonnot and the bombing of his hide-out. His last words are written in blood: “So much the worse for society. So much the worse for you.”\n\nThere is sense of doom that starts to creep in during the final act. All of the leaders of France’s neighboring nations insist that there will be no future wars and a who’s who of international heads visit Paris to negotiate with each other, including statesman Aristide Briand, Kaiser Wilhelm II, King Alfonso XIII, Tsar Nicholas II and even U.S. tycoon Andrew Carnegie.\n\nMeanwhile we see a war machine gradually in the making with a few industrialists making a fortune in the process. To those watching this in 1947, it was all eerily familiar. We close with soldiers embarking on trains as Monty in English groans “Even as they say a farewell to one another, they are also saying goodbye to those peaceful, carefree years.”\n\nAgain, it is fun to compare this to its NBC alternate remake of sorts. THE INNOCENT YEARS was far more optimistic, being about the United States and its constant use of rose-colored glasses to get it through the worst of times. Narrator Alexander Scourby closes with a 1917 military parade “every heart beats true with the red, white and blue.” Yup, the Yanks will pull through this war like they do everything else.\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 5, Episode 9 — After Life; Broadcast on November 26, 1986\n\nStory by Tom Fontana, John Masius & John Tinker\n\nDirected by Mark Tinker\n\nJlewis:\n\nThis is one of the more famous episodes.\n\nWe begin with Dr. Wayne Fiscus (Howie Mandel) chasing fireflies…or fairies…or Tinker Bell since he is like Peter Pan in his juvenile personality. It is interesting that he gets accidentally shot right after his little speech about catching fireflies and saying he loves having control over their lives once he catches them. His life seems to be controlled by…somebody. Under surgery, he goes through his out of body experience to see what life after death is like…\n\n(TopBilled needs to make an inventory of how many characters employed by St. Eligius have also been patients struggling to survive in ER themselves. I have lost count, but it must be an interesting number.)\n\nMuch of this story is patterned after other heavenly comedies of the 1970s and ’80s, which combined a little New Age rhetoric to old fashion religion, while still paying homage to old-time Hollywood fantasies of the HERE COMES MR. JORDAN and A GUY NAMED JOE kind.\n\nWhat I find interesting about these period pieces is how they showcase where many average Americans’ state of mind were in regards to such unanswered subject matter. In the ME decade, people became less critical of themselves and what ”sins” they were committing that the religious authorities of old used to burn them at the stake for. However these decades were still full of uncertainty in life so everybody was still questioning ”am I making the right decisions?”\n\nUsually our perceptions of death and life after death are colored by what others in our family and community tell us, which is why Wayne is the perfect character for this kind of TV-recreated ”heaven.” Like Victor, he is always focused on what others have to say.\n\nIn Death Valley or some place like it, he meets patients who died. Then he joins a country estate with Marian Mercer playing a role similar to Audrey Hepburn’s in Spielberg’s subsequent (released later that decade) movie ALWAYS.\n\nThen he meets Peter in Loch Ness, a key reason we are discussing this show since it ties in with our previous Peter-centric stories. Peter has put on some weight since we last saw him alive and is also mighty angry in his row boat, tossing Wayne overboard with the lady mannequins in the water. Wayne returns to Peter for repeated crazy talks, after visiting other areas in his peculiar setting. There is lots of talk talk talk in this episode but not much that I personally found particularly enlightening or different than other fantasies of this type. Patients in Death Valley behave like they are stand-up comics up in the Catskills.\n\nWayne meets God, who looks just like him. After all, those raised Judeo-Christian believe they were created in ”His” image. Interrupting my Dailymotion video and extending it past to the 90 minute mark were previews of ABC’s When Nature Calls with Helen Mirren. Is God also taking the image of every furry and feathered critter featured on that show too? Humans think they are so special, but they are merely another species sharing the same planet in the solar system.\n\nA moderately interesting experiment that tries to be different than the others. By the way, Wayne survives his surgery.\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nThis was the last episode in which Peter White appeared. St. Elsewhere featured memorable final episodes for all of its most popular characters.\n\nThese residents died during the show’s run:\n\nWendy Armstrong (committed suicide at the end of season 2)\n\nPeter White (murdered at the beginning of season 3; appeared in hell with Wayne Fiscus in season 5)\n\nBobby Caldwell (diagnosed with AIDS in the middle of season 4, he went to California to work and live at an AIDS hospice, and was reported to have died from AIDS off screen in the middle of season 6)\n\nElliott Axelrod (heart attack at the end of season 6)\n\nThese residents left:\n\nAnnie Cavanero (not seen again after season 3, no explanation of where she went)\n\nPhillip Chandler (went to Missouri in the middle of season 6 for management training, and came back for a few episodes near the end; he then gave up his career as a doctor and joined his girlfriend in Mississippi in the penultimate episode)\n\nJack Morrison (went to live with family in Seattle in late season 4 after the rape at the prison, came back at the beginning of season 5 to finish his residency, then returns to Seattle at the end)\n\nWayne Fiscus (leaves for Nicaragua in the last episode, because he feels there are a lot of emergency cases he can help with in a third-world country).\n\nThese residents stayed at St. Eligius:\n\nDr. Jacqueline Wade (continued as surgeon, promoted to management)\n\nDr. Victor Ehrlich (also continued as a surgeon)\n\n***\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 5, Episode 20 — Women Unchained; Broadcast on March 4, 1987\n\nStory by Tom Fontana, John Masius & Eric Overmyer; Teleplay by Russ Woody\n\nDirected by Michael Fresco\n\nJlewis:\n\nOur final episode dates to March 4, 1987: Ellen Bry’s Shirley Daniels returns in this one, relating it to our previous discussions. Bruce Greenwood is among the newer stars on this later season of the show, probably replacing Mark Harmon. Denzel Washingon is still on the show and still not doing much, but this may just be a coincidence: the couple of episodes that we have profiled simply don’t showcase him much.\n\nDr. Elliot Axelrod (Stephen Furst) is all excited that ”celebrity” Shirley Daniels is back as a patient at the hospital.\n\nCalm down, Elliot. There is an awkward get-together in the cafeteria with Shirley and her former co-workers, with somebody mocking her time in jail with a file included in a Boston cream pie. Victor and others suspect that she may have killed another patient, an elderly woman in terminal condition whom she felt sorry for.\n\nAlthough her story does not amount to much, I do feel that Ellen Bry is a very talented actress who makes the most of her character. Her declaration to Jack about her death-till-we-depart love for him is wonderfully unhinged.\n\nMark’s wife Ellen meets an old flame (Gerald Hiken) in this one, but not much story is developed there except that he is now down and out and Mark is predictably judgmental of his ”bum” life.\n\nThe episode ends with a patient receiving a lethal injection from a strange hand, but this is a story arc that I will allow TopBilled to cover since I have not followed this season carefully.\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nThe story about the patient receiving a lethal injection is part of a season 5 arc, where a series of mercy killings take place at the hospital. The first one of these deaths occurs when Shirley is there as a patient, and everyone naturally assumes she did it, since she was guilty of killing Peter.\n\nBut after some sexy talk with her old pal Wayne Fiscus, Shirley returns to prison (never to be seen again on the show)…and another mercy killing occurs a short time later. This means Shirley cannot be the culprit since she’s no longer there and back behind bars. Someone else on staff is putting sick elderly patients out of their misery. I won’t spoil who it is, but it is revealed near the end of season 5.\n\nBefore we close, I would like to thank Jlewis for being a good sport and looking at episodes of this highly esteemed series with me. I hope people reading our reviews this month will watch the episodes.\n\nHere’s a link for a good website that has some trivia and other items about the show:\n\nhttp://www.stelsewhereweb.com/\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 3, Episode 21 — Murder She Rote; Broadcast on February 27, 1985\n\nStory by Tom Fontana and John Masius and Steve Bello\n\nDirected by Mark Tinker\n\nJlewis:\n\nPatient Andrea (Ann Hearn) struggles to leave after face treatment (she was suffering physical effects from a bone disease) due to fears returning to the outside world. Dr. Robert Caldwell (Mark Harmon) loses patience with his patient, but she warms up gradually through his guidance. It is suggested that she is infatuated with him and, heck, since he is on the market as indicated in an earlier conversation and has no other love interests, why not?\n\nThis show features the death of Mrs. Hufnagel (Florence Halop), who never leaves the surroundings she now considered ”home.” The actress makes great use of her final scenes. Her departure from this world is justifiably unusual, as she uses the bed controls and gets trapped when it closes up on her, prompting a post-surgery heart attack. The coldness that multiple characters, surprisingly not Mark Craig, who blames himself for her death, display after her passing did bother me a bit. I understand that she got on everybody’s nerves, but she was not THAT despicable.\n\nDr. Eliot Axelrod (Stephen Furst) gets a new girlfriend but acts like a Nervous Nelly when she tries to get him into bed. There is a dramatic (and overblown in a TV sort of way) fire sequence at a Hawaiian restaurant which prompts the owner to sue Eliot for using the expensive aquarium and its exotic residents to put it out. As amusing as this side-story involving this Woody Allen-ish character is, it literally goes nowhere and isn’t resolved as it should be. Sometimes the writers come up with novel ideas to keep viewers watching and then just simply forget about them as they continue with this next dramatic or comic focus.\n\nShirley tells Jack that she wished she had killed him back ‘Up on the Roof,’ as he tries to prove her innocence on an insanity clause. Her lawyer tries to get her to defend herself better by emphasizing the Peter-assaulted-me angle but she refuses and fires her assistance.\n\nEverybody wants to keep her out of jail except her and she is even back to her old job, as she humorously quotes Bette Davis in ALL ABOUT EVE with the classic ”fasten your seat belts, it is going to be a bumpy night” line. Eventually she leaves on her own with a fake pop gun that is essentially her middle finger ”see ya’all later” statement for everybody. Oh-kay… well, we can’t say this character wasn’t memorable.\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nJlewis mentioned Mark Harmon’s character. I should add that a year later Harmon would be selected by People magazine as the most sexiest male on the planet. (This would become an in-joke in a later episode of St. Elsewhere.)\n\nRe: Nurse Shirley Daniels (Ellen Bry), she returns for one more guest appearance the following season. We will learn that Shirley did indeed go to prison (more her own choosing, since she could have easily beaten the charges against her). When she comes back to St. Eligius, it is as a patient, which I think is an interesting way to wrap up the character’s long-term arc.\n\nAs for Mrs. Hufnagel, this isn’t her last episode either. She appears once more. We find out that she bequeathed her estate to Dr. Elliott Axelrod (Stephen Furst), the only resident on staff that she developed any sort of real bond with, during her various stays at the hospital. She has a very funny bit in a videotaped will, in which she informs Elliott, after her death, that he’s her sole heir. Of course, there is a silly complication, because Mrs. H has a good-for-nothing nephew who thinks the old woman was off her rocker, and that he should have inherited everything.\n\nThe powers that be at NBC were so impressed with Florence Halop’s work on St. Elsewhere, that she was suggested for a role on the network’s popular sitcom Night Court. She replaced Selma Diamond who died of lung cancer. Though ironically, Halop would also die of lung cancer a short time later herself, and she was replaced by Marsha Warfield.\n\n***\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 4, Episode 21 — Cheek to Cheek; Broadcast on March 12, 1986\n\nStory by John Masius & Tom Fontana; Teleplay by Eric Overmyer\n\nDirected by Helaine Head\n\nJlewis:\n\nA popular comic strip artist, Eric Christmas as Jersey Piker, makes a more interesting than usual patient. He makes note of the budding affections between still single Dr. Donald Westphall and the younger (by 18 years), attractive Dr. Carol Novino (Cindy Pickett).\n\nLater Carol makes a trivia reference to a then 21 year old oldie after he says ”you were on my mind” that shows how wonderfully geeky the two are together:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbuzEjEHso0\n\nWe also have a rare scene of Mark calmly singing ”Old MacDonald” to his infant granddaughter Barbara, but he initially passes off his wife’s health concerns over her ”female” issues. Victor Ehrlich (Ed Begley Jr.) is nervous about examining her in the hospital since his relationship with ”Daddy” is so often in jeopardy. Love Bonnie Bartlett as the actress telling it like it is: ”Victor, am I going to have perform this exam myself?!”\n\nA couple familiar character actor faces, whom you likely won’t remember the names of, appear at a prison that Jack visits. Nicholas Pryor is a resident doctor and Paula Kelly is a talkative nurse assistant Sylvia. She is the latest in a long line of Golden Girls connections; playing the hilarious one-time housekeeper Marguerite in an episode one year after this.\n\nAnother future Golden Girl-er, but not until 1992, is the more sinister Jack Bannon returning as a murderer featured in previous episodes from Elsewhere (as shown in flashbacks).\n\nJack gets sexually assaulted by a fellow felon; John Dennis Johnston being yet another familiar face to me. This is a typical I’m-not-sure-if-it-was-necessary-and-even-less-sure-if-it-was-all-that-realistic climax that often occurs on primetime TV. Jack returns to his home hospital all bloody in a rather harrowing scene, but it makes me question such things that I normally don’t, such as…don’t they have enough security cameras at the prison? Why isn’t the nurse doing anything, like calling for additional help, when she is nearby?\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nThe subplot with Victor (Ed Begley) performing the exam on Mrs. Craig (Bonnie Bartlett) becomes a long-running “joke” on the show. Victor continues to bring this up in future episodes, often in the operating room, reminding Dr. Craig (William Daniels) that he has seen Mrs. Craig in a vulnerable position and knows how difficult that must be for Dr. Craig. Is Victor saying this sincerely, or is he sticking the knife in, to get back at Dr. Craig, who has often been harsh during the times when Craig is mentoring Ehrlich? It’s amusing.\n\nSpeaking of vulnerability, this episode is a turning point in the life of Dr. Jack Morrison (David Morse) for obvious reasons. He hasn’t been this vulnerable since his wife Nina died at the beginning of the second season.\n\nThe scenes at the men’s prison are part of an outreach that Jack is doing during his residency at St. Eligius. As Jlewis points out, there is some dramatic license taken in terms of security (guards and cameras), but a riot has occurred, and surely there would be a great deal of pandemonium. And probably a coverup too, by prison officials, afraid of losing their jobs.\n\nI found the scene where Jack returns to St. Eligius, all battered and now a rape victim, to be very powerful. This is Jack’s last episode during season 4. He is temporarily written out as having gone back to his parents’ place in Seattle. But when he returns at the beginning of season 5 to start his last year of residency, he has a new wife in tow (Patricia Wettig) and two stepkids who know nothing of his harrowing experience at the prison. The inmate who assaulted him gets out on parole at the end of season 5 and comes to where Jack, his wife and kids live.\n\nAlong with Peter White’s story, the rape of Jack Morrison was one of the more groundbreaking storylines on St. Elsewhere. This was a program that wasn’t afraid to tackle difficult subjects on network television.\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 3, Episode 19 — Red White Black and Blue; Broadcast on February 13, 1985\n\nStory by John Masius and Tom Fontana; Teleplay by Channing Gibson\n\nDirected by Bruce Paltrow\n\nJlewis:\n\nBetty White did this episode a couple months before starting her big gig with three other leading TV ladies, but her role is mostly serious here. She is Captain Gloria working for the White House staff and an old chum of Donald. First Lady Nancy Reagan is visiting the area and this requires more security issues than St. Eligius can deal with.\n\nAt the same time Dr. Mark Craig learns that his wife supported the Black Panthers 16 years earlier as everybody on staff have been, ahem, researched by the government.\n\nMeanwhile Helen and Richard (Herb Edelman’s character) decide to move in together but he must pass the test with her (partly) grown up kids. He bonds well with little Jeff and this gets him accepted.\n\nAnother subplot…Nurse Shirley returns, first appearing at a bar to greet and kiss Wayne on the lips. I guess they are more than just ”friends,” unlike Shirley and Jack. Apparently she is getting out of jail on some technicalities (namely that her case can be read as self defense from assault since nobody saw what Peter was doing with her in that room).\n\nEven apart from his scenes with Gloria, Dr. Donald Westphall gets plenty of coverage in this episode, dealing with Mrs. Hufnagel (who loves giving advice to everybody including him, pretending that she knows everything about everybody). There’s also a mother prevented from seeing her son because of a false abuse accusation.\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nBetty White is in prime form as a guest star in this episode. Her role is interesting…it is not quite Sue Ann Nivens or Rose Nylund that she is playing. I think she was also appearing on Mama’s Family at this time, as another type of character.\n\nBetty was close friends with Ed Flanders, and Ed often persuaded executive producer Bruce Paltrow to hire his friends to do guest roles. Another one of Flanders’ buddies was Jack Dodson (of The Andy Griffith Show) and he has a recurring role across several seasons.\n\nBetty’s character reappears the following season, and that episode must have been filmed during a week she had off from The Golden Girls which would have already been in production. In her second episode, a patient at St. Eligius (named Mary Richards!) will ask Betty if she is Sue Ann Nivens…an inside joke, since The Mary Tyler Moore Show was produced by MTM Productions, which also produced St. Elsewhere.\n\n***\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 3, Episode 20 — Amazing Face; Broadcast on February 20, 1985\n\nStory by John Masius and Tom Fontana; Teleplay by Charles H. Eglee\n\nDirected by Janet Greek\n\nJlewis:\n\nNurse Shirley Daniels (Ellen Bry) suffers a urinary infection and is being treated. She is still eager to go back to jail and even brags about killing Peter. She also admits to providing Myra the, um, present (of the baby ski mask) in the episode Any Portrait in a Storm.\n\nA memorable moment occurs at the very end when she wanders into the room where her crime was committed and studies the autopsy report handled by Jack.\n\nThe title for this episode spotlights Dr. Robert Caldwell (Mark Harmon) the plastic surgeon, although he seems less important to the writers here than other characters featured. I did enjoy his touching scene with a lady getting her amazing face and understanding her hesitations going back into the world. I also enjoyed the earlier story involving the fire fighter whose life he saved.\n\nOther stories:\n\nDonald Westphall is moving out of his house, along with his son Tommy.\n\nMeanwhile Wayne says he is in love with Cathy, but Victor (Yee Hypercritical One who won’t stop talking even if you stuck a plunger in his face) reminds him about the various abuses she suffered and that she may not be ready for intimacy yet. However, after saving Wayne’s life from a teenage punk getting his leg treated, Cathy herself admits that she was back to sex with strangers and Wayne no longer thinks he has the chance to be her special one anymore.\n\nIn related side-story material, Helen Rosenthal (Christina Pickles) and Richard (Herb Edelman) think they are expecting a baby and agree to get married, but Helen discovers later that it is just menopause…and this prompts him to confess that his little swimmers are limited in number. Awwwww. They sure know how to make the other feel better.\n\nMrs. Hufnagel invades the surgery room before she is scheduled to get surgery herself, which I guess was a very funny story idea at the time but would more likely freak most modern viewers out today. When she gets surgery herself, Victor and Mark bicker their usual way during it.\n\nAgain, I liked the final scene with Shirley revisiting the autopsy file the best.\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nShirley’s story isn’t over yet. And neither is Peter White’s, since Peter will appear in a future episode.\n\nI agree that some characters like Bobby Caldwell (Mark Harmon) and Phillip Chandler (Denzel Washington) do not always receive prominent storylines during this particular season of St. Elsewhere. But the following season, Bobby is diagnosed with AIDS, which is a huge plot. And Phillip is given a girlfriend, played by Alfre Woodard, who would be nominated for two Emmys for her work on the show.\n\nThey can’t all be featured prominently at the same time.\n\nI should also mention that sometimes Eric Laneuville only has one or two brief scenes as Luther Hawkins, the orderly. Though that is usually because he is working behind the camera as an episode director. Laneuville went on to have a very prolific career directing in television, and his acting took a backseat to his directing.\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 3, Episode 9 — Up on the Roof; Broadcast on November 21, 1984\n\nStory by John Tinker and Charles H. Eglee; Teleplay by Steve Bello and Channing Gibson\n\nDirected by Eric Laneuville\n\nJlewis:\n\nUp on the roof…is Shirley who confesses murdering Peter with her gun. The detective had been hot on her trail as he started putting puzzle pieces together. We are given some backstory information of her feeling frustrated about his best friend Jack never wanting to date her and also defending Peter more than necessary. Earlier she also informed Cathy of what she did, the latter gradually recovering her emotional trauma and set to get back to work soon.\n\nI have often wondered if Jack had a crush on strictly heterosexual Peter.\n\nMy curious ideas about these characters, which are likely not true, brings me to the arrival of Caroline McWilliams as a bone marrow expert named Christine Holtz who is assisting on a major surgery. So…as I was informed, she was initially planned to be a girlfriend for Dr. Annie Cavanero, but actress Cynthia Sikes objected?\n\nAside from what may have happened behind the scenes, I am not sure how far things would have progressed on network TV in 1984, aside from just the discussion of her being a lesbian. Doubtful same gender affection would have been displayed at the time anyway, although it occasionally happened on TV but rarely.\n\nMinor lines of importance on Elsewhere…\n\nMrs. Hufnagel is asked how she got downstairs from her room. She points to her wheelchair: ”What does this look like? A washing machine?”\n\nLater, she socializes with another fellow patient named Murray Robbin played by…who else?…Murray Rubin. ”I changed my name.” Hufnagel: ”You must have been in trouble with the law.”\n\nDr. Mark Craig, after all of the fuss he made last time on the subject, says matter-of-factly ”You wouldn’t believe the dream I had last night.” No, Mark, we don’t want to hear about it after you complained about everybody else having them.\n\nThis week’s batch of episodes have multiple Golden Girls connections, an intriguing fact since that series would begin within a year these shows were broadcast.\n\nAside from Herb Edelman a.k.a. Stan Zbornak playing love interest to nurse Helen Rosenthal (Christina Pickles), we also get a guest appearance by veteran character actor Harold Gould (as a bone marrow recipient) who later played Rose’s boyfriend Niles…and, in an upcoming show, we get his dating interest, Rose’s Betty White herself.\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nThis was Shirley Daniels’ last regular episode. She returns as a special guest later. I consider this a good “send off” for her after the death of Peter White. Someone had to be given the task of offing Peter, and she did seem the most dramatic choice.\n\nWhen Ellen Bry returns, the character of Shirley Daniels is much more hardened, so there is some progression with her, though she will be off screen for awhile.\n\nI should add that Ellen Bry was married to producer-writer John Masius. And in real life, they had not one but two children with autism, born after she left St. Elsewhere. This is rather ironic, since Tommy the son of Dr. Donald Westphall (Ed Flanders) is autistic and figures prominently in the series finale at the end of season six. There are quite a few instances of life imitating art on this show.\n\nRe: Caroline McWilliams as the lesbian doctor…She was supposed to be a love interest for Annie Cavanero (Cynthia Sikes). But Sikes complained to the bosses at NBC, because she didn’t want to do any same-sex kissing scenes. The St. Elsewhere writers were forced to rewrite the plot, and executive producer Bruce Paltrow fired Sikes at the end of the season for going over his head.\n\n***\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 3, Episode 18 — Any Portrait in a Storm; Broadcast on January 30, 1985\n\nStory by John Masius and Tom Fontana; Teleplay by Lyle Kessler\n\nDirected by Leo Penn\n\nJlewis:\n\nJumping ahead to this season’s episode 18, aired January 30, 1985.\n\nA lot going on in this show. Perhaps too much going on. As the title suggests, there is a storm raging outside of the hospital and a new portrait of Dr. Daniel Auschlander is in the works for his retirement, which he isn’t fond of.\n\nA black gerbil is loose and we discover that Mrs. Hufnagel is quite fond of rodents, but she is less so about how she is charged for so many little things at Hotel St. Eligius such as rubber gloves worn by nurses instead of her. Note that I have not been commenting on Denzel Washington’s character lately since the writers haven’t been giving him much to do lately, but he is convincing enough delivering a baby. Also there is a bit of drama in a flooded room and somebody getting electrocuted.\n\nThis one has a Peter connection as Myra (Karen Landry), his widow, gives birth to his last child, also named Peter. Also having a baby is teen Maddy (Lycia Naff) and this baby’s daddy must leave for Florida to escape his street gang connections. Sadly, hers does not survive, partly due to her drug past. Spoiler: Myra gets an insulting gift of a little ski mask for her baby (since Peter allegedly wore them in his crimes), while the deceased baby gets a teddy bear that I thought brought this episode to a touching finish.\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nAs Jlewis mentined, we skipped ahead a few episodes, so we can cover the rest of Peter White’s long-term story arc. In this episode, Peter’s widow Myra gives birth to their third child. She names her newborn son Peter, which seems logical. But Jack Morrison’s son is also named Pete, after his late friend Peter White. So there are two Peters that will carry their fathers’ legacies forward.\n\nMyra White receives a very sinister gift for the new baby. And one can’t help but wonder if that is foreshadowing, to suggest this new offspring is a demon child that will grow up to be like his father.\n\nWe find out in a future episode who sent the gift.\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 3, Episode 7 — Fade to White; Broadcast on November 7, 1984\n\nStory by John Masius and Tom Fontana; Teleplay by Cynthia Darnell\n\nDirected by David Anspaugh\n\nJlewis:\n\n…or Peter’s final moments. White is important here, as we will discover in the next episode. He survives the shooting, but only temporarily. After he does go, his wife meets the killer without realizing it in the hospital chapel memorial service for him, but nothing is developed here beyond Shirley’s fleeting “I’m sorry” statement that reveals nothing. Earlier the wife told Dr. Donald Westphall (Ed Flanders) that Peter used to be a ”good person.”\n\nPersonally I don’t feel that the Peter White the character matches up all that well with Terence Knox the actor playing him. Terence is way too mild mannered in his personality and lacks much of the malice factor required. Not that such a trait in the performance is necessary, but it does help. It just feels to me that the team of writers had to draw straws to decide which cast member should play a villain and Terence simply raised his hand and stated ”oh shucks, I’ve got broad shoulders and can handle it.”\n\nYet I do feel that his departure through the hands of a woman he did not molest but provokes in words (taking her and other women for granted) is a rather clever way for him to go. I liked his exit better than Wendy’s departure by suicide, since her character was too strong willed and successful at coping with life overall; her eating disorder and Peter’s assault on her did not cut it for me when she easily aced her exams and kept her job despite so much else pushed on her. In a way, Peter’s death is also one that the old Hays Code and Catholic Legion of Decency running classic Hollywood decades earlier would have approved of, since ”crime does not pay.”\n\nSurprisingly, Peter only appears in roughly three minutes of footage this show. Everybody goes about their business as if it isn’t a big deal. Of course, we do have a detective on the case– Charles Lanyer playing Det. Alex McGallen. It is interesting to note that hospitals in the 1980s still were not equipped with security cameras. Shirley would certainly not be able to get away with it today.\n\nOne throwaway plot, at least for me, involves a boy named Jimmy suffering from asthma or, rather, some emotional reaction that resembles asthma that is built on stress about the everyday world. Couldn’t the writers create something more substantial than that as a cause?\n\nWe also get the return of Michael Richards’ Bill Wolf. In the very first episode we profiled, Dr. Mark Craig (William Daniels) reluctantly agreed to allow a television crew film his work for a documentary. They are back, thanks to recently appointed Joan Halloran (Nancy Stafford), Robert’s ex, agreeing to it and Victor, of all people, agreeing to be the host of a talk show. Of course, this impacts the relationship between Junior and Daddy a.k.a. ”You lie with dogs, you get fleas!” First topic that Victor discusses in a panel discussion is circumcision, which he considers ”a dilemma”. Oh-kay…\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nI think the writers made a mistake killing Peter. It would have been more interesting if he had been shot in the groin, lost his manhood, then had to deal with the disgrace of that. Also, I think he definitely would have gone to live and work somewhere else. There is no way he would want to stay at St. Eligius after all this. But the door could have been left open for him to rehabilitate and come back later in some reformed capacity. Part of me wanted Peter to have some sort of redemption long-term.\n\nHis death in this episode is quick. He is in his hospital bed and looks over at Shirley, and that is it. I wonder if the writers toyed with the idea of Shirley euthanizing him in the hospital room. In season 5 there is a mercy killing storyline, where someone on staff is murdering terminal patients and Shirley is involved in that.\n\nI liked the scene that occurred near the end of the episode inside the hospital chapel. Peter’s widow is consoled by Shirley, which is very ironic. Jack Morrison (David Morse) is there and so is Dr. Donald Westphall (Ed Flanders). Karen Landry, the actress who plays Peter’s wife Myra perfectly complemented Terrence Knox as Peter. They both have this charming but vulnerable quality.\n\nI agree with Jlewis’ comment that Knox is not very menacing as the villain in this storyline. Back in season one, when Peter was revealed to have a drug problem, we were supposed to be shocked that this all-American, likable doctor had such a dark secret. His secrets became darker, his demons became scarier. But Peter himself never became scary, and I think that was deliberate. We were still supposed to like Peter, because Terrence Knox is a likable actor.\n\nHere’s a more recent photo of him:\n\n***\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 3, Episode 8 — Sweet Dreams; Broadcast on November 14, 1984\n\nStory by John Masius and Tom Fontana\n\nDirected by Mark Tinker\n\nJlewis:\n\nDr. Jack Morrison (David Morse) is having a nightmare at the hospital, with 70s heavy metal music on the soundtrack and he expresses great shock when opening a door for authorized personnel only.\n\nThis is revealed (in a second dream sequence towards the end of the episode) as Peter in the After Life, dressed in white masculine clothes to match his killer’s equally white dress. That I found interesting. The speech Peter makes to Jack is pretty predictable and hardly dream-like, but it adds closure to his character. This is standard ghost story material of the Dickens sort with the living being advised not to mourn any further than necessary. Peter feels no grudges against those responsible for shooting him since he now realizes he was ultimately responsible for his own fate.\n\nVictor also has a dream. He is held hostage on a deserted island full of Amazonians. His character probably benefits with women being in charge over him since he is one of the most indecisive characters on network TV, needing somebody to push him to be the Man he needs to be.\n\nLuther has a Park Avenue dream sequence with ZZ Top, I guess, adding musical support. His ladies are far more supportive of him than Victor’s as they all seek revenge on the higher ups who don’t treat Luther fairly.\n\nAll of these fantasies, sporting bigger than usual production values and not at all like the dreams I have (i.e. you ever notice how the dreams in so many movies and TV shows are so structurally plotted while the actual dreams most of us have are jumbled messes with little coherence in theme?) are part of their sleep therapy with their heads wired up as they snooze, under the guidance of Dr. Linda Ellis (Patricia Hardy).\n\nAs usual, head Dr. Mark is furious about all of this going on and so many on his staff yawning on the job.\n\nThis show is interesting from an artistic, creative editing standpoint, but it all becomes rather silly after the initial novelty. M*A*S*H and other key shows before had similar episodes involving multiple characters going through something like this all at once and the novelty was a bit old-hat by the 1980s.\n\nAlso it feels way too coincidental that the whole sleep deprivation issue carries over in two patients whom Wayne and Annie are treating that are suffering similar sleep deprivation issues. Wayne debates with Mark that the cause of death with his Philippine patient was nightmare related.\n\nI did like the scene with Robert calling Victor out with his joke-making during surgery and, yes, patients can hear the sometimes mocking ridicule during their life-or-death situations. Simply put, Victor lacks a lot of sensitivity towards others (and his dream features aggressive women who are hardly sensitive to him) and may or may not have influenced William Hurt’s performance in the later movie THE DOCTOR (1991) about a physician learning more bedside manner.\n\nRecently a script for this episode signed by cast members sold for just twenty bucks on eBay. There are some good collectibles you can get on eBay if you do the proper searching.\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nThis is certainly an experimental episode. I should first point out that St. Elsewhere was filmed at the old CBS Studio Center on Radford in Studio City, even though it aired on NBC. This is because the show as produced by Mary Tyler Moore Productions which took over the facilities there.\n\nOther well-known series were filmed there (and are still filmed there) including Gunsmoke, Gilligan’s Island and Roseanne. Gilligan’s lagoon was an outdoor set there and it featured in an experimental episode of Roseanne and of course, it is what they used to film Victor’s dream sequence with the native women on the beach.\n\nThough I am not a huge fan of ZZ Top, I did find Luther’s video dream of ‘Legs’ a comic highlight. And of course, the dramatic highlight is Jack’s visit with Peter in an all-white morgue. Are the writers telling us that dreams merge with death?\n\nI like the fact that during their visit, Jack asks Peter if he was really guilty and Peter does not confirm it. If Peter is a figment of Jack’s mind in this dream-state then clearly Peter cannot tell him something he wouldn’t know. But just what does Jack know about Peter, after all is said and done?\n\nPeter White appears in one more episode later, another experimental episode. It’s very interesting the way the writers finally “end” his character, though the rape motif carries forward because Shirley shoots at someone else at the hospital that she accuses of rape. And then Jack Morrison (David Morse) becomes a victim of rape in prison.\n\nI agree with Jlewis’ comment that the plot with Dr. Craig and the nightmare death was too coincidental. But this was a thematic episode, about sleep and dreams…and that plot was meant to mirror the nightmare of the rapes and the death of Peter White.\n\nI should mention that ‘Sweet Dreams’ was nominated for an Emmy for writing, for Tom Fontana & John Masius. Plus an Emmy nomination for sound mixing. It also received a nod for director Mark Tinker at the Directors Guild Awards that year.\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 3, Episode 5 — Breathless; Broadcast on October 24, 1984\n\nStory by John Masius and Tom Fontana and John Tinker; Teleplay by Joel Sumow\n\nDirected by Eric Laneuville\n\nJlewis:\n\nA moderately interesting episode, the opening scene involves a maintenance man fussing over the newer digital clocks and how he favors the old fashion kind. Intriguingly so many episodes feature a clock image in the corner of the screen to show the passage of time. Al Ruscio plays this interesting character, Raleigh, who later needs surgery on account of years of asbestos exposure.\n\nAgain, “Daddy” Mark Craig gives abstinence advice to “Junior” Victor during bloody surgery. These scenes used to be mildly humorous to me in the beginning, but they are developing into a boring, repetitive one-joke idea.\n\nOne semi-adorable aspect to Victor’s personality is his willingness to receive advice from literally anybody and everybody, whether it is Mark or his visiting aunt or overly talkative patients like Mrs. Hufnagel (Florence Halop). Although he complains about everybody knowing about his private life, he has absolutely no trouble discussing it with any ears willing to listen.\n\nA minor story of importance involves Herb Edelman’s Richard wooing head nurse Helen, whom he helped in the strike. Both are engaging characters even if the writers don’t do much with their developing relationship here.\n\nThe big highlight is another assaulter of the resident women getting caught in the act and wearing the all important mask. He is revealed when getting psychotherapy with Dr. Charlotte. Peter thinks he is off the hook and is more eager than ever to reunite with his ex and children.\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nThe maintenance guy in this episode is a recurring character, and he dies at the hospital later, not from asbestosis. This plot seems very mid-80s, because I remember as a kid, there were reports of the dangers of asbestos on the news. And one of the schools my sister attended still had asbestos in it, which by law, the district was required to rip out. This was a big concern at the time, but of course people had been exposed to asbestos for decades.\n\nThe relationship between Dr. Craig and Dr. Ehrlich will gradually deepen, after the Craigs’ estranged son dies in an accident. I think Ed Begley Jr. is wonderful in his role. Recently I watched a season 6 episode where Ehrlich gets married again (to Nurse Lucy Papandrao, who is known as the witch of St. Eligius).\n\nIt’s fascinating to see Victor paired off with a strong woman who is going to mold him into a strong doctor, along with help from Dr. Craig. The character of Victor Ehrlich evolves considerably by the time the series concludes.\n\nI have to comment on Mrs. Hufnagel. A book could be written about her. First, Florence Halop was a great character actress. This recurring role during season 3 led to her becoming a full-time cast member on Night Court the following season, replacing Selma Diamond. Florence Halop was the sister of Dead End Kid Billy Halop, and she started in radio and had plenty of roles on television over the years.\n\nMrs. Hufnagel appears in many episodes in season 3. Interestingly, Halop has rather low billing, always billed in the end credits. She isn’t ever considered a main guest star. But the writers seem to have been inspired by her. A running gag is that she keeps getting readmitted to St. Eligius with a new ailment, and the next resident tries to pass her off to someone else. Eventually Westphall (Ed Flanders) and Craig (William Daniels) are brought in to consult when her medical problems worsen, but Mrs. H has an uncanny way of alienating everyone with her obnoxious behavior and outspoken comments.\n\nI think my favorite scene with Mrs. Hufnagel occurs later on and involves her and Dr. Chandler (Denzel Washington). Chandler senses her dismissive attitude and tries to tell Mrs. Hufnagel just how skilled he is, citing his academic achievements at an ivy league college. She is not phased and says “go tell it on the mountain.” She proceeds to give him a hard time. The only person Mrs. Hufnagel shows her vulnerable side to is Dr. Elliot Axelrod (Stephen Furst). But she is still hard on him too, though she does bequeath her estate to Axelrod when she dies.\n\nThe plot with Nurse Rosenthal and the labor negotiator (Herb Edelman) picks up speed. She ends up divorcing her current husband (husband #4) and he moves in with her and her kids. A running gag is that Rosenthal can’t stay married for more than a few years. She repeatedly trades in her husbands for “new models” and Richard is the latest. She is still with him when the show ends, so maybe this is the relationship that will last. We occasionally see Rosenthal deal with domestic issues, and she has kids from all four husbands, plus she has a pregnancy scare with Richard. Herb Edelman is an excellent character actor, and he has nice chemistry with Christina Pickles.\n\n***\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 3, Episode 6 — My Aim Is True; Broadcast on October 31, 1984\n\nStory by John Masius and Tom Fontana; Teleplay by Charles H. Eglee & Channing Gibson\n\nDirected by Mark Tinker\n\nJlewis:\n\nThis title reminds me of the song “Alison” by Elvis Costello.\n\nI attempted to watch this episode on Dailymotion because it was not available on the other viewing site I was using and… EGAD!… there were too many long ads that I was unable to skip through. It took me roughly 90 minutes to get through what was supposed to be just 45 minutes.\n\nThere are multiple stories in this one, including Robert giving an elderly fire-fighter a new face and humorous Mrs. Hufnagel, one patient whom Victor is eager to get rid of, spoiling the scenery for visitors by gossiping all kinds of trash.\n\nDr. Mark Craig (William Daniels) sides with Stephen Furst’s Elliot against Dr. Jacqueline (Sagan Lewis) telling one patient she needs bypass surgery when it is not necessary; the primary characteristic about Elliot that interests me is his voice: he sounds a lot like Woody Allen even though the two look nothing alike.\n\nPeter finally reunites briefly with his kids in what are inevitably his last moments with them as the affectionate father he always wanted to be.\n\nThen Nurse Shirley (Ellen Bry), all dressed in Clorox white and high heels and a purse that are equally white, gets seductive with him before pulling out a gun as revenge. At first, I was wondering if she would merely shoot him below the belt and Dr. Annie would be called in to rescue his manhood like she did for the college dude with cancer and Bobby Caldwell with his zipper mishap. No…this shot will prove to be fatal in the end. Before he falls, Peter confesses that he did not assault Cathy but is guilty of addressing that thought, enough to send Shirley to react as she does.\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nThe stuff with Peter White and his family is poignant, very bittersweet. He has it all, but he is continually at the mercy of his demons. As we see at the end of this tense episode, Peter is brought to his knees, literally.\n\nWe watch Nurse Shirley Daniels (Ellen Bry) make sexual advances towards Peter White then she pulls out a gun, fires two shots, goes to the phone, and says “code blue in the morgue.” This felt like a Dallas or Dynasty-type season ending cliffhanger.\n\nOf course, we are now examining what happens when women take the law into their own hands to eliminate a threat of rape. Shirley has become a vigilante and there will be considerable discussion in future episodes about whether or not she should be convicted. There are some interesting twists and turns.\n\nI should comment on Peter’s confession. While being held at gunpoint, Shirley forces Peter to confess to the rapes but this type of confession would never hold up in court. Prior to this, a psych ward patient admitted to the rapes but his confession was discounted. There is another man who is committing rape at St. Eligius, which is revealed, and so we can never be sure just how guilty Peter is.\n\nShirley definitely feels he is guilty, but she resorts to entrapment and becomes a criminal herself.\n\nIt is significant that she shoots him in the groin and then in the heart. This was a shocking storyline for primetime television in the mid-80s.\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 3, Episode 3 — Two Balls and a Strike; Broadcast on October 3, 1984\n\nStory by John Masius and Tom Fontana and John Tinker; Teleplay by John Tinker\n\nDirected by David Anspaugh\n\nJlewis:\n\nThis episode was not available for my viewing.\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nThe third season of St. Elsewhere opens with a short arc about a nurses’ strike. It’s an interesting story, especially since it adds a new dimension to the working relationship between head nurse Helen Rosenthal (Christina Pickles) and veteran administrator Dr. Daniel Auschlander (Norman Lloyd) who sit on opposite sides of the bargaining table.\n\nThe story shows the need for a compromise and there are long-term ramifications on St. Eligius’ budget when some concessions must be made to keep the nurses happy. I have to chuckle at how Dr. Auschlander is a bit arrogant at first, then gradually realizes that Rosenthal and her group are a force to be reckoned with, when they vote to strike.\n\nInto this mix a labor negotiator (Herb Edelman) is introduced. He becomes a new love interest for Rosenthal.\n\nNurse Lucy Papandrao (Jennifer Savidge), who will later become the second Mrs. Victor Ehrlich, helps to lead the strike with Rosenthal. Meanwhile nurse Shirley Daniels (Ellen Bry, wife of writer-producer John Masius) continues to work her usual shifts. They can’t all go out on the picket line, or else the hospital would close.\n\n***\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 3, Episode 4 — Strikeout; Broadcast on October 17, 1984\n\nStory by John Masius and Tom Fontana and Steve Bello; Teleplay by Steve Bello\n\nDirected by Mark Tinker\n\nJlewis:\n\nWe are now well into the third season with an October 17, 1984 episode. The latest story arc involves a nursing strike that is going on while William Daniels’ Mark Craig is still on vacation at home with his wife Ellen, after a vacation abroad to Honolulu, and now complaining about the shoddy construction work done to their home while away.\n\nHe hires Luther (Eric Laneuville) and his buddy Warren (Byron Stewart), who is temporarily laid off on account of the strike, to do patch work for him. This provides scenes where he can act all bombastic and patronizing to others, aspects that I am sure some viewers may find quite enduring if not necessarily me. For me, a little Mark Craig goes a long, long way. (The actor is still doing pretty well today at age 94 as is Bonnie Bartlett at age 92, both still happily married in real life.)\n\nRegardless of strikes that demand better wages and better working situations, many a nurse’s call to duty still reins supreme. Lucy (Jennifer Savidge) leaves her striking post to aid an all important surgery here involving a fire fighter. Nice to see Herb Edelman in a guest appearance as part of the negotiations along with head nurse Helen Rosenthal (Christina Pickles); his career stretching from the original Odd Couple to his later role as Stan in The Golden Girls.\n\nCathy is shown in training for her new specialized work, which is a nice contrast to the surreal dark humor surrounding her in the previous episode I watched. Psychiatry is a topic that needs to be explored more often in TV shows. Hypnosis is also examined here involving another interesting lead character, Dr. Charlotte (Renée Taylor).\n\nPeter returns for more ”sick games” in a private meeting with Cathy, continuing his villain-ish role into the new season. From the way she is holding herself, sobbing, when she leaves the room he traps her in, you can tell there was obvious sexual abuse. Not that we are certain what exactly happens, but I do think Peter is guilty and that his buddy, Jack, is still in denial of accepting.\n\nThere is an unsettling, scene at the end when Shirley (Ellen Bry) seeks forgiveness from bed-bound Cathy for misjudging her earlier. Cathy’s response: ”Cathy Martin is gone. She is never coming back.”\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nAfter picketing in front of the hospital in rainy weather, the strike finally ends. The nurses emerge victorious in their crusade for better wages, benefits and hours. Emotions have run high during the walkout. Shirley Daniels, who continued to work during the strike, is probably the one most at her wit’s end.\n\nAs Jlewis described above, Shirley has been feeling guilty about not supporting Dr. Cathy Martin (Barbara Whinnery) during Peter White’s recent rape trial. The subsequent fallout is that the women are more on edge than ever, because Peter is back on staff and everyone continues to feel vulnerable.\n\nI think an overlooked part of the strike storyline is that during negotiations, Nurse Rosenthal did not bring up the nurses’ safety when she was sitting at the bargaining table with Dr. Auschlander. She would have felt the need to mention tighter security and precautions being taken to keep the staff from harm. Granted, not all the nurses are women, but I do feel the nurses as a whole would have wanted Rosenthal to bring this up during negotiations since Peter White has returned to St. Eligius.\n\nMeanwhile, Cathy starts to go off the rails and in an upcoming episode she is victimized again. But is Peter really her rapist?\n\nRenee Taylor’s character is just a temporary guest and she only appears in two or three episodes. But I thought it was a good idea that they brought in a female shrink. The previous psychiatrists had all been male.\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 2, Episode 20 — Cramming; Broadcast on May 2, 1984\n\nWritten by Steve Lawson and Steve Bello\n\nDirected by Tim Matheson\n\nJlewis:\n\nA conversation involving Philip and Wendy two weeks ago (we are skipping another episode) mentioned possible lay-offs at the hospital. Victor and Dr. Craig continue the topic during surgery and ”Daddy” reminds ”Junior” that he is just as vulnerable as anybody else. The title of our episode refers to the latest round of national board tests for the interns and they must all prep for them or Get The Cut.\n\nIn a lie detector test, Peter admits to assaulting Cathy Martin. She had confronted him previously in the cafeteria and he denied it, as he does to his friend Jack later. She testifies at the trial, but is cross questioned about her own delusional memories and is also asked, shockingly, how many times she has had sex in the morgue. Her response is an angry ”none of your damn business,” rather than yes or no.\n\nLater, she gets some judgment comments in the cafeteria about her sex life. I won’t get into how often women are judged for such things with more scorn than men usually are, but it is what it is and those critiquing her most are quite often women.\n\nWendy gets the primary focus here, cramming for her tests and causing a bit of havoc with Wayne Fiscus over a patient’s diagnosis. She is feeling anger lately, although it isn’t explained exactly why. Perhaps, her ordeal with Peter played a part. The loss of a patient’s baby under her care understandably makes her downward emotional spiral worse.\n\nWe were clued in previously by Annie that she may be suffering an eating disorder. In a candid conversation with Cathy about childhood dreams, Wendy reveals she did not embark on a career as a dancer due to being fat-shamed by others. Kim Miyori gives a pretty good performance here, but I kinda wish there had been a little more development of ”why” she is going through all of this.\n\nVictor’s Aunt Cherise (Louise Lasser) has a comic visiting role and attempts to date Donald Westphall. Although he is listed first in the opening credits, I often forget to mention Ed Flanders’ matter-of-fact performance as the head physician supervisor in the bulk of these episodes.\n\nBack to Cherise. I was confused at first as to why she was in this episode and what her primary purpose was. In a way, she vaguely resembles Cathy in an older, more psychologically adjusted form; both ladies being quite eccentric and she admits to Victor that she had many male acquaintances in her past but has, as the popular song goes, been looking for love in all the wrong places.\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nThis is one of my favorite episodes. I gave it a 10/10 on the IMDb. It really adheres to the main theme of the show, that St. Eligius is a teaching hospital. Residents are seen learning and increasing their knowledge on the job, as they all prepare to pass important exams.\n\nThe emphasis seems more on the younger cast members in these types of episodes. We know they all won’t pass and be invited back for the next year of residency at the hospital.\n\nDr. Jack Morrison (David Morse) is, intellectually speaking, the weakest link on staff. A plot in season 3 will develop this strand further…he is revealed to have earned an earlier medical degree in an accelerated program at a barely accredited college in Mexico. Morrison may lack the knowledge of his colleagues, but he cares a lot about his patients and he is the only non-hispanic who speaks Spanish at St. Eligius.\n\nJlewis mentioned the subplot involving Dr. Ehrlich’s wacky aunt Cherise (Louise Lasser). She appeared earlier in the season at the Craigs’ home when Victor married Roberta. writers do not feature Aunt Cherise again. Instead they play up the fact that Victor is estranged from two siblings and they have lost their parents. However, Victor’s parents turn up in season 5, in the form of Steve Allen & Jayne Meadows, and they are even spacier than Aunt Cherise!\n\n***\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 2, Episode 21 — Rough Cut; Broadcast on May 9, 1984\n\nStory by Steve Lawson and Steve Bello; Teleplay by Susan Lindner & Mitchell Fink\n\nDirected by Eric Laneuville\n\nJlewis:\n\nSax jazz starts us off on a light note, but this episode is anything but light. The music playing gets Victor on edge as he tries to break open the candy machine. Like Wendy, the stress at work gets him hungry often.\n\nMark Harmon’s Dr. Robert Caldwell seems like the more adjusted one here at first, agreeing with his girlfriend’s suggestion to an escape to Paris. That is, until he gets a stuck-in-the-zipper situation predating THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and Ben Stiller’s comic incident.\n\nFittingly, Dr. Annie Cavanero (Cynthia Sikes) is the one who aids him, which I found most appropriate due to her previous experience with the college student also suffering a problem down below. Robert eventually decides to call it quits in his relationship, which prompts the question: is the zipper injury on his ”little” head impacting his ”big” head’s decision making?\n\nAt first, I thought the title referred to Dr. Wayne Fiscus (Howie Mandel). He complains about not getting any romance in his life and then agrees to partake in a Boston’s Most Eligible Bachelor magazine photo gig. We see his rough-cut photo shoot edited along with scenes of the elder doctors — Daniel Auschlander (Norman Lloyd), Mark Craig (William Daniels) and Donald Westphall (Ed Flanders) discussing his rising status among the staff and in the medical community.\n\nOf course, Wayne is a trifle worried at first if this silly media project will impact his credibility as a physician, but he quickly gets wrapped up in the excitement. Like Robert, he also appears for the camera shirtless…and with a bow-tie no less.\n\nI guess some commentary should be made about his subtle homophobia when his public photo ”exposure” gets a few guys, rather than girls, calling to date him. Had this show been done more recently, Wayne would more likely have taken it in stride and responded in a more polite ”sorry, I don’t swing that way” or something along those lines.\n\nYet this was the 1980s when society was far more conservative and less gay friendly. Not that this show is any more offensive to modern viewers than anything else you would see from this time period (note how much worse the teen comedies were at this time) and, of course, not every viewer watching it today would be bothered by it.\n\nNeedless to say, I had mixed opinions about the peculiar blend of high comedy with dark menace and depression. This brings me to the our trio of hospital heads all agreeing that, like Wayne, Wendy should also stay regardless of her personal struggles.\n\nShe certainly has her hands full, with a bereaved mother lashing out on her and yet another nurse commenting on her eating too much, something she was likely NOT in the mood to hear. When you are feeling that depressed, ”helpful” criticism is last thing that is helpful if you want to lift up your spirits. Then there’s her friendship with eccentric Cathy and her live-to-the-edge talk.\n\nThis all sets up for a big tragedy as she suffers a pill overdose and dies during surgery. Yes, in one quick flash, Wendy’s role on this show ends abruptly.\n\nLater we get an unusual and, for me at least, unexpected speech between Cathy and Daniel about her own future as a psychiatrist/therapist. It is unusual only to me because I found her pre-suicide advice a bit strange. Again, maybe I just need more backstory on the Cathy/Wendy relationship so that all of this material isn’t so abrupt to me?\n\nCathy meets up with evil Peter again and I get a curious sense that both characters have multiple personalities. Not that I consider anything else between them similar.\n\nBoth Jack and Peter initially get the cut and have an intense discussion about it. Jack feels he deserves his, often being hard on himself. After Wendy’s death, however, he is reinstated with Donald referencing Wendy’s last words written down ”Why does life always start tomorrow?” On a more uplifting note, the cast all toast to Wendy’s life at the end since tomorrow is always another day.\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nThis is a very emotional episode. As Jlewis pointed out, it features the last appearance of resident Dr. Wendy Armstong (Kim Miyori). Though she still remains in the opening credits for one more episode.\n\nI should point out that Rough Cut currently has the highest score of any St. Elsewhere episode on the IMDb. I guess Armstrong’s unexpected death packed a punch, or else Howie Mandel’s legion of fans upvoted it because his character, Dr. Wayne Fiscus, strips down to his underwear during the photo shoot.\n\nI thought the comedy plot with Dr. Bobby Caldwell (Mark Harmon) was a bit silly…we find out he stopped using underwear and gets his zipper stuck. Ouch! This is the end for Caldwell and Joan Halloran (Nancy Stafford) as a couple. Halloran still appears on a recurring basis in season 3 and season 4.\n\nWhat can I say about Peter White. The character fascinates me. I love this storyline. It’s a thoughtful piece about how rape, and accusations of rape, affect everyone on staff at a large hospital.\n\nI can see how Jlewis feels Peter might have more than one personality. Some shocking things happen to Peter at the start of season 3. I think the scene near the end of this episode where Peter reminds Dr. Westphall (Ed Flanders) that he will be back, is excellent. Westphall had once been Peter White’s staunchest advocate. But now they have become enemies, since Westphall believes Peter should not have been exonerated and poses a continuing danger at the hospital.\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 2, Episode 16 — After Dark; Broadcast on February 29, 1984\n\nStory by John Masius and Tom Fontana and Steve Lawson; Teleplay by Steve Lawson\n\nDirected by Eric Laneuville\n\nJlewis:\n\nAlthough we are not 100% certain if Peter White (Terence Knox) is THE serial rapist, we did see him attack co-worker Wendy Armstrong (Kim Miyori) in the last episode. His rage here is agitated by her higher position on the totem pole than him (i.e. he accuses her of being snobbish). He gets arrested for his behavior but you quickly suspect that he will be back to work since so many who don’t know him well view him as a ”nice” guy.\n\nContinuing from last week, we have the saga of a construction worker named Joe (Dan Hedaya) eager to return back to work who suffers dramatic seizures. Jack Morrison (David Morse) attends him and also visits his over protective mother (Angela Clarke) at her place. This story raises some interesting questions in regards to our present day working conditions that impact our overall health. Yet Joe may just be depressed with his lot in life and using his smoking and other addictions to end it quicker.\n\nOh…Victor, Victor, Victor. You can be so annoying with your new wife. At least he gets more interesting as a character when temptation arrives to disrupt the home front in the form of a sultry patient he examines and she is quite open and direct in her flirtations when unknowingly talking to Roberta. Victor makes the mistake of questioning Dr. Mark Craig about his need-to-stray during bloody surgery and gets the expected marital advice from ”Yes, Daddy” in the form of ”When you get stuck with a lemon, just spit out the pits and live with the juice.” Love that line. Ha ha!\n\nWe now have Mark Harmon back as Dr. Robert Caldwell.\n\nThe ladies auxiliary convention allows the cast to dress up like they are the swells in Dallas. I guess that is Gretchen Wyler playing the matron in charge who annoys everybody in her bossy, gossipy manner in these particular shows?\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nI thought this episode had a great ending. Peter White (Terrence Knox) is arrested and hauled away, while Jack Morrison (David Morse) looks on and business at the hospital is conducted as usual. On traditional medical programs, this would probably be the end for a guy like Peter. He seems to be guilty and justice must be served. However, since St. Elsewhere is a serialized medical show and Peter White is still a lead character AND the second season is not over yet, we can be sure his storyline is not over. And indeed, it is not.\n\nActually, Peter’s story does not technically end until the 5th season, and even then it carries forward under a new guise.\n\nI did not include ‘Vanity,’ the episode right after this one because Peter appears in flashback and has only one scene where Jack visits him at the prison. Peter obviously fights the charges, and he does get out on bail. The rape trial occurs very quickly.\n\nWhat’s important in this ongoing arc is the close friendship between Peter and Jack. Back in season 1, Jack Morrison’s wife Nina had a son they named Peter, after Peter White who is Jack’s best friend in the residency program at St. Eligius. While everyone else is damning Peter and trying to convict him as the culprit behind the masked rapes, Jack continues to stand by him.\n\nHowever, another character, Nurse Shirley Daniels (Ellen Bry), will take a decidedly different approach.\n\nI already mentioned that Dr. Wendy Armstrong (Kim Miyori) spirals into a depression after her violent encounter with Peter and she will commit suicide, when her bulimia gets out of hand.\n\nJlewis went over the subplot with the construction worker. This is basically a self-contained story. St. Elsewhere is known for stories of varying lengths. While the Peter White saga runs for several seasons, there are some arcs that last only one season, for a span of episodes. Meanwhile, there are more traditional plots that are resolved within a given episode.\n\nAs for Dr. Victor Ehrlich (Ed Begley Jr.) and his wife Roberta, their marriage is very short-lived. Basically we have a comedy plot, filled with a certain amount of romantic angst for Victor. The real heart of the story is that Victor’s controlling mentor Dr. Mark Craig (William Daniels) is now taking him more under his wing.\n\nThough often exasperated by Victor’s antics, Dr. Craig sees potential in him and they have an edgy father-son bond. Their “relationship” is contrasted with the fact that Dr. Craig is estranged from his own son Steven, who is off somewhere in a residency program at another hospital.\n\nRe: Mark Harmon’s character Dr. Bobby Caldwell…he is a plastic surgeon and that causes a more superficial outlook in his character. Harmon’s character is written as basically a nice guy, with hang-ups, in seasons 2 and 3. But going into season 4, Bobby morphs into a cad, sleeping with a bunch of random women and he contracts the AIDS virus.\n\nBobby’s girlfriend Joan Halloran (Nancy Stafford) continues to appear at St. Eligius in an administrative capacity on a recurring basis, and she is involved in the AIDS arc in the middle of season 4, since she has to get tested as Bobby may have infected her.\n\nActress Gretchen Wyler is seen on a recurring basis in season 2, but her character is dropped afterward. She added a certain zest to the proceedings as a matron in charge of fundraising activities at the hospital through the ladies auxiliary. The writers hand these plots over to Jane Wyatt. Wyatt portrays Katherine Auslander, the respected wife of Norman Lloyd’s character.\n\n***\n\nSt. Elsewhere\n\nSeason 2, Episode 18 — Equinox; Broadcast on March 14, 1984\n\nStory by John Masius and Tom Fontana; Teleplay by Channing Gibson & Charles H. Eglee\n\nDirected by David Anspaugh\n\nJlewis:\n\nDr. Peter White (Terence Knox) is back to work, but with security monitoring him constantly. Dr. Wendy Armstrong (Kim Miyori) is justifiably furious that his sentence is downgraded to a mere ”battery.” Likewise, Barbara Whinnery’s Dr. Cathy Martin also had conflict with Peter and she seeks resident psychiatrist Paul Sand’s Michael Ridley to help her adjust. Her comment about wanting to ”dream in color again” is interesting.\n\nI have to comment a bit on the opening credits of the show. It starts in the beginning with three transitions from black and white to full color, starting with the established shot of the hospital and with at least three main characters and performers playing them also making the transition.\n\nIt would be interesting to know what the creators’ intentions here were. Were they just being gimmicky in showing some kind of artistic relevance? Or is some sort of symbolic meaning imposed here?\n\nOther stories: test*cal cancer…and losing one…is a new topic here a college dude named Kevin (Thomas Byrd) eager for spring break. For the opposite gender, breast cancer also gets profiled and puts individual patients to question what it means to be a man and a woman.\n\nHowie Mandel’s Dr. Wayne Fiscus is again working with kids (assisting one’s dog in a previous episode) and later suffers great tragedy when his beloved cap is put in the microwave oven by accident.\n\nLuther Hawkins is now competing with Phillip Chandler (Denzel Washington) for the same girl (”dim the lights and put on the Barry White”) and we see Mean Green-with-jealousy Phillip lurk out with his constant personal attacks on his rival.\n\nFor over the top dramatics, we have a Christopher Payne (Charles Tyner) of the Paul Revere Society bringing a horse for surgery, but this is quickly resolved in a few minutes of screen time.\n\n***\n\nTopBilled:\n\nPeter has been released on bail and is back working at St. Eligius while awaiting his rape trial. His mentor Dr. Donald Westphall (Ed Flanders) has done a 180, having gone from staunch supporter and defender of Peter White, to now believing Peter is guilty of the crimes that he is alleged to have committed. Westphall regrets keeping Peter on at St. Eligius after the drugs debacle of the previous season, and he regards White as a liability.\n\nHowever, White’s constitutional rights prevent him from being fired, while he is still in the process of going through the court system. Westphall’s answer is to have Peter monitored and he keeps Peter away from the E.R. where Peter had been interacting with many female coworkers and patients. Peter’s current assignment is the morgue where he is meant to stay out of trouble. But Peter has had issues with Dr. Cathy Martin (Barbara Whinnery) who works with him in the morgue.\n\nAs Jlewis mentioned, Dr. Wendy Armstrong (Kim Miyori) is upset that the charges against White have been reduced to battery. The rapes that occurred cannot be pinned on Peter, since they occurred with the assailant wearing a mask and none of the victims can make a positive ID.\n\nHowever, there was one altercation between White and Martin at the morgue, in which she pulled off his mask. But Cathy did not report the incident, and it sort of occurred in a dream-like state.\n\nAlso, since the mask was pulled off, we can assume that this may have stopped White from doing the deed with Cathy, if in fact he did attack her (could it have been a figment in Cathy’s confused imagination?). Cathy is written as an oversexed and mentally unbalanced woman, and she has been depicted this way since she was introduced back in season 1. So is she a victim of Peter’s?\n\nOr is some of this all a big sick fantasy she is experiencing? Yes, this is not a traditional rape/social message storyline.\n\nI am not going to comment much on the black-and-white to color portion of the opening credits, since I don’t know the answer why that was done. Except to say maybe it was supposed to seem like a newspaper clipping of the hospital morphing into how it is today. A sense of ongoing history?\n\nAs for the other plots in this episode, the bit about the man from the Paul Revere Society bringing the horse to surgery is obviously comic relief. And it is also a way for us to get to know the young resident Dr. Elliot Axelrod (Stephen Furst), who is said to be the son of a veterinarian.\n\nAxelrod appeared earlier in season 2 in a slight comedy plot with Dr. Wayne Fiscus (Howie Mandel). I guess he impressed Paltrow and Fontana enough that they brought him back in this episode. He will become a regular member of the cast starting in season 3 and he remains on St. Elsewhere until the end of season 6.\n\nThere is a plot in a season 4 episode where Axelrod helps treat a gorilla that is brought into the ER. And another plot, also in season 4, where he looks after a homing pigeon owned by Luther (Eric Laneuville). So the writers do not forget that he is the son of a vet, and that he enjoys helping animal patients as much as human ones."
