        "text": "How did we not know this movie was partially filmed in Montana? Was our childhood a lie?\n\nMovie Business in Montana\n\nThe movie business in Montana has been booming lately.\n\nBig Sky Country has seen several high-profile and independent film productions come to Montana. Everything from horror to westerns to dramatic movies has set up shop in Montana.\n\nMontana used to see film productions rarely. Even though there were some classic films shot here, like A River Runs Through It, Legends of The Fall, and more.\n\nMontana has gone to great lengths to become more attractive for film and TV productions. The results are more jobs for locals, and businesses are attracting more customers.\n\nFilms Making Money in Montana\n\nFilms shot in Montana are mostly arthouse films that won't make billions of dollars, but a few have made hundreds of millions.\n\nThe one film that comes to mind is Dances With Wolves.\n\nDances With Wolves made over $400 million and was shot all over Montana. It's a classic and stars cinema legend Kevin Costner.\n\nYou would think that is the highest-grossing film set or filmed in Montana, right?\n\nWRONG!\n\nThe highest-grossing film out of Montana will blow your mind.\n\nHighest-Grossing Film From Montana\n\nThe highest-grossing film from Montana is...The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.\n\nYou might ask, isn't this movie primarily filmed in England or set in a fantasy realm?\n\nYou're right, but USDish says this movie is the highest-grossing movie out of Montana.\n\nWe did some research and have our answer. The film's 2nd Unit came to Montana and shot several landscape scenes in Glacier National Park.\n\nNone of the actors were in Montana, but the film did have some scenes in Big Sky Country.\n\nShould this count as the highest-grossing movie in Montana? It's a valid question."
