        "text": "I knew one of the wranglers on Heaven's Gate.\n\nLater on, I came to know a musician who was part of a big scene in the movie as well.\n\nThey also said the party was non-stop, but the wrangler didn't participate; he had a couple of his own horses to care for along with the others he was hired on to take care of. (I don't know if the musician joined the party or not- never asked.)\n\nMichael Cimino, the director, was never a paradigm of a director who controls tightly. His earlier big hit movie The Deer Hunter shows plenty of evidence of that, and displays Cimino's weaknesses. But the Deer Hunter wasn't made in an era when cocaine was the drug of choice, and according to the guy I knew, there was a mountain of white powder that dusted the production like snow, except it wasn't exactly snow.\n\nI have seen the picture several times. It's kind of like watching the Russian version of War and Peace; the movie in it's original director's cut is over 3 1/2 hours long. Part of it is filmed in sepia, because United Artists, the studio, refused to foot the bill for those scenes to be processed in full Technicolor, which was used in the rest of the film.\n\nThe pace of the movie is as glacial as the Deer Hunter was, except worse, if a quick pace is what attracts you to watch a movie. The scope is epic- the movie begins with a graduation at Yale, where the 3 major characters in the film all graduate in one class, before they all move west to Wyoming a decade later. (The film is supposed to take place in Wyoming. Wallace was the stand-in town for 19th century Sheridan.) And it ends over 30 years later, with one of the major characters now at sea in his own yacht, far away from the west.\n\nIf you are ready to spend a full evening watching it, and you like long epic movies, it's excellent. Not so much, though, if you are in a theater, though, with its relatively cramped seats.\n\nThe most interesting thing about it is how impossible it became to edit into a shorter, faster moving, more concise motion picture. Each scene is a polished gem of its own, and every scene lasts about 3-4 minutes too long, but there's no dialog or action in every scene that can be edited out without ruining the entire scene.\n\nThe biggest hunk the studio tried to cut, the one that's partly in sepia, was one of the longest scenes, and one of the most appealing; it was an extended scene that was done inside Heaven's Gate, the canvas covered roller skating rink that was the poor immigrant's main source of fun and the escape from the harsh reality of their lives.\n\nIt was cut because it wasn't necessary to the plot, but it showed the motivations of all the main characters, where their loyalties lay in the war that was coming, and was the only real joyful moment in the entire movie. Everyone in the scene meets their fate later on, when the cattle barons go to war with the immigrants. Without it, the rest of the movie goes flat.\n\nWatching a fiddler on roller skates lead a hundred of people dancing, all on skates and in moving lines swirling around the floor of Heaven's Gate is the most memorable scene in the movie. We have all seen every other scene before in other Westerns, but this one was unique and very memorable.\n\nMost of it was filmed in Montana. The scenes in Wallace are relatively brief, but they do show off Wallace's downtown pretty well. I think they were the first in the production, as the weariness of the entire cast becomes more evident as the picture goes on.\n\nI don't do drugs, and I've never done cocaine, but I know folks who were hooked on it, and they say things become obsessive when someone is high on the stuff. I think that's what happened; everyone was intent on making every scene really good, so the movie is a bunch of perfect trees that make a messy, big, tangled forest.\n\nThe movie is based on historic events- the Johnson County War, that took place in a series of Wyoming range war events between 1889 and 1893, but is fictionalized, though most of the main characters are based on real people.\n\nI saw Dante's Peak, too. it doesn't show off Wallace like Heaven's Gate did, and it's a more average movie by far.\n\nIf you love Westerns and want to spend an evening in a marathon, it's a good choice. Kris Kristofferson, Jeff Bridges, Sam Waterson, John Hurt and Christopher Walken (who plays a semi-good guy) all turn in some of their best performances ever in it, and if it had not been such a massive box office bomb, Isabelle Hupert would be as famous here as she is in France.\n\nIt's very evident where a lot of the money went; the production is very historically accurate in all the details. The costuming, props and trappings are all really faithful to the times, and many were reproduced from museum pieces that can be found in Wyoming museums I've visited. The Cattleman's Club set was built from the actual blueprints of the real building.\n\nWallace was selected specifically because it remains 19th century in the downtown. It was chosen because of the railway that's in town, which plays an important part of the scenes that were shot there.\n\nBut be warned- the graphic violence is very graphic and very violent, and includes a rape, so it's not a movie for the kids or those who don't like to see this stuff. It has been a while since I saw it last, and with the expected cold snap coming next week, I may try to rent it again, just as a good excuse to curl up with some popcorn and a beer next to the fire when it's too cold to go out.\n\nHere's a good piece on it- it has a nice shot of Wallace in the article.\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/201...d-almost-dest/\n\nLonesome Dove is the way a Western epic should be. When it first aired, it was on as a miniseries, with 2 hours per episode shown on every following night.\n\nThe original cut of Heaven's Gate was over 5 1/2 hours long. The final Director's Cut was finally released on DVD in 2013, and I haven't seen it yet, but I did see the same cut on tape, quite a long time ago now. Even though I like it, Lonesome Dove is better by far as a real epic. The theater is sometimes not the best place for long stories that are intimately told in detail.\n\nOne interesting thing about Heaven's Gate was when it was released in 1980, the Western had gone through a long resurgence of popularity throughout the decade before. The 1970s saw many of the most popular Westerns, and many of the most critically successful, ever made.\n\nThe Western is our great national myth- the way Americans first defined what 'America' is, and how we still define ourselves. Heaven's Gate was so excessive in everything that it killed the Western as a genre for over a full decade afterward, and the Western has yet to regain it's former dominance in our popular entertainment that it enjoyed for so long.\n\nMuch was due to the studios; the 70s was a decade when the studios allowed young directors to make motion pictures that were financially risky.\n\nCimino's big hit The Deer Hunter was one, and when it became a big money-making hit, and won the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars, became the reason why Cimino was allowed to get away with going so far over-budget and over-schedule.\n\nBut when it bombed, the bean counters, the producers, the directors, and the actors in the studios all didn't want to be the ones who would be held accountable when a picture failed to return its investment any more, and our movies became a lot more conventional and less controversial afterward.\n\nWhich in turn has led to the current sequel after sequel after sequel. There's nothing these days like a popular franchise, and motion pictures have always been as much about money as art."
