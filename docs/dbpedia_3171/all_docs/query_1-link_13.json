        "text": "BUTTE, MT - What's your favorite movie of all time?\n\nFor most people, that is an almost impossible question to answer. For us here at the station, there are just too many variables that go into choosing a \"favorite movie,\" all time or otherwise. Seriously, how does one pick a favorite movie of all time: something that surely switches with one's mood, place in life, experiences they go through, and inner mentality? And why is the answer always Paddington 2?\n\nAlthough most answers you'll hear change as time goes on, there is always an element that influences someone's answer: movies shot in their hometown or even just a place they lived. Whenever you see your hometown up on the silver screen, and no matter how good or bad the movie is, it never ceases to create a sense of excitement and buzz in you. The places you're all too familiar with suddenly become mythologized on the screen, seeing the familiar environments through an unfamiliar cinematic eye. Plus, it's cool to go, \"Hey, I've been there!\"\n\nWhat are some of the most popular movies that have been shot here in Butte, MT? Let's take a look...\n\nAlthough we haven't seen every single one of these movies, we are familiar with most and the ones we aren't have already been added to the list. Plus, it's pretty cool to see some famous actors like Mark Wahlberg, Clint Eastwood, and Sam Shepard roaming these parts."
