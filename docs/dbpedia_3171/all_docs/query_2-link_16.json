        "text": "Western Montana’s cinematic landscapes have long inspired film producers, setting the stage for legendary films like “A River Runs Through It” and binge-worthy TV shows like “Yellowstone.” As we shelter in our homes and practice social distancing, we may find ourselves in need of a distraction. To help you escape, we’ve rounded up famous movies and shows filmed in Western Montana. Grab some popcorn and plan a virtual movie date with a friend or a movie-marathon stay-cation in your living room. We hope you enjoy these films and find some inspiration for your next dream trip to Glacier Country—you’ll be amazed by what the camera couldn’t capture.\n\nA RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT\n\nOne of the most famous movies to come out of Western Montana is “A River Runs Through It.” If you haven’t seen it yet, this is a must-watch-before-visiting movie. Based on the book written by Norman Maclean, a former Missoula resident, the movie follows the life of a stern minister’s two sons growing up in rural Montana. It stars Brad Pitt, and it won an Oscar for Best Cinematography. Filmed almost entirely in Montana, you won’t want to miss the iconic scene locations.

Although Forrest has an IQ of 75, he doesn’t let that stop him from being a college football star, fighting in Vietnam, captaining a shrimp boat, or loving Jenny, his sweet but troubled childhood friend. Forrest inspires people with his optimism. Forrest Gump won six Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Film Editing and Best Visual Effects.

A writer, Jack takes on a caretaker job at a remote hotel in Colorado, hoping to cure his writer’s block. He brings his wife and his son, who begins to have disturbing psychic premonitions. As Jack discovers the hotel’s dark secrets, he begins to have homicidal thoughts of his family.

Four children are sent away to the countryside during wartime and find a magical wardrobe that leads to another world, Narnia. Here they discover their destiny is tied with Narnia’s freedom from the White Witch, under the guidance of a mystical lion. Channel It: Plan to visit Glacier National Park and let your imagination roam; it’s not hard to picture it as another world completely.\n\n+ Glacier National Park\n\nTHE REVENANT\n\nSet in the 1820s, “The Revenant” is based on the book of the same name written by Missoula resident, Michael Punke, and is filmed in part in northwestern Montana. The movie is about the true story of Hugh Glass, a trapper who embarks on a fur trading expedition. While scouting he is mauled by a grizzly bear, and though he is not expected to survive, his company orders two men to stay behind and tend to Hugh as he dies. Instead, the men abandon him. Driven by revenge, Hugh becomes determined to live so he can find the men for retribution. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, “The Revenant” won three Oscars: Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, Best Achievement in Directing and Best Achievement in Cinematography.
