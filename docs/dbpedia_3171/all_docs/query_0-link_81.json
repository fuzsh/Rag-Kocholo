        "text": "Sometimes, all the romance you need is cuddling up with the right someone and watching a love story.\n\nHow about love stories based in Montana? I thought I'd share three of the best romance movies that are set right here in Big Sky Country. Keep in mind that just because it's a love story, does not mean that everyone lives happily every after. But at least they have the Montana factor going for them.\n\nIt was hard for me to decide my favorite of the three so they're in no particular order.\n\nLegends of the Fall\n\nSet in the early 1900's just outside of Helena, it showcases three brothers in a family, their lives, and the woman they all loved at one time.\n\nNext up is the movie, Always.\n\nTechnically, I don't think the movie is actually SET in Montana, but a lot of it was filmed here, so in my mind, it's a Montana love story. Pilots helping to fight forest fires is pretty Montana anyway.\n\nAnd lastly, The Horse Whisperer\n\nI won't lie, I haven't seen this movie. When I asked Nick if it was a love story he said something like, \"Pfft, you bet it's a love story.\" so it's on the list. It's set in Montana when a mother and daughter come to have her daughter and horse work through trauma together, and love ensues.\n\nLike I said before, just because it's a love story, doesn't mean it has a happy ending.\n\nNeed some other romantic ideas for a night in? I have you covered."
