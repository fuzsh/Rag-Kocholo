        "text": "The following is a list of last words attributed to various fictional characters in films. Characters are listed according to the originating film, then the name of character the quote is attributed to (in case of more than one quote per source). Where quotes come from a series of films, they are organized in the order of the films they appeared in (for example, quotes from the first Kill Bill film appear before quotes from the second film, and so on). Where possible, for the purposes of clarification, further explanatory notes have been presented. Additionally, if a character's final words consist of a dialogue with the other characters, the other character's speech may be included for contextual purposes; for example, if one character asks a question that the one who is about to die answers.\n\nSome characters may have more than one \"death,\" in instances such as being resurrected, or existing temporarily as an undead being. In some of those instances, their last words from each \"death\" may be added if they are significant. Additionally, significant last words from deaths that are merely assumed to have happened or are non-canon are included. In instances where there are multiple outcomes, or in media with alternate timelines, the character's last words will also be featured.\n\nShit.\n\nWho: Tommy Darden\n\nNote: Tommy says this while being held at gunpoint after realizing that his boss, Ben Wade, is going to kill him and his captor.
