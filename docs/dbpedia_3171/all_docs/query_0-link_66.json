        "text": "There aren't many gangster films to ever be made in Montana, and this one is underrated.\n\nWe all love a good movie set or filmed in Montana. We have had some classics filmed in Montana like A River Runs Through It and Legends of the Fall, and we have seen some stellar TV shows like Yellowstone.\n\nMontanans love a great film or show set in our state, but there can be slim choices depending on what you want to watch.\n\nWhat if you wanted to watch a gangster film set in Montana? You are in luck.\n\nIn 2001, a film starring some high-profile actors was set in a small town in Montana and was a box office bomb.\n\nThe film was The Knockaround Guys. The film starred Academy Award-nominated actors like Dennis Hopper and John Malkovich. The movie featured prominent actors Vin Diesel, Seth Green, and Barry Pepper.\n\nThe movie is about a group of up-and-coming gangsters transporting a bag of money. They stop in the small town of Wibaux, Montana, and get in deep trouble.\n\nThe movie won't blow you away, but it has some stellar shots of Montana and is a great film to put on if you have nothing else to check out.\n\nWhy didn't this film find any success? Well, it was released three days before September 11th.\n\nThere are many hidden gems of films like this that many Montanans have probably never seen. One that is constantly overlooked is the 1974 heist film Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, starring Clint Eastwood and a young Jeff Bridges. The film was shot throughout central and northern Montana and is a fantastic watch.\n\nWho's down for a Montana movie night?"
