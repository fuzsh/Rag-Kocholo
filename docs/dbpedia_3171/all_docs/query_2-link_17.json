        "text": "I love movies. It does not matter the genre, I love them all- even mindless popcorn movies. Sometimes just shutting your brain off and seeing some big explosions is the best thing to do after a long day at work.\n\nSo the other night while watching a movie I got to thinking, what if Montana cities were movies from the 90s?\n\nWhy did I pick the 90s? Honestly, there is no real reason I did. Perhaps it's because I grew up in the 80s and 90s, so flicks from that decade were the movies that shaped me as I was coming of age.\n\nI think the biggest reason I chose this era is because the 90's fall into the target age range for most of our demographics, that being you- the reader. The chance that young people have seen movies from the 70's, or old people seeing movies from 2020's is a bit lower. This way everyone gets to have fun.\n\nWho knows, maybe I could do other decades as well. I would love to hear suggestions of what movies you think Montana cities would be for the other decades, but that is for another article.\n\nI would also love to hear if you agree or disagree with my choices. I put a lot of time, effort and science into putting this list together. OK, that is a lie. This is just for fun so do not hate me if did not pick the right movie in your opinion for any of the cities on the list."
