Throughout his ﬁve-decade acting career, Eastwood remains best known on screen for two action icons: the laconic spaghetti western hero ‘The Man with No Name’ and the last hope for law enforcement in San Francisco, Inspector ‘Dirty’ Harry Francis Callahan. Both are inﬂuential Eastwood creations – hard man action heroes, whose appeal transcends generation and gender. Eastwood is the cold killer with the soft, soft voice, who made killing sexy. Eastwood the actor has had an extraordinarily varied career, and critics and fans look for clues to the ‘real person’ in his ﬁ lms. Is he the tough guy, monosyllabic and ruthless with a macabre sense of humour, from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Dirty Harry? Or the windswept, poetry-quoting romantic of The Beguiled and Play Misty for Me? Perhaps he’s the freewheelin’, beer-swiggin’, barroom buddy from his comedies with Clyde the Orang-utan. Or maybe he’s the motivating idealist of Million Dollar Baby, the ﬂawed, wracked hero of Unforgiven, or the hopeless romantic, regretful of lost love, in The Bridges of Madison County. Whoever he is, there is something about the screen Eastwood which has been riveting audiences for almost 50 years. Eastwood’s style is a rather underplayed form of acting, in which the brooding intensity of Brando meets the vulnerability of James Dean. His screen roles\n\n0.1 ‘The Man With No Name’, the hero of Sergio Leone’s ‘Dollars Trilogy’; Clint Eastwood on location in Almeria, Spain in For a Few Dollars More (1965). Author’s collection.\n\nHoHugh_i-xxxii.indd xiii\n\n6/24/2009 3:38:56 AM\n\nxiv Aim for the Heart\n\nthrive on silence and menace for effect, even when he’s the good guy, which gives his heroes added edge. He is also graceful on screen, for someone of his stature (he’s six-feet-four-inches tall), and though his face is often immobile, impervious, a granite mask, his eyes tell all – a ‘look’ from Eastwood can convey many emotions and this technique is something performers can’t learn in acting class. Eastwood is not a stage actor, he never has been – it’s impossible to imagine him in a theatrical production – but the camera loves him and his appeal radiates from the screen. As Eastwood himself noted, ‘Everybody has to play characters that suit them ... Olivier would have looked ridiculous with a poncho and pistol’. In the second of his famous ‘Dirty Harry’ cop thrillers, Magnum Force, Eastwood notes, ‘A man’s got to know his limitations’. Since joining Universal-International as an actor on contract in 1954, Eastwood’s acting career complements the cinema of his lifetime, beginning with his early days in B-movie bit parts and a role in a popular TV western series, Rawhide, where he initially made his mark. He’s made Italian ‘spaghetti’ westerns, American imitations of spaghetti westerns, classic American westerns, a British Boy’s Own war movie, a US ‘GI’s on a mission’ movie, a war-vet movie, a boxing movie, a horror-thriller, a science ﬁction adventure, a musical, a Cold War thriller, an Italian ‘arthouse’ ﬂick, a tear-jerking weepy, a gothic melodrama, cop thrillers, Depression-era dramas, rural Americana comedies, biographical dramas and James Bond espionage thrillers. This is a very broad range of ﬁ lms, even though he has been pigeonholed for years as an ‘action hero’ above all else. Eastwood’s screen heroes have always stood tall, both physically and morally. Like William Munny in Unforgiven, Eastwood’s screen heroes have ‘killed just about everything that walked or crawled at one time or another’, and he’s ‘always been lucky when it comes to killing folks’. His most consistent victims, dispatched to oblivion, have been Mexican bandidos, German soldiers and myriad members of San Francisco’s criminal fraternity, including bank robbers, serial killers and terrorists. Unlike the indestructible action stars who lurched in his wake, like Stallone and Schwarzenegger, Eastwood rarely takes on his adversaries with the help of machine guns, rockets and heavy artillery, disintegrating them like confetti. There’s usually no problem Eastwood can’t solve with a well-aimed bullet from his pistol. Despite his close associations with westerns, Eastwood has hardly been proliﬁc by the genre’s standards, starring in only 10 period westerns in his 50-year career so far. John Wayne made nine in 1934 alone and had made 40 westerns before he hit the big time with Stagecoach (1939). Wayne appeared in over 80 westerns during his long career. But of Eastwood’s 10, he has made ﬁve that can be counted among the genre’s best: the ‘Dollars’ trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), The Outlaw Josey Wales and Unforgiven. Even more ﬁnancially successful are the ﬁ lms where Eastwood has played a police ofﬁcer. The ﬁve-ﬁ lm ‘Dirty Harry’ back catalogue still keeps earning for Warner Bros, while the ‘Dollars’ trilogy has been re-released, repackaged and re-mastered many times since its ﬁrst appearance on home video in the 1980s. Eastwood’s back catalogue is one of the most lucrative in the history of cinema.\n\nHoHugh_i-xxxii.indd xiv\n\n6/24/2009 3:38:56 AM\n\nPreface: Aim for the Art\n\nxv\n\n0.2 War Hero: As Lieutenant Morris Schaeffer, an OSS assassin, Clint Eastwood strikes a Dirty Harry-like pose in the WWII adventure Where Eagles Dare (1968).

Malpaso is Spanish for ‘bad step’ or ‘wrong move’, and is also a creek in his hometown of Carmel-by-the-Sea. His ﬁrst directorial assignment, on Play Misty for Me, saw him cast himself as a late-night radio DJ, and he has directed himself many times since. The ﬁlms he has directed, but not appeared in, include a little-seen love story (Breezy), a jazz biography (Bird), and powerful dramas tackling troubling subject matter, including Mystic River and the uncompromising war ﬁlm Letters from Iwo Jima, two of his ﬁnest achievements behind the camera. Another line from Magnum Force sums up his eclectic, proliﬁc directorial career: ‘I’m afraid you’ve misjudged me’. Perpetually the outsider in Hollywood, his talent and achievements were ﬁnally acknowledged with a brace of Best Director Oscars, for Unforgiven (1992) and Million Dollar Baby (2004), both of which also won Best Picture Academy Awards. Eastwood’s screen legacy has delivered several ‘Clintessential’ Eastwood moments – an action scene, a quirky exchange of dialogue, a gag or an emotional tug, which remind audiences they are watching a star. They include his ‘My mule don’t like people laughing’ speech from A Fistful of Dollars, when facing a bullying welcoming committee in San Miguel. Dirty Harry’s ‘Do you feel lucky, punk?’, when cop Harry Callahan asks a wounded bank robber if he can count up to six. The pool room ﬁght from Coogan’s Bluff, the ﬁnal three-way duel in the graveyard in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and running The Gauntlet of the Phoenix Police Department in a fortiﬁed bus are some of his action highlights. ‘Right turn Clyde’ from Any Which Way You Can, when Clyde the Orang-utan’s punch sends bikers toppling, spoofed his tough guy image. In The Outlaw Josey Wales, Eastwood warns a bounty hunter that, ‘Dying ain’t much of a living, boy’, before being forced to shoot him dead. The parting of the lovers in the rain in The Bridges of Madison County and the death of boxer Maggie in Million Dollar Baby are two of his ﬁnest, most moving onscreen moments. And, of course, his most famous proposal, ‘Go ahead, make my day’, from Sudden Impact has caught on as a catchphrase worldwide. Many of Eastwood’s best ﬁ lms, including The Beguiled, Play Misty for Me, The Bridges of Madison County and Million Dollar Baby, deal with affairs of the heart and obsession. Eastwood’s portrayal of a ﬁ lm director based on John Huston was called White Hunter Black Heart, while in the transplant thriller Blood Work, the heart of the story is the heart itself. In the western A Fistful of Dollars, Eastwood’s ﬁrst starring role, he famously taunted villain Ramon Rojo to, ‘Aim for the heart’, knowing that his iron-plated breastplate would stop Ramon’s bullets. Eastwood the ﬁ lmmaker always aims for the emotional heart of the story, and his talent and craft ensures that the heartbeat of his cinema endures even today.\n\nHoHugh_i-xxxii.indd xvi\n\n6/24/2009 3:38:57 AM\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to thank Philippa Brewster, my editor at I.B.Tauris, for initialising Aim for the Heart, and for her great ideas throughout its writing. Thanks also to Jayne Hill, Paul Davighi and Stuart Weir at I.B.Tauris and to Rohini Krishnan at Newgen Imaging Systems for their hard work on this project. Thanks to Mike Coppack, whose knowledge of ﬁ lms and music has again proved invaluable, especially on modern cinema and its stars. Thanks also to Tom Betts, the editor of Euro-western fanzine Westerns All’Italiana, whose contributions on Eastwood’s westerns, in particular the ‘Dollars’ ﬁ lms and key episodes of the Rawhide TV series, prove again he is one of the most knowledgeable experts on the genre. Thanks also to jazz expert David Weaver, for providing recordings of Charlie ‘Yardbird’ Parker and biographical information on various key jazz players of the bebop scene. Many of the posters and lobby cards have been kindly provided by Ian Caunce, from his collection: most are extremely rare, often from foreign promotional campaigns, and I thank Ian for allowing me to reprint them here. Many of the stills were provided by Kevin Wilkinson from his archive of memorabilia. Like Ian, he’s unearthed some really rare material – thanks for allowing me to print them. The remainder of the stills, posters, novelisation tie-ins and magazine covers are from my own collection. Thanks too to Andy Hanratty, who again worked on the restoration of these images, in particular a creased and faded copy of ABC Film Review from November 1971. He’s done a ﬁne job, as always, and also located rare Eastwood ﬁlm appearances and soundtrack albums. The images of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island, San Francisco Bay, were taken by photographer Sonya-Jayne Stewart – thanks for allowing me to reprint them here. Thanks also to Belinda and Chris Skinner, Christopher Frayling, Alex Cox, Alex and Isabel Coe, Mike Oak and Tracey Mansell, Bob Bell, Philip French, William Connolly, Dave Worrall, Lionel Woodman, Rene Hogguer, Ann Jackson, Paul Duncan, Rhian Coppack, Frankie Holmes, Simon Hawkins, Nicki and John Cosgrove, Roger and Chris Brown, Peter Jones, Gareth Jones, and the staff of Chester Library, in particular the member of staff who managed to track down a rare copy of Thomas Cullinan’s The Beguiled. I must also thank my parents: my mother, Carol, who again helped prooﬁng the manuscripts, and my father, John, who suggested Aim for the Heart as the title for this book. And ﬁnally thank you to Clara, who has helped with the research (particularly on the ﬁ lms based on literary adaptations) and prooﬁng. Without her help, encouragement and support, Aim for the Heart would probably have aimed but missed.\n\nHoHugh_i-xxxii.indd xvii\n\n6/24/2009 3:38:58 AM\n\nUNIVERSAL CASTING: THE EARLY FILMS Clinton Eastwood Jnr was born on 31 May 1930 in Piedmont, California. Until 1940 his family was constantly on the move across California, wherever his father Clinton Snr found work, with Ruth, his mother, looking after Clinton Jnr and his younger sister Jeanne (born on 18 January 1934). Eastwood’s childhood and education were unremarkable, and when he graduated he drifted into various odd jobs – as a lifeguard, in a paper mill and pumping gas. He had no clear idea of what he wanted to do and was eventually drafted into the army for a stint of Military Service in 1950. There he became a lifesaving instructor, rising to the rank of corporal at Ford Ord on the Monterey Peninsular. Released from service in spring 1951, he worked as a lifeguard in Seattle and then moved to Los Angeles to begin college. He was by now courting Margaret Neville Johnson, called Maggie, and they were married on 19 December 1953. He enrolled on a business course at Los Angeles City College, but through friends became interested in acting and eventually ended up on the talent programme at Universal-International, as one of many stars hoping to shine. Eastwood began his ﬁ lm career at Universal-International in April 1954, on a contract that earned him $75 a week. This was at a time when the studio system was breaking down and TV was beginning to affect cinema grosses – there were more channels to ﬁ ll and many more opportunities on TV. But his regular income as a ﬁlm actor at Universal, usually on B-movie science ﬁction ‘creature features’ or westerns, was worth his perseverance. These early ﬁlms offer fans the enjoyable though often frustrating game of ‘Spot the Clint’. Eastwood’s ﬁ lm debut was an uncredited bit part in Jack Arnold’s Revenge of the Creature (1955). It was the ﬁrst of two sequels to the 3-D Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), starring the scaly, ﬁnned deep-sea monster Gill-Man. Eastwood had one scene as a laboratory technician, opposite ichthyologist hero John Agar. Eastwood explains that there should be four rats in the cage, but one seems to have ended up inside a cat. As Agar looks on, Eastwood then puts his hand in his lab coat pocket and discovers the fourth one; ‘How’d he get in there?’ Eastwood asks, bemused. Eastwood’s next ﬁ lm saw him cast opposite Francis the Talking Mule (voiced by Chill Wills) in Arthur Lubin’s Francis in the Navy (1955) as rating Jonesy, one of Donald O’Connor’s sidekicks, in a tale of mistaken identities. O’Connor played both Lieutenant Peter Sterling and ne’re-do-well Slicker Donovan, and Eastwood received $300 a week, for four week’s work. In Lady Godiva (1955 – Lady Godiva of Coventry in the UK), a costume adventure also directed by Arthur Lubin, Eastwood played the minor role of Albert the Fletcher, a Saxon bowman. In his opening scene he offers an excuse for his poor marksmanship (‘The sun was in my eyes’) and is later thrown into a Norman prison. Albert is sprung from jail and becomes a rebel. Decked out in helmet and gauntlets early in the ﬁ lm, Eastwood looks uncomfortable; his later medieval Robin Hood-like outﬁt (shirt and jerkin) suits him much better. Eastwood acquits himself well, wielding a\n\nHoHugh_i-xxxii.indd xix\n\n6/24/2009 3:38:58 AM\n\nxx\n\nAim for the Heart\n\nbroadsword with gusto and even gets to ride into a battle scene, screech to a halt and shout, ‘A column of soldiers approaching!’ though his voice is obviously dubbed by someone else. Jack Arnold’s Tarantula (1955) for Universal-International was one of several ‘giant creatures on the rampage’ ﬁ lms that crawled out in the wake of Them! (1954), a giant ant movie. Eric Jacobs, a biologist, is discovered in the Arizona desert suffering from acromegaly, caused when the ‘pituitary gland goes haywire’. In a secluded laboratory, Professor Deemer (Leo G. Carroll) has been testing his powerful ‘nonorganic food concentrate’, injecting animals with a ‘Nutrient Type 3Y’, resulting in massive and incredible growth spurts in white rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and tarantula. Jacobs, Deemer’s assistant, has injected himself with the serum, inducing acromegaly. Desert Rock doctor Matt Hastings (John Agar) has his suspicions and investigates. During a ﬁre at the laboratory, the tarantula escapes, but continues to grow. Soon it is felling telegraph poles and power pylons, ﬂ ipping pickups and eating cattle, locals and anything else that crosses its path, with the town of Desert Rock next on the menu. As the spider approaches the town, the locals call Sands Air Base for backup. Cue Clint, dispatched as squadron leader of the jet ﬁghters, to deepfry the arachnid with rocket attack and napalm. Eastwood appears in four cockpit shots, heavily disguised with a ﬂying helmet, tilted visor and breathing apparatus, issuing crackly radio orders. He tells his three co-pilots to ‘Fire two rockets on this ﬁrst pass’, then ‘Here goes’, followed by, ‘Dropping napalm, follow in order’ and ﬁ nally, ‘Dump ’em all’, as their cargo incinerates the creature in a ﬁreball inferno. Agar’s love interest is beautiful Mara Corday, as Stephanie ‘Steve’ Clayton; she would later play small roles in four Eastwood ﬁ lms, beginning with The Gauntlet (1977). Leo G. Carroll is excellent as the furtive scientist, who is accidentally injected with the nutrient, resulting in contorted facial disﬁgurement. Shot in the Lucerne Valley, California, near Dead Man’s Point (which features as ‘Devil’s Rock’), Tarantula’s ‘special photography’ effects, staged by Clifford Stine, are way above average, with the lumbering, hairy-legged title-star ominously stalking through barren Arizona. Equally memorable is Deemer’s fantastical lab, with white rats, guinea pigs and rabbits rapidly outgrowing their cages, while the massive tarantula’s legs squeakily scrape at the glass imprisoning it. Tarantula is easily the best, most successful ﬁ lm Eastwood appeared in during his time at Universal. In Never Say Goodbye (1956), Eastwood played laboratory technician Will opposite Rock Hudson, as Dr Michael Parker. In the lab Will tells Parker that there is a phone call for him, wishes Parker ‘good luck’ with a forthcoming speech and is instructed to study some X-rays ‘when they’re dry’. Eastwood uses his own voice here in yet another minor role. Away All Boats (1956), directed by Joseph Pevney, starred Jeff Chandler in a WWII Paciﬁc war drama set aboard an attack transporter, the Belinda. Eastwood appears towards the climax, as a medic who tends wounded Chandler (Eastwood’s voice is dubbed by someone else). Star in the Dust (1956) again headlined versatile John Agar, this time as Sheriff Bill Jordon. A High Noon imitator, Star saw Jordon facing two warring factions, the\n\nHoHugh_i-xxxii.indd xx\n\n6/24/2009 3:38:58 AM\n\nUniversal Casting: The Early Films xxi\n\ncattlemen and the farmers, in the town of Gunlock. The cattlemen have hired professional killer Sam Hall (Richard Boone) to murder any farmers found north of Cofﬁn Creek. Jordon has apprehended Hall and plans to hang him at sundown. The ﬁ lm follows the action from dawn to sunset, as Hall and his allies try to engineer his escape, and Jordon deals with various problems, including his ﬁancée Ellen (Mamie Van Doren). Star was ﬁ lmed over 12 days with Eastwood required for only one of them. His contribution to his ﬁrst western is a single scene. Six minutes into the ﬁlm, Jordon is walking past a team of joiners constructing the gallows, when ranch hand Tom (Eastwood) moseys along and engages the tense sheriff in conversation. Tom says that at the Bella Vista casino, ‘They’re giving 5–3 Hall won’t hang’. ‘8–3’, corrects Jordon. ‘How would you bet, if you were a betting man?’ Tom ventures. ‘Judge Reb ordered Hall hanged at sundown today. That’s when he’ll hang’. ‘If you say so, sheriff’, says Tom, before moseying off the screen, smiling, doing everything possible in this minuscule role to prolong his screen time and get noticed. Eastwood used his own voice here. At key points during Star the ‘Music Man’ (Terry Gilkyson) sings the ‘Ballad of Sam Hall’, which has the same tune, though different lyrics, as the song Eastwood drunkenly sings as Shirley MacLaine removes an arrow from his shoulder in Two Mules for Sister Sara, 14 years later. After six ﬁ lms Universal decided to drop Eastwood’s contract in October 1955. The same studio executive ﬁred Eastwood and his friend and fellow contract player Burt Reynolds on the same day. The exec said that Eastwood had a chipped tooth and his Adam’s apple was too prominent, and told Reynolds that he couldn’t act. Whether this criticism was taken to heart by Eastwood is not known, but in his three spaghetti westerns, his ﬁrst ﬁ lms as a star, he hardly ever smiled so as not to show his teeth and wore a black neckerchief which concealed his Adam’s apple. Now a free agent, Eastwood was cast by Lubin in RKO’s The First Travelling Saleslady (1956). He is billed sixth on the cast list as ‘Featuring Clint Eastwood’. The ﬁ lm stars Ginger Rogers as Rose Gillray, a New York corset designer in dire ﬁnancial straits. She decides that, to strike a blow for the emancipation of women in the America of 1897 and to pay off her debtors, she will become a travelling saleslady for the Carter Steel Company, peddling barbed wire to cattlemen in the Far West. She takes her corset model Molly Wade (Carol Channing) along and the pair fall foul of Joel Kingdom (James Arness), a Texan cattleman who opposes the use of barbed wire. Romance brings young Eastwood onto the scene as Jack Rice, Molly’s intermittent love interest, a lieutenant recruiting for the US Volunteer Cavalry (Roosevelt’s ‘Rough Riders’) in a Kansas City hotel lobby. Molly, on the lookout for a romantic entanglement, catches sight of him and swoons, ‘Do you like girls?’ ‘Yes ma’am, I do’. ‘Well I’m a girl’; ‘You sure are’, says a sheepish Rice. Later Jack gallops into the town of Spur Ridge and frees the Spur Ridge sheriff, then rides to Kingdom’s ranch to save Rose and Molly. He proposes (off-screen) and is present in the courtroom ﬁ nale, affording Eastwood more screen time and a couple of close-ups. Molly and Jack are ﬁ nally glimpsed ﬂeetingly in the dénouement, kissing awkwardly before\n\nHoHugh_i-xxxii.indd xxi\n\n6/24/2009 3:38:58 AM\n\nxxii Aim for the Heart\n\nrunning away together, hand in hand. For this prominent supporting role, Eastwood received $750. Saleslady is a vaudevillian depiction of the west, with extravagant, colourful costumes and an accent on romance. Mae West was the original choice for Rose, but Rogers was eventually cast. This is Broadway star Channing’s ﬁ lm debut. An acquired taste, her barnstorming, giraffe-like showbiz style, goofy face and klutzy double-takes surprisingly provide the ﬁ lm with its most entertaining moments. As Leonard Maltin’s 2001 Movie and Video Guide notes, ‘Carol and Clint make one of the oddest couples in screen history’. As the lanky, tongue-tied lover boy, Eastwood rather overdoes the twitchy ‘gee-shucks’ amiability, but his blinking, grinning performance earned him his ﬁ rst positive review. A Hollywood Reporter article of 28 June 1955 glowed, ‘Clint Eastwood is very attractive as Carol Channing’s beau’. After this early career highlight, Eastwood was back down the bill, playing pilots in Escapade in Japan (1957) and Lafayette Escadrille (1958 – Hell Bent for Glory in the UK). He’s hardly on screen in either effort. In the ﬁrst, another Lubin-helmed feature, he plays a US Air Force rescue squadron pilot codenamed ‘Dumbo One’ who scrambles to save a stricken passenger airliner in the Paciﬁc. His dialogue is brief and to the point: ‘Pilot to radio operator ... let me know as soon as you get ’em in the scope will you?’ and when asked by the airline pilot, ‘Have you got radar lock yet?’, Eastwood answers, ‘No, you’re too far out’, though at least he uses his own voice. In Lafayette, directed by William Wellman, he was George Moseley, a US WWI ace in the French ﬂying squad of the title. For TV showings and video releases of these movies, Eastwood’s name is often shunted up the billing, but in the B-western Ambush at Cimarron Pass (1958), produced by Regal Film and directed by Jodie Copeland for Twentieth Century-Fox, he was the bona ﬁde co-star. Eastwood was billed after Scott Brady and Margia Dean, and received $750 for the eight-day shoot, with location ﬁ lming in the San Fernando Valley. Brady received $25,000. In Ambush at Cimarron Pass, the remains of a 7th Cavalry patrol are riding to Fort Waverly through Apache country, escorting gunrunner Corbin (Baynes Barron) and his stock of 36 Henry repeating riﬂes. The squad consists of scout Henry (William Vaughn), Corporal Schwitzer (Ken Mayer), privates Zach (John Maier), Lasky (Keith Richards) and Nathan (John Merrick), and their commander, tough sergeant Matt Blake (Brady). En route they encounter a party of ex-Confederates, who are driving their cattle from Texas but have been ambushed and have lost their herd. Led by Captain Sam Prescott (Frank Gerstle), they are Johnny Willows (Dirk London), Judge Stanﬁeld (Irving Bacon), Cobb (Desmond Slattery) and Keith Williams (Eastwood). Hothead Williams in particular hates Yankees, following the death of his mother and sister at the hands of the Unionists. Low on food and water, the groups decide to travel together. They are joined by a Mexican woman, Teresa Santos (Margia Dean), the only survivor of a massacre at the Santos Ranch. Things soon worsen when Cobb is tortured and killed, and their horses are run off by Apaches. The party continues on foot. During the trek Williams tangles with Blake and the party gets whittled\n\nHoHugh_i-xxxii.indd xxii\n\n6/24/2009 3:38:59 AM\n\nUniversal Casting: The Early Films xxiii\n\ndown by the ever-stalking Apaches. Reaching Cimarron Pass, they are ambushed by Apache riders and Corbin tries to escape, kniﬁng Judge Stanﬁeld, but is killed by his Apache friends. Blake leads an attack on the Apache camp, stampeding the horses and routing the Indians. Johnny Willows is killed, but the survivors soldier on towards Fort Waverly, until exhausted they can go no further. They burn the guns, which enables them to make it to Waverly. Set in 1867, Ambush is a standard monochrome B-western, more violent than most. Budgetary constraints are obvious, with Copeland unable to afford wranglers and horses for the entire shoot, so the cavalry’s animals are run off early in the story. He was also short of Indians and was going to deploy about 40 warriors, whom he would make to look like 400, but with Brady’s huge fee, the production was crippled. As Eastwood recalled, Copeland amended his plans: ‘I’ll make those four Indians look like 40’. For the ﬁnale at Cimarron Pass they did manage to muster a dozen Apaches on horseback, but for most of the ﬁ lm the warriors appear in twos and threes, dogging the party from afar. The plot helpfully explains this: the Apaches, armed with inferior weaponry, are wary of the new Henry repeaters.

It was so bright during the daylight scenes that, Eastwood remembered, ‘you needed sunglasses to look at the screen’, and that the photography was so dark in the night-time scenes that actors were barely discernible. Cannily, Copeland had his Apaches attack at night. In Ambush, Eastwood was onscreen for almost the entire ﬁ lm – with such a small cast, someone had to be. Fervent Reb Keith Williams is Eastwood’s best cinema performance of the ﬁfties. He has a couple of good lines and handles himself well in the action scenes: a production that couldn’t afford horses certainly couldn’t stretch to stuntmen. Williams also has a mild romantic liaison with Teresa, inviting her back to Texas with him, but she eventually falls for Blake. Most signiﬁcantly, Eastwood is given the curtain line. As the stack of riﬂes burns, the party moans that they’ve lugged them 100 miles for nothing. ‘No, not for nothing’, says Williams, ‘Sometimes you gotta lose before you ﬁnally win’. Despite a dearth of horses and Indians, the ﬁ lm is an entertaining western. On set, Brady, often sporting a heavy hangover, reputedly upset everyone with his foul language. Dirk London as Johnny Willows holds a cigar or cigarette between his teeth for the entire ﬁ lm, something Eastwood perhaps took note of for future reference. All Ambush’s night-time interiors were ﬁlmed on unconvincing studio sets, but the ﬁ lm’s violent action sets it apart from more routine fare. Cobb is tortured to death, gunrunner Corbin is skewered by an Apache war lance, and the party arrives at a waterhole to ﬁnd it poisoned, their scout’s corpse suspended by his feet from poles, his head submerged in the water. The 73-minute ﬁ lm was released on the bottom half of double bills in 1958. Eastwood and Maggie went to watch it and he was aghast, slumping further down in his seat as the ﬁ lm progressed. He viewed it as the nadir of his career: ‘I’m going to quit, I’ve got to start doing something with my life’. The Valentine’s Day 1958 issue of Variety said the ﬁ lm ‘moves rather well within the limitations of its low budget. Brady is sincere in his approach and quite believable in his performance. Fine portrayals also come from Margia Dean, Frank Gerstle, Clint Eastwood and Dirk London’. Often dismissed as a mess – Eastwood himself called it ‘the lousiest western ever made’ – Ambush is nothing of the sort, but it was to be Eastwood’s last ﬁlm appearance for six years.\n\nHoHugh_i-xxxii.indd xxiv\n\n6/24/2009 3:39:00 AM\n\nRIDIN’ EASY: RAWHIDE Between 1956 and 1958, amid scattered ﬁ lm roles, Eastwood also managed to secure some TV work. On Highway Patrol, he was a young, leather-jacketed biker. On Death Valley Days he was John Lucas, a down-on-his-luck gold prospector who receives ‘The Last Letter’ (the episode’s title). He also appeared in West Point (in the skiing episode ‘White Fury’), Navy Log (as Burns in ‘The Lonely Watch’), ABC’s Reader’s Digest (in ‘Greatest of the Apaches’, a biography of Cochise, where he played a US cavalry ofﬁcer) and the ever-popular Wagon Train. Most signiﬁcantly Eastwood had a guest spot in Maverick, in the ‘Duel at Sundown’ episode, again directed by Arthur Lubin. En route to Leadville, ace gambler Bret Maverick (James Garner) arrives in the town of Sundown at the behest of Jed Christiansen (Edgar Buchanan), wheelchair-bound, elderly owner of the Molly-O ranch. Jed wants Bret to court his daughter Carrie (Abby Dalton), who is in love with ne’re-do-well gunslinger Red Hardigan (Eastwood). Hardigan has his eye on the Molly-O and refuses to marry Carrie until Jed has passed away. But Carrie ﬁnds Bret ‘completely resistible’ and uses him to make Red jealous. Red is the best shot in the county; ‘How big a county is this?’ asks Bret nervously. Bret is tracked down by notorious badman John Wesley Hardin (‘Never ﬁgured he’d ﬁnd me way down here’), who has a score to settle with him. To everyone’s amazement, Bret kills Hardin in a duel and then goes gunning for Red: ‘Where’s that other big gunslinger? I might as well take care of him while I’m in the mood’. But cowardly Red is nowhere to be seen, leaving Jed happy and Carrie aware of her beau’s yellow streak. The duel has been a ruse set up by Bret. ‘John Wesley Hardin’ is actually Bret’s brother Bart (Jack Kelly) and Bret gunned him down using blanks. As Bret and Bart leave town, they run into the real John Wesley Hardin, on his way to Sundown looking for revenge. With his key role in Ambush at Cimarron Pass, this is Eastwood’s most promising performance so far. As mean braggart Hardigan, he had plenty of screen time and held his own opposite Garner. Eastwood plays a convincing heavy, smoking a cigar (the ﬁrst time he would do so onscreen), snarling through his teeth and smiling threats to his love rival. He had already mastered his trademark slow, menacing walk and his stance outside the saloon, standing with his three henchmen, ready to pull his gun – a style that had already begun to hint at his cool-but-tough screen persona. In addition to the action-comedy, Eastwood also gets a couple of love scenes, with Carrie and also with his secret lover, Lily (Linda Lawson). In one scene, Carrie sings, ‘Do you remember sweet Betsy from Pike? She crossed the wide prairie with her lover Ike’ (the same song Eastwood drunkenly sings in A Fistful of Dollars). In the episode’s best scene, Doc Baxter (Dan Sherman) demonstrates to Bret what an expert marksman Red is. Outside the Sundown saloon, Doc challenges Red to hit a tin pie plate before it hits the ground. ‘Any time you’re ready, Doc’, says Red, before quick drawing and hitting it four times, sending the plate ﬂying. Later, when Red sees Bret gun down the fake Hardin, he blurts, ‘It was an accident – you can’t fan a gun and hit anything’.\n\nHoHugh_i-xxxii.indd xxv\n\n6/24/2009 3:39:00 AM\n\nxxvi Aim for the Heart\n\nFanning the pistol’s hammer with the palm of his hand was later the preferred style of shooting for ‘The Man with No Name’. Eastwood’s big break came in 1959 when he was cast in the Columbia Broadcasting Systems (CBS) TV series Rawhide. Its creator Charles Marquis Warren had produced CBS’s Gunsmoke for TV, which was one of the ﬁrst ‘adult’ western TV shows launched in 1955 (with ABC’s The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp and Cheyenne). His next idea was a trail drive western series, with two main stars, plus a regular supporting cast, augmented by guest stars. Rawhide was clearly inﬂuenced by Howard Hawks’ cattle drive western Red River (1948), starring John Wayne as the tough trail boss, Montgomery Clift as his young ‘ramrod’ (lieutenant) and Walter Brennan as the irascible old cook. Warren had just directed and executive produced Cattle Empire (1958) for Twentieth Century-Fox. Filmed in CinemaScope in Lone Pine, Empire starred Joel McCrea as John Cord, who, recently released from prison, agrees to trail boss for a blind rancher, herding 5,000 head of cattle from Hamilton to Fort Clemson. Included in the trail crew were Steve Rains and Rocky Shanan (as drovers Paul Corbo and Dan Quince) and Paul Brinegar (as cook Thomas Jefferson Jeffords). The narrative was straightforward, with magniﬁcent landscape shots of the cattle on the move, punctuated with campﬁre scenes ﬁ lmed on studio interiors, a format Warren obviously liked. Rawhide starred Eric Fleming as trail boss Gil Favor, but a younger actor was needed for the role of ramrod Rowdy Yates. Eastwood auditioned for the role and secured it. The ﬁ rst season was budgeted at $4 million, with Eastwood on $750 per episode, while guest stars pocketed $10,000 per appearance. Each episode ran for 48 minutes (an hour with adverts). The title song ‘Rawhide’ was by Dimitri Tiomkin, with lyrics by Ned Washington, the same team behind High Noon’s ‘Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darlin’ It was sung in whoopin’, hollerin’ fashion by Frankie Laine in ﬁ ne whip-cracking style. It proved popular and reached number six in the UK charts in November 1959. In the ﬁ rst episode, an introductory voiceover by Favor explains that the drive is travelling the 1,500 miles from San Antonio, Texas, to the railhead in Sedalia in Missouri. The herd is made up of 3,000 cattle belonging to over 100 owners. This episode established the various characters on the 22-man drover crew. The regular team was Paul Brinegar (from Cattle Empire) as Wishbone the cook and James Murdock as Mushy Mushgrove, his ‘louse’ (assistant). Sheb Wooley appeared as scout Pete Nolan, with Steve Raines and Rocky Shahan as drovers Jim Quince and Joe Scarlet, who ride ‘ﬂank’ and ‘swing’ on the herd. Favor himself rides ‘point’, leading the way. Rawhide was ﬁ lmed on sets at MGM Studios and on location at Nogales, Arizona, where the cattle drive, the riding footage and some of the action sequences were lensed – later episodes were shot in Lone Pine, California. All the night-time camp scenes were shot on studio interiors, as were some of the daytime dialogue scenes, and the switch from outdoors to indoors is readily apparent. Though ﬁlmed in 1958, the pilot and the ﬁrst 22-episode series were shown weekly in the US, from January to July 1959. Season two played from September 1959 to June 1960; Season three from\n\nHoHugh_i-xxxii.indd xxvi\n\n6/24/2009 3:39:00 AM\n\nRidin’ Easy: Rawhide xxvii\n\nSeptember 1960 to June 1961; Season four ran from September 1961 to May 1962; Season ﬁve ran from September 1962 to May 1963; Season six from September 1962 to May 1963; Season seven from September 1964 to May 1965; Season eight from September 1965 until December 1965, with the end of this season made up of reruns until January 1966. With ratings falling for this ﬁnal season, Fleming left the series and Eastwood became trail boss, augmented with some new characters played by John Ireland, Raymond St Jacques and David Watson. Only 13 of the ﬁnal 30 episodes had been ﬁ lmed and Eastwood received $119,000 as compensation. The pilot was ‘Incident of the Tumbleweed Wagon’ (in the UK simply titled ‘Incident of the Tumbleweed’) – most of the episode titles were ‘Incidents’. A heavily fortiﬁed prison wagon camps near the drovers’ bivouac. Its cargo is ‘human dynamite’ – six murderers, deserters and rustlers, and a woman, Dallas (guest star Terry Moore). The criminals manage to attack their escort, killing the deputy and severely injuring the sheriff. Favor and Rowdy decide to help out and take the wagon to Fort Gregg. The journey is hazardous, with Dallas’s husband, machete-wielding outlaw Luke Storm (Val Dufour), and his gang on their trail. Eventually, during a river crossing, the outlaws catch up with them. In a showdown, Luke accidentally kills Dallas before Favor shoots him. This opening episode, actually the ninth ﬁ lmed, set the tone for the series, with the drovers being drawn into someone else’s problem. As Favor puts it, ‘Don’t go around dipping your bread in another man’s bacon grease’. Favor is a man of honour and moral strength, while Rowdy is somewhat inexperienced and naïve. Both learn more about themselves as the series progresses. At the end of each episode, Favor would holler, ‘Head ’em up! Move ’em out’, driving the cattle off onto the next leg of their journey, and the drovers to their next adventure. ‘Incident at Alabaster Plain’ – the second episode, actually the third episode chronologically – provided Eastwood with a key prop that he would use later in his career. This episode introduces Favor’s crew in voiceover during the intro. Of Rowdy, Favor says, ‘New as they come, but he’s got the makings’. At a mission run by Father Fabian (guest star Martin Balsam), Rowdy runs into his old friend Charles ‘Buzz’ Travers (guest star Troy Donahue), who is engaged to the daughter of wealthy rancher Justice Cardin. On the wedding day, Cardin’s step-son gunman Ward Mastic (Mark Richman) returns home after many years and breaks up the party, demanding his share of the ranch. In an argument, he beats Cardin to death with his pistol. Rowdy, Buzz and Favor face Mastic and his gang at the mission, and Mastic is killed when he falls from a bell tower. Mastic is a ﬂashy professional gunﬁghter who owns a Colt .45 decorated with coiled rattlesnakes (in solid silver inlayed in ebony) on the grips. Mastic refers to his weapon as a snake, ‘Oiled and packed in leather and faster than anything you’ll ever see ... it jumps out and bites a man before he knows what hit him’. After the showdown, Rowdy takes Mastic’s pistol for himself, using it in subsequent episodes. Eastwood later used the distinctive snake grips, attached to different pistols, in all three of his Italian westerns with Sergio Leone. Eastwood’s role as Rowdy Yates both helped and hindered his career. He was happy to have regular work and exposure, but he felt typecast. Rowdy was something\n\nHoHugh_i-xxxii.indd xxvii\n\n6/24/2009 3:39:00 AM\n\nxxviii Aim for the Heart\n\nof a one-dimensional character, always ﬁrst in line for chow and with half an eye on the ladies. Eastwood christened him ‘Idiot of the Plains’. As the series progressed, what was most apparent was Eastwood’s complete compatibility with the western setting. What he lacked in dramatic range (which was often the fault of the scripts), Eastwood made up in presence. He was an excellent horseman and was rough and ready in the action sequences. He sported a James Dean-style quiff, and was tall and muscular (he frequently took his shirt off onscreen), which ensured that he soon built up a strong teenage female following. The series was particularly popular in Japan (aired on NET). In March 1962, in addition to doing promotional tours in the US, Fleming, Brinegar and Eastwood travelled to the Far East, where they were mobbed. One strong feature of Rawhide was that the main cast members often had episodes devoted solely to their characters. By far the most interesting episodes are the ones where Rowdy is the focus. These segments, effectively Eastwood solo outings, usually open with Rowdy being sent ahead on an errand. In ‘Incident of the Garden of Eden’, Rowdy is chosen to buy cattle because the crew, ‘can’t stand any more of his jokes’. ‘Incident of the Day of the Dead’ was the ﬁrst episode of the second season in September 1959. Rowdy, dispatched to collect the mail, gets drunk and loses at poker\n\n0.4 Rowdy Yates, Wishbone and Gil Favor take a break on their way to Sedalia; (left to right) Clint Eastwood, Paul Brinegar and Eric Fleming hit the trail to TV fame in Rawhide.

As compensation he must break her wild mustang, ‘La Muerta’, which he fails to do. The unusual plot and its setting, the Mexican ‘Day of the Dead’ festival, make this episode the ﬁrst of several ﬁne showcases for Eastwood. In ‘Incident of the Garden of Eden’ (aired June 1960), Rowdy rides to buy cattle and ﬁnds himself on the ranch of English expat Sir Richard Ashley (Robert Coote) and his daughter Laura Ashley (Debra Paget). Their ranch house is built in the style of a Georgian manor, complete with butler. For dinner Rowdy dresses in formal attire from Bond Street, London, with bow tie and tails, but falls foul of tough foreman Winch (John Ireland – who is in love with Laura) and henchman Crane (Gregory Walcott). This odd episode features an Olde Worlde Englishe Pubbe called the ‘Ox Head Inn’, where innkeeper Harry Wilkes serves ale to his cockney customers Oliver and ‘iggins. In ‘Incident of the Reluctant Bridegroom’ (from November 1962), Rowdy rides into town to buy supplies, but in an extraordinary set of circumstances, he wakes up after a night in the saloon married to Sheila Delancey (Ruta Lee), the feisty Irish lover of town boss John Landy (Arch Johnson); fortunately, the parson who performed the ceremony is outlaw Sam Weber (Ed Nelson) in disguise, so the union is annulled. The November 1961 episode ‘Incident of the Black Sheep’ has become the most famous and sought-after episode of the series. It is the one Sergio Leone viewed as Eastwood’s screen-test for the lead role in A Fistful of Dollars. Richard Baseheart guested as Tod Stone, a sheepherder en route to Twin Hats, to hook up with his ‘Grandpappy’ (Will Wright). During a dispute with the drovers, Stone is injured. Favor assigns Rowdy to take Stone to the nearest town to get patched up. Rowdy suffers prejudice in town when he is mistaken for a ‘sheepman’ and, following a punch-up in a pool hall, ends up in jail. Stone bails him out and each in the course of the journey learns to be more tolerant of the other. When Rowdy learns that the range is infected with anthrax, he warns Stone, an action which could trigger a cattle-sheep war for grazing land. ‘Incident of the Running Man’ was a highpoint in Eastwood’s TV career when screened in May 1961. Rowdy, again sent ahead to buy cattle, is bushwhacked by Deputy Toland (played by Eastwood’s friend Robert Donner), who tells Rowdy of a plot to attack nearby Camp Henley. Outlaws have massacred a troop of cavalry at Feather Canyon and are going to inﬁltrate the post in disguise, wipe out the garrison and sack the territory. But before Toland can verify this story to anyone else, he is shot and Rowdy goes on the run, sought by the outlaws (who know that he’s on to their scheme) and by lawman Sheriff McVey (Robert Wilke). In the nearby town of Rawley, the centre of the conspiracy, Rowdy survives various scrapes. With the help of rancher Maddy (Luana Anders), he is able to tip off the troops, who foil the coup. This tension-ﬁ lled episode has aged very well, with Eastwood the focus of virtually every scene. He rose to the occasion admirably: on the run, he is handcuffed, betrayed, beaten, jailed and hog-tied. He crashes through a window to escape a razor-wielding barber, poses as a mourner at a funeral and hides in an undertaker’s hearse to escape, and by the end of the episode he is bloody and bruised.\n\nHoHugh_i-xxxii.indd xxix\n\n6/24/2009 3:39:02 AM\n\nxxx\n\nAim for the Heart\n\nEastwood’s understated acting was much improved by the 1963–64 season, while Fleming’s had become hammier. For this season, the show’s three stars (Fleming, Eastwood and Brinegar) were immortalised in the titles as proﬁle busts in silhouette. They were recognisable, bona ﬁde TV stars and Eastwood was now earning about $100,000 a season. For the November 1963 episode entitled ‘Incident of the Prophesy’, Eastwood was cast alongside scene-stealing Warren Oates, as drover Charlie Waters, nicknamed ‘Rabbit’, who carries a lucky rabbit’s foot. When a bunch from Favor’s outﬁt ride into a sleepy settlement (‘All this town needs is ﬂowers and a headstone’) and discover the saloon closed, they decide to liven it up with some gunplay. An accidental ricochet kills Judd Horton, the brother of local zealot preacher, Brother William: ‘an apostle of the redemptive spirit’. He curses those he thinks responsible: Rabbit and Rowdy. Several unexplained ‘accidents’ befall Rabbit, after he loses his lucky charm: his horse bolts, a wagon crashes and a cougar attacks him. Rabbit is eventually shot dead (the bullet passing through a Bible in his pocket) – but not before confessing that he went to town to kill Judd deliberately, in revenge for his own wife’s murder. The good cast included Harry Dean Stanton and Dan Duryea, as the eerie, harmonica-playing ‘prophet’. By this point in the series, Eastwood’s close friend and stunt double William ‘Bill’ Thompkins had joined the regular cast, as gummy drover ‘Toothless’. For ‘The Race’, the opening episode of the 1964–65 season, the title sequence was altered again, with the three leads now ‘legends of the west’ bronze sculptures in the style of Frederic Remington – Favor lassos a steer, Rowdy leaps into the saddle and Wishbone lashes the chuck wagon. At Twin Forks, the drovers are exhausted and Favor wants to set off straight away with a herd to Abilene. ‘Get yourself another ramrod – I quit’, decides Rowdy, but soon afterwards he is offered a drive of his own. He takes up the rancher’s offer and recruits his crew, including ramrod Weed (Warren Oates in the third of his four guest starring roles in the series) and Luke (L.Q. Jones). Rowdy even entices Wishbone from Favor’s outﬁt. With typical rash bravado, Rowdy bets that he can beat Favor to the railhead at Abilene and a cattle-driving race ensues. By the end of the episode, Rowdy’s brief tenure as trail boss is over – no longer addressed with a respectful ‘Mister Yates’, he’s ‘Just plain Rowdy’. In ‘The Enormous Fist’, the second episode of the 1964–65 season, one of the guests was Eastwood’s future spaghetti western co-star Lee Van Cleef. Early in the episode, Favor is trying to hire drovers during a drought. Braggart Fred Grant (Van Cleef) wants to be hired (to support his wife and three children) but Favor refuses. During a brawl, Favor punches Grant, who is killed when he bangs his head against a cattle pen. Favor looks after Grant’s wife, Dolly (Brenda Scott), and her children, including vengeful son Adam (Mark Slade, later of TV’s The High Chaparral). Van Cleef also appeared in the next Rawhide episode ‘Piney’ as a completely different character – Deck Somers, a part-Indian, who is employed on a robbery because he has exceptional eyesight and hearing. Ed Begley played Piney, a bank robber who assembles a gang (including Deck) to tunnel into a bank. To escape the gang hides out with the cattle drive (Piney is an old friend of Favor’s), with the loot hidden in a mattress.\n\nHoHugh_i-xxxii.indd xxx\n\n6/24/2009 3:39:02 AM\n\nRidin’ Easy: Rawhide xxxi\n\nAlthough Van Cleef and Eastwood share screen time, unfortunately the future costars, who became spaghetti western icons, never exchange dialogue. In its heyday, Rawhide was a huge ratings winner. When it was ﬁ rst aired in 1959, Gunsmoke was the top-rated TV show, followed by Wagon Train, Have Gun Will Travel and The Riﬂeman. Other western shows in the top 30 included Maverick (No. 6), Tales of Wells Fargo (No. 7), The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp (No. 10), plus Zane Gray Theatre, The Texan, Wanted: Dead or Alive (starring Steve McQueen), Cheyenne, Sugarfoot and The Lawman, with Rawhide bringing up the rear at number 28. For the 1959–60 season, Rawhide rose to 17th place, but by 1960–61, the series’ peak, it was 6th. In 1961–62 it was 13th, in 1962–63, 22nd, until it dropped out of the top 30 altogether. By then the golden age of TV westerns had passed, and it was only Bonanza (1959–73), The High Chaparral (1967–71), The Virginian (1962–1971, later The Man from Shiloh), The Big Valley (1965–69) and Gunsmoke (1955–75) which lasted the sixties. Of the late-ﬁ fties TV western generation, James Garner, Steve McQueen, Burt Reynolds, Charles Bronson and ﬁnally Eastwood made the leap to big screen superstardom. Even by the 1964 season, one thing was apparent: Eastwood was more than ready to carry a star vehicle on his own.\n\nHoHugh_i-xxxii.indd xxxi\n\n6/24/2009 3:39:02 AM\n\nPART ONE\n\nTHE WESTERNS\n\nHoHugh_001-042.indd 1\n\n6/24/2009 3:13:58 AM\n\nHoHugh_001-042.indd 2\n\n6/24/2009 3:13:58 AM\n\nIn the early sixties, western ﬁlms were still locked in a range war for audiences with TV westerns – and losing. What cinema needed was an out-of-towner, a hired gun, a specialist who could turn the tide and entice audiences from their comfy sofas back into theatres, where seats cost money. Their unlikely saviour was an Italian director named Sergio Leone. Hollywood had counterattacked TV in the late ﬁfties with a series of hugely popular, adult-themed big-screen westerns – including The Man from Laramie (1955), The Searchers (1956), The Big Country (1958) and Rio Bravo (1959) – but they were few and far between. By the early sixties some interesting genre one-offs had driven the western into new and interesting territory. Paramount among these was a remake of Akira Kurosawa’s Japanese action drama Seven Samurai (1955) as The Magniﬁcent Seven (1960), which was a massive hit in Italy where the heroes’ mercenary adventures struck a chord.\n\nA Fistful of Dollars (1964) When Sergio Leone cast Clint Eastwood in a trio of westerns, A Fistful of Dollars followed by For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), it gave the genre a much needed fuel-injection of style, wit, violence and grit. The ‘Dollars’ trilogy made Eastwood a stratospheric celebrity climber, from TV star to global success story, and his character ‘The Man with No Name’ who ‘sold lead in exchange for gold’ is still probably the most recognisable gunslinger in cinema. Eastwood’s hero killed with passion, but no compassion, and was a slender moral cut above the villains he dispatched. ‘No Name’ was a loner (like perennial western stalwarts Gary Cooper, Alan Ladd and James Stewart) and had no relationships with women and decidedly untrustworthy ones with men. He was just on the side of ‘law and order’, but only for his own ends – his rewards were a ﬁstful of dollars, a cartload of valuable ‘Wanted’ corpses or a cofﬁn brimming with stolen gold coins. In an era when image was everything, the trappings of ‘The Man with No Name’ – the Mexican poncho, the cheroot cigar, the two-days’ growth of stubble – were as recognisable and marketable as The Beatles’ black suits and mop tops, Barbarella’s skimpy space outﬁts, rafﬁné Holly Golightly’s Givanchy, Tiffany diamonds and cigarette holder, and James Bond’s tux and tie. There have been many different versions of how Eastwood came to be cast in A Fistful of Dollars. The most accepted one is that in the autumn of 1963 a script called ‘Il Magniﬁco Straniero’ (‘The Magniﬁcent Stranger’) arrived at the William Morris Agency, Eastwood’s representatives. Eastwood was hardly the ﬁrst choice for the lead role of ‘Joe the Stranger’ – the list of actors who had already been contacted included Henry Fonda, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Henry Silva, Rory Calhoun and Richard Harrison. The project was to be ﬁnanced by Italian, West German and\n\nHoHugh_001-042.indd 3\n\n6/24/2009 3:13:59 AM\n\n4 Aim for the Heart\n\nSpanish investors and directed by Leone, then known only for ‘sword and sandal’ ﬂicks. The ﬁ lm’s entire budget was only $200,000 and none of the actors approached would accept the $15,000 offered. Eastwood recognised the verbose, thick manuscript, which resembled a telephone directory and ‘wasn’t even typed up in regular script form’, as a rewrite of Yojimbo, a successful 1961 Japanese samurai ﬁ lm directed by Kurosawa, which he’d seen on its American release as Yojimbo – The Bodyguard. Eastwood loved Kurosawa’s action comedy, masterfully shot in black and white Tohoscope, and though not especially keen on the dialogue rewritten in Leone’s adaptation, he accepted the offer and ﬂew to Rome in April 1964, for the $15,000 all-in salary – even though he and Paul Brinegar were making that kind of money in a single engagement as entertainers on the rodeo publicity tours for Rawhide. Interviewed in 1971 for Photoplay, Eastwood recalled, ‘In Rawhide I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I decided it was time to be an anti-hero’. Leone had screened ‘Incident of the Black Sheep’ from Rawhide, some sources claim with an eye on casting Eric Fleming, but this seems unlikely as Fleming hardly ﬁgures in the story. Leone cast Eastwood, though the hero envisioned by Leone was a far cry from Rowdy Yates. Leone’s co-scriptwriter Duccio Tessari had wanted to call the\n\n1.1 Spaghetti Westerns: Bounty hunters ‘The Man With No Name’ and Colonel Douglas Mortimer in For a Few Dollars More (1965); Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef on location in Los Albaricoques, Almeria.

The original script called him ‘Texas Joe’, while the published script (issued in Italy in 1979) calls him Joe, lo Straniero (‘Joe the Stranger’), but all UK/US publicity marketed him as ‘The Man with No Name’. Joe arrives by mule in the Mexican border town of San Miguel, where he discovers from cantina owner Silvanito (Pepe Calvo) that the district is controlled by two rival gangs of bandits and smugglers: the Rojos, who deal bootleg liquor, and the Baxters, big gun merchants. The gangs employ hired gunmen and pay in dollars; in Leone’s original script, both factions were Mexican (the Rojos and the Morales). ‘If you don’t mind doing a little killing, you will have no trouble ﬁnding someone eager to pay you’, Silvanito advises. The stranger sees an opportunity to make a few dollars and exploits the gangs’ rivalry, hiring himself as a gunhand to the Rojos. The Rojos’ leader, Ramon (Gian Maria Volonte), leads a raid on a Mexican army convoy, stealing their shipment of gold, and tries to make peace with the Baxters. But Joe stirs up trouble, taking payment from both factions. Soon the feud is as fervid as ever, with the gangs shooting it out in a cemetery. Joe helps Marisol (Marianne Koch), a woman who has been blackmailed into living with Ramon as his mistress, to escape, but the subterfuge is discovered and the Rojos capture Joe and beat him up. He escapes and the Rojos search the town, massacring the Baxters, burning them out and shooting them down. Whisked out of town by cofﬁn-maker Piripero (Josef Egger), Joe recovers in a disused mine. When Silvanito is caught bringing supplies to Joe and is tortured, the stranger returns to San Miguel for the last time, killing the Rojos in a duel before unhitching the cofﬁn-maker’s mule and riding back into the sierras. When Eastwood arrived in Rome, he brought his Rawhide props (boots, gunbelt, spurs and Cobra-handled Colt), plus a hat, some black drainpipe jeans and a battered sheepskin waistcoat. Leone and costume designer Carlo Simi draped him in a rather unusual addition – a fringed Spanish poncho, essentially a square piece of fabric with a slit for the head, decorated with a series of concentric patterns, including a rope motif, criss-cross lines and geometric Grecian designs. This poncho appears green in some washed-out prints of the ﬁlm and almost black in Italian prints, but it’s actually brown. In the original script, Eastwood’s character, a Confederate sergeant called Ray, steals it from a Mexican peon swimming in the Rio Grande. In Fistful’s duel scenes, the stranger ﬂicks this poncho over his shoulder to quicken his draw. Eastwood also grew a stubbly beard for the role, possibly inspired by Toshiro Mifune, who played Sanjuro Kuwabatake, the unshaven lead in Yojimbo. One key mannerism Eastwood stole from Mifune was his thoughtful chin rubbing. Joe smokes cheroots throughout, even though Eastwood was in reality a non-smoker and the cigar is rarely lit. It is as Joe that he perfected the Clint squint, reputedly caused by the strong Spanish sunlight. The stranger’s costume, props and mean demeanour fashioned Eastwood’s screen image, which he honed into what became known by critics and fans as spaghetti westerns, Euro-westerns, macaroni westerns, pizza westerns or Western All’Italiana (‘Westerns, Italian-style’). After years of being told that he looked ‘wrong’ for starring roles, that he was too tall, too ungainly, that he didn’t look like the popular stars of the day, or that he squinted too much, he found that in this new style western he was the look.\n\nHoHugh_001-042.indd 5\n\n6/24/2009 3:13:59 AM\n\n6 Aim for the Heart\n\nLeone shot Fistful in Italy and Spain. The budget didn’t allow much room for luxury and Eastwood even brought along his own stunt double – Bill Thompkins from Rawhide. It is Thompkins as Joe who gallops through the desert in the nighttime riding sequences; he also plays the Baxter gunman in the green shirt during the hostage exchange. San Miguel was ﬁ lmed in ‘Golden City’, a western set at Hojo De Manzanares (north of Madrid) and the adobe village of Los Albaricoques in Almeria, southern Spain. The interiors of Rojo’s residence and its whitewashed walled courtyard were Casa Da Campo, a Madrid museum. The small adobe house where Marisol is imprisoned, currently a hotel called Cortijo El Sotillo, is near San Jose in Almeria, while the Rio Bravo gold ambush was ﬁ lmed on the River Alberche at Aldea Del Fresno. Filming commenced on Rome interiors in April at Cinecitta studios, moved to Hojo De Manzanares and its environs (for the graveyard shootout and the town scenes) and then wrapped in the Almerian desert. A notable aspect of Fistful is the severe bloody beating Joe the Stranger suffers at the hands of the Rojos in their wine cellar, probably the worst onscreen pummelling Eastwood has taken in his entire career. As Eastwood remembered, ‘In the ‘Dollars’ ﬁ lms, stoic was the word. It was comedy and yet it was played dead straight. The violence tag was hung too tightly around my neck. The fact that they were made by an Italian in Europe had some people going in as edgy as I was when I made them. I personally don’t think of them as violent, only perhaps as black humour’. In Fistful, Joe is so badly injured (one eye is almost closed) and immobilised that the cofﬁn maker has to sneak him out of town in a casket. This rough treatment reappeared in many of Eastwood’s later ﬁ lms and his heroes have had to recover quickly to defeat the villain: a symbolic ‘resurrection’. Fistful contains two quintessential action moments in Eastwood’s transformation from clean-cut TV western hero to screen idol. In the ﬁrst, he guns down four Baxter gunmen hanging around the San Miguel corral, for $100 in Rojo blood money. Having already spooked Joe’s mule as a warning, the quartet tells him to leave town. The gang ﬁnd their threats amusing, but the stranger doesn’t: ‘My mule don’t like people laughing, gets the crazy idea you’re laughing at him’. His mood suddenly changes, from amiable cowboy kidding around to lethal killer demanding an apology. Joe ﬂicks his poncho over his shoulder and the tension mounts, until in a ﬂash, guns blaze and four Baxters bite the dust. Having ordered three cofﬁns before the confrontation, Joe corrects his order: ‘My mistake ... four cofﬁns’. The Saturday Review scathingly noted that ‘Eastwood ... makes full use of his one expression’, but the actor’s underplayed performance and his delivery marked Eastwood as a new type of action movie star, one for whom understatement and stoicism were trademarks. In the ﬁ lm’s ﬁnale, Joe faces Ramon and four of his men in the plaza of San Miguel, near a water tower. The stranger announces his return with two dynamite explosions, which wreath the street in dust, unnerving his opponents: it’s a powerful image, with the stranger striding out of the dust cloud. Earlier Ramon has quoted a Mexican proverb to the stranger, claiming that a Colt .45 is inferior to a Winchester riﬂe. We already know from Ramon’s demonstrations of marksmanship that he\n\nHoHugh_001-042.indd 6\n\n6/24/2009 3:13:59 AM\n\nPart One: The Westerns\n\n7\n\nalways aims for the heart. ‘Shoot to kill, you better hit the heart’, goads the stranger, ‘The heart Ramon, aim for the heart, or you’ll never stop me’. Ramon ﬁres at Joe repeatedly, hitting him, but each time the stranger gets back to his feet, seemingly supernatural. Eventually, when he’s within pistol range, Joe reveals that he’s been wearing a sheet of iron strapped to his chest, an armour hidden under his poncho, and there are seven bullet dents in the area of his heart. Real-life professional killer and lawman Jim Miller, known variously as ‘Killin’ Jim’ and ‘The Deacon’, wore a breastplate during his gunﬁghts. One of the most deadly, not to say indestructible shootists, Killin’ Jim survived 14 gun battles. Fistful’s memorable score was composed by Ennio Morricone, a school friend of Leone’s. The main theme (or ‘titoli’) deployed acoustic guitar, bells and whip-cracks backing the melody, voiced by a whistler and an electric guitar (both performed by Alessandro Alessandroni), while I Cantori Moderni (‘The Modern Singers’) supplied harmonies. This accompanied the pop-art title sequence, deploying rotoscope, an animation process that converts action from the ﬁ lm into garish, comic-strip violence. The titles begin with hypnotic smoke rings, which reveal the galloping hero and ricocheting gunshots herald Eastwood’s name onscreen. Elsewhere Morricone used the ominous piano and harmonica of ‘Almost Dead’ (for the stranger’s arrival in town), the cacophonous percussion and trumpet of ‘The Chase’, the eerie build-up to ‘Without Pity’ (for the Baxter massacre), and the Mexican trumpet ‘Deguello’, a funereal Mariachi backed by strings and chorus. Entitled ‘A Fistful of Dollars’ on soundtrack albums, this was released by RCA as a 45rpm single under the title ‘The Man with No Name’. This music and that of Eastwood’s later spaghetti westerns were inexorably linked to the actor throughout his career. They became Eastwood’s ‘theme tunes’ and his later ﬁ lms occasionally deployed Morricone-style musical cues as knowing references to his career as ‘The Man with No Name’. Fistful was released in Italy as Per Un Pugno di Dollari (‘For a Fistful of Dollars’) in September 1964, to great word-of-mouth success, eventually becoming the biggestgrossing Italian ﬁlm of all time up to that point. Italian posters for its premiere trumpeted ‘The most recent and sensational western ﬁlm with the new American idol’. For international release, United Artists dubbed the ﬁlm A Fistful of Dollars (shortened in the animated title sequence to simply Fistful of Dollars) and prepared a high-proﬁle publicity campaign ahead of the opening in the US in January 1967. Key art featured Eastwood in his poncho, with the taglines ‘He’s going to trigger a whole new style in adventure’, ‘In his own way he is perhaps the most dangerous man who ever lived!’ and ‘The ﬁrst motion picture of its kind. It won’t be the last!’ Fistful was rated ‘M’ in the US and ‘X’ in the UK, even after it was trimmed for violence; subsequent DVD releases, rated ‘15’, are uncut. In the US, Fistful took $4.25 million in 1967 and eventually grossed $14.5 million. Many Italian and Spanish westerns of the sixties and early seventies capitalised on the success of Leone’s ﬁlm, with derivative titles and ponchoclad heroes, including ‘Vance Lewis’/Luigi Vanzi’s For a Dollar in the Teeth (1966 – aka A Stranger in Town), starring Tony Anthony as the stranger and Frank Wolff (Leone’s original choice for Ramon Rojo) as bandit leader Aguila (‘The Eagle’). Eastwood made\n\nHoHugh_001-042.indd 7\n\n6/24/2009 3:14:00 AM\n\n8 Aim for the Heart\n\nbetter ﬁlms and he also made much more money, but A Fistful of Dollars facilitated his leap from TV fame to international superstardom. When, in December 1980, the Museum of Modern Art paid tribute to Eastwood with a one-day retrospective of his ﬁlms, the works chosen were Escape from Alcatraz, Play Misty for Me, Bronco Billy and A Fistful of Dollars.\n\nFor a Few Dollars More (1965) Fistful certainly wasn’t the last motion picture of its kind and Eastwood was soon back in Italy and Spain ﬁlming a sequel, literally For a Few Dollars More – his salary this time was $50,000. As ‘the anti-hero to end all anti-heroes’ (as Films and Filming christened him), Eastwood was again a gunﬁghter, now a bounty hunter named Manco. The story was based on an original outline by Leone and his brother-in-law Fulvio Morsella, with a screenplay by Leone, Luciano Vincenzoni and an uncredited Sergio Donati. Manco and Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) are two deadly bounty killers, ridding the American southwest of renegade outlaws and cashing in their rewards. When the territory’s most notorious criminal El Indio (Gian Maria Volonte) escapes from prison, the pair teams up to scoop the $10,000 reward offered ‘Dead or Alive’. Indio and his cadre of bandidos target the three-ton safe in El Paso, a supposedly impregnable fortress containing almost a million dollars. Working to Mortimer’s stratagem, ‘one from the outside, one from the inside’, Manco inﬁltrates Indio’s gang and tries to sabotage their plan, but Indio is smarter and the gang ﬂees with the loot. The robbers lie low in Agua Caliente, a New Mexican pueblo, where Mortimer also joins the gang and carefully opens the safe without destroying the cash. The bounty killers steal the money and hide it, before being caught and viciously beaten by Indio. Indio releases the gringo gunmen and sets them against his gang in a gun battle, but soon only Indio is left alive, and in a ﬁnal duel, Mortimer faces Indio and kills him. The colonel reveals that Indio raped his sister, who then killed herself, and that Mortimer has been seeking vengeance ever since. His vendetta complete, the colonel allows Manco to keep the reward. This time Leone had a larger budget than Fistful – $600,000. Leone visited the US in January 1965, re-signing Eastwood (for $50,000), and also hired Lee Van Cleef (for $17,000). Van Cleef was a supporting actor from ﬁfties western, sci-ﬁ and gangster movies; he had guested in two episodes of the 1964–65 season of Rawhide but was currently employed as a freelance artist. Leone wanted Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson or Lee Marvin as his colonel, but their unavailability led to Van Cleef’s casting – Leone noted: ‘His glare makes holes in the screen’. Eastwood received top billing, as the star who would ensure the ﬁ lm’s success, even though ex-soldier Colonel Mortimer, ‘the best shot in the Carolinas’, was the focus for much of the story. Leone again ﬁ lmed the interiors at Cinecitta but lensed the majority in Spain: partly near Madrid, but mostly in Almeria, with Eastwood present at most locations. The desolate Spanish deserts, sierras and ramblas (dried-up riverbed canyons) took centre stage, as a memorable and breathtaking backdrop. The great riding scenes,\n\nHoHugh_001-042.indd 8\n\n6/24/2009 3:14:00 AM\n\nPart One: The Westerns\n\n9\n\nﬁ lmed in the Almerian sierras, where Manco loses a posse from El Paso, display Eastwood’s consummate horsemanship to best advantage; Bill Thomkins didn’t double for Eastwood in this sequel. The towns depicted were ‘played’ by a variety of ﬁ lm sets. White Rocks was a set at Colmenar Viejo, near Madrid; Tucumcari was the San Miguel set at Hojo De Manzanares; a western set at Cinecitta appeared as ‘Santa Cruz’. El Paso, the focus for the middle section of the ﬁ lm, was designed and built in grand style by Carlo Simi (who was also the ﬁ lm’s costumier) in the desert near Tabernas, Almeria. The whitewashed Spanish village of Los Albaricoques (named ‘The Apricots’, after its fruit trees) was Agua Caliente, the isolated pueblo which is the setting for the ﬁ lm’s last 45 minutes. The ruined, rooﬂess Church of Santa Maria at Turillas was used for Indio’s hideout when he breaks out of prison. Las Palmeras, where Manco rendezvous with Indio after the robbery, was El Oasis, a patch of desert with clumps of palm trees, which had been planted during Lawrence of Arabia (1962). El Paso still stands in Spain. Now called ‘Mini Hollywood’, it attracts sunburnt tourists to its ‘Wild West’ show re-enactments. The script, which Eastwood and Van Cleef pruned, was tighter than Fistful and Leone’s visual style began to ﬂourish. This is illustrated by Manco’s ﬁrst appearance in the ﬁ lm. Colonel Mortimer asks the Tucumcari sheriff if he knows the whereabouts of outlaw Red ‘Baby’ Cavanagh. The lawman answers that a stranger stopped by, also asking after Red. ‘I’ve never seen him before’, says the sheriff of the stranger, ‘His name is Manco’. Leone cuts to a close-up of Eastwood’s trademark rattlesnake gripped pistol, fringed poncho and a leather gauntlet he wears on his gun hand (accompanied by a crash of thunder on the soundtrack), as Eastwood stalks past the camera into White Rocks in the lashing rain. When Eastwood reaches the saloon, he ﬂicks back his poncho, takes a match from his breast pocket and lights a cheroot, as he slowly raises his head – his face has been obscured by the brim of his hat – and reveals his face for the ﬁrst time (as a thunderclap crashes on the soundtrack). In For a Few, Eastwood’s hero is more humorous, he even smiles occasionally, and has a great ﬁnal punchline. As he loads the bandits’ corpses into a cart to take back to El Paso, his bounty haul calculations fall short of expectations and he realises he’s one villain short. At that moment Manco spins around and shoots outlaw Groggy, who is about to plug him in the back. At the sound of gunﬁre the colonel shouts, ‘Any trouble boy?’; ‘No old man’, answers Manco, ‘Thought I was having trouble with my adding – it’s all right now’. It is Van Cleef’s Colonel Mortimer, the Bible-reading ‘Reverend’, and his tracking of Indio, that drives the ﬁ lm. His vendetta is symbolised by the pair of gold pocket watches (a larger male and smaller female version of the design) in a heartshaped box. Mortimer’s revenge ends the ﬁ lm satisfyingly, with the bandito and ‘Il Colonnello’ facing each other in a broken ring, marked by a low, crumbling wall and quarried stones – a dusty circle of destiny. Manco, armed with Indio’s Volcanic calibre .38 carbine, referees this ﬁnal confrontation, with the moment the two men draw decided by the carillon of Mortimer’s watch – the chiming countdown to life and death.\n\nHoHugh_001-042.indd 9\n\n6/24/2009 3:14:00 AM\n\n10\n\nAim for the Heart\n\nEnnio Morricone once again provided the distinctive score, with a main theme deploying Jew’s harp, ﬂute, whistling, chorus and electric guitars – a ‘riding theme’ powered along by pounding hoofbeat drums. For duels Morricone created ‘La Resa Dei Conti’ (‘The Settling of Accounts’, also called ‘Sixty Seconds to What?’ or ‘Paying off Scores’), with its tinkling watch melody, reverberating Flamenco guitar, blasts of church organ and trumpet: a vocal version was recorded by Maurizio Graf entitled ‘An Eye for an Eye’ but wasn’t used in the ﬁ lm. Eerie feedback scores Indio’s gang casing the adobe bank in ‘The Watcher Watched’, while the side-drums, piano, brass and tolling bell of ‘Il Colpo’ (‘The Raid’) accompany them emptying the safe. The delicate guitar and oboe of ‘Vice of Killing’ bursts into life with galloping snare drums and a heavenly, wordless vocal, as Indio’s band speed across the desert with their lootladen wagon, and as Manco rides alone into unwelcoming Agua Caliente. ‘Goodbye Colonel’ (sometimes billed as ‘Addio Colonnello’ or ‘Bye Bye Colonel’), with lyrical oboe, strings, carillon and chorus, scored Mortimer’s slow ride into the sunset. For a Few Dollars More was released in Italy as Per Qualche Dollaro in Piu in December 1965, to massive and inﬂuential success: there was even a parody of the ﬁ lm called For a Few Dollars Less (1966). For a Few Dollars More was released in the US rated ‘M’ (later ‘R’) four months after Fistful, to even greater success, initially taking $5 million. Posters featuring Eastwood (‘The Man With No Name Is Back’) and Van Cleef (‘The Man In Black Is Waiting’) warned, ‘As if one wasn’t enough ... as if death needed a double. It’s the second motion picture of its kind! It won’t be the last’. The UK trailer introduced Volonte and Eastwood as ‘the men who excited you so in For a Fistful of Dollars’. The superior US trailer, one of Eastwood’s best promos, touted: ‘Clint Eastwood is The Man with No Name ... Lee Van Cleef is Waiting’. The UK print cut violence, garnering an ‘X’ certiﬁcate, removing, among others, the ﬁnal explanatory ﬂashback depicting Mortimer’s sister’s suicide. Even Indio’s mad cackling laugh was shortened for US/UK prints, so demonic was his villainy. Critically reviled at the time, For a Few Dollars More is one of the most ﬁnancially proﬁtable Italian westerns ever made, with Eastwood now dubbed ‘Il Cigarillo’ by his Italian fans.\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) Eastwood’s next project with Leone, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, would today be called a ‘threequel’, although in chronological relation to the ﬁrst two ﬁ lms it’s a prequel. In early 1862, Confederate forces led by General Sibley invaded New Mexico from Texas. Amid the confusion, as the war engulfs the Rio Grande, three men have something else on their minds: hired gun Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), Mexican outlaw Tuco Ramirez (Eli Wallach) and his partner, shifty drifter Blondy (Eastwood), are searching for a cashbox containing $200,000 in gold coin buried in a grave marked ‘Arch Stanton’ in Sad Hill. It is missing following a Union surprise attack on a Confederate payroll wagon destined for the 3rd Cavalry. In Sad Hill, the trio confront each other: Blondy kills Angel Eyes and splits the cash with Tuco, leaving his partner stranded in the middle of nowhere with his hands bound, but $100,000 richer.\n\nHoHugh_001-042.indd 10\n\n6/24/2009 3:14:00 AM\n\nPart One: The Westerns\n\n11\n\n1.2 ‘The Man With No Name is Back!’: original poster for the 1967 US release of Sergio Leone’s For a Few Dollars More (1965). Author’s collection.\n\nHoHugh_001-042.indd 11\n\n6/24/2009 3:14:00 AM\n\n12\n\nAim for the Heart\n\nOne scene in For a Few Dollars More hints at the central three-way deception of The Good. Following the El Paso bank raid, Mortimer and Manco agree to convince Indio to head north, so they can ambush him in Rio Bravo Canyon, but duplicitous Manco suggests to Indio they head south, to the Mexican border. Indio, equally suspicious, rides east, to Agua Caliente, but miraculously Mortimer out-guesses them and arrives there ﬁrst, telling Manco: ‘I just reasoned it out’. The Colonel knew that Manco would ignore their plan and that Indio would second-guess them – ‘Since El Paso’s out of the question, well here I am’. This elaborate web of trickery and doublecross became the skeletal plot of Leone’s third western. The epic story was written by Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. Sergio Donati and Age-Scarpelli also worked on the screenplay, which was then translated into English by Mickey Knox. Again working with producer Albert Grimaldi of PEA, Leone had a budget of $1.2 million. This time Eastwood drove a hard bargain: for his role as Blondy ‘The Good’, he received a quarter of a million dollars (more than the amount the ﬁ lm’s cashbox contains), noting, ‘I’m probably the highestpaid American actor who ever worked in Italian pictures. Only Mastroianni gets more in Italy. For the ﬁ rst time in my life, I can pick the parts I want to play’. Lee Van Cleef returned to villainy, with his role as Angel Eyes ‘The Bad’. Originally called Banjo in the script, then Sentenza during shooting, his name became Angel Eyes during the English dubbing. Eli Wallach, an outlaw in The Magniﬁcent Seven (1960) and How the West Was Won (1962), played Tuco ‘The Ugly’. The remainder of the cast was a rogue’s gallery of actors – good, bad and ugly – to play the assorted rufﬁans and trail trash the heroes encounter. Italian Aldo Giuffre played drunken Unionist captain Clinton who dreams of blowing to smithereens a bridge he’s been ordered to take intact. Antonio Molino Rojo portrayed a prison camp commandant with a gangrenous leg, similarly disillusioned with the Union cause. Luigi Pistilli played Tuco’s brother, Brother Pablo, a monk tending wounded soldiers at his San Antonio Mission. Mario Brega appeared as brutal Unionist corporal Wallace, at his happiest beating seven shades of grey out of Confederate prisoners of war. Canadian Al Mulock played a one-armed bounty hunter who traps Tuco in a bubble bath but crows too long: ‘If you have to shoot – shoot, don’t talk’, Tuco tells his corpse. Filming took place between May and July of 1966. That Spanish spring and summer was perfect weather, with solid-blue skies and smoky cloud formations. Interiors were ﬁlmed at Elios Studios. Elios’ western set was also where the town of Mesilla was ﬁlmed, for Tuco’s ﬁrst escape from hanging. His second escape, in Valverde, was shot at the ‘El Paso’ set in Almeria. The same set was also used for the scene where Tuco robs a gunsmith, when Angel Eyes questions a prostitute in Santa Ana, and when Sibley’s Confederate column retreats through Santa Fe. Other New Mexican locations – the Sierra Magdalena and the Sangre De Cristo (‘Blood of Christ’) Mountains, and whitewashed dusty pueblos, ghost towns and farms – were ﬁlmed in Almeria. The notorious 90-mile desert, the Jornado Del Muerto (the ‘Day’s Journey of the Dead Man’), where Tuco tortures blistered Blondy, was ﬁ lmed at Cabo De Gata. The Union railway depot\n\nHoHugh_001-042.indd 12\n\n6/24/2009 3:14:01 AM\n\nPart One: The Westerns\n\n13\n\n1.3 ‘Sorry Shorty’: Tuco the Ugly gets the drop on Blondy in the desert; Clint Eastwood in the Spanish dunes for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). Author’s collection.\n\nwas La Calahorra Station (on the Almeria-Guadix line) and the San Antonio Mission was Cortijo De Los Frailes (‘House of the Brothers’); the mission’s interior was ﬁlmed at the Monastery of San Pedro de Arlanza, north of Madrid. Battle-torn Peralta was ﬁlmed at Colmenar Viejo’s western set near Madrid. The scene where Blondy and Tuco ﬁrst meet was lensed at rocky Manzanares El Real, further north. Most of the Civil War scenes were shot between Madrid and Burgos, in Castilla-León. The entrenched battle between the blue and the grey raged at Covarrubias, on the River Arlanza. Betterville prison camp was built at Carazo and Sad Hill’s amphitheatre of the dead, ringed with concentric circles of tombs, was also south of the Arlanza, at Contreras. All three locations were less than 20 kilometres apart, with the prison camp location actually just over the mesa behind Angel Eyes during the ﬁnal showdown. Leone’s anti-heroic depiction of the American Civil War ﬁ lled his towns with refugees and troops, while the military hospitals are packed with the bloodied wounded. Outside Valverde’s ‘Ballroom Music Hall’, Angel Eyes questions a Confederate cavalryman who has lost both his legs, calling him a ‘Half Soldier’. Betterville Prison Camp had its origins in terrible Federal stockades such as Camp Douglas, Chicago, which lost almost 10 percent of its 3,880 inmates in a single month to dreadful conditions and disease. The ﬁ lm’s battle scenes deployed hundreds of extras (played by Spanish soldiers in Civil War period costume) and heavy-duty artillery, including Gatling Guns, Parrott Guns and mortars. The entrenched defence works at Langstone Bridge were also based on archive photos, depicting tiered wicker and sandbagged breastworks, riﬂe pits, bomb-proof shelters, gun emplacements and the spiky criss-crossed log defences (an anti-cavalry barricade known as ‘chevaux-de-frise’). Costume\n\nHoHugh_001-042.indd 13\n\n6/24/2009 3:14:01 AM\n\n14\n\nAim for the Heart\n\ndesigner Carlo Simi included such details as the Confederate soldiers wearing colourcoded kepis (caps), collars and cuffs, denoting their branch of service: yellow for cavalry, blue for infantry and red for artillery. Leone loved the ﬁlm’s ‘big scope’; ‘And I liked it, I must say’, remembered Eastwood, ‘Especially coming from television where you didn’t have the opportunity to do that’. As Leone boasted, ‘This picture is more accurate than any American western’. Eastwood’s drifting nowhere man is a nomadic con man christened ‘Blondy’ by Tuco. The Italian print dubs him ‘Biondo’ (after Eastwood’s fair complexion) while the ﬁ lm’s novelisation has Mexican Tuco calling him ‘Whitey’. His business partnership with Tuco – where he turns the wanted outlaw over to the law and then saves him by shooting through the hanging rope during the execution – provides much humour, as neither trusts the other. Blondy tires of their partnership, reasoning that Tuco will never be worth more than $3,000: ‘There’s really not too much future with a sawn-off runt like you’. Eventually he cuts loose of Tuco in the desert, 70 miles from Valverde: ‘I’ll keep the money and you can have the rope’. In his third Leone outing, Eastwood’s performance is conﬁdent and effortless. He deploys his full range of ‘Man with No Name’ mannerisms: the double takes, the squint, mouthing the cigar, the deadpan asides, the long silences and the empty half-smile. Blondy uses a Colt Navy pistol, again ﬁtted with snake grips, and a Henry repeating riﬂe with a telescopic sight. This time there is more humility and humanity to Eastwood’s gunman. Blondy offers a dying Confederate artilleryman a last drag on his cigar. Before Blondy detonates Langstone Bridge, he tells a badly wounded Union ofﬁcer, ‘Take a slug of this capt’n ... keep your ears open’. In one unusual scene, Blondy bides his time in war-torn Peralta by playing with a kitten in his hat. Such compassion, almost tenderness, would be rare in Eastwood’s westerns, even in mature works such as The Outlaw Josey Wales and Unforgiven. During the Battle of Langstone Bridge, as the Union and Confederate forces suicidally attack the bridge under heavy artillery ﬁre, he watches and mutters, ‘I’ve never seen so many men wasted so badly’. But Blondy loots his trademark poncho from the dead Confederate artilleryman and becomes ‘The Man with No Name’ for the ﬁnal duel. Morricone’s most famous composition, the ﬁ lm’s title music, is cut to an equally memorable title sequence, with colourful tinted stills from the ﬁlm, explosions and dust. The main theme, a coyote-howling, guitar-twanging, bugle charge, is one of the most famous western themes of all time – its ‘Ay-ey-ay-ey-ahhh!’ answered ‘Wahwah-wah!’ instantly recognisable. Elsewhere, mournful tunes – ‘The Fort’, ‘Marcetta’, ‘March without Hope’ and the ballad ‘The Soldier’s Story’ – score the Civil War devastation. The epic ‘The Desert’ accompanies Blondy’s bubbled agony in the dunes and in ‘Ecstasy of Gold’, the rolling piano and Edda Dell’Orso’s soprano solo soar as Tuco frantically scours Sad Hill. With epic battles and scores of extras, it is ironic that the ﬁnale involves only the three antagonists competing for the prize – the contents of the grave marked ‘Unknown’, the tomb with no name, next to Arch Stanton’s, which contains a cashbox. It is one of the most memorable endings to a western and a ﬁtting climax to the ‘Dollars’ trilogy, as the Good, the Bad and the Ugly shoot it out in\n\nHoHugh_001-042.indd 14\n\n6/24/2009 3:14:02 AM\n\nPart One: The Westerns\n\n15\n\nthe epicentre of the vast graveyard, with Morricone’s music ‘Il Triello’ (‘The Trio’) thundering on the soundtrack. For its US release, United Artists considered several different titles for the ﬁ lm – The Good, the Ugly, the Bad (a literal translation of the original Italian title, Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo), River of Dollars (a translation of Un Fiume Di Dollari, the Italian title of a spaghetti western released in the US by UA as The Hills Run Red) and even The Man With No Name – before settling on The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Cynical posters announced: ‘For Three Men the Civil War Wasn’t Hell ... It was Practice’ and ‘This time the jackpot’s a cool $200,000’. In equal parts impressive and incompetent, the eventful, epic trailer intoned, ‘The Good, the Bad, the Ugly ... the blue, the grey, the Civil War ... the questions, the answers, the showdown ... the reason? The gold!’ The US trailer misidentiﬁed Tuco as ‘The Bad’ and Angel Eyes as ‘The Ugly’, which saddled Van Cleef with the epithet ‘Mr Ugly’ for his subsequent spaghetti westerns. Critics were divided on the merits of Leone’s third western. On 25 January 1968, the New York Times, who called it ‘The Burn, the Gouge and the Mangle (the screen name is simply inappropriate)’, said that it ‘must be the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre’. Variety noted, ‘A curious amalgam of the visually striking, the dramatically feeble and the offensively sadistic’. But most critics agreed that Leone was a talented director with an eye for detail and action. Next to Wallach, Eastwood and Van Cleef were deemed ‘expressionless characters with poker faces’ as animated as ‘a slab of boot leather’. It ran 161 minutes in the US (rated ‘M’, later ‘R’); in the UK, it was cut to 148 minutes (rated ‘X’). The original Italian version, which premiered over Christmas 1966, was 171 minutes long and included several extra scenes. In 2003, Eastwood and Wallach, plus Simon Prescott, a Van Cleef voice impersonator (Van Cleef died in 1989), dubbed the missing Italian scenes into English, but in this version the gunshots, cannon ﬁre, explosions and sound effects were altered. The Italian version, which runs 169 minutes on video and has correct sound effects, is the deﬁnitive version of the ﬁ lm, while the best English language version runs 156 minutes, still rated ‘18’ on DVD. A paperback tie-in of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly written by Joe Millard was published in 1967. In this version, Tuco doesn’t take part in the ﬁnal duel and Angel Eyes (or Sentenza, as he’s known in the book) carries a custom-made pistol with a 14-inch barrel, like Colonel Mortimer. A cover version of Morricone’s theme, rearranged and conducted by Hugo Montenegro, was released by RCA Victor on both sides of the Atlantic in 1968 – backed by ‘There’s Got to Be a Better Way’ from Bandolero! (1968) in the UK and ‘March without Hope’ in the US. It went to number one in the UK in November 1968 and peaked at number two in the US. Its success contributed to the ﬁlm’s massive grosses – in the US alone it took over $6 million, putting it inside the 10 most successful westerns of the sixties. In Italy ‘new releases’ El Maladetto Gringo, Il Magniﬁco Straniero and El Gringhero welded together Rawhide episodes (‘Incident of the Running Man’ and ‘The Backshooter’), until an injunction gunned them down. The ‘Dollars’ ﬁ lms’ success in Italy led to the ‘spaghetti western’ craze, which produced hundreds of ﬁ lms\n\nHoHugh_001-042.indd 15\n\n6/24/2009 3:14:02 AM\n\n16\n\nAim for the Heart\n\nin the next ten years and revitalised, some would say saved, the Italian ﬁ lm industry. Following The Good, Eastwood and Leone didn’t see each other for years, as their careers diverged on different projects – Eastwood was offered a guest star role in Leone’s next ﬁ lm, Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), as one of the killers waiting for Charles Bronson in the ﬁ lm’s opening scene, but he declined. When Leone was in the US in the early eighties making Once Upon a Time in America, Eastwood visited him at his hotel. ‘I’ve often been asked if I could make another ﬁ lm with him’, said Leone, ‘I always refuse. It is impossible’. They could never have surpassed the Dollars trilogy, especially The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, their masterpiece.\n\nHang ’Em High (1968) Following his success as the ‘Man with No Name’, Eastwood said ‘Arrivederci Roma’ and returned to the US, had a shave and gained a name, as Jed Cooper in Hang ’Em High, which straddled the badlands between spaghetti and Hollywood westerns. Eastwood was initially approached to star in the Hollywood western Mackenna’s Gold (1968), but he turned it down and Gregory Peck eventually took the treasure-hunting role – an adventurer seeking fabled Apache gold in the Canyon Del’Oro. Shot partly in Monument Valley, its plot bore echoes of The Good and even featured Eli Wallach in a supporting role. Though Eastwood had noted during the making of The Good that he could pick the parts he wanted to play, on his return to the US he capitalised on the success of the ‘Dollars’ ﬁ lms by typecasting himself as a Leonesque western hero. With his ‘Dollars’ earnings and a $119,000 Rawhide payoff, Eastwood formed his own production company, Malpaso (named after Malpaso Creek on his land is Monterey), with a view to having a personal stake in his ﬁlms: this way he would be able to control his own career and the projects he participated in. All of his subsequent westerns were made with Malpaso as co-producer. In collaboration with Leonard Freeman Productions, Malpaso co-produced and ﬁnanced Hang ’Em High, which was released through United Artists. Freeman wrote the script with Mel Goldberg, and Ted Post, who had worked with Eastwood on Rawhide, directed the ﬁ lm. Cooper, an ex-lawman from St Louis, is herding his recently bought cattle through Oklahoma, when he is accused by a posse of stealing the herd from Johansen, a rancher who has since been murdered. The men, led by their employer Captain Wilson (Ed Begley), are Miller, Reno, Stone, Jenkins, Maddow, Tommy, Loomis and Charlie Blackfoot. They lynch Cooper and leave him for dead, but Marshall Dave Bliss (Ben Johnson) ﬁnds Cooper, revives him and takes him to Fort Grant, where ‘Hangin’ Judge Fenton’ (Pat Hingle) presides. Acquitted and left with a nasty scar around his neck (which he conceals with a neckerchief), Cooper is convinced by Fenton to become a deputy marshal, which will enable him to take revenge on the men he seeks legally. While on a routine jail pickup, Cooper kills Reno. Then Jenkins turns himself in at Fort Grant and Cooper discovers that the rest of the lynch party are in the town of Red Creek"
