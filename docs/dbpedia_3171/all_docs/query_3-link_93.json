        "text": "Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (Rewatch. DVD.)\n\nI think it was Quentin Tarantino who said that Michael Cimino’s The Deer Hunter was a “character study shot like an epic” or something like that, and that’s kinda what Cimino did here as well with his first film.\n\nYou spend something like an hour watching these two driving from small scenic town to small scenic town before the plot actually kicks in, but it’s time well spent because you get to watch Clint’s character pretty much fall in Like with his new friend without ever saying it. It’s all small gestures and actions and it’s some of Clint’s best understated work. People don’t give my man Clint enough props for this kind of acting, which is its own kind of difficult to pull off. Jeff Bridges is great here but it’s kinda like how Hoffman got all the attention forRain Man while The Cruiser was knocking it the fuck out as the, uh, straight man.\n\nFunny thing is, Bridges would do something like that again in John Carpenter’s Starman, which I would consider a good double-feature with this one. That one is also a road movie with a great showy Jeff Bridges performance that overshadows an even greater subtle performance by his co-star, Karen Allen\n\nMan, that’s a movie right there for you, isn’t it? A movie about Clint’s awesome glare and Karen Allen’s heartwarming smile.\n\nThis is definitely a Cimino film, filled with big skies and beautiful widescreen landscapes and dashes of macho cine-energy thrown in here and there. It also has many visual/character/location elements that you’ll see pop up in his later works, like speeding cars leaving trails of dust, attractive women with legs that go all the way up, shitkicker bars, pool tables, diners, John Holmes-sized firearms, war veterans, and various other things I’m in too much of a hurry to write out.\n\nThere’s also something else that pops out at me, given recent stories about M-Cim; so I guess he’s spent the last 20 years or so going under the knife and losing weight, and it’s gotten to the point that he’s been looking rather femme nowadays and there are rumors of him getting or going for a little bit of the Caitlyn Jenner action.\n\nWell, I couldn’t help but think of that when later in the film one character has to dress in drag, so maybe that was always something Cimino was into or at least considering, I don’t know.\n\nThe story goes that Clint kept Cimino in check, limiting him mostly to three takes max and speeding him up if he was taking too long setting a shot up. The climax of the film was supposed to take like a week or something to shoot but Clint last-minute gave Cimino only two days and they pulled it off.\n\nAnyway, I like the movie and come back to it every couple years or so. It’s very much a Sunday afternoon kind of joint, so of course I watched it Saturday morning.\n\nSouth Central (Rewatch. DVR.)\n\nThis one came out back in ’92, between Boyz N The Hood and Menace II Society. Some of the acting is really good (particularly the star, Glenn Plummer aka Tuneman from Speed) and some of it reminded me a bit of that English chap in the beginning of Black Dynamitegoing on about how he has to go “back to the streets, where I come from suckas”, and maybe that’s not too much of a coincidence since the co-writer of that movie is the co-star of this one.\n\nI liked it back in ’93 on VHS and I liked it now in HD, but nowadays it does feel a bit more artificial and theatrical in comparison to the more natural Boyz and Menace, but if you can get past that then you’ll probably be OK with this film. What this movie has in, uh, spades over the other ones is a stronger humane message — and yeah, I know, it was this kind of stuff that the parody DON’T BE A MENACE… poked fun of, but that’s to be expected from a bunch of genuine assholes like the Wayans Bros.\n\nI mean, I think DBAM is funny but when you really get down to it, the idea of making fun of movies about real violence going down in South Central L.A. is up there with, I don’t know, making a parody of Holocaust films. Call it Holocaust Movie and get Friedberg/Seltzer on it and have them make fun of scenes like the Nazi gun jamming inSchindler’s List only this time the gun shoots out that Bang! flag or something.\n\nAnyway, at times South Central can feel like a Christian film with the porn cut out, so to speak. Or actually it’s more like a Muslim equivalent to those kind of films, but like I’ve said before, even the most obvious and well-meaning preached-out messages don’t make them any less true.\n\nSo in a way it makes sense that Oliver Stone, a man who shotgunned Subtlety in the dick a long time ago, helped get this film made.\n\nPlus, they shoot fools using guns with potato suppressors on the barrels, so you gotta give ’em points for that.\n\nIn conclusion, to quote home-Muslim in the film: Bless yourself by helping someone else.\n\nOwning Mahowny (First time. DVR.)\n\nThe last time I gambled, I mean, with money, like, in a casino was back in 2012 at an Indian casino on my way home from a road trip. I played a few hands of Blackjack, playing with only $20 and making small bets, and got up to $120 before finally losing $20. It only made sense to walk away at that point while I was still ahead, and I thank the Maker that I’m wired that way, as opposed to people like Dan Mahowny (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who unfortunately did not quit while he was ahead on sobriety).\n\nMahowny is unfortunately one of those people who, to paraphrase what one character says about him, wants to win in order to have more money to lose. This poor schmuck is a degenerate whose bookie will even cut him off from time to time because he feels bad taking bets from someone who is clearly not well.\n\nHoffman is great here as a guy who can be quietly charming and likable so long as he’s not gambling. But when he’s in bettin’ mode, he gets cold and shuts the world around him off, and the only other emotions that might come out of him are muted annoyance or douchey petulance if you’re in the way of his robotic card-playing.\n\nThis is based on a true story and the way the movie plays this out is as if the film itself were a stranger at the casino lightly nudging your shoulder then whispering to you “Hey, check out the guy over there at the craps table. Can you believe that guy?”, as opposed to some bro shoving you and going “FUCKIN’ A, DUDE! LOOKIT DAT GUY! HE’S GONNA FUCK HIS SHIT UP, MAN!” the way I would if I saw some shit like that going down. This is probably because this is a Canadian film directed by a Brit, rather than some all-American razzmatazz-ery\n\nEveryone else in this movie is just as good as The Hoff-Man, like John Hurt as the casino boss who is amused by Mahowny but is still angling to take this motherfucker for all he’s worth, and Minnie Driver as Mahowny’s long-suffering girlfriend. You’ll also see a few familiar poutine-eating faces, like Bianca O’Blivion from Videodrome and the late great Maury Chaykin as the bookie.\n\nPart of the ending kinda annoyed me, but what can you do? Aside from that, it’s a good flick, you should check it out. Oh, and at one point Mahowny asks for a plate of ribs (no sauce) and a Coke, so guess who’s now in the mood for both? Fat fuck.\n\nThe Deer Hunter (Rewatch. Blu-ray.)\n\nIt says a lot about the power of cinema to focus on a bunch of loud-mouthed, beer-drinking, reckless driving assholes who are basically the 60s/70s version of Extreme Bros Who Go WOOOO! At Everything for three hours and leave you caring for them (or most of them, anyway).\n\nOr maybe it’s because you only get that Bro shit for the first hour or so, and then you watch the Bros get PWNED by Vietnam, to which a harder man would say “Serves them right. They went in there wanting the whole blood & guts experience, and that, by God, is what they got” but I’m not gonna be that guy at this moment and instead I’ll defend them by saying that this was back when people still believed in the idea of Going To War For God And Country because most people hadn’t realized yet that we had been sold a bill of goods by The Powers That Be and that Eisenhower was right about warning us about the Military Industrial Complex, but like most warnings given to us precious humans, we just chose to ignore that shit and now the Big MIC happily feeds on the poor and naive and BOY OH BOY is this a tall soapbox! I better get off of it carefully before I fall off and land on my giant ignorant ass.\n\nWhat was I saying? Oh yeah, watching these guys get fleshed out while their souls are flayed alive by Real Life In The Shit followed by Real Life In What Used To Be Our Playground is what makes this movie the masterpiece that it is. As mentioned in my ramblings aboutThunderbolt & Lightfoot, this film is a character study dressed in Epic Cinema clothing, and despite spending some time over in The Nam, this is not at all a war movie.\n\nIt’s been said that this could’ve easily have been about the characters going through some other major violent ordeal but Vietnam was the most recent, so it made sense to make it *that*. This unfortunately has led to criticisms about the portrayal of Non-Muricans as bloodthirsty Russian Roulette-betting assholes, which I understand but, hey, what are you gonna do? I mean, maybe if this was about the fictional Mexican Border War and it was Javier doing this shit then maybe I’d be like FUCK THIS MOVIE, but it isn’t, so I’m not.\n\nBut if I can be George Lopez for a second: Latinos, we wouldn’t do that to others — Russian Roulette was something we played at home with our friends when we were drunk and bored AYYYY CHOOOOOOOWWWWW *cue Jarabe Tapatio*\n\nBut you also have some of the Whites back home talking shit like “Kill some for me!” and stuff like that when talking about these dudes going to war, and I doubt statements like that are meant to be taken lightly, right?\n\nAll movies are flawed in one way or another, and The Deer Huntercertainly carries its fair share of Huge Gaping Maw flaws, but if you’re lucky enough to be like me and see the forest for the tree, then whaddya know, you’re a poet and didn’t know it OHHHHHHHH\n\nThis was Michael Cimino’s second film and because he didn’t have Clint Muthafuckin’ Eastwood pulling on his leash, homeboy was already doing the overbudget/overschedule thing here — only it worked out for him because the movie was a hit and Oscars were passed out to the production like candy.\n\nIt wouldn’t be until his next movie that his extravagant filmmaking style would finally reach Cimino’s buttcheeks, open its jaws big and wide, and chomp down hard on the motherfucker."
