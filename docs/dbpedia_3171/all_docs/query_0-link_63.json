        "text": "GREAT FALLS â€” Fort Benton might be looking a bit star-studded lately, as a movie called \"The Ploughmen\" is being partially filmed in the area.\n\nOn Saturday, the City of Fort Benton posted on Facebook: \"The city roads around the courthouse will be closed tomorrow in order to assist with filming of The Ploughmen. Please do not park on roads posted as 'No parking'.\"\n\nAccording to Deadline, actors Robert Duvall, Garret Hedlund, and Amy Madigan will star in the movie, which is being directed by Ed Harris. It's the story of the \"strange friendship that develops between a haunted young deputy sheriff and a notorious old murderer that turns both their worlds upside down.\"\n\nFort Benton is no stranger to the bright lights of Hollywood; it was also featured briefly in the 1974 Clint Eastwood-Jeff Bridges movie \"Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.\" Many scenes for that movie were filmed in and around Great Falls.\n\nAnd this isn't Robert Duvall's first time filming in Montana - he starred in the 1984 movie \"The Stone Boy,\" which was partially filmed in and around Cascade and Great Falls."
