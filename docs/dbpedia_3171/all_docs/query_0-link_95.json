        "text": "I always have a great time anytime I go to Butte. I get to go over several times a year due to my job, and I'm always discovering something new that I didn't know about one of the most historic towns in Montana.\n\nOne event that most people do know about is the Montana Folk Festival. It is one of the biggest free outdoor festivals in the Northwestern part of the United States and it just so happens to be this weekend.\n\nThe Montana Folk Festival is an annual event that takes place in Butte each summer (the full weekend in July) and features some of the best folk artists around.\n\nOh, and the music isn't the only reason to come and enjoy the Festival. They will have two different marketplace areas that will feature some incredible items for sale, plus there will be lots of food and drink with over 30 vendors available during the weekend.\n\nWhat's planned for the 2024 Montana Folk Festival?\n\nThe Festival starts tonight (Friday, July 12th) at 5 pm with the opening ceremony taking place at 6:30 pm. There will be three stages where artists will perform tonight (Friday evening)\n\nSaturday's festivities kick off at noon and go into the evening with multiple artists performing through the day and into the night. Sunday's activities also kick off at noon and the last performances are scheduled to start at 5:30 pm.\n\nRemember, the Montana Folk Festival is free admission and there will be much to do and see for folks of all ages."
