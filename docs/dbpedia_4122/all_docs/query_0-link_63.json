        "text": "Congratulations, Alma Mater! <strong>Alumni</strong> <strong>News</strong> OA Earns Highest Honors <strong>Oldenburg</strong> <strong>Academy</strong> of the Immaculate Conception opportunities await... every student, every day! SUMMER 2011 four star school <strong>Alumni</strong> Association welcomes 2011 graduates! <strong>Oldenburg</strong> <strong>Academy</strong> celebrated their recently acquired Four Star School status on Friday, March 18. The celebration kicked off on Thursday afternoon with all students, faculty, and staff members receiving Four Star School t-shirts. They were asked to wear their new t-shirts with jeans on Friday. Students, faculty, and staff alike enjoyed a free lunch of pizza, salad, cake, and make your own ice cream sundaes. On Thursday, a Four Star school sign was put on display in front of the academic building. The OA Community is proud to receive this honor and excited to see what opportunities the future will hold. A Four Star School rating is the highest rating that a school can receive from the Indiana Department of Education. This is the first year that private schools were considered for the honor. OA is one of only two schools in the Indianapolis Archdiocese that was named a Four Star School.
