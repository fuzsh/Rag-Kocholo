        "text": "A new principal was hired for the 2021-2022 school year and a new principal in 2022. The changes altered the entire attitude/ philosophy of the school. Supporting students with IEPs / educational special needs changed and students were asked to leave that were considered not equal to the new leaders' perspectives. Special needs were not supported and students with special needs were treated poorly. Bullying was allowed to continue even after notifications to leadership, nothing was done. Clicks are pervasive. We are sorry our child went to Oldenburg. It is a lovely physical environment, but a terrible one to learn in unless an elite catholic child. Non-catholic children are singled out and our child was even punished for not knowing 1 of the catholic rules regarding communion and was told a sin had been committed as had not followed rules that were not communicated. Had to take summer school after placement tests as failed math & language although had straight As at Oldenburg.\n\nNo one really cares about you. Definitely not \"authentically catholic.\" Don't know why I ever went here. High school sucks but it sucks a lot more here. Its definitely not for me. They do have good resources though and it has potential. It is just definitely not for me. It could have been for someone else, just not me. Teachers are annoying and don't give a crap about you. They choose favorites give them better grades and treat them much better than the rest of the school. If it was a public school it would be okay, but for spending upwards of 9k every year, it is sooooo not worth it. They spent millions of dollars on the \"feldhaus,\" which is completely unnecessary. Why should a \"college preparatory school have two gyms? Its completely pointless. Even if sports were important, the only home court/field we have is for basketball (volleyball) so why get another gym??!?!?!?? No one who goes here actually wants to be here either."
