        "text": "OLDENBURG – A Southeast Indiana high school says it fired their girls’ soccer coach after finding out he was recently charged with sex crimes against juveniles.\n\nHamilton County sheriff’s detectives arrested Brian Hronek, 48, on Oct. 16 and charged him with pandering obscenity involving a minor.\n\nAt the time, Hronek was listed as coach with the 2019-20 Cincinnati West Soccer Club, a youth soccer club that competes in the Cincinnati United Soccer League.\n\nMonday, Oldenburg Academy of the Immaculate Conception confirmed Hronek worked for their school as the girls’ soccer coach and confirmed they fired him.\n\nSchool president Diane H. Laake said she was notified by the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office about Hronek’s arrest.\n\nShe said the school was told last week about the sheriff’s office investigation and immediately took steps to remove him from any contact with students.\n\nLaake said detectives assured her no students at Oldenburg were involved in any of their findings.\n\n“Nothing is more important than the safety of our students,” Laake said.\n\nCourt documents describe 10 different pieces of obscene material in Hronek’s possession prior to his arrest, including videos and pictures of children engaged in sexual acts with adults.\n\nThe children range in age from 12 years to 7 months old.\n\nImages seized as evidence include ones showing naked children tied to beds or trees, court records show.\n\nEnquirer media partner Fox19 provided this report."
