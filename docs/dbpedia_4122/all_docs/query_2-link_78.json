        "text": "Indiana has a rich and deep history, going far back in time from Native American tribes to French settlement to becoming the 19th state in the union on December 11, 1816. As a result of this history, Indiana has many small towns with beautiful historic districts. The oldest town in Indiana was first settled by the French in the 1700s, while another town called New Harmony was founded by a group of religious utopians from Germany in the 1800s. In fact, many of these small towns have rich histories of German immigration, which is still reflected in their culture, cuisine and architecture. Read on to learn more about 10 of the oldest small towns in Indiana.\n\nNew Albany\n\nNestled on the Ohio River, the land that would become New Albany was first claimed by the Scribner brothers from 1812 to 1813. From there the town was first incorporated in 1817, only one year after Indiana became a state. Today, New Albany has a rich historic district, which includes the beautiful Culbertson Mansion State Historic Site, a Victorian mansion from the late 1800s and the Town Clock Church, which was a stop on the Underground Railroad for escaped slaves. The town also has great walking trails, with the Ohio River Greenway running for 7 miles to the nearby communities of Clarksville and Jeffersonville and the Campbell-Woodland Nature Trails and Silver Hills Historic Nature Trail & Wildlife Sanctuary offering gentle walks through the woods. Don't forget to try some of the many locally owned restaurants and bakeries in town, such as the Honey Creme Donut Shop and the New Albanian Brewing Company.\n\nMarion\n\nFounded in 1831 by Martin Boots and David Branson, the city gained its name for the American Revolution War General Francis Marion. Marion had seen settlement at least 20 years prior to its official founding, also being the site of the Battle of the Mississinewa in the War of 1812. Travelers can visit that battlefield today along with other historic sites such as the James Dean Birth Site Memorial, the birthplace of the famous Hollywood actor. There's plenty of unique sites in town as well, such as three statues of the cartoon cat Garfield spread throughout Grant County and the Quilters Hall of Fame. For places to go for a walk, consider the picturesque Gardens of Matter Park. There's plenty to see in this charming Indiana town.\n\nJasper\n\nNamed after the precious metal described as being the foundation of New Jerusalem in the Bible, Jasper was first founded in 1830 but wasn't incorporated as a town until 1866. It has a long history of immigration, particularly German Catholic residents who still shape the community today with their German culture and traditions. If you want to learn more about Jasper, visit the Dubois County Museum, the largest county museum in Indiana or visit the Old Jasper district which has many historic buildings ranging from the Schaeffer Barn to a One Room School House. Jasper is also home to the majestic Sisters of Saint Benedict Monastery Immaculate Conception, which also features the St. Benedict's Brew Works brewery. If a hike is what you're looking for, visit the Patoka Lake & Recreation Area or the nearby Ferdinand State Forest.\n\nNew Harmony\n\nNew Harmony has a rich history going back to the days of utopian experimentation in America. In 1814, the Harmonie Society came to the area, a Separatist group led by George Rapp, aimed to create an ideal society. In 1825, the community was sold to Robert Owen, who started his own utopian experiment. Today, New Harmony is filled with historical sites, which you can visit on the Historic New Harmony Walking Tour. This tour will take you by the Thrall's Opera House, Rapp-Owen Granary, Harmonist cemetery, and more. Other than historic sites, there are many other unique spots to see, including the Harmonist Labyrinth, Cathedral Labyrinth, Harmonie State Park, and more. Come and see what made this town so appealing to all of these utopian groups.\n\nCorydon\n\nNo list of old Indiana towns would be complete without mentioning Corydon. First established in 1808, Corydon was the state capitol from 1816 to 1825 before it was moved to Indianapolis. As a result, Corydon is filled to the brim with early Indiana sites to visit. These include the Corydon Capitol State Historic Site, Governor Hendricks' Headquarters, Battle of Corydon State Site, and the Constitutional Elm, where the first state constitution was signed. You can discover all of these sites by taking a walking tour of the city. For other things to discover in town, go underground at the Indiana Caverns. This historic town is perfect for a day out.\n\nOldenburg\n\nIt's right there in the name: Oldenburg has been around for a long time. Much like Jasper, it has always had a large German Catholic population. In 1817, the first settlers came into the area and the town itself was platted in 1837. For lovers of traditional Catholic church architecture, Oldenburg is an ideal place to visit with both the Holy Family Church and the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception offering picturesque views. In fact, the spires of these churches earn Oldenburg the nickname the Village of Spires. The town is also renowned for its German restaurants and stores including the Brau Haus, Wagner's Village Inn, A Beautiful World and The Golden Turtle Trading Center.\n\nClarksville\n\nLocated a few miles away from New Albany, Clarksville has roots going back to the 1700s, prior to Indiana joining the Union. It was founded in 1783 in the former Northwest Territory and today is a rich community with many places to see and explore. For prehistoric history enjoyers, the Falls of the Ohio State Park features a museum that depicts the many Devonian-era fossil beds right on the Ohio River, which, if you're lucky, you can find yourself on the riverbank. Other attractions include the Colgate Clock, the Clarksville Little Theater, the Derby Dinner Playhouse, and more. While you're on the Ohio River Greenway, you can also make a stop at Lewis and Clark Park, which offers more information on the spot where Lewis and William Clark first met up and began their journey to the West.\n\nMadison\n\nMadison has a long history going back to 1670 when the French claimed the area as a colony. However, the first European settlers didn't arrive in the area until 1805, with the first cabin going up in 1806. Much of the architecture from the 1800s is still standing in Madison, including the Lanier Mansion built in 1844, the Jeremiah Sullivan House from 1820, and the Historic Eleutherian College built by Neil's Creek Anti-Slavery Society in 1848. The history of the town is also written in the beautiful tombs in Springdale Cemetery, which is the final resting place of many American heroes, including American Civil War veterans. Once you are done exploring the historic sites, relax next to the waterfalls at the Clifty Falls State Park.\n\nLafayette\n\nThe first settlement in the area around Lafayette was the French Fort Ouiatenon, located across the Wabash River since 1717. Eventually the area passed under British control and then American and was platted in 1825. It was named after the French officer General Lafayette, who served in the American Revolution. There are many historic sites both inside and around town, including Tippecanoe Battlefield Park, the site of a major battle in the War of 1812, and Prophetstown State Park. You can also see the site of Fort Ouiatenon at the Quiatenon Preserve. For other things to do, consider visiting the Art Museum of Greater Lafayette or try out a mead at Arvin's Acres Winery & Meadery. It's an ideal place to chill out.\n\nVincennes\n\nWe saved the oldest for last with this list. Unlike many other towns claimed by France, the French actually established a settlement here in Vincennes in 1732. The area was conquered by the British during the 7 Years' War and then added to the fledging United States of America. There is a lot of historic buildings here, including the French House, built by a French settler in 1809, the Red House Original Territory Capitol Building, the oldest government building in the Midwest, and the Jefferson Academy, founded in 1801 by then-Governor William Henry Harrison. You can visit Harrison's mansion at Grouseland or see a monument commemorating the conquest of the Northwest Territory at George Rogers Clark National Historical Park. There are so many historic treasures to see in Vincennes.\n\nIndiana may not have the reputation for deep American history like the original 13 colonies, but it does have many hidden treasures inside of its old towns. From sites of major battles to government facilities, mansions and more, there's always something new to discover. And with so many great parks, restaurants and shops, you'll have a great time no matter when you visit."
