Rated a four star school, Oldenburg Academy offers plenty of opportunities for both academically based students as well as athletes.\n\nOriginally platted in 1837 as Public square #3, the park was the site of the first Gehring brickyard in 1858. Today, the park serves as a wonderful area for children to safely play while their parents relax."
