        "text": "IndyStar is highlighting returning boys soccer players to watch by position before unveiling the 2024 preseason ALL-USA Super Team next week.\n\nToday's position group: Midfielders.\n\nThis list was compiled prior to tryouts. Some players may have opted out of high school soccer to play academy.\n\nIHSAA boys soccer: Indy-area's top goalkeepers to watch in 2024\n\nIHSAA boys soccer: Indy-area's top defenders to watch in 2024\n\nIvan Acuna, Pike\n\nPike will have a new look this season and Acuna’s one of the players ready to help fill in offensively for Anelson Azard. The senior picked up 17 goals and 13 assists, while aiding a sectional champion defense which allowed only 29 goals.\n\nJack Anderson, Hamilton Southeastern\n\nHSE loses a big piece from its midfield (Drew MacDonald), but returns another key contributor in Anderson, who notched six goals and a couple assists as a junior. He scored goals vs. Cathedral and Brownsburg, and had assists vs. Guerin Catholic and Carmel.\n\nQuinn Bateman, Cathedral\n\nAn up-and-comer, the junior demonstrated his skills as a creator and disruptor for the Irish, posting two goals and seven assists. He has six goals and nine assists for his career.\n\nAndy Beck, Herron\n\nBeck registered seven goals and seven assists on the attack, while aiding a defense which only gave up 20 goals in 16 games.\n\nMichael Bonaccorsi, Cathedral\n\nBonaccorsi stepped into a key role as a freshman, helping the 3A runner-up Irish to a 17-5-2 finish that saw them out-score opponents 80-26.\n\nIHSAA soccer polls: Check out latest rankings of Indiana's best boys, girls teams\n\nAlejandro Calzada-Cano, Scecina\n\nThe junior was critical a cog for a vastly improved Crusaders defense last season, giving them a chance down the stretch in many a game. Scecina is built to maintain last year’s momentum with virtually its entire lineup set to return.\n\nBoden Campbell, Greenwood Christian\n\nGCA was an underdog in 2022 (finished Class A state runner-up after a five-win regular season), a rising power last year (15-5, regional champion) and is now a bonafide title contender. The junior Campbell is a big reason for those lofty expectations. He scored 22 goals and picked up five assists, including the game-winner in the regional semifinal vs. Oldenburg Academy.\n\nCaden Camden, Greenwood Christian\n\nAnother key returner for GCA, the senior Camden tallied 25 points (eight goals, nine assists), while helping a defense which conceded only 17 goals en route to a 15-5 finish.\n\nCole Christopher, New Palestine\n\nThe junior scored four goals and five assists, giving him seven and eight for his career. Christopher’s varsity experience will be important for the Dragons as they look to replace key contributors from last year’s sectional runner-up.\n\nOliver Church, Westfield\n\nThe senior tallied six goals and three assists in his first full varsity season. He accounted for two of those goals in one-goal wins over Franklin Central and Hamilton Southeastern, and aided a defense which allowed only 25 goals. Westfield returns three of its top-seven scorers.\n\nCharlie Cole, Mt. Vernon\n\nCole had himself a career year on the attack, scoring a team-high 16 goals and adding four assists. The Marauders graduated only two seniors from last season and are poised for a strong season.\n\nUziel Garcia, Decatur Central\n\nThe junior matched his freshman year numbers as a sophomore, posting five goals and five assists. The Hawks are looking to bounce back from a four-win campaign wherein they tallied 26 goals.\n\nEvin Gonzales, Shortridge\n\nOne to keep an eye on in the City circuit, the senior tallied six goals and 10 assists for Shortridge, which won nine games for the fourth time in five seasons.\n\nArron Habecker, Zionsville\n\nHabecker made a major splash as a sophomore with eight goals and five assists — both career-highs. He scored key goals vs. Westfield and Hamilton Southeastern, and had an assist vs. Carmel. The Eagles are built for a successful 2024 campaign, but a deep state tournament run will require navigating a sectional featuring: Brebeuf Jesuit, Carmel, Noblesville, North Central and Westfield.\n\nLandon Heath, Martinsville\n\nThe defensive mid scored three goals and four assists, while aiding a defense which averaged less than a goal against per game. Martinsville is coming off its second consecutive 11-win season.\n\nJoey Heaviland, Speedway\n\nA two-sport fall athlete, Heaviland demonstrated his savviness as a passer, tallying 21 assists and three goals for the sectional champions. The junior will have some quality attackers to distribute to again this season with Alexander Yohanis and Drew Metalic (22 combined goals) set to return. Heaviland had five goals and 24 assists for his career.\n\nPaxton Holmes, New Palestine\n\nThe Dragons have a few big names to replace at all three levels, but Holmes is a reason for excitement moving forward. The junior scored a career-high six goals with a couple assists last fall.\n\nLandon Holt, Greenwood\n\nThe junior embraced his role as the Woodmen’s primary set piece taker, and finished the season with seven goals and three assists.\n\nAiden Long, Indian Creek\n\nLong matched his production from 2022 last fall, tallying nine goals and a career-high nine assists. He led the Braves in both categories and helped them to a seven-win finish.\n\nAngel Morales, Pike\n\nThe showed off his abilities as a facilitator through the middle, racking up 11 assists (second-most on the team) and five goals. He notched assists in wins over Westfield, Cathedral and in sectional vs. Brownsburg.\n\nTaiki Nakamura, Park Tudor\n\nNakamura made an immediate impact as a freshman, registering nine assists and three goals over 19 games.\n\nJameson Neill, Heritage Christian\n\nCapable of beating defenders off the dribble with a cannon of a shot, the senior racked up 13 goals and 12 assists last season. The Eagles have some pieces to replace, but have potential for a sectional title run. Their group was resorted with perennial powerhouse Brebeuf Jesuit moving to Class 3A.\n\nEllis Nichols, Westfield\n\nAnother Rock who made his varsity debut in 2023, Nichols picked up five goals and an assist with six shots on goal over 16 games.\n\nLorenzo Nofrini, Park Tudor\n\nNofrini made a splash as a freshman (two goals, four assists) and he maintained that level of production as a sophomore, tallying two goals and assist while aiding a defense that recorded seven shutouts and averaged less than two goals against per game.\n\nDiego Ojeda, Danville\n\nThe senior picked up six goals and 11 assists last season, and will have another season with the team’s primary attacker this fall (Eli Tricker).\n\nMatthew Payne, Franklin\n\nThe Grizzly Cubs have had scoring gaps to fill entering the past two seasons and both times Payne rose to the occasion and expanded his game. He scored 11 goals and notched a team-high 15 assists as a junior, and will be one of the team’s most (and only) experienced players in 2024.\n\nCarson Prather, Guerin Catholic\n\nDefenses tend to roll to Prather’s side of the field, but that’s done little to slow the senior who tallied 15 goals and three assists on the attack. He’s a tireless worker in both ends, and is one to watch as Guerin looks to build upon last year’s five-win finish.\n\nCarson Shattuck, Park Tudor\n\nWith a strong supporting cast returning, look for another strong season from Shattuck, who scored eight goals and three assists in 19 games as a sophomore.\n\nMax Stucky, Cascade\n\nThe Cadets out-scored opponents 92-18 en route to a 16-win sectional championship campaign. Stucky was a key piece in the middle, generating nine goals and 11 assists on the attack.\n\nJordan Wedges, Cathedral\n\nInjury cut Wedges’ season short, but the junior is still coming off a very strong sophomore season. He picked up six assists in his second year as a starter and established himself as a talented connector through the middle."
