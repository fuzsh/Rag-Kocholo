We recognize that these individuals are living into the dream God had for them long before their birth. Their unique gifts remind us that God's love is dynamic and transformative. We feel called to openly state our support for this marginalized community during these times when they are increasingly faced with violence and criticism for their identities and experiences. We pledge to make an open commitment to supporting justice, equity, and affirmation for transgender and nonbinary individuals throughout the Catholic Church and the world.”\n\nTo read the entire declaration, click on the link: https://belovedbygod.faith/ You are welcome to sign the declaration as an individual.\n\nCONVENT GUIDED TOURS IN 2024\n\nMonday through Saturday 1:00-4:00 pm\n\nConvent buildings are on the national historic site as is much of the town of Oldenburg.

Its dirty secret: abuse of immigrant labor. “Building the American Dream” captures a turning point as a movement forms to fight widespread construction industry injustices. Grieving their son, a Mexican family campaigns for a life-and-death safety ordinance. A Salvadorian electrician couple owed thousands in back pay fights for their children’s future. A bereaved son battles to protect others from his family's preventable tragedy. A story of courage, resilience, and community, the film reveals shocking truths about the hardworking immigrants who build the American Dream, from which they are excluded.\n\nA preview of the film, “Building the American Dream” is available here: https://clintonfranciscans.com/news--events/event-calendar/event/2024/05/15/movies-that-matter-informing-your-vote-building-the-american-dream\n\nThere is no cost.
