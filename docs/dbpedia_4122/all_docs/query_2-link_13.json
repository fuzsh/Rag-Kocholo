        "text": "Students from Southeast Indiana recently gathered at Oldenburg Academy for the three-day camp.\n\nPhoto provided.\n\n(Ripley County, Ind.) - Genesis: Pathways to Success resumed its A Summer of STREAM (Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) initiative this week with Jedi Knight Academy. 36 students from schools across Southeast Indiana assembled at Oldenburg Academy to satiate their desires to enter the world of Star Wars and become Jedi Masters.\n\nFrom Tuesday, July 9 through Thursday, July 11, students entered into the halls of the transformed Oldenburg Academy, studying the ways of the Jedi. The Jedi Initiates embarked on their journey through the Star Wars universe by entering the ice caves of Ilum and being connected with their kyber crystals, the power source for lightsabers. The colors of the crystals sorted the campers into their alliances: purple crystals were the Warriors, blue crystals were the Guardians, yellow crystals were the Sentinels, and green crystals were the Counselors.These crystals were housed in a baking powder solution and were deshelled by pouring vinegar on them. Through this, the students learned a common chemical reaction that was masked by a Star Wars themed veil, thus making them more willing to engage and interact with the lesson in front of them.\n\nCoinciding with this, the padawans, training Jedi, embarked on a quest to create their own lightsabers! Armed with cardboard, construction paper, and plastic tubing, the campers crafted lightsabers based on a design of their choosing. Each was a unique masterpiece showcasing students' individual personalities. This activity dove into the realms of engineering and art, ensuring their designs were visually appealing and perfectly balanced. Kennedy Kohlmeier, an incoming 5th grader at Batesville Intermediate School, was captivated by this aspect of Jedi Knight Academy when she stated, “I loved everything about making the lightsabers. The quest for the kyber crystals and making the actual lightsabers made me feel like I was actually becoming a Jedi, while also letting me express myself through its design.”\n\nIn addition to their Jedi training, students participated in various activities popular throughout the Star Wars galaxies. One of these activities was the Boonta Eve Classic, the famous pod racing event. Working with their alliances, the padawans forged a shell, engine, and cockpit from cardboard and then designed their pod. The creation was then attached to a scooter which the students sat on and were pulled around a track, participating in the race of a lifetime! This event further connected kids with engineering concepts. When building their pods, weight balance, pilot position, and durability must be accounted for to ensure their pod was safe, but light. Along with engineering and chemistry, students were connected to robotics through Droid Sphero races. A Jedi’s main companion in Star Wars is a droid, therefore allowing these students to interact with robotics further envelops them in the Star Wars mystique. In these races, the campers navigated their droid through an obstacle course, switching drivers after each successful run. Along with the Star Wars theme, this activity allows them to gain practical experience in robot control; a technology that is rapidly expanding. Camouflaging this aspect of STEM tricks the students into familiarizing themselves with technology that continues to pervade both the manufacturing industry and our everyday lives.\n\nFurthermore, students improved their teamwork and strategic thinking through sports as well. The alliances competed in Smashball, a cross between soccer and basketball. Five players were on the court for each team and assigned to 3 positions: offense, defense, and midfield. In these positions, the students were tasked with various responsibilities to help their team secure victory, thus teaching them the importance of responsibility. Along with this, the students had to communicate with each other. When playing defense, players were not allowed to just play goalie. Instead, they were required to rotate who was goalie and who would stop the opposing player with the ball. Through this, the students employed the critical thinking and strategy taught from the other activities in a new way, while also learning the benefits of experimentation through testing new strategies.\n\nIn addition to finding unique vessels to promote learning in the summer, Jedi Knight Academy places great importance on nurturing self esteem and encouraging students to proudly be themselves. Nathaniel Walter, a teacher at South Dearborn High School, echoed this sentiment when he stated, “The beauty of Jedi Knight Academy lies in its normalization of an interest that people were traditionally ostracized for. This camp shows these kids how their interests are easily brought to life, and it shows them that there are others who love the same things they do.” For those who struggle with self-confidence, this camp provides a supportive environment where their interests are celebrated. Allowing these students to submerge themselves in the Star Wars universe gives them the opportunity to be themselves to those around them, helping build confidence and find a sense of belonging.\n\nGenesis: Pathways to Success would like to thank Oldenburg Academy for being gracious hosts and helping us bring Jedi Knight Academy to life. We would like to give a special thanks to Honda for sponsoring Jedi Knight Academy. We would also like to thank our volunteers from schools across Southeast Indiana, including South Ripley, St. Louis Catholic School, Milan, South Dearborn. Thank you for your endless dedication and passion for empowering our youth! Genesis looks forward to hosting Jedi Knight Academy again in the summer of 2025."
