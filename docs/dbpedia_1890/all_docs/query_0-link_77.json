        "text": "The country with the southernmost point is Antarctica. However, because of Antarctica's severely cold weather and its remoteness, it is devoid of permanent human life. Indeed, Antarctica is the only continent on Earth that cannot support permanent human life.\n\nAntarctica is a source of interest to researchers and scientists who live there on a contractual basis during the summer. Its ice sheet provides information on what Earth has been like for the past million years. The continent also provides information on how the activities of humans have impacted the Earth. More than 60 research centers are scattered throughout the continent, and as many as 5,000 researchers live there during the summer. Tourists also visit Antarctica during the summer.\n\nUshuaia, a city in the Tierra del Fuego region of Argentina, is the southernmost city in the world. The city nicknamed the \"End of the World,\" is at 54.8019° S, 68.3030° W. While some settlements exist south of Ushuaia, none are large enough or have sufficient infrastructure to be considered a city. Puerto Williams, in Chile, is the southernmost town in the world, based on latitude. Its coordinates are 54°56′S 67°37′W. Located on Isla Navarino, it has a population of about 2,800.\n\nAbout 82,000 people live in Ushuaia, about 680 miles from the Antarctic Peninsula. Because of its proximity to Antarctica, it is viewed as one of the five international gateway cities to Antarctica. Unlike Antarctica, temperatures are cool but not cold. Tourism is a major industry in Ushuaia, mainly because it is a launch site for travel to Isla Yécapasela, which has a large colony of penguins.\n\nSeveral other Argentinian and Chilean settlements are considered to be among the Earth's southernmost. Tolhuin, Argentina, at 54°32′S 67°12′W, is a town of about 3,000 people. Rio Grande, Argentina, at 53°47′S 67°42′W, is a city of about 55,000. Porvenir, Chile, at 53°17′S 70°22′W, is a town of about 4,700."
