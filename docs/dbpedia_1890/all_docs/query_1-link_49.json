        "text": "TEHRAN (AP) – Jordan’s foreign minister met Iran’s acting foreign minister in Tehran on Sunday. Ayman Safadi is the first senior Jordanian official to pay an official visit to Iran in over 20 years.\n\nSafadi “will deliver a message from His Majesty King Abdullah II to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on the situation in the region and bilateral relations”, Jordan’s Foreign Ministry said earlier in a statement.\n\nThe foreign minister will later meet the newly elected Iranian president, according to Iran’s state TV.\n\nSafadi insisted that the tension in the region would end only with the cessation of the war in Gaza during his meeting with acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani, state TV reported, adding that the two discussed bilateral relations and developments in the region.\n\nAfter the meeting, Jordan’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Safadi’s visit was to hold discussions on the “dangerous escalation” across the Middle East.\n\n“We want our region to live in security, peace and stability, and we want the escalation to end,” Safadi was quoted as saying, calling for an end to the war in the Gaza Strip and a resumption of talks for a Palestinian state.\n\nSafadi reiterated Jordan’s condemnation of Hamas’ top political leader Ismail Haniyeh’s killing, calling it an “escalatory step” and urged for calm, fearing a regional war would have a “devastating impact on everyone”.\n\n“We have begun an in-depth dialogue that we are completing now, within the consultation framework on how our position can be clear in condemning the crime committed, and in emphasising the need to respect Iran’s sovereignty and international law, while at the same time protecting our region from catastrophic consequences,” he added."
