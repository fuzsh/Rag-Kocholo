        "text": "underwater paradise of Sabah s reefs.\n\nA protected area, diving in the waters off of Sipadan Island offers some of the most diverse diving in the world. With abundant marine life, spot sea turtles in their natural habitat, swim amongst swirling tornado-like formations of fish, float alongside gliding manta rays and see whale sharks, hammerheads and more than 3,000 species of fish.\n\nMany flock to Sabah to climb Mount Kinabalu, Southeast Asia s tallest mountain standing at 4,095 metres high. The trek will take you past fruit trees, through lush vegetation and alongside hundreds of orchids living under a constant foggy mist. Taking two days to climb, the first day will get you about halfway up while the second day, after an early start, you ll be at the summit by sunrise for incredible views once the fog clears. Relax and heal your aching body in the sulphurous waters of the Poring Hot Springs or take the canopy walkway along a series of walkways 60 metres above the ground.\n\nNear Sandakan in northern Borneo, is the world s largest orangutan sanctuary, Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre. Founded in 1964 to rehabilitate orphaned infant orangutans, you can get as close as two metres to these beautiful creatures on the viewing platform and at feeding times. Sometimes looking after other animals such as sun bears, gibbons and rhino, once they have been rehabilitated and taught self-survival skills, they are released into the surrounding reserve.\n\nForty kilometres from Sandakan s coast is Turtle Islands Park, a group of three islands where Green and Hawksbill Turtles are protected with an egg collection program. Rangers collect the eggs nightly and resettle them at hatcheries. Once the eggs hatch, the turtles are released into the sea."
