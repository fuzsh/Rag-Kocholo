        "text": "Sarawak State in recent years has become an attractive destination for those who love exploring the diverse culture of East Malaysia.\n\nSituated on the island of Borneo, Miri and Kuching – two cities in the state of Sarawak in recent years have become attractive destinations for those who love exploring the diverse culture of Eastern Malaysia.\n\nKuching of Sarawak\n\nBeing the capital of the state and the cleanest city of Malaysia, Kuching is located amidst the Sarawak Mountains, blessed by trees and natural forests filled with the city. It takes 2 hours to fly from Kuala Lumpur to Kuching International Airport, and then moves another 22km to the center. Kuching in Malaysian means cat. Cats also become the symbol of this place. Almost every home raise cat, with the concept that this animal will bring good luck.\n\nKuching’s crowds are concentrated on the south bank of the Sarawak River, where Chinese people live together, with important structures painted in blue. The northern side is less bustling, with green architecture, which is dominated by Malaysians and Bumi Aborigines people. You can take sampan (river taxi) for a panoramic view of the city. The outstanding point is Golden Anniversary Bridge with 330m length. The bridge was opened in 2017, is considered the new symbol of Kuching with unique winding road across the river Sarawak.\n\nThe Sarawak Museum is one of the finest museums in Asia, featuring exhibits on ethnicity, natural history, Malaysian artifacts and Chinese porcelain.\n\nYou also should not miss the opportunity to visit the cat museum, with hundreds of cat-related objects from the neck of the needles are on display.\n\nAbout 40 km from the center of the city is Damai Beach. Here, besides windswept beaches, you can visit the traditional rich culture Sarawak. Located at the foot of Santubong Mountain, this is the venue for World Harvest Festival and Rainforest World Music Festival in July every year. Sarawak Cultural Village displays traditional costumes, handicrafts, lifestyles and houses of the Iban, Bidayuh, Orang Ulu and Melanau communities.\n\nKuching has many national parks, of which Bako is the oldest park in Sarawak, located 37 km from Kuching. Bako is home to many of Borneo’s rich flora and fauna, including foxes, bearded pigs, silver moths, carnivorous plants and wild orchids. Bako also has many beautiful beaches with pristine beaches.\n\nSee some tours in Bako here\n\nYou can also visit Gunung Gading Park, a 2-hour drive from Kuching to see the world’s largest flower, Rafflesia, up to 1 meter in diameter.\n\nMiri, the gateway to rainforest exploration.\n\nApart from Kuching, Miri is also an attractive destination for Sarawak. The city is located near the border with Brunei, the gateway to northern Sarawak with vast national parks, majestic rivers and plateaus. From Kuching to Miri, it takes over an hour flight. If you go directly from Kuala Lumpur, you will have to sit for nearly two and a half hours.\n\nBordered by Brunei, Miri attracts a large number of tourists from this country. They come to Miri to shop and have some fun, especially when going down the bar.\n\nSeahorse is a symbol of Miri. Coastal tourism is also quite developed in the city, with the popular diving coral viewing service.\n\nThe city center does not have many sights, so people come here to transfer to Sarawak’s other impressive eco-tourism destinations, with four popular national parks: Gunung Mulu, Niah, Lambir Hills and Loagan Bunut. Gunung Mulu National Park, about 45 minutes from Miri, is famous for its limestone caves, one of the world’s largest caves. Besides, the Pinnacles Rocky Mountains are impressive.\n\nNiah Great Lake in Niah National Park is 2 hours by motorcycle from Miri. This is the place to find the oldest human relics in Southeast Asia.\n\nMany choose to fly from Miri to Mario to conquer the foggy Kelabit Highlands, experience the lifestyle and activities of local people."
