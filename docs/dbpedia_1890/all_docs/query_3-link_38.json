        "text": "TEHRAN: Iran announced on Monday it would shorten working hours for state-run organisations and banks in several provinces as a heatwave sweeps the country.\n\nThe government said work hours on Tuesday will be from 6 am. to 10 am. local time. The move aims to protect public health and prevent power outages, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nThe decision affects 15 provinces, including Tehran, Isfahan, and Alborz, with essential services continuing to operate normally.\n\nTemperatures in many parts of Iran are expected to exceed 40 degrees Celsius in the coming days.\n\nTehran is forecast to reach 39 degrees Celsius on Monday and over 40 degrees Celsius subsequently. Some provinces, such as Yazd and Khuzestan, could see temperatures as high as 45 and 49 degrees Celsius, respectively, according to the report.\n\nThe government previously ordered a complete shutdown of state institutions on July 28 due to extreme heat. â€“ BERNAMA-XINHUA"
