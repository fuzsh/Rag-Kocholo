        "text": "Misty jungles, buzzing cities, epic cave networks and pristine national parks make the Malaysian state of Sarawak an unbelievable location for travellers of all stripes. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a budget backpacking adventure or bougie trip into the wild, you‚Äôll find it in Sarawak!\n\nFamed for its abundant nature and little-explored jungles, Sarawak is the largest of the two states in Malaysian Borneo. While vast swathes of Borneo‚Äôs never-ending cloud forests have been destroyed to make way for monocultures and development projects, there are still wild adventures to be found in Sarawak‚Äôs 30 national parks!\n\nAfter visiting Sarawak for the first time in 2024, I fell in love with the state. It‚Äôs home to amazing people, beautiful landscapes and abundant wildlife ‚Äì I even loved its cities!\n\nSo, let‚Äôs break down everything you need to know about visiting Sarawak!\n\nSarawak, Malaysia ‚Äì Backpacking Guide\n\nSarawak Map & Resources\n\nBest Time to Visit Sarawak üå¶Ô∏è\n\nSarawak has defined wet and dry seasons but there is slight variation across the state. March to September is considered the best time to visit. This is when Sarawak is at its driest ‚Äì but don‚Äôt be fooled into thinking you won‚Äôt see precipitation. It can rain any time of year!\n\nIf you‚Äôre hoping to experience jungle trekking, plan your Sarawak itinerary to avoid the rainy season (November to February), when many trails and roads become impassable. The temperature across Sarawak fluctuates very little. On average, it‚Äôs 27-32¬∫C year round.\n\nREAD üåßÔ∏è When Should I Visit Borneo?\n\nWhere to Stay in Sarawak, Malaysia üõèÔ∏è\n\nDisclosure: Some links on this page are affiliate links. We always write our articles before checking if affiliate links are available.\n\nSarawak is the largest state in Malaysia, so choosing where to stay can feel a tad overwhelming ‚Äì especially if you‚Äôre on a shorter trip! We recommend splitting your Sarawak adventure to cover at least a couple of locations, so you get a broader insight into this amazing state! Below are some recommended accommodation options in the most popular areas.\n\nThere aren‚Äôt many hostels in Sarawak. Outside of Kuching, accommodation in the state is mainly hotels. But don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre on a budget, they won‚Äôt break the bank!\n\nBest Accommodation in Miri\n\nAmigo Hotel ‚Äì This modern hotel is just a short walk to the nearest beach and various eateries. Set in a colonial-style building, rooms are simple with some thoughtful additions like filtered drinking water ‚Äì a must when trying to cope with the high temperatures in Borneo! If you want to be close to the beach without having to drop a lot of money, Amigo Hotel is the place for you!\n\nWalk Inn ‚Äì Clean, comfortable and located just a few minutes from the Bintang Mega Mall, Walk Inn Miri has all the basics covered. The staff are super friendly and knowledgeable about their city, offering information to all travellers who come through their doors. The location of Walk Inn feels a little odd as it‚Äôs seemingly built over a car park but all in all, it‚Äôs a convenient and comfortable place to base yourself when visiting Miri!\n\nPullman Miri Waterfront ‚Äì If you‚Äôre looking for a more luxurious stay in Miri, Pullman Miri Waterfront is the hotel for you. The hotel includes an infinity pool, excellent sea or city views and a range of eateries within the premises. Breakfast is included with some rooms. The best thing about Pullman Miri Waterfront isn‚Äôt the exceptional quality or amazing staff but the value for money! You get much more than you pay for!\n\nBest Accommodation in Bintulu\n\nStar Moon Hotel ‚Äì This budget hotel in Bintulu is close to the bus station, making it an excellent option for those breaking the epic bus journey from Miri to Kuching or vice versa. The hotel‚Äôs exterior leaves a little to be desired but inside, the minimalist aesthetic is well-designed and cared for. There are plenty of restaurants and shops within easy walking distance too!\n\nSentral View Hotel Bintulu ‚Äì Looking for a 4-star hotel at hostel prices? We‚Äôve got you covered with Sentral View Hotel Bintulu. Rooms are spacious, clean and tastefully decorated. There‚Äôs an onsite bar and fitness centre, so whether you‚Äôre looking to work out or wind down, there‚Äôs an option for you!\n\nNew World Suites ‚Äì For a dose of luxury, look no further than the incredible New World Suites. Based inside Parkcity Mall, a stay here means you‚Äôre surrounded by shops and restaurants. Breakfast is included and Bintulu Old Town is just a short Grab ride away!\n\nBest Accommodation in Sibu\n\nStarlink Hotel ‚Äì One of the best and cheapest accommodation options in Sibu, Starlink Hotel is a short car journey from the centre of the city but within walking distance of Star Mega Mall. This modern hotel offers a range of rooms including disabled access amenities!\n\nTexas Inn ‚Äì Located close to the heart of Sibu, Texas Inn is simple but comfortable and offers a pleasant stay. It‚Äôs within easy walking distance of many of the city‚Äôs attractions ‚Äì the reception staff can help you with hints and tips for exploring the city! There‚Äôs a caf√© on the ground floor which serves a range of Western food.\n\nDe House Hotel ‚Äì Located just a short journey from the city centre, near the confluence of the Igan and Rajang rivers, De House Hotel is a mixed bag. Some rooms are very spacious, while others feel a little cramped. The decor varies between rooms too. Some seem a bit spartan while others feature amazing decorations. However, even the less exciting rooms offer great value for money!\n\nBest Accommodation in Kuching\n\nKuching Riverine Resort ‚Äì A short Grab ride from Kuching‚Äôs waterfront area, Riverine Resort is the place to stay for privacy. With separate apartments, you can prepare meals or just lounge about in your pants if that‚Äôs your thing! There‚Äôs an onsite grocery store and swimming pool too!\n\nCheck In Lodge ‚Äì Another budget offering in Kuching, you can opt for dorms or private rooms at Check Inn Lodge. Both ensuite and shared bathroom options are available. Comfortable communal spaces make it easy to meet other travellers and the staff are super knowledgeable about their city!\n\nMarco Polo Guesthouse ‚Äì More of a hostel than a guesthouse, Marco Polo offers private rooms and dorms ‚Äì all with shared bathrooms. It‚Äôs well located in Padungan, there are plenty of shops and restaurants close by. Breakfast is provided and Marco Polo can store your luggage if you‚Äôre heading off to visit Bako National Park overnight!\n\nThings to Do in Sarawak, Malaysia\n\n1. Visit Bako National Park üêí\n\nOne of Malaysia‚Äôs most popular national parks, Bako is a short journey from Kuching. Most travellers visit Bako National Park on a day trip but to get the most out of your visit, consider staying for at least one night. Accommodation in the park can only be booked through the Sarawak Forestry e-booking website but is surprisingly affordable. It‚Äôs around 50MYR (approx. $10USD) for a private ensuite room and just 15MYR (approx. $3USD) for a night in a dorm!\n\n‚ÄúBako is beautiful‚Ä¶accommodation is very basic but definitely worth going!!‚Äù\n\nColette, South East Asia Backpacker Community Member\n\nCovering an area of 27 square kilometres, Bako isn‚Äôt huge but its isolation means many endemic species still thrive here. Thanks to its varied terrain and elevation, the park comprises seven distinct ecosystems and is home to almost every species of plant found in Borneo!\n\nSeveral marked hiking trails make navigating the park a breeze ‚Äì although some of them are quite physically demanding! While it‚Äôs not an island, the only way to reach the Bako National Park peninsular is via boat ‚Äì there are no roads!\n\nTo get there, you‚Äôll need to hop on a bus from Kuching, then take a boat from the Bako office and pier. You also need to book the return boat before you leave for the park. Remember, if you share the boat (this will be cheaper), you must get the return boat with the same people ‚Äì use the bus as an opportunity to meet people and make sure you check when they are returning!\n\nOther National Parks Near Kuching:\n\nIf Bako doesn‚Äôt deliver enough national park goodness for your liking, consider visiting other parks near Kuching too!\n\nKubah National Park üå¥ ‚Äì Just half an hour from Kuching, Kubah National Park is popular among locals who come to enjoy the varied walking trails and incredible plant life. Kubah is especially well known for its palm trees!\n\nSantubong National Park ‚õ∞Ô∏è ‚Äì On a clear day, you can see the jagged peaks of Santubong from Kuching. The park makes for an adventurous day trip ‚Äì the trail up to the summit of Mt. Santubong itself is challenging but rewards you with amazing views of the surrounding coastline!\n\nKuching Wetlands National Park üêä ‚Äì 45 minutes from Kuching, the fascinating Wetlands National Park allows you to get in and about the amazing mangrove forest. Everything from saltwater crocs and river dolphins to proboscis monkeys and hornbills call this park home!\n\nGunung Gading National Park üå∫ ‚Äì A little further afield than the other national parks Gunung Gading takes around two hours to reach. It‚Äôs prime Rafflesia habitat and the world‚Äôs largest flowers are often in bloom here. Park rangers will lead you on a guided tour to find the flowers!\n\nTalang Satang National Park ü•ö ‚Äì Talang Satang National Park is a collection of islands off the coast of Kuching, many of which are so protected, you can‚Äôt visit at all. However, guided day trips can be arranged to see the turtle hatcheries that make these islands so special!\n\n2. See Orangutans at Semenggoh Wildlife Centre ü¶ß\n\nLocated less than an hour from Kuching, Semenggoh Wildlife Centre is an institution in Sarawak. Sure, it can be a busy spot but you don‚Äôt get the chance to see the ‚Äòman of the forest‚Äô very often! Those that live here are semi-wild, spending their days roaming the protected forest area and only returning to the HQ at feeding time. Most don‚Äôt return every day, instead feeding themselves in the jungle ‚Äì especially during fruiting season when food is abundant in the trees!\n\nAs well as orangutans, Semenggoh is home to giant and pygmy squirrels, gibbons and a vast array of birds ‚Äì keep your eyes peeled!\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something indescribable about seeing a creature so human-like, so expressive and acrobatic, swing through the trees, interacting with each other and cracking open coconuts. When we watched, a mother orangutan give her adult son a hug ‚Äì there was a collective ‚Äòawwwww‚Äô from everyone at the viewing platform.‚Äù\n\nKate, South East Asia Backpacker Contributor\n\n3. Take a Day Trip to Brunei üáßüá≥\n\nThe smallest country in Borneo and the second smallest in Southeast Asia, Brunei is often skipped over by travellers. The Sultanate offers a very different experience to the rest of the island. Most of the country‚Äôs rainforest is still intact and the capital city of Bandar Seri Begawan is like a miniature Singapore!\n\nI‚Äôd recommend spending more than a day getting to know the place but if you‚Äôre short on time, day trips can easily be arranged from Miri!\n\n4. Explore Some of Southeast Asia‚Äôs Best Caves ü¶á\n\nLocated between Miri and Bintulu ‚Äì just a two-hour drive from either, Niah National Park offers a veritable feast of Indiana Jones-esque adventures. There are various caves within the park, the most impressive being the Great Cave Complex and the Painted Cave.\n\nInside the Great Cave Complex, there‚Äôs evidence of ancient human habitation, dating back almost 40,000 years! This includes bones (both human and animal), tools, pottery and jewellery. Painted Cave features artwork dating back over a millennium as well as evidence of burial practices.\n\nThe caves are also famous for housing swiftlets, the nests of which are harvested for bird‚Äôs nest soup.\n\nNiah Caves aren‚Äôt the only exceptional caverns in Sarawak. Just half an hour from Kuching, you‚Äôll find Fairy and Wind Caves. Both of these have excellent boardwalks, allowing you to follow a safe route and experience the incredible limestone formations! Bring a torch ‚Äì the caves are not well-lit!\n\n5. Get off the Beaten Track in Gunung Mulu National Park ‚õ∞Ô∏è\n\nIf you‚Äôve not had your fill of caves just yet, Gunung Mulu National Park is the place for you. Limestone caverns litter the park, making up one of the largest cave complexes in the world! But it‚Äôs not all dark underground adventures in Mulu. The national park is also home to an array of self-guided hiking trails ‚Äì as well as plenty of challenging routes that require a guide. Some are short jaunts while others are multi-day adventures!\n\n‚ÄúHiking in Mulu National Park was amazing! I did the Pinnacles hike and you can do Mt Mulu as well. Also, the caves in Mulu NP were amazing to explore, either by walking or scrambling with a guide. The guides are all local, some descendents of the headhunters tribe and have many great stories to tell about their ancestors. Plus the whole park is full of wildlife and is very beautiful on the river and in the forest. Everything is very well organised and easy, you can book by e-mail, directly with the park office and plan your activities before you arrive. I spent 10 days there and it was a real highlight of my trip.‚Äù\n\nFee, South East Asia Backpacker Community Member\n\nThe simplest way to get to Mulu National Park is to fly from Miri, Kuching or even Kota Kinabalu. There are no roads connecting Mulu to the rest of Sarawak, so the only other option aside from flying is using a combination of boats and taxis ‚Äì however, this is a logistically challenging route that will take 12-24 hours and cost significantly more than flying.\n\nI‚Äôd recommend spending at least five days in Mulu to really make the most of this astounding national park!\n\n‚ÄúOur guide in Mulu, who we had to run at times to catch up with, actually took out a machete from his backpack as though it were as innocuous as a water bottle, and started slashing leaves from the path ahead. It was all very Indiana Jones.‚Äù\n\nKate, South East Asia Backpacker Contributor\n\n6. Get Lost in One of Southeast Asia‚Äôs Best Museums üèõÔ∏è\n\nThe Borneo Cultures Museum in Kuching is one of the finest museums I‚Äôve visited in Southeast Asia. Spread over five impressive floors, the museum shows off the history, ecology and culture of Sarawak and wider Borneo. Everything is well laid out with a range of interactive exhibits and plenty of space.\n\n7. Explore Lambir Hills National Park ü•æ\n\nA short journey from Miri, Lambir Hills National Park is a nice reminder that the city isn‚Äôt purely about oil and resource extraction. With at least ten marked trails, varying in length from 15 minutes to 5 hours, Lambir Hills gives you the chance to get up close to Sarawak‚Äôs amazing flora and fauna!\n\n8. Get off the Beaten Track in the Kelabit Highlands üõñ\n\nFly in a 16-seater otter plane from Miri ‚Äì or brave the 16-hour 4√ó4 ride ‚Äì to Bario.\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt ‚Äòend up‚Äô in Bario. There‚Äôs no ‚Äòfinding yourself here‚Äô. You‚Äôll only come if that was your intention in the first place. Not only is it hard to get to, it‚Äôs not even on the way anywhere else.‚Äù\n\nKaren, South East Asia Backpacker Contributor\n\nThere are trekking opportunities aplenty amidst the rolling hills of this beautiful region: you can trek from village to village through jungle and virgin rainforest, staying in homestays or longhouses as you go ‚Äì or opt for shorter adventures that include the two-hour trek from Bario up Prayer Mountain (particularly good for sunrise and sunset) and the hike up to the Bario Gap.\n\nVisit during July for the annual Bario Food Festival if you can. One important nugget of advice though ‚Äì book your seats on that plane early. They sell out quickly.\n\nRead More:The Kelabit Highlands, Borneo: Where Tradition and Globalization Meet\n\nFood and Drink in Sarawak üçú\n\nSarawak is chock-full of mouthwatering treats just waiting to meet your tastebuds! From locally grown whole grains to raw fish dishes, you‚Äôll find a vast array of delicious grub to try during your time in the state!\n\nWorld-renowned Bario Rice is a quintessential part of Sarawak culture. Grown in the Kelabit Highlands, this whole grain rice has exploded in global popularity thanks to its distinct sweet, nutty flavour. It goes great with chicken!\n\nUmai is another Sarawak classic you can‚Äôt miss. This raw fish dish is very similar to Peruvian ceviche with thin slices of raw fish served with slices of onion, chillies, salt and lime juice. It‚Äôs delicious!\n\n‚ÄúIf you ask me, umai is like ceviche, only better. Very similar in taste but often without the coriander (cilantro haters rejoice!), I couldn‚Äôt stop eating this in Sarawak! Make sure you check the coriander thing though, sometimes it‚Äôll be included as standard.‚Äù\n\nSheree, Editor at South East Asia Backpacker\n\nIf raw fish doesn‚Äôt take your fancy, Sarawak Laksa surely will. Laksa is a popular noodle soup across Malaysia and almost every region has its own take on the dish. In Sarawak, the laksa contains special rice vermicelli noodles, which are often described as chewy, although that doesn‚Äôt do their interesting texture justice. The soupy broth has an almost Thai flavour to it, sweet with a bit of kick and well-balanced with coconut milk.\n\nLinut is Sarawak‚Äôs answer to Bruneian Ambuyat. And by answer, I mean exactly the same but with a different name. Made from the interior of the sago palm, this bland starchy substance is very similar to tapioca. On its own, linut isn‚Äôt an appealing meal ‚Äì it tastes of nothing and has the texture of wallpaper paste. Where linut gets interesting is with the collection of delicious dipping options. Grab some linut using the special chopstick-esque tools and dive into what takes your fancy ‚Äì spicy sauces, dried fish and various cuts of meat are commonly served alongside.\n\nAfter your main meal, it‚Äôs time to sample tea and cake! Specifically the rainbow-layered sponge cake Kuih Lapis and Teh C Peng, Malaysia‚Äôs famous three-layer tea! And if that‚Äôs not enough, Kuching‚Äôs Ais Krim (ice cream) scene offers frozen dairy goodness for all those who seek it!\n\nGetting Around Sarawak ‚úàÔ∏è\n\nSarawak is huge. It‚Äôs roughly the same size as Greece and is the largest state in Malaysia. Due to its size, many travellers fly between cities but if you‚Äôve got the time, buses make for a cheaper (and more environmentally friendly) way of getting around.\n\nBus üöå\n\nBuses run regularly between most cities across the state. If you‚Äôre travelling a long way, like the Miri to Kuching route, don‚Äôt expect to be too comfortable. The roads aren‚Äôt great and the buses are kept at a classically Southeast Asian level of cold ‚Äì take a jumper! Despite this, they‚Äôre popular with travellers on a budget thanks to their low prices.\n\nPlane üõ©Ô∏è\n\nIn some cases, flying in Sarawak is unavoidable. Places like Miri or Bario are impossible or excruciatingly difficult to reach any other way. It‚Äôs also possible to fly between more accessible cities if you‚Äôre short on time.\n\nTaxis üöï\n\nTaxis are all over the place in Sarawak. Use Grab, one of Malaysia‚Äôs most popular ride-hailing apps, to arrange short-distance transport. It‚Äôs cheaper than trying to hail a cab on the street!\n\nBoat üö§\n\nWhether it‚Äôs islands off the coast or remote jungle lodges, some parts of Sarawak can only be reached by boat! You‚Äôll rarely need to organise this yourself though ‚Äì if you‚Äôre heading to a jungle lodge, they‚Äôll arrange your waterborne transport and the same is true for tours to the islands!\n\nCar Hire üöô\n\nHiring a car in Borneo gives you the freedom to explore at your own pace and get to some more logistically challenging locations. Many of Sarawak‚Äôs national parks can be very difficult to reach on public transport!\n\n‚ÄúDriving standards are pretty good in Borneo ‚Äì better than in other parts of Southeast Asia! The roads are usually okay and fuel is cheap! I really enjoyed driving in Borneo as it gave me so much freedom!‚Äù\n\nTim Ashdown, Writer at South East Asia Backpacker\n\nHow to Get to Sarawak üõ¨\n\nUnless you‚Äôre already in Borneo, the only way to get to Sarawak is by flying. You‚Äôll need to go through Kuala Lumpur or Singapore. Most flights go to Kuching but you can also fly into Miri and Sibu.\n\nFrom Sabah, you can get a bus into Sarawak but you‚Äôll need to pass through Brunei to do so. Due to the geography of Brunei, you‚Äôll pass in and out of the sultanate a few times on your journey, so you‚Äôre going to need a lot of pages free in your passport!\n\nWhere to Go Next: üõ´\n\nSabah: The northernmost state in Malaysian Borneo, Sabah is more frequented by tourists and has slightly better infrastructure than Sarawak. Don‚Äôt miss cruising on the epic Kinabatangan River, climbing Mt. Kinabalu or trekking in Kinabalu National Park!\n\nKuala Lumpur: Head to Peninsular Malaysia and the cosmopolitan capital of Kuala Lumpur where skyscrapers proudly stand next to tiny family-run food stalls. Climb the epic Petronas Towers for a bird‚Äôs eye view of the city and visit the sacred Batu Caves.\n\nSingapore: Another metropolitan city and a true cultural melting pot, Singapore is a fascinating place for travellers. Often considered an expensive place to travel, some of the best attractions in Singapore are actually free!\n\nContributors:\n\nSouth East Asia Backpacker is a ‚Äòtravel diary for everyone‚Äô.
