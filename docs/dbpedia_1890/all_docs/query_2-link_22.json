        "text": "Overview of Sabah Malaysian Borneo\n\nSabah, located in the northeastern part of Borneo, is a Malaysian state known for its beautiful scenery, diverse wildlife, and lively culture. The state has become known for its lush rainforests, towering mountains, and pristine beaches.\n\nKota Kinabalu, Sabah’s capital, serves as the entry point to the area. The city, located on the northwest coast and facing the South China Sea, is known for its thriving markets, dynamic street food scene, and the landmark Kota Kinabalu City Mosque. Sabah also has some of the best beaches in the region.\n\nIn addition to its natural beauty, Sabah is home to well-known animal rehabilitation centres, which help support regional conservation initiatives. The Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre is a highlight since it provides refuge for orphaned and injured orangutans, allowing them to recover and eventually return to the wild. Other important facilities are the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre and Turtle Islands Park, where conservation efforts are aimed at safeguarding sea turtles and their breeding places.\n\nWhat to see and do in Sabah, Borneo\n\nKota Kinabalu & Surrounds\n\nStart your exploration in Kota Kinabalu, the capital city of Sabah. Stroll along the bustling streets, marvel at the modern and colonial architecture, and experience the vibrant atmosphere of this coastal city.\n\nTanjung Aru Beach\n\nRelax and unwind at Tanjung Aru Beach, renowned for its stunning sunset views. This picturesque beach offers a tranquil escape with its soft sandy shores and clear blue waters. It’s far from the most beautiful beach in Borneo, but its right in Kota Kinabalu and the sunsets are amazing.\n\nTunku Abdul Rahman National Park\n\nGo Island hopping through Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park – Embark on a day of island-hopping through Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park, a marine park comprising five tropical islands. Snorkel in crystal-clear waters, relax on pristine beaches, and explore the vibrant underwater world.\n\nEat amazing Malaysian food at the street vendors\n\nIndulge your taste buds in the delicious Malaysian street food available throughout Kota Kinabalu. Sample local specialties such as satay, laksa, roti canai, and seafood dishes, which are abundant in flavors and spices.\n\nVisit the Kota Kinabalu City Mosque\n\nAlso known as the “Floating Mosque” due to its location surrounded by a reflective lagoon the KK city mosque is worth a visit. The mosque’s stunning architecture and serene surroundings make it a must-visit attraction.\n\nIf you are interested in more than just the Mosque, consider doing a full day tour of all the main sights of Kota Kinabalu.\n\nLocal handicraft markets\n\nExplore the vibrant local handicraft markets, such as the Kota Kinabalu Handicraft Market or the Gaya Street Sunday Market. These markets offer a wide array of traditional handicrafts, souvenirs, and local products, making them perfect for picking up unique souvenirs.\n\nClimb Mount Kinabalu\n\nClimbing Mount Kinabalu is a highlight for adventurers visiting Sabah, Borneo. Mount Kinabalu is Southeast Asia’s highest peak, standing at 4,095 meters (13,435 feet). It is part of Kinabalu Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The climb is a difficult but rewarding experience, with amazing views and a sense of accomplishment.\n\nThe climb typically starts at Timpohon Gate and takes climbers through diverse ecosystems, ranging from lush lowland rainforests to alpine meadows. The peak, known as Low’s Peak, is reached in the early morning, usually before sunrise. Climbers have a breathtaking panoramic view as the sun bathes the area in golden hues. The feeling of standing on the highest point in Borneo, surrounded by clouds and gorgeous peaks, is truly breathtaking.\n\nClimbing Mount Kinabalu requires a permit, and it is best to book the climb through accredited tour operators. The climb is divided into two days, including an overnight stop in one of the mountain huts. It is important to be physically prepared, as the altitude and changeable weather conditions may be challenging.\n\nI did really love this climb and while it is very steep, its not awful. I wasn’t looking forward to it as I had only had my Achilles reconstructed about 8 months before this but you climb very slowly and there is enough diversity that you calves and quads can cope with the pace. We had people in our group that hadn’t done anything in preparation and while they were very sore the next day they made it ok.\n\nVisit Sandakan (especially for Chinese New Year)\n\nSandakan, a beach town in Sabah, Borneo, is a fascinating combination of rich cultural heritage and historical landmarks. Especially around Chinese New Year, the town transforms into a colorful celebration hub, adding a festive appeal to its attractions.\n\nAgnes Keith House\n\nVisit the Agnes Keith House, a historical colonial-era residence that once belonged to Agnes Newton Keith, an American author. Explore the well-preserved house, which offers insights into the region’s history and the life of the author.\n\nPuu Jih Syh Temple\n\nPuu Jih Syh Temple, perched on a hill, is a significant Chinese Buddhist temple in Sandakan. The temple provides a peaceful retreat, and its elevated location offers panoramic views of Sandakan Bay and the surrounding areas.- During Chinese New Year, you may witness cultural festivities within the complex.\n\nDragon Dance for Chinese New Year in Sandakan\n\nSandakan War Memorial\n\nPay your respects at the Sandakan War Memorial, dedicated to the memory of those who suffered during the Sandakan Death Marches in World War II. The memorial stands as a reminder of the historical events that took place in the region. While it might seem like its not much, if you do a tour and get a good guide they explain really well what happened in the region and lots of personal stories around the war.\n\nI’m never great at war history (I cried my way around the War Remnants Museum in Vietnam and Japan’s Hiroshima Peace Museum) but I always think its the right thing to do to pay your respects.\n\nBuli Sim Sim Water Village\n\nExplore the Buli Sim Sim Water Village, a traditional stilted village situated along Sandakan Bay. Wander through wooden walkways, observe the unique architecture, and gain insight into the daily lives of the local community. With the right tour group you will get into one of the homes and have tea with the family which is a great experience.\n\nThis does involve taking a boat across the bay from Sandakan and while it isn’t that far it can get quite rough. I personally thought it was fine, but others on our boat were very uncomfortable. It is safe, but if you aren’t experienced with boats just be warned it can be rugged.\n\nI think the best way to experience this is on a half or full day Sandakan Tour. This will allow you to do the War Memorial, visit the local markets, have some lunch and also visit the Muslim Sim-Sim Village.\n\nGomantong Caves\n\nThe Gomantong Caves are famous for their unique environment, abundant biodiversity, and the traditional harvesting of swiftlet nests, a prized ingredient in Chinese bird’s nest soup. It is made up of two main caves: Simud Hitam (Black Cave) and Simud Putih. The caves are situated on Gomantong Hill, which is part of the Gomantong Forest Reserve.\n\nOne of the highlights of Gomantong Caves is the swiftlet population that nests within the cave systems. Swiftlet nests, which are made with their saliva, are gathered for culinary and medicinal purposes. Locals enter the caves twice a year, during specified harvesting seasons, braving the darkness and guano-covered surfaces to gather nests. This historic technique has been passed down through generations and is strictly monitored to ensure sustainability.\n\nVisitors can explore the caves on guided tours, which provide insights into the geological formations, the delicate ecosystem, and the cultural significance of the swiftlet nests. While the caves are open year-round, it’s advisable to check the local regulations and tour availability before planning a visit.\n\nStay at a lodge on the Kinabatangan River\n\nStaying at a lodge on the Kinabatangan River in Sabah, Borneo, is an unforgettable experience that immerses visitors in the region’s rich wildlife and lush scenery. These riverside accommodations provide a cozy hideaway along the riverbanks.\n\nThe Kinabatangan River is famous for its abundant wildlife, and lodges provide an ideal base for wildlife safaris. Guided boat tours, a highlight of the Kinabatangan experience, take guests deep into the rainforest and wetlands.\n\nEarly morning and late afternoon excursions offer excellent opportunities for spotting proboscis monkeys, pygmy elephants, and a variety of bird species. Aside from wildlife adventures, lodges actively engage in conservation efforts and environmental education.\n\nYou may participate in guided walks or talks, gaining insights into the importance of preserving this unique ecosystem and the challenges faced by local wildlife. To make the most of the Kinabatangan experience, consider booking a multi-day package that includes guided safaris, meals, and accommodations.\n\nWe had amazing luck here and spotted a herd of pygmy elephants in the jungle on our walk down to a local lake. Another group were lucky enough to see them get in and swim across the river!\n\nOur chance came one afternoon when we saw a huge male Orangutan making his nest for the night in the trees. It was just incredible to experience such a wonderful thing. I do have a video but because we were on a boat on the river we are bobbing around like crazy so this photo will have to do.\n\nYou can take a one day trip from Sandakan to Kinabatangan River which is about 10 hours long, however I would recommend you do a multiday tour. It was the early morning and evening boat trips where we saw most of our wildlife. The lodges range in accommodation levels but all are safe and are for the most part inclusive of all meals.\n\nI stayed at Bilit Rainforest Lodge and it was fine. It is one of the more budget oriented ones but great for what it is.\n\nMultiday Tours for River Lodges On the Kinabatangan River\n\nWildlife Experiences in Sabah\n\nSabah offers a variety of unique and diverse experiences with some of the world’s most iconic wildlife. Among the most notable wildlife encounters, the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Center near Sandakan is worth visiting. This sanctuary is dedicated to the rehabilitation of orphaned and injured orangutans, and visitors may see these primates up close at feeding times and as they walk freely around the area.\n\nThe Proboscis Monkey Centre at Labuk Bay provides an opportunity to interact with indigenous proboscis monkeys. These endangered monkeys, known for their large, pendulous noses and potbellies, may be seen in their native environment from elevated platforms.\n\nThe Bornean Sun Bear Protection Center in Sepilok is committed to the well-being and protection of the world’s smallest bear species, the Bornean Sun Bear. Visitors may explore the center’s natural forest environment and see rescued sun bears engage in recreational activities.\n\nSelingan Turtle Islands, located near Sandakan, offer a one-of-a-kind refuge for endangered sea turtles. As part of the Turtle Islands Park, these islands serve as vital nesting grounds, allowing visitors to witness the incredible sight of female turtles coming ashore to lay their eggs. Guided tours offer an amazing experience, allowing you to see the hatching and release of newborn turtles into the sea.\n\nWhat to see and do in Sarawak, Borneo\n\nKuching City\n\nEmbark on a captivating journey through Kuching, the vibrant capital of Sarawak.\n\nCycle tour around Kuching\n\nExplore the charming city of Kuching on two wheels with a cycle tour. This allows you to leisurely navigate through the city streets. Many tour operators offer guided cycling excursions, so make sure you book one ahead.\n\nEat along the waterfront\n\nIndulge in culinary offerings along Kuching’s scenic waterfront. The waterfront is lined with cafes, food stalls, and restaurants serving a variety of local and international cuisines. Sample Sarawak laksa, a local specialty, or enjoy fresh seafood while taking in views of the Sarawak River.\n\nGo to Bako National Park\n\nPlan a day trip to Bako National Park, which is accessible by boat from Kuching. This national park supports a variety of ecosystems, including mangrove swamps, dipterocarp forests, and gorgeous beaches. Hiking trails lead to unique geological formations, wildlife sightings, and panoramic viewpoints.\n\nCheck out my article on going to Bako from Kuching, or alternatively if you would like to be a little lazy about it, consider doing one of the day trips below.\n\nFort Margherita\n\nVisit Fort Margherita, an iconic historical landmark on the Sarawak River. Built in the 19th century, the fort has served various purposes throughout history and now houses a museum.\n\nKuching Chinatown\n\nImmerse yourself in Kuching’s Chinatown, which consists of narrow streets, traditional shophouses, and bustling markets. Discover Chinese temples, sample local cuisines from street vendors, and browse stores selling everything from antiques to traditional crafts.\n\nSarawak Cultural Village\n\nFor a cultural immersion, visit the Sarawak Cultural Village, located just outside Kuching. This living museum showcases the diverse indigenous cultures of Sarawak, allowing visitors to experience traditional longhouse living, witness cultural performances, and participate in hands-on activities.\n\nGunung Mulu National Park\n\nGunung Mulu National Park, located in Malaysian Borneo, is a UNESCO World Heritage site known for its stunning karst formations, cave systems, and outstanding biodiversity. Mulu has no roads; therefore, fly-in, fly-out access is an important feature of the park\n\nThe park provides a variety of hiking opportunities, with trails catering to different fitness levels and interests. Visitors may discover Mulu’s natural beauty through hikes via lush rainforests to challenging climbs leading to panoramic views. Notably, the Pinnacles Trail is known for its challenging climb and breathtaking views of the park’s limestone formations.\n\nGunung Mulu National Park is also home to one of the world’s largest cave systems. Clearwater Cave, Deer Cave, and Wind Cave are three of the most impressive caves accessible to tourists. Deer Cave, in particular, is well-known for its vast size and hosts the magnificent nightly bat exodus, in which millions of bats emerge from the cave. In addition to the caves, the Canopy Skywalk provides visitors with a different perspective of the rainforest.\n\nThe park offers different levels of accommodation from bunk houses to private lodges, home stays in the area and even a Marriot Hotel right next to the park. Brad bought me a few nights at the Marriot as a surprise and it was amazing to be in such a beautiful hotel after months of hostels.\n\nI would recommend booking your hikes, caving adventures and other guided tours before you get there. They have a great online system and its worth securing the tours you want to do before you arrive. They can fill up fast. There are many you don’t have to book for, like the Deer Cave or just hikes in the area, but a lot of the cave tours are guided and you do need to book.\n\nThe Pinnacles Hike At Gunung Mulu National Park\n\nIf you are looking at doing the Pinnacles hike you MUST have a decent level of fitness and leg strength. There is a point of no return that they will not take you past if you aren’t fit enough. Its not excessively aerobic but its a tough hike and jelly legs are the order of the day!\n\nVisit Miri a Small City on the Coast\n\nMiri, a small coastal town, not only has its own unique attractions but also acts as a gateway to nearby adventures. The proximity to Brunei makes it ideal for a day or two trip into the neighboring country.\n\nGo into Brunei for a day or two from Miri\n\nMiri’s proximity to Brunei makes it ideal for a day or two trip into the neighboring country. You can visit the capital, Bandar Seri Begawan, which is famous for its grand mosques, the Istana Nurul Iman (the Sultan’s Palace), and the iconic Omar Ali Saifuddien mosque. Immerse yourself in Brunei’s rich culture, visit the Royal Regalia Museum, and relax in the Kampong Ayer Water Village.\n\nNiah Caves\n\nVisit the Niah Caves, located not far from Miri. The caves are well-known for their archeological significance, including traces of early human habitation dating back thousands of years. Explore the caves and see old cave paintings while admiring the limestone formations. The Niah National Park has hiking routes where you can admire the surrounding rainforest and its unique flora and wildlife.\n\nSee the cliffs of Tusan Beach\n\nVisit Tusan Beach to witness the stunning cliffs that are especially beautiful after sunset (or the bioluminescence in season). The beach is known for its unique landscape, featuring tall cliffs that create a captivating seascape. Additionally, if you visit during the right season, you might have the chance to experience the bioluminescence phenomenon in the water.\n\nVisit the Miri-Sibuti Coral Reefs National Park to learn about the local marine life. This park is home to magnificent coral reefs, rich marine life, and beautiful beaches.\n\nThere are many day tours available from Miri.
