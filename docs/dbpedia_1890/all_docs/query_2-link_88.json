        "text": "A state capital, Kuching offers access to the surrounding landscape on a range of eco-tours through national parks and reserves also home to many conservation projects set up to protect Borneo's population of primates. Kuching attractions include ethnographic, natural history, and art museums. Batang Ai is a special place where visitors can experience the rainforest and learn about Iban cultural traditions. The local communities have a vibrant living culture with a fascinating history that they are keen to share with the world.\n\nWalk into the old town of Kuching, look at the hybrid architecture of Chinese shophouses and colonial-era buildings. On the outskirts at Batang Ai, meet the local Iban community at their famous longhouses. Taste the local rice wine (Tuak) and try your hand at handling the traditional blowpipe. In the trip, we will visit the Semenggoh Orang Utan Rehabilitation Centre and spend another day to Bako National Park; a primary forest that shelters many natural treasures.\n\n9:00 AM meet at hotel, then proceed for Kuching city tour. Journey to Civic Centre Tower for a panoramic view of the city, then drive through villages with traditional houses. Get a view of the majestic former state mosque before stopping to take a walk along Gambier Street, where the markets are. Lastly, at Kuching Waterfront, you can see the Astana across the river. See the old colonial Court House with the Clock Tower and a granite obelisk, before transfer back to hotel.\n\nAt 8:00 AM, visit the Semenggoh Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre. The entire facility occupies an area of 740 acres, which serves as a sanctuary for Orangutans in the only remaining green belt near the city. The main attraction is undeniably the Rehabilitation Centre; a temporary home for displaced Orangutans and young orphaned primates that have been rescued from captivity. Depart for Batang Ai. Upon arrival, you will be ferried across to the resort. Time at leisure to explore your surroundings.\n\nBreakfast. Return to the mainland for transfer to the Engkari River to board native longboats and visit an Iban Longhouse. The highlight of the tour is the traditional welcome with women in ceremonial regalia and a performance of the Ngajat dance. Tuak, the local rice wine, is served and you will have a chance to try your hand at handling the blowpipe. Lunch is at the longhouse before returning to the city, arriving late evening.\n\nBreakfast. At 8:30 AM, depart for Bako National Park. The park is an area of primary forest with an abundance of botanical treasures, including the carnivorous pitcher plant. Bakoâ€™s mangrove forest is home to the Proboscis Monkey, found only in Borneo. Other species found here are the Long-Tailed Macaques, Silver Leaf Monkeys, Monitor Lizards and Bearded Pigs. Lunch at the park canteen. Return to Kuching in the afternoon or transfer to airport for your onward flight."
