        "text": "Miri\n\nMalaysia\n\nMiri, port city, East Malaysia, on the South China Sea coast of northwestern Borneo. It lies south of Baram Point and a short distance west of the sultanate of Brunei in a rubber- and rice-growing region. The town began in 1911, when nearby oil fields were opened. Peak production came in the 1930s; the fields declined, but discoveries were later made offshore at Salbiah. Lutong, just to the north, has a refinery and is linked by pipeline to Brunei’s Seria field. Because of site obstruction, the oil is transferred to tankers 3 miles (5 km) offshore by a submarine pipe. Miri lies on the coastal road south of Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of Brunei. A large portion of the city’s population is Chinese. Pop. (2000 est.) 140,000."
