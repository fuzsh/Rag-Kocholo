        "text": "Malaysia's Geography\n\nMalaysia sits on the South China Sea in the center of Southeast Asia. The country is crescent- shaped, starting with Peninsular Malaysia (West Malaysia) and extends to another region, Sabah and Sarawak (East Malaysia), located on the island of Borneo. The total area of Malaysia is approximately 330,000 square km, with most of it located on the island of Borneo. Peninsular Malaysia only comprises approximately 40% of the total area.\n\nMalaysia's climate is hot and humid with relative humidity ranging from 80 - 90 percent, except in the highlands. The temperature averages from 70-90 degrees F (20-30 degrees C) throughout the year. The tropical climate is experienced year-round with the rainy season varying on the coasts of Peninsular Malaysia. The west coast has it's rainy season from September through December with the east coast (and Sarawak and Sabah) experiencing it's from October through February. East Malaysia (the northern slopes) get up to 5080 mm of rain a year versus West Malaysia's 2500 mm.\n\nThere are forests covering over half of Malaysia, with notable tropical forests in Sabah and Sarawak. Deforestation is a problem the country is dealing with due to logging and hydroelectric projects."
