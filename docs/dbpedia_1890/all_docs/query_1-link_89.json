        "text": "Sarawak Map\n\nMap of Southeast Asia\n\nMalaysia\n\nIndonesia\n\nAttention:\n\nBecause we drove the current first part below from Miri in Malaysia to Pontianak in Indonesia already in October/November 2006, which is published on the website Borneo (see pic # 26-51) as well as the first Indonesia Trip Part 1 (see pic # 49-54), we won't show now anymore so many photos from this stretch. Though we shall see new land between Pontianak and Kumai. However also the current second part  the sector from Kumai to Balikpapan  is a repetition for us (July 2007) and can be seen on the site Indonesia Trip Part 6 (see pic # 2-34). Links are in the captures. New land for us is definitively from picture #31 onwards.\n\nlatest picture: October 18, 2017\n\nclick a picture to see details\n\n001 Departure from our MCity Apartment\n\nin Miri/Sarawak/East Malaysia on the Island\n\nof Borneo. It was our pleasant \"home\" during\n\nthe 3rd rejuvenation of our LandCruiser .....\n\n002 ..... where we experienced\n\nmagnificent sunsets from our\n\nbalcony on the 3rd floor\n\n003 Is there a lovelier lighthouse\n\nthan the seahorse at Miri's Marina,\n\nwhich is the towns mascot?\n\n004 The three of us in front of Miri's\n\nfamous landmark  the seahorse  at\n\nour departure to the South from\n\nnorthern Sarawak\n\n005 A traditional longhouse of the Dayak\n\nin Sarawak, here before Sibu. At Sungai Asap\n\nnear Bintulu  the longest longhouse  up to\n\n100 families live under the same roof but have\n\ndifferent doorways from the communal terrace\n\n006 Our LandCruiser at the 100 years old\n\nTua Pek Kong Temple along the Rajang\n\nRiver in Sibu. With its 7-storey pagoda it\n\nis an impressive landmark of the town\n\n007 On the coastal road to Kuching through Pusa\n\nand Sebuyau our LandCruiser drives off one of the\n\ntwo ferries that connect this route. Both of the two\n\nferries cost amazingly only 1 Ringgit (= US$ 0.20).\n\nAlthough the distance from Sibu to Kuching in\n\nsouthern Sarawak is therefore about 60 miles\n\n[100km] shorter, the time remains about the same\n\ndue to the two river crossings\n\n008 Emil enjoys our picnic of satay sticks\n\nwith beer at the camping table below a shady\n\njackfruit tree along Maludam National Park,\n\nwhich cannot be classified as spectacular from\n\nthe roadside view, because it can be entered\n\nonly with difficulties (flat peat swamp forest)\n\n009 While Miri in northern Sarawak has\n\nthe seahorse as mascot, Kuching is the city\n\nof the cats. Cute and funny cat monuments\n\nare scattered in and around Sarawak's\n\ncapital in the South of the Malaysian\n\nstate on the Island of Borneo. Here the\n\nmost important in the East of the old city\n\n(South City Council)\n\n010 Another enjoyable cute cat monument\n\n a whole family  in Kuching, the city of\n\ncats. Actually there are three in the old city:\n\nEast (South City Council), center and West\n\n(North City Council)\n\n011 Kuching's most striking 9-storied building\n\n the \"Sarawak State Assembly\" with its\n\ndistinctive \"payung\" (umbrella) roof \n\nsits on the northern shore of the Sarawak\n\nRiver and was opened on July 27th, 2009\n\n012 The pedestrian zone of the \"India\n\nStreet\" in an old area of the city of Kuching\n\nis lined with shops selling all kind of stuff,\n\nparticularly textiles. Its special roofing\n\nwas completed in 2016\n\n013 9/6/2017: We celebrate our easy-going\n\n531st border crossing, this time from Tebedu/\n\nMalaysia to Entikong/Indonesia with an\n\nIndonesian Bintang beer. All we get is one\n\nwith 0.0% alcohol. Bleak prospects  finished\n\nwith Malaysian Tiger and Tiger Radler!\n\n014 The new Tayan Bridge between\n\nTayan (North) and Piasak (South) over\n\nthe mighty Kapuas River in West\n\nKalimantan is announcing\n\nitself in huge letters .....\n\n015 ..... the bridge is part of the Trans\n\nKalimantan Highway and connects West\n\nBorneo with Central Borneo. It was opened\n\non May 22, 2016. It is the longest bridge\n\nin Borneo with a length of 6'480 ft [1'975m]\n\n016 9/7/2017: About 3 miles [5km] North of\n\nthe Tayan bridge over the Kapuas River in West\n\nKalimantan, we cross the Equator from the northern\n\nto the southern hemisphere for the 20th time,thereof\n\n14 times with our LandCruiser. Nothing indicates\n\nlatitude 0°, just the Garmin GPS shows us the spot\n\n017 A settlement along the relatively new\n\nTrans Kalimantan Highway that leads more\n\nthan 250 miles [>400km] through lush tropical\n\nvegetation. From here until Pangkalanbun, it is\n\nnew land for us. This stretch wasn't\n\ndriveable in 2007 due to heavy rain\n\n018 An Indonesian lady protects\n\nherself from the scorching Equator\n\nsun with an umbrella\n\n019 One of the ten landslides on the 1'150 ft.\n\n[350m] high hill passage from West to Central\n\nKalimantan. They are all more recent, but already\n\npassable again. With it the most attractive and\n\nstill mostly untouched part of the improved\n\nTrans Kalimantan Highways ends\n\n020 The huge plant fronds emerging\n\nfrom the tropical vegetation\n\nare always eye-catching\n\n021 A narrow but one of the many slow-\n\nmoving brown jungle rivers in Kalimantan,\n\nfringed by luxury tropical vegetation.\n\nIt has a kind of inscrutable appearance\n\n022 Surprise, surprise! Is this not a shop with\n\nREAL beer? While driving through a bigger\n\ntown Emil discovers the piled up Bintang cases.\n\nHopefully better days are ahead!\n\n023 This monumental mosque stays in the city\n\nof Sampit in Central Kalimantan. Such huge\n\nbuildings can be found everywhere, as Islam\n\nis the main religion in Kalimantan: West 59%,\n\nCentral 74%, South 96%, East 85%, North 65%\n\n024 One of the many swiftlet fortresses, besides\n\npalm oil another lucrative business. Swiftlet's nests\n\nare collected and sold to China. They are a Chinese\n\ndelicacy. 1lb = about 55 nests cost up to US$725\n\n[1kg/120 nests US$1'600], depending on quality\n\n025 During a short stopover on our roller coaster\n\nride from South to East Kalimantan a father takes\n\na picture from us, while his family is enjoying it.\n\nSmartphones are just everywhere!\n\n026 The crossing from South to East Kalimantan\n\nis a constant roller coaster ride through luxurious\n\ntropical green. Up to now it is the slowest stretch\n\ndue to the holey bad road condition\n\n027 It never takes long for kids to spot our\n\nspecial looking LandCruiser. Somehow it doesn't\n\nfit into their normal scene; therefore their\n\nastonishment is always obvious\n\n028 At the ferry terminal of Penajam with its\n\npretty backdrop of stilt houses we take our\n\n1st ferry across the Balikpapan Bay to\n\nKariangau near Balikpapan\n\n029 The ferry ride on board of the 21-year-\n\nold KMP Dharma Ferry was our 300th\n\nshipping during the past almost 33 years and\n\nlasted for the 4.2 miles [6.8km] one hour.\n\nCost Rp. 269'500 (US$21.50)\n\n030 Kariangau/Balikpapan is greeting us\n\nwith the attractive scenery of Balikpapan  a\n\nbig city with a population of more than 700'000\n\n031 The lights of the city of Balikpapan are\n\nalready switched on when we leave Kalimantan\n\non board of the ferry KMP Tuna (24 years old)\n\nand make ourselves comfortable for the 22 hours/\n\n232 miles [374km] long crossing through the\n\nMakassar Strait to the island of Sulawesi .....\n\n032 ..... the crew is cheerful and hopes\n\nthat they will catch a big fish during the\n\ncalm sea journey, which unfortunately\n\ndoes not happen .....\n\n033 ..... the jetty in Taipa, about 10 miles\n\n[16km] north of Palu  the capital of Central\n\nSulawesi  comes in sight. We \"survived\" the\n\ncrossing at calm sea carrying only few\n\npassengers and vehicles\n\n034 Sunday morning in Palu: Families enjoy\n\nthemselves at the stony seashore. Eateries\n\nspring up. At lunchtime, when it is getting\n\nsticky hot, the beach is deserted again\n\n035 Children obviously have much\n\nfun in their rubber dinghy watched\n\nby their parents\n\n036 The renter of car's inner tubes in Palu is\n\npacking up. He manages to cram up to 16 of\n\nthe inflated tubes onto his motorbike\n\n037 Thundery atmosphere across Palu Bay.\n\nSheltered by mountain ridges, Palu itself is\n\nregarded as the driest location in Indonesia\n\n038 Palu's white horse monument\n\nat the beach front contrasts with\n\nthe dark mountain backdrop\n\n039 The floating Arqam Bab Al Rahman\n\nMosque in Palu. It was inaugurated in 2012\n\nby the Governor of Central Sulawesi\n\n040 It is sizzling at every street corner.\n\nHere a lady is scooping fried\n\nbananas from her pan\n\n041 Bride and groom are posing for\n\ntheir photographer and smile as well\n\ninto our camera\n\n042 Three school girls in their Muslim outfit\n\nare waiting to be picked up from school. 77% of\n\nthe population of Central Sulawesi are Muslim\n\n043 Just on Liliana's birthday our LandCruiser\n\nsurprises us with its 188th flat tire. Emil is\n\nfetching the spare tire from the roof\n\n044 Not everyday a foreigner is changing\n\na tire.
