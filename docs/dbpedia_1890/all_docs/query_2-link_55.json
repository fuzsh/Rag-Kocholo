        "text": "Malaysia is a federal country composed of 11 states in West Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia), two states in East Malaysia (Borneo Island) and three federated territories (Kuala Lumpur, Labuan and Putrajaya). Sarawak, located in the northwestern coast of Borneo Island, is the largest state in Malaysia, with 26 tribes and a population of 2.6 million.\n\nSarawak is a rich repository of cultural and biological diversity. The rich intangible cultural heritage of Sarawak’s various ethnicities illustrates the cultural diversity, and the natural world heritage, such as its ancient tropical forests, caves and ocean, provides habitats for a variety of species.\n\nPuak Kumbu, which means Iban (Puak) blanket (Kumbu), is an intangible cultural heritage that is most representative of the Iban tribe. Traditionally, it was used more for ceremonial purposes than for everyday life. Puak Kumbu symbolizes the birth of a newborn baby, and was merged with Iban tribe’s traditional rituals and used to receive head offerings during the headhunting tradition or covering the dead during Gawai Antu, a festival for the departed souls.\n\nThe production of Puak Kumbu was a kind of ritual in and of itself, and the masters were regarded highly within the society. Masters design Puak Kumbus with inspiration from their dreams, and the designs are composed of various motifs from the Iban tribe. Following Iban traditions, beginners are only allowed to work on simple designs, and only experienced masters are able to create elaborate designs by combining different motifs. Since Puak Kumbus require a high level of care to preserve them well, traditional knowledge on storing them has been passed down through generations.\n\nPlatform Archive Link (Puak Kumbu)\n\nWhile no one knows the origin of Ngajat for sure, it is estimated to have been around since the 16th century. Ngajat was the dance of the warriors returning from the war. In present day, Ngajat is performed at Gawaj, the most important harvest festival, to welcome important guests at Longhouse. Male dancers wear headgear with a large feather, and hold chains, marbles, a rope called cawat and a long shield, while female dancers wear elaborately decorated headdress, chains, marbles and a knee-length dress. Ngajat is performed showcasing male dancers’ dramatic jumps.\n\nThe music for Ngajat is performed by Malaysian traditional instruments, such as the ‘enkeromong’, ‘bendai’, ‘canang’ and ‘dumbak or ketebong’. Ngajat’s repertoire includes Ngajat Induk, Ngajat bebunoh, Ngajat Lesong, Ngajat Semain, Ngajat Berayah, Ngaja Ngemai Antu Pala, etc.\n\nPlatform Archive Link (The Ngajat Dance)\n\nSape, Sarawak’s most representative instrument, is played at special occasions and rituals, such as weddings, births, harvests and rain ceremonies. Sape is also used as accompaniment for traditional dances, such as Ngajat and Datun Julud. For performances in which Sapes are the main instrument, they are played together with Jatung Utang, wooden zylophones; for dance accompaniment, two Sapes are used, one tuned to a higher tone and one to a lower tone. Performers create their own variations and pass down the tradition of Sape performances. Sape is an intangible cultural heritage that is passed down from generation to generation through music.\n\nPlatform ICH Story Link (The Healing Sound of Sarawak: A Review of Sape)\n\nDatan Julud is a traditional dance passed down in the Orang Ulu tribe, and is called by many names: “Long Dance” in Kenyah, “Hivan Joh” in Kayan and “Arang Kadang” in Kelabit. It is said that Datun Julud was created to express a Kenyah prince’s happiness and gratitude.\n\nDatun Julud was traditionally performed as a ritual or at ceremonies by the Orang Ulu women in Borneo. Dancers hold accessories made with feathers of sacred birds and dance to Sape’s beautiful tunes, with elegant movements.\n\nNowadays, Datun Julud is performed to welcome visitors to Sarawak and its traditional culture, presenting visitors with an unforgettable experience.\n\nPlatform Archive Link (Datun Julud)\n\nKendang, Malaysia’s traditional drum, is a traditional musical instrument from Sarawak. While Kendang tradition is commonly believed to have started in the early 19th century during the Brooke dynasty, some say that it was actually started in the 15th century when Islamics first arrived at Borneo Island. Kendangs, also known as “Sarawak Malay Drums”, play a vital role during traditional wedding ceremonies, inviting village people to come and join in the festivities.\n\nKendang craftsmen use goat hide and rattan to make Kendangs. To make a Kendang, a craftsman selects goat hide of good quality, then selects pieces of rattan and trims them so that they are all the same size and shape. To create a Kendang with good patterns and designs, all rattan pieces must be trimmed into the same size. Kendang craftsmen, in their own unique ways, usually mark the spot that would make the best sound when rapped on. When the sound does not meet satisfactory levels, craftsmen try their utmost to create Kendangs of best quality by fixing ends of the rattan to the drum.\n\nThere are several kinds of Kendang performances, including solo performances, or Pukulan Induk, or ensemble performances, such as Pukulan Nanak and Pukulan Tingkah. Kendang performances usually compose of duet performers, or can be performed as an ensemble of three or four performers or also with violins or accordians.\n\nPlatform Archive Link (Gendang Melayu Sarawak)\n\nSarawak Folk Village is Malaysia's most representative cultural attraction, where visitors can get a glimpse of the culture and life of various ethnic minority tribes.
