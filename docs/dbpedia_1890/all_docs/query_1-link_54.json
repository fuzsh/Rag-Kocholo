It's our 3rd ferry trip in\n\nIndonesia. The commercial center of the northern\n\nMaluku group (Ternate and Tidore) appears\n\n210 Ternate with the near-conical volcano\n\nGamalama 5'627 ft. [1'715m] is our first North\n\nMoluccan island. It's greeting with a beautiful cap\n\nof white clouds, measures 43 sq.mi. [111km²],\n\ncounts about 210'000 people and the road\n\naround it is barely 30 miles [50km] long\n\n211 We are welcomed on the bridge of the\n\nrelatively new ASDP ferry Portlink VIII\n\n(built 2016), where the captain offers us a coffee\n\n212 Happy are the ones, who are able to grab\n\nfor the night-time sea journey a sleeping mat.\n\nAfter the captains intervention, we are\n\nalso among them. There are no cabins\n\n213 Actually I would rather be in the\n\nair than on the water  a white cockatoo\n\n(Cacatua alba), which is amazingly quiet\n\n214 Our ship is approaching after a 15 hours,\n\n167 miles [268km] long but quiet sea journey the\n\nASDP ferry terminal Bastiong of Ternate. South\n\nof it (on the picture) are the contours of the island\n\nof Tidore (5'676 ft. [1'730m]), in the front the\n\n1'266 ft. [386m) tall Maitare Island\n\n215 Equipped with his camera, Emil is\n\nstanding at the railing of the ferry putting himself\n\nin the right mood for the spice island of Ternate\n\n216 Settlements are sprinkled particularly on\n\nthe east and south side on the coastal slopes\n\nof the tropical volcanic island of Ternate. Its\n\nvolcano Gamalama is pretty active; it was\n\nsince 2012 through all the years restless\n\nwith smoke, ashes and earth tremors\n\n217 On 11/17/2017, 11am, our ferry berths\n\nat the port of Bastiong in Ternate. Emil is\n\nwaiting his turn to drive ashore\n\n218 The time cas come: Our LandCruiser\n\nis able to leave the hull of the ferry after\n\n20 minutes and drives onto new territory: The\n\nNorth Moluccas or also called North Maluku\n\n219 Houses on stilts line the shore\n\nof Ternates ferry terminal of Bastiong\n\n220 We enjoy the view from the 6th floor\n\nof the Muara Hotel in Ternate of the near-\n\nconical, 5'627 ft. [1715m] high Gamalama\n\nvolcano that dominates the city ..\n\n221 .. one of the many impressive mosques\n\non the tropical slope dominating Ternate  an\n\nancient Islamic Sultanate.

Ternate first\n\nof all, but also the whole province of North\n\nMaluku, is predominantly Muslim\n\n225 Ternate City spreads along the seashore.\n\nThe perfectly shaped peak in the background\n\nis the volcano Kiematabu (5'676 ft. [1'730m])\n\non the island of Tidore\n\n226 Kedaton  the former Sultans Palace\n\nwas built in 1796 and is now converted into a\n\nmuseum (since the death of the last sultan in\n\n2015 'temporarily' closed)\n\n227 Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix, Michael\n\nJackson, B.B. King, Nelson Mandela und\n\nMartin Luther King (fltr) are greeting from a house\n\nwall opposite of the Sultans Palace of Ternate\n\n228 Domes and minarets (front Al-Muttaqien\n\nand back Raya Al Munawwar) dominate the\n\ntownscape of Ternate \n\nhere in direction Southwest\n\n229 Liliana at Tolukko Fort. It was built\n\nby the Portuguese in the 16th century to\n\ncontrol the trade of gloves. From its seaside\n\ncliff it offers superb views ..\n\n230 .. to the forest covered slopes\n\nof the still active Gamalama volcano\n\nwith its scattered settlements ..\n\n231 .. and across the rusty corrugated\n\niron roofs of Ternate towards\n\nthe island of Halmahera\n\n232 Batu Angus (burnt rocks) was formed\n\nby a lava flow from an eruption of the\n\nGamalama volcano in 1673 ..\n\n233 .. the lava flu into the sea and\n\ncontinued under water for quite a distance ..\n\n234 .. An asphalted path leads\n\nthrough the bizarre lava region\n\n235 Christian sisters seek shade at one of\n\nthe pavilions at Batu Angus. Heat can get\n\nunbearable within the black lava formations\n\n236 A Christian and a Muslim\n\nchild on their way to the kindergarten\n\n237 Children in special costumes are waiting\n\nto perform at the Muara Hotel in Ternate.\n\nBecause of the black-red-yellow-green colors\n\nit's about a historic Soya-Soya dance, which is\n\nperformed in honor of important personalities\n\n238 The calm, deep green Tolire crater lake\n\non the foot of Mount Gamalama, surrounded by\n\nforest, is said to be infested by crocodiles\n\n239 Jungle vegetation is growing rampant\n\nand engulfing everything around it\n\n240 The humidity of the jungle benefits\n\nthe growth of mushrooms and fungi\n\n241 Danau Laguna  also called Lake Ngade,\n\nknown for its lotus flowers and holy crocodiles\n\nthat should bring luck when spotting them ..\n\n242 .. a blooming lotus flower\n\n(Nelumbo nucifera) with sparkling\n\ndewdrops on its large leaves ..\n\n243 .. view to the other\n\nlake side with fishermen huts\n\n244 The branches of a dead tree tower\n\nghostly at the Kastela beach into the sky. In the\n\ndistance \"our\" ferry 'Portlink VIII' reappears,\n\nwith which we arrived from Bintung\n\n245 The kids from the kindergarten\n\nat the Kastela beach have a tea-brake\n\n246 The crumbling Portuguese fort Kastela\n\nsouthwest of Ternate, built 1522, was the first\n\ncolonial fortification of the Moluccas. On\n\n2/28/1570 Sultan Khairun of Ternate\n\nwas killed by the Portuguese\n\n247 On the north coast of Ternate lies\n\nHiri Island (2'067 ft.

Kiematabu,\n\nis 5'676 ft. [1'730m] high. The circumnavigation\n\nroad measures also barely 30 miles [50km]\n\n255 The sun is rising behind the big neighbor\n\nisland of Halmahera (6,860 sq mi [17'780 km²]).\n\nView from our homestay Penginapan Seroja\n\nin the main town Soasio in the southeast\n\n256 Old Soasio the main town of Tidore's\n\nrich history, enchants by its abundance of\n\nflowers and plants. Even the sidewalks\n\nare adorned with flower pots\n\n257 Our LandCruiser is allowed to park next\n\nto blooming orchids of every kind at the Pengina-\n\npan Seroja homestay in Old Soasio  a cozy\n\nplace which however has seen better times\n\n258 An empty motorbike rickshaw is waiting\n\nfor guests at the roadside of Old Soasio  a\n\nnostalgic sight that reflects the sleepy island\n\ncharacter of Tidore. There are no trike\n\nrickshaws on Ternate\n\n259 An information sign in Soasio\n\nof a different kind\n\n260 Friendly Tidore faces are smiling into\n\nour camera. The majority of Tidores population\n\n an ancient sultanate that had also territory on\n\nHalmahera  is mainly Muslim\n\n261 The flower pots on the sidewalks\n\nof Soasio don't only enjoy the eyes,\n\nthey also serve as a seat\n\n262 Fort Benteng Tahula is reigning over\n\nOld Soasio. It is testimony of the short presence\n\nof the Spaniards in the early 17th century\n\n263 School kids visiting Fort Tahula\n\nare taking a rest under a shady tree\n\nfrom the steep ascent\n\n264 Not only plants and flowers grow in\n\nthe garden of Fort Tahula, but also a little\n\nmaize field has been planted\n\n265 View from Fort Tahula across the roofs\n\nof the sleepy seaside town of Old Soasio\n\nin the southeastern corner of Tidore\n\n266 A fig tree is spreading its large roots\n\nat the steep entrance stairway to the\n\nfortress Benteng Torre in Soasio\n\n267 The North Molucca island group is\n\nwithin sight of each other. Here the view\n\nsouthwards from Tidores Fort Tahula to the\n\nislands of Moti (3'120 ft. [950m]) and behind\n\nit Makian (ragged, 4'452 ft. [1'357m])\n\n271 Only Liliana interrupts the compact\n\ntropical picture at Fort Torre in Soasio\n\n272 A blooming frangipani plant (Plumeria)\n\nwithin the fort area.
