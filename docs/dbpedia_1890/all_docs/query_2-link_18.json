        "text": "13 states of Malaysia\n\nMalaysia is a federation that consists of 13 states and 3 federal territories. Eleven states and two federal territories (Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya) are located on the peninsula while the remaining two states and one federal territory (Labuan) are on the island of Borneo. The 13 states are based on historical Malay Kingdoms. Nine of them, known as the Malay States, retain their royal families. Governance of the 13 states is divided between the federal and the state governments.\n\nFood in Malaysia\n\nIf shopping is the national pastime in Malaysia, then food is the national obsession. It is not uncommon to be greeted by the phrase 'Sudah makan?' (Have you eaten already?). Everything in Malaysia revolves around great food. Pleasant social get-togethers are always combined with having a nice meal. In Malaysia, more people blog about food than about anything else. Locals usually never eat at home; unless it is with family. Everybody eats outdoors every night; Malaysia is all about food!\n\nChinese New Year\n\nChinese New Year is the most important of the traditional Chinese holidays. This goes for the Chinese population in Malaysia too where the day itself is declared a public holiday. For Chinese locals the new year means a new start where they can make new money and attract new businesses. At numerous locations in Malaysia people light fireworks during the celebrations. Chinese New Year is the only day in the year most of the shops are closed for business.\n\nAirport Taxi at KLIA\n\nThough using the KLIA Express is a quicker way to reach Kuala Lumpur city center, using the airport taxi is a much easier way to reach your destination within Kuala Lumpur. KLIA Express only brings you to KL Sentral while the airport taxi drops you off right in front of your hotel. If you are traveling alone it might be too expensive compared to other options as you pay RM74.30 for a ticket. You can buy tickets for a fixed price at one of the taxi counters at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.\n\nMatta Fair in Malaysia\n\nMatta Fair (Malaysian Association of Tour and Travel Agents) is the biggest and most popular travel fair in Malaysia. Malaysians do not yet use the internet as the standard way to book their trips and holidays. Many either go to travel offices or they consult their travel agent when they want to go on a trip. Matta Fair is the place for the best bargains; and it can even be interesting for foreign travelers as there usually are great bargains to destinations outside and within Malaysia."
