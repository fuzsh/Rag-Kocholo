        "text": "Baku, City where we walked ,walked and walked! Here we met a gentleman Moosa, who drove us around as he narrated stories and guided us around the city, which each time in all his pride called My Baku ! Baku, Is city of winds. Latitude and longitude coordinates are: 40.409264, 49.867092 Nestled between the mountain range and the Pacific ocean, the city experiences cold breeze and is named after the winds... Woke up in the middle of the night , looked out of the window which framed a children's park to notice moving swings with no people where the wind was at play.Also through the day and night the gushing sound of wind fills the ears. Baku has history dating back to stone age and rich culture. Museums that showcase their lineage,natural history and culture are amazing. The walk through the caves that were descriptive of narratives of age old past was beautiful and a well maintained as a UNESCO heritage spot. Old city is still lived in and Vibrant as much the new one. The city's economy is majorly contributed by oil and gas! Azerbaijan with a population of 1 crore people was once the 5th largest supplier of oil and gases in the world is rooted to culture and is modern! The Baku lake, from where the city gets its drinking water is fenced hence secured and protected from all elements that can possibly pollute the water. One gets a holy feel as we drive through the waterbody though the fence appears tall and thorny as if it is guarding the water from pollutants. At Baku, It's mostly cars, the big cars that we see zipping through creating the whiff of rhythmic wind in high speeds on wide roads uninterrupted, angled parking slots by the sides flanked by wide universal friendly pathways allowing people to walk through the city.We also discovered huge underground parking facility where we saw cars till the eyes could see across width and breadth of the space with hardly any humans. Mostly underpasses with escalators to cross over the junctions with beautiful boulevards,public squares, parks with no fences where one could walk in ,sit around, relax,socialise, play ,experience the breeze and live in the moment. Beautiful greenery painted(planted)all over the city(green zones designated or preserved by the national Govt.) and good chunk of free space which is most required for a city! The language people speak here is Azerbaijani. The currency is Mannat. A large cup of flat cream coffee can cost you 6 -7 mannats. 1 litre of water would cost you 1.5 mannats. A joke I cracked often is instead of saying mannat, I would say Mannat or Shah Rukh Khan house(s) which is 6 storeys tall and faces the sea in Bandra. The city is clean, creates a lot of waste, managed well,nobody throws around garbage, it all gets into the green and orange plastic drums, not sure where it goes from the drums. There is lots more to discover, Architecture, lifestyle,sport,spirit,nature, life and the people too were amazing !"
