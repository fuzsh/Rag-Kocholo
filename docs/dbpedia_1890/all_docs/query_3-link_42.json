        "text": "Acquire Malaysian Residence\n\nThe Government of Malaysia enables applicants and their families to live in the country through the Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) Program or the Premium Visa Program (PVIP). In exchange for an investment into the country, successful applicants are granted a long-term multiple-entry visa.\n\nThe MM2H visa is a 10-year, multiple-entry visa. MM2H applicants must be at least 35 years old. Main applicants and their spouses must spend 90 days per year in Malaysia (children, parents, and parents-in-law are exempt from this requirement).\n\nThe PVIP visa is a 20-year, multiple-entry visa, issued in five-year tranches. PVIP applicants can be of any age and may work and run a business in Malaysia. They are not required to reside in Malaysia.\n\nBenefits of Malaysian residence by investment\n\nStraightforward, efficient residence by investment program\n\n20-year residence visa, renewable for a further 20 years\n\nNo age restriction for main applicant\n\nLive, work, and conduct business in Malaysia\n\nAbility to include a spouse, parents, parents-in-law, and children who are not married and under 21 years old\n\nNo minimum stay requirement\n\nMulticultural population and contemporary way of life\n\nOption to purchase any number of residential properties, from MYR 300,000 (approximately USD 70,000) to MYR 1 million (approximately USD 212,000), which varies from state to state\n\nTaxation only levied on income sourced in Malaysia, and an extensive network of double tax agreements in place\n\nRequirements of the Premium Visa Program\n\nTo acquire Malaysian residence under PVIP, upon application submission, foreign nationals must submit proof of offshore income worth a minimum MYR 40,000 (approximately USD 8,500) per month or MYR 480,000 (approximately USD 100,000) per year.\n\nUpon approval, successful applicants:\n\nMust invest MYR 1 million (approximately USD 212,000) into a local fixed deposit account. This investment must be maintained throughout the applicantâ€™s stay in Malaysia under the program.\n\nNote: Applicants may withdraw up to MYR 500,000 (approximately USD 106,000) after the first year if they wish, for approved expenses relating to a house purchase, education for their children in Malaysia, or medical expenses.\n\nNeed to purchase medical health insurance if they are aged 60 or below\n\nMust undergo a medical check-up in Malaysia\n\nProcedures and time frame of Malaysian residence by investment\n\nThe Malaysia Immigration Department will issue a conditional approval letter to each approved applicant. The MM2H visa does not allow its holders to work in Malaysia. Both the MM2H and PVIP visas do not lead to permanent residence.\n\nAfter the MM2H or PVIP application for residence has been submitted to the Malaysian government and initial approval has been granted, the client can visit the country to complete the remaining requirements (namely, opening a bank account and fulfilling the medical requirements). Henley & Partners will assist with this process.\n\nThereafter, full approval will be granted and the applicant and their included family receive their long-term multiple-entry visas to Malaysia (10 years under the MM2H program and 20 years under the PVIP). The whole process takes three to six months.\n\nBoth the initial MM2H visa and the PVIP visa are valid for an initial period of five years and can be renewed thereafter."
