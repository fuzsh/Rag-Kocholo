        "text": "The oil-rich Malaysian state of Sarawak in Borneo is aiming to transform itself into a center for clean hydrogen energy, betting that its ability to harness an abundance of hydropower can help it defy challenges that are clouding the fuel’s prospects elsewhere.\n\nIn state capital Kuching, the gambit is well underway after Sarawak plowed $3.4 billion into a network of power-to-transport projects. Three fuel-cell buses made in China that are free to ride ply the city’s roads, refueling at multi-fuel stations that come with hydrogen bays. Officials travel around in Toyota Motor Corp.’s Mirai, the world’s first mass-produced hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle."
