        "text": "Terrorism\n\nThere is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.\n\nTerrorism in Malaysia\n\nTerrorist attacks in Malaysia cannot be ruled out.\n\nAttacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Potential targets include:\n\nbars and restaurants\n\nhotels\n\nmarkets\n\nshopping malls\n\ntourist attractions\n\nplaces of worship\n\nairports\n\nYou should be especially vigilant and maintain a high level of security awareness in crowded places and at large gatherings.\n\nTerrorist kidnap\n\nBritish nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.\n\nThe long-standing policy of the British government policy is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.\n\nIn Malaysia, there is a threat to foreigners of kidnapping in coastal areas of eastern Sabah from terrorist and criminal groups. The threat is particularly high between the towns of Sandakan and Tawau and on islands close to the Sulu Archipelago in the southern Philippines.\n\nThe Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), based in the Philippines, has previously kidnapped foreigners from the east coast of mainland Sabah, the islands and the surrounding waters. The group has murdered several hostages. Some groups operating in the southern Philippines, including factions of ASG, have pledged allegiance to Daesh and are likely to regard Westerners as legitimate targets.\n\nPolitical situation\n\nIn response to the current situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, there have been peaceful demonstrations in some Malaysian cities, including outside some Western embassies.\n\nIt’s illegal under Malaysian law for foreign nationals to take part in demonstrations or protests.\n\nMonitor local and international media and avoid all demonstrations. Police can use tear gas and water cannons to control public protests.\n\nCrime\n\nProtecting your belongings\n\nTake precautions to protect yourself from petty crime. Avoid carrying valuables and take particular care of your passport while:\n\nwalking\n\nin cafes\n\non aircraft\n\nin airport and railway terminals\n\nin hotel rooms\n\nCredit card and ATM fraud is widespread. Take care when using your card.\n\nBag-snatching is common, particularly in major cities. Thieves on motorbikes can target tourists. They can cut straps or pull off bags carried on the shoulder closest to the road. They have sometimes pulled people to the ground and killed or injured them if they try to hold onto their bags.\n\nPersonal security\n\nThere have been cases of assaults and robbery, particularly around bars and nightlife areas. Do not open your hotel room door to strangers, especially late at night. This applies particularly to women travelling alone.\n\nDrink spiking\n\nThere have been cases of strangers offering tourists a spiked drink, even in reputable bars or restaurants, and then robbing or assaulting them.\n\nUsing taxis\n\nTaxi coupon systems are in place at airports. In other areas, taxis should use a meter.\n\nPolice reports\n\nIf you’re a victim of crime, inform the local police and get a police report.\n\nLaws and cultural differences\n\nMalaysia is a multicultural, majority Muslim country. Respect local laws, cultures, traditions and religions.\n\nDress modestly, particularly in conservative and rural areas. You may be refused entry to places of worship or government offices if you do not have your shoulders and knees covered or are not wearing closed shoes. Check the signs displayed at the entrance.\n\nIf you’re a Muslim, you may be subject to local Sharia law.\n\nPersonal ID\n\nAlways carry your passport.\n\nRamadan\n\nRamadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. Ramadan will take place between March and April in Malaysia in 2024.\n\nDuring this time, you should:\n\ncheck opening hours of shops and restaurants\n\nfollow local dress codes – clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time\n\nbe aware of the risks of dehydration and that fasting can cause tiredness, particularly during the later afternoon and early evening\n\nGet more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.\n\nIllegal drugs and prison sentences\n\nThere are severe penalties for all drug offences, including for amphetamine-type stimulants. If you are detained following a raid on a bar or nightclub, you could have to take a urine test to check for drug use.\n\nPossessing drugs, even in very small quantities, carries severe penalties, including:\n\narrest and detention\n\na long jail sentence if charged and convicted\n\na possible whipping\n\nif drug trafficking is indicated, a possible death sentence by hanging\n\nLGBT+ travellers\n\nSame-sex sexual acts are illegal in Malaysia under federal law. The Malaysian authorities sometimes carry out raids on LGBT+ spaces and events. Shows of affection in public could attract negative responses from other members of the public. Openly LGBT+ safe spaces and support groups exist.\n\nRead more advice for LGBT+ travellers.\n\nOutdoor activities and adventure tourism\n\nWater sports and scuba diving\n\nIf you rent jet skis or any other type of water sports equipment, make sure adequate safety precautions are in place. Only use licensed operators, insist on training before use and make sure you’re covered by your insurance.\n\nDiving school standards are not always as high as in the UK. You should:\n\ncheck a dive operator’s credentials\n\nmake sure safety equipment is available on the boat, particularly oxygen\n\nask about safety precautions, including the ability to transfer divers to a hyperbaric chamber\n\nIf you have not had any previous diving experience:\n\nask your dive instructor to explain what cover they offer before signing up\n\ncheck what to do if something goes wrong, including how to call for help while at sea\n\nThe diving sites of HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales, which lie in international waters off Kuantan, have been declared ‘protected places’ under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. Only dive there on a ‘look not touch’ basis. Make sure any boat operator you use holds a licence for diving at the wreck site.\n\nTransport risks\n\nRoad travel\n\nIf you are planning to drive in Malaysia, see information on driving abroad.\n\nYou need a 1949 international driving permit (IDP) and a UK driving licence to drive in Malaysia for up to a year. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You will need to buy a new IDP for each additional year you plan to drive in Malaysia.\n\nDrivers (particularly motorbike drivers) do not always stop at traffic lights or pedestrian crossings. If you’re involved in a road accident, it’s illegal to leave the scene before the police have arrived. If a crowd gathers, it may be safer to go directly to the nearest police station instead.\n\nThere have been several fatal bus crashes, particularly on overnight journeys. Choose a reputable operator for your journey.\n\nIf you rent a motorbike, it’s illegal not to wear a helmet.\n\nDriving under the influence of alcohol is a serious offence and the traffic police regularly carry out breath tests. If you are found driving over the legal limit, you may get:\n\na heavy fine\n\na jail sentence\n\ndeported\n\nRoad conditions in East Malaysia and not as good as those in Peninsular Malaysia.\n\nSea and river travel\n\nSome passenger boats have sunk due to overloading and poor maintenance. Take care when travelling by passenger ferry or speedboat. Avoid travelling on vessels that are clearly overloaded or in poor condition. Make sure life jackets are available.\n\nPiracy in South East Asian waters is an ongoing problem. There have been attacks against ships in and around Malaysian waters, particularly in the Strait of Malacca and the waters between Sabah and the southern Philippines. Be vigilant and take appropriate precautions. Reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas on board and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.\n\nExtreme weather and natural disasters\n\nMalaysia is affected by seasonal storms. The timing of these storms depends on location in the country. Flooding and landslides are common and can cause significant damage to infrastructure. Essential services can be interrupted. Check Malaysian meteorological information on local weather.\n\nEarthquakes can happen in Malaysia, but are rare."
