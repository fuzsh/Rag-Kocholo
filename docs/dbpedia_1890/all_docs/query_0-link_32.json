        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) – Iran launched its first direct military attack against Israel on Saturday. The Israeli military says Iran fired more than 100 bomb-carrying drones toward Israel. Hours later, Iran announced it had also launch much more destructive ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.\n\nIran had been threatening to attack Israel after an airstrike earlier this week widely blamed on Israel destroyed Iran’s consulate in Syria, killing 12 people, including two elite Iranian generals.\n\nIsrael has made missile defense a priority, with a variety of air-defence systems available to shoot down incoming missile and drone fire.\n\nIsrael and Iran have been on a collision course throughout Israel’s six-month bombardments against Hamas fighters in the Gaza Strip. The attacks erupted after Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two resistance groups backed by Iran, carried out a revolt on October 7 that killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250 others.\n\nAn Israeli offensive in Gaza has caused widespread devastation and killed over 33,000 people, according to local health officials.\n\nCurrently, President Joe Biden cut short a weekend stay at his Delaware beach house to meet with his national security team and monitor the situation in the Middle East as Iran launched an attack against Israel.\n\nIsrael has a multilayered air-defence system. It faces a big test with Iranian drone strike.\n\nHere is the latest:\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres is calling for an immediate halt to hostilities in the Middle East.\n\n“I strongly condemn the serious escalation represented by the large-scale attack launched on Israel by the Islamic Republic of Iran this evening,” Guterres wrote in a statement Saturday night.\n\n“I am deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region-wide escalation. I urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East,” Guterres wrote. “I have repeatedly stressed that neither the region nor the world can afford another war.”\n\nThe French government forcefully condemned the Iranian air attack on Israel.\n\nFrench foreign minister Stéphane Séjourné said in a statement Saturday that in “taking such an unprecedented action, Iran has crossed a new threshold with regard to its destabilising activities and is risking a potential military escalation.”\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock wrote early Sunday on X that Germany condemns “in the strongest possible terms the ongoing attack, which could plunge an entire region into chaos.\n\n“Iran and its proxies must stop it immediately,” Baerbock wrote. “We offer Israel our full solidarity at this time.”\n\nLikewise, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his nation “unequivocally condemns Iran’s airborne attacks against Israel.”\n\n“We stand with Israel. After supporting Hamas’ brutal October 7 attack, the Iranian regime’s latest actions will further destabilise the region and make lasting peace more difficult,” Trudeau said in a statement.\n\n“We support Israel’s right to defend itself and its people from these attacks.”\n\nUK Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said additional Royal Air Force jets and air refueling tankers have been sent to the Middle East to bolster Britain’s existing operation against the Islamic State Group in Iraq and Syria.\n\nHe said the jets “will intercept airborne attacks within range of our existing missions,” but did not confirm whether RAF jets had already shot down any Iranian drones.\n\nMeanwhile, the spokesperson of Argentine President Javier Milei says the leader will cancel a trip to Denmark and return to Buenos Aires due to Iran’s attack on Israel.\n\nA statement from presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni said Milei was flying home to form a “crisis committee in light of the latest events in Israel, to take charge of the situation and coordinate actions with the presidents of the Western world.”\n\nUS officials say American military forces have downed some Iran-launched attack drones flying toward Israel.\n\nThat is according to a US defence official and two US officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. The defense official said the effort to intercept the attack was continuing.\n\nSince Iran announced its attack Saturday against Israel, air raid sirens have gone off in Jerusalem, in northern and southern Israel, in the Negev region, in the Shomron area and in the Dead Sea region.\n\nThe Israeli army has ordered residents of the Golan Heights in the north and Nevatim, Dimona and Eilat in the south to stay close to a protected space — such as a shelter, stairwell or inner room — until further notice.\n\nResidents must be able to reach the protected spaces as soon as air raid sirens are activated, the statement said.\n\n“We ask the public to follow the instructions of the Home Front Command regarding the situation and wait for additional instructions,” the statement said.\n\nIran’s state-run IRNA news agency says Tehran has fired ballistic missiles at targets inside of Israel. The announcement came shortly after Iran said it fired dozens of bomb-carrying drones.\n\nSlow-moving Shahed-136 drones have been seen in the skies over Iran. However, those are more easily shot down.\n\nIsrael has missile defence systems capable of targeting ballistic missiles. However, in a massive attack involving multiple drones and missiles like the campaign launched late Saturday by Iran, the likelihood of a strike making it through is higher.\n\nThe Israel occupation forces says that it is prepared to defend itself against a massive drone attack launched by Iran.\n\nRear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the army’s spokesperson, said the country is closely monitoring the drones that are headed to Israel.\n\n“Our defensive and offensive capabilities are at the highest level of readiness,” he said. “Together with our partners, the Israel Defence Forces is operating at full-force to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel.”\n\nNational Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said Saturday that the United States “will stand with the people of Israel and support their defence against these threats from Iran.”\n\nThe Pentagon reported that Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin had spoken with his Israeli counterpart “and made clear that Israel could count on full US support to defend Israel against any attacks by Iran and its regional proxies.”\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan also spoke with his counterpart to reinforce Washington’s “ironclad commitment” to Israel’s security.\n\nIsrael says it has closed its airspace after Iran launched dozens of drones against it late Saturday.\n\nIsraeli aviation authorities said they were closing the country’s airspace to all flights as of 12.30am local time (5.30pm EDT).\n\nThe attack late Saturday marked the first time Iran had ever launched a direct military assault on Israel, despite decades of enmity dating back to the country’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nIran has a vast arsenal of drones and missiles. Tehran’s choice of the Shahed-136 drones both give Israel and its allies hours to shoot down the bomb-carrying drones. For the time being, it does not appear Iran has used any of its ballistic missiles in the attack, which would pose a greater risk to Israel."
