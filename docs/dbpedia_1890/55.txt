Rajang River, river in East Malaysia (northwest Borneo), rising in the Iran Mountains and flowing southwest to Kapit, where it turns westward to complete its 350-mile (563-kilometre) course to the South China Sea. Its large, swampy delta includes Beruit Island, with a lighthouse at Sirik Point. In a region almost totally dependent on riverine transport, the Rajang River is navigable for 80 miles (130 km) to Sibu by oceangoing vessels and for another 100 miles (160 km) by shallow-draft craft; small canoes can penetrate even farther into the otherwise inaccessible Iban country interior.

The market towns of Sarikei, Binatang, Kanowit, and Kapit are along its banks. One of the areaâ€™s few agricultural sectors parallels its course. Tributaries include the Kanowit, Ngemah, Iran, Baleh, and Pila rivers.
