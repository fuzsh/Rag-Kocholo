May titled \"How About Rounds of 35-23-36? Marlene Has Them,\" Hagge, with 25 tour wins to her credit, is quoted as saying \"The ultimate compliment would be for a man to tell me I'm pretty and that he wishes he could play golf as well as I do.

The planned cover shoot of Grout and Jack Nicklaus, demonstrating an alignment device called the Grout Stick, was set to take place at Augusta National, during a practice round at the Masters.

Assistant Editor Kathy Jonah writes of Blalock's suspension from the LPGA in the summer of 1972 for alleged cheating and her subsequent lawsuit against the organization, which Blalock won in 1974. \"Relations between Blalock and the 'enemy camp,' as she once phrased it, have mellowed so there's no outward awkwardness in her tour pairings, but at one point the ill will could be sensed across a club parking lot,\" wrote Jonah.What LPGA star Jane Blalock called \"the incident\" was the catalyst for this cover story.

After a standout amateur career--1989, 1992 U.S. Amateur titles, 1992 NCAA champion--Goetze remains winless on the LPGA Tour. Those 15 more yards may have materialized, but evidently weren't quite enough: Goetze averaged 222 yards off the tee in 2005, placing 161st in that category.LPGA rookie Vicki Goetze takes her place on the cover, a special issue dedicated to distance.

But she was an accomplished college golfer at Michigan State, and she's earned a sizable following as a host on Golf Channel. Moreover, Sonders, who adheres to a strict workout regimen, was an appropriate cover model for our \"Get Fit!\" package.Holly Sonders might have been an unlikely selection for our cover when you consider she hasn't played a single round on the LPGA Tour.

But the fashion icon, who said she played golf only once a year growing up, was looking to take up the game more seriously. Hence the decision to pair Upton with the legendary Arnold Palmer so that Palmer could teach some of the basics of the swing.\"I could tell right away that she's going to be a nice player,\" Palmer writes in the issue.As with Holly Sonders, Kate Upton didn't land on the cover of Golf Digest on the strength of her playing record.

But what she lacked in true golf credentials, Gretzky made up for in buzz. As part of Golf Digest's annual \"Fit Issue\", the cover story featured photos of Gretzky demonstrating several golf-specific exercises, and also included a Q&A in which she discussed her myriad connections to the sports world.\n\nOctober 2014\n\nLPGA star Michelle Wie poses for our cover as she has a break-through season and claims her first major title.LPGA star Michelle Wie poses for our cover as she has a break-through season and claims her first major title.\n\nMay 2015\n\nIn our annual nod to golf and fitness, LPGA star Lexi Thompson shows off the progress she's made in the gym. \"I don't know how hard the PGA Tour guys work out, but out here we're working pretty hard,\" Thompson says. \"Even after long days, there are a lot of girls in the fitness trailer.\""
