        "text": "It took five backbreaking months to bring Vanity Fair's dazzling November music issue to fruition, but it is finally here - hitting newsstands this week - and it is something to see.\n\nThe fold-out cover itself was a dramatic tale - Annie Leibovitz lured 10 music stars to a smelly, hot, meat market district in Manhattan in July. But the shoot began late because No Doubt's blond bombshell, Gwen Stefani, had a scary moment in the air. Her London-to-New York Concorde nosedived, and the plane was turned back. The singer called sobbing from the British Airways lounge to say, \"Hang on, I'm on my way!\" Stefani - now Mrs. Gavin Rossdale - got right back on the next Concorde and arrived still shaking from fright but ready to strike a pose for Annie. Everybody had waited patiently, perhaps using the extra time to pick up a choice cut.\n\nAnother music diva, Jennifer Lopez, did not live up to her reputation. (VF was braced.) She was made up in the same size cubicle as everybody else, stayed out in the heat signing autographs and mingled in a down-to-earth manner. So much for the tales of her vast entourage.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSharing cover space with Gwen and Jennifer are Sheryl Crow, Alicia Keys, Eve, Nelly Furtado, Norah Jones, Shirley Manson, living legend Debbie Harry and for the ladies, Mr. Barry White. This is possibly the hottest group photo that has appeared on VF's cover; I usually find them rather washed-out looking, but here it is vibrant with color, and everybody looks ready to jump right out and start, well, singing! Yes, it's true I'm not familiar with some of the faces or names (Norah Jones, for instance, though I am assured she is this season's new \"It\" girl of music), but it doesn't matter. The cover screams, \"Buy me, I'm yours!\"\n\nMy one cavil? I think Debbie Harry should have been placed more prominently - listen, if it weren't for Debbie, there'd be no Gwen. Hell, there'd be no Madonna for that matter.\n\nDon't think just because the cover is mostly women, that the issue isn't all-inclusive. Inside, there are pics of everybody from Eminem to Joan Baez to Kylie Minogue to the Rolling Stones on through Dolly Parton, the Hives and Bruce Springsteen. There's an article on the long-gone but fondly remembered rock scene of New York in the '70s . . . Elvis Costello's piece about his ideal 24 hours of music, dawn to dusk . . . an oral history of the '60s British Invasion, and you'll get your kicks on a literary journey down Route 66 itself.\n\nThere is much, much more, including a big take on the rise and falter of Warner Records.\n\nIf you're interested in the music scene, yesterday, today and tomorrow, Vanity Fair for November will put a melody in your heart.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
