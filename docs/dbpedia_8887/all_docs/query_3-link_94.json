        "text": "Hi all!\n\nSilly issue but my chickens won't go in the coop during a thunderstorm! This concerns me only because we live in Colorado and hail that is shooter marble size or larger coming down is totally normal. They will shelter under the coop but NONE will go in. IDK what to do. I don't want to look out after a storm and find a dead chicken because a hail stone hit her because she wasn't smart enough to go inside.\n\nThoughts?\n\nOh, and if breeds make any difference, I have 3 Buff Orps and 3 Barred Rocks (about 4 months old.)\n\nWe get rain a lot here. My chickens don't mind it and actually prefer it, good worm hunting in a hard rain or just after. Mine can get to shelter if it bothers them and on some days they just sit on a pallet under the cover of the barn and let it rain while they nap and then in a while they are back out side exploring and getting wet. For me, I figure they know more about being outside as a chicken then I do. They are just so hard wired by mother nature and have managed to survive despite living with humans\n\nYou did state that they take shelter under the coop, so they should be safe there. I'd just leave them. Please don't put yourself in danger by going out in the storm to put them in. Your life is much more important than that of a chicken. Mine free range and don't put themselves in the coop during a storm, either, but do find other shelter."
