        "text": "1. SOAK UP THE VIBE.\n\nHalf of the allure of Beale Street is your walk along the strip itself. With over two dozen bars and nightclubs, street performers and great people, you'll find the environment hypnotic as you peak into alleys for rockin' performances and admire the pop-up shops in W.C. Handy Park.\n\nArrive around 7 p.m. at B.B. King's Blues Club near the West end of Beale. Grab a quick appetizer or dinner and soak in some of the best Blues music. B.B. King's always has a cover but the house bands and performers are worth it! Once you're ready for a change of scenery, keep exploring Beale Street with a visit to any walk-up bar and order Memphis' signature drink, the Walk Me Down - a frozen blue treat with seven different liquors and delicious to boot.\n\nWatch the Beale Street Flippers turn the cobblestone street into a runway for aerial somersaults as onlookers line the sidewalks (and sometimes join in as props). Check out the brass music notes memorializing Memphis music legends on the sidewalks. As you travel the street, you're sure to hear conversations in English, Italian, German and more. It'll become clear why the city that revolutionized the world's soundtrack continues to attract international adoration decades later.\n\n2. HAIL THE QUEEN.\n\nAfter touring the strip and meeting the inevitably chatty promoters at each stop, you'll want to stop somewhere and finalize your agenda. Try Silky O’Sullivan’s open-air courtyard where resident goats interact patiently with their fans (and occassionally sip beer).\n\nFor another Beale Street classic, be sure to order Silky’s signature “Diver,” a gallon-sized mystery cocktail served in an iconic yellow bucket. Best enjoyed with a group! The goats, cocktail, and spirited ambiance set the stage for the nightly performers from dueling pianos inside to an impromptu dance party in the beer garden.\n\n3. DANCE WITH THE LOCALS.\n\nAs long as the night isn’t too cold, locals gather ’round the W.C Handy statue in his namesake park for free concerts. The experience is electric. Attendees of all ages come together for a Memphis-style groove session. During summer months, Memphis bands present multiple series of free concerts that offer a genre-bending mix of styles from rock to punk to funk to folk. Looking to stay inside? You'll find impromptu dance floors at any given bar!\n\n4. MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.\n\nA nominal cover gets you into Blues Hall Juke Joint. Inside the narrow room, strands of white lights drape along the ceiling and framed paintings hang on the walls, giving it the feel of someone’s living room. The bands that play here strip down their soul and blues sounds for intimate sets – a cozy warm-up to what comes next . . .\n\n5. GROOVE ON OUT.\n\nBlues Hall is connected to Rum Boogie Café, so you get two experiences for one cover charge. Walk through the adjoining door for a sight- and soundscape that’s altogether different: Inside Rum Boogie, neon lights spelling STAX glow red, illuminating a collection of guitars – each one suspended from the ceiling and name-dropping its association, from Bobby Rush to The Black Crowes. Any given night, you'll find a band or singer on stage like Vince Johnson and the Boogie Blues Band– harmonica, sax, Hammond organ and all – so when they groove out to “Green Onions” or “Walking the Dog,” it sounds exactly like Beale Street live music should.\n\nThese are only a few things to do on Beale Street any night of the week. You’re bound to find your own Beale Street playlist. Whether you're getting your country fix at Tin Roof, dancing to DJ music or singing karaoke – you can take your pick and experience the very best of Memphis' Beale Street."
