        "text": "We've already looked at the best girl groups of all time — but what about the up-and-comers, the rising stars, the ones poised to have a killer 2024? The girl groups to watch in 2024 aren't all brand new; some started years ago but recently achieved a new level of success, some literally debuted just a couple months ago. Either way, these are the girl groups about to completely take over your playlists.\n\nBelow, delve into the most exciting girl groups of 2024, as chosen by various Teen Vogue editors.\n\nVCHA\n\nTeen Vogue's newest cover stars VCHA are poised to dominate in 2024. Opening for K-pop legends (and fellow cover stars) TWICE? Check. A set of fun singles with great choreo? Check. Next up: even more new music. Their sound combines familiar K-pop sensibilities (airtight performances, ultra-catchy choruses) with a kind of '90s gummy pop vibe on songs like “Girls of the Year.” They have so much time to develop their sound further, and that combined with the clear chemistry they have together makes their potential limitless. —P. Claire Dodson\n\nFLO\n\nR&B vocalists FLO broke onto the scene in 2022 with their debut single “Cardboard Box,” a modern descendant of Beyoncé's “Irreplaceable” that became the group's first viral hit, getting the TikTok choreo treatment and all). The British trio is comprised of Jorja Douglas, Renée Downer, and Stella Quaresma; they found each other through Sylvia Young Theatre School (famously attended by the likes of Amy Winehouse, Dua Lipa, and one half of Little Mix) and social media. FLO perfectly blends nostalgic aesthetics with progressive production — which are, of course, the optimal conditions for modern R&B smash hits — and are primed to follow in the footsteps of their biggest influences and perhaps even surpass them. —Kaitlyn McNab\n\nATARASHII GAKKO!\n\nATARASHII GAKKO! is a four-member Japanese girl group who have dubbed themselves as the “self-proclaimed Japanese youth representatives.” Though they debuted in 2017, ATARASHII GAKKO! have only recently been making waves around the world after their hit track “Tokyo Calling” reached virality across social media. Featuring members Mizyu, Rin, Suzuka, and Kanon, all born between 1998 and 2002, ATARASHII GAKKO!’s global expansion is one to keep an eye out for, with the quartet racking up slots in major international festivals like Coachella and Primavera Sound. —Sara Delgado\n\nKiss of Life\n\nFreshly debuted in 2023, Kiss of Life has already garnered quite the buzz in the K-pop world. In addition to the single “Shhh,” the group’s first EP featured solos by each of the members, Julie, Natty, Belle, and Haneul. These individual tracks allowed each of the members to showcase their abilities and subsequently launched them to viral fame.\n\nKiss of Life made their first comeback with “Bad News,” just before the end of the year and awards season in Asia. The group took home several trophies in the new artist, rookie, and rising star categories from multiple programs. In 2024, Kiss of Life dropped “Midas Touch,” a catchy power anthem hallmarked by choreography that fans and idols alike were enticed to try out for themselves. The group is slated for a summer full of festivals, giving them ample opportunity to further showcase their stage presence this year. —Donya Momenian\n\nILLIT\n\nILLIT (아일릿) are the newest girl group from K-pop juggernauts HYBE Labels, more specifically Belift Lab, which is also home to ENHYPEN. Formed in 2023 via the reality competition show R U Next?, ILLIT was initially intended to promote as a sextet but ultimately debuted as a quintet in the spring of 2024 with fresh-faced members Yunah, Minju, Moka, Wonhee, and Iroha. The group first burst into the scene with a four-track EP called Super Real Me, which included the viral hit track \"Magnetic.\" —Sara Delgado\n\nKATSEYE\n\nThe world first got to know the members of KATSEYE individually via The Debut: Dream Academy in 2023, and anticipation has been building since. Featuring members Daniela Avanzini, Lara Raj, Manon Bannerman, Megan Skiendiel, Sophia Laforteza, and Yoonchae Jeong, KATSEYE — whose fans have already been dubbed “EYEKONS ” — have been keeping busy rubbing shoulders with LE SSERAFIM at Coachella and preparing their debut studio album for the summer of 2024. (The sextet’s journey is also being chronicled in an upcoming Netflix documentary.) —Sara Delgado\n\nSay Now, formerly Needanamebro\n\nBritish girl group Say Now was first known across social media by a much more literal and temporary placeholder: “needanamebro.\" Singers Amelia Onuorah, Madeleine Haynes, and Ysabelle Salvanera caught eyes and ears online after covering Drake's “Massive” in 2022. They released singles that got even more online attention throughout 2023, like “Better Love,” “Netflix (Better Now Without You),” and “Not a Lot Left to Say.\" Say Now asked fans and followers for input on their official group name, documenting the decision-making process on YouTube. In August 2023, they revealed their new name Say Now alongside an EP with these collected tracks titled — wait for it — Needanamebro. The group is now managed by the folks behind the early trajectories of One Direction and Little Mix, so if that's any indication of where Say Now is headed, buckle up for a whirlwind of a ride. —Kaitlyn McNab\n\nForthcoming I-LAND 2: N/a Group\n\nIf you watched Mnet’s first I-LAND competition show, you’d know that none other than ENHYPEN were the resulting group formed during the program, so, of course, expectations are high for the second round. Currently on air, the second season of the reality competition show, officially titled I-LAND 2: N/a, seeks to create the next It girl group. Instead of collaborating with Belift Labs once again, Mnet has joined forces with WakeOne (home to Kep1er and ZEROBASEONE) and The Black Label (a sub-label of YG, which has produced multiple tracks for the likes of BLACKPINK and Jeon Somi.) —Sara Delgado\n\nRLY\n\nBritish five-member girl group RLY formed via X Factor UK: The Band in 2019, winning the series and signing a label deal with Syco. They've since switched labels and had some member changes, but the current lineup of Jess, Kyra, Kelli, Halle, and Virginia, recently released an EP called Generation that hints at exciting things to come. Generation is a fun sampler of their sound, which is shaped by a lyrical vulnerability and a sort of Alessia Cara vibe. Like most current girl groups, they dabble across a few genres, including pop and hip-hop. Title track “Generation” is an honest look at what's affecting their generation, touching on therapy, eating disorders, panic attacks, and being afraid to get catcalled on the street. They clearly have a vision for what they want to talk about in their songs, and it'll be cool to see where they go next. —P. Claire Dodson\n\nBilllie\n\nSince their debut in 2021, the members of K-pop girl group Billlie — Moon Sua, Suhyeon, Haram, Tsuki, Sheon, Siyoon, and Haruna — have been building momentum. The group is best known for high-energy stages like “​​GingaMingaYo (the strange world)” and its intensive choreography, which went viral in 2022 thanks to Tsuki’s animated expressions. Combined with their more serene side showcased through songs like “Eunioa” and “Patbingsu,” their performances gained recognition both domestically and internationally. They even landed a spot at Texas festival SXSW in 2023.\n\nWhile the eldest members Moon Sua and Suhyeon began family- and health-related hiatuses later that year, the younger members delivered “BYOB (bring your own best friend),” an ode to girlhood and putting platonic relationships first. Last month, Moon Sua and Suhyeon made their return just in time for the group’s first fan concert. Now together as seven again, the members’ next comeback and upcoming European tour are highly anticipated. In the meantime, they continue making viral hits, whether fancams or TikToks. —Donya Momenian\n\nBINI\n\nFrom the media company ABS-CBN’s training program, Star Hunt Academy, BINI is an eight-member P-pop girl group. Jhoanna, Aiah, Colet, Maloi, Gwen, Stacey, Mikha, and Sheena debuted in 2021 with the song, “Born to Win,” an empowering anthem set to a dance-inducing beat. Just a year later, the group collaborated with P-pop leaders SB19 and Jonathan Manalo, cementing their influence in the genre. BINI dropped a number of hits in 2023, including “Pantropiko,” which has earned over 19 million views on Youtube and 54 million streams on Spotify. So far, in 2024, the group has released another hit song, “Salamin, Salamin,” which climbed the charts, all while “Pantropiko” continued to trend as well. At the time of writing, the group’s hold is still evident as “Pantropiko” tops Billboard’s Philippines Songs chart with “Salamin, Salamin” right behind. —Donya Momenian\n\nBABYMONSTER\n\nIf you’re like me and you’ve been walking around muttering “Sheesh!” at every minor inconvenience, Babymonster's recent single of the same name is also permanently engraved on your brain — it’s just too catchy. Debuting just this year, the YG Entertainment group definitely continues the girl crush sensibility of labelmates BLACKPINK, both aesthetically and musically. Babymonster have the talent to back up that lofty comparison. Particularly vocally, Babymonster have already proved they won’t be underestimated, and that they can stand in a space all their own. —P. Claire Dodson"
