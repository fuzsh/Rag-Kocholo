        "text": "The following stations of the cross are based on those celebrated by Pope John Paul II on Good Friday 1991. They are presented here as an alternative to the traditional stations and as a way of reflecting more deeply on the Scriptural accounts of Christ's passion.\n\nThe presiding minister may be a priest, deacon, or layperson. This minister prays the opening and closing prayers, leads the acclamation, announces the stations, and says the prayer that concludes each station. One or more readers may read the Scriptural reflections. A period of silence should be observed between the Scripture reading and the prayer. A crossbearer accompanied by two candlebearers may stand in front of each station as it is announced. As the cross- and candlebearers move between the stations, all may sing a verse of the Stabat Mater (At the Cross Her Station Keeping - traditional) or an appropriate antiphon, such as Parce Domine (traditional, various settings) or Crucem Tuam (Berthier, GIA),\n\nBefore each station:\n\nMinister:\n\nWe adore you, O Christ, and we bless you.\n\nAll:\n\nBecause by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.\n\nAfter each station:\n\nAll:\n\nLord Jesus, help us walk in your steps.\n\nOpening Prayer:\n\nMinister:\n\nGod of power and mercy,\n\nin love you sent your Son\n\nthat we might be cleansed of sin\n\nand live with you forever.\n\nBless us as we gather to reflect\n\non his suffering and death\n\nthat we may learn from his example\n\nthe way we should go.\n\nWe ask this through that same Christ, our Lord.\n\nAll:\n\nAmen.\n\nFirst Station: Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane\n\nReader:\n\nThen Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, \"Sit here while I go over there and pray.\" He took along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to feel sorrow and distress. Then he said to them, \"My soul is sorrowful even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me.\" He advanced a little and fell prostrate in prayer, saying, \"My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet, not as I will, but as you will.\" When he returned to his disciples he found them asleep. He said to Peter, \"So you could not keep watch with me for one hour? Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.\"\n\n(Matthew 26:36-41)\n\nMinister:\n\nLord,\n\ngrant us your strength and wisdom,\n\nthat we may seek to follow your will in all things\n\nSecond Station: Jesus, Betrayed by Judas, is Arrested\n\nReader: Then, while [Jesus] was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs, who had come from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. His betrayer had arranged a signal with them, saying, \"the man I shall kiss is the one; arrest him and lead him away securely.\" He came and immediately went over to him and said, \"Rabbi.\" And he kissed him. At this they laid hands on him and arrested him.\n\n(Mark 14: 43-46)\n\nMinister:\n\nLord,\n\ngrant us the courage of our convictions\n\nthat our lives may faithfully reflect the good news you bring.\n\nThird Station: Jesus is Condemned by the Sanhedrin\n\nReader: When day came the council of elders of the people met, both chief priests and scribes, and they brought him before their Sanhedrin. They said, \"If you are the Messiah, tell us,\" but he replied to them, \"If I tell you, you will not believe, and if I question, you will not respond. But from this time on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\" They all asked, \"Are you then the Son of God?\" He replied to them, \"You say that I am.\" Then they said, \"What further need have we for testimony? We have heard it from his own mouth.\"\n\n(Luke 22: 66-71)\n\nMinister:\n\nLord,\n\ngrant us your sense of righteousness\n\nthat we may never cease to work\n\nto bring about the justice of the kingdom that you promised.\n\nFourth Station: Jesus is Denied by Peter\n\nReader: Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. One of the maids came over to him and said, \"You too were with Jesus the Galilean.\" But he denied it in front of everyone, saying, \"I do not know what you are talking about!\" As he went out to the gate, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, \"This man was with Jesus the Nazorean.\" Again he denied it with an oath, \"I do not know the man!\" A little later the bystanders came over and said to Peter, \"Surely you too are one of them; even your speech gives you away.\" At that he began to curse and to swear, \"I do not know the man.\" And immediately a cock crowed. Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken: \"Before the cock crows you will deny me three times.\" He went out and began to weep bitterly.\n\n(Matthew 26: 69-75)\n\nMinister:\n\nLord,\n\ngrant us the gift of honesty\n\nthat we may not fear to speak the truth even when difficult.\n\nFifth Station: Jesus is Judged by Pilate\n\nReader: The chief priests with the elders and the scribes, that is, the whole Sanhedrin, held a council. They bound Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate. Pilate questioned him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" He said to him in reply, \"You say so.\" The chief priests accused him of many things. Again Pilate questioned him, \"Have you no answer? See how many things they accuse you of.\" Jesus gave him no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.... Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barrabas... [and] handed [Jesus] over to be crucified.\n\n(Mark 15: 1-5, 15)\n\nMinister:\n\nLord,\n\ngrant us discernment\n\nthat we may see as you see, not as the world sees.\n\nSixth Station: Jesus is Scourged and Crowned with Thorns\n\nReader:\n\nThen Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged. And the soldiers wove a crown out of thorns and placed it on his head, and clothed him in a purple cloak, and they came to him and said,\"Hail, King of the Jews!\" And they struck him repeatedly.\n\n(John 19: 1-3)\n\nMinister:\n\nLord,\n\ngrant us patience in times of suffering\n\nthat we may offer our lives as a sacrifice of praise.\n\nSeventh Station: Jesus Bears the Cross\n\nReader: When the chief priests and the guards saw [Jesus] they cried out, \"Crucify him, crucify him!\" Pilate said to them, \"Take him yourselves and crucify him. I find no guilt in him.\" ... They cried out, \"Take him away, take him away! Crucify him!\" Pilate said to them, \"Shall I crucify your king?\" The chief priests answered, \"We have no king but Caesar.\" Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus, and carrying the cross himself he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull, in Hebrew, Golgotha.\n\n(John 19: 6, 15-17)\n\nMinister:\n\nLord,\n\ngrant us strength of purpose\n\nthat we may faithfully bear our crosses each day.\n\nEighth Station: Jesus is Helped by Simon the Cyrenian to Carry the Cross\n\nReader: They pressed into service a passer-by, Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.\n\n(Mark 15: 21)\n\nMinister:\n\nLord,\n\ngrant us willing spirits\n\nthat we may be your instruments on earth.\n\nNinth Station: Jesus Meets the Women of Jerusalem\n\nReader: A large crowd of people followed Jesus, including many women who mourned and lamented him. Jesus turned to them and said, \"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep instead for yourselves and for your children, for indeed, the days are coming when people will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed.' At that time, people will say to the mountains, 'Fall upon us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!' for if these things are done when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry?\"\n\n(Luke 23: 27-31)\n\nMinister:\n\nLord,\n\ngrant us gentle spirits\n\nthat we may comfort those who mourn.\n\nTenth Station: Jesus is Crucified\n\nReader: When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him and the criminals there, one on his right, the other on his left. [Then Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.\"]\n\n(Luke 23: 33-34)\n\nMinister:\n\nLord,\n\ngrant us merciful hearts\n\nthat we may bring your reconciliation and forgiveness to all.\n\nEleventh Station: Jesus Promises His Kingdom to the Good Thief\n\nReader: Now one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying, \"Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us.\" The other, however, rebuking him, said in reply, \"Have you no fear of God, for you are subject to the same condemnation? And indeed, we have been condemned justly, for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing criminal.\" Then he said, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\" He replied to him, \"Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.\"\n\n(Luke 23: 39-43)\n\nMinister:\n\nLord,\n\ngrant us perseverance\n\nthat we may never stop seeking you.\n\nTwelfth Station: Jesus Speaks to His Mother and the Disciple\n\nReader: Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, \"Woman, behold, your son.\" Then he said to the disciple, \"Behold, your mother.\" And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.\n\nJohn 19: 25-27\n\nMinister:\n\nLord,\n\ngrant us constancy\n\nthat we may be willing to stand by those in need.\n\nThirteenth Station: Jesus Dies on the Cross\n\nReader: It was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon because of an eclipse of the sun. Then the veil of the temple was torn down the middle. Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit\"; and when he had said this he breathed his last.\n\n(Luke 23: 44-46)\n\nMinister:\n\nLord,\n\ngrant us trust in you\n\nthat when our time on earth in ended\n\nour spirits may come to you without delay.\n\nFourteenth Station: Jesus is Placed in the Tomb\n\nReader:\n\nWhen it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who was himself a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus; then Pilate ordered it to be handed over. Taking the body, Joseph wrapped it [in] clean linen and laid it in his new tomb that he had hewn in the rock. Then he rolled a huge stone across the entrance to the tomb and departed.\n\n(Matthew 27: 57-60)\n\nMinister:\n\nLord,\n\ngrant us your compassion\n\nthat we may always provide for those in need.\n\nClosing Prayer:\n\nMinister:\n\nLord Jesus Christ,\n\nyour passion and death is the sacrifice that unites earth and heaven\n\nand reconciles all people to you.\n\nMay we who have faithfully reflected on these mysteries\n\nfollow in your steps and so come to share your glory in heaven\n\nwhere you live and reign with the Father and the Holy Spirit\n\none God, for ever and ever.\n\nAll:\n\nAmen.\n\nScripture excerpts are taken from the New American Bible with Revised New TestamentCopyright © 1986, 1970 Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, Inc., Washington, DC.
