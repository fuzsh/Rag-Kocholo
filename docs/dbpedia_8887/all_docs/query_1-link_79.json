        "text": "No woman is an island. That’s the lesson of these fraught days that are underlining the interconnectedness of the real-life, worldwide web. But for some time now, Vogue has been focused on the idea of strength in numbers. In December, all 26 editions of the 127-year-old brand established Vogue Values. These core beliefs are focused on excellence in storytelling, inclusivity, and sustainability. This April those tenets are illustrated in a global series of model covers celebrating beauty and difference.\n\nThe three graces covering American Vogue are Ugbad Abdi, Adut Akech, and Kaia Gerber. Abdi, a hijab-wearing beauty discovered on the internet, was born in Somalia in wartime. At age nine, she moved from a Kenyan refugee camp to resettle in Des Moines, with her family. Akech, from South Sudan, was discovered in Australia, where her family sought refuge after living in Kenya. Gerber, a native of Los Angeles, is following in her supermodel mother Cindy Crawford’s footsteps. Together, these three models represent a new generation of strong Vogue women.\n\nThe April 2020 cover continues the magazine’s tradition of photographing models in groups. This practice can be traced, cover-wise, back to the 1930s. But really, it’s Irving Penn’s 1947 photograph of the 12 most-photographed models of the time that set the precedent for these types of sittings. Christian Dior put fashion on its post-war course that year with his ultra-feminine, curvy New Look. Decades on, a girl gang would guide fashion in new directions. Vogue turned 100 in the midst of the supermodel moment and celebrated that anniversary with a cover featuring 10 of the era’s glamazons.\n\nFlipping through a back issue of a magazine, it’s possible to identify an era both by its silhouettes and by its models. Twiggy, for example, is quintessentially 1960s. From Lisa Fonssagrives to the Insta girl, the model remains fashion’s main muse. What’s changed, and for the better, is our definition of “the girl next door.” We are the world.\n\nApril 2020\n\nSeptember 2014\n\nMay 2009\n\nMay 2007\n\nSeptember 2004\n\nNovember 2000\n\nNovember 1999\n\nApril 1992\n\nMay 1, 1947\n\nThis is an update of a story originally published on August 21, 2014."
