        "text": "Welcome to my very first rate y’all! This has been a long long time in the making, heck I waited over a year in that rate queue to bring you this list of forgotten classics and yesteryear bops!\n\nThis rate looks at Girl Band Débuts over the 1960s (sixties) up to the 2000s (noughties) period. The list was shortlisted with some of the more prominent girl bands of each decade (we will look at the influences the sounds have had on other artists and development of what we now have as a modern girl band as this all comes together).\n\nThe criteria myself and the wonderful @londonrain looked at to bring you this list include selecting the act’s ‘breakthrough’ hit (so as to give everyone a level playing field if you will, since some broke with a huge hit right away while others struggled a little before getting going!), we thought breakthrough would be the band’s first top 20 in one of these three significant markets – United States, United Kingdom and/or Australia.\n\nWith the moving politics and societal changes of these decades, many themes will come up in this list as we journey through these wonderful songs so please find the list below to score and comment on!\n\nList by decade (please use bolded links for better quality audio):\n\n'60s\n\nThe Shirelles – Will You Love Me Tomorrow\n\nThe Crystals - There's No Other (Like My Baby)\n\nThe Angels - Til\n\nThe Marvelettes - Please Mr Postman\n\nPatti Labelle & The Blue Belles - I Sold My Heart To the Junkman\n\nThe Exciters – Tell Him / Alternate Link\n\nThe Supremes - When The Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes\n\nThe Ronettes - Be My Baby / Alternate Link\n\nThe Chiffons - He's So Fine\n\nMartha & The Vandellas - Heatwave / Alternate Link\n\nThe Dixie Cups - Chapel of Love\n\nThe Shangri-Las - Remember (Walking In The Sand)\n\n'70s\n\nLove Unlimited – Walkin’ In The Rain With The One I Love\n\nThe Three Degrees – When Will I See You Again\n\nHoney Cone - Want Ads / Alternate Link\n\nThe Pointer Sisters - Yes We Can Can / Alternate Link\n\nFirst Choice - Armed and Extremely Dangerous / Alternate Link\n\nSister Sledge - Mama Never Told Me\n\nSilver Convention - Fly, Robin, Fly / Alternate Link\n\nHigh Inergy - You Can't Turn Me Off (In The Middle Of Turning Me On)\n\nPeaches - Substitute\n\nThe Nolans – I’m In The Mood For Dancing\n\nBaccara - Yes Sir, I Can Boogie\n\nThe Emotions – Best Of My Love / Alternate Link\n\n'80s\n\nThe Go-Go's - Our Lips Are Sealed\n\nBananarama - It Ain't What You Do\n\nMary Jane Girls – All Night Long\n\nKlymaxx - I Miss You\n\nThe Bangles - Manic Monday / Alternate Link\n\nPepsi & Shirlie - Heartache\n\nMel and Kim - Showing Out (Get Fresh At The Weekend)\n\nSalt-N-Pepa - Push It\n\nExposé - Come Go With Me\n\nShakespears Sister - You're History / Alternate Link\n\nSweet Sensation - Sincerely Yours\n\nThe Cover Girls – We Can’t Go Wrong\n\n'90s\n\nWilson Phillips - Hold On\n\nEn Vogue - Hold On\n\nTLC - Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg\n\nSWV - I'm So Into You\n\nEternal - Stay\n\nSpice Girls - Wannabe\n\nAll Saints - I Know Where It's At\n\nDestiny’s Child - No, No, No Part 2\n\nHoneyz - Finally Found\n\nB*Witched - C'est La Vie\n\nAtomic Kitten - Right Now\n\nXscape – Just Kickin’ It\n\n'00s\n\nDixie Chicks – Goodbye Earl\n\nSugababes - Overload\n\nBardot - Poison\n\nMis-Teeq - Why?\n\nGirls Aloud - Sound of the Underground / Alternate Link\n\nLas Ketchup - The Ketchup Song\n\nt.A.T.u. - All The Things She Said\n\nThe Pussycat Dolls - Don't Cha\n\nThe Veronicas - 4ever\n\nBooty Luv - Boogie 2nite\n\nDanity Kane – Show Stopper\n\nThe Saturdays - If This Is Love / Alternate Link\n\nSpotify list, provided by the wonderful @londonrain!\n\nThe rules:\n\n- You should all be well versed in the voting rules by now but if not - score each song out of 10 and give one 11 only, and that to your prized winner; or the song you think may need your help to go all the way!\n\n- Scoring-wise – I will accept all scores up to 10 including one decimal point behind them (ie I’ll take 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8 but not 9.25 or 9.75)\n\n- Comments are not compulsory but as you are aware from my participation in previous rates, I really appreciate them, and expect at least something for your 11 and your notable favourites or least favourites!\n\n- Troll votes will be discarded or asked to be altered so please don’t try it, especially as it takes away enjoyment from other participants.\n\n- Voting closes 28 days from today on March 13 @8pm (ish) AEST Time"
