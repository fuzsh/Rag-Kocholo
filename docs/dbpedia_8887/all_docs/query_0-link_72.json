        "text": "FOR THE LOVE OF BLACK GIRLS™\n\nVirtual Summer Conversation Series\n\nBlack girls wrestle with very distinct challenges and distractions during their formative years – including preoccupation with their skin complexion, hair texture, and body type; navigating depression, emotional stress and trauma; difficulty perceiving long-range consequences of their actions; and weakened self-esteem. However, with each annual iteration of the UNIQUELY YOU SUMMIT COVER GIRL COHORT, Cover Girls are charged with creating a social justice project that engages their peers. In 2021, Cover Girls have decided to host a virtual “Summer Conversation Series” that invited Black girls their age to discuss these topics.\n\nSATURDAY, mAY 22 @ 2-3:30 PM EST\n\nTopic: Same Shade, Different Day\n\nThe May Conversation will address Racism & Colorism and their impact on and among Black girls.\n\n“The Black female is assaulted in her tender years by all those common forces of nature at the same time that she is caught in the tripartite crossfire of masculine prejudice, white illogical hate and Black lack of power.” - Maya Angelou\n\nSATURDAY, june 26 @ 2-3:30 PM EST\n\nTOPIC: from curl to root\n\nThe topic for June will be Black Hair & Black Body Love, addressing Health and Wellness with Black girls.\n\nAudre Lorde said it best, “Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.”\n\nSATURDAY, july 31 @ 2-3:30 PM EST\n\nTOPIC: soulsista\n\nFor July, the Cover Girls will be discussing Black Girl Friendships with their peers.\n\nIs solace anywhere more comforting than that in the arms of a sister? - Alice Walker\n\nABOUT THE COVER GIRL COHORT:\n\nAnnually, we select a group of middle and high school girls (11 to 18 years old) to represent the organization as the official faces & voices of UNIQUELY YOU SUMMIT, INC. for a period of 12 months. We do not use stock images at UYS, every image associated with the organization portrays real girls who are associated with our work.\n\ncohort REQUIREMENTS (NO EXCEPTIONS):\n\nMust be 11-18 years old\n\nMust be a middle or high school student for the current & upcoming school year\n\nMust provide a copy of most recent report card\n\nPotential Cover Girls must have and maintain a “B” grade average\n\nMust be a resident of the Continental United States\n\nMust participate in the entire Virtual UNIQUELY YOU SUMMIT Weekend"
