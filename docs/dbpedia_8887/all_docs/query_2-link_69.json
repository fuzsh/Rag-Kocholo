        "text": "The next Kitchen Concert at the Sonoma Community Center will feature The Cover Girls on Sunday, Oct. 29.\n\nThe doors will open at 5:30 p.m. and the lucky listeners can hear the trio of local gals who have found a shared love of singing with each other.\n\nThe band consists of Susan Frye playing guitar, and Brigitte Doneux and Margaret Hatcher, both playing ukuleles. All three women sing, and there may be other instruments in the mix, as well.\n\n“This is our second Kitchen Concert as the Cover Girls,” Frye said. “We’ve had duos, we’ve had trios and we’ve played many concerts at the community center.”\n\nFrye and Doneux met during the pre-COVID halcyon days of Vox Populi, where many musical connections were made. Frye later met Hatcher while they were involved with the Hot Flashes, a Cynthia Tarr-led, all-female vocal group.\n\nTarr is the musical director of Sonoma Community Center, which will directly benefit from this concert. She excels at many musical things, not the least of which is finding and matching personalities and abilities to form successful vocal groups.\n\nThe trio was reached via telephone recently, with each person taking a moment to make a point, only to be spoken over by the others in a clearly fun and friendly, somewhat wild conversation. These women truly enjoy what they do and, obviously, enjoy each other.\n\nThe Cover Girls pride themselves on their singing abilities.\n\n“We just keep getting better and better,” Frye said, somewhat immodestly.\n\nHatcher added, “We do! We have complicated harmonies … ”\n\nThose three-part harmonies tend to form with Hatcher, who tends to sing in a lower range, taking the lead. The others then work to see what parts work best for that particular song.\n\n“The harmonies are so gratifying,” Frye said. “It is so fun to sit around the kitchen … the voices are just right with each other.”\n\nWhen asked if there was anything new the audience can expect, Doneux answered, “Sue is playing the melodica,” with Frye heard in the background laughing, and lots of shared guffaws.\n\nThey play an eclectic mix of tunes, all “covers,” or new performances of existing songs. The trio will touch upon the McGarrigle Sisters, Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Crowded House, among many others.\n\n“We are all over the place,” Hatcher said, saying that there needs to be a way to add three-part harmony to a song “or it gets tossed out.”\n\nDoneux is learning how to play the four-string banjo, indicating that this trio is always looking to up their game, and not just vocally. Get there early for this Kitchen Concert as you do not want to be seated by the refrigerator.\n\nActually, these concerts are not really held in the kitchen anymore, but you do want a good seat to watch these women work and play together. The Cover Girls will delight on this late October night."
