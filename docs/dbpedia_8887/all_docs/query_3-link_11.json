        "text": "In my younger years I was pretty obsessed with France. I suppose like a lot of teenage girls, this was testament to a romantic notion of what it meant to be French; I spent too much time watching Jules et Jim and Le Mari de la Coiffeuse, and though I had barely visited the country I was convinced that nothing would make me happier than possessing a Citroën 2CV, a house with shutters and a fluent command of the French language.\n\nI was in France last week, driving through the Dordogne. It was harvest time for the vineyards, and I passed a fair amount of time admiring the lilac shade of the sky at dusk, and the grapes hanging sweet and heavy on the vine. As reception allowed, I flicked between radio stations. It was an odd mix, Maroon 5 and Taio Cruz thrown in with strangely familiar French pop – Gaetan Roussel's Dis-Moi Encore Que Tu M'Aimes, for instance, sitting up against Flo Rida's Club Can't Handle Me. There were a number of Anglo-French songs too, and their lyrics composed in a pleasing kind of Franglais: \"Unsmooth me,\" implored my favourite, \"Ruffle me up somewhat.\"\n\nIt took me back to the days of my French obsession, to the time when, in the record shop where I worked, I would pass idle moments in the world music section, admiring the cover of the Françoise Hardy album Yeh-Yeh Girl From Paris. Hardy was my favourite of the yé-yé girls, and in fact I'd been thinking about her quite a lot recently, spurred on by Fabienne Delsol's wonderful new record On My Mind, which ploughs a not too dissimilar furrow.\n\nYé-yé was born out of a collision between rock'n'roll and French popular culture, the melodrama of the chansonniers such as Juliette Greco and Edith Piaf giving way, in the early 1960s, to something a little more light-spirited. It flourished on an enormously popular radio show named Salut les Copains, which included a feature named Le chou-chou de la semaine (This week's sweetheart), showcasing the latest yé-yé singers – among them Hardy, Sylvie Vartan, Jacqueline Taieb, and France Gall. The music was by turns dreamy, flirtatious, and endearing, dealing with first love and distant crushes, while the singers themselves were characterised by their youth, their femaleness and their apparent innocence. It was perhaps rock'n'roll's coyest moment.\n\nIt was Serge Gainsbourg who took yé-yé's innocence. In 1963, he began writing songs for France Gall, a partnership that began with N'Ecoute Pas les Idoles (Don't Listen to the Idols) and ended with Les Sucettes (Lollipops), a track whose lyrics roughly translate as: \"Annie loves lollipops/ Aniseed lollipops/ When the liquid runs down her throat/ She is in paradise.\" Gall, too naive to understand the double meaning of the lyrics, sang the song happily, \"with an innocence of which I am proud\", she said later. When she was informed that Les Sucettes was little more than an homage to oral sex, she declared herself \"mortified\" and hid away for weeks.\n\nBetween the idols and the lollipops, Gall succeeded in winning the Eurovision song contest with a song written by Gainsbourg – Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son. The translation is broadly Doll of Wax, Doll of Sound, a nod from Gainsbourg that Gall was no more than a singing doll. The lyrics underline the doubtful sentiment, comparing the singer to a fashion doll, while the listeners are rag dolls, falling for her music with no reason at all; a questioning, in essence, of a music industry devoted to thrusting forward that week's sweetheart.\n\nI listened to the song again this week, and something about it made me smile. \"À quoi bon chanter ainsi l'amour sans raison/ Sans rien connaître des garçons?\" Gall wonders. \"What good is it to sing about love, when I know nothing about boys?\" I thought about the peculiar charm of that age when your head is full of romantic notions of what it means to be something else – to be an adult, to be French, to be in love; the time when we are always singing, in one way or another, of something we know nothing about."
