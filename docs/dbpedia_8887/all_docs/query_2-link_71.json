        "text": "The “Cover Girls” Holiday Concert\n\nSubmitted by Sangeeta Prasad Benbow, President Friends of the Library\n\nKathy and Mary have been singing all their lives, but officially together for 6 years where they have crafted their own unique style under the duo name of Cover Girls. They have performed together and individually at a variety of venues – Carnegie Hall, The Papermill Playhouse, Ocean Grove’s Great Auditorium, Church Tour of Ireland, St. Peter’s Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, along with local country clubs, weddings, and holiday events.\n\nUsing carefully selected backing tracks, and researching classic 20th-century tunes, they bring an innovative and refreshing flash from the past. Upbeat, tight harmonies will have you humming along and sometimes dancing as they deliver their timeless and fun Cover Girls songs.\n\nThe Friends of the Library sponsored a free family concert on Sunday, December 11 at the New Providence Memorial Library for a Holiday show, where concertgoers heard their Cover Girls’ classics along with the holiday songs you know and love.\n\nPlease contact the library at 908-665-0311, or visit our website at newprovidencelibrary.org to learn more about activities, and to find out how to become a member of the Friends. We welcome new volunteers. Stop by the library to get books (of course!) and watch a movie, get a museum pass, attend a concert, or see the latest artwork. Our programming includes arts & crafts events and projects, author events, book clubs, computer language courses, and the yearly Craft Fair – all of which are supported or sponsored by the Friends.\n\nAdditionally, brand-new artwork has been installed in the Conti Room, Reading Area, and glass cabinet. Stay tuned for details and stop by to view the work! Check the library’s website to see what movies are playing this month, and stop in to borrow Museum passes (just like you’d check out a book)."
