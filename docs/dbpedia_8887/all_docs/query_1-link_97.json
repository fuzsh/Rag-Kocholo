        "text": "The Olympic Games are underway from Paris!\n\nFor a full rundown of all the events each day, we have a full breakdown of everything airing, along with where and how to watch. Every Olympic event will be streaming live on Peacock.\n\nWhen it comes to the medal count, the United States is the favorite to win the most medals. China is unlikely to overtake the U.S. in the overall medal haul, but has a chance to win more gold medals than the Americans.\n\nSo which country is leading in medals after the first day of competition? Here is a look at the Olympic medal count (and keep reading for some Team USA highlights from Day 2).\n\nHere is the full leaderboard, last updated July 28 at 5 p.m.\n\nParis Summer Olympics 2024\n\nThe last Summer Olympics in which the United States did not top the gold medal table was in 2008 in Beijing. Countries always get a medal bump being the host nation, and France is expected to almost triple the number of gold medals it won in Tokyo.\n\nTeam USA won seven medals on Sunday, bringing their total to 12 for the first two days. Of those 12, nine have been won by female athletes, and U.S. women finished first and second in two events for the day: the 100m butterfly in swimming, and the fencing individual foil.\n\nTeam USA Highlights: Day 2\n\nSIMONE BILES SHINES, DESPITE INJURY\n\nSimone Biles is already making history in Paris.\n\nThe 27-year-old became the first women's gymnast to land a Yurchenko double pike vault at the Olympics, taking hold of the high score in the event with a 15.800. It's a move that already had been re-named after her — now commonly known as the \"Biles II.\"\n\nBiles holds the high score in the all-around after completing her four events at qualifying for the 2024 Paris Olympics on Sunday. She closed the day with a 14.433 in uneven bars, which currently stands as the eighth-highest score in the event.\n\nBiles holds the high score in vault (15.300), floor (14.600) and the second-highest in beam (14.733) for an all-around total of 59.566.\n\nHer U.S. teammates are right behind her, with Suni Lee scoring a 56.132 for the second highest all-around score and Jordan Chiles sitting third with a 56.065.\n\nThe U.S. women's gymnastics star is in position to advance to the finals in each event, assuming she isn't limited by injury. Biles was heard on camera saying she felt something in her calf but stepped onto the competition floor with the leg taped.\n\nShe appeared just fine when Taylor Swift’s “Ready for It” began playing and her routine — the hardest in the world — was solid. She walked gingerly off the floor and sat off to the side for a moment before receiving a hug from longtime coach Laurent Landi.\n\nDespite dominating in qualifying, Biles appeared to aggravate her leg during warmups for the floor exercise. She left the floor with Team USA doctor Marcia Faustin and later returned with her ankle taped.\n\nFIRST ALL-U.S. FINAL IN FENCING SINCE 2008\n\nIt was American vs. American in the women's individual foil fencing bout.\n\nLee Kiefer topped Lauren Scruggs 15-6 to win gold, while Scruggs claimed silver in the first time ever the U.S. had two women in the final bout.\n\nKiefer also won gold in Tokyo, completing a back-to-back triumph.\n\nALL THOSE SWIMMERS ARE GOLD (OR SILVER, OR BRONZE)\n\nIt was 1-2 Team USA to top the podium in the women's 100m butterfly Sunday in Paris.\n\nAmerican Torri Huske upset teammate and world record holder Gretchen Walsh, who was favored in the race, to take gold with a 55.59 time.\n\nSeparately, Carson Foster took bronze in the men's 400m individual medley. And in the men's 100m breaststroke, New Jersey's Nic Fink tied with Adam Peaty of Great Britain with a 59.05 time to take silver in what was a nail-biting race in which the top three finishers were separated by just 0.02 seconds.\n\nMEN'S BASKETBALL, USWNT START STRONG\n\nHere's a scary thought for the rest of the basketball world: LeBron James thinks Team USA can get even better.\n\nThe U.S. men's basketball team opened the 2024 Paris Olympics with a 110-84 win over Serbia. James and Kevin Durant hit every shot they took in the first half as the team shot over 62.3% from the field and connected on 18 3-pointers. They rather easily disposed of one of their top threats, which is led by three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic.\n\nBut the U.S. committed 17 turnovers.\n\n\"We're gonna get better with our turnovers,\" James told NBC after the game. \"Obviously we're trying to make the right play so you can never exclude that, but some of the careless turnovers that we had, that we can give ourselves even more possessions offensively. We'll be better coming out on Wednesday.\"\n\nThe U.S. put on a statement against Germany Sunday.\n\nAfter a 3-0 win versus Zambia in the opener, the USWNT routed Germany 4-1 to further put a stamp on Group B. The U.S. can secure first place in its group with at least a draw on Wednesday versus Australia.\n\nSophia Smith scored a brace, while Mallory Swanson and Lynn Williams also got on the scoresheet against a usually elite German side that just couldn't contain the USWNT's attacking potency.\n\nStephen Wade of the Associated Press contributed to this report."
