        "text": "Oh, to be on the cover of Vogue. Never in a million years could I imagine myself on the cover of Vogue, or any magazine, to be fair, even though I know girls who have landed teen magazine covers themselves. As a minority and as an East Asian (Chinese) American girl, are my chances of landing a magazine cover the same as my white friends? Judging by the American Vogue covers from the last 20 years, my chances are virtually nothing. Not because I am not currently a supermodel, or even training to walk the runways, but because of the prominent lack of representation of East Asian women on Vogue covers. An East Asian woman has never once been on a cover by herself. And I cannot remember the last time I saw an East Asian model on any magazine cover by herself or himself. Although some may argue that cover models are becoming more diverse in the 21st century, minorities, such as the black and East Asian communities, are still incredibly underrepresented in the magazine industry.\n\nA study conducted by the Peninsula Press showed that from 1990 to 2017, only three Asian women appeared on the Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar magazine covers combined: Liu Wen, Lucy Liu, and Fei Fei Wen, who was on the foldout of the Vogue magazine, not the front. Looking at the covers from 1892 to 1990, no East Asian models were ever featured. In comparison, according to an article published in Vogue in 2017, 90 dogs have graced the cover of the publication since its debut in 1892.\n\nWhile there have been more Vogue covers featuring black women compared to East Asian women, according to research published by The Pudding, when looking at the five covers with the most dark-skinned women, one woman alone — Lupita Nyong’o — accounts for three of those five. On the other hand, looking at the five covers with the lightest Vogue cover models from 2000 to 2019, there are five different women represented.\n\nThere are certainly more black models and actors, which Vogue could have featured, instead of choosing just a handful. Lupita Nyong’o was featured multiple times because she was Vogue’s token black model. Evidently, Vogue has not made a significant and necessary effort to be inclusive of all members of the black community. Instead, it seems that they have solely used a handful of black models to try to give the impression of being more inclusive and diverse.\n\nOften referred to as the “fashion bible,” Vogue is the most popular fashion magazine in the world, and as stated on the Condé Nast website, the magazine is a “synonym for the culture of fashion, of style…”. It has even been parodied in a movie–The Devil Wears Prada.\n\nMy twin sister, Sabrina, said that “I think that a lot of girls probably think that whoever is on the cover of Vogue is beautiful. I feel that the models, in a way, shape societal norms of the definition of beautiful as well.”\n\nIn society, Vogue Magazine is surely viewed as a global icon, in fashion and culture. As stated by Vogue on their website, the readership for Vogue solely in the United States is 11.1 million monthly readers. Its following on social media measures to a tremendous 52.7 million followers. I am one of those followers. With such an immense readership, Vogue fails to portray a message of inclusivity and accepting all minorities to young women and readers by mainly publishing the racial majority in the United States.\n\nI emailed Vogue and called Anna Wintour, Vogue’s editor-in-chief, for an interview on how Vogue chooses their cover models, and how she was working to improve the diversity issue. Although Wintour’s representative communicated that she would be in contact with me through email, she has not reached out. Another representative at Vogue U.S., James, was unwilling to answer any of my questions as well.\n\nBeverly Johnson, the first black female to be on the cover of Vogue, said in an op-ed for the Washington Post that she was paid less than her white peers, and that she was chastised for asking for black photographers, stylists and makeup artists. “Silence on race was then — and still is — the cost of admission to the fashion industry’s top echelons,” said Johnson.\n\nOnly 21 black female models have appeared solo on the cover of Vogue from 2000 to 2019. This means that in 19 years, only 9% of Vogue covers featured black female models.\n\nThat number is even lower when looking specifically at East Asian women. From 1990 to 2017, Vogue published 324 issues. East Asian women graced 0.6% of their covers. On the other hand, American supermodel and actress Lauren Hutton — who has the record for the most Vogue covers — appeared on the cover 26 times. She alone makes up 8% of the Vogue covers. Unsurprisingly, Hutton has blonde hair and blue-green eyes, the typical image of a Vogue cover model. None of the East Asian models appear solo, and when they do land a cover, their faces are never in the middle of the group — always on the side, like Liu Wen’s cover, which was Vogue’s “diverse” cover.\n\n“I have never quite seen myself on-screen. Maybe in Keanu Reeves or Olivia Munn, but even so, the side of myself that is understood as Asian — that is seen — is as washed away as theirs, and that is because we live in a world that doesn’t make time for ambiguity, that continues to reward whiteness with privilege,” said Thessaly La Force, who is half Chinese, in a 2014 New York Times article. La Force mentioned in her piece that it is very rare for an Asian American to be cast in a lead role in Hollywood, and usually, if one is cast, they are the “token Asian American actor,” similar to Lupita Nyong’o’s situation.\n\nThis is little evidence that the magazine is trying to improve the diversity of the cover models. In February 2017, Vogue released a cover featuring women of many races, including Adwoa Aboah, Liu Wen, Ashley Graham, Vittoria Ceretti, Imaan Hammam, Gigi Hadid, and Kendall Jenner. An article written by Vogue on this cover included a statement saying that, “In a climate of immigration bans and building walls, the biggest names in 2017 make the case that there isn’t just one type of American girl — nor has there ever been.” But if one examines the cover models on Vogue since its beginning in 1892, it seems almost as if there really is only one type of American girl: the white female that is featured so often on Vogue’s cover.\n\nSo what are my chances of being on the cover of Vogue as a minority in America? Probably less than my dog at almost zero. Hopefully, those chances improve in the future, and Vogue will be able to fulfill its “role as a cultural barometer for a global audience,” as they claim to be on their website, in a more comprehensive manner. Because as my friend, Delaney Musgrave, who herself models for the designer, Sherri Hill, said: “Who doesn’t want to be on the cover of Vogue?”"
