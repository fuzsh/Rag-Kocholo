        "text": "It's official: Zendaya is fashion royalty. First she got the Rihanna stamp of style approval for her 2017 Met Gala look, and now Anna Wintour gave her the thumbs up with a Vogue cover. Zendaya graces the July cover of the magazine with a shoot from legendary photog Mario Testino and a profile full of glowing quotes from the likes of Michael Kors, who called the 20-year-old former Disney star \"fashion fearless.\"\n\nPosing for a Vogue cover right out your teens is a pretty big life accomplishment box to check. We were wondering who the youngest Vogue US cover stars to date are — and it turns out to be an elite group who all went on to mega-careers in fashion, acting, and modeling.\n\nWay back in 1947, model Carmen Dell’Orefice landed the cover of Vogue at age 15. But '80s sensation Brooke Shields and her famous brows made a Vogue cover debut in February 1980 when she was just 14 years old. Brooke might hold onto this record, because in 2012, Vogue editors across the globe promised that no edition of Vogue will work with any model under the age of 16.\n\nIf you're going to have as many covers as the Supers, you have to get started early. Naomi Campbell got her first Vogue cover at age 19 in September 1989, Cindy Crawford landed hers at age 20 in August 1986, Claudia Schiffer was also 20 years old for her Vogue August 1990 cover, and Christy Turlington was 21 for her Vogue April 1990 cover.\n\nIn the '90s, Amber Valletta claimed her February 1993 Vogue cover at 19, Kate Moss posed for the July 1995 cover of Vogue at 21, and an 18-year-old Gisele Bündchen landed her first Vogue cover in July 1999.\n\nThe biggest models of today managed to squeeze in their first Vogue covers in their very early twenties. Gigi Hadid scored her first US cover of the magazine at age 21 in August 2016 and then-20-year-old Kendall Jenner covered the coveted September issue that next month. When Vogue put out its famous \"InstaGirls\" cover in 2014, 22-year-olds Cara Delevingne and Karlie Kloss shared the cover spotlight with Joan Smalls, 26. And Kate Upton posed for Vogue's June 2013 issue at age 21.\n\nA fresh-faced Britney Spears made the cover of Vogue in November 2001 at age 19 (that was circa \"‘I’m a Slave 4 U\"). Taylor Swift managed to land her Vogue cover in February 2012 at the age of 22, and she's had two more covers since then.\n\nSo Zendaya, here's a list of your fellow actresses who posed on the cover of Vogue before they could legally drink: Claire Danes (age 19), Kiera Knightley (age 20), Natalie Portman (age 20), Elle Fanning (age 19), Kristen Stewart (age 20). Then there's Blake Lively (age 21) and Emma Watson (age 21).\n\nHere's looking at you, kids!"
