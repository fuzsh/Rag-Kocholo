        "text": "The UK’s biggest-selling gadget magazine, Stuff, is to drop scantily-clad models from its front cover after feedback suggesting such images were alienating readers.\n\nStuff, which has used images of “girls with gadgets” on its covers since its launch in 1996, said focus groups and sales trials had shown that cover girls were out of touch in a post-lads’ mag era.\n\n“Stuff was launched in 1996 at the peak of the lad mag era,” said Stuff editor-in-chief Will Findlater. “Nearly 20 years on – and with tech now an indispensable part of everyday life – our readership has changed. The covers used to help our position on the newsstand but our research tells us this is no longer the case.”\n\nStuff, which has a monthly circulation of more than 77,000, has seen its traditional audience shift dramatically over the past two decades with 40% of readers now women.\n\nThe title ran focus groups to critique a range of covers. This was followed by sales tests of Stuff’s April, May and June issues with 20% of the print run devoted to “non-girl” covers in four regions of the UK.\n\nSales of the “non-girl” editions outstripped those with the magazine’s traditional covers.\n\n“While the decision to drop the cover girls from Stuff is based on what our audience have told us through focus groups and cover trials, there is no question that it feels like the right decision to make,” said Stuff publishing director Rachael Prasher. “At the industry level, we see this as a big step forward for men’s lifestyle magazines.”\n\nThe decade-long decline in the lads’ magazine sector was underlined earlier this year with the closure of Nuts, which along with arch-rival Zoo shook up men’s weeklies a decade ago.\n\nRupert Murdoch’s the Sun is the target of the No More Page 3 campaign, which aims to get the tabloid to stop using pictures of topless women in its pages.\n\nLast year, Esquire editor Alex Bilmes sparked a row after admitting that the magazine uses pictures of “ornamental” women for male readers.\n\nHe criticised women’s magazines for being “less honest” about how women are portrayed, arguing there is a code of using young, thin models and a lack of ethnic diversity.\n\nTo contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
