        "text": "What is Girl Scouts?\n\nGirl Scouts is more than an activity—it’s a Movement dedicated to building girls of courage, confidence, and character who make the world a better place.\n\nWhy do girls love being Girl Scouts?\n\nGirl Scouts is a way of life that brings out the best in your girl, even in the most challenging of times. While they’re learning about STEM, the outdoors, entrepreneurship, and important life skills, Girl Scouts are also discovering new ways to make their family and community stronger, kinder, and better for everyone.\n\nHow does it work? What’s a “troop”?\n\nGroups of Girl Scouts, called troops, typically meet weekly or every other week for an hour or two. Guided by adult volunteers, troop members choose the hands-on activities and projects that excite them, try new things, and cheer each other on. Together, they earn badges to reflect their successes and show the world what they’re made of.\n\nWhat’s the goal?\n\nMaking sure girls are given the opportunity to reach their full potential by developing values and skills that will lead them to happier lives."
