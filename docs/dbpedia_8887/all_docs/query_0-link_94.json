        "text": "What’s up folks! Well, it’s the fourth quarter and the beginning of the Holiday season. And though the Freestyle market does NOT come to a complete stop, it does however slow down a bit.\n\nAt a time when a few extra shows for the artists would be appreciated, many promoters just don’t see the value.\n\nAny activities outside of tradition these days, usually can’t stand against the Holiday Spirit that most of us grew up possessing, and aside from a Halloween show or two, and maybe even one for News Years, there isn’t much more happening in regards to Freestyle club or concert events.\n\nI remember back in the day when a Holiday show, particularly New Years’ eve would command at the very least double the fee for an artist, and if it was out of state, accommodating the artist’s immediate family was usually part of the deal.\n\nSeptember through January for many acts can be trying, but does it still have to be that way? Most artists and fans alike should now have grown kids, maybe even with their own families, and therefore those Holiday routines should start loosening up a bit.\n\nBut is that enough to get fans out of the house and to the clubs or other events during the Holidays?\n\nI’m not talking about replacing our traditions with these Freestyle festivities, but rather adding to them. I’m talking about making the Season to be Jolly… just a bit more Jollier!\n\nCould it be that Holiday Freestyle events are missing that Holiday vibe?\n\nYes, as corny as it may seem, maybe adding to shows, a Holiday theme, might just be that all too obvious fix that most are looking past.\n\nWhy should a Christmas show be no different than a show put on a few months prior? What could be done differently to give Holiday events more of that Holiday feel? Because if we can figure that out, I believe that we can change the entire trajectory of Freestyle during the Holidays.\n\nAttending Freestyle events during the Holidays can become just as much a tradition as Trunk or Treating has become, volunteering at the shelters, or that midnight madness that happens on Black Friday.\n\nWhile others are at Walmart fighting over the last Xbox, the rest of us could be at the club having the time of our lives, with the ones that we love.\n\nThe Holiday season, starting with Halloween, in fact, should be our busiest time of the year, and also the most profitable for our promoters.\n\nIf you know a club promoter who you think should consider putting something together for the Holidays, do me a favor and Share this article with them, and let me know if it helped!\n\nAlso, I placed a link down at the bottom of this Newsletter with a FREE download to some cool Freestyle Festivities that Angel and I came up with, to help add a little more of that Holiday spirit to your Freestyle event… Hey, you never know, huh?\n\nAnyway, I’m glad you’re here, and I hope you enjoy this month’s issues of The Freestyle Blast Newsletter. Now let’s get into it!\n\nShare\n\nNational Hispanic Heritage Month is an annual celebration observed from September 15th to October 15th in recognition of the contributions and influence of Hispanic Americans to the history, culture, and achievements of the United States.\n\nAnd how could I recognize such a celebration without acknowledging our very own Freestyle community? Derived from a genre of music created by the Urban Latino Youth of New York City, that has not only sustained itself for over 30 years but also the many families, including my own. Now if that isn’t a contribution to our history, then what is?\n\nWe celebrate those of our past who have become icons in our community, way too many to list. From politicians, activists, actors, artists, and musicians, we seem to forget the icons that live with us today.\n\nOur Freestyle community is filled with living legends. Artists, writers, and producers, who, not having been given the opportunity to share with the world their God-given talents, instead paved their own way, as well as the way for others, through the thorny weeds of the music industry.\n\nA path that has since found its way to the masses, to people of other races and nationalities, who have now embraced Freestyle as their own, and from them, even more talent has been born.\n\nOthers from outside of our community who had at one point no faith in what this genre could do were quick to come aboard once it was proven. And though they may claim to be the reason that Freestyle has been so successful, my gratitude will always be to the creators themselves, while the others I will only credit its flaws.\n\nThough every day you deserve to be celebrated, on National Hispanic Heritage Month, Freestyle, its culture, and its community shall also be celebrated!\n\nLeave a comment\n\nWell, it’s October, it’s cooling down, and the leaves are starting to fall, and as children start making their way through the isles of department stores, undecided on what they wanna be this Halloween, I again dive deeper into the promotion of my second novel, Feastyle, a story of an incredible famous Freestyle artist who just so happens to be a vampire.\n\nFive novels in, and I have to say, Feastyle was definitely the most difficult to write, and probably for no other reason than the fact that growing up, I just wasn’t into anything horror.\n\nNot movies, not books, and though, Halloween was indeed my favorite holiday, (if I could call it that) my costumes were usually one of the more popular superheroes.\n\nGhosts, Zombies, Frankenstein, and even Vampires I never considered dressing up as, and as I sit here dwelling on it even more, I wonder, could it have been because I was raised like an only child, with older siblings already out of the house, and a bedroom I had to sleep in all by myself? Or could it have been that traumatic movie experience I had when big sister Cindy took me to the movies to watch The Exorcist?\n\nThe story of Feastyle came to me over several years, while on the road with Lil’ Suzy. I remember joking about our lives on the road, living like Vampires, where we traveled and slept during the day, but at night we’d come alive!\n\nThe idea, marinated over many years, until one day I felt compelled to put it into writing, not knowing that my true disconnection from the world of horror would bring my entire project to a complete halt after just a couple of chapters.\n\nI’ve always laughed at the claim of writer’s block as I myself seemed to possess an unlimited source of ideas, so many in fact that most will probably never be told.\n\nSo what happened? Was my block due to a lack of knowledge or inexperience within the horror universe? Or was I subconsciously just too afraid to go in that deep?\n\nI had openly committed to writing this book, publishing my proposed release dates on all of my Social Media platforms, a release date that was approaching fast, so fast in fact that I knew that making the deadline would be impossible.\n\nThough I’m sure that people cared less than I thought, I still had to renege, but when I did, this time no date would be announced, not until the book was completed and ready for the presses.\n\nFor the next year and a half, I devoted myself to the one thing that back in the day I would never have even given any thought. Horror, particularly that of Vampires, submerging myself deep into their dark and dreadful world.\n\nEvery book, movie, and website I could get to, I did, not to mention several phone conversations with my long-time friend and the artist behind a couple of my book covers, Pete Hernandez (RIP) who blew me away with his in-depth knowledge of Vampires, and not only did I learn more than I even thought existed, also I developed a ton of respect for this incredibly bizarre world.\n\nFinally, I was done, proud that I had obeyed all the rules, and created a story that Vampire enthusiasts themselves would be good with.\n\nFeastyle is the first horror novel ever written based on the Freestyle music genre, and with Lil’ Suzy as the cover model, I hope this book also lives on for eternity.\n\nAlex Ramos, J Anthony Poin Dexter, Caroline Esposito, A Juanie Legacy Rodriguezz, Rebekka Rolon, Abytka Cruz, Nancy Jimenez Jimenez, Hector M Pola, Corlyn Jacobsen, Herb Jackson, Valerie Padilla, Noah Roper, Joseph Puig, Angela Gozzi, George Vences, Pamela Distefano, Pete Zavala, MarLa Ivette Melendez, Guadalupe Ortiz, Cristina CeCe Gomez, Lewis Martinee, Defne Faria, Donovan Santos, Lynn Susan, Gio M Torres, Sharon Surette Nelson, Jonathan Karis, Priscilla Laboricua Ortiz, Manny Man, Brenda K Starr, Abimael DjWiz Arlequin, Blanca Fernandez, Carlos Ramos, and me… Latif Mercado.\n\nTo all our Subscribers, Readers, Subjects, and of course our SPONSORfor Sponsoring this month’s issue of the Freestyle Blast Newsletter, Thank you all so much!\n\nand until next month…\n\nThis was your Freestyle Blast!\n\nNational Hispanic Heritage Month\n\nJust a Few Influential Hispanic Americans Who Made History\n\nFree Holiday Ideas for your Freestyle Event\n\nLatif Mercado has been a part of the Freestyle Music scene for well over 25 years, and though his role, in the beginning, was minimal, the role he’s been playing ever since, has been massive, and a major force behind the genre’s continued success.\n\nAs a Booking Agent with a who's who roster of Freestyle Legends, as well as his managerial involvement with such industry icons as Lil' Suzy and The Cover Girls, rarely would you find a Freestyle event happening without Latif somewhere in the mix.\n\nIn an attempt to make people aware of the fact that Freestyle isn’t just a music, but rather a culture, La’ began writing books, in hopes of reaching fans through a medium they would never expect, and in 2011, his debut novel, FREESTYLE FOR LIFE, did just that!\n\nSince then, Latif has released several books that, not only feature Freestyle as part of its overall theme but also its main characters of Latin descent.\n\nThough born and raised in New York, Latif currently resides in North Carolina with his wife, two grown children, four grandkids, and a dog named Coco.\n\nLatif loves hearing from his readers, answering questions, and sharing whatever advice he possibly can, whether it be on writing, or maybe something Freestyle related, so be sure to reach out, even if it’s just to say hi.\n\nFor more information, or just to connect follow on all platforms, @LatifMercado"
