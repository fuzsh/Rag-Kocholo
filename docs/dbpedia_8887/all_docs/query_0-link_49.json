        "text": "In the 1950s, the Noxzema Chemical Company of Baltimore, Maryland – known mainly for their Noxzema Skin Cream – began a program of diversification. It hired new staff with experience in sales, advertising and product development, and started creating and market testing new lines.\n\nAmongst the new products brought to fruition were two medicated cosmetics, a liquid make-up and a compressed powder. First sold nationally in January, 1961, they were introduced with an extensive magazine and television advertising campaign targeting teenagers and young women. The products sold well and Noxzema added a loose powder to the line later in the year.\n\nThis modest beginning marked the start of the incredibly successfully Cover Girl brand. Noxzema had some experience with skin-care cosmetics but the company had never sold make-up before so the ‘overnight’ success of Cover Girl was quite remarkable.\n\nAbove: 1961 Cover Girl Liquid Make-up and Cover Girl Compressed Powder in three shades. A differently coloured compact was made for each shade: White for Light; Red for Medium; and Brown for Dark. The Dark shade was subsequently renamed as Brunette.\n\nMedicated Make-up\n\nCover Girl was formulated with some of the medicinal compounds already used in Noxzema Skin Cream – such as camphor, menthol, clove oil and eucalyptus oil – but also included the bactericides methylparahydroxybenzoate, propylparahydroxybenzoate and hexachlorophene. As bacteria are associated with pimples and other skin blemishes, the inclusion of parahydroxybenzoates and hexachlorophene allowed Noxzema to claim that Cover Girl was ‘really good for the skin’ and ‘better than not using make-up at all’.\n\nIn October, 1972, the U.S. Food and Drug Authority (FDA) restricted the use of hexachlorophene but Noxzema – by then renamed the Noxell Corporation – had pre-empted the FDA announcement and removed the substance from its lines earlier in the year. However, as Cover Girl make-up still contained other bactericides the company could still describe the cosmetics as medicated.\n\nSee also: Hexachlorophene\n\nThe idea of developing a medicated make-up line may have come from Mary Ayers who worked for the advertising agency Sullivan, Stauffer, Colwell & Bayles (SSC&B). She had previously suggested increasing Noxzema Skin Cream’s market share by promoting it to women as a medicated facial cleanser and water-soluble beauty cream.\n\n[T]he most popular acne treatment for teens was a flesh-colored medicine called Clearasil, a slightly opaque ointment that came in a tube and had a distinctive, rather unpleasant, scent. Mary suggested to her client that Noxzema also develop a medicated, flesh-colored product, but make it opaque enough to cover the skin like a makeup and produce a range of shades. The treatment would actually contain Noxzema, which smelled more medicinal than most cosmetics, but had a more pleasant odor than most acne applications.\n\nOthers have suggested that it was Noxzema’s vice president of new product development, William (Bill) Hunt, who came up with the initial proposal.\n\nThe name ‘Cover Girl’ appears to have originated with Carolyn Oelbaum, a junior copywriter who also worked for SSC&B (Scott, 2013). It was a good choice as it suggested that the make-up ‘covered’ while at the same time opened up the possibility of using models on the covers of magazines as the basis for an advertising campaign.\n\nUnfortunately, Crystal Products trademarked Cover Girl in Britain in 1962; however, they ceded it to Noxzema in 1964.\n\nYouth market\n\nAs the target audience for Cover Girl was teenagers and young women, the cosmetics were packaged for sale in drug and grocery stores where most price-sensitive young women bought their cosmetics and most other Noxzema products were sold.\n\nAbove: 1966 Co-Ed High School Cover Girl Contest. These contests began in 1962 and suggest that Noxzema targeted late teens very early on. The first winner was Nora Schraeder, aged 17.\n\nInitially, the three Cover Girl make-up lines – liquid, compressed and loose powder – were only sold in three shades – Light, Medium, and Dark but this was extended to four – Creamy Light, Light, Medium, and Brunette by 1964. However, this meant that Cover Girl was still only suitable for individuals with lighter skins.\n\nTo promote sales, customers were encouraged to buy more that one shade of Cover Girl and use them for contouring.\n\nUSE LIGHTER SHADES to accentuate or bring forward features that need emphasizing.\n\nReceding chin? Carefully blend a light shade of foundation over the jawline from ear to chin.\n\nNose too small or retroussé Lightly blend a streak of lighter makeup right down the center of the nose over your regular shade.\n\nCircles or lines under eyes? Blend a very light foundation over these areas first, then apply your regular liquid make-up shade over it.\n\nUSE DARKER SHADES for contrast or to diminish features that may appear too prominent.\n\nFace too round or too square? Blend darker base or powder nest to jawline from ears to chin in a long triangle.\n\nNose too long? Apply darker base over the tip only.\n\nNose too wide? First apply darker base along the sides of nose, blending carefully into adjoining areas. Then apply regular make-up shade over your entire nose.\n\nAbove: 1963 Cover Girl counter display case.\n\nWhen Cover Girl Lipsticks were added in 1964, this idea was used again, with suggestions to mix different lipstick colours to create an individual shade or look.\n\nExperiment with color, mix and match several shades of Cover Girl Lipstick. Try outlining your lips with one color, filling in with another.\n\nSee also: Corrective Make-up (Contouring)\n\nPromotion\n\nBy 1962, Cover Girl had achieved sales volumes well over half of the all time record for Noxzema Skin Cream, something that must have astonished the company. Much of the credit for this success lies with the SSC&B television and print advertising campaign.\n\nThe SSC&B campaign that the agency devised for Cover Girl combined models and known magazine mastheads. This required SSC&B to get agreement from magazines such as ‘Redbook’, ‘McCall’s’, ‘Teen’, ‘Women’s Day’, ‘Harper’s Bazaar’, ‘Vogue’, ‘Glamour’, ‘Co-Ed’, ‘Life’ and ‘Look’ to use their mastheads in Cover Girl advertising. Pressure from other cosmetic companies such as Revlon caused many of these magazines to rescind these agreements within a year or two but by then the Cover Girl brand was well established. Not all of the magazines capitulated and those that were still available to Cover Girl continued to be used in advertising for some time to come.\n\nTelevision advertising was critical to the success of the brand. As Hazel Bishop and Revlon had demonstrated in the 1950s, this relatively new medium could be very effective in selling cosmetics.\n\nAbove: Cover Girl Make-up by Noxzema.\n\nSee also: Revlon and ‘The $64,000 Question’\n\nThe success of Cover Girl soon had other cosmetic companies like Revlon, Max Factor and Chesebrough-Pond’s adding medicated make-up ranges – in some cases also using hexachlorophene – but these new entries failed to stop the expansion of the Cover Girl brand.\n\nModels\n\nThe Cover Girl campaign is sometimes credited with starting the trend of using named models in advertising leading to the development of what is now known as the ‘supermodel’. Although overstated, Cover Girl was the first brand to widely use identified models across print, radio and television and this elevated the status of models and turned many of them into household names.\n\nAbove: 1946 article from LIFE magazine that reflects a growing interest in models.\n\nClean make-up\n\nIn 1968, Noxell shifted gear and began advertising Cover Girl as ‘Clean Makeup’.\n\nAbove: 1968 Cover Girl Clean Make-up.\n\nIt looks and feels like no other make-up at all.\n\nThat’s Cover Girl Medicated Make-up.\n\n(the one professional cover girls have used for years.)\n\nBut because it goes on clean, stays on clean, we call it clean make-up. And unless you’ve tried it, you don’t know how much good it can do.\n\nOr how sheer it is. Or how it never streaks or cakes.\n\nThe look is clean. The feeling is clean.\n\nThat’s because Cover Girls’s has something no other make-up has. Noxzema medication.\n\nAntiseptic action that fights germs.\n\nSpecial moisturizers that help the skin stay smooth.\n\nIt all adds up to make-up that’s good for your skin.\n\nAnd that’ quite a lot.\n\nBrunette models were used in the ‘Clean Makeup’ advertising but blondes – such as Cybill Shepherd [b. 1950] – tended to predominate as they looked cleaner and fresher.\n\nExtending the range\n\nIn 1962, Noxzema added Cover Girl Matte Make-up, a cream make-up sold in a tube.\n\nAbove: 1962 Cover Girl range: loose powder, compressed powder, liquid and cream matte make-up.\n\nIn 1964, Cover Girl Lipsticks were introduced in eight shades (Real Red, Clear Crimson, Pure Scarlet, True Rose, Natural Peach, Pink Beige, Pastel Pink, and Natural Frost) with frosty shades (Beige Caper, Pink Whim, Bare Minimum, and Orange Fling) and two lip toners (Boss Gloss, and Bold Gold) added in 1966, and near-neon ‘Flasher’ shades (Natural Flash, Amber Flash, Pink Flash, and Lightning Flash) released in 1967.\n\nAbove: 1964 Cover Girl Lipsticks.\n\nAll of these products were made and packaged by private label firms. In 1966, Noxell decided to move some of this manufacturing in-house. It opened a new plant in Cockeysville, Baltimore County, Maryland and, by the following year, this factory was used to make packaging for Cover Girl cosmetics and assemble the various lines using product delivered in bulk from private providers.\n\nAbove: 1968 Cockeysville factory.\n\nFull-scale manufacture in-house of some Cover Girl cosmetics – Cover Girl liquid and tube make-up and Cover Girl Plus 3 – did not commence at Cockeysville until 1968, by which time Cover Girl Liquid Make-up was the top-selling make-up line in the United States, with Cover Girl Pressed Powder coming in second. The high demand for Cover Girl products might explain why Noxell introduced new pilfer-proof packaging for the Cover Girl range in that year.\n\nAbove: 1969 Cover Girl products in new packaging.\n\nOther Cover Girl lines added in the 1960s included: Glow Lightly, a brush-on blusher in three shades (1967); Plus 3, an acne remedy in three shades (1968); and Pearlies lipsticks in four shades (1969).\n\nAbove: 1969 Cover Girl Plus 3 acne treatment in three shades: Light, Medium and Brunette.\n\nSee also: Your Winning Look by Cover Girl (1969).\n\nIn 1970 – the same year that Max Factor launched its Pure Magic Super-Sheer Medicated Make-up line – Noxell introduced a range of Cover Girl Super Sheer cosmetics better suited to the prevailing ‘natural look’. The range started with three products: Cover Girl Super Sheer Liquid, a foundation in Sheer Bare, Sheer Buff, Sheer Blush, and Sheer Beige shades; Cover Girl Translucent Powder, a pressed powder in Sheer Nude, and Sheer Natural shades; and Cover Girl Translucent Blusher Duo, a double-panned blusher in Sheer Peach/Peach Glow or Sheer Pink/Pink Glow sets.\n\nThe following year, Noxell released Cover Girl Eyes Make-up (1971), a line of 47 products that included mascaras, eyeshadows and eyebrow pencils.\n\nAbove: 1971 Cover Girl Eyes.\n\nOther make-up lines introduced in the 1970s included: Cover Girl Gloss & Gleam, a compact blusher and lip gloss, Super Gloss for Lips (Super Sheen line), and Shiny Shadow, a cream eyeshadow in pots (1972); PeeperSticks eyeshadow crayons (1973); Cover Girl Long ’n Lush Mascara, Softline Eyeliner, Softline Eye Shadow, and Moisturized Big Eye Shadow (1974); 9-Hour Eye Polish, a liquid shadow and liner in one; Cover Girl Shiny Lipsticks (1975); Cover Girl One-Stroke Eye Colors (1976); and Professional Mascara, Color-Matics Eye Shadow, and 9-Hour Cheek Color, a liquid blush (1978).\n\nAbove: 1975 Cover Girl make-up range. Top: Cover Girl foundations, compressed powders, concealer and blushers. Middle; Cover Girl eye make-up. Bottom: Cover Girl lipstick and lip pots.\n\nWhen Cover Girl Nailslicks nail polishes were added in 1977, Cover Girl now had products in each of the main categories of make-up: face, eyes, lips and nails.\n\nRealising that its initial target audience was growing up, Noxell also began to introduce Cover Girl products for women who were 25 years or older. Starting with Cover Girl Moisture Make-up, and Cover Girl Moisturizing Cover Stick in 1973, Noxell added three additional cosmetics in 1976 – Moisture Cream Make-up, Moisture Cream Blush, and Moisture Encapsulated Pressed Powder – thereby creating the Cover Girl MoistureWear Make-up range.\n\nAbove: 1979 Cover Girl MoistureWear Make-up Collection.\n\nAlso, in 1976, Noxell added Cover Girl All-Day Oil Control Liquid Make-up in five shades, later complementing it with Oil Control Translucent Powder (1978), also in five shades, and Oil Control Powder Blush (1981). The company now had three lines of face make-up based on skin type: Regular for normal skins, Oil Control for oily skins, and MoistureWear for dry or older skins.\n\nAbove: 1976 Cover Girl make-up display stands.\n\nOverseas markets\n\nAlthough Cover Girl was very successful in the United States and Canada, Noxell did not rapidly globalize the brand. Noxzema had not been marketed globally so when it came to selling Cover Girl overseas, Noxell tended to rely on exporting or licensing agreements. The first foreign branch was opened in Britain in 1964 but it was not unti 1977 that the Noxell Corporation (U.K.) Ltd. was established and manufacturing began there. By 1977, Cover Girl was being distributed in nine European countries and – through an arrangement with Lion Dentrific Co. Ltd. in 1973 – was also sold in Japan. However, sales outside of North America were modest.\n\nIn North America, the line continued to strengthen in the 1980s achieving sales that were better than Maybelline, making Cover Girl the leading mass-marketed cosmetics line in the United States at the time. Both companies committed large amounts of money to advertising, particularly television, and it is estimated that Noxell was spending US$20 million on Cover Girl advertising or about 20% of its sale’s earnings by 1980.\n\nLater developments\n\nCover Girl’s premier position attracted the attention of Procter & Gamble – which did not have a make-up line in its stable of products at the time – and, in a stock-swap deal valued at US$1.3 billion, Procter & Gamble acquired the Noxell Corporation in 1988. Procter & Gamble operated the brand until 2016 when, as part of a major reorganisation, they sold Cover Girl and 42 other brands to Coty.\n\nTimeline\n\nFirst Posted: 16th February 2016\n\nLast Update: 14th March 2024\n\nSources\n\nJones, G.
