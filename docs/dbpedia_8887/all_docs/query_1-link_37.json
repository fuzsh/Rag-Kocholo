        "text": "Wassup again Blastards and Blastets! and welcome to the 6th issue of The Freestyle Blast Newsletter. I have to tell you this month was nuts, but you know what, I’m not complaining. Between Lil’ Suzy, The Cover Girls, and Angel OCG, I am booked solid to the end of 2022, and after nearly two years off the road, thanks to covid, I am thrilled and incredibly grateful.\n\nHuge shout out to all you loyal fans who have been attending the many Freestyle events happening throughout the country. If it wasn't for you this genre would not exist!\n\nMake sure you read to the end, cause that is where I’ll let you know what Freestyle events are headed your way, and if you have any questions, you can either hit me up or leave a comment over at our IG page Freestyle Blast.\n\nIn this issue, I touch on two very important topics. The first one of course is about our trip to New York City for a Surprise appearance on the Wendy Williams Show, and the other is an interview I did with DJ Oldskool… You guys are gonna love him!\n\nAlso, check out the Birthday Blast, and if you know anyone on that list, please share this with them.\n\nThis issue of The Freestyle Blast Newsletter is Sponsored by our friends over at Trieste95 Beauty, a favorite of Lil’ Suzy and if you click on the banner and make a purchase using Lil’ Suzy’s code, you’ll get 25% off… So make sure you check that out.\n\nOkay, let’s get to it… ready, set, go!!!!\n\nTHE COVER GIRLS ON NATIONAL TV\n\nTHE COVER GIRLS ON NATIONAL TV\n\nIf you’re a fan of Freestyle music, then there’s no way you missed seeing The Cover Girls on The Wendy Williams Show!\n\nAnd even if you missed the show itself which aired on Tuesday, May 17th, 2022 you definitely caught it on one of the many reposts that nearly broke Freestyle’s Social Media circuit.\n\nFor years, people wondered why haven’t the “real,” “Authentic,” and “Original Cover Girls,” performed in New York yet, and though a million and one reasons have echoed throughout, the truth is, and this is straight from me, their manager! The timing just wasn’t right!\n\nOh, many calls have come in for the Originals, most from fans who were simply tired of going to New York Freestyle concerts only to find performing as the Cover Girls, Three that were basically put together for no other reason than the financial convenience of old management, and to stop Angel from performing, but that’s a whole other issue!\n\nToday I want to talk about the opportunity that I got, that allowed me to fulfill my promise to my group in general, and my wife in particular, and again, for those unaware that Angel, the lead singer of The Cover Girls is my wife, you might be hanging on the wrong block.\n\nAnyway, the promise went as follows, I will not, after 30 plus years send you, The Original Cover Girls back home to perform at a simple club, or even one of the concerts, many of which I have cheered on, still weren’t special enough for that ultimate return of The Cover Girls, until finally, I got the call I’d been waiting for.\n\nAnyone whose been following the group since their reunion back in 2011, has seen even among the original ranks, a few changes.\n\nStarting in 2008 when Angel met up with her original sister Cover Girls, Caroline and Sunshine, and though they didn’t perform, it was a glorious reunion not just for them, but for anyone else who was around them at that moment.\n\nThen, three years later, I pulled them together again, but this time, Sunshine wasn’t available but Margo was, and from there they were off and running!\n\nIt didn’t take much to get them back on the road, but it did take a lot to keep them there!\n\nOh, there were plenty of people who were against this reunion, some pretty powerful people at that. But what I learned during this time is that there is nothing more powerful than the fans.\n\nThese absolutely incredible people whose only motive to keep the Cover Girls around is to be able to enjoy one of their favorite Freestyle groups, unaltered. That when they paid to see The Cover Girls perform, that’s who they were getting!\n\nThanks to Social Media, we have been able to not only promote the many\n\nlive shows we have done over the past several years since their reunion, but have also been able to tell the Cover Girl story, through each member, rebuilding their fanbase one post at a time.\n\nThe biggest issue we were facing toward the beginning was trying to get to the promoters before others did. This I knew was going to take time, and had to be strategic.\n\nMany times promoters would call me, upset that the performance that they just booked the past weekend, that they thought were the Cover Girls were not, and though, club and concert events could always fix this at a later date, an opportunity like the one we had with The Wendy Williams show was pretty much a once in a lifetime.\n\nWhat would’ve happened if they had called the wrong group?\n\nThe call came directly to me, and I’ll be honest, it caught me off guard and I actually hesitated, but once it became clear I knew, we had to make this happen.\n\nIt was dated exactly one week before we would hit the road for a straight four-month run without one weekend available, cause had it been any other time, we probably wouldn’t have been able to do it.\n\nWe were just coming off of a long covid break, and I had to get everyone together, and sure enough, no one was free!\n\nCaroline retired, Michelle was unavailable, Sunshine was under the weather and Margo had a prior engagement, and though having Angel perform solo was an option being considered, she was adamant to get her girls on national TV, and did!\n\nThe minute I gave them the green light, the entire process kicked into gear, flights were booked, and hotels secured. A mail-in Covid test was shipped to each of us, where we had to administer it ourselves and overnight it back, and one by one we were each texted the word we were hoping for… “Negative!”\n\nA new show tape with just their biggest hit, Show Me had to be edited down to exactly three minutes and sixteen seconds along with a lyric sheet and a video that showed the routine. This they would use to block the cameras before we arrived.\n\nI also emailed over a lead sheet with the lyrics, and even color-coded lead and background vocals.\n\nA pre-Interview Zoom was scheduled with one of the producers, just to get everyone comfortable and go over some of the logistics.\n\nWe were asked to come in the day before, which was great as Angel and I hadn’t been back to New York City since we moved out fifteen years ago. Oh yeah, we did do a solo show on a yacht a couple of years back, but that didn’t count.\n\nWe were fully accommodated with a pick-up at our home, first-class flights, and a drive to the hotel that had us both quiet the entire way, each of us glued to our own window.\n\n28th and 6th were where we stayed, and what we thought might’ve been a day of anxiety seeing that we had been away from the hustle and bustle for so long, instead seemed as though we had never left.\n\nAngel and I are city folk, and will always be.\n\nA thousand dollar a night hotel, with some of the best restaurants just walking distance from where we stayed, and we still couldn’t help but have just one thing in mind… Pizza!!!\n\nAnd there it was, right across the street from where we were staying, too small to even be considered anything more than a Pizza oven crammed into the side of a building, so small in fact that it had just one wobbly round table that stood halfway in, and halfway out, and though we would’ve gladly paid twenty-dollars a slice, this one was just a dollar! Our entire dinner… six bucks, the best six bucks we’ve spent on food in a long time.\n\nWe decided to walk a bit and take in what we’d missed for so long, running into our sister Cover Girl, Sunshine right outside the hotel, until we decided to call it a night to get ready for the big day ahead.\n\nOur car arrived at around noon to take us to the Studio, it was me, Angel, and Sunshine. Margo lives in the city, so they sent her another car.\n\nWe decided to step out and wait outside the studio to be escorted inside and immediately the girls were spotted by a few of the people who had been waiting in line.\n\nA few pictures and autographs were their pleasure until we were brought inside. The last time I was brought into a TV studio was when Lil’ Suzy did Sabado Gigante in Miami, sometime in the early 90s.\n\nI have a deep love for film and TV, and the feeling that I got stepping into that studio, was overwhelming, but then, on top of that, here I am, doing something you could’ve never told me that I would be doing. A group, and not just any group, but rather The Cover Girls, who had been oppressed, threatened, and bullied out of New York for so long, and here I was, not just bringing them back, but rather, bringing them back for the ultimate performance, one that will be viewed by not hundreds, or even thousands, but rather millions, throughout New York and across the country.\n\nA small office was our first stop, and for what? What else? another rapid Covid test!\n\nInto the tiny elevator driven by a huge man, up to the 4th floor we went\n\nTwo dressing rooms, one for them, and one for me, yay! Completely catered and donned with everything that would make a star feel like a star! Even I felt like a star.\n\nCovid test went through and we were all cleared. Next step… Rehearsal!\n\nDown to the studio, we went, behind the walls of an amazing set and an incredible crew, each one came up and introduced themselves, and immediately we were all put at ease as I was invited to watch from where the audience would be watching in just a few hours.\n\nI’m so used to being on stage checking everything, adjusting mics and monitors, and maybe even giving a little two cents to the girls, so not only was being able to just sit back and watch kind of weird, it was actually kind of nice!\n\nTo watch so many people on stage, though each doing a different task, together they moved like the wind, and when they were done and stepped back, I immediately understood why they had this job!\n\nI forgot each of their titles so for the sake of clarity, I’ll just refer to them all as producers, and I watched as two of them took the stage behind each mic and did a run-through so the girls could see their vision.\n\nIn just a few takes the girls knew the moves, the cameras knew their positions, and the lighting was set and ready.\n\nOne last run-through sent us all into applause.\n\nBack upstairs we went, for a light lunch and to start getting ready. I had requested the studio’s very own Glam Team to glam up the girls, and that is exactly what they did.\n\nWhat a great and talented bunch they were, getting The Cover Girls ready to be seen on national television and in front of Millions.\n\nAs each one got up from their chair, the hairs on my body stood taller. They weren’t made up to be beautiful, they were already beautiful, but that glam team knew how to prep them for those cameras.\n\nTen minutes! I heard, echoing through the corridor, followed by a knock on the dressing room door to escort us downstairs.\n\nBack into the tiny elevator again with the rather large fella, and down to the studio that was now dark and packed with people.\n\nThe audience, loud and excited, as that week’s guest hosts, Leah Remini and Michelle Visage read the teleprompter a bit confused as they truly had no idea what was to come.\n\nIt was their last episode hosting the show, and was a surprise by the producers, to have the Cover Girls perform.\n\nI stood at the far right behind the teleprompter control and a big ass camera that kept blocking my view. But nonetheless, as the crowd jumped to their feet and cheered as Sunshine, Angel and Margo walked out onto a New York stage for the first time in over 30 years, the knot lodged in my throat nearly strangled me!\n\nI caught myself looking at the stage, then at the monitor behind the camera to see what they were catching, it was as if I was trying to absorb the entire experience, and from the different perspectives.\n\nI swear, I held my breath for practically the entire performance, and when my wife ended it by saying “I’m a beast, y’all!” I knew at that very moment that we had just done something incredibly special!\n\nThough I’ve known Michelle Visage for many years and was looking forward to seeing her again, I did miss the opportunity to meet Leah Remini, who I’ve been a fan of for many years because we had a flight to catch, and car already outside ready to tackle that New York City traffic.\n\nJust as we had ridden to New York, silent and in deep thought, back to the airport was the same, but this time, it wasn’t about being nervous about doing the show, or the fact that we were back home for the first time in years, but because we had just had the most exhilarating experience, and if you’ve been following our struggle over the years…. You’ll know exactly why!\n\nAnd if you haven’t yet seen the Cover Girl’s episode on The Wendy Williams Show, well…. > CLICK HERE TO WATCH\n\nI’ve been touring the Freestyle circuit around the United States for many years, way before Social Media even existed, and I remember people really believing that they were the only ones that were into Freestyle music.\n\nWhen I would tell New York Freestylers how popular the genre was in Dallas Texas, or Chicago Freestylers how popular it was in California they’d look at me as if I had two heads.\n\nBut then, when I would tell any of them just how popular Freestyle was in Canada… Forgetaboutit! They’d nod me off as if I was making that shit up.\n\nBut it’s true, Canada is an incredibly strong Freestyle market, and it’s not just because they’re so close to the United States, because so is Mexico, and though Mexico has always been an incredibly supportive country, not to mention Mexicans I believe take up the majority of the fan base in the U.S., Canada has an actual active Freestyle community within, consisting of promoters, artists, producers, record labels, clubs and of course DJs… lots of them!\n\nHowever, from all the Canadian DJs that I’ve met during my travels to and from the country, none have ever stood out like this one guy I’m about to tell you about, and he goes by the name of DJ OldSkool, and he is, without doubt, another one of Freestyle’s Amazing DJs.\n\nAnd today, I’m standing on the corner of Adelaide and Bay waiting for him to arrive. We’re gonna step into this restaurant to talk. The only thing is… I forgot to ask him what he was driving, until I realized it didn’t matter, cause here he comes walking down the block, wearing a knapsack.\n\nA quick greeting, before we step into the restaurant and are seated in a corner next to the window. It’s a beautiful clear day out as the waitress hands us a couple of menus.\n\nA little friendly chit-chat about the weather and Canada in general as I browse the lunch specials, though no matter what, I always end up going with the good ol’ reliable burger, fries, and a diet Coke!\n\nOldSkool, however, passes on the order and instead reaches into his bag and pulls out a sandwich.\n\nSo you brought your own sandwich? I asked him.\n\n“Yeah, I’m not crazy about the food here!” he says, “You mind” he then asked, holding up his sandwich, and so I nod and he takes a bite, and so I decide to proceed with the interview while I await my food.\n\nLATIF: You use the name DJ OldSkool… but what should we call you? Joe, Oldskool… How ‘bout JoeSkool, nice ring to it, huh?\n\nOLDSKOOL: Lol I’ve been called worse! Honestly, some people call me Joe, some call me Oldskool I am good with any of it. I must say though, JoeSkool does have a pretty cool ring to it!\n\nLATIF: Okay, so, I’ll just stick with Joe! So tell us, Joe, where were you born, and raised, and how old are you?\n\nOLDSKOOL: I was born in Toronto Canada and raised in a suburb just outside of the city known as Port-Credit (Mississauga) I will be turning forty-seven this month thankfully with my rekindled passion for Djing and the power of Freestyle music I feel twenty again! It’s amazing\n\nLATIF: What kind of kid were you growing up?\n\nOLDSKOOL: I grew up an only child, and was the youngest cousin of a large Italian Family! I always loved music, loud music, and played it at high volumes, just ask my neighbors! laughs I was also the kid who loved to laugh and make others laugh. A Joker you could say.\n\nLATIF: You know Joe, artists of all types, I’m talking singers, dancers, painters and of course DJs, all had someone who sort of influenced their come up. Who was yours?\n\nOLDSKOOL: Luckily for me, there were a lot of kids in my neighborhood that were older, maybe 18, 19, and they were the ones that were heavily into Djing, they’re the ones who really influenced me, and when we started attending parties, while my friends stood around just mingling, I’d either be DJing or studying whoever was, checking out their style. I became obsessed with it, and here I am thirty-two years later. But if you wanted to know one person in particular who I feel played a big role in me DJing, I would have to say, Cameron Paul, a popular DJ from the Bay Area.\n\nLATIF: He passed away, didn’t he?\n\nOLDSKOOL: Yeah, like in 2018\n\nLATIF: So how old were you when you actually started DJing?\n\nOLDSKOOL: I was fifteen years old.\n\nLATIF: That was pretty young, and not something a typical fifteen-year-old would be into, what were your friends into at the time?\n\nOLDSKOOL: At fifteen, my friends were all into sports, video games, girls, and causing shit!\n\nLATIF: So what attracted me to you was, one day I watched you spinning on Tik Tok, and I notice that you are strictly vinyl.\n\nOLDSKOOL: Oh yeah, Techniques 1200s, in fact, I still use the same exact pair from when I first started!\n\nLATIF: Why?\n\nOLDSKOOL: I am a veteran of vinyl and a part of a very special group of DJs, and I’ve remained loyal to the art of spinning records which has become a very unique craft.\n\nLATIF: I totally agree, there’s nothing like watching a DJ rock the tables.\n\nOLDSKOOL: Yes, and when you’re spinning vinyl, you can’t pull any tricks. You either got it or you don’t, and if you don’t… everybody will know it!\n\nLATIF: I’ve watched you, bro… You’re no joke!\n\nOLD SKOOL: Thank you, I put my heart and soul into every set. I build suspense and release it, constantly trying to keep my audience engaged and taking them on a journey with me.\n\nLATIF: With the skills you have, why just Freestyle, Joe?\n\nOLDSKOOL: I don’t know, I guess it’s about the culture. It’s kind of hard to explain.\n\nLATIF: Oh I know exactly what you mean, I’ve even Vlogged about it.\n\nOLDSKOOL: really? I have to check that out.\n\nLATIF: So what’s the secret Joe, how do you keep them things spinning all these years?\n\nOLDSKOOL: Oh that’s simple, I only Play Freestyle! (laughs)\n\nLATIF: Perfect answer!\n\nOLD SKOOL: No, serious, like anything… take care of it and it will take care of you. Every 4-5 years I bring my tables in and have them rewired, inspected, and cleaned, even lubed if needed… but truthfully the Technics 1200s were built to last! They are ‘in my opinion” the epitome of what a turntable should be as far as DJs go.\n\nLATIF: That’s one hell of an endorsement bro, are they sponsoring you?\n\nOLDSKOOL: Nope.\n\nLATIF: Well, Imma tag’em with this interview, ‘cause they need to hear this!\n\nLATIF: So what about radio? Were they playing Freestyle when you were coming up?\n\nOLDSKOOL: Oh Yeah, all the time, and two stations, in particular, Energy 108 and 88.1 on Saturday Nights, I used to get so excited.\n\nLATIF: Do you remember the first Freestyle song you ever heard on the radio?\n\nOLDSKOOL: I can’t remember exactly which song was first, but a few that come to mind that I feel are responsible for creating the Freestyle Freak in me are Shannon’s Let the Music Play, The Cover Girl’s Show Me, Stevie B’s Party your Body, Connie’s Funky Little Beat, and Noel’s Silent Morning.\n\nLATIF: Oh, those bangers would turn anyone into a freak!\n\nOLDSKOOL: Yup, those were the culprits! Lol\n\nLATIF: What about record stores? Where were you shopping?\n\nOLDSKOOL: Oh man, I basically lived in three of them, and every week I gave them practically all my money. Holding up his fingers he counted off the three record stores, Play De Records, Lots of Discs, and Starr Sounds, located in Down-Town Toronto.\n\nLATIF: Here’s one that most DJs can easily answer, let’s see if you could. What was the first Freestyle record you ever bought?\n\nOLDSKOOL: Super easy question… Shannon’s Let The Music Play!\n\nLATIF: And also a first for many DJs I’ve spoken to.\n\nOLDSKOOL: I remember because I had to practically fight for the last copy. It almost got ugly!\n\nLATIF: Did you get it\n\nOLDSKOOL: hell yeah, and I still got it!\n\nLATIF: What about the record companies bro, which labels did you look for?\n\nOLDSKOOL: That Red and Yellow of course.\n\nLATIF: Mic Mac!\n\nOLDSKOOL: The one and only!\n\nLATIF: Mic Mac was definitely a trailblazer, but I’ll be honest it wasn’t the label I was expecting to hear.\n\nOLDSKOOL: You thought Metropolitan.\n\nLATIF: I did, remember I worked at Metro for several years, and when I toured Canada it was always with Lil’ Suzy, Collage, Joee, Chris & Alexia Phillips, not to mention Tiamo Records, a Canadian label that was actually distributed by Metropolitan.\n\nOLDSKOOL: Don’t get me wrong, I am a Huge Fan of Metropolitan Records, as well as Viper, Tasmania, Fever Records, and High Power Records. My favorite artist of all time is Lil Suzy, but looking at the overall View… I think Micmac was a Label that was pumping out some amazing music with artists such as Cynthia, Johnny O, Soave, Tonasia and so many others. I think the reason why it was more desirable to me was that it was rare to find them in Canada. A lot of these tracks were purchased before leaving the US, and when they did arrive here in Canada they were usually set aside for selected DJs. No such thing as online buying in those days!\n\nLATIF: And they were expensive too, I remember doing an instore at one of the shops in Canada and seeing a little Suzy single selling for like $35.00\n\nOLDSKOOL: Yeah, they were imports.\n\nLATIF: How excited were you when you first started spinning Freestyle?\n\nOLDSKOOL: So excited! It was new and fresh and the girls loved it! I would crank that shit up at the club and watch the crowd go wild. It became an obsession, something I really connected with. I mean Freestyle is about life and love and who can’t connect with that?\n\nLATIF: A hundred percent!\n\nOLDSKOOL: I still remember my first gig, it was a wedding.\n\nLATIF: A wedding?\n\nOLDSKOOL: Yeah, I’ll never forget it. The bride and Groom were Freestyle fanatics and requested it all night long, in fact, their first slow dance was to, Love Me For Life by Stevie B.\n\nLATIF: Oh man, I love that song!\n\nOLDSKOOL: Yeah, me too, I was in my element that night, and let’s just say the banquet hall manager had to pull the plug! Laughing\n\nLATIF: So do you play any of the new Freestyle music or are you strictly about the classics?\n\nOLDSKOOL: I like to incorporate both. I mean, I’ve always been a supporter of Freestyle music new and old, the only real challenge I’m facing though with the new stuff is that it is rarely found on vinyl, and that’s what I spin!\n\nLATIF: So tell me, what’s gonna happen when there’s no more Freestyle vinyl being made, do you think you’ll ever go over to the dark side and go digital?\n\nOLDSKOOL: Over the years I have tried several times to switch over, and I can honestly say that it’s just not for me. There’s a special place in my heart for Vinyl, and the way it was taught to me thirty-two years ago! Something about the feel of actual vinyl, and the sound it produces, that crispiness that gets me every time. To me, it can never be replaced, totally unparallel to anything else.\n\nLATIF: Sort of the way I feel about books!\n\nOLDSKOOL: Yes, not to mention the fact that, if the last of us start making the switch, the craft would eventually become extinct... But still, I’ll never say never!\n\nLATIF: That last statement might’ve just extended your career.\n\nOLDSKOOL: Exactly, so make sure you print that!\n\nLATIF: I love hearing about this bro, I mean I’ve practically dedicated my entire life to Freestyle, and I have a soft spot for DJs, a lot of them are my friends.\n\nOLDSKOOL: I could tell, and plus I love talking about it, and it’s such an honor to be able to share my story with you and your readers.\n\nLATIF: Okay Joe, I tried to cover as much as I could to really let the people know who you are, but I’m sure there’s something that I might’ve missed, help me out and tell us something I didn’t cover.\n\nOLDSKOOL: Latif I think you did a great job… and I’d like to thank you for this opportunity to sit and chat with you, but I’d like to thank everyone out there who has taken the time to tune in to my live streams the past two years… My wife created an account for me two years ago on TikTok right at the peak of this pandemic… it has rekindled a passion created from my childhood… it has given me the opportunity to connect with Freestyle Culture and various music lovers from around the world….
