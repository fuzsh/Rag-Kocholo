Thirty-three years later, it was upgraded to an intermediate college in 1869. Mr. JC Bose was appointed the first principal. Within a year, the college had to close because of financial constraints. It was reopened in 1871 with the help of a grant of Rs 10,000 donated by Roy Bahadur Golakchandra Roy of Dhum of mirsharai upazila.\n\nInitially, the college offered courses of up to FA (First Arts) level.
