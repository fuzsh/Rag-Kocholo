        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIn this benchmark five-volume study, originally published between 1922 and 1955, Surendranath Dasgupta examines the principal schools of thought that define Indian philosophy. A unifying force greater than art, literature, religion, or science, Professor Dasgupta describes philosophy as the most important achievement of Indian thought, arguing that an understanding of its history is necessary to appreciate the significance and potentialities of India's complex culture. Volume III offers an examination of the Bhaskara school of philosophy, the Pancaratra, the Arvars, the Visistadvaita school of thought, the philosophy of Yamunacarya, the Ramanuja school of thought, Nimbarka's philosophy, the philosophy of Vijnana Bhiksu, and the philosophical speculations of some of the selected Puranas.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nSurendranath Dasgupta was a scholar of Sanskrit and philosophy. Dasgupta was born in Kushtia, Bengal (now in Bangladesh) in a Vaidya family. His ancestral home was in the village Goila in Barisal District. He studied in Ripon College Calcutta and graduated with honours in Sanskrit. Later, he received his master's degree from Sanskrit College, Calcutta in 1908. He got a second master's degree in Western Philosophy in 1910 from the University of Calcutta."
