Originally Dasgupta’s plan was to write out the history of Indian systems of thought in one volume. This was the first and only attempt to write out in a systematic manner a history of Indian thought directly from the original sources in Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit.\n\ncontext information\n\nThe history of India traces the identification of countries, villages, towns and other regions of India, as well as mythology, zoology, royal dynasties, rulers, tribes, local festivities and traditions and regional languages.
