An originary myth is like a prelude or an epigraph which key tunes the scholar for the reception of the main system in its multiple inner and outer aspects. A vast variety of the originary myths are available in the holy Hindu scriptures such as Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, Tantras, Agamas, and others. They all narrate the stories of the divine origin of the spirit, matter, gods or goddesses and point to their essential relations as they are rooted in the irrefutable metaphysical truths concerning man’s life here and hereafter. These myths unveil the underlying reasons for man’s primal ignorance and its available remedies in order to demarcate the real from the unreal and natural from the supernatural. A critical study of these myths will help the students peep into the hidden substrate of those spiritual and philosophic systems that are woven around them.\n\nReading List:\n\nMyth and Mythology—Eric Edward\n\nA Handbook of Hindu Mythology—Geore H.

The four-course series introduces Meditation in theoretical, philosophical, and practical perspectives. It discusses the forms of meditation in different spiritual disciplines such as Vedic, Buddhist, Jainist, Saivite and Vaisnavite, and it explains their psychomental, psychospiritual, and psychophysical effects on the overall biosystem of the practitioner. The theoretical and philosophical aspects acquaint the students with the spiritual and transcendental background of meditation, which are simultaneously supplemented by their practical participation in meditation sessions under the close supervision of an expert instructor. The series is a tribute to the “Mind, Memory, and Meditation” tradition of the ancient Nalanda University.\n\nThe current course begins with a general introduction to the concept of Meditation as it developed over many millennia from the pre-Vedic period to present times. It would further expose the students to preliminary observances and abstinence necessary for the full realization of physical, mental, and spiritual benefits. They would include conveyance to students of initial requirements like cleanliness, God-consciousness, continence, sense-control, etc. as prescribed in different spiritual scriptures and systems for achieving complete success in the practice of meditation in diverse modes and at different successive stages.\n\nReading List:\n\nMeditation-Eknath Eswaran\n\nHow to Meditate—John J.

It engages with a range of theoretical and methodological issues in archaeology and their relevance in attempting a gendered analysis of Buddhism. Although the academic study of Buddhism and gender has become established fields of inquiry, there have been relatively few attempts to examine the role of women in Buddhism through an analysis of archaeological data. Gender as a category of analysis underscores the importance of contextual evidence (structural, Epigraphic, sculptural, numismatic, etc.) for interpreting gender roles in archaeological investigations of the past Buddhist sites. The course examines how women are perceived and how they respond, adapt, and contribute to Buddhism in various Buddhist traditions.\n\nReading List:\n\nUma Chakrabarty, Beyond the Altekarian Paradigm, Towards a new understanding of Gender Relations in Early Indian History, Social Scientist, vol. 16, No. 8, 1988.\n\nB.

Each system would be first discussed in detail focusing on their origin, major and minor constituents, growth over the period, mechanics of practice, and impact on the subsequent systems of Yoga. The discussion of each subject would include references to and illustrations from both the primary and secondary texts currently available in translations. Having discussed them in detail from all possible angles (within the constraints of time), a collective comparative study of the three systems would be taken up in such respects as origin, history, philosophy, practice techniques, aims, and objectives, etc. Finally, a chart of comparison will be drawn for clarity and easy comprehension of each system vis a vis the three others.\n\nReading List:\n\nSankhya Sutras-Tr. & Comment. by Ganganath Jha\n\nSankhya Karika-Isvra Krsna\n\nSamkhya: A Prologue to Sankhya Yoga-Dipti Dutta\n\nMahanirvan Tantra-Tr.

It is now widely accepted that Tantric Buddhism has directly emerged from the Śaiva tantras. The course gives the overview of the history of the tantric movement, its concepts, practices, most important masters and most influential texts.\n\nReading List:\n\nAlper, Harvey P., ed.

An attempt is made to further appraise the students with the mechanisms whereby the philosophical, psychological, and physical effects of all these means or yantras help the practitioner arouse, conserve, and carry the prana energy to higher spiritual realms for the desired expansion of consciousness in correspondence with the transcendental realities.

Yoga became a watchword and the yogic exercises a household phenomenon in the entire west. As a result, several eminent writers of the western world employed Yoga in their poetic, fictional, and other literary creations over the last two centuries to ridicule and re-examine the material outlook of the entire western society. Specialized analysis of their imaginative treatment of Yoga may open up newer possibilities of its understanding from a non-native viewpoint and a wider universal perspective, which possibly have remained thus far unknown and unrealized. The course includes a close examination of poetry, fiction, prose, and plays of about half a dozen canonical western writers of the 19’th and 20’th centuries.\n\nReading List:\n\nPrimary Texts:\n\nWalden—Henry David\n\nThoreau Leaves of Grass—Walt Whitman\n\nBrahma: R.W.
