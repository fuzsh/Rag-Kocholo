        "text": "Public Statement by concerned faculty members of colleges and universities in West Bengal\n\nSchools, colleges, universities and other educational institutions in West Bengal were closed from 15th March 2020, more than a week before the nationwide lockdown.\n\nColleges have been closed for more than 60 days already, with no clear indication emerging about the resumption of vehicles, or the slowing down of the spread of COVID 19. Till the date of closure, undergraduate students across universities had had roughly two months of classroom teaching in this semester, and postgraduate (PG) students even less. Some universities had just concluded their previous semester’s examinations, and started the even semester’s teaching for PG and research programmes.\n\nVarious newspaper articles and television channels have quoted Dr.Partha Chatterjee, the Hon’ble Minister-in-charge of the Department of Higher Education, WB, as saying that exams in colleges and universities will be held one month after the lock-down ends. This declaration has not only created significant confusion among students and teachers alike, but it has also raised a series of concerns about the quality and accessibility of education imparted in the last two months, as well as the feasibiliy of conducting exams/classes in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nAccording to the All India Survey of Higher Education (AISHE) report 2018-2019, West Bengal has more than 1370 institutions of higher education. with close to 20 lakh students. Over the past nine years, many colleges and Universities have been set up by the state government in rural and remote areas, while a huge number of students enrolled in higher education in urban centres hail from distant villages. With the lock-down, they have had to go back home, with no access to the help that institutional and public libraries offer. ‘Key Indicators of Household Social Consumption on Education In India NSS 75TH Round (JULY 2017- JUNE 2018)’ states that only 14.9% of rural and 42% of urban households in India have internet facility, and our interactions with students attest to the fact that often the same internet connection (usually a smartphone) is shared by several members of the household. During the pandemic, teachers have been trying to continue students’ academic engagements via Whatsapp voice notes, conference call over mobile networks, PDF files, and in rare instances, video conferencing. A vast majority of students cannot be a part of synchronous teaching over con-calls and video conferences, due to network connectivity and bandwidth limitations, data limitations and other exigencies. Most colleges do not have dedicated portals for students and teachers to use, making them depend on their personal resources to partake of the teaching learning process. PDFs are difficult to read on the phone, causing immense strain to the eyes, and students have reported that due to data restrictions even those with good connectivity cannot access video lectures such as those available on the National Digital Library. Such piecemeal attempts to ‘finish’ the syllabus has left little or no scope for discussion, and laboratory-based subjects have become impossible to be taught. Additionally, there are reports of students having to perform long hours of housework, look after ailing family members, deal with personal traumas and financial anxieties caused by the pandemic\n\nAlongside this, most colleges and universities in West Bengal suffer from a lack of space. Students and teachers travel in crowded local trains or public buses, often across great distances; students stay in shared Paying Guest accommodations or hostel rooms and sit in crowded, often ill-ventilated classrooms. Sometimes three colleges share the same building across one day, making regular sanitisation almost impossible.\n\nAt this juncture, according to newspaper reports, some universities have taken the right decision to evaluate students on the basis of internal assessments/assignments, and to avoid face to face interaction till there is clarity about the pandemic and the ways in which we must alter our lives and institutions around it. However, most universities, including the ones with many affiliated colleges, as well as in provincial locations, have not yet notified their means of evaluation. In the present scenario, asking students to come to college once the lock-down ends and sit for a pen ~ and paper examination, within existing possibilities of contamination would be deeply unfair and life-endangering. The digital divide makes online examinations impossible beyond a doubt. News reports claim that one in 10 of all Indians who go out to work have either already lost, or are likely to lose their jobs in the course of the pandemic. We are yet to assess the impact of economic downsizing on the lives of students from marginal communities, who have got a chance to access higher education in West Bengal because of several beneficial state schemes.\n\nWe therefore urge the remainder of the universities, and the Department of Higher Education, WB, to either evaluate students on the basis of the average of their previous results, or on the basis of assignments, or a combination of the two, keeping them safe and not penalising them for not having access to the internet. Universities need to decide upon the modality after extensive consultation with all the stakeholders, and provide clarity in the matter at the earliest.\n\nPostscript: This statement was prepared and endorsed before supercyclone Amphan hit Bengal. All the concerns raised above have become even more serious in the aftermath of the cyclone, with houses, roads, schools demolished, people seeking shelter in camps and no electricity or internet connection. This extraordinary human and ecological calamity has to be taken into account before reaching any decision.\n\nEndorsed by\n\nSamata Biswas, The Sanskrit College and University\n\nSumanta Mukhopadhyay, Bethune College\n\nDebaditya Bhattacharya, Kazi Nazrul University\n\nPriyanka Das, Presidency University\n\nSuman Nath, Dr. A.
