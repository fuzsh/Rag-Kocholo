        "text": "Philosophy and Religion / Surendranath Dasgupta: A History of Indian Philosophy\n\nSurendranath Dasgupta\n\nA History of Indian Philosophy, Vol. 1\n\nChapter V: Buddhist Philosophy\n\nMany scholars are of opinion that the SÃ¢á¹khya and the Yoga represent the earliest systematic speculations of India. It is also suggested that Buddhism drew much of its inspiration from them. It may be that there is some truth in such a view, but the systematic SÃ¢á¹khya and Yoga treatises as we have them had decidedly been written after Buddhism. Moreover it is well-known to every student of Hindu philosophy that a conflict with the Buddhists has largely stimulated philosophic enquiry in most of the systems of Hindu thought. A knowledge of Buddhism is therefore indispensable for a right understanding of the different systems in their mutual relation and opposition to Buddhism. It seems desirable therefore that I should begin with Buddhism first.\n\n1. The State of Philosophy in India before the Buddha.\n\nIt is indeed difficult to give a short sketch of the different philosophical speculations that were prevalent in India before Buddhism. The doctrines of the Upaniá¹£ads are well known, and these have already been briefly described. But these were not the only ones. Even in the Upaniá¹£ads we find references to diverse atheistical creeds1. We find there that the origin of the world and its processes were sometimes discussed, and some thought that \"time\" was the ultimate cause of all, others that all these had sprung forth by their own nature (svabhÃ¢va), others that everything had come forth in accordance with an inexorable destiny or a fortuitous concourse of accidental happenings, or through matter combinations in general. References to diverse kinds of heresies are found in Buddhist literature also, but no detailed accounts of these views are known. Of the Upaniá¹£ad type of materialists the two schools of CÃ¢rvÃ¢kas (DhÃ»rtta and SuÅiká¹£ita) are referred to in later literature, though the time in which these flourished cannot rightly be discovered2. But it seems probable however that the allusion to the materialists contained in the Upaniá¹£ads refers to these or to similar schools. The CÃ¢rvÃ¢kas did not believe in the authority of the Vedas or any other holy scripture. According to them there was no soul. Life and consciousness were the products of the combination of matter, just as red colour was the result of mixing up white with yellow or as the power of intoxication was generated in molasses (madaÅakti). There is no after-life, and no reward of actions, as there is neither virtue nor vice. Life is only for enjoyment. So long as it lasts it is needless to think of anything else, as everything will end with death, for when at death the body is burnt to ashes there cannot be any rebirth. They do not believe in the validity of inference. Nothing is trustworthy but what can be directly perceived, for it is impossible to determine that the distribution of the middle term (hetu) has not depended upon some extraneous condition, the absence of which might destroy the validity of any particular piece of inference. If in any case any inference comes to be true, it is only an accidental fact and there is no certitude about it. They were called CÃ¢rvÃ¢ka because they would only eat but would not accept any other religious or moral responsibility. The word comes from carv to eat. The DhÃ»rtta CÃ¢rvÃ¢kas held that there was nothing but the four elements of earth, water, air and fire, and that the body was but the result of atomic combination. There was no self or soul, no virtue or vice. The SuÅiká¹£ita CÃ¢rvÃ¢kas held that there was a soul apart from the body but that it also was destroyed with the destruction of the body. The original work of the CÃ¢rvÃ¢kas was written in sÃ»tras probably by B á¹haspati. Jayanta and Guá¹aratna quote two sÃ»tras from it. Short accounts of this school may be found in Jayanta's NyÃ¢yamaÃ±jarÃ®, MÃ¢dhava's SarvadarÅanasaá¹graha and Guá¹aratna's TarkarahasyadÃ®pikÃ¢. MahÃ¢bhÃ¢rata gives an account of a man called CÃ¢rvÃ¢ka meeting Yudhiá¹£á¹­hira.\n\nSide by side with the doctrine of the CÃ¢rvÃ¢ka materialists we are reminded of the ÃjÃ®vakas of which Makkhali GosÃ¢la, probably a renegade disciple of the Jain saint MahÃ¢vÃ®ra and a contemporary of Buddha and MahÃ¢vÃ®ra, was the leader. This was a thorough-going determinism denying the free will of man and his moral responsibility for any so-called good or evil. The essence of Makkhali's system is this, that \"there is no cause, either proximate or remote, for the depravity of beings or for their purity. They become so without any cause. Nothing depends either on one's own efforts or on the efforts of others, in short nothing depends on any human effort, for there is no such thing as power or energy, or human exertion. The varying conditions at any time are due to fate, to their environment and their own nature3.\"\n\nAnother sophistical school led by Ajita Kesakambali taught that there was no fruit or result of good or evil deeds; there is no other world, nor was this one real; nor had parents nor any former lives any efficacy with respect to this life. Nothing that we can do prevents any of us alike from being wholly brought to an end at death4.\n\nThere were thus at least three currents of thought: firstly the sacrificial Karma by the force of the magical rites of which any person could attain anything he desired; secondly the Upaniá¹£ad teaching that the Brahman, the self, is the ultimate reality and being, and all else but name and form which pass away but do not abide. That which permanently abides without change is the real and true, and this is self. Thirdly the nihilistic conceptions that there is no law, no abiding reality, that everything comes into being by a fortuitous concourse of circumstances or by some unknown fate. In each of these schools, philosophy had probably come to a deadlock. There were the Yoga practices prevalent in the country and these were accepted partly on the strength of traditional custom among certain sections, and partly by virtue of the great spiritual, intellectual and physical power which they gave to those who performed them. But these had no rational basis behind them on which they could lean for support. These were probably then just tending towards being affiliated to the nebulous SÃ¢á¹khya doctrines which had grown up among certain sections. It was at this juncture that we find Buddha erecting a new superstructure of thought on altogether original lines which thenceforth opened up a new avenue of philosophy for all posterity to come. If the Being of the Upaniá¹£ads, the superlatively motionless, was the only real, how could it offer scope for further new speculations, as it had already discarded all other matters of interest? If everything was due to a reasonless fortuitous concourse of circumstances, reason could not proceed further in the direction to create any philosophy of the unreason. The magical force of the hocus-pocus of sorcery or sacrifice had but little that was inviting for philosophy to proceed on. If we thus take into account the state of Indian philosophic culture before Buddha, we shall be better able to understand the value of the Buddhistic contribution to philosophy.\n\n2. Buddha: his Life.\n\nGautama the Buddha was born in or about the year 560 B.C. in the Lumbini Grove near the ancient town of Kapilavastu in the now dense terai region of Nepal. His father was Suddhodana, a prince of the SÃ¢kya clan, and his mother Queen MahÃ¢mÃ¢yÃ¢. According to the legends it was foretold of him that he would enter upon the ascetic life when he should see \"A decrepit old man, a diseased man, a dead man, and a monk.\" His father tried his best to keep him away from these by marrying him and surrounding him with luxuries. But on successive occasions, issuing from the palace, he was confronted by those four things, which filled him with amazement and distress, and realizing the impermanence of all earthly things determined to forsake his home and try if he could to discover some means to immortality to remove the sufferings of men. He made his \"Great Renunciation\" when he was twenty-nine years old. He travelled on foot to RÃ¢jagá¹ha (Rajgir) and thence to UruvelÃ¢, where in company with other five ascetics he entered upon a course of extreme self-discipline, carrying his austerities to such a length that his body became utterly emaciated and he fell down senseless and was believed to be dead. After six years of this great struggle he was convinced that the truth was not to be won by the way of extreme asceticism, and resuming an ordinary course of life at last attained absolute and supreme enlightenment. Thereafter the Buddha spent a life prolonged over forty-five years in travelling from place to place and preaching the doctrine to all who would listen. At the age of over eighty years Buddha realized that the time drew near for him to die. He then entered into Dhyana and passing through its successive stages attained nirvÃ¢na5. The vast developments which the system of this great teacher underwent in the succeeding centuries in India and in other countries have not been thoroughly studied, and it will probably take yet many years more before even the materials for such a study can be collected. But from what we now possess it is proved incontestably that it is one of the most wonderful and subtle productions of human wisdom. It is impossible to overestimate the debt that the philosophy, culture and civilization of India owe to it in all her developments for many succeeding centuries.\n\n3. Early Buddhist Literature.\n\nThe Buddhist PÃ¢li Scriptures contain three different collections: the Sutta (relating to the doctrines), the Vinaya (relating to the discipline of the monks) and the Abhidhamma (relating generally to the same subjects as the suttas but dealing with them in a scholastic and technical manner). Scholars of Buddhistic religious history of modern times have failed as yet to fix any definite dates for the collection or composition of the different parts of the aforesaid canonical literature of the Buddhists. The suttas were however composed before the Abhidhamma and it is very probable that almost the whole of the canonical works were completed before 241 B.C., the date of the third council during the reign of King Asoka. The suttas mainly deal with the doctrine (Dhamma) of the Buddhistic faith whereas the Vinaya deals only with the regulations concerning the discipline of the monks. The subject of the Abhidhamma is mostly the same as that of the suttas, namely, the interpretation of the Dhamma. Buddhaghoá¹£a in his introduction to AtthasÃ¢linÃ®, the commentary on the Dhammasaá¹gaá¹i, says that the Abhidhamma is so called (abhi and dhamma) because it describes the same Dhammas as are related in the suttas in a more intensified (dhammÃ¢tireka) and specialized (dhammavisesatthena) manner. The Abhidhammas do not give any new doctrines that are not in the suttas, but they deal somewhat elaborately with those that are already found in the suttas. Buddhaghoá¹£a in distinguishing the special features of the suttas from the Abhidhammas says that the acquirement of the former leads one to attain meditation (samÃ¢dhi) whereas the latter leads one to attain wisdom (paÃ±Ã±Ã¢sampadam). The force of this statement probably lies in this, that the dialogues of the suttas leave a chastening effect on the mind, the like of which is not to be found in the Abhidhammas, which busy themselves in enumerating the Buddhistic doctrines and defining them in a technical manner, which is more fitted to produce a reasoned insight into the doctrines than directly to generate a craving for following the path of meditation for the extinction of sorrow. The Abhidhamma known as the KathÃ¢vatthu differs from the other Abhidhammas in this, that it attempts to reduce the views of the heterodox schools to absurdity. The discussions proceed in the form of questions and answers, and the answers of the opponents are often shown to be based on contradictory assumptions.\n\nThe suttas contain five groups of collections called the NikÃ¢yas. These are (1) DÃ®gha NikÃ¢ya, called so on account of the length of the suttas contained in it; (2) Majjhima NikÃ¢ya (middling NikÃ¢ya), called so on account of the middling extent of the suttas contained in it; (3) Saá¹yutta NikÃ¢ya (NikÃ¢yas relating to special meetings), called saá¹yutta on account of their being delivered owing to the meetings (saá¹yoga) of special persons which were the occasions for them; (4) Aá¹guttara NikÃ¢ya, so called because in each succeeding book of this work the topics of discussion increase by one6; (5) Khuddaka NikÃ¢ya containing Khuddaka pÃ¢á¹­ha, Dhammapada, UdÃ¢na, Itivuttaka, Sutta NipÃ¢ta, VimÃ¢na-vatthu, Petavatthu, TheragathÃ¢, TherÃ®gathÃ¢, JÃ¢taka, Niddesa, Paá¹­isambhidÃ¢magga, ApadÃ¢na, Buddhavaá¹sa, CaryÃ¢piá¹­aka.\n\nThe Abhidhammas are Paá¹­á¹­hÃ¢na, Dhammasaá¹gaá¹i, DhÃ¢tukathÃ¢, PuggalapaÃ±Ã±atti, Vibhaá¹ga, Yamaka and KathÃ¢vatthu. There exists also a large commentary literature on diverse parts of the above works known as atthakathÃ¢. The work known as Milinda PaÃ±ha (questions of King Milinda), of uncertain date, is of considerable philosophical value.\n\nThe doctrines and views incorporated in the above literature is generally now known as SthaviravÃ¢da or TheravÃ¢da. On the origin of the name TheravÃ¢da (the doctrine of the elders) DÃ®pavaá¹sa says that since the Theras (elders) met (at the first council) and collected the doctrines it was known as the Thera VÃ¢da7. It does not appear that Buddhism as it appears in this PÃ¢li literature developed much since the time of Buddhaghoá¹£a (4OO A.D.), the writer of Visuddhimagga (a compendium of theravÃ¢da doctrines) and the commentator of DÃ®ghanikÃ¢ya, Dhammasaá¹gaá¹i, etc.\n\nHindu philosophy in later times seems to have been influenced by the later offshoots of the different schools of Buddhism, but it does not appear that PÃ¢li Buddhism had any share in it. I have not been able to discover any old Hindu writer who could be considered as being acquainted with PÃ¢li.\n\n4. The Doctrine of Causal Connection of early Buddhism.8\n\nThe word Dhamma in the Buddhist scriptures is used generally in four senses: (1) Scriptural texts, (2) quality (guá¹a), (3) cause (hetu) and (4) unsubstantial and soulless (nissatta nijjÃ®va9). Of these it is the last meaning which is particularly important, from the point of view of Buddhist philosophy. The early Buddhist philosophy did not accept any fixed entity as determining all reality; the only things with it were the unsubstantial phenomena and these were called dhammas. The question arises that if there is no substance or reality how are we to account for the phenomena? But the phenomena are happening and passing away and the main point of interest with the Buddha was to find out \"What being what else is,\" \"What happening what else happens\" and \"What not being what else is not.\" The phenomena are happening in a series and we see that there being certain phenomena there become some others; by the happening of some events others also are produced. This is called (paá¹­icca-samuppÃ¢da) dependent origination. But it is difficult to understand what is the exact nature of this dependence. The question as Saá¹yutta NikÃ¢ya (II. 5) has it with which the Buddha started before attaining Buddhahood was this: in what miserable condition are the people! they are born, they decay, they die, pass away and are born again; and they do not know the path of escape from this decay, death and misery.\n\nHow to know the Way to escape from this misery of decay and death. Then it occurred to him what being there, are decay and death, depending on what do they come? As he thought deeply into the root of the matter, it occurred to him that decay and death can only occur when there is birth (jÃ¢ti), so they depend on birth. What being there, is there birth, on what does birth depend? Then it occurred to him that birth could only be if there were previous existence (bhava)10. But on what does this existence depend, or what being there is there bhava. Then it occurred to him that there could not be existence unless there were holding fast (upÃ¢dÃ¢na)11. But on what did upÃ¢dÃ¢na depend? It occurred to him that it was desire (taá¹hÃ¢) on which upÃ¢dÃ¢na depended. There can be upÃ¢dÃ¢na if there is desire (tanhÃ¢)12. But what being there, can there be desire? To this question it occurred to him that there must be feeling (vedanÃ¢) in order that there may be desire. But on what does vedanÃ¢ depend, or rather what must be there, that there may be feeling (vedanÃ¢)? To this it occurred to him that there must be a sense-contact (phassa) in order that there may be feeling13. If there should be no sense-contact there would be no feeling. But on what does sense-contact depend? It occurred to him that as there are six sense-contacts, there are the six fields of contact (Ã¢yatana)14. But on what do the six Ã¢yatanas depend? It occurred to him that there must be the mind and body (nÃ¢marÃ»pa) in order that there may be the six fields of contact; but on what does nÃ¢marÃ»pa depend? It occurred to him that without consciousness (viÃ±Ã±Ã¢na) there could be no nÃ¢marÃ»pa15. But what being there would there be viÃ±Ã±Ã¢na. Here it occurred to him that in order that there might be viÃ±Ã±Ã¢na there must be the conformations (saá¹khÃ¢ra)16. But what being there are there the saá¹khÃ¢ras? Here it occurred to him that the saá¹khÃ¢ras can only be if there is ignorance (avijjÃ¢). If avijjÃ¢ could be stopped then the saá¹khÃ¢ras will be stopped, and if the saá¹khÃ¢ras could be stopped viÃ±Ã±Ã¢na could be stopped and so on17.\n\nIt is indeed difficult to be definite as to what the Buddha actually wished to mean by this cycle of dependence of existence sometimes called Bhavacakra (wheel of existence). Decay and death (jarÃ¢marana) could not have happened if there was no birth18. This seems to be clear. But at this point the difficulty begins. We must remember that the theory of rebirth was enunciated in the Upaniá¹£ads. The B á¹hadÃ¢raá¹yaka says that just as an insect going to the end of a leaf of grass by a new effort collects itself in another so does the soul coming to the end of this life collect itself in another. This life thus presupposes another existence. So far as I remember there has seldom been before or after Buddha any serious attempt to prove or disprove the doctrine of rebirth19. All schools of philosophy except the CÃ¢rvÃ¢kas believed in it and so little is known to us of the CÃ¢rvÃ¢ka sÃ»tras that it is difficult to say what they did to refute this doctrine. The Buddha also accepts it as a fact and does not criticize it. This life therefore comes only as one which had an infinite number of lives before, and which except in the case of a few emancipated ones would have an infinite number of them in the future. It was strongly believed by all people, and the Buddha also, when he came to think to what our present birth might be due, had to fall back upon another existence (bhava). If bhava means karma which brings rebirth as CandrakÃ®rtti takes it to mean, then it would mean that the present birth could only take place on account of the works of a previous existence which determined it. Here also we are reminded of the Upaniá¹£ad note \"as a man does so will he be born\" (Yat karma kurute tadabhisampadyate, Brh IV. iv. 5). CandrakÃ®rtti's interpretation of \"bhava\" as Karma (punarbhavajanakam karma) seems to me to suit better than \"existence.\" The word was probably used rather loosely for kammabhava. The word bhava is not found in the earlier Upaniá¹£ads and was used in the PÃ¢li scriptures for the first time as a philosophical term. But on what does this bhava depend? There could not have been a previous existence if people had not betaken themselves to things or works they desired. This betaking oneself to actions or things in accordance with desire is called upÃ¢dÃ¢na. In the Upaniá¹£ads we read, \"whatever one betakes himself to, so does he work\" (Yatkraturbhavati tatkarmma kurute, B á¹h. IV. iv. 5). As this betaking to the thing depends upon desire (tá¹á¹£á¹Ã¢), it is said that in order that there may be upÃ¢dÃ¢na there must be tanhÃ¢. In the Upaniá¹£ads also we read \"Whatever one desires so does he betake himself to\" (sa yathÃ¢kÃ¢mo bhavati tatkraturbhavati). Neither the word upÃ¢dÃ¢na nor t á¹sá¹Ã¢ (the Sanskrit word corresponding to taá¹hÃ¢) is found in the earlier Upaniá¹£ads, but the ideas contained in them are similar to the words \"kratu\" and \"kÃ¢ma.\" Desire (taá¹hÃ¢) is then said to depend on feeling or sense-contact. Sense-contact presupposes the six senses as fields of operation20. These six senses or operating fields would again presuppose the whole psychosis of the man (the body and the mind together) called nÃ¢marÃ»pa. We are familiar with this word in the Upaniá¹£ads but there it is used in the sense of determinate forms and names as distinguished from the indeterminate indefinable reality21. Buddhaghoá¹£a in the Visuddhimagga says that by \"Name\" are meant the three groups beginning with sensation (i.e. sensation, perception and the predisposition); by \"Form\" the four elements and form derivative from the four elements22. He further says that name by itself can produce physical changes, such as eating, drinking, making movements or the like. So form also cannot produce any of those changes by itself. But like the cripple and the blind they mutually help one another and effectuate the changes23. But there exists no heap or collection of material for the production of Name and Form; \"but just as when a lute is played upon, there is no previous store of sound; and when the sound comes into existence it does not come from any such store; and when it ceases, it does not go to any of the cardinal or intermediate points of the compass;...in exactly the same way all the elements of being both those with form and those without, come into existence after having previously been non-existent and having come into existence pass away24.\" NÃ¢marÃ»pa taken in this sense will not mean the whole of mind and body, but only the sense functions and the body which are found to operate in the six doors of sense (saá¸·Ã¢yatana). If we take nÃ¢marÃ»pa in this sense, we can see that it may be said to depend upon the viÃ±Ã±Ã¢na (consciousness). Consciousness has been compared in the Milinda PaÃ±ha with a watchman at the middle of the cross-roads beholding all that come from any direction25. Buddhaghoá¹£a in the AtthasÃ¢linÃ® also says that consciousness means that which thinks its object. If we are to define its characteristics we must say that it knows (vijÃ¢nana), goes in advance (pubbaá¹gama), connects (sandhÃ¢na), and stands on nÃ¢marÃ»pa (nÃ¢marÃ»papadaá¹­á¹­hÃ¢nam). When the consciousness gets a door, at a place the objects of sense are discerned (Ã¢rammana-vibhÃ¢vanaá¹­á¹­hÃ¢ne) and it goes first as the precursor. When a visual object is seen by the eye it is known only by the consciousness, and when the dhammas are made the objects of (mind) mano, it is known only by the consciousness26. Buddhaghoá¹£a also refers here to the passage in the Milinda PaÃ±ha we have just referred to. He further goes on to say that when states of consciousness rise one after another, they leave no gap between the previous state and the later and consciousness therefore appears as connected. When there are the aggregates of the five khandhas it is lost; but there are the four aggregates as nÃ¢marÃ»pa, it stands on nÃ¢ma and therefore it is said that it stands on nÃ¢marÃ»pa. He further asks, Is this consciousness the same as the previous consciousness or different from it? He answers that it is the same. Just so, the sun shows itself with all its colours, etc., but he is not different from those in truth; and it is said that just when the sun rises, its collected heat and yellow colour also rise then, but it does not mean that the sun is different from these. So the citta or consciousness takes the phenomena of contact, etc., and cognizes them. So though it is the same as they are yet in a sense it is different from them27.\n\nTo go back to the chain of twelve causes, we find that jÃ¢ti (birth) is the cause of decay and death, jarÃ¢maraá¹a, etc. JÃ¢ti is the appearance of the body or the totality of the five skandhas28. Coming to bhava which determines jÃ¢ti, I cannot think of any better rational explanation of bhava, than that I have already suggested, namely, the works (karma) which produce the birth29. UpÃ¢dÃ¢na is an advanced t á¹á¹£á¹Ã¢ leading to positive clinging30. It is produced by t á¹á¹£á¹Ã¢ (desire) which again is the result of vedanÃ¢ (pleasure and pain). But this vedanÃ¢ is of course vedanÃ¢ with ignorance (avidyÃ¢), for an Arhat may have also vedanÃ¢ but as he has no avidyÃ¢, the vedanÃ¢ cannot produce t á¹á¹£á¹Ã¢ in turn. On its development it immediately passes into upÃ¢dÃ¢na. VedanÃ¢ means pleasurable, painful or indifferent feeling. On the one side it leads to t á¹á¹£á¹Ã¢ (desire) and on the other it is produced by sense-contact (sparÅa). Prof. De la VallÃ©e Poussin says that ÅrÃ®lÃ¢bha distinguishes three processes in the production of vedanÃ¢. Thus first there is the contact between the sense and the object; then there is the knowledge of the object, and then there is the vedanÃ¢. Depending on Majjhima NikÃ¢ya, iii. 242, Poussin gives the other opinion that just as in the case of two sticks heat takes place simultaneously with rubbing, so here also vedanÃ¢ takes place simultaneously with sparÅa for they are \"produits par un mÃªme complexe de causes (sÃ¢magrÃ®)31.\"\n\nSparÅa is produced by á¹£aá¸Ã¢yatana, á¹£aá¸Ã¢yatana by nÃ¢marÃ»pa, and nÃ¢marÃ»pa by vijÃ±Ã¢na, and is said to descend in the womb of the mother and produce the five skandhas as nÃ¢marÃ»pa, out of which the six senses are specialized.\n\nVijÃ±Ã¢na in this connection probably means the principle or germ of consciousness in the womb of the mother upholding the five elements of the new body there. It is the product of the past karmas (saá¹khÃ¢ra) of the dying man and of his past consciousness too.\n\nWe sometimes find that the Buddhists believed that the last thoughts of the dying man determined the nature of his next birth32. The manner in which the vijÃ±Ã¢na produced in the womb is determined by the past vijÃ±Ã¢na of the previous existence is according to some authorities of the nature of a reflected image, like the transmission of learning from the teacher to the disciple, like the lighting of a lamp from another lamp or like the impress of a stamp on wax. As all the skandhas are changing in life, so death also is but a similar change; there is no great break, but the same uniform sort of destruction and coming into being. New skandhas are produced as simultaneously as the two scale pans of a balance rise up and fall, in the same manner as a lamp is lighted or an image is reflected. At the death of the man the vijÃ±Ã¢na resulting from his previous karmas and vijÃ±Ã¢nas enters into the womb of that mother (animal, man or the gods) in which the next skandhas are to be matured. This vijÃ±Ã¢na thus forms the principle of the new life. It is in this vijÃ±Ã¢na that name (nÃ¢ma) and form (rÃ»pa) become associated.\n\nThe vijÃ±Ã¢na is indeed a direct product of the saá¹skÃ¢ras and the sort of birth in which vijÃ±Ã¢na should bring down (nÃ¢mayati) the new existence (upapatti) is determined by the saá¹skÃ¢ras33, for in reality the happening of death (maraá¹abhava) and the instillation of the vijÃ±Ã¢na as the beginning of the new life (upapattibhava) cannot be simultaneous, but the latter succeeds just at the next moment, and it is to signify this close succession that they are said to be simultaneous. If the vijÃ±Ã¢na had not entered the womb then no nÃ¢marÃ»pa could have appeared34.\n\nThis chain of twelve causes extends over three lives. Thus avidyÃ¢ and saá¹skÃ¢ra of the past life produce the vijÃ±Ã¢na, nÃ¢marupa, á¹£aá¸Ã¢yatana, sparÅa, vedanÃ¢, t á¹á¹£á¹Ã¢, upÃ¢dÃ¢na and the bhava (leading to another life) of the present actual life. This bhava produces the jÃ¢ti and jarÃ¢maraá¹a of the next life35.\n\nIt is interesting to note that these twelve links in the chain extending in three sections over three lives are all but the manifestations of sorrow to the bringing in of which they naturally determine one another. Thus Abhidhammatthasaá¹gaha says \"each of these twelve terms is a factor. For the composite term 'sorrow,' etc. is only meant to show incidental consequences of birth. Again when 'ignorance' and 'the actions of the mind' have been taken into account, craving (tá¹á¹£á¹Ã¢), grasping (upÃ¢dÃ¢na) and (karma) becoming (bhava) are implicitly accounted for also. In the same manner when craving, grasping and (karma[/I) becoming have been taken into account, ignorance and the actions of the mind are (implicitly) accounted for, also; and when birth, decay, and death are taken into account, even the fivefold fruit, to wit (rebirth), consciousness, and the rest are accounted for. And thus:\n\nFive causes in the Past and Now a fivefold 'fruit.'\n\nFive causes Now and yet to come a fivefold 'fruit' make up the Twenty Modes, the Three Connections (1. saá¹khÃ¢ra and viÃ±Ã±Ã¢na, 2. vedanÃ¢ and tanhÃ¢, 3. bhava and jÃ¢ti) and the four groups (one causal group in the Past, one resultant group in the Present, one causal group in the Present and one resultant group in the Future, each group consisting of five modes)36.\"\n\nThese twelve interdependent links (dvÃ¢daÅÃ¢á¹ga) represent the paá¹­iccasamuppÃ¢da (pratÃ¢tyasamutpÃ¢da) doctrines (dependent origination)37 which are themselves but sorrow and lead to cycles of sorrow. The term paá¹­iccasamuppÃ¢da or pratÃ®tyasamutpÃ¢da has been differently interpreted in later Buddhist literature38.\n\nSamutpÃ¢da means appearance or arising (prÃ¢durbhdÃ¢va) and pratÃ®tya means after getting (prati+i+ya); combining the two we find, arising after getting (something). The elements, depending on which there is some kind of arising, are called hetu (cause) and paccaya (ground). These two words however are often used in the same sense and are interchangeable. But paccaya is also used in a specific sense. Thus when it is said that avijjÃ¢ is the paccaya of saá¹khÃ¢ra it is meant that avijjÃ¢ is the ground (á¹­hiti) of the origin of the saá¹khÃ¢ras, is the ground of their movement, of the instrument through which they stand (nimittaá¹­á¹­hiti), of their ayuhana (conglomeration), of their interconnection, of their intelligibility, of their conjoint arising, of their function as cause and of their function as the ground with reference to those which are determined by them. AvijjÃ¢ in all these nine ways is the ground of saá¹khÃ¢ra both in the past and also in the future, though avijjÃ¢ itself is determined in its turn by other grounds39. When we take the betu aspect of the causal chain, we cannot think of anything else but succession, but when we take the paccaya aspect we can have a better vision into the nature of the cause as ground. Thus when avijjÃ¢ is said to be the ground of the saá¹khÃ¢ras in the nine ways mentioned above, it seems reasonable to think that the saá¹khÃ¢ras were in some sense regarded as special manifestations of avijjÃ¢40. But as this point was not further developed in the early Buddhist texts it would be unwise to proceed further with it.\n\n5. The Khandhas.\n\nThe word khandha (Skr. skandha) means the trunk of a tree and is generally used to mean group or aggregate41. We have seen that Buddha said that there was no Ã¢tman (soul). He said that when people held that they found the much spoken of soul, they really only found the five khandhas together or any one of them. The khandhas are aggregates of bodily and psychical states which are immediate with us and are divided into five classes: (1) rÃ»pa (four elements, the body, the senses), sense data, etc., (2) vedanÃ¢ (feeling--pleasurable, painful and indifferent), (3) saÃ±Ã±Ã¢ (conceptual knowledge), (4) saá¹khÃ¢ra (synthetic mental states and the synthetic functioning of compound sense-affections, compound feelings and compound concepts), (5) viÃ±Ã±Ã¢na (consciousness)42.\n\nAll these states rise depending one upon the other (paá¹­iccasamuppanna) and when a man says that he perceives the self he only deludes himself, for he only perceives one or more of these. The word rÃ»pa in rÃ»pakhandha stands for matter and material qualities, the senses, and the sense data43. But \"rÃ»pa\" is also used in the sense of pure organic affections or states of mind as we find in the Khandha Yamaka, I.p. 16, and also in Saá¹yutta NikÃ¢ya, III. 86. RÃ»paskandha according to Dharmasaá¹graha means the aggregate of five senses, the five sensations, and the implicatory communications associated in sense perceptions vijÃ±apti).\n\nThe elaborate discussion of Dhammasaá¹gaá¹i begins by defining rÃ»pa as \"cattÃ¢ro ca mahÃ¢bhÃ»tÃ¢ catunnaÃ±ca mahÃ¢bhntanam upÃ¢dÃ¢ya rÃ»pam\" (the four mahÃ¢bhÃ»tas or elements and that proceeding from the grasping of that is called rÃ»pa)44. Buddhaghoá¹£a explains it by saying that rÃ»pa means the four mahÃ¢bhÃ»tas and those which arise depending (nissÃ¢ya) on them as a modification of them. In the rÃ»pa the six senses including their affections are also included. In explaining why the four elements are called mahÃ¢bhÃ»tas, Buddhaghoá¹£a says: \"Just as a magician (mÃ¢yÃ¢kÃ¢ra) makes the water which is not hard appear as hard, makes the stone which is not gold appear as gold; just as he himself though not a ghost nor a bird makes himself appear as a ghost or a bird, so these elements though not themselves blue make themselves appear as blue (nÃ®lam upÃ¢dÃ¢ rÃ»pam), not yellow, red, or white make themselves appear as yellow, red or white (odÃ¢tam upÃ¢dÃ¢rÃ»pam), so on account of their similarity to the appearances created by the magician they are called mahÃ¢bhÃ»ta45.\"\n\nIn the Saá¹yutta NikÃ¢ya we find that the Buddha says, \"O Bhikkhus it is called rÃ»pam because it manifests (rÃ»pyati); how does it manifest? It manifests as cold, and as heat, as hunger and as thirst, it manifests as the touch of gnats, mosquitos, wind, the sun and the snake; it manifests, therefore it is called rÃ»pa46.\"\n\nIf we take the somewhat conflicting passages referred to above for our consideration and try to combine them so as to understand what is meant by rÃ»pa, I think we find that that which manifested itself to the senses and organs was called rÃ»pa. No distinction seems to have been made between the sense-data as colours, smells, etc., as existing in the physical world and their appearance as sensations. They were only numerically different and the appearance of the sensations was dependent upon the sense-data and the senses but the sense-data and the sensations were \"rÃ»pa.\" Under certain conditions the sense-data were followed by the sensations. Buddhism did not probably start with the same kind of division of matter and mind as we now do. And it may not be out of place to mention that such an opposition and duality were found neither in the Upaniá¹£ads nor in the SÃ¢á¹khya system which is regarded by some as pre-Buddhistic. The four elements manifested themselves in certain forms and were therefore called rÃ»pa; the forms of affection that appeared were also called rÃ»pa; many other mental states or features which appeared with them were also called rÃ»pa47. The Ã¢yatanas or the senses were also called rÃ»pa48. The mahÃ¢bhÃ»tas or four elements were themselves but changing manifestations, and they together with all that appeared in association with them were called rÃ»pa and formed the rÃ»pa khandha (the classes of sense-materials, sense-data, senses and sensations).\n\nIn Saá¹yutta NikÃ¢ya (III. 101) it is said that \"the four mahÃ¢bhÃ»tas were the hetu and the paccaya for the communication of the rÃ»pakkhandha (rÃ»pakkhandhassa paÃ±Ã±Ã¢panÃ¢ya). Contact (sense-contact, phassa) is the cause of the communication of feelings (vedanÃ¢); sense-contact was also the hetu and paccaya for the communication of the saÃ±Ã±Ã¢kkhandha; sense-contact is also the hetu and paccaya for the communication of the saá¹khÃ¢rakkhandha. But nÃ¢marÃ»pa is the hetu and the paccaya for the communication of the viÃ±Ã±Ã¢nakkhandha.\" Thus not only feelings arise on account of the sense-contact but saÃ±Ã±Ã¢ and saá¹khÃ¢ra also arise therefrom. SaÃ±Ã±Ã¢ is that where specific knowing or conceiving takes place. This is the stage where the specific distinctive knowledge as the yellow or the red takes place.\n\nMrs. Rhys Davids writing on saÃ±Ã±Ã¢ says: \"In editing the second book of the Abhidhamma piá¹­aka I found a classification distinguishing between saÃ±Ã±Ã¢ as cognitive assimilation on occasion of sense, and saÃ±Ã±Ã¢ as cognitive assimilation of ideas by way of naming. The former is called perception of resistance, or opposition (patigha-saÃ±Ã±Ã¢). This, writes Buddhaghoá¹£a, is perception on occasion of sight, hearing, etc., when consciousness is aware of the impact of impressions; of external things as different, we might say. The latter is called perception of the equivalent word or name (adhivachÃ¢nÃ¢-saÃ±Ã±Ã¢) and is exercised by the sensus communis (mano), when e.g. 'one is seated...and asks another who is thoughtful: \"What are you thinking of?\" one perceives through his speech.' Thus there are two stages of saÃ±Ã±Ã¢-consciousness, 1. contemplating sense-impressions, 2. ability to know what they are by naming49.\"\n\nAbout saá¹khÃ¢ra we read in Saá¹yutta NikÃ¢ya (III. 87) that it is called saá¹khÃ¢ra because it synthesises (abhisaá¹kharonti), it is that which conglomerated rÃ»pa as rÃ»pa, conglomerated saÃ±Ã±Ã¢ as saÃ±Ã±Ã¢, saá¹khÃ¢ra as saá¹khÃ¢ra and consciousness (viÃ±Ã±Ã¢na) as consciousness. It is called saá¹khÃ¢ra because it synthesises the conglomerated (saá¹khatam abhisaá¹kharonti). It is thus a synthetic function which synthesises the passive rÃ»pa, saÃ±Ã±Ã¢, saá¹khÃ¢ra and viÃ±Ã±Ã¢na elements. The fact that we hear of 52 saá¹khÃ¢ra states and also that the saá¹khÃ¢ra exercises its synthetic activity on the conglomerated elements in it, goes to show that probably the word saá¹khÃ¢ra is used in two senses, as mental states and as synthetic activity.\n\nViÃ±Ã±Ã¢na or consciousness meant according to Buddhaghoá¹£a, as we have already seen in the previous section, both the stage at which the intellectual process started and also the final resulting consciousness.\n\nBuddhaghoá¹£a in explaining the process of Buddhist psychology says that \"consciousness(citta)first comes into touch (phassa) with its object (Ã¢rammaá¹a) and thereafter feeling, conception (saÃ±Ã±Ã¢) and volition (cetanÃ¢) come in. This contact is like the pillars of a palace, and the rest are but the superstructure built upon it (dabbasambhÃ¢rasadisÃ¢). But it should not be thought that contact is the beginning of the psychological processes, for in one whole consciousness (ekacittasmiá¹) it cannot be said that this comes first and that comes after, so we can take contact in association with feeling (vedanÃ¢), conceiving (saÃ±Ã±Ã¢) or volition (cetanÃ¢); it is itself an immaterial state but yet since it comprehends objects it is called contact.\" \"There is no impinging on one side of the object (as in physical contact), nevertheless contact causes consciousness and object to be in collision, as visible object and visual organs, sound and hearing; thus impact is its function; or it has impact as its essential property in the sense of attainment, owing to the impact of the physical basis with the mental object. For it is said in the Commentary:--\"contact in the four planes of existence is never without the characteristic of touch with the object; but the function of impact takes place in the five doors. For to sense, or five-door contact, is given the name 'having the characteristic of touch' as well as 'having the function of impact.' But to contact in the mind-door there is only the characteristic of touch, but not the function of impact. And then this Sutta is quoted 'As if, sire, two rams were to fight, one ram to represent the eye, the second the visible object, and their collision contact. And as if, sire, two cymbals were to strike against each other, or two hands were to clap against each other; one hand would represent the eye, the second the visible object and their collision contact. Thus contact has the characteristic of touch and the function of impact50'. Contact is the manifestation of the union of the three (the object, the consciousness and the sense) and its effect is feeling (vedanÃ¢); though it is generated by the objects it is felt in the consciousness and its chief feature is experiencing (anubhava) the taste of the object. As regards enjoying the taste of an object, the remaining associated states enjoy it only partially. Of contact there is (the function of) the mere touching, of perception the mere noting or perceiving, of volition the mere coordinating, of consciousness the mere cognizing. But feeling alone, through governance, proficiency, mastery, enjoys the taste of an object. For feeling is like the king, the remaining states are like the cook. As the cook, when he has prepared food of diverse tastes, puts it in a basket, seals it, takes it to the king, breaks the seal, opens the basket, takes the best of all the soup and curries, puts them in a dish, swallows (a portion) to find out whether they are faulty or not and afterwards offers the food of various excellent tastes to the king, and the king, being lord, expert, and master, eats whatever he likes, even so the mere tasting of the food by the cook is like the partial enjoyment of the object by the remaining states, and as the cook tastes a portion of the food, so the remaining states enjoy a portion of the object, and as the king, being lord, expert and master, eats the meal according to his pleasure so feeling being lord expert, and master, enjoys the taste of the object and therefore it is said that enjoyment or experience is its function51.\"\n\nThe special feature of saÃ±Ã±Ã¢ is said to be the recognizing (paccabhiÃ±Ã±Ã¢) by means of a sign (abhiÃ±Ã±Ã¢nena). According to another explanation, a recognition takes place by the inclusion of the totality (of aspects)--sabbasaá¹gahikavasena. The work of volition (cetanÃ¢) is said to be coordination or binding together (abhisandahana). \"Volition is exceedingly energetic and makes a double effort, a double exertion. Hence the Ancients said 'Volition is like the nature of a landowner, a cultivator who taking fifty-five strong men, went down to the fields to reap. He was exceedingly energetic and exceedingly strenuous; he doubled his strength and said \"Take your sickles\" and so forth, pointed out the portion to be reaped, offered them drink, food, scent, flowers, etc., and took an equal share of the work.' The simile should be thus applied: volition is like the cultivator, the fifty-five moral states which arise as factors of consciousness are like the fifty-five strong men; like the time of doubling strength, doubling effort by the cultivator is the doubled strength, doubled effort of volition as regards activity in moral and immoral acts52.\" It seems that probably the active side operating in saá¹khÃ¢ra was separately designated as cetanÃ¢ (volition).\n\n\"When one says 'I,' what he does is that he refers either to all the khandhas combined or any one of them and deludes himself that that was 'I.' Just as one could not say that the fragrance of the lotus belonged to the petals, the colour or the pollen, so one could not say that the rÃ»pa was 'I' or that the vedanÃ¢ was 'I' or any of the other khandhas was 'I.' There is nowhere to be found in the khandhas 'I am53'.\"\n\n6. AvijjÃ¢ and Ãsava.\n\nAs to the question how the avijjÃ¢ (ignorance) first started there can be no answer, for we could never say that either ignorance or desire for existence ever has any beginning54. Its fruition is seen in the cycle of existence and the sorrow that comes in its train, and it comes and goes with them all. Thus as we can never say that it has any beginning, it determines the elements which bring about cycles of existence and is itself determined by certain others. This mutual determination can only take place in and through the changing series of dependent phenomena, for there is nothing which can be said to have any absolute priority in time or stability. It is said that it is through the coming into being of the Ã¢savas or depravities that the avijjÃ¢ came into being, and that through the destruction of the depravities (Ã¢sava) the avijjÃ¢ was destroyed55. These Ã¢savas are classified in the Dhammasaá¹gaá¹i as kÃ¢mÃ¢sava, bhavÃ¢sava, diá¹­á¹­hÃ¢sava and avijjÃ¢sava. KÃ¢mÃ¢sava means desire, attachment, pleasure, and thirst after the qualities associated with the senses; bhavÃ¢sava means desire, attachment and will for existence or birth; diá¹­á¹­hÃ¢sava means the holding of heretical views, such as, the world is eternal or non-eternal, or that the world will come to an end or will not come to an end, or that the body and the soul are one or are different; avijjÃ¢sava means the ignorance of sorrow, its cause, its extinction and its means of extinction. Dhammasaá¹gaá¹i adds four more supplementary ones, viz. ignorance about the nature of anterior mental khandhas, posterior mental khandhas, anterior and posterior together, and their mutual dependence56. KÃ¢mÃ¢sava and bhavÃ¢sava can as Buddhaghoá¹£a says be counted as one, for they are both but depravities due to attachment57.\n\nThe diá¹­á¹­hÃ¢savas by clouding the mind with false metaphysical views stand in the way of one's adopting the true Buddhistic doctrines. The kÃ¢masÃ¢vas stand in the way of one's entering into the way of NirvÃ¢á¹a (anÃ¢gÃ¢mimagga) and the bhavÃ¢savas and avijjÃ¢savas stand in the way of one's attaining arha or final emancipation. When the Majjhima NikÃ¢ya says that from the rise of the Ã¢savas avijjÃ¢ rises, it evidently counts avijjÃ¢ there as in some sense separate from the other Ã¢savas, such as those of attachment and desire of existence which veil the true knowledge about sorrow.\n\nThe afflictions (kilesas) do not differ much from the Ã¢savas for they are but the specific passions in forms ordinarily familiar to us, such as covetousness (lobha), anger or hatred (dosa), infatuation (moha), arrogance, pride or vanity (mÃ¢na), heresy (diá¹­á¹­hi), doubt or uncertainty (vicikicchÃ¢), idleness (thÃ®na), boastfulness (udhacca), shamelessness (ahirika) and hardness of heart anottapa); these kilesas proceed directly as a result of the Ã¢savas. In spite of these varieties they are often counted as three (lobha, dosa, moha) and these together are called kilesa. They are associated with the vedanÃ¢kkhandha, saÃ±Ã±Ã¢kkhandha, saá¹khÃ¢rakkhandha and viÃ±Ã±Ã¢nakkhandha. From these arise the three kinds of actions, of speech, of body, and of mind58.\n\n7. SÃ®la and SamÃ¢dhi.\n\nWe are intertwined all through outside and inside by the tangles of desire (taá¹hÃ¢ jaá¹­Ã¢), and the only way by which these may be loosened is by the practice of right discipline (sÃ®la), concentration (samÃ¢dhi) and wisdom (paÃ±Ã±Ã¢). SÃ®la briefly means the desisting from committing all sinful deeds (sabbapÃ¢passa akaraá¹am). With sÃ®la therefore the first start has to be made, for by it one ceases to do all actions prompted by bad desires and thereby removes the inrush of dangers and disturbances. This serves to remove the kilesas, and therefore the proper performance of the sÃ®la would lead one to the first two successive stages of sainthood, viz. the sotÃ¢pannabhÃ¢va (the stage in which one is put in the right current) and the sakadÃ¢gÃ¢mibhÃ¢va (the stage when one has only one more birth to undergo). SamÃ¢dhi is a more advanced effort, for by it all the old roots of the old kilesas are destroyed and the taá¹hÃ¢ or desire is removed and by it one is led to the more advanced states of a saint. It directly brings in paÃ±Ã±Ã¢ (true wisdom) and by paÃ±Ã±Ã¢ the saint achieves final emancipation and becomes what is called an arhat59. Wisdom (paÃ±Ã±Ã¢) is right knowledge about the four Ã¢riya saccas, viz. sorrow, its cause, its destruction and its cause of destruction.\n\nSÃ®la means those particular volitions and mental states, etc. by which a man who desists from committing sinful actions maintains himself on the right path. SÃ®la thus means 1. right volition (cetanÃ¢), 2. the associated mental states (cetasika), 3. mental control (saá¹vara) and 4. the actual non-transgression (in body and speech) of the course of conduct already in the mind by the preceding three sÃ®las called avÃ®tikkama. Saá¹vara is spoken of as being of five kinds, 1. PÃ¢á¹­imokkhasaá¹vara (the control which saves him who abides by it), 2. Satisaá¹vara (the control of mindfulness), 3. ÃÃ¢nasaá¹vara (the control of knowledge), 4. Khantisaá¹vara (the control of patience), 5. Viriyasaá¹vara (the control of active self-restraint). PÃ¢á¹­imokkhasaá¹vara means all self-control in general. Satisaá¹vara means the mindfulness by which one can bring in the right and good associations when using one's cognitive senses. Even when looking at any tempting object he will by virtue of his mindfulness (sati) control himself from being tempted by avoiding to think of its tempting side and by thinking on such aspects of it as may lead in the right direction. Khantisaá¹vara is that by which one can remain unperturbed in heat and cold. By the proper adherence to sÃ®la all our bodily, mental and vocal activities (kamma) are duly systematized, organized, stabilized (samÃ¢dhÃ¢nam, upadhÃ¢raá¹aá¹, patiá¹­á¹­hÃ¢)60.\n\nThe sage who adopts the full course should also follow a number of healthy monastic rules with reference to dress, sitting, dining, etc., which are called the dhÃ»taá¹gas or pure disciplinary parts61. The practice of sÃ®la and the dhÃ»tangas help the sage to adopt the course of samÃ¢dhi. SamÃ¢dhi as we have seen means the concentration of the mind bent on right endeavours (kusalacittekaggatÃ¢ samÃ¢dhiá¸¥) together with its states upon one particular object (ekÃ¢rammaá¹a) so that they may completely cease to shift and change (sammÃ¢ ca avikkhipamÃ¢nÃ¢)62.\n\nThe man who has practised sÃ®la must train his mind first in particular ways, so that it may be possible for him to acquire the chief concentration of meditation called jhÃ¢na (fixed and steady meditation). These preliminary endeavours of the mind for the acquirement of jhÃ¢nasamÃ¢dhi eventually lead to it and are called upacÃ¢ra samÃ¢dhi (preliminary samÃ¢dhi) as distinguished from the jhÃ¢nasamÃ¢dhi called the appanÃ¢samÃ¢dhi (achieved samÃ¢dhi)63. Thus as a preparatory measure, firstly he has to train his mind continually to view with disgust the appetitive desires for eating and drinking (Ã¢hÃ¢re paá¹­ikkÃ»lasaÃ±Ã±Ã¢) by emphasizing in the mind the various troubles that are associated in seeking food and drink and their ultimate loathsome transformations as various nauseating bodily elements. When a man continually habituates himself to emphasize the disgusting associations of food and drink, he ceases to have any attachment to them and simply takes them as an unavoidable evil, only awaiting the day when the final dissolution of all sorrows will come64. Secondly he has to habituate his mind to the idea that all the parts of our body are made up of the four elements, ká¹£iti (earth), ap (water), tejas (fire) and wind (air), like the carcase of a cow at the butcher's shop. This is technically called catudhÃ¢tuvavatthÃ¢nabhÃ¢vanÃ¢ (the meditation of the body as being made up of the four elements)65. Thirdly he has to habituate his mind to think again and again (anussati) about the virtues or greatness of the Buddha, the saá¹gha (the monks following the Buddha), the gods and the law (dhamma) of the Buddha, about the good effects of sÃ®la, and the making of gifts (cÃ¢gÃ¢nussati), about the nature of death (maraá¹Ã¢nussati) and about the deep nature and qualities of the final extinction of all phenomena (upasamÃ¢nussati)66.\n\nAdvancing further from the preliminary meditations or preparations called the upacÃ¢ra samÃ¢dhi we come to those other sources of concentration and meditation called the appanÃ¢samÃ¢dhi which directly lead to the achievement of the highest samÃ¢dhi. The processes of purification and strengthening of the mind continue in this stage also, but these represent the last attempts which lead the mind to its final goal NibbÃ¢na. In the first part of this stage the sage has to go to the cremation grounds and notice the diverse horrifying changes of the human carcases and think how nauseating, loathsome, unsightly and impure they are, and from this he will turn his mind to the living human bodies and convince himself that they being in essence the same as the dead carcases are as loathsome as they67 This is called asubhakammaá¹­á¹­hÃ¢na or the endeavour to perceive the impurity of our bodies. He should think of the anatomical parts and constituents of the body as well as their processes, and this will help him to enter into the first jhÃ¢na by leading his mind away from his body. This is called the kayagatasati or the continual mindfulness about the nature of the body68. As an aid to concentration the sage should sit in a quiet place and fix his mind on the inhaling (passÃ¢sa) and the exhaling (Ã¢ssÃ¢sa) of his breath, so that instead of breathing in a more or less unconscious manner he may be aware whether he is breathing quickly or slowly; he ought to mark it definitely by counting numbers, so that by fixing his mind on the numbers counted he may fix his mind on the whole process of inhalation and exhalation in all stages of its course. This is called the anapÃ¢nasati or the mindfulness of inhalation and exhalation69.\n\nNext to this we come to BrahmavihÃ¢ra, the fourfold meditation of metta (universal friendship), karuá¹Ã¢ (universal pity), muditÃ¢ (happiness in the prosperity and happiness of all) and upekkhÃ¢ (indifference to any kind of preferment of oneself, his friend, enemy or a third party). In order to habituate oneself to the meditation on universal friendship, one should start with thinking how he should himself like to root out all misery and become happy, how he should himself like to avoid death and live cheerfully, and then pass over to the idea that other beings would also have the same desires. He should thus habituate himself to think that his friends, his enemies, and all those with whom he is not connected might all live and become happy. He should fix himself to such an extent in this meditation that he would not find any difference between the happiness or safety of himself and of others. He should never become angry with any person. Should he at any time feel himself offended on account of the injuries inflicted on him by his enemies, he should think of the futility of doubling his sadness by becoming sorry or vexed on that account. He should think that if he should allow himself to be affected by anger, he would spoil all his sÃ®la which he was so carefully practising. If anyone has done a vile action by inflicting injury, should he himself also do the same by being angry at it? If he were finding fault with others for being angry, could he himself indulge in anger? Moreover he should think that all the dhammas are momentary (khaá¹ikattÃ¢); that there no longer existed the khandhas which had inflicted the injury, and moreover the infliction of any injury being only a joint product, the man who was injured was himself an indispensable element in the production of the infliction as much as the man who inflicted the injury, and there could not thus be any special reason for making him responsible and of being angry with him. If even after thinking in this way the anger does not subside, he should think that by indulging in anger he could only bring mischief on himself through his bad deeds, and he should further think that the other man by being angry was only producing mischief to himself but not to him. By thinking in these ways the sage would be able to free his mind from anger against his enemies and establish himself in an attitude of universal friendship70. This is called the mettÃ¢-bhÃ¢vana. In the meditation of universal pity (karuá¹Ã¢) also one should sympathize with the sorrows of his friends and foes alike. The sage being more keen-sighted will feel pity for those who are apparently leading a happy life, but are neither acquiring merits nor endeavouring to proceed on the way to NibbÃ¢na, for they are to suffer innumerable lives of sorrow71.\n\nWe next come to the jhÃ¢nas with the help of material things as objects of concentration called the Kasiá¹am. These objects of concentration may either be earth, water, fire, wind, blue colour, yellow colour, red colour, white colour, light or limited space (parÃ®cchinnÃ¢kÃ¢sa). Thus the sage may take a brown ball of earth and concentrate his mind upon it as an earth ball, sometimes with eyes open and sometimes with eyes shut. When he finds that even in shutting his eyes he can visualize the object in his mind, he may leave off the object and retire to another place to concentrate upon the image of the earth ball in his mind.\n\nIn the first stages of the first meditation (pathamam jhÃ¢nam) the mind is concentrated on the object in the way of understanding it with its form and name and of comprehending it with its diverse relations. This state of concentration is called vitakka (discursive meditation). The next stage of the first meditation is that in which the mind does not move in the object in relational terms but becomes fixed and settled in it and penetrates into it without any quivering. This state is called vicÃ¢ra (steadily moving). The first stage vitakka has been compared in Buddhaghoá¹£a's Visuddhimagga to the flying of a kite with its wings flapping, whereas the second stage is compared to its flying in a sweep without the least quiver of its wings. These two stages are associated with a buoyant exaltation (pÃ®ti) and a steady inward bliss called sukha72 instilling the mind. The formation of this first jhÃ¢na roots out five ties of avijjÃ¢, kamacchando (dallying with desires), vyÃ¢pÃ¢do (hatred), thinamiddham (sloth and torpor), uddhaccakukkuccam (pride and restlessness), and vicikicchÃ¢ (doubt). The five elements of which this jhÃ¢na is constituted are vitakka, vicÃ¢ra, plti, sukham and ekaggata (one pointedness).\n\nWhen the sage masters the first jhÃ¢na he finds it defective and wants to enter into the second meditation (dutiyam jhÃ¢nam), where there is neither any vitakka nor vicÃ¢ra of the first jhÃ¢na, but the mind is in one unruffled state (ekodibhÃ¢vam). It is a much steadier state and does not possess the movement which characterized the vitakka and the vicÃ¢ra stages of the first jhÃ¢na and is therefore a very placid state (vitakka-vicÃ¢rakkhobha-viraheá¹a ativiya acalatÃ¢ suppasannatÃ¢ ca). It is however associated with pÃ®ti, sukha and ekaggatÃ¢ as the first jhÃ¢na was.\n\nWhen the second jhÃ¢na is mastered the sage becomes disinclined towards the enjoyment of the pÃ®ti of that stage and becomes indifferent to them (upekkhako). A sage in this stage sees the objects but is neither pleased nor displeased. At this stage all the Ã¢savas of the sage become loosened (khÃ®á¹Ã¢sava). The enjoyment of sukha however still remains in the stage and the mind if not properly and carefully watched would like sometimes to turn back to the enjoyment of pÃ®ti again. The two characteristics of this jhÃ¢na are sukha and ekaggatÃ¢. It should however be noted that though there is the feeling of highest sukha here, the mind is not only not attached to it but is indifferent to it (atimadhhurasukhe sukhapÃ¢ramippatte pi tatiyajjhÃ¢ne upekkhako, na tattha sukhÃ¢bhisangena Ã¢kaá¸á¸hiyati)73. The earth ball (paá¹­havÃ®) is however still the object of the jhÃ¢na.\n\nIn the fourth or the last jhÃ¢na both the sukha (happiness) and the dukkha (misery) vanish away and all the roots of attachment and antipathies are destroyed. This state is characterized by supreme and absolute indifference (upekkhÃ¢) which was slowly growing in all the various stages of the jhÃ¢nas. The characteristics of this jhÃ¢na are therefore upekkhÃ¢ and ekaggatÃ¢. With the mastery of this jhÃ¢na comes final perfection and total extinction of the citta called cetovimutti, and the sage becomes thereby an arhat74. There is no further production of the khandhas, no rebirth, and there is the absolute cessation of all sorrows and sufferings--NibbÃ¢na.\n\n8. Kamma.\n\nIn the Katha (II. 6) Yama says that \"a fool who is blinded with the infatuation of riches does not believe in a future life; he thinks that only this life exists and not any other, and thus he comes again and again within my grasp.\" In the Digha NikÃ¢ya also we read how PÃ¢yÃ¢si was trying to give his reasons in support of his belief that \"Neither is there any other world, nor are there beings, reborn otherwise than from parents, nor is there fruit or result of deeds well done or ill done75.\" Some of his arguments were that neither the vicious nor the virtuous return to tell us that they suffered or enjoyed happiness in the other world, that if the virtuous had a better life in store, and if they believed in it, they would certainly commit suicide in order to get it at the earliest opportunity, that in spite of taking the best precautions we do not find at the time of the death of any person that his soul goes out, or that his body weighs less on account of the departure of his soul, and so on. Kassapa refutes his arguments with apt illustrations. But in spite of a few agnostics of PÃ¢yÃ¢si's type, we have every reason to believe that the doctrine of rebirth in other worlds and in this was often spoken of in the Upaniá¹£ads and taken as an accepted fact by the Buddha. In the Milinda PaÃ±ha, we find NÃ¢gasena saying \"it is through a difference in their karma that men are not all alike, but some long lived, some short lived, some healthy and some sickly, some handsome and some ugly, some powerful and some weak, some rich and some poor, some of high degree and some of low degree, some wise and some foolish76.\" We have seen in the third chapter that the same soil of views was enunciated by the Upaniá¹£ad sages.\n\nBut karma could produce its effect in this life or any other life only when there were covetousness, antipathy and infatuation. But \"when a man's deeds are performed without covetousness, arise without covetousness and are occasioned without covetousness, then inasmuch as covetousness is gone these deeds are abandoned, uprooted, pulled out of the ground like a palmyra tree and become non-existent and not liable to spring up again in the future77.\" Karma by itself without craving (taá¹hÃ¢) is incapable of bearing good or bad fruits. Thus we read in the MahÃ¢satipaá¹­á¹­hÃ¢na sutta, \"even this craving, potent for rebirth, that is accompanied by lust and self-indulgence, seeking satisfaction now here, now there, to wit, the craving for the life of sense, the craving for becoming (renewed life) and the craving for not becoming (for no new rebirth)78.\" \"Craving for things visible, craving for things audible, craving for things that may be smelt, tasted, touched, for things in memory recalled. These are the things in this world that are dear, that are pleasant. There does craving take its rise, there does it dwell79.\" Pre-occupation and deliberation of sensual gratification giving rise to craving is the reason why sorrow comes. And this is the first Ã¢rya satya (noble truth).\n\nThe cessation of sorrow can only happen with \"the utter cessation of and disenchantment about that very craving, giving it up, renouncing it and emancipation from it80.\"\n\nWhen the desire or craving (taá¹hÃ¢) has once ceased the sage becomes an arhat, and the deeds that he may do after that will bear no fruit. An arhat cannot have any good or bad fruits of whatever he does. For it is through desire that karma finds its scope of giving fruit. With the cessation of desire all ignorance, antipathy and grasping cease and consequently there is nothing which can determine rebirth. An arhat may suffer the effects of the deeds done by him in some previous birth just as MoggallÃ¢na did, but in spite of the remnants of his past karma an arhat was an emancipated man on account of the cessation of his desire81.\n\nKammas are said to be of three kinds, of body, speech and mind (kÃ¢yika, vÃ¢cika and mÃ¢nasika). The root of this kamma is however volition (cetanÃ¢) and the states associated with it82. If a man wishing to kill animals goes out into the forest in search of them, but cannot get any of them there even after a long search, his misconduct is not a bodily one, for he could not actually commit the deed with his body. So if he gives an order for committing a similar misdeed, and if it is not actually carried out with the body, it would be a misdeed by speech (vÃ¢cika) and not by the body. But the merest bad thought or ill will alone whether carried into effect or not would be a kamma of the mind (mÃ¢nasika)83. But the mental kamma must be present as the root of all bodily and vocal kammas, for if this is absent, as in the case of an arhat, there cannot be any kammas at all for him.\n\nKammas are divided from the point of view of effects into four classes, viz. (1) those which are bad and produce impurity, (2) those which are good and productive of purity, (3) those which are partly good and partly bad and thus productive of both purity and impurity, (4) those which are neither good nor bad and productive neither of purity nor of impurity, but which contribute to the destruction of kammas84.\n\nFinal extinction of sorrow (nibbÃ¢na) takes place as the natural result of the destruction of desires. Scholars of Buddhism have tried to discover the meaning of this ultimate happening, and various interpretations have been offered. Professor De la VallÃ©e Poussin has pointed out that in the PÃ¢li texts NibbÃ¢na has sometimes been represented as a happy state, as pure annihilation, as an inconceivable existence or as a changeless state85.\n\nMr Schrader, in discussing NibbÃ¢na in Pali Text Society Journal, 1905, says that the Buddha held that those who sought to become identified after death with the soul of the world as infinite space (Ã¢kÃ¢sa) or consciousness (viÃ±Ã±Ã¢na) attained to a state in which they had a corresponding feeling of infiniteness without having really lost their individuality. This latter interpretation of NibbÃ¢na seems to me to be very new and quite against the spirit of the Buddhistic texts. It seems to me to be a hopeless task to explain NibbÃ¢na in terms of worldly experience, and there is no way in which we can better indicate it than by saying that it is a cessation of all sorrow; the stage at which all worldly experiences have ceased can hardly be described either as positive or negative. Whether we exist in some form eternally or do not exist is not a proper Buddhistic question, for it is a heresy to think of a TathÃ¢gata as existing eternally (ÅÃ¢Åvata) or not-existing (aÅÃ¢Åvata) or whether he is existing as well as not existing or whether he is neither existing nor non-existing. Any one who seeks to discuss whether NibbÃ¢na is either a positive and eternal state or a mere state of non-existence or annihilation, takes a view which has been discarded in Buddhism as heretical. It is true that we in modern times are not satisfied with it, for we want to know what it all means. But it is not possible to give any answer since Buddhism regarded all these questions as illegitimate.\n\nLater Buddhistic writers like NÃ¢gÃ¢rjuna and CandrakÃ®rtti took advantage of this attitude of early Buddhism and interpreted it as meaning the non-essential character of all existence. Nothing existed, and therefore any question regarding the existence or non-existence of anything would be meaningless. There is no difference between the worldly stage (saá¹sÃ¢ra) and NibbÃ¢na, for as all appearances are non-essential, they never existed during the saá¹sÃ¢ra so that they could not be annihilated in NibbÃ¢na.\n\n9. Upaniá¹£ads and Buddhism.\n\nThe Upaniá¹£ads had discovered that the true self was Ã¢nanda (bliss)86. We could suppose that early Buddhism tacitly presupposes some such idea. It was probably thought that if there was the self (attÃ¢) it must be bliss. The Upaniá¹£ads had asserted that the self(Ã¢tman) was indestructible and eternal87. If we are allowed to make explicit what was implicit in early Buddhism we could conceive it as holding that if there was the self it must be bliss, because it was eternal. This causal connection has not indeed been anywhere definitely pronounced in the Upaniá¹£ads, but he who carefully reads the Upaniá¹£ads cannot but think that the reason why the Upaniá¹£ads speak of the self as bliss is that it is eternal. But the converse statement that what was not eternal was sorrow does not appear to be emphasized clearly in the Upaniá¹£ads. The important postulate of the Buddha is that that which is changing is sorrow, and whatever is sorrow is not self88. The point at which Buddhism parted from the Upaniá¹£ads lies in the experiences of the self. The Upaniá¹£ads doubtless considered that there were many experiences which we often identify with self, but which are impermanent. But the belief is found in the Upaniá¹£ads that there was associated with these a permanent part as well, and that it was this permanent essence which was the true and unchangeable self, the blissful. They considered that this permanent self as pure bliss could not be defined as this, but could only be indicated as not this, not this (neti neti)89. But the early Pali scriptures hold that we could nowhere find out such a permanent essence, any constant self, in our changing experiences. All were but changing phenomena and therefore sorrow and therefore non-self, and what was non-self was not mine, neither I belonged to it, nor did it belong to me as my self90.\n\nThe true self was with the Upaniá¹£ads a matter of transcendental experience as it were, for they said that it could not be described in terms of anything, but could only be pointed out as \"there,\" behind all the changing mental categories. The Buddha looked into the mind and saw that it did not exist. But how was it that the existence of this self was so widely spoken of as demonstrated in experience? To this the reply of the Buddha was that what people perceived there when they said that they perceived the self was but the mental experiences either individually or together. The ignorant ordinary man did not know the noble truths and was not trained in the way of wise men, and considered himself to be endowed with form (rÃ»pa) or found the forms in his self or the self in the forms. He experienced the thought (of the moment) as it were the self or experienced himself as being endowed with thought, or the thought in the self or the self in the thought. It is these kinds of experiences that he considered as the perception of the self91.\n\nThe Upaniá¹£ads did not try to establish any school of discipline or systematic thought. They revealed throughout the dawn of an experience of an immutable Reality as the self of man, as the only abiding truth behind all changes. But Buddhism holds that this immutable self of man is a delusion and a false knowledge. The first postulate of the system is that impermanence is sorrow. Ignorance about sorrow, ignorance about the way it originates, ignorance about the nature of the extinction of sorrow, and ignorance about the means of bringing about this extinction represent the fourfold ignorance (avijjÃ¢)92. The avidyÃ¢, which is equivalent to the PÃ¢li word avijjÃ¢, occurs in the Upaniá¹£ads also, but there it means ignorance about the Ã¢tman doctrine, and it is sometimes contrasted with vidyÃ¢ or true knowledge about the self (Ã¢tman)93. With the Upaniá¹£ads the highest truth was the permanent self, the bliss, but with the Buddha there was nothing permanent; and all was change; and all change and impermanence was sorrow94. This is, then, the cardinal truth of Buddhism, and ignorance concerning it in the above fourfold ways represented the fourfold ignorance which stood in the way of the right comprehension of the fourfold cardinal truths (Ã¢riya sacca)--sorrow, cause of the origination of sorrow, extinction of sorrow, and the means thereto.\n\nThere is no Brahman or supreme permanent reality and no self, and this ignorance does not belong to any ego or self as we may ordinarily be led to suppose.\n\nThus it is said in the Visuddhimagga \"inasmuch however as ignorance is empty of stability from being subject to a coming into existence and a disappearing from existence...and is empty of a self-determining Ego from being subject to dependence,--...or in other words inasmuch as ignorance is not an Ego, and similarly with reference to Karma and the rest--therefore is it to be understood of the wheel of existence that it is empty with a twelvefold emptiness95.\"\n\n10. The Schools of TheravÃ¢da Buddhism.\n\nThere is reason to believe that the oral instructions of the Buddha were not collected until a few centuries after his death. Serious quarrels arose amongst his disciples or rather amongst the successive generations of the disciples of his disciples about his doctrines and other monastic rules which he had enjoined upon his followers. Thus we find that when the council of VesÃ¢li decided against the V á¹jin monks, called also the Vajjiputtakas, they in their turn held another great meeting (MahÃ¢saá¹gha) and came to their own decisions about certain monastic rules and thus came to be called as the MahÃ¢saá¹ghikas96. According to Vasumitra as translated by Vassilief, the MahÃ¢saá¹ghikas seceded in 400 B.C. and during the next one hundred years they gave rise first to the three schools EkavyavahÃ¢rikas, LokottaravÃ¢dins, and Kukkulikas and after that the BahuÅrutÃ®yas. In the course of the next one hundred years, other schools rose out of it namely the PrajÃ±aptivÃ¢dins, Caittikas, AparaÅailas and UttaraÅailas. The TheravÃ¢da or the SthaviravÃ¢da school which had convened the council of VesÃ¢li developed during the second and first century B.C. into a number of schools, viz. the Haimavatas, Dharmaguptikas, MahÃ®ÅÃ¢sakas, KÃ¢ÅyapÃ®yas, Saá¹krÃ¢ntikas (more well known as SautrÃ¢ntikas) and the VÃ¢tsiputtrÃ®yas which latter was again split up into the DharmottarÃ®yas, BhadrayÃ¢nÃ®yas, SammitÃ®yas and ChannÃ¢garikas. The main branch of the TheravÃ¢da school was from the second century downwards known as the HetuvÃ¢dins or SarvÃ¢stivÃ¢dins97. The MahÃ¢bodhivaá¹sa identifies the TheravÃ¢da school with the VibhajjavÃ¢dins. The commentator of the KathÃ¢vatthu who probably lived according to Mrs Rhys Davids sometime in the fifth century A.D. mentions a few other schools of Buddhists. But of all these Buddhist schools we know very little. Vasumitra (100 A.D.) gives us some very meagre accounts of certain schools, of the MahÃ¢saá¹ghikas, LokottaravÃ¢dins, EkavyavahÃ¢rikas, Kakkulikas, PrajÃ±aptivÃ¢dins and SarvÃ¢stivÃ¢dins, but these accounts deal more with subsidiary matters of little philosophical importance. Some of the points of interest are (1) that the MahÃ¢saá¹ghikas were said to believe that the body was filled with mind (citta) which was represented as sitting, (2) that the PrajÃ±aptivÃ¢dins held that there was no agent in man, that there was no untimely death, for it was caused by the previous deeds of man, (3) that the SarvÃ¢stivÃ¢dins believed that everything existed. From the discussions found in the KathÃ¢vatthu also we may know the views of some of the schools on some points which are not always devoid of philosophical interest. But there is nothing to be found by which we can properly know the philosophy of these schools. It is quite possible however that these so-called schools of Buddhism were not so many different systems but only differed from one another on some points of dogma or practice which were considered as being of sufficient interest to them, but which to us now appear to be quite trifling. But as we do not know any of their literatures, it is better not to make any unwarrantable surmises. These schools are however not very important for a history of later Indian Philosophy, for none of them are even referred to in any of the systems of Hindu thought. The only schools of Buddhism with which other schools of philosophical thought came in direct contact, are the SarvÃ¢stivÃ¢dins including the SautrÃ¢ntikas and the VaibhÃ¢á¹£ikas, the YogÃ¢cÃ¢ra or the VijÃ±Ã¢navÃ¢dins and the MÃ¢dhyamikas or the ÅÃ»nyavÃ¢dins. We do not know which of the diverse smaller schools were taken up into these four great schools, the SautrÃ¢ntika, VaibhÃ¢á¹£ika, YogÃ¢cÃ¢ra and the MÃ¢dhyamika schools. But as these schools were most important in relation to the development of the different systems in Hindu thought, it is best that we should set ourselves to gather what we can about these systems of Buddhistic thought.\n\nWhen the Hindu writers refer to the Buddhist doctrine in general terms such as \"the Buddhists say\" without calling them the VijÃ±Ã¢navÃ¢dins or the YogÃ¢cÃ¢ras and the ÅÃ»nyavÃ¢dins, they often refer to the SarvÃ»stivÃ»dins by which they mean both the SautrÃ»ntikas and the VaibhÃ»á¹£ikas, ignoring the difference that exists between these two schools. It is well to mention that there is hardly any evidence to prove that the Hindu writers were acquainted with the TheravÃ»da doctrines as expressed in the PÃ¢li works. The VaibhÃ¢á¹£ikas and the SautrÃ¢ntikas have been more or less associated with each other. Thus the AbhidharmakoÅaÅÃ¢stra of Vasubandhu who was a VaibhÃ¢á¹£ika was commented upon by YaÅomitra who was a SautrÃ¢ntika. The difference between the VaibhÃ¢á¹£ikas and the SautrÃ¢ntikas that attracted the notice of the Hindu writers was this, that the former believed that external objects were directly perceived, whereas the latter believed that the existence of the external objects could only be inferred from our diversified knowledge98. Guá¹aratna (fourteenth century A.D.) in his commentary TarkarahasyadÃ®pikÃ¢ on á¹¢aá¸darÅanasamuccaya says that the VaibhÃ¢sika was but another name of the ÃryasammitÃ®ya school. According to Guá¹aratna the VaibhÃ¢á¹£ikas held that things existed for four moments, the moment of production, the moment of existence, the moment of decay and the moment of annihilation. It has been pointed out in Vastlbandhu's AbhidharmakoÅa that the VaibhÃ¢á¹£ikas believed these to be four kinds of forces which by coming in combination with the permanent essence of an entity produced its impermanent manifestations in life (see Prof. Stcherbatsky's translation of YaÅomitra on AbhidharmakoÅa kÃ¢rikÃ¢, V. 25). The self called pudgala also possessed those characteristics. Knowledge was formless and was produced along with its object by the very same conditions (arthasahabhÃ¢sÃ® ekasamÃ¢gryadhÃ®nah). The SautrÃ¢ntikas according to Guá¹aratna held that there was no soul but only the five skandhas. These skandhas transmigrated. The past, the future, annihilation, dependence on cause, Ã¢kÃ¢Åa and pudgala are but names (saá¹jÃ±Ã¢mÃ¢tram), mere assertions (pratijÃ±Ã¢mÃ¢tram), mere limitations (samv á¹tamÃ¢tram) and mere phenomena (vyavahÃ¢ramÃ¢tram). By pudgala they meant that which other people called eternal and all pervasive soul. External objects are never directly perceived but are only inferred as existing for explaining the diversity of knowledge. Definite cognitions are valid; all compounded things are momentary (ká¹£aá¹ikÃ¢h sarvasaá¹skÃ¢rÃ¢h).\n\nThe atoms of colour, taste, smell and touch, and cognition are being destroyed every moment. The meanings of words always imply the negations of all other things, excepting that which is intended to be signified by that word (anyÃ¢pohaá¸¥ ÅabdÃ¢rthaá¸¥). Salvation (moká¹£a) comes as the result of the destruction of the process of knowledge through continual meditation that there is no soul99.\n\nOne of the main differences between the VibhajjavÃ¢dins, SautrÃ¢ntikas and the VaibhÃ¢á¹£ikas or the SarvÃ¢stivÃ¢dins appears to refer to the notion of time which is a subject of great interest with Buddhist philosophy. Thus AbhidharmakoÅa (v. 24...) describes the SarvÃ¢stivÃ¢dins as those who maintain the universal existence of everything past, present and future. The VibhajjavÃ¢dins are those \"who maintain that the present elements and those among the past that have not yet produced their fruition, are existent, but they deny the existence of the future ones and of those among the past that have already produced fruition.\" There were four branches of this school represented by DharmatrÃ¢ta, Ghoá¹£a, Vasumitra and Buddhadeva. DharmatrÃ¢ta maintained that when an element enters different times, its existence changes but not its essence, just as when milk is changed into curd or a golden vessel is broken, the form of the existence changes though the essence remains the same. Ghoá¹£a held that \"when an element appears at different times, the past one retains its past aspects without being severed from its future and present aspects, the present likewise retains its present aspect without completely losing its past and future aspects,\" just as a man in passionate love with a woman does not lose his capacity to love other women though he is not actually in love with them. Vasumitra held that an entity is called present, past and future according as it produces its efficiency, ceases to produce after having once produced it or has not yet begun to produce it. Buddhadeva maintained the view that just as the same woman may be called mother, daughter, wife, so the same entity may be called present, past or future in accordance with its relation to the preceding or the succeeding moment.\n\nAll these schools are in some sense SarvÃ¢stivÃ¢dins, for they maintain universal existence. But the VaibhÃ¢á¹£ika finds them all defective excepting the view of Vasumitra. For DharmatrÃ¢ta's view is only a veiled SÃ¢á¹khya doctrine; that of Ghoá¹£a is a confusion of the notion of time, since it presupposes the coexistence of all the aspects of an entity at the same time, and that of Buddhadeva is also an impossible situation, since it would suppose that all the three times were found together and included in one of them. The VaibhÃ¢á¹£ika finds himself in agreement with Vasumitra's view and holds that the difference in time depends upon the difference of the function of an entity; at the time when an entity does not actually produce its function it is future; when it produces it, it becomes present; when after having produced it, it stops, it becomes past; there is a real existence of the past and the future as much as of the present. He thinks that if the past did not exist and assert some efficiency it could not have been the object of my knowledge, and deeds done in past times could not have produced its effects in the present time. The SautrÃ¢ntika however thought that the VaibhÃ¢á¹£ika's doctrine would imply the heretical doctrine of eternal existence, for according to them the stuff remained the same and the time-difference appeared in it. The true view according to him was, that there was no difference between the efficiency of an entity, the entity and the time of its appearance. Entities appeared from non-existence, existed for a moment and again ceased to exist. He objected to the VaibhÃ¢á¹£ika view that the past is to be regarded as existent because it exerts efficiency in bringing about the present on the ground that in that case there should be no difference between the past and the present, since both exerted efficiency. If a distinction is made between past, present and future efficiency by a second grade of efficiencies, then we should have to continue it and thus have a vicious infinite. We can know non-existent entities as much as we can know existent ones, and hence our knowledge of the past does not imply that the past is exerting any efficiency. If a distinction is made between an efficiency and an entity, then the reason why efficiency started at any particular time and ceased at another would be inexplicable. Once you admit that there is no difference between efficiency and the entity, you at once find that there is no time at all and the efficiency, the entity and the moment are all one and the same. When we remember a thing of the past we do not know it as existing in the past, but in the same way in which we knew it when it was present. We are never attracted to past passions as the VaibhÃ¢á¹£ika suggests, but past passions leave residues which become the causes of new passions of the present moment100.\n\nAgain we can have a glimpse of the respective positions of the VÃ¢tsiputtrÃ®yas and the SarvÃ¢stivÃ¢dins as represented by Vasubandhu if we attend to the discussion on the subject of the existence of soul in AbhidharmakoÅa. The argument of Vasubandhu against the existence of soul is this, that though it is true that the sense organs may be regarded as a determining cause of perception, no such cause can be found which may render the inference of the existence of soul necessary. If soul actually exists, it must have an essence of its own and must be something different from the elements or entities of a personal life. Moreover, such an eternal, uncaused and unchanging being would be without any practical efficiency (arthakriyÃ¢kÃ¢ritva) which alone determines or proves existence. The soul can thus be said to have a mere nominal existence as a mere object of current usage. There is no soul, but there are only the elements of a personal life. But the VÃ¢tsiputtrÃ®ya school held that just as fire could not be said to be either the same as the burning wood or as different from it, and yet it is separate from it, so the soul is an individual (pudgala) which has a separate existence, though we could not say that it was altogether different from the elements of a personal life or the same as these. It exists as being conditioned by the elements of personal life, but it cannot further be defined. But its existence cannot be denied, for wherever there is an activity, there must be an agent (e.g. Devadatta walks). To be conscious is likewise an action, hence the agent who is conscious must also exist. To this Vasubandhu replies that Devadatta (the name of a person) does not represent an unity. \"It is only an unbroken continuity of momentary forces (flashing into existence), which simple people believe to be a unity and to which they give the name Devadatta. Their belief that Devadatta moves is conditioned, and is based on an analogy with their own experience, but their own continuity of life consists in constantly moving from one place to another. This movement, though regarded as belonging to a permanent entity, is but a series of new productions in different places, just as the expressions 'fire moves,' 'sound spreadÅ have the meaning of continuities (of new productions in new places). They likewise use the words 'Devadatta cogniseÅ in order to express the fact that a cognition (takes place in the present moment) which has a cause (in the former moments, these former moments coming in close succession being called Devadatta).\"\n\nThe problem of memory also does not bring any difficulty, for the stream of consciousness being one throughout, it produces its recollections when connected with a previous knowledge of the remembered object under certain conditions of attention, etc., and absence of distractive factors, such as bodily pains or violent emotions. No agent is required in the phenomena of memory. The cause of recollection is a suitable state of mind and nothing else. When the Buddha told his birth stories saying that he was such and such in such and such a life, he only meant that his past and his present belonged to one and the same lineage of momentary existences. Just as when we say \"this same fire which had been consuming that has reached this object,\" we know that the fire is not identical at any two moments, but yet we overlook the difference and say that it is the same fire. Again, what we call an individual can only be known by descriptions such as \"this venerable man, having this name, of such a caste, of such a family, of such an age, eating such food, finding pleasure or displeasure in such things, of such an age, the man who after a life of such length, will pass away having reached an age.\" Only so much description can be understood, but we have never a direct acquaintance with the individual; all that is perceived are the momentary elements of sensations, images, feelings, etc., and these happening at the former moments exert a pressure on the later ones. The individual is thus only a fiction, a mere nominal existence, a mere thing of description and not of acquaintance; it cannot be grasped either by the senses or by the action of pure intellect. This becomes evident when we judge it by analogies from other fields. Thus whenever we use any common noun, e.g. milk, we sometimes falsely think that there is such an entity as milk, but what really exists is only certain momentary colours, tastes, etc., fictitiously unified as milk; and \"just as milk and water are conventional names (for a set of independent elements) for some colour, smell (taste and touch) taken together, so is the designation 'individual' but a common name for the different elements of which it is composed.\"\n\nThe reason why the Buddha declined to decide the question whether the \"living being is identical with the body or not\" is just because there did not exist any living being as \"individual,\" as is generally supposed. He did not declare that the living being did not exist, because in that case the questioner would have thought that the continuity of the elements of a life was also denied. In truth the \"living being\" is only a conventional name for a set of constantly changing elements101.\n\nThe only book of the SammitÃ®yas known to us and that by name only is the SammitÃ®yaÅÃ¢stra translated into Chinese between 350 A.D. to 431 A.D.; the original Sanskrit works are however probably lost102.\n\nThe VaibhÃ¢á¹£ikas are identified with the SarvÃ¢stivÃ¢dins who according to DÃ®pavaá¹sa V. 47, as pointed out by Takakusu, branched off from the MahÃ®ÅÃ¢sakas, who in their turn had separated from the TheravÃ¢da school.\n\nFrom the KathÃ¢vatthu we know (1) that the SabbatthivÃ¢dins believed that everything existed, (2) that the dawn of right attainment was not a momentary flash of insight but by a gradual process, (3) that consciousness or even samÃ¢dhi was nothing but a flux and (4) that an arhat (saint) may fall away103. The SabbatthivÃ¢dins or SarvÃ¢stivÃ¢dins have a vast Abhidharma literature still existing in Chinese translations which is different from the Abhidharma of the TheravÃ¢da school which we have already mentioned104. These are 1. JÃ±Ã¢naprasthÃ¢na ÅÃ¢stra of KÃ¢tyÃ¢yanÃ®puttra which passed by the name of MahÃ¢ VibhÃ¢á¹£Ã¢ from which the SabbatthivÃ¢dins who followed it are called VaibhÃ¢á¹£ikas105. This work is said to have been given a literary form by AÅvaghoá¹£a. 2. Dharmaskandha by ÅÃ¢riputtra. 3. DhÃ¢tukÃ¢ya by PÃ»rá¹a. 4. PrajÃ±aptiÅÃ¢stra by MaudgalyÃ¢yana. 5. VijÃ±Ã¢nakÃ¢ya by Devaká¹£ema. 6. Saá¹gÃ®tiparyyÃ¢ya by SÃ¢riputtra and Prakaraá¹apÃ¢da by Vasumitra. Vasubandhu (420 A.D.-500 A.D.) wrote a work on the VaibhÃ¢á¹£ika106 system in verses (kÃ¢rikÃ¢) known as the AbhidharmakoÅa, to which he appended a commentary of his own which passes by the name Abhidharma KoÅabhÃ¢á¹£ya in which he pointed out some of the defects of the VaibhÃ¢á¹£ika school from the SautrÃ¢ntika point of view107. This work was commented upon by Vasumitra and Guá¹amati and later on by YaÅomitra who was himself a SautrÃ¢ntika and called his work AbhidharmakoÅa vyÃ¢khyÃ¢; Saá¹ghabhadra a contemporary of Vasubandhu wrote Samayapradipa and NyÃ¢yÃ¢nusÃ¢ra (Chinese translations of which are available) on strict VaibhÃ¢á¹£ika lines. We hear also of other VaibhÃ¢á¹£ika writers such as DharmatrÃ¢ta, Ghoá¹£aka, Vasumitra and Bhadanta, the writer of Saá¹yuktÃ¢bhidharmaÅÃ¢stra and MahÃ¢vibhÃ¢á¹£Ã¢. Diá¹nÃ¢ga(480 A.D.), the celebrated logician, a VaibhÃ¢á¹£ika or a SautrÃ¢ntika and reputed to be a pupil of Vasubandhu, wrote his famous work PramÃ¢á¹asamuccaya in which he established Buddhist logic and refuted many of the views of VÃ¢tsyÃ¢yana the celebrated commentator of the NyÃ¢ya sÃ»tras; but we regret to say that none of the above works are available in Sanskrit, nor have they been retranslated from Chinese or Tibetan into any of the modern European or Indian languages.\n\nThe Japanese scholar Mr Yamakami Sogen, late lecturer at Calcutta University, describes the doctrine of the SabbatthivÃ¢dins from the Chinese versions of the AbhidharmakoÅa, MahÃ¢vibhÃ¢á¹£Ã¢ÅÃ¢stra, etc., rather elaborately108. The following is a short sketch, which is borrowed mainly from the accounts given by Mr Sogen.\n\nThe SabbatthivÃ¢dins admitted the five skandhas, twelve Ã¢yatanas, eighteen dhÃ¢tus, the three asaá¹sk á¹ta dharmas of pratisaá¹khyÃ¢nirodha apratisaá¹khyÃ¢nirodha and Ã¢kÃ¢Åa, and the saá¹sk á¹ta dharmas (things composite and interdependent) of rÃ»pa (matter), citta (mind), caitta (mental) and cittaviprayukta (non-mental)109. All effects are produced by the coming together (saá¹sk á¹ta) of a number of causes. The five skandhas, and the rÃ»pa, citta, etc., are thus called saá¹sk á¹ta dharmas (composite things or collocations--sambhÃ»yakÃ¢ri). The rÃ»pa dharmas are eleven in number, one citta dharma, 46 caitta dharmas and 14 cittaviprayukta saá¹skÃ¢ra dharmas (non-mental composite things); adding to these the three asaá¹sk á¹ta dharmas we have the seventy-five dharmas. RÃ»pa is that which has the capacity to obstruct the sense organs. Matter is regarded as the collective organism or collocation, consisting of the fourfold substratum of colour, smell, taste and contact. The unit possessing this fourfold substratum is known as paramÃ¢á¹u, which is the minutest form of rÃ»pa. It cannot be pierced through or picked up or thrown away. It is indivisible, unanalysable, invisible, inaudible, untastable and intangible. But yet it is not permanent, but is like a momentary flash into being. The simple atoms are called dravyaparamÃ¢á¹u and the compound ones saá¹ghÃ¢taparamÃ¢á¹u. In the words of Prof. Stcherbatsky \"the universal elements of matter are manifested in their actions or functions. They are consequently more energies than substances.\" The organs of sense are also regarded as modifications of atomic matter. Seven such paramÃ¢á¹us combine together to form an aá¹u, and it is in this combined form only that they become perceptible. The combination takes place in the form of a cluster having one atom at the centre and others around it. The point which must be remembered in connection with the conception of matter is this, that the qualities of all the mahÃ¢bhÃ»tas are inherent in the paramÃ¢á¹us. The special characteristics of roughness (which naturally belongs to earth), viscousness (which naturally belongs to water), heat (belonging to fire), movableness (belonging to wind), combine together to form each of the elements; the difference between the different elements consists only in this, that in each of them its own special characteristics were predominant and active, and other characteristics though present remained only in a potential form. The mutual resistance of material things is due to the quality of earth or the solidness inherent in them; the mutual attraction of things is due to moisture or the quality of water, and so forth. The four elements are to be observed from three aspects, namely, (1) as things, (2) from the point of view of their natures (such as activity, moisture, etc.), and (3) function (such as dh á¹ti or attraction, saá¹graha or cohesion, pakti or chemical heat, and vyÃ»hana or clustering and collecting). These combine together naturally by other conditions or causes. The main point of distinction between the VaibhÃ¢á¹£ika SarvÃ¢stivadins and other forms of Buddhism is this, that here the five skandhas and matter are regarded as permanent and eternal; they are said to be momentary only in the sense that they are changing their phases constantly, owing to their constant change of combination. AvidyÃ¢ is not regarded here as a link in the chain of the causal series of pratÃ®tyasamutpÃ¢da; nor is it ignorance of any particular individual, but is rather identical with \"moha\" or delusion and represents the ultimate state of immaterial dharmas. AvidyÃ¢, which through saá¹skÃ¢ra, etc., produces nÃ¢marÃ»pa in the case of a particular individual, is not his avidyÃ¢ in the present existence but the avidyÃ¢ of his past existence bearing fruit in the present life.\n\n\"The cause never perishes but only changes its name, when it becomes an effect, having changed its state.\" For example, clay becomes jar, having changed its state; and in this case the name clay is lost and the name jar arises110. The SarvÃ¢stivÃ¢dins allowed simultaneousness between cause and effect only in the case of composite things (saá¹prayukta hetu) and in the case of the interaction of mental and material things. The substratum of \"vijÃ±Ã¢na\" or \"consciousness\" is regarded as permanent and the aggregate of the five senses (indriyas) is called the perceiver. It must be remembered that the indriyas being material had a permanent substratum, and their aggregate had therefore also a substratum formed of them.\n\nThe sense of sight grasps the four main colours of blue, yellow, red, white, and their combinations, as also the visual forms of appearance (saá¹sthÃ¢na) of long, short, round, square, high, low, straight, and crooked. The sense of touch (kÃ¢yendriya) has for its object the four elements and the qualities of smoothness, roughness, lightness, heaviness, cold, hunger and thirst. These qualities represent the feelings generated in sentient beings by the objects of touch, hunger, thirst, etc., and are also counted under it, as they are the organic effects produced by a touch which excites the physical frame at a time when the energy of wind becomes active in our body and predominates over other energies; so also the feeling of thirst is caused by a touch which excites the physical frame when the energy of the element of fire becomes active and predominates over the other energies. The indriyas (senses) can after grasping the external objects arouse thought (vijÃ±Ã¢na); each of the five senses is an agent without which none of the five vijÃ±Ã¢nas would become capable of perceiving an external object. The essence of the senses is entirely material. Each sense has two subdivisions, namely, the principal sense and the auxiliary sense. The substratum of the principal senses consists of a combination of paramÃ¢á¹us, which are extremely pure and minute, while the substratum of the latter is the flesh, made of grosser materials. The five senses differ from one another with respect to the manner and form of their respective atomic combinations. In all sense-acts, whenever an act is performed and an idea is impressed, a latent energy is impressed on our person which is designated as avijÃ±apti rÃ»pa. It is called rÃ»pa because it is a result or effect of rÃ»pa-contact; it is called avijÃ±apti because it is latent and unconsc"
