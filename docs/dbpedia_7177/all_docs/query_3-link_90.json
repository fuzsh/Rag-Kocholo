The details of the criticism and the processes of self-argumentation by which the thinker arrived at his theory of the Universe might indeed be suppressed, as being relatively unimportant but a thoughtful reader would detect them as lying in the background behind the shadow of the general speculations, but at the same time setting them off before our view. An Aristotle or a Patanjali may not make any direct mention of the arguments which led them to a dogmatic assertion of their theories, but for a reader who intends to understand them thoroughly it is absolutely necessary that he should read theiri in the light as far as possible of the inferred presuppositions and inner arguments of their minds ; it is in this way alone that he can put himself in the same line of thinking with the thinker he is willing to follow and can grasp him to the fullest extent. In offering this short study of the Patanjala metaphysics, I shall therefore try to supple- ment it with such of my inferences of the presupposi- tions of Patanjali's mind, which I think will add to the clearness of the exposition of his views, though 1 am fully alive to the difficulties of making such inferences about a philosopher whose psychological, social, religious and moral environments differed so widely from ours.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1440068771/?tag=2022091-20\n\nA History of Indian Philosophy (5 Vols.)\n\n(The work appears in five volumes.

Vol. I comprises Buddhist and Jaina Philosophy and the six systems of Hindu thought, viz., Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisesika, Mimamsa and Vedanta. Vol. II completes studies in the Sankara school of Vedanta. It also contains the philosophy of the Yogavasistha, the Bhagavadgita and speculations in the medical schools. Vol. III contains an elaborate account of the principal dualistic and pluralistic systems such as the philosophy of the Pancaratra. Bhaskara, Yamuna, Ramanuja, Nimbarka, Vijnanabhiksu and philosophical speculations of some of the selected Puranas. Vol. IV deals with the Bhagavata Purana, Madhva and his school, Vallabha, Caitanya, Jiva Gosvami and Baladeva Vidyabhusana. Vol. V treats of the southern schools of Saivism, viz., Saiva Siddhanta, Vira Saivism, philosophy of Srikantha, Saiva philosophy in the Puranas and in some important texts. In the words of the Oxford Journal 'the collection of data, editing and the interpretation of every school of thought is a feat unparalleled in the field of history of philosophy.'\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8120804082/?tag=2022091-20\n\nYoga as Philosophy and Religion\n\n(Practical guide promotes Rajayoga and compares its essent...)\n\nPractical guide promotes Rajayoga and compares its essential features with other systems.
