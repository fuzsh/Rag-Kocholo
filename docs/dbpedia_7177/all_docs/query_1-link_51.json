Lord Cornwallis established the Benares Sanskrit College in 1791 as an answer to the Calcutta Madrasah founded by Warren Hastings in 1781. The foundation stone of the Sanskrit College, Calcutta, was laid on 25 February 1824 and its present grand edifice came up on 1 May 1826. First-rate Sanskrit pundits of Bengal came together to teach the various branches of Sanskrit learning at this college. Iswarchandra Vidyasagar who was a product of this college was its Principal from 1851-1858. There were, however, plans to abolish the college when Macaulay was President of the East India Company's Education Committee. I do not wish to go into the details of this Anglo-saxon vandalism which are very well summed up in Brajendranath Bandyopadhaya's Kalikata Sanskrita Kalejer Itihas 1824-1858 (1945). But it is important to remember that it was a British Sanskritist, Horace Hayman Wilson (1786-1860) who saved the college. He was a visitor to Sanskrit College until he left Calcutta for England. When Macaulay proposed the abolition of Sanskrit College Premchand Tarkobagis wrote a letter to Wilson in Sanskrit verse in which he called the institution a kurangah Krishanga (a sickly deer) about to be speared by \"mecale byadharaja\" (Macaulay the king of huntsmen). NEW SYSTEM Wilson answered the letter in Sanskrit verse saying that durva na mriayte\" (grass does not perish) chhagadaishcha vicharpitapi (even when chewed by goats). Wilson likened Sanskrit to the perennial green grass of the Indian soil. The verses are quoted in full by Ramakshay Chattopadhya (1829-1914) in his Premchandra Tarkavagisher jivancharit o kavitavali (1892). In the new education system that emerged with the foundation of our three presidency universities, Calcutta, Bombay and Madras in 1857 Sanskrit had its position, there being departments of Sanskrit in all our schools, colleges and universities. When I entered high school in 1927, at the age of 12, after two years in a primary school, I had to do a course in Sanskrit and for my matriculation two of my seven three-hour papers were Sanskrit (compulsory) and Sanskrit (additional). I did not find it burdensome. I knew that a Hindu Indian was born in Sanskrit, he would marry in Sanskrit and finally would die in Sanskrit. But although the university produced first-rate Sanskrit scholars like Haraprasad Sastri, Ramendra-sundar Trivedi, Suniti Kumar Chatterji, and Sukumar Sen we felt that Sanskrit had no strong presence in our intellectual temper. Europe dominated our mental life and we had no notion of the spirit of Sanskrit as an active element in our life. While we had scholars to explain to us the wisdom of the Vedas and the Upanishads where was there a scholar to produce a work on the ideals of ancient India like SH Butcher's Some Aspects of the Greek Genius (1891) or Gilbert Murray's Hellenism and the Modern World (1953) or CM Bowra's The Greek Experience (1958). Somehow we thought that the language of ancient India was not so relevant to modern life, while most intellectuals of Europe, howsoever committed to Christianity, were essentially pagans \"suckled in a creed outworn\". Suniti Kumar Chatterji's Indianism and the Indian Synthesis, his Kamala Lectures delivered in Calcutta University in 1959 and published in 1962, did not really create an Indianism like the European's creation of Hellenism. Suniti Kumar's earlier work on the subject, \"Indianism and Sanskrit\" published in the Annals of the Bhandarkar Research Institute in 1957 too had little influence on the modern Indian mind's response to Sanskrit as the language of a great culture. We must, however, realise that a modern culture must be rooted in a classical past. The Latin mind which created modern Europe was nursed on the Greek classics. So devoted were the ancient Romans to Greek literature that Horace (65-8 BC) wrote in his Epistles: Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit et artes/ intuilit agresti Latio (captive Greece took captive her savage conqueror, and brought civilisation to barbarous Latium). In spite of this heavy debt to Greece Rome had a culture of her own, a fact sometimes denied by modern scholarship. Thus the French classicist HI Marrou says in his A History of Education in Antiquity (Eng tr, George Lamb, 1964) \"a genuinely autonomous Italian civilisation had no time to grow up, because Rome and Italy were snatched up into the civilisation of Greece\". FOUNDATION This is not true. Virgil had a voice of his own although he had made Homer his master. Clive Bell did not see this when he wrote in his Civilisation (1928, Pelican 1938) that there is nothing in Latin literature which \"is not a dull echo of Greece\". If we strive to give a classical base to our culture and turn to Sanskrit for discovering that base we will not lose our originality. But how to turn to Sanskrit to make it the foundation of our culture? What is the place of Sanskrit in our education? The Radhakrishnan Commission Report on Education (1949) made a plea for more attention to Sanskrit. But this did not really establish the importance of Sanskrit in our education. On 1 October 1956 the Government of India appointed a Sanskrit Commission with Suniti Kumar Chatterji as chairman, who presented his report on 4 November 1957. The very first recommendation of the commission was that the government \"make an adequate provision for the study of Sanskrit in the scheme of general education in schools\". This has not been done. The other recommendations urge public expenditure on the promotion of the subject. It is the last recommendation urging creation of Sanskrit universities which I think is a danger to the future of Sanskrit in our country. Some Sanskrit universities have already come up and they are only isolating Sanskrit from the main stream of our academic life. Our government has done a good deal to affirm the supreme importance of Sanskrit. It is one of the languages in the eighth schedule of the Constitution although we do not know if there is any Indian who does his shopping in Sanskrit or quarrels with his wife in that language. Sanskrit is one of the languages in which news is broadcast. Let us remember that in Greece news is not broadcast in the language of Homer and Rome does not broadcast news in the language of Virgil. Satyameva Jayate is our government's motto although truth has been a rare commodity in our public life since independence. What is to be done now? I think it is still not too late to realise that the roots of our culture is in the spiritual and moral tradition which is embodied in Sanskrit. And if we must now try to find our place in the modern world, the world of Bacon, Newton, Hume and Mill, the world of Marx and Freud, we must go back to the Vedanta. Sri Ramakrishna and Vivekananda, Rabindranath and Sri Aurobindo, have brought to us the message of the ancient India. Our medieval religious poets were rooted in the Vedanta though they wrote their poems in their vernaculars. It is true that Kabir (1440-1518) disparages Sanskrit in one of his songs saying Kabira, Sanskrita kupoajala bhasha bahata nir (O Kabir, Sanskrit is the water of the well, vernacular is a running stream.) VERNACULAR What the medieval mystic says is true: but this does not mean rejection of Sanskrit. The words in this verse are Sanskritic words and Kabir's philosophy has a Vedantic foundation. What he disliked was pedantry, which destroys bhakti. Actually in our middle ages there was a strong link between Sanskrit and the vernacular and the Alwar poets composing Vaishnava songs in Tamil are said to be the originators of the bhakti movement. Both Radhakrishnan and Surendranath Dasgupta find in Alwar poetry the source of the philosophy of Ramanuja's Sribhashay of the 12th century. The British editor of Alwar songs, JSM Hooper, says: \"The Alvars provided the soil out of which Ramanuja's teaching naturally sprang and in which later it could bear fruit\" (Hymns of the Alvars, 1929). It is true that since our middle ages we have a kind of vernacular Vedanta but to keep it alive we must cultivate Sanskrit. In his address \"The Future of India\", Vivekananda was bold enough to assert that \"the great Buddha made one false step when he stopped the Sanskrit language from being studied by the masses\" (Selections from Swami Vivekananda, 1944). Sri Aurobindo urged the cultivation of Sanskrit and our vernaculars to \"establish a vivid continuity between the still living power of our past and yet uncreated power of our future\". Rabindranath was so keen to introduce Sanskrit in our primary schools that he wrote a Sanskrit primer called Sanskrita Shisksha in 1896. We may not be able to take Sanskrit to our masses; but we may make it a compulsory subject in our schools. And we will succeed in this effort if we lay more stress on learning languages than on knowing the world.\n\nNext message: Started of on development now completing ISI agenda\n\nPrevious message: Statement issued by BJP Study Committee on Foreign Affairs"
