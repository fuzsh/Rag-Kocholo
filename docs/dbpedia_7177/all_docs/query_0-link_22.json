In the wake of the British conspiracy in 1905 to divide Great Bengal, people rose to the occasion spontaneously and the popular wheel of Swadeshi Movement started rolling with unprecendented vigour.

Bengal was exclusively formed as an apex body to impart education in Literature, Science, Engineering and Technology entirely on national perspective. The original Technical Institute on N.C.E. Bengal was named the Bengal Technical Institute. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation under the able leadership of its patriotic Mayor, Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das leased the present site of the Jadavpur University campus of N.C.E. where its engineering college was shifted in 1924 under the name of College of Engineering and Technology.
