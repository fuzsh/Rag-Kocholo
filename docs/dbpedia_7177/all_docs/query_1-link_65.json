He had an inner pride that led him to learn everything by his own efforts. He never wanted any stimulus from outside. Whenever he took up any work, he threw his whole soul and being into it. He passed his m.a. In Philo sophy in 1910, as a private candidate, summarising all the pre scribed books in his own way. He was twice offered a state scholarship to study Sanskrit in a scientific manner in Europe, but as he was the only child of his parents, he refused out of consideration for their feelings. He began his service at Rajshahi College as an officiating lecturer in Sanskrit. He was soon provided with a permanent professorship at Chittagong College, where he worked from 1911 to 1920 and from 1922 to 1924.\n\nBook Details\n\nPIBN10061213ISBN978-1-4400-5247-7ISBN (Hardcover)978-0-260-18580-8LanguageEnglishCategoryHinduismPages216Words78539Vocabulary2469\n\nBooks you might also like..."
