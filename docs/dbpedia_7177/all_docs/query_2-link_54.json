        "text": "A History\n\nof Indian\n\nPhilosophyby\n\nSurendranath DasguptaVol. 1\n\nReview\n\nThis is the first volume of Surendranath Dasgupta's five volume work on the history of Indian philosophy. Starting with the earliest movements each philosophy is not just described but explained in detail and shown in its place in history. This includes vedic thought, yoga, buddhism and many others.\n\nProfessor Dasgupta provides an argument that philosophy was the highest calling in India to the extent that it rivalled or even surpassed the ancient Greeks and provided unity across a large and diverse country. Certainly his writing will provide a radical change in world view to anyone unaccustomed to viewing India as a philosophical powerhouse.\n\nThis book is written in clear language, but this is not a simple topic as it covers a huge range of thought and philosophies. The reader should be prepared for an education.\n\nExcerpt\n\nThough I have begun my work from the Vedic and Brah manic stage, my treatment of this period has been very slight. The beginnings of the evolution of philosophical thought, though they can be traced in the later Vedic hymns, are neither connected nor systematic.\n\nBook Details\n\nPIBN10012801ISBN978-1-4400-5244-6ISBN (Hardcover)978-0-266-19897-0LanguageEnglishCategoryEasternPages546Words206090Vocabulary3897\n\nBooks you might also like..."
