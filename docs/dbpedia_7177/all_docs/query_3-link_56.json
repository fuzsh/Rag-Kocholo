This document provides a preface to the author's work \"A History of Indian Philosophy\". The author explains that Indian philosophy was a unifying force in ancient Indian culture and the most important achievement of Indian thought. The book aims to present Indian philosophical thought accurately and show how many problems discussed in Indian philosophy also occurred in modern Western philosophy. It collects materials from Sanskrit texts on each philosophical system and arranges them systematically while staying faithful to the original ideas. The author hopes this work will help provide an understanding of Indian philosophy's significance for both India and the world.",
