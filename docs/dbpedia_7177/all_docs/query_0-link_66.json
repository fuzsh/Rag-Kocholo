It is a path of self-realisation. The translation work that has been done truly connects ancient India to today’s time.”\n\n“The Upanishads” by Eknath Easwaran: Easwaran’s translation of “The Upanishads” offers a comprehensive guide to these foundational texts that explore the nature of reality, self, and consciousness.
