        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nAyurveda is the oldest existing health science in the world. This branch of knowledge is believed to be originated 5000 years ago (at 3000 BC). The Ayurvedic knowledge still flows with dignity, despite various hurdles. In the texts of Ayurveda, it is claimed that Ayurveda is Shashwata (~eternal). Three reasons are mentioned for the eternality of Ayurveda, i.e., Anaditwa (~it has no beginning), SwabhavaSamsiddhatwa (~deals with things inherent in nature), and BhavaswabhavaNityatwa (~eternal natural manifestations).[1] Many hurdles in the forms of lack of government support, denial of permission to practice, and prevention of teaching came in the way of Ayurveda. However, this great science has successfully overcome all the hurdles and is still flourishing with glory.\n\nThe most powerful obstacle came in the way of the existence of Ayurveda during the British rule in India. In Colonial India, an attempt had been taken by the British rulers to ruin this great branch of health sciences completely. However, the attempt was unsuccessful due to the determination of the Ayurvedic physicians to protect their science from the western invasion. Moreover, in that odd struggle, the Ayurvedic physicians from Bengal played commendable roles. This was also a freedom fight; a fight to protect Indian traditional heritage, culture, and knowledge from British aggression.\n\nInitially, during the late 18th and early 19th century, it seemed possible that the Ayurvedic and Allopathic systems of medicine could live in peaceful co-existence and mutual accommodation. However, gradually, with professional pressure from Britain and State sanctioning in India, western medicine moved to a dominant position in the State provision of medical services. By the end of the 19th century, advances in western medicine undermined the similarities of theory and practice of another system of medicine.[2] At that time, a movement was needed for the protection of this great science. The Ayurvedic physicians from all over India in general and from Bengal, in particular, had fought and attempted to protect the ancient wisdom of medical science, the Ayurveda.\n\nThe Ayurvedic system of medicine got momentum from the “Swadeshi” or Nationalist movement in the early decades of the 20th century. Advocates of the noncooperation movement prevented the sick and poor from attending western medical hospitals, and instead advocated indigenous methods of treatment.[2]\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe British Rulers in Colonial India had always tried to impose western heritage and culture over Indian traditional knowledge and culture. They used the government funds for spreading the English language and western culture. In the year 1813, the East India Company decided to fund D-100,000/- per year for the promotion of English literature and knowledge of science to the Indians. It continued for 20 years. In 1833, Lord William Bentinck, then Governor General of the British East India Company formed a committee headed by T. B. Macaulay for reallocating the funds required by the British Parliament to spend on literature and education in India. The version of Macaulay for renewal of this Company’s charter was like that “I see a government anxiously bent on the public good. Even in its errors, I recognize a paternal feeling towards the great people committed to its charge. I see toleration strictly maintained. However, I see bloody and degrading superstitions gradually losing their power. I see the morality, philosophy, the taste of Europe, beginning to produce a salutary effect on the hearts and understandings of our subjects. I see the public mind of India, that public mind which we found debased and contracted by the worst forms of political and religious tyranny, expanding itself to just and noble views of the ends of government and the social duties of man.”[3]\n\nHe summarized his recommendation with these words “To sum up what I have said, I think it is clear that we are not fettered by the Act of Parliament of 1813; that we are not fettered by any pledge expressed or implied; that we are free to employ our funds as we choose; that we ought to employ them in teaching what is best worth knowing; that English is better worth knowing than Sanskrit or Arabic; that the natives are desirous to be taught English, and are not desirous to be taught Sanskrit or Arabic; that neither as the languages of law, nor as the languages of religion, have the Sanskrit and Arabic any peculiar claim to our engagement; that it is possible to make natives of this country thoroughly good English scholars, and that to this end our efforts ought to be directed.”[3]\n\nFinally, the English Education Act came into effect in 1835. The Act had four major objectives; first, all the funds appropriated for education would be best employed for the promotion of the English literature and science among the citizens of India; second, stipend to the students and professors of vernacular languages would be stopped; Third, no portion of government funds would be employed for the printing of oriental books; and fourth, all the funds would be employed in imparting to the native population. Knowledge of English literature and science will be communicated through the medium of the English language only.[4]\n\nThis education act broke the backbone of the traditional Ayurvedic education system of India. Ayurvedic education in the institutes was stopped due to noncooperation from the British government. The publication of Ayurvedic books was halted due to a lack of funds from the government. Thus, Ayurvedic knowledge became at a standstill in its land.\n\nTHE THREE INDIGENOUS MEDICAL POLICIES\n\nThe indigenous medical policy in Bengal was laid in 1822. The policy can be summed up in three phases according to the relation between the Ayurvedic and allopathic medical systems in Bengal. In the initial phase, there was a peaceful co-existence and incorporation of the indigenous forms of medicine. This was based upon the similarity of theories of treatment and the exploration of pharmacopeia. This co-existence lasted until the 1860s.\n\nIn the second phase, the increasing professionalization of medicine in Britain and the standardization of drugs led to differences of opinion between the two forms of medicine. In each of the first two phases, the State, for reasons of economy, had an interest in promoting indigenous medicine and medical practice. Medical training was included as an essential part of this policy. It was a force for cooperation between indigenous and western systems.\n\nIn the last phase, which started toward the turn of the 20th century, there was a rise in the chemical industry in Europe and the increasing professionalization of medical practice. Allopathic medicine, at this stage, exhibited great divergence from Ayurvedic medicine, and thus posed a far greater threat to Ayurvedic medicine than in earlier years. In response to this, the nationalist movement called for the regeneration and extension of the Ayurvedic system of medical practice in India in general and in Bengal in particular.[2]\n\nCHALLENGES\n\nDuring the British rule, the Ayurvedic system of medicine faced many challenges from different fonts, in the field of education, practice, medicine, and others. From abolishment of the medical education in indigenous languages in 1835 to the establishment of Ayurvedic College in 1916, these 80 years were crucial in the history of Ayurvedic education in India. After the establishment of Calcutta Medical College in 1835, the British policy was to push out the indigenous medicine of India and to patronize the western medical system. It became very difficult to get interested students and to make them learn Ayurveda in the Sanskrit language. At that time, many Ayurvedic scholars from Bengal continued to teach Ayurveda by keeping students in their own homes and teaching them in their own Tol or Chatushpathi free of cost. Many landlords and kings have supported these activities.\n\nAnother challenge that came in the field of Ayurveda is the availability of Ayurvedic medicines. Initially, the imported, and later both imported and manufactured allopathic drugs ousted indigenous Ayurvedic medicines from the market. An onrush of allopathic drugs brought about a challenge to Ayurvedic medicines. This challenge was faced by the Ayurvedic physicians by establishing many Ayurvedic drug manufacturing units. The indigenous reaction to this challenge took two different paths. On one way, there was the regeneration of pure classical Ayurvedic medicines, some sort of revival of the past heritage. On the other way, there was acceptance of modern ingredients and modern methods, to cope with the need of time.[5]\n\nThe practice of Ayurveda in society, particularly in urban India faced another challenge. This challenge came when the British Government appointed British physicians and passed out allopathic physicians from the medical colleges in India as Health Officers. They were called Native Doctors. The Ayurvedic physicians faced this challenge successfully, they introduced the fixed consultation fee, which equalled or surpassed the fee of the contemporary British physicians practicing in Calcutta. At the same time, they treated the poor free of cost. They also introduced a fixed price list of Ayurvedic medicines and advertised the same in newspapers as was the norm for western medicine. All these timely initiations taken by the visionary leaders helped in successfully overcoming these challenges.\n\nKAVIRAJ GANGADHAR RAY THE GREAT SCHOLAR (1798–1885)\n\nKaviraj Gangadhar Ray [Figure 1] was a scholar, who along with his followers protected the traditional Indian system of medicine from the resurgent spread of the Allopathic system of medicine for more than a 100 years. He with his disciples and others like Kaviraja Gayadas Sen, Haran Chandra Chakraborty, Dwaraka Nath Sen, Shreecharan Sen, Jadunath Sen, Paresh Kaviraja, Gangaprasad Sen, Jogindranath Sen, and others, had practiced and popularised the Ayurvedic treatment in India during the 19th Century and prevented the massive invasion of allopathic system of medicine in India at that time.[6,7]\n\nHe was the scholar, who gave a new direction to Ayurveda in the changing situation of Ayurvedic education in colonial India. He had started a pharmacy and opened a dispensary in Calcutta. Later, he shifted to Murshidabad and started practicing and teaching Ayurveda. At that time, Murshidabad became a famous center of Ayurvedic education. He established Gangadhar Niketan, Chatushpathi for aspiring Vaidya (~Ayurveda Physician), who would wish to learn Ayurveda. Soon the institution became famous for training the best Ayurvedic physicians. He trained several disciples, who propagated Ayurveda in the country with their sound knowledge, dedication, and sincerity. Kaviraja Gayadas Sen, Kaviraja Haran Chandra Chakraborty, Kaviraja Dwarakanath Sen, Kaviraja Paresnath Sen (Kashi), Kaviraja Hariranjan Majumder (Delhi), Kaviraja Gnyanendranath Sen (Patna) were some of the renowned disciples. In 1868, Kaviraja Gangadhar used the Samvada Gnyanratnakara Press to print and publish Jalpa-Kalpataru, a detailed compendium on Charaka Samhita in Sanskrit. By then, his batches of brilliant students depicted their competence as they studied Sanskrit texts and practiced ancient traditional medicines.\n\nDISCIPLES OF KAVIRAJA GANGADHAR RAY\n\nKaviraja Gayadas Sen\n\nHe was the eldest and favorite among the disciples of Kaviraja Gangadhar Ray. He used to prepare the medicine as per the instructions of Kaviraja Gangadhar. His native place was Birbhum, the great soil of Acharya Chakrapani. He was a famous Nadi Vaidya. He could perfectly infer the prognosis of the disease by examining the pulse. He was invited by the then kings of Hetampur Estate, Birbhum District, and many landlords for treatment. Many patients from different parts of the country used to come to the little village of Birbhum to get relief from their ailments that was the popularity of Kaviraja Gayadas Sen. His son, Shitanath Sen was also a great physician.\n\nKaviraja Haranachandra Chakraborty\n\nHis native place was Rajshahi, presently in Bangladesh [Figure 2]. He was the direct disciple of Kaviraja Gangadhar Ray. He was a renowned physician at that time, he was infamous for the treatment of chronic and difficult diseases. He used to perform different types of surgeries. Specifically, he was an expert in ophthalmic surgeries. He had written “Sushrutartha Sandipani,” the famous commentary on Sushruta Samhita.\n\nKaviraja Dwarakanath Sen (1843–1909)\n\nHe was one of the leading physicians in India at that time [Figure 3]. He was born in Faridpur, Bengal in 1843. He started his dispensary in Calcutta in 1875, and within a short period, he became a great physician. His patients came not only from Bengal but also from different parts of the country. He further continued teaching to many disciples in his dispensary. Umacharan Kaviraja of Kashi, Swami Lakshmiram of Jaipur, and his elder son Kaviraja Jogindranath Sen are a few eminent scholars who were trained by Kaviraj Dwarkanath Sen. He was crowned by the title “Mahamahopadhyaya” by the Government and he was the first to get be honored by such unique adjudication.\n\nOTHER PROMINENT AYURVEDIC SCHOLARS OF BENGAL\n\nKaviraja Gangaprasad Sen (1824–1896)\n\nThe name and fame of Kaviraja Gangaprasad Sen were spread far and wide and patients used to come to him in hordes. His father Nilambar Sen was also a renowned physician whose medicines were so potent that limericks were written praising him. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa often praised Kaviraja Gangaprasad as the doctor with a Midas’ touch. He probably was the first person to export Ayurvedic medicine to Europe and America. He introduced the fixed consultation fee, which equalled or surpassed the fee of the contemporary British physicians practicing in Calcutta. In the same way, he introduced a fixed price list of Ayurvedic medicines and advertised the same in newspapers as was the norm for western medicine. He was the first to publish an Ayurvedic journal in Bengali named Ayurveda Sanjivini for upholding the stature of Ayurvedic medicine [Figure 4]. He established a Tol system to educate physicians in his home, where students were provided free room and boarding along with free coaching of Ayurveda.\n\nKaviraja Bijayratna Sen (1858–1911)\n\nHe took birth in a Kaviraja family in Bikrampur, Bengal, in 1858 [Figure 5]. He learned Ayurveda from his maternal uncle, Kaviraja Gangaprasad Sen. Later on, he trained in Shalyakarma from Kaviraja Kaliprasad Sen. His name as a physician flourished in India as well as abroad. Many of the then-government officials were his patients. He inspired and made them attracted towards Ayurveda. He published a Sanskrit commentary of Ashtanga Hridaya. He contributed a lot for the establishment of Astanga Ayurved College in Calcutta. He also prepared a bunch of pupils including Kaviraja Jamini Bhushan Ray, Kaviraja Bidhubhushan Sen (of Patna), Kaviraja Birjacharan Gupta (author of Banaushadhi Darpan). These were some of the many noteworthy.\n\nKaviraja Chandrakishore Sen\n\nIn 1878, Chandrakishore Sen, a Kaviraja of the traditional Srikhanda School and a junior contemporary of Kaviraja Gangadhara Ray, opened a dispensary in Calcutta with the idea of selling prepared medicines at cheaper rates. Moreover, in 1898, success in this direction led him to undertake large-scale production by shifting the dispensary to Kalutola. He was inspired to undertake large-scale production by the pharmaceutical concern founded in 1884, to manufacture and sell Ayurvedic drugs. The Company was named as C. K. Sen and Co. Private Limited, Calcutta. Similar efforts were made to commercialize Ayurvedic drugs. In addition, he published inexpensive books to propagate the knowledge of Ayurveda and to highlight its scientific essentials.\n\nKaviraja Jogindranath Sen (1871–1918)\n\nHe was the son of Kaviaraja Dwarkanath Sen and a great scholar of Ayurveda from Bengal school [Figure 6]. He learned Ayurveda from Sanskrit College and Calcutta Medical College. He started his journey as a Royal Physician of Nepal. For easy understanding of Charaka Samhita, he wrote Charakaposkara commentary on Charaka Samhita. He was a famous teacher of Ayurveda and made many scholars like Jotish Chandra Chakraborty, C. Dwaraknath, and others. He headed Ayurveda Mahasammelana four times. Acknowledging his achievement and contributions, he had crowned as Vaidyaratna in 1916.\n\nKaviraja Jamini Bhushan Ray (1879–1925)\n\nBorn in Khulna, Bengal in 1879 [Figure 7]. His father, Kaviraja Panchanan Ray was a Prolific Sanskrit Scholar and an Ayurvedic physician at Bhwonipur, Calcutta. Kaviraja Jamini Bhushan Ray did MB course from Calcutta Medical College and took MA degree in Sanskrit. He got primary lessons of Ayurveda from his father. Later, he learnt Ayurveda from Kaviraja Bijayratna Sen. He decided to practice Ayurveda and established Baidyaraj Pharmacy and dispensary in Calcutta. He became well known for his treatment approaches across the country. However, his main goal was to establish an Ayurveda college in Calcutta to fulfill the wish of his mentor, Kaviraja Bijayratna Sen. In the year 1916, he established Ashtanga Ayurved College in Calcutta. He was the first principal of the college. Mahatma Gandhi laid down the foundation stone of the new hospital building of this college on 5th May 1925. He wrote many books like Shalakyatantra, Prasutitantra, Vishatantra, and others. He had donated all his properties for the foundation of Ashtanga Ayurved College.\n\nKaviraja Shyamadas Bachaspati (1876–1934)\n\nHe was from a Kaviraja family of Chupigram, Burdwan District, Bengal [Figure 8]. His father Kaviraja Jagannath Prasad Das was a popular Ayurvedic physician. He took primary Sanskrit lessons from his father, later went to Kashi, and learnt Ayurveda from the famous Paresh Kaviraja. He came to Calcutta and started Ayurveda practice with Kaviraja Dwarakanath Sen. Later, he started his own dispensary. He used to teach students in his dispensary. From all over the country, students used to come to him for learning Ayurveda. Kaviraja Bijaykali Bhattacharya and Kaviraja Ramchandra Mallik were some of the famous students. He established Vidyashastra Peeth on the request of the great freedom fighter Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das in the year 1921. The institute was later renamed as Shyamadas Vaidya Shastra Peeth and is now running as the Institute of Post-Graduate Ayurvedic Education and Research.\n\nKaviraja Gananath Sen (1877–1944)\n\nHe was born in Varanasi [Figure 9]. He belonged to a family of Ayurveda physicians. His father Kaviraja Bishwanath Sen was a popular Ayurvedic physician. He took a degree in modern medicine. Later, he learnt Ayurveda from Kaviraja Jaynarayan Gupta. He started his Ayurvedic dispensary at Sutanuti, Calcutta. He was an Ayurvedic physician with a modern mind. He started an Ayurvedic pharmacy, Kalpataru Ayurvedic Works at Jorasanko, Calcutta, where Ayurvedic medicines were manufactured in tablet, capsule, and syrup forms, with attractive labeling and packaging. Those attempts were the first of its kind in India for Ayurveda. He established Biswanath Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya and Hospital in the memory of his father in 1932. Students were coming not only from India but also from abroad to learn Ayurveda from him. He wrote many books like Pratyaksha Shariram, Siddhanta Nidanam, and Ayurveda Samhita. He played an influential role in popularizing Ayurveda in the early 20th century.\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nThere was a scarcity of Ayurvedic texts during the 18th and 19th centuries. Many Ayurvedic texts were destroyed by the Muslim rulers, many texts were missing due to lack of preservation, and many texts were unavailable due to lack of publication. For that reason, the scholars from Bengal thought to publish the ancient Ayurvedic texts, write a commentary on Vrihadtrayi, and write Ayurvedic books in Sanskrit, Bengali, and even in English languages. These efforts helped to overcome the lack of Ayurvedic texts and to understand Ayurveda better [Table 1].[8]\n\nAYURVEDIC EDUCATION IN BENGAL\n\nThe Ayurvedic education was then continued as Guru-Shishya school. It faced the toughest hurdle after the establishment of the English Education Act in the year 1835. All the funds were blocked, publications were stopped, and systematic education was abolished. At that time, the great Ayurvedic scholars tried to continue Ayurvedic education. They arranged teaching facilities for the willing students at their own residence. Those arrangements were called “Tol” or “Chatuspathi.” The teaching, lodging, and food for the students were completely free. Some interested landlords had extended support to the Ayurvedic scholars to run those schools. In those schools (Tol), Ayurvedic education was alive until the establishment of Ayurvedic teaching institutes in 1916. This type of schools were present all over Bengal, especially in Murshidabad, Calcutta, Birbhum, Burdwan, Dhaka, Bikrampur, Rajshahi, and Nabadwip. The Calcutta Review reported in 1842 that in Calcutta, the number of Tol was 190. In each Tol, there were about 15 students. The age of students was between 16 and 24 years.[9] Apart from these Tol, Ayurveda was also taught in the Ayurvedic dispensaries. The Ayurvedic Aushadhalaya played an important role in the propagation of Ayurvedic knowledge to the disciples.\n\nAn attempt was taken in 1823 for systematic education of Indigenous systems of medicine in India (Ayurveda and Unani). The indigenous systems of medicine course of 2 years duration were started in the Government Sanskrit College in 1827 in Calcutta. The Government Sanskrit College was established in 1824. However, in the year 1833, the classes of Indigenous systems of medicine in the Sanskrit College were abolished.[2] At the same time, a “Baidya Samaj” (Physician’s society) was established in 1831 by Kaviraja Kshudiram Bisharad to help the Kaviraja to get acquainted with Ayurvedic drugs and properties of many plants and herbs used in the preparation of Ayurvedic medicine.[10] The first Ayurvedic college, the Calcutta Ayurvedic Institution and Pharmacy was established in 1905, by Surendra Nath Goswami.\n\nJ. B. Roy State Ayurvedic Medical College and Hospital\n\nKaviraja Jamini Bhushan Roy established Ashtanga Ayurveda Vidyalaya on February 10, 1916. The institute was first started in a rented house at 29, Fariapukur Road, Shyambazar, Calcutta. Kaviraja Jamini Bhushan Roy was the first principal of this institute and Kaviraja Birajacharan Gupta was the Vice-Principal. The institute started with only 18 students. However, in a very short period, the institute gained popularity. In the year 1922, the institute had students from various parts of India such as Delhi, Bombay, Lahore, Madras, Kashmir, Travancore, and others. The institute even got students from Nepal and Sri Lanka. The institute was registered under Society Act on March 5, 1919. Later in 1925, the institute was shifted to its present address, 170–172, Raja Dinendra Street, Shyambazar, Calcutta. The founding stone for the new building was laid by Mahatma Gandhi on May 6, 1925. For this reason, the institute is still known as Gandhi Hospital amongst the local people. Kaviraja Jamini Bhushan Roy died in 1926 at the age of 47 years. In the year 1940, the institute was renamed Jamini Bhushan Ashtanga Ayurveda Vidyalaya O Ayurvediya Arogyashala. Later the institute became familiar as J. B. Roy State Ayurvedic Medical College and Hospital, which is the oldest existing Ayurvedic institute in India.\n\nShyamadas Vaidyashastra Peeth\n\nDuring the period of the noncooperation movement, Kaviraja Shyamadas Bachaspati, an eminent Ayurvedic physician of his time established Vaidyashastra Peeth at Farbes Manson, Wallington Square, Calcutta, on request of the famous freedom fighter Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das in the year 1921. Later, the institute was shifted to 68, Balaram Dey Street, Calcutta; and the classes were started on July 1, 1921. Every year, 20 students from different parts of the country took admission to this institute. Kaviraja Shyamadas Bachaspati was the first principal of this institute. He donated Rs. 200,000/- for a permanent building of this institute. The institute was again shifted to Vivekananda Road, Calcutta in 1933. A six bedded hospital was also started here. Later, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Sarat Chandra Bose arranged land at 294/3/1, Upper Circular Road, Calcutta, from Calcutta Municipality for the permanent building of this institute. Kaviraja Shyamadas Bachaspati died in the year 1934; after that, Kaviraja Bimalananda Tarkatirtha, son of Kaviraja Shyamadas Bachaspati took the charge of this institute. The institute was renamed as Shyamadas Vaidyashastra Peeth Parishad. Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya Bahadur, Maharaja of Tripura, laid down the foundation stone of the building at the present address. A three-storied building was established, and a 75-bedded hospital was started in 1935. The pharmacy of this institute “Nagarjuna Rasashala” was inaugurated by Shri Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan in 1939. The present name of this institute is the Institute of Post-Graduate Ayurvedic Education and Research at Shyamadas Vaidyashastra Peeth. This is the only postgraduate Ayurvedic institute in West Bengal.\n\nIn addition, a national university of Bengal, Gaudiya Sarvavidyayatana, was established in 1921 as part of the noncooperation movement, with an Ayurvedic medical wing.[2]\n\nGobinda Sundari Ayurveda College and Hospital\n\nThis Ayurvedic institute was established in the year 1929 at 20, Ramkanta Bose Lane, Baghbazar, Calcutta. Maharaj Manindra Chandra Nandi, Maharaja of Cossimbazar, founded this institute in tribute to her mother Gobinda Sundari. Kaviraja Ramchandra Mallik was the principal of this institute. The institute was shifted to 16/2, Ramkanta Bose Lane, in a big building. A 60-bedded indoor department was started in 1940. It had specialization in Kayachikitsa, Shalyatantra, Shalakyatantra, and Prasutitantra departments. Students were coming from the various parts of India such as Tejpur, Patna, Puri, Rajshahi, and others. The institute had its own pharmacy. Ayurvedic medicines were prepared in this pharmacy. The institute was closed in the year 1942 due to a lack of funds and financial support.\n\nBishwanath Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya and Hospital\n\nThis institute was established by Kaviraja Gananath Sen in memory of his father Kaviraja Bishwanath Sen, on July 10, 1932.

Mr. Chakraborty had started an Ayurvedic institute (Tol) attached to this manufacturing unit to popularize Ayurvedic knowledge. Ayurveda and Philosophy were taught in Sanskrit, and students were offered free tuition, boarding, and lodging. This company is still running in Bangladesh as a Government undertaking with 37 branches all over the country.\n\nSadhana Aushadhalaya\n\nIt was established in the year 1914 at 21, Dinanath Sen Road, Gandaria, Dhaka by Jogesh Chandra Ghosh. He graduated from Coochbehar College in Chemistry; took a master’s degree in chemistry from Calcutta University; he was a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry and the American Chemical Society. He was a professor of chemistry at Bhagalpur College and Jagannath College, Dhaka. He was a pupil of Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray and was motivated by the works of Mr. Ray. He was attracted to Ayurveda and established this unit to use the indigenous heritage and knowledge. Once this Pharmacy manufactured 450 types of Ayurvedic medicines. It became popular in a very short period and had branches all over British India. Mritasanjivani and Mahadraksharishta were two popular preparations. The company had a total of 68 branches. It had distributing agencies in different countries, even in China, North America, and Africa.[14]\n\nKalpataru Ayurvedic works\n\nIt was established by Mahamohapadhyay Gananath Sen in 1914 at Jorasanko, Calcutta, at a cost of Rs. 10,000/-. Ayurvedic medicines were manufactured in tablet, capsule, and syrup forms, with attractive labeling and packaging. Improved scientific methods of manufacturing and sophisticated machineries were adopted for a better quality of products.

Chyavanprasha and Makaradwaja were two notable products of this company.[12]\n\nShree Baidyanath Ayurved Bhawan Privet Limited\n\nKaviraja Ramdayal Joshi established this famous Ayurvedic medicines manufacturing unit in Calcutta in the year 1917. Kaviraja Joshi had gathered several Kaviraja, the group of Kaviraja was involved in the manufacturing of medicines and running of dispensaries. The company initially prepared both classical as well as proprietary medicines. Kabjhar, Surakta, Memori, Jakamo, and others were some of the famous proprietary Ayurvedic formulations. At present, it is one of the leading Ayurvedic medicines manufacturing units in India.\n\nDhaka Ayurvedic pharmacy\n\nIt was established in Dhaka in the year 1919. It was run by some famous Kaviraja of Dhaka. It became a public company in 1920. Many Ayurveda-lover landlords invested money in the development of this company. The initial investment of this company was Rs. 20,000/-. In the year 1931, the company had more than 200 branches all over India; and the capital increased to Rs. 500,000/-. Mritasanjibani Sudha, Makaradwaja, Chwavanprasha, Ashokarishta, and Jwarakeshari Rasa were some of the popular medicines of this company.\n\nGour Nitai Ayurved Aushadhalaya\n\nIt was founded by Shri Gournitai Saha at Barabazar, Dacca in 1919. The company prepared both classical as well as proprietary Ayurvedic medicines. Gourkanti salsa, Gournetai modak, Krimikulantaka batika, Shwashari batika, Sarvajwaragajasimha, Sarvadadruhutashana, Kandudavanala were some of the popular proprietary medicines of this company.\n\nAyurved Mahamandal Company Limited\n\nThe then Ayurvedic manufacturing units were small in size and capacity, and the outrun was also meager. The need of that time was to establish a unit with more capital, extend business and maximize production. With these views, this Ayurvedic company was established at 19, Grey Street, Calcutta in 1919 with an authorized capital of Rs. 50,000/-. It was run by a Board of Directors headed by S. N. Basu, Upendra Kumar Mitra, Satis Chandra Ghosh, Jogindralal Raychaudhary, and Nalini Chandra Saha. The medicines were prepared under the supervision of Kaviraj Surendranath Dasgupta and Kaviraj Jogindranath Shastri. A large variety of Ayurvedic medicines were prepared through ancient Ayurvedic methods, viz., Biswanath taila, Sonitamrita salsa, Chandanprabhasava, and others.\n\nThe Ayurvedic medicines manufactured in these manufacturing units were very popular in society and were qualitatively very good. At that time, these Ayurvedic medicines competed with allopathic medicines in the market. For example, Haran’s Rativijaya modaka and Mayapur’s Mayapur Rasayana, meant for the treatment of debility and impotence, competed with Smith Stanistreet’s Hornby’s No. 9 Pills; Ayurved Mahamandal Sonitamrita salsa, or Avinash’s Amritadi kashaya, with Seigel’s Syrup; and Mritunjay Halder’s Swadeshi Quinine with imported quinines.[12]\n\nMany Ayurvedic preparations were then adopted by the allopathic system. At the beginning of the 20th century, many allopathic medicines were available in the market, which were taken from the Ayurvedic system and introduced into the allopathic system. For example, Oil Chalmogra, which was an Ayurvedic preparation for the treatment of skin diseases, was taken up by the allopathic chemists; Kurchi (Holarrhenapubescens Wall. ex G. Don) bark was used by the Ayurvedic physicians for the treatment of amoebic dysentery, had been included in the allopathic system by the name Kurchivine extract, Kurchi Liquidum; Bael (Aeglemarmelos (L.) Corrêa) was also included in the allopathic pharmacopoeia as Extract Baelae Liquid, Isoquino Bael.[12]\n\nRESEARCH WORKS\n\nKaviraja Mritunjay Halder of Kotwali, Malda District, invented Swadeshi quinine for the treatment of Malaria from indigenous medicinal plants. The action of this medicine was “in no way inferior to foreign quinine.” At that time, this medicine was displayed in the exhibitions held at Malda and Murshidabad and was highly appreciated for its intrinsic merit.[12]\n\nThere started a difference of opinion between Ayurvedic and European physicians regarding the use of quinine in case of fever. Ayurvedic practitioners complained about the enlargement of the liver with prolonged use of quinine which was the mode of treatment for any kind of fever by western medical professionals. Bengali Ayurvedic magazine “Anubikshan” commented, “European physicians are using large doses of quinine and other European medicines for our ailments; that may have been beneficial for that moment but in the long run, destroy our health.”[15]\n\nKaviraja Gananath Sen prepared injectable, aerosol, and rectal preparations from Indian medicinal plants. He had conducted clinical trials of those preparations and reported significant results of those trials.[16]\n\nMEDICINAL PLANTS TRADING\n\nMedicinal plant trading existed earlier, but in the 19th century, this business had been given a new shape by Taraknath Sadhu. He had his centre for medicinal plants business at Barabazar, Calcutta. He had employed 15–16 persons for this business. He had collected medicinal plants from many sources even from distant areas. He used to supply medicinal plants to the Ayurvedic Aushadhalaya and the Ayurvedic physicians. This business was very profitable and this centre was a profitable concern throughout the 19th century.[12]\n\nFIGHT FOR EXISTENCE\n\nThe fight for the existence of Ayurvedic knowledge against British aggression for propagating western culture and allopathic medicine started under the leadership of Kaviraja Gangadhar Ray. Kaviraja Gangaprasad Sen and his students openly challenged Macauley’s theory of introducing English and wiping out Sanskrit or other indigenous languages. They defied the British and under Gangadhar’s leadership, set up traditional Ayurvedic treatment centres.\n\nIn 1868, Kaviraja Gangadhar used the Samvada Gnyanratnakara Press to print and publish Jalpa-Kalpataru, a detailed Sanskrit commentary Charaka Samhita. By then, his batches of brilliant students depicted their competence as they studied Sanskrit texts and practiced ancient traditional Ayurvedic medicines. The areas around Pathuriaghata and Kumortuli in Calcutta became the places for Ayurveda medicine practice.[17]\n\nCONTRIBUTION IN FREEDOM FIGHT\n\nThe then-Ayurvedic scholars of Bengal also contributed directly to the freedom fight. Kaviraja Gangaprasad Sen became a supporter of the Swadeshi movement and gave rupees one lakh to bail out Yogesh Chandra Basu, editor of Bangabasi, who was arrested for writing and propagating anti-establishment ideas.[17]\n\nSUMMARY\n\nKaviraja Gangadhar Ray and Kaviraja Gangaprasad Sen may be considered as harbingers of the Ayurvedic Renaissance in India. If Kaviraja Gangadhar is considered as the Father of Ayurvedic education in modern India; then Kaviraja Gangaprasad should be considered as the Father of Ayurvedic practice in modern India.\n\nDuring their initial years, the European doctors had to take help from the local Kaviraja to understand the diagnosis and treatments for diseases that were not in the least familiar to them. This was the late 18th century, and Calcutta was fast becoming a hub for settlements and trading activities. Open drains, marshy lands, mosquito-borne fevers, and the general lack of initiatives in the field of public health issues soon gave rise to an exorbitant mortality rate. Herein, European doctors cashed in the fear of diseases and started treating the rich and the elite for an expensive fee of one gold coin per visit. Soon, western medicine started picking up in popularity among the elite and the Kaviraja were often held guilty of deaths caused by administering Ayurvedic potions. The colonial government held the opinion that western medicine was more scientific and sophisticated. The Ayurveda Renaissance changed the course of this school of thought. Kaviraja Gangadhar, Kaviraja Gangaprasad, and their students elevated Ayurvedic medicines to the same stature as allopathic medicine and attracted public interest to it in a way that brought back faith to the age-old science of Ayurveda. Kaviraja Dwarakanath, Kaviraja Bijoyratna and others continued the works of their teachers in popularizing Ayurveda and encouraged the cooperation of traditional and western medical system.\n\nThe Ayurvedic scholars of Bengal had spread and popularised Ayurveda all over the country, especially in North India. Students from all over India used to come to the Ayurveda Guru in Bengal for learning Ayurveda. The disciples of Kaviraja Gangadhar Ray established themselves in different parts of the country and started their dispensaries. Gradually, Ayurveda became popular in those places. The Kashi school of Ayurveda had been developed by the leadership of Kaviraja Pareshnath Sen (Paresh Kaviraja), one direct disciple of Kaviraja Gangadhar. Later, his nephew Kaviraja Dharmadas and his disciples Pandit Satyanarayan Shastri, Pandit Rajeshwardatta Shastri, and others got the flag and bore it successfully. Kaviraja Hariranjan Majumder disciple of Kaviraja Gangadhar, Kaviraja Umacharan Bhattacharya pupil of Kaviraja Dwarakanath, and others established Ayurveda School in Delhi. Kaviraja Ganendranath Sen, a disciple of Kaviraja Dwarakanath developed an Ayurveda school in Haridwar. Swami Lakshmiram and Swami Jayramdas, disciples of Kaviraja Dwarakanath established an Ayurveda school in Jaipur.[6] These are some examples. Many other scholars learned Ayurveda from the Ayurveda Guru of Bengal and established themselves in different parts of the country, and protected and popularised Ayurveda in colonial India.\n\nThe diminished Ayurvedic education and practice got momentum during the Swadeshi movement in 1905.[15] The time was to refuse foreign products and support the use of indigenous goods. The renowned leaders appealed to the people for using indigenous products manufactured in India and preferred refusing foreign goods. Leaders like Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das wanted to bring the past glory of Ayurveda. He approached Kaviraja Shyamadas Vachaspati to establish an Ayurvedic institute for rendering pure Ayurvedic knowledge to the students. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose arranged land for that institute on behalf of Calcutta Municipality. As a result of this movement, Shyamadas Vidyashastra Peeth was established.\n\nAyurvedic physicians in Calcutta charged high fees from rich Bengalis and Europeans. Some physicians had their pharmacy. Once during the 19th century, Ayurvedic physicians were rich and renowned personalities in society. Some of the Ayurvedic physicians were amongst the richest in Bengal at that time. Chandrakishore Sen and Co., Nagendranath Sen and Co., Binodlal Sen and Co., and some of the Ayurvedic physicians at Kumartuli were counted amongst the richest in Calcutta.[15] But at the same time, they opened and ran charitable dispensaries for the poor. They established Chatushpathi or Tol for free lodging, boarding, and learning for the students. Their motto was to conserve and popularise the Ayurvedic system of medicine.\n\nThere were three main centers of Ayurveda practice in Bengal during the 19th century, i.e., Murshidabad, Calcutta, and Dhaka. The Murshidabad center was funded by the then Nawab of Murshidabad. The prominent scholar of this center was Kaviraja Gangadhar Ray. Students from all over India came to Murshidabad for learning Ayurveda from Kaviraja Gangadhar. Later Calcutta became the main centre, due to the development of Calcutta as the capital city and main business point of India. Many scholars like Kaviraja Gangaprasad Sen, Kaviraja Dwarakanath Sen, and others practiced Ayurveda with glory and took Ayurveda to a new high. At the same time, another center was developed in Dhaka. Kaviraja Nilambar Sen, father of Kaviraja Gangaprasad Sen was a renowned Ayurvedic physician of Dhaka. Savar region of Dhaka became famous for Ayurvedic treatment. Dhananjay Kaviraja, Kaviraja Gurucharan Dutta, and Kaviraja Rakhal Chandra Dutta were some of the great scholars from Savar, Dhaka.[18]\n\nThere was a rich heritage of Ayurveda in Bengal even in colonial India. The Ayurvedic physicians in Bengal practiced the science in the society, protected the great science from British aggression, and prepared many followers to popularise the Ayurvedic system of medicine. Even today, Gangaprasad’s house at 5, Kumartuli, stands as a testimony of the glorious past. Close by lies Bijayratna Bhavan in a dilapidated state, with the title of ‘Mahamahopadhyay’ peeping from the nameplate near the entrance [Figure 10]. This nameplate is a testimony of erstwhile Bengal’s defiance against Macauley’s propaganda who thought Indian vernacular languages were inadequate in providing modern higher education.[17]\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe British invasion of India affected Indian heritage, culture, and knowledge badly. The indigenous medical science, Ayurveda did not get relief from that invasion. In colonial India, The Ayurvedic system of medicine was affected at worst. The Ayurvedic scholars, however, demoralized, never lost hope. The Ayurvedic scholars especially from Bengal lead from the front for the protection of traditional Ayurvedic knowledge in Colonial India. They protected the science, practiced it, and popularized it in its form. They also prepared the next generations for carrying the legacy. A renaissance had been initiated in the entire Bengal for flourishing the most ancient and glorious Ayurvedic medical system. Kaviraja Gangadhar Ray and Kaviraja Gangaprasad Sen were considered as a pioneer of that renaissance. They not only protected Ayurvedic knowledge from British aggression but also propagated the knowledge throughout the country. Their fight was not less in a true sense than freedom fighting.\n\nThe misery for Ayurveda started with the establishment of the English Education Act in 1835 and continued until the foundation of the Ayurvedic institutes during the early 20th century. During this period, the Ayurvedic scholars from Bengal were continuing the flow of Ayurveda by practicing the science in their dispensaries, preserving the knowledge by publishing and writing Ayurvedic texts, and propagating it by teaching to the students. Later on, the students spread all over the country, establishing themselves and popularizing Ayurveda across the country. This is the time to pay tribute to all such great Ayurveda scholars from Bengal for holding the legacy high during the colonial India period.\n\nFinancial support and sponsorship\n\nNil.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest."
