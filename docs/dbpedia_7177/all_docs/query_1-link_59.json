        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe volume deals with the philosophy of the Bhagavata Purana, the philosophy of Madhva and his followers, the philosophy of Vallabha and the philosophy of the Gaudiya school of Vaisnavism.\n\nOf the controversy between the monists of the Sankara School and the dualists of the Madhva School, most people are ignorant of the Madhva side of the case, though there are many who may be familiar with the monistic point of view. It is hoped that the treatment of the philosophy of Madhva and his followers undertaken in this volumen will give new light to students of Indian philosophy and will present many new aspects of dialectical logic hitherto undiscovered in Indian thought.\n\nThe treatment of the philosophy of Vallabha, which is called visuddhavaita or pure monism, presents a new aspect of monism and also gives us a philosophical analysis of the emotion of devotion.\n\nAs regards the position of God and His relation to the world the outlook of the Bhagavata-purana is rather ambiguous. The Bhagavata-purana has therefore been referred to for support by the Madhvas, Vallahas and thinkers of the Gaudiya School. The Gaudiya School seems to make the Bhagavata-purana the fundamental source of its inspiration.\n\nLate Dr. Surendranath Dasgupta, C.I.E., I.E.S., Ph.D. (Cal.et Cantab.), D. Litt. (Hony., Rome) was the Principal at Government Sanskrit College, Calcutta and King George V. Prof. Of Mental and Moral Science, at the Calcutta University. He represented Cambridge University at the Congress of Philosophy in Paris in 1921 and the Calcutta University at the International Congress of Philosophy at Naples in 1924 and at Harvard in 1926. He represented India at the International Congress of Religion in London in 1936 and in Paris in 1939. Among his several other works may be mentioned: A Study of Patanjali, Yoga Philosophy in Relation to Other Systems of Indian Thoughts, Yoga as Philosophy and Religion, Hindu Mysticism, Indian Idealism, Philosophical Essays, A History of Sanskrit Literature and Religion and Rational Outlook."
