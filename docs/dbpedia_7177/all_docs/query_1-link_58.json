        "text": "Yoga\n\nBy Mircea Eliade, Willard R. Trask (translator),\n\nFrom my list on yoga philosophy and psychology.\n\nBy Stephen H. Phillips Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs a professional sanskritist and academic, I have travelled to India well more than twenty times, for fellowships, conferences, and (fortunately) months of study with a traditional Sanskrit pundit, the great N.S. Ramanuja Tatacharya. But my first trip was when I was twenty, dropping out of college and travelling from a kibbutz in Israel to India (overland no less, after a flight from Tel Aviv to Istanbul in 1971) where I was graciously admitted into a yoga-ashram school. There I began learning Sanskrit as well as various yoga techniques. I stayed that time for two years. “All life is yoga,” says Sri Aurobindo, and I have long wished my life to be that since “yoga” is for me practically a synonym for “right living.”\n\nStephen's book list on yoga philosophy and psychology\n\nWhy did Stephen love this book?\n\nThis book provides a historical overview of yoga philosophy and psychology and is a great introduction to the study of yoga. It was originally written in French by Mircea Eliade, who became the dean of Religious Studies all over the world, for decades training graduate students at the University of Chicago. The book is now a little dated on certain topics such as tantra and the yogic practices of Buddhism. Nevertheless, it stands as the preëminent classic in the field of yoga studies. It has a bouncy but elegant style and has been a favorite in the courses I have taught on yoga at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nWhile a student in India in his early twenties, Eliade had an affair with the daughter of his Sanskrit teacher, the renowned and august scholar, Surendranath Dasgupta. There is apparently a novel by Eliade in Romanian about this and another…\n\nBy Mircea Eliade, Willard R. Trask (translator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Yoga as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn this landmark book, first published in English in 1958, renowned scholar of religion Mircea Eliade lays the groundwork for a Western understanding of Yoga. Drawing on years of study and experience in India, Eliade provides a comprehensive survey of Yoga in theory and practice from its earliest antecedents in the Vedas through the twentieth century. A new introduction by David Gordon White provides invaluable insight into Eliade's life and work, highlighting the key moments in Eliade's academic and spiritual education, as well as the personal experiences that shaped his worldview. Yoga is not only one of Eliade's most important…\n\nPreview\n\nYoga Sutra of Patanjali\n\nBy Patanjali,\n\nFrom my list on yoga philosophy and psychology.\n\nBy Stephen H. Phillips Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs a professional sanskritist and academic, I have travelled to India well more than twenty times, for fellowships, conferences, and (fortunately) months of study with a traditional Sanskrit pundit, the great N.S.

The most scholarly: Michel Angot, Le Yoga-Sūtra de Patañjali, le Yoga-Bhāṣya de Vyāsa (about 800 pages with footnotes citing tons of contemporary and classical literature—the references in the footnotes are mainly to works in English though the translation is in French). Some say the classical commentary by Vyāsa is essential; others disagree.\n\nThe Yoga-sūtra, which borrows much from the Gītā practice-wise but endorses a different view of reality, is the second great classic of yoga philosophy and psychology. In large part, it is a “how-to” book, but there is also much philosophy and psychology. It outlines presumed results called “siddhis” for specific practices such as an “Eight-limbed Yoga” it popularizes: (1) yama, “ethical…\n\nBy Patanjali,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Yoga Sutra of Patanjali as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are in themselves exceedingly brief, less than ten pages of large type in the original. Yet they contain the essence of practical wisdom, set forth in admirable order and detail. The theme, if the present interpreter be right, is the great regeneration, the birth of the spiritual from the psychical man: the same theme which Paul so wisely and eloquently set forth in writing to his disciples in Corinth, the theme of all mystics in all lands.\n\nPreview\n\nAsana Pranayama Mudra Bandha\n\nBy Swami Satyananda Saraswati,\n\nFrom my list on yoga philosophy and psychology.\n\nBy Stephen H. Phillips Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs a professional sanskritist and academic, I have travelled to India well more than twenty times, for fellowships, conferences, and (fortunately) months of study with a traditional Sanskrit pundit, the great N.S. Ramanuja Tatacharya. But my first trip was when I was twenty, dropping out of college and travelling from a kibbutz in Israel to India (overland no less, after a flight from Tel Aviv to Istanbul in 1971) where I was graciously admitted into a yoga-ashram school. There I began learning Sanskrit as well as various yoga techniques. I stayed that time for two years. “All life is yoga,” says Sri Aurobindo, and I have long wished my life to be that since “yoga” is for me practically a synonym for “right living.”\n\nStephen's book list on yoga philosophy and psychology\n\nWhy did Stephen love this book?\n\nThis is a premier practice manual, compiled from lectures given for a seven-month course of yoga-teacher training by the great swami who is an excellent writer as well as a beautiful person. In the US, the rival manual, Light on Yoga, by B.K.S. Iyengar may be more popular, and both authors have several more wide-ranging books, Swami Satyananda with the large and long A Systematic Course in the Ancient Tantric Techniques of Yoga and Kriya and the autobiographical Taming the Kundalini among other books mainly in Hindi, Iyengar with The Tree of Yoga, Light on Pranayama, Light on Life, and others.\n\nBy Swami Satyananda Saraswati,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAsana Prana Yama Mudra Bandha is recognised internationally as one of the most systematic yoga manuals today. Since it's first publication by the Bihar School of yoga in 1969 it has been reprinted seventeen times and translated into many languages. It is the main reference text used by Yoga teachers and students of Bihar Yoga/Satyananda Yoga within the International Yoga Movement, and many other traditions as well. This comprehensive text provides clear illustrations. step by step directions and details of chakra awareness. It guides the practitioner or teacher from the simplest to the most advanced practices of hatha yoga system.…\n\nPreview\n\nThoughts and Aphorisms\n\nBy Sri Aurobindo,\n\nFrom my list on yoga philosophy and psychology.\n\nBy Stephen H.

It was first published in 1914-1920 in a journal of “yoga and speculative philosophy.” Along with Swami Vivekananda (who brought Vedānta to the West, according to a prominent statue and inscription at India Gate at the port of Mumbai), Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who was president of India in the nineteen-fifties, and the revolutionary Mahatma Gandhi, the master yogi Sri Aurobindo is a leading philosopher of “neo-Vedānta” in the modern era and beyond a doubt the most original. Neo-Vedānta draws on ideas of the Upanishads and the Gītā to attempt a modern spiritual worldview.\n\nAurobindo’s philosophic magnum opus, The Life Divine, is long and complex, a difficult read. But Thoughts and Aphorisms, about a hundred small pages, is easy, the brief statements delightful, little yoga wisdom poems in prose. The aphorisms are arranged…\n\nBy Sri Aurobindo,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Thoughts and Aphorisms as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nProfound Thoughts and Aphorisms on the paths of Knowledge, Works and Devotion. Truths expressed in succinct sentences for contemplation and meditation.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Yoga Sutras of Patañjali\n\nBy Edwin F. Bryant,\n\nFrom my list on the truth of yoga.\n\nBy Daniel Simpson Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI've been studying yoga in various forms since my first trip to India in the 1990s. I began as a curious tourist, attending the world's biggest human gathering (the Kumbh Mela). After working as a foreign correspondent—initially for Reuters then The New York Times—I returned to university, earning a master's degree in Traditions of Yoga and Meditation. I've since taught courses at the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies, on yoga teacher trainings, and via my website. The Truth of Yoga is the book I wish I'd found when I started exploring.\n\nDaniel's book list on the truth of yoga\n\nWhy did Daniel love this book?\n\nThe most insightful guide to the best-known text about yoga philosophy. Among other things, it explains why yoga isn't all about \"eight limbs\", since the main technique is one-pointed focus and physical contortions are later inventions. Patañjali’s pithy one-liners are hard to interpret without more context. Instead of filling in the gaps to fit modern assumptions, Bryant draws on traditional commentaries to clarify meanings.\n\nBy Edwin F. Bryant,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWritten almost two millennia ago, Patanjali's work focuses on how to attain the direct experience and realization of the purusa: the innermost individual self, or soul. As the classical treatise on the Hindu understanding of mind and consciousness and on the technique of meditation, it has exerted immense influence over the religious practices of Hinduism in India and, more recently, in the West. Edwin F. Bryant's translation is clear, direct, and exact. Each sutra is presented as Sanskrit text, transliteration, and precise English translation, and is followed by Bryant's authoritative commentary, which is grounded in the classical understanding of yoga…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Bhagavadgita\n\nBy S Radhakrishnan,\n\nFrom my list on ethics in age appropriate ways for kids.\n\nBy A.A. Vora Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m of Indian ethnicity and Japanese nationality, so it felt natural to write a book that drew inspiration from both cultures without being adjacent to either one. Like me, my book is a mixed bag. It features an original mythology with a unique religion and mythical beasts that you’ve (hopefully) never seen before. It’s also pretty heavy on themes and tries to provide some context to questions that baffled me as a kid: Why do bad things happen to good people? Why do war and violence exist? I can’t say that I’ve answered those questions, but I hope I’ve provided a multifaceted perspective into the conversation around them.\n\nA.A.'s book list on ethics in age appropriate ways for kids\n\nWhy did A.A. love this book?\n\nMy mother introduced me to the Bhagavad Gita at a young age, but this particular translation and commentary was my most recent read.\n\nOne of my favorite concepts is the idea that our lives are moral battlegrounds for self-betterment and that our soul reincarnates through various lives to improve upon itself; and of course, karma yoga (the theory of karma), which is intrinsically linked with the concept of reincarnation.\n\nI find it difficult to speak further about this book because I really cannot do the Gita or its themes justice in my own words. Those interested should try it out for themselves and understand it in their own way.\n\nBy S Radhakrishnan,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Bhagavadgita as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nSanskrit text in English translation, with notes,commentary, and introductory essay by author. Helps those who seek to understand Hinduism. A classic.\n\nPreview\n\nTranslating Wisdom\n\nBy Shankar Nair,\n\nWhy did Mohammed love this book?\n\nThe findings in this book have opened my eyes to a truly unique moment in the history of cross-cultural translation and non-Western philosophy by showing how pre-modern Indian metaphysical teachings in Sanskrit were refashioned by the Persian Sufi philosophical tradition in early modern South Asia. I particularly recommend Translating Wisdom because it clearly points to an alternative quest for wisdom for those who wish to escape the stranglehold of Anglo-American and European epistemic systems.\n\nBy Shankar Nair,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Translating Wisdom as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA free open access ebook is available upon publication. Learn more at www.luminosoa.org.\n\nDuring the height of Muslim power in Mughal South Asia, Hindu and Muslim scholars worked collaboratively to translate a large body of Hindu Sanskrit texts into the Persian language. Translating Wisdom reconstructs the intellectual processes and exchanges that underlay these translations. Using as a case study the 1597 Persian rendition of the Yoga-Vasistha-an influential Sanskrit philosophical tale whose popularity stretched across the subcontinent-Shankar Nair illustrates how these early modern Muslim and Hindu scholars drew upon their respective religious, philosophical, and literary traditions to forge a common vocabulary…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Tantric Way\n\nBy Ajit Mookerjee, Madhu Khanna,\n\nWhy did Julie love this book?\n\nArt can serve as a support for meditation. Ritual brings the spiritual dimension of yoga into action. Mookerjee and Kanna’s breadth of living scholarship portray the ritual arts of the Indian Tantric traditions to be a form of yoga itself, one that reflects the non-dual or Advaita philosophy of Tantric yoga. This book is a practical guide, as well as a deep dive into Tantric symbolism, both satisfying and transformative. If you crave visual support for your practice, pick up this book.\n\nBy Ajit Mookerjee, Madhu Khanna,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Tantric Way as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn recent years, the West has shown a wide and enthusiastic interest in tantra and its application to everyday life. Though its roots are in Hinduism, tantra's goals are the universal ones of self-knowledge and liberated joy. Its methods and effects transcend geography and era.\n\nBasing its approach on a historical and explanatory survey, this book deals in a detailed way with astronomy, astrology, alchemy and cosmology in tantrism. In addition, there is discussion of the different viewpoints of 'left-hand' and 'right-hand' tantrikas and their respective attitudes towards human sexuality and its place in ritual. The drawings and illustrations serve…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Essential Mystics\n\nBy Andrew Harvey (editor),\n\nWhy did Alexandra love this book?\n\nHarvey chooses from a variety of faith traditions (including Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, and Ancient Greek thought) to share mystical and spiritual passages from sacred texts. His approach is not to explain the meaning as he sees it, but to offer the selections for readers to immerse themselves in the beautiful, historical writings without too much direction. This book is a source of renewal for me. My copy is dog-eared and highlighted. There is writing in the margins and post-its on the pages. I find the words of the mystics, including Rumi, Buddha, and saints like Francis of Assisi as a balm to my weary soul. More than once, sections of this book have been read aloud in my yoga classes.\n\nBy Andrew Harvey (editor),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Essential Mystics as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFrom the celebrated scholar and lecturer Andrew Harvey, a fascinating and inspiring introduction to the essential texts and themes of the great mystics.\n\nNot merely a feast of the greatest and wisest mystical revelations, 'The Essential Mystics' i\n\nPreview"
