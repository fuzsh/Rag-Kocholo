        "text": "BROOKINGS, S.D. (Dakota News Now) — Come Saturday night, they’ll turn out the lights on Frost Arena forever. But the party won’t be over.\n\nAnd, while they say that all good things must end, the last five decades indicate the essence of South Dakota State’s basketball venue will live on.\n\nAfter 51 years of packed houses, thunderous noise, 1,146 hoops wins, hundreds of other campus events, and several logistical changes, Frost Arena will host its final sporting event on Saturday when the SDSU women’s basketball team hosts North Dakota State. The men’s team already bowed out last Saturday, unless it hosts a postseason invitational tournament game in March.\n\nBefore tip-off of each of the finales, fans are treated to an 80-second Frost Arena tribute video full of building highlights over the five decades, with the raucous chants of “Let’s Go Rabbits” echoing under the flashbacks.\n\nThe men’s and women’s hoops teams have statistically enjoyed one of the best college home court advantages in the nation during its time — both winning 81 percent of their games there (men’s record is 574-139, while the women are 570-133) — in what is now considered a dingy and outdated den.\n\nThen, there’s the volleyball and wrestling matches, the high school state hoops tourneys, graduations, FFA competitions, and countless other events that have connected South Dakotans.\n\nYes, the end of a half-century era makes those who have logged in millions of hours there nostalgic.\n\n”When you think about Frost Arena, it’s an iconic facility in the state of South Dakota,” said Aaron Johnston, who has coached women’s hoops at SDSU for 25 years, with all but his first as the head coach. He’s led the Jacks to a Div. II national championship, a Div. I Sweet 16 berth, 11 conference championships, and 10 Summit League tournament titles.\n\n“To think of it as one of those places that has that much meaning for people, I think, is really cool,” Johnston said. “I know we say the name will change, but the nice thing about it is, people will always have those memories.”\n\nIf only those walls could talk. The good news for Jackrabbit fans is they’ll still shake with Frost Magic. Well, First Bank and Trust Magic.\n\nThe building won’t be torn down, but two days after Saturday’s finale, much of what people see once they walk through the structure that opened in 1973 will be gutted and be replaced in a $53 million renovation — $43 million coming from private donations, and $20 million of that from First Bank and Trust. Hence, the name change to First Bank and Trust Arena.\n\nIt will look and feel brand spanking new, and everything will be bigger and more spacious — the grand entrance, the concourses, the restrooms, almost all the seats and aisles, the Daktronics videoboard, the concession stands, and a noticeably louder and clearer sound system. Also new to the facility, for the first time, will be gathering spaces — several hospitality suites, a VIP club area for premium ticket holders, a public beer garden and lounge for the general public, standing room areas, and a students-only lounge that may be the first of its kind in the country, near the new student section seats.\n\n“I think that’s a sign of the times,” said Nancy Neiber, who coached the SDSU women for 16 years prior to Johnston and still sits courtside at most men’s and women’s games as an evaluator of game officials. She remembers the good old days of Frost Arena in the 1980′s when fans lined up outside the entries in sub-zero temperatures — sometimes hours before the game in lines that stretched all the way back to campus dorm halls — to get the best seats.\n\nAll seats in the joint were wooden bleachers, and tickets for those seats were almost all general admission — first-come, first-serve.\n\nNot anymore. The bleachers are finally gone. All seats are already chair-backs. And, now all fans will have plenty of room to roam, eat, drink, and be merry. Some, in first-class settings.\n\n“That’s what people expect when they buy their tickets,” Neiber said. “They expect an extra special experience, not only on the court but around the entire facility. And, so, that’s what South Dakota State will be providing with the help of a very generous donor. The new experience may be for the younger generation, the new generation of fans.”\n\nIt’s part of the mammoth overhaul of facilities and funding since SDSU took the leap from Div. II athletics to Div. I in 2003.\n\nJustin Sell has been the school’s athletics director since 2009. He led the fundraising and guided the visions of the new, 19,000-seat Dana J. Dykhouse Stadium for football, which opened in 2016, the $32 million Sanford-Jackrabbit Athletic Complex, and $6 million Stiegelmeier Family Student-Athlete Center.\n\nOn Wednesday, like the proud new owner of a house under construction, Sell gave Dakota News Now a behind-the-scenes tour of the new spaces and described what they will be, and what they will mean.\n\nYou can see an eight-minute video of that tour below:\n\nWhen asked what the most frequent concern was of all SDSU stakeholders involved — from players to coaches to administrators, to alumni, to high-rolling boosters, to the Average Joe fans — about the transition from Frost Arena to First Bank & Trust Arena, Sell said one element emerged among many.\n\n“It would be the environment,” Sell said. “Because when you’re here and it’s a tight game and we can make a difference, and the old Frost Magic gets going, and you can feel it. How do you capture the Frost Magic?”\n\nThose last two words are real and can be felt by almost anyone who has attended almost any Jackrabbit basketball game for 51 years.\n\nKeith Jensen has been there for almost all of them, and was there for 20 years of hoops before Frost Arena. The 89-year-old former journalist and newspaper owner was a pole vaulter at SDSU from 1952-56 and remembers “The Barn,” the home hoops venue prior to 1973, which sat about 1,500 fans.\n\nFrost Arena brought quadruple the amount of seats, and 51 years of deafening noise when the Jacks started to click. The school’s first alumni director, Jensen has a courtside seat and starts a “Let’s Go Rabbits” chant at some point in every game for as long as he can remember.\n\n“All I can tell you is it gets so loud, that a lot of people are annoyed by it,” Jensen said, adding that most of them are “old... but not me.”\n\nSo, what’s it like playing among the rabid Rabbits crowd? Charley Easley is a senior who transferred from Nebraska and played in both modern and classic Big Ten venues that seat twice to four times what Frost can fit. Cathedrals like Assembly Hall (both Indiana and Illinois), Mackey Arena (Purdue), Williams Arena (Minnesota), and NBA-worthy palaces like Pinnacle Bank Arena (Nebraska), the Kohl Center (Wisconsin) and Value City Arena (Columbus).\n\n“I’d put it right up there with them,” Easley said of Frost Arena. ”I’ve loved it for all four years I’ve been here. It’s kind of all on top of you, almost, and I like how it’s so compact, and it gets loud in there when you go on runs.”\n\nSell said that aspect will be preserved and, in fact, enhanced in the new arena. It was a focal point in conversations with the architects. The newest sections of chair-back seats in the arena (on the north, south, and west sides) are already built above the area where the upper bowl wooden bleachers sat. Above those seats on the west side will be the several hospitality suite areas.\n\n“It’s going to be louder than the old Frost, without a doubt,” Sell said. “You added height and brought it in tighter. You look at this bowl right now — everything’s contained in it.”\n\nPeak Frost Arena, old timers will tell you, came on February 11, 1989, when a building-record 9,456 fans showed up for a women’s-men’s doubleheader between the Jackrabbits and North Central Conference rival Augustana. That was back in the all-wooden bleacher days.\n\n“Those were fun days,” said Neiber. “Fun days for our fans, for our student-athletes. Those were the days when the fans were right on the floor. They were right down there, right behind the bench, or in the front row, all the way around the arena.”\n\nThose days are long gone. Chair-back courtside seating arrived on both main sides (not behind the baskets) in 1992, and capacity has been 6,000 to 6,500 since (when the upper bleachers are folded out). Along the way the last 30 years, student sections behind the baskets were elevated several feet above the floor, and so was the west side behind both teams’ benches, to make way for the media tables.\n\nBut in First Bank & Trust Arena, although the capacity will dip to 5,500, the whole joint will have almost entirely chair-back seats (the north side student section will has plastic bleachers), and all four sides of them will be right on the floor again.\n\n“I think our fans at SDSU have always given the team a home-court advantage,” Neiber said. “They’ve got a great knowledge of the game of basketball. They’re very, very loyal and they can become very, very loud when our teams give them something to get off their feet about. So, yes, I think it is as loud as it used to be during important games, during exciting times.”\n\nNeiber relates the evolution of the building, from old school to new age, to Wrigley Field in Chicago, the home of the Chicago Cubs. Wrigley had a rustic charm about it that made it a relic from a different time, allowing fans to step back in time. But it has changed with the times, too. Lights, electronic video boards, and VIP bells and whistles. But, plenty of elements of the old Wrigley remain intact.\n\nSell said expect the same at First Bank and Trust Arena. Some of those old wooden bleachers are already hanging in a ring above bathrooms and concession stands in the concourses. Some will be in the new home and visiting locker room facilities.\n\n”There are going to be elements in here that are going to keep touches of Frost, which we believes adds warmth,” Sell said. “Which is really what Frost is about. It’s a gathering place for our people and creates a warm feeling.”\n\nJensen, the dean of Frost Arena fans, is not the least bit concerned about the space losing its charm.\n\n”Excited is the biggest word. Very excited,” Jensen said of seeing First Bank and Trust Arena. “I’ve been through different venues of it and different versions of it over the years, but the plans I see, I’m very excited about it.”\n\nHe has also been around long enough to know that “Frost Magic” has been no fluke. What makes going to SDSU games a special experience, and the place so loud, no matter the year or decade or seating configuration, is the consistent success of both the men’s and women’s teams.\n\nWhile the women have piled up trophies for over 30 years, the men have seized eight Summit League regular season titles and six trips to the NCAA Tournament since 2012. From 2012-22, the Jackrabbits were 141-7 in Frost Arena, a winning percentage of 95 percent, the best of all 350 teams in Div. I.\n\nThat is rarified air with blue blood programs like Duke, Kansas, and Kentucky during that time. The common thread isn’t just a legendary old venue.\n\n“It’s the quality of the coaches and the programs they’ve developed,” Jensen said. “We’ve been good. We’ve been competitive. And, if you’re not competitive, you don’t get a whole lot of people attending them. They’re not coming if they’re going, ‘oh, well,’ I don’t know if we’re going to win this one.’ The quality of the program has this community glued into it.”\n\nIn their final season at Frost Arena, the SDSU women are 11-1 at home with two games left — Thursday versus North Dakota and Saturday against North Dakota State. The Jackrabbits easily clinched their tenth Summit League regular season title since 2009 weeks ago.\n\nThe SDSU men are in first place in the conference with two road games remaining and went 11-3 in their final campaign in Frost Arena, culminating with a 77-72 win over St. Thomas in front of 3,132 rocking fans on Saturday. The Jackrabbits trailed by nine points early in the second half, then went on a 20-2 run over a four-minute stretch to take a nine-point lead.\n\nDuring those four minutes, the eruptions grew louder and louder after each basket. The tidal wave of momentum and noise rose to a fever pitch. Frost Magic, one last time.\n\nAfter the game, SDSU coach Eric Henderson was reminded how dominant the Jackrabbits have been over the last dozen years in Frost Arena — up there with iconic landmarks like Phog Allen Fieldhouse, Rupp Arena, Cameron Indoor Stadium — and was asked if he was concerned about SDSU’s arena losing any edge when the new version opens next season.\n\n“Those are pretty staggering numbers to think about, so hopefully we can keep that atmosphere here and that energy and stuff,” Henderson said. “I think, obviously there is an aura about a building and some coolness, but the end of the day, I’m a relationship guy and a people guy, and so what makes this place special is, as important as the building is, is the people inside of it. And, I know they’re not going anywhere."
