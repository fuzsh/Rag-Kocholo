        "text": "The transfer window is open, and teams across Major League Soccer are making some serious moves. New faces are coming to a market near you, no matter where youâre at, setting up an exciting race to the finish line in the 2024 MLS regular season. Weâve seen a continuation of global signings coming in from all kinds of leagues and nations, making the worldâs most diverse soccer league even more so.\n\nRight here at Minnesota United, weâve seen three new signings join since the window opened officially, and while none of them have taken to the pitch just yet, I wanted to give you my two cents on who weâve brought in, how theyâll fit into the team, and what skills theyâve brought with them. Iâm not on the clubâs scouting or coaching staffâthough Iâm not opposed to it, if anyone up in the Blaine office is reading thisâbut I do write about this sport for a living, so youâre just going to have to take my word on these guys until you get a chance to see them with your own eyes.\n\nKelvin Yeboah\n\nFirst up, weâve got Ghanaian-Italian forward Kelvin Yeboah. The 24-year-old striker joins the Loons as a Designated Player, bringing with him professional playing experience in six different European leagues, including the German Bundesliga, Italian Serie A, and French Ligue 1. Heâs just entering the prime of his career, and with the resume and attributes that he brings with him, heâs primed to take the league by storm.\n\nA combination of speed, sharp footwork, and composure in attacking scenarios makes Yeboah a constant threat for his opposition. Heâs got a nose for goals, an ability to get to the endline and turn inside, and a penchant for picking out a pass. While heâs often labeled as a striker, itâs his wide playmaking ability that sets him apart most, so expect to see him either drifting wide from a central position or even starting on the wing outright.\n\nWhile Iâm unsure what Coach Ramsayâs plans are for his newest DP, Iâd personally love to see him line up in a two-striker system. With Teemu Pukki alongside him, the experienced Finn would be freed up to stay in the box while Yeboah creates wide and feeds his strike partner in the middle. Alternatively, a front two of Tani Oluwaseyi and Yeboah would make for a fluid interchange of positioning, as both have the legs and willingness to make fast and intelligent runs to the flanks. Iâd likely prefer to have Yeboahâs skillset on the right side of the pitch, as his crossing and passing ability, paired with his dominant right foot, make him a greater threat when heâs coming at the box with the ability to slide the ball to a waiting teammate.\n\nJefferson DÃ­az\n\nThe next item on the Loons shopping list this window was a center back, and they went south for this one. Defender Jefferson Diaz joins the Loons after a stint with Deportivo Cali in his native Colombia, and the 23-year-old brings a unique resume with him. Despite his young age, Diaz has already played over 100 professional games, gaining valuable experience that most players his age will have to play several more years to match.\n\nOn top of his invaluable mixture of youth and experience, Diazâs sheer size makes him an immediate candidate to slide into the starting lineup. His 6â1â frame and solid build make him a strong presence in the box, while his experience playing as a striker early in his career gives him insight into what his opposition will be hoping to do. The physical play that heâs grown accustomed to in the Colombian first division will translate nicely to MLS, setting Diaz up for what could be a perfect fit in the Loons back three.\n\nDepending on his sharpness and his ability to quickly familiarize himself with a back three, Diaz could be a contender for serious minutes upon arrival. With a relatively thin center-back group that has deputized Devin Padelford and Carlos Harvey at different points during the season, another strong presence that is familiar and comfortable in the position will be a welcome addition. If all goes to plan, Iâd expect Tapias to line up on the left, Boxall in the middle, and Diaz on the right. Bacharach, Padelford, and Harvey will fill the gaps as needed when theyâre not playing other positions.\n\nMatÃºÅ¡ KmeÅ¥\n\nLast, but certainly not least, the club brought in defender MatÃºÅ¡ KmeÅ¥ from AS TrenÄÃ­n of the Slovakian first division. The 24-year-old fullback has played in his native Slovakia for his entire professional career thus far, racking up more than 150 appearances in his domestic league and providing 27 assists in 96 games for his latest club.\n\nKmeÅ¥ brings a fantastic ball-striking ability to the squad, demonstrating a passing and finishing range that are unique to see in a defender. Primarily a fullback, his ability to get forward makes him an ideal candidate to play as a wingback. Heâs got a knack for picking the right moments to step into the attack, mixed with the speed and workrate necessary to recover from advanced positions. Given that heâs right-foot dominant, heâll likely slot in at right wingback for the Loons once heâs integrated into the squad, and with his quality, heâll likely be starting in no time.\n\nThe window isnât shut, and you didnât hear it from me, but the club might not be done making moves. Then again, they might be. Do you think theyâd actually let me tell you that information? Ha! They donât trust me with that sort of intel, not yet at least. Iâll scrape together what spoilers I can for you, but you better not throw me under the bus and get me fired if I manage to slip a few tips through the cracks. Iâm trusting you guys, and I need you to trust me. Weâre symbiotic, you and me. Iâll see you after the next signingâor I wonât, who really knows anymore."
