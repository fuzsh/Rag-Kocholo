        "text": "Stadium in New Zealand\n\nCentral Energy Trust Arena is the current name of the 180,000 square meter publicly owned recreational complex just west of the Palmerston North city center in the Manawatū-Whanganui region of New Zealand.\n\nIt has three linked indoor stadiums with movable tiered seating. Outdoor facilities include football fields and a speedway track with a grandstand.\n\nIn June 2015, FMG Insurance chose not to renew the sponsorship deal for the main stadium name.[1]\n\nOriginally founded in 1886 as the Palmerston North Showgrounds, its pavilion burnt down in a fire in 1977. It was replaced with a new stand, and the ground was reopened in 1981 as the Manawatu Sports Stadium. Since 1973 it has been owned by the Palmerston North City Council.[2]\n\nCentral Energy Trust Arena has a capacity of 15,000.[3] Temporary seating is added for major events, allowing the capacity to reach 20,000.\n\nCentral Energy Trust Arena is home to Manawatu Rugby. It is the home ground of the Manawatu Turbos, and also generally hosts one club game per week. Playing in the Air New Zealand Cup, crowd attendances at Turbos' games have been among the highest in the competition, averaging 7,000 per game.[4]\n\nCentral Energy Trust Arena was formerly known as Arena 1 and FMG Stadium. It was the venue for the first ever Super 12 rugby match in 1996, which was played by the Wellington Hurricanes and the Auckland Blues.\n\nThe stadium was the host of the 1987 Rugby World Cup game between Wales and Tonga on 29 May. Wales won 29–16.\n\nThe ground was a venue for the British & Irish Lions on the 2005 British & Irish Lions tour to New Zealand with a game against Manawatu Turbos on 28 June.\n\nOn 28 March 2009, The Highlanders played a Super Rugby 'home' game at Central Energy Trust Arena against the Bulls. The game attracted a large crowd of over 10,000—one of the Highlanders' biggest of the 2009 season.\n\nOn 4 September 2011, The Manawatu Turbos hosted the Hawkes Bay Magpies in the ITM Championship Cup Final at Central Energy Trust Arena. Crowd attendance was 13,100.\n\nThe stadium hosted two pool games in the 2011 Rugby World Cup, in which New Zealand was the host nation. With the city's central location, large student population, the stadium's close proximity to the CBD, International Pacific College, as well as the New Zealand Rugby Institute (a facility which the All Blacks used to use), the idea of basing a team and having a pool game in Palmerston North was attractive.\n\nOn 18 March 2016, The Hurricanes played another Super Rugby 'home' game at Central Energy Trust Arena against the Western Force. The game attracted a crowd of over 8,000.\n\nThe stadium hosted its first rugby league test match when New Zealand lost to Great Britain 11–10 on 24 June 1990 in front of 8,073 fans.\n\nThe stadium hosted New Zealand Kiwis' victory in their first rugby league test of the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand. In front of 11,548 fans, the Kiwis defeated Great Britain 15-14 after a late Daryl Halligan field goal.\n\nPalmerston North also hosted the second game of the 1993 Trans-Tasman series against Australia, played on a water-logged ground after constant rain. Despite the arctic like conditions, an overflow crowd of 19,000 hardy fans saw the Mal Meninga led Aussies run out 16-8 winners.\n\nOverall, the stadium hosted six test matches between 1990 and 1996. Its last test to date saw New Zealand defeat Great Britain 18–15 on 25 October 1996 in front of 12,000 fans.\n\nRugby league Test matches\n\nList of Test matches played at Palmerston North.[5]\n\nGame# Date Result Attendance Notes 1 24 June 1990 Great Britain def.

The national Teams Championships have been held there, early February, bringing racers from all over the country. The season starts mid-October and finishes by the start of May.\n\nThe YoungHeart Manawatu association football team used to play at the ground, however they have since moved to Memorial Park, Palmerston North.\n\nCentral Energy Trust Arena hosted the Wellington Phoenix association football team in a home game against Sydney FC on 12 December 2009 in the Hyundai A-League.\n\nCentral Energy Trust Arena was twice host of Te Matatini nationwide Kapa haka competition.\n\nRedeveloped in 2004, Arena 2 is a multipurpose indoor sporting facility, capable of holding exhibitions, conventions, and entertainment events.

The arena has also played host to international basketball, hosting the New Zealand Tall Blacks on occasions, including the FIBA Oceania Championship. For sponsorship reasons, the arena is known as the Fly Palmy Arena.[9]\n\nArena 3 has a floor area of 2100 square metres and is an indoor sports centre.
