Work has been done on the arena's sports floor, improved lighting and better changing facilities installed, and plans are to update technology across the venue.\n\nThe Trusts Arena CEO Brian Blake says the venue is a New Zealand success story with a national and international reputation - and that is a key to it remaining widely accessible and affordable to the public.\n\n'We are successful in attracting top sports and international acts like Ronan Keating and One Direction â€“ and that makes us a successful business which can pay its costs from its earnings."
