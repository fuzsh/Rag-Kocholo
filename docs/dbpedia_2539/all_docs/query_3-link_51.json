        "text": "Known as “The Remix King”, DJ Noiz has become a household name across the pacific. From the humble beginnings of growing up in the small-town of Robinvale in the south west of NSW with a strong Samoan and Tongan heritage, Noiz relocated to Brisbane as an adult with his family in the Ipswich-Goodna region. He soon burst on the scene in 2012 and became a Soundcloud favourite with his unique island style reggae remixes racking up an astonishing 15 million streams in the first 2 years being active. Noiz found himself having a huge demand in Australia and New Zealand, headlining club events every weekend for the next 3 years dropping his remixes through his multiple Soundcloud and YouTube accounts on a regular basis.\n\nFast forward to 2016, Noiz soon found himself as a premier DJ and producer collaborating and remixing the best in Polynesian reggae and R&B artists and subsequently was nominated at The 2nd Annual World Remix Awards in the Rap Category for his remix of Kent Jones “Don’t Mind” alongside some of the biggest DJ’s in the world. If this wasn’t enough for Noiz, he soon released his debut single featuring Konecs and Vili Langi titled “Ofa Mai” which has racked up an impressive 20 million streams to date. He has since released his 2nd single “Senorita” which peaked at Number 1 on the New Zealand Heatseeker Singles Chart and has gained over 10 million streams on Spotify and YouTube.\n\nComing into 2018 with an impressive resume of producer credits with Donell Lewis, Swiss and Kennyon Brown, Noiz joined long-time friends Donell Lewis and Kennyon Brown as a co-headliner on their debut USA and Hawaii tour – selling out shows in San Jose, Los Angeles, Seattle, Salt Lake City and Las Vegas – and were invited to perform on selected shows with Missouri Reggae / R&B star Spawnbreezie. Since returning from the USA, Noiz has released his newest single “Chill” featuring Konecs, Donell Lewis and Kennyon Brown which has peaked at #18 on the New Zealand top 40 and #1 on the R&B charts in Australia, New Zealand, PNG and Fiji. The music video has also racked up an astonishing 6 million views since. In May and June 2018 he embarked on his first ever headline Pacific Island tour, headlining club shows in Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Cook Islands which brought great success to the island nations.\n\nHis release in January 2019 titled \"Better Days\" shot to acclaim with a whopping 1 million streams on YouTube in under 3 months and a music video to accompany the song was released shortly after. This was followed by his sophomore USA tour in March 2019 with a handful of sold out shows followed by solo headline dates in Australia, New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, New Caledonia and Cook Islands during the months of April, May and June. Following this, Noiz dropped his much anticipated follow up single \"Tati\" with Kennyon Brown and Donell Lewis which has amassed over 3,000,000 streams since, following this he recently went on tour Australia wide headlining over 40 headline dates as part of his co-curated \"Faded\" events. In January, 2020 he dropped his highly anticipated single \"Amelia\" with Kennyon Brown, Donell Lewis and Victor J Sefo which has amased over 6 million streams in 18 months and collaborated with Tenelle on the \"Island King\" (Remix) which now has over 8 million streams in 1 year.\n\nFast foward to late 2020, during the COVID pandemic - DJ Noiz's first ever officially released single \"Senorita\" from 2017 featuring Kennyon Brown, Donell Lewis and Konecs went viral on TikTok amassing an impressive 2+ million TikTok videos in 6 months and with an already impressive 12+ million streams before going viral, it is now currently sitting on 45+ million streams worldwide - huge effort for a completely independent artist from Australia. Since then, Noiz has gone on to release an ambudance of mashups and remixes with his signature sound bringing new life and energy to his already vibrant career as an artist and DJ, along with the hit singles in late 2020 and early 2021 \"Throw It Back\" featuring Vili Langi, Raggadat Cris and \"My Best\" featuring Will84 & Victor J Sefo which combined have already amassed over 5 million streams in total. On the back of these singles he has recently completed a 20+ show tour with 3/4 of the shows being comletely sold out and with more on the way on the back end of this year, it's safe to say DJ Noiz is here to stay! Look out for The Remix King...\n\nRead More"
