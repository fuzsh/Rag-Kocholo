        "text": "Leicester Arena becomes Mattioli Arena in recognition of charitable trust\n\nLeicester Riders’ home venue, Leicester Arena, will now be known as the Mattioli Arena.\n\nThe Ian & Clare Mattioli Charitable Trust has accepted naming rights to Leicester Arena, the largest indoor arena in Leicester.\n\nThe venue – previously the Morningside Arena – is now being rebranded.\n\nThe Trust has donated funds to the Leicester Riders Foundation, the charity which develops basketball and other sport participation for people of all ages across Leicester and Leicestershire.\n\nThe generosity of the Mattioli family has resulted in the Trust being offered naming rights to the Arena in recognition of their continued support.\n\nRecent donations from the Trust are in addition to the £500,000 donation made to help fund the Arena’s extension in 2022.\n\nThe Arena will work with the family to create a lasting legacy gifted to communities in Leicester and Leicestershire.\n\nThe Trust – established by the Mattioli family in 2016 – works to help enhance the lives and opportunities of local people.\n\nIn particular it works with communities and socio-economic groups which are often sidelined and struggle to access opportunities for advancement, personal growth, and to fully participate in society.\n\nIan Mattioli MBE, Founder of the Trust and CEO of Mattioli Woods, said: “We are delighted to continue our support of the Arena, and are proud to accept the naming rights.\n\n“The Mattioli Arena delivers high-quality and high-class events, while at the same time focussing on its community commitments and increasing the profile of the city.\n\n“Leicester has always looked after our family in the very safest of environments and that is why we are delighted to be part of creating a legacy for the diverse communities we support in the City of Leicester and beyond.\n\n“To also be able to do this through sport and a venue that has the potential to impact so many people is something we will continue to take great pride in, and we hope it will be used by many, many people over coming years.”\n\nKevin Routledge, Chairman of Leicester Riders, Trustee of Riders Foundation, and a Director of the Arena, said: “Once again, Ian and Clare Mattioli Charitable Trust has shown its commitment to the city and the work of our Foundation, and the Mattioli Arena, and we are hugely appreciative of that.\n\n“The work of the Riders Foundation, and the demands on the Arena, continue to grow and we are committed to further enhancements to our facilities.\n\n“We are hugely appreciative to the Mattioli family’s generous support, which will enable us to deliver an arena, community services, and events that will continue to make the city proud.”\n\nThe 3,000-capacity Mattioli Arena stages an increasingly wide range of national and international sports and entertainment events.\n\nIt also provides a wide range of community sports opportunities through the Riders’ extensive underage basketball programmes through the Leicester Riders Foundation.\n\nThe venue also provides opportunities for Leicester College students, wheelchair basketball users, and other community sport users – making it the largest of its type in the UK.\n\nLast year’s extension to the Arena is already bringing significant additional revenue to the city. It consists of a standalone, 1,200-metre squared, two-court sports hall, with a new entrance to the arena also completed at the top of Memory Lane.\n\nIt also has the largest solar array on any individual building in the city, generating 246 kW(p) of solar power as helping the Arena focus on becoming a net zero business.\n\nThe Riders are in action at the Mattioli Arena tonight, taking on the Plymouth City Patriots."
