        "text": "Working in close collaboration with stakeholders from across Philadelphia, the 76ers are poised to fully deliver a world-class arena to the heart of Philadelphia – at no cost to city taxpayers. This slam dunk for our city, businesses, residents, and fans is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to revitalize Market East and give the 76ers and its fans the arena they deserve.\n\nThe 76ers’ need for a modern and permanent home aligns with the city’s need to revitalize Market East, a section of Center City dealing with increasing vacancy and decreased foot traffic, creating a win-win opportunity.\n\n27 NBA Teams have downtown arenas. Philly is a sports city, second to none, and deserves to be next:\n\nThe project would be a major economic driver for Philadelphia, creating jobs and contract opportunities during construction and after opening. We are committed to connecting these economic opportunities to residents and businesses in the surrounding neighborhoods and communities of color across the city.\n\nOur vision for 76Place was born in 2022, reimagining what an arena could do for our community. From conception to ribbon-cutting, we expect the 76ers to tip off for their first game in 2031.\n\n76Place is being built to give our team a state-of-the-art facility and our fans the experience they deserve, serving as an anchor for the revitalization of Market East. Meet the team working hard to bring you 76Place – a reimagined arena for the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nTogether, we can make 76Place a model for inclusive, responsible, and equitable development that re-energizes Market Street East and lifts up our entire community. Learn more about the Sixers’ commitment to invest $50 million towards a Community Benefit Agreement.\n\nThe 76ers are ready to bring a new, championship-caliber arena to the heart of Philadelphia. In anticipation of this project, we want Philadelphia to know that we take our responsibility seriously and are pledging our commitment to being a model of equitable development that benefits not only its surrounding communities – but all of Philadelphia."
