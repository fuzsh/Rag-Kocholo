Visit our website for more information on each event. üîówww.thetrustsarena.co.nz\n\nMichael Ocego and Samantha Norris have returned from TheStadiumBusiness Summit, and have shared some excellent learnings during their time in the UK: 1. Key discussions focused on the role of connectivity in enhancing the tech-driven fan experience, innovative uses for underutilised spaces, the rising importance of food and beverage, and creative strategies to transform stadiums into year-round venues. The increasing impact of AI on fan engagement and stadium security was also a major highlight. 2. Globally, one of the most effective diversification strategies for stadiums has been the addition of hotels, as illustrated by insights from Daniel Gidney, CEO of Emirates Old Trafford and Lancs Cricket, Tynecastle Park Hotel, and Adelaide Oval. Notably, the hotel's revenue is projected to surpass that of international cricket at the venue for the first time this year. 3. The conference was highly focused on engaging attendees and exploring ways for venues to streamline operations while enhancing the overall experience. For The Trusts Arena, several new initiatives inspired by the conference will be unveiled in the coming months. 4. Lastly, the event was a platform to celebrate our awards finalists, including our own Samantha Norris, who was honoured as a finalist in the ‚ÄòUnsung Hero‚Äô category. Narrowed down to 5 finalists from 755 applications, Sam's recognition is a significant achievement, and although she didn't win, The Trusts Arena team is immensely proud of her. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nPresenting our new Gym Manager, Jordan!
