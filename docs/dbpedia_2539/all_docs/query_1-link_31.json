        "text": "Winner – Supreme Venue 2015\n\nWinner – Best Large Venue of the year\n\nThe Trusts Arena has won the Supreme Venue of the Year at the Entertainment Venues Association (EVANZ) National Awards. We are incredibly proud of our whole team in winning this award. As one of the busiest facilities in New Zealand the long hours of work in the middle of the night and early mornings often goes unrewarded. This team works incredibly hard to deliver a wide array of sports and events to our community and to be recognized as the best in our industry is incredibly humbling and rewarding.\n\nBrian Blake – Chief Executive\n\nThe Trusts Arena also won best Large Venue of the year beating Eden Park and Seddon Park in Hamilton for the Award. Previous Supreme Venue Awards winners have been Vector Arena and Claudelands Arena in Hamilton. The Large Venue category is for Venues with a seated capacity of over 5,000 seats.\n\nThe Entertainment Venues Association of New Zealand is the Peak National Body for the Venues Industry and works towards delivering excellence across the entire venue industry within New Zealand. The inaugural awards were held in 2013 to recognize those venues who represent the best the industry has to offer and to develop a culture of excellence in the venue industry. The awards are judged by a panel of industry hirers and association judges in a blind judging process.\n\nThe judges are looking for a clear understanding of the venues aims and objectives as well as a commitment to its staff and stakeholders to deliver venues that are sustainable and positive assets to their communities.\n\nThe Trusts Arena first opened in 2004 as The Trusts Stadium. Serving over 750,000 visitors per year it is one of the busiest community facilities in New Zealand. The model for the Trusts Arena is to blend Commercial profits into Community Sport and Recreation for the benefit of West and wider Auckland."
