The fish could be viewed through a long acrylic tunnel.The aquarium opened in 1985 after 10 months of construction. Tarleton developed a new method for building an acrylic tunnel by taking large sheets of clear acrylic, cutting them to size and heating them in an oven until they took shape. Some of the sheets weighed more than a ton. Due to the refraction caused by light passing through the water and the acrylic sheets used to create the tunnel, the fish appear to be a third smaller than they actually are.The main features of the aquarium are \"Meeting with Antarctica\" and \"Underwater World\", but it also includes several other exhibits and several study rooms.\n\n2 .
