        "text": "An Irvine bank you probably haven’t heard of will have its name slapped on a new soccer stadium in Los Angeles that will host a pro team that hasn’t played a game yet.\n\nTalk about a long shot.\n\nBanc of California, a banking brand started in 2013 after the merger of several small institutions, is linking up with the Los Angeles Football Club. The team will start play in 2018 at the new field on the site of the soon-to-be-demolished Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.\n\nThis marriage of a fast-growing business bank and a new Major League Soccer franchise is an intriguing attempt to grab a share of the crowded Southern California sports spotlight with Banc of California Stadium.\n\nHere are seven things you should know about naming-rights deals that have turned the moniker of many sports facilities into corporate salesmanship.\n\n1. Who started this?\n\nYou can blame baseball.\n\nTwo historic stadiums have names tied to family businesses of onetime owners: The Boston Red Sox’s Fenway Park and the Chicago Cubs’ Wrigley Field.\n\nThen in 1953, Anheuser-Busch bought the St. Louis Cardinals and wanted to change Sportsman’s Park to Budweiser Stadium, after the flagship product. That idea was rejected by baseball czars as inappropriate, and the compromise was Busch Stadium – a name that has stuck to the Cardinals’ two succeeding baseball stadiums.\n\nSome marketing experts say the 1998 deal that put the FedEx name on the Washington Redskins football stadium was a breakthrough as the then-eye-catching pricing – $200 million over 27 years – showed the financial potential of this branding tactic.\n\n2. What’s the game?\n\nMarketing is about getting eyeballs on your brand.\n\nStadium owners have high-profile venues that get seen frequently – in person or on TV – and are talked about even more among fans and in the media. Plus, the stadium operators and the teams that play there hope there are some two-way synergies. Like, the Banc of California becoming the new soccer’s club banker.\n\nOn the other hand, there are plenty of consumer-facing companies that think they need this kind of exposure. Of course, pricing and terms are challenging hurdles, as no company seemingly wants to overpay for its marketing exposure. But many do.\n\nThat raises questions if these deals are often more about corporate ego than true marketing prowess.\n\n3. How much money?\n\nBanc of California and the soccer team didn’t talk terms but Bloomberg News pegged the value at $100 million over 15 years.\n\nStadium price tags are definitely on the rise.\n\nWhen the Angels – then owned by the Walt Disney Co. – sold the stadium’s name to the electric company in 1998, the 20-year deal was worth $1.4 million a year. (Edison International Field of Anaheim lasted just five years as the utility opted out of the deal.)\n\nIn 2002, Home Depot agreed to slap its name on the then-new pro soccer pitch in Carson in a 10-year deal at $7 million annually. The home-improvement retailer didn’t renew its deal. Ticket broker StubHub took over, reportedly at $10 million a year.\n\nWhen Farmers Insurance was planning to take the naming rights for a planned downtown Los Angeles football stadium, it was reported the insurer was willing to pay $20 million-plus annually for 30 years. The stadium won’t be built.\n\n4. Who does this?\n\nThe modern corporate marketing playbook seems to include placing your name on a professional team’s stadium or arena.\n\nThere’s the new T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas that will host the new pro hockey team in 2017. Pro football’s Minnesota Vikings are moving to the new U.S. Bank Stadium this fall.\n\nMercedes-Benz will have its logo on two NFL facilities when Atlanta’s new stadium opens next year. (There’s already the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans.)\n\nChase Bank’s name will adorn the Golden State Warriors’ future basketball arena in 2019. And last week the Chicago White Sox said its baseball stadium will become Guaranteed Rate Field – a local mortgage maker – after its deal with U.S. Cellular ends this season.\n\n5. What’s the risk?\n\nThe name on the stadium can become an embarrassment.\n\nBaseball’s Houston Astros had a public relations nightmare just one year after its Enron Field opened in 2000. The energy company’s scandal-filled collapse turned “Enron” into a phrase meaning crooked business.\n\nThe Astros had to sue Enron and pay $2 million to get the name back. Next, the team got Coca-Cola to pay $3.3 million annually for 30 years to rename the field Minute Maid Park.\n\nThe Astros’ rivals, the Texas Rangers, had a headache, too, after selling their stadium name in 2004 to Orange County-based Ameriquest, the mortgage maker that pioneered high-risk loans that created the housing bubble.\n\nThree years later, as Ameriquest’s bad business practices were unraveling, the Rangers essentially fired the lender and put the generic “The Ballpark” name on the stadium.\n\n6. Are name changes common?\n\nSadly, yes.\n\nAnyone remember hockey played at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim? (That’s Honda Center, for those with short memories.)\n\nLike any business endeavor, many marketing deals don’t pencil out. Some stadium-name partnerships don’t renew.\n\nIn other cases, companies have a change of heart – merge, rename themselves or go bust.\n\nTake San Jose, where hockey’s Sharks have played since 2001 in the Compaq Center, HP Pavilion and SAP Center – while never moving from what fans affectionately call “The Shark Tank.”\n\nFootball’s Denver Broncos had to scramble this year to win court approval to regain naming rights from Sports Authority, the failed retailer. Previously, the stadium was Invesco Field after opening as Mile High Stadium.\n\nAnd let’s say you’re a Miami Dolphins fan. The team’s 30-year-old stadium has been Dolphin Stadium, Joe Robbie Stadium, Dolphins Stadium, Pro Player Park, Pro Player Stadium, Landshark Stadium and Sun Life Stadium … and now, Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nIs the extra cash worth the risk of constant rebranding of a stadium?\n\n7. So everyone does it?\n\nWell, it’s curious who doesn’t play the name game: some of America’s top marketers.\n\nWalt Disney Co. once owned two Orange County sports teams but sold the playing facilities’ naming rights to others.\n\nDo you see a Costco Stadium, Apple Arena or Starbucks Field?\n\nAnd not every owner/operator of an athletic facility is a seller.\n\nTwo iconic baseball franchises – the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees – have their stadiums simply named after the team.\n\nIn Anaheim, it became Angel Stadium after Edison’s departure.\n\nFootball’s Green Bay Packers still play at Lambeau Field, named in 1965 for a longtime coach.\n\nAnd New York’s legendary Madison Square Garden – home to basketball’s Knicks and hockey’s Rangers – hasn’t sold out, either.\n\nThankfully, tradition still lives on in some organizations."
