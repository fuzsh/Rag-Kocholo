        "text": "There are over 380 free car parks at the Arena. These are all available on a first come first served basis. There are specially reserved parks for mobility patrons (first come, first served), Arena Fitness Gym members and tenants of the Arena.\n\nDuring some events, parking at the Arena can be limited or completely unavailable due to the unique requirements of each event. In some cases the hirer or exhibitor can hire out part or all of the car park for their event. In addition for some events there is a parking fee. Please contact the Arena to ask if parking will be available before attending your event and if there will be a fee.\n\nThere is also a drop-off and collection only zone at the front of the Arena for those displaying a valid Mobility Parking Permit or by prior arrangement with the venue, when parking in general has been restricted.\n\nThere is also some parking available at the Arena for large buses with a minimum of 39 seats, please call us on (09) 970-5200 prior to an event to book a space. These bus parks are also event dependent as described in more detail above.\n\nSome parking is available in the surrounding areas and nearby streets. These are not owned or operated by the Trusts Arena and some charges may apply. Please be mindful of parking restrictions in certain areas as well as keeping business & residential driveways and access routes clear.\n\nTraffic management and some road closures may be in place for certain events, please plan your journey in advance.\n\nCheck out the map on the Finding Us Page."
