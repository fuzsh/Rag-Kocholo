We’re embracing Technology, Innovation and Transformation to re-define the global #1 venue business showcase. Join your colleagues from all around the world as we bring together the leading stadium, arena and venue executives to explore the future of our business.\n\nWho? What?\n\nEach year TheStadiumBusiness Summit hosts the world’s leading gathering of key thinkers, movers and shakers from across the global sports and entertainment world.\n\nNetwork with everyone that’s worth networking with.\n\nLike no other event, we bring together the global stadium, arena and entertainment venue business. Our proven formula (Compact Footprint x Quality Content = Maximum Knowledge Transfer) remains the same.\n\nThe speakers and attendees you can expect range from owners and executives to architects and leading venue suppliers.\n\nSimply the best knowledge and networking event there is.\n\nOur Delegates\n\nOur attendee profile comprises:\n\nOwners, operators and investors in sports / entertainment venues;\n\nC-Level execs in teams / venues (President / GM / CEO, CEO, COO, CFO, CTO, CMO and Head of Depts);\n\nCity Councils / Municipalities / Regional Agencies (mayors, economic development, sports / recreation / leisure, arts / culture & tourism departments);\n\nSports Federations, Sports Clubs (professional and amateur), governing bodies, sports event bid committees, sports tourism officials etc;\n\nNational and regional Sports/Events bodies;\n\nEvents / Sponsors / Rightsholders;\n\nArchitects / Designers / Consultants;\n\nProduct & Service Suppliers to the venue sector.\n\nView latest Attendance updates here\n\nIngredients to Success\n\nThe Summit is a business networking event with a total focus on quality. That means quality attendance, quality content and quality connections. It is NOT a trade show but instead a Networking Event. We have developed a format to maximise connections over two days (and two nights).\n\nThe key elements to fostering learning and connections include:\n\nTHE CONFERENCE – 50+ expert industry speakers covering the topics you need to hear about, across multiple stages with dedicated tracks around Technology, Innovation and Transformation in design and development;\n\nTHE MARKETPLACE – Our dedicated networking area – where all refreshments and lunches are served – is ringed by a curated, mini-expo of 25-30 suppliers on ‘demo-pods’ showcasing the latest innovations and solutions;\n\nLISTEN HERE. BE THERE – Two places at once? Tune in to chosen conference tracks (in different parts of the Summit), whilst networking in another;\n\nNETWORKING & INTROS – Someone you want to meet? A venue you’d love to learn from? Let us know and we’ll do our best to make the introduction.\n\nAnd, as always, the Summit retains its ‘family vibe’ – bringing together old friends with new faces to the fold. Want to join us? Questions? Email us here\n\nVIP Guest Programme\n\nFree delegate passes to venues, teams and operators looking to #reimagine their business.\n\nFor more than a decade the Summit has gathered together the sector’s key thinkers, movers and shakers.\n\nOur VIP guest programme provides free delegate passes to teams, venues and leagues which we believe will add value, knowledge and experience to the Summit – and, in turn, take back to their organisations from their own attendance.\n\nDo you qualify for a free Guest VIP ticket?\n\nHere are the Guest VIP Programme requirements:\n\nYou are employed by a Venue, Team, or Operating company;\n\nYou are C-Level/Director or Senior Management;\n\nYou want to learn how to improve your venue operationally, increasing revenue and retention;\n\nYour organisation has not attended the Summit in the last three years.\n\nInterested? Get in touch with Angelina, who runs the VIP Guest Programme here.\n\nHere’s a sampling of organisations attending our previous summits:\n\nGoodwood Group\n\nECB – England and Wales Cricket Board\n\nChester Race Company\n\nLeicester City FC\n\nManchester Central Convention Complex\n\nLancs Cricket/Emirates Old Trafford\n\nEtihad Arena (Yas Bay)\n\nFC Copenhagen\n\nParc Olympique\n\nPZPN (Poland FA)\n\nFederation International de Volleyball\n\nManchester City FC\n\nScottish Event Campus\n\nPortsmouth FC\n\nBlackpool FC\n\nBristol Rovers FC\n\nEuroleague\n\nAdelaide Oval SMA\n\nSouthampton FC\n\nBristol Sport / Ashton Gate Stadium\n\nYork Stadium Management Company\n\nSpeakers - Panelists - Judges\n\nDo you have all the answers?
