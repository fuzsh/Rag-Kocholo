We are on track to sellout, lock in your ticket today.\n\nTrusts Arena terms and conditions: https://thetrustsarena.co.nz/conditions-of-entry/\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGlobal concert juggernauts INCUBUS and +LIVE+ are coming together for 2 huge shows - Christchurch, April 2nd and Auckland, April 4th, 2024.\n\nThis tour will see +LIVE+ and INCUBUS joined by New Zealand hottest 2-piece Midwave Breaks.\n\nThis show is all ages and is limited capacity. Lock in your ticket before sell out with Afterpay.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n+LIVE+ have sold over 23 million albums worldwide and earned two number one albums: Throwing Copper and Secret Samadhi. Their catalogue is filled with such gems as “Lightning Crashes,” “I Alone,” “All Over You” and “Lakini’s Juice,” which live on today as classics on rock radio.\n\nThrowing Copper will be celebrating its 30th anniversary in 2024. The seminal album produced the band’s biggest single, “Lightning Crashes,” which was No. 1 at Modern Rock radio for ten consecutive weeks. Rolling Stone honored the album with placement on their list, “1994: The 40 Best Records from Mainstream Alternative’s Greatest Year.”\n\nSecret Samadhi immediately shot to No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went double platinum. The release of the platinum-selling The Distance to Here turned +LIVE+ into an international powerhouse and moved the band from arenas into stadiums. The band released an acclaimed five-song EP in 2018, LOCAL 717, their first new music in over a decade.\n\nEd Kowalczyk “It has been way too long, and I couldn’t be happier that LIVE is finally returning to New Zealand for the first time in 22 years! The band and the show is so good and so strong and the fans who have seen it so far have been extremely happy! So, it was most definitely time to come and share it with our mates in New Zealand. And the icing on the cake is going to be sharing the stage with Incubus for the first time. I have always been a fan of their deep vibes, intellectual lyrics, and ground-breaking musical style. I think the pairing of our two bands is perfect in so many ways and I’m sure it will be a night to remember for all of the fans. See ya soon!”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSince first coming together in 1991, the Grammy nominated band, Incubus, have consistently elevated themselves and alternative music to new creative heights. The California band’s sales have eclipse 23 million albums worldwide to date with multi-platinum and platinum certifications from around the globe. Consistently topping the Billboard charts, the band has had five consecutive Top 5 debuts and they maintain their status as a streaming phenomenon, averaging 4.1 million monthly listeners on Spotify and clocking over 1 billion-plus streams across all platforms.\n\nSays Brandon Boyd “We’re excited to come back to New Zealand and see everyone! It’s been way too long so we’re looking forward to seeing old friends and making new friends LIVE has been a band we’ve always admired, so to share the stage with Ed and company will be something truly special. We can't wait!”\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMidwave Breaks music is a modern take on the soundtrack of their youth - epitomized by 80’s-90’s alternative rock/pop - evoking hints of Springsteen and Petty, Cornell and Vedder, and a melting pot of musical influences from past to present. The band features former Supergroove drummer, and West End ‘Stomp’",
