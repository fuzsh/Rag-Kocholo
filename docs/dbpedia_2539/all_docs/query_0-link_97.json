        "text": "Ever stepped inside a ballpark or football stadium and marveled at how many people can fit inside?\n\nNow those spaces are going to be put to another good use, with many arenas and stadiums across professional sports slated to be turned into polling centers on and before Election Day on Nov. 3.\n\nIn the 2016 election, according to Pew Research Center, just 55% of eligible Americans voted -- could the intersection of sports and politics lead to more voter turnout, even during the coronavirus pandemic?\n\n\"The potential for this kind of creativity is very high. People already trust brands like sports teams -- they have identity connections with them. That makes them trusted messengers in a way,\" Dr. Jonathan Metzl, director of Vanderbilt University's Center for Medicine, Health, and Society, told ESPN.\n\nFurther, Metzl noted that stadiums are safer than traditional polling places right now, \"because you can social distance, there's good airflow, you're not crammed in there. And so, from a public health perspective, stadiums are also potentially much safer.\"\n\nAlso, stadiums and arenas are usually close to public transportation systems, making it easier for voters to get to the location, Metzl added.\n\nHere are the arenas and stadiums across professional sports being turned into polling and voting centers:\n\nNFL\n\nAtlanta Falcons\n\nMercedes-Benz Stadium, 1 AMB Dr. NW, Atlanta, GA 30313.\n\nCapacity: 71,000.\n\nDetails: Unknown.\n\nCarolina Panthers\n\nBank of America Stadium, 800 S Mint St., Charlotte, NC 28202.\n\nCapacity: 75,412.\n\nDetails: From Oct. 15-31, Mecklenburg County voters can cast their ballots ahead of Election Day at the stadium.\n\nDetroit Lions\n\nFord Field, 2000 Brush St., Detroit, MI 48226.\n\nDetails: Ford Field will not be a place to cast ballots, but rather to check them.
