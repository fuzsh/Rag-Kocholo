        "text": "Post Malone\n\nThe Trusts Arena, Auckland, NZ\n\nJanuary 15th, 2018\n\n4/5 stars\n\nReviewed by DEBORAH GRACE HADY\n\nPhotographs by HAYLEY SMITH\n\nPost Malone’s sold out concert at the Trusts Arena proved the 22-year old knew how to party. Coming out to Too Young, the rapper wanted to prove that his number one single Rockstar wasn’t just all talk – he did a “shoey” 15 minutes into his short one-hour set.\n\nThe artist, whose real name is Austin Richard Post, kept the conversations flowing with the crowd. He spent much of the show making sure everyone in the mosh pit was okay, even skipping No Options after introducing it, to help a girl in the mosh out. He had the typical artist monologues describing his journey to success against all odds, and rejecting the haters who labelled him “culture vulture” and who said he would never make it. It was difficult not to root for the rather drunk braided hair artist.\n\nSometimes, it felt like his singing took a backseat for his guitar smashing, drinking and smoking. It was obvious that Malone was having a good time for and by himself, and he didn’t care whether his performance looked clean or perfect or even good. There was no denying that he knew how to pump up a crowd though. Malone had the crowds chanting and screaming his lyrics back at him. And when he sang, his distinct vocals showed why he had risen to global fame. The young rapper, who walks the line between singing and rapping, had a country/grunge feel to his R&B songs, making it difficult to fit him perfectly in a single genre.\n\nHe saved his radio-friendly popular singles for the end. Rockstar was a good time, despite him skipping 21 Savage’s verses. He finished the song by smashing a guitar on stage, which felt like the only planned and rehearsed moment in his set. The crowd lapped up White Iverson, the single that catapulted him from an unknown into the sold-out act he is now, singing back his lyrics without needing a backing track.\n\nCongratulations had everyone hyped, but all too soon, Post Malone had left the stage, and the lights came on. There were no pyrotechnics, fireworks, or confetti exploding out – his wasn’t a well-rehearsed performance hidden behind fancy stage gimmicks, but just his own determination to embody his Rockstar persona.\n\nClick here to view the full collection of photos by HAYLEY SMITH.\n\nDEBORAH GRACE HADY is still waiting for Peter Pan to take her to Neverland. Meanwhile, she’s either sipping on hot cocoa with marshmallows or scrolling through Tumblr.\n\nHAYLEY SMITH is a blogger, pun and Marmite lover. Master of Snapchat.
