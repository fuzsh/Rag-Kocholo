        "text": "Trusts Stadium Arena on 27 February 2013\n\nMcManus Entertainment is excited to announce that Ronan Keating will be returning to New Zealand for one special night of entertainment at Auckland’s The Trusts Stadium Arena on 27 February 2013.\n\nJoining Ronan will be very special guest, good friend and fellow Irishman, former Westlife frontman Brian McFadden.\n\nTickets go on sale on Tuesday, 27 November at 9am\n\nwith Eventfinder.co.nz.\n\n“I’m thrilled that Ronan is performing in New Zealand next year,” says promoter Andrew McManus. “I can’t wait to see what mischief he and Brian get up to! The lads are going to put on a great show … to be sure!”\n\nAs a solo artist Ronan Keating has sold more than 25 million records worldwide, alongside 30 million records with Boyzone. Add this to Brian McFadden’s sales of 40 million records worldwide and that’s a serious amount of records the two artists have sold between them.\n\nRonan’s soulful pop voice has won him millions of fans around the world and New Zealand is no exception. As one of the X-Factor’s most popular mentors, he is a regular visitor to New Zealand.\n\n“I can’t wait to play songs from my new album Fires to my Kiwi fans,” Ronan says. “And to go on tour with one of my best mates is just a bonus!”\n\nApart from Ronan’s incredible work with Boyzone, he has had an extensive solo career. After Boyzone’s 1995 hit with Father and Son, Ronan burst back onto the charts in 1999 with the smash hit When You Say Nothing At All. This was followed with more hits, including Life Is a Rollercoaster, Lovin’ Each Day, If Tomorrow Never Comes and his latest single Fires. In 2009, Ronan released the poignant Songs For My Mother (recorded in memory of his late mother).\n\nBrian McFadden -- the popular judge from Australia’s Got Talent – became a household name through Westlife. Since leaving the band, Brian has gone on to carve out a successful solo career, with hits including Almost Here and Just Say So. In 2008 Brian released Set In Stone and has just released his brand new studio album The Irish Connection which sees Brian record some of his favourite tracks with some of his favourite artists, including his very good friend, and touring partner, Ronan Keating!\n\n“My favourite thing to do is perform,” says Brian. “I can’t wait to play some new songs, some old songs and some classic favourites in New Zealand.”\n\nLinks\n\neventfinder.co.nz/2013/r...\n\nTags\n\nacoustic/solo, alternative, art/noise, pop, Ronan Keating, Brian McFadden\n\nSubscribe/Follow Us\n\nDon’t miss a thing!
