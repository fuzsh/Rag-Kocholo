        "text": "(InvestigateTV) — Despite inflation and rising costs, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons reported a 5% increase in plastic surgery last year, but not all customers were happy with their results.\n\nMelanie McGovern with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) said they have received many complaints about “Goals Aesthetics & Plastic Surgery,” which has more than a dozen locations in the U.S.\n\n“Some of the consumers that reported to us claimed that when they had a surgical appointment, it was canceled, procedures weren’t done, they were done incomplete or the appropriate medical clearances weren’t obtained, or they encountered difficulty receiving refunds,” McGovern said. “That’s why they came to the Better Business Bureau to get some kind of recourse.”\n\nThe BBB received complaints about this business from across the country – including Alabama, California, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Tennessee.\n\n“Some of the complaints are in the thousands of dollars,” McGovern said. “A lot of these procedures are out of pocket expenses. So, you know, people will pay thousands of dollars for it. So yes, some of the complaints are in the $1,000 range.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, a spokesperson for Goals said, in part, their terms and conditions “include specific deadlines and conditions under which refunds are processed” and that their goal is to “process refunds promptly and fairly.” They added that “there are instances where we believe patients might overlook or ignore these policies, inadvertently slowing down the refund process.”\n\n“We recognize the frustration this can cause and are continually working to improve our communication channels and internal processes to better serve our patients’ needs,” they continued.\n\nThe company’s full statement can be read at the bottom of this story.\n\nThe BBB said because of the lack of response to complaints and requests it has given Goals an “F” rating.\n\n“What we see is the same complaint over and over,” McGovern said. “We’ll reach out to the company, ask them to address it and in this case, they did not respond.”\n\nIn an email after this article was published, a Goals spokesperson said they do respond but, \"they cannot formally give responses to patient information or even acknowledge the reports with [sic] having a HIPAA release signed and sent to us from the patient and not the BBB.”\n\nGoals further claimed they have an “F” rating by not working with the BBB.\n\nAs far as general tips for those looking to have a procedure done, McGovern said to look at sites, like the BBB, to see if a company has a record of complaints and what other consumers are saying.\n\nShe added to read the fine print before agreeing to any procedures and make sure to understand any and all payment options.\n\n“Read the contract thoroughly to understand what the refund policy is,” she said. “You know, do they take insurance? Do they not take insurance? You know, asking for recommendations, searching the BBB website.”\n\nMcGovern also said it’s important to report any potential wrongdoings.\n\n“We always encourage consumers to not only check with BBB, but let us know what’s going on,” McGovern commented. “Even if you don’t lose money, we want those reports, we want that information so that we can build a file to let other people know, hey, this is what the consumer’s experience is with this.”\n\nFull statement from Goals Aesthetics & Plastic Surgery:\n\nGreetings, Ms. Jackman,\n\nWe would like to first, Thank you for reaching out to us. I hope you’re doing well today. We appreciate the opportunity to address the concerns raised regarding one of our esteemed clients, Goals Aesthetics & Plastic Surgery. While we are aware that our legal counsel advised you that we cannot comment on specific patient issues, we appreciate this opportunity to address misinformation, in general, with the refund policy of the Goals Aesthetics and Plastic Surgery® branded medical practices and management company. As such, we believe it’s important that we release a statement that underscores both our commitment to ensuring the highest level of care and satisfaction for our clients and their patrons.\n\nAs a premier public relations agency, The Jamison Agency has always been dedicated to fostering positive relationships and clear understanding between our clients and their respective audiences. Our latest initiative aims to address concerns from the heart, making sure that every voice is heard, and every issue is resolved efficiently.\n\nAddressing the Concerns\n\nThe specific concerns highlighted involve the protocols and policies adhered to by Goals Aesthetics & Plastic Surgery® with respect to refund policies.\n\nSurgical Protocols and Policies\n\nTransparency in our operations extends to our refund policies, which are clearly stated in our terms and conditions – which is provided to all patients and is publicly available for review on our website. These include specific deadlines and conditions under which refunds are processed. Our goal is to process refunds promptly and fairly, ensuring that every patient understands and agrees to these terms before undergoing any procedure, and ensuring consistency among all patients/clients such that everyone is treated fairly, equally, and without special treatment in any way.\n\nHowever, there are instances where we believe patients might overlook or ignore these policies, inadvertently slowing down the refund process. We recognize the frustration this can cause and are continually working to improve our communication channels and internal processes to better serve our patients’ needs. However, ultimately, Goals Aesthetics and Plastic Surgery® is transparent as to the situations of when, and under what circumstances refunds may be provided – in whole or in part. Indeed, we maintain a policy which is in line with other similar medical practices or management companies in the industry and take into consideration the specialized nature of elective cosmetic procedures.\n\nCommitment to Improvement\n\nNotwithstanding what we believe is transparency in our refund policy, we understand that nobody is perfect and in every situation there is always room for improvement. The Jamison Agency and Goals Aesthetics & Plastic Surgery® believe in transparent communication as cornerstones of effective public relations. Our commitment extends to both our clients and their audiences. We are dedicated to:\n\n1. Enhanced Communication:\n\nImproving the clarity and accessibility of our communication channels to ensure that all policies are well-understood and adhered to by patients. This involves regular updates, easy-to-understand documentation, and readily available support for any queries patients may have.\n\n2. Process Optimization:\n\nStreamlining our processes to ensure faster, fairer, and more transparent handling of all patient interactions, including refund requests. This includes leveraging technology to respond to inquiries and to ensure timely responses.\n\n3. Empathetic Response:\n\nAddressing every concern with empathy and understanding. We are not merely responding to complaints- we are actively seeking to understand the root cause and providing solutions that reflect our commitment to patient care and satisfaction.\n\nOur Continuing Actions Towards Being the Best and Most Transparent National Aesthetics and Plastic Surgery Practices\n\nGoals Aesthetics & Plastic Surgery® is focused on ensuring that every patient receives the highest level of care and satisfaction. This means not only continuing to adhere to strict protocols and policies but also being responsive and adaptive to the needs of the patients including identifying points of improvement. As a result of our commitment, Goals Aesthetics & Plastic Surgery® strives to provide ongoing support, to ensure that all concerns are addressed promptly and effectively. Our drive is to foster trust, transparency, and a positive experience for all patients of all branded medical practices..\n\nWe hope this statement not only addresses the current concerns but also serves as a testament to our unwavering commitment to excellence and transparency. Thank you for your continued trust in Goals Aesthetics & Plastic Surgery® .\n\nBest regards,\n\nThe Jamison Agency Team ###"
