They will either be able to rectify the situation straight away or refer the problem to Customer Services, located at the Hunts Banks entrance on the concourse.\n\nIf you encounter an issue which is making your experience less enjoyable, please report it to a steward or member of staff as soon as possible so we can try our best to make things better.\n\nHere at the AO Arena, every aspect of food safety is of the highest importance. We take every care to ensure that you can eat safely whilst visiting our venues.\n\nIn addition to strict hygiene procedures, we have embarked upon an extensive allergen awareness campaign. This includes high levels of staff training, and implementation of policies, procedures and processes, in line with the Food Information Regulations.\n\nWe are continually reviewing and improving every aspect of our Food Safety Strategy, this includes ensuring up to date information on allergens is shared with our teams, reducing the possibility for allergen exposure."
