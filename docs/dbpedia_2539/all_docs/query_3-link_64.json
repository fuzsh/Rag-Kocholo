        "text": "August 05, 2024\n\nCINCINNATI – The University of Cincinnati football program returned to Higher Ground Conference and Retreat Center for the 26th season in a row this week.\n\nHigher Ground Training Camp is presented by TQL.\n\nThe Bearcats' first workout at Higher Ground, which is located just across the Ohio-Indiana border, was on Sunday. They'll remain at the camp for nearly two full weeks – broken apart by a practice halfway through at Nippert Stadium.\n\nUC will suit up for its first fully-padded practice on Tuesday.\n\n\"There was a lot of competitive spirit out there today,\" Head Coach Scott Satterfield said. \"We feel like we have a much more connected team this year, which is obviously what we all want even though we brought in so many new players. It's a great group, it's a fun group to be around. You look forward to going to meetings and getting out on the field because you know they're eager. You can see it in their eyes, they want to keep getting better.\"\n\nThe large contingent of new scholarship players, 47 to be exact, are experiencing their first Higher Ground camp. They seem to be all-in and soaking in every moment.\n\n\"They're such great kids,\" Satterfield said. \"They're saying 'we trust you coach, that's why we're coming here. Whatever you're asking of us we'll do it'. We talked to them about why we're coming out here and about getting rid of distractions and they have welcomed it since day one. They want to get better, they want to be good football players.\"\n\nOne newcomer, redshirt junior tight end Joe Royer, is at his first Higher Ground camp since transferring to UC from Ohio State. A big target at 6-5, Royer will have an opportunity to earn plenty of targets in 2024.\n\n\"I like it out here,\" Royer said regarding his first impressions of Higher Ground. \"I'm an older guy so I've been to a few fall camps and understand the mental and physical aspect of it. It's been great for me so far, this is a place where we have no distractions and we can fully concentrate on football. I love how everything is right here, I can wake up and walk to breakfast, meetings, and on to practice.\"\n\nA Cincinnati native, Royer was a first-team all-state performer at Elder High School before playing four seasons at Ohio State.\n\n// EIGHT BEARCATS NAMED PRESEASON ALL-BIG 12 BY COLLEGE FOOTBALL NETWORK\n\nCollege Football Network released its Preseason All-Big 12 awards on Monday and eight Bearcats received recognitions. Luke Kandra and Mason Fletcher received the biggest accolades, receiving Big 12 Preseason Guard of the Year and Punter of the Year, respectively. Both players were also named preseason first-team all-conference by CFN. Corey Kiner, Dontay Corleone, and Carter Brown all earned second-team honors, Xzavier Henderson and John Williams were named to the third team, and Gavin Gerhardt was picked to the fourth team.\n\n// HELP US KEEP THE STREAK ALIVE, BUY TICKETS TODAY\n\nUC ranks among the Top 25 winningest programs in the country over the last 10 years and Nippert Stadium's incredible homefield advantage is a major reason why. Help the Bearcats keep their streak of 18 consecutive Nippert Stadium sellouts alive by becoming a season ticket member HERE.\n\nSeason tickets are fans' best chance for best seats to cheer on the Bearcats. However, single-game tickets are on sale now (starting as low as $30) Towson (Aug. 31) and Pitt (Sept. 7).\n\nLed by head coach Scott Satterfield, Cincinnati enters its second season in the Big 12 this fall. In 2023, the Bearcats ranked fifth in the country in rushing and return 1,000-yard rusher Corey Kiner and their entire offensive line. Cincinnati also brings back All-Americans: right guard Luke Kandra, nose tackle Dontay \"The Godfather\" Corleone and punter Mason Fletcher.\n\nA pair of historic rivalries return to Nippert Stadium with Pitt coming to town for the first time since 2012 and West Virginia heading to the Queen City for the first time since Isaiah Pead led the Bearcats to a 24-21 victory in 2009. Cincinnati will also open the season against Towson, host Arizona State for the first-time ever and TCU for the first time since 2004. Additionally, Houston returns to Nippert Stadium for the first time since the Bearcats' 35-20 victory in the 2021 AAC Championship.\n\nThe complete 2024 Cincinnati football schedule can be found here: Web | Printable\n\nRelated Videos\n\nNow Playing:"
