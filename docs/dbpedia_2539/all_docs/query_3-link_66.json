        "text": "Music star Pitbull soon will have his name on Florida International’s football stadium under a sponsorship agreement announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Panthers will play at Pitbull Stadium for five years as part of a $6 million agreement, according to FIU board of trustees documents. The deal starts this month. Pitbull will have an option to renew the agreement for another five years at the same price.\n\nAthletic director Scott Carr announced the deal Tuesday as something “unique to the 305 (area code), with a worldwide brand.”\n\n“This is history in the making ...” Pitbull — whose real name is Armando Christian Perez — said during the announcement. “We’re going to take it to a whole other level like we always do but for the right reasons.”\n\nOther notable terms included in the trustees documents:\n\n• Pitbull will be called the “official entrepreneur of FIU athletics” and will be able to use the stadium for 10 days each year without paying the standard rental fee.\n\n• His vodka company, Voli 305, will be the stadium’s preferred brand.\n\n• A “Pitbull-affiliated performer” will be able to perform at games.\n\n• Pitbull will help promote the school and athletic department, with an “FIU Anthem” included as one possibility.\n\nThe 64-page contract, obtained Tuesday by the Tampa Bay Times, includes a few other nuggets about the partnership. Possible promotions include: co-branded merchandise between the artist and school; giveaways, performances or behind-the-scenes footage that could be exclusive to FIU; Pitbull wearing FIU gear during his concerts or events or featuring the school or Panthers apparel in his music videos “at Celebrity’s discretion.” The contract suggests Q&A sessions with business or music students and a chat with the school’s 400-plus athletes, and Pitbull will be the presenting sponsor of the program’s Vice Night.\n\nFootball programs will include a two-page spread of the Miami native in its first 10 pages. The ESPN+ football games produced by the school will include 30-second spots provided by the artist and his team (but approved by the school). Students from his SLAM charter school academy will be involved in internships and radio opportunities.\n\nPitbull and his team will have the “sole and exclusive right to obtain” sponsorship rights to parts of the stadium, like the student section or video board. The university has the right to fill any sponsorship holes and split the proceeds equally with Pitbull. Local youth will receive 650 general-admission season tickets per year.\n\nThe 43-year-old Pitbull has been involved in sports in other ways. He’s the co-owner of NASCAR’s Trackhouse Racing team.\n\nThe Panthers’ home venue had been known as FIU Stadium.\n\n• • •\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida."
