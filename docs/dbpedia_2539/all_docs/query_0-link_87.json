        "text": "Manchester Co-op Live is the UK's biggest indoor arena - but it had been beset by problems before it even opened.\n\nA slew of gigs have been postponed or moved from the Â£365m venue, which can accommodate 23,500 people.\n\nA preview gig by singer Rick Astley was the first occasion where audiences were inside. But even then, capacity was slashed just before it was due to start.\n\nComedian Peter Kay was supposed to be the first official act on 23 April - but his performances were rescheduled and since then there has been a domino of events being pushed back.\n\nThe troubled venue opened on 14 May with a performance from Elbow.\n\nLess than two weeks later, another show was postponed - but not because of issues with the building.\n\nNicki Minaj's concert was postponed at the last minute after she was arrested hours earlier in the Netherlands.\n\nSky News looks at what has happened, what was behind the delays to opening, and what event ticketholders should do.\n\nWhat events have been affected?\n\nOlivia Rodrigo\n\nUS singer Olivia Rodrigo's sold-out performances scheduled for 3 and 4 May were postponed.\n\nHer Co-op Live gigs were two of the 10 UK dates on her European and US tour. The new dates are yet to be announced.\n\nBoogie Wit Da Hoodie\n\nThe US rapper's gig on 1 May was cancelled at the last minute, with fans already gathered outside.\n\nDoors were supposed to open at 6.30pm for an 8pm start. But a \"venue-related technical issue\" meant fans were told - via a post on the venue's X account at 6.40pm - that the gig would not go ahead.\n\nTake That\n\nTake That have moved their upcoming gigs to Manchester's AO Arena after the problems at Co-op Live.\n\nAll of their Manchester shows in May have been moved and were on the same dates as before apart from 8 May, which was switched to 9 May.\n\nBut the British pop group are still planning to go ahead with two June dates at Co-op Live.\n\nBarry Manilow\n\nBarry Manilow said he had booked another venue as a \"back up plan\" for his date at Co-op Live on 19 May.\n\nHe said the rival AO Arena had been booked for the same date if Co-op Live was not ready - but the concert went ahead.\n\nKeane\n\nBritish rock band Keane were due to play at the venue on 5 May, but said they were \"absolutely gutted\" to cancel the gig because of \"ongoing technical issues beyond our control\".\n\nTheir gig has been rescheduled for 19 October.\n\nRick Astley\n\nRick Astley's performance on 20 April was a \"test event\" for the venue but ticket capacity was slashed just hours before his gig was due to begin.\n\nHe did perform at the arena and there were reports on social media that the event was a success.\n\nAstley fans who had their tickets cancelled were instead offered seats to see US rock band The Black Keys play - but their show was also affected.\n\nThe Black Keys\n\nThe Black Keys' show was rescheduled for 15 May after their original gig on 27 April was cancelled.\n\nPeter Kay\n\nPeter Kay, who was scheduled to be the first performer at the venue, was forced to postpone his two shows for a second time.\n\nHis first performances on 23 and 24 April had to be postponed with less than 48 hours' notice and instead took place on 23 and 24 May.\n\nHe said it was \"very disappointing but your safety is important, and I won't compromise that\".\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nThe American singer and rapper, 41, was held at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on suspicion of possession of soft drugs on 25 May - just hours before she was set to take to the stage in Manchester.\n\nFans had been let into the venue despite the star's detention.\n\nA post on the arena's X account said shortly after 5.15pm: \"Please note that general admission and premium doors for tonight's Nicki Minaj show will now open at 19:00.\"\n\nShe was released shortly before 9pm, but concert-goers were told after 9.30pm that the concert had been postponed.\n\nWhat's behind the problems with the building?\n\nThe issue is with the building's heating, ventilation and air conditioning system.\n\nDuring the soundcheck for the Boogie Wit Da Hoodie gig, a component of the venue's heating and ventilation system separated from the ductwork.\n\nVenue bosses said while they thought it was \"an isolated incident caused by a factory defect\", they needed to inspect all the similar nozzles.\n\nIn a statement on 10 May, Co-op Live said it was \"satisfied\" after an inspection found the issue was an \"isolated manufacturing default\".\n\nðŸ‘‰ Listen above then tap here to follow the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcastsðŸ‘ˆ\n\nWhat should ticketholders do?\n\nOlivia Rodrigo fans were told they could either hold on to their tickets for a rescheduled performance - with dates yet to be announced - or request a refund.\n\nRefunds will also be available to ticketholders for other rescheduled events if they cannot make the new date.\n\nFans will be contacted by their ticketseller about new dates and will be able to request a refund through them.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\n\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\nUS-based venue operator Oak View Group said organisers would work with music managers and promoters to \"limit the impact on the opening season schedule\".\n\n\"Where necessary, we will identify alternate dates, and will continually reassess to provide fans with sufficient notice regarding imminent shows.\n\n\"Should shows be cancelled or rescheduled, fans will be contacted by their point of purchase and offered a full refund where preferred.\"\n\nRead more entertainment news:\n\nEamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford announce divorce\n\nJudge rejects Alec Baldwin's request to dismiss charge over Rust shooting\n\nNicki Minaj's gig will be moved to a later date with a statement from promoters Live Nation saying: \"Tickets will remain valid for the rescheduled performance which will be announced ASAP.\"\n\nWhat else have the groups behind the venue said?\n\nThe arena's general manager Gary Roden announced his resignation in April following the slew of issues.\n\nTim Leiweke, chairman and chief executive of Oak View Group which developed Co-op Live in partnership with the City Football Group, said they could not run any event until it was \"absolutely safe to do so\".\n\n\"It was a very unexpected situation but without a doubt the right decision. I deeply apologise for the impact that this has had on ticketholders and fans,\" Mr Leiweke said.\n\nA Co-op Group spokesperson said: \"As naming rights sponsor for Co-op Live we are disappointed with these further schedule changes.\n\n\"Co-op is a sponsor and does not own or run the venue, and we have made it clear to Oak View Group, who are responsible for the building, that the impact on ticketholders must be addressed as a priority.\""
