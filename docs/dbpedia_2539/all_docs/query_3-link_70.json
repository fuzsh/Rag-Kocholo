        "text": "Marcus Bowman\n\n(BUS ’06, ’10G)\n\nNearly 20 years later, Marcus Bowman can still remember the moment when he received an offer to join Pitt Athletics.\n\nWhile traveling in Europe with his then girlfriend (now wife) following their graduation from Pitt in 2006, Bowman received an email from Donna Sanft, then his alma mater’s executive associate athletic director, who he had known during his time as a student and men’s basketball player. A position in the business office of the Pitt Department of Athletics had opened up, and she wanted to know if he would be interested.\n\nIt was the metaphorical open door that led Bowman to a successful career working in college sports administration. He’s now in his fourth year as the deputy athletic director for business strategy and chief financial officer at the University of Oklahoma.\n\nWorking under Joe Castiglione, one of the country’s longest tenured and most respected athletic directors, Bowman oversees the Sooners’ fiscal and business strategy, the development and monitoring of operating and capital budgets, and the university’s transition from the Big 12 Conference to the Southeastern Conference, among other responsibilities.\n\n“I kind of always thought if I could combine my love and passion for sports with my educational background in school—which was business and finance—that I would have a career and a profession, not just a job,” Bowman says. “There’s a difference between the two.”\n\nThose dual loves Bowman referenced were fortified at Pitt, where he earned a degree in business administration on a full academic scholarship while playing four seasons with the Panthers basketball team from 2002 to 2006, when it was one of the sport’s dominant programs nationally. With his business background, he was offered a job at PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., where he had interned the summer between his junior and senior years, but once the opportunity with Pitt Athletics arose, he began doubting whether he wanted to spend the rest of his life as a banker.\n\nUltimately, he interviewed for and was offered the position Sanft had emailed him about and began working for Pitt Athletics as its director of business operations.\n\n“To have the opportunity for your first job to work at your alma mater in sports—to say that was a dream come true, that probably would be an understatement,” Bowman says. “It meant everything.”\n\nWorking with many people with whom he had a preexisting relationship, Bowman immersed himself in his new role. It was an educational experience. Though he had been an athlete, Bowman admittedly had no idea of everything that went into events he once took for granted, like hosting a basketball or football game. Wanting to learn more, Bowman says that he became “a sponge,” regularly volunteering himself for tasks outside his job description.\n\nThat drive helped him to earn a series of promotions, culminating in the position of senior associate athletic director for sport administration. Though he left Pitt in December 2017 for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he spent three years as the senior associate athletic director and chief financial officer before moving on to Oklahoma, Pitt remains close to his heart.\n\n“My time working at Pitt, it was life changing,” he says. “It set me up for so much. Pittsburgh, the city, is just amazing. I met my wife there. I got married. Two of my kids were born there. It will always have a special place in my family’s heart. I still root like hell for them. I want to see them do so well and be so successful in everything they do. I’ll always be a Pitt Panther.”\n\nKatie O’Rourke\n\n(CGS ’14, BUS ’16G)\n\nKatie O’Rourke is no stranger to pressure.\n\nA Pitt gymnast from 2010 to 2014, O’Rourke was regularly asked to pull off athletic feats that are unimaginable to the average person while upholding the lofty expectations she had for herself. If you can successfully land a flip on a 4-inch-wide balance beam, virtually any other challenge that gets thrown your way seems easy by comparison.\n\nIt’s those experiences that she carries with her in her current position as the senior manager of game presentation for the Washington Nationals.\n\n“It puts it all back into perspective,” O’Rourke says. “It really kind of molded me into who I am [in that I was] able to take those seconds to realize, OK, something might have gone wrong, but where can we pivot to fix it, not freak out about it, and keep our cool? Having that background has helped me tremendously in this role.”\n\nAfter receiving an ACC postgraduate scholarship following a gymnastics career in which she competed at the NCAA regional championships three times, O’Rourke continued at Pitt, earning her MBA while working in the athletics department. During that time, her next step in life became clear.\n\n“I knew I wanted to work in sports, and I knew I liked marketing, but I just didn’t know past that about the ins and outs of what actually exists within the sports world,” she says. “That [earning an MBA while working in Pitt Athletics] opened my eyes.”\n\nThe Springfield, Virginia, native moved back home to the Washington, D.C., area after earning her MBA and began working part time in partnerships for Monumental Sports & Entertainment, the company that owns the Washington Wizards, Washington Capitals and Washington Mystics. In 2017, she joined the Nationals, with whom she assumed her current role in March 2024, after working part time for years.\n\nWith the Nationals, who won the World Series in 2019 while she was with the organization, O’Rourke balances a variety of tasks. She oversees the NatPack, the entertainment team that selects fans at the ballpark to play games and hands out free swag like t-shirts. She works with the Nationals’ racing presidents—like the pierogy race at PNC Park, only with people wearing costumes of former U.S. heads of state—bullpen cart drivers, ball girls and mascot handlers, the last of whom are jokingly referred to as “the secret service.” She books singers to perform the national anthem and “God Bless America.” She even works with the military to coordinate stadium flyovers for special games.\n\nIf it sounds like a lot, it’s because it is. How, exactly, does O’Rourke do it? The answer can be traced back to her Pitt gymnastics career. As a gymnast, O’Rourke said she was taught to have a “goldfish brain,” a short memory that doesn’t allow her to be inflated by past success or weighed down by recent failures. Along with that, she routinely thinks back to a slogan the Panthers had during her time with them: “commitment, teamwork and pride,” all traits and ideals she works every day to embody both personally and professionally.\n\n“I kind of had to jump in with both feet and drink from the fire hose, but in this industry, I feel like that’s how you learn,” O’Rourke says. “Being able to keep my cool, I credit all of that to being an athlete and everything I learned at Pitt.”\n\nCarly Thea\n\n(A&S ’15)\n\nThis summer, the best athletes from around the world will descend on Paris, France, for the 2024 Summer Olympics, where track and field will be among the most closely monitored sports for fans in the United States and beyond. As American athletes showcase themselves to the world by sprinting 100 meters to potential glory or using a pole to launch themselves as high as 20 feet in the air, Carly Thea will be maintaining some connection to them.\n\nAs senior manager of business development and partnerships for USA Track & Field (USATF), she works diligently to elevate the sport while leaning on the valuable lessons she learned in her time as a college athlete.\n\n“Accountability, teamwork and hard work—you learn all of those things from being a college athlete,” Thea says. “You have to be accountable for yourself on the field [and] off the field, getting all your schoolwork done while still performing on the field and playing the role you need to play for your team.\""
