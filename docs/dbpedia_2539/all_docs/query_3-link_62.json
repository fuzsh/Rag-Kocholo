        "text": "30 January 2018\n\nFly Palmy Arena the new name for Arena 2\n\nA signwriter puts the finishing touches to the Fly Palmy branding on the newly named Fly Palmy Arena. The new name comes into effect 1 February.\n\nPalmerston North Airport and Central Energy Trust Arena are a mutual destination for thousands of regional visitors each year. In recognition of this, and to support locally hosted sports tournaments and events, Fly Palmy has entered into a sponsorship relationship with the Central Energy Trust Arena.\n\nFrom 1 February, Arena 2 will be known as Fly Palmy Arena. The finishing touches of the dynamic Fly Palmy logo are being added to the exterior of the Pascal Street Arena. Fly Palmy Arena is the largest indoor venue at Central Energy Trust Arena.\n\nPalmerston North Airport Chief Executive Officer David Lanham says, “We are excited about the relationship formed with the Central Energy Trust Arena. Both our organisations have a major role to play in promoting inbound tourism, including events that will be held in the newly branded Fly Palmy Arena, and so our partnership makes very good sense”.\n\nFly Palmy Arena is set for a busy year. One of the premier events is the launch of the ANZ Premiership Netball Super Sunday on 6 May. In March, the National Secondary Schools Volleyball Championships are being hosted and in April, the NBL Blitz pre-season tournament. As well as sports events, major exhibitions include the popular Women’s Lifestyle Expo in May and the Manawatu Home Show in July.\n\nPNCC Venues and Events Manager John Lynch says, “Our newly formed partnership with Fly Palmy highlights the local commitment to making Palmerston North a regional hub for sport and events. We’re extremely excited to have formed this relationship and look forward to collaborating with Fly Palmy in many aspects of the business.”\n\nEnds"
