        "text": "September 8: Jason Raibley (University of Kansas)\n\nIn person only, DLC1B65\n\n\"Hurka's Critique of Well-being\"\n\nIn a recent article, Thomas Hurka argues that well-being \"makes no substantive contribution to ethics.\" This is true, he says, so long as we understand well-being as an evaluative concept, and one that is irreducible to Moorean intrinsic value (e.g., what is \"simply good\" and a state of a person and desired by them). Hurka first argues that common-sense does not unambiguously feature the concept of well-being, because ordinary uses of \"good for\" may instead concern a \"purely descriptive\" concept, while ordinary uses of \"well-being\" might concern a Moorean concept. Given this, he says, there is not sufficient warrant to posit well-being as a distinct normative concept, provided that one already accepts the existence of the \"simply good.\" For one can do all the important normative work with the concept of \"simply good.\" I argue (1) that Hurka's conception of \"evaluative concepts\" may be so narrow as to trivialize his argument, (2) that his alternative — i.e.,\"purely descriptive\" and Moorean — interpretations of welfare-discourse are implausible and require bad philosophy of language, and (3) that there are many facts concerning what people have justifying reason to do – and what it is appropriate for them to hope, wish, fear, and feel – that cannot be captured on a Moorean view. Perhaps Hurka's arguments give a committed Moorean non-naturalist who is a proud ideal utilitarian about the \"just-plain-ought\" – and also a \"welfarist\" – reason to economize and drop their welfarism. The rest of us can ignore them. (Note: this paper is based in part on previous collaborative work with Guy Fletcher, Brad Cokelet, and Dale Dorsey).\n\nSeptember 15: Brian Talbot (CU Boulder)\n\nIn person only, UMC 247\n\n\"If there can't be practical reasons for belief, then there must be practical reasons for belief\"\n\nThere's a debate about whether there are practical reasons for belief. E.g. let's say believing x makes you happy; does that give you some kind of reason to believe x? I am interested in this debate because (I think) it requires us to examine what reasons are \"for,\" and why it matters whether or not something is a reason. In this talk, I address a very influential form of argument against practical reasons for belief. Basically, the argument starts with the claim that our beliefs are not responsive in \"the right way\" to practical benefits (different philosophers have different views of what \"the right way\" means). For example, it is claimed that practical benefits can only indirectly cause us to believe things. Because of that, the arguments go, these benefits don't count as reasons for belief. Those who disagree typically argue that our beliefs are responsive in the relevant way. But that's not my approach. I want to grant that our beliefs are not responsive in these ways. I argue that, because of this unresponsiveness, practical benefits are reasons for belief. To see why, we have to think about why reasons are supposed to be normatively important.\n\nSeptember 22: Alastair Norcross (CU Boulder)\n\nIn person, UMC 247, and on Zoom\n\n“Conservatism: Political and Moral”\n\nMy main concern in this paper is a particular version of political conservatism, which is roughly what theorists refer to as “Burkean Conservatism” or “Traditionalist Conservatism”. The central claim I want to examine is that social/societal/cultural traditions have a (probably defeasible) moral value. One way to think of this is in terms of burden of proof. The burden of proof is on the person who wants to change or eliminate a tradition. Traditions are innocent until proven guilty. In fact, they are not just innocent, but positively worthy. I am not talking about a view which claims that there is positive value in having traditions in general, but doesn’t say anything about whether existing traditions are the ones we should have, as opposed to any other set of traditions. My concern is with the view that says, of the traditions that currently exist, that their status as traditions is prima facie justification for preserving them. For my purposes in this paper, I will simply call this view about the value of traditions “Traditionalist Conservatism” or TC. I’m not claiming that that is how the term is used by political philosophers in general, or even any others. I don’t find terminological disputes very interesting. Although the political version of this thesis is my main concern, if time permits, I will explain what I take to be some interesting parallels in the realm of normative morality.\n\nSeptember 29: Robert Pasnau (CU Boulder)\n\nIn person, UMC 247, and on Zoom\n\n\"Why Can’t Mary Sin?”\n\nSuppose there is an all-powerful being who has decided that it is for the best that some perfectly ordinary human being should be unable to sin. But—-and this is the tricky part—-that ordinary human being must also be meritorious in her actions. Can someone be unable to sin and yet be morally praiseworthy? Could even an all-powerful being bring about that state of affairs? I will consider how William Ockham, in the Middle Ages, attempted to answer those questions in the affirmative.\n\nOctober 13: Molly Gardner (University of Florida)\n\nIn person, UMC 386, and on Zoom\n\n“Why the Numbers Don't Count, But the Reasons Do”\n\nThe numbers problem arises in cases where we can save a large group of people or a small group of people, but we cannot save both groups. Famously, John Taurek has argued against the claim that we ought to save the larger number. Taurek’s judgment runs contrary to common sense, but he is right that there are difficulties with various attempts to justify the judgment that, if there are no other relevant differences between the groups, we ought to save the larger one. The consequentialist approach is to appeal to aggregation: we add together the gains and losses of the two groups and determine that the overall outcome will be better if we save the larger number. But this consequentialist approach stands in tension with the principles that we ought to respect the separateness of persons and, if we ought to respect the separateness of persons, then aggregation is impermissible. Taking a non-consequentialist approach, Frances Kamm and Thomas Scanlon argue that we can justify saving the larger number without appealing to aggregation. Nevertheless, as Fiona Woollard has pointed out, the Kamm/Scanlon solution to the numbers problem does not explain the significance of numbers in trolley cases. In this paper, I offer a new solution to the numbers problem. I reject the claim that if the separateness of persons matters, then aggregation is impermissible. Instead, I argue that we can aggregate and respect the separateness of persons, as long as we aggregate reasons for acting, rather than gains or losses to individuals. This approach, which I call the “aggregating reasons view,” not only solves the numbers problem, but it also yields a surprising solution to the trolley problem.\n\nOctober 20: David Boonin (CU Boulder)\n\nIn person, MUEN E130, and on Zoo\n\n“Does CCTV-Enabled Mass Public Surveillance Violate the Right to Privacy?”\n\nJesper Ryberg has argued that CCTV-enabled mass public surveillance does not violate people’s right to privacy. In this talk, I will present a version of Ryberg’s argument, defend the argument from a variety of objections (including some that Ryberg overlooks or underestimates), and comment on the significance of the argument’s conclusion.\n\nOctober 27: Julia Staffel (CU Boulder)\n\nIn person, MUEN E130, and on Zoom\n\n“Transient Epistemic Akrasia”\n\nI argue that, while most standard cases of epistemic akrasia that are deemed permissible are in fact irrational, there’s a wide range of overlooked cases in which akrasia is likely rationally required. I call this overlooked phenomenon transient epistemic akrasia. It occurs when an agent’s reasoning is still in progress before a conclusion has been reached. By contrast, standardly discussed cases of epistemic akrasia are best interpreted as occurring at the concluding stage of a reasoning process. Yet, those states can only be rational if understood as states of transient akrasia, which occur before the agent has concluded their reasoning.\n\nNovember 16: Rick Furtak (Colorado College)\n\nIn person, UMC 415, and on Zoom\n\n\"Love and Skeptical Doubt\"\n\nNowhere does the subjective basis of our awareness appear so evident as it does when we view things through loving eyes. In Proust’s novel we find skeptical remarks about love made time and time again. However, we also observe countercurrents repeatedly arising, in which love and other emotions are shown and said to provide a unique type of insight. At these times, love seems to be a prerequisite of veridical apprehension. So which is it? What I hope to offer is an investigation of this question as it is played out in Proust's In Search of Lost Time. I delve into the reasons given by Proust’s narrator for being skeptical about what love is capable of revealing, alongside the opposed reasons for overcoming this skepticism. After arguing for how the latter could be viewed as carrying greater weight, I conclude by considering why it is that even a flawed subjectivity can have a large role in acquainting us with particular truths about human existence. Ultimately, this novel shows that the affective constitution of the world may be viewed legitimately through something other than a skeptical eye.\n\nDecember 1: Thomas Bonn (CU Boulder)\n\nIn person, Muenzinger E130, and on Zoom\n\n\"Beyond 'An Eye for An Eye': Plato's Anti-Harm Principle\"\n\nIn a novel anticipation of Jesus's commandment \"Love thy enemies,\" Plato's Socrates famously argues in the Crito and Republic that a just person will never harm anyone. In so doing, he starkly opposes traditional Greek morality, which took \"Benefit friends, harm enemies\" to be a fundamental principle of justice. I will briefly set forth the origins of Socrates's radical claims; provide my account of what Socrates meant by the anti-harm principle and situate it relative to more familiar Platonic commitments; and consider a few connections between Platonic treatments of harm and retribution and contemporary writings on these matters.\n\nDecember 15: Sam Director (Florida Atlantic University)\n\nIn person, UMC 247, and on Zoom\n\n\"Does Black Box AI In Medicine Compromise Informed Consent?\"\n\nRecently, there has been a large push for the use of artificial intelligence in medical settings. The promise of AI in medicine is considerable, but its moral implications are insufficiently examined. If AI is used in medical diagnosis and treatment, it may pose a substantial problem for informed consent. The short version of the problem is this: medical AI will likely surpass human doctors in accuracy, meaning that patients have a prudential reason to prefer treatment from an AI. However, given the black box problem, medical AI cannot explain to patients how it makes decisions, yet such an explanation seems to be required by informed consent. Thus, it seems that doing what is best for patients (treatment via AI), even if patients want to permit this, might be prohibited by medicine’s commitment to informed consent. Conflicts between beneficence and autonomy are not new, but medical AI poses a novel version of this conflict, because this problem is one in which even if the patient says they want to use their autonomy to receive better care, the commitment to autonomy (via informed consent) seems to block them from doing so. Given this dilemma, should we abandon informed consent, or should we not use medical AI? My thesis is that we can have our cake and eat it too; we can use opaque AI in clinical medicine and retain our commitment to informed consent, although it may require revising our understanding of informed consent. To clarify, I intend this paper to be about the practice of using AI to diagnose patients and suggest treatment plans, not the practice of using AI to actually perform surgery.\n\nJanuary 20: Spencer Case\n\n“A foothold for moral realists”\n\nHere I’ll consider two strategies for arguing for moral realism, the thesis that some moral statements are objectively true. I’ll contrast the Moorean strategy for arguing for realism with what I call the “foothold strategy.” The Moorean appeals directly to putative moral facts based on moral intuitions in order to discredit certain forms of anti-realism. The foothold strategy is to argue that we have at least some normative knowledge. This is very hard to deny, and it might even be self-defeating to deny. Once this is conceded, the realist has a foothold from which it’s possible to press for more. If there’s normativity, then why not categorical normativity? And if there’s categorical normativity, why not specifically moral normativity? One advantage that the foothold strategy has over the Moorean strategy is that the realist’s opponents are divided over which premises to reject, and why.\n\nFebruary 10: David Boonin (CU Boulder)\n\n“Racial Profiling, Predictive Policing Algorithms, and Arguments From Fairness”\n\nI’m going to talk about three fairness-based arguments that have been offered against racial profiling and ask whether any of them can be made to work as arguments against using predictive policing algorithms to guide police deployment decisions on the assumption that the use of such algorithms also results in racially imbalanced policing decisions. I’ll argue that the arguments don’t work as arguments against racial profiling and that in some cases, they can’t work as arguments against predictive policing even if they do work as arguments against racial profiling.\n\nMarch 3: Lizzie Fricker (Magdalen College, Oxford)\n\n“On what grounds may one believe what one is told? Epistemic Individualism versus communitarianism about doxastic responsibility: a critique of McMyler’s view”\n\nIn my paper I explore some issues for McMyler’s radically communitarian account of the epistemology of testimony. I link it to the account of testimony offered in John Greco’s recent book, The Transmission of Knowledge. McMyler’s contention that another’s command to believe provides a categorical reason to do so is similar to the uncritical acceptance of another’s word that Greco posits as obtaining within an epistemic community, such as a scientific research team. But hard questions remain as to how the details of such a view work out.\n\nMarch 10 [Special Time 11:10 AM] Connor Kianpour (CU Boulder)\n\n“You Should Have Known Better: Epistemic Privilege and the Duties of the Oppressed”\n\nOne might hear a Black opponent of affirmative action policies, or a pro-life woman, or a gay man who thinks gay people aren’t entitled to government protection from employment or housing discrimination defend their views and think to oneself: “You should know better than that!” The Black opponent of affirmative action policies is sometimes presumed to, in virtue of being Black, have information or reasoning abilities that would dispose them toward being favorable to such policies; women are sometimes presumed to, in virtue of being women, have information and reasoning abilities that would dispose them toward being favorable to pro-choice legislation; and gay people are sometimes presumed to, in virtue of being gay, have information and reasoning abilities that would dispose them toward being favorable to policies that protect gay people from housing and employment discrimination. Moreover, it might be claimed that those who, in virtue of their social identity, have such information and reasoning abilities are obliged to conduct themselves in a certain way in light of such information and reasoning abilities. In this essay, I will illuminate the problems with this strain of thought, a strain of thought which, to my mind, has become par for the course in the current culture. First, I construct and motivate the plausibility of what I call the epistemic privilege argument (EPA) which is meant to guide us to the conclusion that the epistemic privilege that Blacks, women, and gays have in virtue of being Blacks, women, and gays, respectively, generates obligations for them to conduct themselves in certain ways. I build this argument by drawing on the works of critical legal scholars, feminists, and analytic political philosophers. Then, I mount criticisms of both premises of EPA to show the legs on which the argument stands cannot support the argument, at least in the way some proponents of EPA might think it would.\n\nMarch 17: Morteza Lahijanian (Aerospace Engineering Sciences, CU Boulder)\n\n\"Social Trust in Autonomous Robots: a Formal Methods Perspective\"\n\nAutonomous systems are poised to become an integral part of our economy, infrastructure, and society. They are rapidly gaining more capabilities via AI components and serving in ever more safety-critical roles. However, as their complexities grow, the more impossible it becomes to provide safety guarantees for their decisions and overall performance. Recent (and frequent) catastrophic accidents involving autonomous systems, e.g., several Tesla autopilot fatal accidents per year, also show that sole engineering progress in the technology is not enough to guarantee a safe and productive partnership between a human and a robot.\n\nIn this talk, I argue that formal methods combined with control theory and machine learning techniques can form powerful tools to address some of these problems, but not all. We also need to advance our understanding of the role of social trust within human-robot relationships, and formulate a theory for expressing and reasoning about trust in the context of decisions affecting collaboration or competition between humans and robots. This requires cross-disciplinary collaborations to study the formalization of social trust in the context of human-robot relationship. I show my attempt to lay down a groundwork for such a study.\n\nApril 14: Andrea Asker (Stockholm University)\n\n“Posthumous Harm and Changing Desires”\n\nProminent desire-satisfactionist defenses of the possibility of posthumous harm hold that a person incurs posthumous harm when a posthumous state of affairs frustrates one or more of the desires that they had while they were alive. I discuss how the so-called problem of changing desires poses a challenge to the desire-satisfactionist defense of posthumous harm. I argue that the problem of changing desires remains despite suggested means to overcome it, and tentatively defend an alternative solution that has previously been rejected by some.\n\nApril 21: Brian Talbot (CU Boulder)\n\n\"Is anything really interesting?\"\n\nDoes anything have genuine, mind-independent, epistemic value? Probably not. And we should sincerely hope not.\n\nApril 28: Moti Gorin (Colorado State University)\n\n\"Pediatric Gender-Affirming Care: What is it For?\"\n\nThere is today a great deal of controversy over the medicalized gender transition of youth. In the United States, much of the controversy is playing out heatedly in the courts and in the public square. The central question is whether or not so-called “gender affirming care,” which involves some combination of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgery is clinically justified. One set of arguments pertains to empirical questions regarding the medical risks and benefits of this treatment model. Here, there are significant differences between the more aggressive American approach and the more cautious one recently adopted in some European countries. Other arguments step back from the empirical debates and ask about the fundamental aims of pediatric gender transition and whether these aims are best conceived of in clinical terms—e.g., improved health, favorable risk/benefit profile, etc—or in terms of bodily autonomy and identity instead. After providing an overview of these debates, I will focus more narrowly on a recent paper arguing that pediatric gender-affirming care is best conceived not in clinical terms but, analogous to reproductive healthcare, in terms of bodily autonomy and identity. I will argue that the analogy between gender-affirming care and birth control and abortion does not hold and, more generally, that bodily autonomy-based arguments do not work. My main conclusion is that strong empirical evidence showing a favorable risk/benefit profile remains necessary if gender-affirming care is to be justified.\n\nAugust 26: Ted Shear (CU Boulder)\n\n“Causal One-Boxing” (co-authored with Kenny Easwaran and Ben Levinstein)\n\nAccording to the conventional understanding, causal decision theory recommends two-boxing in Newcomb's problem. But, it is also widely acknowledged that the choice scenario is left deeply under-specified in standard presentations. We discuss a number of more precise variations — some of them old, some of them new — in which causal decision theory recommends one-boxing. We explore these variants to draw out philosophical insights relating to agency, habit formation, and rational choice.\n\nSeptember 23: Alastair Norcross (CU Boulder)\n\n“Do the Numbers Get in the Way?: Intuitional Innumeracy in Ethical Thought Experiments”\n\nPhilosophers are fond of thought experiments, often constructing elaborate hypothetical scenarios to elicit intuitions about ethics, epistemology, mind, language, and metaphysics. In ethics, the currently dominant methodology consists of appeals to intuitions about mostly hypothetical (and often outlandish) scenarios. The intuitive judgments thus elicited (or at least avowed by the authors of these scenarios) are then appealed to in constructing and critiquing various ethical approaches. My focus in this talk is on a subclass of such scenarios, that involve, in some way or other, mathematical intuitions, especially those involving large numbers. It is well-known, and easily demonstrable, that most people’s intuitions about mathematics are highly unreliable, especially concerning large numbers (whether numerator or denominator). Given this, it is highly likely that ethical intuitions about scenarios involving large numbers will also be unreliable. Ethicists need to accept that our intuitive judgments about such cases can tell us nothing about moral reality (though they may be able to tell us something about the consistency, or lack thereof, of our own commitments). This will be tough for some philosophers, whose entire careers have been built on appeals to such intuitions. But better an honest acceptance of a wasted intellect (up to this point) than a stubborn insistence on continuing to waste it.\n\nSeptember 30: Jennifer Carr (University of California San Diego)\n\n“The infectious indeterminacy of indeterminate credences”\n\nCredence functions are thought to be too precise to adequately represent belief states. On this view, agents -- perhaps even ideally rational agents -- don’t always have a sharp degree of belief in every proposition. An alternative belief model confers many of the benefits of the credence function model, without its costs: imprecise credences, typically modeled as a set of credence functions.\n\nThere are two common interpretations of imprecise credences:\n\nIndeterminate interpretation: It’s indeterminate what one’s credence in some proposition is. This view is generally paired with supervaluationism.\n\nMushy interpretation: It’s not indeterminate what one’s credence is; it’s just not real-valued (sharp), but instead determinately spread out over multiple real values (mushy).\n\nMy thesis: the indeterminate interpretation has lots of unattractive consequences: normatively, for epistemic and pragmatic evaluation; and descriptively, for plausible belief modeling. Best to go with either mushy interpretation or the precise credence model.\n\nOctober 7: David Boonin (CU Boulder)\n\n“Two Puzzles About the Ethics of Divestment”\n\nSuppose you own stock in Acme Corp. and you learn that it consistently acts in seriously immoral ways. What should you do? A common answer maintains that owning stock in Acme Corp. makes you complicit in its immoral behavior and that you should therefore divest yourself of it. But as Steven M. Cahn has argued, there seems to be something puzzling about this answer. If you sell your stock to someone, then they will own it. If it’s wrong to own the stock, then they’ll be doing something wrong. So if you divest yourself of the stock, you’ll be helping someone do something wrong. But it seems wrong to help someone do something wrong. So how can a company’s immoral behavior make it wrong for you to own stock in the company but not make it wrong for you to get rid of the stock by selling it to someone else? In this talk, I will present two versions of Cahn’s divestment puzzle and explain the reasoning that leads to each of them. I will then discuss the published responses that have appeared since Cahn first presented the puzzle and argue that none of them are successful. I will conclude by defending an alternative response.\n\nOctober 21: Emily Slome (CU Boulder)\n\n\"Moral Testimony Pessimism and Epistemic Responsibility\"\n\nI argue for pessimism about moral testimony. My argument is based on the claim that deference to moral testimony is problematic because it comes with the ability for the hearer to pass the epistemic responsibility and thus, the moral responsibility for a belief, onto the speaker. My view is that this ability that comes with moral deference is problematic for two main reasons. First, when a hearer has the ability to pass on epistemic responsibility, our understanding of how to evaluate the hearer as a moral agent is obscured. Second, having this ability threatens to erode the hearer’s sense of personal moral responsibility, which could potentially diminish the hearer’s moral drive.\n\nNovember 4: Eirik Lang Harris (Colorado State University)\n\n\"The Han Feizi on Politically Relevant Merit\"\n\nThe most prominent advocacy of political meritocracy in recent years has come from those who see themselves inspired by the Confucian philosophical tradition. Unfortunately, they often ignore competing Chinese visions of political meritocracy and direct challenges to the Confucian vision from within the Chinese tradition.\n\nThe Confucian conception of political merit is intertwined to its conception of morality and as such virtue is seen as an essential component. To defend such a position and its applicability, they need to show both that inculcation of virtue is possible and that these virtues are politically relevant. One prominent historic critic of Confucianism, Han Feizi, worries about both claims. While agreeing that political merit matters and that ministers and bureaucrats should be chosen on the basis of their merit, he has a vastly different conception of what constitutes politically relevant merit, one that is both is both task specific and amoral in nature.\n\nWhat Confucians fail to grasp, argues the Han Feizi, is that what leads to virtue is non-identical to what leads to a well-ordered, flourishing state. At times, a choice must be made between following morality and securing the state. Insofar as Confucianism requires moral virtue as a core component of merit, it not only misidentifies what constitutes politically relevant merit, it focuses on and characterizes as meritorious traits that are actually detrimental to a well-ordered and flourishing state.\n\nNovember 18: Megan Kitts (CU Boulder)\n\n\"Throwing the Embryos Out with the Bathwater? A Novel Evaluation of the Value of Embryos\"\n\nMuch of the discussion on appropriate treatment of embryos has focused on whether it is permissible to destroy embryos in order to obtain stem cells for research. I aim to develop a new account of the value of embryos whereby embryos are intrinsically valuable in virtue of their relationship to persons that could exist. I call this symbolic value. To establish this value, I first show that corpses have this same symbolic value in virtue of their relationship to prior persons, and then show that the cases of corpses and embryos are relevantly similar. Because of this value, we ought to treat embryos in particular respectful ways. It is currently common practice in the United States to discard extra embryos that exist as a result of in vitro fertilization (IVF). I argue it is generally impermissible to discard embryos because it does not treat them in accordance with their value, and thus is an act of disrespect.\n\nDecember 2: Kate Schmidt (Metro State University)\n\n\"Toxic Positivity and Emotional Mistreatment\"\n\nToxic positivity is a folk term that has recently gained popularity. Ethicists should be concerned with understanding this because it seems to be used as a novel form of ethical critique. In this talk I’ll look at three questions while clarifying the significance of this term (1) Is there a central conceptual phenomenon to “toxic positivity”? (2) Is there a novel or unique ethical harm being addressed? (3) What are the implications for how we ought to tune our feelings of optimism or pessimism?\n\nJanuary 21: Caleb Perl (Zoom only)\n\n“Normativity as Reactive Shield”\n\nThis paper pioneers a construal of normativity that descends from Mill's classic account of moral wrongs as what ought to be sanctioned. My core contribution is to generalize Mill's account to avoid objectionable circularity, by taking normative judgments to play a distinctive role in our social lives. On the resulting picture, the normativity of moral requirements, the normativity of prudential requirements, and the normativity of epistemic requirements all consist in a common role that they play in our social lives. I aim to show that the resulting picture is on a par with more familiar Humean or Kantian pictures of normativity. Establishing parity helps us ask which metaethical questions should be central: it opens up the possibility that social questions might matter over individualistic questions.\n\nFebruary 4: Ken Shockley (Colorado State University)\n\n\"Vulnerability, Adaptation, and our Changing Environment\"\n\nIt is intuitively clear that humans are vulnerable to our changing climate; our adaptation strategies are ideally designed to mitigate those vulnerabilities. However, typical characterizations of vulnerability do not adequately reflect the ability of humans to adapt to changing background conditions. A better understanding of the dependence of human flourishing on background ecological conditions should lead us to rethink our understanding of vulnerability, and, accordingly, our strategies for adapting to a world with decreasingly familiar ecological conditions. This paper explores that dependence and argues that when it comes to humans adapting to a changing climate, vulnerability should be framed in terms of the precarity of meaningful access to the goods necessary for flourishing.\n\nFebruary 11: Marion Hourdequin (Colorado College)\n\n\"Sustainability and Intergenerational Ethics from A Relational Point of View\"\n\nCommon conceptions of sustainability and intergenerational ethics focus on either “stuff” or welfare. On the first approach, sustainability requires passing to future generations an undiminished supply of natural resources (i.e., material “stuff”). According to the second approach, it is human welfare across generations that should be sustained. Although there are important differences between these views, they share some common features. For example, both approaches focus on intergenerational distributive justice: How much does each generation deserve, relative to others? Relatedly, both approaches treat sustainability as a constraint on the behavior of present generations, framing intergenerational ethics as involving tradeoffs between the good of present and future people. These tradeoffs, in turn, raise motivational questions: Why should present people constrain their use of natural resources (or other goods) to save for the future? Given power asymmetries, how can present people be held accountable to the future? In this talk, I argue that relational approaches to sustainability and intergenerational ethics can provide an important complement or alternative to approaches that emphasize intertemporal distributive justice. Rather than focus primarily on what each generation “gets” relative to others, relational approaches emphasize the value and significance of sustaining relations and shared projects over time. As compared to theories of intergenerational distributive justice, relational approaches: 1) emphasize shared values and concerns rather than conflicting interests; 2) provide a ground for motivation based in shared commitment to common projects across time; and 3) offer space for a richer conversation about what those common intergenerational projects are and should be, and thus a more expansive conception of what matters intergenerationally.\n\nFebruary 15: Henrik Andersson (Visiting Fellow, CVSP)\n\n\"Millian Value Relations Generalised and Interpreted\"\n\nJohn Stuart Mill argued that there are intellectual pleasures and physical pleasures and that no amount of the latter is better than any amount of the former. In the following paper, we attempt to illuminate the general notion of superiority to which he appealed by showing that its underlying structure occurs not only where items are better/worse than one another, but also where they are equally good or on a par. We also provide an interpretation of this type of value relation that avoids invoking the notions of infinite value and diminishing marginal value.\n\nFebruary 25: Tristan Rogers (Visiting Fellow, Benson Center)\n\n\"Stoic Conservatism\"\n\nRecent years have witnessed a resurgence of interest in Stoic ethics among the general public. But Stoic approaches to politics are comparatively rare. What might a Stoic approach to politics look like? David Goodhart aptly describes the political divide pervading Western societies in terms of the “somewheres,” who are communitarian, rooted in particular places, and resistant to social and political change, versus the “anywheres,” who are cosmopolitan, mobile, and enthusiastic embracers of change. Stoicism recognizes a similar distinction. “My city and state are Rome,” Marcus Aurelius writes, “But as a human being? The world.” This paper defends a conservative interpretation of Stoic politics. According to “Stoic conservatism,” cosmopolitanism is an ethical ideal through which we perform the obligations assigned by our communitarian role(s) in society. The view is “conservative” in the sense that there is an assumption in favor of existing institutions as the starting point for virtue, instead of reasoning a priori about what virtue requires. Stoic politics consists neither in the cosmopolitan transcendence of particular attachments, nor in passive acceptance of the communitarian status quo, but in ethical improvement toward virtue within the political structure of society.\n\nMarch 4: Steve Vanderheiden (Political Science/Environmental Studies, CU Boulder)\n\n\"The Ethics of Prisoner Exchanges for Post-war War Crimes Prosecution\"\n\nThe history of prosecuting political leaders for jus ad bellum war crimes is fraught, with few examples of such actors being brought to trial and even fewer successful prosecutions. So also is the politics of international war crimes jurisprudence, with the United States refusing to participate in the International Criminal Court, despite having played a central role in its establishment through the Rome Statute. Both the history and politics are fraught in part because of the arbitrariness of conditions under which war crimes can be pursued: charges can only effectively be brought against leaders of countries that are parties to the Rome Statute and are also practically limited to being brought only against those from the losing side of violent conflicts. Indeed, future prosecution of political leaders for jus ad bellum war crimes may be complicated by ethical objections against this arbitrariness. Bracketing the question of whether post-war prosecution of war criminals is itself ethically defensible, I focus here on two related issues. First (and in what should be a fairly straightforward but nonetheless necessary step), I consider the ethics of limiting war crimes prosecution in this way—that is, prosecuting only those from the losing side of conflicts and only if their countries are parties to the Rome Statute. Second, I consider a potential remedy that could potentially rectify the institutional unfairness of a judicial body like the ICC that is limited in this way: allowing the prosecution of an accused war criminal from the winning side of a conflict and/or from a country that is not a party to the Rome Statute in exchange for allowing the prosecution of an accused war criminal from the losing side. Drawing upon a relatively small literature of the ethics of prisoner exchanges (grounded also in conventional accounts of the ethics of war and punishment of political leaders for war crimes), I develop an account of when such an exchange might be defensible and offer conditions under which it might be justified.\n\nMarch 11: Ricardo Simmonds (PhD candidate, Environmental Studies)\n\n\"Meataphysics: Clean Meat, Messy Matters\"\n\nAnimal meat (fish, pork, chicken, beef, foi gras) has long been a source of concern for ethicists, but new technologies make it possible to use animal stem cells to produce meat in laboratories, possibly avoiding many, if not most, ethical concerns. Some forecasters anticipate that such products may be readily available to consumers in the United States this year. The production of laboratory meat for human consumption, advertised as clean meat, gives rise to ethical, epistemic and ontological questions about the nature of this new non-slaughtered animal product. In this talk, I explore the ontology of clean meat by examining the different philosophical implications of natural and unnatural in an ongoing set of discussions among religious communities. While several Jewish, Muslim and Christian scholars have drawn distinct, and at times contradicting, conclusions about the ontology of clean meat, I develop a Catholic position, based on Aristotelian hylomorphism, and borrowing concepts from other traditions, that challenges the conclusion that lab meat is meat in the first place.\n\nMarch 18: Anna Folland (Uppsala University)\n\n\"Misfortunes and Missing Out\"\n\nThe badness of death is often understood in comparative terms: a person's death is bad for her to the extent that it deprives her of the benefits of life, which she otherwise would have enjoyed. However, things that are comparatively bad in this sense do not always seem to be misfortunes or evils in the sense that death seems to be. For instance, the fact that my lottery ticket lacks the winning number or that I am never invited to meet my celebrity role model does not seem aptly described as a misfortune, nor as an evil. Kaila Draper (1999) raises a challenge for proponents of this form of comparative understanding of badness: given that both death and not winning the lottery are bad in the same way, why is only the former a misfortune or evil?\n\nIn this paper, I take on the largely neglected task of examining what a misfortune or evil in the relevant sense plausibly is. As we shall see, these questions bear close connections to the debate about the nature of harm. I argue that there is a parallel challenge involving harm. This challenge proves problematic for the prominent counterfactual comparative account (CCA) of harm and it might push us into examining an overlooked view of harm – namely, a fitting attitudes analysis.\n\nApril 1: David Boonin (CU Boulder)\n\n\"Artificial Intelligence, Criminal Justice, and Risk Assessment: The Right to An Explanation Objection to Opaque Recidivism Prediction Algorithms\"\n\nRisk assessment tools like COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanction) use sophisticated algorithms to calculate the probability that an offender will commit an additional crime within a certain number of years of the date of the assessment. These calculations are based on information about the offender and their past conduct. Courts and parole boards frequently use such algorithms when making decisions about parole, probation, bail, and even sentencing. The inner workings of these tools remain inaccessible to the defendants whose fate is in part determined by them when the algorithms in question belong to a private corporation (as is the case with COMPAS) or are driven by advanced forms of artificial intelligence that generate unfathomably complex predictive models. In such cases, it seems plausible to conclude that using these algorithms in these ways is morally objectionable because it seems plausible to suppose that defendants have a moral right to receive an explanation of the reasoning that led to the decisions that were made in their cases and that the opacity of such algorithms prevents them from receiving one.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss two arguments that have been offered in defense of this right to an explanation objection to using opaque risk assessment tools in these ways. The first maintains that using them for these purposes is analogous to other practices that clearly violate a defendant’s due process rights. The second maintains that using them in these ways violates a requirement of state transparency that is a necessary condition for political legitimacy. I will try to show that both arguments are unsuccessful. In addition, I will offer what I believe to be a novel argument in defense of the claim that defendants do not have a right to an explanation of the reasoning that led to the decisions that were made in their cases about parole, probation, bail, and sentencing. The argument is based on the claim that offenders do not have a right to have jurors explain the reasoning that led to their decision to vote to convict them and that if this is so, then they also lack the right to have courts and parole boards explain the reasoning that led to their decisions about parole, probation, bail, and sentencing. This conclusion about the merits of the right to an explanation objection may prove disturbing, but I will argue that the implications of the alternative position are even harder to accept.\n\nApril 8: Dan Jacobson (CU Boulder)\n\nApril 15: Ben Hale (CU Boulder)\n\n\"Clean Meat and Dirty Dollars: Substitution and Indeterminacy in Technocratic Solutions to Climate Change\"\n\nThe past few years have been big for meat substitutes. The Impossible Whopper is now available at Burger King, Beyond Meat has found its way into grocery stores, and recent technological advancements look increasingly likely to enable the production of synthetic ‘cultured’ meat burgers in the lab. The hope and promise of these technologies is that they will serve as inexpensive substitute proteins that replace meats made by the much more problematic animal agriculture industry. In this paper, we flip the problem of meat on its head: asking not what is wrong with meat, so much as how consumer indifference and producer strategy might influence the uptake of clean meat in the economic market. Rather than approaching the problem in terms of substitution value, which appears to be the prevailing interpretive framework for making sense of many environmental problems, meat included, we approach the problem of substitution from the standpoint of reasons-for and reasons-against. Doing so, we suggest, exposes complications with “causal indeterminacy” that in turn implicate our thinking both about moral responsibility and the broader nature of technocratic solutions to environmental problems.\n\nAuthors: Benjamin Hale, Sebastian Dueñas Ocampo, Alexander Lee\n\nApril 22: Moti Gorin (CSU)\n\nTitle TBA\n\nApril 29: Chris Heathwood (CU Boulder)\n\n\"Ill-Being and Desire”\n\nIn a seminal paper, Shelly Kagan notices how philosophers of well-being tend to neglect ill-being – the part of the theory of well-being that tells us what is bad in itself for subjects – and explains why we need to give it more attention. This paper does its part by addressing desire-based theories. Two main ill-being options for such theories have presented themselves: the frustration view and the aversion view. I aim to show that Kagan’s objections to both views are wanting; to give a new argument for the aversion view; and to show how whether this and other arguments for the aversion view succeed – and indeed whether the aversion view is a distinct alternative at all – depends crucially on the conception of desire at play in the theory.\n\nAugust 27: Scott Hill (CU Boulder)\n\n\"The Relevance of Desert to the Footbridge Case\"\n\nI identify a desert sensitive version of consequentialism that is able to accommodate the intuition that pushing in Footbridge is wrong, accommodate intuitions about Shroeder’s (2007) variants of Footbridge, explain why there is a difference between killing and letting die, accommodate Mun~oz’s (2021) criticism of such forms of consequentialism, and remain true to the conequentialist intuition that we should do the best we can. This suggests a way to recast Mun~oz’s negative argument as a positive one in support of the version of consequentialism that I identify. In the end, I argue that desert sensitive versions of consequentialism have underappreciated resources to address problems in this body of literature.\n\nSeptember 3: Robert Pasnau (CU Boulder)\n\n\"To Die So That Others May Live\"\n\nThere’s great optimism in certain scientific circles for the project of radically extending the length of healthy human lives, perhaps allowing us to live for a millennium or longer. I argue that it would be deeply immoral to prolong our lives so dramatically, and that we therefore ought to limit this research in something like the way we restrict research in other problematic cases, like human cloning.\n\nSeptember 10: Alastair Norcross (CU Boulder)\n\n\"Doing, Allowing, and Demandingness\"\n\nSeptember 17: Tim Burkhardt (CU Boulder)\n\n\"Epicureanism and Prudence\"\n\nOctober 1: Derek Hughes (CU Boulder)\n\n\"Against Virtue Externalism\"\n\nI offer an argument against virtue externalism: the view that morally good effects, independent of agents’ internal states, are necessary for moral virtue. On the assumption that virtues are character traits, I show that the virtue of modesty is a counterexample to virtue externalism.\n\nOctober 8: Jonas Harney (Saarbrucken)\n\n\"The Problems of the Interpersonal Comparative View\"\n\nAccording to the person-affecting view, the part of ethics that is concerned with the welfare of individuals should be cashed out in terms of how the individuals are affected. While the narrow version, which considers intrapersonal comparative value to be morally significant, fails to solve the Non-Identity Problem, the wide version, which focuses on absolute personal value, is subject to the Repugnant Conclusion. Recently, a middle view has been proposed that promises to capture our moral concerns towards future individuals but avoid their flaws. It modifies the narrow view by abstracting away from individuals’ identities in order to account for interpersonal, not just intrapersonal, comparative value. I call this position the Interpersonal Comparative View. In my talk, I will argue that that view is flawed. By striking the middle, it cuts to many things along the way: it abandons intuitions that underlie the narrow view, obstructs the advantage of the wide view to account for the welfare of all future individuals, and violates its own presuppositions.\n\nOctober 29: Lisa Miracchi (Penn)\n\n“Permissible Uncertainty and Meaningful Human Control”\n\nI propose that we shift debates on LAWS away from questions about whether we should let robots make decisions or perform ethically assessable actions and instead work to articulate what the human agents involved, at different stages of command, need to know in order for them to make responsible and ethical decisions about the deployment of such systems. As human agents rarely have total relevant knowledge of the systems they use, I suggest we frame debates around what uncertainty is permissible, for a user, occupying a role, in a physical and socio-political context. This enables us to treat ethical issues around LAWS as continuous with those for other weapon systems and more easily make comparisons between them, and it helps robotics researchers articulate concrete design, explainability, and testing criteria that are sensitive to the complexity of the ethical issues at stake.\n\nNovember 5: Erich Riesen (CU Boulder)\n\n\"A Technological-Systems Approach to AI Ethics: Reframing Some Important Debates\"\n\nMuch of the recent ethics of AI literature is spent debating whether AI systems (either currently or in the future) deserve legal/moral rights, whether they will be conscious and/or free, and whether we ought to consider them as (or build them to be) moral agents with moral autonomy. Such debates are at best premature and at worst conceptually confused. In this talk, I attempt to diagnose a problem with the Moral Machine approach to AI safety that has dominated philosophy of AI over the last decade. I contend that many thinkers implicitly assume a hardware (or machine) based conception of technology. The hardware definition of technology holds that technological artifacts are objects fundamentally independent from the human beings that design and use them. This has led some authors to mistakenly emphasize machine responsibility and autonomy when in fact AI systems will (for the foreseeable future, if not forever) merely extend human responsibility and moral autonomy. Instead, we ought to switch to a technological-systems conception of technology, which sees human beings and machines as parts of larger systems, thus dropping the independence condition. I use the technological-systems definition to reframe some standard problems in the ethics of AI literature including the responsibility gap problem and the problem of getting machines to act ethically.\n\nNovember 12: Cheryl Abbate (UNLV)\n\n\"The Animals in our Living Rooms: Friends or Family?\"\n\nThe relationships between humans and the animals who live in our homes are, in most cases, loving relationships. But love can take many different forms. There is, for example, romantic love, familial love, parental love, and friendship. Heather Stewart (2018) points out that many human-companion relationships closely resemble parent-children relationships and moreover argues that relationships between humans and companion animals should be treated as involving parenting. Stewart is right that, descriptively speaking, many human-animal relationships closely resemble parent-children relationships, Yet, as I argue in this chapter, normatively speaking, parental love is not the kind of love we should strive to mirror in our loving relationships with companion animals. Rather, we should strive to form relationships with animals that involve a kind of friendly love rather than parental love-- that is, we should form companion friendships with animals. This is because friendships, unlike parent-child relationships, are characterized by mutuality, choice, equality, and respect for differences, and these are ideals we should try to foster in our relationships with animals, who are autonomous creatures with their own unique lives. Although human relationships with animals often resemble parent-child relationships, they need not, and should not, be that way.\n\nNovember 19: Tristan Rogers (Benson Center, CU Boulder)\n\n\"Socrates’ Ignorance of Justice: An Epistemic Argument for the Rule of Law in Plato’s Crito\"\n\nDespite affirming the injustice of breaking the law in Plato’s Crito, Socrates gives several examples in his Apology speech where he himself refused what appear to be lawful orders. This paper argues that Socrates strikes the right balance between moral virtue and deference to the rule of law as equally integral to the good society whose citizens are virtuous partly because they obey the law. More specifically, the Crito argument for the rule of law can be buttressed against the common objection that it requires compliance with unjust laws by appeal to Socrates’ epistemological claim about his ignorance of justice.\n\nDecember 3: Chris Heathwood (CU Boulder)\n\n\"Are Adaptive Preferences a Problem for Subjective Theories of Well-Being?”\n\nJanuary 15: Associate Professor Kendy Hess (Brake-Smith Professor of Social Philosophy and Ethics, College of the Holy Cross)\n\n\"To Serve and Inspect: Foucault's Discipline in the Age of Employee Well-being\"\n\nOne of the fundamental tasks of the government is to “secure generally the comfort, safety, morals, health, and prosperity of its citizens...by insuring to each an uninterrupted enjoyment of all the privileges conferred upon him or her by the general laws” (Black's Law Dictionary, citing Keystone Coal). This authority is commonly known, appropriately enough, as the \"police power.\" Sometimes the government regulates its citizens directly in its exercise of the police power, but here I explore the implications of a different technique. It is becoming increasingly common for the government to impose the responsibility inherent in the police power on business enterprises, making firms legally liable for the health and well-being of their employees. I suggest in this paper that implementing such regulations, in which one entity (the firm) is made liable for the well-being of another (the employee) establishes some unfortunate incentives. After introducing Foucault's panoptic theory of discipline, I draw on developments in health and safety regulation and workplace climate regulation to suggest that we should heed the warning inherent in Foucault's work. When the government makes one entity liable for the well-being of another it introduces a dangerous logic into workplace management, leading to the near-inevitable exposure and exploitation of the very people the government was trying to protect.\n\nJanuary 22: Dr Zak Kopeikin and Ms Alex Lloyd (University of Colorado)\n\nNOTE: THIS TALK WILL BE AT 11:30 am MST.\n\n\"'It’s just allergies': COVID-19 and Relevant Alternatives\"\n\nIn his recent book The Pandemic Information Gap, economist Joshua Gans’s primary contention is that “pandemics are an information problem\" (2020: 8). Of special concern is information about who is infected and contagious: if the noses of those infected and contagious with COVID-19 lit up and shone bright red, for example, we could more effectively identify and isolate those who are ill and pose a risk of spreading the disease. Rudolph-nose is unfortunately not a symptom of COVID-19, but the point stands: knowing whether one is infected and infectious is crucially important to battling the ongoing pandemic.\n\nIn this talk, we show how a relevant alternatives framework (RA) provides a compelling explanation for why perceptual experiences of our bodily health are generally insufficient to justify beliefs about whether we have COVID-19. We start by examining how asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases of COVID-19 provide a relevant alternative that undermines our justification for whether we are infected and whether we are contagious based on perception of bodily health (i.e., not having symptoms). We then examine symptoms of COVID-19 and argue that RAs for many COVID-19 symptoms can undermine justification for the belief that one is infected and the belief that one is contagious. Our results help explain the epistemic mess in which we find ourselves and provide a line of justification for widespread rigorous testing (especially for those who are more likely to have asymptomatic or milder cases of COVID-19).\n\nJanuary 29: Dr Alex Wolf-Root (University of Colorado)\n\n\"COVID-19: Mask Off the NCAA’s Collegiate Model Myth\"\n\n“COMMITTED TO WELL-BEING” This is the headline that pops up when visiting the NCAA’s homepage during the Fall semester during the 2020 global pandemic. It is overlaid onto a picture of what appear to be a victorious Indoor T&F relay team – a sport that has seen teams slashed across the country allegedly due to the pandemic. Below this picture, a banner invites you to click for more information on COVID-19, all while schools prepare for tens of thousands of in-person fans at their home football games.\n\nIf we were to trust the NCAA’s advertising, grand statements, and explicit statements of purpose, we’d think that college athletics in the US are primarily for the health and betterment of “student-athletes” across the country. But even the most stalwart defender of the status quo must recognize how decisions made during this age of COVID-19 clearly undermine the stated purpose of the current intercollegiate model in the US. Quite simply, COVID-19 has been mask off for the NCAA’s “collegiate model.”\n\nThis paper will start by presenting the alleged goals and values of the NCAA and some of the more powerful member-institutions. Then, it will show how many decisions made during COVID-19 are clearly incompatible with these goals. In doing so, we will see that there is one purpose that is in line with sporting decisions during the 2020 pandemic: revenue generation through mass entertainment. Simply put, the NCAA’s rhetorical commitment to student-focused activities has been uncovered for the hypocrisy that it always was.\n\nA discussion of possible solutions or alternative models is far outside the scope of this paper, but in pulling off the mask of the collegiate model, we can take a first step towards a less unjust, less hypocritical system of college sport in the US.\n\nFebruary 5: Dr Ben Kultgen (University of Colorado)\n\n\"Indeterminately Permissible yet Determinately Imperative\"\n\nIt seems reasonable enough that it can be indeterminate whether it is permissible for Sto φ. We could understand such cases as being either instances of ontic indeterminacy—an indeterminacy of the world itself—or instances of semantic indeterminacy—an indeterminacy of our language and thought. Very few philosophers endorse any sort of ontic indeterminacy view. (In fact, some very famous philosophers declared the notion incoherent). However, if we understand cases of indeterminate permissibility as cases of semantic indeterminacy, all sorts of very odd results follow. I will focus specifically on the difficulties created for our commonsense understanding of the relationship between permissibility and reasons. These issues could be avoided either by allowing for ontic indeterminacy, or by rejecting that it can be indeterminate whether it is permissible for Sto φ. I suggest the second option is worth considering.\n\nFebruary 12: Professor Michelle Montague (University of Texas, Austin)\n\n\"Rethinking the Attitudes\"\n\nMany mental states exhibit intentionality, the property of being about something, or of something in the sense of ‘of’ exemplified by phrases like ‘a view of Florence’, ‘an account of the Battle of the Bulge’. Paradigm cases of intentional mental states include beliefs, desires, thoughts, hopes, fears, supposings, wonderings. It has long been standard practice in analytic philosophy to describe these intentional mental states in terms of three distinct metaphysical elements: a subject-element, an attitude-element, and a content-element. I call it ‘the Tripartite view’, because it posits three fundamental distinct elements. In this paper I argue that the Tripartite view is mistaken, and propose that it should be replaced by what I will call ‘the Dual view’. According to the Dual view, all there is to the metaphysics of our intentional states is (i) a content and (ii) a subject; there is no need to postulate distinct metaphysical relations and call them ‘the belief relation’, ‘the desire relation’, and so on.\n\nFebruary 19: Assistant Professor Cheryl Abbate (University of Nevada, Las Vegas)\n\n\"Why Ghosts Aren't So Spooky: The Ethics of Indirect “Relationship” Dissolution\"\n\nThere are both direct and indirect ways people can communicate romantic disinterest to their actual or potential romantic partners. It’s commonly assumed that “initiators” who use indirect communication, i.e., “ghosting,” behave wrongly. Against this view, I use a theory of moral rights to explain why most initiators who use indirect communication to express romantic disinterest are morally justified. I argue that if non-initiators have a right against initiators to direct communication, it’s because non-initiators have a “right to know” or a “right to access.” Yet, as I will argue, the “ghosted” have neither. The ghosted don’t have a “right to know,” because either (1) the initiator can’t provide them with understanding, (2) understanding would be harmful and unproductive, and/or (3) using direct communication requires initiators to disclose their personal mental states, to which the ghosted don’t have a right. Moreover, the ghosted don’t have a “right to access” because having access to initiators usually results in disrespectful treatment of initiators and/or non-initiators. Consequently, most people who use ghosting behavior to communicate romantic disinterest to non-initiators act well within their moral rights, promoting the personhood of everyone involved.\n\nFebruary 26: Professor Alastair Norcross (University of Colorado)\n\n“Is Premarital Sexual Abstinence Immoral?”\n\nMany people claim that premarital sex is immoral. Some groups, such as “True Love Waits” even pressure teenagers to sign a pledge to abstain before marriage. But, given the seriousness of the promises we make to each other when we marry, and the high incidence of divorce, with its attendant harm for all involved, especially the children, perhaps it’s actually premarital abstinence that’s immoral. We owe it to our partners and our children not to make serious promises, before getting as much evidence as we can that we will keep those promises. To protect the institution of marriage, and for the sake of the children (won't somebody think of the children?), we need to recognize the serious immorality of premarital abstinence.\n\nMarch 5: Associate Professor Rob Lovering (City University of New York, Staten Island)\n\n\"All Persons Are Equal, But Some Persons Are More Equal Than Others: On the Incoherence of Alabama’s Abortion Ban\"\n\nIn 2019, the governor of Alabama, Kay Ivey, signed into law House Bill 314—the Human Life Protection Act. The law criminalizes all abortions, including in cases involving rape and incest, except when abortion is deemed necessary for the prevention of a “serious health risk.” As a Class A felony, abortion is punishable by up to 99 years in prison, and attempted abortion, a Class C felony, is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. However, only the one performing or attempting to perform the abortion—the doctor, in the standard case—is subject to said punishments. The one procuring or attempting to procure the abortion, the mother, is not subject to any punishment whatsoever. Given that the purported view in which the Human Life Protection Act is rooted is that (a) the human fetus is morally equal to every other human being and, thus, (b) it is just as prima facie seriously wrong to intentionally kill the human fetus as it is to intentionally kill any other human being, two questions arise: Does it make sense to punish only the one performing or attempting to perform the abortion? And does it make sense to do so by sentencing him or her to no more than 99 years in prison? In this paper, I argue that, relative to the conjunction of the law’s purported underlying moral rationale and the Alabama criminal code, these things do not make sense and, in that regard, the Human Life Protection Act is incoherent. Lest there be any confusion, I am not arguing that the abortion-performing doctor or abortion-procuring mother should be punished—indeed, I do not believe that abortion is immoral, generally speaking, let alone that it should be criminalized and punishable by death. I am merely arguing that, relative to the conjunction of the law’s purported underlying moral rationale and the Alabama criminal code, Alabama’s abortion ban is incoherent.\n\nMarch 12: Professor Elinor Mason (University of California, Santa Barbara)\n\n\"Consent and Consensuality\"\n\nIt is well recognized by feminist thinkers that the standard conception of consent is problematic when applied to sexual consent in a patriarchal context. Consent has a contractual feel to it, in which one person allows another to do something to them (or their property). This does not capture what goes on in the ideal sort of sex, and, in the common assumption that in heterosexual relations the woman is the one to consent, further entrenches a problematic view of gender relations. I argue that we should make a distinction between consent and consensuality. Consensuality is symmetrical, and is not contractual, but captures the element of willingness that is essential to morally permissible sexual contact.\n\nMarch 19: Professor Dan Jacobson (University of Colorado)\n\n\"Immoralism and Contextualism\"\n\nThe 20th century saw a robust debate over autonomism, the thesis that the moral features of artworks are irrelevant to their aesthetic value. Moral worries about art go back to Plato, and they have been developed in various ways through the history of aesthetics. Until recently, however, those philosophers of art who denied autonomism assumed the truth of moralism, the view that the moral defects of artworks, whenever they are aesthetically relevant, count as aesthetic flaws in the work. This assumption was called into question at the end of the century, when it was noted that moral defects in artworks might be aesthetically relevant without figuring as defects; they might instead sometimes figure as aesthetic qualities of the work, in an analogous way to how the moralist sees them as blemishes. This thesis is sometimes referred to as immoralism but that seems a misnomer, since no one holds that moral defects figure as aesthetic qualities whenever they are aesthetically relevant. A better term for the view that such moral flaws can figure either as blemishes or qualities of artwork is contextualism. I argue against autonomism on familiar grounds, but then suggest that the best arguments against autonomism support contextualism rather than any form of moralism. Philosophers too often ignore the myriad ways in which audiences do not apply the same moral standards to works of art that they would apply were they real-life spectators of the actions depicted in it (somehow prevented from intervention). Indeed, our appreciation of narrative art in particular requires that we do not do so. In light of this point, the rejection of autonomism should lead us to contextualism rather than moralism. Or so I argue.\n\nMarch 26: Associate Professor Claudia Mills Emerita (University of Colorado)\n\n\"Ethics and Children's Literature\"\n\nChildren’s literature has always been charged with the task of helping to shape children as moral beings. But didacticism has also been its original sin – present in the 18th and 19th century origins of the field and continuing to this day in preachy, moralizing stories (most of which fortunately get rejected!). As a philosopher specializing in ethics who is also the author of sixty books for young readers, I’ve wrestled with how to engage children morally in the stories I tell. In this talk I will share some examples of my recent books that have ethically charged subject matter and show how I tried to present this in a way that offers young readers more questions than answers, leaving space for them to develop their own skills as moral reasoners.\n\nApril 2: Assistant Professor Duncan Purves and Dr. Jeremy Davis (University of Florida)\n\n\"Public Trust, Institutional Legitimacy, and the Use of Algorithms in Criminal Justice”\n\nA common criticism of the use of algorithms in criminal justice is that algorithms and their determinations are in some sense ‘opaque’—that is, difficult or impossible to understand, whether because of their complexity or because of intellectual property protections. Scholars have noted some key problems with opacity, including that opacity can mask unfair treatment and threaten public accountability. In this paper, we explore a different but related concern with algorithmic opacity, which centers on the role of public trust in grounding the legitimacy of criminal justice institutions. We argue that algorithmic opacity threatens the trustworthiness of criminal justice institutions, which in turn threatens their legitimacy. We first offer an account of institutional trustworthiness before showing how opacity threatens to undermine an institution’s trustworthiness. We then explore how threats to trustworthiness affect institutional legitimacy. Finally, we offer some policy recommendations to mitigate the effects of the opacity problem.\n\nApril 9: Associate Professor Michelle Maiese (Emmanuel College, Boston)\n\n\"Autonomous Agency, Enactivism, and Psychopathy\"\n\nMost philosophical discussions of psychopathy have centered around its significance in relation to empathy, moral cognition, or moral responsibility. However, related questions about the extent to which they are capable of exercising autonomous agency have remained underexplored. Two central conditions for autonomous agency that are highlighted by many existing accounts include (1) reasons-responsivity, and (2) authenticity. However, available evidence indicates that psychopaths are inadequately responsive to reasons in general and other-regarding reasons in particular, and also seem to lack a set of enduring concerns that might reveal which desires and attitudes are truly theirs. This leads them to behave impulsivity and to disregard the interests and concerns of others. Drawing from the enactivist approach in philosophy of mind and the notions of habit and affordance, I argue that both their prudential deficits and apparent moral failings are rooted, at a deeper level, in a lack of well-developed affective framing patterns.\n\nApril 16: Dr. Bodhi Melnitzer (University of Colorado)\n\n\"Adaptive Preferences are Preferences formed for the Wrong Kind of Reason\"\n\nStandardly conceived, an adaptive preference is a preference for what a person can get because they can get it, and against what they can’t because they can’t. Adaptive preferences have interested philosophers because such preferences are widely held to be defective, though stating what about them is defective is itself a matter of heated controversy. But failure to carefully consider the differences between adaptive and standard preference change has, I believe, stymied the debate’s progress. In this talk I will develop a view that proceeds from reflections on what distinguishes adaptive from standard preference change. Most importantly, I argue, standard preference changes are different from adaptive ones in that, in cases of standard preference change, an agent downgrades an alternative in virtue of its undesirable properties, whereas an adaptive agent will downgrade an alternative in virtue of its desirable properties. Because none of the factors that explain an agent’s adaptive preference can justify a preference change with such a character, adaptive agents lack sufficient reason for their preference change. Or, at least, they lack what is sometimes called a sufficient ‘content-related’ reason for their preference change. Instead, I argue that an adaptive preference is a preference formed for the Wrong Kind of Reason, where attitudes formed for the Wrong Kind of Reason are frequently thought to be irrational.\n\nApril 23: Ms. Maggie Taylor (University of Colorado)\n\n\"Is That All There Is? COVID-19 and Wittgenstein's Family Resemblances\"\n\nApril 30: Dr. Samuel Director (University of Colorado Boulder)\n\n“On Cancel Culture\"\n\nThis talk seeks to examine the term \"cancel culture.\" I have two main goals. First, I want to offer an intuitive definition of cancel culture, which may be useful in assessing how and when we use the term. I believe that the definition I offer helps to sort out different forms of cancellation and makes it clear when, for example, politicians claiming to be cancelled are in fact just being criticized. Second, I want to explore arguments against cancel culture, reaching the ultimate conclusion that cancel culture is very bad for society.\n\nAugust 28: Tim Burkhardt (Snider Scholar in Residence, Benson Center for the Study of Western Civilization)\n\n\"B-B-B-Bad to be Born: Epicureanism and the Badness of Birth\"\n\nLucretius noticed that our fear of death is not matched by a similar loathing of birth, even though prenatal and posthumous nonexistence seem relevantly similar. This thought inspires the contemporary symmetry argument, which claims that birth and death are prudentially symmetrical: if either of the two can be bad for us, then so can the other. Together with the claim that our births cannot be bad for us, this entails that our deaths cannot be bad for us either-a conclusion which most philosophers of death reject. Their most common criticism of the symmetry argument is that birth and death differ in prudentially relevant ways. Some think the difference lies in the impossibility of being born substantially earlier than one was, whereas it is not impossible to die substantially later. Others claim that the difference lies in our temporal biases: we prefer to have goods in our futures rather than our pasts, and whereas our births deprive us of past goods, our deaths deprive us of the preferred future ones. My position is different: I reject both premises of the symmetry argument but accept its conclusion. In order to defend this position, the bulk of my talk will be concerned with sketching an account of how and when our births can be bad for us. I will then offer a brief explanation for why this account does not produce similar implications when applied to death. In doing so, I reach the surprising conclusion that our births can be bad for us even though our deaths cannot be. I close by suggesting that the prudentially relevant difference between birth and death is due to features which are far more obvious than those to which philosophers of death usually appeal.\n\nIf you missed this talk or want to hear it again, click here for a Zoom recording.

There are a number of competing explanations for why this is, and sophisticated defenses of each. Which explanation is correct? I show how to answer this question by focusing on an often ignored aspect of ethics: degrees of wrongness.\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\n\nSeptember 11: Iskra Fileva\n\n\"The Games We Play with Truth and Beauty\"\n\nSuppose I tell you that the irises on Van Gogh's painting Irises are blue. You would be perfectly justified in acquiring the belief that they are blue on the basis of my say-so. But suppose I tell you that Van Gogh's Irises --- which you haven't seen -- is a beautiful painting. Can you acquire the belief that the painting is beautiful on the basis of my testimony?\n\nPessimists about aesthetic testimony argue that you cannot. Opinions differ regarding the details. Some pessimists claim that you won't be justified in forming the belief that Irises is a beautiful painting on the basis of my testimony. Others contend that while you may be justified, you shouldn't form aesthetic beliefs in that way.\n\nI am going to suggest that pessimists are mistaken. Other people's testimony -- provided others are qualified to judge -- is a perfectly good basis for aesthetic beliefs. It can provide adequate justification and there is no non-epistemic norm against relying on others' testimony. However, the sorts of cases pessimists appeal to in order to motivate pessimism have some intuitive force. We therefore need an account that explains why that is. My purpose in this talk is to develop such an account. On the view I propose, aesthetic life is complex. We want to know the truth about beauty and other aesthetic properties, but we have other important goals. We might say, there are different games we play in aesthetic life. The pessimists' error is in that they focus on the wrong kind of game.\n\nJoin Zoom meeting: https://cuboulder.zoom.us/j/97345443559\n\nSeptember 18: Dale Dorsey (Professor of Philosophy, University of Kansas)\n\n\"The Aesthetic Life?\"\n\nWe often think that aesthetic values have a role to play in the good life: appreciation of, engagement with, etc., of such values tends to be a good thing for a person. But it is generally held that, though engagement, say, with aesthetic values can be good, it would be absurd to say that the aesthetic value of a life itself can be good for a person. After all, aesthetically good lives can be horribly tragic (MacBeth), fraught with misfortune (Odysseus), or fools (Falstaff). In this talk, I challenge this general skepticism. First, I say a little about what it might mean for a life itself to possess aesthetic value. Second, I discuss some reasons against the suggestion that the aesthetic life can be good. Finally, I (somewhat tentatively) conclude that the aesthetic value of a life can be good for the person who lives it, and that we have little reason to look so askance at this thesis.\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\n\nSeptember 25: Jessica Flanigan (Laurance S. Rockefeller Visiting Faculty Fellow at Princeton University, Richard L. Morrill Chair in Ethics and Democratic Values, University of Richmond)\n\n\"Procreation and Sustainability\"\n\nIs having babies bad for the environment? Is procreation so environmentally bad that people have moral reasons to avoid having kids? In this essay I defend natalism against environmentalist challenges. My central claim is that having kids isn’t as bad for the environment as many people seem to think, and that having kids would still be permissible and good even if it were bad for the environment. I begin in section 1 by describing the anti-natalist environmentalism. On this view, people have duties to protect the environment and satisfying these duties is inconsistent with creating new people. I then show in section 2 that anti-natalist environmentalists often exaggerate the negative environmental impact of children, and they do not consider the positive effects that higher fertility rights can have on the environment. In section 3, I make the case that discouraging people from having children, even if successful, would be one of the least effective ways of addressing climate change compared to other commonly cited solutions. In section 4, I argue that even if procreation were harmful to the environment on balance, that would not be a sufficient moral reason to justify discouraging people from having children anyhow. I continue with this argument in section 5, where I argue that parents and children can adopt behaviors and invest in environmental offsets that compensate for whatever harms they inflict on the environment.\n\nOctober 2: Leo Yan (Professor of Philosophy, Indiana University Pennsylvania)\n\n\"Nondeterminacy and Lexical Priority\"\n\nIt is plausible that certain values admit of nondeterminacy so that they allow for some items to be neither better than, worse than, nor equal to some other items with respect to that value. Anders Herlitz has recently argued that such nondeterminacy poses a number of potentially serious problems for both axiology and rational choice. In particular, he has shown how the nondeterminacy of values can result in cyclical value orderings and choice situations that violate Basic Contraction Consistency. In this talk, I show how these problems arise not from nondeterminacy alone but from nondeterminacy in conjunction with the lexical priority of some values over others. That is, cyclical orderings and violations of Basic Contraction Consistency will not occur in cases of nondeterminacy where lexical priority is not involved. However, I will also show that even in the absence of lexical priority, there is a temptation to use certain intuitively compelling principles that are similar in spirit to those used in cases of lexical priority. While the application of these principles does not result in cyclical orderings or violations of Basic Contraction Consistency, they do result in other problematic commitments. What’s more, the solution that Herlitz proposes cannot be used in these new cases since his solution cannot be justified in the absence of lexical priority. Finally, I suggest that the right response to these new cases is to reject the intuitively compelling principles and that this response in turn sheds light on what we should do in cases involving lexical priority as well.\n\nOctober 9: Scott Hill\n\n\"A Defense of Reparations\"\n\nI defend a new argument for reparations that builds on and combines elements of Boonin’s Compensation Argument and Boxill’s Inheritance Argument. A problem for Boonin’s argument is that it doesn’t go far enough in identifying what is uniquely owed to people who are descended from U.S. slaves. A problem for Boxill’s argument is that it depends on questionable premises. My argument does not have these problems. It extends Boonin’s modest premises in defense of an even more ambitious conclusion about reparations than Boonin himself defends. And it does so without relying on the sorts of controversial premises on which Boxill’s insightful argument depends.\n\nThe talk does not presuppose acquaintance with the paper. However, for those who may want to read it first Scott has provided this link:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1pTUo0Zw_rtjYzKJi_-Fw0rF_ZW1IpW_C25vrTXKDn-M/edit?usp=sharing\n\nOctober 16: Spencer Case (International Research Fellow, Wuhan University)\n\n\"Small Evils and Live Options\"\n\nI bring issues in metaethics to bear on the evidential problem of evil, with the aim of showing that knowledge of horrendous evils is compatible with the epistemic rationality of theism. Many atheists and theists agree that small, broadly dispersed evils don’t pose a very strong challenge to theism. At least such evils pose less of a problem for theism than large, concentrated (“horrendous”) evils like the Nazi Holocaust. Elsewhere, philosophers have given interesting arguments for value additivity, which entails that there’s no intrinsic moral difference between causing/allowing horrendous evils and causing/allowing many small harms with the same total disvalue. If both claims can reasonably be accepted – that the existence of small evils fails to refute theism, and that horrendous evils aren’t inherently different from small evils of the same total disvalue – then an interesting, and heretofore unexplored, strategy for defending theism becomes available. For we can then reasonably say that the large, concentrated evils are no more evidence against theism than small evils are. Therefore, the evidential argument from evil is significantly less compelling than it appears when we focus on cases of horrendous evil. Belief in God can be a “live option” for someone who accepts value additivity,\n\nJan 17: Scott Hill (Snider Scholar in Residence, Benson Center for the Study of Western Civilization)\n\n\"A Problem for Some Defenses of Markets in Sex\"\n\nAbstract: Some philosophers think markets in sex should be permitted. They agree that prohibition of such markets enjoys intuitive support. But they think the relevant intuitions are subject to various debunking arguments. I show that these arguments, if sound, would also debunk the intuitions that support the prohibition of markets in sex with children.\n\nTuesday, Jan. 21 12:30-1:30: Caleb Perl (Instructor, CU Department of Philosophy)\n\n\"Positivist Consequentialism\"\n\nAbstract: This talk introduces and defends a new kind of rule consequentialism - `positivist consequentialism' - that cleanly solves a range of problems for classic rule consequentialism. The talk begins with the complaint that rule consequentialism involves an objectionable kind of rule worship, and shows how positivist consequentialism answers the complaint. In fact, I think positivist consequentialism solves all the classic problems for rule consequentialism, though I won't have time to discuss all of them - but I'll close by suggesting that it has a better shot at being the one true ethical theory than traditional rivals.\n\nJan 24: Matthew Kopec (Research Fellow, Australian National University)\n\n\"A New Precautionary Principle for Manufactured Uncertainty\"\n\nAbstract: Many have proposed so-called 'precautionary principles' to guide policy makers through decisions made under conditions of serious uncertainty. Typically, these principles hold that when we have good reasons to believe that a choice carries some possibility of serious, irreversible harm, we can abandon our usual cost-benefit analyses and instead simply rule out that choice as a matter of precaution. Although such precautionary principles have intuitive appeal, they have also faced serious criticism and are employed, in practice, only intermittently at present. In this talk, I present a novel justification for taking precautionary measures in cases of uncertainty that bypasses much of the criticism. In particular, often times certain corporate entities - e.g. fossil fuel companies, big agriculture, chemical manufactures, and the like - are directly responsible for the uncertainty facing policy makers, and these very same entities are the ones that stand to gain when precautionary measures are not taken. I argue that in such cases of 'manufactured uncertainty', what I call the Pragmatic Precautionary Principle ought to be triggered, as a strategic way to level the information playing field. I finish by sketching how we can justify applying the Pragmatic Precautionary Principle in a wider range of cases than is typical, since we can rightly apply the principle even in cases where (1) we lack a strong scientific basis for the possibility, seriousness, or irreversibility of harm and (2) we have no feasible way to measure the costs the relevant corporate entities would incur by our taking precautionary measures.\n\nJan 31: C.E. Abbate (Assistant Professor of Philosophy, UNLV)\n\n\"What Epistemology Can Tell Us About Moral Responsibility for Meat Eating\"\n\nA widely accepted view in epistemology is that we don’t have direct control over our beliefs. And we surely don’t have as much control over our beliefs as we have over simple actions. For instance, you can, if offered $1,000, immediately throw your hamburger in the trash, but a meat eater can’t, at will, start believing that eating animals is wrong to secure a $1,000 reward. Yet, even though we have more control over our behavior than we have over our beliefs, some of our behavior, especially moral behavior, is heavily influenced by our beliefs. Meat eating is one example. So, if we don’t have direct control over our beliefs and our beliefs influence our moral behavior, it’s no wonder meat eaters aren’t immediately boycotting McDonald’s and lining up for the Impossible Burger after reading Alastair Norcross’s paper on meat eating. Are meat eaters, then, morally excused for their harm-causing dietary behavior? And what needs to take place for meat eaters to change their beliefs regarding the moral significance of meat eating and, consequently, their animal-eating behavior? In this presentation, I propose answers to these questions.\n\nFeb. 7: Ben Hale (CU Associate Professor of Environmental Studies and Philosophy)\n\n\"Incommensurability and Indeterminacy in Consumer Choice\"\n\nAbstract: In this paper I argue against the idea that demand-side decisions on the part of individual consumers can adequately capture the complicated moral dimensions of any given product. I argue this position by pointing to two intermingled features of consumer choice: value incommensurability and market indeterminacy.\n\nFeb. 14: Brian Talbot (Assistant Professor of Philosophy, CU)\n\n\"Deontology for actions, consequentialism for beliefs\"\n\nWhile consequentialist approaches to ethics and epistemology are both counter-intuitive, consequentialist epistemology is the more seemingly implausible of the two. Even so, no matter how attractive we find deontological ethics, we should be consequentialists about epistemology.\n\nFeb. 21: Sam Director (PhD Student, CU Department of Philosophy)\n\n\"Of Blood Transfusions and Feeding Tubes: Anorexia-Nervosa and Consent\"\n\nIndividuals suffering from anorexia-nervosa experience dysmorphic perceptions of their body and desire to act on these perceptions by refusing food. In some cases, anorexics even want to refuse food to the point of dying. In this paper, I answer the following question: if an anorexic, A, wants to give consent to refuse food when the food would either be life-saving or prevent serious bodily harm, can A’s consent be valid? I argue that there is compelling reason to think that anorexics can give valid consent to refuse food, even in these extreme circumstances. My argument for this conclusion is based on the following cases:\n\nJehovah’s Witness: a Jehovah’s Witness (JW) is brought into the ER with a severe injury which will require her to get a blood transfusion to survive. She expresses her religious belief that this is not permissible. The doctors try to persuade her that she must get the transfusion, otherwise she will die. She persists in refusing, even after understanding all of the ramifications of her decision.\n\nAnorexia: an individual with anorexia (A) is so malnourished and thin that she is near death. She is brought to the ER. The doctors explain to her that she must eat if she is to remain alive. But, A explains to the doctors that she doesn’t want to eat the food, even though she understands that she will die if she doesn’t.\n\nIt seems clear to me that most people’s initial intuitions are that JW can validly consent to refuse the transfusion and that A cannot give valid consent to refuse food. Based on these cases, my argument will proceed as follows: I argue that there is no reason to believe that JW can consent and that A cannot consent. Any purported reason that JW can consent and that A cannot consent either (1) applies equally to JW or (2) is independently implausible as a reason to invalidate A’s consent. This leads to the conclusion that A can give valid consent to refuse life-saving food.\n\nFeb. 28 Renaud-Philippe Garner (Renaud-Philippe.Garner@colorado.edu)\n\n\"We are what you were, we will be what you are: Depersonalised flourishing\"\n\nThis paper argues that collective or depersonalised flourishing is an important part of the human good although it is often misunderstood or ignored. Depersonalised flourishing differs from personalised flourishing on two dimensions. One, the relevant self-understanding engaged is collective: one is numerically distinct and qualitatively indistinct. Two, the activity or practice subordinates individual success to collective success: if we do not succeed, you do not succeed.\n\nThe first part of the paper summarizes the standard ‘individualistic view of flourishing by drawing on some well-known authors and passages. The second part identifies some cases that are hard to explain when viewed according to an individualistic view of flourishing. In particular, I focus on cases of mass mobilization and political activity. In the third part, I examine the psychological mechanism at the heart of collective flourishing: depersonalisation. In the fourth part, I present my view of collective flourishing. Special attention is given to the importance of self-understanding, shared narrative, and the link between participation in collective action and shared claims to success. Finally, I briefly discuss some upshots and objections.\n\nMarch 13: Javiera Perez Gomez (Assistant Professor of Philosophy, Metropolitan State University of Denver)\n\nOnline via Zoom: https://cuboulder.zoom.us/j/7827795943\n\nMeeting ID: 782 779 5943\n\n\"Indirect Benefits, Race, and Double Jeopardy in the Allocation of Scarce Lifesaving Resources\"\n\nWhen laypeople are asked to allocate scarce medical resources, they tend to appeal to the benefits that a candidate would bring about for society. Many bioethicists assume that doing this would be wrong; yet the arguments that have been offered for this view are surprisingly weak. By recruiting the notion of ‘double jeopardy,’ I seek to offer a stronger foundation for the view that an allocation scheme that counted benefit to society would be wrong. As I argue, there are two concepts of ‘double jeopardy,’ weak and strong, and the latter is sometimes worse than the former. With these concepts in hand, I then argue that in the contemporary U.S., an allocation scheme that counted benefit to society would risk putting black Americans in strong double jeopardy and would thereby amount to a grave wrong.\n\nMarch 20: Anthony Kelley (PhD Student, CU Department of Philosophy)\n\nOnline via Zoom: https://cuboulder.zoom.us/j/7827795943\n\nMeeting ID: 782 779 5943\n\n\"What Should the Desire Theorist Say about Ill-Being?\"\n\nProponents and critics of the desire theory of well-being have narrowly focused on the positive side of the theory while virtually ignoring its negative side. On the positive side, the desire theorist says that getting what you want is basically good for you. But what should the desire theorist say about what is basically bad for you? On the frustration theory, failing to get what you want is bad for you. This view implies, implausibly, that being made worse off is just a matter of failing to procure a benefit. The theory also has a problem with accommodating the dissonance constraint, the doctrine that there must be a certain kind of dissonance or estrangement between a person and the things that are basically bad for her. I argue that the desire theorist should instead go in for the aversion theory of ill-being, the view according to which getting what you are averse to is bad for you. I defend the view from the objection that it implies, implausibly, that something can be both basically good and basically bad for a person.\n\nApril 3: Graham Oddie\n\nOnline via Zoom: https://cuboulder.zoom.us/j/7827795943\n\nMeeting ID: 782 779 5943\n\n\"Can Hume’s true judges diverge and still yield an objective aesthetic value ordering?\"\n\nHume famously argued that despite widespread disagreements in aesthetic sentiments in the populace at large, there is, nevertheless an objectivestandard of taste: “a rule by which the various sentiments of men can be reconciled, or at least a decision reached that confirms one sentiment and condemns another” (Hume). This standard is underwritten by the aesthetic judgements oftrue judges. True judges are those who possess the following attributes: \"Strong sense, united to delicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by comparison, and cleared of all prejudice.” Hume claims that “the joint verdict of [those who have these attributes], wherever they are to be found, is the true standard of taste.” The most widely accepted criticism of Hume’s proposal is that there is no compelling reason to think that Hume’s true judges will converge in their judgements of aesthetic merit. Those who have defended Hume’s satndard have felt it necessary to deny the possibility of such divergence, and that just seems implausible. I will show that one can save Hume’s theory of aesthetic value comparison by applying a new and rather attractive account of value relations, one developed by Wlodek Rabinowich within the fitting attitude program. I argue that the verdicts of true judges can indeed diverge without that imperiling a Humean theory of an objective aesthetic value ordering.\n\nApril 10: Kate C.S.

This type of case presents an interesting puzzle as the person who lies may have no intent to deceive and does not mislead anyone, yet it intuitively seems like an action working against a community's epistemic goals. In this talk, I focus on cases where individuals are intentionally placed into situations where they must tell a bald-faced lie (e.g., Galileo telling the Catholic Church and the public that he no longer believes in the truth of his work). In these cases, individuals are mistreated as epistemic subjects by being forced to participate in this practice of telling a bald-faced lie. Specifically, they might fittingly feel epistemic humiliation and, as a result, have their self-confidence and efficacy undermined.\n\nApril 17: Luc Bovens (UNC Chapel Hill) and Luke Davis (UNC Chapel Hill)\n\nOnline via Zoom: https://cuboulder.zoom.us/j/7827795943\n\nMeeting ID: 782 779 5943\n\n“Polarization of Political Value Profiles in the General Social Survey Data”\n\nWe examine the 2018 General Social Survey data to paint a surprising picture of how race, gender, community type, age and education levels affect views on issues that polarize liberals and conservatives, such as abortion, gay marriage, gun control, climate change, support for the military, welfare payments, health care … What stands do various demographic groups tend to take on each of these issues?

In this paper, I extend Bradley J. Strawser’s principle of unnecessary risk (PUR) to cover psychological and moral risk. PUR asserts that states should avoid exposing their soldiers to unnecessary lethal risk. Of course, lethal risk is not the only type of risk that modern soldiers face. Psychological risk, including PTSD, and moral risk (such as the risk of killing a non-combatant unjustly) have a severe and negative impact on our soldiers. I then show that the extended PUR provides strong prima facie reasons for the development and deployment of technologically sophisticated AWS. Finally, I respond to two recent in-principle objections to AWS, demonstrating that these objections do not outweigh the normative force of the extended PUR.\n\nThis event will take place online.

According to Allan Gibbard and others, the normative question of what one should do is just the practical question of what to do. To judge that one should φ is to decide to φ. This is an account of first-personal normative deliberation. But of course we make judgments about what others should do as well. We reason about whether our friend should leave her marriage, whether the government’s response to the crisis is appropriate, etc. The nature of third-personal judgments of the form X should φ is that they involve endorsements of other peoples’ actions. Is this deliberation also practical in nature? If so, what is the practical question addressed?
