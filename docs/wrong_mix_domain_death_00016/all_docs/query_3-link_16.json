        "text": "It is generally assumed that in early modern Britain, chivalry—allegedly typified by the Crusades—was considered a negative or even ridiculous ideology until its rehabilitation by the pre-Romantic movement. However, this paper argues that Hume and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers had already shown a deep interest in its historical role and influence on modern civilization. That Hume shared a broad interest in chivalry with contemporary philosophers does not undermine the novelty of his thought on this topic. In fact, the pioneering and unique aspects of his contributions can be clarified by setting them in context.\n\nThis essay takes on two tasks. First it updates the standard list of eighteenth-century British reviews of Hume's writings by providing references to additional reviews which do not appear in the Hume literature. To Jessop's list of eighteen British reviews, thirteen new reviews are listed for first edition publications of Hume's writings, and eight new reviews are listed for eighteenth-century abridgments and collections containing Hume's writings. Second, this essay presents a history of the early British review journals and a discussion of the scholarly merits of the Hume reviews.\n\nTo expose or to kill the children is an ancient Greek and a modern Chinese practice, which is caused by poverty and the terror of too numerous a family. Is it more barbarous than the modern French custom of closing children into convents? Is it more unfavourable to the population? In the name of an \"odd connexion of causes\" and the \"force of natural affection\", Hume argues that the practice of the ancient Greeks is «almost as innocent and more effectual» than that of the French, and \"might rather render those times more populous\". A short account of the interpretations of the practice in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, and a survey of Hume’s sources in \"A Dialogue\" and \"Of the Populousness of Antient Nations\", show the singularity of Hume’s view, which was, as he politely puts it, \"not altogether in opposition\" to Montesquieu.\n\nHume’s Letter from a Gentleman is an important document for Hume scholarship because, among other things, it serves as a useful tool for the interpretation and analysis of Hume’s philosophical intentions in the Treatise. The Letter itself, however, raises several difficult problems of interpretation. One of the most important of these concerns the identity of Hume’s “accuser“-the author of A Specimen of the Principles concerning Religion and Morality &c., to which Hume is responding in the Letter. Clearly the interpretation of the Letter, and its relevance to the Treatise, will vary depending on who is identified as the source of the accusations against Hume, and what is made of this person’s motivation and philosophical commitments. The immediate difficulty is that the Specimen is presented anonymously, and thus conjectures must be made about the author on the basis of available evidence.\n\nMy principal objective in this essay will be to show that the widely held view that Hume's Treatise' is not significantly or \"directly\" concerned with problems of religion is seriously mistaken.2 I shall approach this issue by way of an examination of a major skeptical theme which runs throughout the Treatise, namely, Hume's skepticism regarding the powers of demonstrative reason. In this paper I shall be especially concerned to bring to light the full significance of this skeptical theme by placing Hume's arguments in their appropriate historical context. I shall show that both Hume and his contemporaries recognized that these important skeptical arguments were aimed primarily against the dogmatic Christian rationalism of John Locke and above all Samuel Clarke, and that they were, therefore, well aware that these arguments had considerable theological significance.\n\nDerived from my presentation at the Hume Society conference in Las Vegas, NV in 2003. This paper considers the development of Hume's thought on luxury through several works leading up to the publication of \"Of Luxury\" (later retitled \"Of Refinement in the Arts\") in 1752. This includes the little-known \"A True Account of the Behaviour and Conduct of Archibald Stewart, Esq.\", whose significance for the \"luxury debate\" does not appear to have been recognized previously. The final section of the paper consists in an analysis of Hume's argument in \"Of Refinement in the Arts\"."
