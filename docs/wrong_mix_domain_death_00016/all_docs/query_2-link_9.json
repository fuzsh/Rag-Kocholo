Is there really something wrong with saying, \"Hopefully, we'll have a good century?\" or \"Where is the library at?\", or \"There is no way to correctly split an infinitive.\" Is grammatical purity just snobbism?\n\nIs This Any Way to Run a Democracy? 2004 Nov 2\n\nIs This Any Way to Run a Democracy?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nAmerica prides itself on being the oldest continuous democracy in the world. But criticisms of the America system are widespread.Our system is tailored to narrow interests and wealthyelites. Our two partieslock out alternative voices. Ourvoting procedures discourage participation and lead to unrepresentative outcomes. Is this really the best way to run a democracy? Join John and Ken as they examine the philosophicalunderpinnings of democracy in America.\n\nThe Promise and Perils of the New Genomics 2007 Jan 7\n\nThe Promise and Perils of the New Genomics\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nJohn and Ken welcome their special guest, noted scientist and entrepreneur, Craig Venter. From the mapping of the human genome, to the patenting of synthetic life forms, to bio-prospecting for genetic gold in the depths of the oceans and the deepest reaches of the world's rain forests, Craig Venter has been at the forefront of a revolution in genomics. Join the hosts and their guest as they explore the ethical, legal, and economic issues associated with the new genomics. This program was recorded in front of a live audience at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC.\n\nIf Truth is so valuable, why is there so much BS? 2007 Jan 28\n\nIf Truth is so valuable, why is there so much BS?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nEverywhere we look -- in the media, in our political campaigns, in the hallowed halls of the academy -- we are confronted with an endless stream of BS, spin, propaganda, half-truths, and even outright lies. Yet for centuries, philosophers have argued that the pursuit of truth is both intrinsically good and instrumentally useful. But if truth is really both good and useful, then why is there so much BS around? John and Ken welcome Harry Frankfurt, author of On Bullshit and On Truth, to discuss the relative value and utility of Truth and its alternatives .\n\nWhere Does Morality Come From? 2007 Jul 1\n\nWhere Does Morality Come From?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nSchool teachers, preachers, parents, and even a few philosophers often claim to be authorities on the dictates of morality. But where does morality really come from? From society s customs? From God s commandments? From the cold, impersonal commandments of pure reason? Or from human emotions and sentiments? Join John as Ken as they explore the meaning and origins of morality.\n\nIs it Wrong to Wreck the Earth? 2010 Jan 3\n\nIs it Wrong to Wreck the Earth?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nThere are too many people, doing too much damage to the ecosystem, essentially guaranteeing that future generations will have a damaged Earth, and will have to invest incredible amounts of time, money and labor to repairing what can be repaired. But future generations are made up of people who don't yet exist what obligations do we have to them? And what obligations, if any, do we have to our fellow fauna and the flora we all depend on? Ken and John welcome environmental ethicist and celebrated author Kathleen Moore for a program recorded in front of a live audience at Oregon State University in Corvallis.\n\nThe Military: What is it Good for? 2011 Nov 27\n\nThe Military: What is it Good for?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nIs the military draft a natural expression of democratic values, or a challenge to our most basic concepts of individual rights and liberties? Are the values that make for an effective military consistent with the values that make for a free and democratic republic? If the government must have the power to defend the nation, does it follow that it must have the power to control events around the entire world? John and Ken enlist themselves in a discussion of the military and its role in public life with Pulitzer Prize winning historian David Kennedy, for a program recorded live at the Marsh theatre in San Francisco.\n\nPoetry as a Way of Knowing 2012 Apr 1\n\nPoetry as a Way of Knowing\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nWhat is poetry? Mere word play? A pretty, or at any rate striking, way of expressing thought and emotion? Or does great poetry involve an approach to the world that provides insight and information not available in other ways? Ken and John explore how poetry can illuminate what we know with award-winning poet Jane Hirshfield, author of Come, Thief and other poetic works of philosophical richness. This program was recorded live at the Marsh Theatre in Berkeley.\n\nWhat Are Leaders Made of? 2012 Apr 15\n\nWhat Are Leaders Made of?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nThere seems to be a paradox in leadership: the qualities of ruthlessness and opportunism necessary to attain power and become a leader are not necessarily the qualities of morality and a sense of justice that make for a good leader. Do the traits that make it likely that someone will become a leader correlate positively or negatively with the traits that make a good and effective leader? Do our democratic institutions lead to better leaders than, say, a lottery like the Athenians used? Ken and John ask what leaders are and should be made of with Stanford Law Professor Deborah Rhode, co-author of Moral Leadership: The Theory and Practice of Power, Judgment, and Policy. This program was recorded live at the Marsh Theatre in Berkeley.\n\nWhat Might Have Been 2012 Jun 10\n\nWhat Might Have Been\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nWhen we make claims about things that could have been \"what philosophers call counterfactual statements \"we are, in some sense, sliding between different worlds. We all use counterfactual statements frequently. But what would make our speculations about what might have been in a different scenario true or false? When I say things could have gone differently than they did, I am speaking of a possible world in which things did, in fact, go differently. But how do we make sense of this talk of possible worlds? How can there be facts other than facts about the actual world? John and Ken consider the possibilities with Laurie Paul from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, co-author of Causation: A User's Guide .\n\nIdentities Lost Found in a Global Age 2012 Jul 1\n\nIdentities Lost & Found in a Global Age\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents note\n\nThroughout human history, people have tended to live and die in the place they're born. Place is an important part of identity. But what happens when people are deprived of this sense of place? What psychological effects do emigrants, exiles, and expatriates endure? What happens to the importance of place when community membership can be based on common interests among people linked by email and facebook? John and Ken situate themselves with UC Berkeley English Professor Bharati Mukherjee, author of Miss New Indiaand other novels exploring migration, alienation, and identity. This program was recorded live at the Marsh theatre in Berkeley.\n\nAre Some People Smarter than Others? 2012 Dec 2\n\nAre Some People Smarter than Others?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents\n\nEgalitarian principles play an important role in our moral and political discourse. Yet there's no doubt that some people are smarter, stronger, or more talented in certain respects than others. So was Thomas Jefferson wrong to think that all men are created equal? Might we reasonably think that some people are better than others? If so, should the \"elite\" be treated differently? Should we, for example, find immoral acts committed by a great artist less reprehensible than the same acts committed by a common person? John and Ken level the playing field with Thomas Hurka from the University of Toronto, author of The Best Things In Life: A Guide To What Really Matters .\n\nThe Examined Year - 2012 2013 Jan 6\n\nThe Examined Year - 2012\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents\n\nA new year offers an opportunity to reflect on the significant events of the previous year. But what ideas and events took shape over the past twelve months that have prompted us to question our assumptions and to think about things in new ways? Join John, Ken, and their special guests as they celebrate the examined year with a philosophical look back at 2012.\n\n• The Year in Philosophy: Barbara Grosz from the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences discusses the legacy of Alan Turing, whose centennial was celebrated in 2012. • The Year in Politics: Jason Stanley from Rutgers University explores the precarious place of Truth in the presidential election and beyond. • The Year in Science: Hank Greely from the Stanford Law School talks about the ethical and legal implications of the year's advances in genetics.\n\nDance as a Way of Knowing 2013 Apr 14\n\nDance as a Way of Knowing\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (pdf)\n\nScope and Contents\n\nWhether it be rhythmic or shuffling, athletic or pedestrian, erotic or just social, dance is an art form that utilizes movement of the body through space. Could the aesthetic experience of being physically present and embodied in the world be considered a way of knowing? Is there something in particular we can come to know by watching or performing dance? And are there broader lessons that dance can teach us about human perception and action? John and Ken hit the floor with Alva Noë from UC Berkeley, author of Varieties of Presence. This program was recorded live at the Marsh Theater in Berkeley.\n\nGood, Evil, and the Divine Plan 2013 May 5\n\nGood, Evil, and the Divine Plan\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents\n\nA theodicy is an explanation by a philosopher or theologian about why a world created by a kind and all-powerful God contains so much suffering. It forces us to think about the nature of good and evil, about whether the kind of knowledge an all-knowing God has leaves room for human freedom. Why do people who suffer often find their faith in God growing stronger? Is evil an illusion? Does God really need a defense attorney? John and Ken search for insight with Andrew Pinsent, Research Director of the Ian Ramsey Centre for Science and Religion at Oxford University.\n\nFaith, Reason and the Art of Living 2013 May 19\n\nFaith, Reason and the Art of Living\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents\n\nIt sounds plausible to require that all our beliefs be based on evidence and sound reasoning. Yet some people's most cherished beliefs, like their belief in a deity, are based on faith alone. Does that make those beliefs fundamentally irrational, or could there be some rational justification for such faith? And what about reason itself—are there limits to what can be known rationally? Does our reliance on reason demand a kind of faith of its own? Is there a way to reconcile faith and reason, or does the well-lived life demand that we choose one over the other? John Ken put reasonable faith in Howard Wettstein from UC Riverside, author of The Significance of Religious Experience. This program was recorded live on campus as part of the Stanford Continuing Studies course The Art of Living.\n\nAn Eye for an Eye: The Morality of Revenge 2013 Oct 13\n\nAn Eye for an Eye: The Morality of Revenge\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents\n\nWe are often taught that vengeance is a reprehensible or unworthy motivation and that, as a result, pursuing revenge should not be the method of choice when meting out punishment for crimes. Incarceration and other penalties, according to this view, can only be justified in as much as they protect society, rehabilitate criminals, or deter further crime. But are these approaches to punishment really more just than the retributive or vengeance model? Don't the victims of crime deserve some kind of payback for their suffering? Are justice and revenge in conflict with one another, or do they actually go hand in hand? John and Ken trade favors with Thane Rosenbaum from the Fordham Law School, author ofPayback: The Case For Revenge.\n\nWhen Is It Wrong to Save a Life? Lessons from the Trolley Problem 2013 Oct 20\n\nWhen Is It Wrong to Save a Life? Lessons from the Trolley Problem\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents\n\nA trolley is approaching a track junction, and you happen to be standing by the switch. If you do nothing, the trolley will kill a number of innocent children playing on the tracks. If you throw the switch, it will kill only one fat man, who is sleeping on the tracks. The so-called Trolley Problem sheds light on many claims in moral philosophy: utilitarian positions (doing what's best for the greatest number), the difference between doing and letting happen (being more obliged to not cause harm than to prevent harm), and issues of \"collateral damage\" (killing one person to save others). John and Ken ride the trolley with Thomas Cathcart, author of The Trolley Problem, or Would You Throw the Fat Guy Off the Bridge: A Philosophical Conundrum.\n\nThe Examined Year - 2013 2014 Jan 5\n\nThe Examined Year - 2013\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents\n\nA new year offers an opportunity to reflect on the significant events of the previous year. But what ideas and events took shape over the past twelve months that have prompted us to question our assumptions and to think about things in new ways? Join John, Ken, and their special guests as they celebrate the examined year with a philosophical look back at 2013.\n\n• The Year in Philosophy and Gender: Linda Alcoff from City University of New York looks at events in 2013 that have higlighted the evolving but still-fraught nature of gender in academia. • The Year in Whistleblowing and Hacktivism: Peter Ludlow from Northwestern University examines the ethics of leakers like Edward Snowden and Pvt. Manning (sentenced in 2013) who have claimed the moral high ground in their actions. • The Year in Dysfunctional Democracy: Jon Elster from Columbia University explores the breakdown of democratic process in the US, including the work of political scientist Juan Linz, who passed away in 2013.\n\nSeeing Red: The World in Color 2014 May 4\n\nSeeing Red: The World in Color\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents\n\nIs the red you see indeed the very same red that anyone else does? What is the redness of red even like? These sorts of questions are not just amusing, if worn-out, popular philosophical ponderings. Thinkers in the philosophy of perception take such questions as serious windows into the nature of the world and of the mind. Although we are constantly surrounded by colors, the experience of perceiving them – what it is like to see red, for example - remains a mysterious phenomenon. Where are colors: in objects, or in our minds? Could color experiences ever be explainable in terms of raw physical facts? Or is there something about color that goes beyond what science can teach us? John and Ken go full spectrum with Jonathan Cohen from UC San Diego, author of The Red and the Real: An Essay on Color Ontology .\n\nThe Reality of Time 2014 May 18\n\nThe Reality of Time\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents\n\nSt. Augustine suggested that when we try to grasp the idea of time, it seems to evade us: \"What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know.\" So is time real or merely an artificial construct? Is time a fundamental or emergent property of our universe or a part of our cognitive apparatus? Do we live in a continuum with a definite past and present, or do we live in a succession of 'Nows', and if the latter is the case, how does it affect our perception of memory or recollection? John and Ken take their time with Julian Barbour from the University of Oxford, author of The End of Time: The Next Revolution in Physics .\n\nAm I Alone? 2014 Jun 1\n\nAm I Alone?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents\n\nA popular theme in science fiction is the eerily lifelike robot: a piece of machinery so well engineered that its outputs pass for genuinely human behaviors. Technology is not yet so advanced, but these robots might cause us to wonder how we could possibly justify our belief in the minds of others. You're most likely sure that your family, friends, and boss are really people just like you, with similarly rich inner mental lives. But how can you be so sure? If we only have access to our own private thoughts, can we ever know that our minds are not unique? I think, therefore I exist – but what about everybody else? John and Ken step outside themselves with Anita Avramides, from the University of Oxford, author of Other Minds.\n\nWhy Is There Something Rather Than Nothing? 405 2016-04-10\n\nWhy Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents\n\nThe old metaphysical question – why anything exists at all – has perplexed and intrigued humankind for ages. It has long been a question reserved for philosophers, but now some physicists claim to have answered it. Yet these attempts have raised questions of their own: is this even a meaningful question in the first place? Can it be answered by science alone, or is philosophy necessary? And what will answering the question mean for us? John and Ken find something to talk about with Jim Holt, author of Why Does The World Exist: An Existential Detective Story.\n\nAffirmative Action - Too Little or Too Much? 407 2016-05-08\n\nAffirmative Action - Too Little or Too Much?\n\nPhysical Description: 1 computer file(s) (mp3)\n\nScope and Contents\n\nAddressing our nation's history of racial injustice can be a truly backbreaking endeavor. Race-based affirmative action is usually thought of as one such effort, and colleges and universities often use it in their admissions process. However, affirmative action does seem to lower standards for certain under-represented minorities like Blacks and Hispanics. Should we think of affirmative action as patronizing those minorities, or rectifying the injustices they face? Is affirmative action enough to redress racial injustice, or is it simply the best we can do for the time being? John and Ken welcome Glenn Loury from Brown University, author of The Anatomy of Racial Inequality.\n\nKnowing What We Know - And What We Don't 428 2017-03-19\n\nKnowing What We Know - And What We Don't\n\nScope and Contents\n\nIt seems like we know many facts about ourselves and the world around us, even if there vastly many others we know that we don't know. But how do we know if what we believe to be true is really knowledge? Can our beliefs be both justified and true, yet still not count as genuine knowledge? If so, then how much confidence should we really have in our beliefs? Is there a way to strike a balance between paralyzing skepticism, on the one hand, and dogmatic conviction, on the other? John and Ken know that their guest is Baron Reed from Northwestern University, author of \"The Long Road to Skepticism.\"\n\nHarry Frankfurt, If truth is so valuable, why is there so much BS
