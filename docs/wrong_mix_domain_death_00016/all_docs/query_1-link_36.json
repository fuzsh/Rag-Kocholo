        "text": "O.J. Simpson and President Ford, Washington, D.C., 1976\n\n16''x20'' fiber print, 1 of 3 prints (one in the Ford Lirary)\n\n\"Thousands of people pass through the White House every year, and some of them are lucky enough to meet the President. If you're a celebrity the chances are good that you will. O.J. Simpson was one of those lucky ones, and brought his family along to meet a plaid-clad President Ford in the Cabinet Room in the summer of 1976, (with wife Marguerite, daughter Arnelle, and son Jason, who appears underwhelmed by the experience). This photo apparently was a prized O.J. possession, and was at the center of a Las Vegas heist in which he tried to recover his own memorabilia at the point of a gun. If O.J. Simpson had just called me instead of jacking his own memorabilia he might not be in the slammer today. I would have given him a copy of the photo, and surrendered it without a fight!\"\n\nRichard Nixon with Yo-Yo, Grand Ole Oprey, Nashville, Tennessee, 1974\n\n22.5''x30'' fiber print, edition of 5\n\n20''x24'' fiber print, edition of 50\n\n16''x20'' fiber print, edition of 50\n\n\"President Richard Nixon stunned the crowd at the opening of the new Grand Ole Opry in Nashville with a playful attempt to show, 'The King of Country Music,' Roy Acuff his mastery of a yo-yo. It was definitely political spin of a different variety.\"\n\nNixon plays the Grand Ole Opry, Nashville, TN, 1974\n\n50''x35'' archival giclee, edition of 5\n\n24''x20'' archival giclee, edition of 50\n\n20''x16'' archival giclee, edition of 50\n\n\"President Richard Nixon is not exactly remembered as a fun-loving guy, but you would never have known that if you'd attended the opening of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville on March 6, 1974. He sat down at a piano and rapped out, 'Happy Birthday,' for his wife First Lady Pat Nixon, who turned 62 that day. Another tune was playing in the distance that night, and less than five months later Nixon was drummed out of the White House over the Watergate scandal, leaving office on August 9, 1974.\"\n\nFirst Lady Betty Ford, Washington, DC, 1977\n\n24''x20'' fiber print, eidition of 15\n\n\"\"I always wanted to dance on the Cabinet Room table,\" shows the First Lady posing atop that table, January 9, 1977, the day before her husband President Ford left office. Mrs. Ford was a former Martha Graham dancer who also had an agile sense of humor, as exhibited here and demonstrated in the middle of a very male domain.\"\n\nJohn and Martha Mitchell, Washington, DC,1970\n\n34''x50'' archival giclee, edition 1 of 5\n\n20''x24'' archival giclee, edition of 2500\n\n16''x20'' archival giclee, edition of 1000\n\n\"This was John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s favorite political picture, and he ran it in the inaugural issue of his magazine, 'George'. He also used it as the cover of the invitation to the party announcing the publication of the magazine. Martha Mitchell, who was married to Attorney General John Mitchell, was called, 'the Mouth of the South', after she began contacting reporters when her husband's role in the Watergate scandal became known. Richard Nixon told David Frost during their interviews, 'If it hadn't been for Martha Mitchell, there would have been no Watergate.' This moment, I believe, accurately captured the personalities of both Mrs. Mitchell and her husband.\"\n\nAli-Frazier Fight, Madison Square Garden, New York, 1971\n\n40''x60'' archival giclee, edition of 5\n\n\"Historic heavyweight battle between Joe Frazier and Muhammed Ali, both undefeated champions at Madison Square Garden, March 8, 1971. Frazier won a decision after knocking Ali down in the 15th round. My photo is the only one of Ali heading for the canvas after being struck by Frazier, and was featured on the front page of the New York Times the following day, which was also my 24th birthday.\"\n\nGov. Ronald Reagan and Family, 1967\n\n24''x20'' fiber print, edition 1 of 1\n\n\"Governor and Mrs. Ronald Regan at their Pacific Palisades home, Christmas Day with two of their children Ron, Jr. and Patty Davis, December 25, 1967.\"\n\nPresident Ford and Governor Reagan at the Century Plaza Hotel, Los Angeles, 1974\n\n20''x24'' fiber print, edition of 10\n\n16''x20'' fiber print, edition of 10\n\n\"No, it's not a scene from The Godfather, but a meeting between California Governor Ronald Regan and President Gerald Ford in a suite at the Century Plaza Hotel before a black tie Republican fundraiser, October 31, 1974. Regan staged a losing challenge against Ford for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976.\"\n\nPresident Ford, Secretary of State Kissinger and Chief of Staff Rumsfeld with Geishas, 1974\n\n38''x14'' fiber print, edition 1 of 5\n\n\"Three 11''x14'' fiber prints that hung in the back room of Nathan's Restaurant in Washington, DC at the kind of State Dinner that Bill Clinton would have killed to attend! Gerald R. Ford was the first US President to visit Japan, and was certainly the first and last to rub noses with a Geisha. Kyoto, Japan, November 21, 1974.\"\n\nDick Cheney in bumper car, Dallas, 1976\n\n20''x24'' fiber print, edition 1 of 3\n\n\"White House Chief of Staff Dick Cheney at the Texas State Fair, Dallas, Texas taken on October 9, 1976 during the presidential campaign. Cheney went on to be a Congressman, Secretary of Defense, and Vice President of the United States.\"\n\nFidel Castro, Havana, 1977\n\n24''x20'' fiber print, unique print but negative exists\n\n\"President Fidel Castro is one of the most fascinating people I have photographed. I met him several times and found him to be one of the most engaging leaders out of the dozens I have photographed. Havana, Cuba on October 31, 1974.\"\n\nLeonind Brezhnev, Helsinki, 1975\n\n24''x20'' fiber print, edition of 5\n\n20''x16'' fiber print, edition of 5\n\n\"Soviet Leader Leonid Brezhnev takes a smoke break outside the final day of the Helsinki Summit, August 1, 1975. One of the advantages of my position as the official White House photographer at that time was my ability to get close to world leaders who were otherwise inaccessible to outsiders, particularly from Communist countries.\"\n\nFive Presidents, Reagan Library Dedication 1991\n\n20''x24'' fiber print, edition of 50\n\n16''x20'' fiber print, edition of 50\n\n\"Presiden George Bush, former Presidents Reagan, Carter, Ford and Nixon (L-R) at the dedication of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Simi Valley, California, November 4, 1991. This was the first time that five presidents had been together in one place and has since happened four other times, and I was there for each occasion.\"\n\nFive Presidents, the Oval Office, 2009\n\n20''x24'' fiber print, artist's proof edition 4 of 10, full edition of 44\n\n16''x20'' fiber print, edition of 44\n\n\"Former President George Bush, President-elect Barack Obama, President George W. Bush, and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter in the Oval Office at the White House, January 7, 2009. This is only the fifth time five presidents have been together and I have been there on each occasion. This is the second time there was a posed photo, as three of the other times were memorial services.\"\n\nThe Good Ole Red, White & Blue, Beijing,1999\n\n60''x40'' chromogenic print, edition of 15\n\n\"The 50th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China, Beijing. Three photos of Chinese soldiers marching in Tienanmen Square, October 1, 1999. These photos with a decidedly tongue-in-cheek title represent a major power in the world, and it is clear from the soldier's determination that they definitely believe that also.\"\n\nPortrait of a First Lady Wincing, Washington, DC, 1998\n\n16''x20'' fiber print, signed, edition of 1\n\n\"First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton reacts to a comment made by the Secretary of Education who said he beat President Clinton at a card game on Air Force One, taken in The Roosevelt Room, The White House, 1998. I wasn't sure how the First Lady (at the time) would react to the photo, but I sent it to her anyway hoping for a signature on the print. She sent it back and written on the photo signed by her she said, 'Dear David, I just wanted you to know I was thinking about you.'\"\n\nThe Obamas, Inaugural Night, Washington, DC, 2009\n\n18''x12'' chromogenic print, edition 3 of 44\n\n\"The Predisent and Mrs. Barack Obama share a moment in a freight elevator at the Washington Convention Center as they head to one of ten Inaugural Balls, Washington, DC, January 9, 2009. I didn't cover the campaign, so didn't really know the Obamas, but this moment said a lot to me about their relationship, which seemed genuinely warm and affectionate.\"\n\nJohn Edwards Has a Plan, 2004\n\n11''x14'' fiber print, edition of 1\n\n\"Senator John Edwards campaigns for president, 2004. Edwards admitted to an extramarital affair while he was running for president.\"\n\nGeorge Harrison in the President's Chair 1975\n\n16''x20'' fiber print, edition 1 of 2 with other in Ford Museum\n\n\"Seated (L-R), Tom Scott, Billy Preston, George Harrisson, Ravi Shankar, presidential son Jack Ford, and standing Harold Harrison. George's father, in the Cabinet Room of the White House, December 12, 1974. This picture is the only print from the original negative of this unusual gathering.\"\n\nThe Supremes, Portland, 1966\n\n16''x20'' fiber print, edition of 1, negative exists\n\n\"I was 19 when I took this photo of Diana Ross, Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard, backstage at the Portland Colisium, Portland, Oregon, 1966.\"\n\nPresident Bill Clinton in the Oval Office, Washington, DC, 1996\n\n20''x24'' fiber print, edition of 1, negative exists\n\n\"President Clinton's reaction as he met with families of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103 in the Oval Office in 1996. Flight 103 was blown up by a terrorist bomb over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988.\"\n\nEaster in Vietnam, 1971\n\n20''x24'' fiber print, edition of 50\n\n\"One of the things I discovered in covering several wars is that sometimes the best photos are on the edges of the action, rather than in it. This photograph, taken on Easter in Vietnam is a good example. When I saw the cross dangling from the soldier's neck near Khe Sanh, I knew I had a good photo. The photograph was taken in 1971 and is part of my 1972 Pulitzer portfolio.\"\n\nThe Road to Quang Tri, 1971\n\n20''x24'' fiber print, edition of 1\n\n\"A cross marks the grave of a South Vietnamese soldier on the road to Quang Tri near the DMZ with North Vietnam, 1971. Symbols are everywhere and this one was an all too familiar sight. War is about death, crosses about religion, and many times the twain do meet.\"\n\nSadat at the Pyramids, 1977\n\n16''x20'' fiber print, edition of 1, negative exists\n\n\"Eqyptian President Sadat at the Pyramids of Giza posing for a TIME 'Man of the Year' photograph, Cairo, 1977. Sadat was one of the most dramatic and magnificent leaders that I have photographed. He granted me remarkable access during my assignments for TIME Magazine. The world lost a great man when he was assasinated.\"\n\nVINTAGE PRINTS\n\nLone Soldier, Vietnam, 1971\n\n19''x15'' fiber print, edition of 1\n\n\"1972 of a lone soldier traversing a blown-away hillside in Vietnam near the A Shau Valley. This photo was cited by the Pulitzer committe as an example of my portfolio of 14 photos submitted by UPI editors for the award, 'That shows the loneliness and desolation of war.' My 1972 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography was for a portfolio of work from 1971 that included photos from Vietnam, Cambodia, India, and the Ali-Frazier fight at Madison Square Garden. The only complete set of the photos resides in the Pulitzer archives at Columbia University.\"\n\nMiles Davis, Portland, 1966\n\n10''x8'' fiber print, edition of 1\n\n\"Taken backstage at the Egyptian Theatre in Portald, Oregon of the great trumpet player. I was a 19-year-old staff photographer for the Oregon Journal, and when I was given the assignment to photograph him, I figured he would be cooperative, as most people I had photographed in my budding career were. He wasn't. After telling me to 'F*** off,' I was so shocked that I persisted, telling him I couldn't go back without a shot. He reluctantly agreed, but said, 'one picture, kid, and then get out of here.' I thought, well, now we're getting somewhere, figuring this would lead to more photos. I took the first frame under a light bulb, and got ready to take another. At that point he waved his horn at me, said, 'you got your f***ing shot, now get out.' THis is that (one) photograph.\"\n\nMichael Jackson set of three \"Remember the Time,\" 1992\n\n11''x42'' fiber print, edition of 1\n\n\"Michael Jackson during the filming of the John Singleton-directed music video, 'Remember the Time.' The entertainer died at 50 years old, June 25, 2009. These are the original prints of a shoot I did with MJ that were shot during the film, the original negatives are in his estate, and will probably never be seen again.\"\n\nDiana Ross, The Supremes, Portland, 1966\n\n9.5''x10.5'' fiber print, signed, edition of 1\n\n\"Signed by me on the lower right of the print and signed by the subjects on the print, 'To Dave, Diana Ross, Supremes, Mary (Wilson), Florence (Ballard).' The following year in 1967, Ms. Ballad was replaced by Cindy Birdsong.

Ansel and I became close friends after I set up a meeting with him and President Ford in 1974.

The Cover That Missed inscribed with, 'For David Hume Kennerly, The cover that Missed! Ansel Adams, NY-9-5-79' . The photograph underscores Ansel's playfulness and fine sense of humor.

Ms. Suzann, acting very much like one of her fictional characters, invited me up to her place after the shoot for a cocktail and maybe more.

This is one of the few prints Ansel ever made for someone else, and the first time, and maybe the last that he actually signed a print of a picture he didn't take. Ansel and I were friends, and he made the prints as a favor for me. One copy is in his archive, another in President Ford's library, and the other two with private individuals.\"\n\nTwelve Angry Men, Remake, 1997\n\n16''x20'' fiber print, unique print\n\n\"Signed by me and the cast: Jack Lemmon, Hume Cronyn, Edward James Olmos, William Peterson, Courtney B.

Simpson had called me instead of heisting his own memorabilia in Las Vegas, he might not be in jail today. One of the items he snatched during the botched robbery was a photo I took of him and his family with President Ford in the White House in 1976, a picture that he said he wanted back for his kids. I would have given him a copy, and happily surrendered it without a fight!\" - David Hume Kennerly\n\nCurriculum Vitae\n\nSELECTED EXHIBITIONS\n\n2010 If Only O.J.
