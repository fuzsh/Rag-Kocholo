        "text": "Thursday, June 19, 1986\n\nSequoia and Kings Canyon - Lost Hikers Found\n\nSEKI reported two overdue hikers were the subject of a major air and ground search. The two started at Bishop CA in a party of four and after several days in the backcountry became separated. Due to heavy snow pack, and lack of a map of the area, they evidently chose the incorrect direction. They were last seen Wednesday 6/18. SEKI began a search on 6/21 after the other party reported the incident. Hikers reported found in fair condition afternoon 6/22.\n\nJune 15, 1987\n\n87-104 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon - Drowning\n\nLocation: Kaweah River\n\nJ.S. and 5 others were swimming in middle fork of the river near park headquarters. J.S. apparently was sucked down a water chute and trapped beneath the surface of the water. Paramedics arrived on the scene and performed CPR for two hours. They were unable to revive him.\n\nJuly 1, 1987\n\n87-133 - Sequoia/Kings - Arson - Wildland Fire\n\nLocation: Ash Mountain, Headquarters & Employee Residence Area\n\nOn 6/26, at approximately 10:40PM an off-duty fire aid noticed a fire to be burning in the area of park headquarters and the employee residence area. The fire spread quickly and eventually encompassed 160 acres. Firefighters totaling 175 were dispatched from various agencies to fight the blaze during the night. Equipment consisted of 4 pumpers and 2 helicopters. The fire threatened homes as well as park headquarters building. Nearby Potwisha CG was closed and utilized as a fire camp. The fire was contained by 6:00am on 6/27, and controlled at 7:00pm that evening. It has not yet been declared \"out\". A CDF employee found a homemade device (which is believed to have started the fire) approximately 1/4 mile from the housing area along the general highway. There are no suspects. Ho structures were damaged and no injuries occurred. NO estimate of damage has been determined. Potwisha CG has been reopened.\n\nAugust 6, 1987\n\n87-185 - Sequoia - Fatality - Missing Person Discovered\n\nLocation: Elizabeth Pass\n\nA body, identified to be that of R.S., was discovered on August 3, 1987, in an unnamed lake near Elizabeth Pass. R.S. was reported missing after leaving to go cross country skiing in the park in February earlier this year. Next of kin notified.\n\nJanuary 26, 1988\n\n88-14 - Sequoia-Kings Canyon - Rape Conviction\n\nLocation: Outside of park\n\nIn November of 1986, a ranger from another park was sexually assaulted while on a bike trip through Sequoia. She had been bicycling near park headquarters when she was overtaken by a pickup truck with two men in it. They forced her off the road, then assaulted her. The ranger was able to report the incident to the park dispatcher shortly after it happened, and the two men were arrested within twenty minutes by Tulare sheriff's deputies. The two - brothers C. and M.S. - were found guilty of rape, and have been sentenced to life imprisonment by US District Court Robert Coyle, who declared from the bench that the sentence would send a message that violent crimes in our national parks will be severely punished. The defendants plan an appeal based on the judge's decision to deny their pre-trial motion to suppress evidence.\n\nMarch 16, 1988\n\n88-37 - Sequoia-Kings Canyon - Narcotics Arrests\n\nLocation: Not given\n\nFour employees of the park concessioner, Guest Services, were arrested on March 4th for possession and distribution of illicit drugs. Small quantities of LSD, marijuana and cocaine were also seized. The arrests stemmed from a lengthy undercover operation in which the Tulare County Sheriff's Office provided the undercover operator.\n\nApril 7, 1988\n\n88-51 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon - Successful Search for Missing Skiers\n\nLocation: Parkwide\n\nA. and D.S. and M.P. left the Wolverton ski hut area of the park on March 28th with the intention of skiing the \"High Route\" to Symmes Creek. They planned on arriving on the 2nd; when they failed to appear by the 4th, the park began a search for them. An air search was conducted on Monday without success. On Tuesday, tracks were located in the Nine Lakes Basin area which appeared to go south toward the Chagoopa Plateau. Two teams of trackers were put into the field to follow these tracks. A search dog was brought in, and air searches employing two helicopters and a USFS/L.A. County aircraft with infra-red capabilities were continued throughout the area. The skiers were spotted by one of the helicopters at 11 a.m. yesterday morning about 16 miles from their intended route. All were in good condition. It is not yet known whether they were lost or just decided to take a different route. A total of 20 people were employed on the search.\n\nJuly 18, 1988\n\n88-144 - Sequoia - Search\n\nLocation: Mineral King\n\nThe body of J.N., 35, of Malibu, California was discovered on the 16th after an extensive search in the Mineral King area of the park. J.N., a summer caretaker in Silver City, a private community within the park, was last seen on the 12th when he left his residence to go hiking. His wife reported him missing nearly 48 hours later on the 14th. Park officials initiated search efforts on Thursday, the 14th. As of the 15th the park was using 19 ground searchers and one dog in the search. J.N. apparently died of injuries sustained during a fall.\n\nAugust 2, 1988\n\n88-164 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon - Aircraft Accident\n\nLocation: Vidette Meadows\n\nAt 11:30 am on July 30th, a single engine Cessna airplane crashed at 10,300 feet in Vidette Meadows, 200 feet from the John Muir Trail. The plane, piloted by C.D., 25 of Hayward, California, reportedly did not experience any engine problems but apparently lacked the power needed to clear the Sierra Nevada. Three of the four persons on board, including the pilot died in the crash. The survivor is currently hospitalized in Valley Medical in Fresno and is expected to live. A ranger was on the scene within 30 minutes and the victims were evacuated by helicopter shortly after.\n\nSeptember 20, 1988\n\n88-229 - Sequoia-Kings Canyon - Search\n\nLocation: Sawtooth Pass and Columbine Lake\n\nA search is being conducted for W.K., 20, of Los Angeles, California in the Mineral King area of Sequoia-Kings Canyon. W.K. was reported missing on the 19th after failing to return home on the 16th from a week long solo hike in the area. An aerial search conducted on the 19th produced no trace of W.K.. A more extensive search involving 2 helicopters, 3 dog teams and 22 personnel was started on the 20th and is focusing on the Sawtooth Pass and Columbine Lake areas.\n\nW.K. is a former National High School Senior of the Year and was presented that award by President Reagan.\n\nUpdate - 9/23\n\nThe body of W.K. was discovered mid-day on the 22nd by search teams in the vicinity of Sawtooth Peak. W.K. appears to have died as the result of a fall.\n\nAt the height of the search there were 7 dog teams, 4 helicopters, 3 infrared units and 65 people involved in search efforts. Assistance was provided by the U.S. Forest Service, California Mountain Rescue Association, WOOF (Wilderness Finders - dog teams), California Rescue Dog Association and the U.S. Navy.\n\nFriday, February 17, 1989\n\n89-23 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon - Structural Fire\n\nA fire broke out in the park's SAR cache at 2:30 a.m. on the 16th and totally destroyed the facility and its contents. Total damage has been estimated at $20,000 for the SAR equipment and $10,000 for other equipment and the structure itself. The source of ignition appears to have been an electrical failure in a water heater in the building. One park ranger was hospitalized for a minor case of smoke inhalation. (Herb Gercke, WRO).\n\nTuesday, April 4, 1989\n\n89-61 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon - Rape Conviction\n\nOn July 30, 1988, a female visitor from the Netherlands reported to park dispatch that she had been raped near Potwisha Campground in Sequoia. Rangers began an investigation and eventually arrested 32-year-old R.R.E., an illegal alien from Mexico. R.R.E. was subsequently indicted for aggravated sexual abuse and pleaded guilty. On March 27th, he was sentenced to nine years imprisonment. At the conclusion of his term in prison, he is to be deported. (Pete Allen, LEO, SEKI).\n\nWednesday, June 21, 1989\n\n89-142 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon - Search\n\nWhile hiking to Moose Lake on the morning of Sunday, June 18th, actress J.F. became separated from her party. When she did not show up either at Moose Lake or at the group's base camp at Pear Lake that night, a companion hiked out and reported her as a lost person to park rangers around midnight. A helicopter flew a search over the Pear Lake and Moose Lake area on Monday morning and found J.F. unhurt. She apparently took a wrong turn while hiking and lost her way. She wrapped up in an insulated blanket and waited for help to arrive. J.F. was reunited with her friends at their base camp, and the group hiked out together. (Doug Morris, CR, SEKI, via CompuServe message from RAD/WRO).\n\nFriday, June 23, 1989\n\n89-151 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon - Rescue\n\nOn the afternoon of the 21st, 18-year-old K.G. slipped on a wet rock in the South Fork of the Kings River and was swept down the river and over Mist Falls, a 150-foot-high sequence of cascading falls. She landed in a deep pool and was carried to the shore by the current. K.G. suffered a possible fractured ankle, neck and back injuries, lacerations and broken teeth. About a dozen members of the park staff were involved in her rescue. K.G. was air-lifted from the scene, then transported by ambulance to the Valley Medical Center in Fresno. The falls are particularly hazardous - over the past 15 years, six people have lost their lives there and another three people have survived going over the falls. (Doug Morris, CR, SEKI, via CompuServe message to RAD/WRO and RAD/WASO).\n\nTuesday, August 29, 1989\n\n89-249 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Drowning\n\nOn August 27th, 14-year-old M.M. of Ivanhoe, California, was swimming with a group of friends and relatives in the Kaweah River near park headquarters. M.M. and one other member of the party went looking for other areas in which to swim; after finding a spot to their liking, they started to swim back down the river to get the rest of their party. M.M. swam into some rapids and became caught on the upper side of a rock. His companion tried to free him, but was unsuccessful and went to get help. When he returned with other party members, M.M. was floating face down in a pool. They brought him to shore, attempted CPR, and sent for rangers. Park medics and local ambulance personnel responded, but they were unable to revive M.M.. (Mike Warren, SEKI, via CompuServe message to RAD/WRO and RAD/WASO).\n\nWednesday, October 18, 1989\n\n89-321 - California Parks - Earthquake\n\nAttempts were made last night to directly contact parks in central California to determine any possible damage or injuries incurred during yesterday's earthquake. Efforts to get through to most parks proved fruitless due to the high volume of calls on trans-continental phone lines. Sequoia/Kings and Lassen reported that the tremors had not reached them. A call to Regional Director Albright revealed that there were no reported injuries to employees in other parks and that parks outside the San Francisco area were generally unaffected by the quake. Concerns are currently focused on Pinnacles, south of San Francisco, and parks in the city itself.\n\nAt 4 a.m. PDT this morning, Capt. Clayton Connor of WRO's Ranger Activities called this office from a Park Police (USPP) field office and advised that, as far as the Park Police knew, there were no injuries to visitors or employees at Golden Gate. Damage assessments will be begun at first light. The fire in the city's Marina District, which was seen on many television stations last night, occurred close by the park's Fort Mason - Aquatic Park area, but it is as yet unclear as to what impact the fire has had on park grounds or facilities. At present, most damage appears to have occurred to the south and east of San Francisco; there have been no reports of any significant damage north of the city. The Park Police will probably be seeking extra personnel to assist them, as they will be responsible for the park and for providing support to the city. The regional office will be closed today. (Reports via telephone to and from RAD/WASO and Operations, WASO).\n\nThursday, October 19, 1989\n\n89-321 - California Parks - Follow-up on Earthquake\n\nThe following is the text of the briefing prepared for the Secretary this morning. It is based on current reports from Phil Ward and Capt. Clayton Connor in RAD/WRO and Doug Erskine in BFM/Boise:\n\nOverview\n\nShortly after the earthquake struck California on the night of October 17th, the Washington Office began efforts to determine the impact the quake had on parks in central California and to ascertain what equipment, services or funding would be needed there. Although reports are still incomplete due to difficulties in communicating with both parks and the regional office, which is located in downtown San Francisco, it has been determined that no National Park Service employees or visitors were killed or injured by the quake and no major damage occurred in the parks.\n\nTuesday, January 16, 1990\n\n90-9 - Sequoia - Kings Canyon (California) - Search for Missing Aircraft\n\nAt about 6 p.m. on the 13th, a Cessna 172 disappeared from radar and lost radio contact with the FAA while flying over Sequoia. The plane was last reported to have been south and west of Mt. Whitney and flying in very poor weather. Continued low visibility and snow storms have hampered search efforts by the NPS and the Civil Air Patrol. The search is now being conducted by numerous fixed wing aircraft and helicopters from the Army National Guard, Lemoore Naval Air Station and contractors. At the time of the report, the storm had deposited up to four feet of snow on the search area. It is believed that only the pilot is on board the Cessna. (CompuServe message from Paul Fodor, DR, SEKI, noon EST, 1/15/90).\n\nWednesday, January 17, 1990\n\n90-9 - Sequoia - Kings Canyon (California) - Follow-up on Search\n\nThe search for the missing Cessna 172 continued throughout Monday, but no sign of the plane was found. Although flying weather was good in the morning, it deteriorated on the west side of the divide as clouds arrived in mid-afternoon. The forecast for yesterday called for two to four inches of snow at elevations as low as 2,500', with increasing amounts at higher elevations. The search was accordingly suspended pending better weather. No ground search has yet been initiated because of weather conditions and the lack of a good location for the aircraft. The pilot's name has not yet been released. (CompuServe message from Paul Fodor, DR, SEKI, noon EST, 1/16/90).\n\nWednesday, January 24, 1990\n\n90-9 - Sequoia-Kings Canyon (California) - Follow-up on Search\n\nThe search for the missing Cessna 172 which disappeared from radar over the park on the 13th continued throughout the past weekend with contract and Lemoore Naval Air Station helicopters and Civil Air Patrol aircraft. A grid search of probable crash sites is in the process of being completed. Occasional, extremely weak ELT signals are being detected, but no fixes have yet been made on them. (Doug Morris, CR, SEKI, via CompuServe report from Herb Gercke, RADAJRO, 10:30 a.m. EST, 1/23/90).\n\nFriday, April 13, 1990\n\n90-66 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Employee Death\n\nOn the afternoon of the 10th, forestry worker T.J., 50, was pruning a dwarf mistletoe infection from a sugar pine in Cedar Grove in Kings Canyon when he fell 150 feet to the ground. T.J. received immediate attention from several EMT-qualified employees. He remained conscious for about 30 minutes before succumbing, apparently to internal injuries and shock. He was medevaced to the Valley Medical Center in Fresno, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. T.J. was a Native American from Yosemite who began work with the NPS in that park in March of 1963. He had been climbing for most of his life and was considered to be a very experienced forestry crew member. It is unclear at this point what caused the fall. Park rangers and OSHA investigators will be investigating the incident. The park conducted a critical incident stress debriefing for employees yesterday morning. (Telephone reports from Chris Cameron, RAD/WRO, 4/12/90).\n\nFriday, June 1, 1990\n\n90-116 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Rescue\n\nOn Friday, May 25th, S.O., 18, and P.P., 21, both of Los Angeles, parked their car near Hospital Rock picnic area on the Generals Highway and forded the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River to camp illegally on the opposite side. Two and a quarter inches of rain fell in the area on the 27th and 28th, and the Kaweah rose from one to two feet, trapping the pair across the river. They tried to cross on the morning of the 28th, but were unable to do so because of the high water. They also attempted to hike out cross country, but gave up after encountering steep, rocky terrain and dense brush. Visitors heard cries for help later that afternoon and reported this to rangers. Rangers investigated and found S.O. and P.P. hiding beneath a rock overhang and suffering from mild hypothermia. \"Angel 1\", a rescue helicopter from Lemoore NAS, was summoned, and the two victims were hoisted cut and transported to park headquarters, where they were treated for hypothermia and released. Along with the two inches of rain, the park received up to two feet of new snow in the backcountry. The park anticipates the possibility of more requests for assistance in locating missing or stranded hikers who were not prepared for the storm. (SEKJ dispatch, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 4 p.m. EDT, 5/31).\n\nTuesday, July 10, 1990\n\n90-187 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Helicopter Incident\n\nThe park's contract helicopter was taking off from a small meadow near the Tindell Creek Ranger Station on a medevac flight on the 6th when the pilot began feeling vibrations and started to lose control of the helicopter's tail rotor. The pilot immediately put the ship back on the ground without further incident. The medevac was completed by the Peppermint helitack crew and ship from Sequoia NF. The incident, which was caused by the tail rotor striking a small tree, is currently under investigation by the Office of Aircraft Services. (Doug Morris, CR, SEKI, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 7/9).\n\nTuesday, July 10, 1990\n\n90-188 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Search and Rescue\n\nOn the afternoon of July 5th, P.H., 45, of Simi Valley, California, was dropped off at Whitney Portal on the east side of Sequoia for what he intended would be a transSierra run which would end at the Crescent Meadow parking lot around noon on the 6th. Hartman was dressed in a couple of t-shirts, a wind breaker and running shoes and was carrying a fanny pack. When he failed to meet his wife as scheduled, she notified rangers, who made an initial air search of Hartman's planned route. No sign of him was found. On the 7th, an organized search was begun which employed park personnel and helicopters from Lemoore NAS, the California Highway Patrol and the park's contractor. The search proved fruitless, but rangers were able to establish a \"point last seen.\" On the 8th, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's helicopter with an infrared unit conducted an early morning search, then five WOOF dog teams and 15 ground searchers began working in the search area. Two other helicopters joined the effort. Just before 4 p.m., a tired, footsore, sunburned, dehydrated and confused P.H. was found in reasonably good condition by one of the helicopters. (Mike Warren, SEKI, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 7/9).\n\nThursday, July 19, 1990\n\n90-197 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Lightning Fatality\n\nAt about 3 p.m. on the afternoon of July 14th, 13 hikers on the summit of 14,495-foot Mt. Whitney felt a buzzing sensation in their feet and noticed their hair standing on end. They entered the historic Smithsonian shelter and heard nearby lightning activity. About a quarter hour later, the group heard several loud booms, the cement and rock floor and walls of the shelter started buzzing, there was a flash, and a white and yellow, one-foot diameter ball of lighting started bouncing off all four walls. The entire group was numb for about five seconds; one member received third degree burns on both shoulders, one member went into cardiac and respiratory arrest, and the others received minor burns. Members of the group performed CPR on 26-year-old M.N. of Huntington Beach, California, for six hours but were unsuccessful. He was evacuated by a Forest Service helicopter to the Southern Inyo Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 9 p.m. In a separate incident one half mile below the summit, another party of two was struck by lightning twice. One hiker went into respiratory arrest for 15 minutes, but was revived by his brother. The pair then walked about six miles and descended 2,000 vertical feet before being evacuated. The injured member was later diagnosed as having a fractured spine. (Doug Morris, CR, SEKI, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 7/16).\n\nTuesday, July 31, 1990\n\n90-9 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Follow-up on Search for Aircraft\n\nOn January 13th, a Cessna 172 piloted by J.T. of Loma Linda, California, disappeared from radar while flying near Mt. Whitney. A search was initiated, but was suspended after 13 days when no sign of the aircraft was found. On July 28th, the plane and remains of the pilot were found at the 11,300-foot elevation one mile southwest of Colby Pass. J.T. was apparently killed on impact. (Chief Rangers' Office, SEKI, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 7/30).\n\nWednesday, August 1, 1990\n\n90-213 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Drowning\n\nOn the afternoon of July 24th, a 24-year-old Mexican national was swimming with his family and friends in the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River near Buckeye campground. He dove into a deep pool from a height of four feet above the water. As he was swimming across the 50 feet of water to the opposite shore, his family lost sight of him. When they next saw him, he was at the bottom of the river approximately eight feet below the surface. After he'd been submerged for several minutes, companions and other visitors brought him to shore and began CPR. When rangers arrived on scene, they continued CPR and initiated advanced life support measures. These were continued for an hour without results. The victim, whose name is being withheld until notification of his parents, was pronounced dead at the scene. (CR, SEKI, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 7/24).\n\nWednesday, August 29, 1990\n\n90-285 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Rescues\n\nOn the night of the 21st, a backcountry ranger in Kings Canyon heard someone yelling for help from the side of 14,242-foot North Palisade Mountain. A search employing park staff and the park's contract helicopter was begun at dawn. Lemoore Naval Air Station and the California National Guard each provided high-altitude, long-lift helicopters to assist in the search. Searchers soon found 22-year-old M.V. of Stockton, California, stranded at the mountain's 14,000 foot level in an area accessible only through technical climbing. Contact with M.V. was established through a portable radio lowered to him. He indicated that he'd been hit by a loose rock which had rolled over both legs and severely lacerated one of them. Due to the elevation and terrain, a corpsmen rappelled 200 feet from the Lemoore helicopter to M.V., then hoisted him to the ship. He was flown to a hospital in Bishop, California, where he is being treated for contusions, exposure and dehydration. While this rescue was underway, a ranger in the southern part of Sequoia noticed smoke coming from the Rock Creek drainage. Upon investigation, she found two people stranded on a high ledge above Rock Creek. They'd started a fire to attract attention. A corpsmen from the same Lemoore helicopter rappelled 75 feet to the pair and hoisted them out. They were brought to the Ash Mountain helibase, where one of the pair, P.M., was transported to a local hospital for treatment of a broken arm, fractured collar bone and lacerations. (Mike Warren, SEKI, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 8/27).\n\nTuesday, October 2, 1990\n\n90-348 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Fatality\n\nOn the afternoon of September 29th, a resident of Wilsonia Village, an inholding within the park near Grant Grove, discovered the body of a male in his early 30's located face down in a small creek. An investigation into his identity and the probable cause of his death is being conducted by rangers and FBI agents with the assistance of the Tulare County sheriff's crime scene unit. (Doug Morris, CR, SEKI, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 10/1).\n\nTuesday, October 2, 1990\n\n90-350 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Structural Fire\n\nOn September 30th, rangers at Grant Grove responded to a structural fire in a small cabin in Wilsonia Village, an inholding area in the park. When they arrived, the cabin was fully engulfed in flames and was threatening several other structures. Additional help was requested from Tulare County and from the California Division of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF). CDF units were released from a wildfire just outside of the park and were on-scene in 30 minutes. The cabin was a total loss, but no other structures burned and there was no significant wildland fire. An occupant of the cabin received third-degree burns to his feet in an attempt to retrieve belongings and put the fire out. The cause is under investigation. (Doug Morris, CR, SEKE, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 10/1).\n\nWednesday, October 24, 1990\n\n90-381 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Rescue\n\nAt about 3 a.m. on the 21st, 22-year-old A.I. of Visalia, California, lost control of the vehicle she was driving on Generals Highway; it went off the road, rolled approximately 300 feet down an extremely steep hillside, and came to rest next to the Kaweah River. A.I., who apparently was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown from the vehicle, which caught fire and burned completely. She lay on the slope until found by some fisherman around 7 a.m. Rangers stabilized her and employed technical rescue techniques to lift her litter up to the road. A.I. was taken by hospital to Valley Medical Center in Fresno for surgery. She was found to be suffering from a fractured vertebra, torn aorta and a broken leg, and is reported to be in serious condition. (CRO, SFJCE, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 10/23).\n\nThursday, January 3, 1991\n\n90-463 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Structural Fire\n\nA fire originating in the maintenance office of the park's headquarters building was discovered at 8:00 p.m. on New Year's Eve. Quick work by the fire brigade isolated the fire and limited major damage to that room; smoke and heat damage, however, extended to other parts of the building. Losses are estimated at between $5,000 and $30,000 at this time. (Doug Morris, CR, SEKI, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 1/2).\n\nMonday, March 11, 1991\n\n91-68 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Weapons Charge Conviction\n\nOn September 22, 1990, ranger Jennifer Hartley observed R.V., Jr., entering the park on the first day of hunting season with a weapon in plain view. Hartley stopped R.V. and cited him. During this encounter, a California Fish and Game warden heard R.V.'s name on the radio, recalled that he was on probation and could not lawfully possess either a hunting license or weapon, drove to the scene, and cited R.V. under appropriate state charges. R.V. paid his federal fine but went to court on state charges. After a pre-trial conference, R.V. changed his original plea to guilty, forfeited his $850 hunting rifle, paid a $3,362 fine, and was sentenced to serve one year in jail and another three years on probation. Hartley's testimony was instrumental in this outcome. [Pete Allen, SEKI, via CompuServe message from Herb Gercke, RAD/WRO, 3/5]\n\nWednesday, May 1, 1991\n\n91-144 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Successful Rescue\n\nDuring a backcountry ski trip in the park last week, A.S., 34, of Corte Madera, California, began suffering from high altitude pulmonary edema. Her husband skied 20 miles in one day through very steep and icy terrain and 80 mph winds to report her illness to rangers. On Friday, a helicopter from Lemoore NAS braved 40 mph winds to successfully evacuate A.S. to a local hospital. A.S. was attempting a 35-mile, six-day-long traverse of the Sierra Nevadas along the High Route.

He had jumped from the bridge in an apparent suicide attempt and had suffered numerous injuries, including a broken leg. Due to the location, it was necessary to lift him vertically to the bridge before transporting him by helicopter to a medical center in Fresno.

A hose was pulled from a nearby hose box and employed on the fire until the fire brigade and engine could arrive. The cabin suffered extensive damage and will be torn down. Estimated losses are $10,000 to the cabin and $3,000 in personal property. The cause is still under investigation, but preliminary findings indicate that the fire originated from a wood stove.

Because of the possible threat to visitor safety, a section of the campground was closed and about 30 people were evacuated. Qualified blasters from the park and Denver Service Center subsequently determined that there were no explosives in the hole and that the wires were probably left over from blasting of the rock in a quarry outside the park. That portion of the campground was reopened about three hours later.

H.V., 24, of Tulare, California, jumped into the river in an effort to provide help. The person who called for assistance was able to get to shore, but H.V., who was wearing tennis shoes and jeans, sank from sight. Rangers were notified and were able to pull him from the river. They attempted to revive H.V., but were unsuccessful. H.V. was with friends and family members at the time of the incident.

A hook from a vehicle power winch was hooked on to the safe padlocks and pulled until something gave way. Two attempts were unsuccessful; on the third try, the weld on the pipe safe plate broke and the contents were removed. This is the second year that rangers at Sequoia/Kings have seen this MO employed, and are trying to develop leads from it.

F.V. landed on large rocks and lay partly on the rocks and in the water below the falls. His companions summoned help and kept his face above the water until rescuers arrived. Rangers and personnel from a local YMCA camp extricated F.V. and evacuated him by litter. He was then transported to medical facilities by a CHP helicopter. It is reported that F.V. suffered spinal injuries in the fall and that he stopped breathing while airborne. He is presently comatose and in critical condition. Alcohol was involved in the incident.

Responding rangers located R.D. at the base of a 70-foot vertical drop about 100 feet inside the entrance to the cave. Initial assessments indicated that some digging and alternation of cave features might have to be done to get him out; in order to avoid this, a local doctor was instead taken to the scene. R.D.'s shoulder was relocated and he was brought to the surface near midnight with the assistance of two vertical hoists. After regaining the surface, R.D. told his rescuers that he didn't feel that he needed further medical assistance and that he was going to remain overnight in the campground and drive himself to a doctor in the morning. Some 30 park personnel and two VIPs participated in the rescue.

A search was begun that morning and continued in to the following day. A helicopter, a dog team and 35 searchers were committed to the operation. Around 8:00 a.m. on August 1st, S.R. walked out on his own and the operation was suspended. No further information regarding the incident is available at this time.

L.S. is described as a highly competent outdoorsman who has made four or five such trips in the past. His route to Onion Valley is unknown, and no clues have been discovered so far. Two helicopters and approximately twelve persons are currently committed to the search. [Pete Allen, Acting CR, SEKI, via Carl Christensen, RAD/WRO, 8/22]\n\nTuesday, August 27, 1991\n\n91-430 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Followup on Search\n\nOn August 18th, the park began a search for L.S., 31, a Marine stationed in Tustin, California, when he failed to return from a twoweeklong hike in the park. Search efforts began with attempts to determine L.S.' route of travel and to contact other hikers who might have seen him. L.S. preferred to hike crosscountry and stay off trails and planned a 150-mile loop trip. Although he carried maps with his exact route with him, he'd only described the trip in general with his family. The search area was therefore several hundred thousand acres in size. Some 700 permits were subsequently reviewed and numerous hikers were contacted. Only two people said that they had seen L.S., and that he'd been near New Army Pass on August 5th. Park personnel, four WOOF dog teams and three helicopters one each from the park, Sequoia NF and Rogers Helicopters were utilized in the search. Members of the park's FIREPRO crew found L.S.' body on the 23rd in Rock Creek Gorge. The body was recovered by helicopter long line the following day after technical climbers reached his body. Preliminary investigation indicates that L.S. was attempting to climb down through Rock Creek into Kern Canyon. Rock Creek Gorge is extremely rocky, steep and narrow, and it appears that he may have fallen, injured himself, slipped into the creek, and gone over a 25foot water fall. The 24th was a busy day for rescuers in the park. In addition to the recovery of L.S.' body, there were four other helicopter medevacs involving the park's contract ship and a California Highway Patrol helicopter. The park has had 71 search and rescue operations or medical evacuations to date this year, 57 of which have utilized helicopters.

Rangers from Lodgepole confirmed the report and evacuated and secured the area until the following morning, when a bomb squad from Tulare County was flown to the scene by a California Highway Patrol helicopter. The device was identified as a 40mm, rifle-launched, high-explosive grenade, possibly armed and probably unstable. It was determined that the only safe way to handle the device was to detonate it in place. An investigation into the incident is underway.

Park and Forest Service investigators determined that S.M.W. and E.B., both of Modesto, had burglarized the Grant Grove Lodge, the Miwok ranger station in the Stanislaus, and campground pipe safes in both parks and both forests. S.M.W. and E.B. are currently in custody on state charges, and a complaint for the Grant Grove Lodge burglary has been filed. Indictments are being sought and charges against other involved persons may still be filed. The investigation is continuing.

She did so, but later felt uneasy about the incident since she and her husband would not be returning to their home until the next day. She called her son, who lived in the area, and asked him to stay at her house and watch it that evening. Shortly after midnight, power was cut to the house and three subjects attempted to break in. The woman's son called the police and scared off the intruders along with some friends before officers arrived at the scene. The two men who contacted the woman claimed to be construction workers in the park. They have been described as white males (possibly Hispanic) in their mid-30's who were dressed in blue flannel shirts and blue jeans. One was 5'6\" tall, clean shaven, and had wiry black hair and an angular face; the other was 6'0\" with a \"pasty-white\" round face, thick black hair and a thick black, bushy moustache. Any areas with similar incidents are requested to contact the park's law enforcement office.

Rangers checking an unattended vehicle in the Potwisha campground determined that S.P.W. was missing from his home and that he'd last been seen heading up the Marble Fork trail on the morning of November 12th. S.P.W. is known to abuse alcohol and cocaine, and has been described as depressed. S.P.W. was hospitalized from an overdose of drugs about three weeks ago, but denied that the overdose had occurred from suicidal intent. Search operations are being headed up by Dan Mason and at their peak involved a helicopter, three dog teams and over 60 personnel. No clues have yet been discovered. A storm on the 17th hampered search efforts. The search is continuing, but on a reduced scale.

Rangers found that the phrase \"FARMS XIV\" had been painted very close to an area of Indian pictographs. During an interview with the reporting party, rangers were able to develop a description of the suspect, who was described as a young man wearing what appeared to be \"gang colors\". He had last been seen in the area less than a half hour before rangers arrived at the location. At the same time, a maintenance worker found a similar painting on another rock outcropping several miles up the Generals Highway toward Lodgepole. Attempts to find the suspect were unsuccessful at that time. Later that evening, ranger Dave Ashe was patrolling in the Potwisha campground when he came upon an extremely disorderly campsite. During his contact with the individuals at the site, he noted that one of them fit the suspect's description. An investigation conducted that evening and the next day led to the arrest of one adult and two juvenile males who admitted to the vandalism. Due to the location of the vandalism, rangers are pursuing the possibility of filing ARPA charges with the U.S. attorney's office.

He also felt that one of the individuals in the vehicle that had tried to run him off the road may have pointed a weapon at him. The vehicle was described as a small white sedan with two male occupants; when last seen it was traveling towards Giant Forest. The vehicle was spotted by two different park employees, who were able to provide the car's license plate and location. Rangers Mark Gorman and Walter Kelly contacted the two men in the vehicle in the Deer Ridge area. The pair admitted to playing \"chicken\" with the truck; they'd done so because loggers were \"raping the land\". They said that they did not have a weapon and consented to a search of their car. Rangers found drug paraphernalia and dried mushrooms during the search. Computer checks revealed that neither the New Mexico license plates displayed on the vehicle nor the VIN number on the registration were on file; the operator's driver's license came back as suspended. The two men were placed under arrest. During the inventory search of the car, rangers found another New Mexico license plate (which also came back as not on file) and four pounds of what appear to be hallucinogenic mushrooms with an estimated street value of $2,500 to $3,000. The men were charged with possession of controlled substances with intent to sell. The investigation into the incident is continuing.

A ranger was dispatched to the likely address to investigate. Meanwhile, however, a maintenance employee called with a report of a fire in a cabin in Wilsonia, a private inholding near Grant Grove. By the time engines arrived on scene, the structure was fully involved. All that firefighters could do was protect surrounding buildings. The residence was totally destroyed, but there were no injuries. Tulare County and Forest Service units also provided assistance. The blaze apparently started when a stove blew up in the cabin. More details will be available after the investigation is completed.

The informant also described K.B. and his two accomplices and the vehicle which they would be using. A search warrant was subsequently obtained for the three people, K.B.'s vehicle, and one of their rooms. Rangers Gorman and James Ireland stopped the vehicle at about 9:00 p.m. that evening, executed the warrant, seized a quarter pound of marijuana, and arrested K.B. for possession of controlled substances and driving under the influence. Searches of the room and the other two suspects produced no useful evidence, but K.B. gave a voluntary statement in which he admitted purchasing the drugs with the intent to sell about half to his fellow concession employees.

An intense ground and air search was initiated, and selected search teams worked beyond midnight in rugged mountain terrain in attempt to locate him. Dog teams from the Orange County and Tulare County sheriff's offices and volunteer search dog teams from Tulare County were brought in the following morning to support the 40 ground and air search teams deployed in the search. The dog teams alerted to G.R.'s scent on the Twin Lakes Trail that morning, and he was found alive and well just after 2:00 p.m. [Pete Allen, LEO, SEKI, 6/29]\n\nThursday, July 16, 1992\n\n92-351 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Bear Poaching\n\nA five-year-old male black bear was illegally killed inside a park inholding in Grant Grove on July 5th. Residents in the Wilsonia area reported hearing a single gunshot early in the morning. An investigation revealed evidence which led rangers to the primary suspect, A.R.K. of Selma, California. On July 7th, a team of rangers and California game wardens executed a search warrant at A.R.K.'s residence and discovered a number of evidence items, including blood and hair samples from the rear of a pick-up truck. A.R.K. eventually confessed to the shooting. Rangers obtained a written confession, the weapon used in the shooting, and a bearskin. A.R.K. had buried the carcass at the bottom of a dry pond, then filled it with water. He has been charged with several wildlife and weapons violations.

The reporting party stated that he had just barely been able to hear the stranded party and that they appeared to be about 100 feet below the top of the cliffs at 10,800 feet. Rangers started hiking to the location from the Mineral King area, and the park helicopter was dispatched with rangers Dave Ashe and Randy Coffman to find a landing spot above the stranded party. The ship was able to land in the vicinity, and Coffman and Ashe then rappeled 200 feet down to the victims - A.M. and S.B. - and assisted them to the ground. Both were in good condition. They reported that they'd been day hiking in the White Chief area, then had headed back down using cross country routes. When they started down the cliff, they realized that they could not get down and also could not get back up the cliff. When rescued, one was on a fairly large ledge, but the other was in a very narrow crack.

They found that she had been taking three to four campground fee envelopes a week for the past two months for a total theft of approximately $400. The investigation began when rangers received information that the woman and her husband had been distributing narcotics in the park and subsequently learned that the pair had sold a quantity of LSD in the park on at least one occasion.

[Kathy Clark, RAD/WRO, 9/2]\n\nThursday, September 24, 1992\n\n92-522 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Campground Closures\n\nOn the night of September 21st, the park was notified that a rodent from Azalea campground in the Grant Grove area had tested positive for bubonic plague. State personnel arrived in the parks on the afternoon of the 22nd and began working on the problem with park personnel. Due to the positive test results, high potential for human contact and history of plague in the area, both Azalea and Crystal Springs campgrounds were closed (Sunset campground was already closed for the season). Current actions center around live trapping rodents to better determine the extent of plague and to better formulate a plan of action. Due to several plague outbreaks on the eastern side of the Sierras, the state will not be able to begin dusting of rodent dens and burrows until approximately the 30th. It's expected that the campgrounds will remain closed for about four weeks.

Of these five, all of whom were concession employees, four were critically injured and three needed to be mechanically extracted from the vehicle. The driver, D.D., was admitted in a hospital in Visalia with pneumothorax, broken ribs and a fracture of the zygoma. G.H., also a front-seat passenger, died shortly after paramedics arrived, apparently from acute intra-abdominal bleeding. A third passenger was admitted to the hospital with a broken back, and the fourth with a flail rib. All occupants of the vehicle were intoxicated. The driver's BAC was 0.16 four hours after the accident. Although the speed limit in the area was posted at 25 mph, the vehicle's speed at the time of the accident has been conservatively estimated at 65 mph. The vehicle hit a rock wall, scraped along it for 100 feet, swerved across the road, went over an embankment and became airborne for 40 feet, then hit a large pine tree. The case has been referred to the U.S. attorney for prosecution.

When the fire brigade arrived on scene, the building, an historic wood frame structure, was totally engulfed in flame. Only the foundation was saved. More information will be sent as soon as it is available. [Doug Morris, CR, SEKI, 1/6]\n\nTuesday, January 12, 1993\n\n93-1 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Follow-up on Structural Fire\n\nGrant Grove Market, the structure which burned to the ground on January 6th, contained a grocery store and cross country ski rental shop, both of which were operated by Guest Services, Inc. The fire department was called out at 3:15 a.m. by a 911 call from a local resident who reported that the market was on fire. When the brigade arrived, the building was fully involved, and the upper parts of all four walls and the entire roof had already burned and collapsed. The building and its contents were a total loss. No other buildings were involved. There were no detection or sprinkler systems in the building, and the fire was discovered only when containers in the market started exploding with sufficient force to awaken nearby residents. The building, which was designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood, who also designed the Ahwahnee Hotel and many other NPS buildings, was under consideration for nomination to the National Historic Register. The building was the park's original lodge when it opened in the late 1920's and also served as a recreation center before becoming the market. Losses are estimated at $200,000. Rangers and Tulare County fire investigators are still investigating the cause of the blaze.

All passengers were injured and Greg Allan Hardenburg was killed. The driver, D.A.D., was subsequently arrested and indicted on charges of vehicular manslaughter, felony drunk driving, driving with a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08, and driving while his privileges were suspended. In a negotiated resolution, D.A.D. entered a plea of guilty to vehicular manslaughter, and the other charges were dismissed.

He was last seen by a park employee who redirected E.B. back to his campsite. E.B. was reported missing that evening and a search for him was begun the following morning. At the time of the report on Friday morning, about 50 people and several dog teams had been committed to the search. Tom Tschohl is the incident commander.

Clues found now indicate that E.B. built a campfire on the night of June 16th about two miles southwest of the campground, then headed downhill into the Yucca Creek drainage. Search efforts yesterday were to concentrate on this rugged area and its turbulent, cold and swift stream and on adjacent drainages. [Pete Allen, SEKI, 6/20]\n\nThursday, June 24, 1993\n\n93-379 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Follow-up on Search\n\nAfter five days of searching rugged terrain for E.B., rangers came upon him walking along North Fork Drive outside the town of Three Rivers, which is adjacent to the park. He was in good spirits and health and declined medical attention. E.B. had walked from Dorst campground down the hazardous Yucca Creek drainage, apparently unaware that 100 ground searchers were combing the hills looking for him. He told investigators that he'd seen the search helicopter about 30 feet above the ground, but that he hadn't made any efforts to attract attention to himself. He said that he'd concluded that he had no choice but to walk out if the helicopter crew didn't spot him. Along the way, he'd managed to kill and eat two lizards. Diligent searchers had found the head of one lizard near a recent firepit, and had concluded that they were on the correct track. IC Tom Tschol praised the efforts of searchers from Sequoia-Kings Canyon and Yosemite, the California Office of Emergency Services, CAP, CARDA, the Tulare County sheriff's department SAR unit, and the Camp Nelson fire department. He also cited Guest Services, the park's concessioner, for their assistance in providing food. [Peter Allen, SEKI, 6/21]\n\nTuesday, June 29, 1993\n\n93-420 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Probable Drowning\n\nAround 6 p.m. on June 26th, J.H.P., 21, was wading with family members in the cold and turbulent water of the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River immediately behind the park's headquarters complex. All but J.H.P. exited the river; he apparently waded out a little further and was swept away by the swift current. A search was immediately begun by ground teams and a contract helicopter, but they were unable to find any sign of him. The search was continuing at the time of the report on Sunday. J.H.P. is presumed to have drowned. About two hours before the search for J.H.P. began, two other visitors were swept away by the current in the same general area, but they managed to extricate themselves from the water. [Peter Allen, SEKI, 6/28]\n\nWednesday, July 7, 1993\n\n93-443 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Rescue\n\nPark dispatch received a 911 call at 8 a.m. on July 3rd advising that a car had gone off the road at Amphitheater Point. Rangers and fire staff responded and found that a car driven by J.K. had gone over the rock retaining wall and continued about 20 feet down an extremely steep slope before coming to rest against a small tree. J.K. had not been wearing seat belts and had sustained injuries to her head and face when she hit the windshield. The vehicle was stabilized and J.K. was evacuated up the scree slope to the park ambulance. She was later transferred to another ambulance and taken to Kaweah Delta Hospital. If J.K.'s vehicle had not struck the tree or had slid sideways, it probably would have traveled another 300 to 400 vertical feet before coming to final rest. [Peter Allen, SEKI, 7/6]\n\nWednesday, July 7, 1993\n\n93-444 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Rescue\n\nA visitor contacted ranger Bob Meadows on the evening of July 2nd and reported that a 15-year-old male had fallen about 75 feet in the Hamilton Lakes area, struck his head, and suffered an open fracture of the skull. Meadows hiked into the area and stabilized the victim. Meanwhile, a ground team made arrangements to respond if necessary. Due to the time of night and the rugged terrain, helicopter evacuation was not feasible until the following day, when a helicopter from NAS Lemoore was utilized to transport the victim to the Valley Medical Center in Fresno. At last report, the victim was in critical condition and suffering from meningitis. [Peter Allen, SEKI, 7/6]\n\nWednesday, July 7, 1993\n\n93-445 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Drowning\n\nOn the afternoon of July 2nd, rangers received a report that a man had fallen into the Roaring River and been swept over Roaring River Falls. Investigation revealed that D.L.C., 27, and a number of his friends were rock scrambling and climbing above the falls in a location which has numerous signs warning people of the hazards of entering the area. D.L.C. lost his footing and fell into the river; he was then swept downstream, over the approximately 60 foot high falls, and into a large pool below the falls. This area is considered hazardous even at low water, and is particularly dangerous this year due to the very high spring runoff. The body was seen by rangers several times on Friday, but all attempts to recover it have so far been unsuccessful. [Peter Allen, SEKI, 7/6]\n\nThursday, July 8, 1993\n\n93-443 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Follow-up on Rescue\n\nJ.K., the driver of the vehicle that went over the wall at Amphitheater Point on July 3rd, has been admitted to a hospital for mental observation. Since the accident, J.K., who has a long history of eccentric behavior, has made numerous telephone calls to public service and land management agencies in the surrounding area with stories about \"dangerous\" items and bombs in her vehicle, and has made threats against ranger Randy Coffman, who was the primary care provider at the accident scene. [Peter Allen, SEKI, 7/6]\n\nThursday, July 8, 1993\n\n93-456 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Rescue\n\nAt 1:40 p.m. on July 5th, ranger Tom Jeffrey was on foot patrol along the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River when he received a report that B.A., 35, had lost her footing and been swept downstream by the river's strong currents. Jeffrey made a quick survey of the river downstream from the location and found B.A. on the far side of the river. She had been swept over several minor drops and through a whitewater area about 100 yards long before she was able to swim to shore. Rangers and members of the park fire crew responded; rangers Coffman and Morey swam the river, set up a tyrolean traverse, and brought B.A. back to the road side of the river. She was treated for minor injuries at the scene, then taken by private vehicle to a local hospital for examination. [Dispatch, SEKI, 7/6]\n\nFriday, July 16, 1993\n\n93-478 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Employee Illness\n\nOn July 11th, Loren Shryer, 69, a seasonal ranger at the Ash Mountain entrance station, was in the Giant Forest area on his lieu day when his car became disabled and he decided to walk out to get help. Just outside the Giant Forest registration office, Shryer suffered an apparent heart attack. Lodgepole rangers responded and stabilized Shryer; he was then taken to Kaweah Delta Hospital. At the time of the report, he was resting well and experiencing no pain. Plans were to release him from the hospital last Tuesday. [Mike Warren, SEKI, 7/13]\n\nFriday, July 16, 1993\n\n93-484 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Rescue\n\nOn July 11th, a visitor came to the Ash Mountain entrance station and reported that a man had suffered some type of seizure while floating down the Southern California Edison flume across the Kaweah River from park headquarters. Rangers Randy Coffman and Mike Warren flew the park contract helicopter over the flume, located the victim, landed about three-quarters of a mile down slope, and hiked up to him. The victim, 58-year-old L.L., complained of pain in his back and had numerous abrasions. He also appeared to be under the influence of alcohol. Additional personnel from the fire management office and the Sierra District were flown in; L.L. was carried down to the helicopter, flown to the Ash Mountain heliport, then driven to Kaweah Delta hospital by Exeter ambulance. [Mike Warren, SEKI, 7/13]\n\nMonday, August 2, 1993\n\n93-546 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Concession Employee Drowning\n\nOn the evening of July 28th, a German visitor advised rangers at Lodgepole campground that he'd seen someone fall in the vicinity of Tokopah Falls on the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River. A second German visitor who was swimming in the pools below the falls reported that she'd seen a daypack wash into the pool with her. She retrieved the daypack and a shirt that had also washed into the pool; after meeting with the male visitor on the trail, the pair hiked to Lodgepole and reported the incident. Due to language problems, there was some initial confusion, but a concession employee who spoke fluent German was able to assist and clear up questions. A quick search of the Marble Fork from the campground to the base of the falls was conducted, but turned up only a pair of jeans. Search operations were suspended after that due to the extreme hazard presented to anyone climbing in the area after dark. The search was resumed the following morning by ground searchers and a contract helicopter. During the early stages of the search, a concession employee reported that he'd been hiking with a friend in the area of the falls, that they'd become separated, and that he'd wondered if the helicopter was looking for his friend. This was the first report received of anyone missing in the area. At about 11 a.m., the searchers located the body of the victim at the bottom of a pool below the falls. The name is being withheld pending notification of next of kin. [Mike Warren, Acting CR, SEKI, 7/28]\n\nTuesday, August 10, 1993\n\n93-583 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Fallen Sequoia\n\nJust after 7:30 a.m. on the morning of August 7th, a giant sequoia twelve feet in diameter fell in front of the old lodge registration desk in Giant Forest. The tree's fall was witnessed by many visitors present in the area; fortunately, none of them were injured. The sequoia took down several large trees, damaged several others, and caused minor damage to a vehicle, the lodge entrance sign and the pavement at the entrance to the parking lot. Although the tree fell parallel to the Generals Highway, debris was scattered across the road, closing it to traffic in both directions. Traffic was detoured around the area via Puzzle Tree Road. Rangers, maintenance employees and the park tree crew responded. A hazard evaluation was completed and three severely damaged trees still standing in the area were removed. The area was cleared and the highway reopened by 11:30 a.m. The park's tree crew foreman estimated that the sequoia was between 1,100 and 1,200 years old. [Kraig Snure, Acting DR, SEKI, 8/9]\n\nTuesday, November 23, 1993\n\n93-813 - Kings Canyon (California) - Structural Fire\n\nAround noon on November 21st, park employees spotted a fire in a two-story wooden cabin in Wilsonia, a private inholding in the Grant Grove area. The cabin was gutted despite an aggressive initial attack response by the Grant Grove fire brigade, which consists mostly of NPS maintenance and GSI concession employees. The brigade was supported by rangers from Cedar Grove, Lodgepole and Ash Mountain, and by the Tulare County fire department. The cabin, which was valued at $120,000 by its owner, was a total loss. The owner reported that he'd left the door of his wood stove open while out of the residence. The cause of the fire is under investigation. [FMO, SEKI, 11/22]\n\nTuesday, December 7, 1993\n\n93-843 - Sequoia (California) - Possible Explosive Device\n\nA local landowner called rangers on December 3rd and advised that there was what appeared to be an explosive device on the road to Oriole Lake in a remote area of the Mineral King subdistrict. A 1.5 by 6.5 inch section of PVC pipe was found lying on the side of the road; both ends of the pipe had been sealed by a silicone-type sealant, and a wire protruded from one end. Tulare County explosive demolition personnel were summoned to the area and confirmed that the device was probably an explosive. The device was destroyed at the scene. Fragments were recovered and will be further analyzed. The county and park are conducting a joint investigation. [Mike Warren, Acting CR, SEKI, 12/3]\n\nWednesday, December 15, 1993\n\n93-853 - Sequoia (California) - Fallen Sequoia; Structural Damage\n\nAround noon on December 11th, a large limb - approximately ten inches in diameter and 25 feet long - fell from a giant sequoia and struck the gift shop in the Giant Forest area. The building was occupied by several concession employees at the time, but no one was injured. The area was immediately secured and warnings were posted. The park's forestry crew is in the process of removing another threatening limb and assessing whether there is potential for more such failures. No structural damage assessment has yet been made. On August 7th, a giant sequoia twelve feet in diameter fell in front of the old lodge registration desk in Giant Forest (93-583). No one was injured in that incident, but the sequoia took down several large trees, damaged several others, and caused minor damage to a vehicle, the lodge entrance sign and the pavement at the entrance to the parking lot. A hazard evaluation was completed at that time and three severely damaged trees that were still standing in the area were removed. [Alan Schmierer, RAD/WRO, 12/14]\n\nWednesday, June 1, 1994\n\n94-256 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Larceny Arrest\n\nRangers brought an extended investigation of pipe safe thefts to a successful conclusion on May 27th with the arrest of M.L.H., 34, of Lennox, California. There have been multiple thefts from campground pipe safes over the last year in which the thief employed some sort of \"fishing\" device to withdraw fee envelopes back through the deposit slot. Recently, M.L.H. and a female companion, C.L.G., 19, had been identified as suspects in a pipe safe theft in Cedar Grove. Nightly surveillance of the Potwisha campground was begun and paid off when M.L.H. was observed working for an hour and a half on a pipe safe there at 3:30 a.m. on a recent morning. M.L.H. and C.L.G. were subsequently arrested as they attempted to leave the area. The U.S. attorney declined to press charges against C.L.G., but M.L.H. was charged with theft of public monies, possession of a loaded weapon, possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and tampering. The investigation is continuing. The couple is believed to have visited other parks, and may have committed similar offenses in campgrounds both in national parks and other jurisdictions. Parks who have had similar losses or rangers who may have contacted M.L.H. or C.L.G. are asked to call Pete Allen or Randy Larson at 209-565-3341 or contact them via cc:Mail. [Pete Allen, SEKI, 5/27]\n\nThursday, June 16, 1994\n\n94-304 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Search in Progress\n\nOn Monday, June 13th, the park received a report that R.O., 45, a German citizen working temporarily for NASA at Edwards Air Force Base, was overdue from a visit to the park. Rangers found his vehicle at a trailhead in Mineral King Valley, and have established that he was probably in the area for a day hike. A hasty search was conducted that afternoon, but failed to turn up any clues. The search is now focusing on Paradise Peak and the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River. [Debbie Bird, CR, SEKI, 6/15]\n\nMonday, June 20, 1994\n\n94-304 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Follow-up on Search\n\nDespite a massive effort over a two-day period last week, searchers were unable to find any clues as to the present location or condition of R.O., 45, of Manching, Germany; the search, accordingly, was scaled back significantly on Friday. Six ground searchers are continuing an investigation of the Cliff Creek area and attempting to gain information from other hikers who may have passed through the area and seen R.O. Interest from the European press remains fairly high. [Pete Allen, LES, SEKI, 6/17]\n\nWednesday, June 22, 1994\n\n94-304 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Follow-up on Search\n\nR.O., who had been missing in the park since Sunday, June 12th, and was the subject of an intensive search last week, walked into the Buckeye Flat campground around 9 a.m. on the morning of Saturday, June 18th. Except for some bread and raisins which he'd brought along for his lunch when he headed out on a day hike on the 12th, R.O. had been without food during the entire period. He had become lost when he took an old, unused trail, which eventually petered out and left him in heavy brush and steep terrain. R.O. was in good physical condition. He was reunited with fellow workers, who had flown out from Edwards Air Force Base for a helicopter overflight of the search area. [Pete Allen, SEKI, 6/18]\n\nWednesday, July 20, 1994\n\n94-402 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Visitor Injury\n\nOn the evening of July 17th, visitor B.W. of Bensalem, Pennsylvania, was injured when the top half of a white fir fell into her van. Neither W.'s husband nor her two children were hurt. She was placed on a backboard and taken to Kaweah Delta hospital in Visalia. The white fir was a standing dead snag about 15 feet off the roadway on Buena Vista curve about a mile below Giant Forest village. The W.'s vehicle sustained about $10,000 in damages to its roof, windshield and right passenger area. [Tom Tschol, SEKI, 7/19]\n\nWednesday, July 27, 1994\n\n94-426 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Assaults on Rangers\n\nShortly after midnight on July 23rd, rangers Tom Jeffrey and Thien Do approached P.M., 34, of Ridgecrest, California, regarding out-of- bounds camping in the Potwisha area. P.M. was sitting in his vehicle with his keys in the ignition. Jeffrey had seen P.M. driving about 20 minutes earlier; he now saw an open container of alcohol in the vehicle and began an investigation to determine if P.M. had been driving under the influence. As Jeffrey attempted to place him in custody, P.M. charged him, placed his hands around Jeffrey's neck and attempted to choke him. Jeffrey broke free and employed Capstun on P.M., who rand down a trail, crossed the Kaweah River and disappeared into the forest. Do then made a show of driving away, while Jeffrey waited near P.M.' car. When P.M. returned, Jeffrey again attempted an arrest. P.M. punched him in the face, knocking him down, then punched Do in the face and again escaped. Only when three other rangers appeared on scene did P.M. submit to arrest. Various charges, including DUI and assaults on federal officers, are being filed in federal court. [Pete Allen, LEO, SEKI, 7/26]\n\nThursday, July 28, 1994\n\n94-430 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Falling Fatality\n\nOn the afternoon of July 23rd, M.B., 32, of Oceanside, California, was hiking with her husband near the top of Mist Falls when she reportedly walked out on a ledge, slipped, and was carried over the falls, plunging 130 feet to her death. Rangers recovered her body after diving into the pool at the base of the falls. Because of discrepancies in her husband's account of what happened, rangers and FBI agents are conducting an investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death. [Tom Tschohl, SEKI, 7/26]\n\nFriday, July 29, 1994\n\n94-433 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Multiples SAR/EMS Incidents\n\nOn July 27th, rangers managed five separate significant incidents, including two major searches and two backcountry medevacs. Search efforts were assisted by searchers from Yosemite NP, Lemoore and China Lake Naval Air Stations, Sierra Madre SAR, and CARDA SAR dogs. A 47-year-old man from Thousand Oaks was located in good health near the Hockett Meadows ranger station 36 hours after he left his campsite to relieve himself; a 52-year- old Davis man was evacuated from Dusty Basin after suffering from high altitude pulmonary edema; a 60-year-old man from Berkeley suffering from altitude illness and fatigue was evacuated from Wanda Lake; and a 34-year- old Frazier Park man was located in good condition 28 hours after he was reported missing by his hiking companion. [Debbie Bird, CR, SEKI, 7/28]\n\nThursday, September 8, 1994\n\n94-534 - Sequoia-Kings Canyon (California) - MVA with Fatality\n\nOn the afternoon of September 3rd, G.J.F. of Monterey Park was killed in a one vehicle rollover in the Mineral King area of the park. G.J.F. was one of four occupants of a sedan which was leaving the area when its brakes apparently failed just above the Lookout Point entrance station and it went off the side of the road. The entrance station fee collector, who witnessed the accident, was able to reach the vehicle, which was about 250 feet down the slope beside the road. G.J.F. was found to be in full cardiac arrest; although CPR was begun immediately, she did not survive her injuries. It appears that she was not wearing her seatbelt, was ejected, and was injured when the vehicle rolled over her. Two other occupants of the vehicle remain hospitalized, one in serious condition with a basal skull fracture. The cause of the accident is under investigation. [Debbie Bird, CR, SEKI, 9/6]\n\nMonday, October 3, 1994\n\n94-583 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Pedestrian Fatality\n\nWhile travelling home from Ash Mountain headquarters on Highway 198 on September 28th, a park interpretive ranger accidentally struck and killed a pedestrian, later identified as C.R., son of a former park maintenance employee. C.R., who was on foot, had crossed to the center of the roadway, then turned to go back and was struck. No charges have been filed against the ranger. [Randy Coffman, SEKI, 10/3]\n\nTuesday, January 31, 1995\n\n95-36 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Death of Employee\n\nAnne Shepherd, the budget assistant for the Division of Fire and Visitor Management, died suddenly on the evening of January 28th following a short illness. She was 45 years old. Anne started her 22-year career with the National Park Service as a park aide at Foothills Visitor Center. Her first permanent assignment was as the mail and files clerk, and she became well known as the mail and files \"guru\" due to her comprehensive knowledge of the central files. In 1992, Anne applied for and was selected for her \"dream job\" - budget assistant to the chief ranger. She loved her job and it showed in every occasion she took to help solve a problem for a ranger out in the park. Funeral services will be held Thursday, February 2nd, at Three Rivers cemetery in Three Rivers, California. The family has asked that donations be made in Anne's name to the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks Foundation in lieu of flowers.

On January 31st, he underwent surgery to implant a shunt designed to drain an accumulation of fluid on the brain resulting from the encephalitis that occurred secondary to the cocci-meningitis. Mike came through the procedure well, but his doctor is restricting visits and phone calls for the next two days. Mike is expected to remain at Kaweah-Delta Hospital in Visalia, California, for the next week or two. Full recovery may take up to a year.

H.B. and three others left the Motecito- Sequoia Lodge in Sequoia National Forest and skied to Big Baldy. Just short of their goal, they removed their skis to walk to the summit. On the descent, H.B. slipped and slid about 2,100 feet down a steep slope, sustaining fatal injuries. H.B. was participating in a \"Naturalists At Large\" outdoor education program for high school students at Montecito-Sequoia. The accident is under investigation.

J.D., an employee of Guest Services, Inc., had gone to Moro Rock with three friends. According to witnesses, J.D. and one of his friends climbed over the railing and were walking on the exposed slick rock when J.D. slipped and fell. Alcohol was apparently a factor in the accident.

She did not see the person who fired the shots, but had earlier seen an adult male in the area. His description was relayed to local law enforcement officers, who found and stopped the man about two hours later. The man had a .30 caliber handgun in his possession; he admitted to firing the weapon in the area of the incident, but said he was only target shooting and had no intent to fire at any person. Officers could find no evidence to connect him with any anti-government movement or \"home rule\" organization. The man was charged with discharging a firearm over a body of water, then released.

J.R. had scrambled downhill to the edge of the water in the Hospital Rock area and was rock- hopping when he misjudged a jump and fell into the river. He was swept over several waterfalls in the cold, fast-moving water, and was last seen floating face down in a large pool several hundred yards downstream from his point of entry. The swift, cold water is hindering ranger efforts to locate and recover his body.

He was not reported missing until Monday, August 7th, when he was a week overdue. A major search effort was initiated at that time. A search team of about 30 park staff and other personnel are now in the process of checking a very large area for clues as to his location. Paige Ritterbusch is incident commander. Because of the very late spring, there are large amounts of snow and high water levels throughout the area. These would have presented hazards to K.D. - as they are to searchers.

T.S., an experienced and well-equipped backpacker, was two days overdue when a helicopter crew found him near Summit Lake. T.S. was uninjured and in good condition, but had been pinned down by storms since 4 a.m. on the previous Monday. He was making slow progress through three feet of fresh snow when spotted.

Morgenson has been a seasonal backcountry ranger at the park for more than 20 years, and is considered skilled and competent. The last radio contact with him was on July 20th.

[Mike O'Neal, LES, PGSO]\n\nTuesday, July 30, 1996\n\n96-418 - Sequoia-Kings Canyon (California) - Follow-up on Search for Ranger\n\nA full-scale search is underway for seasonal backcountry ranger Randy Morgenson, 54, who has not been seen or heard from since Sunday, July 21st. About 65 people, a few search dog teams, a mountain rescue team, and four helicopters were deployed yesterday. Morgenson was last seen by two backpackers while on his way back to his patrol cabin at Bench Lake on the 21st. The backpackers said that there was nothing unusual about their contact with him. Morgenson slept at the Bench Lake patrol cabin that night, then headed out the next day on an extended patrol. The latter was determined from a note he left on the door of the ranger station that morning. During the \"morning roundup\" at 11 a.m., when every backcountry ranger is supposed to radio in, the dispatcher heard static when Morgenson's radio was on, indicating the possibility that he was trying to contact dispatch but was in a bad location for transmitting. There was no voice contact. Morgenson is a highly experienced backcountry ranger with 27 years in the park and is very familiar with his patrol area and its difficult terrain. Altitudes in the area range from 11,000 to 14,000 feet, and much of the terrain is only accessible to persons with mountaineering experience. The search effort is being led by backcountry district ranger and incident commander Randy Coffman. Because of the altitude and rugged terrain, it's difficult to bring in additional search personnel, particularly those from sea level, as it would take days to acclimate them to the altitude.

Ninety-two people from five organizations and agencies are currently involved in the search, 63 of them in the field. Included are eight dog teams. Four helicopters were deployed yesterday; an Army Blackhawk with forward-looking infrared (FLIR) detection equipment was utilized Sunday night, but without success. No definitive clues have yet been found. The search effort will focus on the Arrow Peak and Lake Basin areas today. If nothing turns up, a reassessment of options will be made tonight. Searchers are also looking into the possibility that Morgenson may be outside the search area.

As of Wednesday, no significant clues had been found. The search continued yesterday with 15 search teams, including helicopters and numerous dog teams. [Annie Esperanza, Plans Chief, Morgenson SAR Incident, SEKI]\n\nMonday, August 5, 1996\n\n96-418 - Sequoia-Kings Canyon (California) - Follow-up on Search for Ranger\n\nThe search for seasonal ranger Randy Morgenson was scaled back over the weekend due to the lack of any clues as to his whereabouts. The park will station one person at Bench Lake to interview hikers, and others will conduct intermittent patrols through the search area. Critical incident stress debriefings were held over the weekend for all employees involved in the search. [Debbie Bird, CR, SEKI]\n\nWednesday, August 14, 1996\n\n96-457 - Sequoia-Kings Canyon (California) - HazMat Spill: Chlorine Gas\n\nOn August 12th, a leaking cylinder of chlorine gas prompted the evacuation of about 170 employees and visitors from park headquarters and the Foothill visitor center. The cylinder, which holds about 150 pounds of chlorine gas used for water and wastewater treatment, had been loaded on to a park vehicle for delivery to an outlying area when the rupture occurred. Rangers utilized ICS to manage the incident, clearing and securing the area within a matter of minutes. A county hazmat team responded from Visalia. The cylinder was sealed and removed from the park later that evening. Thirteen park employees, including six firefighters, were treated for minor injuries at a local hospital and released. [Debbie Bird, CR, SEKI]\n\nWednesday, August 21, 1996\n\n96-418 - Sequoia-Kings Canyon (California) - Follow-up on Search for Ranger\n\nThe search for seasonal backcountry ranger Randy Morgenson, who has not been seen or heard from since Saturday, July 20th, was suspended on August 3rd. The park has provided a recap of search and investigative efforts to date: Early on the afternoon of July 23rd, the secretary for the Kings Canyon district advised district ranger Randy Coffman that the last communication with Morgenson might have been on the 21st. A check was made, and it was ascertained that he had last been heard from on the 20th, when he reported his position via park radio as at Mather Pass on the Pacific Crest Trail. Raes Lakes ranger Rick Sanger was dispatched to Bench Lake to check on Morgenson. Sanger arrived on the 24th and found a note on Morgenson's tent stating that he was on a three to four day patrol. Coffman and rangers Durkee, Lyness and Graban were flown to the Bench Lake station later that day, and plans were made to begin a search of high probability areas the next morning. A search was begun of Morgenson's 80 square mile patrol area on the 24th. The numbers and types of resources utilized grew with each search period, and peaked on July 30th with 94 people, five helicopters (one with forward-looking infrared search capability), and eight dog teams from 16 agencies. On August 2nd, the search was scaled back, and the final search team was demobilized on the 3rd. As part of an on-going effort, backcountry rangers have been assigned to look for clues while on patrol in the search area. Resource management staff and trail crew personnel scheduled to work in and around the search area during the remainder of the season and all park employees planning trips in the area are being encouraged to watch for clues that could assist in the investigation. A parallel investigation has meanwhile been underway. Morgenson's name has been entered into NCIC and CLETS data banks as a missing person, notices have been placed at trailheads throughout the area, and bulletins have been sent to numerous local, state and federal government law enforcement agencies. Investigations are being conducted into his physical and mental status. An on-site investigation of the Bench Lake ranger station has been conducted for evidence and clues to his location. Family, friends and supervisors have been interviewed, and personal effects, including his vehicle, have been located and inventoried. Hospitals, airports, train and bus stations, banks, hotels, motels and other businesses where Morgenson may have traveled have been contacted. Backcountry permit issuing stations for the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mexican border to the park have been queried for information on who may have been traveling on the trail in the Bench Lake area around the time of Morgenson's disappearance. Several other leads have been or are currently being investigated. [Randy Coffman, SEKI]\n\nTuesday, September 3, 1996\n\n96-512 - Sequoia/Kings Canyon (California) - Climbing Fatality\n\nOn the afternoon of September 1st, D.D., 64, the president of the California Mountaineering Club, fell between 600 and 1,000 feet to his death while climbing on the Devil's Crag. D.D. was preparing to rapell down to his partner, Herbert Buehler, some 20 feet below, when Buehler heard him exclaim: \"Oh no!\" Buehler heard rock tumbling, so moved in close to the wall. After the rock fall, Buehler was unable to make voice contact with D.D., and the wall was so vertical that he couldn't see down. He subsequently climbed out and reported the incident to wilderness ranger George Durkee. Rangers located D.D.'s body on an 80 degree slope on the morning of September 2nd. Access was difficult due to the precipitous terrain and abundance of loose rock. D.D. had climbed most of the major peaks in the Sierras at least once, and many of them twice. This was his second or third ascent of Devil's Crag. Due to the loose rock on the vertical walls and the abundance of rock fall, the peak is described as one which requires a great deal of skill, along with luck.

Blowing winds and drifting snow made travel extremely difficult. The two well-prepared backpackers stayed on the trail, spelled out SOS in the snow, and waited in their tent for rescue. The storms that have been hitting the Sierras made access by helicopter difficult, but a skilled team from the Lemoore Naval Air Station was able to extricate the two very exhausted by healthy hikers on October 29th. [Tom Tschohl, DR, SEKI]\n\nFriday, January 10, 1997\n\n96-707 - Western Areas - Follow-up on Winter Storm Impacts\n\nStorm damage reports have been received from two more areas. The next update on the situation in Yosemite will appear on Monday or Tuesday:\n\no Sequoia-Kings Canyon NP and Devils Postpile NM (California) - The storms that hit the west coast after the first of the year caused significant damage throughout the two parks. This storm dropped up to four inches of precipitation at the 2,000 foot level and eight inches at the 7,000 foot level. The higher elevations already had a significant snowpack; the warm rain falling on it caused a runoff which exceeded anything seen in recent decades. Devils Postpile had over 14 inches of precipitation within three days. There were over 75 rock and mud slides on the Generals Highway between Ash Mountain and Giant Forest in Sequoia-Kings Canyon, and there were road washouts at Deer Creek and Halstead Meadow. All of these will be cleaned up and roads will again be open within the week. The foot bridge at Buckeye Flat campground crossing the Middle Fork of the Kaweah has been washed away. This bridge was approximately 20 feet above the normal water levels in this drainage. Several sections of the road into Mineral King have been undermined by the heavy flow of water. Numerous county bridges maintained by the local power company or county which are further downstream in the Kaweah drainage have also been washed away. There are over nine major washouts on Highway 180 just outside Kings Canyon. The highway provides the primary access road into Cedar Grove. One washout is over a half mile in length. There are also three significant slides with boxcar size rocks on the highway. The main road bridge adjacent to the ranger station at Cedar Grove within the park has been destroyed, and the motor nature trail in Cedar Grove has been completely washed out. The main foot bridge at Soda Springs in Devils Postpile was washed out. There was also extensive damage to the campgrounds, culverts, and the local wat"
