        "text": "1. THE DESIGN ARGUMENT natural theology\n\n3. Proof of God Applied Pure Reason Reason\n\n4. THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES • Cosmological: the universe and everything in it depends on something [God] for its existence. • Teleological: the natural world appears to have been designed (with a purpose) by a designer [God]. • Ontological: existence of God is entailed by the concept of God.\n\n5. PLATO Timaeus (circa 360 BCE) A benevolent demiurge (craftsman) who worked with pre-existing matter to create everything according to an eternal model (paradigmata) consisting of ideals (forms, eidos).\n\n6. ARISTOTLE Physics : Five elements (addition of the quintessence, aether) Metaphysics: Four causes (explanation of how a thing came about)\n\n7. '$()*+$#& ! \"#$%& 3/*4$#& ! ,-$.)&/0&1/2#& 789+):(& ! '$5)&1%&$&1/2#&4$6)*& 3+:$#& ! ;<*./=)&/0&-/#5+:>&2+:)&\n\n8. \"#(%&)#*' ! \"#$%&' 2.&3#*' ! +,#-%'./'.&0#1' 567)%1(' ! 4' 2)1#*' ! 4'\n\n9. THOMAS AQUINAS 1224 - 1274 Converted Platonic demiurge into Christian God. Summa Theologica Five proofs for the existence of God (“The Five Ways”)\n\n10. FROM MOTION Nothing can move itself. If every object in motion had a mover, then the ﬁrst object in motion needed a mover. This ﬁrst mover is the Unmoved Mover, called God.\n\n11. FROM CAUSATION There exists things that are caused (created) by other things. Nothing can be the cause of itself (nothing can create itself.) There can not be an endless string of objects causing other objects to exist. Therefore, there must be an uncaused ﬁrst cause called God.\n\n12. THE DESIGN ARGUMENT Teleological argument Common sense tells us that the universe works in such a way that one can conclude that it was designed by an intelligent designer.\n\n13. EVIDENTIALISM Any claim is rational if and only if there is sufﬁcient evidence to support it, and rationality is in direct proportion to the balance of evidence. David Hume\n\n15. PHYSICO-THEOLOGY • Revival of a posteriori arguments • John Ray - Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of the Creation (1691) • Particularly British (and Protestant) • Richard Bentley – A Confutation of Atheism (1692) • William Derham – Physico-Theology • Aimed at the lay public rather than (1715) theologians or natural philosophers • Joseph Priestly – Disquisitions Pertaining to Matter and Spirit (1777)\n\n16. NEWTON “This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent Being. … This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the world, but as Lord over all; and on account of his dominion he is wont to be called Lord God pantokrator … The Supreme God is a Being eternal, inﬁnite, absolutely perfect being; but a being, however perfect, without dominion is not the Lord God.”\n\n17. NEWTON “Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done.”\n\n18. ROBERT BOYLE The universe “is like a rare clock … where all things are so skillfully contrived, that the engine being once set a-moving, all things proceed according to the artiﬁcer's ﬁrst design, and the motions … do not require the particular interposing of the artiﬁcer, or any intelligent agent employed by him, but perform their functions upon particular occasions, by virtue of the general and primitive contrivance of the whole engine.”\n\n19. JOHN RAY “There is for a free man no occupation more worthy and delightful than to contemplate the beauteous works of nature and honour the inﬁnite wisdom and goodness of God.” (1660)\n\n20. JOHN RAY “Let it not sufﬁce to be book- learned, to read what others have written and to take upon trust more falsehood than truth, but let us ourselves examine things as we have opportunity, and converse with Nature as well as with books.” (1691)\n\n21. 1802\n\n26. CICERO “When you see a sundial or a water- clock, you see that it tells the time by design and not by chance. How then can you imagine that the universe as a whole is devoid of purpose and intelligence, when it embraces everything, including these artifacts themselves and their artiﬁcers?” De Natura Deorum\n\n29. ELLIOT SOBER A: X is intricate and well suited to a task T W1: X is a product of intelligent design W2: X is a product of random physical forces Paley claims that the likelihood of W1 given A exceeds that of W2, i.e. P(A|W1) >> P(A|W2) This is an abduction to the best explanation\n\n30. THE DESIGN ARGUMENT Many of the things we observe are complicated, intricate and work well together. This cannot have arisen by chance and therefore must have arisen by design. Design implies a Designer (Argument to Design) Good, perfect and benevolent design implies a good, perfect, benevolent designer God (Argument from Design)\n\n31. Contrivance shows presence of designing intelligence whose attributes “must be adequate to the magnitude, extent, and multiplicity of his operations” “Uniformity of plan observable in the universe” reﬂects the unity and wisdom of God. Goodness is proven by beneﬁcial nature of contrivances and pleasure added to animal sensations\n\n32. “WE HAVE NO REASON TO FEAR” “The hinges in the wings of an earwig and the joints of its antennae, are as highly wrought, as if the Creator had nothing else to ﬁnish. We see no signs of diminution of care by multiplicity of objects, or of distraction of thought by variety. We have no reason to fear, therefore, our being forgotten, or overlooked, or neglected.”\n\n33. “WE HAVE NO REASON TO FEAR”\n\n34. DAVID HUME\n\n35. NATURAL RELIGION Treatise on Human Nature (1739-’40) Our ideas reach no farther than our experience and we can thus have no conception of divine attributes\n\n36. REVEALED RELIGION An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1748) It is never reasonable to believe in violations of natural law\n\n37. ORIGIN OF RELIGION Natural History of Religion (1757) We are only left with “vulgar religion” - the religion of the masses, emotions and instincts. This religion has its origin in dread of the unknown\n\n38. NATURAL RELIGION Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion 1750’s / 1779\n\n39. HUME’S VERSION OF PALEY Watches are a product of intelligent design Watches and organisms are similar (to a degree) ∴ Organisms are a product of intelligent design. (This is an argument from analogy)\n\n40. HUME’S (?) CONCLUSION • Design argument is a ﬂawed analogy • Limits of our experience of the vast universe • No deﬁnitive proof of the unity, powerfulness, or presence of the creator • “atotal suspension of judgement is here our only reasonable resource.”\n\n41. All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: The rich man in his castle, The Lord God made them all. The poor man at his gate, He made them, high or lowly, Each little ﬂower that opens, And ordered their estate. Each little bird that sings, He made their glowing colors, He made their tiny wings.\n\n42. All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: The rich man in his castle, The Lord God made them all. The poor man at his gate, He made them, high or lowly, Each little ﬂower that opens, And ordered their estate. Each little bird that sings, He made their glowing colors, He made their tiny wings.\n\n43. All things dull and ugly, All things sick and cancerous, All creatures short and squat, All evil great and small, All things rude and nasty, All things foul and dangerous, The Lord God made the lot. The Lord God made them all. Each little snake that poisons, All things scabbed and ulcerous, Each little wasp that stings, All pox both great and small, He made their brutish venom, Putrid, foul and gangrenous, He made their horrid wings. The Lord God made them all.\n\n45. THE PROBLEM OF EVIL Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then He is not omnipotent. Is He able, but not willing? Then He is malevolent. Is He both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is He neither able nor willing? Then why call Him God?\n\n47. “NATURE, RED IN TOOTH & CLAW” Are God and Nature then at strife, That Nature lends such evil dreams? So careful of the type she seems, So careless of the single life; ‘So careful of the type?’ but no. From scarped cliff and quarried stone She cries, ‘A thousand types are gone: I care for nothing, all shall go."
