        "text": "The other week, the New Scientist published a lengthy report about an Amazonian tribe called the Piraha. They are, it is believed, unique: they have virtually no notion of time, little oral history, almost no art, and the simplest kinship system known. They are also believed to be the only society with no creation myth. But why are there not more like them?\n\nThe simplistic explanation is that everyone - apart from a relatively small number of South Americans and decadent western atheists - believes the world to have been created, and so needs a story to explain how. But the fact that large numbers of people, even the vast majority, believe something is not a good enough reason to suppose it is true.\n\nThe real reason creation myths are near universal was given by the Scottish philosopher David Hume. Hume observed that without an idea of cause and effect, we would be utterly incapable of making sense of the world around us. The problem, however, is that all we observe is one darn thing after another: we never actually see one thing causing something else. Nor do we have sound rational reasons for leaping from observations of regularity to the conclusion that two things are linked by some necessary connection.\n\nFortunately, nature has bridged this logical and empirical gap for us. The idea of a necessary connection between events is something the mind imposes on its perceptions. But because this is a deep-rooted and automatic instinct, we tend to think that the causal links have in fact been observed, not imposed by our minds.\n\nBecause our minds are thus busy imposing a causal order on our perceptions, we often end up seeing causes where there are none. For instance, we touch a lucky bunny before we buy our lottery tickets and if we win, we attribute the victory to the rabbit.\n\nIt is as though we are causation-greedy, preferring a bad explanation to none at all. So we naturally ask where the universe comes from, and in the absence of any reliable way of discovering the real answers, we make a best guess, which usually means describing cosmic creation in ways analogous to more familiar forms, such as a birth or the act of a purposive inventor.\n\nApart from the Piraha, that is, which might seem to bugger up the Humean explanation. But as he said when caught out over another exception to a general rule, \"This instance is so singular, that it is scarcely worth our observing.\" Well, no theory is perfect."
