        "text": "Space for Peak Performances\n\nThe Rio 2016 Games provided the best possible environment for peak performances. Athletes enjoyed world-class facilities, including a superb village, all located in one of the world’s most beautiful cities, in a compact layout for maximum convenience.\n\nCompact Layout\n\nThe competition venues were clustered in four zones—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro and Maracanã—and connected by a high-performance transport ring. Nearly half of the athletes could reach their venues in less than 10 minutes, and almost 75 per cent could do so in less than 25 minutes.\n\nVenue Facts\n\nOf the 34 competition venues, eight underwent some permanent works, seven were totally temporary and nine were constructed as permanent legacy venues.\n\nSpotlight on Rio\n\nThe Rio Games also celebrated and showcased sport, thanks to the city’s stunning setting and a desire to lift event presentation to new heights. At the same time, Rio 2016 was an opportunity to deliver the broader aspirations for the long-term future of the city, region and country—an opportunity to hasten the transformation of Rio de Janeiro into an even greater global city."
