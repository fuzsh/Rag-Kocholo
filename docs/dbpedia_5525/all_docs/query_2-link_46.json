He has been a psychologist for over thirty years and is the author of four books: two on organizational teamwork as well as \"The God Virus-How Religion Infects Our Lives and Culture\" and \"Sex and God-How Religion Distorts Sexuality\".\n\nDr. Ray has been a student of religion most of his life and holds a Masters Degree in religion as well as a Bachelor's Degree in Sociology/Anthropology with a Doctorate in Psychology.\n\nPhil Session,\n\nBoard Member\n\nPhil Session was born and raised just outside of Dallas, TX, in two church homes, one Baptist and the other a Free Church of God in Christ.\n\nAfter getting involved with the secular community in 2013, his efforts centered around volunteerism and community service projects. That passion led him to organize and attend hundreds of volunteer activities in groups centered around non-belief in Austin and San Antonio over the past few years.\n\nPhil is the volunteer coordinator for the Freethinkers Association of Central Texas and serves on its board of directors. He is also the head organizer/coordinator for Austin Atheists Helping the Homeless.

After awaking from the cult in 2017 she quickly started her own Ex-Jehovah’s Witness Meetup in the Denver metro area. She is an active member of The Secular Hub as well as managing the membership database for Jefferson Humanists. Shana was invited to participate in the A&E Leah Remini Scientology: The Aftermath Season 3 Special Jehovah’s Witnesses in 2018.\n\nShe is passionate about helping fellow “awoke” members of society to help navigate the secular world.

David is also passionate about the arts and social justice. A classically trained bass vocalist, David has sang with a variety of choirs, mostly members of the Gay and Lesbian Association of Choruses.\n\nRaised as a strict Evangelical Christian, the son of a Pentecostal preacher, and once a self-proclaimed “Young-Earth Creationist” David used logic and the scientific method to break free from that ideology and emerge a secular humanist. As such he is passionate for social justice and an activist and ally in the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nShanon Nebo,\n\nTreasurer\n\nShanon Nebo was the co-founder and President of Be Secular, an apparel company that promotes secularism and humanism with branding, image, and donations to secular organizations.\n\nShe has blogged on Patheos about current events and her life as a secular mother and volunteered for the Reason Rally managing their social media platforms.\n\nShanon is a humanist, feminist, and atheist who advocates strongly for the ideas espoused in those labels. She might also describe herself as a coffeeist, believing firmly in the goodness inherent in it and its ability to inspire, motivate, and bring comfort to those who most need it.\n\nSherrie D’Souza,\n\nBoard Member\n\nSherrie D'Souza was born and raised in Sydney Australia as a Jehovah's Witness, devoting much of her youth to full-time volunteering for the religion. After learning of the gross cover-up of child sexual abuse in the religion, she left the religion in 2016 (following her husband Sacha, who had patiently waited for his wife to wake up from the cult).\n\nIn 2018 Sherrie & Sacha joined the JWsurvey team (now JWWatch https://jwwatch.org/) as Editor of the Global JW Survey and Aftercare & Support Manager, answering the initial emails from awakening Jehovah's Witnesses the world over. In June 2019, Sherrie & Sacha hosted the largest gathering of former Jehovah's Witnesses in Sydney, an afternoon focused on healing, recovery, and positivity. Among the attendees was Federal Justice, the Honourable Angus Stewart, who had been the senior legal counsel in the Australian Royal Commission of Institutional Response to Child Sexual Abuse, investigating the Jehovah's Witnesses in Case Studies 29 & 54.\n\nSherrie is passionate about supporting others and in April 2020 started the first RfR Support Group in Sydney. With a secular background in healthcare administration, Sherrie now works from home and enjoys the flexibility this gives her to do more in establishing RfR in Australia. When she isn't banging away at her keyboard, you will find her playing with her Abyssinian cats, Abernathy & Sidney, indulging in her hobbies of cross-stitching and diamond painting, or just chilling watching Sci-Fi with Sacha.\n\nRachel Hunt,\n\nParliamentarian\n\nRachel is a motorcycle-riding ballroom dance teacher from rural Texas.\n\nMarried with two adult children, Rachel has a strong interest in psychology, philosophy, and communication, in addition to the creative arts and home improvement. She was raised in Christian Science but drifted off as a teenager. She explored Scientology, Law of Attraction, and a variety of Protestant churches before settling comfortably into atheism.\n\nSince joining RFR in late 2020, Rachel has come to view this community as a core part of her life. She has become friends with many of her fellow volunteers and loves the opportunity to grow her peer support and leadership skills. You may have seen her hosting the Women’s Support group, posting in the Online Community as Spinouette, or at the Fall Excursion.\n\nNathan Phelps,\n\nEmeritus Board Member\n\nNathan is an author and speaker on religion and child abuse,as well as an outspoken LGBT advocate, and the Executive Director for the Center For Inquiry in Calgary.
