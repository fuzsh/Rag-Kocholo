        "text": "The Kansas Statewide Transgender Education Project announced Wednesday the keynote speaker for its first TransKansas conference will be former Westboro Baptist Church member Nate Phelps.\n\nThe organization said Phelps, a vocal Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender advocate who speaks against the dangers of religion and child abuse, will be the keynote speaker at a banquet Sept. 7 at the Lawrence Holiday Inn, 200 McDonald.\n\nThe conference will be Sept. 6-8 at the Bert Nash Community Mental Health Center, 200 Maine St., in Lawrence.\n\nPhelps, who resides in Calgary, Alberta, is an estranged son of Westboro Baptist Church Pastor Fred W. Phelps Sr.\n\n“This conference sends a powerful message that transgender people do not need to fear those who don’t understand, even in Kansas,” said Stephanie Mott, the organizations executive director.\n\nK-STEP is an all-volunteer, nonprofit group that formed in August 2010 to bring an end to discrimination against transgender people and their families through education, according to the organization’s news release announcing the conference.\n\nThe TransKansas conference will include an opening welcome Sept. 6. Sept. 7 will be the main portion of the conference with multiple workshops during the day.\n\nThe cost to attend either the conference or the banquet/keynote speaker is $25, or $45 for both. Student discounts are available.\n\nFor more information, visit www.transkansas.com or contact Mott at (785) 215-7436. She also can be reached via email at stephanieequality@yahoo.com."
