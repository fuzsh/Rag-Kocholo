        "text": "M.D., F.R.C.S.(C.), F.A.C.S.\n\n(DIPL. AMERICAN BOARD OF SURGERY)\n\nJuly 24, 1920 – November 29, 2007\n\n(first surgical specialist to reside in Chilliwack)\n\nDr. Albert H. Phelps was born and educated in Toronto in the midst of the depression era. He began working as a tool and die maker, saving money to enter the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine, graduating in 1947. He spent his entire medical career serving the citizens of British Columbia.\n\nIn 1948 he entered general practice at Youbou, Vancouver Island. In 1950 he enrolled in the University of British Columbia’s general surgical residency program at Vancouver General Hospital and in 1954 began his surgical practice in Chilliwack, where he continued to practice until his retirement in 1989. For eight years he was Chilliwack’s only general surgeon, working alone, often day and night with only rare opportunities for relief.\n\nAlbert was a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and the American College of Surgeons. He was a member of the Canadian Association of General Surgeons and the British Columbia Surgical Society. In 1988 he was honored by his peers with a Senior Membership in the Canadian Medical Association.\n\nDr. Phelps was dedicated to improving his community. Albert was a 47 year member of the Chilliwack Rotary Club. He was President in 1964, and was honoured to be awarded a Paul Harris Fellow. His special interest was the Rotary Student Exchange Program, hosting 15 students over the years. He was a founding member of the Chilliwack Golf and Country Club as well as a life member of the Chilliwack Museum and Historical Society. He had a life long commitment as an Elder in the Community of Christ, and was Pastor of the local congregation from 1990-1995.\n\nAl or Uncle Buddy, as he was affectionately known, died peacefully in his home at 6:00 AM on Thursday November 29, 2007, at the age of 87. He maintained his mental capabilities until the end, and welcomed visitors graciously. There was a sense of peace and tranquility in the home. Many thanks to Hospice Services, Dr. Howard Bright, Dr. Ron Bull, Susan Greathouse and Karyn Bryson for their care and support.\n\nAlbert will be lovingly remembered by his family: Wife - Linda Phelps, Chilliwack Daughter - Susan Phelps, Ottawa Daughter - Barbara Eveleigh, Tsawwassen and husband David, Nathan (16), Ryan (13) Son - Stuart Phelps, Revelstoke and wife Lorna, Andrew (21), Brendan (18), Meighan (16) Son - Christopher Phelps, Langley and wife Erica, Amelia (4)\n\nAlbert is survived by his two sisters Margery Mills and Evelyn Sharkey of Toronto, nieces and nephews and many special Rotary exchange students.\n\nAlbert lived his life by the tenets of Psalm 139. He will be greatly missed by family and friends, but all can be grateful for having been touched by his spirit.\n\nAlbert requested no funeral or memorial service. There will be a private family gathering at a later date. Donations may be made in his name to:\n\nCommunity of Christ\n\nYouth Camping Fund\n\nc/o Community of Christ CWM\n\n6415 Ranchview Drive NW"
