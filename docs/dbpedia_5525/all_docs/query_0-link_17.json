        "text": "Canadian of the Month May 2024\n\nKristian Bruun\n\nActor\n\nKristian Bruun was born in Toronto, Canada and has been seen on stages and screens around the world. The classically trained actor was recently seen as a series regular in “The Recruit” (Netflix), as well as “Carter” (Hallmark Channel), “Departure” (Peacock), and “Avocado Toast” (Out TV) for which he received a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the Canadian Screen Awards in 2021. He is also well known for his work on the award winning series “Orphan Black” (BBC America) and “Murdoch Mysteries” (CBC/Ovation). Other TV appearances include recurring roles on “Snowpiercer” (AMC), “Family Law” (The CW Network), “The Handmaid’s Tale” (Hulu), “11.22.63” (Hulu) and “Impulse” (YouTube Premium). Film credits include the bloody horror-action-comedy “Ready or Not” (Fox Searchlight), “Life” (eOne), “Tammy’s Always Dying” (J.A. Productions), “The Go-Getters” (Northern Banner), “Mary Goes Round” (Wildling Pictures), as well as the Nunavut-set sci-fi film “Slash/Back” (Scythia Films). He is a graduate of Valley Forge Military Academy, Queen’s University, and the George Brown Theatre School. Kristian is a citizen of Canada and Finland, and now resides in Los Angeles.\n\nYou have lived in Toronto, Pennsylvania, Los Angeles, Germany and England. Is there a favourite place, or quality of each that you miss?\n\nI always miss Berlin. Easily the most fascinating city I've lived in (but certainly not the prettiest). It's the city I long to go back to the most. I don't claim to feel cool enough to be able to say I belonged there, but in terms of cities to be a fly on the wall in, you can get no better than Berlin. I really enjoy being able to get lost somewhere new and just people watch (and take a million photos). As for things I miss in some other cities? London: Borough Market, the tube and pour-over coffee from Monmouth Coffee. Toronto: the food; it's truly the most international food city in the world. Hey. I love food.\n\nWhy and how did attending Valley Forge Military Academy prepare you for being an actor?\n\nValley Forge was high school for me - and certainly not your average high school experience. The school had an amazing military music program at the time, and I was there on a music scholarship for trumpet. VF taught me how to roll with the punches (sometimes literally). It gave me the thick skin needed to survive as an actor. All the critiques, and rejection, and constant evaluation that my job requires, I got used to it there. It was also a great place to learn improv comedy. I was a short, round thirteen year old when I went there and I wasn't big enough to defend myself. I saw how the smaller funny kids survived by using their wits. If a large upper classman is about to beat you up, if you can make him laugh, he'll punch the guy next to you instead. It was like Lord of the Flies, but somehow I survived unscathed and even excelled there. So much so I almost joined the Canadian army as an infantry officer instead of becoming an actor, but that's another story...\n\nOne of your most famous roles was Donnie the quirky husband in Orphan Black. How did that role change your career?\n\nI feel like that role put me on the world stage. At that point in my career I was hoping for something that expanded beyond Canada to give me the confidence to move to LA, and Orphan Black did just that. It's the role that I'm still the most well known for and I'll get recognized from it in the strangest places while travelling. I was recently in South Korea for work and the customs officer recognized me from it. She got all flustered and then I got flustered (I'm always flustered at customs to begin with), and then we both started blushing! I feel so lucky I was a part of OB. It holds a very special place in my Canadian heart.\n\nBeing based in Los Angeles, you must often travel for shoots. Do you love traveling, or would you rather get to film where you live?\n\nI love it. LA is a beast of a city and it has taken me a really long time to learn to like it. That said, I appreciate breaks from it, and usually when I need to escape the most I luckily book a job elsewhere. Then when I'm away I start to miss LA and by the time I wrap I'm ready to come home. I definitely see LA as home now. I sometimes feel guilty saying that because I miss Toronto. My mum raised me to be a curious world traveler, so if someone wants to pay me to travel? Sign me up!\n\nWhat projects are you working on, or have coming up that people should know about?\n\n\"The Recruit\", Season 2 on Netflix! It should be out later this year or in early 2025. And Seasons 3 & 4 of \"Snowpiercer\" on AMC in 2025.\n\nBeing both Canadian and Finnish, are there foods you love the most from each country?\n\nCanada: Get ready for the most stereotypical answer ever. Maple Syrup. I always have a bottle of it in my fridge. I use it instead of granulated sugar. There is no beating it. It is the ONLY sweetener I need. And I ALWAYS make sure my maple syrup is from Canada. I ain't buying that Vermont shit! They'd take my citizenship away.\n\nFinland: Black licorice. I used to hate it as a kid, but as an adult I've fallen in love with all the weird salty black licorice from all the Scandinavian countries. Salmiakki? Yes please, Kiitos!! I'm also part Norwegian, so I'm adding that weird smooth brown cheese they have: Gjetost. Try it on some rye crackers with a spot of raspberry jam. Heavenly. It's strange but so good. I love bringing it to dinner parties for people to argue over. It's divisive.\n\nWhen you aren’t working, what do you enjoy most about living in LA?\n\nThe sunsets! Golden hour in LA is so dreamy and consistent. No wonder people moved here to make movies! Must be the smog. My second passion is photography (don't get me started on my camera addiction), and this city is very photogenic. The sunlight, weather, architecture, geographical diversity, the people from all over the world? There's a reason why movies set in LA are so iconic. This city is quite the character.\n\nCanadian of the Month April 2024\n\nJennifer Staton\n\nChief Operating Officer at FusionTECH\n\nJennifer Staton was born in Pointe-Claire, QC and eventually ended up in Burlington, ON. She graduated from Sheridan College where she earned her Marketing Degree and was awarded the Sheridan Scholar designation. Sports has always been in her blood, she even caddied on the Canadian PGA Tour for a full season before moving to Daytona Beach with then husband who was a professional golfer. She spent 12 years at NASCAR in Phoenix before moving to LA to work for the LA Dodgers and then The Wallace Firm which negotiated a LA Rams partnership.\n\nShe is now the EVP, Chief Operating Officer at FusionTECH, which helps venues, sports teams, leagues, and promoters maximize their technology in sports, entertainment and developments. With over 20 years of experience, she is skilled in developing and implementing creative marketing platforms to enhance a brand’s impact. These ideas include integrations with the league, team, athletes, broadcast & radio partners, merchandise affiliates, concessionaires, and other events.\n\nTell us about what it's like to be a female caddie on the Canadian PGA Tour?\n\nThe best part about being a Canadian PGA Tour caddie was the ability to see the country. We started on the west coast in Victoria, and over the summer made our way east. Most golfers drove the circuit and had family members or friends caddie to save on costs. Life on the road isn’t as glamorous as you’d expect. Room sharing was common. If you were lucky, you got to stay with a local host family that would feed you and you could use their washer & dryer. You would not believe how hard it is to find a decent laundromat! Tim Hortons was a diet staple and whatever food the tournament would provide at the golf course was graciously accepted.\n\nThere were a handful of female caddies. Between the golfers, caddies and tournament staff you had a traveling family. We supported each other and would share the best spots to go for inexpensive dinners, the cleanest laundromats, and swap host family stories.\n\nCaddieing on the Canadian PGA Tour was an experience I will never forget that provided valuable first hand insights for my eventual career in sports.\n\nWhat brought you to LA?\n\nAfter spending 12 years at NASCAR in Daytona Beach, FL & Phoenix, AZ. I was ready for a career change. The question was - now what? My partner was leading the technology integration at SoFi Stadium during the construction phase and had been traveling extensively from Phoenix to LA. As the stadium was nearing completion, we decided it was time to make the move. I didn’t have a job plan and took a leap of faith!\n\nYou worked for NASCAR and for the LA Dodgers. How did you get your start working in professional sports and what did your day-to-day look like?\n\nI grew up following and playing sports. I loved the team dynamic, the competition and the community. It wasn’t until I caddied on the Canadian PGA Tour that I realized you can have a career in sports. I believe that everything happens for a reason. Upon graduating from Sheridan College with a Business Degree, I moved to Florida. My neighbor was the Head of Sales for NASCAR. I shared my resume, had an interview that week and was hired. What I quickly learned is your network is your most valuable asset. Early on I was lucky to have mentors and vowed to pay it forward. I currently mentor youth and females interested in the industry.\n\nIn sports there is never a “typical” day. There are so many factors at play:\n\n- Is your team in season or off season?\n\n- Is it a game day?\n\n- Is your team winning or losing?\n\n- Does your team play in a new venue, or older one?\n\n- What are the core responsibilities of your department?\n\nI was a part of the corporate sponsorships team. We were responsible for securing large corporate partnerships (millions of dollars annually) and bringing our partner’s activations to life in a meaningful way. If we met or exceed a partner’s objectives they were more likely to renew or even grow their partnership. While all sports have an “off-season” there is limited downtime. We were always preparing for what’s next.\n\nWhat advice do you have for people looking to enter into marketing or partnerships in professional sports or entertainment?\n\nFor anyone thinking a career in sports is easy or glamorous, it is not! While they are perks, be prepared…\n\n…To work long hours including nights, weekends and holidays. For 10 years I never got to enjoy a July 4th holiday celebration.\n\n…For below average salaries. This is an especially true early in your career.\n\n…To roll up your sleeves and do whatever it takes. Those that survive and thrive are the go-getters. Take initiative, ask questions, and be knowledgeable about what is going on in the industry.\n\n…To compete and stand out. Most entry level positions receive hundreds of applicants.\n\nTell us about what you do right now and what's next?\n\nI am currently the Chief Operating Officer at FusionTECH, a boutique Sports & Entertainment Technology Business Consulting Firm. We are based in Los Angeles and have team members across the U.S. We help venues, teams and developers monetize and maximize their technology stack. Technology is vital to the fan experience and a cohesive technology strategy is the key to success.\n\nLA has become a sports destination. I was lucky enough to attend Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium and witness the LA Rams triumphant victory. In addition to LA’s numerous men’s & women’s professional sports teams and impressive venues, upcoming sports highlights include:\n\n- Opening of the Intuit Dome, the $2B new home of the LA Clippers\n\n- Eight total matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup\n\n- 2026 NBA All Star\n\n- 2026 U.S. Women’s Open Championship\n\n- Super Bowl LXI\n\n- The 2028 Olympic & Paralympic Games\n\n- 131st U.S. Open Championship\n\nThis is an exciting time for sports in LA. I hope to see you at a sporting event soon!\n\nMarch 2024 Canadian of the Month\n\nMargot Ross\n\nCurator, Gallerist\n\nA curator, gallerist, producer, and art management consultant with nearly two decades of experience, Margot Ross is based in Los Angeles. She works internationally with galleries, contemporary art spaces, museums, and governmental organizations. Working with artists in a multitude of disciplines, Margot has overseen a diverse array of projects - art exhibitions, video installations, events, and book projects focusing on contemporary art. She studied art and international relations in Vancouver, London, Paris, Belgium, and Moscow, earning a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Political Science and International Relations from the University of British Columbia and a Master of Arts in International Relations from the University of Westminster in Paris.\n\nGrowing up in Canada, what drew you or inspired your love of art?\n\nI was raised in Deep Cove in North Vancouver and grew up surrounded by artists in my family. Also, my grandfather was an art collector. I worked at a local art gallery in high school and then studied abroad in Belgium and Paris, where I worked and received my Master’s degree. All of these experiences deepened my love of art and led me to be Director of an art gallery in Montreal and then in LA.\n\nBeing so involved in the art world, are you an artist yourself\n\nI’ve always been into photography. Now I just take pictures with my iPhone, but I miss working in the darkroom and would like to start using a proper camera again!\n\nWhat brought you to LA?\n\nI came to LA initially to work with a French artist and ended up consulting on a gallery project. I flew back and forth from Montreal for two years before making the move to LA.\n\nAny upcoming events or shows you’d like to tell us about?\n\nI just opened an exhibition during Frieze week entitled Northern Exposure, featuring eight Canadian Galleries and 25 artists. Northern Exposure is the inaugural Visual Arts program focused on contemporary Canadian artists and galleries launched by the Consulate General of Canada in Los Angeles, as part of the Canadian Creative Accelerator (CCA). The galleries were selected by a jury of art professionals in Canada and the US. I worked on the project with LA-based writer and curator Michael Slenske.\n\nThe exhibition is incredible and I definitely recommend people go check it out. The exhibition runs through March 21, 2024 at Praz-Delavallade, located at 6150 Wilshire Boulevard, near LACMA.\n\nWhat is the art scene in LA like these days?\n\nIt is growing! Los Angeles is known primarily for the entertainment industry, however the city now boasts an expanding art market. In the past year, over 10 major gallery spaces have opened in LA while local galleries have been expanding (many opening second locations to cover the East and Westside). Many leading galleries from New York and Europe have expanded in LA including Hauser & Wirth, Galerie Perrotin, James Fuentes Gallery, Half Gallery, Lisson, Pace Gallery, Shrine and Sargent’s Daughter, making Los Angeles a new epicenter of the art world.\n\nWho is your favourite artist right now?\n\nI discovered so many artists working on the Northern Exposure exhibition but I was particularly drawn to a massive tapestry from the 1970s entitled, Life on the Land that was handmade by Elizabeth Angrnaqquaq Quiayuq, an Inuk textile artist. I love the painterly quality of her work. The hand-embroidered felt tapestries depict double-headed birds and flying figures with human heads that represent transformations, where shaman spirits can shapeshift into animal bodies and vice versa.\n\nAny advice you can give Canadian artists trying to break into the US market?\n\nThis is a difficult question to answer. A lot of Canadian artists break into US markets through their Canadian galleries, or by moving to the US or going to school in the US. I think it depends on the individual artist and the medium they work in.\n\nFebruary 2024 Canadian of the Month\n\nAndrea Bolley\n\nThe6Mom\n\nYou are an accomplished painter, AGO professor and model. How did you get your start and what inspires you?\n\nWhen I was at the University Of Windsor studying for a BFA, I was fortunate to be picked up by the Pollack Gallery. At the time there were only two contemporary galleries in Toronto and not many women artists in them. Having this opportunity led to teaching at the Art Gallery Of Ontario.\n\nA little story for you. Years ago, a couple bought four of my paintings for their boardroom. It turned out to be Epitome Pictures. It was Linda Schuyler, the creator of Degrassi. We became very good friends and so I used to watch Aubrey (artist \"Drake\") when he acted in Degrassi.\n\nI love fashion . . . not long ago, I was dancing at an event and I was approached by a modeling agency and asked if I modeled. At the time, I didn't. This turned out to be Elite Models and I am now an Advanced Style model.\n\nHow did you get the name \"The 6 Mom\"?\n\nI have been an artist in Toronto ... \"the6ix\" as Drake calls it, since 1997. During the years I have tried to support other artists in all the fields. I have met many of them, like Director X, Kardinal, Greata Constantine, Snoop Dogg, Christian Louboutin, 4Korners, etc. and of course, Drake.\n\nThe6Mom has been the name Drake and the OVO crew - Preme, Baka, TV Gucci, OVO Mark and Chubs have called me. How it went viral is that when I went to say hello at a Raptors game to my friend 4Korners, the DJ for the Raptors, over the microphone he said, \"and the6mom is in the house!\".\n\nHow do you split your time between Toronto and LA and why?\n\nMy time in Toronto or LA is determined by what art, music, film or modeling comes up for me.\n\nWhat are you dancing to these days?\n\nI follow certain DJs to the venues they are performing at. So dance to Hip Hop, R&B, Funk, Pop, Techno but not Heavy Metal as I'm not good in a mosh pit ....let's hear it for OvoMark - Nightowl Sound, Loud Luxury, Starting from Scratch, 4korners, DJ Franny, Steve Aoki, Snoop Dog, DJ Moss, DJ Nitrane.\n\nWhat's next for you?\n\nI'm painting for a one woman show in LA. I'm looking forward to seeing the Coi Leray music video I'm in. I am currently in a short film called Exquisite Things that's traveling the Short Film Festival circuit in the US and Europe.\n\nI'm looking forward to more Elite Model Fashion Shoots. And, dancing, dancing, dancing!!! Everyday is a gift.\n\nJanuary 2024 Canadian of the Month\n\nRob Gentile\n\nChef, Stella West Hollywood\n\nA first generation Canadian, born to Italian parents, Chef Rob Gentile’s earliest memories are from his grandmother’s garden and kitchen. As a boy he learned that food was sacred within his family who for generations grew their own produce, raised animals, cured meat, fermented grapes and preserved anything possible. The skills he learned at home in his family’s kitchen eventually led to his first restaurant job at the age of 13. Rob inherently knew that his career would revolve around food and after working in restaurants throughout his teenage years; he entered George Brown’s Culinary School. By 18 he found his first role in a professional kitchen at North 44 under celebrated Chef Mark McEwan. After 10 years of moving up the ranks from line-cook to Chef de Cuisine at McEwan’s top restaurants, Chef Rob was ready for a new challenge. He soon joined Peter Tsebelis and Gus Giazitzidis of The King Street Food Company to take the helm of Buca. The restaurant opened in 2009 and quickly became one of Toronto’s most sought-after dining destinations and is considered one of Canada’s best\n\nWhat inspired you to be a chef?\n\nWell, since I was a little kid, I just adored food. Spending a lot of time with my Italian Nona exposed me to her wonderful cooking and the beauty of her garden. Our family, having immigrated from Italy to North York, Ontario continued to embrace the same culinary traditions. We grew and preserved everything, even curing our own meats in the basement. I was so passionate about food that instead of watching cartoons, I'd tune into cooking shows as a child. When it came time to talk about work, I remember having a heart-to-heart with my mom when I was just 12. She told me that whatever I choose to do for a living, I should make sure I truly love it, as it's something I'll be doing for the rest of my life. In that moment, it became clear to me: my future had to involve a profession with food.\n\nWhat advice do you have for people who are cooking hobbyist but thinking about going pro?\n\nJust like my mom once asked me, I'd ask you the same: Do you really love it? Home cooking and professional cooking are like two different worlds. Becoming a professional chef requires years of learning and hands-on experience. Plus, there are various paths within the professional cooking realm. My advice? Do your homework, make sure you're diving into something you truly love, and understand what you're getting yourself into.\n\nHow do you handle the critiquing of your food?\n\nDealing with criticism can be tough in the cooking world. Honest feedback is crucial. While hearing friends rave about your restaurant is nice, it doesn't always help you grow. Embracing honest opinions is the key to constant improvement—whether it's about leadership, food, or the overall dining experience. The goal is to get better every day, one step at a time. This mindset should never stop.\n\nIt’s Sunday night at Casa Gentile. What are you making for dinner?\n\nSundays at home are all about simple grilling. We usually opt for a piece of meat or fish. Living close to The Joint, which specializes in dry-aged fish, is a bonus. A good piece of fish, some veggies from the local market, and a fresh salad make a perfect meal for us, at least four times a week.\n\nWhat brought you to LA?\n\nLA became my destination specifically to open Stella. My business partner, Janet Zuccarini, reached out during the pandemic, urging me to visit and explore. For a chef, being surrounded by such incredible ingredients is truly magical. We signed the lease at 8899 Beverly in 2022 and are gearing up to open soon (February 2024).\n\nCan you tell us about your new restaurant and what dish are you most excited to share with LA?!\n\nIt's hard to pick just one dish from our wide range of Italian specialties. We'll have fresh salads, vegetables, pizza, pasta, and, of course, meat and fish from our wood grill. If I had to choose a favorite, it would be the Su Filindeu pasta. Considered the rarest pasta globally, it's a Sardinian hand-stretched pasta woven over a basket, then dried and cracked. I had the incredible opportunity to learn how to make it during a dream food trip to Sardinia in 2021.\n\nDecember 2023 Canadian of the Month\n\nMatt Smiley\n\nArtist, Filmmaker\n\nMatt Smiley is a versatile artist and filmmaker celebrated for his vibrant and thematic paintings, crafted through a unique blend of automatic writings, vivid colors, and imaginative characters. His artistic journey extends beyond the canvas, delving into impactful documentary filmmaking and showcasing a commitment to social causes.\n\nIn 2014, Smiley made a significant mark with the direction of \"Highway of Tears,\" a documentary shedding light on the missing women along Highway 16 in northern British Columbia. Narrated by international television star Nathan Fillion (\"Castle\"), the film premiered at the TIFF Human Rights Watch Film Festival, earning widespread acclaim and multiple awards while screening globally.\n\nVenturing into the art world, Smiley unveiled his first solo exhibition in 2017, titled \"Dreams Fizzle into Space.\" The showcase featured a 32-piece Warholian \"Smiley\" Soup Can collection, establishing him as an artist with a penchant for bold concepts. Subsequently, in 2018, Smiley's \"Lessons in History\" graced the LA Art Show, followed by exhibitions at The Other Art Fair Presented by Saatchi Art in Brooklyn and the prestigious Aspen Institute.\n\nAmong his standout works is the mural \"The Blocs of Love,\" an Instagram sensation located in downtown Los Angeles. Building on this success, Smiley presented \"Dear Diary…\" in Hollywood, captivating audiences with his ability to seamlessly blend narrative and visual art.\n\nIn 2019, the iconic Mondrian Hotel's Magic Box Gallery hosted Smiley's exhibition, showcasing his evolving artistic narrative. Parallel to his artistic pursuits, Smiley directed \"For Love,\" a documentary centered on Indigenous Child Welfare in Canada. Narrated by the iconic singer-songwriter Shania Twain, the film found its platform on Netflix in Canada and Amazon in the United States & UK.\n\nThroughout his career, Smiley has exhibited alongside luminaries such as Ed Ruscha, James Turrell, Shepard Fairey (Obey), Mel Bochner, Punk Me Tender and many more, solidifying his place in the contemporary art scene. Beyond his artistic endeavors, Smiley has consistently supported various charitable causes, including Human Rights Watch, UNICEF, Race to Erase, Phase One, Wearable Arts, and LIFT Communities. Today, his artwork is represented by Denis Bloch Fine Art in Beverly Hills, a testament to the enduring impact of his creative vision.\n\nWhy did you decide to make For Love?\n\nI’ve been focused on Indigenous stories for a little over nine years now. After my first documentary “Highway of Tears,” I started to take a more active role on how I could best impact the communities I was visiting across Canada, not only by sharing their stories, but by working with my friends to help change policies in Canada to help protect women & girls. That work opened my eyes to many other issues First Nation, Metis and Inuit communities were facing. Then, through my friendship and collaborations with Mary Teegee (Deputy Chief of Takla Landing, within the Carrier Nation in northern BC) over the years, I got a glimpse into the beauty of Indigenous culture that was starting to really thrive in Canada.\n\nThe initial decision to make the “For Love” was by a special invitation from various communities across Canada that was orchestrated by Mary (Teegee). At the time, I didn’t really think I was the right person to tell the story and wasn’t planning on making more documentaries. But, the more Mary and I continued to dialogue about some of the work she and other leaders across the country were doing. I started to picture how we could collaborate to tell this story that was very dear to Mary’s heart. I knew it wouldn't be an easy task to tell this vast story. It was a challenge that I welcomed on many fronts! Thankfully we got a lot of help from so many amazing communities across the country!\n\nTell us what it's like to direct and produce a documentary and what tips you have for our members?\n\nThe number one rule/tip is passion. On “For Love” I gave up whatever I was focused on at the time to dedicate myself to telling that story. It was a massive undertaking, as it wasn’t just covering one particular storyline, but weaving an intricate web of stories across the entire country. That wasn't an easy mountain to climb. You have to understand the issues communities are facing, but also try to be as objective as possible.\n\nThe second rule that I pride myself on is to be as flexible as possible with your expectations. As the director and producer, you need to have a clear vision of what you want to achieve, but also be extremely adaptable to change and open to people’s ideas. A documentary for me is a collaborative process. The film isn’t yours. You need to be able to give up some of your darlings in order to tell a story that will impact a global audience.\n\nThe third rule that I have is to research until there isn’t a stone unturned. At least on the subjects I cover, it’s critical to cast a vast net of information in order to see a subject from all angles.\n\nWhat inspires you and how do you feed your creativity?\n\nEverything around me fuels my creativity! It’s a bit of a pinball in my brain at times, but I’ve learned over the years to zero in on projects that fuel my heart and creativity. There’s rarely a moment where I don’t have a sketchbook in my hands, coming up with ideas. The thing I’ve been most passionate about is painting. There’s a million ideas brewing in my brain. I wish I could get them all done. A sunset, a sunrise and any small mundane moment in my daily life gives me inspiration. I made a commitment to live a creative life long ago. I don’t care where I rest my head, as long as I have crayons and paper nearby.\n\nOther artists and friends certainly inspire me too!\n\nTell us about your current exhibit?\n\nMy current exhibit “Work in Progress: Emotions” is now open to the public at the 1 Hotel in West Hollywood. I’m truly honored to be the first Artist in Residence at the hotel. Our opening was such a special night and I’m happy that everyone can now enjoy a few moments of happiness walking around the gallery space.\n\nThe exhibit is focused on emotions, with a heavy emphasis on the usage of smiley symbolism, which serves as the perfect tool for my creative emotional exploration. While often associated with happiness, the smiley face has a spectrum of emotions that it can relay to people. From the simple arc of a grin to the subtleties within the eyes, each smiley face represents a snapshot of our emotional life. Or mine at least. I used to be very uncomfortable with my last name. There’s a high bar that is set to constantly be happy. I’ve learned now through my art process, that we can have a range of emotions and many of them lead to happiness. I hope that’s something people walk out understanding when they visit. And now that we've finally opened the doors to the public at the 1 Hotel, it’s been a blessing to see how people interpret the work and follow the story I was trying to tell. Or rather, the emotional rollercoaster ride my heart takes me on. I’ve always been a shy cat in an extroverted body. It’s really the beginning of sharing who I am. Unapologetically me. Lead with your heart and see where the journey takes you.\n\nWhat's next for you?\n\nI'm focused on our exhibit at the 1 Hotel in West Hollywood for the next month. There's so many amazing people flowing through the hotel that it makes everyday a pure joy to come in and explore. I'm here constantly now. I love meeting with everyone and hearing their stories and we've only just gotten started.\n\nI also have a bunch of art shows coming up in 2024. I had taken a break from exhibiting for three years while I was working on “For Love”. I did release a few pieces publicly. One for a special group show hosted by a dear friend, Punk Me Tender and a mini-series at Level 8 downtown that was opened by the Houston Brothers. I was very touched to share some of my work in their new downtown LA hotspot. They create some of the greatest experiences for nightlife and push the boundaries of what can be done to move the bar forward downtown.\n\nI’m uber excited to start sharing some of the collections I’ve been privately working on with the world. There’s a few cool shows in the works happening here in the U.S., in Canada and in Europe! I’m also working on a few fun art projects with brands that I’m excited to share soon!\n\nWhat advice do you have for people who are trying to be successful as an artist?\n\nNever give up on believing in yourself. Easier said than done.\n\nMy creative career has had a few shifts throughout my life. While my grandparents were artists, I never imagined a life as a ‘painter’. I always thought I would be solely focused on film, but it was in my blood and something that I can’t escape. I love it. It's what gives me purpose and what drives me to wake up in the morning.\n\nThere’s no golden rule outside of putting in the work. You need to put in your 10,000 hours and be willing to sacrifice everything to succeed. Everything.\n\nHow do you stay connected to Canada?\n\nHaving spent the last 20 years in LA, I’ve always kept in close contact with my friends that I grew up with in Montreal. I’ve also built an infrastructure of great friends here that are from various parts of Canada. Your organization in particular has always led me to meet great Canadians and stay in tune with Canada.\n\nPrior to filming “Highway of Tears”, I had done my best to escape Canada for personal reasons, but as fate would have it, when I returned, the blessings it has brought me over the years have kept me grounded and fueled my dreams. I’ve been lucky enough now that I have had the opportunity to travel across the country. Over the last few years, I’ve been to every province and territory. It’s opened my eyes not only to the vast beauty of Canada, but always the heavy load of work that we have ahead of us to ensure that not only our beautiful resources are here for future generations, but make sure all children have equal opportunities for a prosperous life.\n\nI’m still also very connected to many friends across the country and thankful to now be collaborating with storytellers across the country as I’m producing a new mini-series of short docs. I’ve been lucky to grow up on film productions. I’m in a happy place in my life now where I can help guide filmmakers to achieve their goals and create their own stories dear to their hearts. This particular series of mini docs are all focused on Hope & Strength of Indigenous Women across Canada. We have a lot of big announcements about those projects coming up soon!!!!! I can’t wait to share those!!!!\n\nWhat made you want to be a member of Canadians Abroad?\n\nI was lucky to be born in Canada. My childhood was unconventional, but the community at large was responsible for creating the person I am today. There’s a saying that former President Clinton had talked about in a speech years ago about his travels to Africa that really impacted me. The phrase was “Ubuntu” which roughly translates to \"I am because we are”. I truly believe that I am because of our community at large. So many Canadians here in LA have impacted my life and career in meaningful ways. One prime recent example is a dear friend of mine, Anna, who worked for Air Canada. I had met her through Canadian consulate events and Canadians Abroad. Not only was she a dear friend, she played an instrumental role in ensuring that all Air Canada flights (domestically) played “For Love” along with Netflix. She was a true champion for everyone she cared for and had a deep soft spot for children. I wish she was still around with us to see the impact she’s had on people’s lives. Whenever I fly back to Canada, I book Air Canada. Anna is one of the prime reasons I only book on that airline, but I now refer to it as “Air Anna”. She should be graced with a few dedicated wings. Long story short, Canadians Abroad is a helpful community that is rooted in Canadian values. It’s impacted my life in positive ways.\n\nNovember 2023 Canadian of the Month\n\nJennifer Candy-Sullivan\n\nActor, Comedian\n\nJennifer was born in Toronto, on February 3rd. She spent most of her youth growing up in Los Angeles with summer vacations to their family farm just North of Toronto. She attended Loyola Marymount University, and graduated as a Theatre Arts Major. After that, she moved to Chicago to work and study at Second City Chicago. It took only two winters when she decided to move back to Sunny California! At that point, Jennifer really started to build her acting resume.\n\nJennifer is the host of COUCH CANDY, where she chats with alumni of Second City, SCTV and many more amazing talents about comedy, life, and their favorite candy! She has worked on a variety of tv shows & films. You might have even seen her face on that one commercial after your favorite show! Jennifer loves to spend time with her family and paint when she has free time. She has studied with the late Bill Howey and Ian Tucker. Acting is her passion and is in her blood, she is so fortunate and happy that she is able to do this for a living (well until this strike is over!).\n\nWhat inspired you to become an actor and comedian?\n\nI have always loved to make people laugh. I wanted to be a marine biologist when I was younger, like every other girl in the 80’s. But that required too much science and math and those were not my strongest subjects! So I decided I can always just play one in a movie! I also grew up in a family where an education in \"Comedy\" was a given! I grew up watching Faulty Towers, Monty Python and SCTV. The 80’s and 90’s was one of the best times for classic comedies in my opinion.\n\nWhat is something that people don't know about you?\n\nI actually love to do dramatic stuff as well. People always just assume I only do comedy!\n\nHow do you stay connected to Canada?\n\nI try so hard to make it back up to Toronto once a year. It has been hard with the last few years, but finally got to make it up at the beginning of October! It was perfect timing too as we got to attend the 100th anniversary game of the Toronto Argonauts! It was such a great time with my family. My son is a dual citizen, so that makes me happy. I also still have a lot of extended family up there. Even though we live in Los Angeles, I am CANADIAN!\n\nWhat is one of your favorite memories of your Dad?\n\nThere are so many great memories! You will just have to wait and watch for the doc ; - )\n\nIs there any inside scoop you can tell us on the John Candy documentary from Colin Hanks, Ryan Reynolds and with the support of your mother, your brother and yourself?\n\nSuper excited to be starting this project with Mom, Rose and Brother, Chris! We have a great group leading the way with Colin Hanks Directing, Company Name and Ryan Reynolds with Maximum Effort as part of the producing team.\n\nAny other projects you're excited to tell us about once the strike ends?\n\nI cannot wait till this strike is over! BUT it is so necessary. Other than the documentary, it's been slow, but looking for things to pick up in the new year! I'm loving being a mom right now, so I get to spend so much time with our son who will be 5 years old this month. It's the best!\n\nI am also on the board of an amazing Chicago-based charity called Letters Charity, where 100% of our donations go to support families experiencing poverty. We have two great events coming up in December in Chicago and Los Angeles! For more information, you can go to www.unconditionalgiving.org and follow us on Instagram @LettersCharity\n\nOctober 2023 Canadian of the Month\n\nRahnuma Panthaky\n\nActor, Writer, Producer\n\nIf Tracee Ellis Ross and Cher had a love child Rahnuma would be it.\n\nShe is currently the voice behind Rukhmini, one of the leads opposite Jack Black and James Hong in DreamWorks Kung Fu Panda: The Dragon Knight currently in its 3rd season. Born in Montreal, raised in T.O. she got her start on camera in the O.G. Degrassi and has done pretty much every Canadian show there was before moving to LA.\n\nShe was chosen by The Casting Society of America as one of the top 20 actors to watch. Rahnuma’s been blessed to share the screen with peeps like Alfred Molina, Tony Shalhoub, Gary Sinise, LL Cool J (#lifetimecrush #youngermewasfreakingout #dreamcometrue!!), opposite Sofia Vergara, Julie Bowen, and Ed O’Neill in Modern Family where she recurred for four seasons and other really freaking awesome people.\n\nShe’s a secret shower rockstar, Idris Elba and Classic House music lover and her special skills include driving cars full of screaming kids, freezing her nuts off at hockey arenas (guess you can’t take the Canuck outta her) and pretending she knows how to cook.\n\nYou can find out more about her at: https://www.rahnumapanthaky.com/\n\nWhen did you first get the acting bug, and realize you wanted to make a career of it?\n\nI kind of fell into acting in high school. I originally auditioned for a school for the performing arts in dance but bombed the audition. Hard. Like I totally blanked on the choreography, decided to just do jazz runs for a minute straight before they pressed stop on my music and said, “that’s enough,” kinda hard. But I really wanted to go to that high school so I re-auditioned for the drama program and got in.\n\nBack then I always thought I’d be a lawyer. Until I had to do a mock trial in a grade 11 law class and bombed hard…(I’m seeing a pattern here). But hey, at least now I get to play lawyers on TV!\n\nIt wasn’t till theatre school where I truly got bit by the bug after doing 1837: The Farmer’s Revolt…every teenager’s dream play. I originally thought I’d be a drama teacher but once I got the bug, decided I had to give this a go and did every free theatre show I could to build up a resume and get an agent.\n\nAs a working actor in Canada, did you always dream about moving to LA?\n\nHonestly, I didn’t when I first started out. My focus at that time was theatre. I wanted to be on all the main stages in Canada, and if I was lucky enough, in New York. But then I got an audition for a TV show called Blue Murder and booked the role. That was my first TV credit. I still remember the director, T.W. Peacocke, and the lead actress was Maria Del Mar. They were so kind and took me under their wing. I was so green and knew nothing about on camera acting. But they were so gracious and taught me the ropes. I got bit again and fell in love with being on set.\n\nWas moving to LA what you thought it would be?\n\nIs it ever what one thinks it’d be? My very first visit to LA I packed nothing but heels and fancy clothes cuz that’s what I thought everyone wore here. I quickly discovered that wasn’t the case and after the first day of blisters and sore feet, went to the nearest Target and bought some sneakers and jeans. I continued to come back and forth for pilot season etc., and I remember being in awe of everything. All these iconic places I had either heard about or seen on TV, I was actually seeing in person! But visiting LA is very different than living in LA (at least for me). Don’t get me wrong, I’m still in awe of these places but now I have to race by them on my way to school drop off / pick up or on the way to hockey rinks (#momlife). But on the plus side at least I’m rushing by with palm trees and sunshine in my rearview!\n\nBeing a SAG and ACTRA member, how has the strike affected you?\n\nOddly I actually found some comfort in the strike. Getting to walk and talk with my fellow actors and writers was kind of therapeutic. So much of what we do as actors is solo. Until we actually book the gig. Before the pandemic going to an in-person audition was also a way for you to reunite with friends you hadn’t seen in a while. But now with almost all auditions being on tape or via zoom it can be a bit isolating. The strike gave me an opportunity to be in community again…and get my steps in.\n\nWhat have you been doing to keep busy during the strike?\n\nYou mean besides driving to every ice arena in SoCal? You haven’t truly lived till you’ve been to the rink in Yorba Linda!\n\nWorkwise, I’m lucky because I also narrate audiobooks, and thankfully I have been able to keep busy with those. But I miss acting opposite human beings.\n\nYou are also a writer/producer; are there any projects you are excited about once the strike ends?\n\nMy writing partner and I have a few features we’ve been developing and I’m looking forward to getting those up and running.\n\nYou were a Cher impersonator, please elaborate!?\n\nDon’t judge. Mama had to find a way to pay for college. It wasn’t anything glamorous, it was usually going to corporate events and walking around with a Sonny impersonator roasting people and taking pics. Man am I grateful smart phones weren’t around back then!\n\nSeptember 2023 Canadian of the Month\n\nChef Jeffray D Gardner\n\nCo-Founder & Chocolatier, Marsatta Chocolate\n\nChef Jeffray D. Gardner, is LA's first bean-to-bar Chocolate Chef. Originally from Canada, he launched Marsatta Chocolate with his wife, Naomi Gardner, in 2003, with a focus on delivering the best chocolate experience in the world. In 2007, they launched their bean-to-bar chocolate, inspired by Chef Jeffray's heritage in Western Canada and French-Alsace region. This year, Marsatta Chocolate celebrates its 20th Anniversary with the launch of a flagship Experience Centre in Downtown Old Torrance.\n\nWhere are you from in Canada?\n\nOh jeez, that's a hard question because I've lived in so many different places in Canada! I was born in Saskatoon, but spent time in Calgary. I actually worked at the Stampede at one point in my life. But I spent a lot of time in Victoria, and that's where I truly consider home. That's where my family still resides.\n\nWhat brought you to California?\n\nIt was actually from my athletic background. I represented Western Canada in cycling, and when I got to an age, I had to choose between my first two loves: hockey and cycling. Like most Canadians, the allure of hockey propelled me to get involved in any way possible. I started to get involved in refereeing, and soon found myself rising to the top of refereeing professionally.\n\nI then came down to Los Angeles to support the LA Kings, and referee some early games. The proudest moment was refereeing the international games, that included some of the greats including Teemu Selanne and Eric Lindros.\n\nTake us from the world of hockey to being a chocolatier?\n\nAlthough I grew up in Western Canada, like most Canadians, my family immigrated here from overseas. My mother is from the Alsace region in France, which borders Germany, and my grandfather is Italian. As a child, I would often get these great chocolates from France. After spending some time over in France as a young adult, I loved the culinary expression that's possible in this craft. It's not unlike a beautiful deke, or a tic-tac-toe pass in hockey.\n\nI built my first chocolate company in Canada in the 90s, that focused on sugar free chocolates, and was actually in over 200 Walmarts in Canada. I've learned a lot from that experience, but I realized that there isn't a chocolate that rivaled the french-style chocolates I became accustomed to as a child.\n\nI met my wife on the Santa Monica pier, and she convinced me to bring european-style chocolates to North America. In 2003, Marsatta Chocolate was born, which took inspiration from my Alsace-French heritage, but emplaced by my Canadian upbringing. For me, it's inspiring to be able to give my clients an experience that is truly unrivaled. Not just in North America, but we think our approach to chocolate is competitive against the best-of-the-best from Europe.\n\nWhat do you love more, hockey or chocolate?\n\nI'm not going to lie, every time I see a puck, I think of bonbons. This is a really hard question, because hockey and chocolate is so ingrained in my life and even Marsatta. We had our ups and downs, but I will never forget the love, the gratitude, and the support from the LA Kings in our early years.\n\nWe even have a Marsatta Chocolate hockey team. We believe we're the 3rd most relevant hockey team in California (Sorry Shark fans...but I think you agree that last year's performance can't be considered \"hockey\"). And yes, we will gladly challenge the Hershey Bears for the best chocolate team on the ice.\n\nTell us about bean to bar and what that means?\n\nSo there are a lot of chocolatiers in the country. However, in this profession, you rarely make your own chocolate. For chocolatiers, you source industry chocolate that you then melt and turn into shapes.\n\nWhen I was in Canada, I was a chocolatier. But I always wanted to tinker, and change the profiles, and experiment to achieve a more flavorful bite. In the 2000's, I went to a prominent chocolate academy, and I asked if I could make my own chocolate. I might as well have asked him to flunk me...the professor said, \"No, YOU CANNOT MAKE YOUR OWN CHOCOLATE.\" He said that in all-caps, crazy! So the next day, I read every book I could find about making my own chocolate, rolled-up my sleeves, and started tinkering. After years and years of development, I launched my first bean-to-bar chocolate bar in 2007.\n\nBean-to-bar means we source the exact bean from Central and South America. We then roast the bean, winnow (which means to remove the outer shell), and grind the beans into a beautiful chocolate liquid that we internally call it, \"chocolate liquor.\" We then do some special secret recipe steps to turn that raw bean into a bar that is more than just a candy bar...and an edible journey of expressive flavor.\n\nOur whole focus is to make natural and authentic chocolate. That means no preservatives, and our philosophy is to unlock the most remarkable flavor in chocolate.\n\nTell us about the new Marsatta Chocolate store you opened in Old Torrance, and how people from around the US and Canada can buy your chocolates?\n\nWe are so thrilled to launch this new Experience Centre in Torrance!\n\nWe would like to invite any Canadians to come join us for a Tasting, and learn more about our chocolates. Our new store is in the heart of downtown, and can be found here.\n\nIf you are interested in an in-person Tasting Experience, let us know and take 40% off all in-store tastings with the code VIPTasting40. We love meeting new Canadians, and you get to learn more about our story, through the lens of chocolate. You also get to try our latest chocolate that is currently in beta, which is an 89% dark chocolate with infused maple syrup and garnished with Ocean salt that we harvested from the Ocean....it's absolutely lovely, and quintessentially Canadian.\n\nIf you buy online, you can visit our website HERE\n\nJust for you Canadians Abroad, take 20% off your first order with code: CanadiansAbroad20 And that offer is valid for everyone, including Toronto Maple Leafs fans. Can our chocolate help you get past the 2nd round of the playoffs? The short answer is yes.\n\nIn all our packaging you will find a hidden maple leaf, and we would be honoured to be your very own chocolate maker!\n\nAugust 2023 Canadian of the Month\n\nLisa Schimnowsky\n\nCEO / Co Founder of L8\n\nCBD Sparkling Beverages\n\nLisa is from a small town outside of Vancouver, and has lived in the US for 10 years. How’d she get here? She moved from Vancouver to Toronto in 2011 to further her career, and landed a job with a well known vegan protein company that was based in Vancouver but looking for people to go down to the US and spread the Canadian love. The company moved her to the US in 2013 and her first city was Washington, DC. While there, she met some people that would remain in her life for years to come, however her sights were set on something bigger. Lisa always wanted to be in one of America’s biggest cities, New York City or Los Angeles were ultimately where she saw herself thriving. One day while working she received a call from her manager who asked her to come out to LA and work one of her dream roles within the company. She moved to Los Angeles in 2014 and has remained here ever since! In 2018 she quit the job that changed her life to start something of her own. She is the CEO and Co-Founder of a CBD sparkling beverage company and her brand L8 can be found in Erewhon along with several other retailers. (Go check it out!)\n\nWhat made you want to start a CBD sparkling beverage company?\n\nI decided to start a CBD beverage company in order to fill a gap in the market. I personally have suffered from a lower back injury from when I was 22 years old while playing soccer and used prescription medication to help with the pain management. When CBD came on the market it was a new product and I wanted to explore a healthy natural alternative over taking prescription medication. I found CBD to help with my inflammation along with my nerve pain. CBD has also been proven to help with anxiety issues, which I suffer from as well.\n\nWhat can you tell us about L8 and your future plans?\n\nThe future for L8 is bright! We are currently located in all Erewhon locations in LA, along with a number of bodegas in New York City. We are expanding across the United States and hope to eventually bring L8 to Canada.\n\nAny pointers on how to get your brand into one of the top grocery chains here in LA?\n\nHaving worked for a big Canadian protein manufacturer for a number of years, I developed a skill set in order to approach top-tier retailers. The trick is to not take no for an answer and to believe in your product while also listening to what kind of product they need/want. Knowing your competitors is also key when approaching any retailer, so that you can highlight and identify differences between their product and yours.\n\nHow do you stay connected to your friends and family in Canada?\n\nI keep in close contact with my family and friends via FaceTime and text. I try and get back to Canada at least a few times a year. They also love a good LA trip as well :)\n\nJuly 2023 Canadian of the Month\n\nKirstine Stewart\n\nMedia, Technology, Author\n\nBorn in Toronto and trailblazing her way from transforming broadcasting to orchestrating digital strategies for the social media titan Twitter, Kirstine Stewart continually reimagines leadership amid the digital revolution. She's a powerhouse expert working at the crossroads of media and technology, renowned for her knack for turbocharging revenue, boosting profitability, and spurring expansion across global markets.\n\nKirstine's career began modestly when she applied for a position as a Girl Friday at a film distribution house. She propelled through the ranks and became President - while still under the age of 30.\n\nKirstine went on to a career filled with leading business positions; first heading up the international channel business for Hallmark Entertainment, next HGTV and Food Network establishing household name stars of design and lifestyle. In 2006 she took on the role leading Programming at CBC TV, injecting much-needed critically acclaimed hits like Heartland, Dragons Den (Shark Tank) Murdoch Mysteries and started development of Schitts Creek. She was promoted to the top job and headed up all programming and operations at the network for television (news, sports, entertainment) cable broadcasting, radio and digital, overseeing 5,000 employees across the country. She became the first woman and youngest person to head the CBC, revitalizing the network’s primetime ratings.\n\nAn exciting transition to tech was next at Twitter, leading the company’s expansion into Canada-and later overseeing North American media teams and content partnerships in New York.\n\nKirstine’s best selling ‘Our Turn,’ published by Random House, delves into the possibilities of leadership in a world already undergoing significant change. She articulates: “Digital revolution has created a new reality that demands a new style of leader with attributes and perspectives.”\n\nFor her expertise across media and tech she was recruited to serve as Head of Future of Media at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 2018 with a portfolio of over 50 of the largest media-related companies in the world and worked with the CEOs of member companies like Tencent, Google, P&G and more.\n\nKirstine currently sits on the several private and publicly traded boards including Think Research, sports gaming Rivalry Corp and serves as Chair of the board of Blink49Studios in Los Angeles and Toronto. She is actively committed to social change through her work with organisations like the Coalition of Innovation Leaders Against Racism (CILAR) and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). She is an active mentor at Toronto Rotman School, CreativeDestruction Labs, and advises a number of early-stage tech companies.\n\nTell us about your impressive career?\n\nA lot of people are impressed when they learn I was president of a company before the age of 30 - especially since I started at that same company when I was fresh out of university and my first job was as a “girl friday” - changing the office cooler water bottle, faxing and filing (when we used to deal with paper:) and all “miscellaneous duties as assigned”. But I think it’s that first job that gave me the training for the top job. Flexibility, willingness to do whatever job needed to be done, seeing every piece of paper that crossed the desk gave me the scope of knowledge that when I answered the phone at the front desk, I didn’t just take a message - I was trying to help the people who called. My boss at the time overheard and gave me my first sales position, selling shows like Degrassi, to MENA and SE Asia. Having that job taught me how people evaluate and use content, especially in other cultures; that lead to the next job.\n\nEverything I’ve done has lead to the next thing, even when that “next thing” looked like a whole other industry. I sold tv shows and film libraries around the world so I learned how the world craved content. I also learned its value with every contract. When I swapped sides of the table and started buying shows, I knew what was needed. At Hallmark I was licensing for about 80 countries from major studios. At Alliance Atlantis I started commissioning productions and helping build brands of a lot of Canadian design and food stars who became big US hits. At CBC I took all of that and applied it to running not just a prime time schedule but also news and sports. Then added responsibility overseeing 5000 employees across the country and adding radio and digital when I took the top job. Launching shows like Dragons Den that became household names and making it big in the US on Shark Tank.\n\nLeaving that all behind for Twitter, that had yet gone public, seemed strange to many, giving up such a big job running the CBC, but I saw the future was beyond linear. I had done the first Netflix deals for CBC, there was a new world to explore. I did first in Canada, then was lucky to head up North America for Twitter out of New York.\n\nMy advice is that one thing leads to another, if you’re willing to never stop learning, and you’re ready to embrace the unknown. And raise your head up once in a while when your nose is into your work, you can see what’s coming next, and you can also see the impact you’re making and take the time to let others shine.\n\nTell us about LA life at the Consulate?\n\nAs the “Madame” - a completely honourable title in this case :) - I’m present for a lot of the events at the house. And that’s the part most people “see”, the celebrations honouring the achievements of great Canadians here in LA. But there’s so much more to the office and team of about 50 people my husband works with covering trade, immigration, safety and more. He’s a lot busier than the pictures you see on my Instagram, he and his team cover three states (SoCal, Arizona, Nevada) working on cross border relations in so many categories from agriculture to investment to tech and space, military and more.\n\nMy days are filled with work on a number of public and private boards both in US and Canada, a few projects in the entertainment industry and advisories to digital projects. I wasn’t even meant to live in LA, as my work had taken me to Geneva and then NYC in CG Shaikh’s first year in the house, then the pandemic changed everything.\n\nI’m really proud of what he and the team have done and it’s great to see it up close. Even though I’m only seeing the public side of his duties, in the public sphere he’s been very intentional to make sure the work is impactful and inclusive of a new Canada, and show that to the people here in his US territories.\n\nIn launching the Key to the Consulate recognising achievements of successful Canadians in LA, he’s not only giving an honour, it’s an invitation to contribute to the programming in the house. Recipients are chosen because of their efforts to use their own success to lift up their communities, it’s brought some great life to an old house. Even the art on the walls CG Shaikh selected specifically from the archives so that they paint a literal picture of the real Canada for our US neighbours to see. Black, Indigenous, women, LGBTQIA’s talents are not only on the walls but create food that’s served, perform the music, and are on the guest list of attendees. It’s also the theme of different business incubators his Trade team has launched to great success. It’s been a great run and look forward to the year ahead.\n\nJune 2023 Canadian of the Month\n\nPatrick O'Keefe\n\nProduction Designer, Sony Pictures Animation\n\nPatrick O'Keefe is a production designer at Sony Pictures Animation, currently at work leading the art department on the upcoming \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.\n\nO’Keefe most recently served as art director on “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” winner of the 2019 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\n\nPreviously, he served as a visual development artist on Sony Pictures Animation's “Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation.”\n\nO’Keefe has worked on a variety of films, video games, commercials, and television shows. He served as a visual development artist and matte painter on commercials for brands like McDonald's, Kellogg, Kraft, Amazon, and more. He also worked as a background painter on Disney Television Animation's “Big Hero 6: The Series.”\n\nO’Keefe has worked on award-winning virtual reality short films such as “Henry,” which won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Interactive Program in 2016, and “Invasion!”, which took home a Daytime Emmy in 2017. He has also served as a production designer for short films “Fragile” and “Ashes Fall.”\n\nHis additional credits include serving as a concept artist for Electronic Arts video games such as Battlefield 4, Battlefield Hardline, Dead Space 2, and Dead Space 3.\n\nO’Keefe studied illustration at Sheridan College before transferring to the Emily Carr University of Art and Design where he received his Bachelor of Media Arts in Film and Animation design.\n\nWhat were the reasons that led you to work in LA?\n\nI always dreamed of making films and, at a young age, focused my attention on drawing and painting. At my secondary school in Toronto, I took every art class that was available to me and would eventually end up at Sheridan College studying Illustration. After my first year, however, I fell in love with another Torontonian who was studying in Vancouver, and as any sane young man would do, I dropped out of school and chased her to the west coast. I enrolled at the Emily Carr Institute, where I found an opportunity to combine my love for illustration and filmmaking in the Media Arts program. While I was finishing school, I got a job working as a storyboard artist in animated TV, but as I graduated, the 2008 recession began and the animation industry in Vancouver all but dried up. Fortunately, the video game industry was strong, and I landed a gig as a concept artist with Electronic Arts. From there, I transferred within the company to Montréal, where I would eventually begin working with EA’s San Francisco head office. As my connections with the head office grew, I decided it was time to head south and try to inch my way back to my dream of making films.\n\nAs an inter-company transfer, my family and I qualified for the L-1B Visa. My then-girlfriend and I had a small ceremony at City Hall in Toronto to officially become a family, grabbed the cats, and headed to Northern California. After several years in the Bay Area with EA Games, I received my Green Card, and due to a changing of the guard at EA, I decided it was time to make the move to LA. I had secured a job at Disney TV, and although it was ‘film adjacent,’ I was excited about getting closer to my passions — but was and would spend the next several months commuting from Oakland to Burbank while preparing my move to LA.\n\nAs I was leaving EA, I posted on Twitter that it was my last day and Sony reached out to say the timing was perfect. I came down to LA to start working for Disney TV, but had a meeting set up with Sony Pictures Animation to work on a film that was never completed. I felt an instant connection to the studio and people there. At this point in time, I was commuting from the Bay Area — I would fly into LA every Monday morning and go to work, and then fly back on Fridays. I wrapped up at Disney TV, started full time with Sony, and began to transition my home base to LA.\n\nTell us about your scholarship fund!\n\nWhile attending Northern Secondary School in Toronto, I enrolled in every single art class that was available to me, but the head of the department, Mr. McNaughton, suggested that I enroll in an extracurricular weekend course as he could see my developing passion for art.\n\nA pair of former Sheridan professors, Gerald Sternick and Vince Peets, had started their own school as a sort of art prep school for artists looking to build their skills and prepare for post-secondary art school. Money was always tight in my family and, after begging with my Mom and setting up a payment plan with the professors, I started my long-term relationship with the Animation Portfolio Workshop. I would eventually take a second, and third class with them, sometimes back-to-back on the same day. My Big Brother (from the Big Brothers program) would often drop me off or pick me up after a long day, and I think he probably even paid for some of the classes. Even once I entered into my post-secondary studies, I would drop in for the occasional life drawing class. As the years went on, I always stayed in touch with the school and eventually I began to understand how fortunate I was, fortunate for the access to the class, fortunate that they were willing to let me pay as I went, fortunate that my Big Brother was there to help me out. It had such an impact on my life and I dreaded the idea that there is an artist out there who does not have these fortuitous opportunities.\n\nIt was during a trip to Toronto and a drop in on the Animation Portfolio Workshop that the idea emerged to start a scholarship for young artists in a similar situation, who just need a little help to get the opportunity to discover their dreams. We would eventually pair with Big Brothers and Big Sisters Canada to help find suitable candidates. The collaboration with BBBS made it even more impactful for me.\n\nHow did you get your break as Production Designer for the animated Spider-Verse films?\n\nOn my last day at EA, I made a Twitter post thanking the studio(s) and all the incredible people I worked with for a memorable 8 years across three studios. I was unprepared for the amount of interest from other game studios asking about my next move and availability, but the one that stood out was from Justin K Thompson, a Production Designer at Sony Pictures Animation. Justin and I had met years earlier while I was on a trip to LA looking to make connections within the film industry. He and I had tried over the years to work together but the timing never quite worked out, until now. I was commuting from Oakland to Burbank to work at Disney TV but stopped by Sony and found the dream job waiting for me, designing films.\n\nAfter a few months of working on an untitled film, there was a shakeup at the studio and my current project was going on hiatus. I was super nervous because I was pulled into a meeting informing me of the hiatus and then flew back to Oakland to finish packing up my apartment and getting ready for the big move down. The plan was to drive the car and cats down, then fly back north a few weeks later and make the final move. When I got back to the studio I was informed that I still had a job and that we would all be joining the then-unannounced Spider-Verse film. A few weeks later, I was driving the U-Haul down the 5, while my wife read the script aloud.\n\nI started on the first Spider-Verse film as a visual development artist. Similar to my role in games, I was creating artwork, designing sets, etc. I fell in love with the project and was so excited to finally have my dream job, that I went all in. After several months of hard work, I was asked to take on the role of environment Art Director — basically, I was in charge of designing and directing the creation of the sets for the film. The film would go on to be a critical success and was awarded the Oscar for Best Animated Film. As the sequel began, the Production Designer from the first film moved into a Director role, and I would eventually take over as Production Designer.\n\nWhat are you most proud of that you've worked on?\n\nI couldn’t be more proud of this latest iteration of the Spider-Verse. We continued to push ourselves and the medium of animation to new heights. I am honoured to be a part of something that is so groundbreaking and to have such an incredible crew, as well as the support of our studio, Sony Pictures Animation, as we attempted to do the unprecedented.\n\nHow do you stay connected to Canada?\n\nI try to get back to Toronto and Vancouver as much as possible to see friends and family. Additionally, I am a big sports fan and make a point of going to every Leafs and Raptors game when they are in town. In fact, watching the games on the hometown feed always makes me feel like I am at home — for the last playoff run, I was busy finishing the film, which means constantly watching the files and reviewing the lighting, so I was forced to listen to the sweet sounds of Joe Bowen doing the play-by-play.\n\nMay 2023 Canadian of the Month\n\nJosh Iwanaka\n\nOwner, Studeo Gyms\n\nJosh Iwanaka is a Canadian born, Los Angeles based, fitness entrepreneur at Studeo Gyms. Born and raised in Coquitlam, British Columbia, Josh grew up an athlete excelling in football and eventually went on to play for the University of British Columbia. After graduating from college, Josh pursued a career in the tech industry and was a game designer at Electronic Arts. After leaving the tech world in 2010, he began working in the Vancouver fitness scene.\n\nIn 2015, Josh took a major step in his career and moved to Los Angeles to become a partner in Studeo Beverly Hills, a boutique personal training studio specializing in athletic training. As a partner, he helped manage the business through the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic and is poised for the future.\n\nJosh has 2 children with his wife Mira and currently lives in the Valley Village area.\n\nWhat brought you to LA?\n\nHonestly living in LA was never the ultimate life vision for me. However, when the opportunity to become an owner of a gym in Beverly Hills came up, I could not turn it down. I figured if I want to create the best fitness experience in the world this was where it had to be done. Plus, it’s a lot less rainy here.\n\nTell us about the strengths and \"stretches\" of owning a gym?\n\nBeing an entrepreneur is both exciting and terrifying. Owning a gym is always exciting and a fun place to be. Rarely does it feel like work. I’m lucky to be a part of something special and to have surrounded myself with good people who trust me, and the process.\n\nFitness has become exer-tainment which is definitely a strength but part of the “stretch” is creating magic to attract new members and consistency to retain members. There will always be clients quitting so it’s important to never let your standards lower. Growth is always challenging in the fitness space since it is such a competitive market, but it’s been even more challenging since Covid. Thankfully we have been able to weather the storm and are poised to push through the crowd this year.\n\nWhat type of athletic training do you specialize in?\n\nWe specialize in being able to train anyone and everyone, so we offer three types of training to fit people's goals and needs: Private Training (one-on-one), Semi-Private attaining (one coach with up to four clients) and Group Personal Training (30+ person classes). We take the college weight room experience and make it available to more people. What makes our training different is how we take the science of fitness and dress it up in a way that people love. We’ve been touted as “rugged athleticism meets progressive design” by Architectural Digest.\n\nIt's AAPI month and we would love to hear about your own heritage and how you celebrate your culture with your family living as a transplant here in the US.\n\nI'm third generation Japanese on my fathers side. Two of his brothers were born in internment camps in the interior of British Columbia. He and his younger brother were born on the journey back to Vancouver. My grandfather contributed in fighting for the redress of agreement with the Canadian government.\n\nDespite this deep history, Japanese culture was not instilled in my brother and I as children. In my experience most hapa people my age share similarities in their upbringing. As a father raising two children of mixed Asian heritage, my goal is for my kids to have a deeper understanding of their heritage than I did growing up. Fortunately Los Angeles is a city that celebrates cultural diversity and offers a plethora of ways for me and my family to reconnect with our heritage.\n\nWho is your inspiration in your field?\n\nThe fitness field is a vast space. It has grown into a variety of paths: gym owner, trainer of stars, fitness influencer, strength and conditioning coach and brand ambassador to name a few. However, my ultimate inspiration would be the founders of Soul Cycle, Barry’s Bootcamp and F45. These founders of fitness concepts mastered the user experience. They are the most sought after concepts in the fitness space and I think Studeo has the tools to become the next brand to scale.\n\nIf you could tell your 21 year old self playing football anything about athletic training, what would it be?\n\nI would tell myself to get a coach to give me direction in my training and nutrition. Despite being a gym-rat, I eventually came to the conclusion that I lacked the knowledge to take my performance to the next level. I needed a coach to identify my weaknesses and help me improve them. My ignorance in nutrition also hindered my success as an athlete. Without a proper understanding of how to fuel my body for optimal performance, I felt inconsistent in my energy levels on game day. Had I had a coach, I believe I would have elevated my performance from good to great.\n\nMarch 2023 Canadian of the Month\n\nSean MacDonald\n\nChef & Restaurateur\n\nChef Sean MacDonald is the owner of new Bar Monette in Santa Monica. Bar Monette (named after his wife) is an intimate tapas wine bar above the beach, serving Neapolitan-style pizza and dishes drawing inspiration from Spain and Italy.\n\nHe began his role as an Executive Chef at the age of 23, at MARKET Restaurant in Calgary. After being named a 2016 Game Changer, he was featured on the cover of BRANDED Magazine’s 2016 winter issue, a Calgary, based magazine. In June 2016, at 24 years old, he won the Canadian title for the San Pellegrino Young Chef Competition and represented Canada in the World Championships in Milan, a competition for the best young chefs in the world 30 years old and younger. In August 2016, Chef MacDonald was the Official Chef of Diner en Blanc Calgary. He was formerly the Executive Chef of Hexagon Restaurant and 7 Enoteca in Oakville, Ontario. With his year at Hexagon restaurant, he brought it to being the highest rated new restaurant of 2017 by Toronto Life Magazine, with a rating of 4.5 stars out of 5. In 2018 he was selected as #221 chef in the world by “The Best Chef Awards,” the only Canadian chef on the list. In 2019 he was selected as one of the 16 Rising Talents for North America by The Art of Plating. He was recently the chef owner of ēst Restaurant and Biga Pies in Toronto. ēst Restaurant recently made Canada’s 100 Best Restaurants List at #35 and was selected by “Blog TO” as one of Toronto's 100 Essential Restaurant’s List.\n\nMacDonald was a contributing columnist to The Globe and Mail. He is also a brand ambassador for All-Clad Metal Crafters LLC, Caesarstone, Le Nouveau Chef Apparel and was a sponsored chef of Patron.\n\nWhat inspires you as a chef?\n\nMy biggest inspiration as a chef is the constant ability to create. I love it because everyday I can wake up and be creative and make something, whether it’s super tasty that me or others can enjoy, a dish that looks aesthetically pleasing to the eye (essentially making art) or creating an environment that others get to come together in and enjoy food and make memories.\n\nAt 23 years old, you were already an Executive Chef. How did you get your big break and stay so successful?\n\nI guess I got my big break when I did become an executive chef at that age, running a kitchen. The owner of a restaurant I worked at back in the day reached out to me asking if I wanted to take over the restaurant. I jumped at the opportunity. I wanted the pressure and the responsibility. I then went on to being named the best young chef in Canada a year or two later through the San Pellegrino Young chef competition and representing Canada in the worlds. That was a big moment for sure. A lot changed after that and kick started my success.\n\nSuccess for me has been an uphill battle, no overnight success. You get what you put in. Constant roadblocks, unpredictable moments and persevering through them. I’ve had to overcome a lot to get to where I am today. People, unforeseen circumstances, things out of my control. It was no easy path and looking back I’m very proud of myself for being such a fighter and always being positive and setting goals and working to achieve them. Also super grateful for those people who have supported me along the way. I find the biggest thing to being successful is relentlessness and never giving up. That’s the difference between those who make it and those who don’t.\n\nWhat brought you to LA?\n\nIn the back of my mind I always could see myself living in LA. I love the weather and energy. When I met my now wife who was located in LA, it essentially acted as the catalyst that brought me here. I took a leap of faith and now there is no other place I would rather be. I think it was a little bit of fate. I feel a sense of peace living here that I haven’t felt living in other places.\n\nIt's Sunday night, what are you making for dinner at your house?\n\nI’m having friends or family over and I’m going to make a tapas-style dinner where I make whatever I’m inspired by. Go to the market in the morning to buy the ingredients. Maybe some small bites and salads to start. A stuffed pasta course or pizza, then meats and shellfish cooked over the charcoal grill. Finish with a few desserts. It’s never just one thing. I love to cook for the people I love and go all out.\n\nWhat can you tell us about your new menu at Bar Monette and why did you choose the genre you did?\n\nWe are a tapas-style wine bar drawing inspiration from Spain and Italy. I love making and eating Spanish and Italian food. Two of my favourite places to visit. I found a crazy love for making pizza over Covid. So I wanted to create a place where I could bring them all together on one menu and they obviously work very cohesively together. We will be serving Neapolitan-style pizzas with a crispy, chewy airy sourdough crust. We’ll have some small bites and well balanced small tapas style dishes to accompany. I wanted to use really high quality ingredients and serve them in a setting that feels like home. We will be serving products from A5 wagyu, truffles and caviar to stuff bought in the morning from the Santa Monica Farmers market to the highest quality imported Spanish and Italian ingredients. I can’t wait to show everyone what we have been working on. Essentially Bar Monette (named after my wife) will be serving menu items I would “cook on a Sunday night” for friends and family.\n\nFebruary 2023 Canadian of the Month\n\nFlo, Singer/Songwriter\n\nFlo is known as a pop/soul phenomenon. She’s a captivating artist with undeniable stage presence. She has shared the stage with artists like Lauryn Hill and Boyz II Men. Whether it’s an arena or concert hall, Flo is in her element on stage, her powerful, emotive voice shaking the rafters. Flo followed up the success of her self-titled album with her sophomore release, “Pieces of Me”. Produced by Western Canadian Music Awards “Producer of the Year” Arun Chaturvedi, \"Pieces of Me\"(crowned Western Canadian Music award urban album of the year) is a reflection of who Flo is: an artist who represents encouragement, personal strength, passion and positivity.\n\nFlo’s enduring message of faith and self-empowerment reflect her will and desire to overcome all obstacles and follow her dreams, \"I believe this dream is bigger than I am.” Luckily for Flo, her voice is bigger than her dreams. She is passion in living form, travels into realms of soul that some artists never tap into, and this is only the beginning...\n\n\"And as we let our light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.\"\n\n- Marianne Williamson\n\nWhat was your first experience with music in your youth and any tips on how to foster a greater sense of appreciation in children at a young age?\n\nThis is going to sound like a cliche answer, but since I can remember as a kid, I was always copying what I heard on the radio. I fell in love with artists, had favorite songs, and of course would imitate what I heard, that was my first source of learning. For kids, I'd say let them experiment, let them have fun. Kids are instinctually, and innately drawn to their natural passions and inclinations. If you watch them from an early age, you'll come to learn what they're born to do. And music early on has such an effect on babies and toddlers: you see them bouncing around, smiling, dancing, and some even singing and making musical sounds before they can talk. I'd say from the beginning, let kids experience and explore different things, and by watching them, it'll become clear what they love, what they're naturally drawn to.\n\nWhat brought you to LA?\n\nI came to LA to fully see what would come of my musical pursuits, to give it and myself as many opportunities as possible. You know, to answer the big, \"what if\" question (again another cliche answer that most artists and creatives that come to LA give, but it's the common truth of what draws so many of us from around the world to La La Land 😉).\n\nWhere does your musical inspiration come from?\n\nMy musical inspiration comes from LIFE in general: what I see happening around me and of course personal experiences. But more often than not, my \"musical downloads\" (what I call the spontaneous ideas that just pop into my head out of nowhere whether I'm deep in REM sleep, in the shower, doing the dishes, or driving my car) will come and deposit a melody, a chord progression, a chorus/hook, or seemingly a nonsense lyric that I know has something special to it, a seed of an idea, a beginning that must be fleshed out and finished. Also I'm very chord and melodically driven and inspired. I'll be at the piano or keyboard and either hear something in my head and play around with that idea, or maybe I'm just playing around on the keys and I'll stumble upon a chord, and the richness, texture, tone, and coloring of that chord will immediately let me know if I'm about to create a sad, deep, ballad, or a victorious, unstoppable, anthem. A lot of my songs are stories that shaped around the colors/themes that got their genesis, their beginning from the FEELINGS that particular chords and melodies spoke to me.\n\nWhat kind of challenges have you faced in your field and how have you overcome them?\n\nCHALLENGES?! Oh my goodness, where do I start! 😂😂😂 Well let me just preface by saying that the cool and reassuring part with most of these challenges that I'm going to state is that I've come to realize that I'm not alone, and so many of us creatives all face and go through similar things. But here we go: proving yourself, making a name for yourself as you knock on doors in hopes of finding the open doors of opportunity and demonstrating that you can hold your own and are where you are meant to be. So many things to do and accomplish that all require money, so constantly trying to prioritize what imminently needs the investment, and finding ways to be creative and still bring out quality results while working with (and often times figuring out ways to wisely stretch) the budget and resources you have on hand. The wait. Persevering, and enduring, not giving up: keeping your eyes on the prize, nose to the grindstone and continuing to hustle, continuing to work hard, fighting doubt as you wait and work towards \"the big break\", \"the big opportunity\" that can sky-rocket, catapult your career and change your life. Questioning if the magic that you feel you have on hand will translate to others, if they will resonate, feel, and love it too? So many more challenges, BUT I'm not going to leave a novel for you to read, so I'll stop here 😂. I'll tell you one thing that so many of us in the entertainment industry know: it's not an easy road, it's not for the faint of heart, BUT if you LOVE it, if you're PASSIONATE about it, the challenges, the ups and the downs are SO WORTH IT!!! And if you truly believe in your heart and spirit that you're doing what you're created to do, then really there is no other option. If this is what makes you heart beat, what makes you come ALIVE, then it's like: LET'S GO, LET'S DO THIS! You know what they say, the most rewarding things in life often come with challenge (they don't come to us easy). So hey, if this is part of the package, part of the picture, I'll take it 😉! So I guess that's my long-winded answer to overcoming😂: knowing that I'm doing what I LOVE, that deep down inside I know and believe that all of the challenges will be worth it in the end (it's also making me into a stronger, more courageous, human being with a story to tell), so I'm going to persevere and take the short term sacrifice for that long term gratification, my pot of gold that awaits me on the other side of the storms with my rainbow and my silver lining, yeah it's coming! 😉\n\nWhat are you working on now and how can we Canadians living in LA support YOU?\n\nOooooo my favorite question! I'm working on lots of new songs!!! The songs that will be part of my future new releases! I'm excited to start releasing them and sharing them with everyone!!!! Stay tuned to my social media page: www.instagram.com/flosoul for future updates that will come once these songs are ready to step out into the world 😉😊!\n\nJanuary 2023 Canadian of the Month\n\nJulia Cohen, Showrunner/Writer\n\nJulia Cohen is the creator/showrunner of ABC’s THE COMPANY YOU KEEP, starring Milo Ventimiglia. With a passion for character driven, serialized drama, Cohen has developed projects for FX, HBO MAX and the CBC. Hailing originally from Toronto, she is a graduate of the WGA Showrunners’ Training Program and the Warner Brothers Writers’ Workshop. Most recently, Julia was a Co-Executive Producer on A MILLION LITTLE THINGS. With a proven track record of helping to launch first-season shows onto successful multi-season runs, her past credits include such acclaimed series as RIVERDALE, QUANTICO, DEGRASSI, THE ROYALS, LEGION, and DALLAS.\n\nWhat was your first professional writing job?\n\nMy first professional gig was a freelance episode of Degrassi: The Next Generation that I co-wrote with the lovely and talented Lara Azzopardi. That show launched so many careers it’s almost a Canadian writer’s right of passage, so even though it was only a freelance ep, I was so thrilled to be a small part of TNG during its heyday.\n\nWhat was the moment that made you think you could do this job forever?\n\nThe moment I realized that TV writing was for me was when I fully understood the collaborative nature of television - most especially the writers’ room. I love so many aspects of this job but my happy place is the writers’ room. Passing the creative ball back and forth, bouncing ideas off one another, getting inspired by other writers’ ideas and instincts - that’s the part of this job that I find the most thrilling. Not only does it yield the best possible work, it’s also incredibly fun. That spirit of collaboration runs through so much of what we do in television - from development, production through post-production - and it’s by far the part of the job I find the most gratifying.\n\nHow have writing rooms changed or evolved for you over the years?\n\nRooms have changed quite a bit with the advent of streaming and mini-rooms and, unfortunately, not always for the better. Unlike when I started my career on the TNT reboot of Dallas - it’s unusual for lower level writers to get to produce their own episodes and, essentially, be trained up in all aspects of production. I was lucky enough that in Cynthia Cidre - my first showrunner - I had an executive producer who was truly willing to teach, delegate and empower. It’s not uncommon now, to have co-executive producers who have come up through the ranks and have spent little or no time on set producing their episodes, no time in post-production, etc. Being a TV writer is as much about producing television as it is about writing television - so I count myself lucky that my early credits were on shows that let me learn all those skills. On the plus side of meaningful ways that writing rooms have changed - nowadays rooms are so much more diverse and inclusive than they were before. So that’s certainly a change for the better. I was definitely the token female in more than a few rooms back in the day.\n\nDid you ever aspire to be in front of the camera?\n\nI’ve always loved the performing arts and briefly entertained being an actress. I went to the Etobicoke School of the Arts for drama - and it was there that I took my first playwriting course which was the fuse that lit my passion for writing. Ultimately, I quickly realized that I was far too self-loathing and in my head to ever really be an actress… But lucky for me, they’re qualities that lend themselves perfectly to being a writer!\n\nWhat brought you to LA?\n\nI moved out to LA with my former writing partner, Lara Azzopardi, when we were lucky enough to get into the the WB Writers’ Workshop. I briefly moved back to Toronto but once I got my first staffing job in 2011, my husband and I made the move to LA permanently. We love LA and our life here - turns out we were West Coasters the whole time, we just didn’t know it.\n\nWhat are some of the biggest differences between being a writer in the US versus Canada?\n\nMost of my career has been in the US, but in general, the writing rooms tend to be a little smaller in Canada. I would say that working on shows with smaller budgets forces you to be more resourceful which is a skill that really helped me in my career down here and proven useful time and time again.\n\nTell us about how The Company You Keep came to be?\n\nIn late 2020, I was approached by some producers for ‘my take’ on a Korean format that they'd optioned called MY FELLOW CITIZENS. Ultimately, of all the writers they met with/heard from, they liked my take the best. At that time - given that we were in the middle of the pandemic and coming off a fraught election - I was craving something escapist, fun and wildly romantic. Baked into this concept is a little bit of everything that I love. It’s part epic romance, family drama, part crime caper and part spy thriller - so it has something for everyone. As we were preparing to take it out to networks we found that Milo was looking for his next project. After pitching him the project, he and his producing partners came onboard as our partners which was a game changer. Needless to say, having one of television’s biggest stars sign up to star in your show has been a literal dream come true.\n\nTHE COMPANY YOU KEEP premieres Feb 19th at 10pm on ABC.\n\nDecember 2022 Canadian of the Month\n\nTrina Hendry\n\nA lover of food, wine and travel, Trina launched her nearly 20-year career as a hospitality and travel/tourism marketer at Toronto-based Metropolitan Hotels where she served as the PR Director at three Canadian properties and Senses Restaurant before managing the public relations for the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO). Upon graduation at UCLA Extension with a Certificate in Marketing with a Concentration in Digital Marketing & Analytics, Trina worked at various marketing agencies in Los Angeles representing both luxury and boutique properties, including Terranea Resort, Alisal Guest Ranch and Santa Monica's Shore Hotel, as well as destinations like Beverly Hills and Redondo Beach, until the pandemic hit and the travel industry came to a screeching halt. It was during this time that she came up with the idea of One California Day, a sustainably minded experiential travel company that has reimagined the quintessential California road trip, while working part-time as the Director of Brand Marketing for The Culver Hotel. Most recently, she was responsible for heading up the marketing for two newly opened Hollywood hotels - Thompson Hollywood and tommie Hollywood - and their restaurants and nightclubs, including Mother Wolf, Ka'teen, Mes Amis, Bar Lis, Desert 5 Spot and Citizen News. Trina balances her work with a personal passion for day tripping, as well as spending time with her senior rescue pup, Atticus.\n\nWhat brought you to LA, and what have you been doing since you arrived here?\n\nI have dreamed of living in Los Angeles for as long as I can remember but it was the ice storm of 2014 in Toronto that sealed the deal, as I swore I’d never endure another Canadian winter again.\n\nMy story is a bit unique in that I didn’t move to LA for a job. I moved here because it was my dream to live in California. I enrolled in a Marketing Certificate program at UCLA Extension, which provided me with not only a student visa but the opportunity to gain US work experience, and most importantly, the ability to network for one year following graduation. With an established background in Travel and Hospitality Marketing back in Canada, I was able to build upon my career here, working at various marketing agencies, as well as assuming the role of Director of Brand Marketing at The Culver Hotel, and most recently as Complex Director of Marketing for the Thompson Hollywood and tommie Hollywood, where I opened both hotels and their respective restaurants, including Mother Wolf and Ka’teen.\n\nYou recently launched a new business. What is One California Day, and where did the idea come from?\n\nWith a hospitality marketing background, a deep love for California, and an entrepreneurial spirit – I owned a culinary tourism business back in Toronto – my goal was to one day launch a travel business in LA.\n\nOne California Day is a sustainably minded experiential travel company that offers travelers a fun way to explore California by taking self-guided day trips with a catch: they won’t know where they are going until the day of their trip. Departing from three major cities–Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco–the mystery itineraries are designed to surprise and delight, revealing a beautiful California destination, one memorable stop at a time.\n\nI conceived One California Day during the pandemic when travel options were limited and travelers took to road-tripping as a safe and fun way to satiate their desire to get outside and explore. We partner with local businesses, offering them another way to market to travelers, and we promote sustainable travel through our business practices and by offsetting carbon emissions through memberships and donations to organizations like 1% for the Planet and One Tree Planted, as well as offering responsible travel tips.\n\nWe officially launched in October 2022. To celebrate, for the month of December, I’m offering Canadians Abroad members a 40% discount off all itinerary purchases until December 31st using the promo code CANADAEH. They can be used anytime of the year and make great gifts!\n\nWhen you have friends and family visit, how do you spend one perfect day in LA?\n\nOh wow, that’s a tough question because there are endless things to do here, and a relatively thorough tour of LA requires multiple days. But, anyone who knows me well knows that I love Malibu. So, if I only had one day, I’d take my guests on a mini road trip up the PCH, enjoy brunch at Cafe 27 in Topanga or Malibu Farm on the Pier, followed by shopping at Malibu Country Mart and a hike at Solstice Canyon, or a relaxing afternoon at a lesser known beach. We would finish the day with dinner (and a sunset) at The Sunset Restaurant or Neptune’s Net before making our way back down the coast for a cocktail and some celeb spotting at Nobu.\n\nAs a board member of Canadians Abroad, you are obviously a proud Canadian happy to be living in LA.\n\nWhat do you miss about Canada and love most about living here?\n\nI proudly tout that I am Canadian to anyone who will listen, and am so thrilled to be a part of bringing a little bit of home to Canadians living here. I miss my family and friends the most obviously, but a close second would have to be ketchup chips and Cadbury Caramilk chocolate bars, which are nearly impossible to find here. :) The weather and natural beauty were the initial draws but what I soon discovered I love most about LA is the creative energy fueled by ambitious innovators, an active outdoor lifestyle, limitless things to discover and experience. As they say, if you can dream it, you can find it in LA. I feel inspired every day.\n\nWhat’s your favorite day trip from Los Angeles?\n\nWith dozens of incredible destinations within a 2-3 hours drive of LA, it’s nearly impossible to pick a favorite day trip. Whether it’s a trip out to the desert, an adventure into the mountains, or an epic drive along the coast, all are equally enchanting. The one place I frequent the most though is Santa Barbara and its wine country in the Santa Ynez Valley. It nourishes my food and wine loving soul like nowhere else.\n\nNovember 2022 Canadian of the Month\n\nAliya Jasmine\n\nEnvironmental Journalist/TV Host/Director\n\nAliya Jasmine has spent the last two decades as a prominent TV Host, Producer, and Environmental journalist (M.A., F.R.C.G.S.) who's award-winning stories have been staple viewing on national and local networks including NBC News, NBCUniversal, CTV Bell Media, MTV News, IMPACT, Discovery Channel, and more.\n\nAliya holds a Masters in Environmental Journalism from the University of Southern California, a Social Media & Digital Marketing Certification from Harvard University, and bilingual (French & English) BA in Comms from the University of Ottawa.

You have a brand new TV show premiering this month, can tell you us about what you're working on right now?\n\nI'm hosting a new series for the Discovery Channel called, The Mightiest, which premieres November 23rd in primetime! We've been filming the show for the last six months and I'm so proud of it! The six-episode, one-hour, docu-series follows myself and fellow veteran adventure co-host Teddy Wilson as we take to the field and witness the mightiest of machines take on astounding new missions. From re-engineered Chinook helitankers fighting wildfires 24/7 in Southern California, to a train that helps sustain life and connect communities, the series reveals the innovation and science that enable machines like these to conquer near-impossible challenges. We filmed the show across the USA, Canada, and Europe.\n\nHow did you get your big start working at Much Music and tell us a bit about what you did there?\n\nWorking in TV has been my dream since childhood. So after graduating from University, I started interning at Fashion Television, and eventually got a paid gig as a cable wrangler at Star TV. I worked my way up from there, learning as much as I could about how TV was made, until I eventually scored a position as a producer at MuchMusic. I produced the daily Live flagship show MuchOnDemand and some iconic Canadian faces like George Strombo, Rick the Temp, Matt Babel, Leah Miller, etc. I feel really lucky to have been able to understand the behind-the-camera side of t"
