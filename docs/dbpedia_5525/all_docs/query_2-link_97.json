        "text": "Lori Jeanette Phelps, Senior Store Manager\n\nLori was born and grew up in the small northern Alberta town of Peace River. Lori’s Metis heritage comes from Pouce Coupe, BC and High Prairie, AB. Growing up in Peace River, Lori was surrounded by a wide variety of Indigenous Culture. She has always had a passion for Indigenous art, this is shown in her support of local Artisans. Lori always welcomes local Artists to show off their work in our store. She has made traditional moccasins, does beadwork and currently works with leather to create some of the beautiful pieces on display in our stores. Lori brings a strong retail background to the team. She strives to provide our customers with a great shopping experience, and ensures they will want to come back. She is very committed to the success of our Edmonton location and strives to build a strong community through relationships born in the store.\n\nKatelyne Bonin, Keyholder\n\nKat was born and raised in Northern B.C. and spent most of her life living in various regions of British Columbia. She loves the beauty of mother nature, reading, creating, and spending time with family and friends. Recently, she and her fiancé, along with their daughter, moved to Edmonton to be closer with her fiancés side of the family and further immerse their daughter in her Indigenous (Cree) heritage.\n\nKat's ancestry goes back to the original peoples of the Head of the Lake region in British Columbia (Sylix Okanagan). Her great, great, great grandmother Lucy Sʔimlaʔxw (Simla) eventually settled in the Keremeos area with her husband (of the land) Frank Richter. They, along with their 5 sons, ran \"Richter Ranch,\" establishing the very first orchard in the Similkammen Valley. 25 years into the marriage, Frank chose to take another wife of European descent, sending Lucy to live out her days in a cabin alone on the property. Some of her woven baskets, along with a handmade calender and other artifacts, can still be found at the Penticton museum to this day.\n\nFinding a home here at 49 Design was a perfect fit for Kat. It's given her the unique opportunity to not only use her creative spirit but also learn more about her culture from various perspectives while being surrounded by a supportive community.\n\nLaredo Strawberry-Nault, Keyholder\n\nLaredo Strawberry-Nault is from O’Cheise Reservation No. Treaty 6, he grew up off the reserve in a small town called Legal, AB.
