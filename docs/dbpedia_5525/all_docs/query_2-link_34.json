The participating objects (as well as some plants and animals,) were submitted by their human owners prior to the commencement of the project.\r\n\r\nThrough the inquiry as to why a particular item was selected by it&#39;s owner, and the exploration of it&#39;s physical properties, we observed many parallels between the inanimate/domestic and the human. What do the things around us tell us about inner states, weaknesses, loves and anxieties? Histories, inter-woven, animate with inanimate, revealing pains left to incubate over a long winter. The intimate nature of the performances established a comfortable setting for musical collaboration, with emphasis on healing of the subjects&#39; wounds.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the musical component of this project, the process of co-habiting a small and intimate space was well considered and documented. Routines were established and analysed, work methods combined and explored, likes and dislikes compared, cut and seasoned.",
