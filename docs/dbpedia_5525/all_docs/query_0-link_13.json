        "meta_description": "Available in: Paperback. A Studs Terkel-esque, oral history-driven travelogue and people's history. Di Cintio speaks to a surprising range of subjects, from members of the Iraqi National Guard who survived the American bombardment and fled to Canada, to Nathan Phelps, the son of Fred Phelps of the Westboro Church, who escaped his father's pull and fled to Canada, where he drives a cab on the West Coast, to Rawi Hage, whose cab-driving experiences found their way into his Dublin Impac Award-winning Cockroach, to the group of Indigenous woman who form a cab service for other Indigenous women to keep them from harm.Will appeal to readers interested in contemporary issues surrounding immigration and refugees, borderlands studies, social and economic class, labour, racial discrimination, and transportation, especially in urban centers, as well as Barbara Ehrenreich fans.As in Di Cintio's recent books, Pay No Heed to the Rockets, about life in contemporary Palestine (praised by Kirkus and Canadian outlets for its intelligence and sensitivity) and Walls: Travels Along the Barricades, Marcello largely travels through other people, telling their stories, and through them, capturing a sense of the place.

        "text": "Praise for Driven No big event kicks Driven into gear. Nobody is a celebrity. There is no specific wrong to be righted, no particular injustice to be exposed. Indeed, Di Cintio consciously abjures the best-known tropes of cab driving ... Instead, he sticks to wanting to know about cab drivers, and this impulse-plain, old-fashioned inquisitiveness-is a journalistic force not to be underestimated ... It takes up a subject so ordinary that you hardly notice it, but it becomes more interesting the closer you look. In fact, the closer you look, the more your view is not of a single subject at all but of an entire world. -Literary Review of Canada A varied, eclectic collection of stories from the frontlines of North America's taxi industry, showcasing the indomitable hope of the people who literally keep our cities moving forward. -Maclean's Driven is an engaging, impeccably investigated, character-driven work of narrative nonfiction, told with Di Cintio's wonderful dark humour, keen empathy, and rich journalistic eye. The book is a searing testament to the power of untold stories, of people who exist in the margins, of hidden histories, as well as an examination of Canada's immigration laws. Driven urges us to rethink the enduring toll on those individuals who labour for us and take us where we need to go. A truly fine blend of heart-break, guffaws, and research. -Lindsay Wong, author of The Woo-Woo and My Summer of Love and Misfortune In these deeply researched and richly-often shockingly-detailed portraits of Canadian taxi drivers from all over the world, Di Cintio reveals, among other things, the heavy price exacted by getting here, and staying here. The funny, savage, and poignant stories in these pages give a fresh urgency to an old saying that all of us should remember the next time we get into a taxi: 'Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.' -John Vaillant, author of The Tiger: A True Story of Vengeance and Survival An astonishing book about folks from all over, many of whom have been through total hell but have somehow made their way out ... You never know who's driving you. Each person contains multitudes. -Margaret Atwood on Twitter Fascinating ... Nuanced ... In Driven, Di Cintio stayed in his own country and paid close attention to the men and women most of us take for granted. Most were immigrants. Many came from war-torn nations. Many were what Di Cintio calls 'chess masters of their own lives,' possessing a genius and ingenuity that few of us recognize. -Calgary Herald Praise for Marcello Di Cintio Di Cintio researches his subjects thoroughly, conducts in depth reporting, and writes with vigour and humility. -Kamal Al-Solaylee, Quill & Quire Di Cintio weaves together history with a sense of place and infuses character with dialogue and humor ... masterful. -Selma Dabbagh, The Electronic Intifada Illuminating reading from a highly engaged author. -Kirkus Reviews"
