        "text": "The son of Fred Phelps, founder of the controversial Westboro Baptist Church, calls his father’s theology “morally bankrupt.”\n\nNate Phelps will speak about his experiences growing up in the church in a free public lecture Thursday, March 6, sponsored by the Windsor / Essex County Atheist Society. The church has become infamous for its demonstrations against gays and lesbians.\n\n“Any ideology that marginalizes a group of people based on whom they choose to love is morally bankrupt and I reject it,” says Phelps, executive director of the Centre for Free Inquiry Calgary.\n\nHis lecture begins at 7:30 p.m. in room 1100, Centre for Engineering Innovation."
