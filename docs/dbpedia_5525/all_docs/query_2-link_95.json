It was time to fix that. We heard about Doctor Nick's Amazing Man Stuff back in January and Cee has been using their beard products daily since, so it was great to have Co-Founder Nick Phelps on the pod for a chat.\n\nCee and Nick chopped it up about their Beard Beer products inspired by classic IPAs and Stouts, they ran through the full story on how the company came to be, how they procure all their high-end essential oils (not cheap fragrance oils) and packaging in the US, and they even got into their upcoming Brewmaster Series, where they'll be making collaborative Beard Beer in conjunction with breweries like Tree House, Lawson's Finest Liquids, Vitamin Sea, Trillium and more. Nick crushed a Maine Brewing Co. Lunch IPA and a Vitamin Sea Beachfire Stories stout, while Cee got into a Mikkeller Fresh Start IPA and 5e Baron Lucide Dream breakfast stout.
