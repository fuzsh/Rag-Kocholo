        "text": "Louis Theroux is once again returning to Kansas to feature the bigoted church group, The Westboro Baptist Church.\n\nIt’s the third time that the BBC documentary maker has featured the hate-filled church, as he first encountered them 13 years ago.\n\nAs Louis Theroux: Surviving America’s Most Hated Family airs on the BBC this weekend who are the Phelps family behind the so-called religion, and why are they so heinous?\n\nHow did the church get started?\n\nWestboro Baptist Church originated as a branch of the East Side Baptist Church, established in 1931 in Topeka. Kansas. In 1954, East Side hired Fred Phelps as an associate pastor, and then promoted him to pastor of their new church plant, Westboro Baptist, which opened in 1955. Soon after Westboro was established, Phelps broke ties with East Side Baptist.\n\nRead more\n\nWhen is Louis Theroux: Surviving America’s Most Hated Family on TV?\n\nWestboro Baptist began picketing Gage Park in Topeka in 1991, saying it was a den of anonymous homosexual activity. Soon, their protests had spread throughout the city, and within three years the church was travelling across the country. Phelps explained in 1994 that he considered the negative reaction to the picketing to be proof of his righteousness. Phelps died in 2014, but the remaining Phelps family members continue to run the church.\n\nWho are the family behind it all?\n\nThey’re called the Phelps family, who were lead by Fred Phelps Sr. He preached a doctrine very similar to that of the Primitive Baptists, who believe in scriptural literalism, that the scriptures are literally true and that a predetermined number of people, who were selected for redemption before the world was created, will be saved on Judgement Day.\n\nHis vitriolic preaching alienated church leaders and most of the original congregation, leaving him with a small following consisting almost entirely of his own relatives and close friends.\n\nThe family is made up of his 13 children, some of who still continue his evil legacy, including Shirley Phelps-Roper, who has appeared on Louis Theroux’s documentaries several times, and who acts as a lawyer for the church.\n\nSince 2004, over 20 members of the Church, mostly family members, have left the church and the Phelps family.\n\nMark Phelps, estranged son of the church’s founder, Fred Phelps, left Westboro Baptist Church in 1973 and began “formal healing therapy” in 1988 which he said was to “work toward healing and restoration, overcoming the horrible pain and fear from the 19 years of living with his father”.\n\nLauren Drain, another former member of the Westboro Baptist Church who was excommunicated in 2008, released an autobiography titled Banished in March 2013. She says the children of the group were brainwashed.\n\nMegan Phelps-Roper, a grandchild of Fred Phelps, left the church in 2012 together with her sister Grace, and explained her reasons and experiences in a TED talk:\n\nWhat “religion” do they practise?\n\nTheir doctrine seems to be spreading of hate, rather than love, and telling everybody in existence that God hates them, with the inference being that a higher being approves of their bigoted acts.\n\nThey peddle their offensive banner and placards – usually the same format – which state “God hates XX, with whatever group, race, gender or sexuality that’s on their twisted hit list that day. This includes (though not an exhaustive list): LGBT+people, Catholics, Orthodox Christians, atheists, Muslims, Jews, Romani people, U.S. soldiers, celebrities and politicians.\n\nIf their version of heaven even exists, they’re likely to be the only ones rolling around there, and it’s the rest of the entire world who are the “sinners”, apparently.\n\nAs of March 2009 the church claims to have participated in over 41,000 protests in over 650 cities since 1991.\n\nHow do they get away with it?\n\nRemarkably, though people have tried, legally there isn’t much that can be done about the Westboro Church, as in America, they can plead the first amendment, freedom of speech.\n\nThe church – and their Phelps Chartered law firm – also collects fees under the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Award Act of 1976 when their protests have been unlawfully disrupted.\n\nBecause of the church, there were laws passed in several states that made it a felony to protest within 500 feet (150 m) of a funeral. The bills provide penalties of up to three years in prison and a $10,000 fine for those found to be in violation of the law.\n\nHave they ever tried to enter the UK?\n\nIn February 2009, the church announced on their website that they intended to picket a youth production of The Laramie Project to be held at Queen Mary’s College in Basingstoke, Hampshire. This would have been their first picket in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn the lead-up to the event, a number of MPs, lobby groups and LGBT groups appealed to the British Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, requesting these individuals be blocked from entering the UK.\n\nOn February 18, 2009, two days before the intended picket date, the Home Office announced that Fred Phelps and Shirley Phelps-Roper would be specifically excluded from entering the UK for having “engaged in unacceptable behaviour by inciting hatred against a number of communities”, and that “other church members could also be flagged and stopped if they tried to enter Britain”\n\nLouis Theroux: Surviving America’s Most Hated Family is on BBC Two on Sunday 14 July at 9pm."
