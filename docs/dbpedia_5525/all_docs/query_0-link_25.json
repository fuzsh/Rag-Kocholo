        "text": "Alaskan poet John Haines has been gone for more than a decade now, but his singular voice stays with me—the deep quiet of it and its enchantment, the spareness of his lines—Li Po transposed to the far north. Much else is here to muse on and admire—his charming letters to Rachel Epstein, photos of his homestead in Richardson, transcripts of talks given, memoirs of a vanished Alaska, selected essays, notes on the imagination’s relationship with the natural world, even recollections of his service on a destroyer in the Pacific toward the end of WW II. May the Owl Call Again is a moving and memorable collection, and at its heart is Haines’ haunting poetry.\n\n—Marc Hudson, poet, translator, and an emeritus professor at Wabash College. His most recent book of poems is East Of Sorrow.\n\nMay the Owl Call Again bears witness to the last years of Haines' life—his thoughts, humor, melancholy, a profound awareness of Alaska’s rhythms, and his struggles with engagement in a broken world. But, above all, it is a meditation on friendship and the solace of intimacy that can be found in the handwritten page. It’s a testament to care, the aches of connection and solitude, and the consolation of finding kinship with another. I found myself reading it all at once and walking away with a profound sense of gratitude for Epstein sharing this Haines with all of us.\n\n—Freya Rohn, poet and founder of Ariadne Archive\n\nWhat a fine tribute this collection is. That Rachel Epstein corresponded so frequently with John in his last years is both touching and laudable. He clearly appreciated the long-distance friendship. I was saddened by the elder poet’s references to loneliness and failing health while simultaneously uplifted by his endlessly inquisitive mind, sense of humor, and ongoing interest in literature and the arts. Re-reading the poems and essays included here, I was moved again by the wistful and sometimes dark tone and the seeming simplicity of language. John Haines will be remembered as one of Alaska’s greatest thinkers and writers.\n\n—Anne Coray, poet and author of Bone Strings\n\nRachel Epstein artfully constructs a sensitive portrait of poet, John Haines, in the evenfall of his life, through a series of letters exchanged with the author. Revealed in this correspondence is a man with a giant intellect, a deep curiosity, and a true interest in the present-day world. His reputation as curmudgeon is not evident as he writes to Epstein about cats, sends her cards (mostly cats, mostly humorous), and comments on life while exhibiting a dry wit and wry sense of humor. He recommends films and books related to interests she has expressed. In this, he proves himself to be a generous and attentive friend. In addition to the letters, Epstein includes a broad selection of poetry that reflects the range and content of Haines’ work. I was particularly glad to see she included “Rain Country,” a poem I have reread over the decades. I still find myself drawn into that country anew, as if reading the poem for the first time, the poet not old, not yet. Ultimately, Epstein’s purpose in writing this book is best expressed by her: My hope is that John Haines will not fade from collective memory but will continue to influence, inspire, and nurture creative expression within and beyond Alaska. Her fine work represents a great contribution to that effort.\n\n—Gretchen Diemer, poet and author of Between Fire and Water, Ice and Sky\n\nPurchase on Bookshop.org at this Link\n\nBookshop.org works to connect readers with independent booksellers all over the world.\n\n‍We believe local bookstores are essential community hubs that foster culture, curiosity, and a love of reading, and we're committed to helping them thrive.\n\nEvery purchase on the site financially supports independent bookstores.

There is a wonderful spontaneity here, as the poems twist, weave, dart and land in unexpected places. In this absorbing book Cable moves through a wide assortment of jobs—crab fishing, panning for gold, farming and construction work—as well as extremes of weather—30 below winters, violent summer rainstorms—and a multitude of human and animal encounters. As they offer up verbal and sensory revelations, these poems express the full richness of one man’s experience.\n\n— John Morgan, author of nine books, including The Hungers of the World: New and Collected Later Poems\n\nIt must be good to know, deep inside, that one lived one’s life to the fullest. I never met Jerry Cable, only heard about him—but I feel I’ve met him now, and I am stunned. His poems capture what it is to live and work for twenty years in Interior Alaska, all the while navigating between one’s past and the future, the cold and warmth, the fun and not. At the same time, many of the poems are like shining, mystical riddles. Spare and honest, they explore what lies beneath the moment – vivid, poignant, ecstatic, unsayable.\n\n— Carolyn Kremers, author of Place of the Pretend People: Gifts from a Yup’ik Eskimo Village, The Alaska Reader: Voices from the North, and the poetry collection Upriver, finalist for the 2014 Willa Award\n\nGerald Cable’s new poetry book, If Singing Went On, is an extraordinary collection that explores the beauty and heartbreak of the world. These poems are the words of a man who built his own cabin in Alaska and worked construction there for many years. They examine ordinary events and difficult topics, all with the same careful attention to language. The voice in these resilient and achingly beautiful poems is powerful, confident, and wholly unique. I recommend this book with all my heart.\n\n— Linda Schandelmeier, author of Listening Hard Among the Birches and Coming Out of Nowhere, winner of the Willa Award\n\nReading Gerald Cable’s posthumous book If Singing Went On is like listening to an intelligent friend telling you about his day. He reels out thoughtful descriptions with insight and fresh metaphor from an active and capacious mind. Ranging from observations of abandoned dredges in Alaska to harvesting the garden in fall “…the cold heart of joy.” He surprises at every turn… Against the hard metal of industry, he flashes forth with organic metaphors connected to the natural world… He would have us know, as he says to a friend, “It’s cold, Emily, and the world sails hard for the sun.” His words come to us alive as ever.\n\n— David McElroy, author of the poetry books Just Between Us and Water The Rocks Make\n\nCover art by Tami Phelps, \"Polychrome Pass\"\n\nInfinite Meditations: For Inspiration & Daily Practice offers techniques to:\n\nGround yourself in times of stress and change;\n\nDiscover or re-kindle your spiritual journey;\n\nTap into your intuition to maximize personal joy and effectiveness;\n\nCreate an unlimited number of unique meditation mantras based on your beliefs and goals\n\nWords from Readers:\n\nThis surely is a work of art! I like that the meditations are given in a context that is useful and meaningful to the reader; in this book, the author holds a nice balance of being capable and informative, yet also humble. The first time I tried it I just “asked,” and the number 33 popped into my mind, so I read Meditation 33 and chuckled at how appropriate it was. Thank you for sharing Infinite Meditations with me – may it have a good journey out into the world.\n\n— Jane English, PhD, Photographer, Author of A Rainbow of Tao, and co-creator with Gia-Fu Feng of an edition of Tao Te Ching. See eheart.com\n\nInfinite Meditations invites the reader into a multi-faceted, ongoing conversation with the Tao Te Ching, that ancient Chinese classic of mystery and sensibility. Scott Hanson’s inspired reflections on the Tao and other rich founts offer compelling insights and possibilities for the reader to create a path of one’s own. Here you will find ageless wisdom, new perspectives, and bountiful nourishment for an enduring meditation practice. Drawing from an extensive range of sources as varied as multiple translations of the Tao Te Ching, including one by Gia-fu Feng and Jane English, to the discoveries of Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, Scott Hanson has created an accessible and compelling gateway to a meditation practice for a lifetime.\n\n— Carol Ann Wilson, Author, Still Point of the Turning World: The Life of Gia-fu Feng, Foreword Magazine’s 2010 Book of the Year\n\nIn my years leading teams of people, I have consistently been an advocate for a holistic approach to work – meaning that it is important to be happy in life, and work is only one component of happiness. One strategy I use for personal happiness, and have recommended to others, is to begin every day with some form of positive reinforcement either through reading or meditation.\n\nI was energized by Scott’s vision and approach to a subject that is dear to me. This book not only addresses the value of daily meditation but also acts as a guide for newcomers to the practice. I would recommend it to anyone who craves more peace and harmony in their life, and particularly as a tool to those who are faced with unanticipated challenges. I see Infinite Meditations serving as an inspirational conduit to people focused on improving themselves.\n\n— Robert Ackerman, Author, Executive Coach and Former COO of a Fortune 500 Company\n\nThis is a unique interpretation of the Tao Te Ching that offers an understanding of the fundamental ideas of Taoism in a modernized and eclectic style. I find that subsequent readings of specific meditations reveal additional insights and depth to the experience. I highly encourage everyone to give this work at least one read, the number of meditations absolutely being finite notwithstanding.\n\n— Jack Hanson, Mathematics Instructor\n\nThe largest insufficiency of American culture today is the lack of the masses to recognize one thing: that each person has a soul that begs to be understood in its relation to a just and loving higher power. Meditation can be one of the best platforms in life to pursue knowledge of our inner being, and of God. With Infinite Meditations, Scott Hanson gives the reader a solid foundation for the value of meditation / contemplation; then the tools to incorporate that into daily life in ways that are meaningful to each person. Hats off to this unique and extensive effort. I highly recommend it!\n\n— Greg Gibson, Author of Rhythm of the Stride: Answers in Time\n\nLearning to meditate over the past two years has really helped me navigate through a very difficult time. As I have evolved with it, I find I usually meditate in the early evenings, as this gives me the greatest peace of mind. I don’t love all of the meditations that Scott shares, and I tell him that! But I particularly love my meditation - “Peace Come to Me” (80); as well as “Meditation 65 - I am the Song,” and “Meditation 78 - Becoming One with the River.” The vision of becoming like ice melting (from 78) is a mantra that really appeals to me and helps me let go.\n\n— Gail Halsaver\n\nIt has been nothing short of a fantastic journey watching this project unfold from its first conception, through many years of drafts and re-writes to the present moment. I admire Scott’s vision and his driving passion to create a work that reflects the spirit and depth of his personal meditation practice. It has been a privilege reading, experimenting with mantras, and offering my edits to meditations in real time with him. I believe the book succeeds in providing simple, profound messages that will serve to guide, ground, and inspire.\n\n— Kristina Hanson\n\nThe truth is, meditation can be a challenging habit to develop yet the commitment and dedication of this very personal act of self-discipline is well worth the effort. ​​​​​​I have been meditating for over 20 years and the benefits Scott lays out are true and here for us.\n\nI love how Scott has brought together not only individual meditations on various subjects but he also explains the benefits of meditating; tips on how to meditate; suggestions for enhancing one's practice; and more.\n\nThe well-written and thoughtful individual meditations have given me a resource of topics to meditate on that have enhanced my own practice. Infinite Meditations would be a great book not only for an advanced meditator but also for a beginner.\n\n— Signe Nichols, a long-time student of the practice of meditation and seeker of mindfulness\n\nKate Troll’s frank personal memoir proves that Tolstoy was wrong — All happy families are not alike. The six talented, close-knit Troll siblings shared a loving, fun-filled childhood and remain best of pals as adults. Turns out, there is something (or I should say someone?) missing. And that is only half of it. All in Due Time is full of surprises and puzzles, but mostly it made me wish I were a long-lost Troll.\n\n— Heather Lende, Alaska State Writer Laureate and author of If You Lived Here, I’d Know Your Name\n\nThe surprises and turns in the story provide an opportunity for the author to fill in important backstories and topics relevant to today’s women and families. For example, the backstory of the author's mother includes her being sent off to live in a home for “ostracized women and unwed mothers.” In this way All in Due Time provides a unique glimpse into how far women have come in the last seventy years. Additionally, the author explores timely topics such as the influence of birth order and how much of our political ideology comes from our genetics. It is these backstories and investigations that makes All in Due Time a robust and fascinating read relevant for our times.\n\nAn emotionally satisfying story with a charming cast of characters and a big-hearted perspective, All in Due Time is a fitting memoir for our era of genetic surprises. Unlike many memoirs on this topic, Troll conveys the sunnier side of digging into dark family secrets, weaving a tale of joy, inclusivity, and empathy.\n\n—Andromeda Romano-Lax, author of Annie and the Wolves, Plum Rains, and Behave\n\nAs an only child, as an adoptee, and as an Alaskan I loved this book. The writing was so good, I couldn't put it down. As a result of reading All in Due Time, I now have decided to learn about my biological father and his family.\n\n—Diane Antaya, primary teacher, Juneau, Alaska\n\nOther Ways to Purchase\n\nClick Here to go to Ingram Content Group\n\nClick Here to go to Hearthside Books"
