I think he's an angry person who's twisted the Bible and picked and chosen verses that support his anger, that sort of justify his anger, and he's instilled that in his children and they've passed it on to their children. Although the second and third generation are by and large quite nice people from what I saw, they still live under the influence of their Gramps.\n\n—Louis Theroux, writer and presenter of the documentary film The Most Hated Family in America[1]\n\nFred Waldron Phelps, Sr. (1929–2014) was an American pastor, former attorney, and the former leader of the Westboro Baptist Church, a crazy cult self-described Primitive Baptist/Calvinist church in Topeka, Kansas, with around 60 members, most of them members of his extended family. Phelps and his church became infamous for their fanatical, vitriolic, anti-LGBT rhetoric, manifested by many demonstrations outside funerals and public events, with \"colorful\" picket signs emblazoned with cartoons of men having anal sex and mantras usually taking the form of \"God hates [insert bête noire du jour here]\". His conduct violated both the spirit and the letter of Christianity, as most people understand that religion.[2]\n\nPhelps garnered a widespread negative response, including a spot on the UK Home Office's list of individuals prohibited from entering the country. As of 2010 or so, he had made fewer public appearances, and had handed over control over the day-to-day administration of the WBC to his daughter Shirley Phelps-Roper ; an all-male board of elders may have replaced her.[3][4]\n\nOnce upon a time, Phelps was a Democrat (believe it or not)[5] and a civil rights lawyer who eventually was disbarred for committing perjury on a case he filed on his own behalf.[6] However, his whole life was devoted to homophobia, to the point of alienating the entire world (save for his precious cult Church, of course). Phelps was estranged from four of his thirteen children, allegedly due to \"discipline that amounted to abuse\".[7] He was arrested repeatedly for violent and non-violent offenses and had four criminal convictions.\n\nPhelps had the dubious distinction of being the only person in recorded history who made Sean Hannity (among others) seem rational, although his daughter is also quite good at making Sean seem slightly less odious in comparison.[8][9][10]\n\nWestboro Baptist Church[edit]\n\n“”The views of the Church on religion, society, and sexuality are so bizarre that it is hard to categorize their members in terms of normal political leanings.\n\n—Not even Conservapedia likes them.[11]\n\nPhelps's organization, the Westboro Baptist Cult Church, is based in Topeka, Kansas. Its first public service was held on the afternoon of November 27, 1955. For over two decades, Topeka citizens endured Phelps family protests by the doors of their churches before normal services and memorial services. Worshipers had to walk through WBC protesters with distressing signs and hate speech, and there was a prolonged campaign before the relevant authorities legislated requiring protesters to remain at a distance from church entrances. WBC had plenty of local practice before taking protests nationwide.[12] The organization has been widely called a batshit hate group,[13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] and even the cesspool that is Conservapedia wants nothing to do with it.[11]\n\nToday, the church has about 40 members, most of whom are Phelps' family. Towards the end of his lifetime, Fred Phelps was (not/no longer) the charismatic leader, and Steve Drain maneuvered to have him excommunicated.[21][22][23]\n\n“”Unfortunately, Fred's ideas have not died with him, but live on, not just among the members of the Westboro Baptist Church, but among the many communities and small minds that refuse to recognize the equality and humanity of our brothers and sisters on this small planet we share.\n\n—Nate Phelps, estranged son of Fred Phelps[24]\n\nNate Phelps noted the way people with different beliefs and orientations joined lovingly together to fight harassment from the Westboro Baptists, and hoped that communities uniting could be one positive legacy from his father.[24] The WBC held yet another protest less than a week after the death of Fred Phelps, and Steve Drain found counterprotesters expressing sympathy over Phelps' death to be incomprehensible.[25] Counter rallies have given publicity to the WBC, but also gave opponents the chance to promote social justice, to oppose intolerance, prejudice, and xenophobia.[26] The future for WBC is speculative.[27]\n\nFunerals[edit]\n\nSince 1991, the church has made a habit of picketing funerals, particularly those of soldiers (regardless of their sexual orientation), on the grounds that said soldiers did wrong in fighting for a nation that doesn't execute gay men (\"fags\", as God Phelps calls them). Interestingly, it has also picketed many Christian organizations, including Jerry Falwell's funeral, because those organizations don't believe that gay people should be executed (that and because Falwell referred to Fred Phelps as a \"first-class nut\"). In addition to their primary webshite \"God Hates Fags\", they also run a whole site family, with URLs generally on the pattern of \"godhatesexample.com\" (considering the views of Fred Phelps, you'd almost think that when they say \"God\", they mean Fred Phelps). Given the number of things their god hates, he probably also hated the website example.com, too, and possibly even Google, which might end up finding example.com for those searching for it.\n\nAnother notable target was Matthew Shepard, a gay teen who was murdered in a homophobic assault; the protest at his funeral initially gained Fred Phelps a good deal of attention. Phelps also hated Sweden for their anti-discrimination policies with regards to anti-LGBT hate speech. He even blamed the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami on Thailand's large Swedish tourist population (presumably because God couldn't be bothered to hit Sweden itself). Other targets are countries in general, politicians, anyone prominent, and victims of crime and natural disasters. Anti-Semitism has been prominent in Westboro as of late, as they now target Jews as frequently as gay people.[28]\n\nIn 2012, the WBC apparently wanted to picket the funeral of Whitney Houston, but instead decided to Photoshop themselves into a shot of the funeral procession.[29]\n\nIn 2013, the WBC announced plans to picket the funeral of Aaron Swartz at his synagogue in New York City. Despite Swartz's involvement with WikiLeaks, having founded Reddit and DemandProgress, and his lifelong activism for freedom of information and internet freedom, including his leadership in the successful battle to prevent SOPA and PIPA from becoming law, the WBC seemed not to have figured out that Swartz was one of Anonymous's biggest homeboys. The amorphous hacker-activist alliance swore to outnumber the WBC in order to allow Aaron's family, fiancee, and friends to have the funeral they deserved. Either being scared shitless by the prospect of being outnumbered by anons, getting stuck in traffic, or just being their normal flaky selves prevented them from picketing.\n\nIn March 2015, WBC announced its intention to picket Leonard Nimoy's funeral, but were unable to do so because they were \"unable to find it\". Other Star Trek stars that have been targeted by the WBC include George Takei and Zachary Quinto, who are openly gay, as well as William Shatner. Their posting about the event also took a swipe at Shatner, saying, \"Leonard Nimoy's funeral is today but nobody's sharing where. So Westboro AND @William Shatner can't attend\". It stands to reason that WBC does not like Star Trek or its fans very much, either, considering the solid fact that Star Trek essentially stands for everything they're against.[30]\n\nOther pickets[edit]\n\nWestboro has recently taken to picketing schools, community colleges, and universities, claiming that children and young people are not properly trained up in Godliness.[31] A proposed countertactic is to confront them with silence.[32]\n\nWBC announced plans to picket Sandy Hook elementary school \"to sing praise to God for the glory of his work in executing his judgment\".[33][34] Perhaps they thought that the 6-year-olds who were murdered were probably \"fag enablers\" or some such.\n\nServices[edit]\n\nPhelps's sermons, some of which have been broadcast on radio or on his website, tended to last for around an hour, and consisted of an old man rambling incoherently to himself, getting agitated and shouting every few minutes, and quote mining the scriptures to support his warped and hateful attitudes.\n\nParishioners[edit]\n\nWBC consists mostly of Phelps's own family (though apparently not his entire family).[35] Nine of the thirteen children of Phelps had are still with the WBC, but most of them left for some time. Those outside lose touch with their family, friends, identity, meaning in life, and social structure and, if they believe WBC teachings, are in continual fear of Hell. Those who return penitent claim they get loving support and belong again but must obey WBC demands.[36]\n\nWBC displays many of the indicators of being an abusive, coercive cult,[37] even though the excommunication of Fred Phelps shows that he was not a charismatic cult leader in old age.[22] Even the KKK has protested against it (and vice versa, incidentally).[38][39]\n\nIt's also considered very much an open question whether the Westboro Baptist Church is a church in fact, as well as in name, or whether its churchness is simply a convenient legal façade with important benefits in the areas of taxes, finance, and First Amendment protections. Not many bona fide churches have a congregation composed (almost) entirely of one family, and the stunningly high proportion of lawyers among them is an added note of interest.\n\nRussell Brand interview[edit]\n\nIn 2012, British comedian Russell Brand did an interview with two members of the church on his show Brand X. The two showed up looking like biker gang wannabes. After a brief and largely mocking interview, Russell brought on three gay friends, who also largely mocked the two. Oh, and they gave him a sign that said \"Fag Pimp Brand\", a moniker he embraced for the episode.[40]\n\nTheological views[edit]\n\nThe theology of the WBC is an extreme variant of Calvinism. According to their beliefs:\n\nMan is in a state of sin, and can only be saved by the grace of God.\n\nThis grace is not given freely to all, but only to God's \"elect\".\n\nThe elect are the people whom God has foreordained to salvation. All others are reprobates who have been created for the express purpose of being sent to Hell. This is the Calvinist belief of unconditional election, aka \"double predestination\", a form of determinism; it explains why the Westboro Baptist Church protests aren't about proselytizing. The intent of their protests is to thank God for smiting us.\n\nThose whom God chooses to condemn, he causes to sin by \"hardening their hearts\" against himself.\n\nIt is the duty of the elect to proclaim God's word (even though God will not force the reprobates to listen). Their goal is not to win converts, or to \"save\" others, but simply to gloat rebuke others for their sins.\n\nNo human being can say who is among the elect, but those outside the WBC are certainly damned.[36]\n\nAll events on Earth happen because of God's will; this includes natural disasters and actions committed by people. Events such as Hurricane Katrina, the September 11th attacks on New York, and the financial recession of 2008-09 are therefore celebrated by the WBC as God's righteous destruction of people who disagree with them reprobates.[note 2]\n\nIt is also the duty of the elect to praise and thank God for all such judgments and totally not because they're a bunch of assholes. This is why the Phelps family is often seen with signs reading \"Thank God for 9/11\" and \"Thank God for Dead Soldiers\". They offered similar thanks for the recent $11 million judgment against them, because they saw it as proof that God is hardening the hearts of men against them.\n\nWBC members told Rebecca Barrett-Fox many times that the Second Coming of Jesus would happen during the lifetime of Fred Phelps.[36] As with every doomsday prophecy, this one failed completely.\n\nAlso, if you don't keep your kids out of public schools (where kids apparently shoot each other in the face repeatedly) or don't teach them about God enough or support stem cell research, you are joining the feast of \"bitch burgers, OBAMA FRIES, and slut shakes,\" and thus eating your children.[41] Their obsession with homosexuality appears to be the result of the widespread acceptance of homosexuality. For the members of the WBC, all sins separate man from God, and they do not claim that the elect are without sin. However, according to their beliefs, people must sincerely repent of their sins before they can be forgiven. For the members of the WBC, \"gay pride\" and the acceptance of homosexuality is tantamount to having \"murderer pride\" or thinking of child rape as being just another, equally valid form of sexual expression. According to the WBC, anyone who doesn't condemn homosexuality as evil is a \"fag enabler\" and thus deserving of divine retribution. Fred Phelps got emotional and refused to talk further to anyone who asked if he personally had homosexual inclinations.[42]\n\nPhelps was strongly critical of the Roman Catholic Church because of its sex scandals.\n\nPhelps and electoral politics[edit]\n\nFrom the 1970s to the 1990s, Phelps was a supporter of the Democratic Party, and was heavily involved at the state level. He ran for governor several times, but failed to get the Democratic nomination every time and never got past the primary. In 1988, he backed Al Gore for the Democratic nomination since Gore opposed a \"gay bill of rights\" placed for vote in 1984, while opposing Clinton's re-election later due to his support for gay rights. In 1992, he managed to get 31% of the Democratic primary vote for US Senate. He also had two mercifully unsuccessful runs for mayor of Topeka, largely due to the lack of organization of the local party and the opposition of every sane person in the voting area.[43][44]\n\nPhelps was critical of Ronald Reagan for sending an ambassador to the Vatican.\n\nNearly all conservatives have tried to disassociate themselves from Phelps, and are embarrassed over the extreme vulgarity of WBC campaigns. That said, some of Phelps's viewpoints are very similar to other members of the religious right.[note 3] Like Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, Phelps associated recent tragedies experienced by the United States with God's wrath for the nation's growing acceptance of homosexuality.[note 4] The difference between them lies in Phelps's acceptance, and even active encouragement, of these actions as part of God's will, while Robertson apparently thinks God is going too far by letting so many Christians die.\n\nReactions[edit]\n\nThe extreme hate of Phelps's church has led to a multitude of vigilante responses; some of them have been violent, but most of them aren't. The Patriot Guard Riders are a group that physically blocks the presence of the WBC, and students at a school counterprotested the Church. The Phelps family also seemed to take offense to a reporter's very friendly questions during an interview.[46]\n\nFor a time, the parody religion meme \"God Hates Figs\" was popular in colleges and online, under the theory that if you can't beat 'em, make fun of 'em. Another such parody was \"God Hates Shrimp\", whose creator called up the Phelpses on their radio show.\n\nOnce while the church was protesting a funeral in Topeka, someone slashed the tires of their van. They drove all over Topeka, trying to find someone that would fix the problem, and every repair service told them that they wouldn't help them.\n\nOn a more positive note, some presumably Universalists from a liberal Methodist group wrote, \"If grace is true, then God's love is welcoming Fred among the saints.\" Others disagree.[47]\n\nGetting sued[edit]\n\nMost of Phelps's spiritually malformed spawn are lawyers as he was, and routinely threaten to sue anyone who interferes with their hatemongering.\n\nIn 2007, the family of Lance Corporal Matthew A. Snyder were awarded $2.9 million in compensatory damages and a further $8 million in punitive damages for invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress after Phelps and his fellow hatemongers had protested at Snyder's funeral by displaying signs including one that said \"Thank God for Dead Soldiers\".[48] Phelps predicted that a higher court would overturn the decision \"in five minutes\" on freedom of speech grounds, and was proved right. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeal overturned the decision in September 2009, ordering Snyder's family to pay costs of $16,510.[49][50] In March 2010, the family appealed to the Supreme Court[51] and appealed for donations in order to keep the case going.[50] On March 2, 2011, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the WBC in an 8-1 decision, with Justice Alito being the lone dissenter.[52][53]\n\nAnonymous vs. WBC, or vice versa[edit]\n\nIn February 2011, the WBC claimed that Anonymous had threatened to take down their sites. Anonymous claimed it was an inside job, just an attempt to gain publicity, and not a genuine threat of attack.\n\nOn February 27, the David Pakman Show hosted Shirley Phelps-Roper and a member of Anonymous on a live call-in show. During the course of the ten-minute segment, after denying previous threats, and in response to the shrill Godbotherer's claims of invincibility, the representative from Anonymous pointed out that Anonymous had left a message on their server. They then proceeded to hack the site, which went down for a short while.[54] Some claimed the WBC was behind the threat, as they hoped to encourage hackers and later sue them.[55]\n\nAfter the Sandy Hook massacre, some part of Anonymous has released phone numbers and addresses of the clan to the internet after they cheerfully applauded the murder of over twenty young children.[56] If Westboro wanted attention from Anonymous now, they certainly got it.[57]\n\nFred and family[edit]\n\nDomestic abuse[edit]\n\nMany sources agree that Phelps regularly beat his children, especially his estranged sons, Nate and Mark.[58] Addicted to Hate, an exposé written by estranged members, sheds light on life with Phelps. Two of his children were briefly taken into protective custody after marks of abuse were found, but Phelps intimidated the authorities into dropping the case. The records of this would have been destroyed had he not sued the Topeka Public Schools over the matter. One Christmas Day, Phelps beat his son Nate into shock with more than 200 strokes from a mattock handle after receiving a report that he had nicked some bulbs for Christmas lights.[37]\n\nPhelps also encouraged husbands in his congregation to punch their wives. Indeed, it was reported that one fellow took this to heart and later had to call Phelps for bail.[37] Three of the children have stated that Mrs. Phelps was thrown down a flight of stairs.[37][59]\n\nNate Phelps[60] finally ran away from home on his 18th birthday. He now lives in Canada, is an atheist, works as a public speaker on LGBT rights and the connection between religious extremism and child abuse, and is writing a book about his life as the son of Fred Phelps. He is also the subject of a documentary currently in production.[61]\n\nNate claimed in 2014 that Fred was near death in a hospice after the rest of the family excommunicated him for undisclosed reasons. The family did not allow other excommunicated family members to visit Fred while he was dying.[42]\n\nFred's \"work ethic\"[edit]\n\n“”It was an unusual family by any account. From a young age, Fred Phelps' children earned a major part of the family's income, perhaps even all of it, when they were required to sell hate-laced candy door-to-door for hours after school each day.[62]\n\nFred Phelps spent so much time hating everyone and beating his kids he couldn't be bothered to provide for his family, making his children earn most, if not all, of the money.\n\nMargie Phelps[edit]\n\nPerhaps because Fred was getting too old, Margie Phelps played a more prominent role in the WBC. In 2011, British patient Harry Moseley died from a brain tumor at the age of 11 after raising £500,000 for charity.[63] Margie wrote to Harry's devastated family, telling them they should have taught him about Heaven and Hell instead of encouraging him to raise money for charity and help people. While Americans might be used to that type of unpleasantness from the WBC, British people were surprised and shocked.[64]\n\nShirley Phelps-Roper[edit]\n\nShirley Phelps-Roper was the church's most active spokesperson, ran the church's day-to-day operations, and was in charge of organizing their many protests. By being so active in the church and speaking on its behalf so often, Phelps-Roper has likely doomed a lot of them to hell.[note 5] She was featured heavily in the 2007 BBC documentary The Most Hated Family in America and the 2011 follow-up America's Most Hated Family in Crisis both presented by British documentarian Louis Theroux. She and her father were banned from the United Kingdom when they planned to protest in Basingstoke.[65] Other members of Westboro could be flagged and stopped if they attempted to enter the country.\n\nOne example of Phelps-Roper's outpourings took place on October 3, 2006, when she managed to shock Fox News pundits Alan Colmes and Sean Hannity by claiming that the five Amish schoolgirls who had been murdered earlier that week deserved to die.[66] Ironically, her first child Samuel Phelps-Roper was born out of wedlock, and everyone knows the Bible says that women who aren't virgins on their wedding night are to be put to death. It's been suggested that Phelps-Roper may have been ousted and an all male board of elders may have replaced her.[4][3]\n\nIn 2013, her daughters, Megan and Grace Phelps-Roper, publicly announced that they had left the WBC, and the family has since cut them off.[67][68] In October 2019, Megan published Unfollow: A Memoir of Loving and Leaving the Westboro Baptist Church (ISBN‎ 978-1787478008)[69] describing the love she experienced within the extended family, and the process of leaving first the family and then the faith.\n\nSteve Drain[edit]\n\nUnlike most members of the church, Steve Drain is not related to the Phelps clan by blood or marriage, and was not born into it. In the late 1990s, he made a documentary film known variously as Hatemongers or Fred: The Movie, which involved extensive interactions with the Westboro church. Following the film's completion, he and his family joined the church. Drain handles much of the multimedia for the church, including designing the protest signs and maintaining and editing videos for the website. Drain looks like he may be Phelps' successor,[21] judging by the video \"Lying False Prophets Are To Blame\" in which he is captioned as \"Watchman\", is wearing a suit and tie, and gives a very Fred-like rant.\n\nLauren Drain[edit]\n\nLauren Drain, a former member of the Westboro Baptist Church and the daughter of the aforementioned Steve, has written a tell-all book called Banished: Surviving My Years in the Westboro Baptist Church (ISBN 9781455512430).[70] In an interview, she hinted at the possibility that Phelps may have been a self-hating gay. While she hasn't actually directly stated that Phelps was gay, the possibility raises the question of Haggard's Law.[71]\n\nWBC makes videos![edit]\n\nFred hated Jon Stewart and his hooligan sidekick Stephen Colbert (for someone who seemed to hate sex, he sure was obsessed with coming). Note that this is probably the only time someone has claimed that The Daily Show was predicted in Biblical prophecy. He also hated Jerry Falwell, surmising that the fat false prophet died and entered hell. Fred also sounded like he knocked back a few more than usual before going on camera. Fred also hated Bill O'Reilly and da Canucks, and Australia, too. And he hated da media. For some reason, Westboro also makes Lady Gaga parodies.\n\nAn incomplete list of things Fred Phelps and his god hated[edit]\n\n“”If anyone says, \"I Love God,\" yet hates his brother, that man is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.\n\n—1 John 4:20\n\nCountries and nationalities[edit]\n\nLiterally every single nation and disputed territory[92]\n\nOrganizations and companies[edit]\n\nOther groups and demographics[edit]\n\nIndividuals[edit]\n\nEverything else[edit]\n\nA complete list of things Fred Phelps and his god didn't hate[edit]\n\nThe end[edit]\n\nIn March 2014, it was reported that Phelps was on his death bed,[115] which either meant that he was about to:\n\nfind out the hard way about the cost of spreading such venomous hatred for most of his adult life\n\nmerely become insensate worm food\n\nbe somehow proven right at the last minute\n\nIt's left up to the reader as to which one of these fates is more appropriate.\n\nOn March 16, Steve Drain denied a statement from Nate Phelps that his father was near death, but admitted Phelps Sr. was in a hospice. Drain claimed that Phelps Sr. \"has a couple things going on [...] The source that says he's near death is not well informed\".[116] On March 20, Fred Phelps got to learn first-hand who God actually hated, if anyone.[117] Shortly after his death, members of the church posted a eulogy that oddly didn't talk very much about him at all.[118] However, they did release a statement that (ironically) thanked God that Fred had died.\n\nThe internet mourned not the death of Phelps, but reactions were still mixed. Many rejoiced loudly and promised to piss on his grave. Others suggested that the ultimate form of retaliation was to respect Phelps more than he ever respected the world. Others said that we should simply forget Phelps forever and ignore what remains of his church, to prevent him from ever developing a legacy.\n\nIt was rumored that the heavy metal band Slayer would be protesting Fred Phelps' funeral, some even suggesting that the band members had set up camp outside the church in Topeka. Such rumors were dismissed by spokespersons of the band. Phelps' daughter, Margie, stated that no funeral would be arranged for her late father, and no details of his burial had been revealed.[note 7]\n\nExcommunication[edit]\n\nAround the same time as rumors of Phelps's pending demise began to circulate, there were rumblings that he had, in fact, been excommunicated from the church he had founded. This followed a supposed power struggle within the church, which pitted a bunch of male elders, led by Steve Drain, against Phelps's daughter, Shirley. Initial reports claimed that Phelps had been shown the door, for \"advocating a kinder approach between church members.\"[120]\n\nHowever, after his death, his grandson, Zacharias Phelps-Roper, left the cult and later provided more insight on what happened:\n\n“”Specifically, on the day that he was excommunicated, he stood outside of the front door of the church (but not within anyone's earshot but a few members of WBC who happened to be in the immediate vicinity) [...] I say, he spoke words to this effect to the Equality House: \"You are good people.\" I feel like he had a change of heart after my grandmother nearly passed away, and he felt the pangs of loss [...] he waited for news of her every day and night while she was in intensive care. I think this triggered a chain reaction whereby he developed great empathy for others... which would explain why he would support Planting Peace's anti-suicide and anti-bullying platforms, and their charities across the world [...] I love my grandfather! And I believe people DO change, if they are inspired enough![121]\n\nThe family allegedly excommunicated him for \"rank blasphemy\" for his last-minute, Darth Vader-like conversion from the \"dark side\", which unfortunately won't be enough to save him from hell according to his own Calvinist dogma.\n\nVideo gallery[edit]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nAddicted to Hate\n\nAmerican Taliban\n\nSteven Anderson, a man possessed by the spirit of Phelps after the latter's passing who is, unbelievably, even more vitriolic and hateful.\n\nReaction formation\n\nGod hates shrimp\n\nA page which includes what Fred Phelps God hates\n\nCalvinism\n\nHyper-Calvinism\n\nJesus Is Savior\n\nThe Church at Kaweah\n\nHaggard's Law\n\nDarwin Fish\n\nPoe's Law\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Most Hated Family in America , BBC documentary\n\nBBC News - Louis Theroux: Westboro Baptist Church revisited - Theroux presents a follow-up documentary on the Phelpses.\n\nFred Phelps' obituary, by serial documenter Louis Theroux.\n\nWestboro Baptist Church Up to date news from the Southern Poverty Law Center\n\nPhelps' webshites.
