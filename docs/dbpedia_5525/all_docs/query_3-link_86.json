        "text": "GREEN BAY, Wis. â Thereâs a good chance Ben Jacobi will be wearing the same green and gold striped overalls in January.\n\nHe was getting a start to the 2024 season with a group of adults and kids in high 80-degree weather at the Green Bay Packers Family Night at Lambeau Field Saturday.\n\nâItâs not football weather. Football weather is zero and snow. But we do it every year,â the Pewaukee resident said. âWeâve been doing it probably eight, 10 years. Itâs just something we do every year, whether itâs hot, raining, whatever.â\n\nThe scrimmage in front of a sold-out Lambeau Field offered fans an experience similar to game day with giveaways, music and post-practice fireworks.\n\nâThere are a lot of kids in the group and itâs a cheap way to get them here, inside Lambeau, for the history and all that stuff,â Jacobi said.\n\nWhile this is a years-long tradition for some fans, for others, such as Kayla Terriquez and her family, Saturday night was something new.\n\nâThis is our first time coming out to family night. Weâve been meaning to come for several years,â said Terriquez who lives in Germantown. âThe kids are finally old enough where I think they will enjoy it and be able to stay up late enough to enjoy all the festivities.â\n\nThe night offered a mix of football and entertainment for $10 a ticket. Saturday night was a sellout.\n\nAnthony Robertson of Daggett, Michigan, has been coming for years.\n\nâThey do so much here at Family Night and itâs affordable. We were able to get five tickets for Lambeau for a reasonable price,â he said. âThey be having some outdoor events to keep the kids enticed and everything. I just assume a full day of fun.â\n\nUnlike the rest of the season, Jacobi said he wasnât too sure just how much football he was going to be able to watch Saturday night.\n\nâIâll be watching kids,â he said with a laugh.\n\nLucky for him, thereâs a long season that follows Family Night."
