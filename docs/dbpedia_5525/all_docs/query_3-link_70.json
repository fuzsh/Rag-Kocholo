Lately, the congregation has taken to picketing Jewish organizations, spouting anti-Semitic material rarely seen outside the Internet abyss. Glossy “Israel is Doomed” signs have sprung up next to the classics: “Pray for More Dead Soldiers” and “You’re Going to Hell.”\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\nExclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay and others.

By then, he was already a regular face on the atheist speaking circuit — a high-profile exile from a church that was easy to hate — and the Centre for Inquiry offered him a position as executive director in Calgary.\n\n“It’s an international secular humanist group that focuses on educating the public and challenging religious organizations who are trying to inject religion into secular government,” he explains. Currently, the Centre for Inquiry is trying to help a local group overturn the Calgary Catholic School Board’s decision to refuse the HPV vaccine in schools, on the orders of Bishop Fred Henry.\n\nThe centre hosts talks and regular meet-and-greets for humanists. Last year magician and psychic debunker James Randi gave a lecture, and this month it organized SkeptiFest, a weekend-long comedy and musical festival for the faithless.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“We try to do events to help create the atheist, secular, Humanist, freethinker community here in Calgary. A lot of folks still want to have rituals, they still want events where they can feel connected. It’s an opportunity to gather with likeminded people,” he said.\n\nIt is an unusual place for a child of Fred Phelps to end up.\n\nThe Westboro church, comprised mostly of family members, has come under increasing scrutiny, most recently with the release of a BBC documentary. Dozens of adherents have left the church, and the BBC crew visited Westboro to find a clan refusing to grieve their loss — and speaking ominously of leaving America to live in pink-walled caves in Jordan.\n\nNate Phelps, who left the church as a teenager, is now 53, a large, curious, soft spoken guy with a salt and pepper goatee, close cropped hair and round cheeks. Today, eating chili chicken and yam fries at a Calgary Earl’s Restaurant, just off the TransCanada, he’s wearing a blue shirt, bright yellow tie and an earring. Just off from his day job in the transportation industry, he says he’s disturbed by the church’s seemingly escalating antics, their weird time-sensitive prophecies, creepy end-of-days stuff that calls President Barack Obama the anti-Christ and calls on the Jews to repent. He’s also bothered by the growing number of single young Phelpses who are pariahs outside the church. They can’t date and, seemingly, are unable to find partners outside their close-knit unit.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut Mr. Phelps said he doesn’t quite fear Westboro would do anything drastic, but, “it appears to be that they’re playing an end game,” he said.\n\nMr. Phelps counsels against hating them, which only makes the group more impervious. Their ideology teaches them to be hated: To be hated by outsiders only confirms their beliefs, that the temporal world remains corrupt, impenetrable and irredeemable by immoral lusts and temptations. The scorn heaped on them by society only ties the church ever more tightly together.\n\n“You grow up with the idea that the world will hate you,” he said. “That the world hates them is evidence they’re on the right path.”\n\nThose who leave the church are branded rebels against God, in league with the devil. Mr. Phelps’ rebellions earned him abuse, and when he left he believed he was going to hell. It is now much worse, he said, for young clan members.\n\n“The system [of control] is much more developed. It’s much more difficult for them to walk away than it was for me.”\n\nIn the mid-’70s, Mr. Phelps left after years of hearing his father threaten to hunt down and bring back wayward minors by force, so he saved $500 and bought a Rambler Classic, a ’60s-era mid-size from AMC, and he hid it in the bushes near his home in Topeka, Kansas. At the strike of midnight when he turned 18, he left home and never went back.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMr. Phelps wound up in Southern California, still a believer, but stayed away from religion until he eventually married and had three children. He joined a “mild evangelical church,” seeking to become ‘‘part of a community.”\n\nBut 9/11 drew in Mr. Phelps’s mind the connection between religious fundamentalism and the hijackers who flew planes into the twin towers and the Pentagon.\n\n“At the time, everyone was turning to blind faith — that was the same mechanism that caused the problem,” he said. “I thought ‘this is crazy, we have no idea that God is mad at us.’”\n\nThen he stumbled across Sam Harris’s the Science of Good and Evil, a seminal tome in atheist literature, and finished it in one reading.\n\n“It was the first time I read something that wasn’t religiously motivated. Then I was unstoppable, Dawkins, then Hitchens,” he said. His faith was chipped away a little at a time for years “and then suddenly, it all fell away.”\n\nYou grow up with the idea that the world will hate you. That the world hates them is evidence they’re on the right path\n\nHis marriage fell apart — he does not believe his anti-conversion was responsible — and Mr. Phelps would eventually fall in love with a Canadian woman he met online. She lived in a rural, mountainous B.C. community at the time and Mr. Phelps crossed the border to live with her.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nToday, he works at a Calgary transportation company, and is also on the board of a group called Recovering from Religion.\n\n“It’s like an AA meeting for people who need to get together with those who understand the reality of being in a toxic religious environment, and having the opportunity to talk about it, learning strategies for coping with it as they come out.”\n\nMr. Phelps is becoming a prominent member of an atheist movement seeking to rebuild the comforts and community common to religious experience, without its faith-based foundation. In time, he feels, this may go some way to help heal the hatred his father and those like him have inflicted on other humans.\n\nWhen he left Westboro, he accepted his father’s ideology, and knew he was going to hell. Now, he says, in the face of such an immoral scripture, rebellion was the only option.\n\nNational Post\n\nFind the National Post on Facebook\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
