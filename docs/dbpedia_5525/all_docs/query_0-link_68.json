Four years later, he graduated as one of the all-time leading scorers in Campbell soccer history while leading the Camels to a pair of national tournament berths. While in high school, Young was chosen by Major League Baseball scouts to represent Eastern Pennsylvania in the American Legion East-West game. He also played in an American Legion All-Star game at Connie Mack Stadium before enrolling at Campbell. However, it was on the soccer field that he made his greatest impact on Fighting Camel sports. Over his four-year career from 1967-70, Young played on Campbell teams that won 79 percent of their matches – going 48-11-4 in the process. He was a three-time All-South region performer and two-time NAIA All-District 29 and All-Area 5 standout. After the Camels compiled a record of 16-7-2 over his first two seasons, Young helped lead the team to back-to-back 16-2-1 records and District 29 and Area 5 titles in 1969 and 1970 and consecutive trips to the national tournament. His junior year output of 56 points on 24 goals and eight assists in 1969 still stands as the eighth-highest scoring season in Campbell soccer history. He followed that with 71 points on 31 goals and nine assists in 1970, which remains the fourth-highest tally in CU record books. The 1969 Camels finished fifth in the NAIA national tournament in their first-ever trip to the championship. He scored the game's only goal in the 1969 NAIA District 29 final to lift CU to its first-ever District title. He added the game-winning goal in 1969 NAIA Area 5 Championship match. Young recorded seven career hat tricks, including a six-goal game vs. East Carolina in 1970. He also scored in the 1970 NAIA Area 5 championship winning match and netted both Campbell goals in the 1970 NAIA third-place match, including the winner with 15 seconds remaining. Young was named to the 1970 NAIA National all-tournament team and was co-MVP of the team. He was also named to all-tournament teams at the Stetson Classic and Campbell Soccer Classic after helping the Camels win both events. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in physical education and health with a minor in biology, Young went on to play with Worthy Brothers in the United Soccer League in Philadelphia and led that circuit in scoring with 37 goals. In addition to teaching in the West Chester Area school district for the last 42 years, Young had continued to remain active in racquetball, road running and triathlon. He also coached boys and girls recreational, travel and high school soccer for more than four decades. Young is also a USA Soccer licensed official.\n\n2017\n\nWanda Watkins\n\n(Inducted January 2017)\n\nFor 35 years (1981-2016), Watkins served as head coach of the Campbell women's basketball team before retiring from coaching last spring. While in charge of the Camels on the court, Watkins led her teams to 549 victories, 10 appearances in Division I conference championship games and the program's first-ever trip to the NCAA tournament. Among Watkins' countless honors and achievements is the fact that more than 95 percent of her student-athletes completed their Campbell undergraduate degrees. The 1979 Campbell graduate led her teams to the 1989 Big South and 2000 Atlantic Sun Conference tournament titles. In addition, Campbell was the 1988 (co-champion) and 1991 Big South regular season champion, as well as the 2001 A-Sun regular season champion. Her 2000 team defeated Georgia State in the championship game, advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in school history, and finished with a 22-9 record. In addition to her coaching achievements, Watkins holds a special place in Campbell athletics history. She was the school's first female athletic scholarship recipient after graduating in 1975 from nearby South Johnston High School, where she was a member of the 1974 North Carolina state championship team. She served as team captain of the Campbell basketball team as a senior and captained the softball team for three years. Despite suffering an injury in her final season, Watkins was named MVP of the 1978-79 team and selected as Campbell's Outstanding Female Athlete. She now serves as Associate Athletics Director / Coaches Liaison and Senior Woman Administrator at her alma mater.\n\nBob Burke\n\n(Inducted January 2017)\n\nBob Burke followed his collegiate mentors Fred McCall and Danny Roberts into the coaching ranks immediately after his graduation in 1969. He guided Wallace-Rose Hill High School to a state Final Four appearance in two seasons before moving to the college level. In 25 years as a collegiate head coach, Burke amassed 454 career victories (and only 258 losses), including a 419-217 mark in 22 years at Chowan College. After serving a successful three-year stint as head coach at Greensboro College, Burke was an assistant coach for Campbell's 1974-75 team which posted a 25-6 record and set a school single season wins record that stands to this day. He was appointed head coach at Chowan in 1980 and led the Braves to three National Junior College Athletic Association Tournaments and twelve 20-win seasons in 13 years before the College moved to four-year status in 1993-94. One of his finest Chowan players, Nate McMillan, is now the head coach of the NBA's Indiana Pacers (and former head coach of the Seattle Super Sonics and Portland Trailblazers) following an outstanding playing career at N.C. State and later in the NBA. Burke, who served on the staff of the Campbell Basketball School for more than 30 years, left his head coaching position at Chowan in 2002 to serve as an assistant coach at the University of Hawaii and later moved on to an assistant position with the Portland Trailblazers. He was inducted into the Chowan Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Helms Center playing surface was named in his honor in 2016.\n\nAnthony Cox\n\n(Inducted January 2017)\n\nCox joined the Campbell wrestling program in 1985 and became the school's first two-time qualifier in the NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships. After finishing third in the North Carolina state championships at Goldsboro High School, where he compiled a 107-10 overall record, Cox quickly established himself as one of the country's top collegiate wrestlers at the 167-pound weight class. By the time he concluded his collegiate career as a fifth-year senior in 1990, Cox had compiled a career record of 120-20. He compiled a 26-7 record as a freshman in 1985-86; then earned his first NCAA Championship berth in 1986-87 after winning 38 of 44 matches and finishing as runner-up in the NCAA East Regional Championship. As a junior in 1987-88, Cox posted a 40-4 overall record and finished ninth in the NCAA Championships at 167 pounds, falling one place shy of gaining All-America status. He was twice named team MVP and was selected as Campbell's Outstanding Male Athlete for 1987-88.\n\n2022\n\nMarshall Lovett\n\n(Inducted August 2022)\n\nLovett entered Campbell in the fall of 1972 and immediately made an impact on the Fighting Camels' basketball team. He was named NAIA All-American as a senior after he led his team to back-to-back 20-win seasons in 1975 and 1976. A point guard, he led Coach Danny Roberts' Camels to a school-record 25 wins (with just six losses) during his junior season and followed that with a 23-4 overall record in his senior year when he was named NAIA third-team All-American. He scored 1064 points just his career, averaged 13.9 points and five steals per game as a senior, and was named Campbell's Outstanding Male Athlete in 1976. He was the ninth player to reach 1,000 career points in Campbell's senior college history and is still one of only 30 Camels to hit that mark since the 1961-62 season. In addition, he set a school track & field record with a 6-foot, 6-inch, high jump.\n\n2023"
