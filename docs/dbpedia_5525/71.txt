The son of Fred Phelps, founder of the controversial Westboro Baptist Church, calls his father’s theology “morally bankrupt.”

Nate Phelps will speak about his experiences growing up in the church in a free public lecture Thursday, March 6, sponsored by the Windsor / Essex County Atheist Society. The church has become infamous for its demonstrations against gays and lesbians.

“Any ideology that marginalizes a group of people based on whom they choose to love is morally bankrupt and I reject it,” says Phelps, executive director of the Centre for Free Inquiry Calgary.

His lecture begins at 7:30 p.m. in room 1100, Centre for Engineering Innovation.
