        "text": "In August and September 2015, Charlie and I visited Austria and Hungary, visiting the wine regions of the Wachau, Kremstal and Burgenland in Austria, and the Tokaj, Sopron, Etyek and Pannonhalma in Hungary. This post covers our stay in Austria; click here to read about our stay in Hungary.\n\nWe flew into Vienna, and spent a few days there walking around the city. Vienna is a beautiful city with many amazing palaces and museums. For the first full day in Vienna, we had a private tour guide (http://www.my-vienna-guides.at/start.html?L=4), and using Bettina Mandl to introduce us to Vienna proved to be an excellent way to get a good overview of the city.\n\nAfter Vienna, we rented a car and drove to the wine regions of the Wachau and Kremstal to spend the next five days. The Wachau is a beautiful part of the world!\n\nPrior to traveling, I had made appointments at several weinguts (wineries), and we enjoyed every visit and tasting. Everyone gave us a warm welcome, and everyone was generous with his or her time and their wines. Charlie and I had only limited experience with the wines from the Wachau and Kremstal, but we found the Grüner Veltliners and Rieslings to be exceptional. We will certainly be drinking more Austrian wines in the future!\n\nAfter our stay in the Wachau, we drove back to Vienna where I had arranged with Taste Hungary (http://tastehungary.com/) to pick us up and drive us to Budapest, stopping in the Burgenland (Austria) and Sopron (Hungary) along the way. Our two visits in Burgenland are described below.\n\nIf you have read my prior blogs, you know that I am not the best describer of wines. So, I have provided you with my overall impression, and whether I would buy the wine – my best recommendation. Additionally, if a comment about the wine is in quotes, the comment is from the person pouring the wine (winemaker, family member, etc.). More importantly, my notes should give you a good idea of what to expect if you visit. Further, for those of you not familiar with Austrian wines, white wines from the “Wachau Winegrowing Area” can be designated by members of the Vinea Wachau as a Steinfeder (the lightest style, with no more than 11.5% alcohol), Federspiel (alcohol level between 11.5% and 12.5%) or Smaragd (wines with at least 12.5% alcohol). A good description of the differences between these wine designations can be found here: http://austrianwineusa.com/2012/01/31/austrian-wine-words-steinfeder-federspiel-smaragd/.\n\nFinally, most non-German speaking wine drinkers would hesitate to ask for Austrian wines in a wine store or restaurant because of the difficulty in pronouncing the names. But, do yourself a favor – try these wines!\n\nNow on to our visits –\n\nIn the Kremstal –\n\nWeingut Geyerhof located in Oberfucha (http://www.geyerhof.at/) – visit and tasting with Maria Maier. The Maier family owns Geyerhof, and Maria is married to Josef Maier, the current winemaker and the son of Ilse and Josef Maier. Maria is heavily involved in managing Geyerhof’s organic vineyards and the Wildwux project (a joint venture with Burgenland winemaker Brigit Braunstein) (http://www.wildwux.at/). Maria was very personable and informative, and she was generous with the wines. Charlie and I really enjoyed our visit to Geyerhof, and Maria set a high bar for the remainder of our visits!\n\nWines tasted were:\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Rosensteig (cellar price of 7,80 €) – crisp, easy drinking, good acidity\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Hocher Rain (cellar price of 8,80 €) – green apple, spicy, per Maria, a “typical grüner veltliner”\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Wildwux (cellar price of 12,70 €) – delicate minerality, rich, good acidity; buy\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2013 Gaisberg (cellar price of 16,50 €) – this wine is designated as an erste lage (from one of the designated first growth vineyards in the Kremstal, Kamptal, Traisental and Wagram wine regions) apricots, good acidity, long mineral finish, creamy; buy\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2007 Gutsreserve (cellar price of 28 €) – elegant, good structure and finish\n\nRiesling 2014 Sprinzenberg (cellar price of 10,50 €) – crisp, good acidity, fresh, easy drinking; buy\n\nRiesling 2014 Johannisberg (cellar price of 13,50 €) – crisp, good acidity, more feminine/elegant than the Sprinzenberg, balanced; buy\n\nRiesling 2011 Kirchensteig (cellar price of 20,50 €) – an erste lage wine, crisp, good acidity, apricots, some honey\n\nRiesling 2012 Goldberg (cellar price of 22 €) – an erste lage wine, more complex, good acidity, would pair very well with food; buy\n\nWeisser Burgunder 2013 Ried Zasen (cellar price of 11,50 €) – the weisser burgunder grape is a pinot blanc, just a neutral taste\n\nWeisser Burgunder 2009 Ried Zasen Süß (cellar price of 16 €) – this is a sweet pinot blanc with good acidity; buy\n\nRosé Zweigelt 2012 (cellar price of 7,60 €) – a very nice dry rosé; buy\n\nZweigelt 2012 Ried Richtern (cellar price of 9,50 €) – a solid red wine\n\nIn the Wachau –\n\nDomäne Wachau in Dürnstein (http://www.domaene-wachau.at/en/start/) – we did not have an appointment, but just dropped in to the Vinothek one afternoon. Wines tasted:\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Terrassen Federspiel (cellar price of 8,60 €) – fruity, easy drinking, a good pool wine\n\nRiesling 2014 Loibenberg Federspiel (cellar price of 10,90 €) – fresh, fruity, easy drinking; buy\n\nZweigelt Rosé 2014 Himmelstiege Federspiel (cellar price of 8,90 €) – light pink, crisp, good fruit, strawberries, easy drinking; buy\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Kellenberg Smaragd (cellar price of 23 €) – good minerality, Charlie liked; I didn’t\n\nRiesling 2014 Achleiten Smaragd (cellar price of 23 €) – more body, a nice wine that would stand up to food; buy\n\nWe also tasted the Marillen-Nektar, a non-alcoholic apricot nectar (cellar price of 7,40 €) – this was really good. Throughout our stay in the Wachau, a common aperitif was apricot nectar mixed with an Austrian sparkling wine, or with sparkling water, or with a grüner veltliner. Highly recommended!\n\nWeingut Franz Hirtzberger in Spitz (http://www.hirtzberger.com/) – visit and tasting with Franz Hofbauer; a very nice visit and tasting. Like most all of the weinguts we visited, Franz Hirtzberger is a family run winery that have been winemakers for generations. The current family members are Franz Hirtzberger (I’m not sure what number) and his son, also a Franz. Franz Hofbauer is the third Franz working in the winery, and he is often described as the “non-family member Franz.” Wines tasted:\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Donaugarten Steinfelder (cellar price of 12 €) – this is their entry level grüner, easy drinking, refreshing; buy\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Rotes Tor (cellar price of 16 €) – a little more body; per Franz (and others throughout our trip), 2014 was a difficult vintage especially with the enduring rains from the first of August through mid-September; per Franz, because of the rain, the grapes did not fully ripen, and as a result, this wine was chaptalized (sugar was added)\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Honivogl Smaragd (cellar price of 50 €) – more minerality, concentrated nose\n\nSteinporz-Weissburgunder 2014 Smaragd (cellar price of 25 €) – weissburgunder is the pinot blanc grape, easy drinking\n\nSteinporz-Weissburgunder 2011 Smaragd – very different than the 2014 in both smell and taste\n\nRiesling 2014 Steinterrassen Federspiel (cellar price of 16 €) – this is their entry level riesling, crisp, nice\n\nRiesling 2014 Hochrain Smaragd (cellar price of 34 €) – creamy, concentrated; per Franz, all of the 2014 Rieslings are “shy at the moment” and need some age\n\nRiesling 2013 Hochrain Smaragd– softer, better than the 2014\n\nRiesling 2002 Singerreidel Smaragd – more mineral than fruit, a long finish, a very nice wine; buy\n\nRiesling 2009 Beerenauslese (cellar price of 43 €) – raisin, orange, a very nice sweet wine; buy\n\nThe youngest son of Franz (the older Franz) – Mathias – has started his own wine label (since his older brother, Franz (the younger Franz) will take over Weingut Franz Hirtzberger when the older Franz retires, which according to Franz Hofbauer, will be in the near term. So, if you followed all of that, we also tasted Mathias’ wines:\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Treu Federspeil (cellar price of 14 €) – just ok\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Kollmütz Smaragd (cellar price of 30 €) – just ok\n\nRiesling 2014 Zier Federspiel (cellar price of 14 €) – the best of the three; according to Franz Hofbauer, Mathias’ style is leaner, more modern\n\nWeingut Johann Donabaum in Spitz (http://weingut-donabaum.at/) (email at info@weingut-donabaum.at) – our initial visit and tasting was with Johann’s mother, then Johann joined us for the tasting.\n\nJohann told us that his parents had originally started out as a heuriger (wine tavern), but with over 200 people drinking and eating each weekend day, and his mother doing all of the cooking, it became too much and they scaled back. With 1996 being his first vintage, Johann took over the winemaking and operations from his father, Johann (there is a definite trend in this region of naming the first born son after the father!), and he started taking the weingut to new heights, catching the eyes and tastes of the likes of Jancis Robinson. Johann said his break out years were 1999/2000. Now, he sells between 50,000-80,000 bottles per year, and there is a small B&B on the property that his mother runs. This was a very enjoyable visit and tasting. Wines tasted:\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Johann Federspiel (cellar price of 8,40 €) – fresh with good acidity\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Point Federspiel (cellar price of 10 €) – more body than the Johann, nice fruit on the nose, could stand up to food\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Spitzer Point Smaragd (cellar price of 24 €) – a creamy taste, good acidity, a nice wine; buy\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Kirchweg Smaragd (cellar price of 21 €) – honey on the nose, then grassy\n\nRiesling 2014 Bergterrassen Federspiel (cellar price of 11,40 €) – I thought this wine was dull and flat\n\nRiesling 2013 Offenberg Smaragd (cellar price of 21,50 €) – floral on the nose, good acidity, a very nice wine; buy\n\nRiesling 2014 Setzberg Smaragd (cellar price of 25,50 €) – floral nose, acidic, but after it warmed up, much better\n\nTegernseerhof in Unterloiben (http://www.tegernseerhof.at/) – owned by the Mittelbach family for five generations, and Martin Mittelbach is the current winemaker. Unfortunately (for us, not Martin!), Martin was vacationing in Umbria, so we did not get to meet him. So, our visit and tasting was with Eva Scharnagl. Eva manages the business side of Tegernseerhof, and she was a wonderful host for our tasting. As an interesting side note, Eva’s sister is a sommelier at Le Bernardin in New York. Eva generously gifted us a bottle of the 2014 Grüner Veltliner Loibenberg Smaragd when we left. A really enjoyable visit and tasting! Wines tasted:\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Durnsteiner Steinfeder (cellar price of 9 €) – crisp, refreshing, good acidity; buy\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Kreutles (T-26) Federspiel – creamy with minerality, some saltiness\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Loibenberg Federspiel – good body, tannins and structure, a very nice wine; buy\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2012 Höhereck Smaragd – lots of minerality\n\nRiesling 2014 Terrassen Federspiel – floral nose, but bone dry, peaches, apricots; buy\n\nRiesling 2013 Steiner Pfaffenberg – flinty mineral, peaches, opened up as it good warmer\n\nRiesling2013 Steinertal Smaragd – flinty, smooth, a nice wine; buy\n\nRiesling 2013 Loibenberg Smaragd – pineapple, spice, a very nice wine; buy; per Eva, 2013 was one of the best vintages in 20 years, but “buy and forget for 10 years”\n\nRiesling 2013 Kellerberg Smaragd – full bodied, intense, peaches, apricots, spicy; buy\n\nWeissenkirchner 2013 Zwerithaler Smaragd – a field blend of Riesling and Grüner Veltliner, almonds, floral; buy\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2007 Loibenberg – this was a “late release” from the winery, having just been released in March 2015, grassy on the nose, more developed and nuanced, mellow; buy\n\nPinot Noir 2012 – cherries and pepper, a nice pinot\n\nBlauer Zweigelt 2012 – deep purple, fruit driven, a really nice wine; buy\n\nWeingut Rudi Pichler in Wösendorf (http://www.rudipichler.at/en/home/)– visit and tasting with Rudi and his daughter, Theresa. Rudi is an articulate and passionate winemaker, although he prefers the term “wine caretaker.” He emphasized that the “basis for our wines are our stones.” Charlie and I very much enjoyed the time we spent with Rudi and Theresa, and the wines we tasted were excellent.\n\nWines tasted:\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Federspiel – the most basic wine from this weingut, fresh, good acidity, spicy, good for every day drinking; buy\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Kollmütz Smaragd – from 1000 year old terraces, these “terraces have a deep impact of minerality,” almost smoky\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Hochrain Smaragd – minerality, “wet stones”\n\nWeissenkirchner 2014 Achleiten – “most delicate minerality”\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2012 Kollmütz Smaragd – “positive tannins”\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2008 Hochrain Smaragd – Rudi thought this was just now opening up, rich, good acidity, a very nice wine; buy\n\nWeissburgunder 2014 Kollmütz Smaragd – pinot blanc made from old vines, good fruit and acidity, would pair well with food; buy\n\nRiesling 2014 Kirchweg Smaragd – “charming,” elegant, good minerality, some lemon on the nose, a very nice wine; buy\n\nRiesling 2014 Hochrain Smaragd – flinty, salty\n\nRiesling 2014 Achleiten Smaragd – some lemon and orange, “again, charming”\n\nRiesling 2009 Kirchweg Smaragd – from magnum, good mineral and fruit flavors, a very nice wine; buy\n\nRiesling 2012 Hochrain Smaragd – from magnum, good minerality, a very nice wine; buy\n\nRiesling 2011 Achleiten Smaragd – from magnum, “this is a mineral-pure Riesling,” a very nice wine; buy\n\nNote that all of the wines were served in Zalto “Rudi Pichler” glasses (http://www.rudipichler.at/en/rudi-pichler/wine-glass/). Rudi designed these glasses for Zalto, and in addition to using these wine glasses to serve Grüner Veltliner and Riesling, Rudi thought they were great to use for Champagne. So, of course, we had to find them in a wine store in Spitz, and buy 6 of them!\n\nNikolaihof in Mautern (http://www.nikolaihof.at/en) – owned by the Saahs family, and Christine Saahs is the sister of Ilse Maier of Weingut Geyerhof. Nikolaihof has been practicing biodynamics since 1971, and became certified as biodynamic in 1998.\n\nThis visit started off strangely. I had arranged for a tour and tasting, followed by dinner at the Wine Tavern. However, when we arrived at the designated time, we were told the reservations were for dinner only, but that we could buy wines “by the glass” at half price for a tasting. The very nice waiter suggested Charlie and I each try four\n\ndifferent wines, so collectively 8 different wines. We did so, started tasting, and then ordered dinner consisting of a charcuterie plate and farm-fresh fried zucchini to accompany the wines. Of the 8 wines tasted, my favorite was the 2013 ElizabethTradition (a blend of Grüner Veltliner, Riesling and Weissburgunder), while Charlie’s favorite was the 2012 Steiner Hurd Riesling. During the meal, Mrs. Saahs came by and talked with us awhile about her wines and biodynamics. As it turned out, our visit to Nikolaihof was very nice.\n\nPichler-Krutzler in Oberloiben (http://www.pichler-krutzler.at/) – this weingut was started in 2006 by the husband and wife team of Elisabeth Pichler-Krutzler and Erich Krutzler. Elisabeth is the daughter of F.X. Pichler, and Erich is from a winemaking family in Burgenland (which is why a Blaufränkisch makes its way into their wine portfolio). Pichler-Krutzler doesn’t designate their wines as Seinfelder, Federspiel or Smaragd, because Erich believes the vineyard, or terroir, is more important than the alcohol level (which can fluctuate from year to year because of the weather). Our tasting was with Erich in their home’s backyard garden (the home is also the home of F.X. Pichler and his wife). This visit and tasting was one of Charlie’s and my favorites, and the Pichler-Krutzler wines were among the best we tasted.\n\nWines tasted:\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Klostersatz – easy drinking, refreshing, “not too fancy,” a very nice wine; buy\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Supperin – from 50-80 year old vines, more minerality and body, spicy with some saltiness; buy\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Kellerberg – the taste and aroma of wet stones, good body, complex; buy\n\nRiesling 2014 Pfafffenberg – “one of the best sites for Riesling,” “very transparent, very distinguished,” refreshing, some citrus on the back palate, a very good wine; buy\n\nRiesling 2014 In der Wand – yellow fruit, juicy good acidity; buy\n\nRiesling 2013 Loibenberg – good acidity and ripeness, “juicy tasting Riesling,” buy\n\nRiesling 2013 Kellerberg – a later harvest from this single vineyard, so a little more sweet, balanced, “much too young, in 10 years will be great;” buy\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2012 Fab No.43 – named after the cask number, grapes from Kellerberg, unfliltered, oak on the nose, nice\n\nBlaufränkisch 2012 Weinberg – from 30 year old vines in the Burgenland, “can age 10 to 15 years,” good tannins and structure; buy\n\nWeingut Emmerich Knoll in Unterloiben (http://www.knoll.at/) – Knoll wines are easily recognized by their distinct label that depicts an ornate image of St. Urban, the patron saint of wine growing. This label has been on the Knoll wines since 1962. A very nice visit and tasting with Emmerich III, the current winemaker.\n\nWe tasted several wines, but I didn’t write all of them down. I do have notes on the following wines:\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Ried Kreutles Federspiel – good acidity, juicy, young\n\nGrüner Veltliner 2014 Ried Loibenberg Smaragd – good acidity; fresh, a very nice wine; buy\n\nLoibner 2014 Traminer Auslese – a sweet wine with good acidity; buy\n\nNow on to the Burgenland –\n\nEsterházy in Trausdorf (http://esterhazywein.at/) – this visit was a recommendation from Taste Hungary, and the visit and tasting (with food produced from the Esterházy farms) was very nice. Plus, they have two of the best labels I have ever seen (see them below)! Esterházy recently completed a large, modern winery (the most modern winery we saw during our stay), and its current production is over 500,000 bottles. We tasted several wines, the best of which were:\n\n2013 Zweigelt (cellar price of 8 €) – a light red wine with cherries on the nose and palate, a very nice wine for the price; buy\n\n2013 Blaufränkisch (cellar price of 8 €) – more full bodied, higher tannins, a good wine for the price; buy\n\n2011 Estoras (cellar price of 12 €) – a blend of 30% merlot, 60% blaufränkisch and 10% cabernet sauvignon, another solid wine for the price; buy\n\n2011 Tesoro (cellar price of 45 €) – this is the winery’s flagship wine, smooth, good tannins, a nice wine; buy\n\nKracher in Illmitz (http://www.kracher.at/en/) – Charlie and I had never tasted Kracher’s wines, but I had read a great deal about them. So, I asked Gábor with Taste Hungary to try to set up a tasting with Gerhard Kracher. Gábor was successful in setting up a really great visit and tasting. Gerhard is a personable and, from my impression, fun-loving guy. The tasting room had an almost party like atmosphere, and I think that was in large part because Gerhard was there pouring his wines. The tasting included bleu cheese with wine jellies, and “little, spicy sausages” that Gerhard said we had to try. They were great with the sweet wines!\n\nAlso, for those of you who are not familiar with Kracher wines, the trockenbeerenauslese (TBA) wines are numbered (e.g., No. 3, No. 7, No. 12). The higher the number, the sweeter the wine. Also, the TBA wines can be fermented and matured in either stainless steel (Zwischen den Seen) or new oak barrels (Nouvelle Vague). So, look at the top of the front labels for these words. Wines tasted:\n\nBrut Rosé – an Austrian sekt (sparkling wine) made from chardonnay, pinot blanc and zweigelt, light pink, a good sipping sparkling wine made in the méthode champenoise\n\nCuveé Auslese 2012 – a blend of chardonnay and welschriesling, sweet with good acidity\n\nCuveé Beerenauslese 2012 – a blend of welschriesling and chardonnay, sweet, orange marmalade, papaya\n\nZweigelt Beerenauslese 2012 – a very nice wine, “nice for chocolate desserts;” buy\n\n2012 Scheurebe No. 3 (Zwischen den Seen) – more fruity, sweet, but good acidity, a very nice wine; buy\n\n2005 Traminer No. 3 (Nouvelle Vague) – caramel on the nose and palate, a wonderful wine; buy\n\n2000 Scheurebe No. 5 (Zwischen den Seen) – a beautiful golden color, dried apricots; buy\n\n2012 Welschriesling No. 7 (Zwischen den Seen) – more dried apricots; buy\n\n2010 Auslese No. 11 – nearly 400 g/L of sugar, one of the thickest wines I have ever seen, but it had good acidity and was quite good; buy\n\nNotable lodging and restaurants during our stay in Austria –\n\nWhile in Vienna, we stayed at Hotel Sans Souci (http://www.sanssouci-wien.com/en/index.html). We stayed at the Hotel Richard Löwenherz in Dürnstein (http://www.richardloewenherz.at/en/) while in the Wachau. I would highly recommend both of these hotels.\n\nWhile in Vienna, we ate dinner at Steirereck (https://www.steirereck.at/en/restaurant/). Charlie and I both selected the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairings (although we selected different items for some of the courses).\n\nSteirereck is considered one of the top restaurants in the world, and while we enjoyed the meal, and the wine pairings were excellent, neither of us thought our dinner was outstanding. And, despite what the Michelin guide says, Steirereck is not air conditioned!\n\nOn the other hand, while we were in the Wachau, we did have one of the best dinners we have ever eaten in the world at Landhaus Bacher in Mautern (http://www.landhaus-bacher.at/home/). Charlie and I both had the 6 course tasting menu with wine pairings, and the meal was outstanding!\n\nWe also had some nice lunches while in the Wachau. The best lunch (a great duck dish) was at Loibnerhof in Unterloiben (http://www.loibnerhof.at/). This restaurant is owned by the Knoll family, and serves a wide selection of (only) Knoll wines. We also had a very nice lunch at Hofmeisterei in Wösendorf. This restaurant is affiliated with Weingut Franz Hirtzberger, so it serves a wide selection of (only) Franz Hirtzberger wines. Finally, we had a nice lunch at Restaurant Jamek in Joching (http://www.weingut-jamek.at/restaurant.php?id=13). This restaurant is owned by Weingut Jamek, and we had a really nice bottle of their 2007 Zweigelt (the JJJ 90).\n\nPracticalities –\n\nWe rented our car in Vienna from Sixt, a German car rental agency. We were originally going to take the high-speed train from Vienna to Budapest and back. But, we changed our plans after reading the Taste Hungary web site, and our choice proved to be a good one. Not only because the drive with Virág and Tibor (guide and driver from Taste Hungary) was most enjoyable, but also because of the problems at the Budapest train station during our stay.\n\nYou should be aware that there is a speed trap outside of Wösendorf (on the Dürnstein side). We had never encountered a true speed trap in Europe before this trip, but this was about an obvious of a trap as you will ever see. So, don’t exceed 50 km/h in this area!\n\nHeurigers (wine taverns) are plentiful in the Wachau. If you see a straw wreath (or what looked to us like a straw ship’s wheel), it means the heuriger is open.\n\nI have seen several American web sites that state that “Wachau” is pronounced VOC aw. However, throughout our stay, the emphasis was on the second syllable, or va COW. Similarly, I always pronounced Grüner Veltliner as GREW ner VELT lee ner. However, when I said this grape/wine for the first time to an Austrian, she didn’t know what I was saying. Say [GREW ner] va LEEN ah, or vet LEEN er (but always with the emphasis on the second syllable).\n\nWhile you are in Austria, try an Almdudler, a non-alcoholic drink that is really good and refreshing (especially on those hot days in Vienna)!\n\nTo continue reading about Charlie’s and my trip, and it’s conclusion in Hungary, click here\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis is a continuation of our trip that started in Austria. Click here to read about our visit to that country.\n\nAfter our stay in the Wachau, we drove back to Vienna where I had arranged with Taste Hungary (http://tastehungary.com/) to pick us up and drive us to Budapest, stopping in the Sopron wine region along the way. Taste Hungary is owned by Gábor and Carolyn Bánfalvi, and both were great in making sure Charlie and I had a wonderful first visit to Hungary. Our stay in Hungary included a great visit to Tokaj, where Gábor led the way in our visits to three pincészets (or wineries; you will also see “pince” or “birtok” to describe a winery). Gábor also arranged an “old Aszús” tasting at his wine shop in Budapest – the Tasting Table (http://tastehungary.com/tasting-table-shop/). Upon returning to Vienna, we stopped in the Etyek and Pannonhalma wine regions in Hungary. Our guide to and from Vienna and Budapest, and while in Budapest, was Virág Lastóczki. Virág is a great, personable and knowledgeable guide. Charlie and I highly recommend you contact Gábor if you are interested in the wines from Tokaj and the other wine regions in Hungary, and we highly recommend Taste Hungary and Virág to lead you through Budapest and Hungary.\n\nBudapest is a vibrant city with some beautiful buildings and vistas. We enjoyed our stay in Budapest and Hungary, and when you think that the roads and modern infrastructure were practically all built after 1989, the progress is amazing.\n\nWhile in Budapest, we took one of Taste Hungary’s Culinary Walks with Virág, and that is a great way to experience the food culture of Budapest. The highlight of our visit to Budapest was the private Danube river cruise (really a nice-sized speed boat) that Taste Hungary had arranged for us one evening. To cruise and speed along the Danube in the evening, and then at night – with all of the buildings lit up – was remarkable.\n\nNow on to our wine tastings –\n\nIn the Sopron wine region –\n\nOur first stop in Hungary was in the Sopron wine region where we visited Jandl Borászat [Jandl Winery] in Fertőrákos (http://www.jandl.hu/). Our visit and tasting (with a cheese and charcuterie plate) was with owner/winemaker Kálmán Jandl (or Jandl Kálmán in Hungarian, as the last name is always written first). The Jandl family has been making wine in Sopron for six generations. Wines tasted:\n\n2014 Kékfrankos Rosé – the Kékfrankos grape is called the Blaufränkisch grape in Austria, salmon colored, nice, smooth, the best wine we tasted; buy\n\n2013 Kékfrankos – a simple wine\n\n2013 Missio – a Soproni Kékfrankos, or selection of the best grapes, dry, ok\n\n2012 Cabernet Franc – much more robust, but dryer on the palate\n\n2012 Soproni Shiraz – the vines came from the Côte-Rôtie, but when I asked Mr. Jandl why he called this wine a Shiraz, not a Syrah, his answer was that this wine was more fruity, jammy than a typical syrah; this wine was more like a shiraz\n\n2012 Sorproni Merlot – just ok\n\nIn the Tokaj –\n\nTo understand the wines of Tokaj (Tokaj is the region, and Tokaji is the wine produced in the region – both pronounced “Toe kye”), you have to understand the history of Hungary. By the end of the 17th century Tokaji was considered one of the world’s greatest wines. Royal decrees were issued to safeguard quality, and the first ever known system of classified growths was devised in Tokaj in the mid-17th century. The 18th and 19th centuries saw the wines from Tokaj reach their greatest height. Imperial courts throughout Europe and Russia purchased and drank Tokaji. King Louis XIV called the sweet wines of Tokaj – vinum regum, rex vinorum – wine of kings, king of wines.\n\nYet, after such a glorious past, the region was decimated by two World Wars and the advent of communism. Under communism, winemaking was centralized into a single state-owned holding, and quantity, not quality, became the objective. When communism fell in 1989, the winemakers of Tokaj had to build their vineyards and their winemaking from scratch. As several people told us, when you lose 40-50 years of history, you don’t just lose years, you lose the link to your past and the knowledge that is passed from generation to generation.\n\nThe year 1989 saw the beginning of a vigorous renaissance in the Tokaj. With the influx of substantial money from foreign investors, the replanting of vineyards and the building of new facilities started. Tokaj began its path back to its past glory. We visited three pincészets in Tokaj, and each one is helping shape the future of this region.\n\nBut, before I describe our visits, a short introduction to the wines of Tokaj might be helpful. Sweet Tokaji wines are typically a blend of Furmint, Hárslevelű and Sárga Muskotály grapes. A base dry white wine is first made (usually with Furmint grapes), then this base wine is mixed with Aszú berries (botrytised, shriveled grapes that are picked berry by berry). During harvest, it can take up to 30 passes in the vineyards to pick the botrytised gapes at the optimal time. These botrytised grapes were originally picked and placed into 20 liter wooden tubs called puttony. Traditionally, the concentration (sweetness) of the Tokaji wines was defined by the number of puttony added to the base. Today, the “puttonoys” is based on the amount of the residual sugar in the final wine. The higher the puttynos, the higher the sugar concentration. The top Aszús are 5 or 6 Puttynos.\n\nSzamorodni wines are made from grapes picked at the end of the harvest. Whole clusters (not the berry by berry picking done for Aszús) are used to make szamorodni, and the quantity of botrytised grapes in the cluster will determine the sweetness of the wine. There can be a dry szamorodni if the whole clusters do not have many botrytised grapes.\n\nEszencia (or Essencia) is the richest and rarest of Tokaj’s sweet wines (although it cannot technically be called a wine because of its low alcohol level). Eszencia is made from the free run juice of the Aszú berries. The sugar concentration of Eszencia typically ranges from 500-700 g/L, but in certain years can be as high as 900 g/L.\n\nNow on the our visits –\n\nDemeter Zoltán in Tokaj (http://www.demeterzoltan.hu/) – I had asked Gábor to see if he could arrange a visit with István Szepsy and/or Zoltán Demeter. Remember last names are written first in Hungarian, but for my blog, their given names are first (but the name of Zoltán’s pincészet, and the name on the wine label, is Demeter Zoltán). Mr. Szepsy could not meet with us, but Gábor was successful in arranging a visit with Zoltán.\n\nAs Zoltán said “even though we had 500 years of history in making wine in Tokaj, we had to rediscover the vines, the wine and the quality.” Zoltán appears to be in large part, a one-man show. Zoltán told us that he wants to have control over every aspect of his winemaking, because only he is accountable for the wine, only he fully understands the vision for his wines. Zoltán is widely regarded as one of Hungary’s most accomplished winemakers. Zoltán and István Szepsy were the first ones to make quality dry white wines from the traditional grapes used to make the famous and historical Tokaji sweet wines. Throughout our stay in Hungary, Charlie and I very much enjoyed the dry Furmints, and if you have never tasted this wine, try one and see what you think!\n\nWines tasted:\n\n2013 Veres – a dry Furmint, crisp, refreshing, but bone dry, closure is a glass stopper (the closure used by Zoltán on all of his dry wines), good concentration; buy\n\n2013 Oszhegy – made with the Sárga Muskotály (or yellow muscat) grapes, some spice and saltiness\n\n2013 Boda Vielles Vignes – a dry Furmint made from 100 year old vines, pears, some stone fruits\n\n2010 Eszter – a Tokaji cuvee (a főbor; called a szamarodni by other Tokaj pincészets) made with 60% Hárslevelű and 40% Sárga Muskotály, per Zoltán “a beautiful wine,” honey with some citrus, dried apricot, good acidity; buy\n\nTokaji Aszú 2007 Holdvolgy (6 puttonyos) – a single vineyard aszú, 215 g/L of residual sugar, cinnamon, dried apricots, sweet but a good level of acidity\n\nTokaji Aszú 2008 (6 puttonyos) – 305g/L of residual sugar, honey colored, dried apricots, good acidity; buy\n\nHudácskó Pincészet in Bodrogkisfalud (http://hudacsko-pince.hu/index-en.html) – we had a wonderful visit with Anita Hudácskó that included a home-cooked traditional Hungarian meal paired with Hudácskó wines. Anita made the best roasted potatoes that Charlie and I have ever eaten!\n\nAnita Hudácskó in the cellars of Hudácskó Pincészet\n\nWe drank several wines with our lunch, but our favorites (buy wines) were:\n\n2013 Hárslevelű – a little sweet with good acidity; buy\n\n2013 Lapis dűlő (or vineyard) – a late harvest wine, sweet with good acidity, very enjoyable; buy\n\n2006 Szamorodni – another very nice sweet wine with good acidity; buy\n\n2007 Aszú (6 puttonyos) – honey on the nose and palate, good acidity; buy\n\nWe also drank the 2013 Sárga Muskotály, 2007 Szamorodni (dry), 2013 Furmint Sátorhegy, 2013 Furmint Lapis, 2013 Katalin Cuvée and 2003 Eszencia.\n\nErzsébet Pince in Tokaj (http://erzsebetpince.hu/eng/) – a wonderful visit and tasting with Hajnalka (Hajni) Prácser. Hajni is the daughter of the winery’s founder, Erzsébet Prácser, and together with her brother, Miklos, now run Erzsébet Pince. Of special interest are the cellars that were built in the 1700’s, and that formely served as the fermenting and aging cellars for the tsars and tsarinas of Russia. I had originally asked Gábor to arrange a tasting of Erzsébet Pince’s full portfolio of dry wines, as well as a vertical tasting of their Aszús (11 dry wines and 7 aszús). I don’t know what I was thinking! We wisely decided to scale back on the dry wines.\n\nWines tasted:\n\n2011 Zafír dűlő (vineyard) – tight as first, but opened up with some air and warmth, elegant but with good structure\n\n2011 Betsek dűlő – made with 95% hárslevelű, per Hajni “very harmonious, together,” “great character, great minerality,” good structure and acidity, a very nice wine; buy\n\n2013 Király dűlő – a dry furmint, more aromatic, peaches\n\n2012 Király dűlő – I preferred the 2013\n\n2013 Aszú (6 puttynos) – honey, concentrated\n\n2010 Aszú (6 puttynos) – sweet with good acidity, floral, good balance, concentrated; buy\n\n2008 Aszú (5 puttynos) – the oak comes through\n\n2002 Aszú (5 puttynos) – softer, per Hajni “more sauternes style,” “in a perfect state, harmonious;” buy\n\n2003 Aszúeszencia – this category has more than 6 puttynos, but no longer exists; spicy, tangerine, dried apricots; buy\n\n1999 Aszú (5 puttynos) – sherry colored, with a sherry nose, dry finish\n\n1993 Aszú (5 puttynos) – their first vintage, dark like a madeira, good acidity, some smokiness, spicy as opposed to sweet; buy\n\nIn the Etyek wine region –\n\nHernyák Birtok­ in Etyek (http://www.hernyak.hu/eng.html) – a very nice visit and tasting (with a cheese and charcuterie plate) with Valéria Hernyák. We tasted several wines, but our favorite (buy) wine was the 2014 Cuvée 2091 (2091 is the city code for Etyek).\n\nIn the Pannonhalma wine region –\n\nPannonhalma Abbey Winery (Apátsági Pincészet) (http://www.pannonhalmibor.com/) and Viator restaurant (http://viator.co.hu/en/) in Győr – we had a fantastic lunch at Viator, paired with 5 wines (4 whites and1 red) made by the Abbey. Viator is housed in a very modern building at the base of the Abbey, and takes a modern approach to Hungarian food and ingredients. This was the best meal we had in Hungary, and we would highly recommend it!\n\nSpecial Tastings in Budapest –\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Charlie and I had a fantastic adventure on the Danube one evening. Since we were not able to meet with István Szepsy, I had asked Gábor to select some Szepsy wines for our Danube River cruise. Gábor selected the 2013 Úrágya (a dry furmint), the 2013 Szent Tamás (a dry furmint), the 2009 Szamorodni and the 2007 Aszú (6 puttonyos). All four of these wines were great, and all four were buy wines! After drinking his wines, it is clear why Szepsy wines receive the very highest accolades.\n\nOur final – and spectacular – tasting in Budapest was a special “old Aszús” tasting that Gábor put together for Charlie and me at his wine shop, the Tasting Table. This tasting (with foie gras, bleu cheese and charcuterie) included single vineyard and single varietal Aszús, as well as a 1956 Aszú from Oremus. Wine tasted:\n\n2001 Hétszőlő Azsú Hárslevelű (5 puttonyos)\n\n1999 Hétszőlő Aszú Muskotalyos (6 puttonyos)\n\n2002 Disznókő Aszú Hetedik Zeta (6 puttonyos)\n\n1992 Disznókő Aszú (5 puttonyos)\n\n1975 Oremus Aszú (5 puttonyos)\n\n1972 Oremus Aszú (5 puttonyos)\n\n1956 Oremus Aszú (5 puttonyos)\n\nMy favorites were the 1972, 1956 and 1999. Gábor used the Coravin to pour these 7 old Aszús, so we were able to pack the bottles after the tasting, and bring them home to enjoy over the next few months. If you are ever in Budapest, check out the Tasting Table, as all of these old Aszús, as well as a wide selection of other Hungarian wines, are available to purchase.\n\nPracticalities –\n\nWe stayed at the Four Seasons Gresham Palace in Budapest (http://www.fourseasons.com/budapest/), and I would highly recommend it.\n\nThe traffic in Budapest can become a huge traffic jam. Roads and bridges (including the Chain Bridge) can be closed for the day, with little or no notice. So, what should be a short taxi ride can turn into a very long taxi ride.\n\nAlthough Hungary is in the European Union, its currency is not the Euro. Rather, Hungary’s official currency is the Forint, designated as Ft or HUF.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIn January 2007, Charlie and I, plus our good friends Terry and David, spent 2+ weeks in Chile and Argentina. The objective of our trip was to visit top flight wineries, meet with the winemakers when possible, and taste the best wines each of these wineries had to offer. The trip was arranged through Brian Pearson of Santiago Adventures (now Upscale Travel) (http://upscapetravel.com/our-experiences/food-wine/). We had a private guide and driver for Chile (Jean Albert Rauld/Bernardo), as well as for Argentina. You should contact Brian if you are planning a trip to either of these countries, as we had a fantastic trip!\n\nWe flew into Santiago, and started our journey from there. While in Chile, we also visited Valparaiso and Viña de Mar.\n\nBelow are the wineries and wines we tasted, and my notes (albeit brief) on each of these wines. I have indicated my favorite wines with a “buy” following the wine’s description.\n\nCHILE (But, if you want to read about Argentina first, click here).\n\nCasa Marin (http://www.casamarin.cl/) in the San Antiono Valley; great visit and tasting with the winemaker, Carola Vasquez. Wines tasted:\n\nSauvignon Blanc 2005 Laurel Vineyard – crisp, with good acidity; very nice as an aperitif; buy\n\nPinot Noir 2003 Litoral – very oaky/smokey (Carola thought the new barrels had overwhelmed the fruit, so poured a 2004 pinot to show us the difference)\n\nPinot Noir 2004 Lo Abarca – this was a very nice pinot; red fruits on the nose and palate; buy\n\nSauvignon Gris 2006 Estero Vineyard – very crisp, spicy; very nice as an aperitif; buy\n\nMatetic (http://matetic.com/) in the San Antonio Valley; very nice visit and tasting with the winemaker, Paula Cardenas. Wines tasted:\n\nEQ 2005 Sauvignon Blanc – very nice, mellow; long finish; would go best with food; buy\n\nEQ 2005 Pinot Noir – sort of smokey, but not overwhelming; a little pepper on the nose and palate\n\nEQ 2005 Syrah – tasted very tight and closed; did get better with some air\n\nViñedo Chadwick (http://www.vinedochadwick.cl/) in the Maipo Valley; this was a fabulous visit and tasting with Mercedes Espindola and Margarita Aguilera at the Chadwick home. Wine tasted:\n\nChadwick 2002 – this is 100 percent Cabernet Sauvignon and was a very, very good wine, on the nose, concentrated fruit, and on the palate, very well balanced, smooth and elegant, full mouth feel with a lingering finish; buy\n\nAlmaviva (http://www.almavivawinery.com/) in the Maipo Valley; a vertical tasting of the 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2004:\n\n1999 – herbaceous nose, but blew off with a little time in the glass; smooth and elegant\n\n2000 – ripe tannins; smooth and elegant on the palate\n\n2001 – again, a little herbaceous on the nose; dark chocolate and plums on the palate\n\n2004 – same herbaceous nose; red and black fruits on the palate, with a hint of cinnamon on the back palate\n\nAfter Almaviva, we had a wonderful lunch at Fundacion Origen (http://fundacionorigenchile.org/eng/), an organic agricultural school in Pirque. This was a recommendation from Brian that I was somewhat skeptical about. However, we were treated like royalty by all of the staff, and we could not have enjoyed our visit and lunch more.\n\nConcha y Toro (http://www.conchaytoro.com/?lang=en_us) in the Maipo Valley; a vertical tasting of the Don Melchor 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997 and 2004 with Francisca Hederra, sommelier for Concha y Toro. Wines tasted:\n\n1989 – mature; menthol on the nose (we were repeatedly told that this is a common characteristic of the Maipo Valley cabs, because of the large number of Eucalyptus trees near the vineyards)\n\n1991 – menthol on the nose, livelier than the 1989, a hint of soy sauce on the palate\n\n1993 – not much to say about this wine\n\n1995 – pepper and leather on the nose, mellow\n\n1997: bitter chocolate on the nose, nothing else really to say\n\n2004 (we were supposed to have the 2003, but they said they had none to pour) – almost vanilla on the nose; smooth, nice tannins, certainly the best of the vintages we tasted\n\nAntiyal (http://antiyal.com/) in the Maipo Valley; fantastic visit with Marina Espinoza; Marina’s husband, Alvaro, is the winemaker, and both own this small organic, biodynamic winery. We are now experts on biodynamic farming thanks to Marina!\n\nWines tasted:\n\nKuyen 2004 – cabernet sauvignon/syrah blend; smooth, good fruit; buy\n\nAntiyal 2004 – carmenere/cab/syrah blend; very smooth; dark fruit on the nose and palate; long finish; buy\n\nAltair (http://altairwines.com/en/tabs/our-state/) in the Cachapoal Valley; this a beautiful winery overlooking the Cachapoal Valley. We also had lunch here, with wine pairings. A great visit and lunch. Wines tasted:\n\nAltair 2002 and 2003 – cabernet sauvignon/carmenere/merlot blend (also syrah and cabernet franc in the 2003), good structure and concentration, full bodied, red fruits on the nose and palate, long finish; both buy\n\nSideral 2002 and 2003 – primarily a cabernet sauvignon and merlot blend, very nice wine, black currant on the nose and palate; both buy\n\nCasa Silva (http://www.casasilva.cl/home) in the Colchagua Valley; we tasted some of their wines, but nothing really stood out. We did stay several nights at Casa Silva, and I would highly recommend it for lodging.\n\nMontes (http://www.monteswines.com/en/our_history_the_beginning_of_our_adventure.php) in the Colchagua Valley; visit included a jeep ride up to the mirador on the hillside overlooking winery.\n\nWines tasted:\n\nSauvignon Blanc 2006 classic series – crisp, with good acidity, very nice aperitif; buy\n\nChardonnay 2005 Alpha – strong herbaceous nose, nothing but oak on the palate\n\nCabernet Sauvignon 2004 Alpha (includes 15 percent merlot) – black pepper on the nose, black currant on the palate, a very good QPR wine; buy\n\nAlpha M 2003 (cabernet sauvignon/merlot/cab franc/petit verdot) – smooth, black cherries, buy\n\nFolly 2004 (syrah) – powerful, but smooth, blackberries and mocha; buy\n\nViu Manent (http://www.viumanent.cl/?login=ok) in the Colchagua Valley; a vertical tasting of the Viu 1 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2004, a malbec/cabernet sauvignon blend; also lunch and a carriage ride through the vineyards. Wines tasted:\n\n1999 – nose of forest and truffles, smooth; buy\n\n2001 – leather on the nose, very different nose and taste than the 1999\n\n2003 – plum and blackberry on the nose, smooth mouth feel, some spice, long finish; buy\n\n2004 – cassis and black cherry on the nose, smooth, long finish; buy\n\nCasa Lapostolle/Clos Apalta (http://en.lapostolle.com/) in the Colchagua Valley; wines tasted:\n\nCuvee Alexandre 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon – blackberry and fig, a pretty nice wine\n\nSauvignon Blanc 2005 – not much to this wine\n\nClos Apalta (vertical of 2002, 2003, 2004) – I don’t know if my palate was tired, or what, but I found the 2002 to be terrible and the 2003 and 2004 to be just ok\n\nMiguel Torres (http://migueltorres.cl/en/miguel-torres.php) in the Curico Valley. Wines tasted:\n\nCordillera 2001 (carignane/syrah/merlot) – this is a very nice wine for about $20, raspberries and ripe fruit; buy\n\nManso de Velasco 2003 (cabernet sauvignon) – black currant and fig, very enjoyable; buy\n\nConde de Superunda 2003 (a tempranillo blend) – black currant and dark chocolate; a nice wine, but not worth the $50+ price tag\n\nEcheverria (http://www.echewine.com/home.html) in the Curico Valley; a very nice visit and tasting with the winemaker, Matias Aguirre. Wines tasted:\n\nCarmenere 2006 – fruity and simple\n\nCabernet Sauvignon 2003 Limited Edition – a little menthol on the nose, black cherries, well balanced, very drinkable\n\nLate Harvest Sauvignon Blanc 2005 – very nice nose, orange peel, nice taste\n\nAltacima (http://altacima.cl/home_english.htm) in the Curico Valley; tasting with the assistant winemaker, Juan Pablo Carro Coronado. This was a fantastic visit, tasting and lunch at the Schroeder family home! Wines tasted:\n\nChardonnay 2005 – fresh, not oaky; butterscotch on the nose, a very pleasant chardonnay\n\nLate Harvest Gewurtztraminer 2006 – orange blossoms on the nose and on the palate\n\n6.330, vintage 2003 (cabernet sauvignon/syrah/merlot/petit verdot) – very pleasant nose, good tannins and mouth feel, a very nice wine; buy\n\nErrazuriz (http://www.errazuriz.com/?q=en/frontpage) in the Aconcagua Valley; joining our tasting and lunch was Ricardo Grellet Almerighi, who we were told was one of the finest sommeliers in Chile. Ricardo was at the winery to train the staff. This was another wonderful visit and tasting, and in honor of our visit, the winery flew the US flag at the front of the winery. Our guide was Maria Eugenia Pavez; wines tasted:\n\nSauvignon Blanc 2005 Casablanca single vineyard – fresh and very pleasant, better with food (Ricardo suggested serving with a white fish with a light sauce, also scallops); buy\n\nSangiovese 2004 single vineyard -herbaceous nose; a little black pepper on the palate (Ricardo suggested wild game)\n\nCarmenere 2004 single vineyard – the best 100 percent carmenere we tasted; wonderful nose, fruit forward (Ricardo suggested red meat with a red wine sauce); buy\n\nLa Cumbre 2004 (shiraz) – nice nose, smooth (Ricardo suggested goat or maybe lamb, both simply prepared with salt and pepper); buy\n\nDon Maximiano Founders Reserve 2002 (cabernet sauvignon/cabernet franc) – this was a very good wine, some alcohol on the nose, but still a pleasant, smooth; long finish (Ricardo suggested rabbit [apparently fairly common in Chile] or a mushroom risotto); buy\n\nSena 2003 (mainly cabernet sauvignon and merlot) – this is a post-Mondavi joint venture wine, an excellent wine, chocolate on the nose and palate (Ricardo suggested serving this by itself after dinner, or with a dish with black truffles at dinner); buy\n\nWhile we were in the Aconcagua Valley, we stayed at the Hotel Termas de Jahuel (http://www.jahuel.cl/2013/index.php#!/pageHome). During our stay, Brian had arranged a tasting of wines from von Siebenthal (http://vinavonsiebenthal.com/visit_us.html). Since the winery was closed for a pre-harvest holiday, Brian had the wines brought to the hotel. We tasted the Parcela #7 2004, Carmenere 2005, Carabantes 2004 and Montelig 2004, and all were enjoyable.\n\nWe then drove over the Andes to Mendoza, Argentina\n\nARGENTINA\n\nAlta Vista (http://www.altavistawines.com/home.php) in the Lújan de Cuyo; wines tasted:\n\nTorrontes Premium 2006 – very aromatic and fruity nose (despite some postings about Torrontes being a wine that Argentina should market, I thought this wine was disappointing; it has a great nose, but what you expect from the nose, doesn’t deliver on the palate)\n\nMalbec Premium 2005 – very tannic, dry and astringent\n\nCabernet Sauvignon Premium 2004 and Malbec Grande Reserve 2004 – nice enough wines, but nothing to seek out\n\nAchaval Ferrer (http://achaval-ferrer.com/) in the Lújan de Cuyo. I expected this to be a great visit and tasting, based on my direct communications with Santiago Achaval and Patricia Lambert. I was very much disappointed. A relatively new tourism person gave the tour and we tasted primarily barrel samples of some of the components of the 2006 Quimera, as well as a barrel sample of the 2006 Mirador and 2006 Altamira (all while standing in a small barrel room). The only bottled wines we tasted were the Mendoza Malbec 2005, Quimera 2004 and the 2004 Dolce. I did think the 2004 Quimera was excellent.\n\nViña Alicia (http://www.vinaalicia.com/bodegaIng.php) in the Lújan de Cuyo; a great tasting with Gustavo Arizu, Alicia’s middle son. Wines tasted:\n\nMalbec 2003 and Cuarzo 2004 (petit verdot/carignan/grenache noir) – both of these wines were excellent, and were wines I immediately sought out to purchase upon returning home. We also had the Cuarzo 2003 at Cabana Las Lilas on the last day we were in Buenos Aires, and like the 2004, it was excellent. I highly recommend these wines!\n\nCatena Zapata (http://www.catenawines.com/) in the Lújan de Cuyo – We were supposed to taste the Luca, Angelica and Alta, but that didn’t happen. This is a very commercial operation. Wines tasted:\n\nBonarda – this wine was so bad that I didn’t even look at the bottle to get the details\n\nEstiba Reservada 2002 (a “poncho” bottle) – a nice nose and red fruit on the palate, however it didn’t make my “buy” list\n\nAn interesting footnote to our visit happened a few years later. Laura Catena was a guest poster on the Robert Parker bulletin board, and I wrote her and told her what a poor visit we had. Laura was most gracious, and had her local distributor hand deliver to me a bottle of the Zapata Nicolas Catena 2006. This wine was very, very good, and one that I would buy.\n\nMiguel Escorihuela Gascon 2002* (malbec blend): we had this with dinner at Mallman’s 1884 (http://1884restaurante.com.ar/) restaurant in Mendoza. We called ahead and had the restaurant decant the wine for an hour before we arrived. This was an excellent dinner, with an excellent wine.\n\nViña Cobos (http://www.vinacobos.com/en) in the Lújan de Cuyo; a wonderful tour and tasting with Andrea Marchiori, one of the owners/winemakers. Paul Hobbs winery had arranged for Andrea to meet with us, and it was a great visit. Viña Cobos was building its own winery, but the winery was not yet complete. As such, Andrea had us taste several barrel samples of the 2006 chardonnay, merlot, malbec (from 2 different/distinct regions) and cabernet sauvignon.\n\nTerrazas de los Andes (http://www.terrazasdelosandes.com/index.cfm?) in the Lújan de Cuyo; our tasting was on the veranda of the guest house, which looked to be a great place to stay. Wines tasted:\n\nChardonnay 2005 – soft, not too oaky\n\nMalbec Afincado 2004 – pleasant nose, red fruit on the palate, good tannins\n\nCabernet Sauvignon Afincado 2002 – good nose, red fruit; smooth with good tannins; buy\n\nCheval des Andes 2002 (cabernet sauvignon/malbec) – this was a very enjoyable wine, smooth with very good tannins; buy\n\nCarlos Pulenta (http://www.pulentaestate.com/en/index.php) in the Lújan de Cuyo (our tasting was at lunch at La Bourgogne which is located at the winery). We started off with 4 different wines (2 whites and 2 reds) from the Tomero line, and they were all unremarkable. We also had the Vistalba Corte B, which was also unremarkable. We then had the Vistalba 2004 Corte A (cabernet sauvignon/malbec/bonarda), which was a very nice wine, silky and elegant with good tannins; buy.\n\nBodega Benegas (http://www.argencyhosting.com/benegas2016/eng/index.php) in the Lújan de Cuyo; a trip highlight was the tour of the renovated winery with Carmen Benegas and the tasting with both Federico and Carmen Benegas. Wines tasted:\n\nMalbec 2005 – this was a very nice wine, black cherries and blackberries on the nose and palate; buy\n\nSangiovese 2002 – the story that Federico told about this wine, including consultant Michel Rolland’s comments, were priceless. Terry and David, who love Sangiovese, thought this wine was great.\n\nBenegas Blend 2001 (cabernet sauvignon/cabernet franc/merlot) – this was one of my favorite wines on the trip, balanced and smooth, good tannins and finish; buy\n\nLynch Meritage 2002 (cabernet sauvignon/cabernet franc/merlot/petit verdot) – another favorite, black pepper and red fruits on the nose and palate, great body with sweet tannins; buy\n\nCabernet Franc 2003 – another favorite, chocolate on the nose, soft with sweet tannins; buy\n\nKaiken (http://www.kaikenwines.com/ingles/index.html) in the Lújan de Cuyo; very nice tasting with the winemaker, Cristobal Undurraga. We tasted both the 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, and the 2004 CS Ultra and Malbec. The Ultra wines are great QPR wines (about $18).\n\nSalentein (http://www.bodegasalentein.com/en/bodega/acerca/salentein.html) in the Valle de Uco; this winery is spectacular (and includes an art gallery).\n\nWines tasted:\n\nPinot Noir 2003, Cabernet Sauvignon 2003 and Merlot 2002 – all are great QPR wines (around $18)\n\nPrimus Malbec 2003 – ripe fruit and violets on the nose, a very smooth and elegant Malbec; buy\n\nAdeluna (http://www.andeluna.com.ar/site/en/) in the Valle de Uco; lunch with wine pairing; brief meeting with Rodrigo Reina Rutini, one of the owners. Wine tasted:\n\nPasionado 2003 (malbec/cabernet sauvignon/merlot/cabernet franc) – this was an excellent wine that we enjoyed with lunch at the winery (a spicy cabrito was the entrée); buy\n\nO. Fournier (http://www.ofournier.com/) in the Valle de Uco; nice tasting with the\n\nwinemaker, Jose Mario Spisso. Wines tasted were the B-Crux and A-Crux (both are tempranillo blends); they were nice wines, but nothing I would buy.\n\nWe also had the following wines at a wine tasting at a wine shop in Mendoza- Chandon Cuvee Reserva Pinot Noir, Septima Codorniu Santa Mari, Dominio del Plata Crios 2006 Torrontes; Enrique Foster 2003 Malbec Reserva, Renacer Punto Final Reserva 2004, Chanarmuyo 2005 Malbec, Tempus Alba Pleno 2003, Nieto Senetiner 2005 Bonarda and Monteviejo 2003 Vale de Flores. None of these wines were remarkable. I expected the Monteviejo (which we were originally supposed to visit, but then suddenly closed for a holiday) to be great, and it wasn’t. This could be another example of a very tired palate.\n\nWhile in the Mendoza area, we also had nice lunches at Bodega Ruca Malen (http://bodegarucamalen.com/)and Almacen del Sur (which unfortunately is now closed). Except for the first night (when we stayed at the Park Hyatt), we stayed at the Finca Adalgisa (http://www.fincaadalgisa.com.ar/finca-adalgisa-dup/finca-adalgisa-hotel.htm) while visiting the wineries around Mendoza. As it turns out, not all of their rooms had air conditioning, and we had to flip a coin with Terry and David as to which of us got the air conditioned room.\n\nFrom Mendoza, we flew to Buenos Aires for a few days. While in BA, we met with Alex (who had helped arrange our visit at Bodega Benegas). Alex is the owner of the Terroir wine shop (http://www.terroir.com.ar/index.php), and he welcomed us with a tasting at his wine store. Terroir is a beautiful, well organized wine shop, and I would highly recommend meeting with him if you ever go to BA. Alex is a great host! The wines we tasted included the Nieto Senetiner Reserva Bonarda (the best Bonarda we had, but the bonarda varietal is not my cup of tea), Terrazas Afincado Petit Manseng (a very nice dessert wine; buy) and the Trapiche Medalla 2003 (cabernet sauvignon/malbec/merlot that was very good; buy).\n\nPracticalities: We flew into Santiago, Chile (SCL), and had a guide and driver throughout our stay in Chile. Jean Albert and Bernando drove us over the Andes to Mendoza, Argentina. We had a different guide and driver while in Mendoza. We then flew from Mendoza (MDZ) to Buenos Aires (EZE). Given that practically every driver in BA thinks a stop sign or stop light is a mere suggestion (the driver simply flashes his lights and plows on through the intersection), I would never rent a car in BA!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIn October 2009, we decided at the last moment to join a tour with Roy and Mario with For the Love of Port (http://www.fortheloveofport.com/). While Charlie and I prefer to travel on our own or with our friends, the offer that Roy made to us was too good to pass up. As it turns out, this was a wonderful trip. We met owners and winemakers, and drank copious amounts of Port and Portuguese table wine. If you want to visit Portugal – and you should, you can’t go wrong with one of the For the Love of Port‘s trips. Finally, of all the wine regions we have visited to date, I would say that the Douro is the most beautiful. The Douro is a spectatuclar region to visit.\n\nBecause we tasted so many Ports and table wines, for this post, I am not going to list the Ports and table wines we tasted, but rather, just point out the highlights of our visit and any Ports and table wines that really stood out to me, or I would buy. Overall, Charlie and I were very impressed with the Portuguese red table wines. And while we enjoyed the Ports, we drank enough Port during this trip to last us a lifetime!\n\nFor those who are Port novices (like me before the trip!), I thought a basic primer on Port would be helpful. Port is made from indigenous grapes, primarily Touriga Nacional, Tourgia Franca, Tinta Roriz (tempranillo in Spain), Tinta Barroca and Tinta Cão. Traditionally, the grape varieties used in Port were field blends (whatever combination of grape varieties that occurred in the source vineyard). Today, the grapes types are segregated by block planting. Port is fortified; that means that during fermentation, when about half of the sugar has turned to alcohol, Aguardente (a brandy made specifically for the Port producers), is added to stop the fermentation. This raises the alcohol level to between 19-21%, and leaves a good deal of residual sugar in the Port. The Port is then transferred to stainless steel or large wooden tanks or casks to age for a minimum of two years. An overview of what happens next, and the various Ports, are described below. During our trip, we drank each of these different types of Port.\n\nRuby Port is a blend of several vintages. It is the lightest, simplest Port; typically wood aged 3-5 years. This is the entry level Port, and meant to be consumed upon release.\n\nReserve Ruby Port is a blend of several vintages and wood aged 5-7 years, and because of the additional time spent in cask, has more complexity and structure than a Ruby Port. Meant to be consumed upon release.\n\nLate Bottled Vintage Port (LBV) is produced from grapes of a single harvest, and bottled between the 4th and 6th years after harvest. Meant to be consumed upon release.\n\nCrusted Port is a blend of two or more vintages; aged in wood for up to four years and then in bottle for up to another three years. The year you see on the bottle is the year the Crusted Port was bottled. Crusted Ports are unfiltered, and need to be decanted to remove the sediment (crust). A Crusted Port can be aged 10-20 years.\n\nVintage Port is the so-called King of Ports. A Port declaration occurs when the producer believes that the vintage is exceptional, and the declaration has been approved by the IVDP, Port’s governing body. A Vintage Port is a blend of grapes from several Quintas that the producer owns or buys from. A Vintage Port is wood aged for at least two years, and then bottled between the second and third year after harvest. A Vintage Port will age for 30+ years. Note that historically, a vintage was “declared” three times per decade. However, that has not been the case since 2000, where the vintages of 2000, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2011 were declared. Further, not all producers“declare” the same vintage. Also, one thing we learned on the trip is that Vintage Port should be decanted.\n\nSingle Quinta Vintage Port (SQVP) is a variation of a Vintage Port, but unlike a Vintage Port, a SQVP has grapes from one specific property (and from one single vintage). Note that a producer may not declare a vintage, but may declare a single quinta.\n\nTawny Port usually starts off like a Ruby Port, but spends an extended time in wood to soften and round its character. The large oak casks (pipes) that are used to age these Ports are somewhat porous and as a result, oxidation occurs. As the oxidation takes place, the color of the wine turns from purplish red to an amber or reddish brown.\n\nTawny Port with an indication of age – there are only four types approved in this category, i.e., 10 years old, 20 years old, 30 years old and 40 years old. These are a blend of many years where the average age of the bottle is at least 10 years, 20 years, 30 years or 40 years old. Tawny Ports with an indication of age were my favorite Ports tasted during the trip.\n\nColheita is a single vintage-dated Tawny Port. Grapes are from a single vintage, and must be aged in cask at least seven years.\n\nWhite Port is a blend of indigenous white grapes that are fortified like other Ports; can be aged in tanks or wood. Drank as an aperitif, or mixed with tonic and lemon.\n\nNow for the visits and other highlights of our trip –\n\nDay 1 in Vila Nova de Gaia and Porto:\n\nChurchill’s (http://www.churchills-port.com/) – visit, tasting and lunch with owner Johnny Graham. Stand out wines were the 1985 Vintage Port, Crusted Port (bottled in 2002), 20 Years Old Tawny Port and Quinta da Gricha 2007. This was a great visit!\n\nDinner was followed by a wonderful tasting at Vinologia (http://www.vinologia.pt); stand out wine was the 1952 Dalva Golden White Port.\n\nDay 2 in Vila Nova de Gaia:\n\nDow/Warre’s Port Lodge and Graham’s Port Lodge (https://www.symington.com/who-we-are) – visit and tasting (in the board room at Graham’s) with Paul Symington (the Symington Family Estates owns these Port houses, as well as Gould Campbell, Smith Woodhouse and Cockburn’s); Rupert Symington also joined us for part of the tasting. Stand out wines were the 1977 Smith Woodhouse Vintage Port, 1994 Gould Campbell Vintage Port, 2007 Graham’s Vintage Port, 2007 Quinta do Vesuvio Vintage Port and 1966 Graham’s Vintage Port. An outstanding visit!\n\nPorto Vasconcellos – visit and tasting with Jorge; nothing special about this visit (in fact, the only visit on the trip that was poor).\n\nDay 3 in Vila Nova de Gaia and then a drive to the Vinho Verde wine region:\n\nOffley Cellars (http://eng.sograpevinhos.com/marcas/Offley) – Offley is owned by\n\nSogrape Vinhos, and our visit and tasting was primarily with Luis Sotomayor, head of Sogrape’s winemaking team (or, as he said, the “chief winetaster”). Our visit included a really fun blending competition, with each of us blending our own 10 Years Old Tawny Port; stand out wine was the 30 Years Old Tawny Port. A really great visit!\n\nQuinta de Aveleda in Vinho Verde (http://www.aveledaportugal.pt/index.php?id=77) –Aveleda is owned by the Guedes family, and our visit and tasting was with António Guedes, director of viticulture, and also António Mendoza, commercial director. This is a beautiful estate; and the wines that I enjoyed were the Aveleda Vinho Verde 2008 and Casal Garcia Vinho Verde Rosé 2008. Another really nice visit.\n\nDinner was at Artemísia in Porto, where we enjoyed some really nice wines with our meal, including the Quinta Vale D. Maria 2001 (a Douro red).\n\nDay 4 in the Douro Valley –\n\nWarre’s Quinta da Cavadinha (http://www.symington.com/vineyards/symington-familys-vineyards#viewGallery/0) – owned by the Symington Family; our visit and tasting was with winemaker Miles Edlmann and Dan Carbon, director of marketing for Symington Family Estates.

Stand out wines were the Crasto 2007 (a Douro red), Crasto 2008 (a Douro white), Reserva Old Vines 2004 and 2007, Vinha da Ponte 2007, Vinha Maria Teresa 2006, Touriga Nacional 2001 and 2003, Tinta Roriz 1997 and 2000 Vintage Port. A truly fantastic day!\n\nDay 6 in the Douro Valley –\n\nQuinta da Romaneira (http://www.quintadaromaneira.pt/en/) – visit, tasting and lunch at Redondo (at the time, Quinta da Romaneira had a beautiful hotel and restaurant) with Joel Fonseca Tibéro (an enolgist, who was the sales director). The lunch with wine pairings was great! My favorite wines were the Rosé 2008 and Verdelho 2007. This was a really nice visit. As a footnote, I stayed in touch with Joel Tibéro after our visit, and Joel helped me with visits in other countries.\n\nQuinta de Nápoles (Niepoort) (http://www.niepoort-vinhos.com/en/process/) – visit and tasting of cask samples with winemaker Luis Seabra. Luis later joined us for dinner, and he brought many bottles of table wines and Port. Luis is a charming and knowledgeable winemaker.\n\nDinner at Restaurante DOC in Folgosa (http://www.docrestaurante.pt/); a wonderful dinner.

Stand out wines were the 2004 Rio Bom Colheita (bottled July 2009), S. Leonardo 30 Years Old Tawny Port and S. Leonardo 40 Years Old Tawny Port. A really wonderful visit!\n\nDinner at Terra in Porto (http://www.cafeina.pt/pt/terra#_=_) – a very nice dinner; stand out wines were the Niepoort Robustos 2004 (a Douro red) and Chryseia 2001 (a Douro red).\n\nA few last comments. We flew into Porto the day before the tour started with For the Love of Port, and had dinner that night at Foz Velha. This was a really enjoyable meal. Finally, we had a very early flight out of Porto the next day after the tour concluded, and we met our driver outside our hotel at around 5:00 a.m. When we stepped outside of the hotel, we were amazed to see hundreds, if not a thousand, people in the streets around our hotel. Our driver told us that these were people still up and partying from the night before; something that happened every Saturday night in Porto!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIn September 2010, Charlie and I spent three weeks visiting five wine regions of Spain – Ribera del Duero, Rioja, Txakoli, Penedes and Priorat. We also spent some time in Madrid, San Sebastian and Barcelona. I arranged the trip through Cellar Tours, http://www.cellartours.com/, and working with Cellar Tour’s owner Gen was a pleasure. We had a driver (or as his card says “transportation captain”!), Jose Maria (“Pepe”), for the entire trip, and he was fantastic. If you want a first rate trip, contact Gen at Cellar Tours, and be sure to ask for Pepe.\n\nEvery bodega we visited was welcoming. We met wonderful people and drank great wines. This trip really opened our eyes as to how good the red and white wines of Spain are. The wines were so good that when we returned home I looked into setting up a distributor company for Spanish wines (which unfortunately didn’t work out). This was a great trip! For those who have followed my posts, you know that my wine descriptions are succinct. But, if I say “buy,” that is my strongest recommendation for a wine. I have also included some of the restaurants and sites that stood out during our trip.\n\nWe arrived in Madrid and spent a few days there While in Madrid, we had a “Spanish Wine Masterclass” (wines from regions that we weren’t visiting) with Mary and Miguel, the owners of Planeta Vino (http://planetavino.net/). Gen had suggested this for a Sunday evening, and the tasting, accompanied by tapas, was great. Although we expected excellent Spanish red wines throughout our trip, this tasting really first opened my eyes as to how good the Spanish white wines could be. The wines we tasted were:\n\nTelmo Rodriguez Gaba do Xil 2009 godello – fresh, easy drinking white wine, some minerality, buy\n\nAdega Eladio Piñeiro Frore de Carme Solo 2006 albariño – an excellent white wine, buy\n\nBodega Belondrade Belondrade y Lurton 2007 verdejo – a barrel fermented white wine, ok\n\nBodegas Julian Chivite Gran Feudo Rosado 2008 (tempranillo, grenache, merlot blend) – very dry; light and delicate, buy\n\nBodegas Viñas del Vero Secastilla 2005 – lean, no real body\n\nCortijo Los Aguilares Tadeo 2007 (petit verdot, syrah blend) – good fruit, good acidity; a very nice wine, buy\n\nBodegas Raúl Pérez El Pecado 2009 mencia – floral nose, violets on the nose; excellent, buy\n\nBodegas El Nido Clio 2007 (monastrell, cabernet sauvignon blend) – very fruit forward, smokey\n\nBodegas Teso La Monja Victorino 2007 tempranillo – subtle, very nice, buy\n\nFernando de Castilla Antique Amontillado NV (sherry made with palomino fino grapes) – very, very dry\n\nOlivares Monastrell Dulce 2006 – a nice dessert wine\n\nAfter Madrid, we headed to the Ribera del Duero –\n\nOur visits/tastings in the Ribera del Duero were:\n\nEmilio Moro (http://www.emiliomoro.com/en/) – tour and tasting with Helian; wines tasted:\n\nCepa21/C21 Hito 2008 – very nice, good fruit, buy\n\nFinca Resalso 2009 – 100% tinto fino, good fruit, meant to drink young\n\nEmilio Moro 2006 – 100% tinto fino, very nice, balanced, good acidity, soft, buy\n\nMalleolus 2006 – 100% tinto fino, very nice, balanced, a little smokey\n\nMalleolus d Valderramiro 2007 – 100% tinto fino, could taste a little oak\n\nMalleolus de Sancho Martin 2007 – 100% tinto fino, really enjoyed, the best wine we tasted, chewy, good acidity and balance, buy\n\nFollowing this visit, we had lunch at Convento la Claras (http://www.hotelconventolasclaras.com/es/restaurante-asador-conde-lucanor.php) in Peñafiel. The meal, served with a 2006 Vina Sastre Crianza, was very good.\n\nAbadia Retuerta (http://www.abadia-retuerta.com/tours-en.html) – tour and tasting with Maria Martin Escudero; wines tasted:\n\nSeleccion Especial 2007 – blend of tempranillo, cabernet, merlot; had a somewhat bitter taste\n\nCuvee Palomar 2004 – blend of tempranillo, cabernet; green on the nose, but much better than the Seleccion\n\nPago Graduna 2006 – syrah; nice, smooth, tastes better than it smells\n\nPago Negralada 2006 – tempranillo, ok, but better with some air\n\nAalto Bodegas y Viñedos (http://www.aalto.es/?lang=en) – tasting with enologist Jose Carlos Garcia Vega; this was a very nice visit; wines tasted: barrel tasting of the three 2009’s, then the 2006 Aalto PS. The Aalto PS was excellent; buy.

We also visited with Manuel Pérez Pascuas (one of the three brothers who started this winery). Wines tasted:\n\nViña Pedrosa Finca La Navilla 2005 -100% tempranillo, nice, smooth, good fruit\n\nViña Pedrosa Reserva 2005 – blend of tempranillo and cabernet sauvignon, ok\n\nPérez Pascuas Gran Seleccion 2003 – 100% tempranillo, a little smoke on the palate\n\nThis was really a nice visit, with Pilar giving us the three bottles that she had opened for our tasting. Although none of the wines made my “buy” list, this bodega is worth a visit.\n\nNow, on to Rioja –\n\nFinca Valpiedra (http://www.familiamartinezbujanda.com/valpiedra/index.php?idc=20&ln=1) – tour and tastng with Leticia Villegas; this tasting included pairings with chocolates from around the world – really enjoyable! Wines tasted:\n\nFinca Antigua Blanco 2009 – 100% viura, floral aroma, also cut hay; fresh; would be good w/ seafood or by itself; buy\n\nCantos de Valpiedra 2007 (their second label) – a tempranillo, smooth, easy drinking, vanilla and pepper on the nose, and then with some time in the glass, almost chocolate on the nose; buy\n\nFinca Valpiedra 2001 – a blend of tempranillo, graciano, cabernet sauvignon; a little dill on the back palate, but better with some air\n\nFinca Valpiedra 2005 – much better nose than the 2001; smooth and silky, a little sweet (in a good way); buy\n\nMoscatel 2009 – 100% moscatel morisco; peaches on the nose; an excellent sweet wine, buy\n\nMarqués de Vargas (http://www.marquesdevargas.com/en/) – tasting with Eva; also included visit to the family home; tasting included tapas with the wines; a very nice visit; wines tasted:\n\nPazo San Mauro 2009 – albarino, mineral with citrus; served with salmon spoon and an anchovy/caviar spoon; a nice wine, buy\n\nConde de San Cristobal 2006 – blend of tinto fino, cabernet sauvignon, merlot; served with jamon w/ peppers; this wine was overpowered by the food\n\nMarques de Vargas Riserva 2005 – blend of tempranillo, mazuelo, grenache, graziano; served with cheese and the jamon/pepper spoon; very nice, went well with the tapas; buy\n\nLunch afterwards was at La Galeria (http://www.restaurantelagaleria.com/home.htm) in Logrono, wines served were the Copa de cava Agusti Torello and Azpilicueta Reserva 2005. An enjoyable meal!\n\nMarqués de Riscal (http://www.marquesderiscal.com/storyeng.php?id=29) – tasting with Carlos Ulibarri Echevarria. I had a contact that was supposed to open the door for us to taste some older reservas, but that didn’t happen. Instead, we tasted:\n\nReserva 2007 – tasted “green”\n\nReserva 2006 – barnyard aroma (and for those who know me, you know that I hate barnyard)\n\nReserva 2005 – barnyard\n\nBaron de Chirel 2005 and 2006 – this wine is produced from old wines and only in the “best vintage years” – I don’t have any notes on these two wines, so I probably wasn’t impressed\n\nThe bodega is next to the Frank Gehry-designed Marqués de Riscal Hotel. The hotel is very impressive looking and stands in stark contrast to anything else in the region.\n\nR. López de Heredia (http://www.lopezdeheredia.com/indexgb.html) – tour and tasting\n\nwith Natalia (only a group tour was available); this winery looks like you stepped in a time machine and went back to over a 100 years ago (complete with mold-covered cellars). Then, even stranger, there is this ultra modern visitors’ center and wine shop in front of the bodega. This was not one of our favorite visits. Wines tasted:\n\nViña Tondonia 1992 Blanc Reserva – after the first taste, this was a nice wine\n\nViña Tondonia 2000 Reserva – nice, but missing something\n\nViña Tondonia 2002 Rosé – dry, apricot color, more like a dry white wine\n\nBodegas Roda (http://www.roda.es/en/) – tour and tasting with enologist Vega Angula Roig (note that many of the Spanish wineries have multiple enologists; one may be technical and responsible for complying with the strict regulations of the region, while one may be the winemaker); a great visit and tasting! Wines tasted:\n\nSela 2008 – primarily tempranillo, with a small amount of graciano; fresh, easy to drink, good fruit; somewhat off smelling at the beginning, but blew off\n\nRoda 2006 – primarily tempranillo, with a small amount of graciano; smooth, soft, good tannins and fruit; red fruit and spices; a nice wine\n\nRoda I 2005 – tempranillo; more complex; strong, but elegant; silky; this was my favorite wine; buy\n\nCirsion 2006 – tempranillo; notes of tobacco, chocolate & coffee; complex; per Vega, drinking well now, but then wait 10-12 years to drink again; buy\n\nAfter the wine tasting, we did an olive oil tasting. One olive oil was the Dauro (a blend of three olive varieties), and the other was the Aubocassa (100% arbequina olives). We really enjoyed the Dauro olive oil. At the end of the visit, Vega gave us a bottle of Roda I 2005 and a bottle of the Dauro olive oil in OWB.\n\nLunch afterwards was at Las Duelas in Haro. Lunch was served with the restaurant’s two house wines, the Bodega Ibaiondo Blanco and the Bodega Ibaiondo Crianza. A very nice lunch.\n\nBodegas Remírez de Ganuza (http://www.remirezdeganuza.com/eng-index.html) – tasting with Luis Martinez, export manager. Tasting included cheese and jamon. This was one of our favorite visits! Wines tasted:\n\nErre Punto Blanco 2008 – a blend of viura and malvasia; floral, crisp, but with body; would be great with seafood; buy [Erre Punto is “R.”; the son of the owner Fernando Remírez de Ganuza is an artist, and he signs his paintings with “R.”]\n\nRemírez de Ganuza Reserva 2004 – mostly tempranillo with a little graciano; smooth and easy drinking; a very nice wine; buy\n\nTrasnocho 2006 – mostly tempranillo with a little graciano; an elegant wine; silky tannins, a great wine; buy\n\nFincas de Ganuza – mostly tempranillo with a little graciano; more rustic and more tannins; Luis said this was a typical Rioja with oak and leather\n\nNext up was San Sebastian, with a tasting in the Getariako Txakolina region along the way –\n\nTalai Berri (http://www.talaiberri.com/ing/historia.php) – tasting with owner/winemaker Bixente Eiagirre Aginaga; a great visit on their deck overlooking the vineyard (Charlie and I can still hear the squawking scarecrow that keeps the birds away from the vines). Wines tasted:\n\nTalai Berri 2009 – mostly hondarribi zuni; Bixente told us to pour this wine from 4-5” above the glass in order to get the most bubbles; fresh, effervescent; small bubbles; Bixente served this with tuna, and the wine matched perfectly; buy\n\nFinca Jakue 2009 – a more rounded white Txakoli\n\nTalai Berri Red Txakoli 2009 – a red Txakoli made with the hondarribi beltz grape; not my favorite\n\nAfterwards, we had lunch at Elkano (http://www.restauranteelkano.com/) in Getaria. We had a perfectly grilled whole turbot, along with a Txakoli, the Txomin Etxaniz 2009; an excellent lunch.\n\nWhile staying in San Sebastian, we had a really nice dinner at L’Auberge Basque (in the Pays Basque in France) (http://www.aubergebasque.com/en/), and an exceptional lunch at Akelaŕe (https://www.akelarre.net/en).\n\nWe also visited the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao, which we really enjoyed.\n\nNext up was the drive east to the Penedès region –\n\nWhile in the Penedès and Priorat regions, we stayed at the Can Bonastre (http://www.canbonastre.com/en/) in Penedès, had a picnic on the grounds one night, and a wine tasting of their own wines one evening; highly recommended!\n\nFirst up in Penedès was Can Rafols dels Caus (http://www.canrafolsdelscaus.com/en/); tasting with Amanda, joined by owner Carlos Esteva. I had been referred to this winery by a wine journalist from Madrid (who I had contacted through the Robert Parker bulletin board), and the journalist said to use his name as a reference. Gen did so in setting up this visit. However, Senyor Esteva thought we were good friends with this journalist, and treated us accordingly. Charlie and I just sort of nodded when he asked about our “good friend.” Undoubtedly, because of the (mis)understanding, Senyor Esteva made sure we had a great visit and tasting. Wines tasted:\n\nGran Caus Blanc 2007 – blend of xarel-lo, chardonnay, chenin blanc; good acidity, good mouth feel, some citrus; buy\n\nEl Rocallis 2005 – 100% manzoni (pinot blanc and reisling); a mineral edge\n\nGran Caus Rosado 2009 – 100% merlot; raspberry in color; smooth and silky; tasted great; one of the best rosés we have ever had; buy\n\nGran Caus 2001 – a blend of merlot, cabernet franc, cabernet sauvignon; smooth, licorice and black fruit; very nice; buy\n\nAd Fines 2006 – 100% pinot noir; nice, but a touch of barnyard\n\nCaus Lubis 1999 – 100% merlot; initially a green nose and taste, but that blew off, and the wine evolved to become very smooth and nice\n\nGran Caus Cava 2004 – a blend of xarel-lo, macabeo, parellada made in the method champenois; white fruit, toasted almonds; buy\n\nGran Caus Rosé Cava Reserva 2004 – 100% pinot noir; a sherry nose\n\nAfter this visit, we had a great al fresco paella lunch at Fragata (http://www.restaurantefragata.com/), in the seaside town of Sitges. Highly recommended!\n\nParés Balta (http://www.paresbalta.com/our-history/) – tour and tasting with Marc Picon, export manager (including a 4-wheel drive tour of the property); we also spent some time with owner Joan Cusiné Carol; served some really good manchego cheeses with our wine tasting; this was an epic wine tasting; wines tasted:\n\nCava Selectio- blend of xarel-lo, macabeo, parellada, chardonnay; mellow, yeasty, easy drinking\n\nBlanc de Pacs 2009 – primarily parellada; easy drinking, floral, peach; a solid everyday wine\n\nCalcari 2009 – 100% xarel-lo; would be good with seafood\n\nElectio 2008 – 100% xarel-lo; minerality, touch of fennel, more complex Radix 2009 – a rosé made with 100% syrah; strawberries and red fruit, fruity\n\nCava Rosé – 100% pinot noir; deep salmon/orange in color, strawberries and raspberries; I loved this sparkling wine, buy [I tried to find this wine in the US when we returned, but I couldn’t find it anywhere, so I contacted the importer. The importer told me that this wine was not imported because he thought the color would turn off most American buyers. Americans are missing out on a really good cava!]\n\nIndigena 2009 – a grenache; very nice\n\nHisenda Miret 2007 – a grenache; smooth, good tannins and fruit; buy\n\nAbsis 2003 – blend of cabernet sauvignon, merlot, syrah; dark and brooding, complex, spicey\n\nDominio Romano RDR 2006 – this is wine from a sister winery in Ribera del Duero; 100% tinto fino; concentrated, but elegant, good tannins, easy to enjoy; buy\n\nGratavinum 2∏R 2007 – this is wine from a sister winery in the Priorat; a blend of grenache and carignan; a very nice wine, good fruit; buy.\n\nWe also tasted the olive oil from Gratavinum, but we enjoyed Roda’s olive oil better.\n\nJean Leon (http://www.jeanleon.com/en/) – tasting with Anna; wines tasted:\n\nPetit Chardonnay 2008 – a touch of oak\n\nMerlot 2006 – good fruit and acidity\n\nZemis 2003 – blend of cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, merlot; good acidity and tannins, smooth, buy\n\nGran Reserva 2000 Vinya La Scala- cabernet sauvignon; smooth, silky, spicy, very nice; buy\n\nNow we are off to Priorat –\n\nClos de l’Obac/Costers del Siurana (http://costersdelsiurana.com/) – a very nice tasting with owner/winemaker Carles Pastrana; wines tasted:\n\nKyrie 2006 – a blend of white grenache, macabeu, xarel-lo, muscat; dried fruit on the nose, good acidity\n\nMiserere 2004 – a blend of grenache, cabernet sauvignon, tempranillo, merlot, carinena; smooth, silky, very nice; buy\n\nClos de l’Obac 2002– a blend of grenache, cabernet sauvignon, syrah, merlot, carinena; austere, but complex, good fruit and tannins; buy\n\nDolc de l’Obac 2005 – grenache with some cabernet sauvignon; enjoyable\n\nAfter leaving Clos de l’Obac, we saw a winery, and decided to check it out. It turned out to be Clos Mogador (http://www.closmogador.com/index.asp?idioma=EN), and René Barbier was pouring wines for a couple in the business, and invited Charlie and I to join them. For those of you who don’t know, René Barbier is credited with reviving Priorat, and bringing it world recognition. I didn’t realize the gentleman pouring the wines was Mr. Barbier, but when he introduced himself, I said “oh, you’re famous” (which still makes Charlie laugh). The wines we tasted were:\n\nManyetes 2008 – blend of carinena, grenache, cabernet sauvingnon, syrah; very nice, smooth, good fruit; buy\n\nClos Mogador 2008 – a blend of grenache, carinena, cabernet sauvignon, syrah; smooth, good fruit and tannins\n\nNelin 2009 – primarily white grenache; ok\n\nMas Martinet (http://masmartinet.com/) – we were supposed to meet with the owner, Sara Perez, for our visit, but she was out of the country during our visit. Sara arranged to have Rachel Ritchie, who gives specialized tours in Priorat, conduct the tasting. The wines we tasted:\n\nMartinet Bru 2008 – grenache and syrah blend; barnyard aroma, did not like the smell or taste\n\nEls Escurcons 2006 – grenache and syrah blend; ok\n\nClos Martinent 2006 – blend of grenache, carinena, syrah, cabernet sauvignon; ok\n\nCamí Pessoroles 2007 – grenache and carinena blend; good fruit, smooth, best of the wines tasted\n\nCharlie and then spent the next few days in Barcelona, a city we had visited before. While staying in Barcelona, one morning Gen had arranged a tapas and wine tasting at Vila Viniteca (http://www.vilaviniteca.es/en/who_are_we). While we had drank plenty of wine on our trip, this tasting, led by Jordi, was exceptional, and I would highly recommend it.\n\nFinally, we ate dinner at Cinc Sentits in Barcelona (http://cincsentits.com/en/food/) and had a fabulous meal. Cinc Sentits is a Michelin one star, family-run restaurant. We were well taken care of by Amèlia Artal, whose brother Jodi is the chef, and their mother serves as hostess. Very highly recommended!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nJCharlie and I, plus our friend Terry, visited Piemonte, Lago Orta and Liguria in May 2012. This was a fantastic visit – we ate great food, drink great wines and met wonderful people. This was Charlie’s and my first visit to the area, but it won’t be our last time to Piemonte and Liguria. While in Piemonte, we stayed at Villa La Meridiana in Alba (http://www.villalameridianaalba.it/), and it was a great place to stay.\n\nWe enjoyed every meal we had in Piemonte. The restaurants we ate at included the following (all lunches):\n\nOsteria La Liberia in Alba (http://www.lalibera.com/en/) – good food and service; the best dessert we had during the entire trip.

Sparkling wines poured were the Brut Mellesimato 2007, the For England Pas Dose 2007 (buy), the For England 2007 Rose, and the Blanc de Blancs 2009. Luca also poured the Moscato Asti Spumate 2009.\n\nGiuseppe Mascarello (http://www.mascarello1881.com/)- tasting with Maria Teresa, wife of Mauro Mascarello. Wines poured were the Dolcetto d’Alba 2010, Barbera Scudetto Superiore 2007 (buy), Freisa 2006, the 2007 Barolo Villero, the 2007 Barolo Santo Stefano (buy), the 2007 Monprivato (buy), the 2006 Barolo Santo Stefano (buy), the 2004 Ca’ d’ Morissio and the 2003 Ca’ d’ Morissio (buy). This was a very generous tasting, but it was difficult to tell how long the bottles has been opened (as they were sitting opened and partially empty when we arrived), and what impact that had on the wines. I have read the outside of this winery described as an old auto repair shop. That is an accurate description!\n\nVietti (http://www.vietti.com/en/) – owned by the Currado family; Luca Currado is the winemaker; visit and tasting with Luciana Currado (matriarch of the Currado family). Signora Currado was generous with her time and stories about the history of her family and the wines. Wines poured were the 2011 Roero Arneis, the 2009 Barbera d’Alba Scarrone, the 2008 Barbera d’Asti La Crena (buy), the 2009 Barbera d’Asti Tre Vigne, the 2009 Nebbiolo Perbacco (buy), the 2008 Barolo Castiglione (buy), the Barolo Lazzarito (buy), the 2008 Barolo Brunate (buy) and the 2011 Moscato d’Asti. A really nice visit.\n\nGiacomo Conterno (http://www.conterno.it/) (Email conterno@conterno.it) – cask tasting with Roberto Conterno. Roberto was very generous with his pours from the casks, but I didn’t have a chance to write down what we tasted. No bottled wines were poured.\n\nElio Altare (http://www.elioaltare.com/)- visit and tasting with Silvia Altare, Elio’s daughter. Silvia is great. Elio now has a vineyard in Cinque Terre, so Silvia poured his 2009 Campo Grande. The Elio Altare wines Silvia poured were the 2010 Dolcetto d’Alba, the 2010 Langhe Nebbiolo, the 2007 Barbera Larigi (buy), the 2007 L’Insieme, the 2007 Barolo buy), the 2006 Barolo (buy) and the 2005 Barolo (buy). This was yet another really nice visit!\n\nSottimano (http://www.sottimano.it/en/)- visit and tasting with Elena Sottimano. Wines poured were the 2009 Barbera d’Alba Pairolero (buy), the 2009 Barbaresco Cotta, the 2009 Barbaresco Pajore (buy) and the 2008 Barbaresco Cotta (buy).\n\nA couple of final notes on some other restaurants we visited during our stay. We stayed and ate at Villa Crespi in Lago Orta. The hotel is really beautiful, and the hotel staff is very efficient and friendly. However, everything about this hotel is pricey, and our dinner was less than stellar. While the food was very good, the wait staff was mediocre at best. We would not return to the hotel or restaurant.\n\nWe also ate dinner at Combal Zero in Torino (http://www.combal.org/). Our dinner was great, but the wine pairings were mediocre at best.\n\nFinally, while staying in Imperia in Ligura (where we also had great pizza on two evenings at La Piazzetta),we drove over to Menton, France and ate lunch at Le Mirazur (http://www.mirazur.fr). This was one of the best meals we have ever had in the world!\n\nPracticalities: We flew in and out of the Milano (MXP), and we rented a car at the airport (through Europe Car). Terry had a TomTom GPS which proved to be invaluable (so much so that Charlie and I purchased one ourselves and have used it on subsequent trips). We did have an issue from time-to-time with the TomTom telling us to travel a certain route, because our car (a small Renault station wagon) was too wide to pass through a certain road or tunnel that TomTom wanted us to travel. Charlie thought you should be able to key in the type of auto, so the GPS would factor that in for driving directions! Also, if you do use a GPS, pay attention to the traffic camera alerts (or you WILL get a ticket in the mail upon your return home), and pay attention to the ZTL (zona traffico limitato) signs (a red circle with white in the center). A ZTL is mainly a pedestrian area, and again, if you drive into the restricted area (past the sign), you WILL get a ticket in the mail upon your return home. Finally, I made all of our winery appointments and restaurant reservations via email (at least 30 days in advance).\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCharlie and I visited Champagne in May-June 2013, following 5 days in Paris. We met some wonderful people and tasted some great champagnes. Brad Baker (http://www.champagnewarrior.com/) was terrific in helping me plan our trip and deciding which growers and houses to visit. It was very evident during our visits that Brad is highly thought of in Champagne. Jiles Halling (http://www.mymaninchampagne.com/) was tremendous in setting up our visits and tastings. Although we did not utilize Jiles’ tour services, meeting Jiles and speaking with people who did tour Champagne with Jiles, I would highly recommend you contacting him if you want some special visits and tastings. Thank you Brad and Jiles for great visits and tastings. Finally, for the first 5 nights, we stayed at Les Molyneux, a B&B in Verzy owned by Jiles and his delightful wife, Yvonne.\n\nIf you have read my prior posts, you know that I am not the best describer of wines. So, I have provided you with my overall impression, and whether I would buy the champagne (i.e., my best recommendation). My notes will also give you a good idea of what to expect if you visit. The growers and houses we visited were:\n\nChampagne Godmé in Verzenay; visit and tasting with Sabine Guillame. Sabine is the sister of Hugues Godmé.
