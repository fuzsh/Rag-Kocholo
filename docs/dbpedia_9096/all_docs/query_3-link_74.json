        "text": "This examination of Bartley Campbell&#39;s 1882 play, The White Slave, emerges out of a comprehensive study of the way in which representations of black/white unions in late nineteenthand early twentiethcentury U.S. drama and fiction invoke anxieties about the impact of interracial contact, while simultaneously rehearsing the multiple possibilities of these transgressive relationships. Because of the way in which black/white, or interracial, intimate alliances have symbolized both explicit acts of racial transgression in and of themselves and implicit threats to essentialized racial categories, their representation creates space for complex readings of these racial identities. In fact, the ambivalent and liminal space in which interracial desire is most frequently represented does not merely complicate race, it provides a place for more productive and multivalent articulations of black and white subjectivities. Campbell&#39;s play offers a useful site for exploring these issues beca...\n\nThis article takes at its point of the departure the practice of transracial adoption of children and adults. During the colonial period, it was not only non-white native children or adults who were adopted by white colonisers and settlers; the opposite also occurred. The existence of these &#x27;inverted&#x27;transracial adoptions is well-documented in literary and autobiographical texts and historical documents, as well as in art and visual culture. At that time, the white transracial adoptee who had been transformed into the Other was ...\n\nAbstract This chapter focuses on the concept of trans-racial adoption of children and adults. Despite the recent concentration on the adoption of white families adopting nonwhite children, we identify how the opposite was a regular occurrence in the classical colonial period. The existence of these inverted trans-racial adoptions is well documented in literary and autobiographical texts, historical and official documents, as well as in art and visual culture."
