        "text": "Las Pinzas Valley has been farmed for more than twenty centuries.\n\nOver time, many people have populated this mysterious land, dotted with caves.\n\nIt was the Romans, with their well-developed road network and the trading this allowed, who planted vines far and wide across the Ribera region.\n\nTwo limestone spurs, with vertical walls, protect the small Valle de Las Pinzas from the great River Duero. The Valdecuriel vineyards are located in an extraordinary spot in the heart of the river plain. The light and the intensity which are characteristic of this area, with its sunny days and cold nights, are ideal to grow very high quality Tempranillo grapes.\n\nThe conditions in these wild, tough surroundings are perfect to grow vines which bear an expressive fruit with great personality. The combination of an extreme climate with clay-limestone soil, which is poor but well-drained, gives deep-rooted, fruity wines.\n\nThe course of the River Duero provides a flat landscape that lends its name to a region with one of the world’s most prestigious, famous denominations of origin, Ribera de Duero. The PDO revolves around the Tempranillo grape on the northern plateau of the Castilla León region. The Valdecuriel winery lies in an amazing spot on the river plain, between the villages of Curiel and Pesquera, in the province of Valladolid."
