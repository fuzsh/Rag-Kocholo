It spans approximately 115 kilometers from east to west and boasts nearly 22,500 hectares of vineyards with a history of winemaking that dates back to the 11th century.\n\nOne of the main reasons Ribera del Duero is considered top quality is due to the area’s extreme climate. The region’s high elevation brings warm days followed by very cold nights resulting in temperature swings of 20 degrees (°C) or more within a single day.\n\nAdd in this area’s old vines from centuries of winemaking and mineral-rich soil and you have an ideal environment for producing acidic, well-balanced red wines from grapes such as Tempranillo, Merlot, Syrah, and Cabernet. However, the tempranillo grape is what this region is best known for.\n\nTo receive the denomination stamp for Ribera del Duero, a wine must be at least 75% tempranillo. The remaining portion can be mixed with other varietals like Merlot, Syrah, and Cabernet. However, most wineries in Ribera del Duero produce 100% tempranillo wine. 🍇\n\nWines in Ribera del Duero must follow strict cultivation and labeling procedures outlined by the D.O., or “Denominación de Origen”. The four categories of wine you can find here are:\n\nJoven: Joven is Spanish for young. These young wines have been aged for 15 months or less. Sometimes this includes a few weeks of aging in an oak barrel but it is not a requirement. Joven wines have a bolder flavor with more tannins on the front.\n\nCrianza: Aged 2 years at minimum in the bottle and 6 months or less in an oak cask.\n\nReserva: Aged 3 years in total with 2 years in the bottle and 1 year in an oak cask.\n\nGran Reserva: Aged 5 years in total with 3 years in the bottle and 2 years in an oak cask.\n\nBest time to visit Ribera del Duero Spain\n\nSummer is the most popular time to visit the wineries in Ribera del Duero, but it doesn’t mean it’s necessarily the best time. It’s not uncommon for temperatures to reach 40°C, around 102 – 104°F in peak summer (July and August). The extreme heat makes it a less-than-ideal time to visit, however, most wineries will remain open.\n\nThe best time to visit Ribera del Duero wine country is in late spring or early fall. September to October is harvest season. This is a fun time to visit Ribera del Duero wineries because you can see lush, ripe grapes hanging on the vine and lots of hustle and bustle as the winemaking process begins.\n\nSome smaller wineries will close their tasting doors during harvest season because they are short-staffed. Always check the winery hours for any closures before planning a wine-tasting weekend in Ribera del Duero, Spain.\n\nWhat to expect from a Ribera del Duero Wine Tasting\n\nMost Ribera del Duero bodegas (wineries) are open during the daytime only from 10 or 11 am to 1 or 2 pm. Make sure to check the hours of each winery before visiting. The weekends (Thursday through Monday) are the most popular times to visit the wineries in Ribera del Duero.\n\n📞 Many wineries in Ribera del Duero require reservations for a tasting, even on weekends. You can make reservations on the winery website or sometimes by sending a WhatsApp message to the winery directly.\n\nMost wineries in Ribera del Duero charge for a wine tasting regardless if you buy a bottle or case of wine. Expect to pay 15€ to 80€+ per tasting. To keep costs down, Dennis and I would split our tastings and then buy a bottle of our favorite wine to go, which is acceptable here.\n\nHow to get to Ribero del Duero\n\nYou can easily get to Ribero del Duero in an hour to two hours drive from Madrid, making it the perfect day trip or wine-tasting weekend from the city.\n\nThe easiest way to get to Ribero del Duero from Madrid is to rent a car or take a guided tour. Most Ribera del Duero wineries are a five to ten-minute drive from each other, at minimum. Having your own vehicle makes it much easier to get to each wine tasting.\n\nIf you don’t want to rent a car or don’t have an international license, something that is required to drive in Spain, the best way to go on a Ribera del Duero wine tour is in a group tour.\n\n🍷 I highly recommend this wine tour to Ribera del Duero with Get Your Guide. Not only do you get to visit three wineries on their guided bus but you don’t have to worry about drinking and driving.\n\nYou can take a bus from Madrid to Peñafiel which is where we recommend you stay during your visit. To find out bus details and departure times from Madrid or Peñafiel go to the Avanza Bus website directly. Tickets cost ~10€ and only operate on the weekends. You’ll still need to secure a taxi to get from winery to winery.\n\nYou can check out other popular tours to do in Madrid and the nearby area below.\n\nWhere to stay in Ribera del Duero\n\nSince this wine region covers a large area you have several options for where to stay in Ribera del Duero. Most of the towns in Ribera del Duero are small villages home to 10,000 people or less.\n\nBurgos and Valladolid are the largest cities near Ribera del Duero Spain. They are great cities with a lot to do and see individually but we love the charm of staying in a small village in Ribera del Duero.\n\n⚜️ We recommend staying in a village on or near the “Golden Mile”. This 15km road stretches from Peñafiel to Tudela de Duero and is where you can find the most well-known and world-renowned wineries of Ribera del Duero, Spain.\n\nOur top pick for hotels in Ribera del Duero is Peñafiel. This is one of the larger towns in the heart of Ribera del Duero and has the AZZ Peñafiel Las Claras Hotel & Spa to stay at. This luxury hotel has a nice pool, indoor spa, and restaurant and is built in an old convent. Peñafiel is also home to a stunning medieval castle with a wine museum inside it.\n\nAnother option is to stay at Hotel AF Pesquera in Pesquera del Duero, Spain. This tiny town is just a 15-minute drive from Peñafiel but is home to the most wineries and tasting rooms than any other town.\n\nIt’s a very small town though, which does not have a lot of options for restaurants which is why we prefer Peñafiel. However, this hotel is wonderful and gives you access to close to 20 different wineries.\n\nIf you are looking for a unique hotel in Ribera del Duero, stay at Residencia Real del Castillo de Curiel. Curiel is a 10-minute drive from Peñafiel and a stunning medieval town. It was our favorite small village we visited in this region packed with so much history. At the top of the hill, there is an old castle turned into a luxury hotel.\n\n10 Top Wineries in Ribera del Duero\n\nThere are roughly 300 different wineries in Ribera del Duero to visit and more than 25 Michelin-rated restaurants to enjoy.

Two of its four labels are grown in Ribera del Duero which are Tinto Pesquera and Condado de Haza. You can visit both wineries individually, but we opted to visit Tinto Pesquera which is in Pesquera del Duero.\n\nThis is another family-owned and operated winery that has been in operation since 1972. It’s also one of the few completely women-owned wineries in Ribera del Duero (owned and operated by 5 sisters).

This small winery isn’t as well-known as some of the others on the list but produces fantastic wines. It’s another family-owned-and-operated winery about 15 minutes from Peñafiel. We visited with our friend Mari Paz, who is a part-owner of the winery.\n\nThe name Convento Oreja (Ear Convent) comes from the name of an old convent, Convento de Santa María de Oreja, in the town the owners grew up in.

Two of which, are the best wineries in Ribera del Duero, and arguably the best winemakers in all of Spain.\n\nIf you are at a restaurant in the area or headed to a specialty shop see if you can buy a bottle or try a glass of Bodega Vega Sicilia or Ausas Bodegas & Viñedos since they cannot be visited without special invitations.\n\nBodega Vega Sicilia\n\nBodega Vega Sicilia is revered for being the best wine producer in all of Spain. Its estate has more than 1,000 hectares of vines and has been in operation since 1864. The winery, which is run by the Alvarez family today, uses one of the most stringent procedures for selecting its grapes ensuring only the best crop of the year is made into wine.\n\nIts wine is aged for a minimum of five years, often ten or more before being available for sale. Its high standards for harvesting, making, and aging wine each year means its production is limited. Expect to spend several hundred dollars for a bottle of Vega Sicilia. Must-try wines from Bodega Vega Sicilia are Valbuena (joven wine) and Unico.\n\nAusas Bodegas & Viñedos\n\nAusas Bodegas & Viñedos was one of the best wines we tasted during our two-week trip here. Right now, there is only one wine to try from Ausas called Interpretación.\n\nXavier Ausàs worked as a part of the Vega Sicilia wine group for nearly 25 years before starting his own winery. His wine is built upon three pillars: aromatic purity, freshness, and elegant tannic manifestation. He achieves this by working carefully with each terroir plot to ensure it creates the quality and flavor profile he desires.\n\nThe best wineries in Ribera del Duero map\n\nThese are some of the best wineries in Ribera del Duero, but not the only ones worth visiting. There are so many fantastic small family-owned winemakers who are creating fantastic wines but don’t get the same recognition as the larger wineries here.\n\n🍇 Other noteworthy wineries in Ribera del Duero are Finca Villacreces, Bodegas Hacienda Monasterio, Viña Sastre, Bodega y Viñedos Pradorey, Bodegas Félix Callejo, Bodegas Comenge, Bodegas Cepa 21, and Bodegas Ismael Arroyo – ValSotillo.\n\nOur wineries in Ribera del Duero map include some of the other noteworthy wineries to visit that didn’t make the top 10 list as well as a few of the smaller wineries in the area.
