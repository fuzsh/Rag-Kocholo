        "text": "Penedes\n\nGalicia\n\nAragon\n\nCarinena\n\nCastilla y Leon\n\nBierzo\n\nRibera del Duero\n\nToro\n\nExtremadura\n\nMurcia\n\nJumilla\n\nLa Rioja\n\nMalaga\n\nPenedes\n\nCavas Bolet (Castellvi de la Marca/Penedes) ORGANIC\n\nCava has been on our wish-list for 20 years. So, on our trip to Spain in April 2023 our Cava Quest was a priority. We found what we were looking for at Cavas Bolet, 35 minutes west of Barcelona. We were very impressed by Xavier Bolet’s magical, organic Cavas. From the ‘basic’ Cava up to the Gran Reservas, they were right up our street, wider and broader than most. We also enjoyed the still red wine, Cantarelus, 100% Ull de Llebre (aka Tempranillo).\n\nGalicia\n\nAdega do Ricon (Arbo Pontevedra) ORGANIC\n\nHaving started our Spanish trip in April 2023 in Barcelona and taken in Cava country, Rioja, Ribera del Duero and Bierzo all in blazing sunshine and parched landscapes, our final stop was in moist green Galicia with Albarino on our mind. In the morning we found an excellent Rías Baixas (coming in Autumn). With our friend Nacho’s help (that’s Nacho Leon of Demencia, Pyjama & Taruguin fame) we found ourselves in the afternoon opposite the Portuguese border on the north bank of the Minho river in the pouring rain. “You know I don’t have the D.O?” said Adrian Ricon. (D.O. = Denominacion de origen: the official geographical recognition). That doesn’t bother us at all – it’s the quality of the wine that matters. And the quality of his organic Blanco (85% Albarino with 5% each of Loureira, Treixadura and Godello) was superb.\n\nCUW Cambados Urban Winery (Cambados/Galicia)\n\nIt was super-hot and extremely dry everywhere we went in Spain in April 2023, until we arrived in Galicia. There’s a reason why it’s so green there: it rains frequently, some might say constantly. We went to visit Antonio Galinanes of CUW, Cambados Urban Winery, in the heart of Rias Baixas, the spiritual home of Albarino. Antonio showed us three of his small parcels of vines, all very close to the water. One directly on the sea front, another directly on the estuary. He currently has just 2.2 hectares with another 0.7 plot on the way. The first vintage of his wine, Desconcierto Rias Baixas, was 2015. Our first shipment, the 2022, has notes of citrus zest and a whisper of sea air.\n\nAragon\n\nReino de los Mallos (Murillo del Gallego)\n\nThis winery is in the village of Murillo del Gallego and takes its name from the huge jutting rock formations of Aguero and Riglos, the “kingdom of the mountains”, the foothills of the Pyrenees. A bold, slightly sweaty, blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Garnacha.\n\nCarinena\n\nPiquer (Muel)\n\nFrom Carinena, a sub-section of Aragon with its own Official Denomination (D.O), in the foothills of the Pyrenees, we bring you an excellent, characterful red by Manuel Piquer in hot, dry Muel. “Lelia” is an old-vine Grenache without a hint of oak to let the fruit shine through and has become a firm Winery favourite. Our shop was overrun when Manuel visited The Winery with a posse of 14 family members recently.\n\nChapillon (Muel)\n\nChristophe Chapillon is the (surprisingly) French man who, while working at Vinicola Real in Rioja, introduced us to our phenomenally popular Spanish red “Lelia”. He recently sourced some old vine Syrah and Merlot, and asked Manuel Piquer, the wine-maker of Lelia, to make it for him. Something of a maverick businessman, Christophe now lives in Zaragoza with his Spanish wife and is very pleased to have named this wine after himself.\n\nCastilla y Leon\n\nThe old kingdom of Castilla y Leon provided a fertile hunting ground on our recent trip to Spain. From the green, rainswept hills of Bierzo on the Pilgrims Trail to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia to the much hotter, dustier landscape of Ribera del Duero, the Duero valley 150kms due north of Madrid, made famous by Vega Sicilia and Pesquera and often held to be the source of the finest wines in Spain.\n\nFinca Cardaba (Valtienda)\n\nThere is an excellent Asador in Aranda del Duero called El Pastor (The Shepherd). It’s the classic local grill restaurant, where they do just one thing, roast spring lamb with salad and a hunk of bread. Xavier Sancha has two jobs, one as lamb-roaster in the family restaurant, the other overseeing his spanking new winery in the otherwise rustic, cattle village of Valtiendas to the south, where he makes more-ish, fleshy reds from Tempranillo vines by the house he shares with his girlfriend Nurio.\n\nGarmendia (Vizmalo/Burgos) ORGANIC\n\nPatxi Garmendia became the biggest supplier of partridge in Europe and has now built an organic winery (complete with winemaker who looks like a freedom fighter) and started rearing Wagyu beef in the countryside southwest of Burgos. His Blanco is a 50/50 blend of zizzy, grassy Verdejo (a grape best known from nearby Rueda) with the softer, oilier Viura (best known from white Rioja). His reds are beautifully-made Tempranillos with deep saturated fruit.\n\nBierzo\n\nRibera del Duero\n\nToro\n\nVega Sauco (Morales de Toro)\n\nWences Gil got into wine by accident. His promising career as a footballer came to an abrupt halt with a serious fracture decades ago. Through what he describes as a “clerical error” he found himself enrolled at a wine college in Madrid. Following stints along the Douro valley; in Rueda, Ribera del Duero and Cigales, he fell in love with Toro, further west along the river valley and set up his own winery there in 1986. His daughter Patricia Luna Gil now shares winemaking responsibilities. The wines of Toro have seen a transformation over the past two decades. They were considered tough, alcoholic and wild. Wences was one of the first to show that the Toro wildness could be ever-so-slightly tamed without losing its sense of place. The grape is Tinta de Toro, a local version of Tempranillo. Those with decade long memories of The Winery’s Spanish selection may remember a bright blue labelled wine by Vega Sauco. The label has changed but the wine within is still butch and wild.\n\nExtremadura\n\nMurcia\n\nJumilla\n\nLa Rioja\n\nWorld famous Rioja is 100km south of Bilbao and protected by mountains on either side; the Sierra Cantabria to the East and the Sierra de la Demanda to the West. It is divided into three subzones: Riojas Alta, Alavesa and Baja. Most commercial Rioja is a blend from all three. Rioja Baja, with its hotter continental climate was considered a bit rougher than Alta and Alavesa with their maritime influence, relying more on Garnacha (Grenache) than Tempranillo which was more prevalant in the Alta and Alavesa. This is no longer the case. Many growers in Baja replanted to Tempranillo and the best are making wines to equal their more rarified neighbours to the North West. We also mustn’t forget the other authorised grapes which also have a part to play in the classic Rioja blend: Mazuelo (Carignan) for guts and body, and Graciano for colour and elegance.\n\nRioja has always been a political hothouse. It was the first region to establish its own Denominacion de Origen, rigorously policed by the Consejo Regulador in Logrono. The current controversy is that the Basques are claiming the Rioja Alavesa for themselves. Such is the power of the Consejo Regulador that they have stated, yes, secede by all means, but you will no longer be able to call your Alavesa wines Rioja. This leaves the Basques in a bit of a quandary!\n\nBodegas Vinicola Real (Albelda de Iregua/Rioja Alta) SOME ORGANIC\n\nMiguel Angel is the energetic, moustachioed owner and winemaker of this brilliant estate in the Rioja Alta. His 200 Monges is an excellent balance of old and new. New, clean, winemaking techniques with old values. The slightly sweaty nose of the Tempranillo grape with a saturated core of dark, red fruit. When we visited him in June, he took us into the hills above the village and showed us his gnarly, old windswept vines. Old vines make good juice. His Vina Los Vallos bottlings are organic.\n\nMalaga"
