        "text": "Why should I learn a language or other subject on AmazingTalker?\n\nAmazingTalker’s one-on-one tutors are suitable for everyone who wants to learn a skill from home. We have professional tutors for toddlers, for younger children, for high school students and for adults in all levels. You can choose beginner, intermediate or advanced classes, or work with one of our tutors to figure out your current level.\n\nAT offers languages tutors and tutors for other subjects. Our language tutoring services can help you to improve in all aspects of the language - listening, writing, reading, speaking, pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary. You can also customize your lesson focus (such as a program for using the language at work). Whether your goal is to improve your conversation skills for fun, prepare for a test or speak more fluently at work, AmazingTalker’s language tutors are here to help. In addition, you can find math tutors, physics tutors, chemistry tutors and tutors for other subjects, catering both to students and professionals.\n\nWho are our tutors?\n\nAmazingTalker handpicks only the best local and international tutors.\n\nEach prospective instructor must undergo a rigorous selection process before becoming an AT tutor, after which their performance is constantly monitored. Try a class and start learning today.\n\nHow do I find a tutor?\n\nIf you want to find a tutor near you and you have a clear idea of your criteria for choosing one - such as any learning objectives, target budget for tutoring, etc. - you can use the search function to find a tutor near you who suits your needs. You can then contact the tutor or book a trial class to start your learning adventure.\n\nHowever, if you're not sure where to start, we're here to help. Try using our tutor recommendation system, and you'll automatically get matched with tutors who fit your criteria!\n\nIf I’m learning a language, what's the best learning environment for me? Should I choose a native speaker as my tutor?\n\nOne of the best ways to learn a language is to immerse yourself in an environment where you try to use only that language.\n\nHowever, if you do not currently have a solid base in spelling and/or vocabulary, we recommend you choose a bilingual tutor who speaks your target language and your native language, as you will likely have a better learning experience during your one-on-one classes.\n\nIf you have a good range of vocabulary but lack the opportunity to practice, then we recommend you choose a native speaker teacher.\n\nWhere can I find language or other classes near me?\n\nYou can start learning with an online tutor from home now! For local instructors, our platform makes it easy to find tutors serving your area.\n\nWhen can I take language or other classes with tutors online?\n\nIn terms of scheduling, you can set up your lessons for whenever is convenient. You can set up classes with your personal teacher for the morning, afternoon, evening or late night in your time zone. If you don't have much availability during the week, we have tutors available on weekends as well.\n\nHow much is the cost per hour?\n\nAll fees and tuition are set by the tutors themselves, not by AT. For reference, most of our tutors charge roughly USD$10-30 per hour.\n\nHow do I pay for the cost of learning?\n\nYou can pay with PayPal or credit card (American Express, Mastercard, or Visa). For certain international markets (e.g. Taiwan), we also accept local methods of payment, such as payment via ATM or convenience store.\n\nWhat makes AmazingTalker unique?\n\nWith AmazingTalker, you can work with high-quality tutors at affordable prices from the convenience of your own home, while getting customized learning plans and 1-on-1 attention.\n\nWith respect to language learning in particular: unlike many other online language learning platforms, AmazingTalker believes that the best way to learn a language is by working with real native speakers and tutors. Regardless of which of our 60+ languages or topics you want to focus on, we believe that the way you learn should be designed for your needs and goals.\n\nWhat if I want to become an online teacher at AmazingTalker?\n\nIf you're interested in becoming an online teacher, please visit our \"apply to teach\" page. At AmazingTalker, you can teach on your own schedule and set your own rates.\n\nWhat if I have more questions?\n\nOur FAQs section here should have answers to most of your questions. If you can't find answers to your question in the FAQs, you can find more information or contact us by clicking the red question mark icon on the bottom right of your screen."
