        "text": "Ribera de Duero Appellation of Origin\n\nRibera del Duero is considered today one of the best wines in Spain with designation of origin. However, the relationship between Ribera del Duero and wine goes back a long way. Indeed, the god Bacchus is depicted in Roman mosaics discovered at Baños de Valdearados in 1972.\n\nThe Romans considered this sunny land with low rainfall ideal for growing grapes. Wine has influenced this land and its people since then. Vineyards give colour and texture to the landscape, and traditional wineries (from the 13th century) shaped the towns, becoming a key element of their economy and traditions.\n\nRibera del Duero was granted the Designation of Origin in 1982, with the headquarters of the Regulatory Board at Roa. There are currently over 200 wineries protected under the Designation of Origin, including some of the most prestigious brands in the country.\n\nThe variety of grape most widely used is local red or tempranillo (at least 75% of the grapes must be from these varietals). Red wine accounts for the bulk of the production, although rosé and white wine are also produced.\n\nThere are four Designation of Origin categories in red wines: young wine (aged for less than 12 months), Crianza (aged for not less than 24 months, 12 of which must be in oak barrels), Reserva (aged for not less than 36 months, 12 of which must be in oak barrels) and Gran Reserva (aged for not less than 60 months, 24 of which must be in oak barrels).\n\nDutch elm disease\n\nDutch elm disease decimates elms, leaving a trail of dried or stunted trees that eventually die when they are 2-3 metres high.\n\nThe disease is spread by a small insect, the elm bark beetle. As the beetle bores into the bark of an elm tree, and feeds on the tender branches, it introduces a fungus (Ceratocystis ulmi) into the tree's vascular system.\n\nAlthough the elm eventually dies, the sticky spores of the Dutch elm fungus remain inside the tree and attach to the beetles inside the elm. The beetle spreads the spores when it moves to another elm, beginning a new cycle of propagation."
