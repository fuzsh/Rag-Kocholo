        "text": "We combined all forms of Active mobility (such as walking and cycling) into A, moving by Public Transport (like Bus or Metro) into B, and moving by Car (including motorbikes, Uber and taxis) into C. The result: the ABC of mobility! We collected 1000 mobility surveys from nearly 800 cities worldwide and constructed their ABC of mobility. Some results: 🚗 People in cities on the right corner move mainly by C (mainly cities in the USA, Canada and Australia, where more than 90% of the journeys are by car). 🚇 On the left are cities where they move by B (for example, large cities in Asia). 🚶♀️ On the top corner, people move by A (for example, Utrecht in the Netherlands). 🌇 In small cities, Public Transport is almost negligible, so most people drive or walk. However, in big cities, Public Transport accounts for more than half of the journeys. On our new website, CitiesMoving.com, you can: 🔺 Download the data for 800 cities! 🔺 Explore interactive visualizations. 🔺 Contribute with more observations, like cities that we are missing or new travel surveys.
