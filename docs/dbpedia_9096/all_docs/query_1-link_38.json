        "text": "General information\n\nLegaris Edición Especial 2022 is a single-varietal Tempranillo from the estate the winery owns in Curiel de Duero (Valladolid). It comes from a year marked by scant rainfall and high temperatures. However, these extreme conditions mean healthy vines. What’s more, the favourable climate conditions in late September and early October were conducive to satisfactory phenolic ripeness.\n\nThe grapes were destemmed and transferred whole to the vats. Following cold pre-fermentative maceration for 48 hours, they underwent alcoholic fermentation at 25º C to preserve the varietal aromas. The total duration of maceration was 10–12 days. The wine underwent spontaneous malolactic fermentation in stainless steel vats before being transferred to American oak barrels, where it remained for 5 months to give it added structure and complexity.\n\nBodegas Legaris is the most personal winery, smaller than others in the Codorníu Raventós group to which it belongs. Its facilities, situated in Curiel de Duero, were built in 1999, the same year the vineyard was planted. Today the firm owns 121 hectares of vineyards in the Curiel de Duero and Peñafiel (Valladolid) and San Martín de Rubiales and Gumiel de Mercado (Burgos) estates. The vineyards have been organically certified since 2022.\n\nThe winery believes in fresh, fruity and elegant wines such as Legaris Edición Especial 2022 (D.O. Ribera del Duero). It’s ideal with baked rice and char-grilled entrecote.\n\nOpinión de sus Creadores\n\n\"\n\nVery intense purplish red with bluish hues. Dominant aromas of ripe red fruit that reflect the characteristics of the grape variety, balanced by subtle toasty hints from barrel ageing. A pleasant, flavoursome and round wine.\n\n\""
