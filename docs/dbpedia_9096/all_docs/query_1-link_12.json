        "text": "The Ribera del Duero is one of Spain’s world renowned wine regions and at a just 1.5 hours drive from Madrid, it is easily accessible on a wine tasting day tour. The wines produced in this region are among the finest in Spain.\n\nThe monks of Cluny were growing grapes along the river bank of Duero to produce wine way back in the 12th century. Ribera del Duero wines enjoy great popularity today, thanks mostly to the great efforts of experienced growers and wine makers from the area.\n\nThere are so many wineries in this area that deserve a visit, that we have made a good selection for you. From the famous underground bodegas in Aranda to the well-known modern wineries of Ribera. Aranda, like many towns in the region, is practically hollow underneath, since the bodegas were tunnelled deep into the Earth to help the temperature control and stability needed for wine storage. Although many fell into disuse, some have been recovered for visiting or for wine production. Visiting an old wine cellar that has remained working for centuries and drinking a glass of wine with one of the owners is an unforgettable experience.\n\nItinerary:\n\n(Please note that this itinerary is an example only and may be subject to change. Selection and order of the wineries depends on availability)\n\n9.15 am - Metting point: Paseo de la Infanta Isabel, 5 (Cafeteria La Gloria)\n\n11.15 am - First Stop: Aranda de Duero, Aranda de Duero, Province of Burgos, Castile and Leon\n\nYou will do a full visit in the first winery, learning about winemaking in Ribera (riverside in Spanish), and understanding tempranillo wine from the grape to the bottle.

Please note that this itinerary is an example only and may be subject to change.\n\n13.00 pm - Second Stop: Sotillo de la Ribera, Sotillo de la Ribera, Province of Burgos, Castile and Leon\n\nThe second winery is in harmonious modernity with the environment; it is open to the vineyards. This link between the interior and the exterior in a statement of the necessary functionality of spaces, nature and history. Everything stands up as a new concept of wine. We always select wineries that are different, mixing tradition and modernity, to get a broad understanding of one of the most famous wine regions in the world. Please note that this itinerary is an example only and may be subject to change.\n\n14.30 pm - Lunch Time: Roa, Roa, Province of Burgos, Castile and Leon\n\nThere will be free time to have lunch at your own choice (lunch is not included in tour price: we do not impose a menu).

Here, we will learn part of the history of the Ribera del Duero. Please note that this itinerary is an example only and may be subject to change.
