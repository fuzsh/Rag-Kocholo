        "text": "The growing involvement of ENGOs in tourism-related activities all over the world has brought new knowledge to these organizations, as well as to local communities, researchers and protected areas, amongst others. Where insular contexts are concerned, this relationship has its own singularities, with potentials and limitations yet unexplored. In this scenery, the idea of sustainable development as a basis for research integrates different dimensions of sustainability (environmental, cultural, social and economic), thus transforming the entire discussion on new developments in tourism, namely tourism in rural areas. In this paper, we discuss and reflect upon how the managers of Fernando de Noronha’s EPA and PARNAMAR perceive the role of local ENGOs in sustainable tourism. We conducted structured interviews with the managers and those in charge of the local ENGOs. In loco observation was also used during two diferente periods in 2012. We found that there is indeed an effective partnership between ENGOs and the protected areas when it comes to sustainable tourism, as the area’s managers recognize the importance of these organizations and mention their involvement in discussions about tourism planning, community training and tourist awareness."
