        "text": "What are the speed limits for motorhomes in Spain?\n\nThe speed limits for motorhomes and campers in Spain are applied as follows:\n\nYou will have to differentiate by the type of homologation of the vehicle:\n\nIf it is homologated as Motorhome/Touring:\n\nIf the MMA is equal to or less than 3,500Kg on Motorway/Highway the limit is 120km/h and 90km/h in case of driving on conventional roads.\n\nIf the MMA is higher than 3.500Kg on Motorway/Highway the limit will be 90km/h and 80 km/h on conventional roads.\n\nIf the vehicle is homologated as an adaptable mixed vehicle, the limit will be 100km/h on Motorways/Highways and 90km/h on conventional roads.\n\nIf the vehicle is homologated as a van, the limit will be 90km/h on motorways/highways and 80km/h on conventional roads.\n\nParking, Overnight stay, Camping in a Motorhome or Camper in Spain?\n\nIn Spain there are no specific regulations regarding motorhome parking. Therefore, it is necessary to differentiate these 3 concepts:\n\nParking: As it is stated in the General Traffic Regulations, the parking of a Motorhome or Camper is the same as any other motor vehicle.\n\nIn any case, it must be taken into account that, in general, parking in urban areas may be regulated by each municipality, since they are responsible for their public roads. That is to say, we can find municipalities with places where parking is allowed and places where it is prohibited.\n\nBut this municipal ordinance must not oppose, alter, distort or lead to confusion with the precepts of the General Traffic Regulations, and the distribution of these parking spaces must be equitable among all users, without depriving them of this right to park on public roads as long as the stop or parking is not dangerous, is carried out in the form and manner indicated, does not constitute a danger or an obstacle to traffic, the vehicle is placed in the manner indicated, and is also located in an authorized place.\n\nIn short: the regulations or ordinance of each locality must be taken into account, and parking in those places authorized for this purpose and in the manner indicated. Even so, parking must be permitted provided that:\n\n- The vehicle contacts the ground only with its wheels (except on slopes where chocks are allowed).\n\n- The vehicle does not occupy more space than the closed motorhome or camper, without opening windows, or invading the space with chairs, tables, awnings, etc.\n\n- No emission of fluids or uncivic behavior and annoying noises are produced.\n\nOvernight stay: Overnight stay inside a vehicle is totally allowed, provided that the vehicle is properly parked and it is not relevant the fact that its occupants are inside the vehicle, and the motorhome is not an exception, provided that the activity that may take place inside does not transcend to the outside by means of the deployment of elements that overflow the perimeter of the vehicle such as stalls, awnings, leveling devices, stabilization supports, etc.\n\nThere are two exceptions where overnight stays are not allowed.\n\nIn coasts: Where the Law of coasts will be applied and that the same one delimits in the majority of the cases by means of some white cairns, which part is coast and which is not and that you will not be able to surpass this delimitation with your vehicle.\n\nIn protected natural areas: In natural parks, biosphere reserves, etc., being areas of special conservation, in most of them there is a specific regulation regarding camping and parking. In general, parking is allowed in these areas, but only during the day, thus restricting overnight stays.\n\nCamping: Free camping is forbidden in Spain, except in places authorized for this purpose (campgrounds, private or public motorhome areas with camping permits). Therefore if you want to perform any of these actions:\n\n- Take chairs or tables out of The vehicle and eat outside your vehicle.\n\n- Shower outside The vehicle.\n\n- Open windows.\n\n- Extend awnings or awnings.\n\n- Put chocks\n\n- Put stabilizer legs.\n\n- Discharge fluids (clean, grey or black water) except those from the engine through the exhaust pipe.\n\n- To Put an electric generator in operation.\n\n- Make annoying noises (music, radio, etc...).\n\nTips to spend the night in a motorhome or camper:\n\nPay attention to the signs: When you arrive at a new place, check if there are any signs regarding motorhomes or camper vans. This will allow you to find the right place.\n\nAsk questions or other users: If you arrive at a site where there are already other campers, ask them about overnight stays. You can also find out about many overnight sites in forums such as Furgovw and AC Passion.\n\nRemember the parking rules: Remember to abide by the aforementioned rules governing parking. For you, for respect to the place and for the rest of the group.\n\nGo with your instinct: If you think that the place you have chosen to spend the night is not the right one, the best thing to do is to follow your instinct and look for another place.\n\nTalk to the authorities: If they knock on your door on any occasion, it is best to talk to them in a calm and correct manner. Many times they are not aware of the different regulations.\n\nUse overnight stay APPs: use apps such as Park4night to find places to stay overnight. Campgrounds, parking, motorhome areas, services and much more. In these apps the spots are uploaded by users and you can find photos and comments about the place.\n\nRespect the environment: Motorhomers and camper users are a group that is very aware of the care of the environment they visit. We recommend you to do the same. Dump your dirty water in the appropriate place, do not make annoying noises and respect the natural spaces.\n\nWhat should I check in my motorhome or camper when it snows?\n\nDue to the weather conditions that occur in winter, there are a number of considerations and checks that are highly recommended to take into account so that you can enjoy this time of year in your motorhome or camper. Here we have summarized for you the most interesting ones. (link to article about 10 tips in winter)"
