        "text": "The area of vineyards controlled is 2.100 hectares provided by a 300 suppliers of grape. The largest concentration of vineyards are registered in the municipalities of Wheel, Sawn and Dried in the province of Valladolid and in the boundary zone of the province of Segovia, in the D. O. Wheel. The vineyard is located at an altitude of between 700 and 850 meters above sea level.\n\nThe soils most characteristic are the “gravel”: soils brown, stony with good aeration and drainage. The traditional training has been the glass, while in recent years all new plantings are done in trellis.\n\nAt the end of 1998, the Codorníu Group materialized their presence in the D. O. Ribera del Duero with the purchase of 90 hectares of land in the municipalities of Curiel de Duero (Valladolid) and San Martín de Rubiales (Burgos).\n\nJust a few months later, in the spring of 1999, they planted the first vineyards, and in April of 2000 he was beginning to establish itself as the future bodega Legaris. The first wines of the winery, from selected vineyards, are a Foster and a Book that went to market for the first time at the beginning of 2003.\n\nThe two vineyards of Legaris have been planted with Thin Ink, although it is expected that within a period of time a 20% of the lands are devoted to the cultivation of Cabernet Sauvignon. The vineyard is situated at a height of between 700 and 850 meters above sea level soil loose, abundant in limestone, poor in iron and low fertility.\n\nThe building that houses Legaris was designed and built by the architect Domingo Triay, architect, among other works, from the bodegas Raimat and Trough. Legaris has a structure essentially functional and its distribution responds to the rational flow of the process of elaboration of the wine. Located a few kilometres from the town of Peñafiel, the winery is distributed in the form of a cross, on two levels and has a structure markedly cubic."
