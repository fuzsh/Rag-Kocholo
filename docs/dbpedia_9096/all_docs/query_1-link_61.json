        "text": "General information\n\n2 bottles of Ébano 2021. Ébano Viñedos y Bodegas. D.O. Ribera del Duero.\n\nAt Vinoselección we’ve been keeping an eye on Ébano Viñedos y Bodegas ever since it started out and the friendship we’ve gradually built up has enabled us to offer you several of their wines exclusively. Ébano 2021 is the fourth vintage of this young wine aged for 6 months that you’ll only find here. From one of the Ribera del Duero wineries with the best future prospects, this red reflects the character of the Tempranillo grapes grown in the region and its quality is assured by an Excellent vintage. It’s potent, fleshy, intense and fruity.\n\n2 bottles of 822 2021. Pagos de Anguix. D.O. Ribera del Duero.\n\nThe surname Juvé has been associated with quality winegrowing for more than two centuries. The family is famous for its great work with Cava and since 2018 has also been producing wine in Ribera del Duero. Here they work with the best Tempranillo vines that lie at a high altitude in the part of the D.O. located in the province of Burgos and are cultivated using organic methods. 822 2021 follows in the footsteps of the new-style Riberes, which are fresher and smoother. It was grown on vines planted at 822 m above sea level – hence its name – and comes from an Excellent vintage. What’s more, it was designed by one of the leading experts in Ribera vineyards, winemaker José Manuel Pérez Ovejas.\n\n2 bottles of Arcum Reserva Edición Limitada 2018. Bodegas y Viñedos Arco de Curiel. D.O. Ribera del Duero.\n\nArcum Reserva Edición Limitada 2018 is a fantastic Ribera del Duero from a small winery that respects the traditional style of the region and works with grapes from its own Tempranillo vines, which lie at an altitude of more than 700 metres and are distributed among the districts of Bocos and Curiel de Duero (Valladolid). This elegant, fresh Reserva that will keep for a long time is highly recommended."
