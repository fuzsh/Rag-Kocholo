        "text": "The harvest season is here and the vineyards are full of their brightest colours. There are many things to do in Ribera del Duero, but our favoirte one is to enjoy the colours of wine country in late September and October. Fall is the time to collect the fruit that has been so carefully grown, tended and cared for. Even at night the vineyards are little hubs of activity, with the most dedicated winemakers harvesting the grapes in the low temperatures to protect the grapes from daytime oxidation.\n\nNow is the perfect season to visit Ribera del Duero and its wineries and here are the top 10 things to do in Ribera del Duero as signalled by our local experts.\n\nWe include below 2 of our favorite tours to enjoy Ribera del Duero wine country.\n\nRibera del Duero gets its name from the Duero River that runs throughout its vineyards, feeding its grapes at every step of the way. The Spanish ´Ribera´, means ´river bank´, meaning that literally the name of this wine region is the river bank of the Duero River. Majestic on its path through Aranda, and calm as it flows by Valladolid, the River offers beautiful opportunities to walk along its banks and appreciate the nature that surrounds it.\n\nThe Monastery of Valbuena (in Valbuena de Duero) has a collection of Christian art from the Middle Ages pieces that are part of an ´Ages of Man´ series. This collection is distributed across different areas in Castilla León, and brought back together for an exhibition once a year at different locations each time. In this sense, there is no permanent place to visit the collection. However, you can find when and where the exhibition will be by going to the official page (which is in Spanish). This autumn, the exhibition is in Aranda del Duero, from 6th May to the 10th November, and starts in the Plaza Mayor.\n\nOn first sight, the River Duratón is set in gorge, surrounded on both sides by beautifully dramatic rock faces that are home to local flora and fauna, as well as animals and birds. The River has over time created this landscape for itself, which is today a place of refuge for fantastic forest birds of prey. You can tour the River with a guide either at the tops of the cliffs, or at the level of the River itself- a real treat for nature lovers.\n\nRibera del Duero has a wealth of tiny and small villages that have so much untouched history to discover. There are so many places to visit, however we would suggest visiting the Peñaranda de Duero with its main square and castle and Aranda de Duero with its main square, churches and bridge that runs over the River Duero and Peñafiel with its spectacular castle and traditional Plaza del Coso main square (which is actually somewhat circular and used for local festivals and bullfights).\n\nThe history of Ribera del Duero is inextricably linked with winemaking and wine culture. For centuries vineyards have covered the land, stretching as far back as the Roman times. Winemaking has been a part of Ribera culture and tradition throughout every period of history since, even acting as part of daily life for medieval monasteries in the area. In this sense, one cannot visit Ribera del Duero without finding some trace of ancient or modern winemaking culture.\n\nDespite its long history, Ribera del Duero was not put on the wine map until Robert Parker gave one of its wines a Parker score of nearly 100; in other words, perfection. This score brought the world´s attention to Ribera del Duero, which has since shown the world the deep, complex and structured red wines that it produces each year.\n\nThe area has wineries for every person´s tastes: spectacular wineries such as Protos or Portia that offer vanguard architecture, chateau style wineries surrounded by vineyards and small family run wineries, each a testimony to Ribera´s incredible wine history. The best way to enjoy wine country is with a Ribera del Duero wien tour that may depart from Madrid (so no overnight is needed) or from one of the hotels in the region.\n\nWhat are the zarceras? The word zarceras is not a common term in Spanish, let alone English. The zarceras are visible to any person who visits Peñafiel or Pequera del Duero- they are mismatched stone domes, as tall as men, that pop out of the ground like giant mushrooms. Links to the outside world, the zarceras go deep underground into the ancient caves that used to be used to store wine in ancient times. Allowing air to enter the caves and CO2 to leave, the zarceras were a fundamental part of wine fermentation in times gone by. Look out for them as you pass through the region."
