        "text": "Have you ever toured a castle while sipping on a delicious glass of wine? Castle hopping in Europe can be quite the adventure, especially when they’re located in wine country. Sprawled atop hills, vineyards or overlooking charming middle age villages, medieval castles and ruins of yore spark the imagination in all of us. Spend the night in a Tuscan castle located in the Chianti region or learn about a 13th century German knight while sipping on local Riesling wines.\n\nLocated in the hearts of wine regions such as Italy, Spain, Tuscany, Austria and more, these preserved medieval castles —some credited as UNESCO World Heritage sites—not only stroke your curiosity of the past but also fill your soul with historic wines.\n\nHere are 12 castles to visit in famed European wine regions.\n\nSchloss Lieser\n\nLieser, Germany\n\nThis historic 19th century castle was the former home of German politician Eduard Puricelli and is nestled in the heart of the Mosel region—known for some of the finest white wines in the world—surrounded by vineyards with breathtaking views of the Mosel River. Acquired by the Marriott Hotel’s Autograph Collection, Schloss Lieser has been beautifully restored to its former glory as a luxury boutique hotel. Its furnished rooms have been redesigned to the popular romantic style of the time featuring antique chairs, tables and original portraits of German nobility.\n\nThe castle has experiences for guests of all ages with various amenities located on and off the grounds. Flora lovers can take a stroll through the elegant castle grounds, wine lovers can partake in a Riesling wine tasting session on the terrace or enjoy the villages along the Moselle River in a canoe or on a paddle board.\n\nBurg Hornberg Castle\n\nNeckarzimmern, Germany\n\nLocated along the romantic Neckertal (Neckar Valley), Hornberg Castle of knight Götz of Berlichingen, was once known for its long standing feuds with the Catholic diocese of Speyer. Today, this historic 11th century fortress serves as a boutique hotel and restaurant with repurposed tower rooms, suites and terraces that offer panoramic views of the surrounding vineyards located on the picturesque valley’s slopes.\n\nThis ancient castle is also a prominent vineyard and has a wine bar across from the gate entrance which doubles as a ticket office for castle tours. The combo wine store and museum offer a glimpse into the past as well as partake in sampling a wide variety of the local wines while browsing the winemaking equipment.\n\nResidencia Real Castillo de Curiel\n\nRibera del Duero Madrid, Spain\n\nRibera del Duero is not only home to Tempranillo, a single-varietal grape that accounts for more than half of the region’s vines, it’s also home to some of the oldest relics of Spanish history—royal castles. Castillo de Curiel is a 7th to 11th century fortress that sits on top of a rock on a hill in the heart of the Duero Valley.\n\nBuilt as royal property for the various Castilian-Leonese Kings who once resided there, it later served as a prison for nobles and kings for nearly two centuries. Now fully restored as a luxury hotel complex, its historic charm with modern facilities attracts tourists seeking tastings of the local Spanish wines, vineyard hikes and horseback riding.\n\nThe Alhambra Fortress\n\nGranada, Spain\n\nSet against the beautiful backdrop of the Sierra Nevada mountains, the Alhambra is a majestic 9th century relic that was once a Muslim palatine city, military fortress, Moorish palace, a Christian Royal House and the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. This UNESCO World Heritage Site sits atop the hill overlooking the city of Granada and offers day and night tour strolls of the palace halls, monuments, exhibits, GeneralLife Gardens and more.\n\nAfter the tour, head to one of the many beautiful wineries and partake in tastings of local Andalusian wines, including its famous fortified Jerez wines, aka Sherry.\n\nChâteau de Chenonceau Castle\n\nTouraine Loire Valley, France\n\nNicknamed the “Ladies Château” as it was built, protected and restored by notable women such as Diane de Poitiers and Queen Catherine de Medici, Château de Chenonceau has been a treasure of the Loire Valley since the 16th century. Its five arches span the banks of the Cher River, surrounded by vineyards that produce fruitful and complex red and white Touraine Chenonceaux wines.\n\nThere are plenty of things to do and see in the area but if you prefer to stay on the castle grounds.
