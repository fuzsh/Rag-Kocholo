        "text": "Wine from Bodegas Comenge is made from the estate’s 15 unique vineyards in the heart of the so-called Golden Mile of the Ribera del Duero in the municipalities of Curiel and Pesquera de Duero. The entire vineyard is grown under the principles and practices of organic farming and it is certified as organic. The variety of the soils on which the vines grow means we can give our wines the unique and unrepeatable character of each vintage\n\nMade exclusively in excellent vintages. Estate wine, made with the grapes of our Pago de las Hontanillas vineyard of only 2.7 hectares with a calcareous soil, planted at 900 metres above sea level in Pesquera de Duero. Its moderate production and the peculiar aromatic character of this Tempranillo creates one of the iconic wines of the Ribera del Duero region.\n\nIts long ageing (between 20 and 24 months) includes the use of only new French oak barrels. The wine is characterised by its intense colour and its powerful bouquet, full of fruit, flowers and spice, aromas of scrubland herbs, cocoa, spices and tobacco… This wine is pleasure personified.\n\nMade with grapes from our oldest vineyard, Pago de los Ismas, this wine pays tribute to the great wines of the Ribera del Duero region. If the Tempranillo variety grown in the Ribera del Duero is characterised by anything at all, it is its excellent capacity for ageing and lying in the bottle. The wine is kept in new and one-year-old barrels of French oak for between 24 and 27 months, giving it time to grow in intensity, elegance, finesse and persistence in the mouth.\n\nThis wine represents the unique character of each vintage of Bodegas Comenge. It is made from the coupage of 17 micro-plots of organic vineyard of the Tempranillo variety, looked after very carefully. Vineyards planted on clayey and calcareous slopes in Curiel and Pesquera de Duero, one of the areas with the highest-quality grapes in the Ribera del Duero region. Each plot is aged in French oak barrels for 12 to 15 months and the final product is blended together at the end of the ageing process. It then shows the whole personality of our land, Ribera del Duero: freshness, power and elegance in a glass of wine.\n\nThis is the youngest wine at the winery. Its name is reminiscent of the Emperor Tiberius, nicknamed by his troops as “Biberius” because of his passion for the wine of this land.\n\nEvery year we make it with the Tempranillo grapes from our vineyards of Los Silos and Carrapiñel, certified as organic, together with the wine made using the grapes of other traditional vineyards of the Ribera del Duero. Biberius shows the fruity, lively and busy character of the Tempranillo variety.\n\nAware of the increasingly common tendency to produce sweet and exotic Verdejo wines, we have specially selected the vineyards and winemaking techniques in an attempt to remain loyal to the character of the variety and the elegant style of our wines.\n\nOur journey as winemakers began with this Verdejo wine. Those first 2,000 bottles caused a sensation and remain as a guide for the style of our Verdejo: elegant and deep, somewhat austere, like the land from which it comes.\n\nAn exquisite culture A symbol of the road. A unique character. An unrepeatable harvest. Jacobus is the traveller’s dream, the dream of those who seek the essence of the land, who are aware of their origin, who savour a unique grape and enjoy purity made sublime by the passage of time. It is the answer we sought years ago: how to stop time and preserve the soul of a wine, its origin, its identity. Imagination, audacity and research at the service of natural wine, of its terroir.\n\nThis wine is made of grapes from a beautiful vineyard planted in 1921 in Hontoria de Valdearados (Burgos), a garden of Albillo Mayor vines mixed with Tempranillo and other red varieties, also used to make our unique ‘Carmen by Comenge’ claret.\n\nThe soil has a clay loam texture with moderate limestone content. The vineyard’s location, halfway up the hillside in a forest of oaks, holm oaks and junipers, protects it from the frost and constitutes a wonderful ecosystem in itself.\n\nThe vineyard is run by Marcos, its owner, using the manual techniques and traditions passed down by his ancestors. Grown organically, each vintage year expresses the purity and originality of this exclusive variety from Ribera del Duero, which is unfortunately quite scarce nowadays.\n\nThis wine arises from a wonderful, centenary vineyard in Hontoria de Valdearados, hidden in a corner of the mountain and sheltered by holm oaks, oaks and junipers. A vineyard made up of the varieties traditionally grown in Ribera del Duero, it forms a wonderful mosaic of colours and flavours. The majority of its vines are Albillo, an almost forgotten white grape from Ribera del Duero. Fresh, golden and subtly perfumed, it is always present in the traditional wine of this land: claret."
