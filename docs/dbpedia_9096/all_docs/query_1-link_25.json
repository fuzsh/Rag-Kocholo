        "text": "Del Duero Wines is the result of incommensurate love for wine combined with a neverending pursuit of craft, well done things.\n\nDel Duero Wines is a project created to share our passion for fine wines. Founded by Daniel Aragon and Natalie Franco, Del Duero Wines aspires to be your go-to for the best Spanish Fine Wines.\n\nMeet our Founder\n\nDidn't take much longer for Daniel's palate to develop and provide him with countless moments of happiness finding and tasting his region's wines. Suprisingly, his curiosity for all the wine that Spain has to offer didn't trigger until a few years later, when his relocation to the US took him through an educational journey that continues today, with Del Duero Wines, discovering countless Spanish big and small producers.\n\nA view from the Curiel de Duero Castle, now re-purposed as a hotel\n\nLove for Craft\n\nNatalie, Architect from the rich, colourful and vibrant culture of Mexico, understands well the value of craft projects. A perfectionist herself, she's always been fascinated by natural environments and organic shapes and processes. Natalie has witnessed and experienced the inherent passion in artisans who can create and inspire.\n\nDel Duero Wines' appreciation of small wineries and enological project was clearly inspired by Natalie's background and interests. She's responsible for the saying \"It tastes better now!\" after hearing a great story in a tasting. And she's right. It does taste better. It is thanks to these stories that we learn to appreciate what we have and Del Duero Wines wants to make the story behind just as important as the wine itself.\n\nLike airing, stories behind bottles make wine taste better. We appreciate that.\n\nOur Mission\n\nFrom Ribera and Rioja's most renowned brands to hidden gems in the Canary Islands, our objective is to bring more wines to the US that aren't already industrialised or heavily imported. Almost weekly, we approach and learn from Spanish producers that are doing all the right things and can't wait to share with you. We feel responsible for helping wine artisans who want to have their spot out there.\n\nThis project means the world to us and we can't wait to taste and share stunning bottles with you. Together.\n\nPlease join us, talk to us and tell us what you'd like to see in the store. Del Duero Wines was born to serve the needs of all fellow wine fans!\n\nThank you!\n\nDaniel and Natalie, from Del Duero Wines."
