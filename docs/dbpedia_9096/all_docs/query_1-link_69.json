        "text": "We absolutely loved our stay at this castle hotel! The location, high on a hill, provided breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside. It felt like we were transported back in time with the antique furnishings and the charming atmosphere. The staff was friendly and attentive, making us feel like royalty. We enjoyed taking a dip in the outdoor swimming pool and relaxing on the sun terrace. The complimentary bottle of red wine in our room was a nice touch. We also appreciated the convenient amenities, such as the in-room safe, mini-bar, and sitting area. it was a unique and luxurious experience that we would highly recommend to our friends.\n\nOur friends should definitely consider staying at this hotel if they want a truly unforgettable and luxurious experience.\n\nWe had an amazing castle experience during our recent trip! The surroundings were stunning, and the staff were very helpful. The food was delicious and authentic, and we loved the courtyard with its beautiful fountain. The rooms were perfect and offered all the necessary amenities. The highlight was the beautiful gardens with a view of the rolling hills of Spain. Plus, it was conveniently located close to popular tourist attractions and shopping centers. We would definitely consider staying here again!\n\nWhile we loved the castle, we found the Wi-Fi to be spotty throughout our stay, which made it difficult to stay connected with loved ones back home. while the hotel is conveniently located, there were limited entertainment options within walking distance.\n\nThe staff were extremely friendly and professional. the location offers stunning views of the countryside and the nearby village. the food at the restaurant was excellent, and the complimentary bottle of wine was a nice touch. the corner room we stayed in was lovely. There is also a small pool for a refreshing dip on hot days. Don't miss the Sunday wine tour!\n\nFelt like VIPs, no complaints.\n\nThe hotel is situated on top of an idyllic hill with amazing views! the romantic setting and the fact you are in the midst of a vineyard makes this hotel a great place to escape and relax. the room was cozy and nicely decorated with antique pieces. the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, welcoming me with a smile. the restaurant offered appetizing dishes and great service!\n\nThe bathroom was small, not really up to standard and could use some updates. it was a bit of a hassle to find nearby activities or places to explore outside the hotel.\n\nWe had a unique and memorable experience staying at this luxurious hilltop castle turned boutique hotel. The location, nestled in the beautiful Spanish countryside, was just perfect for exploring the nearby wine region. Only a short distance from Peñafiel and several wineries, it provided us with a convenient base for our wine tour.\n\nThis hotel is highly recommended for families looking for a luxurious and comfortable stay in the countryside."
