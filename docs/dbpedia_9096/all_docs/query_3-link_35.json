        "text": "We are dedicated to bringing imaginations from the world of ideas to the real world Year 1920 Great-grandfather Ciriaco makes his first vintage debut\n\nYear 1953 VINATERÍA YÁÑEZ is born in Madre Sacramento 16, Zaragoza, selling wine in bulk.\n\nYear 1976 Grandfather José opens the old restaurant HUMILDE RINCÓN in Madre Sacramento 16. The link with\n\ngastronomy, food and wine pairings, haute cuisine, from then to nowadays.\n\nYear 1984 Ciriaco joins the company. The wine shop begins to stock the best wines in the world. EL TALLER YÁÑEZ is\n\nborn to create its own wines under the guidance of our still young Ciriaco Yáñez. Today the workshop has led 36 wine\n\nprojects all over the world. Always with the aim of learning and enjoying and making enjoyable wines. We make wines\n\nas we like them to be: character, enthusiasm, terroir, personality. For the labels we use Ciriaco's paintings that we\n\nthink express the personality of the wines.\n\nYear 1985 Our Ciriaco publishes his first book \"Mis platos, flores, vinos y música escogidos\" (My chosen dishes, flowers,\n\nwines and music). To date, he has published 33 books on food and wine, travels, novels and poetry,\n\nYear 1986 the MARIDADAS YÁÑEZ TASTING ROOM is born in Madre Sacramento 16 with the idea of spreading and\n\nmaking known the ways and manners of wine tasting and its correspondence with gastronomy. Courses, Workshops...\n\nYear 1987 and following years La Vinatería Yáñez gives away 10,000 free tastings to spread the culture of wine. These\n\nwere very interesting years in which the winery made a great effort to make wine, culture, gastronomy and the\n\nillusions of the Workshop and the Yáñez Winery known. 10,000 free tastings were given away, shared and enjoyed\n\nwith 10,000 Zaragozans.\n\nYear 1987 saw the birth of the Brotherhood of the Mester de Vinatería, an initiative in which food and wine lovers\n\ngathered under the roof of the Yáñez workshop to enjoy, get to know, try, taste, learn to cook, learn to taste and, in\n\nshort, share a space, an idea, a philosophy and a desire to live.\n\nYear 1988 saw the birth of the Yáñez organic vegetable garden to supply the restaurant, the tasting room and the\n\nfamily with seasonal produce.\n\nYear 1989 saw the birth of our first virtual wine shop. We spent a lot of money at that time and it never worked,\n\namong other things because the internet was very slow and it was very difficult, we didn't know how to position it and\n\nit was a real disaster, but we were at the forefront of innovation, our first virtual shop.\n\nYear 1990 our magazine El lagar y la almazara is born. Our collaboration with television begins, the programme En la\n\ncocina con Ciriaco is born, the programme El rincón del vino is born. Collaboration with the radio station SER, Hola\n\nZaragoza, is born. Ciriaco publishes some articles in the Heraldo de Aragón, we meet some very interesting people\n\nwho enrich us deeply, we collaborate and we see other points of view about wine and communication. It was fun.\n\nYear 1991 the Tasting Room moves to Madre Sacramento 18. A beautiful place with a basement that will give us a lot\n\nof play in the future and with the kitchen in sight, a space without distances in which to share gastronomy and wines,\n\nin which to share friendship and in which to enjoy everything that we are creating at that moment, helping to outline\n\nthe enogastronomic culture of our street, of our city.\n\nYear 1992 In the old tasting room at 18 Madre Sacramento Street there was a cellar, where the Yáñez wine bank was\n\nborn, some holes created to deposit wines that were used up in the tastings or in the Humble restaurant.\n\nYear 1996 The gastronomic consultancy was born. The idea is to try to learn at the same time as we collaborate with\n\ndifferent establishments to find out how and in what way gastronomic concepts evolve, both for us and for our\n\ncollaborators. A gastronomic consultancy based on feedback, what we contribute and what they contribute to us. In\n\ngastronomic consultancy we only collaborate with projects in which we feel identified, with which we can\n\ncommunicate and communicate and with which we share values and objectives.\n\nYear1988 The embryo of the reference library was born. And more than 3000 volumes accompany and illustrate us.\n\nYear 1999 The Yáñez workshop reached maturity. The projects have been creating great wines and we decide that\n\nfrom the year 2000, in the new millennium, we will decide that our shelves in the wine shop will only contain products\n\nthat we imagine and make on our own, with colleagues, with partners, wines that we feel identified with. Wines,\n\ndistillates, beers, gastronomy and art. This is our objective for the future millennium\n\nYear 2000 Our Ciriaco surprises us, he decides to make a research trip around the world. There will be 48 countries,\n\nat different times, over the next 2 years. Both the world of wine and the world of gastronomy of Taller Yáñez, the\n\nworld of experiences, empathy and enjoyment will be enriched forever.\n\nYear 2001 our grandfather José retires and in his honour the Humble Gastronomic Workshop is born to investigate about\n\nenogastronomy. During these years we will research on bread, on his old dishes and we will redefine them and put them in\n\njars so that people can take them away, so that customers can enjoy them, so that his friends who ate his dishes at the\n\nHumble's table can take them away and eat them at home. At the moment there are 30 pâtés, almost 60 different dishes\n\nand almost 100 breads of different traditions. The breads are eaten at the tastings, the best being the roasted truffle bread.\n\nYear 2002 The first solo exhibition of our Ciriaco. Large formats, recycled materials are the supports of the painting collected\n\nin the street until today, from a ceramic of 6x6 centimetres to a mural of 16 metres by 3 metres high built with the boards\n\nof the old wine shop in Madre Sacramento 16. We link the old and the new.\n\nYear 2003 the cheese workshop was born to recover the tradition of our great-grandfather Felipe of making cheese. We\n\nmake cheeses and mature them: We consume them at tastings\n\nYear 2004 the Taller Yáñez Destilados Nobles was born with the idea of understanding the world of distillates. Today we\n\nhave six hundred and ninety-three distillates full of soul and reflection.\n\nYear 2005 the Experimentation Workshop was born just around the corner, at Doctor Horno 18. A space with the kitchen\n\nintegrated into the room, with no distances, no escape. 40 m2 full of technology from the main houses that collaborate with\n\nthe Workshop, a Workshop of experimentation designed by the Zaragozan company Office Hogar. Undoubtedly, a point and\n\nfollowed in the trajectory of experimentation of our Workshop. The best electrical appliances, the best techniques in a\n\nbeautiful space full of heart.\n\nYear 2010 Taller Yáñez cerveza Única was born with the idea of getting to know the world of beer. Today we have 160\n\ndifferent small batch beers, from barrel-aged beers to beers brewed with all possible types of cereals and their\n\ncombinations. An unfathomable world.\n\nYear 2012 Yáñez Almacenista is born to channel the brews in which we collaborate as ideologists, and which we make in\n\ncollaboration with other companies.\n\nYear 2015 EL TALLER Y LA VINATERÍA moves to Madre Sacramento 11 with the idea of having a space where to show our\n\nimaginations, illusions, ideas. A space designed by our main artist, our not so young Ciriaco Yáñez.\n\nToday we are still searching and fighting for creative freedom, trying to unite wine, gastronomy, spirits and beers. We unite\n\nthem in our tastings, at our table. And we keep thinking about going out of our comfort zone, investigating, doing new things\n\nand offering them to you here.\n\nYear 2016 Almacenista is born, a project to make design wines in different areas that we cannot reach physically but we can\n\nreach philosophically. We order the wines and we identify them as Almacenista, wines a bit different, with our own\n\npersonality, ciriaquiles wines.\n\nYear 2017 The gastronomic workshop continues its research. Now on vinegar, salt, chocolate, confectionery, etc.\n\nYear 2018 we open a new Yáñez Amazon Store. We celebrate our sixty-fifth anniversary at Madre Sacramento 11, in\n\nZaragoza, Spain. And a new stage begins in which we unite tradition, work, effort; we look to the future in the confidence\n\nof being, serving, imagining, doing. We open our new shop in collaboration with Amazon and the desire to serve, to tell our\n\nlittle story, to imagine and dream. Yáñez in Madre Sacramento11, Zaragoza, Spain. Yáñez from imagination to the real world.\n\nWe open with the desire to improve every day.\n\nYear 2019 The Yáñez wine workshop updates the concept of old wines and offers them in bulk, as always.\n\nYear 2020 The alcohol-free Yáñez workshop. For people who can't or don't want to drink alcohol, the Yáñez Workshop\n\nwithout alcohol... So we have been researching and preparing lots of things. Wines, beers, distillates. The same quality with\n\nthe same enthusiasm but no alcohol.\n\nYear 2020 The Yáñez workshop soft drinks. One of the fun things we do is to imagine things and harmonise them with what\n\nwe are already doing. For vermouth we were thinking of a siphon and for gins we were thinking of tonics, for vodkas we\n\nwere thinking of something different, a lime soda and for rums a different cola. For brandies, brandies or cocktails, many\n\nthings. El Taller Yáñez soft drinks, different to combine with our Taller Yáñez.\n\nYear 2020 El Taller Yáñez cider. A natural evolution of brewing, ciders have been in our sights for a long time, and now we\n\nfinally have 7 new ciders, made from organic apples picked by ourselves and fermented in our brewery. Ice cider, sour cider,\n\nsweet cider and sparkling cider.\n\nYear 2020 Explosion of the Yáñez wine workshop projects. France, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Chile and Spain, lots of Spain.\n\nYear 2021 Digitisation and pickles.\n\nYear 2022 Digitisation and cured meats.\n\nWhere is the workshop? Very close to the Yáñez wine shop in Doctor Horno 18, in a small\n\nspace with a wooden floor, large windows and a beautiful kitchen. A space to investigate, to\n\nreceive friends and to exhibit.\n\nWhat is the workshop? It is the realisation of an old dream of Ciriaco&#39;s, to have a space where\n\nto paint, receive friends, cook and taste our dishes, attend the customers we advise, taste and\n\ndevelop our wines, and those we decide to integrate into the selection of the winery. It is the\n\nheadquarters of the brotherhood of the mester de vinatería and of our biodynamic project &quot;a\n\nroad to heaven&quot;. A place to share.\n\nHow was it born? With the design of the interior designer Carlos Sancho we decided that the\n\nspace should be white, functional and variable. Suitable for cooking and offering a dinner, as\n\nwell as for reflecting, programming a tasting course, a cooking course, developing Ciriaco&#39;s\n\ncoaching work and, of course, there should be space for painting. The collaboration of our\n\nsponsors has been fundamental to achieve this: Office Hogar, Salvarani, Kitchenaid, Franke,\n\nMármol compac, Bra, the Yáñez wine shop, bodega pirineos, Yáñez wine company, etc.\n\nWhy was the workshop born? In the Yanez wine shop we have always had a small space\n\nattached to the shop where we held tastings and meetings, the hojarasca, the first room for\n\npaired tastings, the humble... In this space we have all the comforts and new projection\n\ntechnology that we could not even imagine at the time. The workshop was born out of the\n\ndesire to study and share confidences with wine and gastronomy as protagonists.\n\nWhen does the workshop open?\n\nThe workshop is always busy in some of its activities. If you would like to come and try the\n\ngastronomic proposal, reserve the workshop table for the date you need. The minimum group\n\nsize is six people. The activities are advertised on our website and in the monthly newsletter.\n\nWhat is the workshop for?\n\nTo discover things about wine, gastronomy and ourselves. To learn and to spread the word.\n\nHow much does the gastronomic proposal cost?\n\nThe price is invariable, always 36 euros vat included. So that there are no surprises, everything\n\nis included.\n\nWhere can I book? At ciriacoyanez@gmail.com, on our telephone number 976214855, or at\n\nour wine shop in madre sacramento 16 in Zaragoza.\n\nWhat do you eat?\n\nEvery week everything changes and evolves. During the week Ciriaco develops the ideas that\n\ninterest him, the results we like the most are the ones we propose. There are usually about ten\n\ndishes, including starters, main courses, ante-desserts and desserts. Plus cocktails. And four or\n\nsix wines are tasted, depending on the pairings.\n\nHow is the service?\n\nFun, relaxed and eager for everyone to enjoy a new experience. Everyone sees how Ciriaco\n\ncooks and prepares the dishes, as he is the one who brings them to the tables. Communication\n\nis assured. There is only one service per day... or none at all. It starts at 9 p.m. and ends at\n\nmidnight, Cinderella&#39;s carriage and home, or a night out... it&#39;s up to you.\n\nHow would you describe the workshop kitchen?\n\nIn the workshop there are many things, painting, expression, discussion, reflection? The other\n\nday Ciriaco told us: &quot;if I were to give a name to this food, I would say that it is the food of\n\nfeelings&quot;. The food of feelings... it&#39;s beautiful, don&#39;t you think?\n\nWhy are they, including the wines?\n\nOne of the ideas that encourages us is to create dishes so that our wines, the ones we make,\n\nthe ones we select or simply the ones we like, can express themselves. Wine is fundamental to\n\nour culinary experience.\n\nBy including them we prevent the proposal from being distorted. We want anyone to be able\n\nto come.\n\nHow much does the proposal cost?\n\nThe workshop table costs 36 euros vat included, for groups of a minimum of six people.\n\nWhy does the proposal change every week?\n\nCiriaco&#39;s work is evolutionary. It is not the creation of new concepts but rather the exploration\n\nof little-trodden paths, of dishes that tell a story... Ciriaco has been making a dish, foie, for\n\ntwenty-six years. And every week it is different. Sometimes he goes a long way forward,\n\nsometimes he goes backwards in search of concepts that he has not fully developed. It is not a\n\ncuisine of revolution for the sake of revolution, but of loving evolution with a dish, with a\n\nconcept... It is not difficult to evolve, but it is difficult to innovate. We also document the new\n\ndishes with the presentations of the moment and it is curious to see how the presentation\n\nchanges at the same time as the chef&#39;s paintings change.\n\nDo they make a lot of mistakes?\n\nUmmm , yes, we throw a lot of things away. It is also true that Ciriaco almost always sees the\n\nfinal result with his imagination before the equipment and it is fun, because if the product is\n\nexpensive he warns us from the start to think it through, if it is affordable he lets us make\n\nmistakes, although then we have to clean it all up.\n\nThere are restaurants that have a workshop, you are a workshop without a restaurant, is that a\n\ncontradiction in terms?\n\nWe are not a restaurant, that is part of our philosophy, we don&#39;t want to depend on turnover\n\nto survive, nor do we want the day-to-day hustle and bustle of a catering establishment to\n\nprevent us from spending a day to come up with an idea. The idea is to have a studio space\n\nand from time to time, preferably on Fridays or Saturdays, to see live and direct if what we do\n\nis to our liking. The members of the brotherhood of the mester de vinateria are good eaters\n\nand extraordinary friends. When they eat, we know if we have made the right choice. We also\n\nadvise restaurants and wineries. It is our way of growing and becoming better professionals,\n\nwe owe it to our customers, both in the wine shop and in the restaurants.\n\nWhat would you say the workshop is like?\n\nThe workshop is a space for sharing, a space in search of harmony and balance. A space that\n\nprojects itself forward lightly and very respectful of everything that surpasses us.\n\nWhere do you shop? Now the world is small, everything is very close. Even so, the most\n\nimportant thing is the organic vegetable garden that supplies us with almost everything and\n\nwhich is run by our father. The markets close to the workshop are fundamental to avoid\n\ncontamination, the new ecological markets that are organised in Zaragoza, long or short trips,\n\nand people who call us to offer us curious things. If something is strange, some trader will\n\nthink it is ideal for us, it will end up on our worktop.\n\nIs there any influence in your kitchen?\n\nThousands! Ciriaco is a fan of Adriá. In the workshop we have all the books published by El\n\nBullí, the TV programmes... Total fan. He&#39;s almost a Bullí freak, that&#39;s all I can say. Also, Arzak,\n\nSubijana, Santamaría, Roca, Ruscalleda, Arola, Aduriz and the master Luis Iciar... In the library\n\nwe have hundreds of volumes on cooking, art... so that when we can&#39;t think of anything, we\n\ncan open a book and from there the sky is the limit. It can be an illustration, a painting, a\n\nbuilding, a dish... whatever. Sometimes we have prepared lists of products but it&#39;s not our\n\nthing, we need more alcohol to light the fuse.\n\nCan you explain to me... I don&#39;t understand this definition of that food of feelings!\n\nYou see, Ciriaco develops the dishes from ideas, visions, feelings, memories... A fish eaten in\n\nthe Mecong delta led us to our version of elephant fish. Another fish eaten at dawn in a\n\npinnace on the Niger River led us to our grilled fish, a green mango picked in the Dogon\n\ncountry led us to our grilled mango with chicken confit. A green pineapple picked by our father\n\nled to our pine nut caviar. A salmon sashimi in Kyoto led to our fake salmon sashimi with\n\nsmoked air. A yak penis soup led us to our criadillas with truffled eggs.... How to pin those\n\ninasibles on a plate? That&#39;s the aim.\n\nWhat do you think of Asian cuisine?\n\nWe love it. Ciriaco has travelled all over Asia several times and he is an admirer of Thailand,\n\nVietnam, China, Macao, Hong Kong, Japan... In our developments there is always something\n\nthat reminds us of the Orient, even if it is only the aesthetics.\n\nHow do you define the food you make?\n\nCiriaco has already commented that he would like to feel this cuisine as the cuisine of feelings,\n\nof harmony, of balance, of sharing.\n\nDo you make a technological cuisine? If it is a workshop, that would be the right thing to do?\n\nNo, we are not interested in technology for the sake of it. We are looking for balance, if a\n\ntechnique is necessary and we have access to it, that&#39;s fine, but it&#39;s not the objective in itself.\n\nIt&#39;s just something else that helps us to express the feeling of the dish, its story.\n\nWhat trajectory can chef Ciriaco showcase?\n\nWell, he doesn&#39;t really exhibit any. Childhood and adolescence watching his father cook in the\n\nhumble corner, the first paired tasting room, the hojarasca, the humble, and always the Yáñez\n\nwine shop of course... Ciriaco is not a chef, he is simply someone curious, with a good palate, a\n\ngood taste memory and who loves to learn, to experiment. He is not someone who can pull\n\nout his CV and impress, because that CV is limited to being a shopkeeper. He is simply a\n\ncreative person who applies his working method to the kitchen. When he was young, he was a\n\ntotal Bullinian, and he still is in the way he approaches the concept. Then, with oriental\n\ninfluences, he returned to traditional cooking and now he simply wants to tell stories, to\n\nexpress feelings. Ciriaco doesn&#39;t like to be called a chef, he believes that a chef is a leader who\n\ngenerates a positive vibe in the kitchen that makes the dishes come out full of magic. We look\n\nfor feeling, welcoming and sharing. Student suits Ciriaco more than chef. He is more of a\n\nstudent than a teacher.\n\nHow are the dishes presented?\n\nIn many different ways, some are presented as authentic painted pictures, others are served in\n\ncocktail glasses or crystal glasses. Some are presented on trays for diners to serve themselves,\n\nothers are skewered on skewers, soup spoons... It&#39;s all very eclectic. The idea is not to be\n\nimprisoned by a specific way of doing things. The truffled potatoes come out on a platter, they\n\nlook beautiful... the cheeks on a plate with the sweet potato purée and the sauce painted\n\naround them. The salmorejo three textures in a cocktail glass, the ribs confit on a simple tray\n\nto eat with your hands, the truffle ravioli in a soup spoon, as well as the false caviars, the steak\n\nis served on a plate with potato charcoal... Each story has a different rhythm and a different\n\nform. Poetry is not the same as essays or novels. Here it is the same.\n\nWho serves?\n\nCiriaco himself prepares the dishes and brings them to the workshop table. Bear in mind that\n\nhe&#39;s usually with only a few people so he can tell the story. The idea is that there is no\n\ndistance, within courtesy of course.\n\nHow do you think?\n\nYou&#39;ll see, we&#39;ve already talked about it many times, but of the methods of creation:\n\nassociation, adaptation, deconstruction, Ciriaco and all of us are left with inspiration. It is\n\nperhaps the most elusive but also the most beautiful because the starting point can be any\n\nmagical moment, any feeling. Ciriaco has dishes like our version of fish and chips, which is a lot\n\nof fun, that&#39;s adaptation. Dishes like the Provençal ribs with truffled potatoes that are from\n\nassociation, minimalism like the truffle with balsamic vinegar... but it is in the inspiration\n\nwhere the feelings come out, the sole with Iberian jowl, the foie with minitatin... Inspiration is\n\nour deepest source, imagining a result and jumping to achieve it.\n\nWhat do you intend to do in the workshop?\n\nIt&#39;s simple, to share and enjoy with friends the food and what it suggests to us, the stories that\n\nhave created it, the feelings it provokes, the feelings it awakens.\n\nWhat is your kitchen physically like?\n\nCarlos Sancho, our great friend and interior designer with a special knowledge of the\n\nphilosophy and aesthetics that Ciriaco defends, not in vain he is one of the art collectors who\n\ntreasures more pieces of Ciriaco, made a first drawing, Ciriaco made him a gin and tonic, he\n\nmade another one for himself and when dawn came they had drawn an immaculate kitchen.\n\nThe best support was chosen: the new compac marble surface, the induction cooker from\n\nKitchenaid, their new ovens, the steam column, the cold equipment and the design of franke&#39;s\n\nwells... Then Ciriaco told us that he wanted to use cast aluminium as a material and we went\n\nto see BRA products... so it was a very natural thing. We were looking for the best, what best\n\nsuited the philosophy that Ciriaco wanted to express. Everything was done in six hours, but of\n\ncourse, with the combined experience of both of us and hundreds of kitchens seen, used, felt.\n\nAfter seeing the finished workshop and using the design Ciriaco tells us many times how happy\n\nhe is with the marble worktop so beautiful that it looks like a painting, with the kitchenaid\n\ninduction hob that allows us to adjust the temperature with total precision, with the cast\n\naluminium... Sometimes you manage to capture a lifetime of observation in an instant. Our\n\nkitchen is born in an instant with the experience of twenty years. With the feeling of a lifetime\n\nof experiences and the complicity between Carlos and Ciriaco.\n\nThe workshop team?\n\nCiriaco is in the workshop and the rest of us come and go. We get together to eat, to share\n\nnew creations. We get together when we have ideas to tell or crazy things to try to capture.\n\nCiriaco, Carlos, Beatriz, Javier with his contributions, María, Antonio with his timely comments,\n\ndon José who brings us all the vegetables from the garden and his stories of kitchens and\n\nfriends... All the people from kitcheaind who always bring new technologies for us to\n\nexperiment with, the bra team with the latest pieces they have created... A team that is a\n\nfamily, with the desire to share with friends.\n\nHow do you prepare the desserts?\n\nWe almost always have an ante-dessert and three desserts. We love the sweet world and we\n\nalways approach dessert as a complex dish with different textures and temperatures. For\n\nexample, in coconut rice pudding and cinnamon orange crisp we have: coconut rice pudding,\n\ncoconut milk + pineapple + yoghurt, coconut ice cream, orange crisp with hot cinnamon\n\ncaramel, served in a cocktail glass, and we spray coconut flavouring on top. We also like the\n\npastries, such as the mango and olive muffins from Calanda.\n\nthe workshop and the Yáñez wine shop\n\nWe are dedicated to bringing imaginations from the world of ideas to the real world.\n\nYear 1920 Great-grandfather Ciriaco starts his first grape harvest.\n\nYear 1953 VINATERÍA YÁÑEZ is born in Madre Sacramento 16, Zaragoza, selling wine in bulk.\n\nYear 1976 Grandfather José opens the old restaurant HUMILDE RINCÓN in Madre Sacramento\n\n16. The link with gastronomy, food and wine pairings, haute cuisine, from then to nowadays.\n\n1984 Ciriaco joins the company. The wine shop begins to stock the best wines in the world. EL\n\nTALLER YÁÑEZ is born to create its own wines under the guidance of our still young Ciriaco\n\nYáñez. Today, the Workshop has led 86 wine projects around the world, 36 of which have been\n\nconsolidated. Always with the aim of learning and enjoying and making enjoyable wines. We\n\nmake wines as we like them to be: character, enthusiasm, terroir, personality. For the labels\n\nwe use Ciriaco&#39;s paintings that we think express the personality of the wines.\n\n1985 Our Ciriaco publishes his first book &quot;Mis platos, flores, vinos y música escogidos&quot; (My\n\nselected dishes, flowers, wines and music). To date, he has published 33 books on food and\n\nwine, travels, novels and poetry,\n\nThe MARIDADAS YÁÑEZ TASTING ROOM was founded in 1986 in madre sacramento 16 with\n\nthe idea of disseminating and publicising the ways and means of wine tasting and its\n\nrelationship with gastronomy. Courses, Workshops...\n\n1987 and following years La Vinatería Yáñez gives away 10,000 free tastings to spread the\n\nculture of wine. These were very interesting years in which the winery made a great effort to\n\nmake wine, culture, gastronomy and the illusions of the Workshop and the Yáñez Winery\n\nknown. 10,000 free tastings were given, shared and enjoyed with 10,000 Zaragozans Year 1987\n\nthe brotherhood of the Mester de Vinatería was born, an initiative in which wine and food\n\nlovers met under the roof of the Yáñez workshop to enjoy, get to know, taste, taste, learn to\n\ncook, learn to taste and in short share a space, an idea, a philosophy, a desire to live.\n\n1988 saw the birth of the Yáñez organic vegetable garden to supply the restaurant, the tasting\n\nroom and the family with seasonal produce.\n\n1989 saw the birth of our first virtual wine shop. We spent a lot of money at that time and it\n\nnever worked, among other things because the internet was very slow and it was very difficult,\n\nwe didn&#39;t know how to position it and it was a real disaster, but we were at the forefront of\n\ninnovation, our first virtual shop.\n\nIn 1990 our magazine El lagar y la almazara is born. Our collaboration with television begins,\n\nthe programme En la cocina con Ciriaco is born, the programme El rincón del vino is born.\n\nCollaboration with the radio station SER, Hola Zaragoza, is born. Ciriaco publishes some articles\n\nin the Heraldo de Aragón, we meet some very interesting people who enrich us deeply, we\n\ncollaborate and we see other points of view about wine and communication. It was fun.\n\n1991 the Tasting Room moves to Madre Sacramento 18. A beautiful place with a basement\n\nthat will give us a lot of play in the future and with the kitchen in sight, a space without\n\ndistances in which to share gastronomy and wines, in which to share friendship and in which to\n\nenjoy everything that we are creating at that moment, helping to outline the enogastronomic\n\nculture of our street, of our city.\n\n1992 In the old tasting room at 18 Madre Sacramento Street there was a cellar, where the\n\nYáñez wine bank was born, some holes created to deposit wines that were used up in the\n\ntastings or in the Humble Restaurant.\n\n1996 The gastronomic consultancy is born. The idea is to try to learn at the same time as we\n\ncollaborate with different establishments to find out how and in what way gastronomic\n\nconcepts evolve, both for us and for our collaborators. A gastronomic consultancy based on\n\nfeedback, what we contribute and what they contribute to us. In gastronomic consultancy we\n\nonly collaborate with projects with which we feel identified, with which we can communicate\n\nand communicate and with which we share values and objectives.\n\n1988 The embryo of the reference library was born. And more than 3,000 volumes accompany\n\nand illustrate our work.\n\n1999 The Yáñez workshop reached maturity. The projects have been creating great wines and\n\nwe decide that from the year 2000, in the new millennium, we will decide that our shelves in\n\nthe wine shop will only contain products that we imagine and make on our own, with\n\ncolleagues, with partners, wines that we feel identified with. Wines, distillates, beers,\n\ngastronomy and art. This is our objective for the future millennium\n\nYear 2000 Our Ciriaco surprises us, he decides to make a research trip around the world. There\n\nwill be 48 countries, at different times, over the next 2 years. Both the world of wine and the\n\nworld of gastronomy of Taller Yáñez, the world of experiences, empathy and enjoyment will be\n\nenriched forever.\n\nIn 2001 our grandfather José retires and in his honour, in the same space of the old humble\n\ncorner, the Humble Gastronomic Workshop is born to investigate about enogastronomy.\n\nDuring these years we will research on bread, on his old dishes and we will redefine them and\n\nput them in jars so that people can take them away, so that customers can enjoy them, so that\n\nhis friends who ate his dishes at the Humble&#39;s table can take them home and eat them at\n\nhome. At the moment there are 30 pâtés, almost 60 different dishes and almost 100 breads of\n\ndifferent traditions. The breads are eaten at the tastings, the best being the roasted truffle\n\nbread.\n\nYear 2002 The first solo exhibition of our Ciriaco. Large formats, recycled materials are the\n\nsupports of the painting collected in the street until today, from a ceramic of 6x6 centimetres\n\nto a mural of 16 metres by 3 metres high built with the boards of the old wine shop in Madre\n\nSacramento 16. We link the old and the new.\n\nIn 2003 the cheese workshop was born to recover the tradition of our great-grandfather Felipe\n\nof making cheese. We make cheeses and mature them: We consume them at tastings\n\nIn 2004 the Taller Yáñez Destilados Nobles was born with the idea of understanding the world\n\nof distillates. Today we have six hundred and ninety-three distillates full of soul and reflection.\n\nIn 2005 the Experimentation Workshop was born just around the corner, at Doctor Horno 18.\n\nA space with the kitchen integrated into the room, with no distances, no escape. 40 m2 full of\n\ntechnology from the main houses that collaborate with the Workshop, a Workshop of\n\nexperimentation designed by the Zaragozan company Office Hogar. Undoubtedly, a point and\n\nfollowed in the trajectory of experimentation of our Workshop. The best electrical appliances,\n\nthe best techniques in a beautiful space full of heart.\n\nIn 2010 Taller Yáñez cerveza Única was born with the idea of getting to know the world of\n\nbeer. Today we have 160 different small batch beers, from barrel-aged beers to beers brewed\n\nwith all possible types of cereals and their combinations. We brew in small 30-litre barrels,\n\nalways with new recipes, an unfathomable world.\n\nIn 2012 Yáñez Almacenista is born to channel the elaborations in which we collaborate as\n\nideologists, and which we carry out in collaboration with other companies.\n\nYear 2015 EL TALLER Y LA VINATERÍA moves to madre sacramento 11 with the idea of having a\n\nspace where to show our imaginations, illusions, ideas. A space designed by our main artist,\n\nour not so young Ciriaco Yáñez. Today we continue searching and fighting for creative\n\nfreedom, we try to unite wine, gastronomy, spirits and beers. We unite them in our tastings, at\n\nour table. And we keep thinking about going out of our comfort zone, investigating, doing new\n\nthings and offering them to you here.\n\nIn 2016 Almacenista is born, a project to make design wines in different areas that we cannot\n\nreach physically but we can reach philosophically. We order the wines and we identify them as\n\nAlmacenista, wines a bit different, with our own personality, ciriaquiles wines.\n\nYear 2017 The gastronomic workshop continues its research. Now on vinegar, salt, chocolate,\n\nconfectionery, etc.\n\nYear 2018 we open a new Yáñez Amazon Store. We celebrate our sixty-fifth anniversary at\n\nMadre Sacramento 11, in Zaragoza, Spain. And a new stage begins in which we unite tradition,\n\nwork, effort; we look to the future in the confidence of being, serving, imagining, doing. We\n\nopen our new shop in collaboration with Amazon and the desire to serve, to tell our little\n\nstory, to imagine and dream. Yáñez in Madre Sacramento11, Zaragoza, Spain. Yáñez from\n\nimagination to the real world. We open with the desire to improve every day.\n\nYear 2019 The Yáñez wine workshop updates the concept of old wines and offers them in bulk,\n\nas always.\n\nYear 2020 The Yáñez workshop without alcohol. For people who can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to drink\n\nalcohol the Taller Yáñez without alcohol... So we have been researching and preparing lots of\n\nthings. Wines, beers, distillates. The same quality with the same enthusiasm but no alcohol.\n\nYear 2020 The Yáñez workshop soft drinks. One of the fun things we do is to imagine things\n\nand harmonise them with what we are already doing. For vermouth we were thinking of a\n\nsiphon and for gins we were thinking of tonics, for vodkas we were thinking of something\n\ndifferent, a lime soda and for rums a different cola. For brandies, brandies or cocktails many\n\nthings. El Taller Yáñez soft drinks, different to combine with our Taller Yáñez.\n\nYear 2020 El Taller Yáñez cider.
