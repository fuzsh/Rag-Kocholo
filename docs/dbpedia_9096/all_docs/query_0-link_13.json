The area has 28.000 acres in grape production and is home to over 180 vineyards- over 8000 wine producers buy their grapes from this area! Our horseback tour allows you to explore its bountiful landscapes while you taste some of these classic and delicious wines.\n\nThe first two days of the program offer an intense nature experience. You cross parts of the Hoces del Río Duratón Natural Park. In addition to its beautiful nature, this park is notable for its archaeological and historical wealth.\n\nThe remaining four days of the ride follow the course of the Duratón river to its mouth, in the Duero. The river gave the Ribera del Duero region its name. This region, with its riverside areas, is part of the gently rolling Castilian plateau and has sandy soils, making it ideal for horseback riding.\n\nIn addition to riding, cultural experiences and culinary delights play a crucial role on this trip. Visit old monasteries and castles!
