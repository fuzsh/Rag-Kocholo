        "text": "“Palindromes” represents Fuenmayor’s “latest investigations into how images can speak to the dynamics of performing identity, negotiating cultural expectations, address histories of colonial exploitation and unpack tropical self-exotification. These reoccurring interests are particularly addressed in his practice to a pan-Latin American and U.S. Latinx context,” according to curator Tobias Ostrander’s text.\n\nThis year we celebrate our tenth anniversary with a special online sale that brings together a hundred leading artists from Chile and other Latin American countries. The sale will be online throughout May in the new Artishock store, Artishop, hosted at artishockrevista.com/tienda\n\nConvening a critical mass of artists, thinkers and participants, the Dhaka Art Summit 2020 reconsiders (art) histories, movement, borders and fault lines. Its fifth edition, Seismic Movements, takes place February 7-15 at the Shilpakala Academy in Dhaka, Bangladesh, expanding its geographic and temporal scope and looking at movements generated from energy released from pressure -geologically, socially, politically, climatically. Thus, the Summit is not just an exhibition, it is a movement. And is neither a biennale. Although it takes place every two years, this format is simply for organisational and logistical purposes.\n\nThe exhibition «Women Geometers», organized by the Atchugarry Art Center in association with Piero Atchugarry Gallery summons and celebrates the creations of a significant group of twelve Latin American women pioneers proposing a dialogue that is unique in its genre. From different visions and multiple inquiries, all these pioneers extended the confines of geometric abstraction both in the aesthetic field and in territories of the intersection with realms of knowledge, ranging from mathematics to the philosophy of being and the very connection with the body and the erotic sensitivity.\n\nIn her book «Eruptions of Memory» (2018) the French-Chilean theorist Nelly Richard writes about a ‘completed past’ as opposed to a ‘past being completed’, one which is continually being interpreted in new ways and is thus able to withstand rigid standpoints and apathy in the present. On the basis of this idea «Rivers flow out of my eyes» provides a context for a broad range of reflections on periods of political repression and violence. A merely critical and investigative approach is avoided here. Instead the selected works show an emphatic use of ambiguity, fiction, humor, absurdity and poetic images.\n\nPérez Art Museum Miami (PAMM) has just launched the Latin American and Latinx Art Fund, a new affiliate group created to support exhibitions and programming at PAMM for Latin American and Latinx artists. The fund’s goal is to support the exhibitions and programming that PAMM has already become known for, including exhibitions on artists such as Firelei Báez, Carlos Motta, Doris Salcedo, Julio LeParc and upcoming exhibitions of Beatriz González and Teresita Fernández, among others.\n\n«SITElines: New Perspectives on Art of the Americas» is a biennial program organized by SITE Santa Fe (New Mexico, United States) for the years 2014, 2016 and 2018. In its third and last iteration, which opens on August 3 of this year, presents works by 23 artists -including ten new commissions-, under the curatorship of José Luis Blondet, Candice Hopkins and Ruba Katrib, with Naomi Beckwith as Curatorial Advisor. Among the participant artists from Latin America are Paz Errázuriz, Ángela Bonadies & Juan José Olavarría, NuMu, Fernanda Laguna, Naufus Ramirez-Figueroa, Eduardo Navarro and Tania Pérez Córdova.\n\nThe artists featured in «The Matter of Photography» marshal materials far afield of those traditionally associated with picture taking. Drawings and prints, films and installations, photocopies and books are all brought to bear in powerful critiques of the medium’s development and historical functions."
