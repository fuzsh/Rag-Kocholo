Um, you know what? I just mentioned the beginning of the episode while you were living in your green while you were living in this small. Um, forest area in the Suburban Area. So I Want to start by saying that a lot of us as artists think that we necessarily have to be um in a bigger city in a bigger country in all of those things to get where to we need to. So. She probably like you probably are one of a great examples to say that but can you talk a little bit about how did you get that? did you feel like staying there. Um in a small secluded place. Um, how has that contributed to your own career like in in good. Pros and cons both because this is I think a eighty is yet. We All think about as artists don’t we like we think oh I am because I remember when I was living in a bigger City I Always thought that I was taking it was taking away the piece of life like the quality like the slow life that I think a lot of us desire versus.\n\n**** – (): 06:35.54\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): All right? yeah.\n\n**** – (): 06:46.52\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): In.\n\n**** – (): 06:52.80\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): When I’m in a smaller city I always feel like I’m less less exposed or like you know, opportunities and all of that. So tell me your experience.\n\n**** – (): 06:59.60\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): exactly exactly I’m still I’m still not sure which is better for me really I’m still trying to think what I will what I want to do in the next ten years so for me.\n\n**** – (): 07:05.21\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Okay, okay.\n\n**** – (): 07:16.96\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): My actually my my past towards being an artist is not so straightforward and it’s in in in some yeah, it’s in so I don’t I don’t have a University level art degree. Ah.\n\n**** – (): 07:21.27\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Okay, has it ever been.\n\n**** – (): 07:34.00\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Um, okay oh my goodness.\n\n**** – (): 07:35.50\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): I actually have degree in social science and social technologies which is very weird yet on the other hand I I love drawing drawings since I was a child and also.\n\n**** – (): 07:46.81\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Were you drawing Also like all these years before you actually thought you’d do it professionally.\n\n**** – (): 07:53.98\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Ah, yeah, so I I asked my parents to put me into the evening art school and they did but it was it was early years of after after Soviet Era and this school wasn’t.\n\n**** – (): 07:57.59\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Okay, okay.\n\n**** – (): 08:11.18\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Like they are now there wasn’t too modern. It was very academic and soviet approach and it was boring. That’s why I think I never get into University Arts University because I saw it will be boring too. So.\n\n**** – (): 08:27.93\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Um, yeah.\n\n**** – (): 08:30.18\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): I Only later in my twenty s twenty s decided to change the path and start looking into the art again. Yeah.\n\n**** – (): 08:37.96\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, but did you think at that point you wanted to do it as like a profession did you ever think it could turn into a profession.\n\n**** – (): 08:45.57\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): You know? so you know when I was a kid I never I Never ever think what I will do in future Really I wasn’t this dedicated kid like I want to be an artist and or I want to.\n\n**** – (): 08:53.75\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): He met.\n\n**** – (): 09:03.69\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): My parents a journalist so I thought maybe I will be journalist maybe I will be something else so I never had this very dedicated ah attitude. So when I was I had been working in advertising for 4 years after the Uni.\n\n**** – (): 09:03.81\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Oh wow.\n\n**** – (): 09:19.50\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Okay.\n\n**** – (): 09:20.76\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): And that’s when I start thinking that that’s like not really mind seeing my thing so I was working as a copywriter so closer to the journalism to the writing and I decided I maybe want to do something with design and while I’ve been starting design.\n\n**** – (): 09:24.40\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): 10\n\n**** – (): 09:33.34\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yam yeah.\n\n**** – (): 09:40.20\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): As adult I realize that what I’m really interested in is illustration and that’s how I how I how I get there.

First of all it it doesn’t it doesn’t make much sense because you’re still in. Like you, you still have the same opportunity in the city center to verbs. That’s the same especially ki because ki is not really vi city not like London ah yeah, so but I think that.\n\n**** – (): 10:20.12\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Um, yeah, okay, big city. Okay.\n\n**** – (): 10:37.68\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Being in Kiev was okay for me and was good for me and especially when I started out it because sorry.\n\n**** – (): 10:41.97\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): How do define be impact of it. How do I’m can you elaborate on that like how do you think it was good for you.\n\n**** – (): 10:54.79\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Yeah, so ah, first of all, we now have internet and we have social media so we are exposed to all the world and I’ve been working with the clients all over the world and galleries all over the world. So you don’t need to be in specific place.\n\n**** – (): 11:09.35\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n**** – (): 11:12.50\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Now and you even don’t have to have specific agents for like things because you can do it by yourself with a social media and some portfolio website and so on so that is a I think chain. It changed everything like fifty years ago that wasn’t possible and also in Ukraine we have very nice and very quite small, but very great illustrator community illustrators community yes, and.\n\n**** – (): 11:31.31\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, it’s.\n\n**** – (): 11:42.82\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Oh Wow really.\n\n**** – (): 11:47.84\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): I think illustration in Ukraine is blooming. We have a lot of young artists. So it’s like you know we have this new generation of artists and illustrators. Ah they’re quite the same age. So I think like me or younger.\n\n**** – (): 11:49.42\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Wow.\n\n**** – (): 12:04.37\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, yeah.\n\n**** – (): 12:06.51\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Or a little bit a little bit older but this is still like very young scene and there and yeah we have this great pictoric administration club which they are doing a lot of his exhibits for ukrainian artists inside in Ukraine and outside of Ukraine.

A lot of times. Um, everything does depend in the I think at the end of the days how we approach our work sometimes. Even be and how we feel about it I think and also I think there’s so much more to where we are and what we do than just where we live.. There’s so much more that goes into it.\n\n**** – (): 13:38.37\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Yeah I exact sets That’s that’s true. Absolutely, that’s true.\n\n**** – (): 13:45.24\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): First let’s say for starters, let’s talk about like you know you had these amazing projects with um, you know one of these incredible brands that are today like you know Google Facebook and all of these bands and you were still in Ukraine you were still living in cave. Can you talk about how those happened um. What was your first let’s start with what was your first real project that paid you and you felt like okay now I could do this for a living.\n\n**** – (): 14:08.20\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Huh.\n\n**** – (): 14:12.45\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): So and I need to say that after quitting my ah my job as a copywriter and creative agency I become a full-time illustrator but not the freelance freelance kind of illustrator.\n\n**** – (): 14:20.51\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Copyright. Um.\n\n**** – (): 14:26.92\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): So okay, how did you become time one.\n\n**** – (): 14:29.71\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): So I yeah so I joined my first illustration work illustrator work work as an illustrator I don’t have to say it correctly was in a in a motion design studio and I was illustrating for.\n\n**** – (): 14:41.25\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Insteadedite. Okay, so.\n\n**** – (): 14:49.65\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): See small motion videos exactly so that was my first job and.\n\n**** – (): 14:49.70\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Videos yeah, and at that one what kind of work were you doing like you have a very specific style today at that point did you know what style meant.\n\n**** – (): 15:01.00\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Ah, yeah, at that point now at that point I was doing like when you’re working as ah as an in-house illustrator. You probably be doing more like what they say to you than something yours. But.\n\n**** – (): 15:06.78\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Whatever you will need to.\n\n**** – (): 15:15.18\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yes, absolutely yeah.\n\n**** – (): 15:20.36\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): I Always like from the day one I had these site projects and weekend projects which was my own clients and my freelancing so I was full-time illustrator and freelancing on evenings and weekends. Yeah that that and then I worked.\n\n**** – (): 15:31.69\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Saying both? Yeah yeah.\n\n**** – (): 15:39.30\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Motion design studios at gaming studio and then fintech startup so it was 3 places where I work as as a full time in-house illustrator and simultaneously taking a lot of site projects like ah freelance projects.\n\n**** – (): 15:48.53\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Okay, so.\n\n**** – (): 15:58.41\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): It was tough time. It did some very good things to me and some not so good things to me because it was of course exhausting to have no and no time for anything really.\n\n**** – (): 16:08.33\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): So 2 Yeah, yes, absolutely excuse me.\n\n**** – (): 16:15.81\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): That’s that I I won’t recommend that doing that for it too long because for me, it was like 4 years and it was too long. Yeah, but so I will be.\n\n**** – (): 16:21.14\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah I agree goodness.\n\n**** – (): 16:30.84\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Talking Maybe only about my freelance projects because there that’s where I was growing as an artist because on my in-house position I was earning money mostly that’s it so and making friends. Maybe.\n\n**** – (): 16:35.16\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Okay, okay.\n\n**** – (): 16:44.52\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Um, yeah, ah, that’s that’s the good part.\n\n**** – (): 16:49.81\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Ah, yes, ah yes, that’s a good part because you you you grow your community. Also when you work in-house. Yeah, so I think my first big project was not long after I ah finished I took several courses. About graphic design and then illustration and then lettering and not long after I finish one I have this I had this ah student project and I put it on a hands which is.\n\n**** – (): 17:23.18\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, no anymore. No.\n\n**** – (): 17:24.43\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Portfolio website and at that time it was very useful I’m not sure. It’s the same good now. But that time it was very very great and some and big ukrainian client that it was. This kind of ah fashion and um, cosmetic store and they did a promotion together with visa gold and they came to me and said we like this style can you do it? Can you do the illustrations for us. And it was huge for me, it was like wow and we we did it in my style which was very nice and that was I think my first big project and yeah, that’s it.\n\n**** – (): 18:06.90\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Okay.\n\n**** – (): 18:17.92\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): What about finding your style How someone from someone you know who didn’t come from a um I think they’re always pros and cons to things when you don’t come from art school I Think the good thing is you do not really care about so much Of. Or building a style you just navigating as you’re going moving forward. You have a very specific style where you have these exaggerated um figures you have these ah like you know these? um organic shapes.\n\n**** – (): 18:45.38\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Um, and.\n\n**** – (): 18:50.70\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): E.\n\n**** – (): 18:52.14\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): And I feel like it’s It’s such a modern way of of very similar object like you know nature and then women and I really love how you also mix figures organic shapes with geometry a lot of times and. Can you talk a little bit about how did you find your style per se a lot of artists struggle with this where they do not know how how to go there. How to reach that point where they feel like okay this feels like me this is something I want to do consistently or.\n\n**** – (): 19:29.81\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Um.\n\n**** – (): 19:30.35\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Also I think you’ve also evolved your style not only in digital but you’ve also taken it. You know you do traditional media is also you also do ceres now which is an and let’s talk about that.\n\n**** – (): 19:35.49\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Um, okay so first of all I think you pointed it very very nice that it’s very important to do what feels like you and also so.\n\n**** – (): 19:51.65\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah.\n\n**** – (): 19:54.78\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Like what we say style or visual language I prefer is one. It’s ah very, it’s not static. It’s changing all over the time and it changed through my career too and I think the the way to find it to it’s too.\n\n**** – (): 20:02.26\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, a welling. Yeah okay.\n\n**** – (): 20:13.90\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): To Combine what your what yours? What your stresses Strength is like what you’re good in doing and what you enjoy doing and what process do you enjoy? So for me I Not really I love looking at illustrations that have you know like. Very a lot of small small details and a lot of work but that’s not something I would do because I’m not that kind of person I’m not that patient. Yes, Ah, you need to find something that feels right for you and that you’re good and doing.\n\n**** – (): 20:33.66\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): A j.\n\n**** – (): 20:39.38\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Patient and.\n\n**** – (): 20:47.30\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah.\n\n**** – (): 20:50.97\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): And for me my biggest and inspiration is avantgarde and modern art of twentieth century and bauha and all this like when you go to museum and you go to the twentieth twentieth century and a place to be for me.\n\n**** – (): 20:56.70\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah I sweated. Yeah yeah.\n\n**** – (): 21:09.97\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): So you I think you can see that in my works in colors and shapes and so on and so I think that’s the way that’s a way you you can find your visual language so you need to understand what is feels like you and what is what you want to talk about.\n\n**** – (): 21:15.31\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Um, yeah, yeah.\n\n**** – (): 21:20.50\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): And you know yeah how did you figure what you want to talk about. Can you share that What does your work. So.\n\n**** – (): 21:29.73\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): What you want to communicate like what so I’m still I’m still trying to figure out so I’m only I think I’m only in recent few years ah realized ah topics that i’m. Interested in in a walkingking like mostly it’s about it’s about emotions feelings maybe dreams ah hopes and so on so that is I think it’s driven mostly by some inner things maybe by. Memories and so on and before that you know when you work as a commercial illustrator you often can be drifted away by Briefs and not not yeah and not to think too much what you as an artist want to do so that’s.\n\n**** – (): 22:15.53\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yes, absolutely. Yeah, yeah.\n\n**** – (): 22:25.91\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): I am now more focused on my personal work and I tried to do it as much as possible.\n\n**** – (): 22:33.00\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): And how do you navigate this role of I think you know I’ve also had my own journey when it work with clients in different mediums than having a journey of a very personal. Um, but I feel like. Both have very unique challenges I think working with someone is a whole learning curve where you for a client you have to understand their requirement and you above them. Oh sorry them above you Ah, the good. The hard part I think for working with clients is.\n\n**** – (): 22:51.22\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Here.\n\n**** – (): 23:01.74\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Ah.\n\n**** – (): 23:07.17\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Working with clients. They like the relationship part can be taxing sometimes because um, you know negotiations and but the good part of working with clients is um I think for someone like me I Really enjoy the good part for me as client projects are I.\n\n**** – (): 23:16.32\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Um, yeah.\n\n**** – (): 23:26.57\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Love to take up a challenge. So if they tell me okay, this is you know this is what we’re thinking about it’s like a very designer approach because I’m train as ah, I’m a trained designer I’m not a trained artist like I figured myself out there but my work my how I was trained as a design. Okay, this is a problem like now my creativity finds how I reach from here. To where a client expects and that I really enjoy. But when you’re working for yourself. I think this is the hardest part because now you are your boss nobody has it. You don’t have to change it. You have to do nothing. You can do whatever you want, but. You have to figure out what is that brief that you need today or what is that point that you’re looking for and that I feel is so incredibly so incredibly hard. Oh my god can you share your own experience.\n\n**** – (): 24:13.52\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Heart. Yes, yeah, so I think that that freedom is ah ah it’s is the enemy of creativity. Really, it’s a worst enemy.\n\n**** – (): 24:21.79\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Um, would it. Yeah I Do I do agree I feel like yeah I feel like um I also perform really well when there’s a like ah when you put me in a box like not in that sense of mental box. But tell me like this is something like a few restrictions and then my brain starts to work in such fantastic ways like I feel like oh my God I like I didn’t know I had it in me or like I could think of something like this like it’s like you and father.\n\n**** – (): 24:49.70\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Yeah I Totally I Totally agree and I totally see what you’re talking about because that’s the same for me and I also came from design perspective and what I like in working for brief is this restrictions that make you. Come up with ideas that you didn’t know you have so and that’s amazing and these restrictions put you in a position where you where your brain need to find other ways and these ways make what you do interesting I agree with that and this is happening.\n\n**** – (): 25:06.81\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n**** – (): 25:20.63\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Um, yeah, yeah.\n\n**** – (): 25:25.53\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): So I’m um, especially when I was teaching Arts classes I um looked into how the how brain works and how brain create ideas and that’s just like how brain works if you have total freedom. It will go to this you know.\n\n**** – (): 25:38.58\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, yeah, all over the place.\n\n**** – (): 25:45.14\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Yeah, so like like imagine imagine your brain like a field with a fold with a grass and you have to connect to dots to dots is your neurons actually and if you have a chase if you have bigro on this field.\n\n**** – (): 25:48.47\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, yeah. And.\n\n**** – (): 26:02.63\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Your brain always go this way because that’s ah, that’s ah, energy sufficient way to do it so to create something you you have to put these dots like in a places where they are not intent to be this one this way you.\n\n**** – (): 26:05.30\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, yeah, and.\n\n**** – (): 26:17.15\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Um, yeah.\n\n**** – (): 26:19.59\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): You need to go through the grass and do new road new so you like tiny road to go somewhere else and that’s what brief do to you they say connect these 2 unconnectable things and give us some sketches and you’re like what.\n\n**** – (): 26:34.64\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Um, yeah, why then is yes I agree that to me.\n\n**** – (): 26:37.32\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): And then you start to sink in and connecting this. Yeah so that’s a good thing about working with brief bad thing is that it’s not giving you this freedom to to talk always about what your interest in it and.\n\n**** – (): 26:50.56\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, yeah, shape it in your own way. Take it in a due direction not all clients want that because they of course have another purpose and that may not always like you know intention. Okay.\n\n**** – (): 26:55.79\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Ah.\n\n**** – (): 27:00.63\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Of course and even even if they even if they are very like we we trust you and so on the topic might be not what you’re like not what you’re interested. Yes, like passion right? so.\n\n**** – (): 27:10.73\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, as passionate about.\n\n**** – (): 27:18.50\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): It’s a lot of it can be a lot of creative freedom. But it’s still not your thoughts like not your topic and I think when it comes to your own art. So yeah, it’s kind of for me. It’s also kind of give myself some restrictions and those restrictions can be.\n\n**** – (): 27:21.87\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): And.\n\n**** – (): 27:38.60\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Format or colors or how I can have I want to approach that I’ve tried to I have this I have this ah Credo which is try to make most convincing synque less of the.. How you say it? I don’t know how to say it in English let me sing So it’s with a minimal with a minimal resources to do maximum Impact. So What I mean by minimal resources is.\n\n**** – (): 28:05.54\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n**** – (): 28:15.44\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): To make it like Minimalistic but bold right to to use these shapes why I use these shapes is not because like there’s reason for them because for me shapes are emotional and composition are emotional so you can even without.\n\n**** – (): 28:19.19\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): And.\n\n**** – (): 28:25.54\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, no.\n\n**** – (): 28:34.00\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Putting any specific object on ah on a canvas or on something you can evoke emotions through the shapes and that’s what all the abouthaus and and artists of twentieth century is about so abstract.\n\n**** – (): 28:41.15\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): And absolutely and.\n\n**** – (): 28:51.95\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Unk that they woke emotions and he yeah so ah yeah, I’m feeling like I’m I’m ah I very much it excited but by abstract art but my art is not really abstract. It’s something in between.\n\n**** – (): 28:52.12\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Abstract your work is a very good blend of abstract but figur it of like the figure is there.\n\n**** – (): 29:04.20\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, yeah, yeah, because we it trained in design to me. Also I think I really look at conversations for me.\n\n**** – (): 29:09.62\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Because I really and I think composition is very important part. So yeah, exactly. but but I understand what you’re talking about but ah about about it’s hard to do your own theme. But now I feel. Maybe because of all this experience that I’ve been through for last years in war and all that I have a lot of things in my head that are ready to go out and so I’m not so much struggling about creating ideas anymore.\n\n**** – (): 29:31.45\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, yeah. That you want to get out and. Yeah, yeah.\n\n**** – (): 29:46.60\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Because I already trained my brain pretty good of not going straightforward. So I think all the previous time all the previous briefes was like training and now even when I think about some ideas I want to communicate I want to put on them. On I don’t know on the format on on the canvas I already have this other way of thinking.\n\n**** – (): 30:12.91\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): What do you think? what do you think has been the most most difficult thing for you all these years like being an artist.\n\n**** – (): 30:22.40\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Um, who Wow that’s ah, that’s a that’s a hard question I think I for a long time and even now and even now I’m struggling like many artists with this imposter syndrome when you.\n\n**** – (): 30:37.71\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yes, night.\n\n**** – (): 30:40.47\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Constantly thinking that you’re not good enough and also I got bored very quickly of so I know there is artists who who can do same things for decades and that’s not me I’m.\n\n**** – (): 30:52.64\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): For a long time. Yeah, okay.\n\n**** – (): 30:59.62\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): I got bored very quickly. So I I all always try and to move and for commercial artists. It can be quite challenging too because like.\n\n**** – (): 31:10.13\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, just get the same project. Yeah yeah.\n\n**** – (): 31:14.22\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Clients expect you to do the same thing and your changing change something and then you like here’s something new and they’re okay, we like that’s something old. so yeah so I think these 2 these 2 things are most.\n\n**** – (): 31:19.89\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): And.\n\n**** – (): 31:25.84\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): And mean think I love you? What are you looking forward to in the next like what is what excites you? What is something that you want to work on as an artist as creative.\n\n**** – (): 31:32.77\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Challenge it.\n\n**** – (): 31:39.82\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Ah, um, yeah I would like to go far off with my own own projects on things like being an artist I don’t mind collaborating with brands and so on but I would really. Love to explore more about what’s about me what? Yes, yeah because I think that’s something that many artists want to do because what you’re doing. It’s first of all, it’s you as as I said when you’re trying to find your.\n\n**** – (): 31:58.58\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Well your own ideas here.\n\n**** – (): 32:09.13\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Yeah, yeah.\n\n**** – (): 32:16.88\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Visual language is what you’re about what feels like you and now I feel like I want to explore more what feels like me. Yes.\n\n**** – (): 32:19.20\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): And and I think life experiences Also um, you’ve gone through a major major experience in your life like you know it’s not something that you go through every day and I wish nobody does. But when you like for me I also felt the same way. Anytime I’ve had a major experience. Be it good or bad after my mom’s loss I think I had this. There’s huge resistance and block I had creatively but also so much like you said there’s so much I feel like I want to say and share and I don’t know how that translates but I know that emotionally, there’s so much store in me.\n\n**** – (): 32:49.29\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Um.\n\n**** – (): 32:51.31\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Yes.\n\n**** – (): 32:57.76\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): That I know is looking for a way to come out.\n\n**** – (): 32:58.78\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): Exactly so that’s exactly what I felt like when the war started. Um, oh yeah, it was so I think it was most terrible scary day. Um in my life so we were we were Adam.\n\n**** – (): 33:07.54\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): How was it can you talk a little but I’m a if you um.\n\n**** – (): 33:13.25\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): My.\n\n**** – (): 33:18.66\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): I And like I was quite expecting it I was checking use constantly? yeah and so it wasn’t but it was it still wasn’t you You still can’t prepare yourself for that. So even it’s the next night before I was checking use.\n\n**** – (): 33:22.57\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): Early.\n\n**** – (): 33:38.51\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): And I was seeing this signs that it’s starting this night like for for instant Russia close their ah air air air border with Ukraine. So no no russian civil plane can fly there so it’s like.\n\n**** – (): 33:52.21\n\n**** – (): charukaarora\n\n**** – (): No flights use their signs. Yeah so.\n\n**** – (): 33:57.54\n\n**** – (): Tania\n\n**** – (): This very red flagck.
