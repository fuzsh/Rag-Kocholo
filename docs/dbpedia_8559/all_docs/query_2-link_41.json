        "text": "My intention for this project is to create a final result consisting of photographs that demonstrate a personal interest as well as social engagement with those considered to be outcasts. To begin with, I was attracted to the theme of identity, however, looking deeper, I aim to challenge my own interpretation along with the viewers perception of my chosen subjects. Like Gillian Wearing, I would like to photograph strangers, although wish to focus on people on the street, who we assume have little or no identity in this society. Hearing about the dreadful story of one homeless man who recently passed away not far from Westminster Abbey, captured my attention on the way society as a whole treat impoverished people. (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5402829/Homeless-man-dead-Westminster-child-abuser.html)\n\n20/02/2018\n\nGILLIAN WEARING\n\nWearing (1963) who is an English conceptual artist, is most known for her method of documentation of everyday life through photography and video. Through her technique of representation, she uses these mediums to not only blur the line between reality and fiction but also to break down fundamentals of the public and the private. At first her work appears to be like any other journalistic form of documentation but after close examination and clear understanding, we see that it does not conform to mass-media conventions. At the start of her career, Wearing began to exhibit strangers as the subject of her photographs. An interesting theme demonstrated throughout her work portrays her intention of mocking the idea that artists are anthropologists. Her aim was to challenge the concept of what we thought we already new, instead of trying to discover a foreign culture. Her view of Anthropology is that it ”attempts to compress human activity into scientific objectivity,” so instead of producing objective documentation and creating work where the audience think they know, her approach is by inviting the subject to include their own articulation of thought into the photo.\n\nShe is highly concerned with the significance of the background knowledge of a subject, ‘for me, one of the biggest problems with pure documentary photography is how the photographer, like the artist, engineers something to look like a certain kind of social statement—for instance, you can make someone look miserable, when this is just one side, a nuance of their personality. They might just be looking away at something, but their expression could be read as showing a kind of depression in their overall behaviour. I couldn’t bear the idea of taking photographs of people without knowing’.\n\nSigns that say what you want them to say and not Signs that say what someone else wants you to say (1992-1993)\n\nThe above photographs exhibit a series of portraits of strangers, which include a statement of what they were thinking at the time. This method of photography makes the interaction between Wearing and the subjects more conversational rather than typically restrained like the usual system of portrait photography. It was also her preferred way of working as it eliminated her own perceptions of the subjects. As a collective, they become unified by the act of holding this paper but also represent their own individuality, challenging the audience’s preconceptions of the subject.\n\nThrough working with people on the street, I hope to use a similar technique of photographing with signs. I wish to look into the identity of outcasts and challenge our attitude towards them. It might be interesting to find out about the thoughts and feelings of homeless people, which would consequently change our perception of them. I plan to attract attention from the public by creating signs that give strong but subtle instructions, such as ‘ignore me,’ which reinforces what the public might already do when coming across someone on the street or an outcast in general.\n\nIn exchange for approximately £2, each of the participants were willing to hold a sign which for some did offend them slightly, however, having nothing to lose (including their identity) they happily let me take a photograph of them. My intentions for this were to portray the public’s views and treatment towards people on the street. A lot of guilt and sympathy went through my mind when I spoke to these people as it did make me feel quite sorry to see them in this situation. Other questions that I asked myself were why were they there to begin with and how could they be helped. Furthermore, they didn’t seem to be mind that I had asked them to hold a piece of paper with words that reinforced their label as ‘homeless’ or ‘outcast’.\n\n26/02/2018\n\nTHE POSTHUMAN\n\nThere are at least seven definitions for the term ‘posthuman’ or ‘posthumanism’. These include Antihumanism, Cultural Posthumanism, Political Posthumanism, Posthuman Condition, Transhumanism, Artificial Intelligence Takeover and Voluntary Human Extinction. The Posthuman theory questions what it means to be human while philosophy doubts human subjectivity.\n\nDonna Haraway’s ‘A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century,’ (1985), is an intervention of feminist cultural and political theory. It represents the creature of a cyborg, demonstrating both an animal and machine combined with a human. The point of this manifesto is not to reject nature but instead view it ‘as a partner in the potent conversation’ with which we try to maintain. (https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/feminist-body/)\n\nNatasha Vita-More’s ‘Transhumanist Arts Statement,’ (1982) illustrates the aesthetic and creative culture of transhumanity. The manifesto not only represents its aims to embrace the creative innovations of transhumanity but also its intention to extend life and overcome death. In her statement, Vita-More mentions that as ‘Transhumanist Art comes into focus, as the tools and ideas of our continue to evolve, so too shall we,’ (http://www.transhumanist.biz/transart.htm). She also suggests that Transhumanist artists are ardent activists who pursue infinite transformation and exercise freedoms of self-awareness and self-responsibility.\n\nThe lecture reflected on the relationship between the artist and the animal. ‘Animals, artists and the question of ethics: A dialogue with Steve Baker,’ author of Artist/Animal (University of Minnesota Press, 2012) references that ‘art treats animals as creatures who actively share the more-than-human world with humans, rather than as mere symbols or metaphors for aspects of the so-called human condition.’ Showing that art expresses the significance of nature to animals as well as humans. Baker also proposes that contemporary art makes a vital and distinctive contribution towards the understanding of animal life and that it offers an insight into animal imagery.\n\nDavid Blyth’s ‘Knockturne,’ (2007) is an installation which explores the boundaries between the real world and the spirit world. Explaining that even though we may not control the animal kingdom physically, we certainly try to dominate the spirit world. He concentrates on rites of passage such as birth, death and what lies in-between.\n\n‘During the lambing season of 2006, David Blyth embarked upon a year-long research project and collaboration with local sheep farmer Duncan Connon. […] The tragedies, miracles, cycles and rites of passage that punctuate and define the natural world grew more familiar to David. But how do we relate to this order of nature, and how does it manifest itself in human activities? Is there an ontological, even magical or spiritual link between the animal kingdom’s biological turmoil with human technological development?’ [http://www.deveron-arts.com/david-blyth-knockturne/].\n\nHaving worked closely with animals, taxidermy and the human-animal relationship, ‘David’s empathic consideration for the safe-delivery of new life during the lambing period forced him to review his position as an artist working with still-born carcasses. Idyllic notions of shepherding practices are disrupted by David’s presence on the farm as a collector of the dead lambs – revealing not only the stark reality of the animals’ life-cycle, but the attachment of human emotion and psychological investment,’ (https://www.deveron-projects.com/david-blyth-knockturne/).\n\nStelarc, an Australian performance artist uses his body as the subject of his art. Having visually probes and acoustically amplified his body, two works of his that I find most intriguing include ‘Third Hand,’ (1992) and his suspension performances in the 1970’s and 1980’s. The first involved a mechanical human-like hand that was attached to his right hand and controlled by the electrical signals of his muscles, symbolising a symptom of excess rather than lack of with regards to prosthetic augmentation and replacements. The second consists of a series of suspensions which deal with the psychical difficulties of the body when strung up. Having no intention to appear religious or yogic, his work explores both pleasure and pain. ‘Suspended and in stress the anonymous body realises its obsolescence. The anxiety and the uncertainty that accompanies the feeling of being vulnerable. The nude and silent body at least in its static suspensions is an image of suspended animation. An anaesthetised and pacified body that is obsolete but not yet extinct. That has desires but does not express them. That feels pain but remains silent and stoic. A body that neither thinks nor expresses emotions. The body is exposed as obsolete, empty, absent from its own agency and performing largely involuntarily. A suspended body is a zombie body,’ (http://stelarc.org/?catID=20316).\n\nQuestions to be asked include: What are the consequences of a montage of organic bodies and machines? What are the relations of power between humans and animals/cyborgs in art and life? Is the loss of power in one physical domain the necessary gain of power for another? Does everyone have the right to become any kind of cyborg body?\n\n28/02/2018\n\nCAMDEN ARTS CENTRE: JONATHAN BALDOCK AND GIORGIO GRIFFA\n\nA London-based artist, Jonathan Baldock (1980) uses sculpture, painting, installation and performance. His work often addresses the trauma, stress, sensuality, mortality and spirituality associated with our relationship towards the body. Working in a performative way through his sculptural assemblages, his primary interest is the contrast between the material qualities of ceramic and fabric used within his work as well as creating an act of theatre between the viewer, object and space.\n\nExploring a contemporary kind of ‘primitivism’ with his elaborate yet rather basic technique of using play dough, he looks at different cultures experimenting with all sorts of patterns and accessories. Inspired by classical poses of Greek and Roman sculptures and modelled on white male features then decorated extravagantly, his work uses a style which references cross-cultures and gender. Desexualising each piece, Baldock explains that ‘it’s not only beauty, it’s about playing with perceptions of materiality.’ Developing his sculptures through their material manipulation, Baldock accentuates the humble making process by placing them on a chipboard plinth.(http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/jonathan_baldock.htm)\n\nANDROMEDA 2007, (Salt dough, pins, ribbon, dolls eyes, polystyrene, colouring, paint, synthetic hair)\n\nADRIANA 2007\n\nANDROGNY (BEARDED) 2007\n\nGiorgio Griffa (1936) an Italian Abstract Painter who uses acrylic on raw un-stretched canvas, burlap and linen. When his work is not exhibited, they are folded and stacked, resulting in underlying grids for his compositions. He works this way because the material has its ”own history and in this history they have been put in storage and the normal storage of fabrics is to fold, and so –. The work lives its own life. The work lives.”\n\nHaving been associated with Arte Povera and Minimalism, his theory behind painting is that it is constant and never finished. For Griffa, art is a process of forgetting himself. Each painting begins with a single mark “and then the second sign and the third sign and every other sign are the ones requested by the first sign.” Although there is an apparent simplicity, there is also a sufficient deep thinking involved, he explains that the problem is finding a proper attitude of finding a “passive concentration, to understand what the work is asking of me.” Griffa’s primary aim has always been to take lifeless materials in order to form a living artwork.\n\nAs an artist being able to speak with the materials, the most important aspect to him is the three-way conversation between the artist, the material and the spectator. It also about what the public give back to the work as “that is where the life of art works comes from, the possibility to continue to live after their time.”\n\nOBLIQUO 1979 (Acrylic on canvas)\n\nWith his work usually consisting of a series of lines or small dabs on a large unstretched canvas, Griffa symbolises a continuation beyond the canvas. By allowing these lines to flow over the edge of the material or by halting the point of the marks at such an nconsistent midway point, the viewer is able to imagine the infinite end.\n\nThemes demonstrated throughout his work include rhythm and memory. He reveals that, “there is a lot of music in my work,” also that ”the colour becomes dry and when it becomes dry, it works together with the fabric, with the paper, and with the memory – 30,000 years of memory of humanity is in that, here.” (http://thequietus.com/articles/23943-giorgio-griffa-interview)\n\n2014 (Acrylic on linen) POLICROMO 1976\n\nThrough looking into the work of Baldock and Griffa, I hope to incorporate similar minimalist and primitive materials and techniques into my project. For instance, like Griffa I could experiment with line and pattern using different painting methods. Mark making over photographs might be interesting as I could explore colour over the black and white photographs of the homeless people. Baldock also explores pattern through his exorbitant ornamentation. Again choosing to pattern over the photographs perhaps with play dough or paint in a similar way to Baldock could be intriguing.\n\n28/02/2018\n\nKATE BRIGHT\n\nA British Contemporary artist who’s work consists of painting, sculpture and drawing, explores the opticality of water combining both the realist and idealist approach. Using glitter, resin, glass and polystyrene on the surfaces of paintings, she is able to effectively study the fascinating light refractions in pools, fountains, ponds and snow. Expanding the possibilities for contemporary realism in producing compositions which play with abstraction and the artificiality of painting creates an illusory experience for the viewer which is also heightened by her visually unpredictable materials.\n\nI admire her colourful paintings which incorporate a range of patterns and shapes. I would like to experiment with paint in a similar way perhaps for future projects, however for this project which involves photography, I could explore light by using mirrors and glass. Perhaps when it comes to the development process I could give the impression of reflection and experiment with the light exposure with the black and white photographs of the homeless people. I could paint over the photographs to create patterns?\n\nCLARENCE GATE 2004 (Acrylic and resin on canvas)\n\nMAGUK FALLS 2004\n\nAUTUMN BLUE 2004\n\nHOMELESS COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHS\n\nTaking inspiration from Kirchner’s abstract colour scheme, I enjoyed using a simplistic yet colourful style. To improve, I believe I could have experimented more with the line drawing technique and perhaps just use pen and focus on one or two colours per drawing?\n\nDeveloping on from my six sketches I decided to experiment further with style and composition. I found Jean-Michel Basquiat’s work quite interesting and really admire his way of communicating unusual ideas/stories in a rather childish manner. Appreciating the graffiti appearance, I think I could have let loose a little more, adding detail regarding ideas and attitudes towards the theme of ‘outcast’.\n\n05/03/2018\n\nART AND CONTROVERSY\n\nThe outline of this lecture involved the theme of censoring which questioned the relationship between representation and reality. David Cronenberg, a Canadian director mentions, ‘censors tend to do what only psychotics do: they confuse reality with illusion,’ showing that if we were restricted from seeing everything, we would not have a sense of reality as we would not know the whole truth. Censors include organisations such as the British Board of Film Classification, Art Institutions and their representatives: galleries and their curators, and Stake Holders like pressure groups, funders and art audiences. International organisations such as ‘Index on Censorship’ promote and defend the right to freedom of expression. They challenge censorship around the world fighting for free speech everywhere. Index supports Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states: ‘Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression.’\n\nSouth African artist Brett Bailey (b.1967) and his performance/installation piece ‘Exhibit B’ is a highly controversial work of art due to its references to racism, ‘othering’ and the colonial history of Europe. It reflects the time during the late 19th and early 20th centuries when Europe’s superpowers scrambled for the rich resources of Africa and the pseudo-scientific racial theories were formulated, causing horrific consequences which are still evident today. Having previously been shown at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in front of approximately 25,000 people as well as internationally, it caused great debate. The exhibition was scheduled to open at the Barbican in September 2014 however a petition with over 20,000 signatures and a campaign against it organised by the activist and journalist, Sara Myers led to its cancellation. Unfortunately the gallery could not guarantee the safety of the performers, gallery staff and the audience.\n\nBailey expresses that ‘the listed components of each installation includes spectators – it is only complete with an audience. The installation is not about the cultural or anatomical difference between the colonial subject and the spectator; it is about the relationship between the two. It is about looking and being looked at. Both performer and spectator are contained within the frame.’ (http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/24/exhibit-b-challenging-work-never-sought-alienate-offend-brett-bailey)\n\nAs director of the ‘Third World Bun Fight Performance Company’ Baileys intentions are to bring attention towards situations, issues and stories which are all too often overlooked. Their ethos as a company is to activate people through art and performance, energise depressed situations, integrate the marginalised and transform and heal. Focusing on the post-colonial situation in Africa along with the historical and contemporary relations between Africa and the West, the company are able to expose the conspirators of power that suppress so many people. Bailey believes that the main objective for the piece is to highlight current racism and xenophobic policies in the EU and how they have evolved from racist attitudes of the late 19th century. His aim was to call attention to how these dehumanising stereotypes of otherness were instilled in the consciousness of our ancestors and transmitted as well as shaped over time. Exhibit B questions these representations.\n\nOthers who have opposed the work include Simon Woolley, coordinator of Operation Black Vote and a former Equalities and Human Rights Commissioner mentioned that the Barbican had been forewarned about the public’s attitude towards ‘Exhibit B’. “This was a vanity project. Having people objectified in this humiliating way was always going to cause a fierce reaction. It is a shame that it reached this stage but the feeling was that no one was listening.” (http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/sep/24/barbican-criticise-protesters-who-forced-exhibit-b-cancellation)\n\nSociologist and activist Kehinde Andrews strongly believes that ‘Exhibit B’ is racist, simply because it turns the black body into an object. He mentions that ‘the arts do not have the right to racially offend and black artists do not have the authority to define what is and is not acceptable.’ (http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/27/is-art-installation-exhibit-b-racist)\n\nAndrews reveals that although Bailey’s goal was to ”provoke audiences to reflect on the historical roots of today’s prejudices and policies,” this exhibition reproduces the idea that black people are passive agents to be used as conduits for white people to speak to each other.’ (http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/12/exhibit-b-human-zoo-boycott-exhibition-racial-abuse). As the creator assumed a white audience, I don’t think that objectifying the African race was fair. Like Andrews, I believe that Bailey’s intentions were legitimate however the crudeness of his performative ideas were far too offensive towards the African culture.\n\nOverall, I feel that art should not be censored as although at times brutal and unrefined, it is important that the public are exposed to a wide range of opinions and ideas towards a variety of issues in order for them to not only be reminded of the past but to also reflect upon the present.\n\n13/03/2018\n\nART ATRIUM-EXHIBITION OF WORK\n\nShowcasing my lively and vibrantly coloured sketches of Terri-‘Art Must Be Beautiful,’ allowed me to reflect upon my next step for this project. The title is a reference from Marina Abramovic’s energetic and fiery performance piece of her emphasising the female act of brushing her hair. Representing her expressing the ‘ugly’ side of art, she intended to make her art disturbing. Her voice and expression betray pain while others view the work as a reflection of her own self-image and beauty. I felt that there was a similar energy used in my drawings which also focus on the feature of hair and perhaps beauty.\n\n‘Art Must Be Beautiful, Art Must Be Beautiful,’ (1975)\n\nI hope to continue drawing in this style, however would like to concentrate on communicating the concept of the outcast. I shall do this by developing my drawings of the men on the street and experimenting with text transcribed from conversations that I have had with them. Additionally, I wish to incorporate that similar energy seen in the drawings of Terri as this adds life to the work. I intend to use less colour and perhaps stick to one or two colours per drawing in order to illustrate particular emotions and experiment with colour representations. For example, dark blue represents integrity and seriousness while dark purple evokes gloom and sad feelings. By using certain colours, I think it would be interesting to experiment with making the audience feel a specific way.\n\nBOB AND ROBERTA SMITH\n\nPatrick Brill (b.1963) who goes by the name of Bob and Roberta Smith is a British contemporary artist, musician and writer. Famous for his slogan art which are painted in a brightly coloured lettering style on pieces of wood and banners, Brill exhibits his work worldwide. As a campaign activist, the slogans are usually humorous and focus on politics, art and popular culture.\n\nAs a speaker, writer and advocate, he is keen to merge art and politics, which has been illustrated in the 2006 exhibition ‘Peace Camp’. Curating the show at the Brick Lane Gallery, he collaborated with over 100 artists exploring their perceptions on peace. In 2013, he created a project named ‘The Arty Party’ to make contemporary art more accessible and demonstrate its ability to ‘influence meaningful conversation and political thought.’ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_and_Roberta_Smith)\n\nThese compositions, backgrounds, colours and font are elements that I would like to incorporate into my own small typography experiments. I would like to record the conversations/stories of the homeless people I spoke to in order to develop a deeper understanding of why they are seen as outcasts and how it has impacted both their and our perception of what an outcast is.\n\nThinking about the conversations I had had with some of the homeless people I came across along with questions/opinions taken from articles and blogs, I decided to express words and thoughts through the form of typography. Concentrating on format as well as colour meant layering different types of card and using shape/composition to create interesting experiments.\n\nFINAL PROJECT\n\nAfter reviewing artists that I have researched throughout the course, I found Maurizio Anzeri to be the most intriguing. I really enjoy his exploration of identity, which is something that I too wanted to explore. Using a similar technique of going over photographs instead of stitching thread, I chose to dab acrylic spots over the images of the homeless people who I had taken photographs of. Considering this idea of identity, or in their cases lack of identity, I wanted to merge the images to the point where they had no identity. Shedding light on this notion that homeless people have no identity and reflecting society’s attitudes towards them. I chose to use bright colours as this has been a recurring theme throughout the course. The spots, I thought could add textural interest.\n\nMaurizio Anzeri- ‘Giorgio’\n\n15/01/2018\n\nART & SOCIAL PRACTICE\n\nLooking into the theme of Art Activism, several names emerged including Mierle Ukeles, who produced performative art in the 70’s/80’s (‘Touch Sanitation’ 1979-1980) and Grant Kester, a social art critic. There are many ways to describe art and social practice, for example, human interation between the artist and the public, social discourse and a relationship between a community and art. The difference between a work of art and social practice involving art is that there is a process, collaboration and engagement from the public.\n\nAn artist involved in social practice actively seeks to make work with others in order to provide construction of meaning and value. It fosters dialogue among a community and brings about commoning (equality) and change. Politics and Art can sometimes come hand in hand, for example, groups such as Occupy, a socio-political movement who protest against social and economic inequality and the English Disco Lovers, who campaign for social change. Tania Bruguera is also someone who uses art to influence and encourage a community to engage with art.\n\n‘Art is what makes life more interesting than Art,’ Robert Filliou,1970. My understanding of this statement is that if art should be more lifelike, life should be more art-like, therefore Art must change life whilst life changes Art.\n\n18/01/2018\n\nWorked in the studio taking photographic portraits using the close-up technique so that we would have more to work on when it came to editing and printing out photographs. Experimented with lighting by using the flash and waving a white sheet behind the sitter.\n\n22/01/2018\n\nSIGNS AND CODES\n\nLearning about the way in which language can be used to represent meaning was very interesting as often the meaning of a word/phrase cannot be portrayed as well as an image or work of art which requires usually no text at all. Rhetoric for instance, the art of public speaking or writing is a key example suggesting that language can be highly metaphorical and have no fixed meaning. The French philosopher, Jacques Derrida implies that reality and representation are a false binary, ‘there is no outside text’. Demonstrating that ‘once we enter language, we loose the ability to express what we want’.\n\nSemiology, the science of signs, questions our ability to interpret signs and their official meanings. This can relate to areas such as advertisement or even something as technological as a traffic light. Consumer goods associated with historical significance, like Burberry’s checkered pattern or Dr Martens boots are a form of artistic signage.\n\nAdvertisement, an example of rhetoric as discourse without an agenda is also another form of language through art. As visual art, it encourages the public to buy a certain product, consequently the language used is often exaggerated, ”does exactly what it says on the tin’. This technique influences the audience in such a way that they don’t really know what they are buying until they have bought the item. Understanding that advertisements are made to make us think in a materialistic way reminded me that the symbolism of advertising allows for a certain feeling towards a product, whether it be nostalgic or a sense of national identity, it is a form of art.\n\n26/01/2018\n\nSpent the afternoon in the darkroom experimenting with light exposure. Printed photographs in a variety of styles using the darkroom process (lengthy but addictive). Thought about how I could develop the photographs in sketchbook. Will look into artists like Maurizio Anzeri and Ernst Kirchner.\n\nTook some colour photos and printed them off. Thought about how I could progress from them. Inspired by Ernst Kirchner, I drew from a few of them using oil pastels and pen.\n\n29/01/2018\n\nART AS EXPERIENCE\n\nFrom my understanding of todays lecture, art is an individual experience, closely linked to culture, politics and everyday life. John Dewey, an American philosopher, questions the existence of individuality which is most often expressed through art, ‘part of how we are successful as individuals comes from interacting, working with, and even disagreeing with others’ (1934). He also believed that art is a way of expressing emotion, more easily than words, ‘instead of a description of an emotion in intellectual and symbolic terms, the artist ‘does the deed that breeds’ the emotion,’ http://hyperallergic.com/67081/reconsidering-john-deweys-art-as-experience/.\n\nModernism a form of abstract art, dramatises the relationship between the viewer and object. This can be referred to as the corrupted Modernist sensibility of minimalism seen in the work of Donald Judd and Robert Morris. While the experience of authentic Modernist art focuses on objecthood and the sense of duration. Expressing emotion through space/pictoral symbols is often more powerful than words/paintings, ‘actual space is intrinsically more powerful and specific than paint on a flat surface,” Donald Judd. Focusing on objecthood, artists are able to express their intentions with a simplicity that is not only quite theatrical but also engages the audience in an entirely new way.\n\nArtists such as Mieke Bal, ‘Sticky Images,’ (1967) which questions the act of looking at an artwork, and Daniel Spoerri, ‘Repas Hongrois, tableau-piège,’ (Hungarian Meal, Trap-Picture,1963), which questions art using food, are interesting as they highlight the issue surrounding what art is or could be.\n\nArt as a social subject can mean that the artist becomes a ‘context provider’ rather than a ‘content provider,’ in the words of the British artist Peter Dunn. Illustrating that the art created by the artist in collaboration with an audience is perhaps more significant than an artwork that ends up on a wall. Installation/performance pieces where the audience becomes the artwork allows for an equal footing between the artist and the viewer. In order for social art to exist it requires an audience. An example of social art includes Suzanne Lacy’s per-formative piece, ‘The Roof is on Fire,’ (1994) where 220 teenagers had informal conversations regarding family, sexuality, drugs and culture on a rooftop in several cars, with over 1000 Oakland residents listening in. This work highlighted the social issues surrounding the youth in Oakland, California. The artist therefore can provide a platform between different groups of society.\n\n30/01/2018\n\nExperimented with the enlargement process in the darkroom by expanding the negatives. Time consuming but worthwhile as I managed to not only experiment with the composition of my negatives but also produced interesting effects by experimenting with the light exposure and the contrast lens. I would like to perhaps take some more photos using a camera with film of a subject portraying the theme of identity or possibly loss of identity. Awareness of the issue of mental health has increased therefore it might be interesting to demonstrate this through paintings/photographic portraits of homeless people or other groups of society who are discriminated against.\n\n31/01/2018\n\nTATE MODERN\n\nAttending the ‘Hyundai Commission: One Two Three Swing!’ exhibition was an enjoyable experience as it was very interactive and highly amusing. Not only did it engage the public but it also brought everyone together. As a theatrical piece, it questioned my view on art as I believe the only reason it could be classified as art is because it was placed in a gallery. The idea behind the work is that if everyone swings together, ‘perhaps we could change the way the Earth spins,’ a metaphor illustrating that if everyone worked together, changes throughout the world could be made.\n\nThe first painting above, ‘Reborn Sounds of Childhood Dreams I’ (1961-65) by Sudanese artist Ibrahim El-Salahi, displays influences of Arabic and African forms and iconography. Its simple forms, strong lines and sombre colours depict ideas of memory and dreams, past and present becoming one. The black and white tones and almost pattern-like figures reminded me of Mexican Art.\n\nThe second two photos of the five sculptures, I found to be quite imaginative as you can’t tell if they’re animals or figures. It looks like a series of characters, interestingly shaped and coloured. For future projects, I would like to do a series of sculpture pieces. The third photograph, ‘Cathedral,’ (1950) painted by African-American artist Norman Lewis, demonstrates influences of the dense urban landscape in Harlem along with Abstract Expressionism. It reminds me of a similar technique used by Vieira Da Silva which involves cross-hatching.\n\nThe last four include a painting done by René Magritte, ‘Man with a newspaper,’ (1928) from which I would like to imitate the compositional style as she has painted the same scene but at different times, William Eggleston’s 4 photographs, ‘Untitled,’ (1970-6) which exhibit his aim to make ordinary subjects extraordinary. The black and white painting with the cross-like shape in the middle, ‘Possession Island (Abstraction),’ (1991) by Gordon Bennett employs a slightly pointillist style of painting as it is covered in white spots. The vivid black outlines and white spots together create strong contrast. There is also some political context demonstrated by the red, yellow and black which are the colours of the Aboriginal flag. Bennett’s intentions were to make people think more about Australia’s colonial history. The last image, a photograph taken by Lorna Simpson, ‘Then and Now,’ (2016) not only uses an interesting layout but also presents a time when violence between the American police and African-American citizens dominated the headlines. She has layered two found photographs taken during the race riots in Detroit July 1967 and worked on the surface by hand. Simpson’s painting/photographs connect that time to present day.\n\n31/01/2018\n\nDINU LI\n\nA contemporary artist based in Falmouth, England, who explores photography, film and video. Focusing on the relationship between the personal and the political as well as the public and the private, his work documents oral histories, chance observations, facts and snippets of imagination. Inspired by the many cultures that he comes across, Dinu raises debates concerning our social structures. Following cinematic traditions and exploring the concepts of time and space, he is able to manipulate motion and sound by making it prolonged, reduced or distilled. Drawing the viewer’s attention to the captured moments of time, Li represents a strong sense of elusiveness as well as fantasy.\n\n‘Secret Shadows’ 2002-\n\nSecret Shadows – Review\n\n‘By focusing on tiny details concerning the subject’s life the mirror and tweezers on the bed, the slippers and porcelain shoe holding the money – the objects start to characterise every hour of their lives. Karaoke and the map of China provide us with a location and hints that we are looking at an Asian person. The images become portraits of people whom we cannot see. It’s only through the spaces in which they exist and the objects which they possess, that we can start building a picture of them. We will never know their real identity; this work plays on the idea of anonymity. Dinu Li is presenting codes and symbols, allowing the imagination to explore a theme.’ (http://dinuli.com/secret_shadows/index.html)\n\nFrom looking at his work, I hope to explore similar themes of identity and anonymity through photography. I wish to look into the theme of outcast/identity and will do this by focusing on those living rough. Perhaps I could build up some identity of the ‘outcast’ by using their words transcribed from conversations to create pieces of art. I could write the words on to the photographic portraits of them? I could recreate their living environment or photograph their belongings not only leaving the audience to think about who they belong to but also to give them an insight into the reality of their lifestyles.\n\n08/02/2018\n\nContinued experimenting with the negatives taken in the first session which displays myself as the subject. Explored composition and effects by changing the contrast and making the negatives dirty by smudging and rubbing them on the floor. A less professional appearance has given my prints an appealing vintage look, portraying various emotions of my face. Playing around with the focus and overlapping the negatives was a very interesting technique as not only did it create an unusual ghostly impression but it also demonstrates an exploration of the light gradient.\n\nI intend to carry on producing prints from my negatives as I find black and white to be the most effective, however would like to create a series of smaller compositions as I did not experiment enough with the focus. After, I wish to do the same again but perhaps with another subject that illustrates the theme of ‘loss of identity’ or ‘outcasts’.\n\nOne artist who I have looked into includes Australian artist Tracey Moffatt (1960) who uses photography and video. She uses a lot of movement and drama in her photographs but I particularly like the techniques used in one of her black and white series such as layering and contrast. Her work often focuses on the way the social and cultural terms of the Australian Aboriginal people are understood.\n\n‘LAUDANUM’ (1998) A series of photogravures\n\nIn this photographic series, Moffatt uses old colonial homes as the setting for her melodramatic scenes, emphasising themes of fear and desire. Other themes portrayed include sexuality, race, history and representation. Her love for film is evident as this work for example references Murnau’s Expressionist film ‘Nosferatu’ (1922). The eerie tones and ambiguous dreamlike scenarios are elements that I would like to incorporate into my photographic prints.\n\n‘GUAPA (Good Looking)’ (1995) Black and White Photographs on Chromogenic Paper\n\nA series of 10 images which express Moffatt’s concerns in that she operates as a director and picture maker, rather than a picture taker. Presenting the influence of popular culture, this piece illustrates the American Roller Derby which was televised around the world some decades ago. Hiring local female models to pose in the studio to recreate the scene, her intentions were to represent the violence and theatre inherent in sport. Ideas like beauty and heroism are portrayed and strengthened by the fact that they are black and white negatives which have been printed on to colour photographic paper. A dreamlike quality is added through the bleached backgrounds and magenta tints.\n\n12/02/2018\n\nTHINGS AND THINGLINESS\n\nThe main objective of this lecture was to get us thinking about the way in which artists explore the significance of everyday objects. For example, Van Gogh’s ‘A Pair of Shoes,’ (1886) clearly portrays an object that we use on a day to day basis. The work allows us to reflect upon ourselves, metaphorically standing before the world as they are a pair of old isolated muddy boots. It helps us to understand that we are the ones drawing up our own rules of interpretation as although we see a pair of shoes, we are really just looking at another object, that being the painting. It is essentially a hypothetical object within an object. By painting the shoes, he highlights the primary purpose of the act of art, which I believe is to record our surroundings. You could say that this painting is ‘an encounter with the essence of art’ (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger-aesthetics/#Bib).\n\nAnother example of insignificant materials made significant by the artist is ‘The Way Things Go,’ (1987) by Fischli and Weiss. This 30 minute video comprises of a successfully and well-orchestrated sequence of events. Elements such as fire, water, chemistry and the law of gravity all determine the continuity of the cycle. Objects used include household items, tyres, buckets, bin bags and balloons all representing ideas concerning cause and effect, improbability, mechanism in art and precision. Through ‘forensic attention to detail,’ ‘slapstick humour and profound insight,’ ‘viewers find themselves witnessing a spectacle that seems at once pre-historic and post-apocalyptic,’ (https://www.afterall.org/books/one.work/fischli.and.weiss.way.things.go). It enables for the viewer to socially engage with objects in a visual form, reminding them of the transformation of the purpose of the everyday objects.\n\nI admire artists like Pil and Galia Kollectiv who use objects differently in order to emphasise their independence from humans as it forces us to think about perhaps the materialistic/non-material worlds and possibly our existence. The focus on objects invites us to rethink our relationship with the world of objects/nature. It also underlines the historical developments made by mankind as well as the impact that objects have had on us. Artists like Trisha Baga, ‘Plymouth Rock 2’ (2012) (a contested symbol of (white settler) American identity) which is a two-channel projection compiled from a variety of found and original video and audio material, can communicate key issues regarding political history and possibly the unity of the country today through portraying the significance of this rock. Plymouth rock was the traditional site of the disembarkation of the Mayflower Pilgrims, who fleeing religious persecution from England in 1620, founded the Plymouth Colony in North America.\n\n14/02/2018\n\nJESSIE BRENNAN\n\nA British, London-based artist, Brennan explores the inter-relations between people and place through the mediums of photography, drawing, film, performance and installation. ‘Everything Meets Here,’ (2012) a large-scale pencil drawing of an imaginary landscape gathered from personal resources, was conceived for a project commissioned by Art on the Underground. The production of the work came about through participating with groups like photography students from City of Westminster College, London Underground staff and the St. Marylebone Society. Her aim for this project was to create opportunities for the groups to reflect upon elements such as colour, pattern and social history. They carried this out by drawing from found and personal objects.\n\nBrennan’s practice is a combination of drawing and participation, acknowledging the social history of places and involving the direct engagement of those who occupy these spaces. She uses drawing as a means of conceptualising the exchange of personal experiences, memories and myths between herself and the people within a particular place or context. Like Brennan, it might be interesting to explore scale and imagination. Using the medium of photography, I could consider various ways of composition and scale, perhaps with the subject of homeless people, presenting the identity and significance of outcasts.\n\n14/02/2018\n\nLISA MILROY\n\nMilroy (1959) is well known for her still life paintings of everyday objects such as shoes, clothes and vases. They are often placed in lines and patterns, portraying various abstract compositions. Other work includes landscapes, buildings, portraits and geisha’s in conflicting settings. Her paintings often explore positive and negative space as well as the format of columns, grids, rows and groups. Milroy’s early paintings of the 1980’s which feature still life most commonly depict ordinary objects against an off-white background. As her approach towards still life branched out, so too did her style of painting allowing for a more performative component. Her more recent work demonstrates her exploration of painting through installation and performance. The connection between stillness and movement along with the nature of making and looking at painting have fascinated Milroy throughout her career.\n\nViewing the ‘Here and There: Paintings by Lisa Milroy,’ exhibition at the Parasol Unit Foundation for Contemporary Art gave me a brief insight into her approach to still life through the forms of making, looking, touching and transforming. The ground floor concentrates on the concept of ‘Here,’ addressing materiality and bodily-presence through three-dimensional object paintings, pattern and colour. Paintings such as Garment (2017) and Detached (2012) present items of clothing in various arrangements while the installation painting Party of One (2013) includes a performative component. On the first floor of the gallery, the exhibition focuses on ‘There,’ presenting a selection of works which portray themes of presence, absence, loss, time and memory.\n\nFrom looking at Milroy’s work, I hope to incorporate a similar compositional style into my photography project. I could try collaging the photographs of the homeless people that I have taken so as to present the sense of disorder and discomfort that they experience in their lives.\n\nJORGE PARDO\n\nCuban artist Pardo (1963) explores elements of contemporary painting, design, sculpture and architecture. Ranging from murals to home furnishings and collages, his work employs intrinsic patterns and vibrant colours. Using natural and industrial materials, Pardo is able to transform familiar objects into artworks that possess numerous meanings and purposes. For example, a series of lampshades that perform as illuminating and freestanding sculptures or a sailboat exhibited as a functional yet monumental vessel. Experimenting between large and small scale works, Pardo also treats public spaces as extensive canvases. His work not only engages viewers with its great visual beauty but it also questions the distinctions between fine art and design.\n\n19/02/2018\n\nMoDA LECTURE (MUSEUM OF DOMESTIC DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE)\n\nAn accessible research collection welcome to students which preserves important items relating to British domestic design and architecture 1870-1960. Its aims are to inspire creativity among its audiences and co-create knowledge and understanding of the collection. The museum supports and challenges audiences to learn from the collection, to demonstrate their learning and to feed that knowledge back into a shared knowledge base.\n\nThe project ‘I Am A Magazine,’ (2017) was a series of installation pieces produced by over a hundred Middlesex students and staff. Each group of students was given a box of magazines and asked to use them as the starting point for creative exploration of their collaborative project. Both Middlesex and MoDA have more than 450 magazine titles stored safely in their archive. MoDA’s intention for this activity was to not only draw students’ attention but also encourage them to critically analyse these important resources. The energy and ambition that students portrayed throughout the week illustrated a successful example of an interdisciplinary and self-directed nature of the project.\n\nI wanted to explore various landscapes using the medium of drawing and photography, with my most preferred artists of interest being Kirchner and Sammy Slabbink. From them, I wanted to experiment with colour and collage. My primary focus is to look into landscapes/scenes that I am familiar with. For example, regular spots and historical buildings in the area. Additionally, I find art more interesting when there are people involved, therefore I would like to draw scenes of memory, possibly personal photographs displaying loved ones.\n\n20/11/2017\n\nTHE SPACE OF ART (WHITE CUBE)\n\nHistory displays numerous ways in which art has been represented, be it through the historic Greek vases or the ancient hand prints of the Patagonian’s in Argentina known as Cueva de las Manos from 11,000 to 7,500 BCE. The creation of the White Cube Gallery has dominated Modernism functioning not only as a gallery but also a tomb, a shop, a treasury and a church where the ceiling becomes a prominent light source. Brian O’Doherty, an Irish art critic, argues that the white walls of galleries have defined the meaning of modern art as much as the artworks themselves in his series of essays (1976-1981) ‘Inside the White Cube: The Ideology of the Gallery Space’. Howard N. Fox an artist mentions, that ‘the gallery space, sequestering the spectator within an apparently timeless realm and before the presence of the enshrined object, insidiously governs the viewer’s consciousness, perception, and emotional response.’ Different compositional trends in paintings and new technologies led to the creation of the White Cube Gallery as the concept of how we could experience art in more depth arose. Furthermore, the White Cube is a model for analysing the ideology of space. (http://howardfox.com/)\n\n‘We have now reached a point where we see not the art but the space first. An image comes to mind of a white, ideal space that, more than any single picture, may be the archetypal image of 20th-century art. And it clarifies itself through a process of historical inevitability usually attached to the art it contains.’ (p. 14) Our perception of how we experience art has changed over time. The modernist approach towards space enables us to understand artists work on another level as we begin to see the space before the art enhancing the artwork and creating an atmosphere.(https://www.moma.org/explore/conservation/monet/unveiling_monet.html)\n\nIn the White Cube Gallery, a unique chamber of aesthetics produces an experimental laboratory enabling the notion of modern academicism, the concept that ideas are more interesting than art. ‘Things become art in a space where powerful ideas about art focus on them,’ showing that through viewing a piece of art, ideas for discussion are manifested. One of the great projective laws of modernism is that ‘as modernism gets older, context becomes content’. (http://thebesttimeoftheday.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/karla-black.html)\n\nSol LeWitt (1928-2007), an American involved in Conceptual art and Minimalism, reflects the concept of how space can change art or how art can be utilised in a particular space. His Drawing Series, ‘Composite, Part I-IV’ consists of contrived and neutral three-dimensional structures presented on white immaculate walls, one after the other. His exploration of wall-based works engages not only with their surrounds but also the light, emphasising its contours.\n\nArt does not always have to be presented in a gallery, for instance Robert Smithson’s enormous piece of land art, ‘Spiral Jetty’ (1970) which is located on the great salt lake in Utah, questions what art is and how we might be able to experience or view it. Using a coil that is 1500 feet long and 15 feet wide as well as black basalt rocks, it stretches out clockwise into the clear red water. He is interested in how the forces of nature can change the work at any given time as the sea level fluctuates. Just as space can change an artwork, Smithson’s work reflects on how the natural surroundings can take affect.\n\nElmgreen and Dragset portray the idea of the White Cube in their piece, ‘Dug Down Gallery/Powerless Structures,’ (1998). Its focus is on the role that art galleries have played in reshaping and altering the urban landscape. The work also highlights the issue of gentrification in places such as the East End of London, Mitte in Berlin and Chelsea in New York. Choosing to place an imitative gallery space among a playing field again calls attention to how galleries have shaped our surroundings. Additionally, challenging the site of contemporary art, they ‘transfer space to new contexts of description, purposefully modifying its functionality, and, therefore, facilitating the re-definition of the familiar.’\n\nSimon Sheikh, the National Director of the Australian political organisation ‘GetUp!’ mentions that reflecting and restaging a space in order to present an art work has become a continuous debate as most galleries and museums still employ the white cube as the preferred method of exhibiting work. It is important to note that overcoming the white cube does not necessarily mean exiting it. I believe that the white cube model can be challenged through the act of placing art outside of the gallery. This questions the definition of art as it creates controversy over what can be classified as art if it has not been placed in a gallery.\n\nLooking into the different types of locations where art can be presented, the walls of a skate park might be interesting to exhibit art work as a variety of people would be able to view it.\n\nAdmiring the carefully thought out compositions of Sammy Slabbincks work and the unusual layering of Man Ray’s photographs and collages, I aimed to experiment with photographs/images of landscapes in a similar way.\n\n27/11/2017\n\n‘THE PLACE OF ART’ : ART, WALKING AND THE CITY-STREET AS LOCATION\n\nSome contemporary art practices focus on walking, for example, Francis Alÿs and his ‘Paradox of Praxis 1 (Something Making Something Leads to Nothing) Mexico City, 1997 (Video, 4:57min) uses walking as a way of exploring the nature of the modern city. ‘For more than nine hours, Alÿs pushed a block of ice through the streets of Mexico City until it completely melted. And so for hour after hour he struggled with the quintessentially Minimal rectangular block until finally it was reduced to no more than an ice cube suitable for a whisky on the rocks, so small that he could casually kick it along the street.’ Through investigating the concept of making something temporary, Alÿs represents a familiar activity through a process that highlights a beginning and an end. Using walking to speed up the process of the ice block melting is interesting as it shows how Alÿs has altered the meaning of walking, yet he has also called attention to the simple idea of travelling from point A to point B. In addition, deciding to push this object through a busy city changes the way in which we think about walking as we reflect upon the fact that every walk we make has a destination or purpose. (http://francisalys.com/sometimes-making-something-leads-to-nothing/)\n\nAnother example of art and walking is William Pope.L’s ‘The Great White Way: 22 Miles, 5 Years, 1 Street (2002-2007). Mostly a performance artist, Pope.L challenges hierarchy and references attitudes towards culture. By crawling in public and dressed as Superman, he degrades the superiority of the Superhero figure and highlights perhaps the treatment of the African-American race. He mentions that ‘crawling is not an act of\n\nhumiliation. It is an act of struggle,’ showing that his intentions were to make the audience think about the historical context as well as present day opinions towards the African-American race. Furthermore, Pope.L raises the question, what is art if it has not been performed or displayed in an art gallery? At the time of his performance, the public were unaware that it was artistically motivated therefore as it was not thought of as art, did that make it a performance? (http://mdx.mrooms.net/pluginfile.php/976000/mod_resource/content/1/WalkingintheCity2016-lectureslides.pdf)\n\nThis lecture looked into the Avant-garde, Impressionism and the modern city/haussmannisation. Examples of how the city, art and the everyday have been expressed through the avant-garde style include the works of Kurt Schwitters, ‘Merbild’ (1919) and ‘Merzbild K 6: Huthbild’ (1919). Famous for his unique collages and highly influenced by Dadaism, Schwitters explored the concept of the ‘everyday’ by combining ordinary materials like labels, bus tickets and wood.\n\nKurt Schwitters ‘Merzbild,’ (1919)\n\nOne example of Impressionism in the city is Gustave Caillebotte’s ‘Pont Europe’ (1876). Depicting a ‘flaneur’ (a man who strolls around observing society) walking with a female who is interpreted to be a prostitute, the painting demonstrates city life at that time in Paris. Ideas regarding homosexuality have also been considered as the flaneur is looking past his companion in the direction of the other man. As Caillebotte was a lifelong bachelor, art historians are unsure of his sexual orientation however feel that this piece perhaps references this. Due to the Haussmannisation of 1853-1870, Paris was revolutionised. As many artists were influenced by their environment, this process had a great impact on modernism in art. Other Impressionist painters like Edouard Manet were able to redefine Paris as a newly improved city.\n\n‘Le Pont de L’Europe,’ Caillebotte (1876).\n\n29/11/2017\n\nBRIDGET SMITH\n\nSmith (b.1966) is a British visual artist who works with photography and video. Experimenting with fantasy and escapism as well as exploring the documentary aspect, her interests include ‘places where people seek refuge, escaping boredom, to be transported, absorbed – places to lose oneself, where pretence and reality are often confused.’ Her intentions are to disconnect people from their everyday lives and concerns. Through her photographs she documents the ‘construction of fantasy and the architecture of entertainment.’ Portraying themes which ‘address our struggle to feel connected: within society, the landscape and the wider universe,’ her still and moving images often present ideas of objectivity and subjectivity along with the real and the fake. Smith’s work represents the bridge between our imagination and reality.\n\nAfter viewing her work, I would like to take from her the sense of serene atmosphere that she creates through photographing these isolated settings. I may do this by the types of colours I use in my drawings of landscapes. Although I intend to use pen and oil pastels to do this, I wish to use softer tones similar to the neutral yellows and browns that Smith uses.\n\n‘Glamour Studio (Locker Room)’ (1999)\n\n‘The Picker House (Living Room)’ (2012)\n\nAdding humour to my photography experiments, I played around with what you wouldn’t expect to see or hear in certain situations. I did not want to develop these further as I wanted to focus on photo collages that involved drawing, pattern and interesting compositions.\n\nLooking at the underground as a location, I tried to incorporate pattern and line in a way that represents the tube map. Although the geometric shapes and vibrant colours make these experiments interesting to look at, I believe that the composition could be slightly more fluid. Perhaps I could illustrate my journeys through using the photos taken, adding lines and words associated with the underground, like ‘please mind the gap’. I shall continue to use pen but possibly add textiles and acrylic.\n\n22/11/2017\n\nTATE BRITAIN\n\nVisiting the Tate Britain gave me an insight into the work of Anne-Estelle Rice, Nigel Henderson and Henry Moore. I am most inspired by Rice’s bold black prints and hope to work in a similar way recording landscapes. Moore’s colourful and overlapping lithographs also interest me as I would like to layer and collage lines, shapes and images when drawing landscapes or objects associated with location.\n\nSmall sketches demonstrating my use of pen and oil pastels. I wanted to experiment with colour and texture/pattern for some, for example the sky in the image of Trafalgar Square. I enjoy creating drawings that have a graphic aspect to them but I also like to make sure that they present strong elements of colour or line. Scenes of interest include significant/historical buildings and personal memories (i.e.photographs).\n\n06/12/2017\n\nPETER DAVIES\n\nScottish born artist Davies (b.1970) who lives and works in London, uses acrylic to express ephemeral pop-culture information systems like lists, charts and bylines. Working in abstract and minimalist styles, his large canvases often display imperfect patterns of bright colours. Placing himself at the forefront by using language and structure, he presents the idea of art as being just another commodity in the entertainment business. ‘Peter Davies’s paintings combine ‘the tough, dry humour of conceptualism and the elegance and beauty of formalism’. As Davies explains: ‘It allows conceptualism to be a “look” and formalism to be an “idea”.’ (1) Aiming to transform the dry stereotypes of modernism into familiar and friendly forms of art, Davies’ approach is ‘in keeping with the wry, irreverent nostalgia of the 1990’s, particularly that decade’s pop-cultural retrospection.’ (2)\n\nThe painting ‘Small Touching Squares’ (1998) consists of three sections of joined canvas. Having used just acrylic and graphite, the large triptych appears to be a multicoloured sea of diagonal lines. If the viewer were to examine the work closely they would see that the canvases have been covered in line after line with small coloured squares. By drawing attention to the process by which the work was made, Davies highlights ‘the primacy of the artist’s hand in the generation of the pattern, which may, from a distance, register as though it were produced by a computer.’ (2) Revisiting the theme of geometric grids in another painting ‘Small Touching Squares in a Pattern Painting,’ (1998) Davies produces a ‘dizzying surface of acid and pastel tones.’ (2) Sharing similar intentions with the artist Bridget Riley, they are considered optical artists. Davies mentions that, ‘if my painting just looked like decorative pattern, that could be interesting for five minutes, but then, who cares? It’s got to look like not just op art, but op art and twenty different other things at the same time.’ (2)\n\n‘Small Touching Squares’ 1998\n\n(1) http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/peter_davies.htm\n\n(2) http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/davies-small-touching-squares-painting-t07426\n\nFrom looking at his work, I hope to experiment with colour further perhaps in a way that explores optical illusion. I could do this in my next project which involves photography, however I would like to draw from the photographs which I will take using an abstract style and could focus on line and shape. I could experiment with similar patterns and draw onto the photographs.\n\nV & A MUSEUM\n\nSketches include Biro pen, black marker, and pencil displaying religious and sentimental elements. Enjoyed keeping to black and white although to progress further could add colour? I feel that I might explore observational drawing involving colour in future projects.\n\nErnst Kirchner\n\nDrawings inspired by ANNE-ESTELLE RICE\n\nFound using black pen and colourful oil pastels a successful technique. Like Kirchner, I have tried to use an experimental colour scheme along with the black outlines. I would like to continue drawing in this style although perhaps I could try using acrylic or stronger outlines giving a more graphic appearance.\n\nTo begin with, I had a few ideas that portrayed time, one being a collection of the same object as it would take time to do this, another being a large line of dominoes to show the continuous effect one object would have on another. An example of this is the performance piece, ‘The Way Things Go,’ by German artists Fischli and Weiss, who explore the idea of cause and effect in their video of a well-orchestrated sequence of everyday materials (plastic bags, tyres, balloons and candles). They ‘unravel a notion of progress tied to efficiency and embrace the absurd and unruly as essential values of daily life,’ leaving it up to a pre-planned coincidence for the objects to follow one after the other.\n\nAfter mind-mapping, I had decided to explore the idea of ‘process’ as this is another form of time. As we were looking into performance and video workshops, I thought that this idea would be perfect as it could demonstrate a beginning and end. Ideas included a video of a collection of images displaying the change of a person or place over time or destroying/transforming materials as part of a performance piece.\n\nI thought about how I could relate the theme of identity (British Culture) to the materials/images used, for example, I aimed to experiment with burning/cooking classic British dishes or food associated with a particular British occasion. This would have enabled me to express a certain emotion through an item of food, for instance, burning/destroying a birthday cake plays on both the joyful representation of this event as well as the displeasing appearance it would have after the effect of fire. Positive and negative aspects of a birthday include coming together and getting older. I could have also looked into burning historic British commercial brand packaging or items of clothing, however this might have changed my intention of destroying to create as the viewer could perceive this process as insulting British culture.\n\nI was most interested in the idea of process and burning materials, so as to represent the ideology of the Auto-Destructive Movement. The concept of destroying to create something new intrigued me as if I did choose to burn materials how much of it would be left to look at. I aimed to record this process using either a video camera or my phone and intended for a sculptural outcome.\n\n30/10/2017\n\nWHAT IS ART HISTORY (FOR)?\n\nArt history can be defined as the systematic historical engagement with and study of art practises. It is also a range of frameworks of analysis and contextualisation of art practices into aesthetic contexts (artworks, histories, traditions and movements), cultural contexts (visual culture and religion) and socio-economic contexts. Art history comes under three categories: social art history, radical art history and new art history. Griselda Pollock, a cultural analyst who studies in the visual arts defends the educational as well as social value of studying art history for everyone, ‘it is a way to see what people thought, felt, believed, did and imagined, by looking at the material things-buildings, paintings, gardens, sculptures, images, cities, objects-and the worlds that they made’. Artists engage with art history to create works of their own. It allows for artists to draw on a new form of analysis which involves a critique from the art world.\n\nResearch plays a huge role in art practice. Throughout this lecture, we looked into examples of art history and artists who use research in their own art practice. For instance, Faith Ringgold’s ‘Dancing at the Louvre, The French Collection I:1’ (1991) is an investigation into the race and gender of the Parisian art scene at the turn of the 20th century. ‘The French Collection simultaneously gives a historical and critical account of exclusion and undertakes the work of reparation in fiction and in visual representation. In her interpretation of another quilt from the French Collection, Picasso’s Studio, Ann Gibson comments on the self-reflexivity of the series: it is about the canon of European Modernism, while simultaneously “rewriting” it: to borrow Pollock’s incisive phrase from her discussion of Himid, Ringgold’s quilted canvases strike their difference within the canon by the representation of Willia Marie, a young black woman artist, as a great Modernist mistress.’ (Alexandra Kokoli, ‘Fetishism and the Stories of Feminist Art’. In Kokoli (ed.), Feminism Reframed, Cambridge Scholars Press, p. 218).\n\nCombining representational painting and African-American quilting techniques, Ringgold draws on her own struggle for recognition in an art world dominated by European traditions and male artists. Using this narrative format to rewrite the past by weaving together personal biography and histories of modern art and African-American culture, she offers an alternative to the European and masculine interpretations that are prevalent in art history.\n\nAnother example where an artist has used art history to create works of their own includes Jeff Wall and his ‘Picture for Women,’ (1979). As a response to Edouard Manet’s ‘Un bar aux Folies Bergère,’ it exemplified numerous conceptual, material and visual concerns found in most of his other works. It is a key photograph representing the change from small scale black and white photographs to large scale colour that took place in the 1980’s.\n\n‘ Though issues of the male gaze, particularly the power relationship between male artist and female model, and the viewer’s role as onlooker, are implicit in Manet’s painting, Wall updates the theme by positioning the camera at the centre of the work, so that it captures the act of making the image (the scene reflected in the mirror) and, at the same time, looks straight out at us.’ (http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/jeff-wall/jeff-wall-room-guide/jeff-wall-room-guide-room-1)\n\nI would like to use art historical research in my own practice, therefore intend to educate myself further in art history. One piece that I particularly admire is Jeff Wall’s photograph, ‘Suburbs in Vancouver,’ (1988) as it highlights the idea that life goes on. This is portrayed through the fact that while the subjects argue and fight, surrounding residents continue with their day-to-day lives as normal. I also like that it has been taken from a birds eye viewpoint as this reinforces the idea that whatever negativity we experience in our lives, we are just small insignificant beings encompassed by strangers.\n\nAction Workshop-Giles Bunch-31/10/2017\n\nWorking in the action space as a group with our tutor Giles was a fantastic experience. We explored ideas involving sounds that we had heard over the past week as well as the sounds in the room. Activities included repeating the sounds heard, imitating one another and sharing personal thoughts on small pieces of paper. We were then asked to work in pairs and perform a sound piece in relation to the personal thoughts/sounds written down on the small slips of paper. I enjoyed being able to express myself through performance as an art form, however, I would like to experiment with the concept of making materials/objects perform. Sound is a key aspect of the performance, perhaps I could have objects imitating each other, one after another to display the theme of ‘time’? (Kitchen timer, metronome, alarm clock).\n\nAfter viewing some of the artists whom Giles has referenced (Stacy Makishi-performance artist who uses film, theatre, comedy and visual art, Evan Ifekoya-uses mirroring/video effects) I think that I would like to look into narrative audios that demonstrate ‘time’-maybe poetry. Similarly to Makishi, I could add a sense of humour to my video/performance by using unusual objects/props. For example, I wish to look at the Auto-Destructive Movement, therefore will incorporate the destroy to create method. Sound effects could include a ticking clock or repetition of the word time.\n\nGUSTAV METZGER\n\nMetzger (1926-2017) was an artist and political activist who began the Auto-Destructive Movement as well as the Art Strike. Collaborating with artists such as John Sharkey, talks were held among a diverse group of international artists, poets and scientists discussing the theme of the destruction in art. The most famous example is ‘The Destruction in Art Symposium’ of September 1966.\n\nThrough looking at his work, I hope to imitate the concept of destroying/manipulating materials in order to create something new. Could try burning wax, marshmallows or paper to produce sculptural artwork?\n\nSABURO MURAKAMI\n\nMurakami (1925) who began the Zero Group of artists which merged with the Gutai Art Association, is most famous for his conceptual paintings and performances. The Gutai group was the first radical, post-war artistic group in Japan. His free-spirited approach to art was demonstrated by his ‘Kami-Yaburi(Paper-Breaking)’ works which displayed the idea that through chaos emerges beauty. There is a photographic series of his work ‘Passage’ (1956). Destroy to create/produces something beautiful?\n\nJON SHIREMAN\n\nA professional photographer who takes ordinary flowers and freezes them using liquid nitrogen. His photographic series, ‘Broken Flower,’ shows the before and after effects of the liquid, illustrating the concept of unfamiliarity once the flowers have broken apart. Similar idea of destroying to create something new. I would like to emulate the technique of photographing objects breaking at high-speed, using the camera effects. Could shatter delicate objects like glass, porcelain, plates? Freeze food in liquid nitrogen and break? Changes purpose.\n\nJEAN TINGUELY\n\nTinguely (1925-1991) was a Swiss painter and sculptor. He is best known for his DaDa inspired sculptural machines. Intrigued by Kinetic Art: (art that contains movement which depends on motion so as to achieve an effect) but also the issue of overproduction in the industrial society. Some of his work provides a purpose such as making noise or lighting up, whereas others self-destruct. What is most interesting is that his work challenges the concept of a static art viewing experience.The reaction of the audience to these moving mechanical objects is certainly one of fascination.\n\nFrom researching Tinguely, I would like to explore the idea of motion and possibly cause and effect. Objects included could be those associated with British culture, perhaps my own personal belongings/British products. Could use the domino effect on British objects? This idea of cause and effect is closely linked to the process of burning as firstly, they both represent a process. There is also an uncertain and uncontrolled characteristic involved, making us unsure about the amount of time they will take to reach an outcome.\n\nAfter stumbling across Tinguely’s loose and vibrant illustrations, I wish to use them as references for future projects. I shall include strong colour, ink marks and abstraction, perhaps I will use this style for the next theme ‘Location’.\n\nYAYOI KASAMA\n\nA Japanese artist and writer (1929) who is most famous for her performance/installation pieces. After arriving in New York in the 1950’s, she became increasingly interested in the European and American Avant-Garde Art Movement. Her sculptural commissions for public and private institutions such as ‘Pumpkin’ (1994) and ‘Infinity Mirror Room’ (1965) display ideas of repetition and previous works on paper. Exploring space with mirrors and repeating an object using mirrors and a range of perspectives could be quite interesting? Additionally, the overall experience for the viewer after entering one of Kusama’s installation pieces is extraordinary as it takes them out of this world. For the project of ‘time,’ I could use mirrors to experiment with light in order to achieve a bedazzled effect on the viewer.\n\n06/11/2017\n\nTIME-BASED MEDIA (SOUND) LECTURE\n\nTime-based media includes video, film, audio, slide and computer technologies because they have duration as a dimension and unfold to the viewer over time. For example, in the interactive work ‘Magnet TV’ (1965) Paik invited viewers to modify the televisions output into swerving abstract lines through the movement of a magnet over the TV. Some however may argue that all art involves the dimension of art as any artwork can portray historic value or be experienced for a limited time only such as Carsten Holler’s ‘Test Site’ (2006-2007) which are a group of controversial spiral slides.\n\nAll art is time-based from a phenomenology perspective. ‘Phenomenology is the study of structures of consciousness as experienced from the first-person point of view. The central structure of an experience is its intentionality, its being directed toward something, it is an experience of or about some object.’ (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/#Rel)\n\n‘Sound art dates back to the early inventions of futurist Luigi Russolo who, between 1913 and 1930, built noise machines that replicated the clatter of the industrial age and the boom of warfare. Dada and surrealist artists also experimented art that uses sound. Marcel Duchamp’s composition Erratum Musical featured three voices singing notes pulled from a hat, a seemingly arbitrary act that had an impact on the compositions of John Cage, who in 1952 composed 4’33’’ a musical score of four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence. (Four minutes thirty three seconds is 273 seconds. The temperature minus 273 Celsius is absolute zero).\n\nBy the 1950’s and 1960’s visual artists and composers like Bill Fontana were using kinetic sculptures and electronic media, overlapping live and pre-recorded sound, in order to explore the space around them.\n\nSince the introduction of digital technology sound art has undergone a radical transformation. Artists can now create visual images in response to sounds, allow the audience to control the art through pressure pads, sensors and voice activation, and in examples like Jem Finer’s Longplayer, extend a sound so that it resonates for a thousand years.’ (http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/s/sound-art)\n\nAn example of sound art includes Susan Hiller’s installation piece, ‘Monument’. It is a series of forty-one photographs exhibiting memorial plaques the artist came across in Postman’s Park, close to St.Paul’s Cathedral, London. Each one commemorates an ordinary man, woman or child who died performing an act of heroism. Arranged in a diamond shape on the gallery wall, a park bench with a cassette player and headphones faces the work. Addressing themes of heroism, death, memory and representation, Hiller’s own voice plays through the headphones as an associative commentary.\n\n‘For Hiller, there is a significant distinction to be made between two modes of existence for each of the individuals commemorated in the plaques. In the audio tape, the artist reads a list of the individuals’ names distinguishing between the duration of their existence in the body (the number of years they lived) and the duration of their existence as a representation (as a commemorative text on a plaque.) She elaborates: ‘We could exist forever, inscribed, portrayed, as inscriptions, portraits, representations. I’m representing myself to myself… and for you, to you. This is my voice.’ (Monument, 1981, p.6.)\n\n‘In Monument (1980-81), for instance, where the entire piece is activated by a person who sits on a bench listening to a sound tape, a person must be prepared to be seen in public performing a private act of listening. Since that person is seen by other viewers against a backdrop of photographic images, the piece exists as a tableau with a living centre, while the person is also part of the audience for the work.’\n\n(Interview with Stuart Morgan, Susan Hiller, p.38.) (http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hiller-monument-t06902)\n\nEXPERIMENTS:\n\nWorking with the mediums of film and performance, I wanted to explore the concept of a beginning and an end. In other words, a ‘process’ as this represents the act of time passing. Aiming to create a sculptural piece, I experimented with newspaper as it is a highly flammable material, therefore was intrigued as to what forms might appear. Following up on the theme of destroying to create, I believe that this experiment was more successful in demonstrating time rather than creating something new with meaning. Initially, I had intended to burn junk food in order to represent the negative impact it has on our bodies although found this difficult as food is non-flammable. To further this idea of process, I thought about filming the start to finish of the makings of a meal as this could present food as not only a ritual that brings people together but also the significance of it’s role in our lives.\n\nI then went on to continue to portray the act of time, physically and metaphorically using the symbol of the birthday cake. Directly imitating Gustav Metzger’s ideology of auto-destruction, I tried to recreate the appearance of the birthday cake. While filming, I experimented with the time lapse and the slow motion technique on my iPhone. The slow motion technique emphasised the sounds of destruction making them louder and more intense while the time lapse distorted the image.\n\nROYAL ACADEMY: JASPER JOHNS 18/11/2017\n\nAttracting attention from the American art world from as early as 1958, with his iconic images of flags, targets, numbers and letters, Johns established a new direction in Art combining Neo-DaDa, Pop Art and Abstract Expressionism. His exploration of iconography and objects/symbols/words make the familiar unfamiliar. The exhibition, ‘Something Resembling Truth,’ at the Royal Academy reveals a range of continuities and changes displayed in Johns’ work over the past six decades. The 1960’s for Johns involved adding a variety of household and studio belongings to his paintings. Abstract pattern such as cross-hatching dominated his work in the 1970’s and in the 1980’s, 1990’s and 2000’s, he introduced a variety of ambiguous words and images along with artistic references from artists including Pablo Picasso and Edvard Munch.\n\nBy using layers, repetition and abstraction, Johns is able to experiment with how meaning is created through allowing the audience to experience viewing original symbols in a different way. Johns essentially alters the purpose/meaning of symbols, objects and words challenging not only the concept of art but also the existence of nature. His intention was to provoke the viewer to break fixed habits of perception. Furthermore, Johns has been incredibly influential on the young generation of artists. Paving the way for Minimalism and becoming a major influence on Pop Art through focusing on objects and familiar everyday imagery, he is considered as a highly important artist of the 20th century.\n\nChallenging our senses and encouraging new ways of thinking and experiencing the world, all of his work attempts to achieve ‘something resembling truth’. Jasper Johns (2006): ”One hopes for something resembling truth, some sense of life, even of grace, to flicker, at least, in the work”. I would like to imitate his graphic/experimental format which can be seen in paintings like ‘Summer’ (1985) for future projects such as ‘Location’.\n\nMARINA ABRAMOVIC-Rhythm 0 (1974)\n\nSerbian performance artist, Abramovic explores pushing the limits of the body, the relationship between the performer and the audience and the extent of the mind. Creating a new notion of identity through her art by engaging with the public and confronting aspects of pain and emotional/physical struggle. Abramovic wanted to test the limits of the relationship between herself and the viewer as seen in ‘Rhythm 0’. Placing 72 objects on a table and leaving the audience to use them however they wished, she took a passive role and became an object herself. She remained motionless for six hours, allowing the audience to use these objects in a way that manipulated her body. ‘This tested how vulnerable and aggressive the human subject could be when hidden from social consequences. By the end of the performance, her body was stripped, attacked, and devalued into an image that Abramović described as the “Madonna, mother, and whore.” Additionally, markings of aggression were apparent on the artist’s body. There were cuts on her neck made by audience members, and her clothes were cut off her body.’ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Abramovi%C4%87#cite_note-demaria-2)\n\n‘Rhythm 0’ (1974)\n\nUsing a mannequin, I hope to re-enact ‘Rhythm 0’ by asking family members and friends to manipulate this object with other objects almost as if it were a human being. I believe that performance art is about using the body to represent artistic ideas. Intending to dress it up and put a wig on it, I wish to photograph it out in public, placing it in scenes and positions that make it appear human like, consequently confusing the audience and making them reflect upon the relationship we have between objects and the artist. Furthermore, as she represents the objectification of the female body, I think that it would be interesting to characterise this mannequin as female, reinforcing the idea that women are objectified and in some cases manipulated.\n\nDressing the mannequin up resulted in a very peculiar appearance, so much so that I wasn’t entirely sure as to whether I should position it in public. Completely abusing and ridiculing it allowed me to think about Abramovic’s experience during ‘Rhythm 0’ along with the theme of drama through art. Carrying out this experiment reminded me of the 1980’s film ‘Mannequin’ which highlights our relationship with material objects.\n\n‘The Dynamics of Fine Art’ journey begins with the theme of ‘identity’. This could involve focusing on my own personal identity or various social groups in society. Google’s definition of identity is ‘the fact of being who or what a person or thing is’. This is true to some extent as an identity could be a place, memory, past experience, or belief of someone or of many. Upon researching into this theme, I have discovered that I would like to look at the history of British culture, preferably the 1960’s leading up to the 1990’s, reflecting on not just my own identity but also my grandparents, mother and aunts.\n\n16/10/2017\n\nWHAT IS ART? WHAT DOES ART DO?\n\nArt, most commonly defined as a visual form of either expression or practice of human creative skill, can be perceived in many ways. To fully comprehend the meaning of art, it is necessary to ask the following questions, what is art, what does it do and why are the boundaries of art continuously altered?\n\nFirstly, what is art and more importantly who gets to decide what art is? Art is all around us. It’s in the architecture of our homes, the design of our furniture and the paintings on our walls. Whether it’s Leonardo Da Vinci’s ‘Mona Lisa’ or Piet Mondrian’s ‘Colour Composition II’ the diverse appearance in art makes its meaning all the more richer. An art philosopher, Arthur Danto believes that “it is the role of artistic theories to make the artworld, and art, possible,” (Danto,1964) questioning what makes an artwork. I too agree with this statement as if an artist’s work has not been artistically identified, it is uncertain as to whether the audience will interpret a similar understanding of the message portrayed.\n\nSecondly, art has many purposes, the most significant being to communicate ideas, feelings, thoughts and observations. Sub-categories include therapy, utilitarianism and decoration. Art should evoke emotion from an audience, “the purpose of art is to stimulate arousal that is appreciated” (The Art Story Foundation,2017). Artists who are to communicate well enough what they feel achieve this effect. Good art forces the viewer to think deeply about not only the world around them but also how this world may be represented.\n\nThe boundaries of art are forever changing. New theories defining what art is are constantly emerging. Academic Art, Modern Art and Postmodern Art all followed the Renaissance period, changing the way art was regarded. The decades after Postmodern Art (1970) involved ‘’artistic experimentation with new media and new art forms, including conceptual art, performance art and installation art’’ (Encyclopedia of Art,2017). Consequently stretching art’s definition to the point where anything could be art.\n\nOverall, the topic of defining art is highly controversial as it could just about be anything. However, this is even more reason for those in the artworld to judge between real art and amateur art by using artistic theories in order to add reasoning behind what is being communicated.\n\nReferences\n\nDanto, A.

On the whole it was quite a lengthy process as there were many health and safety issues to be mentioned along with a thorough step by step technique. I would perhaps like to try the medium once more later on in either this project or the next as the finished result appears incredibly professional. However, scratching an image onto the stainless/mild steel was quite difficult as if mistakes were made you would be unable to hide them, whereas with lino it’s easier to think about where you are cutting into. Lino is certainly a material I wish to use to express the concept of British culture as it has a similar final outcome and is more straightforward. I have had previous experience with lino cutting and desire to improve my skills further.\n\n18/10/2017\n\nANTHONY LUVERA\n\nAn Australian artist, writer and educator based in London who uses photography as a medium to socially engage the public by representing those who are stigmatised. His photographic work has been exhibited extensively across countries such as Northern Ireland, Australia and France. Luvera also contributes considerably to the education sector, frequently giving workshops, lectures and mentorship programmes.\n\nAfter coming in to talk about the projects he has been involved with over the last decade or so, one exhibition in particular, ‘Not going shopping,’ (2013-2014), struck me as interesting. This is because of its compositional layout and also the short captions next to each photographic portrait which clearly identify themes of social stigma towards the gay community, resilience and identity. The way in which the series was exhibited was done in a non-traditional style as not only was it published in a 16 page newspaper of at least 4,000 copies but it was also displayed on large-format posters in public spaces across Brighton. Questions to be reflected upon include, how can we continue to use documentary photography as a visual language in order to activate social change? How can we create images with people, instead of people?\n\n19/10/2017\n\nSAATCHI GALLERY\n\nAaron Fowler, ‘Untitled (Foot Locker)’ (2013)\n\nMy notes: (Gathered from exhibition)\n\nUses mixed-media on canvas, large, collages using 3-D elements, textural, animated, story-telling, uses found materials, design orientated, child-like.\n\nAn American artist, Fowler creates mixed-media assemblage-paintings illustrating not only personal experiences but also contemporary America. Art for him is a way of expressing the violence, poverty and corruption he has seen throughout his life. He mentions in his artist’s statement that he wants his ‘audience punctured by what they have experienced (his work) leaving them with a feeling of connection and conversation with a world that may not be familiar,’ (www.saatchigallery.com). This world in which Fowler refers to is the Black lower class culture. Using a wide selection of collaged materials such as oil paints, plastic, holograms and various images, Fowler represents a pirate painting loosely based on his experience of growing up in St.Louis, Missouri.\n\nFrom looking at his work, I would like to experiment with collaging/overlapping images and materials related to British culture. In order to make my work more personal, I could include photos of myself or of family members. I could also include well-known British commercial brands like ‘Quality Street’ sweet wrappers.\n\nDaniel Crews-Chubb, ‘Zumbi and Belief Series,’ (2015)\n\nMy notes: Uses oil, acrylic, spray paint, charcoal, pen and collaged fabrics. Interesting way of drawing. Bold outlines, messy, story-telling. Reminds me of Basquiat.\n\nAn up-and-coming British painter, Crews-Chubb often depicts large vibrant loosely drawn figures, usually both male and female, ”locked” in ambiguous relationships. Employing a rather expressionistic painterly style, his work clearly references an approach towards painting used by many artists including the French painter Jean Dubuffet and Picasso. Using his primary influences: primitive art, ancient rituals and amateur anthropology, his work is seen as highly original and positively contemporary.\n\nAfter being exposed to the work of Crews-Chubb, I would certainly enjoy working with similar types of materials, most preferably fabric as I am intrigued to see what sort of textured outcome it might have combined with paint and possibly mod-rock.\n\nMaurizio Anzeri, ‘Giovanni’ (2009) Embroidery on Photograph\n\nMy notes: Uses geometric shapes to distort/exaggerate faces. Quite colourful and abstract. Completely changes the way in which we see the photographic portrait. Disturbing/interesting. Intrinsic patterns- focuses on one area of the face, usually the eye (portrays identity of figure). Amusing, combines 3-D on a two dimensional surface, creates texture.\n\nSewing embroidered patterns directly onto found vintage photographs, Anzeri explores the converge between historic and futuristic dimensions. His elaborate designs tend to garnish the figures abstracting their personalities, however drawing attention towards features such as the eye and mouth suggests Anzeri’s intention of revealing the person’s thoughts and feelings.\n\nFor future works/projects, I wish to experiment with threading into materials like paper or cardboard and possibly 3-Dimensional objects. For this current project, I would like to focus more on collaging images.\n\nAlexander Calder, ‘Calder on Paper,'(1960-76) and ‘Composition (Pyramids and Sun on Target)'(1973).\n\nMy notes: Uses primary colours, abstract, shapes, circus-like, black/bold outlines. I would like to imitate the use of bold outlines as well as his geometric style.\n\nAn American sculptor/painter, Calder (1898-1976) is most known for his delicately balanced and often suspended shape sculptures: named ‘stabiles’. The early 1930’s was a time at which Calder’s prints became thoroughly motivated by abstraction. Lines and colours became stronger, primarily outlining groups of geometric shapes. Calder was fascinated by geometry-”out of different masses, tight, heavy, middling-indicated by variations of size and colour-directional line-vectors which represent speeds, velocities, accelerations, forces-these directions making between them meaningful angles, together defining one big conclusion or many,” (www.wikipedia.org).\n\nFor my final result I wanted to portray the identity of British culture through a series of small posters displaying the most evolutionary decades. Personally, I believe that the 60’s, 70’s, 80’s and 90’s were the most interesting periods of time due to factors such as fashion, art, music and the development of technology. One thing that I would have done differently is make the posters slightly larger as I found it difficult trying to fit everything on to such a small scale.\n\nFor each decade I have included a collage page, potential compositions for the final result, mock-ups, and final colour compositions. These are my 1960’s experiments. I looked into different patterns, symbols and colours. Text was really important to me as the ‘Hippie’ font and thick black text style is most associated with this decade.\n\nThe pastel tones and black outlines along with the contrast of the white acrylic paint help to make this a successful experiment. I also chose to use symmetry as I thought that this would give a more effective appearance. The composition as a whole is simple making it graphic and powerful.\n\nThese are my 1970’s experiments. The colours brown,orange and yellow I felt were quite prominent throughout this era, whether that be through interior design or fashion. I tried to incorporate texture by using string, foil, tissue and netting, which helped to create pattern. I also used symmetry to give the piece a sense of balance. Using techniques such as repetition along with outlining text in black pen worked well as it has given the experiment a professional appearance. Deciding to collage materials was a method inspired by the African-American artist Aaron Fowler.\n\nThe final piece as a whole is successful primarily due to its simple composition and use of colour. I think the contrast between the white background and the yellow, red and black is very effective as it instantly attracts the viewer’s eye.\n\nThese are my 1980’s experiments. I enjoyed looking into the people, patterns, words/phrases and fashion associated with this time. Again, I tried to experiment with texture by painting over a netted material. I also loved using quite luminous tones and exploring shape/pattern with pen and pastels.\n\nIn the end, I went for a geometric, tight but busy composition. The technique of contrasting black outlined shapes with a white background makes the experiment stand out. The colours used are quite basic however do give the piece an 80’s feel, perhaps because of the use of primary/luminous colours. I really liked being able to pack as much subject matter into the piece as possible as it helps to illustrate this decade as quite stylised and energetic.\n\nThese are my 1990’s experiments. I continued to use pen and pastel as I felt most comfortable with them. Gold pen was also quite interesting to experiment with as it highlighted shapes and text. Once more, outlining shapes with black as well as colour and adding white paint to the background creates contrast.\n\nThe simple composition is the most effective characteristic. Again, I have used symmetry as this makes the appearance easier to the eye. I chose green and red as I felt that these colours stand out. In addition to this, the polka dots help to create a busy atmosphere.\n\n23/10/2017\n\nWHO IS AN ARTIST?\n\nBy definition, an artist is someone who engages in an activity related to creating art, practising the arts or demonstrating an art. As the meaning of art varies, so too does the term artist. In context, an artist would be somebody qualified to practise art, however, amateur artists having had no previous experience in this field might well call themselves artists. An artist is simply anybody who says they are one. I believe that if they are involved in acts of creation, then they are therefore creating art. Whether or not their work be acknowledged as art, they are still engaging in art related activities.\n\nThis lecture concentrated on the devaluation of women’s art throughout history. ‘In an era when painting, portraiture and the female artist are still regularly dismissed or marginalised – only one in four of this year’s Turner prize nominees are women and none of them work in portraiture or painting, while only 5% of commercial London galleries show an equal number of male and female artists,’ (https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/19/why-female-artists-airbrushed-history-annie-kevans).\n\nFemales have always been considered as inferior, so their recognition in the"
