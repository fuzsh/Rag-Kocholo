        "text": "A splinter in the throat\n\nThe nocturnal animals among us could hardly contradict Jean Rouzaud’s statement: « clubs are research labs ». In a book published in tribute to his years at the Palace nightclub (1978-1983), the former founding member of Bazooka goes over his memories of a mythical place that continues to haunt Parisian nights. « Parties at the Palace… the magic, the carnival, the excitement, the cult of the night and dancing… In truth, we should say it because it was a determining factor, the frustrations caused by leftism had given rise to a generation that wanted to throw everything down. The era of punk, but also the comeback of glamor, superficiality, image, and fashion… Everything their older brothers wanted to bury. The whole beginning of the 60s, from Mary Quant to Vidal Sassoon, the Mods, Carnaby Street, dandy psychedelia, Pierre Cardin, and Paco Rabanne. A stillborn form of expression and fashion style, smothered by the lead blanket of ideologies. So many desires to make up for. » In this room « designer style, both Star Wars, and disco” with new wave neon lights and techno lasers, stars rubbed shoulders with trendy artists, starlets, punks, travesties, modern people, the golden youth, party and costume lovers. Happy, unhappy, rich, and poor, but always well put on. Parties could become more important than life itself. Nocturnal life took precedence over daytime, over reality. The Palace was neither an illusion nor an escape. Simply a safe haven, a place of shared happiness, joy, and desire to live. (…) The power of the show was greater. It was possible to think a social revolution was in the making, slowly. A non-aggression pact. »\n\nFlash Dance. At the beginning of the 1980s, on Wednesday nights, Tania Mouraud and her lab didn’t sleep. It was the gay parties of the Palace nightclub, where, for six months, the artist conducted her photographic painting experiments - neither painting nor photograph - in a Ghelderode-like theater of the absurd atmosphere. For her exhibition entitled Flash Back at Ceysson & Benetiere in Paris, Tania Mouraud sheds the spotlight on her Made in Palace series, gone almost unnoticed in 1981 at the studio 6 6 6 with Alain Fleischer and Xavier Veilhan. Today, she presents digital prints, with a grittier and dotted texture.\n\nClear from the start, Tania Mouraud stifles all fantasies: this series is not a reportage on the Palace nightclub; and the artist is not impressed by the name-dropping surrounding this legendary place. Contrary to photographers known for their photographs of famous people of the time, Tania Mouraud worked in slow motion on an Olympus camera with a wide-angle lens and 200 ASA rolls. In the dark light of these electric nights, her lens opened like dilated pupils, and images in motion danced on the negative films. « I don’t know today’s drugs », says Tania Mouraud out of the blue. « My generation was all about acid, mescaline, and LSD. Partying can be beautiful, but it is double-edged, and also very sad. I really don’t want to romanticize the Palace nightclub, but the people were gorgeous. They dressed up. At the Palace, I could work in empathy with models who popped up out of nowhere. I didn’t photograph the gruesome side, I was looking for the dreamlike. I try not to use the term “festive” because people will think I was getting high, whereas my work was closer to Bosch and Egon Schiele. » Rejecting the too often deceptive precision of photography, Tania Mouraud captured a blurry and evanescent reality: the photograph is no longer the snapshot of a moment of life, but a distorted and slender memory fixated in opacity.\n\nNegative. The photographs of the Palace nightclub were the precursors of others: the « shop windows » and the « built images » (1981-1985), objects hanging on inside car mirrors (1986-1988). In these series, the artist found new ways to push back the limits between photography and painting, public and private sphere, in order to reveal what goes on underneath, where nobody ever looks, at the frontiers of reality. The Palace series also announced Tania Mouraud’s work on distortion and stretching, which later unfolded through the words of shape she started creating at city wall scale in 1989. She used language as a plastic form, distorting it to the point of making it unreadable. Typography became a feeling that took precedence over the immediate meaning. In all these series, we can sense the minimalist quest at play in the production of an artist who saw the street as a creative field, a subject matter, and an inspiration. Her invasion of the public space with her City Performance n°1 intervention at the end of the 1970s, which definitely established her « street cred », already formed part of this outdoor research.\n\nBetween December 29, 1977, and January 14, 1978, Tania Mouraud took hold of the urban landscape in East Paris by putting up 54 posters reading the French word “NI” in block letters over 54 4x3m ad boards. Violent visual manifesto, this silent scream in black and white was made possible by the complicity of the advertiser Dauphin (who landed her the ad spaces) and the publicist Philippe Calleux (who printed the posters). What was in Tania Mouraud’s sights? The phallic blathering of advertising discourse, the unarmed wing of a consumption society that causes discrimination. In 1978, Tania Mouraud wrote: « to go out of galleries, museums, and official spaces. To accept the rules of the street: readability=redundancy. (…) NEITHER (ni) inconsequential action, NOR (ni) teasing, nor covert advertisement from the Ministry of Culture. Simply an anonymous statement. Ultimate negation, absolute truth, universal circuit breaker used by Western logicians and Eastern sages. » And while ad people deemed any advertising message under 400 posters invisible to the audience, Tania Mouraud’s textual interventions rose to the second position in memorization tests conducted on test audiences."
