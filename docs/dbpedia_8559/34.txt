Free spirit by nature, Mexican artist driven by the desire to find great avenues of expression, She discovered in the arts a continent of wide horizons to capture her concerns. As an artist she is working to unite her various passions: sculpture, photography and painting, to create works full of self-expression and simplicity. Every work of art is a unique and unrepeatable way to show her vision of life. Her work explores a fascination to symbols, geometry, materials and the ability to express our deepest desires, giving meaning and history to our lives. Abstraction and its ability to express, inspires her to continue creating works that achieve speech without words, that reflect aspects of our current lives and achieve reflections beyond form. Her work has been exhibited at Art fairs in the US, Europe and Asia as well as in Galleries, Museums and Biennials worldwide. www.taniaea.com https://www.instagram.com/tania.ea/ http://twitter.com/TaniaEspondaAja http://www.facebook.com/pages/Tania-Esponda-Aja-ART/156580267696627
