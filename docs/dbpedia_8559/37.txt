Looking for a unique piece of art to add to your collection?

Abstract art and geometric abstraction are two different things. First, geometric forms are abstract in nature. The second type of abstract art is neo-impressionistic, where non-objective compositions are created by arranging geometric forms together. In both types of abstract art, there is no clear representation of the subject. Nevertheless, both of these types of abstract art are aesthetically appealing. Here, you will discover the difference between the two.

The movement began in the early 20th century. In the midst of the artistic avant-garde, painters and sculptors experimented with geometric abstraction to challenge traditional forms and ideas. Malevich's White on White (1915) is widely regarded as the most influential work of modern art, and was widely influential. This era gave birth to modern abstraction, with many of the works of abstract art influenced by Cubism and Futurism.

Malevich, a Russian artist, became a pioneer of geometric abstract idioms. His aim was to achieve the "absolute," or the highest spiritual reality. Tatlin was credited with inventing this new idiom of geometric abstraction, and he called these forms "painterly reliefs" and "counter-reliefs." The resulting art was often based on the material properties of the work.
