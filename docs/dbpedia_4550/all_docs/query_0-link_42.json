After the whole thing in Indianapolis went down, they switched and started doing brand new builds in areas that have good rental markets (and in rental friendly states), I always assumed they did that because they got burned from the deal you are referring to.\n\nHe does real estate investing podcast, and they both do a news/political podcast as well that I enjoy listening to.\n\nKara Swisher was good value for money whenever she appeared on TWiT - her last appearance on the show was in 2017 (alongside Clayton Morris, coincidentally!)\n\nAnd Amy Webb is always someone I learn much from when she appears. Always plenty of thoughtful insights! Her trio of appearances on Triangulation are worth listening to:"
