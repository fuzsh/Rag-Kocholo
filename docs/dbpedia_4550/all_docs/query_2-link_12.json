Sometimes we just throw the names in the air and they come down and sometimes that's better. This is one of those, maybe, I don't know, maybe Jason Howell had an idea, but I am thrilled by this panel. Let's say hi to Paris Martin know she was a reporter for the information. Always great to see her very crafty today. No sequin be sequined. No Bejo mannequins in the background.\n\nParis Martineau (00:02:42):\n\nI'm gonna I'll I'll move it in frame at the break. Just wait. I'm gonna keep people on their toes. You know,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:48):\n\nI bet you\n\nParis Martineau (00:02:48):\n\nA shifting Tableau,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:50):\n\nThe rest of the panel will recognize something right behind you. And let's find out when we ask, when we say hello to <laugh> yeah, Glen Fleischman. I think he's he? I think I recognize the chuckle from glen.fund longtime reporter for variety of Macintosh magazines, former jeopardy contestant type historian. Hello, Glen. Hello?\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:03:14):\n\nDo I recognize a I see the transparent speaker I've forgotten the exact yeah. Name of it. Is that an original\n\nParis Martineau (00:03:22):\n\nWas Caron card card sound sticks. Yes. I IED them up. It's 20 years. They are, and yet they sound fantastic and they look very cool. I've got them connected to a record player in a fun little mishmash of technology there.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:39):\n\nIs there a person standing behind those Harmon garden sticks?\n\nParis Martineau (00:03:42):\n\nThere is, that is a lamp shaped like a man with a uniquely placed light switch that I will leave to your\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:51):\n\n<Laugh>. Did you make that?\n\nParis Martineau (00:03:53):\n\nI did not, but I bought it from a vintage dealer who excellent. I really enjoy. And\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:58):\n\nEvery time you flip it on, you just go\n\nParis Martineau (00:04:00):\n\nEvery time it flips it on, you know, I'll often have people come over and they'll be like, so where's the light switch. And I'm like, guys, there's only one thing on me.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:08):\n\n<Laugh> there's only one place to look. Wow. That's his terrible <laugh> also with, it's great to have Dan Mor this is the, I think one of the first things you've done off your fraternity leave. Is that right?\n\nDan Moren (00:04:22):\n\nYou first, you are my first stop on the return for my paternity leave. There you go.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:26):\n\nSix colors. Co-Editor with Jason Snell. He has been off for a couple of months with a brand new baby. How old's the baby?\n\nDan Moren (00:04:34):\n\nBaby's about six weeks\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:35):\n\nOld. Oh, so it's not even a couple of months. Wow. How's it been?\n\nDan Moren (00:04:40):\n\nIt's been tiring. Can I need a better camera that doesn't show you the bags under my eyes. But other than that, it's been wonderful.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:47):\n\nI love it. Well, I hope even if you're on paternity, leave you, right? Because we are waiting for volume four of the galactic cold war saga have here. You thankfully sent me the, the latest volume, which is book three, the Nova incident all three of them, by the way. Really good. You know, I'll be honest. I it's, this is terrible to say, but I wasn't expecting much.\n\nDan Moren (00:05:14):\n\nOkay. That's good.\n\nParis Martineau (00:05:18):\n\nYou're starting off. Absolutely brutal.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:05:20):\n\nLet me explain. <Laugh> not\n\nParis Martineau (00:05:22):\n\nA, yeah, we're just at a really low bar. Not\n\nLeo Laporte (00:05:25):\n\nA, not, not, not in, in any way, a, a reflection on you, Dan. It's just that I know quite a few people in our business, you know, that's the old canard. I have a, everybody's got a novel in their desk drawer. Mm-Hmm <affirmative> and the few people I know who have released those novels probably should not have, but now did you start as a writer? And then, you know, as a sci-fi writer and then become a tech writer,\n\nDan Moren (00:05:50):\n\nIt was always a passion of mine. And I, but you know, I got outta college and didn't really know what I was doing. And I worked it for a, a while and then I started writing professionally. And once I had done that, I think it really helped me hone a lot of stuff about my fiction. So I kind of went back to it after spending my first couple years in tech journalism, because it, it felt like, oh, you know, now I kind of understand, I work with deadlines and I've had to do this regularly and put in all these hours and you can't help, but get better. I think at those kinds of tasks, if you do them enough. So I think it, they kind of worked together nicely well,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:22):\n\nAnd that's what I look for in a good novel is somebody who makes deadlines. So <laugh>,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:06:28):\n\nHey, it's harder than\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:28):\n\nYou think. No. Hey, just ask George a R Martin, right? Exactly.\n\nDan Moren (00:06:32):\n\nYeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. That guy's really suffering Patrick for not making deadline. Let me tell you Patrick\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:37):\n\nRothfus, you know there are quite a few in the in our\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:06:40):\n\nDan Dan was the person I thought most likely to become a breakout science fiction author, best seller. Yeah. And I think you're well, on the way to doing that, I'm reading the really good. Was it the, the beta edition of the Cal Dian gambit? I think I read pre-release and I was like, yes, this is,\n\nDan Moren (00:06:54):\n\nThat\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:06:54):\n\nWas a long fine work. And then I read the release version. I'm like, man, this guy also revises, which is incredible. I mean, I like the, I like the, the, the draft and then the, the release version was fantastic, but\n\nLeo Laporte (00:07:05):\n\nThere is there's right. A, a, a, a, somewhat of a leap from nonfiction writing to fiction writing. And not everybody can make that leap. Some have fallen in the CVAs in between. So I just wanted to say, it's really good. And everybody should, if you like, sci-fi this is it. The galactic cold war saga. And you tell me, you've told me that there may be a fourth one in the works.\n\nDan Moren (00:07:30):\n\nYeah. I, well, I'd like to, I've been working on this long overarching sort of plot line, and I am hoping I get a chance to sort of bring Matt to fruition, but each of the, I will say like, you know, a lot of people don't like to pick up a series unless it's done, but I tried to also structure it so that each of the books tells like a, a standalone story in its own regard as well. But like with a, in the background, right. There's like an overarching plot that's developing slowly. So I think you can still get a lot of enjoyment out of the individual volumes as it goes along, without worrying too much about like, oh no, will the series ever be\n\nLeo Laporte (00:07:59):\n\nFinished? You also have the best publisher ever angry robot. <Laugh> I just love that, man. That's true. Yeah.\n\nParis Martineau (00:08:05):\n\nHey, so long as you, you're not angry the series within 30 years, you'll have a leg up on R Martin.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:08:12):\n\nIf they start shooting a season, one of your show, let's say you have five years to get the last book done. That's the\n\nDan Moren (00:08:19):\n\nThat's good. That's\n\nParis Martineau (00:08:20):\n\nComfortable, right. At least the next book done, you know, doesn't even have to be the last book can just be a edition.\n\nDan Moren (00:08:26):\n\nYeah. Stay far enough ahead of the game there.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:08:29):\n\nOr\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:08:29):\n\nYou could this\n\nLeo Laporte (00:08:30):\n\nUp, you could do like the wheel of time and just die before you're done. Yeah.\n\nParis Martineau (00:08:35):\n\nHave you considered that? You\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:08:37):\n\nKnow, Leo has, that's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:08:38):\n\nA fun way to question for you. That's fun way to, that's one way to avoid deadlines. I\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:08:41):\n\nJust had a kid come on. I'm already feeling you little bit more things. You need a little more of that important part of deadline, very spicy Leo today.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:08:47):\n\n<Laugh>\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:08:49):\n\nNo, you could die. I don't know about these folks spicy.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:08:53):\n\nGet to know Brian Sanders, Brandon Sanderson ahead of time. And you'll be you'll. I will set.\n\nDan Moren (00:08:59):\n\nI will tell you, I know I actually have met Brandon because we have the same agent.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:03):\n\nAh, well, he, you know what\n\nDan Moren (00:09:05):\n\nI know him,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:06):\n\nRobert Jordan was very lucky cuz he, he passed away before finishing this. How many 14 books series\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:09:13):\n\n17.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:14):\n\nIt's\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:09:14):\n\nRidiculous. 14 a lot. It's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:15):\n\nInsane. Huge number. Yeah. And of course he died before finishing it it's pretty clear. He, you know, he was gonna keep writing until he died. Thank God he had Brandon Sanderson to come along and, and finish it and finish it in, in, in high style of all of the TV productions of the Willow time TV shows the worst.\n\nParis Martineau (00:09:36):\n\nI don't know. There are some pretty bad TV\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:38):\n\nProduction, but I mean out of classic science fiction, I guess I should say. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:09:42):\n\nI don't have anything. I have no no loyalty to the book series. I hadn't read it. I kinda like will of time. See?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:47):\n\nYeah. That's, that's pretty much how it works. If you've read it, you'll hate it. And if you've never read it, you'll like the TV show. And it is better now that I think of it than foundation, which was which truly awful.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:09:58):\n\nI had so much hope for it. And then by the end it's like, what are you doing? Horrible. Oh, come on. Horrible. I don't know. I don't know what they\n\nLeo Laporte (00:10:05):\n\nWere. How about Lord of the ring rings? We like, I,\n\nDan Moren (00:10:08):\n\nThe ring planned about Lord the rings, Glen is a big Lord of the rings fan.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:10:10):\n\nI, yeah, I'm sitting here with my 15 year old. Who's not read Lord of the rings. And I'm like, oh, well they're not telling a story about FAO. The creator of the SEMAR reels and his original name was, and I'm like, oh my God, I don't remember that. I know all this stuff. Why do I know all this stuff? It's the second\n\nDan Moren (00:10:25):\n\nUseful information. All the useful information, every\n\nParis Martineau (00:10:28):\n\nUseful thing youve forgotten. It's just taken up by\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:10:31):\n\nNames of ELSs. It's not which been rod wise, but Colliner was the friend of the door. No, I'm a little, I'm\n\nLeo Laporte (00:10:39):\n\nA little confused. Have they have they, it's only been two, two episodes. Have they botched the series yet? Or is it pretty much faithful to what little we know?\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:10:49):\n\nI, I think they're doing I think they're doing an incredibly good job of trying to bring in new people without a hundred percent offending people. Yeah. Like I was 30 years ago, the\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:01):\n\nCinderella, the Cinderella\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:11:05):\n\nRelief\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:05):\n\nCI did not, did not, did not specify a lot of this stuff for instance. And I saw somebody note this. Yeah. And I don't think this is a spoiler. But they're sailing the ship into the gray havens. Our our princess, I won't say names. Our princess has been awarded released into the gray havens. She's on the ship. They're standing there, the warriors long voyage, I think. But they're standing there the whole time in their armor. Then these ma come out and help undress them. Yes.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:11:37):\n\nYes.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:38):\n\nAre the, so here's my question. <Laugh> are the, are the main gonna, are they gonna sail the ship back for the next trip or are they going into the gray havens?\n\nDan Moren (00:11:48):\n\nI think it's a one use ship. It seems like it's,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:51):\n\nIt's not gonna survive the, it\n\nDan Moren (00:11:52):\n\nDoesn't seem like it's turning around again. Yeah. Where are those\n\nParis Martineau (00:11:54):\n\nMaidens going? They even gut extra\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:11:58):\n\nGarb. There's some people who can go, but so there's, there's these different order of celestial being and the, but the El have servants and the,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:06):\n\nAnd then the weird thing is so the, the servants take the, we weapons and the armor from the elves and they throw 'em on the ground. They don't, they don't like fold them up, put them away. They just go here. I mean, it's like, what,\n\nParis Martineau (00:12:18):\n\nWhat were you doing? Couldn't they have just done that. They\n\nDan Moren (00:12:20):\n\nJust lay armor. They sell them for scrap later on. They can repurpose it and recycle, you know, but a little,\n\nParis Martineau (00:12:26):\n\nCause they've gotta get another boat to get back. Okay.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:28):\n\nThat's\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:12:29):\n\nRight. The wings of desire, the armor things and wings of desire. Right. So there's all connects up to the Peter, oh, Peter Faulk universe.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:34):\n\nIt all comes back to VIM vendors in the end\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:12:37):\n\nVIM vendors.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:38):\n\nHow about the house of the dragon? Are we are we happy with the house of the dragon?\n\nDan Moren (00:12:43):\n\nI watched the first one and thought it was better than I expected. It was going to be, I was not super invested, but my wife was actually like, oh, I really like to watch. This's like all we'll sit down and watch it. And I don't know. I, I thought it was interesting. Having felt like the game of Thrones show ended on pretty sour note for me, I was more than pleasantly surprised by this and having a little more you know, I thought like having the positioning, the female characters was a little more agency and making a more involved story and like sort of focusing in a bit too. Right. Like rather than having like, there's a 6 million characters and they're all over this continent instead. It's like a smaller group and yeah, we'll see where it goes. Watch next view. I\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:19):\n\nFeel like Glen, you're a little bruised still from season eight of the game of Thrones.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:13:24):\n\nI've never seen a single episode or a portion of, oh, that throne show. I just didn't, it didn't strike me as I'd read George R. Martin before he started raining that series. And I liked some of his, I liked his earlier funnier stuff better as I\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:38):\n\n<Laugh>\n\nDan Moren (00:13:39):\n\nBefore he was curious.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:13:41):\n\nYeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:42):\n\nI'm, I'm starting the show with some light material because we're gonna get pretty heavy right off the bat. We talked about this on Wednesday with our wonderful Mike Masick from tech dirt who has really kind of burst a socket on this children's online safety bill that was just passed in California, were waiting for the governor to sign it into law. It seems like a good idea who wouldn't wanna protect children online. And of course, if you're not in California, you're probably thinking you can take the rod pile lower third down. I don't know why that's there, but there is no rod pile in this story whatsoever. <Laugh> oh my God. I mean,\n\nParis Martineau (00:14:26):\n\nThat's the New York times\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:27):\n\nLost, you lost control. He's lost control of the lower third\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:14:32):\n\nWheel that lower\n\nDan Moren (00:14:33):\n\nTo become ed.\n\nParis Martineau (00:14:35):\n\nYou say Leo, all of your smart assistant have taken over\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:38):\n\nThe show,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:14:39):\n\nScrub the launch, scrub the launch.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:41):\n\nAh, yeah, that was the Artemis story. That'll be coming later. None of you are in California, right? Dan, are you in CA I can't remember where you are. Dan. Massachusetts. Massachusetts. That's why, why your window is open. If you were in California, you would be down now it's about 109 degrees outside.\n\nParis Martineau (00:14:58):\n\nOh yeah. And you guys don't believe in air conditioning, right?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:15:01):\n\nYeah. That's that's the funny thing is people in California say, well, we have natural air conditioning until it gets hot. And then\n\nParis Martineau (00:15:08):\n\nI say, we don't, I don't say much at anything change might change that for\n\nLeo Laporte (00:15:13):\n\nYou. Yeah. so this is maybe not on your radar, but it sure is for us in California and Mike Masnick, who's also California, the New York times story about this, you would never, you know, think there was a problem. The, the California age appropriate design code act requires any web unlike kapa where it only FL affects websites that are aimed at children. This is a website, any website that might have somebody under 18 visited, which I think is any website, certainly ours, certainly Mike Masnick. So if you have the potential that somebody under 18 might visit your website, then you are required to, first of all, know the age of everybody who visits your website, problem. Number one that's pretty intrusive. We don't know the age of anybody who listens to our shows or visits our website. I don't wanna know their age, but in order to enforce this law, I need to, in fact, Mike's concern was, oh am I gonna have to do age verification?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:20):\n\nAnd if I do, how am I gonna do that? He says, it made me face ID. You may have to start, cuz you've got to know, youve got to know how old these people are. Then you have to look at every single feature of your site and do what they call a, a D P I a kind of like an environmental impact report on each feature of your site and how it might infect people under 18. And that has to be a, you have to do it because it has to be available. Should the attorney general of California ask you have 72 hours to produce that?\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:17:01):\n\nYeah. This surely feels like the kinds of rules that go into effect in countries that are trying to prohibit speech or use workarounds like, you know, India has imposed laws and, you know, Russia as opposed more, more draconian ones and even India ostensibly a democracy has imposed laws that, that restrict freedom in the name of safety or freedom from libel or other things. And they're meant to chill speech and this isn't per se designed that way, but it has all the hallmarks of one it's expensive to or impossible to implement. It's probably, I'm not a lawyer. It's probably unconstitutional based on what I'm reading does not seem to fit within the permissibility of, of you know, how this could possibly be enforced. So the, the bar, the burden is undo and it's chilling of speech. And so you're kind of like, well, how did it get this far? I think Mike pointed out in his articles like, well, nobody wants to, you know, you were saying, you know, oh no, I'm opposed to protecting children online. Yeah. Just clip that out. What I just said. Right? Yeah. Congratulations was opposed, you know, I'm not, I'm not, but no one's gonna vote. No politician is gonna say I'm voting against the protecting children from terrible things online bill. Exactly. You know, which is\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:09):\n\nWhy it passed in the Senate 30 to nothing.\n\nDan Moren (00:18:12):\n\nDon't we don't, we do this every few decades. I mean, I'm remembering when I was a teenager, the communications decency act was a big sort of hot button issue at the time, which, you know, that was the, the heady days of 1996 or so. Right where the internet was not at all what it is today, but there was still the sort of the same idea, like, oh, we've gotta figure out a way to flag stuff that might be objectionable so that people aren't exposed to it. And ultimately I think it ended up being sort of impossible to deal with because how do you do that? Right. How do you do that on the internet? How do you control for that kind of information if you can't even control for it in, you know, other public sphere spaces? It seems, I agree with Glen, it seems like an unduly onerous task for people who are, you know, otherwise trying to be law abiding.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:58):\n\nActually the CDA ended up having a positive impact. Ron widen said, you know what, we're gonna have to make an exemption here for social media and other sites. And the section two 30 was written. And thank goodness, go ahead. I'm sorry. Paris.\n\nParis Martineau (00:19:11):\n\nI was saying, I think the thing that sticks out to me is, I mean, how are we expecting all of these different sites or service providers to be able to identify with certainty, whether or not the person accessing your website as a child? I mean, obviously we have currently kind of attracting tools. You can look at website analytics and see the demographics of your users, but a lot of social media sites and providers generally are kind of making their tools in a way that purposefully ignores anybody who could be under 18 because you don't wanna deal with that sort of data. And let's say even if you somehow devised a perfect way to send a flag up when any cell phone owned and operated by someone under 18 accessed your website, that still wouldn't cover situations where like most kids are probably using their parents' iPad or parents' phone for these sort of things. It just seems like a very technical question that is being answered by like kind of a very vague blank blanket order.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:20:11):\n\nI it's designed to impose enforcement, right. It's designed to be violated unintentionally and easily and thus allow government to intervene.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:20:21):\n\nYeah. And Mike raises that issue. In fact, he was told, I think by the sponsors of the bill, well, don't worry that, you know, the California attorney general decides who's prosecuted and one would <laugh>, don't worry. And one would hope that the ag would say, well, you know, TWiT or teched or the information. Yeah. 18 year olds read it, but it's not, they're not a threat to 18 year olds. The ag would get to decide, but as Mike points out, well, what if, if I write an article that's critical of the California attorney general, which he does a lot, apparently then, then what happens? Is it,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:20:55):\n\nWhat if this law goes through effect in Texas and you write something critical of that? Exactly. In general.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:20:59):\n\nYeah.\n\nDan Moren (00:21:00):\n\nOr, I mean, a lot of times cases like this too, I feel like on dually target, you know, people in community like such of the LGBTQ communities too, right. Where it's like, well, what is considered objectionable content, right? This is the kind of thing we're running into with the book bannings that are popping up all across the country is that, you know, you have governments and local, like, you know, city and municipality governments that are like, well, I don't want my kid exposed to this. So I'm gonna, you know, try to enforce the local school library to get rid of these books, cuz I just don't agree with them. So who gets to decide, you know, certainly what falls under objectionable content and how exactly that gets protected. The\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:37):\n\nOther weird thing about this bill, it was primarily written by a British Barness director of one of the Bridget Jones movies who dropped her Hollywood career to protect children online. She says,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:21:51):\n\nAnytime I hear\n\nParis Martineau (00:21:52):\n\nThe words is not where I thought that sentence was going.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:54):\n\n<Laugh>\n\nDan Moren (00:21:55):\n\nSo what the weird\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:21:57):\n\nDirection time I hear United Kingdom and protect children, I wanna run the other direction. I knows all there's so bad at everything they do there there's been so many scandals and conflicts, the whole the Jimmy SEL thing with the BBC. I mean like large and small, I think the United Kingdom has done a terrible job protecting children from predators online and off when government in politics in entertainment. And you're like, okay, yeah, we really wanna follow their lead cuz they know what's they know what's right. Is this like Cory doctor has written so effectively about the failures of the UK. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:30):\n\nYou lived there for a long time. Is this a ignorance on the part of lawmakers? Like they, they meaning they wanna do the right thing and they, you know, they, they just don't understand the impact of what they're doing or is it some sort of malevolence? Certainly the Barness seems to have some sort of malevolence against the open internet. Do you think there is a trend? It feels like P politicians these days, it's not merely to protect the children. They want to take down big tech. They don't like it.\n\nParis Martineau (00:22:58):\n\nI mean, something that I think about a lot is as part of my job, all of our jobs, we end up watching these big tech hearings that we had every couple of months over the last couple of years. And as I remember the first couple that I watched, I was like, oh, this is gonna be interesting. You know, an actual, like political discussion about what's going on was not that it is mostly just politicians giving a, a one minute stump speech totally unhinged or unrelated to the thing they're actually discussing. And I think that's what we're seeing here in some ways is it is partially ignorance, but partially a lot of like modern day politicians have realized that the way to get attention from your base or the sort of people that you want to bring into your base is by making big, bold statements like bringing down tech, you know, making all the children safe regardless of whether or not that actually has any teeth in it. And it will, the end result of that is sometimes you get policies like this that can have disastrous unintended consequences.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:24:00):\n\nThere's a, there's both a care and a stick. There's the, the threat, the fear that a sound bite will be used against you. Oh, he's against protecting children online. But there's also the carrot that it makes a great sound bite that might get you some votes if you say. Yeah. She's she's really, she voted to protect the kids online. So <laugh> it's the problem is soundbites. It's just posturing. I think you're,\n\nDan Moren (00:24:26):\n\nI think a lot of the, there is ignorance at the base of it too, because I think it also presupposes this fallacy that there is somehow a switch in flip that will protect, you know, make it per the system perfectly functional in a way that protects children. Right? Like we entertain this idea that like, oh, well, technology can solve this issue for us. Right. And that we just, you know, technology is very black and white one in zero and it's like, well, you know, it can obviously tell you whether or not you're able to consume this information, but that's, you know, I think as point out, it's very difficult to know who is consuming these information. I think also about things like libraries that have, you know, computers available for people to access the internet who don't might otherwise not have, you know, ways to do that. How do you tell who's using that? Right? Like how do you tell who's on the other end of that? So I think it, people think tech is very clear cut when they don't know anything about it, but the, you know, anybody who spends time with it realizes like, no, this is extremely nuanced. And there's a lot of gray area.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:25:25):\n\nWell, the Springs me back to the whole, well, there's two things. One is the overarching issue is that I think we probably all agree. I won't speak for other people, but I think it's likely that we know that the big social media companies and other companies in most cases are failing to protect children online. They're doing things that are actively bad for children. They don't seem to have any compunction about it. And no one has an idea of precisely how to stop it, except through public disclosure, whistle blowing threats by legislators, but nothing. There's no compulsion. And particularly in countries with expansive free speech laws and commercial speech laws people feel impotent to solve that problem. So we know there are problems with Instagram used to promote eating disorders and, and they've made great strides in that. But you know, there, there's just all of this all of this negative content aimed at children algorithm fed often that has some kind of beneficial effect, but it also reminds me damn what you were just saying of when they kept talking about, I think it was the Clinton administration later, keep trying to bring this up.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:26:23):\n\nLike, well, what if we had a special key that only law enforcement could access only in very particular cases, otherwise the encryption would be perfect and protected. You know, when they were talking about end, end encryptions, like, well, there's no way to build an algorithm like that. And every encryption expert in the world agrees, but nobody on the political side wants to accept that they don't want accept the technological problem, that you can have a system with a key that only legitimate parties can use. Same thing here is how do you prevent harm to children, which is active and underway without also chilling speech? I was terrified for my children that grew up in this environment. And fortunately, I think we managed to avoid, you know, any significant problems, but I'm sure we all have stories or know, people have stories of children being you know, harassed online or singled out or groomed or so forth. It's just a, a massive problem made worse by many of these companies.\n\nDan Moren (00:27:13):\n\nAlso, people don't wanna hear that the, the hard solutions to this problem are all often ones that require like societal change and work, rather than just technology, which can solve it at the, you know, snap of your fingers. Right? Like people are like, oh, there's a shortcut. We just make the technology do that. Right. and yeah, nobody wants to think about the fact it's like, no, that's, that's a bandaid and it's not a particularly good one. It's a bandaid on a gushing, you know, the amputated arm or something. It's not gonna fix your problem.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:27:40):\n\nI also wonder if Barness Kidron, if, if she used to work in Hollywood, if Hollywood were told, oh no, no, you have to make sure that every movie you make is appropriate for somebody under 18 or every novelist had to make sure every novel was appropriate for somebody under 18. I think they would bridle at those kinds of restrictions as they should. We, we don't wanna design the world for people under 18.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:28:07):\n\nDon't forget to gore\n\nDan Moren (00:28:09):\n\n<Laugh>. Yeah. And yeah. Well, and I mean, what is appropriate mean in that case even, right. Like, you know, first of all, kids at different ages have different levels of maturity and different levels of appropriateness, a 13 year old and a 17 year old are gonna have very different levels of what they think is appropriate. I mean, I definitely went to, you know, rated R movies as a 17 year old and probably with my parents, you know, went to rated R movies younger if it was like a serious topic or something like that. But yeah. How do you, how do you deem what is appropriate?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:28:36):\n\nThe rate? You know, the ratings actually is a good system because all the ratings were designed to do is to inform you or parents ahead of time. Here's the content not to censor the content. So I'm not sure the rating, I think the ratings, I think, kind of worked I don't know. Would you wanna rate every website on the internet <laugh> and say this website rated R I don't know if that's appropriate either. Yeah. Yeah. Who\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:29:03):\n\nWould, who would do it? I mean, the motion picture, right. Association of America had a reason to do it. I mean, a lot of organizations, a lot of trade groups grew up specifically to address a preventing regulation from going into effect by voluntarily adhering to standards. That's right. And enforcing them the code and yeah, yeah. Right. And so who wants a law? But, but in this case, I think, you know, how do you protect children? Even from there's some very COE things like, how do you protect predators? There's, you know, I, I have this discussion a lot. It's not that there are so many predators in the world. I wanna believe that the number of people who are pedophiles and active predators against other people is a relatively small percentage of humanity. A very small percentage. I wanna\n\nLeo Laporte (00:29:46):\n\nBelieve that too. I'm not sure that that's the case, but I\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:29:48):\n\nWanna believe, I don't know either, but let's, let's pretend it's the case briefly, but say that the internet is an amplification force. So it doesn't matter if it's one in a hundred thousand people or one in a million is out after children. If they can access 10 million children and winnow it down and find one near them or that they can reach out to, it's a, it's a, a yield issue. And so online services need to impose their own protections that reduce that yield potential. And that's where I think things are failing is I don't think they have a motivation to do it. There's no financial benefit. There's no regulatory framework and they haven't yet suffered significantly from it. So when there's backlash, like there was a lot of backlash against Facebook for all the revelations from oh, I forgot the, the group in England.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:30:32):\n\nYes, thank right. So they had backlash, it seemed like it affected their market price. There was the threat of a lot of regulation that were open hearings. Right. But I don't think we've seen the same concerted effort that's gone into the sort of diffuse choices that have led to children being endangered. Occasionally something will leap up and Facebook will say, oh, okay, we're gonna disable all contents on or comments on videos uploaded by people under 18. Or didn't they just say, they're going to make all uploaded videos private by default on YouTube side\n\nLeo Laporte (00:31:03):\n\nFor yeah. If you're under 17. Yeah.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:31:04):\n\nRight. So these bandaids, but they do it only in response to the most outrageous stuff. So it's possible this law being passed, maybe it gets signed, it's held up instantly in the courts. Obviously you can imagine every giant tech company files for an injunction and it takes years to resolve conceivably. I also, by then\n\nLeo Laporte (00:31:22):\n\nMm-Hmm can imagine every, every state legislature, well, at least Texas, Florida and others saying, oh, good idea in passing a similar bill which makes it harder,\n\nParis Martineau (00:31:32):\n\nHarder, but with their own slant like specifications for what is good or bad for children. Right. You know, obviously given what we've seen in Texas that would probably include a lot of anti LGBTQ right. Sort of points as well as, you know, maybe content around women's rights to, you know, choose is also considered bad for children. I think it it's really tricky when you are handing over like content controls and censorship opportunities to these different state legislatures in such a vague way.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:32:11):\n\nThis brings up something. And you, you added this link to the rundown Glen. I, wasn't gonna talk about it, but I think it's appropriate to talk about it, which is the, the battle between cloud flare and Kiwi farms, which is a horrendous horrific website. I don't even wanna mention the name of, because it's really been used to docks people, to target people, to SWAT people by the way, both political persuasions, it's just a, a nasty, nasty site. Cloudflare was protecting it with their DDoS services. And, or as early, as recently, as a couple of days ago, Matthew Prince said, we are not gonna stop protecting him. That's what we do. We don't judge. We just protect these, you know, websites and everybody has a right to speak. They, he changed his mind, I think, under incredible pressure. But he says also because we see so many dangerous threats on Kiwi farms.\n\nParis Martineau (00:33:07):\n\nI mean, I believe right before CloudFlare ended up making the decision to end its relationship with the website. They, there had been posts on the forum about people being like, oh, we heard in this podcast that this TWiTtch streamer was maybe going to go to, I believe it was a poutine place. Oh, in Belfast. And they looked up yeah. Put a list of every Putin place. Lord in VE somebody had said, oh, I've planted bombs at three of them. And other ones, like I have men with guns waiting outside of one of them. It escalated dramatically.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:33:45):\n\nThis is a Canadian Tritch streamer, Clara. So any who actually fled to Ireland to be safe from Kiwi farms threats. And they just followed her right there.\n\nParis Martineau (00:33:56):\n\nI mean, cuz she, I believe had been swatted multiple times. Mm-Hmm <affirmative> she had been docks. Her whole family had been docks. It escalated beyond, I mean it had escalated and then escalated again and then escalated again. I also think it's interesting that, I mean, the way that CloudFlare came to this decision with regards to saying no, no, no, no. We're not going to sever this business relationship again and again, public statements. And then two days later deciding to do it after increased pressure is kind of the exact same way that this broke down. I believe with eight Chan Ann's sta Stormer that's right.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:34:33):\n\nWhenever they kicked, they resisted that last\n\nParis Martineau (00:34:36):\n\nCouple of years. Yeah. Then a couple of days later\n\nLeo Laporte (00:34:39):\n\nThey gave in, get it. I have, I sympathy for the the, and this is the reason I bring this up is this is kind of another facet of the same argument, which is how do you do this? Do you allow all speech and, and you know, let God sort it out. Do you prohibit, do you attempt to lock it down to protect everybody? Or is there some middle ground? And I don't know if any of those solutions work,\n\nDan Moren (00:35:07):\n\nThis, this is one of those places where I, I feel like I've got like a, like a pet peeve about people who pride censorship at a lot of these things because you know, people are like, oh, free speech everywhere. And you can have all the speech you want and doesn't matter, you know? And it's like, well, but these are businesses. This is not the, so like what we're talking about with this part,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:35:25):\n\nIt's not illegal for CloudFlare to block them or UN not block\n\nDan Moren (00:35:28):\n\nThem. Yeah. They can decide who they wanna do business with. Yeah. People used to, when I worked back in Mac world, you know, people would complain on our forums all the time. The censorship, when like threads got shut down or whatever, it's like, whatever, we're a, we're a business we get to choose only.\n\nParis Martineau (00:35:40):\n\nThis is citizenship. The government does it. This is my exact response with everybody complaining about losing their TWiTtter accounts. So I'm like, you're not being censored. That's\n\nDan Moren (00:35:48):\n\nA business. That's not, that's not what this is. Right. This that's capitalism people. That is what you signed before. That is the free market. You\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:35:56):\n\nNever see this with like, you know, we, we never see this with like CloudFlare standing up for this LGBTQ site that expresses extreme inclusiveness to an extent that bigots all over the world are so angry. They're demanding CloudFlare drop it. Even though the site is engaged in peaceful posting of articles about drag Queens reading at libraries and people getting married around the world and the increase in inclusive nontoxic environments. You're like, you don't see cloud fair flare out there because it's always violence. It's always the right wing. It's always, you know, fascism or flirting or way over the line. Although antisemitism, Kiwi\n\nParis Martineau (00:36:34):\n\nFarms was used to SWAT Marjorie Taylor green.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:36:37):\n\nYeah. I feel like equal opportunity\n\nParis Martineau (00:36:39):\n\nEmployers. I mean swotting anybody bad idea. Nailed it. I'll even, this is my one chance I'll come for Marjorie Taylor green. Yeah. Shouldn't be swatted. No one should be. No,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:36:48):\n\nIt's fascinating cuz it's all these people, you know, this is where you get back into the whole most terrorism seems to arise out of domestic terrorism. As in domestic in the house you find most of the people get involved in these kinds of efforts have trouble already. That's well known. They already, they already commit or are victims of domestic partner or familial violence. And so you keep seeing these things wri large. So it's like, they're they find the weakest target, which right now is trans people remain a vulnerable target worldwide. And they attack them because they feel like they will get the most support from even people who otherwise would be negative. But then, you know, it's always about violence. So they go after Marjorie Taylor green for who knows what reason totally unacceptable that they would do this, but are family at risk, whatever you think about or obviously but they don't have any discrimination. So you think, I always go back to that. Like they came for, you know, they, they come for one group first, but they're always gonna come for another, another, another. And you're always gonna be in one of those groups.\n\nDan Moren (00:37:44):\n\nIt's a means, that's the issue more than anything, right? It's not, it's how they're going about it. Right. I mean, I, I think about this too, when I see stuff in the politics realm where people are like, oh, if this happens, they'll be violence in the street. And again, to Glen's point, you never hear the people who are about inclusiveness diversity being like, ah, there'll be violence in the street if there's not inclusion in diversity. No, that's not how it works. So yeah. It's about the means of how you're going about. I have a, I have a friend who has actually been targeting by these kinds of people and it is truly horrific the kind of things that, that they have done, you know, in order to try and basically just shut these people up and harass them into silence, like, or for often for very little provocation at all, other than they just feel like doing it. So yeah. I, I don't know. I'm glad that CloudFlare flare make this decision. It's a shame. It took them so long and it's, you know, not gonna solve the problem, but it's a step in the right direction. The\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:38:35):\n\nThing I've seen said, which I think is, is worth repeating is that freedom of speech, freedom of expression is, can be suppressed by people who are also engaging in freedom of expression. So when CloudFlare says we are about, you know, Maxist free speech, we don't wanna suppress anybody because then governments come to us and tell us to take human rights groups off the internet, which to me seems like a spacious argument to begin with. There's a bright, light difference. You can make that decision. Yeah. Like if a group's advocating violence and dosing people and in involved in the coordination of harassment and abuse, that's quite different than a group saying this government's committing, you know, human rights violations. But the fact is these groups that are commit harassment are decreasing the amount of freedom of speech of other people. And I think there has to be a balance when you're dealing with extremists, you can say like people, some people are never going to like trans people.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:39:26):\n\nThey're never like the concept that Jewish people exist or whatever. And I, I mean, I wanna say I can live with that. I can't, I hope try to live with that, but it's like, I I accept that people may have bigoted ideas or terrible ideas that affect me and my family and my community, my country, whatever. I can accept that, but facilitating them to coordinate activities that are intended to suppress speech and harm lives. That is a very bright line. And I just, it suppresses my ability expresses everyone around me's ability to, to be able to have their own version of free speech\n\nDan Moren (00:40:01):\n\nTo Glen's point. I, when I was in college, one of the jobs I had was during in subsequent years after I was a freshman, I was in an orientation group where we taught incoming students about using all the tech systems at our school. Right. We said, here's how you use your email, whatever. And we went over free speech, hate speech and harassment. And this was in like 1999 in 2000. And we could, if I could teach hundreds of incoming freshmen, the difference, then, you know, we could figure this out.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:40:32):\n\nIt's it seems so difficult though, to know exactly where the line is drawn is that maybe is violence where the line is drawn.\n\nParis Martineau (00:40:43):\n\nCoordination violence is certainly one of the lines. Yeah. I think that it also, shouldn't be a terrible thing. If you have a group of people where they are actively coordinating to harass others, and you want to actively coordinate a group of people to say, Hey, business, that's making money from this group, protecting them. We think that's a bad business relationship. You should be allowed to do that. I think that's not a big deal. And if CloudFlare is deeply annoyed and frustrated by it, so be it, you are the one keeping this business relationship going.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:41:19):\n\nThe CEO was calling that bullying the fact that people who are under the gun being attacked docs, forced from their homes, people committing self harm that, that people standing up for them against Kiwi farms against Cloudflare's relationship was bullying. And that is bullying.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:35):\n\nI <laugh>. Yeah. Should lives of TikTok be banned. This is a big controversy on TWiTtter. Yes. Yes. Right now 1.3 million followers it is not actively inciting violence, although it paints L B GT Q teachers of being pedophiles and groomers.\n\nParis Martineau (00:41:57):\n\nI mean, I do think it's worth noting that libs of toss content and specific hyper focus on children's hospitals that also treat trans children resulted in seemingly resulted in bomb threats, being called\n\nDan Moren (00:42:15):\n\nTo children's hospitals incur with that, that that's Boston children's hospital right down the, the street for me, basically where I am. And yeah, that's, that's a big deal. That is a major hospital that does a lot of important work, including the kinds of things they're getting harassed for and to, you know, call in a bomb threat on a hospital. I'm you know,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:42:34):\n\nBut is, is TikTok clear integration? Libs of TikTok says we a hundred percent condemn any acts or threats of violence. They are not saying go bomb the hospitals, but\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:42:45):\n\nNo, but it's plausible that, you know, will nobody rid me of the troublesome priests is still an incitement to violence. Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:42:50):\n\nYeah, yeah. There you go. I mean, that's actually great. That's I have a reference there on that one. Fleshman sorry.\n\nParis Martineau (00:42:56):\n\nYeah. I haven't taken a close look at their tweets as like the only tweet I happened to see last night was I believe the I'm forgetting the woman's name behind the account, but she had tweeted, oh, I'm prepared for TWiTtter to suspend or block my account. And once they do, I'm gonna Sue TWiTtter and everybody there because they're censoring me and taking away my freedom to speech. And I'm like, that's not how any of this works, sweetie. Like you losing your TWiTtter account is not a first amendment violation. No,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:28):\n\nNo it's and TWiTtter has not, no TWiTtter has not banned them at this. As of no,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:43:31):\n\nThey suspended the, they\n\nParis Martineau (00:43:33):\n\nGot one slap on the wrist for one tweet, which like everybody else in the world, who's gotten one tweet flagged you delete it and you move on.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:40):\n\nRight?\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:43:41):\n\nLike Jordan Peterson,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:43):\n\nIt's a such a, yeah. It's a difficult thing to to know how to, how to do it. It is not de platforming somebody to kick him off of TWiTtter. I'm sorry. It's.\n\nParis Martineau (00:43:53):\n\nYeah. A brief aside, since you mentioned Jordan Peterson, though, I think one of the funniest things is if you look back overall, the different times that he's been suspended or something, and been like that said, I'm done with TWiTtter. This platform is terrible. And I refuse to acknowledge this next time. They try to suspend one of my tweets. I'm never gonna delete it. Come back. He says that. And then like every time 22 hours later, he's back, that man is addicted. You\n\nDan Moren (00:44:16):\n\nCannot stop.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:44:17):\n\nI gotta say the point of joy I have right now is watching Alex Jones being raped over the coals over and over and over again. And all of his garbage exposed and also the success and lack of success of so-called de platforming, right? So Alex Jones lost his access to a number of platforms. And yet he apparently continues to make tens of millions or, or more dollars a year from selling snake oil to people. But it's been, it's been great to see that grimy underbelly, like fully the rock picked up and exposed to understand exactly the ecosystem and what the value is to people spreading misinformation and hatred. This\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:51):\n\nStuff is so hard though. I mean, I can't really blame TWiTtter for trying to thread this needle. Mm-Hmm <affirmative>, I may disagree with what they've done in some cases and not in others. But it's a hard thing. It is a very hard thing to do. And it's hard to know what the, what the line is right or wrong.\n\nDan Moren (00:45:10):\n\nThey also put, they put themselves in that position though, right? I mean, they, they opened that can of worms by creating the product that they did. And if you, you know, to a certain degree, they're responsible for policing it in, in a responsible manner. Right. so on the other one hand, yeah, there is some trickiness to this, but it's, it's a problem that could be at least if not solved, addressed by prioritizing it. And it always feels like they kind of want to throw up their hands and be like, oh, well, you know, there's nothing we can do. Right. You know, we don't, we don't make the rules. You like,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:45:41):\n\nIt's the internet,\n\nDan Moren (00:45:43):\n\nThe rules,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:45:43):\n\nThe main character of the day problem at, at TWiTtter, which has, I think gone up and down at times is, you know, nobody wants to be the main character of the day. That's your job in life. If you, if you're participating in social media, don't do I know some people who have become the main character of the day, it's not very enjoyable to them ever. Occasionally it's positive, very\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:59):\n\nOn other side, on any side. Right.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:46:01):\n\nAny part of it, right. Yeah. And so TWiTtter has built a machine that creates main characters of the day, sometimes multiple ones. And the issue is a right wing accounts typically, but sources accounts that want to encourage harassment up to the point of violence and, and real harm, they have figured out how to leverage the TWiTtter main figure of the day algorithmic feed so that they can cause harm by fluttering butterfly wings. Right? So they can say something that isn't directly doesn't meet any kind of first amendment test, even of imminent harm. And doesn't meet TWiTtter's direct tests about incitement to violence or commitment of hatred of speech, but they, or hatred speech. But they they surface up these accounts like libs, oft TikTok surface up people who are absolutely innocuous and make them the, the 30, what is it? The five minute hate figure. What's it from 1984. And everybody in the world who is of that ilk gets that amplified out to them through the mechanism of TWiTtter and then other subsidiary mechanisms. And that person becomes a subject of this for no, there's no reason it should happen. It's a failure of the network that, that happens.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:47:11):\n\nI wanna take a break. When we come back, he used AI to win a fine arts competition. Was it cheating? This is gonna be a fun conversation. A great panel. You guys, I love this. This is gonna be a long one. I could tell, cuz I don't ever wanna stop. When we have people like Dan Moore here from six colors dot com Glen Fleischman, Glen F do glen.fun. I'm sorry, Glen F I can't, I don't, my F keeps broken. So I, I can only go to Glen dot UN. Could you\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:47:42):\n\n<Laugh> I'll register that to me\n\nLeo Laporte (00:47:45):\n\nWhen you place\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:47:45):\n\nOn Glen, I'll join the United nation. So I'm there.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:47:49):\n\nI, you know, it's just, it's fallen off and somebody who lost her slash and question Mark Key, but survived Paris Martin know reporter for the,\n\nParis Martineau (00:47:58):\n\nYou know, I learned to ask fewer questions and I think that's all right.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:01):\n\nAnd go to fewer websites. <Laugh> I should, yeah.\n\nParis Martineau (00:48:04):\n\nAll my websites are insecure now. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:07):\n\nRight? No, no. Slash slash our show today brought to you by podium. If you own a small business, it's, you know, congratulations, you're still, you're still running. It's been tough, tough few years from supply chain issues, increased demand. Business owners have to manage the businesses that are thriving right now are the ones who are forward thinking. And that's why I love podium PO I you know, there are a number of businesses in our area that use podium. And when I love it, I'll leave the, my dentist. And they as I'm leaving, I get a text message saying, you don't forget your appointment is coming up in six weeks or whatever. And or maybe would you like to leave a review on Yelp or you know, that kind of thing. Podium helps your small business stay ahead of the curve with modern messaging tools that make it easy for your customers to connect with your business.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:01):\n\nAnd we, this one thing we learned during the pandemic, no one wants to make a phone call texting. Is it a lot of people hate calling a business? I don't care if it's a plumber, a landscaper, I hate playing phone tag. If, if I could just send a quick tech text message and get a text message back, I know that's, that's the way to do it. Well, that's what podium does. If you're running a business. And the only way to get in touch with you is a phone number attached to an answering machine or a service. You you're probably losing customers. Podium gives businesses the tools to compete with the convenience that you know, big businesses have known about for a long time from healthcare providers to plumbers, over a hundred thousand businesses are texting with customers through podium. And, and by the way, not only do customers love it, you will love the results.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:47):\n\nOne car dealer sold a truck. It just four text messages that jeweler sold a ringing, coordinated curbside pickup, did it all through texts and the customers love it. A dentist had had a bunch of outstanding payments. He'd been sending a mail, you know, trying to, he sent out payment requests through text, got 70% of the outstanding collections in just two weeks because it works. I don't remember, but the open rate I think on text is well over 90%. It's the, it's the number one way to reach people because it's effective with podiums all in, in one inbox, your employees will love it, too. It all goes into the inbox and you could do more than just chat. You can get, get online reviews by sending an easy to use link. You can collect payments, send marketing campaigns. I get, and I'm ashamed to say it really works.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:50:34):\n\nI get our local ice cream parlor every few weeks. I'll get something saying, Hey, we haven't seen you in a while. How about 30% off a pint? And it works. Gosh, darn it. Every single time, all by a quick text, your employees can stay in touch with customers in one unified inbox. See how podium can grow your business. Watch a demo today. You'd just go to podium.com/TWiT P O D I U m.com/TWiT. If you're, if you wanna know more, you can learn the facts are there. And I think you probably, if you think about it already know, this is how your customers wanna do business. Why don't you do it that way too? Podium.Com/TWiT podium. Let's grow the ultimate text messaging platform. We thank him so much for supporting this week in tech. He <laugh>, I loved this story, but it's actually kind of a, a deeper question.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:51:26):\n\nHe won a fine arts competition, but wasn't cheating. This is a Colorado state fair digital digital category. The, the digitally manipulated photography category Jason Allen won beating 20 other artists, blue ribbon, $300 prize with an artwork he created through mid journey, which is one of the new generative art tools that are just taking off. Somebody said it's a CBRI explosion of AI art. And I think that may be maybe accurate. The portrait beautiful portrait looked like Renaissance art. Although if I, when I look at it, I can tell that that's, that's, that's AI generated. I mean, that's not, that's clear to me, but maybe the judges didn't have as much experience with this stuff. Is it fair to, I mean, he says, well, I wrote the prompt <laugh> and then he imported it in Photoshop and fixed it up a little bit. So\n\nParis Martineau (00:52:29):\n\nWhat category is it in? Was it in like painting?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:52:32):\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nParis Martineau (00:52:34):\n\nNormally they have a\n\nLeo Laporte (00:52:35):\n\nDigitally manipulated photography.\n\nParis Martineau (00:52:38):\n\nOkay. Then that's fair argue. I mean, that is exactly what it is. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:52:42):\n\nI mean, I was\n\nParis Martineau (00:52:43):\n\nSay, I think if you're talking about high art or experimental art using an AI to make a weird painting, that kind of looks like a computer made it, that is art in and of itself.\n\nDan Moren (00:52:58):\n\nIf the judges don't know and they still look at it as just a work itself and are like, yeah, that's great. We love that. If they didn't know it was AI, I don't know. It's hard to, I, I find it hard to ding them on that. Even as someone who, you know, writes creatively and feel like if an AI wrote a book and that book won a competition, I would\n\nLeo Laporte (00:53:15):\n\nBe\n\nDan Moren (00:53:16):\n\nA little miffed, but I also don't know that that would just probably make me a hypocrite that\n\nParis Martineau (00:53:20):\n\nLike, you gotta hand it to it. Like if someone being AI made a better book, like, well, yeah, nice for that.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:53:27):\n\nI I, I have a degree in art doesn't make me better informed on this, but I studied a lot of art history as part of that degree. And one of the courses looked to the concept of knoe, which is how art is evaluated for its quality, right? So both by like, you know, price, but also how do you evaluate pieces of art and say this is better or worse, or this is a master work and so forth. And I think that this actually gets into that, you know, very obstru little thing like knoe ship is that there are, you know, this whole thing about kit, right? Kit was a concept develop developed by Clint Greenberg. Like, I don't know, I think 80 years ago to describe art that was predigested you looked at it and it required no interpretation.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:54:12):\n\nHe was talking about Soviet art and other art that was super pedagogical and designed to just be the kind of, you know, puum to the masses you looked at it's like, this is the message, right? And that the opposite of kit is something that requires, you know, this interpretation, you look at it and there's a perception and it was, you know, Jackson, Pollock, and all the people doing abstract impressionism data isn't before it surrealism and then a pop art and later movements, they all rely on this impression that art is something beyond just looking at a thing and saying, that's a picture of a cake, right. So I'm sorry to get so deep into artistry stuff here, but it applies because you're like, on what basis do the judges evaluate, this are the components that they evaluated as being winning work ones where they were mistaken, things that they should have actually been looking at more carefully, or is it justified? Does this work actually because of the sources in which it derives and how the algorithm is recombined it, does it make it justifiably something that you can compare and use that kind of stewardship today? This is actually equivalent to other work of this Cal caliber\n\nLeo Laporte (00:55:16):\n\nOr is it just prettier?\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:55:18):\n\nIs it\n\nParis Martineau (00:55:19):\n\nPret? I will say we do need to see what the other art works, competing work. Cause maybe they all really suck. We're not considering that true. Two, if we're, if we're looking at this from an art history perspective, I think AI generated art would be a very futurist like piece. Like this is kind of what the early futurist movement like around impressionism was talking about, which is that, you know, art is not precious. Art can be fast. Art is like movement and technology. And if in this case, art is typing in a couple words in a screen that's art baby.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:55:56):\n\nI actually go beyond that. I think that the skill involved in typing the prompt, cuz it isn't usually just a few words it's usually elaborate and you often refine it is a form of computer programming. And I think maybe the future of computer programming as we interact with machines with AI you know, computer programming up to this point, you very specific, the computer's gonna gonna do exactly what you said no more, no less, but this is now the new, the new way of communicating with the computer. It's more of a conversation. I think that that's actually the new form of programming and think we're gonna see in a lot of areas\n\nDan Moren (00:56:38):\n\nTo me, I think the clearest syndication that it, you know, is a valid form of art is that every new medium or style is always greeted with that question. But is it art? Right? You know, look at the\n\nLeo Laporte (00:56:51):\n\nImpressionist. They were, they were refiled, right? They had to have their own art show just to get show people their work.\n\nDan Moren (00:56:57):\n\nIf people are asking that question, I think the answer is usually yes. And so, yeah. I mean, it's not what you expect.\n\nParis Martineau (00:57:04):\n\nThat's not our, whatever was just\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:57:06):\n\n<Laugh> everything else\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:07):\n\n<Laugh> here. Here\n\nDan Moren (00:57:08):\n\nIs I never wanted to\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:08):\n\nThe prompt, the prompt for it is a still of Donald Trump and Alex Jones in jail. Photograph natural light, sharp, detailed face magazine, press photos, Steve MCR. Oh my God. David Lizar cannon Nikon focus. These prompts. I mean, pick one. You like, can\n\nParis Martineau (00:57:21):\n\nWe can we put a Leo themed prompt in here? Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:24):\n\nIs that I did search for my name. This is the new, this is the new Google search. I'm sorry to say. Was\n\nParis Martineau (00:57:30):\n\nThat your first\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:30):\n\nSearch? Yeah, one of my first. So this is it's\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:57:33):\n\nLike Leonard Cohen in the upper left corner there.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:35):\n\nYeah. Well this is a search engine. This is a search engine. That search is stable. Diffusion stable diffusion is responsible for a lot of this Cambrian explosion over the last two weeks. It's an open source generator that's been made available to anybody. You can install it. If you have enough horsepower, big enough GPU and run it yourself. There's there are a lot of nuances to this story. A lot of facets, this story, one of the problems with stable diffusion, according to some is it uses a lot of images. We'll talk about this later that are not in the public domain as it's training material. And yet, because people can play with it. It's we've seen a lot of progress in the stuff we can generate. How about I'll just do Adam driver. How about that? Cause they're more of him\n\nParis Martineau (00:58:20):\n\nA a clear one to one for you. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:58:24):\n\nThan. Yeah. Me and Adam driver. So these, these are all images that include that. Now one thing stable diff fusion does is it will show\n\nParis Martineau (00:58:32):\n\nThere's some Nazi eye iconography. Yeah.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:58:34):\n\nI was gonna say there's some, this one,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:58:37):\n\nThis one is a portrait of John Oliver standing next to Adam driver's stoic, full body, military uniform. That's weird fantasy intricate.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:58:44):\n\nJohn Oliver did an excellent segment by the way. Recently on he did wearing a cabbage. He\n\nLeo Laporte (00:58:48):\n\nDid. And he married a cab was incredibly\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:58:50):\n\nIn fact\n\nLeo Laporte (00:58:50):\n\nIt was beautiful. Yeah. In fact, if I serve on Oliver, I'll find a lot more of his a and it looks like he really just\n\nDan Moren (00:58:57):\n\nAdded driver. Yeah. All\n\nLeo Laporte (00:58:59):\n\nThat's\n\nParis Martineau (00:59:00):\n\nI never thought about that, but\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:02):\n\nYes, John and Adam have a history I guess, but they do. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of John a\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:59:07):\n\nThat's right. They have that\n\nParis Martineau (00:59:09):\n\nAbout, oh, there's a lot of him, John Oliver covered in blood in a way that I would not have expected.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:59:14):\n\nWell, that came from he did a lot of searches, I think in prepara. Well, he was searching on people doing searches of him or, or a work about him. Yeah. And then found the one in which he buried a, a\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:25):\n\nCabbage highly recommend that watching that segment from the last Sunday. So this routine,\n\nParis Martineau (00:59:29):\n\nOh God, that one over the right is terrifying. This\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:32):\n\nOne <laugh> yes.\n\nParis Martineau (00:59:33):\n\nThat is my actual nightmare.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:35):\n\nThis is a facial portrait of John Oliver looking at the camera, laughing like a maniac colorful background lighting, like in the Blair witch pro project. His\n\nParis Martineau (00:59:43):\n\nTeeth look like corn.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:46):\n\nThey don't mention corn teeth joke. And John Oliver had a baby. Yeah. Yeah. I find's\n\nGlenn Fleishman (00:59:52):\n\nA classic. Oh, sorry. There's a classic sci-fi story. I wanna say it's by cm, corn booth, but I may be wrong in which a machine falls through from the future until like 1940s or fifties and a guy finds it and he discovers, it produces art. He gives it limited inputs and it produces beautiful work. And what he doesn't realize is he he's written in a language, his understand. And so he sends off, it looks like Swedish. So he sends off an instruction manual that came with it to get it translated as he is using it. He starts to make these contracts. He's getting gallery shows. It's all being produced by the machine and what he finds out. He gets the translation back and it's a form. The persons like this looks a little like Swedish, but he is been pressing the delete button all the time. So as the last image comes out is basically empty and it draws a circle. And I was like, was a perfect, it's a perfect story from 80 years ago or 70 years ago about this idea like automated art from the future, but then you hit the wrong button and you're, you're done. It's all over.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:00:47):\n\nOne senior research scientist at Google actually is sounding in alarm Negar, Roza as says, can't believe stable diffusion is out there for public use and that's considered, okay.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:01:02):\n\nWait, why\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:03):\n\nGoogle's been very careful. It has open AI to limit access to some of these engines. And apparently some scientists think let you've released the Cracken <laugh> if you, if you've released AI I, I think what's, I think what re is required for the development of a lot of these things is kind of this tight loop of interaction. And I think stable diffusion that's exactly what's happened. It's getting better and better and it's more and more intriguing. I just typed in bunny and I'm getting a lot of weird\n\nParis Martineau (01:01:42):\n\nThings. I was gonna say, that's a not safe for work search.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:46):\n\nFeel like. Yeah, well apparently portrait of Taylor swift as Lola bunny in space jam. Wow.\n\nParis Martineau (01:01:52):\n\n<Laugh> again, another sentence that I would not\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:55):\n\nExpected to that extra there's there's a lot more, oh yeah.\n\nParis Martineau (01:01:58):\n\nThere's a third arm.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:59):\n\nThere's a third arm. Yeah. You need a\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:02:01):\n\nThird arm.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:02):\n\nI,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:02:03):\n\nI mean, this is, we're talking about day one earlier, you know, I've always, I've, I've ridiculed Bezos using that because you know, they're not a startup anymore. They wanna pretend to be one and they're a multimillion dollar company. It's\n\nParis Martineau (01:02:12):\n\nTwo or day three at\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:13):\n\nAm. Joe Biden wearing 20 years.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:02:15):\n\nWe are day one for a lot of AI stuff. It's amazing how much utility we can get out of AI. And it's still not very good by many measures. Like, you know, if you can it's I mean, I think voice recognition has gotten pretty good, but it still has a long way to go. This is in the early days of being practical and it produces remarkable stuff that the bid journey stuff is, can be in incre the scifi or sorry hor horror author. Dan, what he called Chuck Wede.\n\nDan Moren (01:02:42):\n\nOh, he does weird, weird\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:02:43):\n\nMulti genre. He's really interesting guy. Great. Yeah. <Laugh> and very funny guy and I think interesting user of technology and he is constantly publishing sort of writing, probably his mid journey queries onto Instagram. You're like, it's so beautiful. Sometimes it's hard for me to believe this could be any kind of amalgamation that it's not directly from a source.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:06):\n\nHere's some not,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:03:07):\n\nNot that image though.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:08):\n\nThis is from the mid journey community showcase. So these are, and this is another thing you, you it's my mom always said, if all good bakers leave many cakes on the window sill, that, that, you know, if you're gonna, you throw out the bad ones, but if you're gonna show it in a community, so showcase it's a success. And I would say these are stunning. These images of\n\nParis Martineau (01:03:29):\n\nThe first, like 15, you scrolled through all looked like PlayStation five, like title characters\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:03:34):\n\nBasically.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:35):\n\n<Laugh> yeah, well I, maybe those prompts, but I mean, look at this, this looks like breathtaking Baro beauty, blonde, beauty, full head oval, Baroque frame, not bar. It's not bar that's, but you know, what's more,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:03:48):\n\nSomething's,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:48):\n\nIt's something here's a Crescent moon covered in vines and roses, art, new VO.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:03:53):\n\nI mean, if it can't get, if it ain't bar don't fix it <laugh>\n\nDan Moren (01:03:57):\n\nI knew you were gonna go there again.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:03:58):\n\nI just had to\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:00):\n\n<Laugh>\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:04:01):\n\nI think, yeah, I mean, you, if you, if you follow communities of cartoons and illustrators they're more freaked out than authors are. Maybe we were past being freaked out by it. I don't know about automation.\n\nDan Moren (01:04:10):\n\nYeah. I don't know. There's always something very tempting in this for me too, as somebody who has very little like visual arts skills whatsoever and has done some work with like, you know, stock photos, making some book covers for stuff. I'd self-published I mean, the idea that you could generate art, that would be not just a stock photo that you've sort of manipulated or worked with. Like, I don't know, it's it is an attractive option because I there's no way in a million years that I would get the skills and develop them and have time to like, sort of spend all the time at require to get to this point. Does it mean it's taking jobs away from like people I could be paying to do that? I don't know. That's an interesting question.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:04:47):\n\nQuestion is I think where it get complicated.\n\nParis Martineau (01:04:50):\n\nI was just saying, I think where it gets complicated is I've seen a lot of major media publications as of late come under fire for using like lead images and stories that are generated by mid journey or Dolly or something like that. When it's like, this is the sort of illustration that typically these publications are paying a couple dozen different freelance artists, any given week or month to create. I think the Atlantics Charlie Wark had recently gotten some hot water cause he had, he has a small budget for his newsletter. So he is already just using stock images, rather\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:25):\n\nThat's this image I'm showing\n\nParis Martineau (01:05:27):\n\nIllustrations, but he had used the most horrifying photo of Alex Jones in a newsstand generated, I think by mid journey. And it was <laugh>. I mean, people were quite upset about it.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:39):\n\nWere they upset because of the image or upset because it took the took bread outta the mouth of some illustrators somewhere.\n\nParis Martineau (01:05:45):\n\nI mean, I think that people seeing it without context saw it and they were like, oh, the Atlantic a publication that has a lot of money and typically is going to be paying and working with illustrators is using an artificial intelligence powered system to create their lead artist. Like if the Atlantic is doing it, what is stopping any other publication? I mean, I think this is a little bit of a different case cuz he had a follow up newsletter. We explained, I just run my small newsletter and of a very limited budget. But I do think that it begs some question when you're talking about larger publications,\n\nDan Moren (01:06:21):\n\nDoes it devalue? Does it devalue the work too, right? Cause if, you know, if you a freelance illustrator and you're like, well here's my rate. And they're like, well, we could just go to an AI and plug in a few words and get the, by the way, same thing for\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:33):\n\nThis, this is generated by mid journey and the caption says it by mid journey, Alex Jones inside an American office under fluorescent lights and it's but also I should point out mid journey retains the right to these images. If they're turning to NFT, it may get a cut <laugh>\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:06:51):\n\nYeah. NFT, the most popular thing. I, as a musician, I know told me the most horrifying thing horrifying phrase I've ever heard about creativity a few years ago. She said I'm competing against all music ever published now. And I think that might be what terrifies artists and rightly so as a writer, I'm slightly terrified. Because I don't, it's funny. I don't, it's not like it's easier to do art, but it's harder to get a Corpus to produce, say a news article or analysis of a contemporary thing or even a description of something. Because you have to have a deep Corpus, but with art, the Corpus is all art ever created. And so every time a, a rabbit appears in anything that could be fodder for an AI to use. So it's, it's really the sheer amount, right? It's the training set. So I don't think someone's gonna write an article about I don't think an AI could write a feasibly credible article now or in the next few years about an person entering an AI generated piece of art <laugh> in to a contest of winning.\n\nDan Moren (01:07:52):\n\nI don't know. I've seen some, they've had those. There were those ones. I can't remember what the library was, but what was the, there was a thing recently where it would generate a story. If you, in the same sort of way you could like tell, write a story in this way. I know because bar Powell, we Friedman did it like, oh, write a description of this podcast and, and it was, you know, surprisingly good again. And I think the biggest\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:08:12):\n\nFull length you write a feature that, oh\n\nDan Moren (01:08:14):\n\nYeah, I don't know. Not now maybe, but I wouldn't discount it for the future. And I think the biggest challenge with this is, is this argument this's gonna, the only this argument ultimately moot because it's like, well, the, the genie's outta the bottle. Like once it's out there, you can't stop it it's done. So\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:08:31):\n\nYeah, it comes down to right, like the source material, the training set to me becomes the issue. We were talking about that on this very podcast with Christina Warren and who, who couldn't talk about it. Cause she works for Microsoft and the co-pilot product some weeks ago, because that's the same thing as like who, if, if there are public, you know, this art isn't even public, right? Some of it is art that's copyright, but it was\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:56):\n\nSo Andy bio did a very interesting study. He this is waxy.org. He stable diff unlike Dolly too open AI does not release the training set. So we can't see where that came from because stable diffusion is open source. You know, where it came from, where the training set came from, he says, we indexed the 12 million images in a sample. By the way, there are many, many more images. They, you know, they didn't want to go through 2.3 billion images. So they took a subset 12 million images and they indexed them. By domain half, the images were sourced from only a hundred domains domains. And the largest number of images came from Pinterest 8.5% of the total dataset scraped from Pinterest. So completely disregarding you know, copywriter ownership fine art America, second biggest domain, which sells art prints and posters 244,000 from Shopify then wicks and Squarespace red bubble. So it's scraped images all over the net. Number one artist of the top 25 artists, the data set only three are still living Phil K Aaron Hansen and Steve Henderson, the most frequent artist. Who would you guess Thomas Kincaid? Of course then the, the, the planes of light trademark.\n\nDan Moren (01:10:24):\n\nWell, and it depends to a certain degree. Like how does this, I, I, you know, again, I don't know enough about the technology, this one to know how that works in terms of ingesting that material. I mean, one argues that if you are an artist you have gone and looked at a lot of art and you have that artist\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:38):\n\nYou've done the same\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:10:39):\n\nThing. Yeah. Good\n\nDan Moren (01:10:40):\n\nPoint. Right? Like, so, but you know, are you, as long as you're not storing those, if you're just sort of exposing the AI to that and it's deriving its own conclusions, I don't know. That seems legit to me, but maybe I'm not taking everything into consideration here. Yeah.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:10:55):\n\nIt's the same thing we're trying with copilot. Same thing with JavaScript. Yeah.\n\nParis Martineau (01:10:58):\n\nThis is why we should legally ban every artist who has a photographic memory from looking at any artist\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:11:04):\n\n<Laugh> right. Right. You know, this is a story Harrison Bergeron, right? The Kurt VK story about someone who is you know, the society in which everyone, everyone has to be equal, but they define equal by disabling people who are too good instead of raising up everybody to the same level. And so Harrison Bergon is the most beautiful, capable, intelligent agile person. And so he has to walk around wearing like 300 pounds of weights and disfiguring masks and so forth. And that, that is, it does get you to those fields where you're like, well, the AI should be blind. It must be blinded because you can see too much beauty\n\nParis Martineau (01:11:37):\n\nFor some reason when you described that, I thought, you know, someone would make a good point and you just club him in the knee. You know, <laugh> disable him immediately. <Laugh> like just chop off an arm. You were too smart in that meeting. Sorry. Gotta take down a peg.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:50):\n\nAndy did an interesting thing. He gave a prompt, same prompt to Dolly two and stable diffusion on the left realistic 3d rendering of Mickey mouse working on a vintage computer, doing his taxes. <Laugh> and you can see that the one on the left of Dolly two image doesn't know who Mickey mouse is. It's just a mouse. That's\n\nDan Moren (01:12:09):\n\nThe original Mickey mouse is like,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:11):\n\nYeah. Maybe that's what it used\n\nDan Moren (01:12:12):\n\nTo live. White tank top. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:14):\n\nYeah. Wife beat fit.\n\nDan Moren (01:12:16):\n\nThat's what he had on before, you know, when he goes off for the day, you know, when he goes through relax, that's what he,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:21):\n\nMickey mouse after hours. But yeah, but in stable\n\nDan Moren (01:12:25):\n\nOut there, it\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:26):\n\nKnows who Mickey mouse is, cuz it's trained on Mickey mouse. And so that,\n\nDan Moren (01:12:31):\n\nThat alone is gonna get them into trouble. Right. Because they're in Disney, I'm saying, Hey yeah, you gotta pay up for that. That's our, that's our property.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:37):\n\nYeah. It's it's so that does raise an issue. Then there's also the issue of AI generated pornography and a number of publications have started to point out there may be more of this appearing stable diffusion team bid a predict, built a predictor for adult material, assign every image and S <laugh>. This must have been a fun project. And N S FW probability score ranging from zero to one. So about 2.9% of the English language images were unsafe, but it's so, so there's DEC definitely a hardcore content.\n\nDan Moren (01:13:18):\n\nI know we've wrapped around back to that first story. Here's the solution to all that age verification, everything on the internet is produced by AI. It's tagged as to how unsafe it is and then you pull the content. There you go. Nice. There you go. Perfect. Yeah.\n\nParis Martineau (01:13:32):\n\nThe future, the internet doesn't have any idea about Mickey mouse and I think that's beautiful.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:13:37):\n\n<Laugh> I think, I think the future is a fax machine, which feeds into a shredder. That's my future. Oh, that's that's great. So it's AI, AI consuming content generated by AI. We don't need to be involved.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:13:49):\n\nYeah. We just take a, take a break, go to the beach, relax. Right?\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:13:52):\n\nLet them do their work.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:13:54):\n\nGood, good, good research from Andy bio and I'm not sure what it concludes. I, I, you know, there's a lot of copyright violation that's and there's certainly a lot of cribbing from existing art. I still think though, that this is it's interesting, cuz we've seen, it's been such a stop and start thing. AI there's, you know, been several AI winners already. We've seen how difficult it is to get cars, to drive safely, to get voice assistance, to answer intelligently. And yet I think in this one area, AI has made huge Amma, a huge amount of progress very quickly. Or is that just my imagination?\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:14:34):\n\nWe, we fill in details visually better. Right? We see things that aren't aren't there. And you know, if, if 10 words in a row are misspelled, we're gonna notice that. Or if the sentence doesn't make sense has to make logical sense. But we look at like the Mickey mouse, one on the right there it's, you know, Mickey's hand is two fingers and it's distorted and the keyboard doesn't have all the keys and that's okay. We don't notice that as much. You're like he's\n\nParis Martineau (01:14:56):\n\nDoing his taxes. I get it. He's\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:14:57):\n\nDoing his taxes. Yeah. It's a you're\n\nParis Martineau (01:14:59):\n\nMickey on the left. The Mickey on the left is using a external clickety cl keyboard on what looks like a typewriter there's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:09):\n\nMake\n\nParis Martineau (01:15:09):\n\nAny sense.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:15:10):\n\nYeah. It's great. Well, but\n\nParis Martineau (01:15:11):\n\nYet we're like the mouse is ripped and doing his taxes.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:14):\n\nIt's like, and that's actually hard Paris, your keyboard cuz it looks like it's missing the question mark.\n\nParis Martineau (01:15:18):\n\nThat's true. You know,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:15:20):\n\nJust, I\n\nParis Martineau (01:15:21):\n\nLike to serious mouse\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:15:22):\n\n<Laugh> I'd like to know if the rear end next to you is AI generator that appeared during the break. That's my\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:27):\n\nQuestion. Could be <laugh> could be, I don't\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:15:31):\n\nKnow. Suddenly I realized, I noticed all right. Yeah. Oh, that's the sequin. I understand. That's that piece of art.\n\nParis Martineau (01:15:36):\n\nThis is the sequin mannequin butt. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, I understand. Now I can't figure out which way to turn. Yes. I, you know, brought it.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:43):\n\nNo that's straight outta a stable diffusion. <Laugh>\n\nDan Moren (01:15:47):\n\nThe 2% of\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:15:49):\n\nThat prompt in now\n\nDan Moren (01:15:50):\n\nOn that. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:52):\n\nMade\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:15:52):\n\nThat 3d 3d printing plus AI plus 3d printing you'll type in sequin mannequin butt. And then it'll come outta your device and you'll have, you know, there\n\nParis Martineau (01:16:00):\n\nYou go. And you'll be like mannequin butt only as one butt cheek. But I get it.\n\nDan Moren (01:16:05):\n\nDo you remember with, there was this fear over nanotechnology of like gray go, everything we turn in gray go. Now I'm worried that we're gonna be a, was in 3d printed stuff generated by AI this little Casty <inaudible> everywhere that an AI has created\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:16:22):\n\nNow\n\nParis Martineau (01:16:22):\n\nAround it's like a mouse with six arms, but\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:16:25):\n\nYou know, like, like a lot of like robotics and AI stuff. And I don't know if this is, I sometimes feel like I'm way off base. And sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it as a trend is augmentation. Right? We have more people despite the pandemic, more people are now employed in America than there were before the pandemic we've recovered from that employment continues ever upward, even as American productivity, just to take, you know, us as an easy to find example, productivity continues on an unprecedented pace continuously for all American workers, blah, blah, blah. Right. We have so much robotics. Now we have AI engaged in a lot of aspects of daily life. You know? I think Dan, I think you use this Paris. You may as well, AI based transcription for interviews and things like that. At least as a first pass. If not the verbatim one, I love, I\n\nParis Martineau (01:17:06):\n\nUse this love Trent.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:17:08):\n\nYou love\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:17:09):\n\nYeah, I'm using Trent\n\nParis Martineau (01:17:11):\n\nTrent, Trent. He's a great fellow that just listens to all of my interviews and kind of mashes some buttons\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:17:16):\n\nReally helpful\n\nLeo Laporte (01:17:17):\n\nTrent, with an eye. Yes.\n\nParis Martineau (01:17:19):\n\nTrent Trent with an eye. It's a really good transcript.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:17:22):\n\nIt's not a, I need Trent.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:17:23):\n\nI thought you loved Trent. I didn't know. Listen,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:17:26):\n\nTrent AI O Otter is integrated with OT, another one integrated with zoom and it made a huge difference in my reporting. It would, it would sometimes take hours out of the work I was doing to have a searchable thing. So it was, this was substantial augmentation, my, you know, word rate or my hourly rate for articles, I wrote essentially went up by playing, paying a, a relatively low yearly fee to have this AI assistant. So augmentation, my question is, and I think a lot of artists are thinking about this now. People like web cartoonists and folks who do commercial art, the field had sh has shrunk. And it's a very complicated one already. So the question is, does this become an augmentation where they can use this as a tool, as a visualization tool? Is it something that helps them get to where they're going faster for commercial work or you know, as a writer, do I wind up there's another science picture story, which, you know, some writers like us or something they're typing away and you have to control the AI for moving too fast ahead of you, but it's a partnership and it allows someone to produce more work that's more accurate and more quickly, maybe less creative or you're providing the creative component.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:18:32):\n\nSo there is a future in which augmentation reduces less of the scut work and produces a, a better impact. But again, you know, we have so much, so much so many professions and fields have been roboticized or have had even tiny robots or other kinds of automation added in the last, you know, 50 years and yet employment. Right. We're not employing 50%, fewer people we're at all time, high employment, America history.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:56):\n\nYeah. In <laugh> there's too many jobs for too few people. So\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:19:00):\n\nMore robot hamburger flippers. Right. I\n\nLeo Laporte (01:19:04):\n\nThink you're, I think you nailed it though. I mean, honestly the best self-driving cars are not driving entirely on their own. They're not level four or five it's level two where a human it's human augmentation, and that's why it's a mistake to call it autopilot. But but that, those kinds of, you know, self-driving vehicles are great. They're not, self-driving the they're assist they're computer assist. And I think that works well. Do by the way, Trent is, do you, have you tried Otter, which is better Paris, you like to, I\n\nParis Martineau (01:19:35):\n\nHave been a Trent fan for many years. I find that Otter for me. I don't know. I know a lot of people who swear by Otter. I found that it doesn't often transcribe with the same level of accuracy. And most importantly, for me, I think that Trent that's T I N T not my friend Trent <laugh> Trent's editor, editing service is really perfect for the sort of things that I use transcription for. Yeah. But once you load up your transcription, you kind of have a timecoded like live transcription of it, that scrolls with the audio. And you can, whenever let's say, if there's a word that it got wrong, you go into edit and it pauses. And then once you're done editing it, restarts at the word right after. So I think it's like really good for the sort of workflow that I do, but, you know, I know a lot of people Otter,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:20:31):\n\nI should point out there's another reason I discovered Otter was for live captioning. And I should point out this is an incredible area in which it was almost impossible to get. And now is widely available is you needed live people typing to do real time transcription of conversations. Now there are a billion conversations a day that can be transcribed or, or sorry, could have live caption, Google Skype,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:52):\n\nBuilt it in Google, an amazing job with Android 12 and 13\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:20:55):\n\nAnd Skype is incredible apples adding it and iOS yeah, apples. So, and that, that is a, I mean, so 99.9, nine, 9% of all phone conversations, video conferences and, and whatever do not have live captions. And now you have the potential. And I suspect it is a more than 10% number where people enable that. And that is, oh my God, the amount of cognitive energy that saves and the improvement in conversations. So not like I wanna be a, a, like AI only has positive impacts, but I'm like my wife has hearing issues. She can't drive at night. Like I see always, I look at AI and improvements in all these kinds of automations and robotics as tools for people, you know, directly near me where it's gonna improve captions, already improve her life. And augmentation that would allow like night vision or other tools it'll have to be full, automated driving could allow her to drive at night again safely.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:21:49):\n\nYeah. Dolly two has announced a new feature called out painting, which is kind of another way of taking a human generated product and then applying. So I'll show you the time lapse God for mirrors, the girl with the Pearl earring Dolly two is painting the room, the girls in. And it's, I mean, it's not obviously probably not the real room, but it's pretty credible. Oh, it's weird. <Laugh> so weird. Did\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:22:21):\n\nYou see the example of someone? She was she's a fashion designer and technologist, and she created a video by combining out painting and like two or three other tools to, to create seamless images. And it just shows her like walking down the street and her outfit is changing into AI, generated alternatives as she walks and it's\n\nParis Martineau (01:22:40):\n\nTogether. I see that video. It's\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:22:42):\n\nPhenomenal. I remember. Yeah. And it, she cobbled together a bunch of stuff.\n\nDan Moren (01:22:45):\n\nThat Verre thing though. I mean, it really makes the girl with the pro earring look like a bit of a slob that like\n\nLeo Laporte (01:22:50):\n\n<Laugh>, that's not very tidy. What is going on there? Yeah. Was\n\nParis Martineau (01:22:54):\n\nLike, do you need that many lemons on your shelf? Like fridge?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:22:59):\n\nI dunno. Yeah. <laugh>\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:23:03):\n\nWith a clutter problem.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:04):\n\nMaybe, maybe, maybe AI has a problem. Maybe AI is a hoarder. Oh my God. I mean,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:23:09):\n\nYeah. That's amazing. Yeah. Weird. How many lemons do you need? AI,\n\nDan Moren (01:23:13):\n\nTEAC cups up on that top shelf there. What is, what is happening? <Laugh> perspective issues too. With where those see you're right. Many shelves are angle.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:20):\n\nSo now, so now I'm realizing,\n\nParis Martineau (01:23:21):\n\nIt's like, man, if you, you got so many Amazon packages there in the bottom, right. You gotta really take the recycling out.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:27):\n\n<Laugh> now I'm realizing that you were right. Glen Fleischman, that we are filling in the details that make it feel better than it really is. If you look closely\n\nDan Moren (01:23:37):\n\nIt's for me by way of empty Esher.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:39):\n\nYeah. It's kind of awful. It's\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:23:40):\n\nKind of cool though.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:41):\n\nYeah. It's kind of cool. Kind awful. That's that's the, that's basically\n\nParis Martineau (01:23:44):\n\nThe that's kinda ice\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:46):\n\nSpy and what's this thing hanging here. What is this? Is that I we're just,\n\nDan Moren (01:23:49):\n\nThat's a light pole, right? It's a light.\n\nParis Martineau (01:23:51):\n\nThat's a boom mic.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:52):\n\nIt looks like a mouse hanging by its tail. I\n\nDan Moren (01:23:55):\n\nDon't premier edited out. It was a goof. And that's why premier <laugh>,\n\nParis Martineau (01:23:59):\n\nIt's actually under the goof section of IMDB, you know, that's right. You see it in the frame. What\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:04):\n\nIf AI is\n\nDan Moren (01:24:05):\n\nLike ver painted this? Would we say, oh, what a beautiful painting. This is art. I dunno. That is fascinating.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:11):\n\nYou, oh my God. I\n\nParis Martineau (01:24:12):\n\nDunno. I feel like it was long enough ago. Like this is kind of impressive, cuz it just like, man, you survived. You didn't get enough. You didn't die of illness in the time 16 to paint this, this\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:24:23):\n\nTook 16 years to paint. I hope you got a good price for yeah. Yeah. It's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:28):\n\nIt's it's oh\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:24:29):\n\nMan. That's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:29):\n\nGreat. Do you think AI might be slightly psychotic? Like\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:24:33):\n\nIt's not conscious. So who knows?\n\nDan Moren (01:24:36):\n\nHesitate to give a clinical diagnosis? Cause\n\nParis Martineau (01:24:38):\n\nYeah, I don't know. We're not armchair. We don't wanna armchair of psychologist. AI here. Fair.\n\nDan Moren (01:24:43):\n\nFair enough. All Georgia now. And see if she'll\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:45):\n\nHere's an interesting application. Oh,\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:24:48):\n\nAI therapy. That's gonna be a growth industry.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:50):\n\nAI. I think\n\nDan Moren (01:24:51):\n\nWe started with that Glen. That was where\n\nParis Martineau (01:24:53):\n\nEliza came from. Yeah, that was literally Eliza we're full circle.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:24:57):\n\nOh my no, no. But therapists for the AI not therapists for all\n\nLeo Laporte (01:25:01):\n\nThe AI needs.\n\nParis Martineau (01:25:02):\n\nYeah. The AI is gonna be scrolling through TikTok and it's gonna tell the AI what ADHD and have gotta get stimulants right now.\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:25:10):\n\nGeorgia Dow therapist to AI. That's good. Your\n\nLeo Laporte (01:25:13):\n\nHere is I think a very good use of AI storybooks.ai. They want to take all of the Gutenberg project, public domain text and illustrate it with AI. It's\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:25:26):\n\nA fascinating\n\nLeo Laporte (01:25:27):\n\nIdea. Is that an interesting idea?\n\nGlenn Fleishman (01:25:29):\n\nIt's problematic in an entirely different way. Although what's weird is the original drawings of many of these works have exist. Like many of these works were illustrated and they're not in copyright either. So, but it's, it's an interesting exploration.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:25"
