        "text": "This Week In Tech is a podcast network founded by Leo Laporte in 2005. You can find all of our shows at https://twit.tv. This community is a place where listeners and hosts can continue the conversations begun on our shows.\n\nThere are several categories: TWiT Shows, TWiT Hosts. Feedback, Talk Amongst Yourselves, etc. When you create a new topic please try to put it in the appropriate category and sub-category to make it easy for others to find. You can also use tags to help.\n\nUnlike other forums you may have used, the software we’re using (Discourse) is designed to be fairly flat. That means when you reply to any post in a topic your reply gets stuck on at the end - there’s no reply threading. I’d guess that’s to discourage side conversations. According to the devs it’s a feature not a bug.\n\nYou can use search to find a particular show (by name or number), topic, or tag. General show discussions will be tagged with show, specific episode posts will be tagged with episode.\n\nAll are welcome! We hope you’ll visit often! – Leo\n\nAnd @MikeInCA, I’m glad Leo and TWiT have chosen to build this themselves. For one, Reddit is already monetized, with ads and “gold,” and none of those ads benefit the communities built there around subreddits. I’d elaborate on my own experience building a medium-ish size community on Reddit, but I feel like I share too much already.\n\nAlso, building a community on Reddit is really selective for people who “get” and appreciate reddit culture. That’s probably not a filter Leo and TWiT wants to put on their audience and community."
