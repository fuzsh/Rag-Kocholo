        "text": "Iâve been listening to TWiT for nearly 7 years now and I find myself always going to them for whatâs up in tech.\n\nInstead of filling their heads with every single detail and spewing them all over you they address the tech news in a conversational, casual approach that no matter of your tech literacy you can still sit back and listen or watch and walk away knowing something new without being drowned in all the minutiae.\n\nA lot of people seem to think journalism is about getting all the tech specs and comparing them to other comparable products, that is not journalism and I hesitate to call it a product review. What TWiT offers instead is an overview of the goings on with retrospective, reflective and speculative conversation between well-respected journalists from all over the tech space.\n\nLeo himself doesntâ profess to be an expert in any one thing and the criticism he gets I find is unfair, he seems to be the only one bringing together techheads from across the industry and offering the listeners and viewers, for free, their opinions.\n\nPersonally, I look forward to eventually hopping over from the UK to taking a trip up to the studio and meeting the crew, if things were different Iâd of loved to work there."
