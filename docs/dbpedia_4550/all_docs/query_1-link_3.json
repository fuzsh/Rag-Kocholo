        "text": "On February 16, 2020, Leo wrapped up This Week in Tech episode 758 by sharing names of audience members. That day, the audience consisted of Matt from the Lucasfilm ranch, Arun from Dallas, Matt and Brian from Mountain View, John and Mari from Stockton, and Mike who was apparently still celebrating Christmas. Leo invited people to join the studio audience, but little did anyone know, that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, those seven fans would be the last live in-studio audience for over four years. Since then, it's an understatement to say that a lot has changed.\n\nOn April 18, 2021, TWiT launched Club TWiT. To help celebrate entering Club TWiT's fourth year and TWiT's twentieth year, we're re-opening our live studio audience for two very special episodes of This Week in Tech with Leo Laporte on April 7th and April 21st.\n\nThere are only fourteen seats available for each show and they are limited to active Club TWiT members (and a companion). If you would like to reserve a seat, visit tickets.twit.tv and reserve your seats today!"
