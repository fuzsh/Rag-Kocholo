And we love them so much that we enjoy interacting with them daily.\n\nOur Club TWiT has allowed members and the TWiT family to delve into a massive range of topics on our discord channel. One of these topics is focused on books! If our show This Week In Google hasn’t been on your radar, Stacey Higginbotham and Ant Pruitt mention it from time to time, but Discord is truly where it’s at.\n\nThe Book Club is mainly geared toward Science Fiction from authors who are BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and who aren’t always in the mainstream eye. Ant and Stacey post a vote after each book to determine the next read, and you are welcome to throw in some recommendations as well."
