Therefore landing pages/offer codes do not work because why would anyone use one when it's the same as the client's offer?\n\nOur audience is privacy/security-focused, does not want to be tracked, and may use a VPN when visiting our sponsors.\n\nBased on our annual survey reaching over 10K fans - 20% forget to visit a landing page or use an offer code.\n\nTherefore we recommend using ad tech on our network, and we offer Podsights - please listen to episode 4 for a full explanation of how it works, which will provide additional attribution. We also clarify that you must wait eight weeks after every ad is dropped to reach its fullest impact. Podcast ads take time because you need to wait for fans to download the episode, listen to it, possibly see it elsewhere, and then act. It can take 8-15 touchpoints to motivate fans to convert.\n\nIf you are interested in advertising with us, please email advertise@twit.tv, and we will get back to you ASAP. Thank you for listening, and have a great day."
