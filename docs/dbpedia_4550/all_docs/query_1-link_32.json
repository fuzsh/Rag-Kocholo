        "text": "Big thanks to RedTech News for featuring our infographic on broadcast-to-podcast (and the inverse) in its 2023 Solutioneers issue! ‚ÄúTechnology is a solutions-driven endeavor, and the people behind it love few things more than breaking problem barriers,‚Äù explain the editors of this annual special edition. We obviously couldn‚Äôt agree more. In this case, the issue is that both #broadcasters and #podcasters need easier ways to repurpose their content for other channels. If they can do it successfully, they stand to gain a much larger audience, with many different kinds of listeners, for their content. See the feature, and other great ‚Äúsolutioneers‚Äù helping to evolve the audio space, here üëâ https://lnkd.in/g7kBvU6y #audiosimplified #BadAaaS #podcasting #broadcasting #digitalaudio #radio #infographic\n\nWanna know how Clicks Technology came to be? Curious about the Apple #VisionPro experience? What's the OnePlus #OnePlus12R all about? Listen to Michael Fisher, Kevin Michaluk, and Frank McShan on episode 361 of my #MobTechCast for answers, and more :)\n\nHad a good (and light) chat with Andrea Azureene Heng and Susan Ng at #AsiaFirst of #cna938 about the surge in micro-dramas in China through the short video platforms such as #douyin (China's #tiktok) and #wechat channels. Many production houses have poured tens of millions into the production of such mini series (which often feature one free (1-5 minute) episode, and subsequent paying episodes). Millions of food delivery riders are, interestingly, the earliest adopters - they have a lot of fragmented time and they are constantly on the phone. What to do in-between orders? Nonetheless, whether this turns into a serious business (and media consumption pattern for all of us) really depends on how top artists, production talent, and brands' advertising dollars invest themselves into the fray. #shortvideo #mediaconsumption #netflix #streaming #live WeiHan Chen Sabrina Chong Yorlin Ng\n\nPicking up new podcasting gear and the plan is to get the goosed.ie podcast up and running again so I have 2 questions 1) What tech based Irish startups should I be interviewing? 2) What topics would people like covered by myself and Marty Meany All suggestions welcome in the comments.\n\nWhen you look at a smartphone, TV, or any device with a display, do you see just a screen or do you think about the intricate details behind it, like our display tech expert Oliver Haupt? The next episode of our new podcast dives into the fascinating world of display technology, revealing secrets behind every pixel and camera hole! üì± Listen to the full conversation on your favorite audio-streaming platform or watch it on YouTube! üéß #Displays #DisplayManufacturing #TechTalk #DisplayTechnology #BehindTheScreens\n\nThis distopic Apple TV+ series ‚ÄúFor All Mankind‚Äù shows us an alternative ‚Äúpresent‚Äù due to another winner of the space race to the üåï. So things have been moving faster and they are in ‚Äúour present‚Äù but the year is 1994. Watch this curious scene where ‚Äúbig decisions‚Äù are taken jointly with their employees.
