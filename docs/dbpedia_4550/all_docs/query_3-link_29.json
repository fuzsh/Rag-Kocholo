See the full list of our Recommended Podcast Apps and RSS links below.\n\nHow to Subscribe\n\nGo to your podcast app\n\nSearch for the TWiT show you'd like to subscribe to: This Week in Tech, MacBreak Weekly, Security Now, This Week in Space, etc.\n\nClick on the \"subscribe\" or \"follow\" button\n\nRecommended Podcast Apps (in alphabetical order)\n\nRSS Feeds\n\nWe provide industry standard playlist files, called \"RSS Feeds\", for all of our podcasts. These RSS feed URLs, offering either audio or video subscriptions, can be copied and pasted into any podcatcher. You can find a full list of our current shows and their RSS feeds on our Subscribe page. Most of our feeds allow you to access the ten most recent episodes. (For older episodes, you can find them on the TWiT.tv website.)\n\nAudio or Video?\n\nWe produce multiple feeds for each of our podcasts. The available feeds depend on the app. (Many apps only support audio podcast feeds.)"
