        "text": "What Our TWiT Advertising Partners Are Saying\n\nWe have worked with more than fifty agencies and hundreds of direct advertising partners, including household brands such as Audible and Ford, all of whom believe we're among the best podcast advertising platforms. These points are best articulated by our partners themselves:\n\nUndoubtedly, our partners love working with us because we know our audience and how to get results. We care deeply about your brand goals and will do what it takes to help you grow. We often have longevity with sponsors who buy our premium podcast ads because each one is fresh, effective, and delivered by trusted hosts.\n\nTWiT Audience Stats\n\nWhy TWiT.tv? - TWiT's Host-Read Ads Stand Out\n\nSponsoring TWiT's innovative podcasts puts your brand in front of an affluent, highly-engaged, tech-savvy audience with one-click purchasing power. TWiT only partners with sponsors who have products/services that will benefit their audience.\n\nTWiT's podcasts are in audio/video formats, except for new shows, allowing for product or service demos.\n\n88% of listeners made a purchase based on a TWiT host-read ad\n\n99% listen to most or the entire podcast\n\n88% are involved in their company's tech/IT decision-making process\n\nTWiT believes in delivering powerful host-read ads that properly introduce a sponsor's products/services to its audience. Overdelivery on downloads is guaranteed as all ads are embedded. Sponsorship promotion appears on TWiT's sponsor page, show episode page, and RSS feed. If advertising minimum is met, newsletter and social media promotion is included, and courtesy commercials on video shows can be provided with every ad read.\n\nTWiT Sample Ad Reads\n\nSee more of TWiT's tech podcasts...\n\nAre you ready to grow your business?\n\nReach out today to start your powerful campaign with TWiT.tv and have your products/services promoted by its expert hosts.\n\nAdvertise on Podcasts | Podcast Advertising and Streaming Ads\n\nAcross a number of weekly podcasts, the TWiT Network of podcasts attracts a yearly audience of 25 million downloads, but it isn't just the far-reaching abundance of listeners that makes TWiT one of a handful of premier podcast advertising companies in the tech world. It's the fact that we've spent more than a decade establishing a solid relationship with all of them.\n\nThe result is a podcast ad network that is uniquely valuable, one that not only drives tangible results for our advertising partners but also serves as a unified platform for engaged and loyal listeners who place their trust in our hosts, shows, and service/product recommendations.\n\nTWiT Network Podcasts: What We Produce and Who Listens\n\nCollectively, TWiT.tv is a podcast advertising network that is as vast as it is targeted, with shows catering to audiences ranging from tech professionals to enthusiastic newbies, all of whom want to stay updated with the latest news, product releases, and expert analysis.\n\nWith that being said, descriptions of a handful of our most popular podcasts are as follows:\n\nThis Week in Tech: Roundtable discussions of popular tech news and trends\n\nSecurity Now: Hosts cover topics in consumer and enterprise digital security\n\nMacBreak Weekly: A rundown of the most recent Apple news and reviews\n\nWindows Weekly: A weekly overview of all things Microsoft\n\nThis Week in Google: Roundtable discussions of social media giants, Amazon and Google\n\nTech News Weekly: Detailed breakdowns of the week’s biggest stories by top tech journalists\n\nBelieve it or not, that's only a glimpse of what we offer — Tech news is a never-ceasing realm, after all — but with so much content to choose from, you may wonder who listens to all of our tech talk. Our audience is made up of the following demographics:\n\nTech/IT decision-makers: 88%\n\nTech professionals: 76% (50% management or higher)\n\nCollege graduates earning at least $100k+ annually: 73%+ (28% earn over $200k)\n\nListeners who stay tuned into most (if not all) of the podcasts they start: 99%\n\nAltogether, our podcast listeners are some of the most loyal in the industry, with many being lifelong learners committed to knowing all there is to know about a wide range of tech topics. They are educated, affluent, tech-savvy, and in a position to buy when presented with a solution to their needs. (In fact, 88% of them will buy something simply because of the host-read ads on our shows.)\n\nCan You Grow Your Business with TWiT?\n\nAs a sponsor of one of our podcasts, you'll have the opportunity to get your brand in front of a highly-engaged, tech-savvy audience with one-click purchasing power. Still, you may question whether your brand will benefit from buying podcast ads with us. Consider the following:\n\nYou Have a Product/Service that Would Benefit a Tech-Savvy, Affluent Audience\n\nThe TWiT Network serves as the stage for tech-related podcasts, each with a faction of loyal listeners that love discovering the latest technology and learning new ways to solve old problems. From VPNs that address consumer privacy concerns to better internet service or mobile phone plans, our audience always wants to upgrade their tech.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of our listeners are college graduates that make at least six figures — over a quarter of our audience even makes over $200,000 per year — and with more than 25 million downloads each year, you’ll have access to an extensive audience full of qualified leads.\n\nSuffice it to say, if you have a proven product/service that can enhance their health, wealth, or productivity, our listeners will want to know about it.\n\nYou Have an Enterprise Solution that Will Benefit Business Owners or IT/Security Pros\n\nToday's businesses face several unique tech challenges, from protecting sensitive data from malicious actors to creating unified work experiences for an entirely remote workforce.\n\nIf your product or service works to solve these pressing issues, the TWiT.tv platform is perfect for your streaming ads. Most of our listeners are tech professionals, and over half are at the management level, which means reaching decision-makers with B2B podcast advertising has never been easier.\n\nThe Benefits of Advertising on TWiT\n\nTWiT is the gold standard in podcast networks, but don't just take our word for it. Here are six reasons why our partners consider ours among the best podcasts for advertising:\n\nHighly Qualified Audience: We are a trusted source for a large audience of educated and engaged professionals with serious influence and buying power\n\nSelective Partnerships: We only work with brands and products we believe in\n\nVaried Video Formats: Properly create visual product demonstrations and courtesy podcast commercials that you can include on your website and landing pages\n\nHost-Read Ads: These allow audiences to hear directly from trusted hosts and are embedded in the content, giving the advertiser far more downloads\n\nMultiple Touches: Your sponsorship promotion appears in multiple places, including TWiT's sponsorship page as well as the show's episode page and RSS feed description\n\nOne of the greatest benefits our advertising partners continually mention is our full suite of services which is offered to direct sponsors. We see our sponsors as partners in our network and want to do everything we can to help them grow. We have been in the business of ad-supported podcasting since 2005, meaning we not only fully understand podcast advertising best practices but our audiences as well.\n\nOur full-service Continuity team will help direct partners properly implement ad campaigns and fine tune the copy of your podcast ads so they resonate with our listeners while showing them how your product/service will ultimately benefit them. If advertising minimum is met, we offer newsletter and social media promotions for direct partners to increase the number of audience interactions, as well as Spotify Ad Analytics reporting for attribution tracking and insights.\n\nStart Your Campaign with the TWiT Network Today\n\nGrowing your business is a matter of getting in front of the right audience. If you want to reach an affluent, tech-savvy community of decision-makers eager for products and services that can meet their needs and help them grow, you’ve come to the right place."
