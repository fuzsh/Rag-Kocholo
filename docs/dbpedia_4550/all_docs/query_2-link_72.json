It found that $237 million gift was fraudulent.\n\nStudents say they're glad the independent investigation is over, and everyone can focus on the semester that's approaching soon.\n\nWatch the video above to hear from FAMU students after independent investigation into \"Major Gift\" concludes.\n\nBROADCAST TRANSCRIPT\n\nA lack of trust...just one of the factors that led Florida A&M University into the national spotlight for a major gift that turned out to be fraudulent.\n\nI'm Terry Gilliam your SW Tallahassee Neighborhood reporter.\n\nIn addition to finding out what's in this release, I'm also getting the initial reaction from FAMU students.\n\n\"When I saw it on Instagram, I was already kind of skeptical looking at it.\"\n\nThat Instagram post FAMU student, Malik Patrick is talking about was the Major Gift given to Florida A&M University during its May commencement.\n\nA gift that was a stock donation, supposedly valued at $237 million.\n\nBut Monday, FAMU got the results of an independent investigation. It found that $237 million gift was fraudulent.\n\n\"My initial reaction, I wasn't shocked; I was like this is nothing new.\"\n\nA full report released Tuesday morning breaks down what happened.\n\nIt highlights four driving factors that led to the situation.\n\nThey include:\n\nLeadership involvement and influence from both then-President Larry Robinson and FAMU VP for University Advancement and Executive Director of the FAMU Foundation, Dr. Shawnta Friday-Stroud.\n\nThe involvement of only a small group of individuals aware of the Donor and the Major Gift.\n\nThe urgency to announce the Major Gift at a commencement ceremony\n\nAnd the Lack of Due Diligence and Understanding of Private Stock.\n\nI asked students like Patrick and others what that money could've done if it was legit.\n\n\"We could have more parking lots; we could get more housing cause that's another issue.\"\n\nBut other Rattler students like, Dorien Paris, are just glad the investigation is over, and everyone can move on.\n\n\"School is about to start, it's enough pressure as it is. Everybody just needs to get their focus on what really matters and that's academic prowess and moving toward in our careers.\"\n\nParis also says.\n\n\"It was just a mistake; we can bounce back from it.\"\n\nI reached out to the University Tuesday afternoon.\n\nWe were unable to have sit down interviews.\n\nFAMU Board of Trustees Chair Kristen Harper, did put out a statement.\n\nIt says in part quote.\n\n\"Trustees will discuss the report, including its detailed findings and recommendations, during a Board meeting on Thursday, August 8. We will not be speaking about the next steps, individually or collectively, prior to that meeting.\"\n\nFor now, students say they're glad the independent investigation is over, and everyone can focus on the semester that's approaching soon.\n\n\"We all came to get an education at the end of the day.\"\n\nTwo changes were recommended to FAMU leadership given the results of this investigation.\n\nFirst modifying FAMU Foundation Policies and Guidelines.\n\nSecond, adding clear language to FAMU Regulation, Chapter detailing the President's responsibility to the board of trustees. In Southwest Tallahassee, Terry Gilliam, ABC27."
