This was based on the Global 1st stage, where we focused on expanding our global coverage mainly into the US and EMEA regions.\n\nIn line with the previous Mid-term Management Plan (FY2019 - FY2021), we strived to improve profitability of our operations outside Japan and accelerate digital initiatives further to reach the Global 3rd Stage in 2025, aiming for global and quality growth with unchanging beliefs and the courage to change.\n\nUnder the slogan of \"Realizing a Sustainable Future,\" our new Mid-term Management Plan formulated in 2022 aims to create new value toward realizing a sustainable society by further enhancing our power to \"create\" and power to \"connect,\" and by combining these two strengths.\n\nPower to \"create\": our capability to create systems with in-depth client understanding and advanced technologies.\n\nPower to \"connect\": our capability to support diverse corporate systems and industry infrastructures.\n\nGlobal Strategy Period\n\n“From Strengthening Alliance to Expanding Overseas Business”\n\nTo further grow our business in a globalized and rapidly changing world, it was time for us to establish a new NTT DATA Group as a “Global IT Innovator”.\n\nWith this new vision, the company strengthened alliances within Japan through cooperation with client’s IT departments.\n\nOur strategy has been evolved from focusing on IT support for Japanese companies to developing a long-term strategy targeted at the world’s largest markets: North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. At the same time, we have developed global business by aggressively expanding overseas business and developing technology abroad through M&A.\n\nTransformation and Challenge Period\n\n“Establishment of NTT DATA Communications Systems Corporation”\n\nSpinning off from NTT, NTT DATA Communication Systems Corporation was established in 1988.\n\nWe became the largest information and communication service company in Japan.\n\nIn order to become a “value creator who generates energy from information,” we started our operation in the field of “Information Technology.”\n\nWe created new markets by developing systems in different fields such as public, financial and industrial, and then further expanded.\n\nNTT DATA was the first company in Japan to introduce technologies such as Smart cards and virtual shopping malls. This is how we started to build the foundation of the “convenience” and “security” that we have today."
