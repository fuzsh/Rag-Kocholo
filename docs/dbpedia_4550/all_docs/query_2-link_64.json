Scott Wilkinson, Sony's just announced its new TVs and you won't believe what they did.\n\n0:00:10 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd I am Mikah Sargent and we answer a question about what you do if you've got a lot of HDMI cables and you're trying to figure out which are old and which are new.\n\n0:00:18 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd then we'll figure out what happens. If you can't run Safari to fix Safari on your Mac. It's all coming up. Next, on Ask the Tech Guys.\n\n0:00:30 - Caller\n\nPodcasts you love. From people you trust. This. Is TWiT.\n\n0:00:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis is Ask the Tech Guys with Mikah Sargent and Leo Laporte, episode 2023 for Sunday, may 5th 2024 Choco Tacos for cinco de mayo. Well, hey, hey, hey, how are you today? It's time for Ask The Tech Guys. It's indeed time, Mikah Sargent. The handsome one is Mikah Sargent and leo laporte, you're the one who can, the fat one, you can say it.\n\n0:01:04 - Mikah Sargent\n\nLook at you, so you, your leg, you see how your knee and your uh foot are parallel. Yeah, I, I don't have that flexibility in my hips. You can't do this, I can't do that directly this is.\n\n0:01:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nI remember reading an Ian Fleming James Bond novel.\n\n0:01:20 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThis is how englishman sits well, I like sitting like that, but my knee doesn't go quite down as far as your stars. You have to. I'm very impressed with your. I can't bring, I don't have any. Your hip flexors are very flexible.\n\n0:01:32 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's not that they can't go any other way. Inflexible. Hello, this is the show where you answer your computer questions Somehow 888-724-2884. For now, 888-724-2884.\n\n0:01:45 - Mikah Sargent\n\nFor some reason that sounded weird, but it was correct. I know, isn't it? Yeah, weird 888-724. That's what it was 724. It was weird, cadence. I said it wrong. No, no, it was correct, it was just strange. That's the phone number that you could call during the show. If you do call that phone number, you will have the opportunity to be brought up on stage. When you do, there's a little key word that you need not keyword keys that you need to hit. It's star six, asterisk six. That will let you unmute yourself for the call. There are other ways you can get in touch with us. You can also email us, atg at TWiTtv with video audio text and we will answer those questions. Or you can also pull up on your phone or your computer a low url call, a low all your l-i-l.\n\nUh, apostrophe, uh, it is. That is not the url. The url is callTWiTchtv. When you go there, yes, you'll be brought to a zoom room.\n\n0:02:42 - Leo Laporte\n\nA zoom room, and very important I like how he talks funny when he does that. It's so funny.\n\n0:02:47 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYou'll need to look at the bottom of your screen. Yes, for a little hand, yes, and you want to press that hand to let us know that you actually have a question. So those are the ways you can get in touch Interesting. Please do get in touch and tell us about how you work on your hip flexors, so I can make them a little bit better.\n\n0:03:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nI'm happy to say that if you ever thought you might want to use Arc, the browser that is now available for Windows users. Do you even know what I'm talking about? Yeah, oh you do.\n\n0:03:21 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOf course I use Arc. Oh, you do. Yeah, it's great on the Mac.\n\n0:03:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, and it's starting to get, uh, better and better on windows. I like it for us because it has kind of a frameless view, which I really like, so you don't see any of the browser cruft just a page. And these days, honestly, uh, I think most websites are really kind of designed not to be kind of stand-alone like an app. Almost like an app exactly Right, just an app that you don't ever mess with. Sites are super powerful these days. Well, that's one way to put it. They're super powerful, yeah so that's cool.\n\n0:03:59 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI know people were excited, those of us who've been having the browser company's Arc browser for some time on the Mac.\n\n0:04:04 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's a really nice browser.\n\n0:04:05 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's based on chrome yeah, it is a chromium base. Uh, it is. It's a different take, I think, on a browser and I like the kind of different profile system that it has. That was one that got me into it early on. I always end up just going back to safari because I'm a creature of habit. But arc is super cool and I do feel like if I, if I would just sit with it for more than a week, I would probably stick to it. I just I ended up, you know, going back to my, my regular haunts.\n\n0:04:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nHonestly, on windows I don't think you really get the full. Oh really, it's not quite the same. You know why it's written in a language that is was originally designed for apple swift. Oh, it is open source, so in theory you could develop in swift for other platforms, but I am not convinced it works.\n\n0:04:53 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat's well, that's not not not ideal.\n\n0:04:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nI guess that's why it took a while to get over to windows it is, and it's probably why it will never appear on lin, but I like it. That's all I can say. I'm just saying that. If you wanted it, you could try it. The browser company, Arccom or Net, I can't remember.\n\n0:05:14 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOne of them, try one of them.\n\n0:05:17 - Leo Laporte\n\nOne of the reasons I was thinking about this is because I read a very funny Australian blog from Takehi called the Heat Death of the Internet Came out last month. You want to order from a local restaurant but you need to download a third-party delivery app. Even though you plan to pick it up yourself, the prices and menu on the app are different from what you saw in the window. When you download a second app, the prices are different again. You ring the restaurant directly. It says the number is no longer in service. You go to the restaurant. You order in person. You mention hey, your website has the wrong number. The woman behind the counter says yeah, we have to contact the company, design the site for changes. It's going to cost them, but since most people order in the app anyway, who cares? You want to watch the trailer for an upcoming movie on YouTube, but first you have to sit through an ad, then you sit through a preview for the trailer itself, then you watch the trailer, which is literally another ad. When it ends it queues up a new trailer with a new ad at the start of it.\n\nThe first page of Google results are links to pages that have scraped other pages for information from other pages that have been scraped for information. All the sources seem to link back to one another. There's no origin, the photos on the page look weird, the hands are disfigured. I wonder why there's no image credit, and on and on and on. I think this guy kind of nailed it. Yeah, the internet. What's wrong, folks? It's gone downhill, it's all cruft. A billionaire got mad, bought your favorite social media site, ran it into the ground. A different billionaire got mad. Bought the magazine site you like to read on your lunch break. Shut it down quickly. A third billionaire did what they do best bought the app you use for networking and sold it off for parts.\n\nAnyway, on and on, it's a grumpy old man blog post, shouting at the clouds, but with a lot of accuracy frankly well, and one of the reasons I brought this up is, for the first time ever on TWiT Last Sunday, every panelist Well, there were three of them, so me, amy Webb and Kevin Rose. But we all agreed Google's starting to suck and the Internet's kind of go and maybe Google's reflecting. That was the thought. Well, maybe it's not Google's fault, maybe he's just reflecting what's out there, what's going on kids.\n\n0:07:24 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, I don't. I don't like searching via Google these days. It's so full of nonsense and then scrolling through and it sort of separates it into these strange pages with these little side scrollers in between. I just want my normal Google back.\n\n0:07:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nI want my Google back. And then they banned TikTok. Apple had a bad quarter.\n\n0:07:52 - Caller\n\nWhat is? A bad quarter for Apple.\n\n0:07:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nThose are words you're not going to hear out of my mouth. Well, okay, so this is how Tim Cook put it, which is a little tell. Today, apple is reporting revenue of $90.8 billion Revenue. That's good for the March quarter, that's three months. $30 billion a month, and this is where he gave it away the tell An all-time revenue record in services. In services, yeah, you know, apple doesn't have many bad quarters. They didn't lose money. Their revenue was down 4% Earnings. Let me see what they were down. All they said was record earnings in services.\n\nDuring the quarter, we were thrilled to launch Apple Vision Pro and show the world the potential of spatial computing unlocks. The world went okay, call me when it's done. Thanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, our active base of devices has reached an all-time high. Yeah, because if you sold one more device than you had previously, that would be an all-time high. That's the problem. These are all fudge words, weasel words.\n\nApple did announce, though, $110 billion share purchase program. Now let me tell you why Apple stockholders love this. Because it makes the number of shares in public go down. They bought them back, so, in effect, your piece of the pie got bigger. Smaller because it makes the number of shares in public go down. They bought them back. So in effect, your piece of the pie got bigger. Smaller number of pieces means your piece got bigger. Good news for Apple shareholders. But it's $110 billion.\n\nApple did not put into growing their business, inventing new stuff, hiring more employees. It really has one purpose only, which is to buoy up the stock, the stock price, and of course that's important for Apple for employee retention. I don't think it's a good thing for the way. It used to be illegal, you know, to do stock repurchases Really. Yeah, cash dividend of a quarter per share, that's good. That's an increase of 4%, you know. I mean, given our confidence in apple's future, says luca mestri, apple cfo, our boy, has authorized 110 billion dollars for share repurchases. That is, that is all. And and the stock dividend. All is an attempt to keep the stock high. I wonder how the stock did. Actually, I didn't check. I don't care about stock. That's not the point to me. The stock high. I wonder how the stock did. Actually, I didn't check. I don't care about stock. That's not the point To me. The point is is the company doing well?\n\nNow, one of the reasons Apple had a very good quarter for services is that Google is giving them and this comes under services a lot of money. We found out thanks to the ongoing antitrust lawsuit which closed, by the way, this week, which wrapped up with final arguments. The Department of Justice suing Alphabet came out and Discovery Alphabet. Last year I'm sorry, two years ago, 2022 paid Apple we thought it was 11 billion, maybe 13, 20 billion dollars to keep using or to make the default search on the safari on the iphone. Google, google, that's more than a bit. That's a more, almost two billion a month. A how much is it worth? And b what are you afraid of? Google competition, what are you afraid of? If google's so great, such a great search engine, why do you have to pay apple 20 billion dollars a year to default to google and what would they default to? By the way, what's the choice? Ping?\n\n0:11:33 - Mikah Sargent\n\nyeah, I guess, I don't know I well, and we've seen uh in the eu, where it is now presented to you which default search engine you choose. Yeah, that's interesting. That there is an increase for a number of other search engines. Oh really, yeah, I think it was DuckDuckGo specifically who called it out, that they saw quite a jump.\n\n0:11:54 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, they would, because they're one of the search engines.\n\n0:11:56 - Mikah Sargent\n\nRight, they're one of the search engines and they're one of the smaller ones, so seeing any jump was quite a bit Right.\n\n0:12:04 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, that's the news. I'm sorry, it's grim news. It's like everything's terrible. There was one good bit of news.\n\n0:12:10 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh good, what it was that finally we can hear Universal Music Group on TikTok, again TikTok and Universal Just in the nick of time UMG. You did it. They got over their tiff and have come to an agreement so that TikTok users can once again attach music to their, to their ticks. I don't know what do they call their talks? What do they call them Posts, posts, yeah.\n\n0:12:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo there's a couple of theories about why this is. One is TikTok finally gave them enough money, right, yeah, ok, uh. Tiktok finally gave them enough money, right, yeah, okay, uh. The other is that universal music group said whoa, the sales of our albums and artists has plummeted without the plugs they're getting on tiktok, maybe it's worth it to come back to the table, and we, I don't know, maybe someday we'll know, somebody will do some research and give us some information as to why they finally signed a deal. They really acted like no, no, we're never.\n\nyeah, it did seem like it was like that's it, it's over and honestly it could be if tiktok. I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to tiktok, but I don't think it's going to be the dominant force it was, do you?\n\n0:13:19 - Mikah Sargent\n\nknow, I well, I think that who's going to buy them? It needs yeah, that's what's going to say it. It needs yeah, that's what I was going to say it needs to. This this time, right now, needs to exist long enough for people to really feel that panic and move off of the platform. And when that fully happens, then yeah it's not going to be.\n\n0:13:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, we saw it with my space. When I'm, when the, when the mice, the rats desert the sinking ship, they go or they make a decision, they go all at once. You know, my space just cratered. So I don't know, I, I, I bite dance, says we're going to, we're going to go to court. If we can get the law of return, we will, but if we can't, then we're closing where that's by and that might just be political. You know, jockeying, I don't know.\n\n0:14:02 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, and I was reading that piece that you linked to from the Washington Post talking about the group behind the TikTok ban. That's kind of interesting, that's. Yeah, I don't know if we have time to go into all of that, but I think that that's something that people should check out. It's called the tech billionaires who helped ban TikTok want to write AI rules for Trump, and it talks about Jacob Helberg, who at one point was not very well known but is now kind of shaking hands with the top brass in Washington and was instrumental in creating the law that was signed by President Biden, calling for the forced sale of, because he really cares deeply about our privacy and security of our national conversation and wants to make sure the Chinese government does not propagandize our youth Right.\n\nNo, I don't think that's what it's about.\n\n0:14:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think it has a little more to do with the fact that Instagram from Meta and YouTube's shorts are direct copies of TikTok and would be the immediate benefit yeah, the benefit beneficiaries of TikTok demise, because everybody would just say, okay, fine, we'll move to Instagram Reels. That's what my son did. He's a TikTok influencer. He just moved to Instagram.\n\n0:15:14 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWhich both happen to be based in the US. Yeah, and when you've got a nationalistic viewpoint, then it's more than that.\n\n0:15:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nMeta and Google, both pour lots of money into Congress. Yeah, and I really think that what Heidelberg is is is actually a lobbyist, and he is lobbying for Meta and Google and American big tech, saying you know, get these, get these Chinese interlopers out of here. We would like to take over. I don't know, you know, will will it be as good as TikTok? Probably not. Does it matter? Probably not. Probably not Right, sadly, yeah, all right.\n\n0:15:51 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAll right, let's do something We've got 20 minutes before we have Scott Wilkinson on.\n\n0:15:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nExciting Home theater geek we call him. He will be doing his thing. Whatever that thing is, it's your thing, do what you want to do. But meanwhile I think this would be a good time for me to talk about our fine sponsor, stamps.com.

Hey, phone caller tell us your first name and your first name and where you're calling from. I was looking at that. Oh wow, name and your first name and where you're calling from. What are you looking?\n\n0:19:46 - Mikah Sargent\n\nat I was looking at that.\n\n0:19:47 - Caller\n\nBob in Haines, Alaska.\n\n0:19:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh wow, in Haines, alaska. Wow, what's your first name? Rob? Yes, hi, rob Bob. Oh, bob, bob. What can we do for you today?\n\n0:20:00 - Caller\n\nWell, I blame Windows too.\n\n0:20:04 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh man, yeah, you know, that's why we started late. Windows had decided to update on my laptop. And you know how long that can be.\n\n0:20:13 - Caller\n\nYeah Well, I've been using Linux for the last couple of years partly because of that.\n\n0:20:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nI have to say Linux has gotten to the point where it really is, I think, very similar to Windows. Yeah, it's a learning curve, but in terms of functionality it's absolutely great. Okay, yes, go ahead. I'm sorry enough of the ad. What's your question?\n\n0:20:33 - Caller\n\nI actually think the functionality is better. I mean, there's a lot of things that you can do on Linux that you could never do on Windows. I agree, so I actually prefer it. I'm with you. I got a question for you, Especially now that we've got 4G service. Here in Haines they upgraded last summer from 3G to 4G cellular service. Wow Went from 500 kilobits, 1 megabit service up to 30 or 40 megabits. That's a big improvement. That's nice. I use. It's an amazing improvement. Yes, I use unlimited full-speed hotspots that I get with an AT&T business plan for my internet service For your business.\n\nI well, I have a business, but I use it mostly for personal, Okay.\n\n0:21:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe won't tell AT&T okay, actually, they don't care, you're paying more, they don't care, you're paying for it, you get it, that's true.\n\n0:21:29 - Caller\n\nBut it's also cost less than what it would cost, for fiber. Fiber is $80 a month here, wow, and they want $3,000 to install it. Whoa Well, I have to run 300 feet of conduit. That's the cost. Yeah, yeah, well, I have to run 300 feet of conduit. That's the cost. Yeah, yeah, I have been told, because I use Hotspot, that I cannot have a Wi-Fi network. I use the Hotspot, obviously going to the computer, but I cannot, for example, use Chromecast. I at one time, a couple of years ago or last year year, was able to figure out a way to use a wireless printer and scanner, but now, for some reason, I I changed something and it no longer works. So can I have a wifi hotspot? Can I have a wifi network with a hotspot?\n\n0:22:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou can, but you can't use. It sounds like it's an AT&T limitation, so you're using their hotspot device.\n\n0:22:28 - Caller\n\nNo, I'm using my cell phone.\n\n0:22:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, you're using your cell phone. Ah, there's the problem. There's the problem. Yeah, if you were able to get a router, so they make 4G routers, that then can become a Wi-Fi hotspot. It's basically two radios in one device one, the cellular radio, sent and received to the cell network, and, sitting next to it, a Wi-Fi transceiver sending and receiving Wi-Fi, but doing that from your phone, because your phone is in effect doing that.\n\n0:23:03 - Caller\n\nWell, let me ask you this question phone, because your phone is this question. I was told by geek squad um that if I had a, a second device of a, that gear ac 750 that's right. That's what I was, just oh range I could, because it has a separate ssid that I could use that as my Wi-Fi network and hook it up to the hotspot off of my cell phone. Is that correct?\n\n0:23:34 - Mikah Sargent\n\nInteresting, I guess because it's a range extender. It is specifically looking for a Wi-Fi network to extend, so it would in theory. I'm trying to figure out why they said range extender specifically.\n\n0:23:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo because you don't want a router, right, because the phone's gonna. Phone's gonna do that. But is it? No, it's not that's exactly what the phone doesn't do is route so with the rain?\n\nyeah, I don't know if range extender would route yeah, you actually, they're close, but what you want is a router because, uh, the phone is not going to do any routing, that's why you can't have Wi-Fi. The phone says, yeah, I'll connect you to the Internet, this one thing. But I'm not going to be a router and it may be a limitation on AT&T although I think you can trick.\n\nAt&t probably, but AT&T almost always. These cell companies say and by the way, one device please. They will sell though I know AT&T will and most other carriers will sell a device that would let you do this, which is basically a 4G device that is then a Wi-Fi router.\n\n0:24:42 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI think that's the better option, because here's the thing even if you were able to trick the system into letting you do that for a while, there's going to come a time where they're going to catch on and they're going to stop and then set, and so doing it the legitimate way, uh, by just getting one of the wi-fi router hotspot deals from.\n\n0:25:05 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt might be what the Geek Squad was thinking, burke or Burke says is that the range extender connects to your phone and then it still only has one IP address, but then that connects to a Wi-Fi router. No, that's not going to work. I don't think that's a way to do it. I think you want a home internet gateway, Do they? T-mobile and Verizon sell these right now. At&t has not yet joined this, but fray, but soon will. T-mobile started it. And what these are? They're separate accounts. They're internet accounts that then connect to the LTE. They may not want you to, because it sounds like, living in the beautiful great Northwest, they may not have enough bandwidth up there to have a lot of people using a lot of bandwidth. Oh look, at&t has just started selling it. Look at that. At&t Internet Wireless Home Internet. At&t Internet Home Wireless Home Internet. At&t Internet Wireless Home Internet Seems like that's a lot of internet.\n\n0:26:13 - Caller\n\nAnyway, they do offer it now. Yeah, I actually looked into that. The problem with that is having two cell phone bills.\n\n0:26:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, it's going to cost you.\n\n0:26:21 - Caller\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\n0:26:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, so you want to share your cell phone?\n\n0:26:31 - Caller\n\nI mean I can already get you know, I can get 10 devices on the hotspot. But the problem is, I guess that's a hotspot network, not a wi-fi network, kind of like you said right, oh, that's nice.\n\n0:26:42 - Leo Laporte\n\nthey let you have 10, so they let you have 10 devices. So they let you have 10 devices. Yeah, but what you want to do? Things like Chromecast, which really want to look for a Wi-Fi signal, so Chromecast.\n\n0:26:52 - Caller\n\nRight Chromecast and also, more important than that is, use a wireless printer or scanner. Right, it tells me I have to turn the hotspot off in order to do that, which then I don't have any internet.\n\n0:27:04 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's interesting. Who tells you that? The printer or the phone? The phone, yeah. They don't want you to do that, that's why. So the AT&T internet air, which is the same thing as Verizon and T-Mobile sell now, is 35 bucks a month. That's more than you want to spend.\n\n0:27:27 - Caller\n\nWell, I didn't know it was that cheap. Uh, well, I could probably do that. Yeah, because I mean the you know, like I said, it's a little over 100 a month for for fiber and that's only 10 megabits per second.\n\n0:27:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnyway, and then you can turn the hot spotting off on your phone, which you're probably paying extra for.\n\n0:27:41 - Caller\n\nI would guess. Well. Well, I'm paying 79 a month for unlimited full-speed hotspots.\n\n0:27:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nBut look on the bill because it's not unlimited hotspotting. Usually you have unlimited phone. There are some grandfather didn't play.\n\n0:28:00 - Caller\n\nNo, it's unlimited full-speed hotspot. Unlimited full-speed, you know what? That's a pretty good deal, yeah.\n\n0:28:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, that's why I donpot Unlimited full-speed. You know what? That's a pretty good deal, yeah.\n\n0:28:07 - Caller\n\nYeah, yeah. That's why I don't want to get rid of it.\n\n0:28:09 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, it's a toughie.\n\n0:28:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe other thing you could use is a travel router, and a travel router is designed. It's basically got two Wi-Fis in it. It's designed to get on the hotel Wi-Fi. In this case the hotel would be your hotspot, the hotel Wi-Fi, and then become a Wi-Fi router for all the devices in your house. So I think that's what you want is what's called a travel router. Netgear makes them, a lot of companies make them, and you can see why it would work Because it's designed to take a single internet connection and turn that into Wi-Fi, and so most routers don't have two Wi-Fis. They have Ethernet and a Wi-Fi, but you can't get Ethernet out of your phone easily. I don't think so. I think a travel router is what you want. The Netgear is quite good. There's quite a few companies that make these. I think that's probably the best way to go. Let me see if the Discord is showing one from Beryl.\n\nI'm not familiar with this. Oh, you know what I like about this? It's from GL-iNet. Thank you, serial Barber. What I like about this is it uses open wrt, which is a very nice open source. Um wi-fi software barrel. Oh, isn't this cute? It's wi-fi six, two. So now it's not. You know you're gonna have to buy something. It's probably not that cheap, but the idea is it'll get on your hotspot. Anything you buy, make sure they have a return policy Because, remember, at&t does not want you to do this, so they're going to try to detect anything like this that you're doing. But what's nice?\n\n0:29:58 - Caller\n\nabout it. Why would AT&T not like that? Because the only thing I would be doing is wirelessly hooking a computer up to a printer Because they want you to buy their residential home internet.\n\n0:30:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's why, oh okay, they're also concerned and I understand this about bandwidth use. It's one thing if one device is on their 4G network using that bandwidth, it's another thing if 5, 10, 20, 30 devices are on there.\n\n0:30:23 - Caller\n\nThey're really concerned about that. They already allow me 10. Yeah, 30 devices are on there. They're really concerned about that.\n\n0:30:25 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey already allow me 10. Yeah, but yeah, yeah, yeah, that's interesting, I don't know. Let me just see what this, what this? Let's see. Travel router, the barrel. There are other companies. Oh yeah, it's expensive. It's 129 bucks. Oh no, wait a minute, here's a. Why is this one? Yeah, no, this is 79. I'm sorry, this is the travel router. It's pocket sized, but make sure you get and there's one that's 69, so make sure you get one that's returnable, so that if it doesn't work and like I said, now it looks like, oh, they even wait a. Here's one for $40. That'd be fine. Well, that's a regular router. Get it on the website gl-inet and look at all the different things they offer. I think you want a travel router.\n\n0:31:18 - Caller\n\nIf you have a few minutes. I got another question about a Google phone.\n\n0:31:21 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSure, we've got three minutes.\n\n0:31:26 - Caller\n\nI know today Scott wants to start as close to noon as possible. Okay, it's a Motorola Edge Plus 2023. Ever since I bought it, I can say okay, gee, and I had to say it four times before it would respond. Now, in the last six months or so, I can say it 30, 40, 50 times and it doesn't respond. In order to get it to start responding again, I either have to retrain it or reboot the phone, and then it'll work for maybe an hour or so and then it goes back to. You know, taking many, many, many, many times for it to respond. It sounds like it's getting busy. I talked to somebody at Google.\n\n0:32:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, what'd they say?\n\n0:32:03 - Caller\n\nBusy, busy, it sounds like it's doing other things and Motorola didn't have the answer.\n\n0:32:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nRemember, when you restart it, you're killing all the background processes. I wonder if something else is going on. That it is listening to the mic, Remember it has to listen to the microphone.\n\n0:32:19 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAlso did they suggest a device restore, not just a reset. Maybe that'll do it. Yeah, did anyone suggest a device?\n\n0:32:26 - Caller\n\nrestore. I completely wiped, I completely did a. I think that's what I did. I completely wiped everything off the phone yeah, and it still does it, like I said, for over an hour, maybe an hour and went back to yeah, that's hysterical Before I reinstalled any other apps or anything.\n\n0:32:41 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd one other question I have for you, before we look at like busyness, have you placed any calls on it or recorded any video on it and listened to how the microphone is or is not picking up audio? In other words, is it possible that there's damage to the microphone such that it's not hearing you say the phrase like it is supposed to?\n\n0:33:04 - Caller\n\nyou say the phrase like it is supposed to, I can actually click on the microphone and ask Google something.\n\n0:33:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd it hears you.\n\n0:33:11 - Caller\n\nOkay, gee, it doesn't work.\n\n0:33:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo it might also and this is a long shot, but it's from our Discord, but I think it's true you might want to retrain the voice model, so delete it and start over again yeah, I said it did that.\n\n0:33:25 - Caller\n\nDone that it works for a short period of time and then stops working again.\n\n0:33:29 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, you already said that. Alright, no idea, yeah, no idea, okay. I'm not sure why that would be, that's very weird, it keeps getting corrupted. It really sounds to me like yeah, like no, like something else is using the microphone or it's busy doing something and so it's not hearing you.\n\nOh, the little process that would normally be open, because when you trigger it when you push the button on the search thing and say it, it works right. It's only when you're saying Correct, yeah, it's not listening. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's not listening.\n\n0:34:08 - Caller\n\nWell, yeah, it's like it's going into some kind of deep sleep or something. Yeah, it takes a while to wake up from yeah something else, I figure you know, on less expensive phones.\n\n0:34:17 - Leo Laporte\n\nit might well be that it's just gotten so busy doing what I don't know keeping track of the time that it's just not listening, because you can trigger it by pressing it.\n\n0:34:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThe only other thing that you might try as just a troubleshooting step is to because I'm sure you've got lots of backups try restoring it to device, to factory settings, like you've done, I know, but don't do a restore of all of your apps and things, Just have it as as if you just that's what I did.\n\n0:34:49 - Caller\n\nI did a yeah, I did a restore and then I reinstalled all my apps. Yeah.\n\n0:34:53 - Leo Laporte\n\nWow. So what the other thing is? Motorola may be killing the process that's listening to save battery life, and so you don't want it to, you don't want it to kill that oh, have you tried?\n\n0:35:07 - Mikah Sargent\n\nuh, does it. Does it have a replaceable battery?\n\n0:35:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nno uh, because, yeah, I was just thinking, if it's performances there's a website somebody in the chat room sent us to don't kill my app, dot com and uh, it says android manufacturers listed below prefer battery life over proper, proper functionality. Now I actually motorola is not on this list, but I think this might be that motorola is killing the process that's listening for your voice to save battery life. Motorola is not on here, which is interesting. Um, that's really weird, but Huawei, xiaomi, oneplus and Samsung all do that a lot, so I don't have off the top of my head, but keep listening, maybe somebody will come up with it. I appreciate the call we have to run.\n\n0:35:58 - Caller\n\nI'll get on Amazon and look for a travel router.\n\n0:36:00 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, look for a travel router. There's cheap ones. Yeah, I have just made my. You know, I started using Google's Gemini voice assistant, which I like, and replaced the Google assistant. You can do that now if you pay for Gemini, and I made my action button be that, oh you're. So now I can talk to.\n\nGemini and say what is Mikah Sargent and where does he belong? Let's see what it says. Hey, I found you. Sometimes it talks, sometimes it doesn't, so in this case it just gave me, uh, just did a search, a search, but that's kind of handy. Yeah, like I wanted to know. Uh, how old is jerry seinfeld?\n\n0:36:40 - Caller\n\njerry seinfeld is 70 years old too old.\n\n0:36:44 - Leo Laporte\n\nScott wilkinson, our home theater, geeky homes, hosts the home theater geek show uh every week on this network. If you are uh listening you, you can watch a video too if you're a member of the club. Hello, scott from santa cruz, california.\n\n0:36:58 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nHey, Mikah, hi, welcome, what's up? Hey how you guys doing great doing well, thank you well, uh, just a quick note. I am uh back now, a few weeks from mexico, having seen the total solar. Oh, you went down, how nice was changed forever.\n\n0:37:17 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOn that day, you opened up seven chakras yeah, well, you know, you know it.\n\n0:37:24 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nIt was amazing, no question about it. First one I'd seen, um, but I mean, there were people on the tour that that this was their seventh one. They had been all over the world. I've seen it. It's great. I'm not going to go all over the world to see it.\n\n0:37:41 - Mikah Sargent\n\nUh, I don't, I don't blame you. Uh, did you, were you there to take photos or did you just do kind of a glance at it with the proper protection?\n\n0:37:51 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nThe proper protection? Absolutely no, I did not take photos. I wanted to experience it without worrying about, oh, the exposure and the what have you? There was a professional photographer there who got some amazing shots. Yeah, you can really get some amazing shots.\n\n0:38:05 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, you can really get some beautiful shots. The problem is, everybody else is getting the same beautiful shots.\n\n0:38:09 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, that's how I saw it. I saw the beautiful shots everybody took. Did you recharge your crystals and the no, but I did meditate under it.\n\n0:38:17 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nOh nice, very nice.\n\n0:38:18 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo that was good, that's very something happens that's very interesting when the sun goes out.\n\n0:38:24 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nYeah, yeah. Anyway, that's just by way of letting you know You're back.\n\n0:38:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWelcome back. I'm glad that you had safe and good travels.\n\n0:38:34 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nThank you. Yes, what I wanted to talk about with regard to you know what we talk about here is that Sony just introduced their 2024 tv lineup. Ah, they didn't say anything at ces.\n\nThey said nothing. Wow ces about new tvs. Wow, but they did, uh, last month at an event, uh, at their at the sony picture studios in la. I didn go, but plenty of people I know did, and they all reported on it and I was a little concerned but expecting them to come out with a third generation of QD OLED. Right, leo, you got a Samsung QD OLED, I just bought a and you love it, and I just bought a Sony QD OLED 2023 model, second generation, and I thought, oh no, they're going to come out with a third generation and I will have Romo, as my wife terms it regret of missing out. But they didn't.\n\nI was shocked. They didn't come out with a third generation. They're keeping the second generation in the line through 2024. What they did instead? Their flagship is now a mini led lcd tv. Oh, boring, and well, yes and no, um, it's. It's far brighter than everything, anything they've done before. And they made a point of saying look, we have a grading monitor, a professional grading monitor that gets up to 4,000 nits of peak brightness.\n\n0:40:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's funny because Sony has been selling those for years, but as OLEDs.\n\n0:40:20 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nCorrect and it's now an LCD, so they now think LCD is as good as OLED. In other words, yes, well, it certainly gets brighter, there's no question about that. Well, it always has gotten brighter, it always has.\n\n0:40:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt was always the blacks that we wanted with OLED.\n\n0:40:34 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nCorrect, Correct. And I haven't seen this TV yet. I hope to soon and see how good the blacks are. It's mini-LED, so that means the backlight can get very dark and there are very many zones. There's like 300% more zones than their previous flagship LED, mini-LED LCD. So the shadowing behind the LCD panel, if you will, is much more precise and I'm sure it can get very dark. But the point is that if their consumer TV can get to 4,000 nits and a movie is mastered at 4,000 nits, then you don't need any tone mapping. You don't need the TV to roll off the brightness because it can't reach the same brightness as the coloring monitor that they used to make the movie in the first place. So this is what they're aiming at, I think.\n\n0:41:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nTheir main purpose, or they've done the market research and they found out that everybody wants a bright tv, that nobody is. Look, the market for, you know, home theater experiences is much smaller, and I'm sure this is true than the market for let's watch it in our living room.\n\n0:41:55 - Mikah Sargent\n\nLet's watch it in the living room, yeah, where there's lots of lighting, because, yep, we all live in these little places that have just like direct light from the what east?\n\n0:42:05 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nuh, yeah and yeah interesting it's true, it's true, and, and I always say, if you are putting a tv in a very bright room with lots of ambient light, you're going to watch it during the day. Then, yeah, maybe you do want an lcd tv.\n\n0:42:21 - Leo Laporte\n\nI have to say the qd oled, for me, solves both problems, because it's an OLED yeah Beautiful blacks, high contrast, very, very high contrast ratio, and it's very bright.\n\n0:42:33 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nAnd it's very bright. And QD OLED does get brighter than conventional OLED, no question about it, and it maintains color saturation as you get brighter and brighter and brighter better than LCD does.\n\n0:42:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's the problem is, we don't really know why Sony did this. You know you're assuming they did it because they can suddenly make it as good as OLED or QD OLED, I'm thinking Sony, look like any other company, wants to maximize profits and they may have just decided that, you know, there's not a lot in it for us to make the best TV. We don't care if we win the shootout, let's just make the. Tv that's going to sell the best. And you know, if I were Sony, that's what I would do too.\n\n0:43:16 - Mikah Sargent\n\nNits are a big marketing term right now, particularly for younger folks, if you think about the sort of game streaming space. All of those monitors, all talk about nits. Apple talks a lot about nits and all of its products. We've started to see Samsung and Google and all of the others who make Android phones talk about the nits of brightness. So, yeah, that is becoming such a buzzword that may very well be part of the reason.\n\n0:43:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nHere's a funny thing, because Apple, onuesday, is going to announce its new ipads, ipad pros with oled. We think really yes, which I?\n\n0:43:51 - Mikah Sargent\n\nthink is very interesting. They'll still be talking about it is very interesting.\n\n0:43:55 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nAn ipad with an oled screen, I like that.\n\n0:43:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, I mean I you sold me way back when on the quality of oled and when I want to watch on that blu-ray player. You also sold me on the best you know I'm watching dune and my dune 2. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. On the OLED and I think that's going to look the best.\n\n0:44:25 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nYep, you sold me on that.\n\n0:44:27 - Leo Laporte\n\nNow, the reason I'm intrigued by what Apple's doing is because now you're going to have a tablet 12.9 or 11 inches, that will be the best screen in the house, yeah, or as good as anyway. The best screen in the house It'll be P3, I'm sure, because everything they do is P3 now. It'll be a great photography tool, for instance, great way to look at your grade, look at your photos, to process your photos. Is OLED more accurate? Not necessarily, not necessarily. So it really depends how it's calibrated.\n\n0:45:03 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nIt depends on if it's calibrated correct, and any TV that can be calibrated to the specification that is well-defined, then it's going to be accurate.\n\n0:45:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo an LCD can especially well backlit it can. So maybe Sony's saying look, this is accurate. We don't have the super high contrast ratio of OLED, but it's bright and that's what most people want is bright.\n\n0:45:30 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nAnother feature that they touted brand new this year was something in the LCD called X-Wide Angle, which addresses really the main bugaboo of LCD TVs, which is, as you go off axis, the picture degrades yeah, it looks terrible, gets washed out, the contrast goes down um so, um your phone call, we got to get going because you got a call I got a phone call. No way I'm gonna decline it. Okay, talk to him later.\n\n0:45:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, it is somebody I know, so he'll he'll be fine not a robocall, not, I know you don't want to disappoint robocalls, because it just makes them mad.\n\n0:46:10 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nSo they did introduce a new OLED, a regular OLED, not a QD OLED.\n\n0:46:14 - Caller\n\nAnd I will tell you.\n\n0:46:15 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nI just took delivery on a QD OLED and I'm getting it installed next week.\n\n0:46:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nI will be very Now. Did you get the Samsung? No, the Sony, you got the Sony. I'll be very interested what you think Now. You've seen my Samsung QD OLED. Yeah, I calibrated it, I know, thank you, and it really does look good, although I have to say when I put it in the calibrated mode it seems kind of dim. Those movie makers really like their movies dark. They do, that's true.\n\n0:46:47 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nWhy is that? I don't know. I read one article recently that said because they can, yeah.\n\n0:46:54 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, I guess, yeah, yeah, but I agree with you.\n\n0:46:59 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nI agree with you. Many movie makers make their movies to look dark. When it's in calibrated mode, the tv's in calibrated mode, it does look dark, yeah and and almost a little desaturated too.\n\n0:47:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's the other thing, and that's why I think sony might have made this decision. Because what do they do in this on the showroom floor? They turn the brightness way up, and they do, and they pop the color like crazy because that's what people buy.\n\n0:47:23 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nYeah, yeah, I know, I know and I talk about this all the time that, uh, you know, you can't, you, you don't live in a showroom floor right, well, but also think about the, the people who are doing the color grading.\n\n0:47:37 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThey're not doing it in a living room, in a normal house.\n\n0:47:40 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey're doing it in those dark, dark spaces well, no, uh, when, uh, when scott came over, he did it in the living room. This is true I get a calibrator.\n\n0:47:51 - Mikah Sargent\n\nCome to your house I mean the movie makers, the people you asked why they do it in so dim. It's, yeah, the graders. They're probably doing it in a space in a dark room.\n\n0:47:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, sure, that's correct.\n\n0:48:00 - Caller\n\nYeah, that's correct, and they're probably using sony's oled displays to do it, which is interesting, correct, yeah All right, Scott.\n\n0:48:08 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nAnyway, it's good it's going to be good what's?\n\n0:48:10 - Caller\n\ncoming up.\n\n0:48:12 - Leo Laporte\n\nSorry. Yeah, report back on your new Sony. I'd be very curious. This I will do.\n\n0:48:16 - Scott Wilkinson\n\nI will do. This week on Home Theater. Geeks is a much more detailed accounting of the new Sony TVs Perfect.\n\n0:48:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo if uh, accounting of the sony, the new sony, perfect. So if you want to know more home, subscribe to home theater geeks on your in your favorite podcast player and if you want to see the video, subscribe to club TWiT so you can see the video, but the audio is available to all.\n\nThank you, scott thank you very much you bet, have a great weekend, take care, bye-bye, bye-bye Our home theater guru, scott Wilkinson. All right, you have. You see, everybody has a different thing they want. You have a projection TV because you want it big and that's going to be not as bright, right, the contrast is not going to be as high, but it's big, but it makes up for it. Yeah, because it's big. Lisa's kind of mad at me, frankly, because I traded that the projection in for the QD OLED, which is only only 77 inches, and, uh, she wanted for the Super Bowl, she wanted big. So everybody has something different, uh, that they want yeah, it's all about preference, right, it absolutely is.\n\n0:49:23 - Mikah Sargent\n\nit absolutely is Preference and financial availability.\n\n0:49:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think oh well, Two big things. You can't forget that either. Absolutely not. All right, we're going to take a little break and when we come back, more of your calls 888, I don't remember 724-2884. It's something like that. Hey, it's something like that. Or you can use zoom on your phone and call dot TWiTchtv is the address our show today, brought to you by the great folks at Eufy. Oh, I love this effect, Mikah, you know more about it than I do because you installed the Eufy there.\n\nIt is so simple to install Three-in-one triple security, smart video lock how easy was it.\n\n0:50:09 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt was. I mean, you see in the video, if you're watching, it's just a screwdriver. A Phillips head screwdriver was all I needed to do the installation of the E330.\n\n0:50:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nWow, very nice. And what I like about it is it is both a camera and a lock so you can see who's at your door ringing your doorbell, you can see who's coming and going and it has fingerprint recognition very fast. Point three, second fingerprint recognition unlocks within a second. It's very quick and that replaceable battery lasts up to four months Plus. You get a low battery notification before it runs out. And, my favorite part, if the battery does run out, it has a keyhole. Oh, hallelujah, I love it. You don't see the keyhole. It's very cleverly hidden. But if, for instance, you know your battery's dead or for whatever reason, you want to use a key look how fast that is. That's so cool. You you can just pry back. Not pry back, but pull back the little locks logo and unlock it by hand. I think that's a nice fallback, but you're never going to need it.\n\nYou can control your front door remotely through the Eufy VideoLock app. It includes passcode unlocking remote control.

Oh, I like it.\n\nAnother wireless caller at 888-724-2884 star six to unmute hi guys, hey what's your first name and what city are you calling from?\n\n0:52:56 - Caller\n\nmy name is camille. I'm calling pennsylvania. How you doing?\n\n0:53:00 - Leo Laporte\n\nwell, it's great to talk to you. How are things in pa? Beautiful, the leaves are popping out, the birds are tweeting.\n\n0:53:06 - Caller\n\nIt's great to talk to you. How are things in PA? Beautiful, the leaves are popping out, the birds are tweeting it's great.\n\n0:53:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nSpring is beautiful in Pennsylvania.\n\n0:53:15 - Caller\n\nI just wondered, Leo, I enjoy the shows and I just wondered if I heard you had mentioned that you were reading or rereading 1984. Yeah, and I wondered if you'd read the one for nowadays. That's from 2013,. Dave Eggers the circle.\n\n0:53:29 - Leo Laporte\n\nI love Dave Eggers and I have read the circle and it's it's kind of a Facebook, kind of a spooky Facebook, right.\n\n0:53:38 - Caller\n\nOh, it's worse than Facebook. It's them all melded together.\n\n0:53:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's how it would be. Yeah, and it may be that way by now. Yeah, you love that book.\n\n0:53:48 - Caller\n\nI don't love it. It was actually not that good. The story is crazy. I didn't really love 1984 either.\n\n0:53:54 - Leo Laporte\n\nNo, I guess you know the way. You don't, because they're kind of dystopian right and maybe it's scary. Yeah, eggers is a great novel.\n\n0:54:03 - Caller\n\nLet's just please not get Fahrenheit 451. Oh again, I never read any of his other books. That's a really interesting point, fahrenheit 451 is great. Now reread that one, and then look at Boston Dynamics spot the robotic dog. Yeah, anyway, I just wanted to tell you you have read the Circle Great. The movie's terrible.\n\n0:54:27 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh, I haven't seen the movie.\n\n0:54:28 - Caller\n\nThey made a movie out of it. Oh, it's crap, don't do it, it's bad. Is Anne Hathaway in there? They just butcher books. Is Anne Hathaway? It's Emma Watson.\n\n0:54:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, I think it's the girl from Harry Potter. Yeah, harry Potter girl, I started watching it and I hated it. It's terrible yeah.\n\n0:54:44 - Caller\n\nYeah, it's an awful movie.\n\n0:54:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, so get the book, not the movie.\n\nDon't do it. I'll tell you the 1984 that I'm quote reading. I'm actually listening to an Audible. Andrew Garfield plays Winston. They've dramatized it so it's a play and I really enjoy that. Sometimes Audible will do that with a classic book, and they did, I think, a very nice job. So of course I read and reread 1984 many times, but I thought, well, I wonder, you know, here we are, third, what is it 40 years later? I remember in 1984, we would say things like see, it's not 1984, but now here we are, 40 years later, and it could be getting a little bit closer to the edge of, I think, the circle's, probably closer to the possibilities than the 1984. Are you worried about a dystopia in the future? Do you feel like we're going in the wrong direction or do you think that? Are you a optimist, camille?\n\n0:55:42 - Caller\n\nI'm pretty much an optimist. I don't know. I wish. I wish there was a way to to have the choice in the circle.\n\n0:55:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey don't give you the choice in the circle, that's the even the people that don't want it, or it's like you're forced so that stinks, but so my, my friend if we could have a choice my friend, rob reed, wrote a wonderful book kind of along the same uh lines, called year zero or no, I'm sorry it was after I don't know that one. Yeah, afteron is about a omniscient social network and an advertising network tied to it and in the initial scene guy comes in and the robot waitress brings him his beer. He said how did you know's? They know, because the social not only does the social network know what beer he wants, they know where he is at all times. It's a really dystopian, interesting novel. It's called after on and rob. Uh, for there's that other one. What's that? Okay?\n\n0:56:47 - Caller\n\nthere's another one. I don't know the author, but it's the feed. Amazon made a show in the uk, I think about it. That's another where you're don't know the author, but it's the Feed. Amazon made a show in the UK, I think about it. That's another where you're always on and hooked in and people can share your memories.\n\n0:56:57 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\n0:56:58 - Caller\n\nYeah, I only watched, I think, the first episode, but I read the book and again, not a very good book and there's some creepy, creepy awful things in there.\n\n0:57:07 - Leo Laporte\n\nAre you a Black mirror fan? Have you watched black mirror?\n\n0:57:11 - Caller\n\nI actually I've only ever seen two episodes of black mirror and, uh, something with a bear where they made people relive the horrible things they did.\n\n0:57:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nI'm like that's enough for me, thank you it's another one where it's a look at what the future might hold, and it's aptly named black mirror. It's it's bleak, but uh, it's often very right on. In fact, there's an episode of so about social credit, where people yeah, that's the one.\n\n0:57:37 - Caller\n\nI've heard referenced a lot. That's worth watching.\n\n0:57:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, it's on netflix. Hey, camille, it's always a pleasure. Thank you for calling.\n\n0:57:44 - Caller\n\nI appreciate it yeah, I'm gonna listen to some good recommendations and I love yeah, do do listen to it, Mikah, and I think I just want to say that episode that you had of this week in Google where Stacey was back in Paris, was there?\n\n0:57:56 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh that was so much fun.\n\n0:57:57 - Caller\n\nAnd Mikah was. When you're on this, yeah, yeah.\n\n0:58:00 - Leo Laporte\n\nMikah always adds to the show. We got to get him to come on every week. Um, all right, yeah, well, thank you.\n\n0:58:06 - Caller\n\nWell, hey guys, take care read some books.\n\n0:58:09 - Caller\n\nYeah, that's a great class of library thank you, camille.\n\n0:58:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nHere's some happy news the Choco Taco is back. Are you happy? Klondike discontinued it a couple of years ago. Cold Stone Creamery, in honor of Cinco de Mayo, will make you a cold stone choco taco for one week. Ah, for one week only. I'll be going to cold stone after the show today to celebrate cinco de mayo.\n\n0:58:43 - Mikah Sargent\n\nHappy cinco de mayo happy cinco de mayo and see if there's good news in the world.\n\n0:58:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nChoco taco, choco, tacos back for one week only. Uh, yeah, uh. Berkeley burke is saying, uh, black mirror, and nails it every single time. I know that's kind of why it's kind of a depressing show. Um steve in san diego says the chosen is another good one. The chosen, you know, there's so much now dystopian TV that I'm getting a little depressed. I started watching Fallout. Talk about bleak. There's so much dystopian TV now. I guess our creatives in the world are kind of feeling the future and not liking it much. I don't know. 888-724-2884, give us a ring, let us talk to you, answer your. You can. You can make suggestions. We also like answering questions. We do. Do you have another question?\n\n0:59:43 - Caller\n\nI go reach behind me uh, yeah, if you want to do that for a question yeah, always like doing that while we prepare our next caller.\n\n0:59:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nUh, images and files, and oh, we did this one. Oh, wait a minute, it's a, it's a comeback. Remember ronald last week said he asked about files within bit warden yeah, what was mentioned. So he was worried because in bit warden you can put your as I do put your passport, your driver's license, to show security number. But he says, when you export it from bit warden, it's just an image, an unencrypted image, on your hard drive. He does say that raises questions about the security protocol on the iPhone or iPad itself. Here's what he did.\n\nI created the following Created a JPEG and PNG, stored them in Bitwarden. Then I opened one of them on my iPhone. As expected, I could find the file within the iphone files app. I then deleted the file, went to recent files, deleted it there. My question is is this a secure delete? So that was the issue that we kind of peripherally mentioned.\n\nWhen you decrypt something, it's the same thing as if you exported your password vault into a text file, right? Yeah, you're moving from one password manager to another. Your entire password vault is now sitting on your hard drive unencrypted. Yeah, that's the worst state for it to be in right. But he wants to know on his iPhone, is it secure delete when he deletes it? I don't, or are they doing what other operating systems do with just renaming? He says I tried to research this but didn't come up with much. I'm going to guess that Apple. Ok, I'll tell you what I know, what I know the answer Because your entire iPhone is encrypted.\n\nSo everything on here is encrypted and it's only visible to you, just like Bitwarden. It's only visible to you because you did the unlock, whether it was a face ID, a password, a fingerprint or just your PIN. Until that is hit, everything on here is scrambled. Everything, including that image that was in your files. It all gets unlocked with the PIN. This is why we've talked about this in the past.\n\nIt's really important that you protect this. In fact, it's why we talked about that court case a couple of weeks ago where the judge ruled that the law enforcement could force a defendant to put his fingerprint on the phone and unlock it. The judge said that's no different than taking your fingerprint at the jail or taking a strand of your hair for DNA. It is not protected by the Fifth Amendment. It is not protected by your right not to incriminate yourself. This by itself is not an act of incrimination. By extension, nor would face ID be. They could just say unlock it and it would be unlocked.\n\nSo if you're concerned about all this, good to know, it's encrypted. But the thing to be worried about is how easily unencrypted it is. If you have, for instance, a four digit pin, that's only 10,000 possibilities that can be guessed or encrypted. I mean, that's why Apple has that only 10 guesses thing. You should turn that on Right, then it erases the phone. If you get it wrong 10 times, I would suggest you want six digits at least that's what Apple's standard is now, and you may want to turn all of that off.\n\nIf you really care about this, ronald, turn all of that off and say I only want my iPhone to be unlocked with a password. It's completely inconvenient, right, but it's secure, it's very secure and there's always this balance between security and convenience. So to reassure you, you don't need secure delete on an iPhone. In fact, if you were to and this is true of any encrypted disk, so if you've turned on FileVault on your Mac, bitlocker on your Windows machine, if you were to do the factory reset on your iPhone, you know, unlock it, factory reset. What that's done is taken away the encryption code. You don't have to erase the disk because all that's on there is encrypted bits. It looks like gobbledygook. It cannot be decrypted. It's strong encryption, so everything on here is safe until it's unlocked. Make it hard to unlock it would be my suggestion. And at the very least, don't use a four digit pin.\n\n1:03:57 - Mikah Sargent\n\nTurn on the 10 guess limit and you know I also recommend in the settings there's an option that USB connected to it cannot access it if it's locked. Love that.\n\n1:04:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo lock it down. But the good news is it is you access it. If it's locked, love that. So lock it down. But the good news is it is you don't need secure delete. And the same thing on a Mac. If you've got FileVault which is the default now turned on, you don't need secure delete really, because unless you're logged in, it's gobbledygook, it's nonsense. That's why it takes so long these days to log into a Mac. I don't know if you've noticed that.\n\nYeah, shut down, it's decrypting, all right, good, that was a good question. I'm glad we could do the question. Great follow up. And again, just in case you didn't hear our answer last time, it's fine that Bitwarden stores. It's the same thing. It's stored in an encrypted vault, but in order to see it you have to decrypt it. So decrypt it in a safe way, right? Do a secure delete afterwards if you don't have an encrypted disk and so forth.\n\nAnd really that's why you want to have a good password, you want to have a six-digit PIN. I mean, maybe don't use a face ID. Or if you're worried about law, the law, I don't know why you're worried about the law, but if you're worried about the law, then you probably don't want to use a fingerprint or a face id because, at least so far we believe, the courts believe that you are protected from by the fifth amendment, from self-incrimination. They can't get demand your password. That's something in your head that's protected. They can demand a thumbprint. They can force you to do face id. They cannot demand your password. That's something in your head that's protected. They can demand a thumbprint. They can force you to do face ID. They cannot demand your password. That is protected by the Fifth Amendment. All right, I have given you time to find us a phone caller.\n\n1:05:43 - Caller\n\nWonderful. I am ready with this phone caller right here.\n\n1:05:46 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOkay, Hello phone caller. What's your name and from whence do you hail?\n\n1:05:52 - Caller\n\nMichelle and I am from Texas.\n\n1:05:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nHi Michelle.\n\n1:05:56 - Caller\n\nWelcome, hi guys. I just want to tell you I watch you guys as much as I can and I love it.\n\n1:06:02 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThank you.\n\n1:06:02 - Caller\n\nBut I have a great question for you, Good, Okay.\n\n1:06:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo my question I probably might have missed one of your episodes and I might have missed you talking about this, so I might have missed one of your episodes and I might have missed you talking about this, so if I did, I apologize. No, we like repeats because it saves us brain cycles.\n\n1:06:17 - Caller\n\nSo just repeat away. I love it. Okay. So the AT&T and the security breach? Oh boy, oh yes, this is great. So my question is for years and years, and years how many years have we been told don't go clicking on everything, don't just go getting carried away and clicking unsecured links. How do you know if it's secure?\n\n1:06:40 - Leo Laporte\n\nBut anyway, and you do all those things because you're a good person and you're secure, right. But you're wondering now what does it matter if these big companies are going to be so dopey?\n\n1:06:55 - Caller\n\nBecause if you secured your AT&T account with a good password.\n\n1:06:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou didn't click on links. You're doing all the right things and you know, in a way, I think you're right that we've been blaming the wrong people.\n\n1:07:06 - Caller\n\nExactly so, listen, for 73 million accounts were breached. So the resolution for this is to send you an email that says click this link and sign up for your security, your extra security we're going to give you from Experian, one of the credit reporting agencies. So if you call Experian, then they're like well, you have to go to your email and click on that link and I'm like wait a minute. I'm like a minute. I'm like why would I do that when you know you've been told for years not to do that? 73 million people worse, worse, in your email.\n\n1:07:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nthe bad guys we showed this on security now last week are sending out emails that are identical to the email from at&t yep, Yep. So I mean, I'm sure the AT&T link is safe to click on, but how do you know? How do you know? It's a real email, because the bad? Guy's email is a copy of the AT&T email in all respects except for one. The link goes to a bad guy's site where you enter your password. And now they got you Exactly.\n\n1:08:12 - Caller\n\nThey got everything now, because this is experience talking. Now, you know, and I'm like, I call them and they're like well, you have to do this and I go. Well, I don't want to. I want to call you and I want you to set it up for me.\n\n1:08:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nYes, they won't do that I already have that they won't do it, you have to do it online.\n\n1:08:25 - Caller\n\nNo, that's right and I said well, first of all, thank you for this, for the offer to give, give me some free security, knowing that you're going to watch my account for me. I already have that. I already typed that.\n\n1:08:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nGood. So you listen to us when we say credit freeze on all three Experian, equifax and TransUnion. Credit freeze, yeah.\n\n1:08:48 - Caller\n\nGood, it's been done for years, perfect, and so they're not offering me to do anything that I've never done. I've already done this Right. The big companies are leaking my information, and that's why I had to do it in the first place. And then it just irritates me that they want to send out to 73 million people and tell you hey, we've reached all your information and you need to click here and sign up for this credit monitoring. Isn't that? You need to click here and sign up for this credit monitoring? Okay, well, I already had that in place and it didn't save me a bit. So what good is it?\n\n1:09:18 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, I see what you're saying, because even if you have those freezes in place and you're doing it yourself, your data still got leaked through AT&T, like you're already doing it. I understand, yeah, that's it.\n\n1:09:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's a little bit like closing the barn door after the horse is gone, isn't it?\n\n1:09:34 - Caller\n\nExactly Now, and I have. I have another question about something similar to that which has to do with iPhone. So it's perfect, I'm not an iPhone fan, never have been. And then someone says, you know, not all millions of people can be wrong in the world. And I'm like, well, it is true.\n\n1:09:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nCause, uh, cause the best steak is not at McDonald's, even though they sell a lot more beef Right. So just the number of the number of customers does not by itself make something better.\n\n1:10:04 - Caller\n\nNo, Exactly so. I ordered this great iPhone with all this memory and all this stuff. I don't want to run out. I can't add any memory to it and I get it sent to me and I go, get ready to turn it on and guess what? What? You can't even activate your phone unless you have wi-fi. I didn't have wi-fi at the time I was using my phone. I don't think that's true. That's not true.\n\n1:10:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh we you can activate it without wi-fi they.\n\n1:10:29 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI don't know when you did this, but yeah, they have. Basically, apple has a deal with carriers where you basically have a temporary connection to the carrier to do an activation for this specific reason.\n\n1:10:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou have to have that. I mean, you can't do it without cellular. So if you're living somewhere in Texas that doesn't have a good cellular connection, then you would need Wi-Fi, you would definitely have this problem.\n\n1:10:50 - Caller\n\nNo, I had cellular. I had cellular, but I didn't have a good cellular connection. Then you would need Wi-Fi. You would definitely have this problem. No, I had cellular. I had cellular, but I didn't have Wi-Fi. And at the time, two years ago, when I got it, it said I got an 11 Pro Max and so at that time when I went to turn it on, you couldn't do it without Wi-Fi. And then they wanted to give you an update every couple weeks, which is great. You do need Wi-Fi. You have to have Wi-Fi again.\n\n1:11:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt'll do it over there that's the carriers because the carriers don't want to pay the bandwidth, so they want you to use your bandwidth to do it. But you can do it over a cell, can't you? You turn that on.\n\n1:11:22 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYou have to turn that on Once you've got the activation in place and you've got your plan, then you can go into the settings and turn it on for the cellular service.\n\n1:11:32 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhat happens if it's an unlocked phone? What if she bought a phone that doesn't have associated to a carrier? It is unlocked and it was unlocked. Yeah.\n\n1:11:38 - Caller\n\nThat's right, and it was unlocked, though I already had it unlocked and I already had service.\n\n1:11:42 - Mikah Sargent\n\nBut, you can't I mean that's what wait, you had service.\n\n1:11:46 - Caller\n\nYes, yes, I had current service with the company which was at the time, verizon. Yes, I did, with an unlocked phone just sent to me, brand new, and I couldn't even activate it because of the fact I didn't have Wi-Fi.\n\n1:12:14 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat's odd. That is not a behavior that I have experienced before, because I have. Uh, specifically, I remember one year I was living in Missouri at the time and I got my iPhone and I immediately wanted to get it turned on, install it and all that kind of stuff, and I was in the middle of nowhere, like I was so eager to get it turned on, that I had pulled over and I was working through and I was able yeah, I, I was able to update it or not update it, but I get it working right there and activate and everything on the cell network.\n\nSo I don't know what happened, that it was causing that issue, but that is for the people listening. That's not a typical.\n\n1:12:45 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's not normal it is. We're not saying that didn't happen, right it probably there was some circumstance. Apple for some reason wanted it to be on wi-fi, but that, I think, was unique to whatever was going on.\n\n1:12:57 - Caller\n\nYeah, there, I'm not sure why maybe because I called apple and I called verizon, they both have the same answer. They said you have to have wi-fi and this is you had.\n\n1:13:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nI didn't have a plan. Was it a Verizon account that you pay up front, or was it a pay? Oh no.\n\n1:13:16 - Caller\n\nIt's just a normal Verizon, a normal two-line account.\n\n1:13:20 - Caller\n\nYou know, here's our problem we always have Wi-Fi, except you didn't in the car, I didn't, and it worked.\n\n1:13:25 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo I haven't really noticed whether it required Wi-Fi or not, but it's not supposed to. Let's put it that way whether it required a wife or not, but it's not supposed to. Let's put it that way it's not supposed to and they both said it was yeah, but also they.\n\n1:13:36 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThe problem is sometimes support technicians are are giving answers without context, which is that it's going to work the best if you have wifi, but they just say to you well, you need wifi because that's an easier thing to say. So, yeah, I all I want to, and Leo explained it. We fully believe that this happened to you. This is not a gaslighting moment.\n\n1:13:56 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt couldn't possibly have happened.\n\n1:13:58 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's just that we have had the experience. We don't know why.\n\n1:14:00 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, we don't know why exactly that happened to you and there must have been something. Really Remember the activation for the phone and the whole issue for activation is to prevent stolen phones. This is relatively new. It's the activation lock and the idea is somebody can't just take a phone that fell off a truck and get it on the network. Apple is very, very finicky about activation and my guess is that they want to know that it's you activating it and my guess is there was something about your situation. I don't know that doesn't.\n\n1:14:36 - Caller\n\nI don't that they for some reason, they told me that I had to have my own wi-fi because I had to get it activated through wi-fi and I said I don't use wi-fi at home, I don't have a yeah, not everybody has wi-fi and that's part of the second caller today who doesn't have wi-fi.\n\n1:14:51 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo I don't think that they and I do.\n\n1:14:53 - Caller\n\nWell, I have it now. I have it now. It doesn't. I had to get it because I was tired of hot spotting. Yeah, I wonder if it needed wi-fi for.\n\n1:15:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo here's one scenario, uh, that maybe scooter x is suggesting um, if it's a brand new phone before you, you can activate it. Do you have to do an update to the phone? And if that's the case, they may not, because you hadn't yet activated on the network.\n\n1:15:21 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThere was a new iPhone a few years ago. I remember where the cellular system did need an update, so it could have been specific to that model phone.\n\n1:15:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nBefore you could do anything, you had to somehow get online and update the cellular. Updated cellular settings and then you could go ahead and everything would work. So it's got to be some weird scenario like that where oh, you know, yeah, go ahead.\n\n1:15:46 - Caller\n\nI'm sorry, no, no, no, no, no, I didn't mean to interrupt you. Go ahead, no, no, please. I think it had something to do with the fact that most people activate their phones standing right there at Verizon or AT&T or whoever. That's right, they're standing right there and a lot of people don't even know that, no matter what, they're going to give you a Google account so they can turn it on anyway. They don't even they make them for you.\n\n1:16:17 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's with Apple. They just make that for you. This is one of my P's with Apple. I don't want them to thank for me. You know, michelle, unfortunately we have to live, live in this highly imperfect world where these big companies like AT&T, verizon and Apple all are colluding to get you into the giant maw of consumerism and late stage capitalism. And anybody who doesn't want to be eaten is out of luck and and you're going to breach your information.\n\n1:16:44 - Caller\n\nYeah, you're just pointing out the.\n\n1:16:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis is the frustration, and this is why Cory Doctorow coined the term and shitification and why we talk about late stage capitalism and why, early in the show, I was complaining about Google, is that, unfortunately, these companies have gotten to the point. They've they've gone through the stage, which we all enjoyed, where they were giving stuff away right and left because they wanted to build a giant customer base. They're there. They got the giant customer base because they wanted to build a giant customer base. They're there. They got the giant customer base. Now they're up to one thing, and one thing only.\n\nThat's squeezing us for as much profit as they can get, because they've got us, they locked us in. We can't go anywhere else. It's an opportunity, I think, for somebody to come along and do something better. The problem is, unless you have billions of dollars of capitalization, you can't design an iPhone, you can't build a cellular network, you can't be AT&T. At&t is the only AT&T and we're out of luck.\n\nYou know, we live in a world now where these behemoths control everything. I, you know. I don't know how you feel about government. It's another behemoth, but right now it's. The only thing that can stop solve this is to is government regulation breaking them up, uh, trust, antitrust, action, that kind of thing. And I know a lot of people say, well, that's just going from the fire into the frying pan into the fire. That's not an improvement. Government is also the giant. So I don't know what you do except move out into the country. I hope you live somewhere beautiful in texas, and uh, I do. And uh, have a, have a water, have yeah. There you go, now you're set and just look out the beautiful countryside and say this will always be here. Yes, whatever this too shall pass, but the beautiful gulf will always be there god willing and the creek don't rise.\n\nThat's right hey, michelle, pleasure talking to you. I'm sorry to be. Thank you so much for your bearer of bad tidings. Enjoy your life. Yeah, with the death star all right, michelle, thank you.\n\n1:18:47 - Caller\n\nIt's great to listening to you. All right, michelle. Thank you. It's great to talk to you.\n\n1:18:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nShe went from AT&T to Verizon right. Actually, she's not an AT&T customer. This is the irony of it. It's only 7.4 million current AT&T customers. It's 65 million former AT&T customers, of which I am one.\n\n1:19:08 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, I just got one too from somebody else and I thought great love that. I wish I could remember who it was now.\n\n1:19:17 - Leo Laporte\n\nI don't want to be the grim reaper here. I want to be optimistic. You know, when we started doing this 20 years ago, it was exciting. It looked like the world was going to be a better place that you know. This was a chance to innovate and create. I want to be there again. That's one of the reasons I'm excited about ai, although I have to say i's going in the same direction even faster. So I don't know what the answer is.\n\n1:19:41 - Mikah Sargent\n\nJust enjoy, enjoy your friends and family.\n\n1:19:44 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou have it the beautiful countryside as long as you've got it. Uh, got it. May the 4th be with you and happy Cinco de Mayo. Our show today, brought to you by I don't know what you do.\n\n1:20:00 - Mikah Sargent\n\nHappy Choco.\n\n1:20:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nTaco Day. Enjoy your Choco Taco and shut up.\n\n1:20:04 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI knew you were going to say that.\n\n1:20:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nI was going to say that that's why God gave us capitalism. So if there's no Choco taco available from one company, another one can steal it happen our show\n\ntoday. Now I want a choco taco. I don't think I've ever had a choco taco I remember having Choco Tacos see, the irony is I how can you like I don't miss the mcrib either because I never had one, never had one? Yeah, I don't miss the McRib either, cause I never had one. I never had one, yeah, and I don't think I ever want to have one the problem with Choco Taco.\n\n1:20:36 - Mikah Sargent\n\nLet me tell you about the problem with Choco Taco, and then we'll take our little break, at least the one from wherever. Where were they from? Was it Dairy Queen? Yeah, wherever, choco, you buy them in the grocery store. Oh, that's right. They always the the taco shell always was stale.\n\n1:20:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh yeah, stale.\n\n1:20:53 - Mikah Sargent\n\nBecause it was slightly moist because of the ice cream, and so it didn't have a crisp to it, and so it was an unpleasant mouthfeel, and I'm hoping that for you, as a person who can consume wheat, that you will have a Choco Taco from Cold Stone that does not have the mushy shell, that it actually has a crunch to it.\n\n1:21:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nI'm thinking that they probably are making those fresh every day. That's what I'm thinking At Cold Stone, I would hope right.\n\n1:21:19 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo I imagine it'll be better than the Choco Tacos you bought in the store. One would buy in the store.\n\n1:21:25 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's funny, Anthony Nielsen has published an AI image that looks exactly like I did last night. Oh yeah, because you went to the thing at the star Wars burlesque that I went to. I have that outfit.\n\n1:21:38 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI didn't I. I you said let me get out of here before they bring me up on stage, though.\n\n1:21:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, that's exactly right. I didn't want anybody to see me in my costume.\n\nThis episode of Ask The Tech Guys is brought to you by CacheFly.\n\nFor over 20 years, CacheFly has held a track record for high-performing, ultra-reliable content delivery - serving over 5,000 companies in over 80 countries.

Once you get connected and you press star six, give us your name and where you are calling from. I can't.\n\n1:25:53 - Caller\n\nHi, this is Sarah from Saratoga, new York. Hey, hello.\n\n1:25:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nHow are you Dara?\n\n1:26:00 - Caller\n\nVery well, I was thinking of you, leo, this past weekend. I just got back from Westerly Rhode Island. I'm driving through, I was thinking about your mom and your kids.\n\n1:26:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, andy, anako's in that area also and out your mom and your kids. Yeah, andy and not goes in that area also and it's so beautiful isn't it especially this time of year, but so is saratoga. I love saratoga, it's a beautiful area, yeah, well you know, we have horses and everything we have um a nearby town that has hot springs like saratoga springs does, but it's in california.\n\nSo the guy, sam Brandon, who created the resort there decided to call the town Calistoga because it's the Saratoga of California. So I don't know what that means, but we don't have horses, so anyway, welcome.\n\n1:26:51 - Caller\n\nWe've got a lot of them.\n\n1:26:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, I know it's a beautiful area. What can we do for you?\n\n1:26:56 - Caller\n\nI just want to say I'm a happy Club TWiT member, thank you, and it is the best value of all my apps that I have. Thank you, lots of great content there.\n\n1:27:05 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd we want to make more, and the Club TWiT members really make that possible. So thank you, I appreciate it.\n\n1:27:12 - Caller\n\nYeah, I've been a fan of Leo. I've been a fan of yours since back in the Regis and Kathy Lee days. That's who I am. And, Mikah, you're a wonderful addition. All of your knowledge, all your shows are just the best.\n\n1:27:22 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThank you so much. Those are great.\n\n1:27:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nHe's my Kathy Lee. I'm Regis Well, I feel beautiful. I'm Regis, well, I feel beautiful. Yeah, no, maybe you're more like my Kelly. How about that? Okay, yeah, she's cuter. So what can we now?\n\n1:27:42 - Caller\n\nthat we've really annoyed everybody. What can we do for you? Well, for the first time in the decade I'm buying a new iPhone and for the first time I'll have more data in my iCloud storage than I will on the hardware, on the phone. And I feel like I should know the answer to this what happens to that data, which I guess is mostly photos and music that I won't have on the phone? I know it'll stay secure in the iCloud, but is there like what kills first? The old stuff, the new stuff?\n\n1:28:16 - Mikah Sargent\n\nHow does that work? This is a great question. I love this question because this is going to be common for a lot of people. So what Apple has done over time is A they've seen a lot of their users, a lot of their customers, complain about the fact that they're running out of storage space, and so over time they've introduced little technologies, kind of behind the scenes, that help to improve upon this experience, and it uses what they for a long time called machine learning. Now they are want to call it AI because everybody's calling it AI to more intelligently understand how you use your device and use that to determine what actually gets loaded onto your phone.\n\nSo when you get this new phone and you're kind of wondering, is it going to be older photos, is it going to be newer photos? Is it going to be older music, newer music? That's all going to depend on your behavior. But when you first get your new phone, what it's going to do is kind of set things to a default, particularly with your photos and videos. It's going to make available locally on your device smaller and I don't mean that in physical size, but in storage space size smaller versions of the photos and videos that you have that are stored in their original form on your cloud and then, as you go through and take photos, to add to that, those photos are going to start out as full size and they'll be local on your device. The videos will be as well, and, depending on how often you go back and look at them or if you are editing them, then the full version will be downloaded.\n\nYour older photos are going to remain off of your device, with just smaller versions of those photos stored locally, but if at any point you go back and you scroll through and you look at a photo and you hit the edit button, then it's going to download the full version. But also, if you do something like you commonly go back and look at photos from a year ago and that's something that you regularly do the system can become aware of that and will make it so that those are going to be more available to you. The same thing applies to your music. You have the ability to go in and choose how your music is downloaded and stored locally versus streamed, and there are some settings that you can change. To say, I always want 16 gigabytes of the space that I have on my iPhone devoted to locally downloaded music versus what's stored in the cloud. So the short answer is it all depends on your behavior and, of course, the long answer was what I just gave you.\n\n1:30:54 - Leo Laporte\n\nI recently, you know, I've been fiddling around with different ways to handle my photography and I recently realized that really what I want to do, since I take pictures almost equally on a fancy camera and on my iPhone, I really want to store everything in photos, apple's photos. That's become like the default. In fact, the camera I use, its app, which I have on my phone and on my iPad, will automatically copy stuff to Apple photos. So of course now I have 60,000, 61,942 photos. Of course I don't want them all on my phone, but I do want the ability to kind of look at them and review them without having them take up all that space. So this is a perfect solution to me all that space. So this is a perfect solution to me. I import them into photos.\n\nOn devices where I have enough storage, I can keep the originals I know that iCloud will and then on devices like my phone, where I don't have enough storage, I still have access to all the pictures, but as thumbnails, as you mentioned, not in the full quality, unless I want to edit them, and then I can download them. So I have the picture here. I have the picture. I'm actually on Windows, on the web, and if I want to edit it. I can. Furthermore, what I really like is that it will allow me to edit it in another program. So there are a couple of really good iOS and macOS apps now. I tried Lightroom and I didn't want to spend the money for Adobe Lightroom, so I'm using something called Darkroom, which I really like on the Mac and iOS. It does everything I want. It integrates beautifully with Apple's photos, so I have kind of the best of both worlds.\n\nThe only negative is you have to pay for enough storage in iCloud, right, but iCloud's not super expensive, it's comparable to everybody else. So I have everything in iCloud, all the originals, enough to ever worry. And, by the way, my originals on this camera, 60 megapixels, 60 megabytes. They're giant, but it saves them all. So I have that. I never lose anything. I have, you know, copies on my computer at home, which has enough storage of the originals there as well. So now I have a backup and online and I can edit it anywhere, I can share it anywhere.\n\nThat really is a nice compromise, and I think it's a similar thing, as you said, with music I can have all my music, have it all available without keeping it all on my phone. So the only drawback is you got to pay for iCloud. Now I have an Apple One subscription which gives me two terabytes. That's probably enough. Yeah, and I like the other benefits of the Apple One subscription, but if you don't mind paying for enough storage in iCloud, I think it's the. It's a perfect solution and it's easy and you've got backup and if you need it, you can get it, because the originals are always available streaming both music and photos, very little fiddling that you have to do versus using a third party where it's got a little more, and this is why apple's in trouble, yeah, and why?\n\napple users love it? Because the ecosystem does lock you in, but it is as seamless as can be. And and I finally you know May 7th the new iPads are coming out. That's this Tuesday. You and I are going to get up at 7 am Eastern Pacific time to watch the video release, but I'm very interested because I think the iPad, especially with this new screen and the AI built in, might be the perfect photo processing solution. Instead of bringing a laptop, just bring that iPad automatically, copy everything from my camera into the iPad, have it stored in the cloud, even if, as I'm traveling, edit it in the iPad with a great screen so I really see what I'm using. I can use the pencil and use my hand. They're going to announce a new pencil too, which might even have some nice new features. I feel like that is a photographer's dream. Yeah, I feel like that is a photographer's dream. So, in a way, what I would say is you've got a really good situation, as long as you're willing to pay for the storage. Did that answer your question?\n\n1:35:04 - Caller\n\nI know we won't Absolutely. It was great information.\n\n1:35:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nI just cannot handle buying a terabyte or two terabytes when all I'm doing is holding data. So perfect answer Two terabytes is 10 bucks a month in the United States. That's more than enough. By the way, you probably depending on how many pictures see, I take a lot of pictures, but for $3 a month you can get 200 gigabytes. And then there's the Apple One subscription, which is what? Is it now 30?\n\n1:35:48 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI think it's $30 a month and you get a whole bunch of other stuff you get two terabytes. You get all this other stuff and you can share that with family too, which I do.\n\n1:35:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's what I do as well I would even be willing to pay for 30 bucks a month for six terabytes. That's probably more storage than anybody would ever need. Yeah, um, and so I think it's a really nice solution. Now, it doesn't help you if you're a Windows users or an Android user. It really is best if you're entirely in the warm bath of the Apple ecosystem, but then you never have to worry. One of the things that Apple was responding to is and I used to get calls like this on the radio show all the time I filled up my iPhone storage it's time to get another one. By the way, 10 years, it's time to get another one. But anyway, you don't have to. You just turn on that thing that says don't, you know, store them in the cloud? Here I'll show you. We'll go to. It's the iCloud settings, am I right?\n\n1:36:48 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYou can find it in two places, or photos. I would go to the photos settings. Okay, am I right? You can find it in?\n\n1:36:52 - Leo Laporte\n\ntwo places, or photos. I would go to the photos settings. Okay, because it really is a great solution for everybody. Let me find photos. This is the bad thing you can never find what you want in the photos. There we go. So if you go to photos, you turn it on. Where is it? There it is. It's a little bright, so I'm going to darken it a little bit so you can see it. So you can see, I'm syncing the phone to iCloud Photos. Now I am using half a gigabyte or half a terabyte, but that means I still have a lot of room left, so maybe I could go with a smaller plan. They don't offer a one terabyte plan, unfortunately, and there it is. There's terabyte plan, unfortunately, um, and there it is. There's the syncing. But this is really what you want. You can choose between downloading and keeping originals on a device with unlimited storage. You know you might want to do that. Nowadays you can get an ipad or an iphone with a terabyte or more. Maybe you'd want to keep the originals.\n\n1:37:45 - Mikah Sargent\n\nKeep the originals on one that's what I was going to say. If you've got one device that has enough space, that is, what I recommend is having the originals on that one.\n\n1:37:53 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd then I have optimized, which means it will only store kind of screen size copies which are pretty small, low res copies on the iPhone, unless I want to edit it.\n\nSo if I go, if I go into photos on the iPhone and this photo is not stored, this is too big a photo to store on the iPhone. But if I decide I want to edit it, it's going to download it and you see, that's, that's it's downloading, and said that, and now I have it and I can edit it, I can play with it if I want. So I have, in effect, the full copy here, even though it doesn't take up that much space until I really want the full copy. This is a raw photo, by the way, so this is every bit of it no compression, not losing any quality as you do with Google Photos. This is perfect. This is just what I want. Now I can play with it and adjust it and do all the things and if I want even more, I can edit it in darkroom, which I think is a wonderful editor. So I'm very happy.\n\n1:38:53 - Mikah Sargent\n\nNow I have an excuse to buy the new iPad. Somebody has to, so we can talk about it.\n\n1:38:56 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, I think we'll get one for you too. Do you want the 11 or the 12?\n\n1:39:00 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWe have to wait and see, don't we?\n\n1:39:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, got to wait and see. We have to see what the options are. Is there a mini? You know we'll see. They are due to do the mini, update the mini. It's been three years but I don't thi"
