How do I change that?\n\nCan I block someone else on Discord?\n\nHow do I connect Club TWiT to my Mastodon or TWiT Community accounts?\n\nOther Questions\n\nWhat's is TWiT+?\n\nWhy are you calling a show \"exclusive\" if you're publishing audio feeds of it for free?\n\nHow do I update my e-mail address or other personal information?\n\nHow do I reset my password?\n\nCan I share Club TWiT podcast feeds with friends?\n\nI still have questions. What should I do?\n\nAccessing Club TWiT\n\nHow do I listen to or watch Club TWiT content?\n\nAfter joining Club TWiT, you can subscribe to any or all of the ad-free Club TWiT podcast feeds. You can listen to or watch using many popular podcast apps including, Apple Podcasts, Pocket Casts, Spotify, Overcast, Castro, and Downcast. Plus, you can use any podcast app that allows you to add a custom RSS feed. You cannot get Club TWiT on YouTube, Stitcher, Amazon Music, PodcastOne, Podomatic, Castbox, nor PodBean. Ad-free episodes cannot be watched on the TWiT.tv website either.\n\nThis video demonstrates how to subscribe to a Club TWiT podcast using a browser on Windows, but the process is similar on a Mac:\n\nHere's another demo of Club TWiT on iOS:\n\nHere's a walkthrough of Club TWiT on Android:\n\nCan I join Club TWiT if I do not live in the US?\n\nYes. Stripe, the payment processor, allows payments from over 40 countries including the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and others. You can find a current list on the Stripe site. Exchange rates are not set by TWiT so subscription rates may vary.\n\nOnce I become a member, am I able to watch past episodes ad-free?\n\nMost shows have at least 100 ad-free episodes in their feeds. TWiT News and TWiT Events aren't published weekly, so there may still be old episodes published in their feeds before April 1, 2021 which may contain ads. Multi-show feeds such as All TWiT.tv Shows or Total Leo have up to 200 episodes in each feed. Shows which are Club TWiT exclusives such as Hands-On Mac, Hands-On Windows, and TWiT+ will have up to 250 episodes in their feeds.\n\nFor comparison, our publicly available ad-supported feeds outside of Club TWiT usually only have ten episodes. (These have always had only 10 episodes going back over a decade before the creation of Club TWiT and the number of episodes in these feeds were not reduced with the creation of Club TWiT.)\n\nIs there a Club TWiT live stream without ads?\n\nNo. TWiT's live stream is not a show and you are watching the shows being produced. Ad reads are still part of the live production. There is no way to skip over ad reads in live production without some sort of time skip into the future. If you are Marty McFly or know how to travel through time, let us know.\n\nYou can watch our live stream during the production of most of our shows. You'll find the live stream in our members-only Discord. Look for it under \"Live\" and click on \"Live Stage\". If we're recording a show, you'll see live video. (Sorry, single-show subscribers don't have Discord access.)\n\nCan I get Club TWiT in my favorite podcast app?\n\nSome podcast apps don't support video podcasts and some don't support private podcast feeds such as Club TWiT. We have a list of some of the most popular podcast apps which outlines which features are supported. You can find the list here.\n\nCan I watch Club TWiT with an Apple TV box?\n\nIf you subscribe to Club TWiT's podcast feeds using the Apple Podcasts app on iOS, macOS, or iPadOS, you can then access your podcast library via the Podcast app on Apple TV. (Make sure your Apple TV is logged in to the same account as the Apple Podcasts app you subscribed with on iOS, macOS, or iPadOS. It may take a couple minutes to sync your podcast library.)\n\nThere is no Club TWiT app for Apple TV and existing TWiT apps do not have Club TWiT content.\n\nAlternatively, you could also use AirPlay to stream the Club TWiT podcasts to your Apple TV from your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. (Results may vary based on your home network speeds.)\n\nCan I watch Club TWiT with Roku?\n\nUnfortunately, we have been unable to find any decent third-party podcast apps for Roku which allow for playing TWiT podcasts or Club TWiT content.\n\nIf you are able to play media files on your Roku using Play on Roku, AirPlay, screen mirroring, or casting, you may also be able to play Club TWiT content using the same method. (Results may vary based on your home network speeds.)\n\nCan I listen to Club TWiT with Alexa devices?\n\nUnfortunately, we are currently unaware of any methods to listen to Club TWiT podcasts on Alexa.\n\nHow can I watch Club TWiT video feeds on Windows?\n\nVLC and gPodder are two free options you may consider to watch Club TWiT content on Windows. Pocket Casts Plus also offers a desktop version for Windows as well as a web app, but there is a monthly or yearly fee.\n\nThis video demonstrates how to subscribe to Club TWiT podcasts using VLC:\n\nDoes Club TWiT work via VPN?\n\nYes. We are not blocking any VPNs from our podcast feeds or downloads on our end. Note that some NordVPN users have had trouble downloading our content.\n\nDoes Club TWiT work with ad blockers active?\n\nIt should. As long as your ad blocker is not blocking twit.tv or cachefly.net domains, you should not have any issues. There are no third-party advertiser tracking redirects in the Club TWiT feeds because there are no ads to track!\n\nPayment Questions\n\nHow can I update my payment info?\n\nLog into your account, go to the Update Card page, add the new card, and click \"Update my card.\"\n\nWhy was my payment declined?\n\nCheck your credit card payment information here. If the information is correct and you don't know why your payment was declined, you may need to contact your credit card issuer and tell them that this charge is approved.\n\nCan I pay with PayPal?\n\nClub TWiT uses Stripe as its payment processor and they do not accept PayPal. Stripe accepts Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, JCB and can also accept payment via Apple Pay (via Safari in iOS) and Google Pay (via Chrome on Android). (We've heard from members that you can use PayPal as a payment method inside Google Pay...so that's an option if you can use Google Pay.)\n\nI live outside the US. Can I pay in my local currency?\n\nWe're aware that some banks may charge high fees for transactions in US dollars. Club TWiT uses Stripe as its payment processor and all Club TWiT subscriptions are purchased and processed in US dollars. We are unable to offer subscriptions in alternate currencies. You will need to consult with your credit card issuer as to what fees you may incur.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of other ways to support TWiT.tv. Please check out our blog post which lists many alternative ways to contribute to our network.\n\nDoes my membership automatically renew?\n\nYes, but you can easily turn off auto-renew in your account dashboard.\n\nCan I give a subscription as a gift?\n\nYes, it's easy to order a gift membership. Visit the Club TWiT page and select \"Gift a Month of Club TWiT\". On the window that pops up, enter the recipient's name, email address, the date for delivery, and pay for it. The recipient will receive an email with a link to activate their gift. Please note that you're purchasing a one-time gift for just one month. The recipient will be responsible for adding a payment method before the renewal period if they'd like to continue the subscription. Or, you can repeat the gifting process to extend the gift subscription.\n\nIf you gift a subscription to someone who already has a subscription, you will extend their existing subscription.\n\nCan I donate more per month to help TWiT?\n\nEvery Club TWiT plan allows you to increase the amount of your payment in case you feel like contributing more toward TWiT. Any additional amount is always appreciated and goes toward the production of our shows. If you are on the Corporate or Family Plan, you can always purchase additional seats and give them out to family or friends.\n\nIf you'd prefer to make a one-time donation, you can purchase a gift subscription and give it to a friend or even a random fan.\n\nHow do I cancel my membership?\n\nLog into your account and toggle auto-renew off from the Subscriptions section. Your subscription will end when it is not renewed. Please note that we do not offer pro-rated refunds mid-subscription period.\n\nIf you decide to renew at a later date, we'd be glad to have you back. We recommend re-activating your membership subscription with the same email address which you originally used because creating a new account which uses the same Discord username as your previous account has been found to occasionally confuse the system.\n\nIf you want to end your membership subscription, DO NOT initiate a chargeback with your credit card provider. If you have a problem with a charge, PLEASE CONTACT US FIRST! We can be reached at membersupport@twit.tv. Anyone attempting a chargeback may be banned permanently from Club TWiT.\n\nPlan Differences\n\nWhat are the differences between plans?\n\nRefer to this chart to see a comparison between various plans and their features.\n\nHow do I switch plans?\n\nClick \"Change plan\" from the Subscriptions menu item in your account. You'll be switched to the new plan immediately and charged a prorated amount.\n\nNote that if you downgrade to a single-show plan, you will only get you access to ad-free podcast subscriptions for the audio and video versions of that show and only that one show. You do not get ad-free access to any other shows, the Club TWiT Discord, or other exclusive Club TWiT content such as the TWiT+ feeds. Those benefits are only available to full Club TWiT members.\n\nWhat's different about the Family Plan?\n\nThe Family Plan was created for families or households with multiple TWiT fans. It offers you a reduced price for the same great content. The plan starts with a minimum of two members at a discounted rate of $6 per month for each member and can have up to ten members. You could set up an account for your spouse, your kids, or your parents. And just like regular memberships, they can all join the TWiT Discord server with their own individual Discord accounts.\n\nWhat's different about the Corporate Plan?\n\nThe Corporate Plan is a great way to give your team access to our ad-free tech podcasts. The plan starts with a minimum of five members at a discounted rate of $6 per month for each member and can have as many seats as you'd like. This is a great way for your IT department, developers, and tech teams to stay up to date with access to all of our podcasts. And just like regular memberships, they can all join the TWiT Discord server, get the TWiT+ feed, and get exclusive video podcast feeds such Hands-On Mac, Hands-On Windows, and Untitled Linux Show.\n\nAnnual payments are also available for the Corporate Plan (and only the Corporate Plan).\n\nWhat's the difference between Club TWiT and Apple Podcasts ad-free?\n\nOn Apple Podcasts, you can subscribe to one of our podcasts, without ads, for $2.99 per month per show. These are the audio-only versions and can only be listened to with Apple Podcasts. This is outside of Club TWiT so you do not get access to our Discord server, the TWiT+ feed, nor any other exclusive Club TWiT content.\n\nNote that the Club TWiT single-show plans also cost $2.99 per month per show, but will give you access to the video version and are not limited to the Apple Podcasts app.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nWhy can't I log into the site?\n\nMake sure you're trying to log in here. If you're having difficulty, check your browser's security settings. Our membership site won't work if you've disabled third-party cookies. Please change your settings or use another browser.\n\nIf I've signed up for Club TWiT, why am I still getting ads in my podcast feeds?\n\nYou are likely still subscribed to the public podcast feeds and need to re-subscribe to the Club TWiT version of your favorite shows. Ad-free episodes are only available in the members-only Club TWiT podcast feeds. You can subscribe to those by accessing the Members Podcasts page. Once you're there, select the podcast you want to subscribe to, select your podcast player of choice, and follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nIf your preferred player isn't listed, you can copy the link at the bottom, load your podcast app, find the option to add a podcast manually or add a show by URL, and paste that link into your podcast app. The process for manually adding a podcast URL will vary depending on the app you're using. Unfortunately, Stitcher, Amazon Music, PodcastOne, Podomatic, Castbox, and PodBean do not support this feature.\n\nIf you're still hearing an ad after subscribing to Club TWiT feeds, it's possible that one of the ads accidentally got left in. (We're only human!) Contact membersupport@twit.tv and let us know so we can get that corrected right away!\n\nWhy don't the video feeds work in Google Podcasts or some other podcast apps?\n\nSome podcast apps only work with audio podcasts. Google Podcasts, Spotify, Player FM, Breaker, and Overcast are examples of audio-only podcast apps. Apple Podcasts, Pocket Casts, Downcast, and Podcast Addict are some podcast apps that work with audio and video podcasts. Stitcher, Amazon Music, PodcastOne, Podomatic, Castbox, and PodBean do not allow users to add new podcast feeds, so neither audio nor video Club TWiT feeds can be played with those apps. (Note that Google Podcasts does not have an auto-download feature for private feeds such as Club TWiT feeds. Also, Google discontinued Google Podcasts in 2024 so we urge you to use a different podcast app.)\n\nWhy do I get an error when trying to subscribe with Pocket Casts?\n\nThis is a known issue on Pocket Casts's app. We've been talking with them and they've been looking into it and have determined it's a caching issue, but the problem has not been fully resolved yet. The only known workaround is to keep trying. Sometimes it might work on the second try and sometimes it might work after several more tries. It will work eventually though, so have a little patience and keep trying. If you continue having issues, you may wish to contact Pocket Casts' support team.\n\nWhen a member's subscription lapses, their private feeds will no longer be accessible. If they remain inaccessible for 3+ months, Pocket Casts will stop trying to refresh them — even if the member re-subscribes. To fix this on Android, go to the podcast, go into settings for that podcast, and click the \"Fix Issues\" button. If that doesn't work or you're on iOS and the \"Fix Issues\" button isn't there, contact Pocket Casts' support team.\n\nAlternatively, you can work around the issue by copying the RSS URL for that show's feed, add &fix=12345 (or other random numbers) to the end, and subscribe to the podcast at that new URL. Pocket Casts will see it as a different URL and it will get new content.\n\nDiscord\n\nHow do I log into Discord?\n\nIf you're interested in joining our Discord server, visit the Discord Authorization page to authorize Memberful to add you to our Discord server and set your role. Be sure to use the same email address you used when signing up for Club TWiT. After you've authorized access to Discord once, you can get back in by opening your Discord app or visiting Discord.com and you will find TWiT in your list of servers. Discord access is not available with single-show subscription plans.\n\nHow do I use Discord?\n\nDiscord can have a bit of a learning curve if you're unfamiliar with it. You may find the Beginner's Guide to Discord helpful. TWiT has its own Discord server which you can join as a member of Club TWiT, so don't worry about any instructions about setting up a server of your own.\n\nWhy is the Discord video so small?\n\nWhen you first load the Live Stage, it defaults to a small video display. Simply click on the video itself and you'll get a larger size. Click again for an even larger size.\n\nIf you're on a desktop or laptop and not a phone or tablet, you may also wish to use the icon in the lower right which has a box and an arrow pointing up to the right. This will pop the video out into its own window. Doing this, you can keep watching the Live Stage while viewing other tabs in your browser and move the video to any place on your computer's desktop.\n\nHow can I watch the Discord Live Stage on my TV?\n\nIf you are using an AirPlay-compatible device such as an Apple TV, some Roku devices, and some smart televisions and have a device such as a Mac that can stream to AirPlay devices, you are able to watch the video from Discord's Live Stage on your TV. We have put together a step-by-step guide on how to do this.\n\nI have two Discord accounts and accidentally authorized the wrong one. How do I change that?\n\nWe've seen this happen if someone is logged in to the wrong Discord account in their browser and they click the \"authorize\" link. If this happens, log out of both Discord accounts and then click the Discord \"authorize\" link. Next, in your browser, log in with the proper Discord account and allow the Memberful Bot permission to access your account. Doing this will revoke access from the other account and give the Discord access to the proper account. If you use the Discord desktop app, authorize the Memberful Bot in your browser before using the app. You will not be able to post in Discord unless the Memberful Bot has been authorized.\n\nCan I block someone else on Discord?\n\nIf there is someone else on Discord whose messages you would prefer not to see, you can block them. On a desktop, right-click on their name and select \"Block\" from the menu. On the mobile app, tap the profile picture of the person, the three dots in the top-right corner of the menu that opens, and then \"Block\" when it appears. When someone is blocked, all their messages will be hidden for you. A blocked user will still be able to read your messages and see when you're online. When you block someone, that user won't be sent any alert or notification that you did so. If they try to message you, they'll receive a generic error message which suggests that you are only accepting messages from friends.\n\nHow do I connect Club TWiT to my Mastodon or TWiT Community accounts?\n\nThese are separate systems with no connection to each other. It's not possible to do this. All TWiT fans are welcome on TWiT.social (TWiT's Mastodon) or in the TWiT Community forums.\n\nOther Questions\n\nWhat is TWiT+?\n\nTWiT+ is the bonus feed for members that is included as a part of Club TWiT. This feed includes exclusive content only available to members. If you're a member of Club TWiT, you can subscribe to the TWiT+ feed on the Members Podcasts page. TWiT+ is not available with single-show subscription plans.\n\nWhy are you calling a show \"exclusive\" if you're publishing audio feeds of it for free?\n\nThese shows were formerly completely exclusive except for occasional episode which would be released as a sample. Starting in February 2024, we've decided to release the audio only for all episodes and these public feeds will include dynamically inserted ads. If anyone wants the ad-free audio or the video, they'll need to join Club TWiT.\n\nLog in to your account to make these changes.\n\nHow do I reset my password?\n\nPasswords are not required for your membership account. Instead, visit our sign in form, enter your email address, and click the \"Send sign in link\" button. We'll send you an email with a link that you can click to sign in. The link can only be used once and expires after 24 hours.\n\nIf you prefer to create a password, you can do so after you sign up for a membership. If you ever need to reset your password, click this link, enter your email address, and then click \"Send me reset instructions.\" Password reset links automatically expire after 48 hours. If the link becomes invalid, repeat the process for a fresh password reset link.\n\nCan I share Club TWiT podcast feeds with friends?\n\nClub TWiT feeds are dynamically generated and contain unique codes for each Club TWiT member. These feeds are automatically monitored and any that have suspicious activity may be disabled. Your podcast feed URLs are unique to you and should not be shared with anyone outside your household. Your Club TWiT feeds will contain \"Private to [Your Name]\" in the title.\n\nUnlike TWiT's public content (with ads), Club TWiT content is copyrighted content, not covered by Creative Commons, should not be shared with others and should not be uploaded to other services."
