        "text": "The TWiT Brick House is the name of the TWiT Studios in Petaluma California. Almost all of the Netcasts on the TWiT network are recorded there.\n\nThe TWiT Brick House replaced the former TWiT studio, The TWiT Cottage, which had housed all of TWiTs shows since 2005.\n\nThe new building cost in excess of US$1.2 million. It took over 7 months for the Studio to be built and be ready to be used for broadcasting. The first show that was broadcast from the TWiT Brick House was TWiT 311 on July 24, 2011.\n\nInfo\n\nLocation\n\nAddress: 140 Keller St., Petaluma, CA, USA (Google Maps)\n\n9400 sq. ft. (873 sq. m) (upstairs)\n\n6000 sq. ft. (557 sq. m) (downstairs basement)\n\nStudio Audience\n\nIf you want to visit the Brick House and be in the studio audience, email tickets@twit.tv. 20 to 30 audience members can be accommodated. Shows in Leo's office have room for up to 8 audience members. Visitors will be required to sign a waiver. Refer to our Tickets page for more information.\n\nFloor Plans\n\nFirst Floor\n\nThe Bricks in the front foyer of the TWiT Brickhouse\n\nTWiT sold personalized bricks in the entrance lobby as a fundraiser.\n\nSets:\n\nLeo's studio/office, modelled to be like the old TWiT Cottage\n\nNewsroom\n\nThe round table\n\nThe living room\n\nSky box elevated set\n\nRadio Corner (Leo's Ham Station and an antique AM transmitter and mixing board)\n\nAnother glassed in office for Lisa Laporte, CEO of TWiT\n\nThree other offices off of the studio room\n\nA room for editors\n\nA room for producers\n\nA large kitchen/dining area\n\nA reception area with the brick Wall of Honor\n\nA conference room\n\nA loading dock with conveyor belt to the basement which is used as \"Studio B\" for offline recording\n\nA large green screen studio with cyclorama\n\nBasement\n\nThe fire sprinklers in the basement are too low for the space to be up to code as an office area. The equipment necessary to make TWiT happen (the Tricaster, audio and video processing equipment, Streamomatic, etc) is stored in the basement, with only the control surfaces upstairs. This keeps the noisy, heat-generating equipment off the sets.\n\nThe hosts of Know How have established a \"Know Hole\" in the basement with space for working on projects for the show.\n\nThe basement is also used for storage.\n\nTrivia\n\nThe name \"The Brick TWiT House\" was thought up by Dick DeBartolo in a Daily Giz Wiz episode where Leo and Dick were pondering a new name to replace \"The TWiT Cottage\". Leo described the new place as being a brick building as opposed to the wood-based TWiT Cottage.\n\nThe building is the former home of BiAS Sound. The building has also served as a drug store, and was originally built as a furniture factory.\n\nThe set was designed by Roger C. Ambrose (known for the \"arches\" Screen Savers set)\n\nLeo's \"Dr. Evil\" chair on the round table set is from Restoration Hardware.\n\nThe TWiT Brick House is just under two blocks away from the former TWiT studio, The TWiT Cottage.\n\nThe first show broadcast from the TWiT Brick House was TWiT 311 on July 24, 2011.\n\nThe new building cost US$1.2 million\n\nWalk Throughs and Images\n\nCheck out the new digs at Google Street View"
