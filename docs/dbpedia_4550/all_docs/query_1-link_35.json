The network began operation in April 2005 with the launch of This Week in Tech. Security Now was the second podcast on the network, debuting in August of that year. Currently, the network hosts twenty-two podcasts and live streaming shows, including The Tech Guy, This Week in Tech, Security Now, FLOSS Weekly, MacBreak Weekly, Tech News Today, Tech News 2Night, and 15 other podcasts covering various topics including technology companies, computer security, social networking, Ham Radio and current technology news.[1]\n\nTWiT founder and owner Laporte, in an October 2009 speech, stated that it grossed revenues of $1.5 million per year, while costs were around $350,000.[2] In November 2014, American Public Media's Marketplace reported that TWiT makes $6 million in ad revenue a year from 5 million TWiT podcasts downloaded each month, mostly in the form of audio, and that 3,000 to 4,000 people watch its live-streamed shows.[3] On March 18, 2015, prior to the filming of This Week in Google, Leo Laporte stated that TWiT expects to make $7 million in revenue in fiscal year 2015, and made \"just under\" $10 million in revenue in 2016.[4]\n\nTWiT gets its name from its first and flagship podcast, This Week in Tech. The logo design originated from a traditional logic gate symbol of an \"AND gate\" turned on its side. Voiceovers are provided by Jim Cutler.[5]\n\nProgramming [edit | edit source]\n\nTWiT's netcasts are centered around technology and technology news. Hosts of the shows are usually experts in certain fields, either by working in the field itself or by being a journalist covering the field. At the beginning of 2014, there were 27 podcasts produced by TWiT,[6] but that was cut to only 22 shows in 2015.[6] Giz Wiz, Marketing Mavericks and Padre's Corner were among the shows that were cancelled during the year.\n\nThe New Screen Savers was the only new show added to the network in 2015, a show based on The Screen Savers, an American TV show that aired on TechTV from 1998 to 2005.[7]\n\nTWiT further cut their field of self-produced shows by nearly twenty percent in late 2015. Among the shows cut were Coding 101, which was replaced with a second weekly episode of Know How. iFive for the iPhone was cancelled, with some of that content being folded into iOS Today. Before You Buy was also dropped, with its last episode being produced on December 18, 2015. With the departure of news director Mike Elgan in December 2015, TWiT also cancelled Tech News 2Night. Hosts Megan Morrone and Jason Howell took over Tech News Today on a daily basis at 4PM each weekday, starting on January 4, 2016.[8] No new news director has been named.\n\nNathan Olivarez-Giles was brought in as a co-host and producer in March 2017[9], with the prospect of developing new shows including an automotive-related podcast[10]. By July, no new shows were developed, and Olivarez-Giles was unceremoniously dropped from the network. Editor Tony Wang, TD Kara Kohl, producer Tonya Hall[11] and on-air talent Bryan Burnett[12] were also let go over the summer of 2017. In May 2017, Android App Arena was also dropped.[13] In October 2017, Home Theater Geeks was canceled and Know How was changed to a weekly show. Tech News Today was renamed Tech News Weekly and was changed from a daily to a weekly show.[14]\n\nDescription[edit | edit source]\n\nAll the shows are available free to watch or download from the TWiT.tv website and are funded by cost per mille embedded sponsorship.[15] They are filmed in their studio in Petaluma, California of which the live aspect is based around a NewTek Tricaster production system. The shows have a history of making heavy-use of remote hosts and guests connecting in via Skype.\n\nRevenue[edit | edit source]\n\nThis Week in Tech Episode 561 on May 8, 2016 had extensive talk about podcast revenue. In the episode, Leo Laporte said a recent NY York Times article stated that podcasts ad revenue was $57 million per year and \"If that's true, then I actually own 25% of all of the podcasting revenue in the world.\" This would put TWIT ad revenue around $13â€“14 million per year.[16]\n\nOn This week in Google Leo said that they had $10 million in revenue in 2016.[17]\n\nLitigation[edit | edit source]\n\nIn May 2017, Twitter announced that it would deliver original video content on its platform. Lawyers from TWiT believed this violated a spoken agreement between Leo Laporte and Twitter co-founder Evan Williams made in 2009, and infringed on TWiT's trademark. TWiT tried to informally solve the trademark issue, and in January 2018 filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Twitter.[18]\n\nAwards[edit | edit source]\n\nThis Week in Tech was the recipient of the 2005, 2008, and 2010 People's Choice Podcast Awards Technology category.[19]\n\nTech News Today was the recipient of the 2012 International Academy of Web Television award for Best News Web Series.[20]\n\nThis Week in Computer Hardware, Home Theater Geeks, NSFW, This Week in Tech, MacBreak Weekly, TWiT Live Specials, iPad Today, Tech News Today, The Tech Guy, This Week in Google, and Windows Weekly were named \"Best of 2010 in Podcasts\" by iTunes Rewind.[21]\n\nIn 2011, This Week in Tech was named \"Best Technology Podcast\", and TWiT Photo was named \"Best New Technology Podcast\" by iTunes Rewind.[22]\n\nSee also[edit | edit source]\n\nThis Week in Tech\n\nReferences[edit | edit source]\n\n[edit | edit source]"
