Twitter. Twi twi guy <laugh>.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:03:58):\n\nI I will say also longer time listener too, because I do remember when you started this whole thing, Leo, cuz I was coming off of being a fan of you on Twitter TV and every, and the tech TV and everything. So\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:07):\n\nYou, you always mention that. And you make me bless the time. You also make me, I\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:04:11):\n\nAlso wanna say it is yeah, it is also nice to feel like the youngin in a discussion once again. Cause I'm not getting that anymore.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:18):\n\nNot, not an un gadget anymore. No. There's a lot of, Yeah. You know, this was, they always said, you know, when the cops seem like they're younger than you, then, you know, you're old and it's, the cops are like, they're like teenagers. Who are these people?\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:04:31):\n\nOh yeah, absolutely.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:31):\n\nThey're teenagers now. He is a teenager in spirit. Mr. Phillip Elmer Dewitt wearing his cap cuz he's so hip. P e d thirty.com, because I'm so bald. That's what <laugh>, keeping the hand warm. He is just down the road from my mom. So wave at her in Cranston. Good to, good to have you on the show again. Great, great to see you. Yeah, good to see you. I think Phillip's been on our show since you were with Fortune, I think. Format. Yeah. Not, I don't think we did it when I was at time. I feel like we did, but maybe not. You know, it's easy to go, easy to find out when you go to twit tv. Twit.Tv <laugh> you can search for somebody's name. Oops. I if you do it right, you could search for somebody. There we go. Okay. And the search Elmer,\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:05:28):\n\nI love this feature, by the way.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:05:29):\n\nAnd, and then you'll find them. You click their name and then this is the feature view appearances. So I can see every time you've appeared on our show, by the way, the database is churning, so it's <laugh> it's been it's been a while here. Let's, let's go back in time. I can find your first appearance was 2014. No, that doesn't seem right, but maybe so. Eight years. Oh. And look who was on with you. Eli Patel. I don't know who that other guy is. What a great piece he wrote about <laugh>, about mothers. Okay, let's talk about that. That was the best piece, wasn't it? Welcome mm-hmm. <Affirmative>. Mm-hmm. <Affirmative> to hell. Elon <laugh>. I think, I mean, many, many things have been written about Elon Musk buying Twitter. Who would've thought that, by the way, six months ago, <laugh>, he fought a tooth and nail.\n\n(00:06:21):\n\nHe did not want to buy Twitter. Right? Well, his joke was, Well, he did. And then changed his mind. Yeah. Well, he did Bri like, like for five minutes, agreed to it without any due diligence. And then almost instantly back in April was writing his lawyer saying, Can we hold off on this? That his excuse then was, Putin's gonna speak and I don't wanna own Twitter. During World War three, <laugh>, this is what happens when the troll faces their consequences. Yeah. It's it's a beautiful thing to see. But I think maybe even Elon underestimated the consequences. And now that he owns Twitter, it's going to, it's gonna get real as the kids say, Eli's piece, welcome to hell Elon subtitled. You break it, you buy it. You ft up real good kiddo. Twitter is, I'm reading. Twitter is a disaster clown car company that is successful despite itself.\n\n(00:07:17):\n\nAnd this is the salient point. And there is no possible way to grow users in revenue without making a series of enormous compromises that will ultimately destroy your reputation and possibly cause grievous damage to your other companies. And that's just the first paragraph. <Laugh>. Okay. Re read the bit about moderation. Yeah, cuz I think he, he makes the really excellent point. People think, Oh, and I think Elon thinks based on his immediate actions, that the product of Twitter is code or engineering or even the users. Eli says the essential truth of every social network is the product. The product is content moderation, whether it's YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, The, you have people's posts, but it's how you control it, Moderate it, offer it up to the users. That's what you're getting from Twitter. And he says, and every, and this is important. Everyone hates the people who decide how content moderation works.\n\n(00:08:23):\n\nIt's a no win. Content moderation is what Twitter makes. It is the thing that defines the user experience. It's what YouTube makes. It's what Instagram makes. It's what TikTok makes. They all try to incentivize good stuff, disincentivize bad stuff, and delete the really bad stuff. He says, that's the business you're in now, Elon, the longer you fight it or pretend that you can sell something else, the more Twitter will drag you into the deepest possible muck of defending indefensible speech. And if you turn on a dime and accept that growth requires aggressive content moderation and pushing back against government speech regulations around the country. And by the way, and he makes this point really important, not just to us around the world. Elon's got big business in China with Tesla. Is he gonna listen to Chinese regulators about Twitter? He is. We'll see how your fans react when you do that. Anyway, anyhow, Any who writes neon? Well, Nele <laugh>, welcome to hell. This was your idea. Philip, what do you think?\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:09:33):\n\nWell, first of all he's right about content moderation. I, I've done it four or five different venues. This one, I solved it by requiring people to pay. You\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:45):\n\nKnow, you, you nailed it. When we, our discord, which is for club only, we don't have to moderate at all. There are no moderators. Cause\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:09:52):\n\nPeople pay for it because Right. And also only real names with a few exceptions. You know, because they're,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:10:00):\n\nI we don't do that. I don't need to do that. I don't think, I just, the fact that somebody paid seven bucks to be there, it doesn't have to. It's a one buck wouldn't ma it just doesn't. A little bit. Just a little bit.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:10:11):\n\nYep. Yep. My other thought is Musk is often compared to Steve Jobs. I hear that a lot. And, and what the thing about Steve Jobs is he was such an, when he was first at Apple and, and then he got pushed out. And then, you know, he was out in the desert for a long time and he learned a lot. And by the time he came back to Apple having, you know, failed at next he was a different person. And he was, he was brilliant. And we were all, we were all the benefits of what Steve Jobs did after he learned the big lesson. Well, Musk hasn't learned anything that I can tell except, you know, he makes good products and he knows how to take on big challenges and how to attract talent and that kind of stuff. But, but I think Twi may be his Waterloo or\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:00):\n\nTwitter plays. Twitter. Twitter. It's the gun already. I'm the chief twit now. Go ahead. I'm sorry. <Laugh>.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:11:08):\n\nWell, this, this, this seems insolvable what he's up against. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:13):\n\nThat was NE's point is you can't win these. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:11:16):\n\nHe's stuck. And it'll be interesting to see if what comes out of this and if he comes out of it he's got a lot at stake, all of all, you know, he may be the richest guy in the world, but that can go really quickly.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:34):\n\nThere was the best, I would say the best Steve Jobs's biography is not the Walter Isis and although it's worth reading, but the, the one that talks about how Steve changed after getting kicked outta Apple, and I'm trying to remember who wrote that, but it was easily the best one. I have it right on the show. Yeah. He was a fortune guy. Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. and, and that was, to me, that was the most interesting story, was that you could take a guy who really, you're right, was a jerk and became somebody much better. He is called Brett Brett Slender, Brett Slender, and Rick Tetzel, who I think were, weren't they at the Seattle Times? Anyway, becoming Steve Jobs, the evolution of a reckless upstart into a visionary leader.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:12:27):\n\nEven though there, there's still so many stories of him being an asshole after that. Do\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:30):\n\nYou? Oh, he didn't stop.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:12:31):\n\nYou know. Yeah. Yeah. And in a way, just the more successful one, I guess\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:34):\n\nIn a way, Steve has given permission to a whole <laugh> series of Yeah, absolutely. Famous terrible leaders. Or maybe I often wonder this. They've always been that way. Edison was an ass. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Henry Ford was the worst, but they didn't have\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:12:51):\n\nTo. It's still like myth of genius. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:53):\n\nMm-Hmm. <affirmative>, they didn't have Twitter. We didn't know. We really know now about our, our guys. So Devendra Are you gonna leave Twitter?\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:13:04):\n\nYou know, I, I've certainly been thinking about it. I was a Twitter blue subscriber and I am no longer that because I don't wanna give you on any money. But this is, this is kind of a sad story, you know, this whole thing. First of all, I was championing this Neli piece because I feel like it channeled all the rage I'm feeling. And a lot of other people are feeling I could, I could almost like see him like writing that with pure rage fuel. Because everything he's saying is absolutely true. I think normally I would I would kind of embrace watching Elon just kind of drown himself in a really bad decision. But at the same time, I think Twitter is so, it, it is my favorite social network. It's such an essential part of the way I use the internet. It is terribly sad to see it kind of go down this way because we're seeing the effects of what's happening now. Immediately a lot of people who were banned and kicked off we're, we're kind of welcomed back onto Twitter. Is that true? Cuz I know that Kyle Written House has reactivated his account Oh. And has been very public about like, the worst of\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:02):\n\nThe worst, A murderer and who got away with murder. Yep. And then Now's Championed,\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:14:09):\n\nChampioned is a total celebrity for, for many folks. But also the rise of hate speech. Like, incredible rise of hate speech. Like, people are just like out there celebrating this. And it, it's sad to see, because I think when I started using the internet in the mid nineties, like I've always envisioned, like having direct access to everything happening in the world. And I feel like Twitter is the most kind of like most successful product that can give us that, that can connect me with people instantly, even if I don't know them. It is so much more public facing than Facebook or anything else. And it's, it's gonna die. It's gonna die because of one billionaire's toilet tweet decision basically to, to, to buy this thing. Like, Oh, wouldn't this be funny? It's, it's maddening. It's infuriating.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:49):\n\nThere was some debate about whether Kanye got his, his account was never kicked off. He just was silenced. Yeah. And I was a temporary ban. Yeah. A temporary suspension. Yeah. So, I don't know. And, and Elon says I had nothing to do with that. But Kyle ridden house, by the way, look at this guy's. This is a terrifying profile picture of him with an automatic rifle sitting in a helicopter looking out the, the door, the open door, apparently ready to, to take, you know, action against anybody he disagrees with. And his banner is him actually shooting out that door with the American flag behind him. That is not a guy you wanna celebrate. Not at all. And so that's scary. But I, on the other hand, I have, I'm still a Twitter Blue Pay payer, and I'm, I'm withholding judgment. I, I want to give <laugh>, I don't know.\n\n(00:15:38):\n\nI want to give it a chance. I like you. I don't wanna lose Twitter. I le I've left and come back a couple of times cuz Twitter has always been a bit of a cesspool. But there is such a value to it. As a, when Queen Elizabeth passed away mm-hmm. <Affirmative> her family, normally what was supposed to happen is the BBC would play somber music and do an announcement. Then they put an announcement on the Palace gates. No, it was a tweet. The family tweeted it before the bbc before anybody. I mean, that sh in a nutshell, kind of, Twitter's not the town square, but it has, it's, there's what does it talk about Twitter that's important.\n\nDoc Searls (00:16:17):\n\nYeah. Twitter's a news router. That's basically the biggest function of it. I'm not gonna leave it. I'm pleased enough with it there. The angle on, on Elon I haven't heard, I haven't read much about yet, is that this is his first acquisition. You know, he, he kind of built, you know, Tesla from the ground up. He built SpaceX in the ground up. Starlink. No.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:40):\n\nHe acquired both\n\nDoc Searls (00:16:41):\n\nThese\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:41):\n\nOther hat. He admire Tesla acquired Tesla,\n\nDoc Searls (00:16:43):\n\nHe acquired Tesla. Yeah. But still itt, I mean, it it's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:45):\n\nThe Tesla we know today. It was,\n\nDoc Searls (00:16:47):\n\nIt was the Tesla we know today. And, and I mean, I, I give a giant hats off to him for the, for the original stuff that he's done with those, with those companies. And I agree that he, he kind of bought this thing on a lark, I mean, and, and, and got stuck with it. And I agree with everything Dai says as well. I think there's the, the odds are really against him making it work. I actually wonder whether social media, as we know it now, is already kind of stale. It's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:12):\n\nPretty damaged, isn't it? Absolutely.\n\nDoc Searls (00:17:13):\n\nIt's really, it's really old. It's old stuff. And, and I'm not sure the new stuff that we really want or need is here yet either, so mm-hmm. <Affirmative> we're, you know, the older I get, the earlier it seems, and we've only had the internet in its current form where it's commercial. The commercial internet since really? April 30th, 1995. It's 27 years ago. What\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:33):\n\nHappened on April 30th in nine? I know, but\n\nDoc Searls (00:17:36):\n\nTelephone, The nsf Yeah, the NSF that the NSF that shut down. It was the, one\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:40):\n\nOf the, the internet was originally funded by the US government and run by the National Science Foundation in\n\nDoc Searls (00:17:47):\n\n1995. Yeah. The National Science Foundation, it's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:49):\n\nAll yours\n\nDoc Searls (00:17:50):\n\nIn the, they said they had an acceptable use policy that aup they call it exactly the acceptable use policy. And, and, and it forbid commercial activity. There was some commercial activity, they weren't able to police it or anything. But as soon as that went down, Amazon explodes, eBay, explodes, ISPs everywhere. You know, it was just suddenly we had the beginning formation of what we have now. It's kind of like, you know, we entered the, you know, a geologic era where life exploded and <laugh> that's what the camera 47 years a can explosion. Yeah. It was, I mean, I remember the dinosaur days of the web. Yeah. You remember at her old microbes, you know, But, but but I, I, I have to say, I mean, I, I have very mixed feelings about Twitter in a way because I was a very active blogger and and an early blogger. And I had up to 50,000 readers a day on my blog. And Twitter came along, Facebook came along. It was down to dozens in about a year. And so you didn't stop everybody. For\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:50):\n\nMe, I stopped blogging cuz I, I got that itch scratched by Twitter. You didn't stop blogging, your readers stopped reading.\n\nDoc Searls (00:18:57):\n\nMm. Yeah. And, and my companions, if you look at my old blog, it's still up. It's a slightly different url, but it's there. It's preserved. There's a blog roll. Everybody had a blog roll underwrite. It was, it was a social network, but it was a really small one, you know, And Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:14):\n\nThat's right. Every\n\nDoc Searls (00:19:14):\n\nBlog, most of those\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:15):\n\nMost other blogs.\n\nDoc Searls (00:19:17):\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. We cross, you know, we cross pollinated a lot. That's not the one that, the one that's showing up.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:22):\n\nThis is your Harvard, this is your Harvard blog. What?\n\nDoc Searls (00:19:24):\n\nWhere's the, This is the one that's host How's hosted at Harvard? I wouldn't call it a Harvard blog, but it is, it's, it's been hosted there. I moved there after from the other one. I'll put the other one in. There's a link in there. So this\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:35):\n\nIs just your general webpage?\n\nDoc Searls (00:19:37):\n\nYeah. That's by the way, nothing part\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:39):\n\nOf the problem. You and I, everybody has 800 different places.\n\nDoc Searls (00:19:43):\n\nWell, you know, the funny thing is that's a, if you could just go toss.com Yeah. That HTML has been there since 1995. You know, like it Yeah. It looks like that's what it is. I mean, it's the, the art is, is new. It was drawn by a friend a few years ago, but I think it's weblog doys.com. That's the short, short link to it. But there's a blog role on that. And most people, Yeah, some of them are still there, but most of them left and most of them went to Facebook and Twitter. And there's some brilliant people writing now on Facebook. And it's all what I call snow on the water. It all kind of floats down, hits the water, and is gone. And, and I just think it's a lousy way for people to be smart and mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, there have to be better ways. And Twitter fills a, an essential role, I think for as, as a news router. Yeah. You know? Yeah. And people call it a spool, but, you know, I, I follow 5,000 people on Twitter. I see no politics cuz they don't respond to any <laugh>. You know, So, So by not responding to politics and not playing politic, not doing any political blogging, I mean, I mean tweeting, I kind of relieve myself of that stuff, so mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, it's kind of interesting that way, the way, you know, following works, but having follow\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:20:57):\n\nPeople can be assessed pool. Right. Like, I, I think that's the ultimate thing. And yeah, the argument with Twitter was that they just did a bad job with moderation for a very long time. But to what you guys were talking about, I think the best response I've seen to this is so many people saying like, we gotta go back to the old ways of the old web. You know, like, re rebuild my blog, rebuild my website or something. Because Twitter fulfilled this like, instant gratification, you know, before you'd make a blog post and maybe occasionally you'd look at your traffic and be like, Oh, 50 people read that today. That's interesting. And you move on with your life with Twitter, it's just like instantly you can see what's happening. And that was too addictive for too many of us.\n\nDoc Searls (00:21:35):\n\nBlogging has been taken over to some degree by Sub Stack. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and by, by newsletters in general. My problem there is that what I love about writing a blog is that, oh geez, I want change that I can change it with, with Sub Stack or any of the newsletter outfits. It's already gone out the way it is and you can't go back and correct it, you know, So that one is sitting in people's mailboxes. So I, but it's, and I kind of, I I just hate that it's in yet somebody else's silo. Again, you know, SubT Stack is another centralized system. And Bryan Bell Endorf, who's been a, a guest a couple times on, on Floss Weekly talks about what he calls minimum viable centralization. I think that's really the best way to look at it, you know, and maybe we'll always have that kind of centralization for something.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:20):\n\nWhat about the open source alternatives? We had ramble on on Wednesday on this week in Google. He was Jack Dorsey's boss when Twitter started. He was the lead engineer on od, which is F Williams podcast directory that he shut down to start Twitter. Drae talked a lot about the history of Twitter. In fact, one of the things he told us, you should get him on Floss Weekly. One of the things he told us is that in the early days, the SSH password for Twitter was the company name. And the year it started <laugh> on all of Twitter. So you got, you could get rude on anything. He said they had no, no security at all. But he has started or participating now in something called Scuttle, but which is an open source. There are actually several open source attempts to create some sort of decentralized social network scuttle. But.Nz is one of them.\n\nDoc Searls (00:23:21):\n\nIs is is that Jack Dorsey's, No\n\nLeo Laporte (00:23:24):\n\nCheck Dorsey's Blue Sky, which is now taking, and I've applied, but I haven't been accepted yet, taking a beta testers for some sort of decentralized net. Jack wisely before he left as CEO of Twitter, funded that to the tune of 15 million Irrevocably. So that's enough money for them to keep going. I think with or without Elon's support, I doubt Elon even knows about <laugh> him about it, or cares. There's also Mastodon. And we have a very, I think in a great Mastodon instance that I actually have some hopes for because it's, ever since Elon bought Twitter in the last three days we've had hundreds of new people join. And I think that's true for all the Mastodon mm-hmm. <Affirmative> instances. This is a federated, It's actually not using, there's no Macon protocol. It's using Activity Pub to make a Twitter like clone.\n\n(00:24:16):\n\nThere are other activity pub users like Pixel Fed, Chloroma and, and you can follow anybody on any of these servers, on any other server. You join one server, ours is twit.social. And then you could follow anybody, anybody else's server. What about something like that? Some sort mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, that's what Blue Sky is intended to be, is some sort of federated thing. The one thing that Rabel said was, that's missing from ma it on its portability. So the way Scuttlebutt works, you have a key basically a public key. You could bring anywhere a private and public key here that you can bring anywhere. And, and your entire persona moves there. Matron's a little harder to migrate. What about that stock as a, as a possible solution? I, I, you\n\nDoc Searls (00:25:01):\n\nKnow, I've, I've, I've tried ma in several times and, and every time I, I, I mean, did it's great. Here's the problem. Every one of us has a pie chart in our life, which is the time that we have. And <laugh>,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:11):\n\nIs that a pie chart or a bar charter? Oh,\n\nDoc Searls (00:25:14):\n\nIt's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:14):\n\nMaybe a line.\n\nDoc Searls (00:25:15):\n\nYou know, it's a pie chart where, where a quarter of it, or two, a third of it is sleep, It's gone. You know? And the rest of it is, is obligations. And and those of us who are already writers and writing, they're obligated to do things. They have other things they're doing. Like I do Floss Weekly there, there's other things I do. It's like, how, how, how much could we split up our time? You know? So Twitter actually doesn't take out much of my time. It's actually, again, it's just something I kinda look at for some stuff. And if it's there, it's, it is there. It's not, it's not. Dave Weer just created a new thing called Feed Land, which I advise people to look at. Who,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:52):\n\nDave is always a pioneer in all of this.\n\nDoc Searls (00:25:55):\n\nHe's a huge pioneer.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:57):\n\nYeah. He's the guy we owe. He did a gratitude for <laugh> for podcasting <laugh>. But, but he, he created rss. He was the one who added binary attachments to RSS that made po podcasting possible in 2000. Yeah. Every podcast is a little trying to him just in a corner somewhere, you know,\n\nDoc Searls (00:26:15):\n\nEverybody's feed land.org. Feed land.org.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:19):\n\nHe's, he, one of the things Dave does, which is great, is he's always starting little experiments. And I've actually participated in quite a, quite a few. These, I haven't seen Feed Land yet. Let's go see please sign on. Oh, of course. And this is unfortunate, but Dave does this with Twitter, sign on with Twitter <laugh>. But Dave, Dave always does that. He's always, It's easy. It's easy. And I'm sure it's easy for him. It's using OAuth, so it's fine. It's,\n\nDoc Searls (00:26:40):\n\nYeah. It's an OAuth\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:41):\n\nHack. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So subscribe to a few feeds to get started. Okay. he just added without me knowing 44 new feeds. Okay. That's good. <Laugh>, I'll, I'll, So is this a Twitter? What is, Oh, look, this is a RSS feeds.\n\nDoc Searls (00:26:58):\n\nYeah, it's all RSS feeds.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:59):\n\nSo I do, I follow something called Sumi News. It's very similar. I wonder if Dave knows about it. Same idea. You add RSS feeds, then you have a webpage with stories in it. So this is in Interesting. He's add some\n\nDoc Searls (00:27:12):\n\nGood ones. Yeah. He's had a little cabal of people working on it. I'm, I'm not working on it, but just sort of testing it out. I'm one of them. And something I don't, I don't think Dave is also like the fodder of outlining online. And he did opm l Opm L is what this runs on. But when he had something called More, which some of us remember very far on the back, very back at the turn of the eighties and nineties that was really the first outliner that turned into a presentation. And in some ways persuasion and PowerPoint knocked it off. So he's one of the fathers of, of, you know, presentations as we know them as well. So that's, you know, these, all these, it all kind of fits\n\nLeo Laporte (00:27:54):\n\nTogether. There's no doubt. There's a lot of ideas there's a lot of creativity, but there's, they're all lacking the network effect. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>,\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:28:03):\n\nCan you, that's, that's a Macon problem too, right? Right. Because it's, it's there, it's been around for a while. I know pockets of people who are testing it out, but it's not, it's not like at a global scale in a way that I think is as addictive as Twitter was. It's also really confusing, even like from when you first sign on, like, what am I, I'm making a name for a specific ma on in another way, but I could talk to people, another salons what's happening? This\n\nLeo Laporte (00:28:25):\n\nIs don't, this is the problem with scuttle, but as well, Yeah. It's even more confusing. Twitter works. That's the problem, is that you're making solutions to something that, that continues to work. Now. Twitter doesn't work down the road. And I think people are concerned about that. I saw Annie Lamont really, I thought of great tweet. She's the novelist. She said I'd missed Twitter so much if for some reason we had to walk away. My Twitter people are so good, brilliant and funny. And the pundits I follow, or how I make sense of the chaos, and I'm uplifted by their insight and great humor. So I'm gonna assume we can work this out. She's not leaving. Shonda Rhymes quit, though. A lot of people are quitting. I'm not quitting. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I think we, I think we all Nice thing about become a hellscape. Go ahead. Different.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:29:10):\n\nWell, I, I thought that quote, you know, that he, let's, let's not let it become a hellscape. Where has he been? It is a hellscape, depending on, on how you filter it. Before we leave Elon, I wanted to talk a little bit about his motivation. I think it was a little bit more than a toilet tweet. The, I've been reading a lot of history lately. I think someone told me that as you get old, you stop reading fiction, You start reading history to try to figure out where, where you fit in. And he, he, the, the princess of the Middle Ages were always looking for ways to project power. And for like Edward iii, when he conquered whales, was to build these horrible, ugly castles all the way down the coast. Or you know, in the, in the Renaissance, you would get a Michelangelo or a DaVinci to paint your portrait\n\nLeo Laporte (00:30:06):\n\nOr to some famous cathedral, Venice. If you travel the Adriatic and the Aian, you'll see all these Venetian fortifications as Venice extended their power out.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:30:16):\n\nYeah. They were bad. The Venetians. Yeah. anyway, he's like a modern prince. He's the, he's the, you know, richest guy in the world. He's, he's you know, how do you project your power? If you're in the digital world, you buy the biggest thing you can get your hand on. And, and, you know, he, he claims it's too important. He wants it cuz he wants to save the medium to save humanity. Well, as Neli points out, he's got a few things to learn. Anyway. I do think it's there's a lot of ego. There's a lot of, I've got the money. I can do it. I'm gonna do it.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:30:53):\n\nI, I also count that as toilet tweeting though. Like, just surely, Oh, this is a good idea. Like, what? I think for many people, your best thinking is done on the toilet. You know, you're just way from everybody.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:31:03):\n\nIt's the shower. But okay. You know Sure. What, what, whatever\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:31:07):\n\nWorks. But that is a good point because Elon's cars are taking over the roads, The starlink satellites are destroying our skies. Right. And bad for astronomers and everything. So Yeah, there's, there, he, his influence is far reaching and everywhere. And Twitter just seems like the, the easiest way to like, take over the conversation.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:31:26):\n\nHe's not born in the US so he can't become president. Yep. And you might argue that being the owner of Twitter might be more powerful than the President.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:31:35):\n\nHe is a national security risk. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:31:37):\n\nHe is gonna face a lot of trouble overseas though. The eu, China, India all are gonna say, No, no this is what we, this is what we want Twitter to be. And they have some clout because Elon has other businesses. That's some of Eli's point is that Elon, for instance, the Chinese are very important to Tesla. They build them there, They sell a lot of them there. He says, if the Chinese government says to Elon, you know, we don't want you banning our propaganda arms, They won't call him that. What is Elon gonna do? Is he gonna give up his business in China? No, he's gonna ow. Just by the way, just like Apple does mm-hmm. <Affirmative> mm-hmm. <Affirmative> that's\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:32:23):\n\nProbably, we told me that, Someone told me that the Chinese leadership think of Apple as a Chinese company.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:32:29):\n\nYeah.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:32:30):\n\nAnd\n\nLeo Laporte (00:32:30):\n\nThey're not, not surprising any, So China's not gonna invade the us. I mean, people are so worried about tip talking. China's not gonna send nukes to the us. That's, that's the silly, They want soft power. That's their masters of this. So much like Elon, they wanna build influence. They do it economically.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:32:50):\n\nMm-Hmm. <affirmative>,\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:32:52):\n\nThey might, they might want Taiwan.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:32:54):\n\nWell, I know they want Taiwan. Yeah, Yeah. They want Taiwan. And so watch closely, because you'll know that's imminent. If you start seeing tweets and ticks that are in some way insinuating that Taiwan has always been China. It's always been a part of China. It's a culturally same thing Putin said about Ukraine, rather it's culturally and, and, and ancestrally a part of the Chinese mainland. And, you know, we just want to, we just wanna bring them back into the fold. If you start seeing a lot of that on Twitter then maybe that's the answer. I\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:33:26):\n\nThink, I think that's a thing most, most people have no clue about, by the way. Like, I'm not, I'm no expert on Taiwanese history, but I have gone there a lot because of Computex, which is a thing that still happens and was a, is a very important you know, event. But they do the, the air drills every time we're there. And it's a terrifying reminder of like, Oh yeah, China could, could at any second just be like, You're mine again. And it would be hell for everybody in Taiwan, so. Well,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:33:52):\n\nYeah. It's worse than that. You know, I think in the seventies, the United States ended the mutual support treaty with Taiwan mm-hmm. <Affirmative> because it was obvious that we weren't gonna send troops and launch bombs if China invaded Taiwan. But of late President Biden has twice now said, Oh no, we'll send troops. That's a, So it's more than just something between Taiwan and China. Oh,\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:34:19):\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:34:19):\n\nThat's World War ii. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So that's a terrifying prospect in the us The question to me is, and this is the interesting thing you both raised, is Elon interested in political power? In which case he doesn't care if it makes money, or is he a businessman first? And his primary interest is getting that $44 billion back?\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:34:40):\n\nHistorically, he hasn't been to the back grade of a business man, You know?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:34:43):\n\nYeah. I don't\n\nDoc Searls (00:34:44):\n\nKnow. He's a, he's a libertarian. He, you know, he mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, he, that's, that's basically where he comes from. He wants us good for business. And you know, the, that's pretty much his deal. I'm, I don't think he wants more than that.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:34:59):\n\nIs is he now completely accepted the ownership. He fought at tooth and nail and I think only decided to complete the deal when it looked like you were gonna go to court and he was gonna be forced to to be deposed, and then they'll be discovery. And it was starting to look bad. I think you could say he was, he was forced into this purchase, but now he's, he's kind of recognizing, Okay, well maybe it's not such a bad thing.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:35:26):\n\nI, I, I predict he's gonna be out of it before the end\n\nLeo Laporte (00:35:29):\n\nOf the, He won't. He'll appoint a ceo, he's kind of into, or\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:35:32):\n\nHe'll or\n\nLeo Laporte (00:35:33):\n\nHe'll sell it or sell it. He'll get out of it. Here's my thought. Maybe if he is a businessman, polish the turd as best you can and you'll see a lot of action in that direction. And then ipo. And he knows, probably in his heart, I'm not getting my 44 bill, but if he IPOs, by the way, he can maintain control. If he does what most founders these days do and have super voting shares, he can have his cake and eat too. He can still have Twitter as a personal possession to some degree. But also, Philip, you, I know you're all over the stock market. That's a lot of what your website, PD 30 is all about Apple investors in invest investing. Does that sound like something that could happen?\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:36:16):\n\nWell, first it's not anything that, that Tim Cook would do. <Laugh>, we're not talk, we're\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:22):\n\nNot talking about a company\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:36:24):\n\nLike Apple. Apple's a different beast. Oh, sure.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:28):\n\nWe're gonna talk about Apple's quarter, by the way, in a little bit. So\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:36:31):\n\nYeah. That, that's actually the big news. But we can keep talking about Twitter.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:35):\n\nYeah. I don't, I agree with you. I mean, this is all inconsequential and sort of, it might be politically consequential.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:36:42):\n\nNo, no. I think it, it's not that it isn't important. The, for me, what happened to the tech companies this week, excluding Twitter. Yeah. Yeah. Was, was remarkable. Well,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:55):\n\nWe're gonna definitely, we'll get to it. Talk about that for people who are going can with the Elon, I'm sorry. This is a big story. This really is a story. And I didn't even mention the fact that he stole my handle. That's, I'm not even, I'm not going there. I'm not gonna go there. Yeah, it's gonna be interesting. I am not quitting Twitter. I still pay my five bucks to for Twitter, Blue. I will watch with interest. I will. I'm crossing my fingers that Twitter becomes even better and more useful. It certainly is useful today that he doesn't, you know, take it down. Strange and weird roads. He's not, it's not looking good so far. There's a great site, by the way. I just wanna mention, so one of the, one of, there's so many rumors swirling around. One is, you know, remember he fired Paraag Alar, the Aro Wall, the ceo, he fired the cfo, he fired the Chief counsel, and maybe even most importantly, fired the woman in charge of trust and safety.\n\n(00:37:53):\n\nThe mm-hmm. <Affirmative>. there is a rumor floating around. We know at least that agro wall had a 40 million golden parachute. The rumor is floating around now that he is claiming ju that he fired them for cause. And they we'll deny them any severance, which would be, Wow. There's also rumor going around that there, he wants to fire a lot of people before November 1st. November 1st is a dead day after tomorrow, right? No. Tu Wednesday is a deadline. That's when stock options are typically offered. And he wants to cut that off and, and get people out of there. And in order to do that, he's looking to fire people for cause because he's asked, everybody initially asked them all the coders to print out everything you've done in the last 30 to 60 days. <Laugh>, cuz I would like to review it.\n\n(00:38:49):\n\nHe brought in Tesla engineers we're to, again, it's hard to confirm any of this. So a lot of what I'm saying might just be rumor. Then he said, No, no, you don't have to print it out. You could show it on the screen reasonably. You're not gonna be able to look at this code, walk in the door, look at the code and say, That's good code. That's bad code. But you could perhaps walk in the door saying, Oh, you're producing, Especially in the last 30 to 60 days when everything has been up in the air oh. When you're not producing. And maybe he can use this as a way to fire people for cause and save himself a pocket of money. This is a comedy site. Elon Code review.com. Print your code for review by Elon Musk <laugh>. Most codes reviewed in GitHub.\n\n(00:39:30):\n\nGet Lab or somewhere online. But that's too efficient. Why not print out your code and submit the printout by facts for review by Elon personally. I was curious. I gotta watch the video on this. They've made, they made a video. Oh, it's a rick roll. Nevermind. They gotcha. They got me. Get six months free. No fuss way to review your code. Print your code fact. You can show it again. I I got rid of Aston <laugh>. Fax your printouts. Wait for the mailman. Send your code to space. All code reviews merged after review by Elon Musk automatically reprinted and send a space, abort a SpaceX rocket at a price plan. Only <laugh> get printing today. Get six months free. And by the way, here's some tweets from happy developers. It used to take me forever to get my code reviewed since Friday. I've been printing it all out and getting Elon to look at it. And my God, it's been amazing. And oh, you might wanna check the pricing. <Laugh> starter is $15 billion, 44 billion for the tweet level. Hundred 20 billion for the enterprise plan. So that's, everybody's having a good laugh at Elon's expense. Well, well, did\n\nSpeaker 6 (00:40:44):\n\nHe actually ask to see the code?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:40:47):\n\nWell, that was a report. Is that true? Again, that was a report. Yeah. These are all reports. I don't know, reports from reputable sources. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but Davindra, I don't know. Have you tried to vet any of this?\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:40:58):\n\nI mean, I did. It's not my beat. So that's Carissa be and Gad who deals with social media stuff. But you know, it was Casey Newton who reported this, and there could have been some Casey.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:06):\n\nHe's pretty reliable, right? He's\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:41:07):\n\nPretty good. Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:08):\n\nHe's a good man. I can't read his stuff anymore because it's a hundred dollars a year <laugh> who can afford that? I can't afford platformer. So just just only read the first paragraph of everything he posts <laugh>. But he's good. He's good. He's one of the, one of the good guys who pursued a you know, a career as a newsletter writer and I'm sure is doing very well. Yeah. And he has good sources. But it's one of those, it's like people who in the know have said, Yeah, I\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:41:40):\n\nMean, everything's a mess. Look at the people who are, who are the, the, the jokers who are in front of the Twitter office. Right. CNBC in people.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:47):\n\nLima <laugh>. Yeah. Which is a very poor Reddit joke that I am not going to explain.\n\nDoc Searls (00:41:55):\n\nIt's pretty self thing is not, one thing, is not a rumor. It's certainty is if he, he is pissed off so many people who work for him, you know, who work for the company, that's gonna turn into a lot of results that are some of them competing. I mean, it's could, it's gonna be a, you know, a, a fabulously wide range of results that none of which he could control. Yeah. Mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, that'll be really interesting. And there's made a lot of people hate him.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:42:23):\n\nThere will be a lot of great engineers on the street.\n\nDoc Searls (00:42:25):\n\nExactly. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:42:26):\n\nExactly. That's the good news. <Laugh>. I have heard though, and I don't, again, I have heard that there was a lot of Deadwood at Twitter, 7,500 employees. He had said at one point he wanted to fire 75%. Then he backed down and said, Well, when he, when he did the when he went to Twitter, he said, Nah, I'm not gonna fire 75% <laugh>. We don't know what he's gonna\n\nDoc Searls (00:42:48):\n\nDo. <Laugh> just 7,500.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:42:49):\n\nWe don't know what he's gonna do. How many people could you, how many engineers would you need to run Twitter engineers? Not much. Right? A good team. 25, a hundred people maybe. Oh, I don't know. Trust and safety. Thousands. Moderation thousands.\n\nDoc Searls (00:43:07):\n\nYeah. Zillion. Yeah. Remember when, I mean, early in the early days of Twitter, the failed whale was constant, almost. Well credit to Facebook that didn't crash very much. They did. There are some good engineers. At least made the place run. You don't see the fail whale much anymore. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:23):\n\nIf at all. No, no. You remember Leia Culver, who wrote a Twitter clone called Ponce, which I personally thought was better than Twitter. Loved it. Failed. She works at Twitter, and here she is, her tweet holding your printout. Oh, <laugh>. So, I don't know, is she joking? Is she telling the truth? That's pretty thin pile. I don't know. Yeah. And, and notice this was July 26th. I don't know. I think you might, you might have some trouble with the the Elon. She does. I, let me see. In her bio, I think she says she does Twitter spaces. Yeah. and iOS Twitter. So she's their iOS coder oth co-author of Oau and o Embed. She's Leah's great.\n\n(00:44:12):\n\nI don't knows maybe another great engineer on the, on the, on the beach. Ready? today, Elon deleted the tweet. He posted earlier today saying espousing, I don't even wanna repeat the la mass conspiracy theory from even more LA mass right wing rag that Paul Pelosi was inebriated when he got attacked with a hammer, which even if true. So what he, it was an attempt to assassinate the speaker of the house, the number three in line for the presidency. Well, two, I guess if you include the pres, don't include the president. That's a, that's a bigger story than I think he even got coverage. That's an assassination attempt.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:44:54):\n\nYeah. The way, it was not the leading story in the New York Times, and it was\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:58):\n\nBelow the fold,\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:44:59):\n\nBelow the fold. Just I, what's happening?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:02):\n\nUnbelievable. Musk shared an article that, you know, was just garbage and said, There's a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye. That's a very trollish thing to say. Yeah. Well, I don't, but I hear Yeah.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:45:19):\n\nResponding to Hillary Clinton, by the way, who maybe has, has a little information about what's going on too. Ugh,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:26):\n\n<Laugh>. Alright. Enough. <Laugh>. This is\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:45:31):\n\nWhy I don't wanna pay him, Leo. I don't wanna pay for Twitter blue with that idiot in charge.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:35):\n\nI don't think he's gonna do anything with my 4 99 <laugh>.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:45:39):\n\nIt's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:40):\n\nNot gonna, That's what you think. Yeah. I don't know. You think I should just not? I look, I, you know, Yeah. As, as, as worried as I am and as doubtful as I am about this guy, I drove a Tesla. I'm pretty impressed with SpaceX. They've shown that you can, commercial space, can do what NASA could not do for a fraction of the money. On and on and on. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I'm, I want him to do a good thing with, I want him to turn Twitter into something wonderful. Can he do it? I don't, If\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:46:08):\n\nIf he had just shut up, then we could have enjoyed the, the fruits of Tesla and what the, the good things space has done. But unfortunately, I think, like so many people, he, he cannot shut up. And Twitter is literally a platform for just spewing his garbage out to, to everybody. So it's sort of like, it is kinda like what happened to Kanye, isn't it Just like Yeah. Poor impulse upon of time. Poor\n\nLeo Laporte (00:46:30):\n\nImpulse control. Control. I mean that tweet this morning, you're the CEO of the company. You're not the chief Twi, by the way. You're the CEO of the company. <Laugh>. I'm the chief. Twi. You're <laugh> by the way, on Mastodon, where we don't call 'em tweets, we call 'em toots. I call myself the chief toot tu inchi tu in chief. I'm just saying <laugh>.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (00:46:52):\n\nJust saying only for toilet toots.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:46:53):\n\nYeah. Yeah. But I have, by the way, I looked back, I was chief twit on Jaiku in 2007. It's been <laugh>, it's been on my business card. It's, I'll show you my bus. It's on my business card for at least a decade. And how does law, how does the law work? No one knows. It's a mystery. <Laugh>. It's a mystery. We have the trademark for twit have had it since 2005, long before Twitter existed. I feel like I own twit, but maybe I might be mistaken. He, he'll, Leo. Leo. He'll settle. Oh yeah, sure. Two, two of them and he'll settle. Sure, sure. That'll, that'll go Well, it's great to have you. I have, I feel like we've got the brain trust here. It's so great to have Doc Searles. I've been trying to get you on for, you've been on before, but not in ages.\n\n(00:47:43):\n\nYeah, a couple times. Yeah. Host of floss. You could come on as often as you want. You're always welcome. Same to you, to vendor. Oi, love you. Senior editor in Gadget. How old's your newborn? Newborn is now seven months old. Oh my God. She's doing really well. Yeah. And we need, I know we need to get you outta here because your daughter's sprained her ankle. I'm sorry. So, Yep. It's, You got daddy duty. So we'll get, We'll, I'll move quicker, more quickly through this. And of course, the wonderful Philip Elmer Dewitt, who is a legend in the business, p e d3 zero.com. One of the analysts call calls me legend whenever he responds to me. He says, Legend, how are you doing? I like that Michael Krasney, I did an interview with him who is 77 in a legendary broadcaster and the Bay Area, K G and K Q E D said, Don't call.\n\n(00:48:32):\n\nHe said, I once called Kirk death this a legend. And he yelled at me. He said, Legends are dead. Do not <laugh>, <laugh>, do not call me. I'll remember that. A legend. Yes. If it's well, and now he is. You can call him that. Yeah. He's dead now. So it's oh God, that got really dark. <Laugh> <laugh> very fast. Let's talk about our fine sponsors cuz you know, the, these are the people who make this show happen. And I am internally grateful to them as always for their great support. Our show today brought to you by my beautiful eight sleep. And if I am at all coherent today, it is because I had a great night's sleep on my eight sleep. Eight sleep makes mattresses, but I have, I don't have, I like my mattress. We have a very nice mattress.\n\n(00:49:25):\n\nSo I got the pod, which is a cover that goes over the mattress and it does something very interesting. It both heats it and cools it go either way as low as 55 degrees, which is chilly, or 110 degrees, which is hot or anywhere in between. Why would you want this? Oh, you do. Let me trust, Let me tell you, trust me. In fact, normally Lisa gets up early. She's a very early riser. She likes to get her coffee, go to the, go to the gym, work out, you know, have some me time. So she's normally up six o'clock. I got up about eight. She was still in bed. I, I went and had my coffee. She was, she didn't get up till nine 30. I said, What happened? She slept. She said, Well, I woke up at seven, turned my eight, sleep up a couple of degrees, went back to sleep, all cozy.\n\n(00:50:11):\n\nWoke up at eight, turned my eight. Sleep up a little bit, went back to sleep while cozy, she slept an extra three hours and that's what the eight sleep does. But you know what? She needed it. It's her day off. I'm glad she did. I'm really glad she did. Eight sleep is the only sleep technology that dynamically cools and heats each side of the bed. So her temperature was different than mine. She likes to sleep warmer than I do. But it maintains the optimal sleeping temperature for what your body needs. It knows the room temperature. It knows you. It's got sensors to notice if you're sleeping well, if you're tossing and turning to know how deep your sleep is and literally optimizes the temperature for you. For instance, I like to start warm. I get in bed. It's toasty and cozy, especially in the winter.\n\n(00:50:53):\n\nBut the eight sleep brings the temperature down slowly because I go into a deeper sleep as a result. That deep sleep is so important for your health. Sufficient deep sleep can reduce the likelihood of Alzheimer's, decrease the risk of heart disease, lower your blood pressure. Yet more than 30% of Americans struggle with sleep. I bet you do. We all do. Right? Feeling hot at night. One of the primary reasons people don't sleep well. Waking up with the sweats. It's war the worst. In the summer, we had a really bad heat whip. I had my hate sleep and it t did it automatically cool me off. It kept me cool. I never got hot. It warms me up in the winter and it cools me off as I sleep so that I have the optimal sleep. Clinical data shows eight sleep users experience up to 19% increase in recovery, up to 32% improvement in sleep quality.\n\n(00:51:38):\n\nAnd for me, the big one, 34% more deep sleep. If you sleep an extra half hour of that deep sleep, that sleep that cleans the brain, you'll feel so much better. You will be sharper, you will feel better. Everything is just nicer. Eight sleep. We have the original pod. They have actually, we have the pod two. I think they just launched the next generation, the pod three more accurate sleep and health tracking. Double the sensors. It is the best sleep experience on the earth. It's not magic. It feels like magic. It's incredible. Soft, comfortable, warm when you want it. Cool when you need it. I can't recommend it more highly. And I'll tell you, when we went on vacation last week, went to Vegas for a few nights, I really felt the lack of my eight sleep. We've had it for a year now. So I've been through a winter and a summer and we're going through another winner. Maybe hotels will start getting aids. Sleep eight sleep.com/twi. Sleep cozy this fall. If you're in Australia, sleep cozy this summer, you'll save $150 a checkout on the pod. I apologize, that was terrible. Eight. Sleep currently ships in Australia and the US and Canada, the uk and select countries in the eu. I should say, I really love this. I, it's something you should check out, eight sleep.com/twi. And when you, if you do, please use that address so that they know you saw it here. Eight sleep.com/twi. We thank him so much for supporting the show.\n\n(00:53:06):\n\nLet's talk about Apple, Philip Elmer DeWitt's here. This is the time Apple did two things. They said on Thursday. Their quarterly results came out. The best quarter record quarter did. Great. Don't count on next one. What's, Explain this, Philip, you're muted. I don't know if that's us or you ex.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:53:27):\n\nSorry. Yeah, that's okay. It, it's always, it's always a record quarter.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:53:30):\n\nYeah. I knew it would be a record quarter. Now, does this include iPhone 14? It does, doesn't it?\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:53:36):\n\nFive days of iPhone\n\nLeo Laporte (00:53:38):\n\n14. Oh, so just a slice. So it's really the next quarter, which is their q3 Q\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:53:45):\n\nNo Q q1.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:53:47):\n\nQ1 is the big quarter.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:53:48):\n\nThis was q4. They ended their fiscal year at the end of September. Okay. And what we got was the results for that. So we got the, the quarterly results and, and the annual results. I, if, can I ask the, the the tech guys to pull up the chart for one of the charts I sent shows what Apple did compared to the other tech companies.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:54:11):\n\nYeah. Cuz this was a bad time for tech companies. Here's the performance from p e d three o.com.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:54:18):\n\nThere you go. This came from the Wall Street Journal. There's meta that lost a quarter of value in in one day. One of my, one of my subscribers who, who he says, you know, I should have shorted it the day he changed the name cuz I knew he was panicking. And then I finally shorted it just before the earnings. I, I shorted it at 1 35 and it went down to 99. So the guy made a bunch of money, Geez. Betting against this thing. And you know,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:54:49):\n\nLook at these steep declines. Look at Amazon.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:54:51):\n\nYeah. Oh my God. Amazon went downstairs. Look\n\nLeo Laporte (00:54:53):\n\nAt Alphabet. And then Alpha apple, which is exactly the opposite, is slow decline and then suddenly a jump.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:55:01):\n\nWhat you're seeing is the money pouring out of those other three companies Oh. And into Apple. They needed some place to go. And so it was Apple's only, Apple's second best one day game in, in January. They had another big product.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:55:17):\n\nAnd that was after they announced their results.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:55:20):\n\nYeah. Wow.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:55:21):\n\nYeah. So, but explain to me, cuz I do not buy tech stocks. And for good re you know, as a journalist, I don't want to have a dog in this hunt. And I, and I have some interest in the stock market, but I'm not an expert. Explain to me, the tech companies had a big boon in Covid. Right? They all did Great. Yeah. Isn't this just somewhat of a correction after this growth? Are they below where they were before Covid?\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:55:49):\n\nYou'd have to look at individual stocks. Apple is down for the year.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:55:53):\n\nI, I know me is Meda is $700 billion off. Its, if its peak <laugh>,\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:55:58):\n\nThey, they $800 billion evaporated. They, someone called it the, the greatest destruction of capital <laugh> in a long time. No. The\n\nLeo Laporte (00:56:11):\n\nBut by the way, I would point out, Yeah, I would point out if you did short them, you know, execute because they're making a long bet. Matt is saying, Look, we know the social's dying. They're agreeing with what we said last break. We know the social's dying. We think the the metaverse is the next big thing, and we're gonna pour all our energies into that. If they're right. It's like, it's just a startup. You're buying low, what could be the biggest company of 2028,\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:56:40):\n\nA co a couple things. Jim Kramer was on and, and literally cried <laugh> apologizing for having believed, having believed in Facebook. And he said, When, when I found out how much they were spending on meta, I, I thought there was an adult there that could control this. But they've, they're just out of control. So he, this is, this is an important, this is an influential, the most influential guy on cnbc, which all the investors watch. And and he's saying, you know, to and, and tearfully that I screwed up to answer.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:13):\n\nThe thing is, let me answer my question. Cause I have the alphabet stock Valentine's Day 2020, right before the pandemic. They were at their peak for the last many years of $76 pandemic. They go down to 53, they've climbed back. This was of course of the pandemic was very, very good to Alphabet. They've dropped since, but they're still well above their pan, their pre pandemic peak. They're at $101. So this is what I say when I, or a 90, I'm sorry, 96, 58. This is what I say when people say, Oh, they're tanking is, well, they're just recovering from what was a big runup because of Covid.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:57:53):\n\nMm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right. That's true. That's true. The, the what's scary about Facebook and Alphabet is that the, the cloud numbers are going down. It looks like they, they bet on the cloud and the cloud. The investment in the cloud\n\nLeo Laporte (00:58:08):\n\nSeems to be Amazon's eating their lunch, Right? Yeah. Is that what's really\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:58:12):\n\nHappening? A Amazon web services also\n\nLeo Laporte (00:58:16):\n\nIs it down as well? Yeah. But again, anyway, I think you have to look at historic. Now here's historic five years for Facebook, and Yeah, they're well below their peak before the pandemic, which is $214 here down in 99, 90 $9.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:58:33):\n\nThey screwed the poop. They're\n\nLeo Laporte (00:58:34):\n\nDone. They're done. They're cooked. At least for short term. I wonder if Amazon, Did Amazon give their results? This, this\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:58:42):\n\nWeek? Yeah. Yeah. They were, It was Friday morning, I believe.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:58:46):\n\nOkay. So there's, they're still above. Well, okay. That's interesting. So they're right at their peak pre pandemic. Their peak pre pandemic was 104. They're now 103. So they look it, I mean, this is this big, this Devil's Mountain here. It's c Right.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:59:05):\n\nBut\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:05):\n\nYeah, it was inevitable that this wouldn't last forever.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:59:08):\n\nRight. And that's, and that's what was impressive about Apple. Despite they got pushed up with Covid as well as everybody else. And they've managed with, you know, the iPhone sales are down a bit and services are down a bit, but they've got, they've got so many cylinders going that, that they, you know, I don't know. It's, it's like printing money. Can, can we show another chart that I offered? It was the mountain of cash.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:36):\n\nThey have as much cash as they've ever had now, right?\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:59:41):\n\nNo. Oh, no. They've been, they've been they made a commitment, remember in 2016, Oh,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:47):\n\nThey, they've buying back\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:59:48):\n\nStock that Trump was gonna let them repatriate all the cash that they had overseas Yep. For reduced all that reduced money\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:55):\n\nTax bill. Yep.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (00:59:56):\n\nYeah. So they started bringing their cash back and buying it is, they, they're all, everybody who works for Apple and especially the Chief people have a lot of stock, and if they got dividends, they'd have to pay taxes on it. But if they buy back stock, they, they don't pay taxes.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:00:15):\n\nAnd I should point out some say, I don't know, again, I plead ignorance that buying back stock is in a way inflating the stock because you're reducing the pool of shares\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:00:28):\n\nOut there. No, it's the opposite. It's the opposite. It's making each share of stock represent a larger part of the company. It's deflation, I guess.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:00:37):\n\nOkay. Well, you end\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:00:38):\n\nUp with more valuable stock. Okay. If they, if they buy it back. So it doesn't make that much,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:00:43):\n\nYou're, let me put it this way, You're artificially improving your stock price by buying back stock.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:00:49):\n\nThat's right. That's right. And the, you know, the argument is, if you have all this money, can't you find something better to do with it, invested in new products and, and do some research something. And IBM made the mistake of, rather than investing in the future, buying back their stock and it hurt them they, you know, they're a shadow of their original shelf sell Apple. They've got some very smart people the smart money people managing this. And I, I have to laugh when I watch the, the analysts, you know, second guessing Tim Cook, they have no idea what he's saying.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:22):\n\nNo. And I, that's why I say very clearly, I have no, I don't know what I'm talking about. Yeah. <laugh>\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:01:28):\n\nMissing, by the way, in, in this chart of companies is Microsoft. And I just, I was peeking at their earnings this week, and they also took a hit, but not, not as badly as everybody else. They kind of went halfway because Apple, Apple gain, Right. But Microsoft took a smaller hit than most of these\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:44):\n\nOther pre pandemic Creek for Microsoft 180 5. They're now 2 35. So they're up almost, They're\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:01:50):\n\nVery well managed company. And they've, you know, they've found their new\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:54):\n\nPeople. Well, Microsoft is great. If you look at the stock price over the total history of the stock, going back to 86 was very flatline for a decade. From 2000, well, to maybe 2015, just flatline.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:02:10):\n\nAlthough in two, in 2000 it looked pretty darn good. I mean, in, in, in retrospect, that doesn't look like much <laugh>. But that was a, that was a good,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:17):\n\nBut look what's happened in sense since Satya Nadella and the focus on Azure and the cloud, which has I think been a very smart move in pandemic. Yeah. They're down a little bit now. There's, you know, there's a little bit of a recovery put,\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:02:31):\n\nPut Apple up, put Apple up\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:32):\n\nOver. Oh, I, I have all of them here. Let me see. Here's Apple <laugh> I'm gonna do the max again for, for the full lifetime event on this. Ignore this. I don't know even what that, but starting in 2008, they've been steadily climbing. It was really right about year, not so steady.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:02:50):\n\nIt gets hit. It's up and down periodically. Yeah. It gets, it gets hit worse. Like Microsoft was a smoother curve than this. I, I can't really understand it, but it, but it's like the people fall out of love with Apple, or they find it's, you know, the, the,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:10):\n\nYeah. I'll tell you what\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:03:11):\n\nIt is with Apple is doomed. I\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:12):\n\nTell you what it is, by the way.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:03:14):\n\nYep. I\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:15):\n\nShould, I, behind the scenes, Philip asked me to join your crowd. You have some sort of broad thing you do, and I didn't understand that they were all Apple investors, <laugh>. So I'm joining and I'm going, Oh, you know, there's no way. This company has a few. And they're like, What are you talking about <laugh>? And, and I was really the cheese in their girl. But I understand\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:03:41):\n\nThat was a, that was a fun show, Leo. I enjoyed it. Appreciate it.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:45):\n\nBut I understand that what, from the outside happens periodically and I'm the, I'm the poster boy for this as you go. Well, they've saturated, they couldn't possibly find anywhere else to grow. There's no, And they consistently make me wrong. Now they've done it with services, right? They, you're right. They can't sell anymore iPhones. They're, they've, that's, they're gonna sell the same number every year from now on. But they're making money in services This, this quarter though. Service is not so hot.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:04:15):\n\nYeah. I I have to correct you about iPhones. They're, they're growing market share while the others are losing.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:21):\n\nSo that's where their growth comes from, is the, is people stopping Android and going to,\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:04:26):\n\nRight. They have a, except in the us they, they have a a small market share everywhere else in the comp There's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:33):\n\nThe world. Yeah. There's potential.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:04:34):\n\nThere's plenty. Yeah. There's space to grow. And, you know, the watches, it's bel you know, I was at a, a hoop shoot with girls and boys six to 13 and half the girls had Apple watches. Yeah. Where's that at?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:50):\n\nYeah. <laugh>, that's, well, that's the trick for Apple, right? They've gotta find new product categories, because I mean, yeah, okay. There's growth potential. And China kind of saved their bacon for the last few years cuz suddenly that market took off. But at some point, you sell an iPhone to everybody who's ever gonna buy an iPhone, you're not gonna have that same kind of growth. You wanna find the next big thing. And it turned out watches, which at first were really kinda laggard have has turned out out pretty well for them. Notice I'm wearing Leo,\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:05:18):\n\nThe\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:19):\n\n$800 Ultra\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:05:20):\n\nLeo. Leo. It's a monopoly. They have a monopoly. They have a monopoly, the Apple ecosystem. And to the extent that you're bought into it, you will, you know, they've got your, they got me for life and Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:34):\n\nYeah. Which I hate, but it's true. It's, it's love it garden. I love it. And I hate it. It, yeah. But it's a Waled Garden. Davinder. Are you are you captive to the Apple?\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:05:44):\n\nOh, ab absolutely. Yeah. I mean, I, I'm not reviewing phones and stuff anymore, but certainly once I started with smartphones, like the Apple ecosystem made the most sense. Ipad was always the best. Like, oh, forget about Android tablets. Oh my God. For the past decade. If you wanted anything decent, the Apple ecosystem made the most sense. And now I can imagine why parents would be buying young kids Apple watches. My daughter is four now, but when she's six or seven, when she's going to school, having a lifeline to her, you know, being able to see where she is, that is something a lot of people would really be interested in having. So I, I can imagine that's being super successful. I'm also getting more into, like, car tech and stuff these days. And I can clearly see like why there have been all those rumors about Apple and car stuff, because that is a whole platform where Apple is, is basically partnering with companies now, but having a total solution or having something with more of the Apple branding on it, that would also be another huge hit for them.\n\n(01:06:42):\n\nSo yeah, I'm, I'm in the ecosystem and yeah, we'll see how far it goes.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:45):\n\nSo they do need another product, right? I mean, services have been good. Services wasn't that good this quarter. Why do you think that was Philip?\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:06:53):\n\nI think it was a, a tough compare. It, it had grown enormously the year, Yeah. The year before. It's hard\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:59):\n\nTo sustain levels of growth like that year after year after year.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:07:02):\n\nYeah. Well, you know, it was, it, it was the pandemic growth\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:05):\n\nAnd Yeah, yeah, yeah. But there you go. And Apples facing some headwinds on the biggest profit center in their services, which is the App store.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:07:14):\n\nYeah. Yeah. We, you know, they, they, the, there was some serious activity in Congress to, to crack down on Apple and, and take some of the APIs away,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:26):\n\nOr EU as well all over the world. Yeah.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:07:29):\n\nEu, But EU can get stuff done. Congress, it turns out Canop, <laugh>.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:33):\n\nSo\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:07:34):\n\nThat thing died. I, I have to add one theory I have about Facebook. You know, the next product that we're supposed to get according to Bloomberg, it's coming in the spring, is are these goggles? I have a, I have a very hard time seeing goggles as an Apple product. It, it just doesn't seem to have the mask. Well,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:53):\n\nI felt that way about the card too, actually. I was very surprised to hear you say you think the card event is a, is a good,\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:07:59):\n\nJust, I'm just looking at like what's ahead to, and also, hey ar glasses. I just tried out the Magic Leap two. Remember Magic Leap. Yeah. And how much money they raise. Yeah. Yeah. Their new headset is actually pretty good, but because of all the bad word of mouth, like nobody, nobody's taking that company seriously anymore. So,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:16):\n\nHave you tried I bought the, I set Embarrassed to admit the $1,600 Quest Pro.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:08:21):\n\nI haven't tried them yet. It, it, we, we are in the, we reviewed it in Gadget and our viewers like, it's good. It's a good headset. I don't know who it's for. The bet on that market seems weird and maybe out of place, but the idea of having maybe something you slip on or maybe even your own current glasses that could extend your displays, maybe when you're actually sitting at your, Oh,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:43):\n\nI love that idea.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:08:44):\n\nThat is a really interesting idea\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:46):\n\nRight now. It's\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:08:46):\n\nTo do though, isn't it? I'm, I'm, it's hard to do, but it does seem like the Quest Pro is doing it pretty well. This is, this is like a five, 10 year problem. But the stuff I've seen, like the Magic Leap two stuff, and even a bit of the HoloLens too, like, it can be magical. The question is, who is it for? Will people actually want this? It still seems more like of an industrial trend, like not really what Apple tends to do. Like they are far more consumer focused. But I could, I could see it being a thing eventually, you know, at least for some people, people Yeah.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:09:17):\n\nGlasses for sure. If they could, if they could make the glasses you know, that look like this. Yep. That would be a great product. The Quest, my theory about the goggles is I just can't see it as Apple product. I can't see it this spring. I, I have this theory that they're doing it to drive Facebook nuts. <Laugh>\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:37):\n\nShit\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:09:38):\n\n<Laugh>.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:39):\n\nOh,\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:09:39):\n\nDon't, Somebody has to don't,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:40):\n\nDon't kick 'em when they're down. That's mean.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:09:45):\n\nI think they may have no intention of doing what? What?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:47):\n\nOh, that's really interesting\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:09:49):\n\nTheory. Bloomberg says they're gonna do, and, and Meta just keeps pouring money into the project. Yeah. The reviews of the people who actually went in that space where they don't have legs and you bump into Horizon World and they're mostly kids. Yeah. That, Oh, that looked like such a loser. Yeah.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:10:07):\n\nIt did. But you know what? So did, so did the internet in 1996. Yeah. You know, like, it's early. I remember, I remember what that was. I remember I really wanted to watch the trailer for Mortal Combat in like, before that movie came out. And I had to enter this long website, not the, like, not a branded Dona domain name. It was like a dash a tilda. Like 10, 30 seconds later. Once I was done entering that url, I had to wait 30 minutes for the 1996 grade, the web video to load too. So this stuff is really bad, you know, until, until like, there is a shift. And there there's like something that kind of, you remember, hits a big public hit.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:10:45):\n\nRemember, Remember Real, You've seen this before. Remember Real\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:47):\n\nNetworks? Yeah. You remember that? Yeah. <laugh>.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:10:49):\n\nI remember Real Networks. It was real networks actually. Yeah. It was a low quality real, Yeah. It was awful. Real player thing. Yeah. but Philip, to to, to what you're saying, like, I, I test horizon work rooms too, like before at Launch. Good. So I haven't seen like, the way normal people have using have used it. There, there is potential there. Like when I'm, I'm living outside of Atlanta now. I'm not near my normal coworkers to be able to hop into virtual space and just like have a meeting with people could be useful. I, I don't know if you guys have seen some of the footage from that, but I was also in a space where Zuckerberg's avatar appeared right next to me. Yeah. Yeah. And I was also, it was, it was a very weird thing where it was like, Oh, when people see this video, it's like, I'm sitting next to Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n(01:11:30):\n\nI should probably be really chill right now. I should probably not to like, don't stare too much. Because it did feel like I was like, Gotta be cool, gotta be cool. Mark Zuckerberg is right there. If you look at playback of that video, my avatar's just doing crazy wild stuff because they're tech for managing my arms and everything just didn't work very well. So I both see the potential in it. And it's clearly early days. Like it's early days, and even they can't make it work when you're sitting next to Mark Zuckerberg, you know, Wait\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:57):\n\nA minute, I gotta find this video. Where,\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:11:58):\n\nLook at there, there's video somewhere. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:01):\n\nDavindra Horizon World Zuckerberg. Was that, you think that's\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:12:06):\n\nThat's probably there. I I have a, I have a photo in my piece, but we, we didn't, like, I, we didn't do a video\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:11):\n\nFor that one. I don't see the video of that. That's a, Well, maybe better just to imagine it. Yeah. I have to say, have it, I have the Quest Pro. And I, I, you know, no one should spend 1600 bucks on this product. That's not what I would say at all. I mean, no review really should say, ever say, this is a worthwhile thing, but I wanna give VR a chance. I wanna, you know, I bought the first Oculus Rift on Kickstarter and, you know, I got HTC five. It's never, it's always been a cool demo that you lose interest within a day or two. Right. And I'm, and I don't see anything that changed my mind on this, but it's pretty amazing. I don't think I'd want to be in a teams meeting for more than 10 minutes on this thing. Sure,\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:12:52):\n\nSure. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:52):\n\nThat's part of the problem. I mean, we got a long way to go. There's a, I've talked about this before. There's a game called Richie's Plank, which is just, it's very simple. You go up in an elevator, the door opens, you're at the 80th floor, you look down and there's a little thin plank and you're supposed to walk out along it. Now, I know in my brain, I am in my living room. I'm not going anywhere. <Laugh>, I could, my body said, No, no, no, you're not. Go. No. Nope. And my brain said, Okay, fine. I could not walk out on that plank <laugh> much like you thought you were sitting to Mark Zuckerberg next\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:13:27):\n\nTo Mark Zuckerberg. I mean, I, I, in, in a certain reality, I was, You look at video evidence, there I am sitting next to Mark Zuckerberg. So\n\nLeo Laporte (01:13:34):\n\nIt is, it is good enough. Let's put it this way. It's good enough to fool my body. Yeah. and to over overrule my rational mind, which knows I am completely safe and say, and my, my pulse rate's going up. I'm sweating. I I could not walk along the plank. Now, by the way, wife said, What are you talking about? She walked right along and No problem. She's like, She's got a better\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:13:57):\n\nBrain. She, she's a much cooler cucumber than you clearly. Butra, we gotta separate. Yeah. Isn't\n\nLeo Laporte (01:14:03):\n\nThe isn't the market games isn't there for the market It\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:14:09):\n\nIs right now. But I've, you know, so I I I've been covering VR stuff since like the consumer stuff has launched too. And I did. Sundance has done some really good work in terms of getting the, an experience of the festival in VR with your headsets. And you, you could put that on, You can go look at some VR like like VR projects that people have created. And normally you'd have to go to physical space and put on a VR headset to do that. Why shouldn't you just be able to do that, you know, from your own home. There are VR chats and stuff where you could go actually congregate and talk with other people. It gave me a sense of community that I really, you know, have missed from not being able to go to film festivals and things like that. Maybe conversely South by kind of did the same thing.\n\n(01:14:48):\n\nAnd their VR interface was a ghost town. And it felt very lonely because I was there just staring at these, this like towering virtual Austin by myself, and there was nobody with me. Oh, that's great. So there, there are like, yeah, there's like cost and, you know, cost and consequences of going VR in this way. But I wanted to say, we really need to separate the idea of AR and the idea of VR and what these two things can, can actually mean. Cuz the pass through in the Quest Pro looks really good. Like it does, looks like you can actually see, like, see your desk. And I'm imagining like, maybe, maybe someday if I just wanna throw up a 50 inch or 70 inch video above my monitor when we're watching the Apple Live stream or something I'd love to be able to do that and not, you know, it's weird corner window with\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:33):\n\nThe Quest Pro, cuz they have cameras and it's color now, but the real world looks like it's virtual. It's a little shaky. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> and the virtual world looks real. So I think they, they're, they're up to some,\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:15:44):\n\nIt's so weird. <Laugh> Magical Leap also has this thing that Mount not many people have talked about, but you know, those are ar glasses, Right? So they're transparent and clear, but they've created a way to black out what you're seeing so they can, it can, like, it's almost like a cloud lop in your vision and just blacking out the real world to like, give the virtual objects more, more of a focus. But in a way it was all almost like semi VR when it totally blacks out an area. And that just feels like an interesting space. Like being, being able to hop between an AR and VR like experience could be cool, but it's not for everybody. It's not gonna be a thing anytime soon. But these companies are investing because it's gonna be something. You doc, you don't ignore the internet in 1996 when it's terrible.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:16:24):\n\nYou and I were in the internet along with the vendor in 1996. We're a little older than the vendor. Me too. <Laugh> and you too Phillip. But you, we, we, we've seen we're we've been around long enough to see products come along maybe with Promise, but not delivering on that promise and then years later delivering. You think that's where VR is right now?\n\nDoc Searls (01:16:45):\n\nI think it's almost all promise, but I, I have a lot of faith in it for industrial purposes. I think of its like the segueway, you know, Segway is gonna make, it's gonna replace great. It's gonna be, Yeah. You know, when it was still, what was it, Audrey or it had a, a, a you know, a fake name before had a, It was Ginger. Ginger, that's right. Yeah. And Steve Jobs, lots of people say this is just the most coolest thing ever. And, and what's it good for? Warehouses.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:17:09):\n\nYeah. They said it was gonna, cities were gonna be redesigned to accommodate this thing. I have two in, in my garage, by the way, <laugh>.\n\nDoc Searls (01:17:17):\n\nOh, is it? There it is.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:17:19):\n\nI realize the problem with, with Ginger on the screensavers, 20 years ago we had Wosniak who would play Segway Polo brought in five of 'em. We all zipped around <laugh>. The problem was you look like a massive dork cuz you're like nine feet tall on this thing. And I think Right. It ended up being mall cops who we make fun of and industrial uses. Andrew\n\nDoc Searls (01:17:42):\n\nWas a tourists and things.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:17:44):\n\nYeah. I\n\nDoc Searls (01:17:45):\n\nIt's very handy in big warehouses. It's hugely handy in big warehouses. And, and there are lots of those going up. I mean, you go along drive anywhere on a, on an interstate and there are these, it's all free forwarding all around you <laugh> and no longer Woods. And those are full of Segways. Some of them. I actually\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:01):\n\nThink an electric bike might be the future of\n\nDoc Searls (01:18:04):\n\nElectric bikes are is huge.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:05):\n\nThey're incredibly huge.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:18:06):\n\nYeah. I, before we leave Segway I have to tell a segue story. John Heman, who went on to become a big political reporter came to time and said he could give us a cover story on this thing that Steve Jobs is gonna be the next big thing. And they sent me up to New Hampshire to check it out, to kick the tires. And I went to the, I went to their headquarters and I took a little ride around the thing and I heard the pitch was, their pitch was, We're gonna solve China's problem. They all, everybody in China's gonna want a car and it's gonna destroy the planet, will give them Segways. But at the price, it just didn't make sense. The price point was just, it was\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:48):\n\nWacky. There's $7,000 and oh, by the way, we've had ours long enough, the batteries stop working. So I looked into replacing the batteries. It's like $4,000 each.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:18:58):\n\nYeah. Anyway, the question was do we put this on the cover? And I came back and said, No, this is not a cover story for Time Magazine. Yeah. You're probably, You did run it inside. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:19:08):\n\nA lot of hype around that. We've, so we've seen that, We've seen, we've seen technologies come along that looked like they might be world, world shaking earth shattering, and they, they don't deliver. But then we've also seen the internet, which more than delivered the iPhone. Who at 2007 only really Apple fanatics thought the iPhone was gonna change the world. It did. In ways. Even, even though optimists could not have predicted.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:19:39):\n\nI waited a, a year before I bought one, but Yeah. Yeah. Same.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:19:43):\n\nOh, I was in line for the first one. I vividly\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:19:45):\n\nWell, you always buy the\n\nLeo Laporte (01:19:46):\n\nFirst one, <laugh>. You put it right next to your, your segues. Yeah.\n\nDoc Searls (01:19:50):\n\nIt's your job. It's your job. <Laugh>. You know, when, when the iPhone came out, my, my wife who's like a not a tech person at all, very retro about everything, took one look at the iPhone and said this, I can work with that. Yeah. And got one of the first ones that was a hit right there. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And, and I, I don't think Apple, I think Apple likes to make things that are inventions that mother necessity. You take one look at it and say, I can use that. And Yep. That's what we don't, we don't have that with the veer headsets yet. No. Maybe Apple will make one where you get, you'll take one look at it and it's like, Oh, I gotta have that. But I, I can't imagine that, you know, But I remember being at one of Esther Dyson's things a thousand years ago, back when you, in the, in the pre Cambrian times when she said, Nobody's gonna ever write on glass.\n\n(01:20:40):\n\nOh boy. Was she wrong? Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, she's, you know, she's right about a lot of other things. But that was, you know, we didn't, I wanna say some, There's another thing about Apple though, which is that you look at point of point of sale, point of purchase things. I go through airports and there are restaurants that have easels with iPads in them. You know, Apple's doing hugely well in business with iPads and, and they're, and they're, and they're, you know, there are lots of different Android pads, but there's only one iPad and there's stuff being written for iPads. And you think about Microsoft, you know, they just made the operating system. They didn't make the hardware. They didn't wanna do vertical integration. And Apple's doing it brilliantly and mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, I'm just, I, you know, that may be a saturated market at this point, but I think Apple's probably doing better in business than they ever did before. Yeah.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:21:29):\n\nBy the way, it's hard to tell like, when something will take off, You know, too, because I, you remember this, Leo, the early criticisms of the first iPhone I think were legitimate. It couldn't make spend that much money for an, it couldn't copy a paste. It was an edge phone when 3G were coming out. Right. It wasn't 3g. I remember that year technology review, like put on the front cover the, the Helio Ocean, which was a phone I ended up buying instead. <Laugh> remember that was the one that, like, it flipped two ways. It flipped a vertically and horizontally <laugh>. And it was a beautiful phone. The beautiful phone is 3g. It had, it had so many of the features of the iPhone, but didn't have a touch screen. It didn't have like a, you know, even the first its iPhone didn't have an nap store. Right. Like that was the whole thing. There's the other,\n\nDoc Searls (01:22:12):\n\nOh, this was like the sidekick. I bought a\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:22:14):\n\nSide. It was like the side, but it also flips up vertically for the number pad. Oh. And it's so satisfying. Like, I think that was the best slider phone ever made. It's still in a pocket here. But yeah, we, looking at the first iPhone had so many issues by the next year, most of those things were ironed out. Like Apple started to see like, Oh, we can't just rely on web apps. We need apps, We need a centralized app store, We need 3g. And Apple learned, cuz even Apple didn't have that at the beginning. I just reviewed the Surface Pro nine with lte and you called it talk about why <laugh>, I called it a lie. But talk about a company that has been hammering this idea tablets as PCs, tablets as your laptop for 10 years and not, I don't think really making it happen. You know, like the sales had been okay. Like it took a year, it took a couple years, but they started making billions in revenue from surfaces. But you only ever really see those things on TV when a show, you know, has a merchandising deal with Microsoft.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:13):\n\nYou see you see Tom Brady throwing them on the sidelines of the NFL <laugh>. And\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:23:19):\n\nIt's like Microsoft will keep trying to make this a hit. Even though, like, I think the consumers as a whole are like, I, no, I don't, I don't want to use a tablet like this. I don't want to have a kickstand on my knee. I want to have a stable surface. And also, like laptops have gotten so light and so, you know so easy to use where the idea of having a tablet PC just doesn't, there's no real win to it, but Microsoft is still doing it. So this\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:43):\n\nAlso shows how hard it is yester Dyson. That makes perfect sense. Nobody wants to write on glass. I think she was right. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But there's so many other things. It's so hard. This is why it's so hard as a pundit, all of us, to, to, to know if something is gonna be the next big thing or not. It's very hard to know. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> all can do, like, tell all, but they do. Right. Who would, Yeah. I thought Cordy would be dead by now. <Laugh>. This is, this is the worst. John c Devork famously wrote a column saying, Nobody wants to use a mouse.\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:24:15):\n\nNobody wants to use a mouse. I remember that. Yeah. but also, like, I remember the devor act like pundits too. Like, ah, this is clearly better. Yeah. You know? No it's hard to predict consumer usability. What I can say, like from my reporting is if I put something on and I'm like, That's cool, that's interesting. I could potentially see how that's useful. Like, that's all I can do. That's all I can convey. So like the Magic Leap, nobody is taking Magic Leap seriously now. But that headset is interesting on the industrial level. Who knows like where that tech is gonna go from there. I just, I think it's cool.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:47):\n\nLittle sidelight on the Devore. Is it Devor Jacque? He's the composer. Dvorak\n\nDevindra Hardawar (01:24:52):\n\nKeyboard. Oh, I, I forget, I forget.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:54):\n\nDvorak's the composer, John c DeVos, the columnist, the Devor Act keyboard is an old school keyboard designed, not like Cordy, but designed to be more efficient. Apple just added the Devor Act keyboard to its iPhone lineup in iOS 16. Oh, wow. So, and you know who loves it? Steve Wosniak, who knew Steve Wosniak is a Devor Act keyboard Fanatic. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. He said he said he, he said, Thank you very much, <laugh> Apple. What I like most about Dvorak then was the feeling of using less energy with your fingers. Oh God. Yeah. He learned, he taught himself Dvorak. He says, I was on a flight to Tokyo. I ran Mavis Beach Beacon teaches typing in Dvorak mode. That's how long ago that was. I spent five hours learning it and never again looked at a Cordy keyboard. That's all it took. So Waz is happy.\n\n(01:25:52):\n\nAnyway. Hey, I gotta take a break. I gotta take a break. This is great conversation. Don't stop. Just put a, put a mental, put a pin in it cuz I want, I, there's so much more to talk about. But I I, but I have to take a break over. We're not gonna get you outta here in half an hour to Vira. And I wanted to. I really did. I promised <laugh>. Thank you.

And a number of people, Marco Armed tweeted, I don't like it. That, that my app Overcast, which is a podcast app right below it is, Oh, if you like Overcast, you might like this gambling app. It was at a control. Apple at one point admits there were about 30% of all the ads were gambling. They have halted that now. They have paused app store ads relating to gambling after everybody complained. That's where the money is now. Local radio station. Kgo one of the best radio stations in the country. I worked there in the nineties and again in the two thousands. I was, my show, syndicated show was on KGO until two weeks ago when KGO pulled the plug on talk radio and became sports gambling radio.\n\nDoc Searls (01:28:56):\n\nIt's horrible <laugh> that that's, that's just,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:28:59):\n\nYeah, There's so much money.\n\nDoc Searls (01:29:01):\n\nGambling is gigantic. Gambling is gigantic in sports and, and Fandule and whatever the other one is are are just, are they're big sponsors of, of nfl, The Ringer of NFL Ringer, all these things. It bothers\n\nLeo Laporte (01:29:17):\n\nMe when I watch NFL football and they're promoting gambling. Can we, let's let Pete Rose in the Hall of Fame then because it's okay now to\n\nDoc Searls (01:29:27):\n\nGamble. Well, it's okay if you're not playing that that was a problem with, with Pete Rose. But still it's correct. I mean, it, it's not possible almost to, to to follow sport. I'm, I'm a sports fan and I tune out almost everything that's just all about gambling cuz it's not, not interesting to me, but it's a gigantic part of the whole conversation is, you know, what's the line on this? What's the line on that? And are you gonna do a parlay? Are you gonna do, is God the assumption behind it is it everybody's gambling all the time. Yeah. And there's always a house, and the house is always gonna win. And so it, it's kind\n\nLeo Laporte (01:30:01):\n\nA it's amazing.\n\nDoc Searls (01:30:02):\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:30:03):\n\nKind, it's amazing. It I I don't wanna be the morality police. We're gonna vote on this in California in a week, two weeks November 8th on prop 26th and 27 to allow, it's not legal to sport. Do sports betting in California except at the casino or at a race track. And they wanna make it legal on the phone. Fan. Who's sponsoring this fan? Dual mgm. Yeah. You know, the big, the gambling thing. And there is to me a little moral thing. I don't, I feel like, I don't think anybody who has a gambling problem should have a casino in their pocket. I think that's kind of scary. I guess it's not our responsibility. I also just, I just feel like it's a malign influence. I look at Las Vegas, all those expensive, beautiful buildings, they're built by gambling. Losers.\n\nDoc Searls (01:30:50):\n\nLosers are by losers. And\n\nLeo Laporte (01:30:51):\n\nYou're all, and you know what, in the long run we're all the losers. So that's, you know. Yeah. I think it's a big problem. Anyway,\n\nDoc Searls (01:30:59):\n\nIt's huge.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:31:01):\n\nSo Apple has halted those ads. I don't know if they'll, Philip, have you heard anything about whether that that's just a temporary pause or,\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:31:07):\n\nWell, when, when Marco Armit complained loudly, Apple reacts. So I think they, I think they're gonna take it off. They don't like that look and, but\n\nLeo Laporte (01:31:17):\n\nI don't like the look of them selling ads at all. Right. Because all long, you know, they turned off, they, they put that nice setting No application tracking in my phone. Except Apple does And Apple sells adss against what you're doing. Yeah.\n\nDoc Searls (01:31:31):\n\nIt on their properties. They do it on their own properties. Don't do it out in the, But\n\nLeo Laporte (01:31:35):\n\nIt's okay for me, but not for the Right.\n\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt (01:31:38):\n\nIt's different. It's different what they're not. But it's, we're splitting hairs. It's promotion. He's not a good look promotion. It's, but I, yeah, I was actually interested I to discover that they sell, you can sell NFTs now on the app store. Really? And I've got a couple of, I I've got a couple I wanna sell. I have Jean Michelle Basquiat, Receipt <"
