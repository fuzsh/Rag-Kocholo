Whatever comes we'll get through this, together. #ThursdayThoughts #covid19UK\n\nThank you @momentumdash for bringing a little beauty to my everyday with your Chrome add-on. It's a small thing, but every time I open a tab and see a stunning picture of nature it reminds of the wonders of this planet. We need this. #gratitude\n\nI love EVERYTHING about my screen today @momentumdash My favorite place, a great mantra, and an inspiring quote. Thank you for helping me get my day started with so much positivity! #carpediem\n\nOne of the easiest, most powerful ways I've changed my daily life is by using the @momentumdash plugin for Chrome. It shows you your to-do list right on your homepage, so whenever you get sidetracked, you get a reminder when you pull up a new tab about what you're supposed to focus on. Then it asks you, what's your focus for today? and you get to set your intention and keep being reminded of it. The beautiful imagery & the quotes are all a plus, also.\n\nIf you are not already using @momentumdash , you should. Install the extension to see a new quote every day. Favorite the quote and/or tweet it out. If anything, enjoy the various pictures of various (beautiful) places each day #travel #InspirationalQuotes #mottos #LifeLessons\n\n“What do you do with a mistake: recognize it, admit it, learn from it, forget it.” - Dean smith. I love the @momentumdash chrome extension. As a traveler I love seeing a new amazing photo every day and the quotes are actually inspiring.\n\nI have been using #Momentum for years now. Getting a new wallpaper and a quote every morning is just so refreshing. Recently I started using the focus field to put my screen cast focus. Just a small tweak, but adds a lot of value. Thank you @momentumdash for this awesome extension\n\nI love this app for my focus - @momentumdash is such a great way to start the work day! Todays little quote ~\"People do not seem to realize that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character.” Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nMy @momentumdash this morning is gorgeous. For those that don't know it's an extension that displays a picture and other info when you open a new tab in chrome. My 'todo' for the day is to conquer it."
