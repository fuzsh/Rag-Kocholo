I'm in the UK and I cringe with their character assassinations and political views. If they just stuck to talking tech, their paid community would thrive, I would be happy to pay $7pm. They would also get more interesting guests. Most of my Tech friends don't listen anymore. I just listen to TWIG, and I will stop that if they get any more delusional."
