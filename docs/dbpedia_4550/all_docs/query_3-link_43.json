I learn something each show!\n\n“\n\nBoth Mikah and Rosemary have done a great job replacing Leo. I really love their chemistry, presentation skills and knowledge. Thank you Leo for allowing and giving these protégés a chance to grow and showcase knowledge/skills.\n\n“\n\nMikah and Rosemary bring you great information every week on how to get more out of your device. They expose great applications that I can use in unique ways leading to me being almost 100% iOS based.\n\n“\n\nI’m a huge fan of the TWIT network and love the addition of Mikah to the team. iOS Today is a great look at the latest iOS news and the most interesting apps. I don’t even use most of the apps that they talk about, but I really enjoy hearing what’s possible on iOS. Mikah is an excellent host and always guides an informative and fun show. Enjoying the permanent addition of Rosemary too!\n\n“\n\niOS today is THE BEST iOS podcast\n\nWith the addition of Rosemary Orchard, the show feels like a whole new show. Both Mikah and Rosemary bring LOTS of knowledge to show about the iOS platform - and make it fun and casual. Definitely a must listen/watch!!\n\n“\n\nThis is without a doubt the best home theater podcast out there, Scott is very passionate about the topic and is very knowledgable, I seem to learn something new and useful in every episode, and he also has very interesting guests that bring in even more information on various video/audio/home theater topics.\n\n“\n\nScott and HT Geeks have consistently provided top-notch guests and interviews. Most tech podcasts have me checking the clock to see when they'll be done prattling. HT Geeks is always over too soon.\n\n“\n\nI enjoy Paul’s weekly releases with helpful how to’s and/or tips and tricks for making Windows the best it can be for you. I tune in to the segments each week to improve my skills with the OS I use daily.\n\n“\n\nA must-listen for Linux enthusiasts wanting to keep up with the latest Linux news, and to discover nifty command line tips you never knew existed, from knowledgable hosts with great camaraderie\n\n“\n\nI love the Untitled Linux Show because the hosts all have deep knowledge in different areas that makes for a rich discussion on all the topics. And it's always great to find out some option you didn't know about grep or ssh. Come for the news, stay for the command-line tips."
