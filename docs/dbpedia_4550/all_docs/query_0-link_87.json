How does killing the live stream help with that?\n\nComments?\n\nI think he's making a mistake, Live is the future. If he was smart he could have monetized off this instead of killing it completely. One thing we are all taught when doing online broadcasting, is that we should not \"Feed the trolls.\" Especially after he said on the \"Tech Guy\" that the chat room was his extended \"Brain.\" He even stated \"Live\" was the future. I wish him the best, but I think it's a HUGE mistake.\n\nI agree with Linuxcooldude. I could go into who I think is really behind these decisions, but I'll just leave that out of this post.\n\nIt sounds like they're going to explore chat room options. A monthly fee to be in a member's only chat room might just work. And they aren't just phasing it out either. They're getting rid of the chat cold turkey. It'll be really interesting to see the reaction and/or fallout to this decision. I think Twit will be fine in the long run.\n\nAlthough, it sounds like they're moving more toward the cable network model of pre-taped, pre-edited programs that wouldn't need a chat room anyway. I think we're seeing that with THE NEW SCREEN SAVERS. They're cutting to packages and segments that are clearly taped and edited. I'm assuming SCREEN SAVERS and THIS WEEK IN TECH will still be live. Or maybe not???\n\nI hope one day my show gets popular enough that I have to worry about trolls in my chat room.\n\nwow...not unexpected though. I used to listen to a ton of TWiT shows, now it's down to some of TWiT and Macbreak Weekly and most of Windows Weekly and Security Now. I tend to get bored with all the Apple Watch talk on TWiT and MBW. Unless there's something really interesting I tune out and move to the next podcast in my list."
