For instructions choose your browser :\n\nFix DNS Problems\n\nA Domain Name System (DNS) allows a site IP address (192.168.x.x) to be identified with words (*.com) in order to be remembered more easily, like a phonebook for websites. This service is usually provided by your ISP.\n\nClear your local DNS cache to make sure that you grab the most recent cache that your ISP has. For Windows - (Start > Command Prompt > type \"ipconfig /flushdns\" and hit enter). For details choose your operating system :\n\nIf you can access a website at office or from a 3G network yet it's not working on your computer, it is a good idea to use an alternative DNS service other than your ISPs. OpenDNS or Google Public DNS are both excellent and free public DNS services.\n\nCheck our help page for step-by-step instructions on how to change your DNS."
