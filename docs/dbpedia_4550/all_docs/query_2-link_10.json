Well, Hey, Hey, how are you today? Leo? Leport the tech guy, time to talk computers, the internet, home theater, digital photography, smartphone, smart watches, augmented reality, the technological world around us, which is really frankly becoming, you know, subtly slowly without, in some ways, us noticing more and more weird.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:01:28):\n\n<Laugh> 88 <laugh>. I mean, honestly, if somebody from the fifties came to the modern times, a lot of things would look the same. Our cars might look more futuristic, but they're essentially the same. And then they'd see the smartphone and the internet and computers and they'd go, whoa. And our giant TVs and they'd go, whoa, whoa. 88 88. Ask Leo. That's the number? It's okay. It's okay. I'm your tour guide to the 21st century 8 8 8 8 2 7 5 5 3 6 tollfree from anywhere in the us or Canada outside that area. You could still call, but you have to use Skype out. Whoa, you can call. You can call essentially for free any phone in the world.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:19):\n\nWhoa is right. I mean, that was, that was used to be like a big deal. You'd call a friend in Europe. You'd go. There's call em, cost me $8 a minute. <Laugh> let's get this. Let's get this over with now. It's like, eh, video audio. Remember for a while everybody thought in the sixties, I remember going to the 1964 New York. World's fair. Where at and T showed off a video phone and we thought, oh yeah, the, you know, by 1990 everybody, all the phone calls, <laugh> be all. Be video phone calls in 2001 is space Odyssey. You remember that movie came out in the seventies, right? In 2001, a space Odyssey. Our hero, Dr. Floyd makes a phone call from the moon. The BA there's a moon base makes a phone call from the moon base. Actually it's the late sixties, 1968. So it was four years after 18.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:18):\n\nShe showed that video phone. Dr. Floyd makes a phone call. He gets in a booth. He still a phone booth in the, in the future. Apparently in the moon, he goes in a booth and there's a big screen. And I, I suppose for 1968, that was a huge screen. It looks like, you know, sideways computer monitor was, but it's like about the size of the screen and the Tesla. And <laugh> yeah. If you had said, you're gonna have a screen like that in your car, you don't need to go to a booth. People would go, no, come on, man. That's nuts. Who wants to watch TV in their car? Well, that's a whole nother story. He goes in there. He makes a phone call to his wife and daughter on earth to wish his daughter happy birthday, happy birthday, dear. And they, you know, they sang and all that and, oh, that's the future.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:05):\n\nAnd then a funny thing happened. It didn't happen for a long time. In fact, I remember saying on this show, I've been doing this show for 18 years. So, you know, back back 18 back when you were, you know, when you were not even born yet, some of you I remember saying nobody wants to make it turns out. Nobody wants to make a video phone call. We have Skype, we have ways to do it now. No one wants to do it. And I, my theory was, nobody wants to do it because you don't, you know, you, you don't wanna put on nice shirt and you makeup brush your hair. You don't wanna do all that to make a phone call. You just wanna, you know, make, be a slob and make a phone call. Then something happened. And I think I think the big change, the big transition for everybody, it all started, you know, maybe five or six years ago, Apple's FaceTime and so forth.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:55):\n\nBut then COVID, and we were all working at home and suddenly we're getting, you know, every call is a video call. We're zooming, we're zooming all the time. We're zooming, whom whom, zooming, whom back and forth. And suddenly we're used to it. And yeah. Yeah. Maybe you put your face on and brush your hair a little bit, make your bed before you do the phone call. Sometimes you don't just get used to it. And now it's kind of de regur. In fact, I don't know. You tell me, does this feel a little weird when you make a phone call and it's just a voice <laugh> ah, hello. I'm calling from Paris. It's like a little, it's a little old fashioned. So that's what we talk about on this show. How times is changing all around us, without us even knowing 88, 88, ask Leo until you sit back and go dial a phone.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:05:48):\n\nWhen's the last time you dialed a phone, right? <Laugh> but yet, and this is always cracks me up on the, on all of our smartphone, which look like wedges of glass. They don't look like phone phones. The icon for dialing a phone is what, it's a handset. When's the last time you saw a handset, you know that thing, you put up to your ear and there's a, there's an earpiece and there's a, a microphone and they're separated by a big P what did you know? Kids must think. I don't know about mom and dad. They St <laugh>. They seem to be worshiping ancient artifacts. <Laugh> it's a it's iOS and Android. It's a handset. I'm gonna dial a phone call on my handset. There was an article, actually an interesting article in the New York times this week about bringing back the landline. Yeah. Like that's gonna happen.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:49):\n\nOh, but she didn't really bring back the landline. She <laugh>, she spent a considerable amount of money buying one of those old plastic phones. You know, the ones used to have the Western electric. They weren't even, plastic was like hard resin. I don't know what they, they didn't even, I don't think they'd invented plastic yet. <Laugh> they're so ancient. Remember those? Maybe you don't. They had handsets. She got one of those. I probably bought it on eBay or something. This is an article in the New York times in the New York times. She bought one of these and then got some sort of it's called how to relive the pleasures of the landline.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:07:34):\n\nHow crazy is that? I'm sorry. It wasn't the New York times. It was the new Yorker. Oh, well ho it was the new Yorker with the help of an old rotary phone and a Bluetooth hookup to Dadd there's this there's the giveaway. You too could feel like rock Hudson gabbing in the bathtub says Rachel Simon, she bought. So she bought, you know, on eBay a phone for 20 bucks. She said you could find far price or vintage phones in that site. Retro phones on Instagram, friendly colors, avocado green, Barbie pink. You know, what do you ever, did you, do you remember nobody I'm I'm showing my age here. Do you remember the princess phone that had light lit up dial? Remember that? Yeah. You could still buy those and then you hook it up to your, what cell phone through a Bluetooth gadget. She says it doesn't really work very well.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:08:28):\n\nI note this setup is not without its quirks in order to get my old rotary phone to ring using the cell two Jack, I can't believe I'm even reading this in the new Yorker magazine of all places using the <laugh>, the sell to Jack <laugh>. I had to pry open the back and switch the bias spring to low position. This is like you <laugh>. This is how things have changed, right? This is the kind of article you, you, you would have in, you know, bite magazine or PC magazine compute. You know, you set the bias spring, low position, some guy, you know, in a short sleeve white shirt with big dark glasses, big, you know, thick rim, black glasses, usually a complicated set of instructions. So the clapper is sensitive enough to function. Usually the sell to Jack. No, it's in the new Yorker, the guy, the mag, the magazine of literary <laugh> upscale college, educated America.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:32):\n\nMerca how to relive the pleasures of the landline. What a world, what a world we live in. So that's what we talk about. 88, 88. Ask Leo. Yeah, I can help you relive the pleasures of the landline. Although why? I don't know the same reason people buy vinyl records. Right? Look, honestly, I don't care what your audio file buddy says. They do not sound better. Okay. That's in his head or her head. That's imaginary. They scratch, they click, they warble. They wow. They do not sound better. It's a, it is just this kind of odd nostalgia. Isn't it? That we have because everything's moving just a little too fast and let's go back to the good old days. Laura professor Laura asked me just before the show began, you ever see a movie called Logan's run. I said, oh yeah. Oh yeah. That was kinda one of the science fiction classics.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:10:37):\n\nWhen did that come out? My God. A long time ago, 1976, Laura, you weren't even a twinkle. God, your dad probably wasn't even born in 1976. No, he was okay. Michael York. It's a, it's a 23rd century in which, and it's, it says it's an era in which, in order to keep the population low, you only get 30 years and there's a little du Hickey you have on your hand, that lights up when you get to be 30 and then the Sandman comes to terminate you. <Laugh> it was okay. Interesting story. Probably a great sci-fi story. Cornball beyond belief. The other day, I, I, I wanted to watch soy green cuz soy green, another, you know, classic sci-fi movie, Charlton Heston takes place in 2022. And I thought, oh, that's interesting. I wonder what they think. 2022 is like in the, in the distant past. <Laugh> well, let me tell you.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:38):\n\nIt's not good. It's not good there. There's there's food riots there, there I will, I'm gonna spoil it here. This is back in 1973. I'm gonna spoil it. The food that they eat is called soiling green and it's made of people and they round up protestors with bulldozers. It's a very strange movie, very cornball and Logans run. Same thing. The future is nothing like we imagined not even like 2001 a space. Ossey nothing like, first of all, we don't have in 2001, we didn't have moon bases in 2022. We don't have moon bases. <Laugh> so, you know, we do have camera phones. We do have video phones though. Yeah, no. We eighty eight eighty eight ask Leo the phone number (888) 827-5536. Mike who's in the char he's a ham says I have a bake light phone. Yeah, that's what it was before plastic bake light phone that's wow.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:39):\n\nThat was that hard. It was like kind of like almost a brownish rubber, his great aunt. Got it in 1948 and rented it till 1982 and the famous Carter phone decision someday. We'll go. We'll talk about that. That's a, that's a case classic case in antitrust history that, that proves that breaking up. These big trusts is a good thing, but that's, we'll save that for another day. There are hard rubber ones. They're black and the bake of light is kind of dark brown. Yeah, that's right. I knew that. I knew that cuz I had them cuz I'm old,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:21):\n\nOld, old,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:22):\n\nOld. Hello there. My good dear friend.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:13:26):\n\nHello Leo. You sound much better than you did.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:28):\n\nI am much improved. Took two tests. Negative tests. I should take another one though. Now that I see that president Bidens relapsed\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:13:38):\n\nShould probably did you and Lisa get Paxil vid?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:40):\n\nNo. And I think Paxil Vi's what did it right?\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:13:44):\n\nIt, it appears that it does in many instances cause rebound cases.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:48):\n\nThat's what I've heard. Although it's, you know, this is also new. Nobody really knows anything. However, I do have jury duty tomorrow, so I will, before I call, I will test to make sure I don't bring the whole courtroom down.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:14:03):\n\nThat would be that would be a good\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:05):\n\nThing. Yeah. I already put it off once. Cuz they scheduled during the cruise anyway, I'm home. I'm back. I'm feeling better, much better.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:14:14):\n\nDid you at least have a good time on the boat?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:17):\n\nNo <laugh> I\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:14:18):\n\nMean I did. When, when, when did, when\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:20):\n\nDid you guys first few days? Well, so I started feeling, you know, a scratchy throat and I thought, oh I hope this is a cold. And by Thursday I was kind of losing my voice and I thought this isn't good. So at that point I thought whether I got it or not, I'm I'm gonna, you know, hang out in the room. Yeah. And and so I'm, you know, and we didn't do any, we only did one excursion cuz I didn't wanna be stuck in a bus with people and all that stuff. So anyway it wasn't as much fun as it could be. It's nice to have, you know, your food made for you and your bed made for you and yeah, I like, you know, we had a nice we had a, a nice deck out at the cabin so I could sit and watch, you know, the glaciers go by and stuff like that. So that was, oh, that's good. Yeah. It was fun. You know, we did it for the people more than for us. It wasn't you know, we had to work too, cuz we had to, you know, manage 111 people. So\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:15:13):\n\nIt was, oh that's why you had Paul along.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:15:15):\n\nYeah. Right. <Laugh> AF after we got back the the people who booked the whole thing said, oh, we should have provided you with a cruise liaison on board. Since you had so many people and we said, well, thanks for telling us now <laugh> yeah, cuz we were the cruise liaison port Lisa. So it was great. We did it because we wanted to, you know, hang out with the fans and that was really fun. Met some really neat people. We have wonderful fans. They love you. Oh thank you. Yes. so it was really great and we got some great you know, photographers on board and I saw wonderful pictures and stuff, so it's fine. Yeah. It's fine. We, we had, I had a laugh. I'm a big last California. Yeah. I forgot you were out here. Like we missed you.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:15:59):\n\nYeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:00):\n\nDid you have a good time? I\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:16:01):\n\nWaved and said hi as we drove by, you know, on 1 0 1.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:04):\n\nYeah. Great. Yeah. I forgot that you were here while we were gone.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:16:08):\n\nYeah. Nice. Tony's seafood was amazing.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:11):\n\nOh good.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:16:12):\n\nWe had a wonderful meal there.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:14):\n\nOh, I'm so glad. All right. Well we'll talk in about 10.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:16:18):\n\nAll right.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:22):\n\n8, 6, 7, 130 5,022. Don't call that number. Hello, Kim Shaer phone angel.\n\nKim Schaffer (00:16:29):\n\nHello.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:30):\n\nOh, look at that. <Laugh> you're in my screen now. And\n\nKim Schaffer (00:16:34):\n\nThen your screen\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:35):\n\nThat's so we can be sort of in the same room. So this is like\n\nKim Schaffer (00:16:38):\n\nIt's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:39):\n\nDr. Lloyd on the moon base. <Laugh> Dr. Floyd, whatever his name was calling his, you know, this is like the video call. We're kind of used to that. Do you make, when you call your friends and buddies, do you use a phone? Like just audio only?\n\nKim Schaffer (00:16:55):\n\nYes. I actually really, I hate when people FaceTime me. Oh see, because it's not usually in a good time. Right?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:01):\n\nYou haven't made your bed put on your face, brush your hair, right? Put on a lovely little frock. You haven't done any of that. This is the\n\nKim Schaffer (00:17:07):\n\nSame reason. I don't use facial identification for my phone because you don't, I don't need my phone telling me that it's not me. And it's not gonna open.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:16):\n\nWait a minute. When you use face ID, it doesn't work.\n\nKim Schaffer (00:17:19):\n\nNo, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying what I look like. What I wake up is probably not what I look like a few hours later.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:26):\n\n<Laugh> so I have a bad habit, which I'm really trying to break of looking at my phone in bed at night. Right? Use four. Am you go? Oh, I can't sleep. I'm gonna look at my phone. It never recognizes me then.\n\nKim Schaffer (00:17:35):\n\nYeah, no, I just prefer the pin code. It\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:37):\n\nWas think, cause my face is squished up. Like Mr. Potato had in the middle of the night. Who's you're at her as somebody. Oh, squished up.\n\nKim Schaffer (00:17:46):\n\nYeah. I don't need my phone saying access denied. <Laugh> <laugh>\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:50):\n\nActually I bet you use texts more than anything else I do. Yeah. Yeah. That's what the kids use.\n\nKim Schaffer (00:17:55):\n\nI, I, I, I don't like phone calls for the most part.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:58):\n\n<Laugh> yeah.\n\nKim Schaffer (00:17:59):\n\nYeah. Maybe it's cuz I take so many of them here.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:00):\n\nI dunno. Yeah. Who should who should we start this so phone\n\nKim Schaffer (00:18:04):\n\nLet's talk about phones. Lawrence has some questions on his Samsung galaxy.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:10):\n\nOkay. From Scott's bluff Nebraska. Thank you, Kim Schaffer. Hello Lawrence.\n\nCaller 1 (00:18:15):\n\nHey Leo.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:16):\n\nWelcome to the show.\n\nCaller 1 (00:18:18):\n\nThe blind guy, the Black's on the lawn.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:21):\n\nYou're the only blind guy who listens to this show. No, that's not true. Not true. Hello. But I know you Lawrence. What can I do for you today?\n\nCaller 1 (00:18:30):\n\nYeah, so lot to unpack here. Just wanted to say, I hope you get to feeling better and I'm glad to hear you back on.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:38):\n\nI feel fine. I've recovered from COVID so that's good news. Very,\n\nCaller 1 (00:18:43):\n\nYeah. You kind of have that deep very well.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:45):\n\nI have a little bit of a, Hey baby. Hey baby. You know when a man and a woman? Oh no, I won't do that to you. What? <Laugh> what, although I should record my album now, right?\n\nCaller 1 (00:18:59):\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. This would be best name. Yeah. So\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:02):\n\nSo songs to get COVID by, by Leo Laport. Anyway, what can I do for you Lawrence?\n\nCaller 1 (00:19:10):\n\nSo I'm looking at trying to upgrade a phone and I was trying to do some reviews and heard some things about on a budget and I don't know what the pros and cons of going with an older phone. And I was reading some reviews about the Samsung galaxy S 20 F Fe.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:35):\n\nYeah, the F Fe's are great. In fact, we had a, a phone company guy call. He works in a phone store say, I don't know why people don't recommend the F Fe, which stands for fan edition more so that's a two year old Samsung galaxy, but the fan editions even less expensive good choice. I think not a bad choice at all. I would also consider in fact to me right now, the best in, see, it depends what you think of as inexpensive. The best relatively inexpensive phone is Google's new pixel six a but that may even be too much for you. That's 450 bucks. You wanna spend less 200.\n\nCaller 1 (00:20:11):\n\nThat's actually that's, that's actually in, within my price. It was just,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:20:16):\n\nThat just came out. So instead of getting two year old technology, you're getting the latest with pixels at Google's tensor float chip and all of that an amazing camera and the reviews, if you'd look around, cuz it just came out, but the reviews are very positive. The pixel six a and you can either get it direct from Google many phone carriers will also have it. I think this is probably a good choice.\n\nCaller 1 (00:20:43):\n\nNo, as far as like, so I know that this and I was doing the research on the Fe the size is kind of the it's a little bit on the smaller side. On the\n\nLeo Laporte (00:20:55):\n\nSide, this is a normal, I don't know how big it is. Probably 5.7 inches. Here's the most important thing with any Android phone it's secure and because it's a Google phone, it's going to get all the Google updates for the next three years, at least. And honestly that's the more, more than anything else. Number one, concern about an Android phone. So if you can afford it, get it, don't get a two year old model. Leo accord, the tech guy, ladies and gentleman, boys, and girls, children of all ages. It's time to talk automotive technology with Sam abbu will Sam principal researcher at guy's house insights, whatever that means and podcast you're. I know that means@wheelbarings.media, you ever listened to a radio show on your phone, you will wheel bearings.media. Hello Sam.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:21:44):\n\nHello Leo. It's good to be back with you again.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:47):\n\nOh, I missed you. You were in town three weeks and I wasn't yeah,\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:21:50):\n\nI was, I waved as I drove by with my wife, you know, as we were heading up further north up to Santa Rosa and then west.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:56):\n\nNice.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:21:57):\n\nYeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:57):\n\nGreat to great to have you on. So I see you're sitting in a field with two electronic vehicles, the Ford lightning F-150 and the Rivian one RT or whatever they\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:22:12):\n\nCall it. R one T yes,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:13):\n\nR one T we actually just put up a piece you did on that, on our podcast\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:22:18):\n\nSite and, and that's why I figured I'd talk about 'em a little bit today. I had, I had these two trucks together at the same time for a few days back in early June. And after Anthony finally dug out from under his workload that you guys keep piling on him, he, he edited together. The, the\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:36):\n\nAnthony shot our super super editor. Yay.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:22:39):\n\nAnthony does a great job on that stuff. He does. He's a fantastic editor. Yeah. and so yeah, that, video's up now on the, the TWI YouTube channel. And there'll also be a a written version of that coming up on Forbes wheels in the next day or so. Nice. So, so\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:56):\n\nThese are the two main competitors for pickups. Although I understand GM's EV Silverado is selling like hot cakes too. It's not out yet.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:23:04):\n\nWell it's being pre it's pretty preorder preserved like hot preordered, like hot. It doesn't come out for almost another year. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:23:10):\n\nSo these are the two you get today.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:23:12):\n\nYeah. These, these are the two that are technically on sale right now. And if you ordered one, you know, a year, two, three years ago then you, you could, you could get one you know, about now or, you know, sometime in the coming months. But if you, if you go and try to order one now, unless you find somebody that has one that's willing to sell it you're probably gonna be waiting until well into 2023 to actually get your hands on one, if you order one now, but the, these are the two, the two electric battery electric pickup trucks that are on the market today. And they're both really good trucks in their own ways. You know, they, while they, they both cost a similar amount particularly the ones that, that I had the, the, the lightning that I had was the platinum, which is the highest trim level. It, it came to a grand total of about $93,000. Yikes. although,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:24:08):\n\nBut you can get, but people buy trucks, I guess that's not an\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:24:11):\n\nAbsurd. Yeah. Well, this is the, this is the luxury version. Yeah. you can also get, you know, they start the, the lightning pro interestingly, unlike apple when Ford calls something pro that's actually for their commercial customers and it's usually actually much cheaper. And so the lightning pro is actually the cheapest version of the lightning. And it it's, you know, it's their work truck, but although it's better equipped than their standard Excel gas trucks, which are their, the base work truck versions of their gasoline trucks and it starts at $40,000. And then, and then it goes up from there through the various trim levels. So I had the, the lightning lightning platinum and the R one T launch edition which, you know, it was also about $90,000. And although these are both pickups that both have a range over 300 miles, a hundred thirty, one hundred thirty kilowatt hour battery pack.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:06):\n\nThose are big, big battery packs, bigger than\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:25:08):\n\nBig battery packs,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:09):\n\nBigger than you'd get in a standard EV because they're big, bigger to vehicles, they're bigger\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:25:14):\n\nHeavier vehicles. Yeah. And they, they need, plus\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:15):\n\nYou need 'em for towing and for payloads, right. Mm-Hmm\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:25:18):\n\n<Affirmative> right. And the lightning will tow 10,000 pounds. The Rivian will tow 11,000 pounds. And I haven't, I haven't done towing. I didn't get a chance to do any towing with the Rivian, but I've, I've done some towing with the lightning I've towed, a 9,500 pound trailer with the lightning. And even with a 9,500 pound trailer, that thing will still spin its wheels. If you step on the accelerator part. <Laugh>, I mean, it's, it's phenomenal.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:42):\n\nThere's a lot of torque in electric vehicles and it's a hundred percent torque from the moment you step on it, unlike a gas vehicle, which ramps up. Yeah. So yeah, you can spin those wheels easy.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:25:53):\n\nYeah. Right. And, and the Rivian is smaller, quite a bit smaller than the lightning. It's about 16 inches shorter. It's really more of a mid-size truck. It's it's closer in size to a Ford ranger than it is in F one 50. Okay.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:06):\n\nYeah. The F one 50 S are big aren't\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:26:07):\n\nThey? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And it's, it's actually almost exactly the Rivian is almost exactly the same length as the Jeep gladiator. So that's the pickup truck based on the, the Wrangler. And it's really designed more as a lifestyle vehicle. So, you know, Rivian competitive set is really more people that are looking at high end Jeeps range, rovers, land rovers, that sort of thing. Whereas the, the F-150 is for anybody interested in a traditional full size pickup truck that happens to want an electric one. And so it's bigger. It's got the, the bed in the F one 50 S a lot larger but it only in the versions that they currently sell, it's only got nine inches of ground clearance. So it'll, it's four wheel drive, it'll go off road but not over big boulders and things like that. Whereas the Rivian has an airs springing suspension. And you can, if when you put it in offroad mode, it'll lift up to 15 inches of ground clearance. So you can go the kinds of places where you would go with a Jeep with a four wheel drive Jeep. And it is you know, it's, it's a, it's a much more capable offroad vehicle.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:27:17):\n\nDo you, I worry a little bit sometimes with my battery electric vehicles, because the batteries on the bottom mm-hmm <affirmative> it's. And I worry that if I, you know, to puncture that it'd be problematic\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:27:32):\n\nIf you punctured it, that would be problematic.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:27:34):\n\nYeah. so what do they do to prevent that when you go off\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:27:36):\n\nRoad, they put a big giant steel plate all the way across the okay. Essentially from, from axle to axle, there's a big steel plate. Okay. That you were, you would have to like basically, you know, lift it up with a helicopter and drop it onto a really sharp Boulder puncture\n\nLeo Laporte (00:27:53):\n\nIt. Okay. So don't do that. That's good. Yeah. I'll make a\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:27:55):\n\nNote and yeah. So yeah, you definitely don't wanna do that, but aside from that you know, it's, you know, I mean, if you're, when you go offroading in vehicles like this, and I I've, I have done it in like the Jeep grand Cherokee four by E, which is the plugin hybrid of the grand Cherokee. You know, it's kind of, it's kind of funny going offroading in a vehicle like that in electric mode, cuz you don't, there's no engine noise, you know, all you hear is the sound of the tires and, and occasionally the, the skid plate scraping over a rock, you know, as you're going over this stuff and it's, and then, you know, the sounds of nature around you which is pretty cool. And so if what you wanna do is go offroading you know, more of a lifestyle adventure vehicle, then the Rivian is probably your better choice.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:28:42):\n\nBut if you want something that, you know, has the capabilities that you expect of a traditional full size pickup truck, then the lightning is, is your best choice. So there really for, you know, it it's, you wanna pick the right tool for the job, you gotta figure out, okay, what is the job I want this truck for? And the, then you pick the, the one that best suits that so the, in the review I talk about that in the video review and in, in the upcoming written review, I talk about that a lot about which one is right for which customer. So they're both really good. One thing I do like better about the F-150 besides the fact that the cab is especially the back seat is quite a bit roomier. Is the, the, the area that would traditionally be the grill, you know, the area, that area between the headlights on the F-150, that's actually attached to the hood. So both both of these have a, a big front trunk but when you open the front on the, on the Ford, that part comes up. So you have a much lower lift over height to load stuff in. So you've got a little bit more space in there, 14 cubic feet, and you, you only have to lift it over the bumper. So it's a lot easier to load stuff up.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:29:47):\n\nPlus it tells you that that grill is completely foe. There is,\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:29:51):\n\nYeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:29:52):\n\nIt's just a fake grill cuz they don't need the, the air flow that a\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:29:55):\n\nRight gas. And then on, on the Rian that whole front FAIA is fixed in place. So you have anything you wanna load in there. You have to load over\n\nLeo Laporte (00:30:02):\n\nLittle things like that can make a, I make a big difference. There's a, you know, we only have a few minutes to talk about it. If you wanna see Sam's more than an hour long review twi.tv, it's our tech break and it's tech break episode 7 3, 5, 6. I'll put a link in the show notes. Thank you, Sam.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:30:22):\n\nThank you. Leo.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:30:26):\n\nTick break. Do you wanna stick around a little bit? Talk to the people folks.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:30:37):\n\nSure. I can do that. Oh\n\nLeo Laporte (00:30:38):\n\nRight.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:30:38):\n\nBad news. Michelle Nichols died.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:30:40):\n\nI saw that in the chat room. Yeah. Yeah. The good news is you can watch strange new worlds and see the, you know, Aurora when she's young.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:30:48):\n\nThey, they did a really fantastic job with that show.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:30:51):\n\nIt's a good show. Isn't it? Yeah.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:30:52):\n\nIt's, it's a lot of fun to watch if you like classic star Trek. It's it's great. And the, the cast, the casting they did is really fantastic in that. Yeah. Anson Mount is, is captain pike. And the actress that plays\n\nLeo Laporte (00:31:08):\n\nAraura is very believable. Even the Spock. I mean you totally think. Yeah. That's that's young Spock. You bet.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:31:14):\n\nIt's a shame they killed off hammer though.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:31:17):\n\nI haven't got there yet. Spoiler alert.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:31:20):\n\nSorry. I don't\n\nLeo Laporte (00:31:21):\n\nKnow. I,\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:31:22):\n\nI shouldn't have said that.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:31:22):\n\nI don't even know who that is. So anyway, <laugh> was he wearing a red shirt at the time?\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:31:28):\n\nNot at the time. No.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:31:29):\n\nNo. Okay. <laugh>\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:31:34):\n\nAlright. Let's see. Let's ask, answer some questions here. Let's see. Web rats comment 37 and Raptor real offroad. I'm not sure what he means by that. But I, I do expect that at some point in the next couple of years, Ford will probably build an electric Raptor an electric version of the Raptor. So that will be, you know, more competitive with, with what Rivian got see a certain YouTube truck channel just did an expedition. Oh yeah. TFL truck. That's they do great work Micah and, and Andre and the rest of the team there do some fantastic videos. And yeah, they, they did an expedition they're based in in Colorado and they drove an F-150 lightning all the way up to PTO bay, Alaska. Wow. And it's quite an adventure.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:32:26):\n\nThey, they, they do they're putting out a 30 minute video every Saturday of the high, you know, of, you know, longer videos of some of the stuff. And then they're during the course of the week, they put out some shorter videos. And so if you look for TFL truck on on YouTube, you'll find them. And they, they do some fantastic stuff. One of the, one of the things that, that those guys do that I think is, is really great. And they, you know, this is their, their specialty because they're based in, in Colorado, they they're not far from the Eisenhower tunnel. And coming down from the Eisenhower tunnel, there's a long, I think it's like a seven or eight mile stretch of highway with a 7% grade. And they do something that they call the Ike Golet.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:33:11):\n\nSo they take trucks and they go up to the, the tunnel, the Eisenhower tunnel, and they start off going down from the tunnel towing a trailer you know, usually a seven to 8,000 pound trailer or, or heavier. And then they turn when they get to the bottom, they turn around and go back up. And when they're going down, one of the things they're looking at is they have the trucks in tow hall mode. And one of the things when, when you're using a truck, that's got towing capability and has tow hall mode. Typically what it's doing, what it does is it takes advantage of when it's got turbocharged engine using the, the turbo to generate extra back pressure on the engine. So, and, and downshifting. So to help control the speed. So you don't have to use the brakes as much because when you've got a long downhill grade like that, one of the problems is if you're on riding the brakes all the way down, by the time you get to the bottom, actually usually way before you get to the bottom of something like the, I you're going to overheat the brakes and then you're gonna have no brakes left and then you're just gonna keep accelerating.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:34:12):\n\nAnd so they, one of the things they do is they measure how many times do you, do you have to apply the brakes going down that hill? And then going back up they're measuring, you know, can they, they do it at an average speed of I think it's 50 miles an hour going up the hill. And they, you know, they wanna see if they can do it in six minutes or less. And they did this with the F one 50. They've done it with the Rivian. They've done it with a bunch of other trucks. You'll\n\nLeo Laporte (00:34:41):\n\nHave to save the punchline for the end. Yeah. <Laugh>, we'll talking in a bit, our show today brought to you by Noom. You know, the fact that I came back from the cruise, not a pound heavier not a giant blimp floating back into the studio. I thank Noom for that Noom. I've been doing Noom for about a year. How can I describe this? It's not a diet and I've been on every diet in the book. What Noom weight does is it empowers you to build more sustainable habits and behaviors, lasting results, because you understand why you eat and how you eat. And it's very personalized. It's a psychological plan. Nom weight has helped more than now. 3.6 million people lose weight. I hope he doesn't mind, but one of our, one of our favorite chatters, who's on the cruise, I guess I'll leave the name out. I knew he was going on the cruise and I was looking for him and I couldn't find him. I said, where are you and Matt? What, what happened to you? He said, I'm here. I'm right here. I didn't recognize him. Not just because he shaved his beard. That was one thing. But because he had lost 60 pounds, I said, you look amazing. How did you do it? He said, Noom.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:35:56):\n\nNow, every journey is different. Your daily lessons on Noom are personalized to you to your goals. You'll notice when you sign up for Noom, you, you go through a fairly long survey questionnaire that helps you kind of understand what's going on with you and food. It's based on scientific principles like cognitive behavioral therapy. You might have heard of that. C B T. But it's not about restriction it's and this is why it's not a diet. It's not about what you can or can't eat. There are no bad foods in Noom, whatever your health goals are, the flexible non-restrictive program. You know why it's good. Cuz when you restrict something, then you want it more, right? You can't have cake. Then I want cake <laugh> for me, it was hot dogs. You can't ever, I want they. In fact, the first time I had a hot dog, I said to my coach, you get a nice personalized coach.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:41):\n\nI said, I'm sorry. I ate a hot dog. She said, what's your, what are you talking about? There's nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with that. It focuses on progress. Instead of perfection, I lost 20 pounds on Noom, not 60 Matt. I'm jealous. And I still have something to go. I'm gonna continue. You could choose your level of support. They have five minute daily check-ins they have personal coaching. They have groups as well. Some people do better with a group of supporters. People it's all in the app progress. It's not, you know, you get a graph, but it's it's of your weight loss, but it's not a straight line. It's off days are totally okay. And Noom helps you get it back on track. It's not that thing where you go, oh, I blew it. Oh I'll never, it'll never work. I'll blew it.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:37:20):\n\nNo, get you right back on track. And it's grounded in science, active, numerous lose an average. And of course it's gonna vary for everybody, but an average of 15 pounds and 16 weeks, 95% of new users say new weight is a good long term solution. And I will concur. Lisa's been on it for as long as I have she's on a maintenance plan. Now she looks amazing. Anybody who saw her on the cruise knows what I'm talking about. Numa published more than 30 peer reviewed scientific articles that inform users, practitioners, scientists, and the public about their methods, their effectiveness look everybody's different. If you like me, my whole life struggling with weight, it wasn't about the diet. It wasn't about what I was eating. It was about what I was thinking. And Noom helped me understand that. Stay focused on what's important to you with nom weight's psychology based approach.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:10):\n\nSign up for your trial today. Please do try it. Noom.Com/N O om.com/tweet.

Hello, Chuck Leo Laport here.\n\nCaller 2 (00:38:49):\n\nHey Leo. Hi. Good to talk to you again. Hey, appropriate that you played herb cuz I'm an old trumpet player, but\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:55):\n\nAh, I love it. Well, we must have known somehow. That's great.\n\nCaller 2 (00:38:59):\n\nAnd, and I'm sorry I missed you last week. I happened to be passing through Petaluma. We spent a night at the Koa there in our\n\nLeo Laporte (00:39:07):\n\nRV. Nice.\n\nCaller 2 (00:39:08):\n\nI rode my bike over to your\n\nLeo Laporte (00:39:09):\n\nOh yeah.\n\nCaller 2 (00:39:11):\n\nI knew it was closed. I knew it was closed cuz of COVID and stuff. But I did take a selfie in front of the twit logo.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:39:16):\n\nOh man. And\n\nCaller 2 (00:39:17):\n\nI said\n\nLeo Laporte (00:39:17):\n\nHi to you. I'm sorry. I wasn't here. You know, a lot of times I'll see people doing that through my window and I'll run out and say hi and stuff. So next time and that Koa is supposed to be pretty nice.\n\nCaller 2 (00:39:28):\n\nOh yeah, man. They've improved it through the years. I've been coming up there for years. Visited you a few times and it's really, if you have kids, that's the place to go?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:39:38):\n\nOh yeah. They got a playground, a pool. It's really amazing. We actually had our daughter's 16th birthday there <laugh> oh, cool. Spent all our friends spent the night, her mom and I kind of spent the night in nearby cabin chewing our nails. It was fun. Yeah. It was fun.\n\nCaller 2 (00:39:55):\n\nSo along with my traveling, I take a lot of pictures and I like to do make videos so that I can remember our trips. And I currently have a iMac 20, 27 inch, but it's late 2015. Hmm. Nowadays when I try to make a movie and I go past the 30 minutes in the rendering I don't know. I, I Mac you don't call it the blue screen of death, but I, it dies on\n\nLeo Laporte (00:40:23):\n\nMe. It dies. Okay. Yeah. There's a me, it sounds like a memory leak. What program are you using to do that? Imovie\n\nCaller 2 (00:40:29):\n\nYes, sir. Eye moving. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:40:31):\n\nSo Apple's not perfect. And I I've had this problem with photos for instance, too many photos after a while. Well, what a memory leak is, and usually this is the, what happens when you get a crash after a period of time, a memory leak, is it, it allocates memory that it doesn't release and pretty soon it runs outta memory, even though it's not using all that memory, it crashes. And I think that's probably what's happening. Would it be better on a more modern Mac? Not necessarily if there's a bug in it, but what version of Mac O S are, are you able to use on that? Not the latest and I'm thinking you should check the iMovie version. You're probably not using the latest version of iMovie either.\n\nCaller 2 (00:41:13):\n\nI I'm using Monterey. Oh. And as this one movie I'd have to, I'll have to look.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:19):\n\nThat's pretty, that's, you know, we're in Ventura territory coming up, but Monterey's the latest right now, so that's good. Yeah. Yeah. And so that probably means, you know, make sure you've updated. I movie that sounds like that's a bug in eye movie. Oh, okay. Yeah.\n\nCaller 2 (00:41:34):\n\nBut I know I'm looking at a seven year old.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:39):\n\nIt might be time to get a new one. Yeah.\n\nCaller 2 (00:41:41):\n\nAnd that, that's my second part of my question. I'm looking at I wish they had the 27 inch. I max again, they\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:48):\n\nI'm convinced they will. But they haven't yet. They only have the 20 fours and those 20 fours are really not very powerful. They're based on the M one, they're kind of more like an iPad on a stick than they are a real iMac. The rumors are that they will do this year, an iMac pro and a 27, or maybe even it'll be larger 30 inch iMac, cuz they're gonna get rid of some of those BES. But right now what you probably should look at, if you're in a hurry is a Mac mini with a with, and you do your own monitor. I'm doing that right now. The M one Mac mini is fairly inexpensive and gives you all of that power. Or if you can wait a little bit there will be, I think by the fall M two based devices, maybe even an iMac, the, I mean, if you wanna spend a little more money, it really depends on your budget.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:42:38):\n\nThe, I thought when they came out with the Mac studio display and the Mac studio computer, that that was their iMac replacement that I was thinking, oh yeah. Instead of having a, you know, one device that has a computer and the screen, and even I was thinking, you know, I don't sure I want to tie the screen to the computer cuz computers get updated at different kind of tempos and screens. Maybe they keep the screen longer, but you'd wanna update the computer. You can't with an iMac, they're all tied together. So I was thinking separates might be a better way to go. Anyway. Remember in stereos, we did that too, right? Your stereo used to do it all. And then, you know, if you got more advanced in high-fi, you'd get separates, you'd get components. And I think the same holds true for computing. So you might wanna look at either a Mac mini if, if the budget's a little tight and a nice monitor or a Mac studio display and a nice studio, rather in a nice monitor, not the Mac studio display, that's overpriced\n\nCaller 2 (00:43:33):\n\nRight. Followed you for a long time. And I know you're not in favor of those, I am looking at the Mac mini. I was kind of leaning that way.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:40):\n\nNow the one thing you're gonna give up and I don't think it's a problem, but you should know is 5k those iMac monitors? I think yours is, is it 5k might not be\n\nCaller 2 (00:43:50):\n\nI no, no.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:52):\n\nI don't think so. Yeah. Round about that time they started selling five K IMAX. So you're not giving up anything. You won't, you really don't want to get a standalone 5k monitor. I don't think it's a good idea. They're way over next. Right. So just get a 4k monitor, which is fine with a Mac mini or a Mac studio depending on your budget.\n\nCaller 2 (00:44:12):\n\nAnd\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:12):\n\nIt may fix this problem, you know, it's gonna have more Ram it's gonna it's, you know, it's a different operating system. Really iMovie for M one is very different than iMovie for Intel. So you may, I would guess this is gonna fix the problem.\n\nCaller 2 (00:44:27):\n\nYeah. When I build the, the, the video on my wife's MacBook pro laptop, it works fine.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:33):\n\nOh, and, and what, what vintage MacBook pro does you have?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:38):\n\nIs it still an Intel?\n\nCaller 2 (00:44:41):\n\nYes.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:41):\n\nYeah. Okay. Well then maybe. Okay. Maybe then it's not four years old. Maybe it's not a memory leak then maybe it's something else. Maybe it's an interaction between the computer and the, and I movie, but yeah, I think getting, I think I have, I have to think getting a newer Mac is gonna help and boy, you'll see some big differences in speed.\n\nCaller 2 (00:44:59):\n\nYeah. Can you recommend a, a display?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:03):\n\nWell, so I'm sitting in front. I mean the good news is displays are a lot cheaper than apples. <Laugh>, I'm sitting in front of a Samsung, which is 300 bucks for a, I think 20, no, I think it's a 32 inch display. I think Dell is the one I would go to. They make very good displays in a variety of prices. What you'll be able to do because you're, you're buying the display separately is get a bigger display. So I think it's great to go with a, you know, a 30 or 32 inch display. It makes a big difference. Yeah. I, the Samsung I got was, is curved and I didn't know when I bought, I wasn't paying attention, I would not recommend a curve display, but 32 inches out there. Yeah. For 300 bucks. I mean, I I'm very happy with it. There are a lot of good monitors. I would say the Dell is probably the best price performance mix. They sell a lot of them and they're very good. LG makes excellent monitors as you might expect. There are a lot of companies making very good monitors. So, you know, you're not, I\n\nCaller 2 (00:46:03):\n\nKnow you, you, you spent a lot of time with me. One of my problems with the Mac mini is the size of the hard drive. I guess I need to learn to have multiple exterior.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:46:15):\n\nWell, here's the interesting story on the M one S on the new apple Silicon devices and Alex Lindsay, who one of the hosts of our Mac break weekly show was the first to point this out internal storage on everything, except these new M twos, which they, in which they put bad, hard drives, but <laugh> so, but on an M one, the internal storage is much faster even with Thunderbolt four than anything external. So definitely get enough internal apple overcharges for it. I know they do. That's the apple tax. Yep. But get enough internal to do what you want. Don't skimp on the internal, because it is noticeably faster than anything you could do external. So it's fine though, to say, I'm gonna get a, let's say a terabyte internal cuz that's gonna be my operating system, all my applications and the, and the video files I'm working on for this particular edit and then have an external drive that you store stuff, you know, for backup for offline purposes or whereas speed isn't as important. But for, for raw speed, remember that those internal drives on the M one, all the M one devices are significantly faster than the external drives.\n\nCaller 2 (00:47:26):\n\nAnd I believe they offer a, a single\n\nLeo Laporte (00:47:28):\n\nTerabyte. I don't know if they do. Oh yeah, they do. Yeah. Don't get two that's expensive, but two, one would be more than enough single and I should correct myself. It, they, it was only the base model M two max that, that use kind of crappy SSDs. But I would look carefully at the benchmarks and there does seem to be a big difference on those internal drives compared to the externals. Hey, I appreciate the call. Great to talk to you. I want make some movies for us. <Laugh> Leo, LePort the tech guy and now Sam was cement the car guy.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:48:11):\n\nHey, so before, before I dive back into the, the car stuff, I just wanted to say I actually, I have two of these mono price, 35 inch, those curve monitors, those. Yeah. they're normally 3 99. I've bought two of them on sale. 2 99 a piece. I have one and I'm sitting in front of now and the other one's upstairs in my office. And I really like these monitors. I mean, they're not, you know, they're not color perfect necessarily, you know, you're not gonna do color grading on these, but they've got, they're nice and big. They've got a lot of real estate and for my work that I do, and then when I'm doing stuff like this, you know, I can have multiple windows up here and, and see them at the same time. That, that nice big clean real estate is very, very handy. Yeah. That's nice. And, and they're, they're, they're cheap, you know, for, for, even, even at their regular price of 400 bucks. It's, it's a really nice monitor. Good. Hey,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:03):\n\nWhat so the infrastructure bill includes a return of the EV tax credit. Now it's not been signed yet, but presumably it will\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:49:14):\n\nBe, well, it, you know, assuming that Kirsten cinema doesn't, you know, oh, is this one that submarine? The whole thing?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:21):\n\nOh, this is one that has not yet passed. There was another, it has not\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:49:23):\n\nPassed yet.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:24):\n\nOh yeah. Yeah.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:49:25):\n\nI still has to go up from\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:26):\n\nI'm real reluctant to probably this\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:49:27):\n\nWeek.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:27):\n\nYeah. Yeah. This is the one that Chuck Schumer made a deal with Joe man with\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:49:31):\n\nJoe mansion. Yeah. Yeah. And there's still, there's still an opportunity for cinema to, well, I'm not gonna say\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:38):\n\nOne of the things mansion got him to do, and I don't think this is inappropriate is to have income restrictions on the credit. Right.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:49:44):\n\nAnd, and actually that's something that I have been calling for for a long time both income restrictions and also price caps on the cars. So, you know, I mean, nothing personal Leo, but you know, if you can afford a hundred thousand dollars car you know, you\n\nLeo Laporte (00:50:00):\n\nProbably thing was\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:50:01):\n\nReally need a tax break. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:50:02):\n\nBut I didn't,\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:50:03):\n\nI mean, you know, you're your Tesla, you know? Oh,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:50:05):\n\nYeah. That was crazy. Wasn't that? But in the early days it did fuel growth of the EVs and you can argue, oh, you shouldn't have subsidized you know, companies like Tesla, but I think it was important to get EVs off the ground. It's less important now maybe.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:50:21):\n\nYeah. I mean, it's debat. I mean, the, the people that were buying them, you know, it's debatable whether they wouldn't have bought them anyway, even without the incentives. Right. But that's true, you know, to really start making these things mainstream, you, you need to start getting them into, you know, into middle class consumers. Yes. and you know, for those people, you know, the thing, the thing that, that those consumers look for when they're buying a car, one of the first things they look at is what is my monthly payment gonna be? You know, I mean, they have a limited amount of ex disposable income every month, you know, that they have to distribute between rent or mortgage and how, you know, transportation and food and everything else. And, you know, so they're looking at, okay, I can afford $300 a month, car payment, or $400 a month car payment when with the way the system was structured up until now as a tax credit where you buy the vehicle.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:51:10):\n\nAnd then you file for this tax credit next year on your, on the following year, on your tax return. And if you don't have enough taxable income, you don't even get it. You know, there was no real benefit to a lot of mainstream consumers. So what they're do, what they're doing in this bill is changing that to a point of sale rebate. So when you buy the vehicle, it gets taken off the price at the time of sale. And so it lowers your monthly payment right away, which is really important. And then they're limiting it, you know, based on income, it's $150,000 a year for a single filer, $300,000 for joint filers. And then there's, it's also capped for for cars at $55,000. So anything below $55,000, you get a break on it. And then for trucks and SUVs, it's up to $80,000.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:52:04):\n\nWhich both of those things I think are, are really good things. And there's also a $4,000 rebate for used DVS. And that's also really important as well because the vast majority of people in the us never actually buy new cars. We sell about three to four times as many used cars as used car, as new cars every year in the us, most people get by with, with used cars. And you know, there's still a lot of concern about what is the condition of the battery at the end of that, you know, when I'm buying a used EV how, how long is that battery gonna last me? So taking $4,000 off the price of a used EV is, is important. And then there are, you know, companies that are working on ways to measure the health of the battery like Cox automotive which owns Manheim auctions.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:52:55):\n\nThey're I think one the biggest, if not one of the biggest used car auction companies that when you, when cars get traded in or sold to dealers, they go to, to an auction place like Manheim and they get sold or off lease used cars come in, they go through typically through Manheim or one of their competitors, and they get sold to, to car dealers to then get sold onto consumers as, as used cars. What Manheim has done is they bought a company that has developed ways to do health testing on the battery. So they with used DS. Now they provide a health report on that battery. So you can have more confidence in the condition of that battery and that's, that's gonna help a lot as well. But to so in the, in the chat user 27 49 is asking, will Teslas be included in the eligible car.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:53:45):\n\nSo the EV credit yes at least some, some will, depending on the price point. So things like you know, model three up to up to $55,000 would be included. So lower end model threes, not ne not a model three performance and then model wise you know, up to that $80,000 price point, they start about 63 64 now. So the, again, the entry level model wise would also be included something like the, the model S plaid or model X. You're not gonna get a tax credit on those. And, and frankly, I'm fine with that. Same thing with, you know, Porsche Tycon, you're not gonna get a tax credit on that. But you know, the, the, the more affordable vehicles will definitely continue to get get the tax credits, assuming this passes it's still you know, they still have to get 50 senators to actually vote for this thing.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:54:37):\n\nAnd there's still no guarantee that that's gonna be the case depending on what Ms. Cinema decides to do. So let's see yeah, the, the part about the the part about union made vehicles that was not what this user 27 49 says earlier in development, the bill was written to cover only union made vehicles. No, that's not true. They had incentives for all vehicles, but there was extra incentives for union, for vehicles that were built in north America, and then an additional incentive for vehicles built in, in UAW plants. That's gone now it's just vehicles that are built in north America. So that's the other part of this. They have to have a certain percentage of north American content to qualify. And again, Tesla makes a lot of their vehicles here in the us in California and a handful now in, in Texas.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:55:28):\n\nSo those, those would all qualify if they meet the price targets. Let's see, there was also a question in the chat about battery recycling. That is something that is happening already and it's going to be accelerating dramatically over the next several years up until now. There's been limited opportunities for re recycling because they're, frankly haven't been that many VE EVs that have reached end of life with batteries to recycle but Redwood materials which is started by JB Strobel, the former CTO of Tesla. They they've been recycling battery materials for a couple of years now. And what they've been doing is they've been collecting used consumer electronics batteries from phones and computers and all kinds of other devices, as well as getting scrap material from the production of batteries for Tesla vehicles in Nevada, as well as from the battery plant that produces the batteries for the Nissan leaf in Tennessee.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:56:24):\n\nAnd they produce currently about they the recycling process basically gets gets you back to the raw materials needed to build new batteries. And it's it's actually a surprisingly efficient process. And they're producing right now about six gigawatt hours worth enough materials for about six gigawatt hours worth of new batteries. And then after that, it it goes to or they're, they're planning by 2025 to grow that to a hundred gigawatt hours, 500 gigawatt hours by 2020 by 2030. And then there was a question about rejecting the battery when it's full. This is something I talk about in the video and it's something that Tesla or Ford and Rivian do differently. Rivian when the battery is full it simply stops reining. And if you, even if you have it in one pedal mode you don't get as much deceleration when you lift off the Ford and some other vehicles like GM vehicles and Ford vehicles and, and some others, when you when the batteries full, it just automatically starts blending in the friction breaks. So you get consistent performance. And I think that is a much better solution and that's the way everybody should do it. So\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:31):\n\nHave I love my one\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:57:32):\n\nConsistent\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:33):\n\nBehavior. My one pedal driving is the place.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:57:35):\n\nOh, it was great driving through the, the Christy roads and love in Russian river valley, along the coast. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:41):\n\nTvs are the greatest. Hey, thank you, Sam. Have a great week.\n\nSam Abuelsamid (00:57:45):\n\nI'll talk to you next week, Leo.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:47):\n\nWhy? Hey, Hey, how are you today? Leo LA port here, the tech guy, time to talk computers, the internet, home theater, digital photography, smart phones, smart watches, all that jazz. Eighty eight eighty eight, ask Leo phone number eight eighty eight, eight two seven five five three six S toll free from anywhere in the us or Canada. If you're outside that area still, still, you should call. You should just use Skype out or something like that. 88 88, ask Leah website tech. I labs.com. We always put the links to everything. You know, that shows up on the show up there plus audio and video from the show and a transcript two that takes a couple of days, but we'll get that all up there. This is episode 19 14, 19 14 tech ilab.com. I'm looking at my text messages and I've got a few weird ones that say, are you home? Or how are you with a number?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:58:50):\n\nI don't recognize this is the new text scamming. And you should be aware of it. If you get text from a ostensibly a wrong number article from NBC news written by Kevin Collier, he says, he talks about a text message. He got that said, unah good evening. Tomorrow morning. The contract time of 10:00 AM has shifted to 3:00 PM for signing. I don't feel well. I need to go to the hospital tomorrow morning to see the doctor. Now you, you might, if you're a good Samaritan, you might think, oh, wow, that's an important message. I'm not Unna the person sending it probably should know that Unna didn't get this. I did. So you might respond and there would be your mistake. Callier says I'm not Unna, but I'm sorry to hear that then gets in a conversation with the person eventually, which says within a few minutes, she was offering to help me invest in cryptocurrency.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:49):\n\nThey seem like such nice people. And of course, I, most, most of us are cynics <laugh> and we're gonna look at that and go, yeah. All right. And I'm not buying crypto from you. Yeah. Right. But this is the problem. There are lonely people out there, especially older people who relish the chance to have a conversation, even though it's with a stranger and it doesn't take long for the stranger to gain their confidence and then take advantage of them call your quotes. The deputy district attorney in charge of high tech crimes in Santa Clara county, accidental text messages have become one of the most common, new ways to CR to trick people.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:00:37):\n\nAnd they come in and they sound like they're. This is where they're really, you know, I can ignore something that says, Hey, how you doing? But if it says, Hey, can I make an appointment for my dog at your salon? Or, you know, something that sounds important, or I'm not gonna be able to make it to work. I hope you can get my shift covered. And you might feel like, oh wow. You know, that's some nice young person who's, you know, being a responsible employee. I better let them know. I don't want 'em to get in trouble at work. No, it's not. <Laugh> it's not, it's not what you think it is. It's some scammer probably oversees you know, trying to take advantage of you. So, and you know, I think anybody, I think those of you who listen to this show know better, right?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:22):\n\nYou're not gonna fall for that. I get a, I it's, this all started in the last few weeks. I've starting to get a lot of these. Just, hello? Are you there? What's up, but they're getting more sophisticated now, you know? Oh, man, last night was amazing. I have your coat. I'm sure you would like it back, but that's not me. We might wanna check that number cause I that's just, I'm not no. Mm, no. So just a word of warning. And I know most of you are smart, not gonna fall for that, but tell your friends and family, you know, tell the older, lonely people in your, in your life who might just be lonely enough to get in a conversation with some stranger on text messages. That's a bad idea. That's a bad idea. Eighty eight eighty eight, ask Leo. That's my phone number back to the phones. We go and on the line from Hollywood. It's Jim. Hello, Jim.\n\nCaller 3 (01:02:25):\n\nHi. It's a pleasure to speak with you after all these years.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:28):\n\nWell, I'm glad you called. We're trying to get more first time callers. So I appreciate, I appreciate you doing that.\n\nCaller 3 (01:02:33):\n\nYeah. Some weeks ago you had a caller said he was a dinosaur because he knew F as well as Fortran. Yes. On that time scale, I guess I'm a blue green algae. Oh, my late fifties. I was involved in computer hardware development back when they still used vacuum tubes.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:48):\n\nWow. Where were you working?\n\nCaller 3 (01:02:50):\n\nIt was at UCLA.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:51):\n\nFantastic with the great late great John postal. <Laugh> wow. That's so fantastic. Those were the days, you know, I, I was listening. I just read a book about John V Neman who was kind of created the blueprint for a modern computer. And they talked about the early days of Enoch and Leo, which was a very early computer. Fascinating, fascinating and exciting time.\n\nCaller 3 (01:03:16):\n\nYeah. This was a swag SW I can still read hoists off a punch card.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:22):\n\nHold what? No, really?\n\nCaller 3 (01:03:23):\n\nYeah. And of course you'd have a box of 2000 of them. And if you ever dropped it, you had the floor sort to deal with.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:29):\n\nOh, the floor sort that, that leaves 52 pickup. And the dust when it comes to no fun. The standards, Western automatic computer. That's it? Harry Husky's SW. Yes. Oh man. And, and, and were you wiring those those tubes up?\n\nCaller 3 (01:03:47):\n\nNo, it was already built. I was an undergraduate. Then I got a job as a technician to move it from the north end of campus to the south.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:54):\n\nOh man. 2300 vacuum tubes.\n\nCaller 3 (01:03:58):\n\nYeah. It had a high speed memory that had 256 words. <Laugh> of <laugh> of 37 bits. Each. It had a 64 microsecond access time. It used five inch CellScope CRTs to store the data as, and little piles of electrons.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:19):\n\nOh, wow. Did you, did they did they ever did you ever play space wars on those ASCI scopes? I think\n\nCaller 3 (01:04:25):\n\nActually we had programmers who wrote a moon Lander program.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:29):\n\nOh, fun.\n\nCaller 3 (01:04:30):\n\nAnd since there was an audio monitor that you could put on various circuits, they wrote music for it.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:36):\n\nWow.\n\nCaller 3 (01:04:37):\n\nYeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:38):\n\nWow.\n\nCaller 3 (01:04:39):\n\nYeah. And you had to walk lightly, you jumped up and down. You could gets loose. <Laugh>\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:44):\n\nThose vacuum tubes would work their way out as they heated and cool. You probably never turned off for that reason.\n\nCaller 3 (01:04:52):\n\nIt wasn't turned off a lot. Yeah. 20 tons of air conditioning.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:58):\n\nOh my goodness. By the way. And I'm looking at the Wikipedia article about it in 1952 Rael Robinson used it to discover the five Mercent primes.\n\nCaller 3 (01:05:09):\n\nYeah. It, it held the words, the world's largest Mercent prime record. Amazing.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:14):\n\nAmazing. And it did the calculations involved in the analysis of the structure of vitamin B12, awarding as a result, awarding Dorothy Hodgkin and Nobel prize in chemistry in 1964. That is amazing. Yeah.\n\nCaller 3 (01:05:27):\n\nFirst use was calculating ballistic tables for the Navy. Sure.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:30):\n\nLike all computers that's the, the first use of them during world war one and two was to not one world war II was to figure out where that Shell's gonna land <laugh>, which is not, not an easy thing to do. Ah, this is cool. Was it how big was it? Was it the size of a, a\n\nCaller 3 (01:05:48):\n\nWell, it, it was the size of a, I'd say a van,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:53):\n\nA van. Okay.\n\nCaller 3 (01:05:54):\n\nIt wasn't the size of a semi truck,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:56):\n\nNot so\n\nCaller 3 (01:05:57):\n\nBig. And in fact, if you wanna see it, it actually played the maniac in the magnetic monsters, starring little Richard Carlsons\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:07):\n\n<Laugh> it was in the movies. Yes. It was a movie star <laugh>\n\nCaller 3 (01:06:11):\n\nYes. It, it absolutely was. And that was sort of a rain very strange predecessor to my running off to Hollywood where I've spent the last half century plus.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:23):\n\nAnd what have you been doing in Hollywood?\n\nCaller 3 (01:06:25):\n\nRecording actor's voices. Nice. And I,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:29):\n\nSo you work on the sound stage, your sound recordist or is it after?\n\nCaller 3 (01:06:31):\n\nYeah, I'm, I'm a production sound mixer. Oh, nice. Yeah. I got to work on the last three years of the first avatar.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:38):\n\nOh, wow. Fun.\n\nCaller 3 (01:06:39):\n\nAbsolutely amazing.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:40):\n\nI bet. Three years.\n\nCaller 3 (01:06:43):\n\nYeah. It took five years. Holy moly. And they kept their production sound mixers kept aging out, going off to other shows. So\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:52):\n\nIt's like, I can't do this anymore.\n\nCaller 3 (01:06:53):\n\nYeah. Oh no. It was just incredible. Oh,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:56):\n\nWe can. We have, we can have many, many conversations, including, you know, a conversation that happens a lot on this show. Why can't I understand the vocals on movies anymore? How come I, I can't understand the actors\n\nCaller 3 (01:07:09):\n\nThat has a, that has a very simple answer. The director, the editors, the producers have been working on that movie. They know the dialogue by heart. In fact, if you cut the dialogue track out, they'd still hear the word. Aha. So when they're doing the rerecording mixer, when they take the sound effects and the music and the dialogue and put them all together. Yeah. The effects people are all there. The music people are all there. The production mixer is never there\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:35):\n\nAnd that's who should be there. Cause he's the one who's gonna say.\n\nCaller 3 (01:07:38):\n\nThat's why\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:39):\n\nIt's inaudible.\n\nCaller 3 (01:07:40):\n\nThat's why they bury the dialogue. Yeah. And if you're doing a comedy, they don't have a candle laugh track to put in on the stage as a result. They don't boost the dialogue after the punchline. And so it gets lost too because the audience hopefully is laughing and right.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:58):\n\nAnd stuff. It gets drowned out. If it's a good comedy <laugh>\n\nCaller 3 (01:08:03):\n\nIf you do, you do have a sound bar and you have control over the relative levels. You can boost the center channel\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:09):\n\nDialogue. That's exactly what I do. Big help. Yeah. That's exactly what I do. But wait a minute. Now you called for me to give you some help. So maybe it's my turn to help you.\n\nCaller 3 (01:08:17):\n\nSure. in the early eighties I wrote my first textbook. I see no reason to take my secrets to the grave. I used a brother WP, 80 and 85. Wow. A good word processor. Yes. It was great. It had keys for cut and paste and insert. It\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:30):\n\nWas like a typewriter, but it had a screen, right? Yeah.\n\nCaller 3 (01:08:33):\n\nYeah. It had, it had a built in Daisy wheel printer. You could put a stop code in the file and change the font and you could do diagrams and stuff. That way.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:42):\n\nI remember Steve Martin telling me he wrote cuz he's a computer buff. He wrote the three Amigos on a very, a similar, old word processor. And he said, if I moved a paragraph of text, I'd have to get up and go get a cup of coffee while I waited for the machine to reorder the text.\n\nCaller 3 (01:08:59):\n\nYeah, no, no. It was fast. That way the problem was to use it used floppy. Mm. So I wound up for my first book having to put one chapter on each floppy. Oh my anyhow, I'm now writing my Magnum Opus. Oh good. We've got newcomers. Come in. We have no more apprenticeship programs and everything. And it's currently over 1600 pages and 600,000 words.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:20):\n\nOh this will be a classic though. This is so important. Oh my God. When it comes out, I want to interview you. I wanna talk about this.\n\nCaller 3 (01:09:27):\n\nYeah. My first, my first book using time code in the real world. And that was our E E L made it to a third edition before the knowledge was widespread enough that they didn't need it anymore.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:37):\n\nAnd then the reels went away and <laugh> yeah, exactly. Well, that's the problem. It moves constantly. I, I, I wanna read this book, so how can I help you? This is important. Okay.\n\nCaller 3 (01:09:46):\n\nI'm using word. Yeah. And everything was going fine. And like autopsy, my file kept growing and yeah. Word started slowing down. Right. I was started with word 2016 and I thought, oh, it may be a computer problem, but, well, I got 20 gigs of Ram and I've got an M M two, two terabyte memory. I've actually got two of them in there with a file in one and the program and the other, I went online and I found out word doesn't like big files. Yes. And it, it, anything over 20 megabytes has got a problem. I was over 30 that's right. Well, I Dre all the images here.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:21):\n\nYou're, you're back to a chapter <laugh> of floppy disc.\n\nCaller 3 (01:10:24):\n\nI really don't wanna do that because of the interactive table of contents and everything. Oh\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:28):\n\nYeah,\n\nCaller 3 (01:10:28):\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. I upgraded to word 2021 that actually ran a little bit slower.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:35):\n\nOh\n\nCaller 3 (01:10:35):\n\nLord. Yeah. I, I tried defragmenting the file. It made a slight improvement, but I've been online looking, trying to find a professional word processing program cuz by the time comes, when I need my interactive index this one will, I will have to go have dinner while it does stuff. Right. And I cannot find anything that any review says is any better than a word.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:01):\n\nWell, everybody uses word. Is it, are there things better? Yeah, I think so for in the problem is of course the additional stuff you wanna do, like the automatic indexing. But if you were to write in a simpler program, a text focused program, for instance, and then put it in word and go to dinner while it's doing the hard stuff, you could get kind of the best of both worlds. There are some things you can do to speed up word. And I have an article that I'm gonna put in the show notes, things like disabling graphics, acceleration. Why is that on? You don't need that. You know, deleting your temporary file sometimes, you know, keeping track of those can really slow downward. And of course you can and you probably already are doing this periodically optimize the document to make sure that it's fully indexed and that will speed things up as well. So I'll put this in these show notes.\n\nCaller 3 (01:11:55):\n\nYeah, please do. I'm aware of either of those two.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:58):\n\nYeah. Optimizing by itself would make a big difference. But then the other thing you might wanna look at is just, you know, you're gonna think I'm nuts. I use EAX you'll remember that it came much later than the swag, but I use a text only editor because it's better at handling large documents. Text is much simpler, right?\n\nCaller 3 (01:12:21):\n\nYeah. Can you structure it in an outline form?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:24):\n\nYeah. Well, you know what, the thing that's interesting about Emax which has been around since 1971 is it's modern, even though it's a text interface and it doesn't seem modern. It is so widely used that people have really kept it up to date and yes, with org mode, for instance, there's a lot of outlining capabilities. There's a lot of structure in there. I'm not gonna recommend EAX cuz that's a steep learning curve. You won't be able to finish the book in, in time, but stay, hang on the line. Cause I'll, I'll help you a little bit more off here. Sure. Thank you. Leo Laport, the tech guy are you in a Mac or a PC? I guess that's the first thing.\n\nCaller 3 (01:13:04):\n\nYou're gonna hate me. I'm a PC person.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:13:06):\n\nI don't hate PC people. That's okay.\n\nCaller 3 (01:13:08):\n\nYeah, because a lot of programs I need you can't get in Mac.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:13:12):\n\nYeah. so let me think on the PC, you know, on the Mac, for instance, there's a really good program called BB edit, which is a text editor thing is that text editor. Isn't gonna have all the features you like, but there's no reason you couldn't write chapters in text and then put 'em in that word document. You don't want, what you don't want is the slow down while you're writing, right?\n\nCaller 3 (01:13:35):\n\nYeah. because sometimes it will freeze up on me. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:13:40):\n\nSo you wanna be able to write as fast as your brain works <laugh> but you don't. I think you probably don't mind after you've written a chapter or two cutting it and pasting it into word and, and you know, not as long as you're not writing in word, you still want those word features. I think. Yeah.\n\nCaller 3 (01:13:57):\n\nYeah. Well see one of the problems is some of the information is spread out over the entire length of the\n\nLeo Laporte (01:14:03):\n\nExactly. So it needs access to the whole thing. When\n\nCaller 3 (01:14:05):\n\nI read part of it, I say, oh, I gotta go back to this chapter and you know, fix, fix that. So it'll be consistent then go back where I was with the interactive TC.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:14:18):\n\nLet me give you a recommendation that may or may not work for. You can try before you buy it's designed for exactly what you just described. It, it, the idea is you take notes, you keep the notes, you are able to refer back and forth to the notes, all of that stuff. And it's free to try. So I would at least open it and try it's called Scrivener. It's really designed for writers to do this. And I think it might be the solution for you. It's from a co the website is literature and latte.com <laugh> but if you search for Scrivener, yeah. The name should tell you this is made for writers, but it's made for writers that do a lot of research. So it side by side has it, it, it, it completely organizes it. I think you could write the whole thing in Scribner, to be honest, it has your notes available to you. Just take a look at it on the website. And it's really designed for very long 1600 pages is long, but it's designed for that.\n\nCaller 3 (01:15:23):\n\nYeah. I don't need separate notes. I just need the ability to find stuff. Right. You know, I, what\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:29):\n\nHappens though with Scribner is you keep it open as you're doing whatever research you need to do. And you write the research in Scrivener, not as part of the book, but as a separate part that is then linked to the book so that you have it there. If you don't need it, you don't have to use it. But it will, but you can have photos. You can have PDFs, you can have text all sorts of stuff, but I think it will especially well handle super large files. It does then export to word format. So you wouldn't, you wouldn't be left out of word and you may well wanna use word for the final index and TC and\n\nCaller 3 (01:16:03):\n\nAll that. No. Can I import a word document in the\n\nLeo Laporte (01:16:07):\n\nScrivener? Yes, I think so. Yeah.\n\nCaller 3 (01:16:08):\n\nOkay. I certainly will check that out.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:16:11):\n\nI think that's that's it was designed specifically for what you just described, which is huge amount of text, cross referencing searching. You can com you know, you compose the sections you wanted really as fast for reordering or rearranging. I think this is kind of what you want. When, when do you think this book will be out?\n\nCaller 3 (01:16:36):\n\nWell, I, I had hoped to finish the first draft by the end of last year, but the technology is expanding exponentially and I have to go back and keep rewriting stuff with all the new\n\nLeo Laporte (01:16:47):\n\nGear that it changes constantly. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nCaller 3 (01:16:50):\n\nI tried to write this book throughout my entire career and I was working so much. I couldn't keep up with the time. I bet I've been working on it now for over two years because of COVID cuz I've got this time,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:17:01):\n\nTime. Perfect time. Yeah.\n\nCaller 3 (01:17:02):\n\nYeah. You know, I'm I'm in my eighties, fortunately, my brain still works.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:17:06):\n\nYou sound sharp as attack. Absolutely. Hey, I have to run. Yeah. Jim let's stay in touch though. All right. Thrilled about that project. Thank you so much. All right. Take care. Scrivener. It's about when the SW computer <laugh> came out, Leo Laport, the tech guy. I love it. Love it. It says let's get a little Glen Miller on there. Eighty eight, eighty eight ask Leo's the phone number. I spent a little more time talking with Jim. He's got that big book, project, 1600 pages everything, a, a modern day sound record us needs to know mixer needs to know to make a movie or a TV show. Man, this is gonna be good. What? I didn't ask him. I bet he has a clever title cuz his last book had a clever title. <Laugh> so I bet you, he, I didn't ask him, but we'll find out I'm gonna stay in touch.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:17:52):\n\nEnded up and I think some of you might be interested in this answer. He's trying to do it in word. Word is just a pig. Let's face it. It is. It always has been. And you know, this is a problem with modern day software in general, the designers can start to assume, oh, you've got huge amounts of memory, huge amounts of processor. You fast, fast, hard drive. You're not gonna have any problem handling my pig of a program so they don't optimize it. They don't improve it. They just make it bigger. They add features cuz that's how you sell stuff. These days is having all those features and you just get a bloated pig, slow piece of software. And I think that's what's happened with word. I mean honestly, how many, how many new features does a word processor need? Right? It doesn't. But in order to keep selling word 20 16, 20 18, 20, 20, 20, 22 and keep, they gotta keep adding something.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:48):\n\nIf you're using 2016, how are they gonna get you to buy 2022? We've added the super new self writing feature. Never write a word again, let word do it. They they're ma you're making stuff up now, but everything they add slows it down. And of course they never take anything out. So it's just bigger and slower. There are, as a result, there are quite a few programs now designed for writers to get out of the way things as simple as typo, which is just a blank screen of paper. You've probably seen that or the bear on the Mac or IA writer. But the one I thought he maybe should take a look@isfromawebsitecalledliteratureandlatte.com. And it's a program called Scrivener. And it's really designed for writers who are gonna write something giant, something big, lots of words, but also have research and notes. They want indexes tables of contents. They wanna rearrange and it does it all super fast. So I think that's the one to take a look at Scrivener Leo Laport, the tech guy now with a super pine flavor. Super pine centered. Hello Chris. Marwar\n\nChris Marquardt (01:20:12):\n\nHello? How are\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:13):\n\nYou? I am great. How are you?\n\nChris Marquardt (01:20:16):\n\nI'm doing good. I've used Scrivener to write two books.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:19):\n\nOh, there you go. <Laugh> I don't say no more. Say no more.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:20:25):\n\nIt's good. It's good. It's good. It's a bit of a learning curve, but it is, it it'll handle the load for sure.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:32):\n\nYeah. I mean what's the longest book you've written\n\nChris Marquardt (01:20:38):\n\n350 pages. Something\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:40):\n\nLike that. Yeah. Yeah. He says his is 1600 pages\n\nChris Marquardt (01:20:45):\n\nNow. Yeah, no problem. It'll it'll handle that.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:47):\n\nIt's designed to do that. Yeah. It's now I've never used the windows version. But the me neither, but the Mac version is, is just a classic. And I imagine if they're put and they are putting out a windows version that it must work well,\n\nChris Marquardt (01:21:01):\n\nWhat I really like as you said, easy re resorting of things, but what I really came to love is the sort of built in lightweight project management. Yeah. Like you have an instant overview of how far you are with which part.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:21:13):\n\nSee, I think he'd really appreciate that without slowing it down, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think this is,\n\nChris Marquardt (01:21:21):\n\nYou gotta spend some time with it though. That's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:21:23):\n\nTo get, get, to get going. Yeah.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:21:26):\n\nTo, to get used to it and everything, but\n\nLeo Laporte (01:21:28):\n\nIt's not word you have the\n\nChris Marquardt (01:21:29):\n\nStructure in there.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:21:30):\n\nThink him out how much time he had to spend to get to used to word used to word <laugh> word is nuts. We just it's\n\nChris Marquardt (01:21:38):\n\nIsn't isn't that amazing word had Al has always been so bad at more than, I don't know, a hundred pages or something. Yeah. And it never became bad. Never\n\nLeo Laporte (01:21:47):\n\nTerrible, terrible. Oh, it's it's time to talk about our fine sponsor. Click up. What if you could get a day, a week back every week from work one extra day, every week, cook healthy meals, write your great American novel or just watch some good reality TV. That's what I would be doing an extra day a week. That's what click up offers you. It's a productivity platform that will save you a day of week of work and it's guaranteed, right? That's a big deal.

You got all these tools to keep track of your calendar, your address, book, your documents, you know, your sales tool, whatever it is that you use for work. And it's in all different places, all different systems you gotta remember from one or the other and then getting data from one into the other.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:22:46):\n\nIt's complicated. There's gotta be a better way to get through the daily hustle. And there is, I'm very happy to say, there's click up C L I C K click up up. It began with the premise the productivity was broken. So they said, what can we do? Well, here's one thing we can do. We can be one tool that houses everything. You need, your tasks, your projects, your documents, your goals, your spreadsheets, everything right. And one platform.

And of course the bigger the team, the more value click up is built for a team of any size from one to a thousand plus. And it is packed with features and customization options. No other productivity tool has. So you can make it exactly like you wanted.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:33):\n\nBut, and for me, this is important. It also out of the box just works great. So you don't feel like, oh, I gotta get it all configured. No, it just works great. And then as you use it, you can make it better and better and better. That's not a surprise. 800,000 highly productive teams, 800,000 use click up today.

Now back to the program, it's time for Chris Marwar photo guy. I missed you over the last couple of weeks, man. Chris is my person. Well\n\nChris Marquardt (01:24:54):\n\nI missed you. Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:55):\n\nMan. My personal photo sensei at sensei photo S E N S E I that's where he does coaching. And he also of course takes beautiful images. You could find him on flicker and of course, links and sensei.photo and writes books, his film book and his wide angle photo book are class spec. You're updating the film book now, which is great.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:25:17):\n\nWe're working on that. Yes.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:25:19):\n\nAnd does photo workshops and blesses us each week with his appearance? It's time to review the photos.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:25:30):\n\nIt's time to review the, let me check the beautiful assignment. Mm.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:25:35):\n\nThe one that we\n\nChris Marquardt (01:25:37):\n\nDrove from the fishbowl and I'm so happy. We have 44 people who contributed to that. And this was a difficult one because you know, if, if you ask for beautiful pictures, there could be beautiful pictures of things of anything, or it could be pictures of things that those people like and find beautiful. And that is of course in the, the eye of the beholder. So making a choice between different things is really difficult. And I ended up choosing things that I like because that's the easiest. But all those pictures are beautiful. Just need to get this out of the way first. Amazing photos. Everyone did a, did an awesome job. So I've made a choice of three. And the first one I chose because it is it is generally considered one of the most beautiful birds photo of a peacock Scott mag lain. Oh,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:26:35):\n\nNice. That\n\nChris Marquardt (01:26:37):\n\nAnd it, yeah, it, the only, the only, the only critique I might have is that I kind of wanted really centered, really symmetrical slightly to the sides. Yeah. That's but that is just\n\nLeo Laporte (01:26:52):\n\nYou very, you could fix that. That's easy to fix.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:26:53):\n\nYou could fix that. You could fix it. You CRO you could crop that. But I like the, the way the Scott filled the screen with it, there's no background that distracts from the peacock mm-hmm, mm-hmm, <affirmative>, it's it's filling the filling. The, the frame with things is usually a good idea, especially when you wanna be really clear on what that thing is about. So Scott,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:27:18):\n\nNice job love peacocks. We have them in our backyard and they're the, the picture, this picture is the reward for a year long. They're very noisy.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:27:32):\n\nYeah. I've, I've been around peacocks and yes they\n\nLeo Laporte (01:27:35):\n\nAre. But, but when the males are displaying, man there, that is beautiful. Wow. Yeah. Very nice.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:27:42):\n\nAnd second one is by Gerald Wiley,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:27:45):\n\nWho a macro\n\nChris Marquardt (01:27:46):\n\nPhoto. It's a very beautiful macro photo of a yellow rose with a lady bug on it. And everything about this picture is great. There is a neutral background in this case, a black background. So there's no distraction there. The, you, you have a slight out focus, which really, which really leads your eye to where the focus is, and that is on that lady bug. And that's, it's a good one. It's a good one.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:28:16):\n\nNo, I love the texture of\n\nChris Marquardt (01:28:17):\n\nReally happy about\n\nLeo Laporte (01:28:18):\n\nThe pedals is so beautiful. Yeah.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:28:20):\n\nIt doesn't, it doesn't say what camera Gerald used. I'm I'm suspect that it might even be an iPhone in portrait mode, but that doesn't really matter cuz it's a beautiful photo. That's right. The, the color contrast is unusual. Normally you would contrast something red with something green. So here it's both on the warm side of the spectrum, orange and red, but still, I mean the, maybe that, that, that's what I think makes it interesting. Mm-Hmm <affirmative> so mm-hmm, <affirmative> really good job. Really good job. And last but not least Marjorie, no Mitch, M Mitch.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:28:56):\n\nI know this guy. It's mark. Yes. In fact, this is from our cruise.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:29:01):\n\nSo you were there. Okay.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:29:03):\n\nI have this picture. I know this exact glacier in glacier bay. And and mark came up to me and said, Hey, what camera are you bringing? I said, well, well you know, I've got my Sony, what do you have? He said, I have the new Nikon Z seven. And he took some amazing pictures. Gorgeous, gorgeous pictures. Well,\n\nChris Marquardt (01:29:26):\n\nIt is so, so I, I, I picked that because I'm just, I love the ice.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:29:32):\n\nI've you're\n\nChris Marquardt (01:29:32):\n\nA nice guy. I've been in places like that, straight in at the edge of a glacier ownership. So that is just something very special. And what mark did here is, and he, he, we did a few things here. First of all, he, the picture's nicely structured. So we have this strip of background on the top and then we have the, the glacier itself in the middle and then a strip of water on the bottom. And then there is just to give you a better idea of the size of things. He has put a boat there, or the boat has been there, but he he composed it. So the boat is there. Sit, the boat sits nicely at the right bottom. Very well spaced feels like a very deliberate composition. And and that that's gives the whole thing perspective. You know, you, you, the, the size of that glacier snaps into focus, so to speak, it is a very good photo.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:30:27):\n\nYou wanna see the same boat, same glacier from my camera. <Laugh> go\n\nChris Marquardt (01:30:32):\n\nAhead. Go\n\nLeo Laporte (01:30:33):\n\n<Laugh>\n\nChris Marquardt (01:30:34):\n\nThere we go. Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:30:35):\n\nThere we go. Yeah, it was that's the Marjorie glacier in glacier bay and that boat very timely appearance on that boat because it did\n\nChris Marquardt (01:30:44):\n\nHelp and you shot that with a wider angle. You shot that with\n\nLeo Laporte (01:30:46):\n\nA wider yeah. I wanted to get more because folk length. Yeah. Cuz the cloud, you\n\nChris Marquardt (01:30:50):\n\nAdded a lot more context,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:30:51):\n\nRight? Yeah. I wanted to see the mouse choice. Different choice. Yeah. But that's the beauty of it. Right. You know, everybody, and I think I have some that are exactly like his, to be honest with you. <Laugh> I took a lot of pictures of that glacier because I was stuck in the room and staring at it for a couple hours. But it\n\nChris Marquardt (01:31:09):\n\nWas so you shut out of the window.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:31:11):\n\nNo, no. I was on the deck. I was on the deck. Oh, you went out there? Yeah. We had a little balcony. So I went out on the balcony to get it. And when this boat showed up, I was extremely happy because I knew that you couldn't really get a sense of how big that glacier is unless you had a little tiny boat in front of it. So that's pretty cool. Yeah. Very nice. Mark. You should see. And mark send Chris some of his other pictures. He got pictures of bear eating salmon. He got pictures of I mean gorgeous shots. Oh, I could show you a couple with that a new Nikon mirrorless, which is, I think quite a nice, quite a nice camera.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:31:51):\n\nIt's a, it's a, it's a, it's an amazing\n\nLeo Laporte (01:31:54):\n\nCamera. They did.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:31:55):\n\nAnd\n\nLeo Laporte (01:31:56):\n\nA great job. So time to go to the fish bowl and pick a new adjective.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:32:01):\n\nYes. Fishbowl and will pick another word. And the new word is oh, friendly.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:32:10):\n\nOh, I like it. Friendly, friendly. I like\n\nChris Marquardt (01:32:14):\n\nIt\n\nLeo Laporte (01:32:14):\n\nToo friendly. Now, mark, you don't get to use any of those old pictures. You gotta start all over again and take new pictures. True. Illustrating the word or I'm so glad mark submitted that though. That's great. Illustrating the word concept, the idea friendly, whatever that means to you. We're not gonna tell you and the way this works, you go to flicker.com, which is a wonderful photo sharing site, tag it, TG friendly. So we know this is for the the Tech Guy show and Renee, and then submit it to the Tech Guy group Renee Silverman. Our moderator will say, oh, thank you. Very nice, very eyes. And she'll she'll she'll post post it and then about a month, we'll go through 'em and you wanna see another one of Mark's pictures by the way? I'll just, there's so many amazing pictures he\n\nChris Marquardt (01:33:02):\n\nGot, oh, look at that.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:33:03):\n\nThese are two bears fighting over, probably over a salmon. So he did a beautiful, yeah, he did some really amazing shots. I think he had a long lens with that.\n\nChris Marquardt (01:33:15):\n\nYou'll need like a, for that. You\n\nLeo Laporte (01:33:17):\n\nDon't wanna be up close to\n\nChris Marquardt (01:33:18):\n\nA, but six to 800 millimeters. You don't wanna be, be\n\nLeo Laporte (01:33:22):\n\nNext to a, a bear\n\nChris Marquardt (01:33:23):\n\nOr it's nice and cuddly as they look, they are dangerous\n\nLeo Laporte (01:33:26):\n\nOr a bald Eagle either.
