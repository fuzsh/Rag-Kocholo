        "text": "Master podcaster Leo Laporte’s TWiT is probably one of my favorite weekly content breaks across all platforms (broadcast, newspapers, Internet, etc.), so last week’s report regarding Revision3’s numbers versus TWiT’s hurt to post, but it had to be done.\n\nSince then, Laporte took the time to respond, so it seems only fair to allow him to give his side of the story (with my own comments in brackets, of course). Laporte commented:\n\n“Do you really think Compete has a clue as to either my numbers or Revision3's? [Answer: Yes] Do you know ANYONE who uses the Compete toolbar? [Answer: Yes]* They have even less credibility than Alexa numbers. Furthermore, that's a \"measurement\" of the twit.tv page vs. revision3.com. What do either have to do with podcast listenership? [Answer: Our report compared popularity, not listenership. Traffic is a significant indicator of popularity.] __According the very conservative Podtrac.com numbers (which count only unique US IP addresses) we're doing well over 2 million downloads a month. __Our bandwidth providers deliver more than two terabytes per day of content. I don't know if that beats Revision3, but I'm very happy with those numbers.”*\n\nAs far as I know, new Revision3 CEO Jim Louderback is still on vacation, so we may have to wait for similar download disclosure from Revision3. As for Laporte, his traffic might not be on par with Revision3’s, but the quality and consistency of his shows are certainly better, so he has every reason to believe that a well funded suitor will probably come knocking sooner rather than later. At that point, I imagine he’ll have to rethink that “not for sale” declaration.\n\nPhoto: decjr\n\nThe Architect of Russia’s Google Is Back\n\nYandex cofounder Arkady Volozh fought off sanctions and kicked anti-war squatters out of his Amsterdam townhouse.
