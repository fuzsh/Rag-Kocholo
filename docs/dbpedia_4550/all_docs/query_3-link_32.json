        "text": "Building a Roku channel with your content can be done in a few simple steps with Direct Publisher. Generally, this entails following a wizard-like UI to provide basic channel information and marketing assets, enable ads (if you are monetizing content), and enter the URL where your content feed is hosted.\n\nHosting your content and creating the feed comprise the majority of the work for creating a Roku channel via Direct Publisher, although both steps are relatively simple. Original/licensed content may be hosted either on your website, a content delivery network (CDN), or an online video platform (OVP) (videos from video-sharing platforms cannot be embedded in the Roku Media Player).\n\nWith your content hosted on the web, you can create the feed following the Direct Publisher Feed (JSON) specification or use your existing MRSS feed. The feed contains all the metadata needed to play your content on Roku devices, including basic information for each video such as the unique ID, title, short and long descriptions; the URL where the video is hosted; and the supported format (for example MOV, MP4, and so on).\n\nOnce your content is hosted on the web and your feed has been created, you can create your Roku channel in minutes with Direct Publisher."
