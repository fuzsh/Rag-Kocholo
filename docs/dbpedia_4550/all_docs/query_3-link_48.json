And Windows Insider has had a relatively quiet week. Intel is in trouble, with stock price dropping over 25 percent! WordStar is back, but the big news here is the documentation archive. Also, Paul thinks the improved Reader mode in Firefox 129 is pretty sweet. Windows 11 Last week, Microsoft issued Week D update for 22H2/23H2 late Last week, Microsoft issued 24H2 build to the Release Preview channel but nothing for Week D. Paul speculated this would replace the Weed D update, head to stable in August Since then, Microsoft quietly issued Week D update for 24H2 one week late (on last day of July) Speculation was correct: These are all the same thing, with the same new features, most CFRs Microsoft's release schedule gets even more chaotic. It's been missing the Week D Tuesday release schedule more often than not in recent months BIG update to the Microsoft Store in Canary and Dev today Hardware Snapdragon X is a huge leap forward for the PC, but Apple/MacBook Air still have big advantages AMD's new chips are getting rave reviews Intel is on track for Lunar Lake in September Intel earnings crater, with layoffs, cost reductions Stock price drop second worst in corporate history Intel extends Core processor Gen 13/14 warranty by 2 years (PC bundles only) Core processor warranty is extended to retail sales Surface Laptop 7, Surface Pro 11 for Business available for preorder Microsoft 365 The new Outlook is now generally available and the Microsoft community celebrates in the streets Antitrust/Corporate Google found guilty of abusing its Search monopoly Big point: Google's revenue share deals with Apple, etc. Could this kill Mozilla?

In fact, they question the future of settling humans off Earth in its entirety. Certainly, it will be challenging, but is it impossible? Are there reasons we should not go? We gathered together two of our favorite experts on the topic, Dale Skran, the COO and SVP of the National Space Society, and Mr. YouTube himself, Isaac Arthur—who has produced maybe 100 hours or more of well-regarded videos on the subject—to discuss the book and our prospects for rational, realistic space settlement plans. Join us! \"A City on Mars\" takes a skeptical and humorous look at space settlement, questioning our readiness for having children in space, building space farms, and creating independent space nations. Dale Skran wrote a comprehensive 40,000-word review of the book, acknowledging its depth while disagreeing with many of its conclusions. He believes the book represents the current stage of opposition to the increasingly realistic prospect of space settlement. The hosts discuss the potential benefits and resources available in space, with Dale and Isaac emphasizing the vast opportunities and the need for reasonable regulation to facilitate space development. The challenges of human reproduction in space are examined, with the hosts agreeing on the importance of further research and the need for artificial gravity experiments on space stations. The potential for conflict and war in space is explored, with Dale arguing that space settlements will likely be more resilient and less vulnerable than Earth-based cities due to their designed defenses against natural and artificial threats. The hosts critique the book's pessimistic view of space settlement and its suggestion to wait centuries until humanity has solved all its problems before venturing into space. They argue that space development and solving Earth's issues can and should happen concurrently. Dale Skran highlights an interesting idea from the book: the possibility of a dual life cycle for settlers, with reproduction occurring in 1G spin gravity settlements while adults spend much of their time working in low-gravity environments like the Moon or Mars.

Microsoft announces its quarterly (and annual) financial results. They're doing OK. The company also expands on what it has done and will do, with Windows security in the wake of the CrowdStrike outage.

Earnings Microsoft announces its quarterly (and annual) financial results. They're doing OK. Microsoft's FY24: a net income of $88.1 billion on revenues of $245.1 billion, up 22 percent and 16 percent Windows - Barely mentioned, another solid $10 billion+ in revenues, no gain from Copilot+ PC Office - Solid growth, mostly commercial Surface - Flush twice, it's a long way to New Mexico Xbox - Problematic, propped up mostly by Activision, but there are huge costs there too AI - Huge investments, Microsoft can afford it. $19 billion (!) in infrastructure costs in this quarter, and it's going up next year ... when/how does AI pay off? Microsoft to give employees a one-time cash award on top of bonuses TikTok was paying Microsoft $20 million per month through at least March for OpenAI on Azure, close to 25 percent of Microsoft's total revenues for that business AMD revenues - the next NVIDIA? Windows Windows 11 versions 22H2/23H2 get theirs a few days late, features we saw in Release Preview a few weeks ago Nothing for 24H2, but a new Release Preview build is almost certainly its equivalent, meaning we'll see these features in stable in August All channels: Support for Android file system navigation in File Explorer Beta channel (last week): Widgets is about to get third party feeds It's not a dud, but the HP EliteBook Ultra doesn't measure up Qualcomm and AMD have spoken, now Intel is delivering Lunar Lake on September 3 Microsoft 365 and AI No more ads in Skype!

Naturally, everyone blamed Microsoft at first Microsoft says outage impacted under 1 percent of PCs. It was just the worst PCs imaginable Microsoft blames EU regulation for its inability to be like Apple That is not a good look. It's also deceptive. Microsoft issues repair tool (later updates). CrowdStrike explains what it did wrong. TLDR: everything. Windows Windows 11 version 23H2 is fully available! Wait, what? Surface Laptop 7 review: big, heavy, no presence sensing or fingerprint reader. Right, I love it. Also, the ThinkPad T14s arrived. Related: Intel cops to mistake in Core Gen 13/14 processors, will issue fix. Why this is unprecedented. And also precedented. Also, why precedented is a word. Microsoft is FINALLY bringing ads to the Microsoft Store search box. Microsoft starts testing new Start menu layouts. Surely one of them has live tites.

Xbox FTC complains about Xbox Game changes. They're not wrong. But they're not right either. Call of Duty Modern Warfare III lands on Game Pass today - what the what Also, Microsoft muffed the landing badly - but it appears to be working now Halo TV series canceled. It's the worst thing that's happened with Xbox this entire year Tips and Picks Tip of the week: The best thing about Copilot in Windows 11 now With Copilot switching from a pane to an app, thereʼs an unintended benefit that comes into play when you use an AI PC with a Copilot key on it. Youʼre never going to believe what happens next. App pick of the week: Microsoft Designer for image generation Microsoft Designer exited preview last week and thereʼs at least one secret benefit to using it: Unlike Copilot, you can create wide and portrait images (and not just square) without paying.
