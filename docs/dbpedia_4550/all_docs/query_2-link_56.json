We’ve compiled a list of our top 30 must-follow Twitter accounts for breaking news and updates from across the globe. Read on to see some of the best Twitter accounts to follow for news, as we rank the most followed news accounts on Twitter.\n\nStatistics accurate as of January 2022.\n\nThe wide range of Twitter news accounts mean that the Twittersphere is an excellent place to stay in the know when it comes to global affairs. And it’s not just legitimate world news Twitter accounts, news agencies or journalists that are the first to break the news. Aside from the hundreds of news accounts on Twitter that we track, Intelligence Fusion’s analysts are often alerted to a developing incident in its early stages by regular Twitter users who may be a witness to the situation.\n\nBut just because it’s on social media, doesn’t always mean it’s true. Fake news is a growing phenomenon and is becoming more and more difficult to identify. Luckily, our team are trained to use various tools and techniques to help verify information from open sources, including various intelligence processes to validate media and reports as well as a standard military method of grading sources by credibility and reliability.\n\nThis ensures that all of our data is as accurate as possible and clients can act on the information we send without having to waste their own time and resource fact-checking every alert.\n\nIf you’d like to see more from Intelligence Fusion, you can follow us on Twitter too. We have dedicated handles for each region or you can get the whole picture from our main account;\n\nGLOBAL INTELLIGENCE\n\n@IntellFusion\n\nNORTH AMERICA\n\n@IFNorthAmerica\n\nSOUTH AMERICA\n\n@IFSouthAmerica\n\nAFRICA\n\n@IF_Africa\n\nASIA & MIDDLE EAST\n\n@IF_Asia_\n\nEUROPE\n\n@IF_Europe\n\nI"
