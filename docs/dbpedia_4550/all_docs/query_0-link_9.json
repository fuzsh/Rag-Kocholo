It all started in 2005 when Leo Laporte and several former TechTV colleagues gathered for a reunion at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco and recorded their conversation. Leo posted the recording on his website, which led to overwhelming fan requests for more. Three months later, in April 2005, Leo and the crew launched the show as a weekly podcast. The podcast was briefly known as Revenge of the Screen Savers, a nod to the TechTV show, The Screen Savers. Former TechTV hosts Patrick Norton, Kevin Rose, and John C. Dvorak, and producers Robert Heron, David Prager, and Roger Chang were frequent guests who helped get the show rolling. With This Week in Tech's rising popularity as an anchor, the TWiT.tv network has since expanded to include a range of original weekly tech podcasts, each with a unique focus. Each podcast also has video versions.\n\nOther Tech Podcasts You're Sure to Love\n\nIf you're a tech enthusiast who wants to be informed while being entertained, This Week in Tech is the perfect podcast for you.
