        "text": "Writing Your Academic Statement of Purpose\n\nWhat is it?\n\nEach applicant must submit an academic statement of purpose (ASOP). The ASOP is one of your primary opportunities to help the admissions committee understand your academic objectives and determine if you are a good match for the program you are applying to. The goal of this document is to impress upon the admissions committee that you have a solid background and experience in your area of interest and that you have the potential to be successful in graduate study.\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nThe ASOP is one of the most important pieces of your graduate school application because it:\n\nGives the reviewers an understanding of your academic background and interests.\n\nAllows you to illustrate in your own words what sets you apart from other applicants.\n\nHelps them determine if you are a good match for the program to which you are applying.\n\nShows your communication style and ability.\n\nInformation to Include\n\nIntroduce yourself and your academic interests\n\nProvide simple background information on your area of interest and how it became of particular interest to you.\n\nHere you can also share with them how and why you decided to pursue a graduate degree in this field.\n\nDescribe your academic background, preparation, and training\n\nSkills you have learned from academic, lab, or research experiences (e.g., undergraduate coursework, research opportunities, scholarly writings, jobs in the field, presentations, etc.). Whenever possible, give specific examples and illustrate the points you are making, don’t just simply tell them.\n\nResearch you conducted – project title or focus, research mentor, your specific role, what you learned and the outcome. If there were challenges, don’t be afraid to mention what you learned from them. This shows persistence and resilience in the face of adversity– these are also things they are looking for!\n\nImportant papers or thesis project you completed, as well as anything scholarly beyond your academic degree requirements.\n\nRelevant work or internship experience as related to the field you are applying to.\n\nShow them you are making an informed decision\n\nIndicate what you would like to study in graduate school in enough detail to convince the faculty that you understand the scope of research in the discipline and are aware of research trends.\n\nShow them that you have thoroughly researched the program, its faculty, and research focus areas, and why you are applying to this program specifically. This will help you write a more informed essay that is relatable to the faculty who will be reviewing your application.\n\nDescribe why you are a good fit for the program and why the program is a good fit for you.\n\nIf there are specific faculty you are interested in working with, check the program’s ASOP instructions and determine how best to mention this in your essay. Some programs require you to name a professor(s) with whom you would like to work.\n\nAre there any aspects of the program that are of particular interest to you (immersion program, opportunities for collaboration with others outside of the institution, research centers associated with the program, etc.)?\n\nInclude information that is important to you outside of the program – supportive environment for first-year students, access to amazing literary resources, opportunities to participate in professional/career development programming, etc.\n\nProfessional goals – you may wish to outline what you plan to do after you complete the program as a way of underscoring the importance of your choice to pursue graduate study.\n\nShare any extracurricular opportunities you have had that show leadership, ability to work with a diverse group of people, teaching skills, etc.\n\nResearch degree applicants should identify specific faculty members whose research interests align with your own interests.\n\nImportant Things to Remember\n\nDetails\n\nPay attention and follow instructions very carefully – every program is different and some have specific items/topics they want you to address.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, this is an academically focused essay, not necessarily a personal essay. You will likely add some personal details here and there, but be sure to keep the focus on your academic background and future potential.\n\nProofread and pay close attention to details – they really matter!\n\nHave others from a variety of perspectives read your essay before you submit it – they should be looking at it in terms of content, style, and grammar. Remember, those outside of your field can provide you with valuable perspective and feedback.\n\nKeep in mind that you can continue editing your ASOP after you have submitted it to programs with earlier deadlines.\n\nLength, Format and Tone\n\nUnless otherwise noted one to two pages in a standard font and size is typical.\n\nInclude your full name and proposed program of study at the top of each page – if faculty are not reading an electronic version of your essay, pages can become separated.\n\nWrite with confidence and in an active voice – doing this makes your sentences clear and less wordy/complicated.\n\nLanguage should be positive and focused. Since faculty are the ones reviewing your application, it is fine to use discipline-specific terminology, tone, and style in your ASOP.\n\nFinal Checklist\n\nHave you…\n\nDescribed your academic background in enough detail to show your experience and preparedness in the field?\n\nShown that you are a good fit for the program you are applying to?\n\nDefined why you want a graduate degree in this field?\n\nDemonstrated that you are self-motivated, persistent, competent, and have the skills necessary to be successful in graduate school?\n\nFollowed the ASOP instructions as defined by the program you are applying to?\n\nPolished, proofread, and had others review your ASOP?"
