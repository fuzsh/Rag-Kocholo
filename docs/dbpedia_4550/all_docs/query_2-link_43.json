That search term is used by more people than all the other keyword variations combined.\n\nYou might consider using the remaining keyphrases in your article as secondary keywords, however. Although you should generally use your focus keyword the most, using related words also helps your content rank higher in search engines.\n\nThe Importance of Focus Keywords for SEO\n\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO) is incredibly important to your website because it’s one of the best ways to acquire traffic. If you rank in Google search for your focus keywords, you’ll get organic traffic to your website when searchers click your links.\n\nIf you want to rank a post or page for a certain keyphrase, you want your on-page SEO to be dialed in and very focused on that one topic.

A keyphrase is simply a group of keywords that is similar to a query someone might type when searching Google.\n\nIf you have additional keyphrases that are related, add them in the next section, as well.\n\nFor instance, if our focus keyphrase is “time management at work,” we could use “how to manage time at work” as an additional keyphrase.\n\nOpen your WordPress page editor and scroll down below the article text to the AIOSEO area. Go ahead and type in your Focus Keyphrase, and input any extra keyphrases in the Additional Keyphrases field.\n\nStep 4: Make Suggested SEO Updates\n\nNow, AIOSEO will make suggestions based on your focus keywords for how to improve your content and your optimization.

That’s how you use focus keywords to analyze and optimize your content.\n\nHow to Track Focus Keyphrases in Google Analytics\n\nNow that you know how to find and use focus keywords and keyphrases in your content, you can go a step further by tracking keyword performance in Google Analytics.\n\nTo get AIOSEO focus keyphrase data into Google Analytics, you can use the MonsterInsights plugin.\n\nMonsterInsights is the best Google Analytics plugin for WordPress.

How do I choose the right focus keyword?\n\nTo choose the right focus keyword for your content, focus on three main factors: popularity (how many people search for it), rankability (how difficult it is to rank for it), and relevance (how closely it matches the content of your page). Use keyword research tools to analyze these factors and find a keyword that balances high search volume with manageable competition.\n\n2. Can I use more than one focus keyword per page?\n\nWhile it’s technically possible to use multiple focus keywords, it’s generally recommended to focus on one primary keyword per page. This helps ensure that your content is specifically optimized for that keyword, improving your chances of ranking higher. If you have additional relevant keywords, they’ll naturally appear in your content and act as supporting keywords.\n\n3. Where should I include my focus keyword in the content?\n\nYour focus keyword should be included in key parts of your page, such as the title tag, headings, the first paragraph of the text, and the meta description. It’s also beneficial to use it in the URL and anchor texts of internal links. However, avoid keyword stuffing, which can harm your content’s credibility and rankings.\n\n4. How do I optimize my content for a focus keyword without keyword stuffing?\n\nTo optimize without keyword stuffing, ensure that the focus keyword is used naturally and contextually within the content. In other words, write for humans, not Google’s crawlers! Aim for a balance where the keyword is present but doesn’t dominate the text unnaturally.\n\n5. How often should I update my focus keywords?\n\nRegularly updating your focus keywords is essential to keep up with changes in search trends and user behavior. Re-evaluate your keywords periodically using tools like Google Search Console and keyword research platforms to ensure your content remains relevant and competitive in search results.\n\nThat’s it!\n\nWe hope you loved our guide to using focus keywords to improve your site’s overall SEO.\n\nIf you’re trying to boost your site’s organic search results, you might also want to learn how to configure Google Search Console with WordPress."
