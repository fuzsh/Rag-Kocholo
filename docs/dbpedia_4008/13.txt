Carlisle Cathedral has stood at the heart of the city for over 900 years. Sitting close to the border with Scotland, this magnificent Cathedral has stood the test of time with architecture including wonky Norman arches (thanks to subsidence), the medieval East window over 50ft high, a truncated nave (thanks to the English Civil Wars) and our famous starlight ceiling designed by Owen Jones.

A permanent exhibition showcases treasures from around the North-West, and our library holds an important collection of rare sixteenth- and seventeenth-century books. Set within the peaceful green precinct, the Cathedral provides space amidst the bustle of city life.

There are free guided tours thanks to our volunteers, and special trails for younger visitors. Many exhibitions, concerts and talks take place in both the Cathedral and medieval Fratry. We have a superb, award-winning caf√© and our gift shop is packed with local produce and crafts.

We are open and welcome visitors every day of the year, and it is free to visit. All are welcome.
