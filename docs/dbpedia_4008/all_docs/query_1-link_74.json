Meriton was a lawyer and a prodigious writer on a wide range of well-received legal and non-legal topics. Born in the North Riding of Yorkshire, he is also remembered for his dialect poem The Praise of Yorkshire Ale (1683). First published in 1669, the Guide for Constables reviews the legal obligation, rights and limitations of lay officers other than justices of the peace. A durable work, it reached its eighth and final edition in 1685. All editions are scarce despite its popularity and long publication history. OCLC locates 3 copies of the fourth edition, all in North America (Harvard Law School, Yale, Huntington Library). The ESTC adds 3 more (British Library, Carlisle Cathedral, Thomas Plume's Library). English Short-Title Catalogue (ESTC) R19540.\n\nPrice: $650.00\n\nBook number 74152"
