The present cathedral has fine examples of stone tracery, mediæval stained glass, paintings and carvings. The building is made of red sandstone, which due to local weather at some places appears black.\n\nFive of the seven bays of the cathedral were destroyed by the Scottish Presbyterian Army during the English Civil War to provide stone for the reinforcement of Carlisle Castle. Carlisle cathedral was restored in the 19th century by Ewan Christian. Due to extremes in wet and dry conditions at Carlisle, the ground on which the Cathedral is built is constantly moving. This is visible upon inspection of the pillars, which lean in all directions.\n\nRobert William Billings published an analysis of Carlisle Cathedral which has been the subject of scholarly interpretation, particularly citing his geometric theory of analyis.

The choral tradition, unique to Britain, continues to this day.\n\nThe Cathedral Choir now consists of 16 choristers and 6 lay clerks. The choristers were originally educated at the Cathedral's own choir school but this was closed in 1935 and nowadays the boys attend the Cathedral on five days a week, after school hours, and sing at six services a week thus ensuring the continuity of the long tradition of daily choral worship.\n\nThe boys are aged from 8-13 years and are recruited from local schools. They are selected at voice trials held during the year and receive a thorough musical training. They are awarded an annual bursary and pocket money.\n\nCarlisle Cathedral Youth Choir\n\nThe Cathedral also has a Youth Choir for boys and girls aged 11-18 years who sing services in the Cathedral once a week during term time.\n\nCarlisle Cathedral Voluntary Choir\n\nThe Voluntary Choir, consisting of mixed voices, was formed to sing occasional services in the absence of the Cathedral and Youth Choirs.\n\nCarlisle Cathedral Music Appeal\n\nIn 1999 the Carlisle Cathedral Music Appeal was launched with a target of £750,000 to establish a choral foundation to enable annual bursaries and free instrumental lessons to be provided for the choristers, and scholarships and vocal tuition for the choral scholars.\n\nReferences\n\nee also\n\n* Architecture of the medieval cathedrals of England\n\n* English Gothic architecture\n\n* Romanesque architecture\n\n* Church of England\n\nExternal links"
