        "text": "This paper considers how the union of sun, landscape, and architecture contributed to the siting of Welsh Cistercian abbeys. From August 2014 to March 2016 the authors surveyed and measured the orientation of all Cistercian churches with extant foundations in Wales, as well as the elevations of their surrounding landscapes. Using methodologies drawn from cultural astronomy, analysis of this data revealed that through the intentional orientating of the abbey within the local topography, each church formed a relationship to the sun&#39;s light on theologically significant days. Other notable observations include the emphasis on sunsets and the west, the focus on the astronomical equinox rather than the Julian calendar equinox, and the solar position on Michaelmas and/or Saint David&#39;s Day. The implications of these results for wider debates in the field of Cistercian studies are then discussed.\n\nThis paper considers how the union of sun, landscape, and architecture contributed to the siting of Welsh Cistercian abbeys. From August 2014 to March 2016 the authors surveyed and measured the orientation of all Cistercian churches with extant foundations in Wales, as well as the elevations of their surrounding landscapes. Using methodologies drawn from cultural astronomy, analysis of this data revealed that through the intentional orientating of the abbey within the local topography, each church formed a relationship to the sun’s light on theologically significant days. Other notable observations include the emphasis on sunsets and the west, the focus on the astronomical equinox rather than the Julian calendar equinox, and the solar position on Michaelmas and/or Saint David’s Day. The implications of these results for wider debates in the field of Cistercian studies are then discussed.\n\nMA Dissertation - Professor David Austin has noted that Strata Florida Abbey and its environs represent a ‘transcendently numinous place, perhaps from a time before the Cistercians arrived’. In this paper, the author sets out to investigate the evidence for a continued reverence of ‘sacredness’ or numinosity in the landscape surrounding the abbey precinct, from the time of the earliest surviving prehistoric monuments, constructed at around 2000BC, to the building of the Cistercian Abbey. Archaeoastronomy is used as a way of gauging the beliefs of earlier peoples in this respect, taking as a given that, for them, celestial events and heavenly bodies had a spiritual meaning, and that this in turn lead to astronomical alignments or certain directions being incorporated into the structures they created. The results of the project (although somewhat limited by time and space constraints, and the necessity of ploughing a fresh furrow) show that if indeed the placing of structures with regard to certain celestial events does indicate a spiritual /ritual dimension to those structures, then the landscape and skyscape of this valley and its environs have indeed been a ‘transcendently numinous place’ since well before the coming of the Cistercians.\n\nGPS surveys of 181 medieval churches situated in northern-central Italy and in the Alps demonstrate major axis alignments to the horizon positions of the rising and setting Sun or Moon. The geographic scope includes the Veneto region and the old Via Francigena pilgrim route, the 1,200 km tract from the Swiss Alps to southern Tuscany, passing through the cantons of Vaud and Valais and regions including the Aosta Valley, Piemont, Lombardy, Emilia Romagna and Tuscany. Construction dates range up to the Romanesque Age. In most cases, the church's major axis coincides with the sunrise or sunset position on the Patron Saint's day to whom the church was dedicated or on one of the four Virgin Mary's medieval feast days, i.e: the Annunciation (25 March); Purification (2 February); Assumption (18 January, 15 August) and Nativity (8 September). Church alignments (major axis and windows) are derived from GPS ground surveys and were cross-referenced with medieval liturgical and astronomical sources as well as scholarly literature. KEYWORDS: medieval churches, orientation, objective and written evidence, GPS survey, Italy and Alps: Veneto region and Via Francigena, Patron Saint's day, sunrise or sunset.\n\nThe focus of this work is to define the methodology of planning and of construction of the Templar churches built in Piedmont, in the North West of Italy, in order to define the criteria of the astronomical orientations and of the geometry used by the \" masters of work \" of the Templar order in the drafting of the project.The Poor Knights of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon (Pauperes commilitones Christi templique Salomonis), a religious military order of knighthood, was founded in 1119 A.D.to protect Christian pilgrims travelling towards to the Holy Land and subsequently the order assumed greater military duties during the 12th century. During the Council of Vienne in 1312, Pope Clement V issued a series of papal bulls, including \" Vox in excelso \" , which officially suppressed the Order, and \" Ad providam \" , which turned over the most Templar assets to the Hospitallers.One of the most important road travelled by the pilgrims coming from the Northern Europe to Rome,was the \" Via Francigena or Romea \" , that connected the main places of spirituality of the time, and that consisted of a bundle of routes. A branch descended from the Great St. Bernard, passed through Aosta, Ivrea, Santhia, Vercelli and continued to Pavia and the centers of central Italy, to reach Rome. The \" Via Liburnasca \" was a connection that linked Turin, and hence the \" Passi \" of the Val Susa (Moncenisio and Monginevro) with Vercelli, a town crossed by the most well-known branch of the Via Francigena.In this work we present the results of our statistical analysis of the architectural alignments of a group of Templar churches located in Piedmont, someone lying along the \" Via Liburnasca \" , measured \" in situ \" by the authors in the spring and summer 2015. Subsequently an appropriate statistical study was carried out in order to infer their distribution function with the aim to perform an appropriate archaeoastronomical analysis.Several statistical methods have been employed. Basic tests have been performed with automatic data classification, in order to find natural clusters. The K-means and the Circular K-means (CK-means),have been tested .We have used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to analyze the orientation data distributions.The architectural alignments that we measured in two Templar churches, applying a rigorous methodology, reveal that the use of astronomical references at the horizon represents the most viable rationale and outlines the existence of orientation patterns that the Templar Knights used for planning their churches, which is connectable with the \" Equinoctial Cycle\" religious calendar , and the \"Solstice Cycle \" religious calendar. At present the research is still in progress."
