        "text": "Introduction\n\nBefore any new vehicle – whether a car, race car, tank, ship, or motorcycle, driven by gas, diesel, EV/HEV, or alternative fuels - can be launched to the market, it has to be thoroughly tested. Proving grounds or test tracks serve the automotive industry for on-road and off-road vehicle testing.\n\nIn the development process, the performance of a vehicle is put to test in a variety of environments and driving situations. Usually, test cases focus on the dynamic properties of vehicles. Safety is a priority and vehicles are often tested under extreme conditions and speeds.\n\nUntil the 1920s, automotive testing was done on city streets and country roads. Proving grounds move vehicle testing from public roads to controlled, secure, and safe testing environments while simulating a wide range of road types and events, all reflecting or relating to the customer's usage of the vehicle.\n\nWorld map of automotive proving grounds\n\nList of proving grounds by country\n\nWhat is a proving ground?\n\nProving ground is an area where the performance of a vehicle is put to the test. Proving grounds are generally spread over large areas and roads (usually several kilometers) and facilities to assess the working of various systems and parts of the vehicle.\n\nMostly, proving grounds are situated far from populated areas. They maintain the maximum possible diversity in drive conditions.\n\nBig automobile OEMs in the auto industry such as General Motors, FCA, Daimler, and several others usually have their in-house proving grounds and test centers to test their own vehicles. But there are several privately owned proving grounds where everyone can reserve their seat for testing.\n\nTypes of proving grounds\n\nThere are several different types of proving grounds, depending on the type of vehicle being tested. We can classify proving grounds as:\n\nAeronautical Applications\n\nMilitary Applications\n\nAutomobile Testing (vehicle testing)\n\nMarine Performance Testing\n\nAerospace Applications (For test-firing missiles and drones)\n\nThis article will focus on Automobile Testing and Proving Grounds.\n\nVehicle development and testing\n\nProving grounds enable and support the engineering tasks of validation or verification, inspection, and certification or homologation, and are an efficient means of qualifying the durability of vehicles and their components.\n\nThese test facilities are used to expose industry prototypes to the conditions that the final product will experience either in extremes or during its whole lifetime. They achieve this by accelerating damage accumulation rates, so failures are detectable in a short period of time.\n\nProving grounds are used by manufacturers of the automotive and automotive supplier industry, companies of technical monitoring, providers of engineering services, institutes and universities, as well as providers of driver safety training. Most automakers own and manage one or more proving grounds, but such services are also supplied by independent companies.\n\nProving grounds often encompass large and remote areas. They have a range of tracks and facilities to assess the functions of various systems of the automobile in the maximum possible diversity in drive conditions, including testing and development in:\n\nDurability testing\n\nCorrosion testing\n\nFunctional performance\n\nBrake testing\n\nRide and handling (Vehicle Dynamics)\n\nNVH - Noise, Vibration, and Harshness\n\nPowertrain testing\n\nADAS testing\n\nAll proving grounds uphold a high level of discretion and security due to protect the commercial interests of their customers. Generally, public access is not permitted and the facilities are hidden from outside view.\n\nAutonomous or driverless cars\n\nAll modern vehicles are now equipped with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The development of such systems requires complex testing, including the ability to control and calculate relative positions between multiple vehicles and objects in real-time.\n\nThe next step is an autonomous vehicle that can guide itself without any human conduction. Computers take over actual driving, known as driverless cars, driving robots, self-driving cars, ADAS targets, or autonomous vehicles (AV).\n\nTheir testing has to ensure that they can drive the roads and keep people inside them as well as that outside safe. The human driver is getting out of the control loop, and new algorithms, e.g. machine learning, are introduced.\n\nThe advent of such autonomous vehicles (AVs) or connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) requires new proving grounds specially dedicated to self-driving cars. Traditional test tracks are transformed and adopted for highly automated or autonomous vehicle tests.\n\nAD functions require much more intense testing and validation procedure than traditional vehicle functions. This demands a complete and consistent verification of the functional specifications. Simulations are becoming more and more relevant and proving grounds are used for verification of the simulation results.\n\nThese new testing and validation methods require redesigned and dedicated proving grounds - proving grounds that are similar enough to the real world to do a satisfactory form of testing. Vehicle dynamics testing in itself is no longer enough. Testing of vehicle environment perception capabilities and of vehicle interaction with other vehicles and the infrastructure is in demand, and communication technologies have to be tested as well.\n\nProving ground test tracks and facilities\n\nProving grounds for automobiles most often include:\n\nHigh-speed tracks are specially made for the performance testing of automobiles at high speeds.\n\nSlow lane tracks are designed to evaluate the performance of the vehicle during city driving and low-traction driving.\n\nOff-road tracks range from second-class roads to wild terrains.\n\nCustom tracks are specially made to impose special conditions for which a vehicle is designed.\n\nHowever, no proving ground or test track is designed the same way. The most general principle adopted is to design the track to suit specific company demands, fit local conditions, and to conform to national rules.\n\nHandling courses\n\nProviding a variety of different curve radii, curve slopes, climbing gradients, and downhill slopes for testing the vehicle’s handling in extremely curvy situations.\n\nVehicle behavior\n\nVehicle maneuverability\n\nTechnical settings under controlled no-traffic circumstances\n\nComfort roads or ride tracks\n\nComfort road tracks simulate public road surfaces with conditions that may vary from slightly indiscrete to very severe\n\nComfort and vibration evaluation\n\nDurability verification\n\nAssessment of vehicle suspension\n\nHigh-speed or highway tracks\n\nThese are often long (more than 10 km) and have smooth and banked turns and parabolic curves with an inclination of up to 50 degrees, and installations which can generate side wind. Testing is carried out at speeds of up to above 200 km/h (124 mph) depending on the car. While the vehicle is driving the tracks, these data can be obtained.\n\nBraking performance\n\nEngine performance\n\nCoast down data\n\nDynamic response\n\nDurability\n\nSlow tracks\n\nThese may have potholes, pits, speed breakers, water pits, ambient fog, etc., Cars traveling on these tracks travel at about 10-30kmph. Tests on slow tracks yield the following data:\n\nEndurance of body structure\n\nPerformance of suspension at low speeds\n\nVehicle performance in a corrosive environment.\n\nRough road\n\nRough road tracks are used to test suspension and electronics providing different road surfaces. Off-road often cross terrain ranging from mud to hill rocks.\n\nInternal noise\n\nComfort and vibration evaluation\n\nLow-speed handling\n\nEndurance of body structure\n\nSteep or uphill tracks\n\nTracks with different gradients – varying from 5% to up to 30% for the testing of traction control systems and for tests on downhill braking.\n\nDurability\n\nBraking performance\n\nOff-road tracks\n\nTracks are used to test off-road vehicles with all-wheel drive and differential locking.\n\nTraction\n\nHigh-grade performance\n\nSuspension performance\n\nSteering stability\n\nNoise tracks\n\nTest tracks are used for evaluating the external noise of vehicles. The shape, flatness, and sound absorption properties of the track affect how the sound propagates away from the vehicle. The ISO 10844 standard specifies the design of noise test tracks to minimize the variation of vehicle noise measurements made at different testing locations.\n\nPass-by noise testing\n\nBraking tracks\n\nTracks with various road surfaces and friction coefficients for simulating all conceivable road conditions – some are floodable. The coefficient of friction of the track varies with different road paving.\n\nABS and tires development and homologation\n\nRoad driving under low grip conditions\n\nWinter tracks\n\nIn some countries, e.g. Sweden and Norway, special tracks or proving grounds are made for testing vehicle prototypes, components, or tires in cold climate conditions.\n\nPerformance on snow and ice surfaces\n\nWhirling snow handling\n\nMost often proving grounds will also provide services such as engine dynamometers, low-temperature chambers, kinematics and compliance rigs, or climatic chambers.\n\nData acquisition and sensors\n\nVehicle data acquisition (DAQ) systems are used in the vehicle testing environment for measurements of vehicle performance, vehicle dynamics, vehicle durability, combustion, electric and hybrid engine testing, components testing, and more.\n\nSuch systems typically measure a wide range of parameters like temperature, pressure, velocity, voltage, current, power, loads and strains, consumption, and emissions, while monitoring the vehicle data bus such as Controller Area Network (CAN, CAN FD) channels.\n\nLearn more:\n\nWhat Is a Thermocouple Sensor and How Does It Work?In this article, you will learn what is a thermocouple, which are the basic types available, and how the temperature is measured with these sensors today.\n\nWhat Is a Strain Gauge Sensor and How Does It Work?Strain and pressure sensors are widely used in many static and dynamic measurements.
