        "text": "Getting Ready\n\nThe Cathedral Team are excited to see the return of the Rest Under The Stars installation! We can't wait to welcome you to this unique experience in Summer 2023.\n\nThank you!\n\nThank you to the Rest Under The Stars sponsors and supporters: Hayward Tod, the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Cumbria Community Foundation. This event wouldn't be possible without their generous support. Thank you also to Prism Arts for the fantastic soundscape and bespoke artwork.\n\nThe Launch Party\n\nWe had a great Launch Party on 25 July to officially start our Rest Under The Stars 2023 journey. Thank you to everyone who attended! Please share your photos with us by tagging us on social media.\n\nFamily Activities\n\nThe Launch Party was accompanied by family activities in the south aisle. Badge making and colouring in kept the children entertained! These activities will be available each day the installation is open, please have a go!\n\nYour Feedback\n\nWhen you visit Rest Under The Stars, please make sure you fill in one of our feedback postcards to let us know your thoughts on the experience. This greatly helps us with evaluating the event and our plans for the future. Just head to the blue table in the South Aisle, fill in your card, then pop it into our post box. Thank you.\n\nStorytime and PJ Party Under The Stars\n\nTo accompany the installation, we are hosting FREE family events - Storytime and PJ Parties Under The Stars - during the summer holidays. Thank you to everyone who has attended.\n\nA Grand Day Out\n\nWe were delighted to welcome a group from Age UK to Carlisle Cathedral in August. The group visited us as part of the Grand Day Out initiative with Stagecoach, encouraging bus pass holders to explore the county and combat loneliness and isolation, particularly following the pandemic. Photo Credit: Harry Atkinson\n\nGoing on Tour!\n\nThe deckchairs are packed and Canon Benjamin is ready to set off to take Rest Under The Stars on tour. First stop is St Lawrence's Church, Crosby Ravensworth. Please come and enjoy the installation from 22 September onwards.\n\nSt Lawrence's Church, Crosby Ravensworth\n\nThe installation looks wonderful at St Lawrence's Church. Have you been to visit yet? Gaze at the awnings, made by Prism Arts and inspired by Carlisle Cathedral. Listen to the soundscape in the bespoke chairs. The white awnings will be decorated as the tour progresses.\n\nSt Stephen's Church, Kirkby Stephen\n\nThe installation has now moved to its second location of the tour - Kirkby Stephen. Prism Arts are holding a music and arts workshop on Monday 6 November, 10am - 3pm, at The Methodist Hall. All welcome.\n\nSt Lawrence's Church, Appleby\n\nThe installation has now moved to its third and final location of the tour - Appleby. Prism Arts are holding a music and arts workshop in the church on Monday 4 December, 10am - 3pm. All welcome.\n\nThank you!\n\nThank you to everyone who has visited the Rest Under The Stars tour in 2023. The tour has now finished - watch this space for our 2024 plans. Thank you to all of our event partners for making this possible.\n\n2024 Tour\n\nRest Under The Stars will be going on tour once more, visiting communities in West Cumbria from April to July 2024, before returning to Carlisle Cathedral during August. First stop is St Andrew's Church, Thursby, where the installation will be in situ from 29 April - 15 May 2024. Please do visit.\n\n2024 funders\n\nThe 2024 Tour has received £9,402.54 from the UK Government through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund. The UK Shared Prosperity Fund is a central pillar of the UK government’s Levelling Up agenda and provides £2.6 billion of funding for local investment by March 2025. The Fund aims to improve pride in place and increase life chances across the UK investing in communities and place, supporting local business, and people and skills. More information can be found at www.ukspf.com. Support for Rest Under The Stars has also been gratefully received from Hayward Tod.\n\nSt Andrew's Church, Thursby\n\nThe installation is now set up at St Andrew's Church Thursby, and will be open to visitors until 15 May 2024. The Prism Arts residency day will take place on 7 May at St Mary's Church, Wigton. Everyone is welcome to attend this creative session.\n\nPrism Arts Residency Day at St Mary's Church, Wigton\n\nHere are the fantastic awnings created at the Prism Arts Residency Day on Tuesday 7 May at St Mary's Church, Wigton! Thank you to everyone who joined in.\n\nSt Mary's Church, Kirkby Lonsdale\n\nThe installation will be set up in St Mary's Church, Kirkby Lonsdale until 5 June 2024. A new awning has been made at each tour location and the overall display is looking amazing. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to these.\n\nSt Bees and Egremont\n\nThe installation has now travelled to Egremont and St Bees and will be there from 5 June - 26 June. Here are some fantastic photos from St James’ Church of England Infant and Nursery School, who experienced Rest Under The Stars recently.\n\nWorkington and Westfield\n\nThe Rest Under The Stars tour has moved on - and is now in situ at St Michael's Church, Workington from 26 June - 2 July. Look at these fabulous photos, the awnings look amazing draped across the space! After this, the installation will move to St John's Workington from 3-9 July and then to St Mary's Church, Westfield from 10-17 July.\n\nPrism Arts Workshop\n\nA special workshop with Prism Arts will take place on Tuesday 2 July, to explore what the area means to its community. Responses will be recorded visually through the creation of a new awning (like the ones shown here that have been created by our other tour communities) and audibly through the development of a new soundscape. All are welcome to attend from 11am - 3pm, at St Michael's Church, Falcon Place, Workington.\n\nReturning to Carlisle Cathedral\n\nOn 31 July, the Rest Under The Stars experience returned to Carlisle Cathedral, and was unveiled at a special launch party. The awnings created during the tour have been displayed in the South Aisle, and encourage visitors to enjoy their own journey down to the deckchairs, where you can rest whilst listening to the new soundscapes. Thank you to everyone involved. Rest Under The Stars will be on display until the beginning of September, with the soundscapes available Monday to Saturday, 10am - 4pm."
