        "text": "Nairobi, Kenya a.k.a ‚ÄúThe Construction Site‚Äù a.k.a \"The Only Way to Go is UP ‚¨ÜÔ∏èüÜôüîù‚Äù I am fascinated by the Purpose of Cities and Regions and their roles as ecosystems, categories of the economy, and drivers of growth. So, a week-long post-COVID workshop in Nairobi was always going to be an eye-opener. But nothing really prepares you for the sensory, mental, intellectual, and visual stimulation Nairobi offers. 12-15 years ago, I was blown away. Once again, I am back here for a workshop and again staggered at the rate of construction. Is there a city in Africa or anywhere else with so many new high-rise Luxury Apartment buildings going up all at the same time? With so many construction cranes and such volumes of concrete being poured? Who is buying? Who is funding? Or are these cash purchases? Yes, there are and have been other fast-growing cities in the world. But this - this is different from China, where in an established City or a new edge City, a handful of developers are the drivers. Or Egypt, where the Government largely orchestrated the New Administrative Capital (and dug itself into an insurmountable Debt trap as a result). Or Malaysia, where one Chinese developer built a whole new ‚ÄúForest City‚Äù targeted at mainland Chinese leisure investors, only for a returning Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed to rewrite the rules on foreign ownership after the project was built and ready for occupation - turning it into a ghost town. But this is different, this is interesting and very special. My sense is hundreds of different entrepreneurs and developers are driving the construction boom here. And the offering is distinctly vanilla and for clearly for one super sub segment, the ultra-rich. The billboards scream ‚Äì ‚ÄúNairobi‚Äôs first Resort residences‚Äù ‚ÄúOne-of-a-kind Luxury Apartments‚Äù ‚ÄúA new kind of living‚Äù. Unlike the artificial housing shortages in Europe and North America where people with wealth and housing seemingly don‚Äôt want to see new ones being built and use their incumbency and the local government planning and permitting process to frustrate growth - a scan of recent media headlines here tells me the local and National government are pro-new development, there is a bending of, or disregard for the Regulations and existing residents are up in arms. It will be interesting to come back here in a few years‚Äô time and see the changed skyline, and how this clash of interests, the concerns, social and environmental outcomes all play out, and, more importantly what it does for the economy and lender credit appetites. #Nairobi #ConstructionBoom #UrbanDevelopment #LuxuryLiving #EconomicGrowth #GrowthDialogue\n\n‚ÄúTravelling Black‚Äù Navigating the African continent as an African. Pan-Africanism and free trade are currently in vogue; but have not yet materialised as open borders. More than a decade ago, during an unforgettable evening while on assignment in Lusaka, I encountered the Nigerian head of a Pan-African bank‚Äôs Zambian division. I forget his name. Our conversation about continental travel revealed a startling truth: Nigerians face unparalleled difficulties getting around. My VISA dramas and tales of near-misses and mistreatment at airports and by airlines paled compared to his experiences. He dismissed them as bedtime stories for children, declaring, ‚ÄúYou know nothing.‚Äù He recommended I explore his blog, ‚ÄúTravelling Black,‚Äù for deeper insights. Sadly, I couldn't find it online when I looked for it. This week African media highlighted the travel woes of Aliko Dangote, Africa‚Äôs wealthiest man. To conduct business across the continent, he would require visas for 35 out of 54 African nations. Given his US$14 billion net worth, embassy visits for biometrics and passport submissions for visa applications are impractical, especially when his potential investments that will bring jobs are eagerly awaited by fellow Africans. Painfully, possessing a European or American passport simplifies travel across our continent significantly. Which leads to the point of this post. My previous business trip to Kenya required no visa. However, my upcoming journey to Nairobi introduces a new hurdle: the Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA). It‚Äôs not a visa per se, but rather a pre-clearance by the Kenyan government to board a flight in anticipation of granting a visa on arrival, provided entry criteria are met. The eTA‚Äôs introduction was met with skepticism. Procrastination led to my late application, accompanied by the usual trepidation of securing a flight without a confirmed visa. The official processing time is 72 hours, possibly longer, which had me bracing for exorbitant fees and the anxiety of an impending travel date without the necessary documentation. After submitting the required documents online, I discovered there was no charge. An email confirmation arrived at 8:29 pm, and after a brief break, I returned at 8:34 pm to find the eTA already in my inbox, formatted as a PDF and PASS, ready for mobile wallet download. It even included a personal greeting from President Ruto: ‚ÄúTobong‚Äôu Lorre! Welcome Home! ‚ÄòKenya is the home of humanity.‚Äô‚Äù The system‚Äôs efficiency and 5-minute turnaround time left me mildly impressed. While its necessity may be debated, as neither a Kenyan citizen nor taxpayer, I will not get into that debate. Suffice it to say the Kenyan ETA system works, is free (for me at least), and is fast. Other than that, I‚Äôm content to focus on the upcoming tasks in Nairobi. Kwa heri! P.S.: After receiving the approval I looked up and the system is ‚ÄúSemi-Automated‚Äù perhaps a testament to technology and AI gradually replacing human roles.\n\nI had an engaging discussion on BTV News ‚Äì Business with Kaelo Sabone this morning! We tackled the recent consequential case from the UK where the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld a complaint against Skydiamond for their misleading marketing and advertisement of lab-grown diamonds. The ruling was clear: Skydiamond cannot use terms such as ‚Äúdiamonds‚Äù, ‚Äúdiamonds made entirely from the sky‚Äù, or ‚ÄúSkydiamond‚Äù to describe their lab-created diamonds without a clear and prominent qualifier. They were also instructed not to refer to synthetic diamonds as ‚Äúreal diamonds‚Äù. Our conversation extended beyond this case, touching upon the broader landscape of Advertising Standards, the evolving role of Advertising, Social Media & Influencer Marketing, the emerging influence of Artificial Intelligence, and the critical importance of Consumer Protection. GIVEN THAT WE TALKED AT LENGTH ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - HERE IS AN AI-GENERATED SUMMARY OF THE MAIN POINTS I TRIED TO PUT ACROSS: IMPORTANCE OF PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION: Stressed the necessity of clearly differentiating new & emerging products from traditional ones to avoid misleading consumers into thinking. PURPOSE OF ADVERTISING: Highlighted advertising's role in providing information and choices to consumers, enabling informed decisions. LACK OF REGULATION IN BOTSWANA Pointed out the minimal advertising regulations in Botswana, contrasting it with stricter pre-approval processes in other countries. CHALLENGES WITH SOCIAL MEDIA: Discussed the ease of making deceptive claims on platforms like Facebook and TikTok, emphasizing the need for consumer discernment. INFLUENCER RESPONSIBILITY: Urged influencers to prioritize authenticity and knowledge about the products they endorse to maintain trust. CONSUMER RIGHTS AND FEEDBACK: Advocated for consumer rights to return products and stressed the importance of sharing experiences to enhance public knowledge. IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI): Warned of the challenges in distinguishing AI-generated content and the need for regulation and clear labelling to prevent misinformation. ETHICAL USE OF AI IN ADVERTISING: Called for vigilance and regulatory scrutiny to ensure the ethical use of AI in advertising, anticipating ongoing technological advancements and their implications. #AdvertisingStandards #ConsumerProtection #ArtificialIntelligence #InfluencerMarketing https://lnkd.in/d7qGh4fW"
