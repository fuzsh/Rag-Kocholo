        "text": "Great Salt Lake is known as “America’s Dead Sea”; it is the saltiest body of water in the western hemisphere. The Great Salt Lake is as much as nine times as salty as the oceans. The lake is so salty that you can’t sink…so be sure to go for a swim! Add a quick trip to the Great Salt Lake to your list of fun things to do in Salt Lake City. Great Salt Lake State Park Marina offers the closes access from downtown Salt Lake City, a 15-20 minute drive via Interstate 80. The Great Salt Lake is the largest lake west of the Great Lakes, measuring 70 miles in length, yet has a current maximum depth of less than 35 feet. It is a remnant of ancient Lake Bonneville, which covered a third of Utah before the climate…\n\nThe Salt Lake Temple is perhaps the most iconic building in Utah. Temple Square is the most visited attraction in Utah and no visit to Salt Lake City is complete without a great photo of the Mormon temple. Although closed to those who are not church members, the beautiful exterior architecture of the Salt Lake Temple makes it worth a visit; put this at the top of your list of fun things to do in Salt Lake City. Days after arriving in the Salt Lake Valley, Mormon church leader Brigham Young selected the site for the Salt Lake Temple. It is a six-spired structure made of granite from a nearby canyon. It is 186.5 feet long and 118 feet wide, with walls 167.5 feet high. The east center tower rises 210 feet into the air, topped with a 12.5-foot copper…\n\nWant to escape the city? One of the fun things to do in Salt Lake City is a trip out to Antelope Island on the Great Salt Lake. The largest island on the Great Salt Lake is home to one of the largest buffalo (American Bison) herds in the country. The buffalo is the largest land animal in North America, and an absolute crowd-pleaser for visitors of all ages. Several hundred buffalo roam the island, along with the second-fasted land animal in the world, the antelope (pronghorn). Other wildlife include our adorable mule deer, burrowing owls, coyotes, and several dozen species of birds depending on the time of year. Antelope Island also affords the opportunity to swim in the saltiest body of water in the western hemisphere (bring lots of quarters for the showers)…or perhaps just dip a toe in it…\n\nA visit to This Is The Place Heritage Park is one of the best things to do in Salt Lake City for visitors interested in learning about the trek out west along the famous Mormon Pioneer Trail. The trail from Nauvoo, Illinois, to the Great Salt Lake Valley was about 1,300 miles long, crossing parts of five different states (Illinois, Iowa, Nebrask, Wyoming and Utah). From 1846 to 1869, more than 70,000 Mormon pioneers traveled west on the trail. About 3,000 pulled handcarts (pictured in one of our posts last month). The first party included 143 men, three women, two boys, 72 wagons, 93 horses, 66 oxen, 52 mules, 19 cows, 17 dogs and some chickens. Future groups would average about 112 days to complete the journey. Join us on the Salt Lake City Tour or the Mormon Tabernacle Choir…\n\nThe First Presbyterian Church of Salt Lake City is one of the oldest non-Mormon churches in Utah. The striking red sandstone and beautiful stained glass windows make a visit to this church one of the top things to do in Salt Lake City for admirers of religious architecture. The church was organized in 1873 and the present structure, built in 1903, was restored in 2003. The architectural style is Gothic Revival, modeled after the Carlisle Cathedral in Carlisle, England. The red sandstone comes from nearby Red Butte Canyon. The three large stained glass windows were created in 1905 and include, “The Empty Tomb”, “Christ in the Manger”, and “Christ in Gethsemane”. To see the First Presbyterian Church, walk up South Temple Street for about 15 minutes from Temple Square; or join us on the Salt Lake City Tour or the…\n\nJourneys End is the bronze handcart monument featured prominently at This is the Place park, at the mouth of Emigration Canyon. The 1.5x life size sculpture of a Mormon pioneer family depicts them kneeling in gratitude for their safe arrival in the Salt Lake Valley. One of the must-do things to do in Salt Lake City is to hear the story of the Mormon handcart pioneers. Between 1856 and 1860, over 3000 Mormons (just a fraction of the overall group) made their journey westward by handcart. The handcart was the low-cost method of travel, 1/3 the cost of a wagon and oxen, which most used. The cost savings was a result of size as well as having to push/pull the cart oneself, rather than have animals power it. Each cart could carry 300 pounds of personal possessions and trail provisions…\n\nA visit to the Brigham Young Farmhouse is one of the many fun things to do in Salt Lake City for tourists. Originally built in 1863 and later relocated to its current location at Old Deseret Village, this home was one of many that Brigham Young had throughout the Utah Territory. The stucco farmhouse was designed in the tradition of New England inns. Brigham Young never peronsally lived in the house. Primarily a dairy farm to make butter and other products for Brigham Young’s family, it also was used for growing sugar beets, alfalfa, and raising silk worms to develop the silk industry in Utah. The Brigham Young Farmhouse was a show place for visiting dignitaries and family musical performances, dances, and dinner parties were held here. To see the Brigham Young Farmhouse at Old Deseret pioneer village, join us…\n\nA brief drive through historic Fort Douglas can be one of the fun things to do in Salt Lake City for visitors curious about early Utah history. During the Civil War, Colonel Patrick Connor and the California Volunteers were sent to Utah to guard a mail route. Colonel Connor had false suspicions that the Mormons were going to rebel against the country, so he chose to build the fort above the city to keep an eye on them. Originally known as Camp Douglas, named after Stephen A. Douglas who ran against Lincoln in the 1860 presidential election. The soldiers founded Utah’s first mining district in the mountains across the valley. Camp Douglas became Fort Douglas in 1878 due to its important role as a supply center in the West. During World War I and II, the fort served as a…\n\nWhen visiting Salt Lake City, there are some beautiful churches to see after you’ve explored Temple Square downtown. Take at least a few minutes to gaze upon the Cathedral of the Madeleine, it will be one of the more memorable things to do in Salt Lake City for those who appreciate architecture. A Catholic church built in 1909, the Cathedral of the Madeleine displays Romanesque architectural style on the outside and Gothic style on the inside. The cathedral appears essentially the same today as it did in 1909, a wonderful use of Utah sandstone. Click on the photo above to enlarge it and notice the gargoyles perched near the top of the two towers. Click HERE for a breathtaking panoramic virtual tour of the interior. It was designed by one of the great architects in America at the time, John…\n\nPut a sightseeing trip along South Temple Street on your list of fun things to do in Salt Lake City. Perhaps the most prominent mansion on old Brigham Street, as it was once known, is the Kearns mansion. Built in 1902 by a mining magnate and U.S. Senator, Thomas Kearns, the home was comparable in style and quality to eastern mansions like those of the Carnegies and Vanerbilts. It served as the site of many social events for Salt Lake City’s elite, where guests would dance to the music of live orchestras. President Theodore Roosevelt dined in the home, as well as many other political and religious dignitaries. In 1937, Jennie Kearns, Thomas Kearns’ widow, donated the mansion to the state of Utah, where it continues to be used today as the residence of Utah’s governor. Public tours of the…\n\nThis Is The Place Monument is one of the most important historical monuments in Salt Lake City. Make sure to include a visit to This Is The Place park on your list of fun things to do in Salt Lake City. The monument is located at the mouth of Emigration Canyon and was dedicated in 1947 to celebrate the centennial of the Mormon pioneer arrival in Salt Lake City. The monument gets its name from the famous words Brigham Young spoke on July 24, 1847, after gazing upon the valley for the first time, “This is the right place. Drive on.” The granite stone measures 60 feet in height and 80 feet in length. Bronze sculptures depict the Mormon pioneers as well as traders, trappers, explorers, and others who were instrumental in developing the West. At the top, the figures…\n\nA visit to the Mormon Battlion Monument can be one of the more interesting and educational things to do in Salt Lake City. For a year of military service, the 500 members of the Mormon Battalion purchased the future of their faith. Their march had the advantages of being able to show the United States government that they were truly loyal to the country, and the income it generated supported the men and their families in their exodus from Nauvoo, Illinois. The Mormon Battalion Monument pays tribute to the longest infantry march in United States history, extending nearly two thousand miles from Council Bluffs, Iowa to San Diego, California. In July 1846, over five hundred Mormon volunteers left their families on the trek from Nauvoo, Illinois, to assist in the war with Mexico. The accomplishments of the march were far-reaching: a road…"
