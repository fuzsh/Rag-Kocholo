        "text": "Comfortable clothing with a jacket and rain gear would be appropriate. Shorts are fine, as are appropriate T-shirts. There is no need for a coat or tie. We ask that all clothing be modest in coverage, fit and appearance. Lots of time outside so good shoes or boots will make the trip more enjoyable, along with a hat and some sunscreen. We will issue you an audio receiver that allows you to hear our guides from a distance through headphones or earbuds, which we provide. Some folks prefer to bring their own, so note that the audio sets take a 3.5mm jack for headphones and are not Bluetooth compatible.\n\nPassport—take a photo of it also, just in case.\n\nPrescriptions—make sure they are in the original bottle, and you have sufficient.\n\nCredit Card—preferably with no exchange fee.\n\nATM card—better to get cash with than the bank if there are no fees on your card.\n\nOutlet adaptors for electronics.\n\nRick Steves has some really helpful lists for European travel here.\n\nPassports and Visas—You need a passport that is valid through the departure date on your return to the USA. Generally, it takes about 6 weeks to process a passport so we strongly recommend getting yours soon to avoid paying expedited fees, if you do not have a current passport. Visas are not required for our trip if you are US citizens.\n\nLuggage—We are limited to one large suitcase and one overnight bag each, in addition to purses, laptops, etc. on the coach. Airlines generally allow one checked bag free on International flights and additional bags start at $100 – check with your carrier for specifics.\n\nClothing—Comfortable, breathable, easy to dry clothing and shoes will be helpful. Rain gear is crucial as this area is blessed with frequent precipitation. Jeans are fine on tour, while slacks and a collared shirt would be appropriate for the Welcome Banquet Monday evening and the Farewell banquet on Tuesday night. These are all merely recommendations and you ultimately need to decide on your wardrobe. Our desire is to communicate charity and respect to those around us by dressing modestly in coverage and fit whether we are at a formal dinner or strolling the beach.\n\nWhat to pack—This helpful packing checklist from Rick Steves, a popular travel writer, is a handy guide.\n\nA few personal tips from me for consideration\n\nTake a picture of your passport and keep it on your phone AND print it and keep it separate from the original. In case you misplace your original, this can be very helpful.\n\nAddress book—call me old-fashioned, but a postcard in the mail is far more exciting than an email, particularly to little ones.\n\nCredit Cards—Visa and MasterCard are widely accepted. American Express not as much. Make sure to let your bank and credit card company know you will be traveling so they don’t suspect fraud and shut your card down.\n\nCash—Scotland and England are on the Pound, and each takes the other’s notes and coins. I recommend using a debit card at ATM’s to draw local currency. Avoid currency exchange offices and local banks if possible. Generally, the exchange rate at your local bank is going to be very high, so there’s a cost to the comfort a pocketful of Pounds may bring. There are ATMs at the airport and within a few blocks of the hotels we are staying at. Check your bank fees for foreign transactions and any ATM fees so you can make a good decision. Rick Steves on money.\n\nPhones and Technology—Once again, Rick Steves has a nice explanation of various options on his website here.\n\nParticularly helpful article on Electric Adaptors and Converters.\n\nReading recommendations—Coming soon!"
