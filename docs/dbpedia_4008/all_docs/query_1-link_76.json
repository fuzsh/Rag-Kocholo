        "text": "This week, I paid our deposit for Mike and I to travel to Ireland in 2013 with our favorite Irish band, FinTan. So Ireland is on my mind right now, and I decided to go back through some of my photos from the 2009 trip (also with the band).\n\nThis photo from Glendalough has been on my work computer desktop for more than a year. If you look carefully through the remains of the gate, you can see a grave marker topped with a Celtic cross in the distance.\n\nThese three tombstones have stood at Glendalough for over a century.\n\nThis detail photograph of a Celtic cross is probably one of my favorites from the trip.\n\nThis moss-covered sarcophagus monument is in the cemetery that sits just below the crest of the Hill of Tara.\n\nOf course, not all of the photos I took of memorials were outdoors. This one was in the catacombs of Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin.\n\nThis statue is part of a memorial in St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nI completely missed last month’s Graveyard Rabbits carnival, which was “how long have they been there?’ The idea was to post the oldest grave/tombstone/memorial that you had photographed in your cemetery explorations. I’ve been uploading my photos to make a photo book because I was given a gift certificate for a rather nice photobook producer. The oldest memorials that I have photographed are not tombstones, but monuments inside Dublin cathedrals.\n\nSt. Patrick’s Cathedral holds the tomb of Fulk de Saundford, an Archbishop of Dublin. If I’m reading the inscription correctly, the year is 1261.\n\nThere was another effigy that was either unlabeled or whose label I did not see.\n\nChrist Church Cathedral also had effigies in a similar arrangement.\n\nThis one had a plaque with an inscription.\n\nOf course, I utterly failed to get a photograph of the famous Strongbow effigy in Christ Church. Maybe next time.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nAs promised in the first post on Christ Church Cathedral, we would visit the crypt. After our little diversion into what you cemetery blogger considers the perhaps overly macabre, here we are.\n\nThe lighting consists of spotlights on each monument, which can make even these little cherubs look a little more sinister.\n\nOnly a small section of the crypt is actually open, but the monuments are stunning. This one to John, Lord Bowes and Lord Chancellor of Ireland who died in 1767, was erected by his brother.\n\nAnother grief-stricken woman weeps forever over the body of Nathaniel Sneyd.\n\nThe tablet at the feet of the marble representation of the deceased recites his virtues.\n\nAnd Henry Mathias, assistant surgeon, has a marker that tells us not only the date of his death, but the latitude.\n\nRead Full Post »"
