        "text": "Ingrid Petit, associate at Feilden Fowles and project architect for the Fratry hall additions, was shortlisted for the MJ Long Prize for Excellence in Practice 2021. Find out more about the W Awards here\n\nA patchwork of visible repairs, Carlisle Cathedral echoes the Japanese tradition of kintsugi, the art of mending broken pottery by highlighting the seam with gold paint. Rather than disguising the fracture, the repair is treated as part of the history of the object. The ancient city of Carlisle, just south of the Scottish-English border, appears knitted from peach, dusky pink and dark red threads; the local quarries produce sandstone distinctive from each other in their tone, texture and how they fade with time.\n\nThe Cathedral precinct dominates the western quarter of the city, once a hive of religious activity. The first archaeological remains on the site date back to 1122, a much smaller Norman church with round arches and modest round-headed windows. Gothic additions were built in the 13th century, but became victim to numerous setbacks – the monastic cloisters were partially destroyed by Henry VIII’s Reformation and later, the nave was taken apart by English Civil War soldiers who used the stones to fortify Carlisle Castle against attack by the Scottish Presbyterian army. The Fratry hall was left marooned on the precinct’s west side, an island surrounded by a sea of tarmac.\n\nIt is within this historic layer cake that Feilden Fowles won a competition in 2014 to deliver a new café, education and community space, that would reconnect the Fratry hall and the cathedral. Project architect Ingrid Petit, who led the scheme from competition to completion last year, recalled how they won not with a fully resolved design but with a pledge to listen. One of a handful of employees that formed Feilden Fowles in their early years, Petit has been integral to the rise of the practice; joining as a Part I student in 2011, she returned after her Part II on the condition that she would be given a project to provide her with on-site experience.\n\nAlongside the practice’s studio at Waterloo City Farm, for which she was also project architect, Carlisle Cathedral became that project. Petit describes how, up until that point, it was not uncommon to be questioned over her youth and her gender, which is often equated with inexperience. ‘Almost every contractor I’ve ever worked with’, she recalls, ‘has made a comment about being female or being a foreigner.’ The client steering group at Carlisle Cathedral never prejudged her, allowing a collaborative relationship to be nurtured, and for Petit to prove how capable, determined and talented she is. Placing trust in young architects is one of the ways the profession will diversify, for one cannot grow without experience.\n\n‘Feilden Fowles show how to use historic language without straying into pastiche’\n\nWith dwindling congregations and never-ending repairs, churches must adapt to attract the growing demographic of other faiths and atheists among us if they are to survive. The new pavilion and restored Fratry elegantly balance the sacred and secular, creating a space for all to pause within the religious grounds. The well trodden thoroughfare, which cuts through the church estate and connects the town centre to the residential outskirts, is now interrupted by the new pavilion, changing the pace at which pedestrians move through the site. Prior to the recent interventions, locals would ‘race through without looking up, but now they stop, even when they are not here for a service’, Petit remarks.\n\nWorking hard with local schools and businesses, the architects have created inviting and useful public spaces for the community, both indoor and out. The perpendicular placement of the pavilion creates a new courtyard between the Fratry hall and the cathedral, sitting atop the footprint of the lost cloisters. In the midst of an ongoing pandemic, the creation of a sheltered outdoor space is even more well received than the architects could have anticipated; masked locals carry out trays of hot tea and sandwiches to the garden chairs.\n\nAn architect’s first instinct can often be to design in contrast to the context – here, employing playful ‘neo-neo-Gothic’ arches, Feilden Fowles show how to use historic language without straying into pastiche. Red sandstone (from the Locharbriggs Quarry across the border in Dumfries) was the obvious but fitting choice for the new pavilion. Sculpted not by hands, but digitally engineered by machine routers, each stone panel was hoisted into place and finished by local stonemasons. Paired with a glazed bronze link structure which connects the new pavilion to the Fratry, the two materials are imbued with sensitivity to their surroundings, as well as consideration of how they will age.\n\nThe pavilion has much greater presence than its square footage should allow. In plan, it is dwarfed by the cathedral; in person, it’s a compelling example of how civic language can elevate everyday buildings. The pavilion contains a new café and kitchen (particular care is taken to make the service elevation just as impressive as the more public faces). For past decades, they had been housed in the Fratry’s undercroft, a depressingly dark spot to have a coffee. Now, newly above ground, the café’s interior lets the views back to the cathedral take centre stage. Devoid of any religious paraphernalia, the palette echoes the natural tones of Carlisle, with plaster-pink walls, a poured terrazzo floor and pale oak joinery.\n\nLoad-bearing stone walls combined with a concealed lean steel frame negate the requirement for interfering columns, providing maximum space and flexibility for tables and chairs. Architect Amin Taha and engineer Steve Webb have since campaigned for the structural use of stone, describing stone as ‘the great forgotten material of our time’. Alongside stonemason Pierre Bidaud, they have proved that stone’s carbon footprint is just a tenth of the equivalent in concrete or steel. However, calculating the carbon impact of a building based on the assumption that it will last for hundreds of years can often feel like an architect’s way of absolving their responsibility. The naturally ventilated pavilion’s embodied carbon metrics sit comfortably below the London Energy Transformation Initiative (LETI) 2020 target, but they are far from 2030’s, inflated by the addition of the steel structure.\n\nThe Grade I-listed Fratry hall and undercroft have also been faithfully restored, the ’90s partitions stripped out, and built-in benches line the perimeter. The undercroft is, for the first time, fully accessible through the link’s lift, and now hosts the church’s educational activities. From the stairs connecting the café to the Fratry, you are confronted with a magnificently elevated view of the link’s delicate bronze mullions rising out of the pavilion’s earthy arched walls. Look up, and you’ll see the intricate diagrid of roof beams, which take reference from the stone ceiling motifs in the Fratry’s pulpit.\n\nAn inconveniently placed Roman drainage pipe running below the Fratry’s north wall has meant that for the past five centuries the structure has been slowly sinking. Victorian interventions had tried to resolve the shifting earth; in 1810, Robert Smirke carried out extensive restorations and added a new arched doorway, and then in 1880, GE Street reversed and lowered that doorway and added a porch. Petit, with engineer Peter Laidler of Structure Workshop, were next in line to tackle the notoriously difficult site. Their solution required painstakingly dismantling Street’s porch stone by stone, removing, re-reversing and reinstalling Smirke’s door in a raised position, and making a new opening to the undercroft – all while propping up the unstable outer wall.\n\nIt’s not a leap to say that Petit was the first female architect to work on the site. Feilden Fowles are also the first architects there to even begin to think about their intervention’s carbon impact. When Smirke and Street were deliberating over style, these issues were not on the table. Even the Church of England, one of the greatest landowners in the UK (with the leakiest infrastructure), have stated their sustainable allegiance. It is tempting to imagine what the next layer on the site might be. Petit hopes that the next decades will see renewable energy sources added to the cathedral roofs, and a green pathway extended from the precinct through the city for cyclists and pedestrians. The pavilion glimmers like the gold seam of a repaired vase, embedded in both its past and future."
