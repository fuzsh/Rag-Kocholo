Sad news in the Fringe family. Anna Torv (Olivia Dunham) has split with her husband, former Fringe co-star Mark Valley (John Scott). According to People magazine:

After a secret wedding over the holidays in 2008, Anna Torv and Mark Valley, who costarred on Fox's Fringe, have just as quietly ended their marriage, PEOPLE has confirmed.

The two tied the knot in a small ceremony in December 2008, and separated a few months ago.

Anna and Mark met on the set of Fringe and secretly married before the end of the first season, announcing their marriage to the cast and crew during the filming of the season finale.

Our best wishes go out to both Anna and Mark.
