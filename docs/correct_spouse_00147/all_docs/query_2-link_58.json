It’s better to be meditating, volunteering, or otherwise of service, but if we MUST watch screens, here are some ideas of what’s good and what’s not. Keep reading. Please comment!\n\n*****************************************************************\n\nAny Stephen Sondheim fans out there, particularly in the UK? A wonderful tribute by many of his original UK stage plays’ stars was made into a BBC special, Friends of Sondheim, filmed live in May, 2022, and is now on YouTube. The first few minutes are showing the opening credits from the original West Side Story; skip. The rest is almost 3 hours long, filled with great performances by UK musical stars of Sondheim shows PLUS Bernadette Peters! Photo montage of his life, surprise video performance of him with Andrew Lloyd Weber doing a parody, and more.\n\nShould have had captions for each performance, listing names, titles, shows. Oh, well.\n\nFantastic! Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFN0F8P1ebY\n\nNew in 2023 TV series for Amazon Prime and Netflix annotated here in these links:\n\nhttps://www.thewrap.com/whats-new-on-amazon-prime-video-january-2023/\n\nhttps://www.whats-on-netflix.com/coming-soon/new-netflix-shows-coming-in-2023-and-beyond/\n\nIf you have TV and/or devices (Roku, e.g.) that can do online streaming (and some even have their own channels), here are some updates and reviews to guide your viewing, below. Roku’s free options include The Roku Channel, Ovation Now, FilmRise, FreeVee, Tubi, PBS, NBC, ABC, TNT and many other network and cable channels streaming online shows (but, NOT CBS or CBS All Access: BOO!), as well as Hulu‘s, Peacock‘s and YouTube’s free components, and so much more. We can also skip the erratic behaviors of our Google ChromeCast and use Roku for Netflix, Amazon Prime, and other options the ChromeCast didn’t play nicely with at all. VERY fun!\n\nALSO: “You can stream IMDb TV titles from your web browser, the Prime Video app via the IMDb TV Channel, and through the IMDb TV [now FreeVee] app for Roku devices, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, PlayStation 4, LG TVs (released since 2018), Android TVs, and on Fire TV.”\n\nGreat entertainment, educational, homeschooling and often funny and bizarre options are offered hourly on Facebook Live, YouTube, TikTok, Vimeo and many individuals’ and groups’ websites: EVERYWHERE, these days!\n\n***********************************\n\nMusical Entertainment (many are regularly added to), on YouTube Channels\n\n(many also on TikTok, Twitch, Twitter, Facebook, and their own pages)\n\nFor inspiration, comic relief, amazement at talent, political parodies and heartwarming-ness\n\n(be sure to SUBSCRIBE and LIKE so they get their ad revenue!):\n\n—Schmigadoon Apple TV+, then YouTube (6 Episodes released 7/16/21, then segments, interviews, explanations and musical numbers appeared almost daily on YouTube in August, 2021; RENEWED for SEASON 2)\n\n“On a backpacking trip designed to reinvigorate their relationship, a couple discovers a magical town living in a 1940s musical; they then learn that they can’t leave until they find true love.”\n\nThe above description doesn’t begin to explain this gem, with an amazing cast and fun “Easter Eggs,” tropes and toss-backs to specific musicals and stars. Watch the numbers and 6 Episodes in any order, because the story doesn’t matter as much as the fun.\n\nStarring: Keegan-Michael Key, Cecily Strong, Fred Armisen, Dove Cameron, Kristen Chenowith, Aaron Tveit, Jane Krakowski, Alan Cumming, Ann Harada, Martin Short, and so many more from Broadway, musical and TV comedies.\n\nDelightfully musical, funny, fun! RENEWED for SEASON 2!\n\n—MisCast (MCC Theater) and Broadway Backwards (Playbill.com/video) offer delightful renditions posted on YouTube and elsewhere of songs from many shows and popular genres sung by the opposite or nongendered singers instead of the usual characters as designated. Fabulously talented people! MANY numbers and years of numbers.\n\nWARNING: Unless you like stripteases, nakedness and simulated sex acts and actual groping on stage (gay, lesbian, hetero, unknown), do NOT go to Broadway Bares (and some of the above videos automatically go there at their ends, for unknown reasons!).\n\n—Claire Ryann Crosby is an incredibly talented child singer who started me on this musical video journey, and she is truly amazing! Her dad (Dave), mom (Ashley), younger siblings and she comprise a musical family of great virtuosity and humility, both. Their videos and guest spots on Ellen are entertaining and inspiring, starting from when Claire was only 4 years old! Check them ALL out; she is now 7. She and her dad (on guitar) do many duets, and sometimes her mom accompanies on the piano, her younger brother (Carson) joins in, and soon, the younger sister (June) will, also. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfrREf-q6PbTxNgsB5XAp6A\n\nMat and Savannah Shaw another daddy-daughter duet team well worth exploring, especially if you like popular, somewhat Mormon/Christian, and wonderfully sung duos. Start from their first video and then go in order for a great progression of their confidence, Savannah’s voice, pre-recorded to live accompaniment, and the entire duo’s path: from singing in their house’s closet and then lip synching to seem “live,” to a professionally recorded album coming out, now! They even have a fan club and you can support their recording costs. As of December, 2020, they have two albums out and some streaming concerts!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/MatandSavanna/videos\n\n—The Marsh Family is an extremely talented British nuclear pod of 4 kids and 2 hetero parents. They all sing, play multiple instruments, create/contribute to timely parodies and lyrics and generally have a great time. Even the Huskie gets into the act! Go back to 2019 and watch them all!\n\n—–The Holderness Family offers songs, dances and other stuff (mostly sung, including ALL harmonies, by Daddy Penn, and choreographed by Mommy Kim, “creates original music, parodies, and Vlogs for YouTube to poke fun of themselves and celebrate the absurdity in circumstances most families face in their day-to-day life.” They often include wry and hilarious appearances by their children, Lola (now, 17) and Penn Charles (now 14 and very tall).BTW: They were on The Amazing Race, split over 2020 and 2021 because of COVID, and they WON! $1 million!!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/VisitTheGreenroom\n\n—Randy Rainbow is so great at writing, directing, singing ALL parts, costuming and staging his political parody music videos that he was nominated for an Emmy in 2019, 2020, 2021, but he keeps losing to James Corden‘s Carpool Karaoke. Too bad. Both are great, but not similar at all. His frequent contributions to our media are the main reasons many of us are not homicidal or locked in safe rooms during #45’s and his cronies’ illegal faux presidency and its never-ending aftermath. His fun continues into 2023, with tours, a book, and many appearances on podcasts and talk shows, so we are all blessed. He also has an autobiography out, Playing with Myself. Very fun!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Tday4U\n\n—Roy Zimmerman is a San Francisco Bay Area resident who does (and has been doing, for decades) original, funny, witty political parodies as well as other songs and some covers, solo with his guitar and sometimes with other musicians and Zoom collaborators. I got to see him perform LIVE in St. Charles, Missouri, a few years ago, and he is GREAT!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/RoyZimmerman\n\n—Sandy and Richard Riccardi have been around longer than I have (and that’s LONG), using her well-trained, great soprano voice and his piano playing and harmonies to create witty political parodies and other cabaret numbers, “comedy, jazz, classical, political satire and otherwise. Mostly otherwise.” So FUN!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/pfte1\n\n—Emma’s Revolution is the singer/songwriter duo of Pat Humphries and Sandy O, “whose songs have been sung for the Dalai Lama, praised by Pete Seeger, and covered by Holly Near [where I’ve seen them several times in concert]. With beautiful harmonies and genre-defying eclecticism,…” these feminist, activist musicians have each written, co-written, and performed for decades, and now do many political parodies and fundraisers. LOVE them! They also teach songs weekly, on Sundays, with excellent guest artists.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCERCZTaMxBvI3AY_-z1rQOg\n\n—Rufus Wainwright has done a live number almost every day as “Quarantunes”, accompanying himself on piano or guitar. Fabulous! In his bathrobe, usually, with longer-than-usual hair (as many did), he brings it! He showcases his new album on Austin City Limits in 2021, which was great.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzV2sYMCYqhCEPGDtVj7dIA\n\n—Jordan Rabjohn is a UK middle school music teacher who sings alone, with his amazing mother (also a smashing vocalist), and some gifted middle-schoolers in a variety of music videos, some made from his home with his mom. Bring tissues!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/JordanCharlieRabjohn\n\n—Lauren Mayer Comedy Songs wins for fastest parodies written (after the debacle of the presidential NOT-debate in September and the ketchup incident), and many other timely lyrical gems. All are excellent and entertaining, often to her own piano accompaniment and compositions. Very talented and fun performer/writer.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZHXM8gNIa8jBo25nB6gSuw\n\n—Adrian and Emma-Jean Galliard are another father-daughter singing pair who astound us. They’re coming to us from South Africa/Italy with extensive operatic and pop music chops. Watch from the beginning and see Emma-Jean growing up! They’re also on Spotify, but we see them on YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/c/AdrianEmmaJeanGalliardMusic\n\nMany singer/songwriters and other performers, including all genres (folk, bluegrass, indy, singer/songwriter, Americana, country, classical, jazz, hip-hop, rap, gospel), individuals and family groups, and some from movies/films and Broadway, have created home concert videos, Zoom collaborations, and outdoor performances you can find many online places.\n\nCheck out your faves, find new ones! Then SUBSCRIBE, LIKE, DONATE! Musicians, dancers, singers, actors, directors, choreographers, and ancillary workers for live performances are HURTING during the lockdown months of this pandemic, since almost all live music venues and events have been closed/canceled, and may be for many more months!\n\nBegun in fall, 2015, and updated often between “full” posts (check on Fridays), there is always something new here on my Friday TV Report blog posts for TV/streaming viewers.\n\nNext full post: 1/27/23\n\nOur other favorite awards show is the unique AARP Movies for Grown-Ups Awards (films only): this is fantastic! Airs first on 2/17/23, and will specially honor Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nLast year, it honored the great Lily Tomlin (currently co-starring with Jane Fonda in Grace & Frankie on Netflix)—“a critically acclaimed actress and comedian across TV, film and theater, and recipient of eight Emmy Awards®, two Tony Awards®, a Grammy Award®, among many others”— for Career Achievement. It was wonderful!\n\nFMI: https://www.aarp.org/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/annual-film-awards/\n\nYou can watch it online, any time after that date on http://www.pbs.org/. [NOTE: This link is for my St. Louis, MO, local PBS station; you may have to watch on your own local affiliate’s website.]\n\nDO IT! Great clips, interactions and explanations; truly well-done and quite moving.\n\nThe Golden Globes air on NBC 1/10/23 and The Oscars/Academy Awards occur on ABC 3/12/23.\n\nSome great DVDs (documentaries) we/I recently enjoyed and highly recommend (borrowed from our local library, but, with the quarantines in place, check if your library has re-opened; ours did, then re-closed, but we can request things and do curbside pickups!).\n\n—Miracle of Miracles: The Making of Fiddler on the Roof\n\nAlso, this aired on/around 11/13/20 on Great Performances, PBS, which means it’s online, as well.\n\n—Raise Hell: The Life & Times Of Molly Ivins\n\n—Mike Wallace is Here\n\n—Rocketman\n\nNewest plans for viewing network and cable TV channels in the USA (and a few new shows on Netflix) for 2023 (most are recorded to watch at our leisure), and a bit beyond. Full descriptions appear later in this post. Once we have weighed in, they appear below this section in “Yay,” “Nay,” or “Maybe.”\n\nI watch some by myself (while coloring; these are marked with one asterisk *; when Mom watches alone, usually after I go to bed, these are marked with 2 asterisks, **.\n\nReturning shows are in regular italics; new shows are in bold italics:\n\n2023 returns/premieres\n\n1/8/23—Miss Scarlet & the Duke SEASON 3 returns to PBS\n\n——All Creatures Great & Small returns for SEASON 3 to PBS\n\n1/10/23—Golden Globes on NBC\n\n1/15/23—The Way Home premieres on Hallmark\n\n1/23/23—Accused premieres on Fox [A&E airs Accused: Guilty or Innocent?]\n\n——9-1-1 Lonestar returns for SEASON 4 on Fox (BUMPED from 1/17/23)\n\n1/30/23—The Watchful Eye premieres on Freeform, double Episodes\n\nFebruary, 2023 The Ark premieres on SyFy\n\n2/2/23—Jack Reacher, SEASON 2, releases on AZ Prime\n\n2/8/23—Not Dead, Yet releases on Netflix\n\n2/9/23—*You returns for SEASON 4 to Netflix\n\n2/17/23—AARP Movies for Grown-Ups Awards on PBS\n\n2/19/23—The Company You Keep premieres on ABC\n\n——Found premieres on NBC\n\n2/26/23—The Blacklist returns for SEASON 10 on NBC\n\n3/1/23—True Lies premieres on CBS\n\nMarch, 2023 —Luther film releases on Netflix\n\n3/12/23—**The Oscars/Academy Awards air on ABC\n\n3/14/23—Superman & Lois returns for SEASON 3 on The CW\n\n3/19/23— Call the Midwife returns to PBS for SEASON 12\n\n——Sanditon returns to PBS for final SEASON 3\n\nApril, 2023—Dead City premieres on AMC\n\nApril, 2023—Heartland SEASON 15 releases on Netflix\n\nMay, 2023—The Mother releases on Netflix\n\nAlso in 2023:\n\n——Lupin SEASON 3 releases on Netflix\n\n——Endeavor returns for final SEASON IX on PBS\n\n——Resident Alien returns for SEASON 3 on SyFy\n\n——End of Watch premieres on Fox\n\n——The Irrational premieres on NBC\n\n——The Diplomat releases on Netflix\n\n——Schmigadoon releases for SEASON 2 (Apple TV+, then YouTube)\n\n——Dark Winds SEASON 2 returns to AMC\n\nUPDATE (as of 1/6/23):\n\nCANCELED/Finished: The End Game, Good Sam, The 4400, Charmed, Our Kind of People, Ordinary Joe, Promised Land, The Big Leap, Bull, AP Bio, Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist, Rebel, Law & Order: For the Defense; Another Life, After Life, Grace & Frankie, Ozark, black-ish, How we Roll, Jack Ryan, Mr. Mayor, Roswell: New Mexico, Naomi, Mr. Mayor, B Positive, Carter, Gentleman Jack, Northern Rescue, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, Paper Girls, The Chair, Monarch, Borgen\n\nand these have/had one more/final SEASON, in 2022-23-24: Endeavor, The Orville, Star Trek: Picard, Manifest, The Crown, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, The Coroner, The Handmaid’s Tale, New Amsterdam, Endeavor, Mr. Mayor, Grey’s Anatomy, Sanditon\n\nRENEWED: Abbott Elementary, Almost Paradise, All Creatures Great and Small, Around the World in 80 Days, Days of Our Lives: Beyond Salem, Blue Bloods, Call the Midwife; Celebrity Wheel of Fortune, College Bowl, all 3 Chicago, CSI; Vegas; Documentary Now!; Doom Patrol, Emily in Paris, Heartland, Jeopardy, La Brea, all 3 Law & Order; Last Week with John Oliver, Late Night with Seth Meyers, Law & Order and Law & Order: SVU, Leverage: Redemption, Midsomer Murders, Nancy Drew, all 3 NCIS; all 3 FBI; Outlander, Professor T, Reacher, Schmigadoon, Sex Education, Star Trek: Discovery, Station 19, Superman & Lois, Sweet Magnolias, The Blacklist, The Equalizer, The Good Doctor, The Oval, The Resident, The Rookie, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, The Wheel of Time, Titans, Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, Transplant, Under the Vines, Upload, Van der Valk, Virgin River, Wheel of Fortune, You, Young Sheldon, When Calls the Heart, The Lincoln Lawyer; Dark Winds, The Witcher, Lupin, Firefly Lane, Quantum Leap\n\n—DVDs or Roku channels for latest SEASONS of Shetland, The Good Fight, Big little Lies, Queens of Mystery, Line of Duty, Midsomer Murders, My Life is Murder in April, 2023, and others we can’t get on basic cable channels, e.g., Heartland (SEASON 16 and later), Ms. Fisher’s Modern Murder Mysteries, Doom Patrol, Star Trek: Discovery & Picard; and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries’ series.\n\n********************************************\n\nWhenever a show/series is canceled, I erase the review and its listing from this page and the opinion section (because, otherwise, this compilation gets too long). Likewise, whenever I/we dislike a show, I list it at the end of this post for only its active year, then I erase it.\n\nI am maintaining a summary section (“Yays,” “Nays,” and “Maybe/Still Considering”) for the current year’s shows (until canceled; see above) and for any series that are continuing or still available to view (some on DVD, for us). I add to reviews of many previously reviewed shows with new info/casting, renewals, and opinions often, so check weekly if you’re interested in those updates.\n\nWhile we can understand the urge to be timely, the heavy-handedness and pervasiveness of stories that feature “us” vs. “them,” whether “they” are mutants, aliens, Earthlings from the future with special powers, immigrants to the USA (Middle-Easterners or former USSR folks, usually with questionable immigration status or criminal tendencies), sex traffickers and greedy/criminal politicians, we do NOT want our “entertainment” to be filled with “news of the day” so much that we can never relax or feel entertained.\n\nWe watch Rachel Maddow. I listen to NPR and Mom watches many other news shows (Chris Hayes, Lawrence O’Donnell, Joy Reid, Ari Melber, Chris Hayes, others on MSNBC). That’ is plenty of “reality” for us.\n\nWe are not eager to continue watching shows whose plots and characters are disturbing in the same ways “real life” is. We start, then we stop watching. Therefore, some series we had originally put on the “Yay” side are now in “Maybe/Still Considering,” or all the way to “Nay” at this time. Same goes for shows whose casting or writing team seemed promising but turned out to disappoint.\n\nWe think the first one or two airings of any SEASON’s shows on TV are similar to serving dishes at a pot luck table that look popular, due to being mostly empty early on: many pot luck goers may take more of those first-up casseroles or even clean out the pie pans near the start of the line (watch one or 2 Episodes of a series or spend an viewing entire evening on one station), but no one knows whether or not the choosers actually LIKED what they selected! The food could end up mostly uneaten, tossed or traded away. Likewise, the “high ratings” for these first weeks could dramatically diminish once people have sampled enough to know what they like and don’t like, see what else is on, plan their viewing schedules.\n\nThe REAL test occurs week 3: what do viewers return to watch? So, stay tuned, ratings-wise. It’s after week 2 that some shows are “summarily” canceled, even when they have the rest of the SEASON in the “can.”\n\nIf you want to keep up with Netflix and other streaming and DVD sites’ offerings, this weekly update from https://movierewind.com/everything-netflix/ is unmatched. [BTW: I get no kickback, but I do subscribe and suggest you do the same (it’s free!).]\n\nHere’s what the Movie Rewind team provides, weekly:\n\n“Netflix Instant Streaming and DVD release dates as they become available …Red Subheadings tell you if the titles are DVD or Instant Streaming, U.S. or Canada.\n\nGreen Subheadings are for Amazon Prime Instant Streaming titles.\n\nYou’ll find some TV series Hulu, Acorn TV, Networks, and other platforms information in Pink.\n\n“I can only include selected Canadian Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu titles – TV series and hot new movies.”\n\nCollider.com offers great genre lists of Netflix‘s library (“Best TV Shows on Netflix” is one of them), and its own reviews, news, and opinions of many TV series, characters, writers, directors.\n\nThis is the 90th Post for 12/16/22, Updated 1/6/23\n\n(each post is UPDATED on most interim Fridays)\n\nNext full post: 1/27/23\n\nOur constantly updated summary (newly put into the sections for “Yays” and “Nays” and “Maybe/Still Considering”), with CANCELED or RENEWAL notices, for the current TV year (UPDATED 1/6/23).

We live in the suburbs of St. Louis, Missouri, USA (Midwest, for those of you unfamiliar: think of that huge “Gateway Arch”—That’s here). I grew up here but then didn’t live here for 42 years; I’ve been back since August, 2014.\n\nWe were both raised Jewish, but I have been a meditator since 1972 and a practicing Buddhist since 1996. We are both Caucasian women-born-women. We are considered “middle class” although we have almost zero dollars of “disposable income.” My mom is hetero; I am bisexual. We are both partly disabled. I am highly educated (through a doctoral degree plus other training); my mom has extensive work experience, with a high school diploma.\n\nMy mom has been a TV watcher for 65+ years. I watched a lot as a kid, but from about 1972 – 2002, I didn’t have a TV and hardly watched it elsewhere, either. I usually didn’t have a TV between 2005 – 2014 as well, but I watched some shows online (Hulu, usually) or Netflix.\n\nWe think we should be part of a group that at least some producers are aiming to please, because we (especially Mom) now watch a lot of television. We also get movies regularly from DVD borrowing through our local library. We even occasionally go to a theatre to see a movie. We eagerly await the “new season” of television every one of the four times it seems to occur every year: “Fall Sweeps” happen, but so do Mid-season Sweeps, Mid-year New Seasons, and channels with an entirely different set of “seasons.”\n\nHowever, we are consistently disappointed that many shows we do like are canceled and some shows we despise seem to go on forever. Plus, we have several pet peeves:\n\n—“Why is it always so dark in all these shows? I can’t see a thing. What is the point?” THE CW’s and most dramas are notorious for this futile attempt at ratcheting up the tension. If we can’t see the action, there IS NO TENSION!\n\n—“Why is the music so loud but the dialogue is barely audible?” Hallmark films are the worst for this violation of common sense.\n\n—“Why do so many writers depict adult characters as adolescents with endless insecurities and incessant competition and/or bickering?” They have these arrested development tropes on most shows: many dramas get so “teenage soapy” we stop watching, and it’s even worse on comedies, regardless of gender, ethnicity, and age. Mysteriously inane.\n\n—“Car chases, foot chases and fighting are NOT PLOT.” Neither are endless shots of feet/shoes moving, long shots of whatever, and aerials (stock footage, usually, trying to “prove” a location that is false). Use your time better, directors and editors!\n\n—“There is no one to like on this show!” Even more true, now….\n\nKeep up with the changes! http://thefutoncritic.com/guide/\n\nor here, for the schedule (UPDATED 1/6/23, for future months):\n\nhttps://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/ending-or-cancelled-tv-shows-for-the-2022-23-season/\n\nand https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/which-tv-shows-are-renewed-which-are-canceled-in-2022-2023/\n\nWe don’t watch: most “sit coms”; any zombie or most vampire shows; reality shows (except the baking shows on BBC/ABC); extremely violent shows; premium channels (HBO, Showtime, Starz, EPIX, Cinemax, Sundance NOW) or other pay channels (Sundance TV, CBS All Access, Disney+, etc.); most YA/”teen” or any children’s/animated shows. We do sometimes get the local library’s DVDs or watch Netflix/Amazon Prime airings of these pay shows, about one year later.\n\nNOTE: Our viewing “schedule” includes a lot of recording-and-watching-later, due to simultaneous broadcasts and my early bedtime.\n\n**usually only Mom watches\n\n*usually only I watch\n\nPost 90 for 12/16/22, Updated 1/6/23\n\nI/we continue with this Friday TV Report: New and Returning PBS/BBC, Netflix, Amazon Prime, regular cable network (non-premium) TV Shows and some specials (shows that were more recently viewed are higher up on the review sections) and some on DVD from our local library (that were on premium or non-USA channels, originally).\n\nShows we recently have watched and reviewed (UPDATED 1/6/23)\n\n*Lucifer Netflix (was Fox to start) (6 SEASONS, all released)\n\nBased on comic books (so be prepared), this “American urban fantasy television series developed by Tom Kapinos …concluded on September 10, 2021….[It is] …based on the DC Comics character created by Neil Gaiman, Sam Kieth, and Mike Dringenberg…\n\n“Lucifer Morningstar (Tom Ellis) [is] the DC Universe‘s version of the Devil, who abandons Hell for Los Angeles where he runs his own nightclub named Lux and becomes a consultant to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). The ensemble and supporting cast include Lauren German as Detective Chloe Decker, Kevin Alejandro as Detective Daniel “Dan” Espinoza, D. B. Woodside as Amenadiel, Lesley-Ann Brandt as Mazikeen, Rachael Harris as Dr. Linda Martin, and (beginning in season 2) Aimee Garcia as Ella Lopez.”\n\nInteresting enough to keep watching, but very comic-book-like\n\nEmily in Paris Netflix (SEASON 3 released 12/21/22; RENEWED for SEASON 4)\n\nLily Collins is wonderful (yes; Phil Collins’ daughter!) as Emily, an American sent by her fashion mag almost by accident (her “geriatric” boss is pregnant) without any French or travel experience, but great clothes and attitude. She has fun adventures, with a great supporting cast including Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, Ashley Park, Samuel Arnold, Camille Razat, Lucas Bravo.\n\nWe continue to enjoy the outlandish (but WAY too revealing) costumes, but the subplots and main characters’ ineptness with relationships are tedious.\n\nWe like this; RENEWED for SEASON 4\n\nTom Clancy’s Jack Ryan Amazon Prime (SEASON 3 released 12/21/22; RENEWED for final SEASON 4)\n\nJohn Krasinski (How I Met Your Mother) does all right as the newest Jack Ryan (but we liked Chris Pine better, and who can forget Harrison Ford, Ben Affleck or Alec Baldwin, all of whom have had a turn playing this iconic role?), as do the other cast members, with the lousy script they were given.\n\nBut, this version has too many car chases, too much violence/torture, and too many anti-heroes/villains for our taste. We keep starting and not going back.\n\nMom is a long-time reader and fan of both the Jack Ryan books and films and was very put off and confused by how out-of-context most of this new series seemed to all the rest that have already been made/written. I’ve only seen a few films and never read any of the books, but I agree.\n\nAlso, in trying to modernize it (original was set in the 1970s-80s), they set Ryan and the CIA in yet another tired plot of Middle-Eastern-men-as-villains in SEASON 1 and similarly in SEASON 2, but in Venezuela, with car bombs, deception. We also don’t like plots with revenge-seeking for events from 30+ years ago and more recent hostility, etc., nor do we want to watch “interrogation” scenes, which we hate.\n\nWe watched all 8 Episodes of SEASON 1, and some are all right, but VERY dark and violent. We only got through 1 Episode of SEASON 2 and can’t seem to go back.\n\nWhat happened to Ryan’s girlfriend?\n\nStarring: John Krasinski, Wendell Pierce (Suits)\n\nToo much violence and not enough script; RENEWED for SEASON 4\n\nKaleidoscope Netflix (all Episodes released 1/1/23)\n\nKaleidoscope “is a thrilling crime drama that follows a master thief and his team as they try to execute an impressive heist worth up to $7 billion. However, their plans are complicated by treachery, greed and other treats that come their way” that is a “decades-spanning anthology series” that can be watched in any order as long as the final Episode is the last one watched.\n\nThe characters aren’t as likable as any of those on Leverage or in the Oceans films, and the tech/strategies aren’t as creative, but we like this all right.\n\nStarring: Giancarlo Esposito, Paz Vega, Rufus Sewell, Tati Gabrielle, Peter Mark Kendall and Rosaline Elbay.\n\nWe like this\n\n*Traces was BBC One; DVD for us (6 Episodes, released Dec, 2019, & SEASON 2 April, 2022; LIMBO for SEASON 3, expected in February, 2023 on Alibi/BBC One; then, DVD).\n\nA lot of twists and unexpected turns to this cold case brought back to “life” series fir SEASIB 1. Kept my attention, but not Mom’s. SEASON 2 couldn’t be focused on Emma, though, an I think it went off the rails.\n\nCo-created and co-written by Val McDermid (an author whose books I like a lot) and Amelia Bullmore (who starred in and wrote some of Scott & Bailey, which we liked), SEASON 1 “focuses on three female forensic professionals, Emma Hedges, Sarah Gordon and Kathy Torrance, working together at the Scottish Institute of Forensic Science (SIFA) … as they uncover the truth of a murder case and bring a killer to justice…[they] try to unearth the truth about an unsolved murder that’s very close to home. A fatal fire in a nightclub proves an ill omen for Emma’s [Windsor] return to Dundee. Her mother’s unsolved murder comes into sharp focus, forcing Emma to turn to her new boss, Sarah [Fraser], for support….[T]he stars align to put Daniel [Compston] in her path….”\n\nSEASON 2 had many unnecessary subplots, bad outcomes, and odd changes in characters that I really did not like at all.\n\nStarring: Molly Windsor, Laurie Fraser, Jennifer Spence as the 3 professionals, and Martin Compston (Line of Duty), Michael Nardone and Vincent Regan, with a great supporting cast.\n\nCreepy, and not great plotting; LIMBO for SEASON 3\n\nMagpie Murders PBS (premiered 10/16/22)\n\nThe going back-and-forth between the novel and the live action is very confusing, especially since many of the actors have dual roles. Otherwise, we ike it.\n\n“Based on the 2016 novel by British author, Anthony Horowitz, …starring Lesley Manville (World on Fire, Phantom Thread), Conleth Hill (Game ofThrones) and Tim McMullan (Patrick Melrose), [the series] tells the story of a book editor set out to obtain the final pages of a famed author’s latest novel. But what she finds instead leads to a winding mystery she never expected.”\n\nWe like this\n\nAnnika PBS (premiered 10/16/22)\n\nI’m not a big fan of shows that “break the 4th wall” by having an actor or character talk directly into the camera/to the audience, but all that aside, this new show is good. We like it: tight action, good dialog, some humor, realistic but not too gory. The Scottish accents, as in Shetland, are difficult at first for us USA listeners, but we get into the rhythm after a while.\n\nStarring one of the most versatile and best actors in the BBC stable, Nicola Walker (Unforgotten, River, The Split), as “the sharp, witty and enigmatic DI Annika Strandhed as she heads up a new specialist Marine Homicide Unit (MHU) that is tasked with investigating the unexplained, brutal, and seemingly unfathomable murders,” with Silvie Furneaux as her daughter, Morgan, and Jamie Lives (Guilt), Katie Leung (The Nest), Ukweli Roach (Blindspot) and Kate Dickie (The Cry).\n\n“The radio series follows Scandinavian detective Annika Strandhed, a ‘leading light in the murder squad of the Oslo police. In the TV series (penned by…Nick Walker [no relation to Nicola]), Annika will similarly oversee her [Glasgow] unit—while coping with her ‘brilliant yet complex’ teenage daughter, Morgan. And in an unusual twist compared to most crime dramas, Annika will reportedly break the fourth wall in most episodes in order to explain her cases to the watching viewers at home.”\n\nWe like it\n\nMiss Scarlet and the Duke, Masterpiece Mystery PBS (returned 10/16/22 for SEASON 2 and returns 1/8/23 for SEASON 3)\n\nWe still LOVE this! Very well-written, amazing costumes, and great acting. Kate Phillips (Peaky Blinders) is perfect as Eliza Scarlett, “the first-ever female detective in Victorian London…who won’t let any naysayers stop her from keeping her father’s business running…. Her partner in detective work is … her childhood friend, professional colleague, and potential love interest, Scotland Yard Detective Inspector William Wellington, a.k.a., The Duke,” a Hugh Jackman lookalike, Stuart Martin (Jamestown), who plays well against/with Phillips.\n\nMoses (Ansu Kabia) is a great “assistant” for Scarlet, too.\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/specialfeatures/miss-scarlet-and-the-duke-s1-everything-you-need-to-know-about/\n\nAlso starring: Andrew Gower (Poldark, Outlander), Kevin Doyle (Downton Abbey), Ansu Kabia (World on Fire, The Long Song), and Cathy Belton (Philomena).\n\nWe love it; RENEWED for SEASON 3\n\nThe Coroner The CW (returned 10/2/22 for SEASON 4)\n\nThis is the newest CBC legal/medical drama, and it’s pretty dark and STRANGE. But, very well done. We like it somewhat, but her and others’ mental health issues are a bit much.\n\nStars Roger Cross (Dark Matter, Orphan Black) and Serinda Swan.\n\n“The series, which will shoot in Toronto, centers on a newly appointed coroner investigating suspicious deaths in Toronto….Inspired by M.R. Hall’s best-selling book series, Coroner centers on a newly appointed coroner investigating suspicious deaths in Toronto.” Serinda Swan (Inhumans) fills the title role of “Jenny Cooper, a brave, determined yet vulnerable coroner driven by an intense desire for the truth. A former ER doctor and recently widowed mother, the passing of her beloved husband has unlocked a primal connection to death, tied to a secret in her past that is only now coming to the surface. She loves her son more than life itself and strives to support him while also trying to take care of herself.”\n\nWe do like a lot of CBC’s (Canadian Broadcasting Company) TV series, but this adds to an already ridiculously high number of medical/legal dramas. How many ways can people find bodies killed in how many ways? We’ve already seen dozens of repeated body discovery scenarios and similar murder methods across the many shows we watch/have watched.\n\nWe used to like it more; VERY depressing, though, with her mental health problems, and now, disjointed, with Jenny in Seattle and the others in Toronto, still.\n\nWeird for final SEASON 4\n\nAlaska Daily ABC (premiered 10/6/22)\n\nThis series “revolves around a star journalist (Swank) who moves to Alaska for a fresh start after a career-killing misstep and finds redemption personally and professionally after joining a daily metro newspaper in Anchorage.”\n\nWe like this a lot and hope for each Episode to bring us new scenery and info about Alaska!\n\nStarring: Hilary Swank and Jeff Perry, Matt Malloy, Meredith Holzman, Grace Dove, Pablo Castelblanco, Ami Park, Craig Frank.\n\nVery good\n\nQuantum Leap reboot NBC (premiered 9/19/22)\n\n“It’s been 30 years since Dr. Sam Beckett stepped into the Quantum Leap accelerator and vanished. Now a new team has been assembled to restart the project in the hopes of understanding the mysteries behind the machine and the man who created it.”\n\nEthnic change for the leaper; gender flip for the holo. Otherwise, same.\n\nStarring: Raymond Lee as Dr. Ben Song; Caitlin Bassett as Addison Augustin, (Song’s fiancé and his holo helper; Ernie Hudson as Herbert “Magic” Williams; Mason Alexander Park as Ian Wright.\n\nWe loved the original; this one’s okay, so far\n\nThe Rookie: Feds ABC (series premiered 9/27/22)\n\nWe liked the embedded pilot for this show, aired last spring in The Rookie, and were glad to see Nathan Fillion and others from the original show in this Episode for its fall premiere. The premise could get old, though, if they don’t step it up. How many ways and times does she have to “prove herself”? Kind of silly.\n\n“Simone Clark is a force of nature, the living embodiment of a dream deferred—and the oldest rookie in the FBI Academy. She is a single mother of two who put her dreams on hold to make sure her kids pursued their own—and she never has shied away from a challenge or a fight. Planted spinoff follows the premise of The Rookie, which follows the oldest rookie in the LAPD.”\n\nStarring: Niecy Nash\n\nWe mostly like this\n\nVan der Valk PBS (returned for SEASON 2 on 9/25/22; RENEWED for SEASON 3, which airs in the UK first)\n\nDetective series based in Amsterdam, but mostly in English. Very well-done.\n\nStarring: Marc Warren, Maimie McCoy, Luke Allen-Gale, Elliot Barnes-Worrell.\n\nWe like this for SEASON 2; RENEWED for SEASON 3\n\nSo Help Me, Todd CBS (premiered 9/29/22)\n\nWe liked this a LOT, Episode 1, but Episode 2 got into slapstick and silly way too often… Hmmm.\n\nWe have always appreciated both Harden and Astin, and they are great together in this fresh approach, a unique legal family dramedy. Give it a try!\n\n“[This series] stars…Marcia Gay Harden and Skylar Astin as razor-sharp, meticulous attorney, Margaret Wright (Harden) and Todd (Astin), her talented but scruffy, aimless son whom she hires as her law firm’s in-house investigator. As the black sheep of the well-heeled Wright family, Todd is a laid-back, quick-thinking, excellent former private detective who fell on hard times after his flexible interpretation of the law got his license revoked. Margaret’s penchant for excellence and strict adherence to the law is at complete odds with Todd’s scrappy methods of finding his way through sticky situations: by the seat of his wrinkled pants. When Todd inadvertently teams with his mother on a case, she’s surprised to find herself duly impressed by—and proud of—his crafty ability to sleuth out information with his charm and his wide-ranging tech savvy. At last, Margaret sees a way to put her son on a ‘suitable’ path to living an adult, financially solvent life she approves of, and she asks him to join her firm. Todd agrees, since it means getting his license back and once again doing the job he excels at and loves. Mother and son working together is a big first step toward mending their fragile, dysfunctional relationship, and they may even come away with a better understanding of each other at this pivotal point in their lives. But whether Todd and Margaret will be able to accept each other for who they are is another case entirely.”\n\nThis is fun and unique\n\nEast New York CBS (premiered 10/2/22)\n\nAmanda Warren is new to us, and fantastic in this role. Smits and Kind have little to do, but the others are interesting and we like this show.\n\n“Regina Haywood is the newly promoted police captain of East New York, an impoverished, working-class neighborhood at the eastern edge of Brooklyn. She leads a diverse group of officers and detectives, some of whom are reluctant to deploy her creative methods of serving and protecting during the midst of social upheaval and the early seeds of gentrification.”\n\nStarring: Amanda Warren as Deputy Inspector Regina Haywood, Jimmy Smits as Chief John Suarez, Kevin Rankin as Detective Tommy Killian; Richard Kind as Captain Stan Yenko; Elizabeth Rodriguez as Detective Crystal Morales.\n\nWe like this\n\nFamily Law The CW (premiered 10/2/22)\n\nWe have seen all of these stars before and really like them. The two actors who play Bianchi’s half-siblings are new to us, but good. If they can downplay the drinking (especially her mother’s, as played by Lauren Holly) and highlight the cases, we’re in.\n\n“Family Law follows lawyer and recovering alcoholic Abigail Bianchi (Jewel Staite, Firefly) struggling to put her career and family back together after hitting rock bottom. As a condition of her probation, Abby is forced to work at her estranged father Harry’s (Victor Garber) firm, Svensson and Associates, and practice in family law for the first time while forging new relationships with the half-brother Daniel (Zach Smadu) and half-sister Lucy (Genelle Williams) whom she’s never met. The result is a dysfunctional family law firm operating to help other families with their own dysfunctions.”\n\nWe like this very much\n\nBlue Bloods CBS (returned 10/14/22 for SEASON 13)\n\nMy mom LOVES this show and watches re-runs for fun, mostly because she loves Tom Selleck as the family patriarch and Chief of Police. It’s grown on me.\n\nMORE STORY! Less angst!\n\nDefinitely staying tuned, if only to see what these writers are up to each year. SEASON 13 has already kept its promise to include the erstwhile nephew, Joe, Jr., previously unknown son of the dead brother/son, Joe.\n\nAlso starring: Donnie Wahlberg, Bridget Moynahan, Will Estes, Len Cariou, Sami Gayle, Marisa Ramirez and Vanessa Ray.\n\nOkay for SEASON 13\n\n*Grey’s Anatomy ABC (returned 10/6/22 for final SEASON 19)\n\nI am a long-time fan of this show, especially, Ellen Pompeo. Spawned its 3rd and 4th spin-offs for 2018!\n\nBut, WHY do they have to keep threatening to kill Meredith Grey off? TIRED tropes! And, bringing back her dead husband for brief scenes? WHY?\n\nRichard Flood is a good addition and possible love interest for Meredith (“a gift from Cristina”), replacing Karev, but what the HELL, writers? Terrible, not credible, awful departure storyline for Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and horrible treatment of Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington).\n\nPlenty to keep one’s interest, if you like these characters and this kind of drama, which I do (Mom stopped watching this years ago: “Too much sex” was her reason.).\n\nExcellent character arcs for Dr. Bailey (Chandra Wilson), Owen (Kevin McKidd) and Amelia (Caterina Scorsone).\n\nJake Borelli (the other half of the gay male couple–see below) has done well for SEASONS 16 – 18; now Chief Resident (!?!) for SEASON 19.\n\nGreat crop of new interns for this final? SEASON, including one from Glee (Harry Shum, Jr.)! The rest are: Alexis Floyd, Midori Francis, Adelaide Kane, Niko Terho.\n\nAlex Landi is this series’ first gay male surgeon, Dr. Nico Kim. Better late than never!\n\nThe series has been groundbreaking with featuring and starring lesbians, bisexuals and questioning women, and some trans characters floated around.\n\nLove the anti-homophobia story lines and the actions/discussions the show inspires, especially for parents of LGBT kids and for everyone about bullying. Excellent PSAs built right into the show.\n\nVery strong return for each SEASON, and I always enjoy it, even though some key characters keep leaving/being asked to leave.\n\nHappy to keep Chris Carmack (Nashville) as the orthopedic surgeon with an attitude and Kim Raver as regulars.\n\nGood for SEASON 19\n\nStation 19 ABC (returned 10/6/22 for SEASON 6)\n\nThis show has evolved with many crossovers with Grey’s Anatomy (situations and casting, family overlaps and more), but TOO MUCH SEXUAL and PERSONAL DRAMA! We do keep watching, though…\n\nStarring: Jaina Lee Ortiz, Grey Damon, Barrett Doss, Jason Winston George, Danielle Savre, Jay Hayden, Stefania Spampinatio. Boris Kodjoe, Josh Randall, Carlos Miranda, Merle Dandridge.\n\nGood enough for SEASON 6\n\nThe Good Doctor ABC (returned 10/3/22 for SEASON 6)\n\nI had thought I was kind of bored with autistic savant characters (they’re EVERYWHERE, now, aren’t they?), but this series is excellent, despite the trite trope. Each Episode is somewhat Royal Pains-like (improvising in restaurants; chest tubes with ball-point pens types of “surgeries”), but we like it.\n\nSEASONS 2 and 3 had strong starts, despite constant casting shifts. more for SEASON 4: adding new Residents, Summer Brown, Bria Samone Henderson, Noah Galvin, Brian Marc, and no more Nicholas Gonzalez (killed him off). TOO MUCH COVID! SEASON 4 kind of went off the rails into SEASON 5, but then got better midseason.\n\nStarring Freddie Highmore as Shawn Murphy, and including a couple of familiar faces [Richard Schiff (The West Wing) and Hill Harper (Covert Affairs, CSI: NY)]. Also, Antonia Thomas as Dr. Claire Browne, Tamlyn Tomita as Allegra Aoki, Christina Chang as Dr. Audrey Lim, Fiona Gubelman as Dr. Morgan Reznick, Paige Spara as Lea Dilallo.\n\nWe really like this one; Keeping & okay for SEASON 6\n\nNCIS: Hawai’i CBS (returned 9/20/22 for SEASON 2 [CROSSOVER with NCIS])\n\n“Jane Tennant (Vanessa Lachey), has thrived and risen through the ranks by equal parts confidence and strategy in a system that has pushed back on her every step of the way. Together with her unwavering team of specialists, they balance duty to family and country while investigating high-stakes crimes involving military personnel, national security and the mysteries of the sun-drenched island paradise itself.”\n\nScripts by Matt Bosack, Jan Nash and Christopher Silber.\n\nNot very exciting opener, but we’ll continue because NCIS. It did get better. SEASON 2 is off to a great start.\n\nStarring Vanessa Lachey as the first female Special Agent in Charge, Jane Tennant, of the NCIS Pearl Harbor field office; and, Yasmine Al-Bustami as Lucy, Jason Antoon as Ernie, and Noah Mills as Jesse.\n\nWe like it for SEASON 2\n\nFBI: International CBS (returned 9/19/22 for SEASON 2)\n\nThis “follows the elite operatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s ‘International Fly Team.’ Headquartered in Prague, they travel the world with the mission of tracking and neutralizing threats against American citizens wherever they may be. Not allowed to carry guns, the Fly Team relies on intelligence, quick thinking and pure brawn as they put their lives on the line to protect the U.S. and its people.”\n\nThe writers and actors handled the 3-way crossover opening night very well. We already watch the first two, so we could follow the casting, but for some, probably very confusing.\n\nStarring: Luke Kleintank, Heida Reed, Vinessa Videtto, Carter Redwood, Christiane Paul (up through SEASON 1), Eva-Jane Willis (starting SEASON 2).\n\nWe like it for SEASON 2\n\nF.B.I. CBS (returned 9/20/22 for SEASON 5)\n\nWe appreciate this, which fulfills its mandate: “a scripted drama about the inner workings of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”\n\nFirst Unit Director for this FBI branch was played by Connie Nielsen, then Sela Ward, now De La Garza: that role is not keeping its actors! Not much for them to do, we suspect.\n\nStars: Alana De La Garza (Forever), Jeremy Sisto, Missy Peregrym, Ebonee Noel, Zeeko Zaki, with Milena Govich (Law & Order) joining as a director/co-executive producer for SEASON 2.\n\nSEASON 3 was okay, and SEASON 4 started with the triple crossover, so, good. But we don’t like where they’re taking some of the main characters’ personalities. Hmmm…\n\nKeeping; okay for SEASON 5\n\nF.B.I.: Most Wanted CBS (returned 9/20/22 for SEASON 4)\n\nWe like this spinoff for F.B.I. that is “centered around the division of the FBI tasked with tracking and capturing the notorious criminals on the FBI’s Most Wanted list.”\n\nWritten by Dick Wolf and Rene Balcer (Law & Order, The Council) and directed by Fred Berner (Law & Order), this follows Wolf’s Chicago series’ franchise playbook.\n\nJulian McMahon (Marvel’s Runaways) played “Jess LaCroix, an ‘agent’s agent’ who’s at the top of his game and oversees the team from the FBI’s Most Wanted Unit, which is assigned the most extreme and egregious cases.” But, they killed him off in SEASON 3 and brought in Dylan McDermott, who is fine.\n\nAlso starring: Kellan Lutz (The Legend Of Hercules, The Expendables 3), Roxy Sternberg (Mars, Emerald City), Alana de la Garza (Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders) and the fabulous Keisha Castle-Hughes (Whale Rider, Game of Thrones)—all grown up, now—who plays “Lynn Khanna, a cowboy boot-wearing FBI analyst from a conservative Dallas family. She is a master of data-mining and social engineering with a sharp, earthy sense of humor. Lynn is tough, playful and young in years but an old soul at heart.”\n\nDe la Garza [is] “A.S.A.C. (Assistant Special Agent in Charge) Isobel Castile, Fugitive Squad Supervisor, polished and focused West Point graduate with a brief stint in Silicon Valley. She’s a rising star who shuns politics and is a guided missile in the field.” Miguel Gomez, another agent, leaves for SEASON 4 and Edwin Hodge replaces him.\n\nSternberg plays “FBI Agent Sheryll Barnes, an ex-NYPD detective with elevated street smarts.”\n\nLutz plays “FBI Agent Crosby—an Army intel vet Jess has taken under his wing, communications whiz.” Nathaniel Arcand (Cold Pursuit) did play “Agent Clinton Skye, Mohawk Nation, Jess’ brother-in-law, a marksman with a law degree” in SEASON 1, but was absent for SEASON 2 and not listed for SEASON 3. Why? We liked him in Heartland!\n\nThey have interesting plots and characters, but too many go off or are absent and we don’t know why.\n\nWe like it; okay for SEASON 4\n\nNCIS CBS (returned 9/19/22 for SEASON 20 [CROSSOVER with NCIS: Hawai’i])\n\nWe are fans of this show, but…if it weren’t for Mark Harmon…AND, SPOILER ALERT: he leaves during the early part of this SEASON (19)!!!\n\nEmily Wickersham (Ellie Bishop) left and won’t return for SEASON 19.\n\nAdded some good cast members, but lost too many others.\n\nStill starring: Sean Murray, Wilmer Valderrama, Brian Dietzen, Diona Reasonover, Rocky Carroll, and occasionally, David McCallum.\n\nNow starring, also: Gary Cole, Katrina Law.\n\nWe like this; okay for SEASON 20\n\nThe Resident FOX (returned 9/19/22 for SEASON 6)\n\nSPOILER ALERT: Emily van Camp wanted to leave, so they killed her character off in SEASON 5, early on. Sad.\n\nJane Leeves (Frasier) ‘s character is an orthopedic surgeon and friend for Bruce Greenwood‘s surgeon character (who has migrated from evil to somewhat good over the SEASONS…?) as they trade being CEOs.\n\nManish Dayal, Emily van Camp (Revenge, Everwood) and Matt Czuchry (The Good Wife and Gilmore Girls) star(red) in yet another medical drama series. How could we need any more of these? Yet, we LOVE this one!\n\n“This medical drama follows the relationship between a senior resident and a young doctor at a hospital.”\n\nStrong characters and interesting plots. We’re hooked!\n\nHOWEVER, the whiny twin is SO IRRITATING!\n\nKeeping; Okay for SEASON 6\n\n9-1-1 FOX (returned 9/19/22 for SEASON 6)\n\nSEASON 6 has some new characters and mostly returning ones, but odd stories. The subplot with Hen’s (Hinds) going to medical school FULL TIME while keeping her FT EMT job AND acting as station Captain for a week is STUPID and not credible. The other subplots offer too much SOAP OPERA and some aren’t even relevant (dead child under Bassett‘s character’s parents’ home? WHY?).\n\nAn Emergency Response drama created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk.\n\nStarring Angela Bassett and Peter Krause, with ZERO on-screen chemistry, but whose characters somehow got married.\n\nThe writers seem to be trying too hard to set up the most bizarre and objectionable characters and rescue situations as possible, but we are underwhelmed and not all that interested during and fast-forward through many scenarios.\n\nAlso starring: Oliver Stark, Aisha Hinds, Kenneth Choi, Corinne Massiah, Marcanthonee Reis, Jennifer Love Hewitt.\n\nKEEPING, but not great for SEASON 6\n\nChicago P.D. NBC (returned 9/21/22 for SEASON 10)\n\nContinually disappointed that so many ON THE FORCE are doing so many bad things. Finally causing untenable tension among the squad in SEASONS 9 – 10.\n\nStarring: Jason Beghe, Marina Squerciati, Jesse Lee Soffer, Patrick Fleuger, Laroyce Hawkins, Amy Morton, Tracy Spiridakos\n\nKEEPING; not great for SEASON 10\n\nChicago Fire NBC (returned 9/21/22 for SEASON 11)\n\nGood SEASON 11, so far, but why did most of the couples fail? We like these people.\n\nStarring: Jesse Spencer (not regular since SEASON 8), Taylor Kinney, Eamonn Walker, David Eigenberg, Joe Minoso, Kara Killmer, Yuriy Sardarov, Cristian Stolte, Miranda Rae Mayo; adding various each year and losing some.\n\nThey keep killing off the wrong characters!\n\nKEEPING; okay for SEASON 11\n\nChicago Med NBC (returned 9/21/22 for SEASON 8)\n\nTorrey DeVitto and Yaya DaCosta did not return for SEASON 7; their choice. BUT, DaCosta (whose new series was canceled) appeared in SEASON 8’s opener… Hmmm.\n\nNot liking Steven Weber‘s character at all.\n\nToo many love triangles. A bit too much soap opera-esque-ness in these nighttime medical shows: how do they have so much time on their hands?\n\nWe LOVE Oliver Platt, and the rest of the cast are good, with interesting (but largely implausible) stories.\n\nStarring: Molly Bernard, Colby Lewis, Nick Gehlfuss, Rachel DiPillo, Brian Tee, S. Epatha Merkerson, Marlyne Barrett; and, Steven Weber. NEW for SEASON 7, new doctors, Guy Lockard and Kristin Hager; also, as an intern, Asjha Cooper.\n\nKEEPING; good for SEASON 8\n\nNew Amsterdam NBC (returned 9/20/22 for final SEASON 5)\n\nWe like this show, but the main characters have sad lives!\n\nDear Writers: you do not have to provide an emergency every 2 minutes or kill key characters off to keep our attention. Please, as your character reminded the lead, SLOW DOWN! And, stop killing off characters we like!\n\n“Inspired by Bellevue, the oldest public hospital in America, this unique medical drama follows the brilliant and charming Dr. Max Goodwin, the institution’s newest medical director [Ryan Eggold, recently killed off in The Blacklist and star of its short-lived spinoff] who sets out to tear up the bureaucracy and provide exceptional care. How can he help? Well, the doctors and staff have heard this before. Not taking ‘no’ for an answer, Dr. Goodwin must disrupt the status quo and prove he will stop at nothing to breathe new life into this understaffed, underfunded and underappreciated hospital—the only one in the world capable of treating Ebola patients, prisoners from Rikers and the President of the United States under one roof—and return it to the glory that put it on the map.”\n\nAlso starring: Freema Agyeman, Janet Montgomery, Jocko Sims, Tyler Labine..\n\nWe wish it were more like Red Band Society and less like Bedlam.\n\nWe like it; okay for final SEASON 5\n\nThe Rookie ABC (returned 9/27/22 for SEASON 5)\n\nWe like this, and SEASON 5’s opener was upsetting, but great! But, Fillion is not still a “rookie” so…???\n\nSad to lose one of the main people (won’t say which one).\n\nOne of our favorite (but, of course, short-lived) shows, starring Hayley Atwell, was Conviction. Its co-creator is directing this new series! Liz Friedlander is also the Executive Producer of the ABC pilot of the crime dramedy, which stars one of our all-time favorite dramedy actors, Nathan Fillion (Firefly, Castle), as John Nolan, “the oldest newbie on the LAPD … inspired by a true story. Nolan “cast[s] aside his comfortable, small town life and move[s] to LA to pursue his dream of being a cop….[S]urrounded by rookies 20 years his junior, Nolan must navigate the dangerous, humorous, and unpredictable world of a ‘young’ cop, determined to make his second shot at life count.” We like this a lot.\n\nFillion plays a complicated, realistic, good-hearted, courageous, intelligent, unmacho middle-aged new cop, which is refreshing, with some others who are somewhat 2-D (so far), but whom we hope will expand as we go along.\n\nAlso starring: Alyssa Diaz as another TO-turned Detective, Michael Beach, as career LAPD, now Chief of Internal Affairs; Richard T. Jones (whom we always like) as the Captain; and Eric Winter (whom we also like) as another TO (training, then partnering, and perhaps romantic? with Melissa O’Neil); Mekia Cox was Fillion‘s TO; Shawn Ashmore was a Public Defender, now in the DA’s office, and married to Diaz for SEASON 5; Jenna Dewan as a firefighter/EMT and Fillion‘s GF.\n\nWe like it for SEASON 5\n\nD.C.’s Stargirl The CW (returned 8/31/22 for SEASON 3)\n\nWe liked SEASON 1 all right, but SEASON 2 was off to a confusing and rocky start, focusing on the newly created Justice Society of America teens group, yet not allowing them to do much, and including new villains without sufficient explanation. We kept up, but SEASON 3 is a disaster. Can’t continue.\n\n“It is based on the DC Comics superhero of the same name … [and] follows high school student, Courtney Whitmore, portrayed by Brec Bassinger, who discovers the ‘cosmic staff’ and becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes who become the Justice Society of America.” Expectedly cheesy, trite, many fights and special effects, but then, unexpected and welcomed humor and twists as well.\n\nAlso starring: Luke Wilson, as stepfather and former sidekick to NOT-dead Starman, Joel McHale, for SEASON 3; Amy Smart, as his new wife, mother to Stargirl.\n\nWatchable but worse each SEASON, and awful for SEASON 3\n\nLeonardo The CW (premiered 8/16/22)\n\nThis series looked interesting but is very SLOW, with a great cast and production team. It “explores the secrets and drama behind the genius of Leonardo da Vinci (Aidan Turner, Poldark, The Hobbit) – his life, his work and his personal struggles set against the backdrop of Renaissance Italy. The eight-part series follows da Vinci as he grows into an unparalleled genius and renowned polymath whose work overturned the established order. His restless curiosity flitted between arts, science and technology, driven by a profound quest for knowledge and determined to unfold the mysteries of the world around him. The series unlocks the enigma of this extraordinary man, through an untold story of mystery and passion.\n\n“Created by Frank Spotnitz (The X-Files, The Man in the High Castle, Medici) and Steve Thompson (Sherlock, Doctor Who) and directed by Dan Percival (The Man in the High Castle, Death Comes To Pemberley) and Alexis Sweet (Don Matteo, Back to the Island)…. [and] executive produced by Luca Bernabei, Daniele Passani, Sara Melodia and Luisa Cotta Ramosino,… Frank Spotnitz and Emily Feller,…Freddie Highmore…and Brendan Fitzgerald…”\n\nStarring: Matilda de Angelis (The Undoing) as Caterina da Cremona, Freddie Highmore (The Good Doctor, Bates Motel) as Stefano Giraldi, Giancarlo Giannini (Seven Beauties, Quantum of Solace) as Andrea del Verrocchio, Carlos Cuevas (Someone Has To Die) as Salaì, Alessandro Sperduti (Paul, Apostle of Christ) as Tommaso Masini, James D’Arcy (Avengers: Endgame) as Ludovico Sforza, Robin Renucci (Dolce Fine Giornata) as Piero da Vinci, Hugo Becker (Gossip Girl) as Thierry, Miriam Dalmazio (Anna) as Beatrice D’Este and Max Bennet (Bohemian Rhapsody) as Cesare Borgia.\n\nWatched one Episode and can’t seem to go back\n\nMonarch Fox (premiered 9/12/22; deservedly CANCELED)\n\nGreat cast and okay premise, created by one of the same people (Michael Rauch) who did Instinct and Royal Pains, which we liked, so it could have been good…. It wasn’t. Bait-and-switch, with Susan Sarandon (no spoiler, here): don’t count on her appearances.\n\nOnly good part: “The series will feature original music and covers.” Not enough singing and almost not entire songs in Episodes 1, 2 or 3, which was the problem with Nashville, after its first two SEASONS. This one starts out mostly music-less. We’ll give it a few more Episodes, but NONE of the characters is likable! NOT ENOUGH MUSIC! STUPID SUBPLOTS! Deservedly CANCELED!\n\nStarring: Susan Sarandon (sort of) (Thelma & Louise, Dead Man Walking, Feud, Rocky Horror Picture Show) and Anna Friel (Pushing Daisies, Books of Blood, The Girlfriend Experience).\n\n“Monarch is a Texas-sized, multi-generational musical drama about America’s first family of country music….The Romans are headed by the insanely talented, but tough as nails Queen of Country Music, DOTTIE CANTRELL ROMAN (Sarandon). Along with her beloved husband, Albie, Dottie has created a country music dynasty. But even though the Roman name is synonymous with authenticity, the very foundation of their success is a lie. And when their reign as country royalty is put in jeopardy, heir to the crown NICOLETTE ‘NICKY’ ROMAN (Friel) will stop at nothing to protect her family’s legacy, while ensuring her own quest for stardom.”\n\nNot optimistic; gets worse Episode by Episode; deservedly CANCELED\n\n*Under the Vines Acorn (6 Episodes miniseries; premiered 12/6/21; RENEWED for SEASON 2; we wait for DVDs)\n\nVERY low expectations for this, but we tried it. Mom fell asleep in a few minutes! WHY this obsession with Wine Country settings suddenly? Wildfires? Sheesh.\n\nAt least this one is in New Zealand! “Rebecca Gibney (Wanted, Packed to the Rafters, Halifax: Retribution) and Charles Edwards (The Crown, The Terror, Downton Abbey) star as two unlikely city slickers who inherit a failing vineyard in rural New Zealand. Sydney socialite Daisy Munroe (Gibney) heads to Peak View, New Zealand for a vacation at her recently deceased stepfather’s winery, which she intends to sell. Little does she know that the vineyard has a co-owner, grumpy UK-born lawyer, Louis Oakley (Edwards), who also travels to the wine region to escape a spiraling series of unfortunate events in his life. Despite neither having done a hard days’ work in their lives and both despising each other, the two must somehow make Oakley Winery successful so they can sell up, split up and get out.”\n\nAlso starring: Dean O’Gorman (One Lane Bridge, The Hobbit trilogy), Sara Wiseman (A Place to Call Home), John Bach (The Sounds, Janet King), Matt Whelan (The Sounds), Simon Mead (Nothing Trivial), Sarah Peirse (Poor Boy), Cohen Holloway (Top of the Lake), Carrie Green (Mystic), Catherine Wilkin (Stateless), Robbie Magasiva (Wentworth) and Trae Te Wiki.\n\nTrailer: https://www.renewcanceltv.com/amc-announces-new-drama-series-under-the-vines-premiere-date-official-trailer/?utm_source=newsletter-327&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=WeeklyRCTV\n\nStarring:\n\nWe were bored; RENEWED for SEASON 2\n\nVirgin River Netflix (released 7/20/22 for SEASON 4; RENEWED for SEASON 5)\n\nAny contemporary romance lovers and/or Robyn Carr readers out here? We sometimes like her novels, and Virgin River has a stellar cast—Alexandra Breckenridge (This Is Us, The Walking Dead), Martin Henderson (Grey’s Anatomy, Miracles From Heaven), Tim Matheson (The Affair, The Good Fight) and Annette O’Toole (Smallville, Marvel’s The Punisher) —that is based on twenty of Carr’s novels, all set in one small town (a common author-of-romances ploy). So far, we like it and will continue (watched 2 Episodes)\n\nSEASON 4 opened right where SEASON 3 left off, which we like. Still liking this. But, the subplot about Hope’s (Annette O’Toole) TBI, with its fatigue and selective amnesia, are uncomfortably familiar, for me.\n\nSEASON 3 was good, but two simultaneous Baby Mamas for Jack are a bit much, especially when he isn’t going to get to raise his first, due to Charmaine’s and her new husband’s obstinacy, and Mel’s might not be “his.” Some great surprises in SEASON 4’s ending, too.\n\nSEASONS 2 & 3 were a bit darker than SEASON 1, but we still like it a lot.\n\n“Melinda Monroe (Breckenridge)…answers an ad to work as a nurse practitioner in the remote California town of Virgin River. Desperate to move on from her painful past, she’s left everything behind in Los Angeles, thinking it will be the perfect place to start fresh and leave her painful memories behind. But she soon discovers that small-town living isn’t quite as simple as she expected and that she must learn to heal herself before she can truly make Virgin River her home. Henderson plays Jack Sheridan, a sharp-witted ex-Marine commander, who moved to Virgin River after his service was over in search of a peaceful life, far away from the horrors of war. Matheson portrays Doc Mullins. Set in his ways and a bit of a curmudgeon, he’s not keen on working with anyone including Mel, who he views as a challenge to his authority. O’Toole is Hope McCrea, Virgin River’s brash and blunt mayor—a little rough around the edges, but her saving grace is her love for the town and her mission to preserve it….[Also features] Jenny Cooper (Grey’s Anatomy) as Joey Barnes, Mel’s charming older sister, adviser, trusted confidante, and best friend; David Cubitt (Siren) as Calvin, the unquestioned leader of the largest of the many illegal pot fields that litter the landscape around Virgin River; Lexa Doig (Arrow) as Paige Lassiter, a local entrepreneur, and an illustrious baker with a warm smile who has secrets of her own; Daniel Gillies (The Originals) as Mark: Mel’s first love, strikingly handsome and accomplished, a surgeon in the Los Angeles ER where Mel worked; Lauren Hammersley (Orphan Black) as Charmaine Roberts, an attractive hair stylist from nearby Clear River, and competition for Jack’s attention; Benjamin Hollingsworth (Code Black) as Dan Brady, another former Marine under Jack’s command, Brady differs from Preacher in almost every way; Colin Lawrence (Riverdale) as John “Preacher” Middleton, Jack’s best friend, the two men served in the military together, and Ian Tracey (Bates Motel) as Jimmy, Calvin’s lieutenant and enforcer, anyone unfortunate enough to incur Calvin’s wrath is inevitably forced to deal with Jimmy.”\n\nIf you like evening soap operas, you’ll love this! Glad it was renewed.\n\nWe like it; Good for SEASON 4; RENEWED for SEASON 5\n\nThe Good Fight CBS Access (DVDs for 5 SEASONS; RENEWED for final SEASON 6)\n\nWe loved The Good Wife and were sad that this new spinoff was pay-per-view for a few years. Delighted to find the DVDs at our local library! LOVED SEASONS 1, 2, 3, but SEASON 4 started out AWFUL. Got better, but not by much. SEASON 5 was back to its original great writing and situations, and we liked most of it a lot.\n\nReturning/continuing are: Cush Jumbo (through SEASON 5 Episode 1, only), Christine Baranski, Gary Cole, and some others who pop up occasionally, notably, Carrie Preston, Sarah Steele, Matthew Perry, Bernadette Peters, Wanda Sykes, Michael J. Fox, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Paul Guilfoyle, Justin Bartha, Delroy Lindo, Rose Leslie, Erica Tazel, Nyambi Nyambi, Louis Gossett, Jr., Michael Sheen, Wayne Brady, and so many more greats who are regulars or guest/recurring stars, adding the wonderful Audra MacDonald in SEASON 2 for the rest of the series.\n\nThe writing and directing are stellar (but not consistently done by the same people).\n\nAdded the wonderful Audra MacDonald for the rest of the series.\n\nThe cartoon info sections are amazing and fun. The timeliness of various plotlines and characters is eerie.\n\nThis was fabulous, but uneven; RENEWED for final SEASON 6, then CANCELED\n\nQueens of Mystery Acorn TV (DVDs, for us, in 2020/22; better for SEASON 2; releases late in 2023 for SEASON 3)\n\nWe are somewhat disappointed by this series. We watched all of SEASON 1 and were mostly bored, but SEASON 2 was slightly better, even with one of the leads recast and too many WIGS. Had some great graphics and some good acting (the narration is a bit heavy-handed and some characters are stereotypes), but the stories can be silly to the point of dull.\n\nThis network offers MANY great shows, including this: an original six-part female detective series, created by writer, Julian Unthank (New Tricks and Doc Martin), starring Olivia Vinall (The Woman in White) for SEASON 1 and Florence Hall for SEASON 2, co-starring Julie Graham (The Bletchley Circle) and Sarah Woodward (The Politician’s Husband), featuring Siobhan Redmond (Alfresco), Andrew Leung (Doctor Who), Rebecca Grant (Holby City) and Martin Trenaman (The Inbetweeners).\n\n“Queens of Mystery follows Matilda Stone, played by Vinalli Hall], a perennially single female detective and her three aunts, played by Graham, Woodward and Redmond, who are well-known crime writers that help her solve whodunit style murders as well as set her up on blind dates. Leung plays the dashing Dr. Daniel Lynch, Grant as Daniel’s mean-spirited girlfriend, Natasha; Michael Elcock as Police Constable Terry Foster, who has long been in love with Matilda, and Trenaman plays dry Inspector Derek Throne. The Amelie-esque contemporary murder mystery series will feature quirky characters, fast-paced dialogue and darkly comic murders.”\n\nSEASONS 1 & 2 are on DVD & on Amazon.\n\nWe watch on DVD; okay for first 2 SEASONS; RENEWED for SEASON 3\n\nSweet Magnolias Netflix (returned 2/4/22 for SEASON 2, but too saccharine)\n\nSmall town life, female friendships, non-violent and romantic plots, from author, Sheryl Woods: what’s not to like? SEASON 2 has started too trite and sweet for us, though. Brooke Elliot (from Drop Dead Diva) and JoAnna Garcia Swisher (Reba, Kevin Saves the World) and Heather Headley (Chicago Med) are going to co-star, with romances abounding for each.\n\nWe liked this a lot; but, too saccharine for SEASON 2\n\n*Unorthodox Netflix (3/26/20, released 4 Episodes [Parts] as SEASON 1; RENEWED for SEASON 2, perhaps releasing 2023)\n\n“Born and raised in a New York Hasidic community, Esty feels tormented after a fruitless first year of marriage; she runs away to Berlin and finds new freedom.” Adapted from Deborah Feldman’s 2012 nonfiction memoir: Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots .\n\nMostly good, but many characters are 2- dimensional and stereotypical, which was disappointing. Jumping around in the timeline was handled better than most, but it’s trite. Acting by leads is excellent, and the plot twists are interesting. Overall, sad and scary depiction of a religious cult, its lies and oppressiveness, especially towards women, and the awful hypocrisy of its own rules, with two (maybe 3) escapees.\n\nBecause it’s in German, Yiddish and English, with some Hebrew, has many subtitles.\n\nStarring: Shira Haas, who is AMAZING! With Amit Rahav, Aaron Altaras, Jeff Wilbusch, Alex Reid and more.\n\nVery disturbing and well-done, both; RENEWED for SEASON 2\n\nEndeavor BBC/PBS Masterpiece/Amazon Prime (returned 6/10/22 for 3-Episodes-only SEASON VIII; RENEWED for SEASON final IX)\n\nWe really like this show, but SEASON VIII is kind of dark for our hero: lots of drinking and grumpiness! A ’60’s era British detective/crime-solving series that my mom and I have been enjoying on Amazon Prime and plan to finish by watching recordings from PBS.\n\nWe have watched all of SEASONS I through VII, now (8/16/20) and, except for the vocal music (‘way too much opera and classical /religious choral music for my taste, which wants NONE of that), believe this is one of the best series of its type around. Barrington Pheloung writes the other music, which is beautiful (and not vocal).\n\nApparently, a closely-guarded secret from his peers and friends is Detective Morse’s first name, which is “Endeavor.”\n\nThis series is a prequel to the beloved (but one we haven’t watched, yet) Inspector Morse series; both are set primarily in Oxford, England. SEASON 8 will fall somewhere around 1971 or 1972, roughly 15 years away from the original Inspector Morse’s 1987 beginnings.\n\nStarring Shaun Evans as young Endeavour Morse, who is beginning his career as a Detective Constable with the Oxford City Police CID, the series has a great supporting and co-starring cast, including Roger Allam, Anton Lesser, Jack Lasky and Sean Rigby on the police force, with recurring roles/frequent appearances by Caroline O’Neill, Sara Vickers, Abigail Thaw and Shvorne Marks. Pilot episode aired in 2012. SEASON 6 will appear in mid-2019.\n\nEnjoy this a lot; KEEPING and watched; RENEWED through SEASON 9\n\nDark Winds AMC (premiered 6/12/22; RENEWED for SEASON 2 and returns summer/fall 2023); RENEWED)\n\n“Zahn McClarnon and Kiowa Gordon star in a series adaptation of Tony Hillerman‘s Leaphorn & Chee book series, set in the Navajo Nation in 1971.”\n\nVery implausible and quite dated, but well-done.\n\nWe kind of like it; RENEWED for SEASON 2\n\n*The Old Man FX (premiered 6/16/22)\n\n“A seven-episode adaptation of Thomas Perry‘s novel of the same name, The Old Man finds Jeff Bridges returning to a regular TV role for the first time since the early 1960s. He plays Dan Chase, a former CIA agent (played in flashbacks by Bill Heck) who is now living off the grid. But when he is the target of a failed assassination attempt, he finds that he can no longer escape his past. Other old men, John Lithgow and Joel Grey, also star, as do Alia Shawkat, Gbenga Akinnagbe, Amy Brenneman, and E.J. Bonilla.”\n\nGreat cast, but it’s all too dark and impossible for my mom to see!\n\nGreat twist to end SEASON 2\n\nSo far, interesting\n\nTransplant CTV/NBC (good for SEASON 2; RENEWED for SEASON 3)\n\nPremiered 2/26/20 on CTV, it “centers on Dr. Bashir “Bash” Hamed, a Syrian doctor with battle-tested skills in emergency medicine who fled his country with his younger sister, Amira. Together they struggle to build a new life in Canada as Bash strives to rebuild his career in medicine.”\n\nStars: Hamza Haq (Quantico), Laurence Leboeuf (The Disappearance), John Hannah (Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), Jim Watson (Mary Kills People) and Ayisha Issa (Polar).\n\nThis focuses on plot/medicine and not so much romance, so far, which is amazing! We generally like Canadian series, and we like this one.\n\nWe liked it for SEASON 2\n\nBorgen Netflix (SEASONS 1 – 4 available NOW; FINAL SEASON 4, “Power & Glory,” released 6/2/22)\n\nWe liked this a LOT! It’s dubbed (Danish – English), but not badly. Only written items have subtitles.\n\n“Borgen is a Danish political drama series …[I]ts depiction of government is in stark contrast to our current, gloomy reality….From 2010, starring Sidse Babett Knudsen and Birgitte Hjort Sørensen and is written by Adam Price ….The first season launched in 2010, the second season in 2011 and the third season was launched in 2013….Prime Minister Birgitte Nyborg [Knudsen] wins a shocking victory and ushers in a wave of political struggles….(Borgen, which means castle, is what the Danes call their parliament.)….Borgen is more than intricate political drama, though: it is intimate drama, politics made human. It is about democracy and people: relationships between people, the relationship between work and home (especially interesting at the moment). It is about journalism, women, values, having children, not having children. It is about you and me. Nyborg …is a fabulous character: strong, ambitious, confident, but also genuine and honest. She has a three-dimensional home life, a hot husband and she rides a bicycle—of course.”\n\nWish they’d given more explanation about the time jump and intervening years between SEASONS 3 & 4, though. Kind of confusing, at first, but gets better.\n\nGot an unexpected 4th SEASON, Power & Glory, June, 2022! (Maybe because it won lots of awards.)\n\nWe like it; great for final SEASON 4\n\n*Working Moms Netflix (6 SEASONS released Jan, 2017- May, 2022; RENEWED for SEASON 7)\n\n“Warm, loyal PR executive, Kate and her longtime friend, no-nonsense psychiatrist, Anne, attend a judgmental mommies’ group, where they meet timid IT tech, Jenny, and blindly optimistic real estate agent, Frankie. The four quickly form an unlikely friendship, sharing struggles of urban motherhood filled with the chaos of toddlers, tantrums, careers, and identity crises, all while trying to achieve the holy grail: a sense of self. The ensemble comedy is largely drawn from the personal experiences of star/co-creator Catherine Reitman (Blackish, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia).”\n\nAlso starring: Jessalyn Wanlim, Dani Kind, Enuka Okuma, and Juno Rinaldi.\n\nBased in Toronto and Calgary, it’s funny, sad, astonishing, weird, shocking, and fascinating.\n\nIt grows on me; RENEWED for SEASON 7\n\nThe Lincoln Lawyer Netflix (SEASON 1 released 5/13/22; RENEWED for SEASON 2, Spring, 2023)\n\n“Sidelined after an accident, hotshot Los Angeles lawyer, Mickey Haller, restarts his career—and his trademark Lincoln—when he takes on a murder case. When his former law partner is killed, Mickey Haller is left to take over the firm, including a high-profile murder trial. With the biggest case he’s ever had to tackle out of the back seat of his Lincoln Town Car, Mickey discovers there may be more at stake than he thought. Based on the bestselling novels by Michael Connelly…” Created for TV by the great David E. Kelley!\n\nWe liked the film and Kelley makes great a series, usually. Some great cast members are in it whom we already know.\n\nThis is very good and getting better with each Episode.\n\nTrailer here: https://www.renewcanceltv.com/netflix-announces-new-series-the-lincoln-lawyer-premiere-date-official-trailer/\n\nStarring: Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Neve Campbell, Becki Newton, Angus Sampson, Jazz Raycole, Christopher Gorham, Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine, Krista Warner, Jamie McShane, Michael Graziadei, LisaGay Hamilton, Reggie Lee.\n\nWe like it; RENEWED for SEASON 2\n\nPieces of Her Netflix (8 Episodes miniseries; available winter, 2022)\n\n“Based on Karin Slaughter‘s 2018 novel, Pieces of Her is an eight-part series adaptation about a mother-daughter relationship and the secrets we keep from those closest to us. Pieces of Her follows 30-year-old Andy Oliver (played by Bella Heathcote), who finds herself caught in a deadly mass shooting in a local diner.”\n\nWe are both longtime Slaughter fans and appreciated this adaptation a lot. Toni Collette is amazing, and each of the actors plays well-developed characters very well. The jumping around in the timelines is a bit jarring, but the casting of the younger/older versions of the same characters is perfect.\n\nAlso starring: Omari Hardwick, David Wenham, Jacob Scipio, Jessica Barden, Joe Dempsie.\n\nWe were captivated\n\n*The Woman Across the Street from the Girl in the Window Netflix (SEASON 1 available winter, 2022; SEASON 2 limbo)\n\n“Mixing wine, pills, casseroles and an overactive imagination, Anna obsesses over a hunky neighbor across the street and witnesses a murder. Or did she?”\n\nAnna has suffered an unspeakable tragedy and isn’t coping well 3 years later. Then, more shit happens. Kristen Bell is wonderful, as are the others. Great plot twists.\n\nAlso starring: Tom Riley, Mary Holland, Cameron Britton, Samsara Leela Yett, Michael Ealy.\n\nThis was intriguing\n\n*Sanditon PBS (returned 3/20/22; RENEWED for SEASON 3; CANCELED for SEASON 4)\n\n“Based on Jane Austen’s final, unfinished novel and developed by…writer, Andrew Davies, …the drama will continue to follow the high-spirited and independent heroine, Charlotte Heywood (Rose Williams, Curfew) as she returns to the picturesque coastal resort of Sanditon. Charlotte’s journey is one thread of an intricate tapestry of compelling stories full of intrigue, excitement, and romance. Against the backdrop of beautiful vistas, familiar faces return and new inhabitants are introduced – all of whom will be having adventures as joyous and surprising as the seaside town itself.”\n\nThe pace is maddingly slow, and even worse for SEASON 2. Typical Austen, IMO. I watch, but not carefully.\n\nJustin Young (Death in Paradise, Ripper Street) and Davies, who originally created the series, will share writing duties for SEASONS 2 & 3.\n\nI like it somewhat; not for Mom; RENEWED for SEASON 3; CANCELED for SEASON 4\n\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds Paramount+ First Episode free on Youtube/ DVDs for us after that (premiered 5/5/22; RENEWED for SEASON 2)\n\nAnson Mount reprises his role from other parts of this franchise as an early Captain Pike. Great casting for younger versions of Spock (Ethan Peck), Uhura (Celia Rose Gooding), and other crew, including James T. Kirk’s father and a young James himself in SEASON 2, with great additions (a dark-haired Rebecca Romijn, as Number One, among others)!\n\nWe love this!\n\nStar Trek: Picard Paramount+ / DVDs for us (has 2 SEASONS out, one on DVD as of 4/1/22; RENEWED for final SEASON 3)\n\nPatrick Stewart is joined by Jeri Ryan, Michelle Hurd and Alison Pill along with Santiago Cabrero (playing multiple roles) and many oldies and goodies from TNG who randomly or frequently appear in a great new addition to the Star Trek universes(s). We love this!\n\nWe love this!\n\n*Abbott Elementary ABC (returned 9/21/22 for SEASON 2)\n\nThis series is billed as a “workplace comedy” in which “a group of dedicated, passionate teachers—and a slightly tone-deaf principal—are brought together in a Philadelphia public school where, despite the odds stacked against them, they are determined to help their students succeed in life. Though these incredible public servants may be outnumbered and underfunded, they love what they do—even if they don’t love the school district’s less-than-stellar attitude toward educating children.”\n\nSurprisingly good, even if sometimes trite and/or stereotyped. As a former elementary teacher and trainer of the same, I find many aspects ring true. Fun to watch; not fun to live or work there!\n\nStarring: Quinta Brunson (who also serves as creator, co-writer and co-executive producer) as Janine Teagues, Tyler James Williams as Gregory Eddie, Janelle James as Ava Coleman, Chris Perfetti as Jacob Hill, Lisa Ann Walter as Melissa Schemmenti and Sheryl Lee Ralph as Barbara Howard.\n\nSurprisingly good\n\n*Sex Education Netflix (3 SEASONS released by winter, 2022; RENEWED for SEASON 4)\n\nKudos to the writers (Laurie Nunn, Freddy Syborn, Laura Neal, Mawaan Rizwan, Sophie Goodhart, Bisha K. Ali, Laura Hunter) and actors (see below) for depicting adolescent and adult sexual and emotional connections of many types, separately and together, while conveying accurate information in entertaining ways.\n\nIt begins with this logline: “Insecure Otis has all the answers when it comes to sex advice, thanks to his therapist mom,” but goes way beyond that by SEASON 3. Fuller description, here: “Socially awkward high school student, Otis [Asa Butterfield], may not have much experience in the lovemaking department, but he gets good guidance on the topic in his personal sex ed course — living with mom, Jean [Gillian Anderson], who is a sex therapist. Being surrounded by manuals, videos and tediously open conversations about sex, Otis has become a reluctant expert on the subject. When his classmates learn about his home life, Otis decides to use his insider knowledge to improve his status at school, so he teams with whip-smart bad girl Maeve to set up an underground sex therapy clinic to deal with their classmates’ problems. But through his analysis of teenage sexuality, Otis realizes that he may need some therapy of his own.”\n\nWith excellent performances by: Asa Butterfield, Aimee Lou Wood, Gillian Anderson, Ncuti Gatwa, Mimi Keene, Emma Mackey, Connor Swindells, Kedar Williams-Stirling, Alistair Petrie, Tanya Reynolds, Patricia Allison, Mikael Persbrandt, and many more; plus, great costumes and sets. This unique series deserves every nomination and award it’s been receiving.\n\nA few complaints (from this writer, teacher, parent, former sex educator, therapist and group worker with adolescents): 1) Because the scenes are so explicit and have so many semi-nude and sexually graphic bits, no school can use it for the wonderful information it offers. 2) Because it’s on a paid streaming service only (Netflix), some won’t ever see it who most need to see it. 3) Almost all the “teen” actors are actually in their young adult years; some are over 25 by SEASON 3! I understand that it’s hard to have actual teens (and perhaps not even legal to use them) in these kinds of shows, but 20-somethings do not play as teens so well. Really. They do not. Watch Glee. 4) There are more scenes and storylines devoted to the bizarre, the fetishists, homosexuals, pansexuals, role-playing, and some very unhealthy relationships than more ordinary and/or healthy ones, which may give many the impression that these relationships do not exist any more in high schools. But, watch any other teen-based show for those, right? 5) With such a large cast and so many subplots, it’s hard to keep it all straight and, worse, some of the actors look alike.\n\nOverall, a hugely diverse cast and important plot and character situations make this very compelling and interesting.\n\nAmazingly honest, accurate and explicit\n\nThe Blacklist NBC (RENEWED for SEASON 10)\n\nUnnecessarily confusing, too many double-ad triple-crosses. Too dark to see much. Not liking it much.\n\nThe new relationship between Lizzie and Reddington /not-Reddington is intriguing, though, and we like the nuances and mysteries. Great performances by all.\n\nPlot for SEASON 8 sucks, though, and can’t imagine why it was renewed. SEASON 8 jumps ahead a few years, then keep backtracking. Very confusing. Not liking it.\n\nWe miss Megan Booth.\n\nStarring: James Spader, Diego Klattenhoff, Amir Arison, Hisham Tawfiq, Laura Sohn, and Harry Lennix.\n\nNot great for SEASON 9; RENEWED\n\nThe Equalizer CBS (returned 10/2/22 for SEASON 3)\n\nWe only saw the original films, starring Denzel Washington, so this is not a reboot, for us. Sounded and IS interesting, though, and we like Queen Latifah, who stars.\n\n“A reimagining of the classic series in which an enigmatic figure uses her extensive skills to help those with nowhere else to turn.”\n\nWe like this a lot, because it guarantees a happy outcome for every Episode! Great chemistry among the main cast, also.\n\nAlso starring: Lorraine Touissant, Adam Goldberg, Chris Noth (AXED for #MeToo!), Liza Lapira, Tory Kittles.\n\nWe like this a lot; good for SEASON 3\n\n*When Calls the Heart Hallmark (look for it spring, 2023; RENEWED for SEASON 10)\n\nErin Krakow is good as the lead character, Elizabeth Thatcher, a rich young woman who left her safe, city family life to become a Canadian prairie teacher in a one-room school house. Yes; hers is one of my alternate reality jobs.\n\nBut, they have become more of a love-triangle/soap opera since they killed off the adorable Daniel Lessing as her Canadian Mountie/ love interest/now husband (SEASON 5).\n\nChris McNally (Supernatural) and Kevin McGarry (Heartland) joined as the two vying for Elizabeth’s affections in SEASON 6: McNally is Lucas Bouchard, “a charming gambler and saloon owner who is hiding more than a card up his sleeve.” McGarry is Nathan Grant, “the epitome of the strong, silent type and takes all his responsibilities to heart as the new Mountie in town.”\n\nLori Loughlin was justifiably AXED due to her indictments for criminal behaviors (March, 2019).\n\nOther characters are also “stock” and mostly two-dimensional, but I blame the Hallmark Channel‘s writers (Janette Oke and Derek Thompson, most recently, but there are 18+!) more than I fault the actors.\n\nAlso has Chelah Horsdal and many others from the Hallmark stock character stables.\n\nThe show is very sappy, predictable, silly and overly sentimental, with many stereotypes and tropes, but I still watch.\n\nSPOILER ALERT: Elizabeth is widowed while pregnant (of course, since the film of the same name stars the character who is Elizabeth and Jack’s granddaughter).\n\nOkay for SEASON 8; sappier than ever for SEASON 9\n\n*Resident Alien Syfy (returned 1/26/22 for first half of SEASON 2; resumed 8/10/22)\n\nThis was disappointing, at first, and Mom didn’t continue after Episode 1. It seemed to be a one-note premise, and I wasn’t seeing where they can actually go from the first Episode, but I continued and have been pleasantly surprised. I watched the entire SEASON! Glad it was renewed. SEASON 2 has been great.\n\nStarring Rogue One and Firefly’s Alan Tudyk, with Sara Tomko (Once Upon A Time), Corey Reynolds (The Closer), Alice Wetterlund (People of Earth) and Levi Fiehler (Mars), based on the comics series by Peter Hogan and Steve Parkhouse. It is “a dark, twisted and comedic fish-out-of-water story. Adapted for television by Chris Sheridan (Family Guy), it follows a crash-landed alien named Harry (Tudyk) who, after taking on the identity of a small-town Colorado doctor, slowly begins to wrestle with the moral dilemma of his secret mission on Earth— ultimately asking the question, ‘Are human beings worth saving?’ David Dobkin (The Judge) executive produced and directed the pilot.”\n\nSurprisingly engaging; great for SEASON 2\n\n*Upload AZ Prime (2 SEASONS released, so far: May, 2020 & 3/11/22; RENEWED for SEASON 3)\n\n“A man is able to choose his own afterlife after his untimely death” is the logline for this sci=fi comedy romance by Greg Daniels (The Office, Space Force, King of the Hill, Parks & Recreation). It grows on you; believe me. The premise is this: “In the near future, you can have your consciousness uploaded to a digital afterlife after you die.”\n\nOf course, many shenanigans and problems ensue, raising key issues of how much stock we put into our outward appearances, classism affecting us even after death, and other serious issues strewn artfully among the laughs..\n\nStarring: Robbie Amell, Andy Allo, Allegra Edwards, William B. Davis and Jessica Tuck among many other fine performers\n\nI like this a lot; RENEWED for SEASON 3\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel Amazon Prime (2/22/22 and subsequent Fridays for 2 Episodes each, returned for SEASON 4; RENEWED for final SEASON 5)\n\nSpecial video, “Music of Mrs. Maisel,” released during June, 2020, of coronavirus pandemic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z036fil8ang&feature=youtu.be\n\nSEASON 4 has a weird roll-out (see above), and the scripts are very uneven. Not liking them much.\n\nWe liked SEASON 3 all right, but the Episodes written by the husband of the husband-wife writing team of Daniel and Amy Sherman-Palladino are not as good as hers….\n\nSEASON 2 was great. SEASONS 1 & 2 won Golden Globes and other awards.\n\nThis is an unsurprisingly delightful (coming from Daniel and Amy Sherman-Palladino of The Gilmore Girls, among other shows of theirs that I like) period piece, circa 1962 (Lenny Bruce’s stand-up era) that features a kick-ass, funny, smart, young Jewish wife & mother who accidentally becomes a stand-up com"
