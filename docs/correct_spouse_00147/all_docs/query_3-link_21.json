        "text": "Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire 84-year-old News Corp. mogul, made headlines this week, as he’s accustomed to doing, for his engagement to 59-year-old former model and rock-star wife Jerry Hall. This will be Murdoch’s fourth march to the altar, Hall’s second.\n\nNews that the executive popped the question [after a mere four-month courtship] (http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/rupert-murdoch-and-jerry-hall-are-engaged) set off a Rube Goldberg-like chain of dropping jaws and exclamations. No one saw it coming. It happened so quickly, almost without warning. The age difference—a cool 25 years—furrowed some eyebrows. That Murdoch and rock legend Mick Jagger, Hall’s ex-lover and father of her four children, would wed the same woman is a fact some simply cannot digest. And that the duo announced their engagement in a classified ad in a Murdoch-owned newspaper, well, that was the aptly strange cherry on top.\n\nThe biggest question the coupling left in its wake was why Murdoch, no stranger to a punishing, public divorce, would choose to marry again. The man, worth more than $11 billion, is 84. Surely, he could enjoy his twilight years, his successes, and riches in the company of a female, or several females, without having to go through the rigmarole of a legal partnership. But to say that would discount the fact that Rupert Murdoch is perhaps the greatest romantic of our time. It’s a conclusion easy to draw from any examination of his love life past. The man just loves love.\n\nWith the exception of just about three years between and after his divorces, Murdoch has been married since 1956. That’s 60 years of combined matrimony. He’s been married since before Alaska and Hawaii were considered part of the union, through 11 U.S. presidents. Murdoch’s first three marriages lasted 11 years, 31 years, and 14 years, respectively. The average length of a marriage that ends in divorce in the United States is just over eight years.\n\nMurdoch wed his first wife, Patricia Booker, in 1956, when he was just 25 years old. Booker, a beautiful blonde former department-store model and airline hostess, gave birth to Murdoch’s eldest child, __Prudence, two years later. Though Murdoch’s mother, Dame Elisabeth Murdoch reportedly regarded Booker as “less than” she should have been, the two remained married for 11 years, though their love ended in divorce. Mothers always know best.\n\nBut Murdoch’s failed first attempt didn’t ding his hope in the institution. In fact, he wed again just about a year later, this time to Anna Torv, to whom he remained married until 1999. In a dishy 2001 magazine interview with Australia Women’s Weekly, the former Mrs. Murdoch revealed how the two met and fell in love. She was working her way up at the Murdoch-owned Daily Mirror in Sydney when she decided she wanted to interview her boss, whom she found quite handsome. “He was like a whirlwind coming into the room. It was very seductive,” she told the Weekly. The article also reports that Murdoch himself spoke of their meeting, saying, “I thought she was a very pretty girl. Her writing skills were not going through my mind.” The rest, they say, is history. The two had three children together, she published several novels through Murdoch’s publishing companies, and sailed through three decades as a highly public couple. By the late 1990s, Anna said she wanted her husband to slow down, enjoy their 155-foot yacht, and take time for the two of them to enjoy one another and their growing family. Rupert, she said, was not interested.\n\nThe two separated in 1998, around the time that Murdoch started to be seen with Wendi Deng, who interned for him him at the News Corp.-owned Star TV in Hong Kong, where she reportedly traveled with Murdoch throughout Asia serving as a translator. After one of their trips, Murdoch informed one of his employees that Deng would not be returning to work at Star TV.\n\n“I don’t want to get too personal about all this, but [he] was extremely hard, ruthless, and determined that he was going to go through with this no matter what I wanted or what I was trying to do to save the marriage,” Anna told the Weekly. “Perhaps I was in love with the idea of still being in love with him. But the Rupert I fell in love with could not have behaved this way.”\n\nThe two announced their separation in a gossip column in the News Corp.-owned New York Post. “I think that Rupert's affair with Wendi Deng—it's not an original plot—was the end of the marriage,” she said.\n\nAnna, who was entitled to half of Murdoch’s wealth and a fair share of his many properties, walked away with far less than she was entitled to in order to have a fresh start (she married a wealthy financier just four months after the divorce; the Weekly interview took place at their Hamptons estate). One stipulation Anna was very clear about was that his four children would take over his empire, in order to protect them from his future wives or children down the road.\n\nJust 17 days after the ink dried on their divorce papers, Murdoch married Deng aboard that same 155-foot yacht, Morning Glory, in New York Harbor in front of about 85 guests, who enjoyed a trio of songs from singer Charlotte Church. According to The Hollywood Reporter, one guest recalled Murdoch giving a long speech “that he loved her and would take care of her, forever and ever.” The couple took off on a honeymoon. A photo of the nuptials was later posted on the News Corp. Web site.\n\nIn the name of love, Murdoch and Deng first moved into an apartment in Soho, a far cry and cab ride from his preferred Upper East Side. Vanity Fair contributing editor Mark Seal wrote that he was “reborn under the direction” of his third wife, who is 38 years his junior, going as far as enduring a rigid yoga routine, darkening his hair, and abandoning his coat-and-tie standard for a more relaxed, casual look. He would drink a concoction of soy protein and fruit in the morning if she told him to. He would eat only Chinese food if she said. The pair had two daughters in their 14-year marriage, though the mogul was far older than he was his first or second time around as a dad. These are the things you do as a romantic, as a man besotted for the third time.\n\nUnfortunately, that love was not enough to make it work, though it seems Murdoch’s devotion was not the issue. Rumors of Deng’s high-profile infidelity wounded him so, and the two were divorced in 2014.\n\nBut not one, not two, not even three commitments gone wrong are enough to keep the modern-day Romeo away. He and Hall, who were introduced by one of Murdoch’s sisters and have reportedly introduced a combined 10 children, seem to be giving it a go, despite the loves, and divorce settlements, he’s lost along the way. Pre-nuptial agreement or not (though, likely, pre-nuptial agreement): Is there anything more purely romantic than an octogenarian willing to put his fortune on the line for the fourth time for no other discernible reason other than to satisfy his heart’s desire? The answer is no. Let’s hope the fourth time is the charm."
