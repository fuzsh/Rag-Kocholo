The small-screen co-workers/lovers secretly tied the knot over the holidays, The Dish Rag reports.\n\nLittle is known about the nuptials, save for the newlyweds sharing their joyous news with the cast and crew last month after learning Valley is — spoiler alert — leaving the show.\n\nValley's ambiguous Agent Scott was killed off in the pilot, but Dunham has had frequent hallucinations and made \"contact\" with him.\n\nValley's rep confirmed the marriage for TVGuide.com, but gave no details."
