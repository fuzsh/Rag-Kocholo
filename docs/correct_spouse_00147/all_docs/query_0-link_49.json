But their relationship took a mysterious turn when Scott was seemingly killed and exposed as Dunham's apparent betrayer.\"They are, as individuals, two of the most genuine, warm and sensitive people that I have ever met,\" fellow Fringe star Lance Reddick told People magazine. \"I think they're a perfect fit, truly a match made in heaven, and I wish them all the happiness in the world.\""
