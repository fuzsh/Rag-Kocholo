Anna Torv.\n\nYesterday, that changed finally.\n\nAnna returned from the Comic-Con in San Diego, and we were there to meet her. She was prime objective #1 for everyone. Mostly, because no one had yet to get her since she got her.\n\nShe came thru the doors, and the hounds & fans were waiting eagerly. She stopped to sign for a minute or two & even chatted breifly with a couple of people.\n\nWith Anna out of the way now, the only notable cast members I havent gotten yet, are 2 that I dont think will be back (Kirk Acevedo & Mark Valley) from what I have heard & The Observer (Michael Cerveris)."
