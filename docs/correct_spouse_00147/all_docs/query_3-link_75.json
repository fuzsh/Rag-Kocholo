        "text": "Your Liquid Crystal Destiny!!\n\nThe Fall 2008 Network Grid!!\n\nPublished at: May 15, 2008, 6:07 p.m. CST by hercules\n\nI am – Hercules!! The Nets Describe Their Newbies: CRUSOE -- Based on the classic novel by Daniel Defoe, this is the tale of Robinson Crusoe. A young man leaves his true love to embark on an adventure -- only to end up shipwrecked on a remote tropical island for 28 years, completely detached from the life he once knew. His desire to return to his wife and his strong and unlikely friendship with Friday are the only things that keep him sane. While stranded, Crusoe encounters enemies and braves the elements. Equal parts \"MacGyver,\" \"Cast Away\" and \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" this series is an inspirational tale of survival rife with action and comedy. Power Entertainment produces \"Crusoe.\" DO NOT DISTURB (working title) is a hilarious workplace comedy set at one of New York City's hottest and hippest hotels: The Inn. Named one of the Big Apple's \"10 Best Places to Stay,\" The Inn is just that the \"in\" place to be, with its chic dcor, stylish staff and celebrity clientele. Behind the scenes, however, the upstairs/downstairs dynamic tells quite a different story. The hotel's top-notch reputation and sophisticated look is due in large part to NEAL (Jerry O'Connell, \"Crossing Jordan\") at least in his opinion. Although The Inn's charismatic owner R.J. (guest star Robert Wagner) takes all the credit, Neal is the egotistical, hyper-stylish, detail-oriented general manager who will do whatever it takes to keep the hotel and its employees up to his standards. RHONDA (Niecy Nash, \"Reno 911!\") is the head of Human Resources who also keeps Neal's demands in check. She's brash, fabulous and brutally honest and runs the HR department from her bullpen downstairs with a set of rules that are all her own. Rhonda does her best to keep the back of the house in line and the front of the house out of trouble. At the front desk handling check-in while wearing 6-inch Manolos is NICOLE (Molly Stanton, \"Twins\"), an aging model who is svelte, cynical and slightly starving. Fresh from Nebraska is JASON (Brando Eaton, \"Zoey 101\"), the nave bellman who would prefer to work behind-the-scenes, but was hired to show off his chiseled face and perfect pecs at the front of the hotel. The downstairs staff includes MOLLY (Jolene Purdy, \"Donnie Darko\"), a reservations clerk who dreams of pop-singer stardom as much as she craves to be part of the action upstairs; and LARRY (Jesse Tyler Ferguson, \"The Class\"), the head of housekeeping who spends more time on the phone cleaning up his messes at home than he does cleaning up after the guests upstairs. PRODUCTION COMPANIES: 20th Century Fox Television; Reveille, LLC; Principato-Young Productions EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: Abraham Higginbotham, Howard Owens, Carolyn Bernstein, Paul Young, Peter Principato, Brian Dobbins WRITER: Abraham Higginbotham DIRECTOR: Jason Bateman CAST: Jerry O'Connell as Neal, Niecy Nash as Rhonda, Molly Stanton as Nicole, Jesse Tyler Ferguson as Larry, Brando Eaton as Jason, Jolene Purdy as Molly GUEST STAR: Robert Wagner as R.J. ELEVENTH HOUR from acclaimed producer Jerry Bruckheimer follows Dr. Jacob Hood (Rufus Sewell, \"The Illusionist\"), a brilliant biophysicist and special science advisor to the government, as he investigates scientific crises and oddities. His jurisdiction is absolute and Hood is dogged in his pursuit of those who would abuse and misuse scientific discoveries and breakthroughs for their own gain. His passion and crusade is to protect the substance of science from those with nefarious motives. He is called in at the eleventh hour and he represents the last line of defense. Based on the British miniseries by acclaimed science-fiction writer Stephen Gallagher, the series is executive produced by Bruckheimer (\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,\" \"Pirates of the Caribbean\"), Jonathan Littman (\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,\" \"Cold Case\"), Danny Cannon (\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,\" \"CSI: Miami\"), Cyrus Voris (\"Bulletproof Monk\"), Ethan Reiff (\"Sleeper Cell\"), Mick Davis (\"Wake of Death\"), and Paul Buccieri (\"Fashion House\") for Jerry Bruckheimer Television in association with Warner Bros. Television. THE EX LIST is a comedic drama about Bella Bloom (Elizabeth Reaser, \"Grey's Anatomy\") - a single, 30-something, successful business owner who is surprised to learn from a psychic that she's already dated her future husband AND there's a catch: if she doesn't find him in the next year, she'll remain alone forever. During a bachelorette party for her sister, Daphne (Rachel Boston, \"American Dreams\"), Bella learns from the psychic she must revisit her past relationships and sort through the mistakes to find her soul mate. Skeptical, Bella begins to analyze every past liaison and failed romance with her close circle of friends, Augie (Adam Rothenberg, \"Mad Money\"), an endearing guy who has listened to Bella's love woes since college, Vivian (Alex Breckenridge, \"Dirt\"), Augie's long-term girlfriend, and Cyrus (Amir Talai, \"Campus Ladies\"), who's chronically unemployed and full of wry observations. Once Bella witnesses proof of the psychic's other predictions, her cynicism disappears and she begins her search. Along her trip down break-up lane, Bella is determined to remain optimistic and receptive, believing that when destiny reopens doors to the past, every relationship can matter in the future. Diane Ruggiero (\"Veronica Mars\") and Jonathan Levin (\"Charmed\") are executive producers for Twentieth Century Fox Television. FRINGE From J.J. Abrams (\"Lost\"), Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, the team behind \"Star Trek,\" \"Mission: Impossible III\" and \"Alias,\" comes a new drama that will thrill, terrify and explore the blurring line between science fiction and reality. When an international flight lands at Boston's Logan Airport and the passengers and crew have all died grisly deaths, FBI Special Agent OLIVIA DUNHAM (newcomer Anna Torv) is called in to investigate. After her partner, Special Agent JOHN SCOTT (Mark Valley, \"Boston Legal\"), is nearly killed during the investigation, a desperate Olivia searches frantically for someone to help, leading her to DR. WALTER BISHOP (John Noble, \"Lord of the Rings\"), our generation's Einstein. There's only one catch: he's been institutionalized for the last 20 years, and the only way to question him requires pulling his estranged son PETER (Joshua Jackson, \"Dawson's Creek\") in to help. When Olivia's investigation leads her to manipulative corporate executive NINA SHARP (Blair Brown, \"Altered States\"), our unlikely trio along with fellow FBI Agents PHILLIP BROYLES (Lance Reddick, \"The Wire\"), CHARLIE FRANCIS (Kirk Acevedo, \"Oz\") and ASTRID FARNSWORTH (Jasika Nicole, \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent\") will discover that what happened on Flight 627 is only a small piece of a larger, more shocking truth. PRODUCTION COMPANIES: Warner Bros. Television, Bad Robot Productions EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: J.J. Abrams, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Bryan Burk, Jeff Pinkner, Alex Graves (pilot) WRITERS: J.J. Abrams, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman DIRECTOR: Alex Graves CAST: Anna Torv as Olivia Dunham, Joshua Jackson as Peter Bishop, John Noble as Walter Bishop, Lance Reddick as Phillip Broyles, Kirk Acevedo as Charlie Francis, Mark Valley as John Scott, Blair Brown as Nina Sharp, Jasika Nicole as Astrid Farnsworth KNIGHT RIDER -- On the heels of NBC's hit movie, the iconic 1980s television classic comes roaring back to life as an updated drama series showcasing the new customized KITT (Knight Industries Three Thousand) Ford Mustang. As the sequel resumes, KITT is absolutely the coolest car ever created: Its supercomputer capable of hacking almost any system, its weapon systems efficient and its body -- thanks to its creator's work and nanotechnology -- capable of shifting shape and color. It is the ultimate car -- and someone will be willing to do anything to obtain it. \"Knight Rider\" stars Justin Bruening (\"Cold Case\"), Deanna Russo (\"NCIS\"), Sydney Tamiia Poitier (\"Veronica Mars\") and Bruce Davison (\"Breach\"). David Bartis (\"Heist,\" \"The O.C.\"), Doug Liman (\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith,\" \"The Bourne Identity\") and Gary Scott Thompson (\"Las Vegas,\" \"The Fast and the Furious\") are executive producers, and David Andron serves as supervising producer and writer. Based on characters created by Glen Larson, \"Knight Rider\" is from Universal Media Studios and Dutch Oven Productions. LIFE ON MARS \"Life on Mars\" is based on the BBC series created by Matthew Graham, Tony Jordan and Ashley Pharoah. The series revolves around Sam Tyler, a modern-day police detective who, after a car crash, mysteriously finds himself transported back to 1973 and still working as a detective. \"Life on Mars\" stars Jason O' Mara as Sam Tyler, Rachelle LeFevre as Annie Cartwright, Colm Meaney as Gene Hunt, Stephanie Jacobsen as Maya, Lenny Clarke as George Randall, Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Colin Raimes and Richard Benjamin as Milton Kornboll.

MY OWN WORST ENEMY -- Henry Spivey (Christian Slater, \"Bobby\") is a middle-class efficiency expert living a humdrum life in the suburbs with a wife, two kids, a dog, and a minivan. Edward Albright is an operative who speaks 13 languages, runs a four-minute mile and is trained to kill with his teeth. Henry and Edward are polar opposites who share only one thing in common: the same body. When the carefully constructed wall between them breaks down, Henry and Edward are thrust into unfamiliar territory where each man is dangerously out of his element. \"My Own Worst Enemy\" explores the duality of a man who is literally pitted against himself. And it raises the question: Whom can you trust when you can't trust yourself? The series is produced by Universal Media Studios. Jason Smilovic (\"Kidnapped\") is the executive producer; David Semel (director of the \"American Dreams,\" \"Heroes\" and \"Life\" pilots) is the director and executive producer. 90210 An edgy, contemporary spin-off of the iconic drama “Beverly Hills, 90210,” the new 90210 looks at life through the eyes of Annie Mills (Shenae Grimes, “Degrassi: The Next Generation”) and her brother Dixon (Tristan Wilds, “The Wire”), whose first day at West Beverly Hills High School leaves no doubt they’re not in Kansas anymore. The Mills family, including dad Harry (casting TBD) and mom Debbie (Lori Loughlin, “Summerland”), has relocated to Beverly Hills to keep an eye on Harry’s mother Tabitha (Jessica Walter, “Arrested Development”), a feisty-but-faded former television star and a charter member of the Betty Ford Clinic. For Annie and Dixon, the awkwardness of being the new kids is made worse by the fact that their dad has taken a job as the high school principal. The school is one big culture shock for Annie, a sweet and friendly girl with a passion for the theater, and Dixon, a star athlete and scholar who was adopted by the Mills family after they took him in as a foster child. Annie and Dixon have a close sibling relationship, which they’ll need to help them cope with all the new cliques and classmates, including Naomi (AnnaLynne McCord, “Nip/Tuck”), a hot, spoiled, rich girl; Ethan (Dustin Milligan, “Runaway”), a popular jock whose abilities rival Dixon’s; Navid (Michael Steger, “The Winner”), an aspiring reporter who heads up the school’s daily newscast; and Silver (Jessica Stroup, “Prom Night”), a rebel who produces and stars in a YouTube-type video series. Even the faculty seems hip and sophisticated at WBHHS, such as smart and funny teacher Ryan Matthews (Ryan Eggold, “Dirt”) and beautiful guidance counselor Kelly Taylor (guest star Jennie Garth, the original “Beverly Hills, 90210”). The Mills family has just begun to realize how much their lives are about to change. 90210 is produced by CBS Paramount Network Television with executive producers Gabe Sachs & Jeff Judah (“Freaks & Geeks”). Mark Piznarski (“Gossip Girl”) is the director and executive producer of the pilot. OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS \"Opportunity Knocks\" is a new show that breaks the mold of typical game and reality shows. We will be showing up on America's doorstep and testing how well they know their family. Our mobile team will arrive at \"Anywhere, America\" in a semi-truck that is full of flat screen TVs, new furniture and big cash prizes that the family can win right there. We will take the action of a game show directly into our contestants' homes, setting up shop in a family's front lawn. The instant our host, JD Roth, knocks on the front door, the game will begin. Hollywood will invade a suburban neighborhood, and each week one lucky family will play the game of a lifetime in front of all their friends and neighbors. The host poses trivia questions to family members based directly on their lives, each other and articles found in and around their home. If they're able to prove they know their family inside and out, they'll win the prizes of their dreams. Executive producers for \"Opportunity Knocks\" are Ashton Kutcher, Jason Goldberg, Karey Burke, J.D. Roth and Todd A. Nelson. \"Opportunity Knocks\" is produced by Katalyst Films and 3 Ball Productions. THE MENTALIST stars Golden Globe Award nominee Simon Baker (\"The Devil Wears Prada\") as Patrick Jane, a detective and independent consultant with the California Bureau of Investigation (CBI), who has a remarkable track record for solving serious crimes by using his razor sharp skills of observation. Within the Bureau, Jane is notorious for his blatant lack of protocol and his semi-celebrity past as a psychic medium, whose paranormal abilities he now admits he feigned. Jane's role in cracking a series of tough high-profile cases is greatly valued by his fellow agents. However, no-nonsense Senior Agent Teresa Lisbon (Robin Tunney, \"Prison Break\") openly resists having Jane in her unit and alternates between reluctantly acknowledging Jane's usefulness and blasting him for his theatrics, narcissism and dangerous lack of boundaries. Lisbon's team includes agents Kimball Cho (Tim Kang, \"Rambo\"), Wayne Rigsby (Owain Yeoman, \"The Nine\"), and rookie member Grace Van Pelt (Amanda Righetti, \"The O.C.\"), who all think Jane's a loose cannon but admire his charm and knack for clearing cases. Bruno Heller (creator of \"Rome\") is creator/executive producer, and Emmy Award winner David Nutter (\"Band of Brothers\") is the executive producer for Warner Bros. Television.

SURVIVING THE FILTHY RICH Twenty-three-year-old Megan Smith (JoAnna Garcia, “Reba”) has a Yale education, a relentlessly positive attitude and a plan to conquer the world of journalism, despite the fact that she is currently slaving away at a tabloid rag. Megan’s plan is thrown off course when, in one whirlwind day, she gets fired, meets cosmetics mogul Laurel Limoges (casting TBD) and becomes the live-in tutor for Laurel’s twin teen granddaughters in the heady Palm Beach world of wealth and power. The girls, Rose (Lucy Kate Hale, “Bionic Woman”) and Sage (Ashley Newbrough, “The Best Years”), are beautiful, rebellious and less-than-thrilled with their new tutor, but Megan is determined to win them over as she enjoys the perks of her new job ─ breathtaking private suite, gorgeous convertible and live-in chef Marco (Allan Louis, “Stomp the Yard”). Even the neighbors are fabulous in Palm Beach, and Megan quickly catches the eye of Will (casting TBD), the wealthy and extremely hot dilettante who lives on the estate next door and just happens to be dating Megan’s estranged sister Lily (casting TBD). Completing this romantic quadrangle is Megan’s best friend Charlie (Michael Cassidy, “Smallville,” “The O.C.”), who is secretly in love with her. Despite her own complicated romantic and family relationships, Megan is committed to making a difference in the lives of her two headstrong charges as she navigates the treacherous waters of high society in Palm Beach.

He's the fun parent and she's the strict one. Together, they share custody of their two children - Louise (Laura Marano, \"Without a Trace\"), a politically correct and environmentally conscious 11-year-old, and Tom (Ryan Malgarini, \"How to Eat Fried Worms\"), their socially awkward 14-year-old son who is nervous around girls. Charming and acerbic, Gary hasn't dated since the split, but finally connects with Vanessa (Jaime King, \"The Class\"), a single mother whose condo he was hired to paint. He dreads telling Allison about Vanessa because it doesn't adhere to her belief in their marriage counselor's book, \"Rules for the Perfect Divorce.\" However, when Allison tells him that she's engaged to their shrink, all bets are off and Gary decides it's time to move forward. Now, in pursuit of post-marriage happiness, Gary must juggle his eclectic world of an ex-wife, their two kids, their shrink and his gorgeous new girlfriend.

Dick (Kurtwood Smith, \"That '70s Show\"), a stern Judge, and his wife Angela (Nancy Lenehan, \"My Name is Earl\"), are protective of their daughter, and are really trying to let go of the anger they feel toward Sam ... after all, disaster follows whenever he visits their house. But despite his best efforts, every time Sam takes one positive step forward in winning over his future in-laws, he inevitably takes two crushing steps back. But with support and love from Melanie who stands up for him despite his knack for making himself look bad, Sam will hopefully charm his way into her family.
