        "text": "— A longtime reader from Hot Springs Village once asked me to briefly explain Fringe, Fox’s frequently confusing science fiction mystery thriller. She didn’t get it and really wanted to.\n\nBriefly? I couldn’t do it.\n\nAs with Lost, The X-Files and Twin Peaks, the cult hit Fringe is not so much about the destination as it is the journey.\n\nWeird stuff happens. You scratch your head. You come back the next week to see if any of it makes sense.\n\nIs that a recipe for success? Not so much in this day of fragmented audiences, short attention spans and network programmers with hair triggers.\n\nBut Fringe had compelling characters and somehow it managed to last five seasons and 100 episodes.\n\nIt all comes to a promised spectacular and emotional two-hour end at 7 p.m. Friday. I’ve stuck with the series all the way and will be there to mark the occasion. Friday’s final two episodes are titled “Liberty” and “An Enemy of Fate.” Ponder that for clues.\n\nEqually as exciting as it will be to see how the series ends is the fact that anetwork notoriously fickle in permitting longevity has actually allowed a series to wind down on its own. That’s increasingly rare these days, for Fox or anybody else.\n\nAbout his show, co-creator J.J. Abrams told The Hollywood Reporter last week, “It has been both mind-blowing and humbling. I’ve always been a fan of science fiction, and to be able to tell this story about a family - a family that, through everything, fought together for survival - has been a highlight of my career.”\n\nThat’s as good an explanation of the series’ appeal as any. Behind all the bizarre events, parallel universes, corporate and scientific conspiracies, altered timelines and being frozen in amber, the tale is essentially one of family relationships.\n\nThe series stars JoshuaJackson, Anna Torv, John Noble and Jasika Nicole as four intrepid heroes who battle to save life as we know it from being destroyed by the cold, emotionless “Observers.”\n\nIt all began Sept. 9, 2008, with an airliner landing by autopilot at Boston’s Logan Airport. Every passenger was dead, their bodies crystallized. Baffled, the feds created a special “fringe science” task force to investigate this and other increasingly frequentscientific anomalies.\n\nThere seemed to be a pattern developing - “a mysterious sequence of unexplained phenomena suggestive of someone or something performing experiments on the world.” The Fringe Division was on the case.\n\nFBI agent Olivia Dunham (Torv) joins forces with Peter Bishop (Jackson) and his brilliant but “mad” scientist father Walter Bishop (John Noble), adds her assistant,Astrid Farnsworth (Nicole), and the team is off and running for the next five years.\n\nSeason 5 has been set in 2036, years after the Observers seized control and our team was frozen in amber. Can our heroes save the world? I’m betting that they will.\n\n30 Rock. Speaking of series finales, NBC’s 30 Rock folds its tents at 7 p.m. Jan. 31 with a special hour episode that’ll feature House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (DCalif.) as a guest.\n\nPelosi has a challenge after Vice President Joe Biden’s witty performance in a Parks and Recreation cameo in November.\n\nOther politicians who have shown up on 30 Rock include Al Gore, Condoleezza Rice and Michael Bloomberg.\n\nLongmire Several times each week I get e-mails or a call from readers asking if A&E’s Longmire has been canceled. The Western crime drama stars Australian actor Robert Taylor as Wyoming sheriff Walt Longmire, Katee Sackhoff (Battlestar Gallactica), as his deputy, and Lou Diamond Phillips as his friend Henry Standing Bear.\n\nThe series earned big ratings for A&E and was renewed in June for a second season. There has been no word when new episodes will arrive, but this coming June seems a logical time.\n\nAll renewed. USA has ordered a 10-episode Season 3 for Necessary Roughness. The series, starring Callie Thorne, joins other recent USA renewals, Suits, Burn Notice, Royal Pains, White Collar and Covert Affairs.\n\nDownton numbers. Finally, several readers have asked how the Season 3 premiere of PBS’ Downton Abbey did in the ratings. Answer: Huge.\n\nWith almost 8 million viewers, on Jan. 6, Downton Abbey quadrupled the average PBS prime-time rating. It beat out Fox, ABC and NBC in its time slot.\n\nThe premiere was topped only by CBS’ The Mentalist with 10.7 million viewers and The Good Wife with 10 million.\n\nCorrection. Pioneers of Television airs at 7 p.m. Tuesdays on PBS and AETN through Feb. 5.\n\nThe TV Column appears Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nE-mail:"
