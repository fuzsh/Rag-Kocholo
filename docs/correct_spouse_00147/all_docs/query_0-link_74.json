        "text": "As the maybe dead, maybe alive John Scott on J.J. Abrams’ sci-fi/horror drama “Fringe” (Tuesday night at 9:01 on WFXT, Ch. 25), Mark Valley has perfected the art of being cryptic.\n\nNews leaked last week that Valley and actress Anna Torv, who plays FBI agent Olivia Dunham on the Fox show, were married in a secret ceremony late last year.\n\nIn a conference call with reporters before that information became public, Valley was equally coy about the show’s story lines.\n\nThe 1987 West Point graduate tossed out nonsensical explanations and avoided questions about whether Scott is dead, and refused to describe Scott as a good guy or a bad guy. (Last week’s episode ended with Scott being measured for his white hat.)\n\nHowever, he did share a few thoughts on co-star Torv – unknown to few then, his leading lady in real life.\n\n“She’s a fantastic actress,” the 44-year-old said. “She has such a solid sense about what’s going on in a scene. She’s my favorite one on the show, to be honest with you.”\n\nFavorite on the show, indeed.\n\n“Yes, I’ve enjoyed working with her, and as a person, she’s just delightful,” Valley said.\n\nFor someone whose character died in “Fringe’s” pilot, Valley has gotten a lot of work. Scott met a gruesome demise in the first episode, but continues to appear in Olivia’s head via sensory deprivation visions and memories. His character’s arc seems to have ended last week, but Valley admitted that he knows little about what’s to come.\n\n“I only know when I get the script, basically,” he said. “They don’t have an episode for any other scripts. But I generally just know, as with all of the actors, probably four or five days before the episode starts, sometimes less time.”\n\nThe series deals with such timely topics as bioterrorism and covert operations. Does the show mirror real life?\n\n“When you look at some things like the spread of an Ebola virus, or some of these other superviruses and strains that just act so quickly, that can get your imagination running,” Valley said. “I think that there are aspects of science-fiction and technology that can hint toward what this show portrays, but to answer your question, no.”"
