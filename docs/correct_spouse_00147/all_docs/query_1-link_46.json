        "text": "Anna Torv plays FBI Agent Olivia Dunham in Fringe, which returns Tuesday to Fox.\n\nPhoto courtesy Fox *Get ready for a fresh barrage of whacked-out sci-fi machinations when Fringe returns Tuesday for six straight episodes brimming with weird science and strange conspiracies.\n\nDespite on-again/off-again scheduling hiccups that have disrupted the series' first season, star Anna Torv told reporters in a recent conference call that playing catch-up should be a snap for fans and newbies alike.\n\nFBI Agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) befriends a mysterious child (Spencer List).\n\nPhoto courtesy Fox\"This is absolutely a show that you can just start watching,\" Torv said. \"Like, the first episode back, you'll catch up.\"\n\nThe J.J. Abrams-produced series follows Torv's character, FBI Agent Olivia Dunham, as she investigates a creepy conspiracy with her partners, reformed mad scientist Walter Bishop (played by John Noble) and his renegade son, Peter (Joshua Jackson).\n\nThe show delivers an X-Files-style blend of crime, mystery and so-called fringe science, with Bishop and company setting up a lab at Harvard to dig into cases that revolve around something called \"the Pattern.\"\n\nIn \"Inner Child,\" the Tuesday episode that kicks off Season 1's final story arc, Agent Dunham befriends a bald wonder child who helps her track down a serial killer. And it only gets weirder from there.\n\nTorv, an Australian actress who met and married Fringe co-star Mark Valley earlier this season, talked about secrets, freaks and mysteries to be unveiled as Fringe ramps up to its May finale.\n\nInteracting with gore: \"You'll be looking at these bodies or these guts coming out and a lot of it is actually done with prosthetics and looks incredible on set,\" Torv said. \"Some of it is awful. We have an episode coming up where we end up with these bodies in the lab, and I mean those bodies were revolting.\n\n\"I walk into the lab to do a scene, and we've got these three young actors lying in these body bags. One is lying with just a head and hands out reading a book. The other kid has got an iPod in [his ears] and blood splattered all over his apron. You're like, 'What is this show?'\"\n\nWalter Bishop (John Noble) experiments on himself in Fringe.\n\nPhoto courtesy Fox__Favorite scene: __ \"You'd think it would be some big, explosive kind of thing, but we shot a scene recently in Walter and Peter's hotel room where Olivia has just discovered some things about her past and some things that Walter is connected to,\" Torv said. \"I loved shooting that because it was the first time that Olivia really inched her way into that dynamic of Peter and Walter. She's been kind of on the outside, and wrangling them constantly, but this gave me a glimpse into realizing everything is a little bit entwined. I can't say anything more because I'll get into trouble or something.\"\n\n__Acting in a coma: __: Mark Valley, Torv's husband, plays Agent John Scott, who's been in a coma for most of the season. \"All the scenes that we had together were kind of like odd,\" Torv said. \"We were always in dreamscape. I don't really feel like we actually got a chance to really feel opposite each other. I was always saying, 'You're a ghost,; and he was always saying, 'No, I'm not.'\"\n\nFavorite Olivia moments: \"I love doing the rough-and-tumble, running and gunning,\" Torv said. \"When we're in the lab, I just get to be the question machine. I get to watch the boys sort of have fun at 'The Walter and Peter Show.'\"\n\nAgent Dunham tries to relate to a precocious youngster in \"Inner Child.\"\n\nPhoto courtesy FoxOlivia's big secret: In upcoming episodes, \"We start to find out what was done to Olivia when she was little,\" Torv said. \"In [previous episode] 'The Ability' episode where she turns the light box off (with her mind), you learn she maybe has some special ability. We delve a little bit into working out why she has that ability or superpower or if it's something that's been done to her. I'm terrible at these plot questions because I never know how much to give away or not, so it sounds like I'm being really shifty, but I'm not. I'm just trying to compute what's OK to say.\"\n\nFavorite episode: \"In 'Bound,' when Olivia gets kidnapped, they're giving her a spinal tap and she wakes up and breaks out — it was just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,\" Torv said. \"I found it really easy to follow and kind of energetic.\"\n\nRecurring characters: \"Harris [played by Michael Gaston] comes back. I think he's a really cool character, and we find out a little bit more about him, and also David Robert Jones [played by Jared Harris] kicks back in, who is the scientist from the German prison who escaped.\"\n\n__Serial killer returns: __ \"He calls himself 'The Artist' and he sends invitations to his artwork, which are always displayed in public places — really creepy,\" Torv said.\"\n\nSeason 1 of Fringe continues at 9 p.m. EST Tuesday on Fox.\n\nSee also:\n\nAbrams on Fringe: Science, Conspiracies and 'The Pattern'\n\nFirst Look: J.J.
