        "text": "Paternity\n\nWhen a family's nanny is found gruesomely murdered, the obvious suspect is her Internet love interest, \"Casanova\" (guest star Steven Bauer). But it isn't long before Detectives Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) suspect the nanny's employers (guest stars Mark Valley and Anastasia Griffith) may have a few dark skeletons in their closet. The investigation leads to a case of murder and infidelity, which is further complicated when Stabler's own family suffers a tragedy that leaves Stabler's unborn child in serious danger.\n\nBoom\n\nA deadly bomb explosion at a Vegas office building sends Grissom and the CSI team in search of a serial bomber, and their primary suspect is the building's overly helpful security guard who knows more than he should about blowing things up.\n\nHomecoming\n\nGreene and Corday contract poison ivy after a romantic outing together. Dr. Chen keeps her pregnancy a secret. Carter finishes a drug rehabilitation program. Romano appoints Benton as a new surgical attending physician. Because Abby's husband failed to pay her medical school tuition, she gets temporarily deleted from the program. Members of two rival high school football teams and some of their fans cause a disturbance in the ER while a player gets treated.\n\nThy Will Be Done\n\nWeaver becomes concerned about Greene's cognitive skills and surrepticiously calls for an official evaluation of his competency. Corday plans her wedding to Greene. Bishop Stewart (James Cromwell) returns, and Kovacs realizes the man has a terrible disease. Dateless for a charity function, Carter invites Abby to attend with him. Kovac pretends he's not jealous. While there, Abby has a terrible encounter with her ex-husband and his young girlfriend.\n\nBeyond Repair\n\nOn her birthday, Abby receives a few unwelcome surprises, including the news that Kovac plans to leave town for two months to work in Bosnia. She also finds out that her ex-husband is engaged to remarry. Despite Abby's efforts to prevent it, Carter has an uncomfortable encounter with the patient, Paul Sobriki who stabbed him and killed a fellow doctor two years ago. Abby cares for a young boy, Douglas Leeman, after his mother dies in the hospital. And she shares a drink with her neighbor Joyce one of the few people who acknowledge Abby's birthday."
