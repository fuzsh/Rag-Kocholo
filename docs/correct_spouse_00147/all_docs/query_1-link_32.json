        "text": "On Boston Legal, one character who almost certainly knows how to get through anything and everything as long as his friends feel the need to get something done is Brad Chase. He relies on his Marine Corps training to pave the way, whether through bullying or physically demanding tasks. Given the complexity of this character, it’s certainly not everyone who will be good at it. But for someone like Mark Valley, an American actor who previously served in the US Army, he understood every last detail of how to bring the character of Brad to life in the television series. Thus, with his portrayal of the role from 2004 to 2007, it is still one of his best-known works.\n\nIn this article we will tell you everything we know about the actor, including his career both in the military and in the acting industry. In addition, his ex-wife will hardly be out of the picture. So, find out everything you never knew about Mark below.\n\nMark Valley Biography\n\nThe actor’s full name is Mark Thomas Valley, but he is popularly known as Mark Valley. He was born just a day before Christmas (December 24) in 1964. Mark’s place of birth is Ogdensburg, New York, United States making him an American citizen while his ethnicity is said to be a mix of French, Canadian and Irish.\n\nRegarding his family members, the actor was born to Michael Valley (father) and Martha Valley (mother), while his siblings are Jennifer Valley, Lynne Valley and Marnie Valley. Yes, they are all ladies.\n\nMark Valley’s first job was as a soldier. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1987 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and engineering. He then served in Berlin and also in the Gulf War.\n\nDuring his time in the military, Mark played rugby with the Berlin Amis Rugby Football Club; a United States military rugby team. There are no publicly available records of how he transitioned from military to civilian life. In the absence of that, however, we know how his acting career began.\n\nMovies and TV Shows\n\nMark Valley began his acting career on screen with his first acting role in The Innocent (1993), playing the character of a tunnel engineer. After that work, he landed more film roles in projects like Breast Men (1997), Any Girl, and The Siege both in 1998.\n\nMark started the new millennium with roles in films such as The Next Best, and Jericho (both in 2000) and from that point on he has played various challenging characters in other films such as Big Time, Life! , Shrek the Third (voice as Cyclops), Stolen, Zero Dark Thirty, Batman The Dark Knight Returns: Part 2, Lost Boy, and Gun Shy.\n\nOn television, Mark Valley has had many more projects to his name. In the 90s he began with Another World, The Disappearing Son IV, Days of Our Lives, George Wallace and Brimstone Mark got better in the 2000s, an era in which he recorded his largest body of work to date. His acting projects at this time included Diagnosis: Murder, Running Mates, ER, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Gideon’s Crossing, and Spin City. You can also find him in Harry Green and Eugene I’m With Her, Emily’s Reasons Why Not, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Fringe, and Human Goal.\n\nFrom 2011 until the time we updated this article, the Ogdensburg-born actor has had his credit roles on shows like Corpus des Evidence, SOKO Stuttgart (German TV Series) , Boston Legal, Hawaii Five-0, Bloodline, Wisdom of the Crowd, The Flash, and The Romanoffs.\n\nMark Valley is ex-wife (Anna Torv)\n\nMark Valley was previously a married man. He married his Fringe co-star, Anna Torv, in December 2008. Barely a year after the marriage, the couple went their separate ways after a divorce. What led to the collapse of their marriage is nothing the actor or his ex-wife felt appropriate to disclose.\n\nWhether they had children or not, just like there is no mention of what led to their divorce, it is also not known if they had a child together. But then it was reported through some neighborhoods that Mark Valley has a daughter named Sherri Valley."
