You’re watching a TV program and you think, “Wow, that policeman should totally play the brother of the demon hunter from that other show!” Or, in the extreme, “Wait, that zany waitress isn’t the same actress from the medical drama we watched last night?!”\n\nWith nearly 500 scripted shows out there, you have to figure that at least 3,000 actors are currently, steadily employed. Add in the fact that a good chunk of them are conventionally attractive (and that the women pretty much share the same hairstyle), and odds are you’re going to find some “lookalikes” — or, at least pairs that look like they could be related (but probably aren’t, in all honesty. DNA spoiler alert!).[pmc_inline_gallery]\n\nSure, there are the oft-referenced uncanny resemblances, such as Nina Dobrev and Victoria Justice, or Abigail Spencer and Bridget Regan (who despite being four inches apart in height in fact took turns with the same role on Grey’s Anatomy)."
