        "text": "IF you love “Lost” and were crazy for “Alias,” then have I got a show for you. It’s called “Fringe,” and it’s a little bit of this and a lotta bits of that.\n\nThe series, which has been hipster-hyped to the point of total confusion, is the newest action series from J. J. Abrams (as in “see above”).\n\nThe scary scenario begins with another Abrams’ mid-air emergency but ends up featuring the athletic espionage and counter-espionage work of a female intelligence agent. Sound familiar?\n\nBut even if Abrams is copying from two of his most interesting series, that doesn’t mean he hasn’t come up with something new, and even stranger (difficult as it is to get stranger than “Lost.”)\n\nThe debut episode, which twists all over the place, begins with an incident aboard an aircraft. This time, it’s a plane full of Germans whose skin melts off. Melting Germans is never an attractive sight – but trust me, when the flight attendants start screaming, it gets scarier still.\n\nWhen the plane finally lands at Boston’s Logan Airport, the feds all run on the plane – then run off looking like that guy from Edvard Munch’s “The Scream.”\n\nQuick cut to an extremely good-looking couple having sex. Right there, it shows how innovative Abrams really is.\n\nMost other new shows this season seem to open with the extremely good-looking couple having sex. Abrams waits five, full minutes!\n\nAnyway, we learn that these two are fooling-around-federal agents Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv, a dead ringer for Kate Blanchette) and her partner on the job – and in her bed – John Scott (Mark Valley).\n\nThe phone suddenly rings causing sexus interruptus, and the agents are dispatched by the head of Homeland Security to a storage facility.\n\nThere, they find a strange guy and a room full of chemicals. Run, run, run, chase, chase, chase over rooftops and chain link fences when, of course, the facility blows up – and along with it, partner John.\n\nBut oops, he doesn’t die. He gets the skin-melting disease, too!\n\nSo there you have it – it’s up to Olivia to find out what’s causing the flesh-eating disaease and save the world and her boyfriend, not necessarily in that order.\n\nThis leads Olivia to seek out Einstein-quivalent genius, Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble), who is now residing in the loony bin for the criminally insane.\n\nVisitors are verboten except for immediate family which means finding Bishop’s estranged, renegade son, Peter (Joshua Jackson), a soldier of fortune/genius in Iraq.\n\nNext comes a lot of government and corporate conspiracy and “fringe science,” which includes everything from genetic mutation to reincarnation, teleportation, mind control, astral projection and invisibility. In other words, the sky (or in this case, the skin) is the limit!\n\nLots of good action and lots of fun to boot.\n\n“Fringe”\n\nTomorrow night at 8 on Fox"
