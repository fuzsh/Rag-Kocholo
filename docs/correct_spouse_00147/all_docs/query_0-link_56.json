        "text": "Life imitates art at the Fox series Fringe, where co-stars Anna Torv and Mark Valley have wed.\n\nTorv's representative, Jen Turner, says the couple were married in December. She didn't provide any details.\n\nTorv, 29, plays FBI Special Agent Olivia Dunham on Fringe. Valley, 44, played Dunham's partner and secret lover, agent John Scott, when the series began last fall. But the relationship took a mysterious turn when Scott was seemingly killed and exposed as Dunham's apparent betrayer."
