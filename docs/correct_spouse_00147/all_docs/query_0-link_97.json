        "text": "How is the former Mr. Anna Torv doing these days, OP? Feeling gay, you say?\n\nDid Fox promise him his own show if he did it?\n\nI mean, they did give him one.\n\nHe's NOT gay. I investigated when I rewatched Once & Again earlier this year. He had an affair with Judy when he was fixing up her bookshop \"The Two Sisters\"\n\nBut it's possible. Married just once, for a year.\n\nI have heard nothing yet that indicates he is gay. he has a child with one woman, and was also married once to Anna Torv.\n\nSexy... love the nose, the lantern jaw (though not really the best description),the bod, and his eyes are beautiful too. I ordinarily do not find blondes or fair-coloured blokes sexy, yet he is a rare exception. James Norton, Paul Walker, and Simon Baker are my other exceptions.\n\nI have always thought he was a very attractive man. Are there any nudes of him? Any of you had him?"
