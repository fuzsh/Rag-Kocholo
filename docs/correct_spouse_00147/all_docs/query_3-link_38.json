        "text": "I'm not exactly the ideal audience for BBC America's newest British drama import, Mistresses (launching tonight at 9 pm ET/PT, with a \"sneak peek\" at 8 pm), but I also found myself sucked into this sleek and seductive new series.\n\nOriginally airing in the UK on BBC One, Mistresses (which will air its first two seasons back-to-back in the US), is the story of four female friends, each with very, er, complicated relationships. But don't think that this is yet another Desperate Housewives clone: these women live lives that are far closer to our own that the hyper-real soap that is Wisteria Lane.\n\nFor one, the cast of characters seems populated by women we all know in our own real lives. There's brilliant physician Katie (Blackpool's Sarah Parish), a hopeless romantic who falls for John, a married patient with a terminal illness, and secretly euthanizes him... only to come face to face with his twenty-something son Sam (The Tudors' Max Brown) who knows that his father was cheating on his mother and wants to find out just who this woman is. For her part, Katie promised John that she would look after Sam... but finds herself increasingly drawn to him sexually.\n\nThen there's compassionate and maternal Trudi (The Inspector Lynley Mysteries' Sharon Small), widowed after 9/11, who keeps receiving strange phone calls that she believes could be her missing husband, whose body was never recovered. When she receives a £1 million check from the 9/11 fund and meets divorced dad Richard (The Office's Patrick Baladi), it could be the start of a new era for Trudi, but she finds herself increasingly being pulled back into the past.\n\nBrilliant attorney Siobhan (Shark's Orla Brady) has discovered that her love life with her husband Hari (Spooks' Raza Jaffrey) has been transformed into a never-ending effort to produce a child and finds herself drawn into a relationship with her sexy co-worker Dominic (Sensitive Skin's Adam Rayner).\n\nFinally, there's the sexually irrepressible Jessica (Party Animals' Shelley Conn), the youngest member of this group. She works as a party planner and is involved in an affair with her married boss Simon (Adam Astill); she's satisfied with her life until she's assigned to plan a wedding for a lesbian couple, Alex (Fringe's Anna Torv) and Lisa. Thrown together with Alex, Jessica feels an instant connection with her, though Jessica is thrown by her attraction to another woman.\n\nCreated by SJ Clarkson, Lowri Glain, and Rachel Anthony, Mistresses presents a very different look at modern relationships, seen through the eyes of four very different women, each one deeply flawed but also wholly sympathetic. Through the series' trysts, romances, and friendships, the talented writing team--made up of mostly women, it must be said--is able to explore just what makes men and women tick in the 21st century.\n\nThe cast is top-notch. I'm especially enamoured of Sharon Small's Trudi, who manages to provide one of the more tragic figures in the piece as well as one of the most optimistic and comedic. (It's no small feat to pull that off and Small does so with skill and grace.) All of the women are absolutely fantastic and it's easy to feel yourself drawn into their orbits: Orla Brady quietly exudes the steely nerves of a woman who knows what she wants but feels the pressure of morality; Sarah Parish paints a nuanced portrait of a woman teetering on the edge of a breakdown, both personal and professional; and Shelley Conn gives Jessica an exuberant edge in a compelling storyline about sexual awakening that could have in lesser hands, seemed cliché or exploitative. (That's to say nothing of Anna Torv's charged performance as philandering lesbian bride-to-be.)\n\nAll in all, Mistresses proves to be the rare female-centric television series that women (and their men) can watch together with equal relish. And with four talented actresses at its core, gripping storylines, and a whole lot of passion, there are worst ways to spend a Friday night. So pour yourself a big glass of red wine, turn off the telephone, and settle in with these mistresses.\n\nMistresses premieres tonight with two back-to-back airings of the premiere episode at 8 pm and 9 pm ET/PT on BBC America.\n\nLabels\n\nLost fans: you don't have to make your way to the island via Ajira Airways in order to ask a question of the creative team or the series' stars. Televisionary is taking questions from fans to put to Lost 's executive producers/showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and stars Matthew Fox (\"Jack Shephard\"), Evangeline Lilly (\"Kate Austen\"), and Michael Emerson (\"Benjamin Linus\") for a series of on-camera interviews taking place this weekend. If you have a specific question for any of the above producers or actors from Lost , please leave it in the comments section below . I'll be accepting questions until midnight PT tonight and, while I can't promise I'll be able to ask any specific inquiry due to the brevity of these on-camera interviews, I am looking for some insightful and thought-provoking questions to add to the mix. So who knows: your burning question might get asked after all.\n\nEvery story begins with thread. It's up to the storyteller to determine just how much they need to parcel out, what pattern they're making, and when to cut it short and tie it off. With last night's penultimate season finale of Lost (\"The Incident, Parts One and Two\"), written by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, we began to see the pattern that Lindelof and Cuse have been designing towards the last five seasons of this serpentine series. And it was only fitting that the two-hour finale, which pushes us on the road to the final season of Lost , should begin with thread, a loom, and a tapestry. Would Jack follow through on his plan to detonate the island and therefore reset their lives aboard Oceanic Flight 815 ? Why did Locke want to kill Jacob? What caused The Incident? What was in the box and just what lies in the shadow of the statue? We got the answers to these in a two-hour season finale that didn't quite pack the same emotional wallop of previous season\n\nI may just have to change my original \"What I'll Be Watching This Fall\" post, as I sat down and finally watched CBS' new crime drama Smith this weekend. (What? It's taken me a long time to make my way through the stack of pilot DVDs.) While it's on following Gilmore Girls and Veronica Mars on Tuesday nights (10 pm ET/PT, to be exact), I'm going to be sure to leave enough room on my TiVo to make sure that I catch this compelling, amoral drama. While one can't help but be impressed by what might just be the most marquee-friendly cast in primetime--Ray Liotta, Virginia Madsen, Jonny Lee Miller, Amy Smart, Simon Baker, and Franky G all star and Shohreh Aghdashloo has a recurring role--the pilot's premise alone earned major points in my book: it's a crime drama from the point of view of the criminals, who engage in high-stakes heists. But don't be alarmed; it's nothing like NBC's short-lived Heist . Instead, think of it as The Italian"
