        "text": "The gorgeous Anna Torv starred in Fringe and Secret City and is currently playing a lesbian in the show Mindhunters. She pings like hell for me and plays a lot of lesbian roles. She always has amazing chemistry with women on screen. She was very briefly married to one of her male Fringe costars years ago but nothing since then about any boyfriends. Doesn't seem to talk about her personal life. And, did I mention the pinging...\n\nYeah, R1, I think she's estranged from that side of her family and has been for most of her life. Now, back to the pinging.\n\nThis is the most lesbian anyone can look, dress, or move without actually laying on top another woman...\n\nOh, and the guy she was married to, Mark Valley, supposedly has a lot of gay rumors about him out there too.\n\nHere's Anna in intellectual lesbian summer garb. The reason \"guys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses\" is because all the lesbians got there first. Damn, she's hot.\n\nBut, R5, there are literally zero stories about her dating any men. She strangely and kind of secretly married her costar and that ended in less than a year while she was still on the show and then there's been nothing. She really just pings like hell. I wonder if she's not more talked about as being gay because she's so beautiful and pretty feminine and those stereotypes are still pretty strong when it comes to lesbians.\n\nAs far as LChat, she's got a 114 page thread, so...\n\nYeah. A year at the most. And, it takes some time to divorce, so they were probably actually married as a couple for more like 6-8 months.\n\nR7, she's amazing on Mindhunter. I hope they make season three more about her. After I finish Mindhunter, I'm going to watch Secret City. It's on Netflix and the clips I've seen so far have her being another badass like on Fringe and, of course, having amazing chemistry with her female costars.\n\nLesbian \"dress\", R2? She's wearing a T-shirt!\n\nI've watched Anna's rise all the way back from NIDA (where she was outstanding in the lead in Plenty), but although I used to see her hanging about the lobby there like all the other students, I saw no clues one way or the other to assist this thread. She was always lovely to anyone who wanted to talk to her, though, and not at all big-headed even though she was plainly the star of her class.\n\nI like Katie McGrath, too. For those who don't know, she's Lena Luthor on Supergirl.\n\nAgree with you R22. That would make McGrath the exception that proves the rule. She has all the similarities yet doesn't ping at all to me whereas Torv pings off the charts. Pinging is hard to explain. It's all intuition based. Then, you use other factors to prove the ping. That's where I'm at with Torv at this point. She pings all over the place and there are a lot of outside indicators that prove the ping.\n\nKristen Stewart was the same way. Even in the middle of the Pattinson thing there were a lot of us who were like, \"Why is that lesbian dating that guy?\" She just pinged. Ellen Page, too. I think we all knew Jodie Foster was a lesbian since she was practically an infant. We gays and lesbians know of what we speak when it comes to other gays and lesbians. Weren't there people who said, \"Duh.\" when you came out when you thought you were hiding it so well. Think about hiding that but having everything you do on film and in pictures on the internet for people to analyze over and over. It's really hard to hide the ping."
