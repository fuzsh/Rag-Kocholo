In Tuesday's episode, the show even adds a new character who is, for all intents and purposed, a clone of Valleys Brad Chase. Chase tells the fast-talking new guy, Jeffrey Coho (Craig Bierko), not to chase the women at the firm, because Im that guy. Yes, Chase is that guy - why bring Coho aboard when you already have Chase? I just dont understand it. Use Valley or set him free, is that too much to ask?\n\nOther than that, Boston Legal is its usual loopy self. I wonder if anyone at ABC understands that the show is essentially a comedy - a perverse goof on legal dramas. In the season premiere, Denny Crane meets a woman via online dating whos not what she seems, and Alan Shore defends a cross-dresser who wants to take maternity leave. Of course these bizarre story lines dont make much sense - theyre not meant to. Theyre just an opportunity for Legals David E. Kelley to play around with the rules of the hour-long legal drama, which he does through his acerbic, politically incorrect characters and by having lawyers even address the camera at times (Crane cues the theme music in the shows opening minutes).
