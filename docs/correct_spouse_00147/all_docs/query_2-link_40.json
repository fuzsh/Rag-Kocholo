In Tuesday's episode, the show even adds a new character who is, for all intents and purposed, a clone of ValleyÂs Brad Chase. Chase tells the fast-talking new guy, Jeffrey Coho (Craig Bierko), not to chase the women at the firm, because ÂIÂm that guy.Â Yes, Chase is that guy - why bring Coho aboard when you already have Chase? I just donÂt understand it. Use Valley or set him free, is that too much to ask?\n\nOther than that, ÂBoston LegalÂ is its usual loopy self.

Of course these bizarre story lines donÂt make much sense - theyÂre not meant to. TheyÂre just an opportunity for ÂLegalÂsÂ David E.
