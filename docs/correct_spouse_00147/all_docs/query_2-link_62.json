        "text": "Fox has officially announced its primetime slate for the 2008-09 season which includes two new drama, three new comedies and one unscripted series. It features the anticipated debut of J.J. Abrams’ new drama, “Fringe,” along with comedy “Do Not Disturb.” Joss Whedon’s “Dollhouse” and unscripted series “Secret Millionaire” will premiere midseason:\n\nPeter Liguori, Chairman, Entertainment; and Kevin Reilly, President, Entertainment, Fox Broadcasting Company, today unveiled the FOX primetime schedule for the 2008-2009 television season speaking before the national advertising community at New York City Center.\n\n“Broadcast television needs a jolt. We feel it’s our responsibility, as the No. 1 network for the last four seasons, to provide that electricity,” said Liguori. “The goal of our business is entertaining viewersthey’re our lifeblood, and it’s incumbent upon us to make sure their first and favorite entertainment destination is FOX.”\n\nReilly added, “We’re going to make plenty of noise and yet potentially have more stability and success than we’ve had historically in the fourth quarter. We’ll be focused in the fall with two new series one comedy and one drama and then use our big assets in January to launch an even more powerful second season.”\n\nThe new event drama premiering this fall is FRINGE, a fantastical thriller from acclaimed writer/producer J.J. Abrams (“Lost”), Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (“Star Trek,” “Mission: Impossible III,” “Alias”). Joshua Jackson (“Dawson’s Creek”), John Noble (“Lord of the Rings”) and newcomer Anna Torv star as an unlikely trio who uncover a deadly mystery involving a series of unbelievable events and realize they may be a part of a larger, more disturbing pattern that blurs the line between science fiction and technology.\n\nThe new comedy slated for fall is DO NOT DISTURB (working title), an upstairs/downstairs workplace comedy starring Jerry O’Connell (“Crossing Jordan”) and Niecy Nash (“Reno 911!”) as the management team behind one the hottest and hippest hotels in New York City.\n\nOne additional drama and one unscripted series will launch in midseason. From Joss Whedon, creator of groundbreaking cult favorites “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Firefly,” comes DOLLHOUSE, a gripping, high-action drama starring Eliza Dushku (“Tru Calling”) as Echo, a member of an underground group of “Actives” who have their personalities wiped clean so they can be imprinted with any number of new personas to carry out a variety of missions. The Actives don’t just pretend to be new people they become new people, yet they are never aware they are actually pawns in someone else’s game. SECRET MILLIONAIRE is a heart-warming new unscripted series that focuses on a different millionaire each week, who goes undercover to some of America’s most disadvantaged areas in search of everyday heroes to possibly change their lives forever.\n\nTwo new animated comedies will also join the schedule in the spring. From the creators of FAMILY GUY and AMERICAN DAD, comes THE CLEVELAND SHOW (working title), the story of what happens when FAMILY GUY’s Cleveland Brown moves to Stoolbend, VA, to make good on a promise to his high school sweetheart. SIT DOWN, SHUT UP (working title), created by Emmy Award winner Mitchell Hurwitz (“Arrested Development”), follows a group of unconventional teachers and staff members working at a high school in a small northeastern fishing town who never lose sight of the fact that the students must ALWAYS come second.\n\nFOX kicks off the new season with special two-hour premiere events the week of August 25 including: PRISON BREAK Monday, August 25 (8:00-10:00 PM ET/PT); FRINGE Tuesday, August 26 (8:00-10:00 PM ET/PT); BONES Wednesday, August 27 (8:00-10:00 PM ET/PT) and ARE YOU SMARTER THAN A 5th GRADER?

Abrams (“Lost”), Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, the team behind “Star Trek,” “Mission: Impossible III” and “Alias,” comes a new drama that will thrill, terrify and explore the blurring line between science fiction and reality. When an international flight lands at Boston’s Logan Airport and the passengers and crew have all died grisly deaths, FBI Special Agent OLIVIA DUNHAM (newcomer Anna Torv) is called in to investigate. After her partner, Special Agent JOHN SCOTT (Mark Valley, “Boston Legal”), is nearly killed during the investigation, a desperate Olivia searches frantically for someone to help, leading her to DR. WALTER BISHOP (John Noble, “Lord of the Rings”), our generation’s Einstein. There’s only one catch: he’s been institutionalized for the last 20 years, and the only way to question him requires pulling his estranged son PETER (Joshua Jackson, “Dawson’s Creek”) in to help. When Olivia’s investigation leads her to manipulative corporate executive NINA SHARP (Blair Brown, “Altered States”), our unlikely trio along with fellow FBI Agents PHILLIP BROYLES (Lance Reddick, “The Wire”), CHARLIE FRANCIS (Kirk Acevedo, “Oz”) and ASTRID FARNSWORTH (Jasika Nicole, “Law & Order: Criminal Intent”) will discover that what happened on Flight 627 is only a small piece of a larger, more shocking truth.\n\nPRODUCTION COMPANIES: Warner Bros. Television, Bad Robot Productions\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: J.J. Abrams, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Bryan Burk, Jeff Pinkner, Alex Graves (pilot)\n\nWRITERS: J.J. Abrams, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman\n\nDIRECTOR: Alex Graves\n\nCAST: Anna Torv as Olivia Dunham, Joshua Jackson as Peter Bishop, John Noble as Walter Bishop, Lance Reddick as Phillip Broyles, Kirk Acevedo as Charlie Francis, Mark Valley as John Scott, Blair Brown as Nina Sharp, Jasika Nicole as Astrid Farnsworth\n\nThe new comedy premiering this fall is:\n\nDO NOT DISTURB (working title) (Wednesdays, 9:30-10:00 PM ET/PT): DO NOT DISTURB (working title) is a hilarious workplace comedy set at one of New York City’s hottest and hippest hotels: The Inn. Named one of the Big Apple’s “10 Best Places to Stay,” The Inn is just that the “in” place to be, with its chic dcor, stylish staff and celebrity clientele. Behind the scenes, however, the upstairs/downstairs dynamic tells quite a different story. The hotel’s top-notch reputation and sophisticated look is due in large part to NEAL (Jerry O’Connell, “Crossing Jordan”) at least in his opinion. Although The Inn’s charismatic owner R.J. (guest star Robert Wagner) takes all the credit, Neal is the egotistical, hyper-stylish, detail-oriented general manager who will do whatever it takes to keep the hotel and its employees up to his standards. RHONDA (Niecy Nash, “Reno 911!”) is the head of Human Resources who also keeps Neal’s demands in check. She’s brash, fabulous and brutally honest and runs the HR department from her bullpen downstairs with a set of rules that are all her own. Rhonda does her best to keep the back of the house in line and the front of the house out of trouble. At the front desk handling check-in while wearing 6-inch Manolos is NICOLE (Molly Stanton, “Twins”), an aging model who is svelte, cynical and slightly starving. Fresh from Nebraska is JASON (Brando Eaton, “Zoey 101”), the nave bellman who would prefer to work behind-the-scenes, but was hired to show off his chiseled face and perfect pecs at the front of the hotel. The downstairs staff includes MOLLY (Jolene Purdy, “Donnie Darko”), a reservations clerk who dreams of pop-singer stardom as much as she craves to be part of the action upstairs; and LARRY (Jesse Tyler Ferguson, “The Class”), the head of housekeeping who spends more time on the phone cleaning up his messes at home than he does cleaning up after the guests upstairs.\n\nPRODUCTION COMPANIES: 20th Century Fox Television; Reveille, LLC; Principato-Young Productions\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: Abraham Higginbotham, Howard Owens, Carolyn Bernstein, Paul Young, Peter Principato, Brian Dobbins\n\nWRITER: Abraham Higginbotham\n\nDIRECTOR: Jason Bateman\n\nCAST: Jerry O’Connell as Neal, Niecy Nash as Rhonda, Molly Stanton as Nicole, Jesse Tyler Ferguson as Larry, Brando Eaton as Jason, Jolene Purdy as Molly\n\nGUEST STAR: Robert Wagner as R.J.\n\nThe following new drama is slated for a midseason launch:\n\nDOLLHOUSE (Mondays, 8:00-9:00 PM ET/PT): Joss Whedon, creator of groundbreaking cult favorites “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Firefly,” returns to television and reunites with fellow “Buffy” alumna Eliza Dushku for a thrilling new drama, DOLLHOUSE. ECHO (Dushku) is an “Active,” a member of a highly illegal and underground group who have had their personalities wiped clean so they can be imprinted with any number of new personas. Confined to a secret facility known as the “Dollhouse,” Echo and the other Actives including SIERRA (Dichen Lachman, “Neighbours”) and VICTOR (Enver Gjokaj, “The Unit”) carry out engagements assigned by ADELLE (Olivia Williams, “X-Men: The Last Stand,” “Rushmore”), one of the Dollhouse leaders. The engagements cater to the wealthy, powerful and connected, and require the Actives to immerse themselves in all manner of scenarios romantic, criminal, uplifting, dangerous, comical and the occasional “pro bono” good deed. After each scenario, Echo, always under the watchful eye of her handler BOYD (Harry Lennix, “Commander in Chief,” 24), returns to the mysterious Dollhouse where her thoughts, feelings and experiences are erased by TOPHER (Fran Kranz, “Welcome to the Captain”), the Dollhouse’s genius programmer. Echo enters the next scenario with no memory of before. Or does she? As the series progresses, FBI Agent PAUL SMITH (Tahmoh Penikett, “Battlestar Galactica”) pieces together clues that lead him closer to the Dollhouse, while Echo stops forgetting, her memories begin to return and she slowly pieces together her mysterious past. DOLLHOUSE revolves around Echo’s blossoming self-awareness and her desire to discover her true identity. But with each new engagement, comes a new memory and increased danger inside and outside the Dollhouse.\n\nPRODUCTION COMPANIES: 20th Century Fox Television, Mutant Enemy Inc.\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER/WRITER/DIRECTOR: Joss Whedon\n\nCAST: Eliza Dushku as Echo, Olivia Williams as Adelle, Tahmoh Penikett as Paul, Fran Kranz as Topher, Dichen Lachman as Sierra, Enver Gjokaj as Victor, Harry Lennix as Boyd\n\nThe new unscripted series joining the FOX midseason schedule is:\n\nSECRET MILLIONAIRE (Thursdays, 9:00-10:00 PM ET/PT): SECRET MILLIONAIRE is a dramatic unscripted series that takes America’s wealthiest individuals away from their lavish lifestyles, sprawling mansions and private planes and places them undercover into some of the most impoverished neighborhoods in America. Shot under the guise of a documentary, the series reveals the dramatic personal return that millionaires will get when they leave their fortunes to invest in those less fortunate. Challenged with living on minimum wage, the millionaires will immerse themselves in situations beyond their comprehension. They will work side-by-side with community members and befriend those in need to decide who should ultimately receive their gifts of a lifetime. The millionaires will be touched by the people they meet. Some will inspire with their dedication to helping others, while others will relay stories of overcoming tremendous odds. On the final day, the Secret Millionaires meet with the chosen recipients and reveal their true identity and intention: to give them at least $100,000 oftentimes more of their own money and to change their lives forever. SECRET MILLIONAIRE will engage viewers in important social issues, extol the virtues of volunteerism and change the lives of disadvantaged people and the philanthropists who helped them in unexpected ways.\n\nPRODUCTION COMPANY: RDF USA\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: Chris Coelen, Greg Goldman, Bruce Toms\n\nThe new animated comedies joining the schedule in the spring include:\n\nTHE CLEVELAND SHOW (working title) (Sundays, 9:30-10:00 PM ET/PT): Many years ago, CLEVELAND BROWN (voiced by Mike Henry) was a high school student madly in love with a beautiful girl named DONNA. Much to his dismay, his love went unrequited, and Donna wound up marrying another man. Cleveland once told Donna he would always love her, and if this man ever done her wrong, he’d be there when she called. Well, this man done her wrong. Donna’s husband skipped town with another woman, leaving Donna with a daughter and a baby. Now she’s come to Cleveland and offered him another chance at love. Unattached after the Loretta-Quagmire debacle and true to his word, Cleveland joyously accepts and he and CLEVELAND JR. move to Stoolbend, VA, to join their new family. Once in Stoolbend, Cleveland has a few surprises in store for him, including a flirtatious new stepdaughter, a 5-year-old stepson who loves the ladies, as well as a collection of neighbors that includes a loudmouth redneck couple, a British family seemingly stuck in the Victorian era and a family of bears living at the end of the block. FAMILY GUY was only the beginning. Get ready for THE CLEVELAND SHOW (working title)!\n\nPRODUCTION COMPANY: 20th Century Fox Television\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: Seth MacFarlane, Rich Appel, Mike Henry\n\nVOICE CAST: Mike Henry as Cleveland Brown\n\nSIT DOWN, SHUT UP (working title) (Sundays, 8:30-9:00 PM ET/PT): From Emmy Award-winning writer Mitchell Hurwitz (“Arrested Development”) and Eric and Kim Tannenbaum (“Two and a Half Men”) comes SIT DOWN, SHUT UP (working title), an animated comedy that focuses on the lives of eight staff members at a high school in a small northeastern fishing town (Go Baiters!) who never lose sight of the fact that the children must ALWAYS come second. We watch them grapple with their own egos, needs and personal agendas, their petty insecurities and prejudices, unrequited loves, and ruthless battles for power and that’s just at the staff meeting. SUE SEZNO (Kenan Thompson, “Saturday Night Live”), a woman who frequently says “no,” is the acting principal of the school (the actual principal is recovering from a series of unfortunate accidents that might be seen as escape attempts). Then there’s Vice Principal STUART PROZACKIAN (Will Forte, “Saturday Night Live”) who has a terrifically positive and upbeat attitude… possibly from the performance-enhancing medication he’s been secretly put on by the other teachers. There is one educator who feels the focus should be on academics, but despite the old adage, at this school, those who can teach, teach gym and that’s where LARRY SLIMP (Jason Bateman, “Juno,” “Arrested Development”) has been exiled to. Immensely frustrated, Larry nurses a crush on science teacher MIRACLE GROHE (Maria Bamford, “Stuart Little 2”), a woman whose superficial grasp on science is balanced by her superficial grasp on spirituality. Rounding out the staff is the aging German teacher WILLARD DEUTSCHEBOG (Henry Winkler, “Arrested Development,” “Happy Days”), a deeply defeated man whose yearbook quotation reads “If I believed in reincarnation, I’d kill myself tonight.” Uptight HELEN KLENCH (Cheri Oteri, “Saturday Night Live”) is a librarian whose life’s work in research and archiving can now be surpassed by the average Google search from the average cell phone. Proud ANDREW SAPIEN (Nick Kroll, “Best Week Ever,” “Cavemen”) is the flamboyant drama teacher. ENNIS HOFFTARD (Will Arnett, “Arrested Development”) is a fellow teacher and a self-obsessed body builder who yearns to be thought of as a “cool dude” by his students. And finally there’s HAPPY (Tom Kenny, “SpongeBob SquarePants”), the plotting secretive custodian who’s assumed to be Hispanic despite the fact that his real name is Muhannad Sabeeh Fa’ach Nuaba. With a distinctive new look a combination of animation against a live-action backdrop SIT DOWN, SHUT UP is a series for the young and old at heart. It lampoons modern society while exposing the dreams, flaws and struggling humanity of our first and most formative authority figures: teachers.\n\nPRODUCTION COMPANIES: Sony Pictures Television, 20th Century Fox Television, Granada America, Tantamount\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: Mitchell Hurwitz, Eric Tannenbaum, Kim Tannenbaum, Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein\n\nCAST: Will Arnett as Ennis, Maria Bamford as Miracle, Jason Bateman as Larry, Will Forte as Stuart, Tom Kenny as Happy, Nick Kroll as Andrew, Cheri Oteri as Helen, Kenan Thompson as Sue, Henry Winkler as Willard"
