It's over between Fringe star Anna Torv and husband Mark Valley.

The couple separated a few months ago, their rep confirms to UsMagazine.com. They married in a quiet, small wedding in December 2008.

Australia-born Torv, 31 and Valley, 45, played lovers and fellow FBI agents in early episodes of Fringe; Valley now headlines the Fox series Human Target.
