Mark Valley has revealed that his wife Anna Torv is too busy to appear on Human Target.

The duo previously appeared together on Fringe, which Torv still toplines as Olivia Dunham.

Asked if they may reunite on Valley's Target, he replied: "Fringe just got picked up for another season. You're going to have to ask her but she's probably pretty busy with Fringe."

Valley and Torv married in December 2008.
