Anna Torv and Mark Valley co-star on Fringe… and in the bedroom!

It’s been confirmed that the couple secretly married late last year. The ceremony took place in December.

Torv portrays FBI Special Agent Olivia Dunham on the FOX drama, while Vallery took on the role of agent John Scott, who may or may not be deceased. (It’s a complicated show.)
