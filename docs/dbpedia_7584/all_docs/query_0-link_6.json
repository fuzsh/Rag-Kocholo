        "text": "Introduction\n\nA key landlocked country in central Europe, Switzerland is bordered on the north by Germany, on the east by Austria and the tiny principality of Liechtenstein, on the south by Italy, and on the west by France. Its north-south maximum extent is about 140 miles (220 kilometers), while its east-west stretch is roughly 225 miles (360 kilometers). The capital is Bern. Area 15,943 square miles (41,291 square kilometers). Population (2024 est.) 8,932,000.\n\nSwitzerland is a major watershed that is drained to the North Sea by the Rhine River and to the western Mediterranean Sea by the Rhône River. It is drained to the Adriatic Sea by way of the Ticino River, and to the east by the Inn River. The waters of this magnificent country are almost as famous as its snowcapped mountains. Among the better-known lakes are Geneva, Constance, Neuchâtel, Lucerne, Zürich, and Maggiore.\n\nSwitzerland has fashioned unity and prosperity out of diverse linguistic groups and varied religions. It is one of the world’s oldest stable democracies, an excellent example of a developed country.\n\nLand and Climate\n\nLandform Regions\n\nSwitzerland has some of the highest mountains in Europe. The Alps make up the country’s main terrain region, covering more than half of its land area. This complicated zone is formed by the Bernese, Pennine, Lepontine, and Rhaetian mountain systems. The Alps extend from France on the west to Germany and Austria on the north and east and into Italy on the south. A notable peak is the Dufourspitze of Monte Rosa, a mountain with several summits, on the Switzerland-Italy border. At 15,203 feet (4,634 meters), it is Switzerland’s highest point. The region’s chief mountain passes are the Simplon, Furka, and St. Gotthard. Two other famous peaks in the Alps are the Jungfrau near Interlaken and the Matterhorn near Zermatt.\n\nThe Jura Mountains, covering about an eighth of the country’s land, are a lower and less rugged system of mountain ranges. They lie along the France-Switzerland border. Altitudes vary from 3,000 to 5,600 feet (900 to 1,700 meters). The ridges have relatively few natural interruptions, however, and they are therefore a notable barrier to settlement and movement. Like the Alps region, the Jura area is sparsely populated.\n\nThe Mittelland is a plateau of central Switzerland with an average elevation of 1,500 feet (460 meters). It occupies nearly a quarter of the country’s land. It is a region of gently rolling hills and valleys formed by glaciers thousands of years ago. It extends from Lake Geneva on the southwest to Lake Constance on the northeast, where Germany, Austria, and Switzerland meet. Most of Switzerland’s cities and economic activities are in the Mittelland.\n\nClimate\n\nThe temperatures of Switzerland are particularly varied. Subtropical palm trees are found along the lakes in the south on the border with Italy, while permanent snow and ice (glaciers) are found in the high Alps at heights above 10,000 feet (3,000 meters), depending on altitude and exposure. The climate of the Mittelland is transitional between that of continental eastern Europe and the maritime west. Outside the mountain regions summers are relatively cool, with average monthly temperatures below 70 °F (21 °C). January temperatures are well below the freezing level. Bern, the capital city, has an average annual precipitation of approximately 40 inches (102 centimeters). Local winds are also a climatic element. The cold wind called the Bise is characteristic of Geneva, while the foehn, a warm wind, occurs in the valleys of the northern Alps.\n\nPlants and Animals\n\nAs the climate varies, so does the original vegetation. It is affected most by altitude. Deciduous trees (which lose their leaves seasonally) and evergreen trees rise to the snow line. Above that level mountain meadows and tundra dominate the landscape. Forests are one of Switzerland’s treasures.\n\nThe forests are home to deer, rabbits, foxes, badgers, squirrels, and many varieties of birds, including eagles. In the Alps live marmots (giant ground squirrels) and the goatlike animals called chamois. Wild goats called ibex had died out in the Swiss Alps but were later reintroduced to many areas.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nMost of the major cultural regions of western continental Europe—German, French, and Italian—come into contact in Switzerland. Thus, one of the country’s distinctive features is the variety of its languages. Most of the population speaks German, but people speaking French and Italian also form large groups. Those three languages are the country’s official languages. A smaller number of people speak the Romance language Romansh, which has a more-limited official status. Many people in Switzerland speak a nonofficial language, such as Croatian, Portuguese, Serbian, and Spanish.\n\nSwitzerland also has considerable religious diversity. Roman Catholics slightly outnumber Protestants. There is a small but significant Muslim population—mainly of Turkish or Balkan origin—and a tiny Jewish community.\n\nSwitzerland has a high population density, especially in the Mittelland. The country has become increasingly urbanized since World War II, though roughly a quarter of the people still live in rural areas. Only a limited number of these rural dwellers are farmers. The largest cities in Switzerland are Zürich, Geneva, Basel, Lausanne, and the capital, Bern.\n\nEducation and Health\n\nSwitzerland boasts universal literacy—in other words, virtually all the adults can read and write. The country has an excellent school system administered at the canton (state) level. Education is free and compulsory between the ages of 7 and 16. The majority of students continue their education with vocational training, technical schools, or higher secondary schools. There are many universities and technical institutes in Switzerland. The oldest is the University of Basel, which was founded in 1460. Also prominent are the Universities of Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, and Zürich. The high quality of Swiss elementary and secondary education is attributed in part to the teachings of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, an educational reformer of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. There is a clear commitment on the part of the Swiss to devote a major share of their resources to all branches of education.\n\nSwitzerland’s social welfare system is comprehensive and contains provisions for free subsidized health care, including maternity benefits. The state also provides old-age pensions and long-term nursing care. The cantons share with the federal government and the trade unions the costs of the welfare system. Excellent medical coverage and a high standard of living have combined to give the Swiss among the highest average life expectancies in the world.\n\nCultural Life\n\nSwitzerland can be proud of its contributions to the arts and sciences. Many Swiss artists have chosen to live abroad, particularly among their linguistic counterparts in neighboring France and Germany. Yet Switzerland has always been a haven for foreign artists, writers, and scholars in times of war and unrest. The mid-1840s was such a period, and the 1930s and 1940s brought writers such as the German novelist Thomas Mann and the Italian author Ignazio Silone.\n\nIn the 20th century Le Corbusier created an international school of architecture that for a time dominated building trends in Europe, the United States, and Latin America. Modern Swiss artists of international reputation include the sculptor Alberto Giacometti and the painter Paul Klee. The dramatists Friedrich Dürrenmatt and Max Frisch are world renowned, and their plays have been translated into many foreign languages. Among famous writers of Swiss birth were the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the historian Jakob Burckhardt. Popular authors Johanna Spyri and Johann Wyss wrote Heidi and The Swiss Family Robinson, respectively. Switzerland was also the home of the noted psychologist Carl Jung. Albert Einstein was educated in Switzerland and spent a portion of his adult life there.\n\nAlthough the country has not been a leading music center, the 20th-century composers Arthur Honegger and Frank Martin received worldwide recognition. Igor Stravinsky spent most of the World War I years in Switzerland. Notable Swiss performers were the pianist Edwin Fischer and the conductor Ernest Ansermet, who founded the Swiss French Orchestra in Geneva in 1918. Today, Switzerland has many major orchestras. Among the country’s leading music festivals are the International Festival of Music, which is a classical event held in late summer in Lucerne, and the annual Montreux Jazz Festival.\n\nThe number of Swiss scientists who have been awarded the Nobel Prize is remarkable considering the small population. The Federal Institutes of Technology have also produced many award-winning scholars.\n\nEconomy\n\nSwitzerland has a highly developed market-oriented economy based on manufacturing and services such as international trade, shipping, banking, insurance, and tourism. The country has kept unemployment low and has achieved one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.\n\nDespite Switzerland’s limited supply of raw materials, its economy has prospered. This prosperity can be attributed to abundant hydroelectric power, a central position on international trade routes, and a skilled labor force.\n\nAgriculture\n\nSwitzerland’s rugged terrain limits the land available for growing crops. Agriculture accounts for only a very small portion of the country’s income and jobs. The leading agricultural activity is cattle raising. Switzerland exports milk and other dairy products throughout Europe. There is considerable regional diversity in crops, ranging from the irrigated horticulture of the southwest to the modified Mediterranean crops of the south. The leading crops include sugar beets, wheat, potatoes, and hardy fruits. The production of wine is basically for domestic consumption. Food industries, based on the country’s milk production, focus on cheese (Emmentaler and Gruyère) and chocolate products.\n\nManufacturing\n\nManufacturing is an important part of Switzerland’s economy. The country’s transformation into an industrial state began during the late 19th century. Its major exports now include machinery, watches, pharmaceutical products, chemicals, and textiles. Many industries must import raw and semifinished materials by costly overland routes. Only the notable quality of its manufactured goods permits Switzerland to remain competitive. Leading manufacturing sectors include the production of turbines, generators, watches, precision instruments, textiles, chemicals, and foodstuffs. Zürich and Basel are the chief manufacturing centers, but industrial plants are scattered throughout the Mittelland—even within the rural countryside.\n\nMining and Energy\n\nSwitzerland’s mineral resources are limited. There are small iron and manganese deposits in the Jura but no known deposits of coal. A variety of materials is worthy of commercial exploitation. Among them are lime, salt, sand, gravel, clay, and marble.\n\nSwitzerland’s lack of mineral resources is largely counterbalanced by its greatest asset—waterpower—which is harnessed by huge dams that produce hydroelectricity for industry. Hydroelectric power supplies about a sixth of the country’s energy needs. Nuclear power plants provide about a quarter of Switzerland’s energy.. For much of its energy, however, Switzerland relies on thermal power plants that use imported fuels.\n\nServices\n\nSwitzerland has a large and highly developed service sector, which provides most of the country’s income and jobs. High-tech and communications industries are at the forefront of Swiss economic development. Retail trade and business-related services are also important parts of the service sector. Switzerland’s noted banking system and its reputation for financial secrecy have made it a key center of international finance. Foreign investors are drawn to Swiss banks by the country’s economic stability, the solid Swiss franc, and the long experience of Swiss bankers. Many domestic and foreign fortunes are invested in Swiss banks.\n\nSwitzerland is one of the world’s leading tourist centers. Its visitors bring in huge revenues to the economy. Tourism is a year-round industry, with a seasonal shift in activities from winter to summer. Winter sports include skiing, sledding, tobogganing, and ice skating. The leading winter resorts are St-Moritz, Gstaad, and Interlaken. All three are world renowned. Summers bring golf, boating, swimming, hiking, and climbing. Many people in Switzerland are employed in hotels, inns, spas, and restaurants. The Swiss are world famous for their hospitality and the quality of their cuisine.\n\nTransportation\n\nFor centuries land transportation routes have traversed Switzerland because it is an international crossroads. Because of the rugged terrain, hundreds of bridges and tunnels have had to be built, particularly through the Alps. Some of the tunnels are among the longest in Europe. The Gotthard Base Tunnel, which runs more than 35 miles (57 kilometers) under St. Gotthard Pass in the Swiss Alps, was the world’s longest rail tunnel when it opened in 2016. Several international railways pass through Switzerland. All of the key rail lines are double-tracked, and since the 1960s the entire system has been electrified. Highways and highway tunnels are among the best in the world, connecting all key urban centers and roads that lead to Switzerland’s neighbors. Basel, the country’s chief port on the Rhine, handles millions of tons of goods, which are typically bulk imports that feed Swiss industries. The main international airports are in Geneva and Zürich.\n\nGovernment\n\nSwitzerland is a federal republic. Its official name is the Swiss Confederation. The country is a confederation, or union, of 26 states called cantons. These in turn are divided into more than 3,000 communes, or municipalities, for local government. The federal government supervises the country’s security, transportation, forestry, and water conservation. It also is responsible for foreign policy, the monetary system, the military, and social insurance programs. The cantons have broad authority for self-government, possessing all powers not specifically given to the federal government. Education and health policies are largely determined by the cantons. Each canton has its own its own constitution and legislative assembly. The communes are responsible for their own public utilities and roads and, like the cantons, are largely autonomous, or self-governing.\n\nIn the federal government, legislative power is the responsibility of the dual-chamber Federal Assembly. One chamber consists of 200 representatives chosen by the electorate for four-year terms. The other chamber is the Council of States, which has 46 representatives who are selected directly by the cantons. Each canton sends either one or two representatives, but the mode of their election and the terms of their service depend on the laws of the individual cantons.\n\nFederal executive power is in the hands of the Federal Council, which is chosen by the assembly. The council consists of seven members elected for four-year terms, and they act as a cabinet. One of the members of the council is chosen as president but serves for only one year. The president’s powers are therefore extremely limited.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of Switzerland’s constitution is the number of decisions it requires citizens to make through referenda and initiatives. Power ultimately rests with the people, who vote on proposed legislation several times a year at the national level and often more frequently in the cantons. In fact, Switzerland has held more than half of the world’s national referenda. In addition to referenda, Swiss citizens can call a national vote on any issue by collecting 100,000 signatures. More than any other country, Switzerland has provided citizens with a direct voice in their own affairs. This system has sometimes been criticized, however, on various grounds. Voter turnout is often very low, and the system often makes the passage of important legislation difficult. For example, the Federal Assembly passed a law granting women the right to vote in 1959, but voters did not approve the change at the federal level until 1971.\n\nHistory\n\nSettlements of hunters, fishers, gatherers, and agriculturists occupied Switzerland in prehistoric times. The Stone Age dwellers, of whom there are archaeological records, made their homes around Switzerland’s lakes.\n\nA Celtic people known as the Helvetii (Helvetians) lived in what is now western Switzerland, while the Raetians controlled the east. The Romans conquered both territories in the 1st century bc and remained in firm control for four centuries, using garrisons stationed in strategic mountain passes. From the 3rd through the 6th century the region was settled by a host of Germanic tribes, one succeeding another. A century later missionaries converted the population to Christianity.\n\nMuch of what is now Switzerland became part of the Holy Roman Empire during the 11th century. Between the 13th and the 15th century various administrative units known as cantons formed a loose confederation, which gradually grew to today’s borders.\n\nIn the 16th century Switzerland was the focus of the Protestant Reformation, and the cantons split along religious lines. One of the greatest political and religious leaders of the Reformation was John Calvin. His success lay in his extraordinary ability to combine extreme political convictions with administrative talent. Calvin made much of Switzerland a tower of Protestant strength. Both civil and secular law were dominated by Calvin’s preachings. His religious base was Geneva, but his ideas spread rapidly to Scotland, the Netherlands, and even to southern France. Another famous religious leader was Huldrych Zwingli, who preached in Zürich and led the Protestants in an extended civil war with their Roman Catholic neighbors.\n\nSwitzerland’s secession from the Holy Roman Empire was recognized by the Treaty of Westphalia, which followed the Thirty Years’ War early in the 17th century. The desire for independence ultimately overshadowed religious conflict, and the new state soon regained political stability. There was an intellectual flourishing of literature and philosophy in centers such as Geneva, Basel, Bern, and Zürich. During the Napoleonic era that followed, Switzerland was occupied by the French, who imposed their institutions on the country. This ended with the defeat of the French and the convening of the Congress of Vienna in 1815, which guaranteed Swiss neutrality for the foreseeable future. The desire for independence may have led ultimately to the Swiss focus on defense, which even today consumes significant expenditures of human and monetary resources.\n\nIn the century that followed, the Swiss Confederation experienced growing prosperity. Of significance was the textile industry—wool, cotton, linen, and silk goods—which flourished in Zürich and Basel. The Swiss watch industry also had its beginnings at this time.\n\nSwitzerland remained neutral through the Franco-Prussian War and the two world wars. The country thus gained the respect of the world as a peaceful and tolerant nation. It has welcomed refugees from war and persecution, and its people have led world humanitarian and peace efforts. Originally the site of the League of Nations, Switzerland is currently one of several United Nations (UN) headquarters. After years of resistance, the country joined the UN in 2002.\n\nSwitzerland has often been the site of prestigious international conferences. While it has refused to join the European Union (EU) or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Switzerland has joined the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the Council of Europe. In 2008 Switzerland signed the Schengen Agreement, which allows people to travel between the European member countries without a passport. Switzerland also maintained strong economic ties with the EU, which was by far its largest trading partner."
