ZÃ¼rich â See the Historic Sites in Beautiful Winter Scenery\n\nZÃ¼rich is in high tourism season in December. Many tourists arrive to transfer to other places since it is the main travel hub with the biggest international airport. The daily average highs are 8Â°C (47Â°F), and the average lows are just above freezing.\n\nYou could sightsee the Old City area or shop. The big highlights are the Christmas markets and festivities with traditional Swiss food, crafts, and entertainment. These rev up after about the middle of the month. You could watch the New Year's Eve fireworks over the lake.\n\nSince there is an average of 2 hours of sunshine daily, 12 days of rain or snow, and 85% humidity, expect freezing, damp, and gloomy weather. When the weather is inclement, you could enjoy some of the country's best museums, shopping, and gourmet restaurants.\n\nFor more things to do, see visiting Switzerland in March.\n\n2. Zermatt â For Snow, Winter Sports, and Holiday Festivities\n\nZermatt is Europe's winter sports capital because it has the Switzerland's best ski slopes. The highest ski slope reaches up to altitude 3,899 meters (12,792 feet). Zermatt's average high is 2Â°C (35Â°F). The nightly lows are around -6Â°C (21Â°F). There are 2Â½ hours of sunshine and low rainfall and snowfall on average.\n\nFor skiing and snowboarding, the high-elevation slopes around Zermatt are among the best in Switzerland in December. The snow quality is good and the crowds are relatively light. The town is beautifully decorated. During Christmas, there are large crowds.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, there is a spectacular fireworks display, and the spectacle of colorful lights sparkling off the shiny white cliffs and slopes. A ban on cars keeps the sky pristine and makes for better walking and shopping experiences.\n\n3. Basel â See the Holiday Artwork and Enjoy a Less Touristy City\n\nBasel is a multicultural city near the border of Germany and France. It is called the 'Arts Capital' in Switzerland, and the Christmas decorations are artsy.\n\nThe average highs are slightly warmer than Switzerland's average at 6Â°C (Â°F), and the lows are 32Â°C (0Â°F). There is moderate rainfall about half the days of December. When the weather is good, you could explore the cobbled streets of the Old Town, one of the most intact and beautiful in Europe with unparalleled architectural diversity from the 15th century to the present. The museums are good.\n\nOne Christmas Market is next to the Basler MÃ¼nster Cathedral with a Fairy Tale Forest. Another is near the BarfÃ¼sserplatz. Both are open all of December until the 23rd when they close.\n\nFor more about things to do in Basel, see visiting Switzerland in September.\n\n4. Interlaken â Enjoy Another Winter Sports Capital\n\nDecember is generally thought to be the best month to visit Interlaken and the nearby Lauterbrunnen and LÃ¼tschental areas due to the rich local culture and traditions for the Christmas holidays. The towns are beautifully decorated.\n\nYou can experience the festivities, the Christmas markets, and the holiday events. However, Interlaken may be crowded with holiday tourists. Interlaken is the travel hub for the area that has the train and tram stations. You could go up to the ski resorts to ski.\n\nThe average high in December is 4Â°C (39Â°F), and the average nightly low is -2Â°C (28Â°F). There is moderate rainfall, and on average, it rains about 10 days in December.

As the month progresses, the temperatures fall. The beginning of ski season brings in more tourists, and the end of the month is the peak tourism season of the Christmas and New Year holidays.\n\nTo save some money, you might want to tour in the beginning of the month. You may find discounted accommodations, flights, and activities with fewer other tourists.\n\nAround the middle of the month, the popular Christmas festivals and markets are in high gear. By staying in a city for a day or two, you can experience the festivities and shop.\n\nExpect to pay peak-season prices in late December. Arrange accommodations and transportation tickets well in advance. The last two weeks of December are among Switzerland's busiest.\n\nEach canton sets its own holidays and observances.\n\nPublic holidays in December:\n\nImmaculate Conception is December 8 annually.

A warm coat and rain gear will help you to be prepared for every circumstance.\n\nHere is a packing list for a few essentials in Switzerland:\n\nWarm hat\n\nComfortable shoes with good traction\n\nWarm waterproof boots with good traction.
