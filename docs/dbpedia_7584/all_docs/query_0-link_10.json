        "text": "The climate of Switzerland\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification four climate types can be observed within Switzerland. The highest regions have a high mountain climate (type EH), the medium-high areas have a cold continental climate (Dfd). The lower parts in the north western part of the country have a moderate continental climate (type Dfb). The most southern tip of Ticino (Lugano and Chiasso) bordering Italy has a Mediterranean climate or a warm sea climate (type Cfa) with mild winters and warm summers. Most people think of Switzerland as a mountainous and snowy country and mistakenly assume it is always cold here. During the winter weather conditions are wintry and cold. However, when spring starts snow melts and temperatures rise to pleasant figures.\n\nClimate information of places and areas in Switzerland\n\nThe climate information given on this page is only brief. Specific information on weather and climate can be found on the pages per region or city. The following climate information is available for Switzerland:\n\nArosa\n\nBasel/Basle\n\nBern\n\nChiasso\n\nCrans-Montana\n\nDavos\n\nEngelberg\n\nGeneva Graubünden/Grisons\n\nGrindelwald\n\nLausanne\n\nLocarno\n\nLugano\n\nLucerne\n\nMontreux\n\nNeuchâtel Saas-Fee\n\nSt. Moritz\n\nVerbier\n\nValais\n\nWengen\n\nWinterthur\n\nZermatt\n\nZürich\n\nSummer in Switzerland\n\nIn general, summers in Switzerland are warm with maximum temperatures of 20-25 degrees Celsius on average all summer long. The higher mountainous areas are colder. In some regions in Graubünden and Valais temperatures are 10-15 degrees Celsius during the day. On the highest peaks temperatures hardly rise above freezing point and eternal snow and ice can be found. Because of global warming the total amount of square kilometers of perpetual snow and ice have been declined by tens of percents over the last 30 years. In total about 2,000 square kilometers of Switzerland are covered with glaciers or perpetual snow. The area on the south side of the Alps where you can find places such as Lugano, Locarno and Chiasso even has the characteristics of a Mediterranean climate. Especially on the lakes it feels more like you are on the Mediterranean Sea than in Switzerland.\n\nWinter\n\nDuring the winter large parts of Switzerland are cold and gray. In mountainous areas above 2,000-2,500 meters the climate is often bleak. In the Alps and Jura subzero temperatures can be recorded 24 hours per day and reasonable amounts of snow fall. When a depression remains stationary tens of centimeters of snow may fall within 24 hours. From December till April the most popular winter sports destinations are covered in a thick blanket of snow. Snowfall also may cause dangerous situations. When fresh snow falls on top of an old layer of snow chances of avalanches increase rapidly. Off-piste skiing may be very dangerous then.\n\nPrecipitation\n\nSwitzerland is one of the wettest countries in Europe. When depressions are pushed against the mountains they will cause rain to fall. This type of precipitation induced by orographic lift causes the Alps and Jura to be wet. Most of the rain falls on the peaks of the Alps. The Jura and the west and north sides of the Alps get a little less precipitation. The central part of Switzerland is lower and drier because the mountains prevent rain from reaching this region. The wettest parts of Switzerland get more than 2,000 millimeters of annual rain, a reasonable amount of which falls in the form of snow. Switzerland gets 1,100-1,500 millimeters of annual precipitation on average evenly spread out over the year with a small peak during summer.\n\nClimate figures\n\nThe figures below are based on long term weather and climate records. They can be seen as an average for Switzerland. The climate records shown are for the lower parts of Switzerland (<1,000 meters) which can be found in the west, north and the Ticino canton (Lugano, Locarno and Chiasso) on the south side of the Alps. The higher regions (>1,000 meters) get less sunshine, are colder and annual precipitation is spread out differently.\n\naverage\n\nmaximum\n\ntemperature (°C)\n\naverage\n\nminimum\n\ntemperature (°C) average\n\nhours of sunshine\n\nper day average days with precipitation\n\nper month average\n\nmm precipitation\n\nper month average\n\nsea\n\ntemperature (°C) January 1 -4 2 15 n/a February 4 -2 3 14 n/a March 9 0 4 15 n/a April 14 3 5 16 n/a May 19 8 6 18 n/a June 22 11 7 17 n/a July 24 14 7 18 n/a August 23 13 6 19 n/a September 20 10 5 14 n/a October 13 5 3 12 n/a November 7 1 2 15 n/a December 3 -2 1 14 n/a = 0-5 mm ● = 6-30 mm ● = 31-60 mm ● = 61-100 mm ● = 101-200 mm ● = over 200 mm\n\n= 0-0.2 inches ● = 0.2-1.2 inches ● = 1.2-2.4 inches ● = 2.5-4 inches ● = 4.1-8 inches ● = over 8 inches\n\nMore climate information\n\nClimate tables are useful but they dont give an overall picture of the climate and possible weather conditions during a period of time. How high the chances are of hot or cold weather or hurricanes can often not be found in these tables. This is why we offer extra climate information per month. The information below is an average for Switzerland with the exception of Alpine areas higher than 1,000 meters. Higher areas get less sunshine and have a higher chance of wintry weather.\n\nchance of\n\n(very) hotweather\n\nchance of\n\n(very) cool\n\nweather chance of\n\nlong-termprecipitation chance of\n\nhurricanes\n\n(cyclones) chance of\n\nsunny days\n\nUV-index\n\nJanuary February March April May June July August September October November December click here for the explanation of the symbols"
