I assume it could vary from a cold snap to fairly pleasant weather like anywhere else in spring, but for the most part I'm thinking it will be cold.\n\nIs snow typically on the ground all over the place or mostly located in higher elevations? Does it melt and get everything messy around that time of year?\n\nAny places better to go to than others?\n\nI have no problem with the weather, just trying to get a feel for Switzerland.\n\nThanks!"
