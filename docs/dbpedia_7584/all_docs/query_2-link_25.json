        "text": "The Swiss federal government has issued a snow warning for Thursday, November 30, 2023. It is expected that snow will fall down to 400 meters (1,300 feet), with the northern cantons of the country being particularly affected. The cantons of Aargau, Zurich, Thurgau, Solothurn, and parts of the canton of Bern could be affected by considerable danger (level 3). The warning applies to all altitudes from 00:00 a.m. on Thursday until 6:00 p.m.\n\nThe federal government is warning that there may be restrictions in road, rail, and air transport. Anyone in the affected regions should take precautions and limit travel where possible. It is advised to avoid forest areas as there is a risk that branches will snap and trees will fall over under the snow load. Please ensure you keep up-to-date with current traffic situations and observe the instructions of the cantonal winter services departments.\n\nMeteoSwiss, the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology, estimated that between 8 – 15 centimeters (3 – 6 inches) of snow will fall above 400 meters and around 10 – 20 centimeters (4 – 8 inches) above 600 meters (1,970 feet). Snowfalls are expected to be strongest between 3 a.m. and 12 noon on Thursday, November 30.\n\n“The first measurable snow in the lowlands falls on average at the end of November. In the low-lying areas of western and northwestern Switzerland, the snowpack does not start to form until the beginning of December. So far, the global warming of the last few decades has not yet resulted in the first measurable snow being delayed.”\n\n— MeteoSwiss"
