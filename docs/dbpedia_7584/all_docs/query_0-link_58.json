During its 150-yr history, the Canadian Meteorological Service has employed a number of different precipitation gauges to measure rainfall. This paper will focus on documenting the types of gauges used in rainfall measurement over this period. Systematic errors in gauge catch such as wetting loss, wind-induced error, and trace precipitation, which are a result of method of observation and/or gauge design, have been quantified through field and laboratory experiments. A proposed method of adjusting six hourly archived rainfall data (i.e., 1947–present) to provide a compatible and consistent rainfall record is described. The combined magnitude of the adjustments for the systematic errors quantified for certain standard raingauges can exceed 7%. Results indicate that scientists assessing climate change by using monthly correction factors to adjust precipitation may not be accounting for all significant biases in Canadian rainfall data.",

        "text": "a. Rainfall amount\n\nIn 1971 the 22nd session of the Executive Committee of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) commented that any precipitation gauge installed at some height above the ground is an obstacle to the wind and induces disturbances in the airflow. These disturbances distort the trajectories of the falling precipitation particles, with the result that raingauges catch less precipitation than their surrounding area. The WMO committee recommended that a quantitative estimate of the wind-induced deficiencies in the catch of an official national gauge could be obtained from measurements of a reference gauge installed in a pit with its orifice at ground level (i.e., pit gauge). This technique assumes that a grid around the gauge prevents splash-in. From 1972 to 1976 three such intercomparison sites (i.e., Estevan, Saskatchewan; Mount Forest, Ontario; Truro, Nova Scotia) were operated in three quite different climatic regions of Canada. At each site MSC, Type-B and pit gauges (with Type-B) were installed. Goodison and Louie (1986) reported preliminary results from this comparison, and although this report provided some basic information on the potential magnitude of the systematic errors compared to the reference pit gauge for the three climatic regions, no interpretation of the differences was attempted.\n\nBoth the MSC and Type-B gauges are mounted relatively low to the ground to reduce the effect of wind on gauge catch. The Type-B gauge was designed to minimize systematic errors, particularly losses due to adhesion of water to the gauge surface, evaporation between measurement periods, and splash out. On-going intercomparison of Environment Canada raingauges at the Centre for Atmospheric Research (CARE) near Toronto, Ontario, confirms that the systematic difference between the Type-B gauge and the pit gauge is about −2% at an open windy site (Table 1).\n\nThe conversion factor k′ is defined as the ratio of the amount of precipitation measured in two gauges with different aerodynamical properties. The symbol Pgn is used to identify a particular national gauge. Therefore, the relationship of the present national gauge, the Type-B gauge (Pgn3), to the previous national gauge, the MSC gauge with plastic insert (Pgn2), is expressed as A comparison of mean monthly k′ for the three sites involved in the 1972–76 intercomparison, as well as CARE and Bell Lake, Manitoba, a site operated by Manitoba Natural Resources at Porcupine Mountain Provincial Park, is shown in Fig. 2. The relationship is very consistent at all the sites, with the average mean monthly K′ being 1.05. This difference does not consider any adjustments due to wetting loss. The larger standard deviation in the mean at Bell Lake is probably due to the nonstandard observing times at this station inducing significantly more evaporation error. The results indicate a difference significantly larger than that reported earlier (Goodison and Louie 1986).\n\nWetting loss is defined as water subject to evaporation from the surface of the funnel and the inner walls of the precipitation gauge. This includes water retained after a precipitation event and water remaining on the walls of the gauge and its containers after emptying. Laboratory experiments and field investigations have shown that wetting losses for the MSC gauge can be quite large. The average wetting loss for the MSC gauge used prior to 1965 (i.e., all copper inserts) is 0.17 mm per observation. The average wetting loss for the post 1965 period when the plastic insert was used is 0.14 mm (Table 2).\n\nA gauge of the type used in Canada prior to 1930 was not available for comparison testing, but recent, crude experiments indicated that sheet metal and copper have similar water retention capabilities. However, Austin (1949) reported that copper gauges are smoother and retain less water than galvanized iron gauges. Also, in instances where sections of gauges were painted, lacquered, or shellacked in an attempt to provide a perfectly smooth runoff surface, it was found that retention losses were even greater due to a clinging effect (British Rainfall Organization 1929). These earlier studies suggest that wetting losses and therefore gauge undermeasurement, for gauges used in Canada prior to 1930, could have been larger than for the period following 1930.\n\nAlthough it is estimated that evaporative loss can also be significant for this gauge, it is difficult to measure. For example, daily average evaporation estimates for the United States 8-in. raingauge of 0.25–0.50 mm were suggested by Carter (1929) for Nebraska. However, for Canadian principal and synoptic stations raingauge evaporation is probably quite small since observations are made at shorter intervals (6 h) than at climatological stations (8–24 h). Preliminary estimates from on-going field experiments indicate that evaporation rates from the MSC gauge average about 0.01 mm h−1, while from the Type-B gauge evaporation is negligible. Figure 3 compares the catch of the MSC, with plastic insert, and Type-B raingauges to the pit gauge at CARE and also shows the effect of correcting the MSC gauge for wetting loss after each measurement. Even with correction for wetting loss the MSC gauge measured an average of 5% less than the pit gauge. CARE is a climate station that makes two observations per day (i.e., a.m. and p.m.). There is a noticeable difference in measured MSC totals compared to the pit gauge between morning and afternoon observations. The lower ratio for the pm observation could be due to evaporation, but this has not been confirmed yet by any experimental studies.\n\nThere is concern that the spatial variability of rainfall can cause significant differences to occur between gauges of a similar design type, even over a small area. A 5-yr study of three Type-B raingauges (Pgn1, Pgn2, Pgn3) located at Environment Canada’s Downsview facility and positioned in a 1-m triangle indicated a mean absolute difference (MAD) expressed as where N = 547 of 0.09 mm between the gauges for 547 observations. The intercomparison studies of MSC and Type-B gauges found mean absolute differences that are typically about 0.31 mm or three times larger than the same difference found in the spatial variability test. Thus, within a controlled intercomparison site, measurement differences due to the relative placement of the gauges are not considered to be significant, and the differences in the measurements are primarily attributed to the gauge fabrication and design affecting their efficiency.\n\nb. Rate of rainfall\n\nThe tipping bucket raingauge (TBRG) has been in use at Environment Canada stations for nearly 100 years for measuring rates of rainfall. The rain is caught in a funnel-shaped collector (diameter 25.4 cm) and directed by means of a spout into one of two balanced buckets until an amount equal to 0.20 mm (before 1978, 0.01 in. or 0.25 mm) of rain causes the bucket to tip, electronically count, empty and then position the other bucket to fill with rain, continuing this process. The fact that it is already a semiautomatic gauge makes it a logical choice as an autostation raingauge. At manned AES stations the TBRG is only used during periods of the year when liquid precipitation is expected.\n\nSince the TBRG is a mechanical gauge, with inherent catch and measuring inconsistencies, all amounts are corrected on a daily basis. This is done by totaling the TBRG daily chart and comparing it to the collocated standard raingauge (MSC or Type-B) daily total. The standard gauge total is then divided by the TBRG total giving a ratio termed the correction factor (CF). The CF is then used to adjust hourly amounts and maximum rate of rainfall for durations of 5, 10, 15, and 30 min and 1, 2, 6, and 12 h. Routledge (1988), Marsalek (1981), Dyck and Gray (1973), and Sporns (1965) are in agreement that the TBRG under normal calibration will undermeasure. This is independent of the gauge location and intensity of the rain event and will vary with each TBRG.\n\nTable 3 shows mean CFs and standard deviations (SD) for TBRGs at 10 typical Canadian TBRG stations for events 0.1–100.0 mm and 10.0–50.0 mm during the period 1978–87. Victoria Marine, British Columbia, for example, indicates a 10-yr mean CF of 1.16 (i.e., 16% undermeasurement) with an annual SD of 0.33 (i.e., ±33%) for rain events 0.1 to 100.0 mm. Eliminating small rainfall events (i.e., <10.0 mm) will produce lower mean CFs and SDs, but these are still significantly large. The variability of the CFs for these selected stations clearly demonstrates the need for daily correction to the TBRG data. On a national basis, mean CFs for all rain events have deteriorated from 1.04 (Sporns 1965) to 1.17 (Routledge 1988). Presently, no CF can be calculated for TBRGs on Canadian autostations, therefore errors are no longer being corrected as before. This suggests serious problems in data from the autostation network while creating an inhomogeneous time series.\n\nHourly precipitation is also available from the supplementary precipitation gauge network primarily composed of Fischer and Porter weighing recording precipitation gauges (currently produced by the Belfort Instrument Company). This gauge has been in service with Environment Canada since the late 1960s and is predominately used at remote sites. The gauge collects all forms of precipitation and records the total weight to the nearest 2.54 mm (0.1 in.) on punched paper tape, usually at 15-min intervals. The new Belfort model 3000 gauge combines the older mechanical weighing gauge with electro-optical encoder technology for use on Environment Canada’s automatic weather observing system (i.e., AWOS). Alter and Nipher shields (Goodison et al. 1983) are used to help reduce the effect of wind on the gauge with varying effects. The gauge is installed at various orifice heights (2–6 m) depending on local snowpack accumulations that may compromise catch ability.\n\nUnlike TBRG data, no correction is applied to weighing recording gauge data since the gauges are generally located at unattended sites. During processing of the punch paper tape data, manual and automatic quality control routines are employed to minimize errors related to wind pumping of the weighing mechanism, evaporation of gauge contents, and, in particular, timing faults. This type of quality control is not yet available on real-time precipitation data from automatic recording systems. Proper gauge installation and maintenance are extremely important since these gauges may be left unattended for periods of 6 months or longer.\n\nCarr (1990) compared mean monthly ratios k′ of standard rain gauge measurements (i.e., Type-B) to weighing recording gauge measurements for seven sites across Canada that had collocated instruments during the period 1970–86. The sites represent a variety of climatic regions in Canada. For the rain season, April to October, the weighing gauge showed an average accumulated k′ of 1.14 when compared to the Type-B. For the seven stations, rain ratios ranged from 1.02 to 1.23. When only storm events exceeding 5.0 mm were compared, the average k′ decreased by 10.5% to 1.02 for the rain season. This difference in k′, depending on the storm size, demonstrates the problem the weighing recording gauge has with the resolution of rain events, particularly light rainfall and also with evaporation. The Belfort 3000 gauge on autostations will resolve precipitation amounts to 0.1 mm at time increments down to 1 min. This may resolve some errors, however, the inherent undercatch characteristics due to wind and evaporation still remain (Goodison 1978).\n\nTable 4 shows the percentage of gauge catch to pit gauge (i.e., “true” rainfall) for AES Type-B Rain Gauge (Type-B), Alter and Nipher shielded Belfort 3000 gauge (F&P), and Lambrecht TBRG at CARE for the month of September 1993. Rainfall events during the month varied in intensity and amount from trace to 19.8 mm. The Type-B gauge and the pit gauge totals for the month were 105.7 and 106.4 mm, respectively. The tipping bucket and large Nipher-shielded weighing recording gauge undermeasured the pit gauge by 6% and the Alter-shielded weighing recording gauge undermeasured by 11%.\n\na. Wetting loss adjustment\n\nInformation in the Environment Canada meteorological data archive is stored as separate elements. The quality-controlled elements for primary stations include: each 6-h precipitation measurement; 24-h rainfall (i.e., millimeters of rainfall from a raingauge measurement); 24-h snowfall (i.e., centimeters of fresh snowfall depth from a ruler measurement; and 24-h precipitation total (i.e., millimeters of water equivalent from either, or both raingauge and Nipher gauge measurement). Only the last three elements are available for climatological stations.\n\nSince the type of precipitation for each 6-h amount is not identified as rain or snow in this archive, it is impossible to determine accurately the gauge used to make measurements when mixed (i.e., rain and snow) precipitation occurs. This prevents assigning the exact wetting loss correction for gauge type during these events. If a conservative approach to adjustment is taken in mixed precipitation cases (i.e., daily values present for both 24-h rainfall and 24-h snowfall), then if more rain than snow is recorded on any day, corrections to each 6-h precipitation amount are applied assuming the total amount was rain. Similarly, if snowfall water equivalent exceeds rainfall, 6-h precipitation amounts are corrected as if they were all snow. Consequently, if the daily precipitation total is determined to be rainfall, then a wetting loss correction for each 6-h observation greater than trace, based on the type of raingauge in use during that period of time, is applied. Specifically this means that prior to 1965 (i.e., MSC gauge with copper insert) the wetting loss adjustment is 0.17 mm, and from 1965 to 1971 (i.e., MSC gauge with plastic insert) the wetting loss is 0.14 mm. From 1972 to present (i.e., Type-B gauge) no wetting loss is applied.\n\nd. Example of database adjustment\n\nTo demonstrate the significance of these adjustments, Toronto, Lester B. Pearson International Airport, a primary synoptic station located in southern Ontario, with a six hourly precipitation record extending back to 1947, was selected. A bar graph (Fig. 4) of annual rainfall totals from the six hourly archive shows an increasing linear trend in rainfall amount of 25 mm per decade over the period of record 1947–92. Figure 5 shows the impact of applying an adjustment factor based exclusively on undercatch due to gauge type based on the Goodison and Louie (1986) results. This method was also used by Groisman and Easterling (1994) to adjust Canadian raingauge data in their examination of precipitation variability and trends over North America (note they also corrected for snow measurement errors). After applying the adjustment procedure based on six hourly rainfall data outlined above (Fig. 6), the positive linear trend in rainfall demonstrated in Figs. 4 and 5 was reduced to 5 mm per decade. Also important from a climatological aspect is the fact that the year of maximum rainfall is altered from 1986 to 1954.\n\nThe results of linear trend analysis on archived and adjusted annual rainfall (i.e., six hourly data) for 10 selected HCCD stations are shown in Table 5. The impact of the adjustment was to consistently alter the linear trend by increasing the annual rainfall for the period 1947–64 for gauge undermeasurement and wetting loss errors by ≈15%. For these few, select stations representing a variety of Canadian climate regimes, the average percentage difference in the linear trend between archived and adjusted rainfall was reduced by 4% decade−1 as a result of these systematic bias adjustments.\n\nGroisman and Easterling (1994) showed an area-averaged linear trend of 13.7 ± 1.7% 100 yr−1 over southern Canada and 3.9 ± 2.7% 100 yr−1 over the contiguous United States for the century-long annual precipitation time series. However, the correction factor used by these researchers to homogenize Canadian rainfall data was only one-half of that required to reconcile the differences between the two gauges used in Canada since 1930. Also, for researchers using monthly data, the difficulty in adjusting for wetting loss errors on a monthly basis will result in an additional undermeasurement bias, particularly before 1965. Adjustment for “trace” measurements may or may not be important in trend analyses, depending on the consistency of these observations over time. In addition, since no reliable adjustment is available for raingauges used prior to 1930, it is inappropriate to draw conclusions from apparent trends during this period. As a consequence, it is reasonable to suggest that the amplitude of the trend in the rainfall component of precipitation over southern Canada for the past century has likely been overestimated in recent precipitation trend studies."
