        "text": "Food Strategy\n\nWhy does the City of Zurich have a Food Strategy? - Food accounts for one third of the environmental impact and 20 % of the greenhouse gas emissions of the goods we consume, and, it is important for health. With a self-sufficiency rate of 48 %, more than half of our food comes from abroad. It is therefore important to look at the entire production chain – including outside the city and national borders. The referendum of November 2017, adds the «promotion of environmentally friendly nutrition and information on the influence nutrition has on the global climate» to the municipal code. In addition, the «Milan Urban Food Policy Pact» is be implemented.\n\nFood Strategy\n\nAn Overview of the Environmental Quality in Zurich\n\nZurich has a good environmental quality. The air quality is very good by international standards, but the pollution levels on busy roads are clearly too high. One third of the city's inhabitants suffer health problems as a result of excessive noise pollution. 20 % of the urban settlement area is overheated in summer nights, so that some of the inhabitants are more frequently confronted with tropical nights than others. About 60 % of residents can easily reach open spaces with a high quality of life. The water quality in Lake Zurich and in the rivers is good, the drinking water quality excellent. However, the waters offer less good conditions for aquatic life. Ecologically valuable areas with high biodiversity are only gradually increasing, despite great efforts made by the city. In the case of light pollution in the urban area, the city advocates sensible measures so that people and animals are as undisturbed as possible when it is dark. The same applies to mobile phone antennas. In the case of transmitters on city territory, the city ensures compliance with the limit values.\n\nThe Earth's Boundaries\n\nThe Earth's boundaries in terms of pollution limits have been exceeded. Even if Switzerland's share of the total global impact is low – 0.2 % for greenhouse gases – the environmental impact per person is still many times over too high. Depending on the boundary considered, the main polluters are motorised private transport, heating requirements and food. This was shown in the first calculation on the City of Zurich's contributions. The results make clear that the average environmental impact is too high in five out of eight globally important areas, especially in greenhouse gas emissions and the impact on species extinction.\n\nTo reduce environmental pollution and relieve the planet, each and everyone needs to engage: administration, the population, the economy and research. The provision of energy, the production of goods and services must be as resource-efficient as possible, and the framework conditions must be designed in such a way that a sustainable lifestyle is taken for granted and, at the same time, there is room to accommodate different needs.\n\nThe Earth's Boundaries (in German)\n\nClimate Protection and Climate Adaptation\n\nClimate change has long arrived in Zurich. In the last 155 years, the average temperature has already risen by a good 2 °C. The city is committed to active climate protection and is implementing measures to reduce direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions in all climate-relevant areas – up until now, in accordance with the target of 1 ton of CO2 per person per year by 2050, as anchored in the municipal code. In view of the Paris Agreement, according to which man-made warming is to be limited to around 1.5 °C, the targets were adjusted. Should the people approve the new targets in the referendum mid-May 2022, direct emissions will be reduced to net zero by 2040 and indirect emissions will be reduced by 30% by 2040 compared to 1990.\n\nThe reduction of greenhouse gases is at the top of the political environmental agenda and is included in all strategies relating to the environment, energy and transport, as well as in public procurement. New municipal buildings meet the highest energy requirements, the buses of Zurich's public transport company will soon be powered solely by electricity, and the city is expanding its district heating network. For companies, private individuals and schools, the city offers various services for climate protection and resource conservation, for example environmental or mobility advice for companies or advice on heating system replacement.\n\nThe warming in the city is felt on hot days or tropical nights, which occur significantly more often than in the past. Around 20 % of the settlement area of the city of Zurich is already overheated at night. To react to this, aspects of urban climate are taken up by planning instruments, based on new principles laid out in the city's Heat Mitigation Plan (in German). Specifically, existing and new green and open spaces cool the surroundings and, thus, improve the local climate. In addition to heat mitigation, the challenges of climate adaptation due to increasing drought and extreme precipitation include water storage and flood protection, but also the increase of invasive plants and animals.\n\nClimate Change (in German)\n\nMobility\n\nPersonal mobility accounts for almost 30 % of the 13 tons of CO2 emissions produced annually by an average citizen of Zurich, with private motorised transport accounting for 17 % or almost two-thirds of this. The latter also emits pollutants into the air, causes noise and can lead to stress. Around 140,000 people in the city are burdened by excessive noise at their place of residence. Densification, new jobs and commuter traffic pose major challenges for urban transport policy. The focus is on climate protection, the reduction of noise emissions and the improvement of air quality.\n\nAn important goal of the Urban Transport 2025 programme is to make public transport as well as pedestrian and bicycle traffic more attractive and to, thus, further increase their share of the total traffic volume. Although the share of private motorised transport is decreasing and at 25 % is low compared to other large cities, reducing the share to 20 % by 2025 remains ambitious.\n\nToday, public transport handles 41 % of the total traffic volume, while cycling accounts for only 8 %. As far as air traffic is concerned, the kilometres flown per person in Switzerland increased by 78 % within 5 years (2010 to 2015) - and Zurich's population flies significantly more than the Swiss average. This places a considerable burden on the city's climate budget.\n\nThere is potential in the switch from fossil fuel drives to electromobility: with Zurich's electricity mix, 50 % of CO2 emissions can be saved if petrol and diesel vehicles are replaced. In addition, digitalisation should be increasingly employed as an opportunity for more sustainable mobility. The speed limit to 30 km/hour is an effective measure to make pedestrian and bicycle traffic safer and more attractive. In addition, a speed reduction reduces noise pollution and improves road safety, is effective, inexpensive and increases the quality of life.\n\nMobility (in German)\n\nFood\n\nOur diet is responsible for one third of environmental pollution and causes one tenth of greenhouse gas emissions. The reasons for this high share lie in the production of food, which pollutes the soil, water and air, reduces biodiversity and pollutes the climate. The most environmentally friendly products are those based on seasonal vegetable grown in the region. Greenhouse gases are produced in heated greenhouses, in the rearing of animals, but also in processing, storage, cooling and transport.\n\nThere is great potential for saving in avoiding food waste; the environmental impact of food could be reduced by 22 %. One third of all food in Switzerland goes to waste, two thirds of which would still be edible.\n\nWith its Food Strategy, the City of Zurich identifies challenges and opportunities, defines the direction for future measures and consistently implements them in the city's catering businesses. It advocates sustainable procurement criteria throughout the entire value chain, promotes sustainable production, the cooperation of regional actors and short-distance distribution. The City of Zurich has also launched a label of origin (Stadtpur) for local agricultural products and has already been able to reduce food waste in retirement centres by 18 % in 2021. Purchasing for municipal businesses is consistently carried out according to sustainable procurement guidelines.\n\nFood (in German)\n\nUrban Planning\n\nAccording to forecasts by the Federal Statistical Office, Switzerland's population will continue to grow in the coming years. The Federal Government and the Cantons want to concentrate the population increase in the cities to prevent further loss of green and open spaces outside the settlement area through building. For the City of Zurich, this means around a quarter more inhabitants by 2040. In addition, the number of jobs in the city will continue to rise.\n\nTo be able to preserve green and open spaces for nature, agriculture and recreation in the vicinity of the city, the only option is to develop settlements inwards. The City of Zurich understands the growth of the residential and working population as a framework condition and opportunity to convert the demands triggered into advantages in quality urban spaces planning. It wants to develop public transport further and bring together residents and commerce in buildings so that people have the shortest possible travel distances. The city also wants to preserve near-natural and interconnected habitats of wild native plants and animals while providing sufficient recreational space for the population.\n\nUrban Planning (in German)\n\nTen years ago, the vision of a «2000-Watt Society» was developed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. It is a model for energy policy which demonstrates how it is possible to consume only as much energy as worldwide energy reserves permit and which is justifiable in terms of the impact on the environment. It is possible when every person in every society limits their energy consumption to a maximum of 2000 watts.\n\nFurthermore, at least 75 % of energy needs need to be met using renewable energy sources, meaning that on an annual basis only one tonne of greenhouse gas is given off per person per year. The 2000-Watt Society is Zurich’s approach to tackling climate change and the future conflict of resources."
