Interlaken â Enjoy Hiking and Sightseeing in a Beautiful Swiss Valley\n\nInterlaken is a resort town that is a backpackers haven in the pricey Swiss Alps. There is a variety of accommodations from hostels to luxury hotels in the area. It is called the winter sports capital because it is at the base of the renowned Jungfrau ski resort region.\n\nIn May, the whole valley area is warm and a great place for hikes.

Its elevation is low, 568 meters (1,864 feet), and the daily highs average about 19Â°C (66Â°F).\n\nThere are about 13 days of low rainfall in May. An average of 6 hours of warm sunshine daily provides great weather for hikes and sightseeing in towns such as Gimmelwald that is perched on high cliffs in Lutschental Valley or MÃ¼rren that is on cliffs high above Lauterbrunnen Valley.\n\nVehicles: A ban on vehicles in several areas combined with excellent trams and trains makes it impractical to drive in the two valleys.

Bern â See the Swiss Capital and View Historic Places\n\nBern is called the capital of Switzerland, but it is not usually thought of as a major tourist attraction.

Others come to enjoy warm weather at the low elevations and tour the cities and towns.\n\nVisiting Switzerland in moderate tourism season has advantages. It is less expensive because deals can be found on flights and hotels. The heat and humidity is less intense than in high summer. You could enjoy the blossoming trees, mountain hiking on freshly opened trails, and the start of the swimming season.\n\nPeople begin taking train tours, and you can enjoy more solitude and low crowding.

They commemorate Jesus Christ's ascension into heaven. It may be a day off for many.\n\nPentecost: The date of Pentecost varies from year to year.
