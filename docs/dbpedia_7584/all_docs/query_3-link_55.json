        "text": "Weather\n\nNovember is fall in Switzerland, but the weather gets more wintery as the month progresses. Snow will fall higher up in the mountains, and temperatures will plummet, but you may still experience fine days at lower altitudes. Temperatures vary a lot by altitude, but the average November temperature in the cities of Geneva, Lugano, and Zürich is around 46°F (7.5°C), while in high-altitude Zermatt, it's just 28°F (-2°C), which is almost as cold as it gets in midwinter.\n\nCrowds & Costs\n\nNovember is in the low season for tourism in Switzerland, and before visitor numbers increase in the lead up to Christmas and the winter ski season. Generally, the ski season doesn't begin until December. Still, there's a chance that early snowfall will lead to earlier openings, especially in higher-altitude resorts like Zermatt, Saas-Fee, and Verbier. If the season starts early, expect resort towns to get busy, fast.\n\nConditions in November make this month a great time to visit the cities, particularly if you're less concerned about the weather and more interested in cultural attractions like museums, galleries, and beautiful architecture. You may find discounted accommodation, flights, and activities, although be aware that many tourist facilities beyond the big cities take a maintenance break in the fall.\n\nWhere to Go\n\nA good approach to visiting Switzerland in November is to base yourself in one or more of its attractive cities. Many Swiss cities are close to the mountains, so you can enjoy city attractions like museums and galleries when the weather isn't so great, but when it's fine out, you can venture into the mountains on day trips or enjoy great views from around the city. Bern, Lucerne, Lausanne, and Geneva are perfect city break destinations, as are the lakeside towns in the Italian-speaking Ticino region, Lugano and Locarno.\n\nGeneva is an especially great destination in November. Over nine days early in the month, the Geneva International Film Festival showcases a range of Swiss and international films. Additionally, visitors to the lakeside city can check out cultural attractions including the Museum of Art and History, the 16th-century St. Peter's Cathedral of Geneva, the Palace of Nations (the United Nations headquarters), and the quirky Broken Chair sculpture beside the UN headquarters.\n\nWhat to Do\n\nTake a ride along the Glacier Express route to experience the Swiss Alps in November—a month when neither hiking nor skiing in the mountains is possible. This 181-mile (291-km), eight-hour rail journey connects the resort towns of Zermatt and St. Moritz. Passengers are treated to views of a series of peaks (starting with Matterhorn), glaciers, mountain passes, and gorges as the train runs almost the entire length of southern Switzerland's Alps. It also crosses the Oberalp Pass and Landwasser Viaduct.\n\nThe tourist scenic train—complete with panoramic windows that run the whole route without your having to change trains—doesn't operate in November. However, the regular train does serve this month, and on the plus side, it's cheaper than the tourist train.\n\nEvents in November\n\nGeneva International Film Festival, Geneva. This festival shows films from around the world in various languages over nine days in early-mid November.\n\nMore Helpful Information"
