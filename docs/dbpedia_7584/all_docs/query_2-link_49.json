        "text": "Climate Types\n\nThe climate for Switzerland pretty typical, cold and snowy in the winter, rainy in the spring, and warm, but not hot in the summer. The weather is not uniform across the country, obviously the higher you go in elevation, the cooler the average temperature gets making the mountains cooler than the low lands.\n\nhttp://www.bing.com/images/search?q=climate+map+for+switzerland&FORM=HDRSC2#view=detail&id=1D11D12AD2AD43512931622056B20610F0683D8D&selectedIndex=13\n\nSeasonality\n\nSwitzerland has clearly defined seasons, for example, the winter months the average temp. is 28- 45 degrees, the summer months the average temp. is 65- 82 degrees, and in the spring and autumn months the average temp is 46- 59 degrees (My Switzerland). Depending on the elevation, the temperature change may vary.\n\nZurich, Switzerland, the photo above.\n\nhttp://www.bing.com/images/search?q=zurich+switzerland&FORM=HDRSC2#view=detail&id=93E5C85E557CEAD17387E48F99A8267542CE144A&selectedIndex=10\n\nThe average temperature for Zurich, the most populated city in Switzerland, is 8.3 degrees C, that is approximately 46 degrees F (Temperature Conversion). The average temperature for Geneva is 8.9 degrees C, that is approximately 48 degrees F (Temperature Conversion). The average temperature for Denver, CO 11 degrees C, approximately 52 degrees F (Temperature Conversion). Denver, on average, is warmer than both Zurich and Geneva. Which I think was to be expected, since Denver is on a lower latitude.\n\nGeneva, Switzerland the photo below.\n\nhttp://www.bing.com/images/search?q=geneva%2c+switzerland&FORM=HDRSC2#view=detail&id=AC321B2643E85E88CE7293189E23DF8FD233A30C&selectedIndex=110\n\nThe average precipitation for Zurich is 1079 mm per year. The average precipitation for Geneva is 878.1 mm per year. The average precipitation for Denver, CO is 397 mm per year. On average Zurich gets 682mm more precipitation a year than Denver! And on average Geneva gets 481.1mm more precipitation than Denver. I knew Switzerland was famous for their skiing, but I had no idea how much precipitation they actually got."
