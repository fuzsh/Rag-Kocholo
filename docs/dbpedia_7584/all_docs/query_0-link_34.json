        "text": "The final figures\n\nBelow are the final figures for the weather last January (see Figs. 1 to 3).\n\nAlmost 1.5 degrees too mild\n\nThe temperature surplus has increased from 0.5 degrees to 1.4 degrees across Switzerland since the provisional balance of January 26 as a result of the above-average temperatures in recent days, especially in the mountains (see Fig. 1), making the map significantly redder.\n\nFig. 1: Temperature deviation in January compared to the long-term average 1991-2020; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nThe smallest deviation was just under 1 degree on the northern edge of Switzerland, while the largest deviation was in Valais, where temperatures were well over 2 degrees in some places. Overall, the temperature surplus in the west and south is significantly greater than in the east and far north. Although last January was clearly too mild, it does not appear in the top 10 warmest Januarys for Switzerland as a whole. However, if you look at the individual stations, there are places where last January appears far ahead. In Sion, for example, it was the second warmest January and in Bern and Lugano the fifth warmest since records began.\n\nToo wet in the north\n\nIn the Jura, the Central Plateau and the Pre-Alps, last January was too wet across the board; in north-eastern Switzerland, more than twice the usual amount of precipitation fell in some places (in Salen-Reutenen in the canton of Thurgau even 171% more than normal). The amounts remained below average, particularly in southern Valais, Ticino and partly in Graubünden; in northern Ticino, there was less than half the normal January precipitation in some places. Across Switzerland, the precipitation sur plus amounted to around 17% (see Fig. 2). This means that the surplus has decreased slightly from 36.5% at that time due to the mostly dry days since January 26.\n\nFig. 2: Precipitation deviation in January compared to the long-term average 1991-2020; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nAbout normal sunshine\n\nIn terms of sunshine duration, last January was fairly normal for the whole of Switzerland (deficit of only 3.5%). Thanks to the last few days, which were often quite sunny, especially in the mountains, the deficit has decreased significantly since January 26 (then still just under 20%). In German-speaking Switzerland and the south, it was slightly too sunny in many places, while in the west it was a little too cloudy.\n\nFig. 3: Deviation in sunshine duration in January compared to the long-term average 1991-2020; Source: MeteoNews, UBIMET\n\nFinally, an overview of the deviations in temperature, precipitation and sunshine duration for some stations last January compared to the long-term average from 1991 to 2020.\n\nThe weather in January 2024\n\nplace Temperaturabweichung Niederschlagsabweichung Abweichung der Sonnenscheindauer °C % % Buchs-Aarau 1.3 59.0 28.0 Bern 1.9 32.0 -7.0 Basel-Binningen 0.9 60.0 -3.0 Chur 1.9 -10.0 -4.0 Geneva 1.6 42.0 -5.0 La Chaux-de-Fonds 1.7 16.0 -5.0 Lugano 1.4 -28.0 12.0 Lucerne 1.4 61.0 9.0 Säntis 1.4 27.0 -9.0 Sion 2.2 1.0 -27.0 Sankt Gallen 1.5 124.0 23.0 Samedan 2.1 -21.0 1.0 Vaduz 2.0 77.0 -1.0 Zurich Airport 1.3 61.0 6.0\n\nClimatic mean from 1991 to 2020, source: MeteoSwiss Temperature precipitation sunshine duration January 2024 Mittel Abweichung January 2024 Mittel Abweichung January 2024 Mittel Abweichung [°C] [°C] [°C] [mm] [mm] [%] [h] [h] [%] Buchs-Aarau 2.5 1.2 1.3 100.5 63.1 59.0 52.7 41.2 28.0 Bern 2.1 0.2 1.9 79.6 60.3 32.0 61.2 66.1 -7.0 Basel-Binningen 3.1 2.2 0.9 76.4 47.8 60.0 62.7 64.5 -3.0 Chur 2.9 1.0 1.9 49.1 54.3 -10.0 93.4 97.0 -4.0 Geneva 3.7 2.1 1.6 103.3 72.8 42.0 57.8 60.9 -5.0 La Chaux-de-Fonds 0.7 -1.0 1.7 124.1 106.6 16.0 90.9 95.2 -5.0 Lugano 5.2 3.8 1.4 47.2 65.5 -28.0 138.1 123.8 12.0 Lucerne 2.5 1.1 1.4 89.8 55.8 61.0 55.4 50.8 9.0 Säntis -5.4 -6.8 1.4 341.9 269.5 27.0 116.8 127.8 -9.0 Sion 2.7 0.5 2.2 52.4 51.8 1.0 68.0 93.4 -27.0 Sankt Gallen 1.7 0.2 1.5 149.4 66.8 124.0 69.7 56.7 23.0 Samedan -6.3 -8.4 2.1 23.3 29.4 -21.0 121.7 120.0 1.0 Vaduz 3.4 1.4 2.0 72.9 41.1 77.0 71.0 71.9 -1.0 Zurich Airport 2.2 0.9 1.3 105.1 65.3 61.0 53.0 50.1 6.0\n\nToo mild in the end\n\nAfter a slight temperature deficit in the middle of the month, the picture quickly changed after the more dynamic and exceptionally mild weather of the last few days.\n\nFig. 1: Previous number of ice days (permafrost) in January 2024; Source: MeteoNews, Ubimet\n\nDespite a series of icy days and very cold nights at the end of last week (-28 degrees on the Ofen Pass on the morning of January 20, the lowest temperature in Switzerland so far this winter), there is now a temperature surplus. Including yesterday, it is now 0.5 degrees milder than usual across the country. This is not surprising, as Wednesday and Thursday set new monthly records at a number of stations (Piotta, Disentis, San Bernardino, Zermatt, Santa Maria, Grächen, Scuol, Samedan, Neuchâtel and Wynau) and yesterday in Biasca the 20 degree mark was broken for the first time this year in Switzerland. This surplus will continue to increase in the coming days, although the middle altitudes and the mountains will then increasingly play a decisive role. After the passage of a cold front, it will become significantly milder at higher altitudes over the course of the weekend. On Sunday, the zero degree limit will rise to 3000 meters, on Monday even to 3200 to 3400 meters. By the turn of the month, the mountain temperatures will fall again slightly, but will remain well above average for the time of year. On the Swiss Plateau, fog or deep high fog will play a role, dampening the daytime warming. In the end, the question is not whether January 2024 will be too mild, but by how much.\n\nFig. 2: Previous temperature deviation in January 2024 compared to the long-term average; Source: MeteoNews, Ubimet\n\nToo wet\n\nIn terms of precipitation, the picture is clear: January 2024 will be too wet. In the middle of the month, the distribution of precipitation was still quite inhomogeneous, but now there is a surplus across the entire northern side of the Alps. It was particularly wet in the northeast. It was only too dry in southern Valais, parts of Ticino, the Gotthard region and locally in Graubünden. This afternoon and in the first half of next night, a cold front in the north will bring a few more liters of rain and a few centimetres of fresh snow on the mountains. After that, it will probably stay dry until the end of the month. Where there is no snow tomorrow, there will be none in January anymore.\n\nFig. 3: Previous deviation of precipitation amounts in January 2024 compared to the long-term average; Source: MeteoNews, Ubimet\n\nCatching up on the sunshine\n\nIn many regions of Switzerland, the amount of sunshine has been below average so far this January – the biggest deficit is in the west. From tomorrow, however, a strong high pressure system will dry out the air in the Alpine region, and apart from fog or occasional high cloud fields moving through, the sun will be in charge. The current nationwide deficit of just under 20% will now gradually decrease. In the south and in Graubünden, we are heading for a clear plus.\n\nFig. 4: Previous deviation of sunshine duration in January 2024 compared to the long-term average; Source: MeteoNews, Ubimet\n\nSlight temperature deficit\n\nTemperatures were clearly above average in the first few days of the year, with a nationwide temperature surplus of 2.5 degrees after the first week. In the second week, the weather situation changed and a wave of much colder air reached the northern side of the Alps from the north-east. The Swiss Plateau remained cold with northeasterly winds, fog and high fog, and there were a number of icy days with light permafrost. There were 6 of these in Lucerne, the last time this was the case here was between the end of February and the beginning of March 2018. On the mountains, on the other hand, it was only really cold at the beginning of this phase, after which the values rose again significantly. A typical inversion weather situation with lots of sunshine at altitude, with temperatures between –2 and 0 degrees at 2000 meters.\n\nFig. 1: Temperature trend (maximum values) in the first half of the month at the Zurich Airport and Pilatus stations; Source: MeteoNews\n\nDuring this phase, the excess temperature was quickly reduced and the national average is currently 0.5 degrees below the long-term average. Temperatures are rising today and will remain mild for some time tomorrow before cooling down again. From Friday to Sunday it will remain wintry with cold nights, but next week it will be significantly milder – and this will probably be sustainable.\n\nFig. 2: Previous temperature deviation in January 2024 compared to the long-term average; Source: MeteoNews, Ubimet\n\nPartly too wet, partly too dry\n\nThe precipitation picture is mixed and the distribution is very inhomogeneous. Regionally, it has been too wet so far, for example in the north-east or along the central and western foothills of the Alps, but also in central and southern Ticino and in southern Grisons. In between are areas with below-average precipitation. It was too dry, for example, from Valais to the Gotthard region to northern Grisons. However, today's Wednesday and tomorrow's Thursday will leave their mark on this balance and change the picture.\n\nFig. 3: Previous deviation of precipitation amounts in January 2024 compared to the long-term average; Source: MeteoNews, Ubimet\n\nToo little sun\n\nIn the first half of January, there was often too little sunshine, especially in the Swiss Plateau, and the deficit is particularly pronounced in the west. Clouds slowed things down at first, followed by high fog and mist. On the mountains, however, the sun was able to make its presence felt in the course of the second week. Across the whole country, up to and including yesterday, we are at –21% in terms of sunshine duration.\n\nFig. 4: Previous number of hours of sunshine in January 2024; Source: MeteoNews, Ubimet"
