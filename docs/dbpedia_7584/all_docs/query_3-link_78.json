        "text": "Snowstorms and heavy winds have caused chaos across parts of Europe and the US, grounding flights at Munich's airport and knocking out power across the US's Pacific Northwest.\n\nHere's a look at how cities and nations have been affected so far.\n\nGermany\n\nMunich's airport cancelled all flights until 6am Sunday local time.\n\nTrains to and from Munich's central station were halted, Germany's national railway said, advising passengers to delay or reroute their journeys.\n\nThe news agency DPA reported some passengers in Munich and the nearby city of Ulm spent Friday night on trains due to the halt.\n\nIn the Bavarian capital, no buses or trams were operating as of Saturday afternoon, the local transit authority said.\n\nDowned trees also left \"many thousands\" of people without power across the state of Bavaria, the utility company Bayernwerk told DPA.\n\nOfficials for Germany's Bundesliga also announced a soccer match between Bayern Munich and Union Berlin, originally scheduled for Saturday afternoon in Munich, was cancelled.\n\nUS\n\nThousands of households were without power on Saturday morning in the greater Seattle area after a night of rain and wind, the Seattle Times reported.\n\nSeattle City Light reported 17 outages affecting more than 1,700 customers, roughly two-thirds of them in South Seattle, according to the utility's outage map.\n\nIn Oregon, more than 2,000 customers in the Portland area also lost power, outage maps from Portland General Electric and Pacific Power showed.\n\nThe power cuts came as high winds swept across the region, reaching 84 kilometres per hour at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, according to the National Weather Service's Seattle office.\n\nThe storms also brought snow to the Cascades.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, Paradise in Mount Rainier National Park had received 14 inches (35.5 centimetres) of snow over 24 hours, according to preliminary reports from the National Weather Service.\n\nSnowfall and heavy wind too caused the cancellation of a men's World Cup downhill skiing race on Saturday in Colorado.\n\nThe cancellation made it the fourth downhill that has been scrapped because of the weather early in the World Cup season, following two in Switzerland in early November and one early in Colorado.\n\nSwitzerland and Austria\n\nThe Zurich airport reported weather-related delays, as new snowfall led officials to raise the alarm about the danger of avalanches.\n\nThe provinces of Tyrol and Vorarlberg in western Austria raised their avalanche warnings to the second-highest level after the region received up to 50 centimetres of snow on Saturday night.\n\nThe Austrian railway company OeBB said Saturday afternoon various stretches of its routes across the country were closed due to the storm.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nIn the Czech Republic, the major highway and some other roads were blocked for hours and more than 15,000 households were without power.\n\nThe key D1 highway that links the capital Prague with the second largest city of Brno was in a standstill for hours after an accident that caused a 20-kilometre long line of trucks.\n\nA number of high-speed and regional trains had to stop in the southern part of the country as cross-border trains from neighbouring Austria and Germany did not operate."
