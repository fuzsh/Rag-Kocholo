        "text": "Swiss temperature records\n\n*The measurement series from La Brévine (minimum and maximum temperatures) was homogenised in 2011. In the process of doing so, it was found that the minimum temperature of -41.8 °C measured on 12 January 1987 would have been equivalent to -42.5 °C under today's measurement conditions. The difference is due to the transition, in October 1997, from the former manual system of measurements (in a measuring hut) to an automatic measuring system.\n\nThe weather station in Grono has been moved since the measurement was taken. Under today’s measurement conditions on the valley floor, the hottest temperature of the day would have registered as 40.5 C on 11 August 2003.\n\nGlobal data series\n\nThere are various data series that record the global temperatures dating back to the 19th century. The record-breaking data vary across the different data series, but the differences are small.\n\nAccording to the University of East Anglia HADCRUT5 data series, 2016 was the warmest year on record globally since measurements began in 1850. The information on the coldest year globally (1904) also comes from this data series."
