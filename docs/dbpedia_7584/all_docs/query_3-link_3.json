Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in ZÃ¼rich is essentially constant during the winter, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on August 7, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 2% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Winter in ZÃ¼rich\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Winter in ZÃ¼richDecJanFeb0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%FallSpringDec 10%Dec 10%Feb 280%Feb 280%Jan 10%Jan 10%Feb 10%Feb 10%drydry\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in ZÃ¼rich is gradually increasing during the winter, increasing from 6.1 miles per hour to 6.6 miles per hour over the course of the season.\n\nFor reference, on February 6, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 6.9 miles per hour, while on August 9, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 5.0 miles per hour.\n\nThe highest daily average wind speed during the winter is 6.9 miles per hour on February 6.\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Winter in ZÃ¼rich\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Winter in ZÃ¼richDecJanFeb0 mph0 mph2 mph2 mph4 mph4 mph6 mph6 mph8 mph8 mph10 mph10 mph12 mph12 mphFallSpringFeb 66.9 mphFeb 66.9 mphDec 16.1 mphDec 16.1 mphFeb 286.6 mphFeb 286.6 mphJan 16.6 mphJan 16.6 mph\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in ZÃ¼rich throughout the winter is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 42% on December 30.\n\nWind Direction in the Winter in ZÃ¼rich\n\nWind Direction in the Winter in ZÃ¼richDecJanFeb0%100%20%80%40%60%60%40%80%20%100%0%FallSpringwestsoutheastnorth\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in ZÃ¼rich typically lasts for 6.5 months (199 days), from around April 15 to around October 31, rarely starting before March 26 or after May 4, and rarely ending before October 12 or after November 23.\n\nThe winter in ZÃ¼rich is very likely fully outside of the growing season, with the chance that a given day is in the growing season reaching a low of -0% on December 27.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Winter in ZÃ¼rich\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Winter in ZÃ¼richDecJanFeb0%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%FallSpringDec 14%Dec 14%Feb 280%Feb 280%Jan 10%Jan 10%Feb 10%Feb 10%freezingvery coldcoldcoolfrigid\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in ZÃ¼rich are very rapidly decreasing during the winter, decreasing by 2,096Â°F, from 2,102Â°F to 6Â°F, over the course of the season.\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Winter in ZÃ¼rich\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Winter in ZÃ¼richDecJanFeb0Â°F0Â°F500Â°F500Â°F1,000Â°F1,000Â°F1,500Â°F1,500Â°F2,000Â°F2,000Â°FFallSpringDec 12,102Â°FDec 12,102Â°FFeb 286Â°FFeb 286Â°F\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in ZÃ¼rich is rapidly increasing during the winter, rising by 1.6 kWh, from 1.3 kWh to 2.9 kWh, over the course of the season.\n\nThe lowest average daily incident shortwave solar energy during the winter is 1.1 kWh on December 23.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Winter in ZÃ¼rich\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Winter in ZÃ¼richDecJanFeb0.0 kWh0.0 kWh0.5 kWh0.5 kWh1.0 kWh1.0 kWh1.5 kWh1.5 kWh2.0 kWh2.0 kWh2.5 kWh2.5 kWh3.0 kWh3.0 kWh3.5 kWh3.5 kWh4.0 kWh4.0 kWh4.5 kWh4.5 kWh5.0 kWh5.0 kWh5.5 kWh5.5 kWh6.0 kWh6.0 kWhFallSpringDec 231.1 kWhDec 231.1 kWhDec 11.3 kWhDec 11.3 kWhFeb 282.9 kWhFeb 282.9 kWhFeb 11.8 kWhFeb 11.8 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of ZÃ¼rich are 47.367 deg latitude, 8.550 deg longitude, and 1,407 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of ZÃ¼rich contains very significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 1,010 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 1,552 feet. Within 10 miles also contains very significant variations in elevation (1,781 feet). Within 50 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (11,056 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of ZÃ¼rich is covered by artificial surfaces (68%), water (15%), and trees (15%), within 10 miles by cropland (38%) and artificial surfaces (31%), and within 50 miles by trees (35%) and cropland (27%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in ZÃ¼rich, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in ZÃ¼rich.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and ZÃ¼rich according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at ZÃ¼rich is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between ZÃ¼rich and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nDÃ¼bendorf Air Base (LSMD, 56%, 5 mi, northeast, 62 ft elevation change)\n\nZurich Airport (LSZH, 38%, 7 mi, north, 7 ft elevation change)\n\nEmmen Air Base (LSME, 6%, 22 mi, southwest, -10 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of ZÃ¼rich and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
