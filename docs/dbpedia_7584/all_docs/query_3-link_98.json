        "text": "Snow in Europe: it’s not always a certainty, but if you’re travelling around the continent in the winter, you can usually expect some of the white stuff!\n\nThis section of the blog focuses on just that: snow.\n\nI’ve spent many a winter travelling around Europe, trying to find the best places to see decent snowfall – from the Spanish Pyrenees to the Norwegian Arctic to the Anatolian Plateau! – so I know exactly where to go if you want a decent chance of seeing it.\n\nThis guide will detail exactly where, when and why you can expect snow in Europe – and you can click through to any of my detailed guides on individual countries/ destinations.\n\nThis page may contain affiliate links.\n\nWhen does it snow in Europe?\n\nIf you’re really keen to experience some European snow, book your trip for the winter! In particular, the month of January is most snowy.\n\nHere’s a breakdown:\n\nHigh season: December to February\n\nThese are the prime months for snowfall in most European destinations.\n\nDuring this time, popular ski resorts in Switzerland, Bulgaria and Poland are busy and the slopes look their best!\n\nAvailability of accommodations can be scarce, and prices soar, so booking in advance is advisable.\n\nLow-lying places in Europe may also have snow during these months – typically the further north and further inland you are, the higher your chance of seeing some snow.\n\nIf you find yourself in Lapland or Iceland during these months, the chances of witnessing the Northern Lights increase dramatically due to the decreased darkness!\n\nLate winter season: March and April\n\nThe ski season doesn’t necessarily end as winter transitions to spring.\n\nMany resorts, especially those at higher altitudes, continue through April!\n\nWhile snowfall can be a bit more unreliable, slopes often use the accumulation of snow throughout the cooler period. Plus there are fewer crowds, and it can be a lot cheaper!\n\nThe weather is milder but still cold enough to keep the slopes in good condition.\n\nSnow can still happen in continental locations in Europe, such as Berlin or Warsaw, but it’s rare in more coastal locations, including England.\n\nBut venture to the far north of Europe – the Arctic – and you’ll still find plenty of snow!\n\nSnow-free period: May to September\n\nFor the most part, these are the months where snow is the least likely to be found across most of Europe.\n\nGlaciers at high elevations might still be snowy, but generally, snowfall is rare.\n\nThe beginning of winter: October and November\n\nIn places like Arctic Norway, snowfall begins in October, but most places in Europe don’t see it until November. There’s usually not enough snowfall to open ski resorts until the start of December, but some open for early-season skiing.\n\nWhy does it snow in Europe?\n\nSo, why does it snow in Europe?\n\nSituated in the Northern Hemisphere, Europe experiences a variety of climates, ranging from Arctic in the far north to the Mediterranean in the south.\n\nThese differing climates contribute to the patterns of snowfall across the continent.\n\nInfluence of the Arctic\n\nNorthern countries like Norway, Sweden, and Finland are influenced by the Arctic climate, which means long, cold winters with ample snowfall are the norm.\n\nThe proximity to the Arctic Circle plays a significant role in the persistent snow conditions in these areas.\n\nMountain ranges\n\nThe presence of major mountain ranges, such as the Alps, Pyrenees, and Carpathians, greatly impacts snowfall in Central and Southern Europe.\n\nThese mountains not only create a barrier for weather systems but also provide the high altitudes necessary for snow to form and persist.\n\nAs moist air ascends these slopes, it cools and condenses, leading to snowfall.\n\nOcean currents\n\nEurope’s weather is also influenced by ocean currents like the North Atlantic Drift, a warm current that moderates temperatures in Western Europe.\n\nWhile it may lessen the severity of winters and is a reason why many coastal locations in Western Europe don’t become cold enough for snow, it also introduces moisture into the atmosphere, creating conditions favourable for snow when a cold front is present.\n\nLatitude and interior geography\n\nCountries that are further east, like Poland, Ukraine, and Romania, experience snow partially due the influence of continental climate systems.\n\nWinters here are generally colder than in Western Europe due to the lack of oceanic influence – colder temperatures are more likely to settle in here – this makes it it conducive for snow to form.\n\nShort-lived snow in the south\n\nWhile it’s rare, Southern Europe does see some snowfall, particularly in mountainous regions like the Sierra Nevada in Spain or high-altitude areas in Greece.\n\nBut generally, the Mediterranean climate and lower altitudes make snow less common.\n\nWhere does it snow in Europe?\n\nSo, where can you expect snowfall in Europe? Let’s break it down region by region.\n\nDon’t forget to click through to individual blog posts to find out more information about each country, region or city!\n\nNorthern Europe\n\nNorthern Europe is one of the most reliable places to go on the continent for consistent snowfall in the winter season.\n\nThanks to its proximity to the Arctic, you can expect freezing conditions and plenty of snow and ice throughout the winter period!\n\nBut you might not necessarily get it everywhere – the south coast of Norway, for example, doesn’t always see snow.\n\nIceland\n\nParts of Iceland have fairly reliable snowfall in the winter, although thanks to the jet stream, winters in places like Reykjavik are sometimes warmer than you’d imagine.\n\nYou’ll still find snow in Reykjavik most of the winter through, and as soon as you venture out of the capital you’ll see snow all over Iceland!\n\nIt can snow anytime from October to April in Iceland, but it’s most common in the winter months.\n\nNorway\n\nNorway’s a fairly snowy country in the winter months, with some snowfall starting as early as October and lasting until April, but some cities on the west and south coast such as Bergen and Stavenger have less reliable winter weather.\n\nOslo, Norway’s capital, typically has lots of snow throughout the season, and you can even go skiing just a metro ride from the centre!\n\nTromsø is Norway’s winter hub, and snowfall is frequent here throughout the seasons – although you can quite easily see the impacts of climate change here.\n\nSweden\n\nSnowfall in Sweden varies by region but is generally consistent from November to March.\n\nIn Stockholm, winters can be milder than you might expect, though the city still experiences several weeks of snow cover.\n\nThe northern parts like Lapland are another story altogether; expect snow-covered landscapes that seem to stretch endlessly.\n\nKiruna, in particular, is well known for its dog sledging and snowmobiling!\n\nSkiing and snowboarding are popular activities, with resorts like Åre attracting winter sports enthusiasts from around the world.\n\nFinland\n\nIn Finland, winter and snow go hand in hand.\n\nThe southern regions, including the capital Helsinki, usually see snow from December to March.\n\nHowever, don’t be surprised to encounter snowfall as late as April.\n\nThen, venture north to Lapland.\n\nThe winter months offer a variety of activities, from reindeer safaris to catching a glimpse of the Northern Lights!\n\nSki resorts like Levi and Ruka are popular, with a range of slopes that cater to different skill levels.\n\nDenmark\n\nDenmark’s winters are more moderate compared to its Scandinavian neighbours, with snowfall less predictable.\n\nCopenhagen may see a dusting of snow during the winter months, but it often melts quickly.\n\nThat said, if you head to areas like Jutland or Funen, you’ll find more consistent snow cover.\n\nWhile Denmark isn’t a ski destination, it does offer charming winter landscapes ideal for cosy hygge and winter walks!\n\nWestern Europe\n\nWestern Europe has a more nuanced winter landscape when it comes to snowfall.\n\nWhile you’ll find several regions boasting substantial and dependable snow, it’s not a guarantee across the board!\n\nThanks to notable mountain ranges like the Alps and the Pyrenees, certain areas are winter sports paradises, offering both quality and quantity in terms of snow.\n\nYet, venture away from these snowy epicentres, and the likelihood of encountering a winter wonderland decreases.\n\nSome lowland and coastal areas may go an entire winter with only a dusting – if any snow at all.\n\nFrance\n\nSnow in France really varies depending on where you set your sights!\n\nIn Paris, snowfall is rare but magical, transforming the city into a scene straight out of a painting!\n\nMove eastward to the Alsace region, and you’ll find slightly more reliable snowfall, turning the area into a winter postcard with its charming villages and wine routes. This region is famous for its Christmas markets, and they’re particularly scenic after slightly snowfall!\n\nSouthern France generally sees less snow, but that doesn’t mean it’s entirely absent. But the closer to the Mediterranean coast you are, the less likely you are to see snow.\n\nAnd on the West Coast, cities like Bordeaux and Nantes are more likely to see rain than snowflakes!\n\nOf course, if it’s a snow surety you’re after, the French Alps and Pyrenees are your go-to spots.\n\nThese mountain ranges are the epitome of winter sports in France, with destinations like Chamonix and Val Thorens providing snow-covered slopes nearly guaranteed throughout the winter season.\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nThe Netherlands rarely experiences heavy snowfall, largely due to how flat it is.\n\nAlso, most of the country is very close to the coast!\n\nHowever, it can happen every so often, thanks to its relatively northern latitude.\n\nInland areas like Utrecht and Arnhem are generally the most likely places to witness snowfall. Snowy Amsterdam is quite unusual!\n\nBelgium\n\nBelgium’s winter climate is similar to that of the Netherlands; snow’s occasional, not expected.\n\nCities like Brussels and Antwerp might see a dusting that lasts a few days, but it’s rarely disruptive.\n\nFor more consistent snow, head to the Ardennes region, particularly if you enjoy winter hikes or cross-country skiing.\n\nWhile not a ski destination per se, the Ardennes offers a more rustic and natural winter experience.\n\nGermany\n\nIt snows in Germany, but not everywhere!\n\nBerlin has occasional snow, but cities like Hamburg don’t often see it, thanks to their proximity to the ocean.\n\nHead to the Bavarian Alps, however, and it’s a different story.\n\nMunich often serves as the gateway to Germany’s mountains, being close to renowned ski resorts like Garmisch-Partenkirchen.\n\nThe Black Forest region also sees frequent snow.\n\nSnow’s not guaranteed in any cities in Germany in December, but if you want the highest chance of seeing the white stuff at Germany’s fabled Christmas markets, head to Nuremberg or Dresden.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nSwitzerland is synonymous with winter sports, thanks to the iconic Alps that sprawl through most of the country.\n\nIt can snow anywhere in Switzerland in winter: cities like Zurich and Geneva may receive moderate snowfall, but it’s the mountain regions where winter truly comes to life.\n\nZermatt, St. Moritz, and Verbier are just a few of the renowned ski destinations that offer dependable snow conditions.\n\nBut it’s not all about skiing and snowboarding; you can enjoy winter hikes, snowshoeing, and even tobogganing in these regions.\n\nFor those who prefer their snow with a side of luxury, Switzerland’s alpine resorts offer top-notch amenities and breathtaking mountain views, making the country a top choice for those who want their winter activities paired with unparalleled comfort!\n\nAustria\n\nAustria is also very snowy in winter.\n\nThe Austrian Alps are a winter sports enthusiast’s dream, with famous ski resorts like Kitzbühel and Ischgl providing a range of slopes for all skill levels.\n\nBeyond skiing, Austria offers winter activities like ice climbing, snowshoeing, and sledding, which are especially popular in areas like the Hohe Tauern National Park.\n\nCities like Vienna and Salzburg experience periodic snowfall, adding a seasonal charm to their historic streets and architecture when it happens!\n\nThe British Isles\n\nThe British Isles in winter is… mixed.\n\nSnowfall is far from a guarantee across the region – in England, it usually only happens once or twice a year.\n\nHowever, the likelihood of snow increases ever so slightly as you venture northward or to higher elevations.\n\nWhen snow does make an appearance, it often lends a poetic charm to the countryside!\n\nEngland\n\nEngland and snow vary widely, both regionally and year-to-year.\n\nBut generally, it only snows 1-2 times per year, although it’s a bit more common in higher elevation areas.\n\nLondon does see snowfall but it’s often short-lived. When it does happen, however, it can really disrupt daily life for a day or two!\n\nNorthern cities such as Manchester and Leeds see snowfall a bit more regularly, but even there, it’s usually not abundant.\n\nWhen snow does fall, it lends an extra layer of charm to England’s already picturesque countryside!\n\nSpots like the Lake District are popular for winter hiking and maybe even sledging.\n\nScotland\n\nScotland is more likely to have regular snowfall, especially in regions like the Highlands.\n\nSkiing and snowboarding are available in areas like Cairngorm and Glencoe – but be aware that the conditions can be more unpredictable than in other European ski destinations!\n\nEven Scotland’s cities, such as Edinburgh and Glasgow, sometimes see snow.\n\nWales\n\nIn Wales, snow is less frequent but still possible, particularly in mountainous areas like Snowdonia.\n\nCities like Cardiff may see the occasional snowfall, but it’s usually more a novelty than a seasonal expectation.\n\nNonetheless, the Welsh landscape takes on a distinct beauty when snow-dusted!\n\nIreland\n\nIf you’re wondering does it snow in Ireland and are keen to see some during your winter trip, bad news: Ireland generally experiences milder winters compared to other parts of the British Isles.\n\nSnowfall is rare but not impossible, particularly in inland and northern areas.\n\nWhen it does snow, the already green and rocky landscape takes on a softer, more muted tone that’s worth experiencing.\n\nCities like Dublin and Cork may see a dusting every now and then, but it’s rarely heavy enough to last. In Ireland, winter is more often characterized by rainy and windy conditions than by a blanket of snow.\n\nCentral Europe\n\nCentral Europe’s no stranger to snow.\n\nWhile the region’s cities don’t guarantee consistent snowfall every winter, they do have a moderate chance of receiving at least some!\n\nMountainous areas in this region offer a much higher likelihood of consistent snow conditions.\n\nThese elevated terrains are reliable spots for winter activities, attracting visitors eager for skiing, snowboarding, or snowshoeing.\n\nPoland\n\nSnow’s common in Poland, thanks to its continental climate.\n\nWarsaw, the nation’s capital, is no stranger to snow – although local friends have told me that in recent years it’s snowed a lot less due to global warming.\n\nKrakow sees slightly more snowfall, thanks to its proximity to the mountains.\n\nIt’s these mountains – the Tatra Mountains – that become a winter playground in the snowy season!\n\nWhether it’s taking a scenic cable car ride up to Kasprowy Wierch or snowshoeing through less frequented trails, Poland’s natural beauty is amplified by winter!\n\nHungary\n\nHungary’s winters are relatively mild, particularly in urban areas like Budapest, where snowfall is infrequent but not entirely uncommon.\n\nWhen it does snow, the historic architecture and the Danube River take on an extra layer of beauty.\n\nIn the Hungarian countryside, winter tends to be more pronounced.\n\nHungary does have a few ski and snowboarding resorts, although they’re generally better suited for beginners.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nIn Czech Republic (or Czechia, as it’s now called), cities like Prague, with historic castles and bridges, become even more enchanting under a layer of snow.\n\nFor the more adventurous, mountain ranges such as the Krkonoše provide a setting for winter activities like skiing and snowboarding.\n\nWhile the country isn’t primarily known for its winter sports, it does offer a selection of slopes that cater to various skill levels.\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovakia is a lesser-known winter destination!\n\nThe High Tatras mountains serve as the main hub for winter sports, boasting several ski resorts.\n\nSnowfall is more consistent in these elevated regions, making them ideal for a range of winter activities.\n\nUrban centers like Bratislava experience snowfall periodically, but it’s not common throughout the whole winter.\n\nBalkans\n\nIn the Balkans, snowfall varies, depending on if you’re in the coastal areas or the inland mountainous regions!\n\nAlong the coastline, where the Mediterranean climate reigns, snow is rare.\n\nHere, winters are milder, and even if temperatures do drop, the likelihood of snow is low.\n\nContrast this with the region’s interior, especially the mountain ranges, where snow’s usually abundant!\n\nThere are kiing, snowboarding, and snowshoeing opportunities here.\n\nThe snow cover in these areas often lasts through the winter season, offering a robust span of time to partake in your favourite winter activities.\n\nSlovenia\n\nIt can certainly snow in Slovenia!\n\nThe Julian Alps and other mountainous areas of Slovenia are covered in a consistent layer of snow, offering excellent conditions for skiing, snowboarding, and snowshoeing.\n\nCities like Ljubljana experience intermittent snowfall – and it looks even more beautiful under a snow covering!\n\nCroatia\n\nCroatia’s not synonymous with cooler winter weather, and indeed its coastal cities like Dubrovnik and Split seldom see snow.\n\nBut places around the Plitvice Lakes and the Dinaric Alps have more reliable snowfall in winter; although not as much as other European destinations!\n\nMontenegro\n\nMontenegro has quite a varied winter landscape.\n\nThough the coastal regions such as Budva and Kotor rarely see snow, it’s quite common in the northern mountain ranges like Durmitor, where there are ski resorts!\n\nAlbania\n\nSnow in Albania is generally confined to the mountainous regions in the north and east.\n\nWhile coastal and lowland areas, including the capital Tirana, have milder winters, places like the Albanian Alps get a good amount of snow.\n\nBosnia\n\nBosnia is an underrated place for snow.\n\nPlaces like Jahorina and Bjelašnica mountains have dependable snowfall and are well-equipped for winter sports.\n\nCities like Sarajevo do see snow, though not consistently.\n\nSerbia\n\nIt can snow throughout Serbia, although the surest bet for consistent snow lies in the mountainous regions.\n\nPlaces like Kopaonik and Tara are winter hotspots, receiving dependable snowfall ideal for skiing, snowboarding, and other winter activities.\n\nWhile the capital, Belgrade, and other low-lying areas see a more sporadic snowfall pattern, when it does snow, it adds a layer of wintry magic to the city’s already charming architecture and public spaces.\n\nMacedonia\n\nIn Macedonia, your best chance of encountering snow is in the higher elevations, especially the Šar Mountains and other ranges.\n\nHere, snowfall is consistent and provides excellent conditions for winter sports.\n\nLowland areas and cities like Skopje have quite sporadic snowfall.\n\nEastern Europe\n\nIn Eastern Europe, winter snowfall often depends on the proximity to the coast.\n\nAlong the Black Sea coast, you’ll find milder winter temperatures and less frequent snow.\n\nBut venture inland, particularly into the elevated regions, and you’ll discover a more dependable snowfall pattern that holds throughout the winter months.\n\nThese areas become prime locations for winter sports, with conditions suitable for skiing, snowboarding, and other activities that make the most of the snowy terrain.\n\nBulgaria\n\nSnowfall in Bulgaria is most dependable in the mountainous regions, particularly in places like Bansko and Pamporovo.\n\nThese areas offer an array of winter sports, from skiing and snowboarding to snowshoeing.\n\nIt snows sometimes in Sofia and other cities, too, although it’s become less common over the years as winters have been warmer.\n\nRomania\n\nRomania’s snowfall can be quite dependable, especially in the Carpathian Mountains.\n\nLocations like Poiana Brașov and Sinaia are winter sports havens.\n\nCities such as Bucharest see snowfall, but nowadays it tends to be more sporadic.\n\nTurkey\n\nYes, it does snow in Turkey – quite a lot in some places!\n\nCoastal cities such as Istanbul and Izmir see infrequent snow but regions like Erzurum and Kayseri offer consistent snowfall and are popular hubs for winter sports.\n\nEven Cappadocia, known for its unique rock formations, takes on a magical quality when sprinkled with snow – and snowfall here is quite common.\n\nBut snow on the south coast – places like Antalya and Fethiye – is rare.\n\nBaltic Countries\n\nIn the Baltic countries, snow is reliable during the winter months.\n\nThe coastal regions might experience milder conditions, but venture inland, and you’ll find more consistent snowfall that blankets forests and fields.\n\nEven the capital cities are quite famous for snow, and winter becomes an integral part of the local lifestyle!\n\nLatvia\n\nIn Latvia, winter snowfall is generally reliable, especially as you move away from the coast and towards the interior.\n\nRiga, the capital, experiences periods of snow, but it’s in the forests and natural parks where you’ll find more persistent snow conditions.\n\nThese areas are popular for winter activities like skiing and snowshoeing!\n\nLithuania\n\nLithuania’s snowfall is most consistent in its central and eastern regions, where you’ll find landscapes ideal for winter activities like cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.\n\nVilnius has a mix of snow and rain throughout the winter – but when it does snow, it transforms the urban environment into a wintry setting that complements the historic architecture.\n\nEstonia\n\nEstonia\n\nEstonia has one of the most reliable snowfalls among the Baltic countries, particularly in its southern regions.\n\nTallinn, the capital, usually sees a fair amount of snow, making it a picturesque destination in winter!\n\nThe country’s southern areas offer excellent conditions for skiing, snowboarding, and even ice fishing.\n\nIf you’re looking for dependable snow conditions, Estonia should be high on your list!\n\nSouthern Europe\n\nIn Southern Europe, snow is quite rare – but that doesn’t mean it’s entirely absent!\n\nCoastal regions and islands often bask in milder winter temperatures (many of them are known for their sunny winter weather) higher elevations see snow, and some area even ski resorts!\n\nAnd actually, in some areas, you can enjoy the Mediterranean beaches and ski resorts on the same day!\n\nSpain\n\nIn Spain, your chance of encountering snow largely depends on the region you’re in.\n\nIt snows in Madrid once every few years, but it’s not common – and it’s virtually unheard of (although not impossible!) in coastal cities like Barcelona and Malaga.\n\nConsistent snowfall is typically found in the northern regions and the Pyrenees.\n\nThese areas are prime locations for winter sports, with ski resorts that cater to varying skill levels.\n\nBut there’s also the Sierra Nevada, which is in Southern Spain’s Andalucia region, and is a popular ski resort too!\n\nPortugal\n\nSnowfall in Portugal is a rarity, primarily occurring in the higher elevations of the Serra da Estrela mountain range.\n\nWhile Lisbon and Porto seldom see snow, these mountain areas offer seasonal winter sports activities.\n\nItaly\n\nItaly’s snowfall patterns are as diverse as its landscapes.\n\nWhile cities like Rome and Naples rarely see snow, the northern regions and the Alps certainly do!\n\nThese areas are home to some of Europe’s premier ski resorts.\n\nIn contrast, the southern regions and the islands of Sardinia and Sicily are relatively snow-free, apart from in the mountains.\n\nMalta\n\nSnow in Malta is extremely rare, given its Mediterranean climate.\n\nWinters are generally mild, making it a destination for those looking to escape harsher winter conditions.\n\nWhile you won’t find traditional winter sports here, the milder temperatures offer a different sort of outdoor activity, like hiking and cycling.\n\nGreece\n\nIn Greece, snowfall is generally confined to the mountainous regions and the northern parts of the country.\n\nWhile Athens and the islands may see snowfall on rare occasions, places like Mount Olympus offer more dependable conditions for winter sports.\n\nCyprus\n\nIt can snow in Cyprus – it’s rare but possible in the Troodos Mountains.\n\nWhile coastal cities like Limassol and Paphos have milder winter temperatures,
