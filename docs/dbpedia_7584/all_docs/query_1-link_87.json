        "text": "The facts in Climate Fresk are sourced from the most respected scientific publications: the IPCC reports. These are the same reports that inform global political and economic decision-making at the highest level.\n\nClimate Fresk is neutral and objective and presents only established scientific facts.\n\nBy activating the group’s collective intelligence, Climate Fresk workshops enable participants to take ownership of the subject matter.\n\nThe Climate Fresk methodology doesn’t involve an expert presenting information to the group ; instead, it requires all participants to take an active role in the building-up of the Fresk, becoming participative learners.\n\nAs participants link the causes and effects of climate change, they are able to take a step back and understand the systemic nature of the challenges.\n\nThrough a shared understanding of the mechanisms at work, Climate Fresk enables both individuals and organisations to have an open and positive conversation about climate solutions.\n\nParticipants leave the workshop having formed a strong bond with each other, and are well equipped to implement the climate actions that they have identified.\n\nYou don’t need to be a climate expert to facilitate Climate Fresk workshops. The short training will teach you more about the climate crisis and give you the tools to run workshops for those around you.\n\nIt’s when you grasp the extent of the problem that you really step up. As a facilitator, you can have a great impact simply by sharing this knowledge with your friends, family, clients, colleagues and the wider public.\n\nThere is a pressing need for climate change training and demand is growing. Whether it’s running a workshop for your neighbours or consulting for a large corporation, there are so many opportunities to get involved. We’re waiting for you!"
