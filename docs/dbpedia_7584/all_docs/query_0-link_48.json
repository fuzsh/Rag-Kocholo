Although it only averages 7 days of snow per year,\n\nthe average temperature difference between summer and winter is a large 9.4 degrees. In addition, the city\n\naverages a high amount of precipitation (97.3 cm) and 49 days of thunderstorms per year, which can include\n\nhigh winds, hail and heavy rain.\n\nLondon, England experiences the least weather variety. London averages only 13 thunderstorm days\n\nannually and light precipitation is evenly spread throughout the year.\n\nThe Top 2 foggiest cities are in Italy (Milan and Rome). London is not even in the top 10.\n\nIn February 1998, a 250 vehicle accident occurred on a fog-bound highway in Italy. Rice fields south\n\nof Milan and pollution have historically helped to produce the fog of of this city.\n\nHelsinki, Finland has the most freezing days and the climate is similar to that of Alaska. 25% of\n\nFinland lies north of the Arctic Circle.

In the north, snow cover\n\nusually lasts for seven months, from mid-October to mid-May\n\nMadrid, Spain is the least humid city partly due to it being the highest capital in Europe at\n\n667 meters. Temperatures fall at night due to low humidity. Otherwise, Madrid would be\n\none of the hottest cities as well. The all-time highest European temperature occurred in Seville, Spain\n\non August 4th, 1881 when it was a scorching 50 C.\n\nAthens, Greece is the warmest because it is on the leeward side of several mountain ranges.

London is among the driest of Europe's capitals.\n\nAlthough most of Europe lies in latitudes more northerly than New York, the Atlantic Ocean tends\n\nto moderate temperatures\n\nAmsterdam is the most humid city. The city experiences 214 rainy days a year and most of this\n\nprecipitation falls during long periods of drizzle or light rain\n\nStockholm, Sweden averages only six hours of daylight during December, but on June 20th the sun\n\nrises at 3:30am and doesn't set until 10:09pm, for a total time of 18 hours 38 minutes.
