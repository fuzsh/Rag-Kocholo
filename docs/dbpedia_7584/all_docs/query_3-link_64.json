        "text": "Got a burning question about weather or snow conditions in the Alps?\n\nContact us and we'll do our best to answer it...\n\nSnowfall averages can be fun to compare but should be treated with caution, especially in Europe. This is partly because most alpine readings are taken at resort level and are not always representative of conditions higher up. (Some Alpine resorts have vertical drops of over 2000m).\n\nOn average, North American resorts have smaller vertical drops, and most readings are taken up the mountain in areas that are more representative of the ski area as a whole.\n\nThat aside, snowfall is only one part of the complex snow quality equation. You only have to look at our “Top 10 snowiest ski resorts\" in Europe to see that only two of them actually make our Top 10 snow-sure ski resorts in Europe.\n\nWhy? Most of the snowiest ski resorts in the Alps are close to the northern foothills, and are more vulnerable to the warming influence of the Atlantic. Obergurgl, for example, gets less than half the snowfall of Warth-Schröcken, but offers more consistent snow quality due to its superior altitude, and more sheltered position set deep within the Alps.\n\nWarth and Schröcken share the snowiest ski area in Europe, with a seasonal average of 10.5m. Other nearby villages are also super-snowy, such as Damüls, which gets over 9m a season and markets itself as the \"snowiest village in the world\".\n\nWhichever village comes out top, there is no doubt that this little corner of Austria is the snowiest region in the Alps."
