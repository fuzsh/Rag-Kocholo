        "text": "Touring the snow-capped mountains at night, drinking hot chocolate and above all enjoying the most beautiful white landscapes, is part of what you can do during your visit to Zurich during the winter.\n\nAmong the things you can see and do in Zurich during this season, you have to include snow skiing. In addition to that, I'll show you other less typical activities you can definitely do in Zurich during the winter, including sleeping in an igloo or even bathing in the exquisite hot springs this country has to offer.\n\n1. Climbing the Top of Europe\n\nTop of Europe is a place you can climb regardless of the weather or the season, but visiting the top of Europe during winter is one of the best experiences you can have during this season, because the views of the snow-capped mountain are truly beautiful.\n\nOn the other hand, another truly breathtaking experience is the ride on board one of the best scenic trains from Zurich, which will take you to see many of the Alpine villages that are located around the snow-capped mountains.\n\nOn your visit to Jungfraujoch you will have the opportunity to climb up to the observation deck, from where you will see the entire snow-capped mountain and take the most spectacular photos of your trip to Europe's highest peak.\n\n2. Ice skating on natural ice rinks\n\nIf there's one activity you're going to love in Zurich and the rest of Switzerland, it's ice skating. Winter brings with it sub-zero temperatures which help to create natural ice skating rinks.\n\nYou can do this activity for free in the city centre, but there are also different paid locations where you can rent a few minutes of ice skating. Also, if you want to see different natural ice rinks, I recommend taking a chairlift or a private bus tour of Zurich and be amazed by the natural sights.\n\n3. Warm up at the Lindt Home of Chocolate Museum\n\nIf you fancy a break from the snow and want to warm up, I recommend a visit to the Lindt Museum in Zurich, where you can enjoy interesting exhibitions on the history of chocolate and the brand, as well as unlimited chocolate tasting.\n\nDid you know that inside you'll find a chocolate fountain no less than 9 metres high? Because of such spectacular things like this and also because of the interactive tour included in the entrance ticket, this is an activity that I highly recommend you do with children on your trip to Zurich. I assure you that they will love it!\n\n4. Zurich Old Town Tour\n\nIf you thought the cold weather was going to stop you from exploring the old town, let me tell you that you were wrong. In Zurich the tours don't stop and the snow doesn't slow anyone down. In fact, quite the opposite.\n\nGrossmünster Church, Bahnhofstrasse, medieval houses and the Town Hall are just some of the places you can visit when you book a tour of Zurich's Old Town with an expert guide who will tell you interesting stories about the area.\n\nYou'll just need a good coat and a great desire to discover the most classic area of all.\n\n5. Sleep in an igloo\n\nThis is perhaps one of the most incredible experiences you can have during your visit to Zurich. For this experience you will have to go to one of the common skiing areas. They usually build igloos during the winter to offer visitors a completely different adventure.\n\nEach of the companies that offer this service usually make their own packages from which you can choose the one that best suits your abilities and needs. Among the comforts that you usually have inside the igloo are the thermal pools. The interesting thing about these experiences is that they can only be experienced during the winter, because in summer it is impossible to lift the igloo.\n\nIn addition to the thermal pools, other attractions that are usually offered inside these igloos are the welcome hot drinks service, sleeping bags and safety lamps with enough batteries.\n\n6. Sledging down the snowy mountains\n\nIf there's one thing that calls for adventure, it's sledging on snow, and if it's at night, so much the better. These experiences are common in Switzerland during the winter season and it's definitely an activity you can't miss out on.\n\nOne of the things I like most about this experience is that you can get on the sled and slide down from the top of the mountain with all the safety measures in place. Depending on the mountain you choose to sled down, you can eat a fondue beforehand to give you the energy you need to dare to do this activity.\n\nThere are many options for this experience, from night tobogganing in the early hours of the night, to guided tours when there is a full moon. It all depends on where you decide to experience it. But all in all, there are many ski resorts where you can also experience the adventure of tobogganing.\n\n7. Snowshoeing in the snow\n\nSnowshoeing is one of the most fun activities you can do in Zurich during the winter, but you do have to be careful with the snow as some places are softer than others.\n\nBecause of this situation, this hiking route, which is one of the best excursions to discover Switzerland from Zurich, is done with snowshoes, which will help you to walk better in the snow. Moreover, this walk through the glaciers and snowy areas of Switzerland is even more beautiful in winter because the snowy landscapes add to the experience.\n\nThe great thing about this activity is that many parks are set up for locals and tourists to hike in the snow using snowshoes. Many of these parks, where it's fun to explore and hike, are located within easy reach of Zurich.\n\n8. Bathing in the hot springs\n\nA dip in the hot springs is a must, as Switzerland is so cold in winter that the hot springs are an oasis for tourists and locals alike. There are many places to bathe in hot springs, both public and private with large crowds.\n\nIn addition to the hot springs, in Zurich you can find different places with a spa format where you can rent a hot spring pool. This is a good activity to do both with your family and friends, and to include the children.\n\nThe temperatures of these hot springs are usually around 40ºC, so you'll love the idea of relaxing in these baths while looking at the scenery around you, such as the snow-capped peaks and the colours dulled by the cold.\n\n9. Skiing in the snow\n\nA must-do in Switzerland is definitely skiing. This is an activity that you can do at any time of the year, but skiing in the snowy mountains during winter is definitely a more exciting and realistic experience thanks to the beautiful views.\n\nAnother advantage of skiing during winter is that the snow is usually a bit firmer and above all denser for skiing. There are many places that provide this service during the winter, so it won't be too difficult to find your place to do this activity.\n\nAmong the must-visit places to go snow skiing is St. Moritz, a village with approximately 87 ski slopes. As well as being one of the highest areas in Switzerland, it's home to the Winter Olympics, so it's an interesting place to visit in winter, whether you like skiing or just want to take in the scenery.\n\n10. Visit Mount Rigi\n\nIf you visit Mount Rigi in winter, you can't miss hiking around the snow and especially snowboarding. These are the favourite activities here. Besides, the views are breathtaking and the fresh air you breathe from this place is not only pleasant, but also ideal for your respiratory health.\n\nDepending on the type of tour you choose to take, you can take the cable car or even the cog railway for one of the best Swiss Alps tours from Zurich.\n\nMost of these full tours offer you the chance to visit Lucerne on your own for about two hours, which leaves you time to take some extra photos and have a traditional Swiss lunch. This is a great experience, especially if you are travelling with children, as Lucerne has a lot to offer for the little ones.\n\n11. Touring the Christmas markets\n\nOne of the best things to do in winter in Zurich is to visit the different Christmas markets. And definitely to enjoy Christmas in the city, it is advisable to make a trip to Zurich for at least 3 days.\n\nWhether you want to buy Christmas decorations, or you want to taste traditional Swiss sweets and food during the Christmas season, these are definitely the places where you can get caught up in the Christmas magic and enjoy the festivities with the best Swiss traditions.\n\nAn interesting fact about these Christmas markets is that Switzerland is home to one of the largest and most colourful in Europe, which is located in the centre of Zurich, right inside the train station. The city of Basel, close to Zurich, is also a place where you can find the creations of more than 200 artisans who come together to show their talent at Christmas.\n\n12. Paragliding in the Alps\n\nIf you like more extreme tourism then you will definitely love this activity. If paragliding in the summer is already a rewarding experience, then going in the winter in search of adventure is an unforgettable experience.\n\nOne of the things I most appreciate and like to mention about this adventure is the incredible view of the Alps that you can have from the heights. The best thing about it is that you can feel completely safe paragliding because in Switzerland this activity has been perfected a lot, which is a plus if you are looking for adventure with safety.\n\nFrom the top you can take as many pictures as you want because the view is truly breathtaking. But before you go paragliding, you should know that it is important to follow the instructions of your expert guide to avoid accidents.\n\nWhat are the temperatures like in Zurich in winter?\n\nIn Switzerland, winter arrives around November, when temperatures start to drop sharply, with a maximum of 7°C and a minimum of 2°C. The cold season in Switzerland lasts until March, with the coldest months being December and January. In the last month of the year, temperatures are close to 4ºC at the maximum and -1ºC at the minimum.\n\nIn terms of humidity, the winter is usually quite wet, with January and February being the months with the highest rainfall. And if you want to know what the skies will be like, the truth is that the cloudiest months during the winter are November and January.\n\nWinter tourist numbers in Zurich\n\nZurich is clearly not a particularly busy city during the winter, so tourist numbers are much lighter during these months of the year. However, it can pick up a little around December due to the Christmas season.\n\nThe lower tourist numbers make it easier to find accommodation to stay in, restaurants to eat in and you're sure to be able to book more easily.\n\nWinter prices in Zurich\n\nIt's no secret that Zurich is one of the most expensive cities in Europe, so at any time of the year you're bound to notice the difference compared to other European capitals. But in the case of the winter season in this city, prices are lower than in summer.\n\nIf you would like to go to Zurich in winter, you should know that the best time (financially) to do so if you need to save money is in the days before December.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're looking to save a lot more money, you should book online, where you can book well in advance so that you don't miss out on any of the attractions in and around the city.\n\nWhat to pack for winter in Zurich?\n\nWinter is definitely a time when temperatures drop to very hostile levels, so warm clothes are a must in your suitcase when visiting the city. Closed-toe and ice-walking shoes are another must-have.\n\nI recommend that you take protective creams for your skin because the cold can irritate you if you don't take the necessary precautions. Although it may seem contradictory, you can't forget to include a swimming costume in your list of things to take on your winter trip. At hot springs you will hardly find swimming costume rentals, so it's best to bring your own."
