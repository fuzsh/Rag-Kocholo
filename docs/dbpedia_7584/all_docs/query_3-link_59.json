        "text": "Travel was halted across Europe Saturday as heavy snow blanketed cities and freezing temperatures set in following a week of deadly early-season storms.\n\nFlights were grounded in Munich and Dublin Saturday after a winter storm dumped snow across southern Germany and parts of Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic, disrupting travel across the continent.\n\nHundreds of flights in and out of Munich were canceled and not expected to resume until Sunday morning, the airport announced.\n\nVideo captured airplanes and the tarmac at Munich Airport blanketed in white as crews worked to clear the wintery mess.\n\nDelays of an hour or more were reported at London, Vienna and Zurich airports, according to tracking service Flightaware.\n\nTen Dublin flights were canceled, including one arriving from Munich and another departing to Amsterdam, as snow and icy conditions made for treacherous conditions, the Irish Independent reported.\n\nGlasgow Airport suspended all flights Saturday morning due to “heavier than forecast snow,” but resumed flight operations several hours later, it said on X.\n\nIn Austria and Switzerland, the snow led officials to sound the alarm for potential avalanches.\n\nSporting events across the UK were canceled, including 11 Scottish soccer matches.\n\nIn the past week, 10 people died in snowstorms that rocked Ukraine, leaving some trapped in thousands of stranded vehicles, according to officials.\n\nThe Guardian reported that 1,500 towns and villages in the war-ravaged nation were left without power, with one snowstorm in Odesa leaving 2,500 people needing to be rescued and about 850 vehicles requiring towing.\n\nFour people were reported dead in Moldova as the result of snowstorms. Two of the bodies were recovered from cars buried in snow drifts.\n\nWinter even arrived atop the summits of Hawaii, which saw the first flakes of the season due to the Kona Low weather system that brought heavy rain to lower elevations starting Wednesday.\n\nIt is expected to slow over the weekend, according to Fox Weather.\n\nBefore weakening, the system drenched eastern Maui with a much-needed 10 inches of rain and 2 feet of rainfall soaked the Big Island.\n\nThe inactive volcano Mauna Kea received around 5 inches of snow on Thursday.\n\n“It was winter kicking off on top of the summit, just like we’re seeing elsewhere in the US this time of year,” Fox Weather meteorologist Samantha Thomas told The Post.\n\nWhile those patterns can be expected, experts are keeping an eye on several feet of snow continuing to fall through Saturday in Oregon and Washington.\n\nHeavy snow will be confined to higher elevations, causing an increased flood risk for western-facing slopes of the Cascades.\n\n“Put simply, now you’re getting tons of heavy rain falling on top of the feet of snow that just fell which adds to a bigger flood threat. So that’s going to be the concern as we go into Sunday, Monday and Tuesday across the Pacific Northwest,” Thomas said.\n\nThe heavy rain and high elevation snow will continue in the Pacific Northwest, Rockies and parts of the Great Basin through the weekend, the National Weather Service forecast.\n\nRain will also return to the New York area overnight and continue through Sunday, with up to an inch possible and temperatures in the low 50s. The sun is expected back on Monday, but the thermometer will stay in the low 50s.\n\nWith Post wires"
