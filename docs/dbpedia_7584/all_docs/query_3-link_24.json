Will there still be big crowds? When does Switzerland’s autumn foliage appear? Can I still see snow?\n\nThis article will answer all your questions about what it’s like to explore Switzerland in one of the best months of the year. Here’s why you should choose September for your next Swiss escape.\n\nGet a great deal on a Swiss getaway in September with our Extra Savings on September deals\n\nSwitzerland weather and crowds in September\n\nSeptember marks the beginning of autumn or fall, and the low season for tourism as the masses of European summer holidaymakers return to work and school. With generally warm, sunny weather across parts of the country, you can still enjoy blissful outdoor activities with much thinner crowds.\n\nOf course, it’s a mountainous country, so if you are planning on travelling to Switzerland in September you’ll need to pack warmer layers and jackets for those high altitude adventures. There’s no fresh snow, and that means no winter ski sports, but there’s plenty of outdoor activities to enjoy and you’ll still see snow covering the highest peaks.\n\nWeather wise, September is a lovely month to visit. The city of Zürich averages between 10.5°C (51°F) and 19°C (66°F), Lucerne receives similar weather while Geneva is a little warmer. If you head up into the high altitude of the Swiss Alps, expect average temperatures of around 7°C (45°F). September in Switzerland can bring a little bit of rain so pack a raincoat or umbrella too.\n\nGET INSPIRED BY: Best of Switzerland\n\nRELATED BLOG: 6 unmissable natural wonders to discover in Switzerland\n\nWhere to go in Switzerland in autumn\n\nEverywhere!

This time of year Switzerland is overflowing with beauty and you’ll want to visit the lakes, mountains and cities to experience it all.\n\nIn the cities, like Zurich, Geneva, Lucerne, Bern and Basil, the streets are alive with locals enjoying the last weeks of pleasant weather before the cooler days of winter start to creep in. Enjoy lunch in the sunshine on warmer days, or get cosy indoors with fondue as the weather dips.\n\nIt’s harvest time for vineyards and fruit trees. Look for workers in the fields and grapevines hanging heavy with fruit as you journey through the countryside. If you pass through Valais, Switzerland’s top wine region, you can trek through the vines or enjoy a tasting.\n\nIf you like mountain hiking the trails will be quiet with no fresh snowfall, making it easier to navigate the trails without any icy surprises. Towards the end of the month the tree foliage will start changing to golden hues, a glorious contrast to the snowy mountain peaks.\n\nGET INSPIRED BY: Switzerland & Austria\n\nSeptember events in Switzerland\n\nSeptember is a time of harvest in Switzerland.
