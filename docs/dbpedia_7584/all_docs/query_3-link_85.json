        "text": "This page serves as a location to find past weather event information for northern Illinois and northwest Indiana.\n\nTo the right is a link to Storm Data, a monthly publication by the NWS's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). Storm Data will list all of the finalized, quality controlled hazardous weather reports and damage survey assessments within the NWS Chicago County Warning Area broken down by month. These publications are available three months after the end of the month. To the lower right, there is a thumbnail link to a searchable database of these quality controlled reports.\n\nFurther below on this page are individual event reviews for the local area sorted by event type. Many of these are archived stories from web top news headlines on our home page in the hours to days after the events occurred. Click on the date to jump to the full archived event review. Each story contains data and records from the event, and often meteorological insight and photos. To quickly search for an event that you may not recall the date of, click the \"All\" tab, hit Ctrl + F to search your browser, and enter the event and/or city or county impacted."
