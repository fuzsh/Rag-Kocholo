        "text": "The Best Time to Visit Switzerland\n\nSD › Best Time to Visit Switzerland\n\nUpdated: May 27, 2021\n\nBy Santorini Dave\n\nSee Also\n\nBest Hotels in Switzerland for Families\n\nSwitzerland with Kids\n\nWhen is the Best Time to Visit Switzerland?\n\nWinter and summer are excellent times to visit Switzerland as the mountainous country is popular for both skiing and hiking. January and February are ideal for skiing with below freezing temperatures, making snow practically guaranteed in places around 5,000 feet in elevation. There is likely to be snow in lower valleys but not in such large amounts.\n\nBest Time for Sightseeing: The best time for sightseeing in Switzerland is when the weather is pleasantly warm, generally around mid-April through mid-October. To avoid the biggest crowds while still enjoying a decent chance for good weather, plan to go at either end of that time frame, mid-April through May or mid-September through mid-October.\n\nBest Time to Visit for Good Weather: For warm weather with the least chance for rain, plan to visit Switzerland in July or September. Temperatures typically range in the low to upper 20s, with an average of 80mm of precipitation, quite a bit less than June or August.\n\nBest Time for Snow Sports: Switzerland is famous for skiing and snowboarding, with the best snow typically in January and February, although the first high-elevation slopes typically open in November and close in March.\n\nBest Time for Hiking: When all the snow has melted, Switzerland is a top spot for hiking. By late April or early May, trails up to around 6,500 feet in elevation should be mostly clear, although they can be muddy. By June, while the highest trails are likely to still have snow, most will be open, and the cable cars will be operating again too. Hiking is usually possible through early October and sometimes longer, but higher trails may be covered with snow by the latter half of the month. This is usually when cable cars stop operating and the pass roads begin to close for winter.\n\nSwitzerland Travel Seasons\n\nHigh Season (mid-June through mid-September, mid-December through February): Switzerland has two high seasons, basically the peak of summer and most of the winter, starting just before Christmas stretching through February due to the popularity of both hiking and snow sports here. This is when you’ll find the biggest crowds and the highest prices of the year when it comes to accommodation and airfare.\n\nShoulder Season (Mid-April through mid-June and mid-September through mid-October): The shoulder season in Switzerland occurs from the middle of spring until just before summer and around the first month of fall. It can be a great time to enjoy hiking with pleasant temperatures and few crowds. You might find some discounted airfares and hotel rates too.\n\nLow Season (mid-October through mid-December and mid-March through mid-April): The low season in Switzerland occurs outside of peak hiking and skiing times, but it’s a good time to visit if you’re looking for more budget-friendly airfare and room rates. While it may be damp and chilly, there’s likely to be a lot less shoulder-rubbing when enjoying the sights.\n\nSwitzerland Weather by Month\n\nSwitzerland Weather in January: While the temperature varies depending on your particular destination, January is the coldest month of the year in Switzerland with the average high in Zurich just 2°C and nighttime temperatures that dip below zero at -2°C. Many places throughout the country will get at least a dusting of snow with the exception of low altitude areas such as Ticino near the border of Italy. The days will be short with sunrise at around 9 a.m. and sunset around 5 p.m., so you’ll need to plan your itinerary accordingly. This is the time to bring warm winter clothing like thermal underwear, a down jacket, gloves, wool socks, and waterproof boots. The average precipitation in January is 70mm over 15 days, so you’ll likely experience at least some wet weather.\n\n(Average Max Temperature: 2°C. Average Precipitation: 70mm.)\n\nSwitzerland Weather in February: February brings warmer weather to Switzerland with the afternoon high increasing four degrees to 6°C now. With the low still at -2°C and the amount of precipitation about the same at 70mm over 13 days this month, it’s usually snowy. The days are getting longer now, so you’ll have more daylight for enjoying the slopes and the sights, with nearly 11 hours by the end of February when sunrise is at just after 7 a.m. and sunset at 6:08 p.m. Pack the same clothing as last month, with plenty of layers topped with a warm coat. Because you’re likely to experience more bright, sunny days, be sure to bring sunglasses and don’t forget the sunscreen either.\n\n(Average Max Temperature: 6°C. Average Precipitation: 70mm.)\n\nSwitzerland Weather in March: Spring is almost here now and with it, even warmer temperatures with the mercury climbing to 11°C in the afternoon and the low temperature now above freezing at 3°C. If you’re hoping to ski, you’ll still be able to find snow at the higher-elevation resorts along with the increasingly warm rays of the sun, at least until late in the month. By the end of March, most ski resorts will have closed. Now is the time to not only pack those warm layers but a few short-sleeve shirts along with sunscreen and sunglasses.\n\n(Average Max Temperature: 11°C. Average Precipitation: 70mm.)\n\nSwitzerland Weather in April: Temperatures have warmed up enough now that skiing is unlikely. It’s a quieter time in Switzerland, with skiers and boarders back home, while summer’s hikers have yet to arrive. The average high temperature increases another four degrees to 15°C although nights and early mornings will still be quite chilly with the low temperature at 3°C. As the month progresses it will get increasingly warmer. Now is the time to bring a mixed bag with items for both cold and warmer weather. As it typically rains on about 18 days this month, bringing an average of 70mm of precipitation, you may want to throw in a waterproof jacket. When you’re out hiking, there’s a good chance you’ll see colorful wildflowers now, so be sure and keep an eye out when in the meadows.\n\n(Average Max Temperature: 15°C. Average Precipitation: 70mm.)\n\nSwitzerland Weather in May: May is an unpredictable month in Switzerland. It can be quite pleasant or rather miserable, but you can be almost sure that whatever you’re experiencing now will be different tomorrow. The afternoon high averages 20°C while the low has increased quite a bit too, to 7°C, well above freezing. There is a greater chance of rain, with 90mm over 17 days, which when combined with the unpredictability, means bringing a wide range of clothing along with a waterproof jacket and sunglasses is advised.\n\n(Average Max Temperature: 20°C. Average Precipitation: 90mm.)\n\nSwitzerland Weather in June: June is likely to be pleasantly warm with the average high climbing to 21°C, and the days wonderfully long. On the summer solstice, June 21st, the sun rises at about 5:30 a.m. and doesn’t set until almost 9:30 p.m. This month is the calm before the storm, with the chance to get out on the trails before peak crowds arrive in July and August. There is a greater chance of rain, with the average precipitation increasing to 110mm over 18 days so be sure to pack a waterproof jacket along with clothing that can be layered. It will still be cool on those early morning hikes with the low temperature at 11°C but afternoons will likely be quite warm.\n\n(Average Max Temperature: 21°C. Average Precipitation: 110mm.)\n\nSwitzerland Weather in July: July is part of the peak summer season, a time when some of the biggest crowds and the warmest temperatures are typically enjoyed. The afternoon high rises to 24°C while precipitation decreases quite a bit down to 80mm over 17 days. It’s the perfect time to enjoy the open-air festivals, hike in the mountains, and take advantage of the lakes, which become popular spots to hang out and escape the heat. Bring summer attire now, along with a light jacket or sweater for evenings and early mornings.\n\n(Average Max Temperature: 24°C. Average Precipitation: 80mm.)\n\nSwitzerland Weather in August: While the average high is the same as last month at 24°C, in many places it rarely dips below 30°C for days at a time, making swimming in one of the lakes an especially popular pursuit now. There’s more rainfall now, however, especially during the first half of the month, which can help cool things off. And you won’t have to worry about getting too warm at night with the low at 13°C. Bring that lightweight summer clothing, including a bathing suit, along with a light waterproof jacket.\n\n(Average Max Temperature: 24°C. Average Precipitation: 120mm.)\n\nSwitzerland Weather in September: September is a wonderful time to be in Switzerland, with the crowds thinning and the weather is still quite warm, especially during the first half of the month. The average high temperature dips to 20°C this month but expect it to be warmer the earlier in September you arrive. Rainfall decreases now to 80mm, with a reduced chance as the month progresses. The low temperature is just 10°C so you will need to bring a range of clothing for both warm and cool weather.\n\n(Average Max Temperature: 20°C Average Precipitation: 80mm.)\n\nSwitzerland Weather in October: It will be crisp and cool in October, and with summer gone while snow is still weeks away, it’s a great time to visit Switzerland to avoid the crowds. The high temperature is just 14°C and the low plunges even further to 7°C, so be sure to bundle up. Rain is always a possibility but it’s usually light, with 70mm of precipitation over 21 days now. Plan to dress in layers for both warmer and cooler and days along with chilly early mornings and nights. With the time change this month, plan for shorter days too. In late October, the sun rises a little after 7 a.m. and sets at 5:11 p.m.\n\n(Average Max Temperature:14°C. Average Precipitation: 70mm.)\n\nSwitzerland Weather in November: November kicks off the potential for the winter season to begin with the possibility of some ski resorts opening, especially in the higher elevations. Of course, it’s never a guarantee as it may not happen anywhere until early December. The average afternoon high is now just 7°C and the low is slightly above freezing at 2°C. It’s time to pack your winter clothing now, preparing for snow just in case by bringing a heavy waterproof coat, wool socks, gloves, waterproof boots, and the like.\n\n(Average Max Temperature: 7°C. Average Precipitation: 70mm.)\n\nSwitzerland Weather in December: Another one of the chilliest months of the year in Switzerland, there’s a good chance for snow now with the low temperature below freezing at -1°C and 70mm of precipitation on average over 16 days now. It’s a wonderful time to be here to enjoy skiing, boarding, and the Christmas markets that give many towns an especially magical feel. Just plan to bundle up with that winter gear, and sip cider in between activities to stay warm.\n\n(Average Max Temperature: 4°C. Average Precipitation: 70mm.)\n\nSwitzerland Events and Festivals\n\nSwitzerland in January\n\nNew Year’s Day – January 1 is a national holiday in Switzerland, with most businesses closed, although there are usually some shops and restaurants open.
