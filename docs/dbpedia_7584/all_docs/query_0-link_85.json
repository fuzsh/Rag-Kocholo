        "text": "How and when are measurements taken?\n\nBefore discussing the earliest and average date of the first measurable snowfall, a few explanations on how and when measurements are taken. MeteoSwiss measures the new snowfall in centimeters and the total snow depth in the morning at 6 UTC, i.e. at 8 a.m. during summer time and at 7 a.m. Swiss time during winter time. A day with a snow cover only appears in the statistics if there is at least 1 centimeter of snow at 6 a.m. UTC. Occasionally there is a case where a blanket of snow forms, which then melts again in the morning or there is only a small patch of snow that cannot be measured. So it may well be that it was white once, but the day does not appear as a snow day in the weather annals.\n\nEarliest date: Usually October\n\nTable 1 shows the date of the earliest measurable snowfall (at least 1 centimeter) for some large cities in the lowlands and deep Alpine valleys since measurements began. It can be seen that the date varies from the beginning of September in Chur to the beginning of November in Geneva and Lugano. In most places, the earliest snow day is in October (see also Fig. 1).\n\nStation Date Data since Basel-Binningen 23.10.2003 1930 Berne 25.10.1931 1897 Chur 05.09.1984 1888 Geneva 04.11.1980 1958 Lugano 04.11.1974 1864 Lucerne 07.10.1936 1883 Sion 29.10.2008 1958 St. Gallen 24.09.2002 1938 Zurich Airport 27.10.2012 1985\n\nTable 1: Earliest date of first snowfall (at least 1 centimeter of snow with morning measurement at 6 a.m. UTC)\n\nAverage date: Mostly first half of December\n\nTable 2 shows the average date for the first measurable snowfall since 2001, which is usually in the first half of December. In St. Gallen, which is at slightly higher altitude, the first snowfall occurs on average on November 11 and in Chur on November 25, whereas in Geneva it does not occur until December 17 and in Lugano on December 25. Occasionally, there have also been winters with no snow at all, such as in the winter of 2019/2020 in Basel, Bern and Zurich. On the other hand, it has also happened that a lot of snow fell in the second half of November (see Fig. 2).\n\nStation Date Basel-Binningen 12.12. Berne 04.12. Chur 25.11. Geneva 17.12. Lugano 25.12. Sion 11.12. St. Gallen 11.11. Zurich-Airport 07.12.\n\nTable 2: Average date of the first snowfall\n\nAnd this year?\n\nAt the stations under consideration, it briefly turned white in Bern on the Sunday before last (November 12) with a warm front (see Fig. 3), but the snow quickly melted again and it was already green again on Monday morning at the time of the snow measurement.\n\nNext weekend will be exciting in terms of the first snow: With a low pressure system over north-eastern Europe, increasingly colder air will flow in on Friday with a north-westerly current, causing the snow line to drop to low altitudes on Saturday night. It will remain there over the weekend and at the beginning of the week. However, there will only be occasional wet snow showers in the lowlands, which are unlikely to be heavy (see Fig. 4).\n\nThe situation is different in the northern Alpine valleys, where snow and even a thick blanket of snow can be expected again and again with northern accumulation. This applies in particular to St. Gallen and Chur at the stations under consideration, while there is unlikely to be any measurable fresh snow at the other stations in the north, although it may become a little white in places. There will certainly be no snow (or precipitation) in southern Ticino, which is protected from the humid air masses.\n\nThere is no sign of stabilization or major moderation in the coming week either, and the situation from the weekend is likely to repeat itself in the second half of the week. So it remains exciting in terms of snow, MeteoNews will keep you up to date in any case.\n\nAnd in the future?"
