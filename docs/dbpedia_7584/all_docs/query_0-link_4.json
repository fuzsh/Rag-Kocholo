        "text": "Temperatures have been three degrees Celsius higher than average over the past three months, in what has been the warmest winter since measurements began 140 years ago.\n\nThe national weather service, MeteoSwiss, said the densely populated lowlands were the most affected, with average temperatures of 5°C in Basel and 3.7°C in Zurich.\n\nAfter two relatively cold winters, the report said, this year’s high temperatures have been more in line with the trend of the past few decades towards warmer weather at this time of year.\n\n“Since the mid-1970s, there has been a clear rise in average monthly temperatures in winter,” MeteoSwiss said on its website.\n\nThe high temperatures have been reflected in the lack of snow, particularly in low-lying areas and in the north of the country.\n\nZurich, for example, receives an average of 70cm of new snow spread over 16 days in December, January and February. But there has only been 12cm of snow this year, which fell over the course of two days.\n\nMeteoSwiss said the situation was similar in other towns and cities. The only year with less snow was 1989/90 when Zurich reported 3cm.\n\nPlaces at higher altitudes – in the pre-Alps – have also suffered, receiving only a quarter of the snowfall of an average winter which quickly melted due to above freezing temperatures.\n\nMany ski resorts with runs concentrated below 1,500m have been unable to operate for much of the season.\n\nGlobal warming"
