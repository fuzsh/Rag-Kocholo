        "text": "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the United Kingdom or the UK) is a constitutional monarchy comprising most of the British Isles. It is a union of four constituent countries: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, each of which has something unique and exciting for visitors.\n\nWhilst a \"British\" culture is evident across the entire United Kingdom, many counties, regions, and constituent countries have their own distinct culture and heritage, which can be passionately displayed or debated in equal measure. The UK is also a diverse patchwork of native and immigrant cultures, possessing both a fascinating history and dynamic modern attractions. This is a country known for its eccentric and subversive popular culture, its creation of five major sports (golf, rugby, cricket, lawn tennis and, of course, football) and for having a music scene that may be the best in the world. Witness thousands of years of history, with stone circles, castles, thatched cottages and palaces; in these islands the past comes alive.\n\nThe capital and largest city is London, a truly global metropolis like no other, and many of the country’s other cities have much to offer. To understand their diversity, compare genteel Oxford with brooding Edinburgh, gentrifying Manchester, musical Liverpool, sports-mad Cardiff, the cultural melting pot of Birmingham or newly thriving Belfast, while remembering these are but the tip of the iceberg. Although Britannia no longer rules the waves, it continues to be hugely influential in the wider world and welcomes over 30 million visitors to its shores each year.\n\nWhether you wish to walk in the steps of giants in Antrim, to immerse yourself in Celtic culture at Eisteddfod, to pound the streets of an English urban jungle, to climb, ski or snowboard in the Cairngorms, or to dream of having tea with the King, there is something for everyone in the United Kingdom.\n\nVisit Britain is the tourist bureau for all of the UK.\n\nRegions\n\n[edit]\n\nHome nations\n\n[edit]\n\nEngland\n\nThe largest component by size and by population. This \"Green and pleasant land\" has some of the most exciting and inspiring cities in the world, which exist alongside the \"Merrie England\" of rolling countryside, village greens and traditional pageantry.\n\nScotland\n\nThe second largest home nation occupies the northern third of Great Britain. Bagpipes, kilts and haggis may spring to mind, but the contrast between the remote beauty of the Islands, cosmopolitan grittiness of the Lowlands and desolate panoramas of the wild Highlands reveals the Scotland beyond the stereotype.\n\nWales\n\nThis hilly western peninsula of Great Britain is home to an ancient Celtic language and culture, spectacular sceneries of mountain, valley and coast, a wealth of industrial heritage and some of the most impressive defensive castles in Europe.\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nThe north-eastern part of the island of Ireland is off the traditional tourist trail, but offers a colourful history, exceptional natural beauty, rapidly-developing cities and warmly welcoming inhabitants.\n\nCrown Dependencies and Overseas Territories\n\n[edit]\n\nBritish Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories are non-sovereign territories under UK jurisdiction. However, they are not part of the UK and are mostly self-governing.\n\nChannel Islands (Guernsey (including Alderney, Herm and Sark), Jersey)\n\nSmall islands off the coast of France, with a unique Anglo-Norman culture and tax haven status. The archipelago has a comparatively warm climate, and has a lot of relics from the Axis occupation during the Second World War.\n\nIsle of Man\n\nA small island between Great Britain and Ireland in the Irish Sea, with its own Celtic language and customs. Mann is known for having the annual TT motorcycle races, the oldest parliament in the world, tailless cats and three-legged flags.\n\nThe UK's overseas territories comprise Akrotiri and Dhekelia, Anguilla, Bermuda, British Antarctica, British Indian Ocean Territory, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, the Pitcairn Islands, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. As these mostly have separate immigration rules and very different climates and travel arrangements from the UK proper, they are covered in separate articles.\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\nMany cities and towns in the United Kingdom are of interest to travellers. Following is a selection of nine - others are listed under their specific regions:\n\n— the capital and largest city of the United Kingdom is one of the most influential cities on Earth. Home to most of the UK's principal tourist attractions, London's landmarks are instantly recognisable the world over as symbols for Britain\n\n— the capital of Northern Ireland is in the midst of an urban renaissance, and is fast becoming a popular tourist destination due in part to its reputation as being somewhat undiscovered, but also as testament to the unique character of this city and its inhabitants.\n\n— an historical city famed for its colourful Georgian architecture, impressive Victorian engineering landmarks and nautical heritage. These days Bristol is equally known for trip-hop music and a significant \"foodie\" culture\n\n— the capital of Wales is equally proud of its coal-shipping past as of its rugby fandom. Come for Cymru's top museums, stay for Cardiff Bay's much-applauded regeneration\n\n— capital of Scotland and second most-visited city in the UK. In August it hosts the largest arts festival in the world; all year round, visitors admire Edinburgh's illustrious history, stunning vistas and uniquely Scottish traditions\n\n— Scotland's largest city, with great shopping and better architecture. Glasgow's former status as European Capital of Culture hints at the strength of its creative arts scene and the beauty of its parks and gardens\n\n— historically an important port city, the Guinness World Records' global capital of pop, the \"Pool of Life\" is now where science and culture meet bohemian nightlife against a sporting and musical setting that needs no introduction\n\n— the archetypal \"northern city\" which has transformed itself from textile town to modern metropolis. Highlights include a thriving bohemian music scene, the Gay Village and the world's only new work arts festival\n\n— the ancient historic capital of Yorkshire, with Roman, Viking and Medieval architecture\n\nOther destinations\n\n[edit]\n\n— 40,000 basalt columns rise spectacularly out of the sea at Northern Ireland's only UNESCO site\n\n— located in Swansea, this picturesque peninsular was designated the UK's first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Perfect for bracing cliff-top walks and relaxing on sandy beaches.\n\n— Britain's own Great Wall once defended Rome from the Pictish hordes\n\n— \"Scotland in miniature\" packs in mountain, sea, beach and forest and a geologically diverse terrain\n\n— the land of Wordsworth brings together England's highest mountains and largest lakes\n\n— The world's most famous loch is definitely not home to anything out of the ordinary — or is it?\n\n— Britain's first and most-visited national park, loved by millions for its beauty and accessibility\n\n— Wales' answer to the Alps is the place in Britain for extreme outdoor pursuits\n\n— these 4,500-year-old stones still baffle archaeologists, inspire believers and enchant all manner of visitors\n\nUnderstand\n\n[edit]\n\nCapital London Currency pound sterling (GBP) Population 67.3 million (2021) Electricity 230 volt / 50 hertz (BS 1363) Country code +44 Time zone UTC±00:00 Emergencies 999, 112 Driving side left\n\nNote: Widespread industrial action is taking place.

As an island country, it offers a wide range of history, shared culture, pulse of vibrating cities, and miles of stunning countryside.\n\nOrientation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe UK occupies all of the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern portion of the island of Ireland and most of the remaining British Isles. The other part of the British Isles is the Republic of Ireland, which gained its independence in 1922. The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands are crown dependencies, governing themselves by their own legislatures with Crown assent. These dependencies are not part of the United Kingdom, but neither are they completely sovereign nations.\n\nThe four constituent nations: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland each has its own capital city: London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.\n\nThe \"Great\" in Great Britain is due to it being the largest of the British Isles, as well as to distinguish it from the other, smaller \"Britain\": Brittany in north-west France. This terminology has been in use since the time of Ptolemy. \"Britain\" is often used as another name for the United Kingdom.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Medieval Britain and Ireland, British Empire, Industrial Britain\n\nGreat Britain and Ireland have been inhabited since at least the last Ice Age, more than 10,000 years ago. While little is known about the inhabitants of the Stone Age British Isles, the world famous monument of Stonehenge and dozens of other surviving stoneworks around the islands survive to this day as a testament to their legacy.\n\nThe people of the British Isles were known as the Prettanoi by the Greeks, giving rise to the terms 'British' and 'Britain'. Some three thousand years ago, the people started to become influenced by the Celtic languages and culture from mainland Europe. The islands were, over time, to become almost completely Celtic-speaking.\n\nWritten history of Britain is generally understood to have begun with the Roman occupation of much of England and Wales, as well as the southern part of Scotland as the province of Britannia. Following the fall of the Roman garrison in Britain, the island was subsequently settled by waves of Germanic peoples, collectively known as the Anglo-Saxons. The Anglo-Saxons made little impact genetically, but a very large impact socially. The Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Cornish and Breton languages of today are known to be descended from the original language of the Britons. Modern-day English is primarily descended from the historical Germanic Saxon language with influences from Celtic, French, Latin and others.\n\nThe British Isles came to be ruled by separate kingdoms, with the Kingdom of England in the south, the Kingdom of Ireland in the west, and the Kingdom of Scotland in the north. The Principality of Wales was absorbed into the Kingdom of England by two acts of the English parliament in 1535 and 1542 respectively. For many years, the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland fought wars for control over the whole of Great Britain. This came to an end in 1603 with the Union of the Crowns when the Scottish King James VI inherited the southern throne and styled himself \"King James I of Great Britain and Ireland\". In 1707 the parliaments of England and Scotland (under English pressure) passed the Acts of Union (1707) abolishing a separate Scottish Parliament, although significant support for Scottish independence remains to this day. Despite losing the 13 colonies that became the United States of America after the American War of Independence (1775-1783), Britain continued to grow wealthy from trade and possessions in the East. In 1801, after the British and Irish parliaments (under British pressure) passed the Acts of Union (1801), the enlarged kingdom became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (UK). Decisive victories over Napoleonic forces at the battles of Trafalgar in 1805 and, ten years later, Waterloo (in which Napoleon met his final defeat) cemented the UK's place as one of the dominant political and military powers in the world.\n\nDuring the next 50 years the UK grew, under Queen Victoria, into the major world power and the leader of the Industrial Revolution, eventually possessing the largest empire the world had ever seen. At its widest extent in the early 20th century, the British Empire encompassed what is today, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Hong Kong, India, South Africa, Egypt and numerous other colonies in Asia, Africa and the New World.\n\nThe United Kingdom and its allies were victorious during the First World War, after which it gained many territories from the defeated Germany, Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary. At its greatest extent, the British Empire was known as the empire on which the sun never sets, as its colonies covered every single time zone.\n\nIrish nationalists resisted British rule, driven in part by the Catholic–Protestant conflict. Eventually the United Kingdom agreed to grant self-government as the Irish Free State in 1922, with six of the northern counties without an overwhelmingly Catholic majority remaining part of the UK as Northern Ireland. The Irish Free State eventually severed all ties and became the Republic of Ireland in 1949.\n\nThe Second World War became the turning point in the history of the British Empire. The German Third Reich, under Adolf Hitler, ignored British ultimatums not to invade Poland and the UK and France declared war. While the UK was victorious in the famous aerial Battle of Britain and was spared the fate of occupation by the Wehrmacht that befell its not-so-lucky neighbours of Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the Channel Islands, it was at a heavy cost with thousands of civilian casualties that even saw the destruction of the House of Commons chamber of Parliament. In addition, the UK lost much of its prestige in its overseas colonies, as most of its troops were tied up defending the UK against the Germans, and was unable to defend many of its Asian colonies in the Pacific War against the Japanese. Most notably, the garrisons at Hong Kong and Singapore, which were considered to be impregnable fortresses by the British government and public, ignominiously fell to the Japanese. Even though the Axis powers of Germany and Japan were eventually defeated, with the UK and its allies emerging victorious from the Second World War, it sparked the beginning of the end of the British Empire. The UK no longer had the resources to maintain control over such a large empire and they had lost the respect of the local people in their colonies due to their defeats by the Japanese. This allowed independence movements to gain traction and the UK granted independence to its colonies one by one. The last colony with significant population and economic importance, Hong Kong, was returned to China in 1997, an event which many called the \"end of empire\".\n\nDespite having lost much of its power, the UK has remained a major player in world politics during and after the Cold War, and continues to exert its cultural influences throughout the world through institutions such as the BBC and the Commonwealth. The UK continues to hold a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council with the power of veto. London continues to be one of the most important cities in the world and, together with New York City, Hong Kong and Tokyo, is one of the world's most important financial centres. The London Metropolitan Area is a 'megalopolis' and is one of the largest conurbations in Europe, with a growing population at well over 13.5 million. In addition, the UK also continues to be one of the world's major centres of higher education, being home to some of the world's most prestigious universities such as the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge and attracts more international students than any other country in the world except the United States.\n\nThe country narrowly voted to leave the European Union in a 2016 referendum in a process known as Brexit, and formally left on 31 January 2020. The complexity and effort required for achieving a full divorce from the EU and its single market are significant and the implications are unknown, posing great challenges for the country's economic and political future.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II was the UK's longest-reigning monarch and the longest-reigning female monarch in the world, spanning 70 years from her ascension in February 1952 until her death in September 2022. Her son, Charles III then became king, and his coronation took place in May 2023.\n\nIn October 2022, Rishi Sunak, an ethnic Indian and practising Hindu, assumed office as the United Kingdom's first non-white prime minister.\n\nCrown Dependencies\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Isle of Man and the Channel Islands are not part of the UK, but rather are 'Crown Dependencies': they have their own democratic governments, laws and courts. They are not entirely sovereign either, falling under the British Crown which chooses to have its UK Government manage defence and foreign relations. The people are British citizens.\n\nOverseas Territories and Commonwealth countries\n\n[edit]\n\nThese places are not constitutionally part of the United Kingdom, but are largely former colonies of the British Empire. All Commonwealth countries are independent, though some (e.g. Australia, Canada, New Zealand), known as the Commonwealth Realms, still have the British monarch as their head of state. Overseas territories typically have some degree of self-government, though they are still partially under the control of the British Government (primarily for foreign affairs and defence purposes) and their citizens still possess British citizenship. The British monarch continues to be \"Head of the Commonwealth\", though this position is purely symbolic and does not carry any powers.\n\nWhile the UK may have given independence to many of its former possessions, it remains the last country to have some piece of land on all six inhabited continents (BIOT in Asia, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha in Africa, the Falkland Islands in South America, several territories in the Caribbean and the remote Pitcairn Islands in Oceania).\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Monarchy of the United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with the reigning monarch (Charles III) as head of state but not head of government; the usual platitude is that \"His Majesty reigns but does not rule\". It has the original bicameral parliament: the lower house, known as the House of Commons, traditionally represents the common people. It is popularly elected and is mainly responsible for proposing new laws. The upper house, known as the House of Lords, traditionally represents the nobility and clergy, and primarily scrutinises and amends bills proposed by the lower house. The House of Lords is not elected and more than 80% of its members are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister or the Appointments Commission. The head of government is the Prime Minister, who is usually the leader of the majority party in the House of Commons. In practice, the King's role is largely ceremonial, and the Prime Minister wields the most authority in government, though the King in theory retains the power to veto any bills that have been passed by Parliament (last exercised by Queen Anne in 1708).\n\nBritain has a first-past-the post system divided into local constituencies. Each constituency votes for a local MP (Member of Parliament) who then goes to sit in the House of Commons to debate and vote. The Labour Party and the Conservative Party (\"the Tories\") have been the two dominant parties in British politics since the 1920s; Labour have been the ruling party since July 2024, after fourteen years of a government led by the Conservatives. The first-past-the-post system ensures that small parties only get representation in Westminster if they have a strong local base of support, like Scottish or Welsh nationalists and parties on all sides of the Northern Irish question, whereas non-major parties with nationwide support like the Liberal Democrats, Greens or Reform UK have a hard time getting seats in proportion to their vote share or at all.\n\nThe Cabinet forms the executive branch of government. It is led by the Prime Minister, who appoints ministers from members of the House of Commons, and occasionally from the Lords. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom has topped the judicial branch since 2009. Prior to that, that role was fulfilled by the House of Lords in Parliament.\n\nYou don't have to be British to vote in the UK!\n\nBritish, Irish, and qualifying Commonwealth citizens aged 18 or over can register to vote in UK elections in the electorate where they reside with a \"considerable degree of permanence\". This means that those who, for example, go to the UK to study or spend their gap year can register to vote, but not those who visit the UK on a short holiday.\n\nGet more information and register to vote at the Electoral Commission's website.\n\nNorthern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have their own elected legislatures, the Northern Ireland Assembly, Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly. Each of these devolved governments has a First Minister and varying degrees of power over matters internal to their constituent country, including the passing of laws. For example, the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh exercises power and passes laws over almost every matter internal to Scotland. In the areas over which it has power, the UK government plays no role. As a result, institutions and systems can be radically different between the four constituent countries in the UK. England has no similar body of its own, with all government coming from Westminster.\n\nThere are also local government authorities responsible for services at a local level, which vary widely in size and responsibility across the UK. Some of these local authorities cover just single cities (e.g. Cardiff), or even parts of cities (e.g. London Borough of Islington), whereas some cover whole counties (e.g. Northumberland) or vast regions (e.g. the Scottish Highlands).\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe UK has a benign humid-temperate climate moderated by the North Atlantic current and the country's proximity to the sea. Warm, damp summers and mild winters provide temperatures pleasant enough to engage in outdoor activities all year round. Having said that, the weather in the UK can be changeable and conditions are often windy and wet. British rain is world-renowned, but in practice, it rarely rains more than two or three hours at a time and often parts of the country stay dry for many weeks at a time, especially in the East. More common are overcast or partly cloudy skies. It is a good idea to be prepared for a change of weather when going out; a jumper and a raincoat usually suffice when it is not winter. In summer temperatures can reach 30°C in parts and in winter temperatures may be mild, e.g. 10°C in southern England and 0°C in northern Scotland. Weather extremes are becoming more common and in 2022 the UK recorded a temperature of 40°C for the first time.\n\nBecause the UK stretches nearly a thousand kilometres from end to end, temperatures can vary quite considerably between north and south. Spring and autumn often show the greatest regional disparity of temperature with single figures in the north versus mid-20s in the south. Differences in rainfall are also pronounced between the drier east and wetter west. Scotland and north-western England (particularly the Lake District) are often rainy and cold. Alpine conditions with heavy snowfall are common in the mountains of northern Scotland during the winter. The north-east and Midlands are also cool, though with less rainfall. The south-east and East Anglia are generally warm and dry, and the south-west warm but often wet. Wales and Northern Ireland tend to experience cool to mild temperatures and moderate rainfall, while the hills of Wales occasionally experience heavy snowfall. Even though the highest land in the UK rarely reaches more than 1,000 metres, the effect of height on rainfall and temperature is great.\n\nThe UK lies between 50 and 60 degrees north of the equator so the sun sets in Plymouth at 16:16 and in Inverness at 15:32 on the winter solstice. On the summer solstice it sets in Plymouth at 21:31 and at 22:19 in Inverness.\n\nUnits of measure\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Metric and Imperial equivalents\n\nThe United Kingdom is the country of origin of the imperial system of measures, which shares a common origin with the current United States customary units. The American War of Independence took place some 40 years before Britain standardised its weights and measures, with the result that British pints and gallons are 19% larger than their U.S. equivalents while the imperial fluid ounce is marginally smaller than its US counterpart. In official usage, the UK is in a curious state of partial metrication, with the use of the imperial system in some contexts, and the metric system in others. Temperature is nowadays measured using the metric system, with weather forecasts being given in Celsius (°C). Likewise, fuel is sold per litre at fuel stations. For retail purposes, prices are often quoted using both imperial and metric units (e.g., prices of fruit and vegetables are quoted both per kilogramme and per pound).\n\nHowever, road signs by and large continue to use the old imperial system, although there is increasing use of dual unit signs for height and width restrictions. Speeds are given in mph and distances are given in miles. Milk, beer and cider continue to be sold by the pint. Land size is also usually measured using imperial units, with land areas often quoted in acres, and land price quoted per square foot. People also have a tendency to quote their weight in stone and pounds, and their height in feet and inches. Imperial units are commonly referred to as \"old money\" with metric units referred to as \"new money\", a colloquialism carried over from decimalisation in the 1970s.\n\nTime zone\n\n[edit]\n\nThe United Kingdom uses the Western European Time (WET) time zone, which means it is on universal time (UTC≈GMT) from the last Sunday in October to the last Sunday in March. For the middle seven months of the year, it's on British Summer Time (BST = UTC+1) or \"daylight saving time\". There's a parallel changeover across Europe, so Britain is always one hour behind its nearest neighbours in Europe, except Ireland, Portugal and the Canary Islands, which also use WET.\n\nAirline and ferry timetables usually change with the clocks: their summer period is often shown as \"Apr-Oct\" and winter as \"Nov-Mar\" on these pages, though these don't precisely match. Railway and bus timetables do not change – the train scheduled for 08:30 still leaves at 08:30, but you need to adjust your watch to catch it. Lots of people forget, and miss trains on the last Sunday and Monday of March.\n\nGreenwich Mean Time (GMT) is the base for the \"Universal Time\" (UTC) and thus sets the baseline not just for the world but for the entire cosmos! This is because Greenwich in London housed the telescopes which calibrated the Earth's rotation and defined the zero meridian of longitude, and was the headquarters of the powerful navy that depended on accurate time-keeping for navigation. GMT is thus part of the national identity, and can be politically-charged. Changing the clocks is accompanied by a recurrent debate (as circular as the Earth's motion) about whether UK should continue to change, or what else it might change to.\n\nBank (public) holidays\n\n[edit]\n\nEach country (and sometimes cities, such as Glasgow and Edinburgh) within the UK has a number of slightly differing public holidays, on which the majority of people do not work. Shops, pubs, restaurants and similar are usually open. Many UK residents will take advantage of the time off to travel, both within the UK and abroad. This makes transport links busier than usual and tends to increase prices. If your travel dates are flexible you may wish to avoid travelling to or from the UK on bank holiday weekends. Britain's unpredictable weather is notorious for putting paid to bank holiday plans, even in the middle of summer, though on those choice days when the sun does shine, people seize the moment with gusto, heading en masse to the nearest beach or beauty spot.\n\nThe following eight bank holidays apply in all parts of the UK:\n\nNew Year's Day (1 January)\n\nGood Friday (the Friday immediately before Easter Sunday)\n\nEaster Monday (the Monday immediately after Easter Sunday)\n\nEarly May Bank Holiday (the first Monday in May) – also called \"May Day\" when many towns and villages put on a fête.\n\nSpring Bank Holiday (the last Monday in May)\n\nSummer Bank Holiday (the last Monday in August, except in Scotland where it is the first Monday in August)\n\nChristmas Day (25 December)\n\nBoxing Day (26 December)\n\nNorthern Ireland has the following two additional bank holidays:\n\nSt Patrick's Day (17 March)\n\nBattle of the Boyne/Orangemen's Day (12 July)\n\nScotland officially has two additional bank holidays:\n\nthe day after New Year's Day (2 January)\n\nSt Andrew's Day (30 November)\n\nIn practice, with the exception of Easter, Christmas and New Year holidays, UK bank holidays are virtually ignored in Scotland in favour of local holidays which vary from place to place. In Wales, St David's Day is not a bank holiday, though many people treat it as one and take a day off work anyway.\n\nWhere a bank holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, it is moved to the following Monday. If both Christmas Day and Boxing Day fall on a weekend, the Boxing Day holiday is moved to the following Tuesday. A full list of bank holidays for future years.\n\nTalk\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Two countries divided by a common language\"\n\nSpeakers of American English will find some terms which differ in British English:\n\nbiscuits – cookies\n\ncash machine/cash point – ATM\n\ncinema – movie theatre\n\nchips – fries, which may be \"french fries\" or thick-cut traditional British chips\n\ncrisps – potato chips\n\nfag – cigarette (only used colloquially)\n\nlift – elevator in building; the offer of a ride in car\n\nlorry – truck\n\nmotorway – freeway\n\nnappy – diaper\n\nqueue – line (of people, for example)\n\nreturn ticket – round-trip ticket\n\ntake-away (in ordering food) – to-go\n\ntoilet or loo – washroom/restroom/bathroom (a bathroom is where you have a bath/shower, not where you relieve yourself in British English)\n\ntorch – flashlight\n\nPlease see the article English language varieties for more words that differ across the versions.\n\nEnglish\n\n[edit]\n\nEnglish is spoken throughout the United Kingdom, although there are parts of major cities where immigration has led to a variety of languages being spoken as well. The English spoken in the UK has many accents and dialects, some of which may contain words which are unfamiliar to other English speakers. It is not unknown for residents of different regions in the UK not to understand each other at first; do not be afraid to ask someone to repeat themselves. The different dialects can be extremely different in both pronunciation and vocabulary. In some cases, it is possible to pinpoint a person's origin to a particular town within a county, such as Leeds or Whitby (both in Yorkshire, England). In some cities, accent may also differ by social class. English in Scotland and Northern Ireland can be spoken quite fast.\n\nThe \"standard\" accent of English that you can still hear on some news broadcasts on the BBC is known as Received Pronunciation (RP), and is used by some upper class people across the UK, since pupils in elite public (i.e. private, fee paying) schools like Eton are trained to speak with that accent. Although not identifiable with any specific geographic region, it is most commonly associated with London and the rest of southeastern England. RP is also known as the King's/Queen's English since it is the accent used by The Royal Family.\n\nInter-migration in the United Kingdom means you are likely to encounter people from all over the UK and beyond no matter where you visit. It is rare to find a place where all adults have the same accent or dialect.\n\nThere's an old joke that the people of the UK and the U.S. are \"divided by a common language\", and those from English-speaking countries outside the UK may have difficulty catching specific words where regional accents are strong, but still there should not be any major difficulties in communicating. The British are good at understanding English spoken in a foreign accent, and visitors who speak English as a second language need not fear making mistakes. Most British people will not criticise or correct your language, although some are very keen to promote British usages over American ones when talking to non-native-speakers.\n\nA few examples of regional words that overseas visitors may not be familiar with:\n\nAye – yes (some parts of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and northern England)\n\nCymru (pronounced 'Cum-ree') – Wales (Wales)\n\nDale/glen – valley (northern England and Scotland respectively)\n\nFell – mountain (northern England, especially the Lake District)\n\nLoch – lake (Scotland)\n\nLough – lake (Northern Ireland)\n\nKirk – church (Scotland and north east England)\n\nPoke – ice cream served in a wafer cone (Northern Ireland); a paper bag, especially one containing chips or sweets (Scotland). More widely this use is retained in the common saying 'pig in a poke'.\n\nWee – small (Scotland, Northern Ireland, some northern English people), can also mean to urinate (England)\n\nThe world of politics also has a couple of very commonly-used words you may hear:\n\nDowning Street or Number 10 – used to refer to the Prime Minister and sometimes the government as a whole. \"Buckingham Palace\" is used in a similar way to refer to the Monarchy.\n\nMP – or Member of Parliament, not to be confused with the 'PM' – the Prime Minister\n\nWhitehall – also used to refer to the government as a whole, especially the bureaucracy. Whitehall is a road in central London where many government ministries are located.\n\nWestminster – used to refer to Parliament and the political system in general. \"Stormont\", \"Holyrood\" and \"Cardiff\" respectively refer to the devolved governments in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales\n\nCockney rhyming slang is not a language but a collection of terms, some local and temporary, others so long-lasting that they are used by many people who don't realise that they are rhyming slang. Example of the latter: \"raspberry\" for a derisive noise, derived from \"raspberry tart\", rhyming with \"fart\", and \"butchers\" for look, derived from \"butcher's hook\".\n\nBritish people have historically been very tolerant of swearing, when used in context. It is considered far less shocking to say taboo words like \"cunt\" or \"twat\" than in North America, and can even be a term of endearment depending on the situation. Tourists should get used to hearing \"mate\" and other terms of endearment, such as \"boss\", \"bruv\", \"love\", \"duck\", a lot in informal interactions between strangers and friends alike. The use of affectionate terms between the sexes such as \"darling\", \"love\" or \"sweetheart\" (even, in parts of the West Country, \"lover\") is common between strangers and is not meant in a sexist or patronising manner. Furthermore, British people are prone to apologising for even the smallest things, much to the amusement of some, and it can sometimes be considered rude to not do so. An example such as bumping into you will warrant a \"sorry\" and is really more like \"pardon\" or \"excuse me\".\n\nOther native languages\n\n[edit]\n\nBritish Sign Language, or BSL, is the UK's primary sign language. When interpreters are present for public events, they will use BSL. In Northern Ireland, both BSL and Irish Sign Language (ISL) see use, and a Northern Ireland Sign Language (NISL) is emerging from contact between the two. Users of Auslan or New Zealand Sign Language may understand BSL, as those languages were derived from BSL and share much vocabulary, as well as the same two-handed manual alphabet. Users of French Sign language and related languages, notably ISL and American Sign Language, will not be able to understand BSL.\n\nWelsh (Cymraeg) is widely spoken in Wales, particularly in the north and west. The number of Welsh speakers has risen over the last few years partly due to the language's promotion in schools, but this bilingual population is still only around 30% of the total population of Wales. Road signs in Wales are bilingual. Even the non-Welsh-speaking majority in Wales know how to pronounce Welsh place names. Once you hear how to pronounce a name, have a go; locals will not be offended by genuine attempts.\n\nScottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig) can be heard in the Scottish Highlands and Islands, but there are only 60,000 native speakers.\n\nThe Cornish language (Kernowek) of Cornwall, in the far south west, was revived during the 20th century. It is a hobby language and is not spoken by most residents of the county, and by no one as a day-to-day means of communication. However, Cornish place names can be rather challenging to pronounce for non-locals.\n\nIrish (Gaeilge) is spoken in some areas of Northern Ireland, particularly in the border regions, but is a lot less common than in the Republic.\n\nScots has much in common with English, and can be heard in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland (where it is known as Ulster-Scots) to varying degrees. It can be difficult to understand, so feel free to ask someone to repeat themselves or speak more slowly. Speakers are likely to use English with outsiders.\n\nAll speakers of these minority languages are fluent to near-fluent in standard English but react well if you show an interest in their native tongue and culture. Wikivoyage has phrasebooks for Welsh, Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx Gaelic. Television and radio broadcasts are also available in Welsh, Scottish Gaelic and Irish.\n\nForeign languages\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a general rule people will speak only English, and sometimes another native UK language; although British students often study a European language in school, they tend not to learn past basic levels. Still, most sites popular with tourists provide leaflets and sell guidebooks in a variety of foreign languages, and some attractions provide multilingual information boards and audio tours. French, German and Spanish are the most widely-spoken and understood foreign languages.\n\nThe UK is a popular destination for migrants from all over the world, so many neighbourhoods in larger cities will have migrant communities speaking various languages from around the globe.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nEngland is connected to France by the Channel Tunnel. Northern Ireland shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe UK is not a member of the European Union or the Schengen Agreement, which means that travel to and from EU countries (except Ireland) involves systematic passport checks at the border and separate visa requirements. A Schengen visa does not allow entry to the UK, so if required for your nationality, you will need to obtain a separate UK visa. Entering the UK from a Schengen country will invalidate a single entry Schengen visa.\n\nBritish overseas territories have their own separate visa requirements, which are covered in their respective articles. Visas for the UK are generally not valid for visits to British overseas territories, and you will need to obtain separate visas for them from a British diplomatic mission. Also, do not assume that just because you do not need a visa for the UK, you will not need a visa for the specific British overseas territory you wish to visit.\n\nMost passengers travelling to the UK from outside Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man go through systematic passport and selective customs checks carried out by the United Kingdom Border Force (UKBF) on arrival in the UK. However, juxtaposed controls exist for some cross-Channel services. Passengers travelling by Eurostar from Paris, Lille, Brussels, Rotterdam, and Amsterdam and by ferry from Calais and Dunkirk, undergo UK passport checks before embarkation and selective customs checks on arrival in the UK. Those entering the UK by Eurotunnel from France go through both UK passport and UK customs checks in Coquelles before boarding the train. The juxtaposed controls are reversed for travel in the opposite direction, with French border police carrying out entry controls for the Schengen Area in London, Folkestone, and Dover.\n\nThere are no border controls carried out by the UK when leaving the country.\n\nImmigration and visa requirements\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: The UK is phasing in its Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) scheme. Once complete, this will be a requirement for everybody who does not require a visa (except for British and Irish citizens and some non-visa nationals who reside in Ireland and arrive from Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man directly; those excepted must be able to demonstrate that they are covered). This will even include those in transit through the UK and those under 18. Please read the section on ETA for further information. (Information last updated 10 May 2024)\n\nCitizens of Ireland have right of abode in the UK, and do not require a passport to enter.\n\nCitizens of Anguilla, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, the Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Botswana, Brazil, the British Virgin Islands, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the European Union, the Falkland Islands, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Hong Kong,Iceland, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Liechtenstein, Kiribati, Kuwait, Macau, Malaysia, the Maldives, the Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mexico, Micronesia, Monaco, Montserrat, Nauru, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Oman, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, the Pitcairn Islands, Qatar, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, the Seychelles, Singapore, South Korea, the Solomon Islands, St. Lucia, St. Helena, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tristan da Cunha, Tuvalu, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Uruguay, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, the Vatican City and Venezuela (holders of Venezuelan biometric passports only) require passports for entry, but do not require a visa for visits of up to 6 months. Once in the UK, they are not allowed to work or access public funds (e.g. claiming state benefits). If they wish to stay in the UK for purposes other than a tourist, businessperson or student visitor (i.e. a visitor studying for up to 6 months) or wish to stay for more than 6 months in the UK, they will need to apply for an entry clearance (i.e., a visa) before travelling to the UK.\n\nCitizens of Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar ,Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates require an ETA prior to travel to the UK. This list will increase until all visa-free countries have been added to the scheme.\n\nA visa is required for citizens of most other countries to enter the UK and a number of countries to transit the UK airside. This can be obtained from the British Embassy, High Commission or Consulate where you legally reside. UK visa applicants are required to provide biometric data (10-digit fingerprints and a biometric digital photograph) as part of the application process, unless they are 6 years old or under or travelling directly to the Channel Islands and not passing through the UK or the Isle of Man. As part of the visa application procedure, you must attend a UK visa application centre in person to provide your biometrics.\n\nCommonwealth citizens who are 17 or over and have a British grandparent can apply for an ancestry visa. This allows residency and work in the UK for five years. After five years, permanent residence (indefinite leave to remain) may be applied for; after 12 months of continuous permanent residence and five years of continuous residence in the UK, ancestry visa holders will be able to apply for naturalisation as a British citizen. All Commonwealth citizens living in the UK (regardless of what type of visa they hold and whether they have a British grandparent) are eligible to vote in all elections.\n\nCitizens of Australia, Canada, Hong Kong (British National [Overseas] passport holders only), Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan can apply for a Youth Mobility Scheme visa. The YMS visa allows the holder to undertake a working holiday in the UK for 2 years from the date of issue. Only a limited number of visas are issued for each nationality – in particular, demand far exceeds supply for Japan and Taiwan.\n\nCitizens of Hong Kong with British National (Overseas) passports may apply to move to the UK, but may have to show evidence of sufficient funds to cover their stay for at least the first six months, and are not eligible for welfare benefits for the first five years. After five years, they are eligible to apply for permanent residency, and may apply for full British citizenship after a further 12 months of permanent residency.\n\nThere are generally no immigration checks when entering the UK from Ireland. However, visitors who are not Irish or British citizens are still required to meet admission requirements, and should carry their passport (with appropriate visa stamps if required).\n\nElectronic Travel Authorisation (ETA)\n\nAn ETA is not a visa and does not guarantee entry, it is simply permission to travel.\n\nOnce it is fully operation, an ETA will be required for everyone who does not hold:\n\na visa\n\npermission to live, work or study in the UK\n\na British or Irish passport\n\na British overseas territories passport\n\nresidents of Ireland who can demonstrate this and who are travelling directly from Ireland, the Isle of Man, Guernsey or Jersey.\n\nThe cost of the ETA is £10 and it can be applied for either on the web, or via apps for Apple or for Android.\n\nA decision on a traveller's application can take up to 72 hours, longer if further checks are needed. If an ETA is refused, travellers will need to apply for a visa.\n\nOnce issued, an ETA will be valid for up to 2 years or until the expiry date of the traveller's passport, whichever is sooner, and can be used repeatedly until the expiry date.\n\nTravellers must travel on the same document used for their ETA application.\n\nOther requirements\n\n[edit]\n\nThose subject to immigration control should expect to be asked by Border Force officers upon arrival to demonstrate that they have a) a return ticket to leave the United Kingdom or sufficient funds to meet the cost of an onward plane ticket, b) a valid address at which they will be staying in the United Kingdom, and c) sufficient funds with which to support themselves during their stay. An inability to demonstrate these three basics may lead to a refusal of leave to enter or a grant of restricted permission.\n\nYou can be refused landing permission or a visa/entry clearance on character grounds if you:\n\nHave unspent criminal convictions resulting in a combined sentence of more than 12 months in prison, or\n\nHave questionable associations (e.g., organised crime, terrorist or hate groups) or underlying conduct issues.\n\nIf either situation may apply to you, contact your local British Embassy or High Commission for advice prior to making travel arrangements – you may need to apply for a visa, even if you are from a country that usually wouldn't require one.\n\nAs of 1 October 2021, EU/EEA and Swiss citizens in the vast majority of cases will require a passport to enter the UK. There are some exemptions, see the UK government website for further information. British citizens with Gibraltar ID cards or Irish citizens with passport cards may continue to use these cards for entry into the UK.\n\nePassport gates\n\n[edit]\n\nCitizens of the European Union, Australia, Canada, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland and the United States may use the ePassport gates. These passengers will not have their passports stamped, whether or not they use the ePassport gates or see a Border Force officer, even with a visa inside them. Passengers must still meet the entry requirements for their trip.\n\nYou must see a Border Force officer and get your passport stamped if you’re coming to the UK:\n\nwith a Temporary Worker - Creative and Sporting visa (T5) Certificate of Sponsorship for short-term assignments (up to 3 months)\n\nto carry out Permitted Paid Engagements\n\nRegistered Traveller Service\n\n[edit]\n\nCitizens of Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Brunei, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Taiwan and Uruguay may apply to participate in the Registered Traveller Service after meeting several requirements, which allows you to use the automated ePassport gates when entering the country, meaning that you can get through immigration much faster.\n\nCustoms and goods\n\n[edit]\n\nThe UK has relatively strict laws controlling which goods can and cannot be brought into the country. Selective customs checks are run by UKBF at arrival ports. Border Force officers have powers to not only confiscate goods they suspect are prohibited or regulated, but additionally impound the vehicle carrying them.\n\nThe UK has tight regulations on what food products can be imported, Defra maintains official guidance.\n\nParticularly stringent laws apply to the movement of animals. The British Isles are rabies-free, and the government (and the people) want to keep it that way. Also tapeworms should be kept at bay. Signs in several languages are displayed prominently at even the smallest of boat landings all around the coast. The EU animal passport system makes taking a pet with you easier, providing proof of vaccination against rabies.\n\nCustoms limits returned on 1st January 2021. Customs restrictions now fall into two categories, those passengers arriving into England, Scotland or Wales and those who arrive into Northern Ireland (which remains part of the EU customs union).\n\nCustoms limits for England, Scotland and Wales\n\nAlcohol: beer 42 litres, wine (not sparkling) 18 litres\n\nYou can also bring in either: spirits and other liquors over 22% alcohol 4 litres; or fortified wine (for example port, sherry), sparkling wine and alcoholic drinks up to 22% alcohol 9 litres. This last allowance can be split, for example you could bring 4.5 litres of fortified wine and 2 litres of spirits (both half of your allowance).\n\nTobacco: you can bring in one from the following: 200 cigarettes, 100 cigarillos, 50 cigars, 250 g tobacco, or 200 sticks of tobacco for electronic heated tobacco devices. You can split this allowance: you could bring in 100 cigarettes and 25 cigars (both half of your allowance).\n\nYou can bring in other goods worth up to £390 (or up to £270 if you arrive by private plane or boat).\n\nCustoms limits for Northern Ireland\n\nLimits for Northern Ireland depend on whether or not you started your journey in the EU.\n\nWhich customs channel\n\nPorts of entry use the familiar red/green system. Those in Northern Ireland retain the EU blue channel for routes originating in the EU.\n\nYou must make a declaration if you are carrying more than £10,000 in cash or other negotiable instruments into or out of England, Wales or Scotland, €10,000 in cash into or out of Northern Ireland. Also, if you are carrying more than £1,000 in cash, you may need to show evidence you are legally entitled to that cash if questioned by a customs officer.\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nWhere?\n\n[edit]\n\nThe most important airports are London Heathrow (LHR IATA), London Gatwick (LGW IATA) and Manchester (MAN IATA). All three have multiple terminals and are collectively served by a vast range of airlines and flights from the four corners of the map.\n\nHeathrow is the United Kingdom's main hub, receiving direct flights from every continent and major landmass but Antarctica, including Europe's only direct flights from Oceania. It is also one of the busiest airports in the world, so leave plenty of time to get around it and expect to queue a lot! Gatwick has a somewhat smaller range of destinations than Heathrow, primarily\n\nfocusing on short and medium-haul flights from Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, North America and the Caribbean. Manchester is the largest non-London airport with a choice of international destinations to rival Heathrow. It is especially useful if travelling to the northern half of the UK. All three offer connections with domestic flights to regional destinations.\n\nThe UK's second-tier of international airports comprise Belfast International (BFS IATA), Birmingham (BHX IATA), Bristol (BRS IATA), Edinburgh (EDI IATA) and Glasgow International (GLA IATA) as well as a trio of secondary London airports: City (LCY IATA), Luton (LTN IATA) and Stansted (STN IATA). They are busy airports in their own right, well connected to the rest of Europe, and all offer a range of medium and long-haul flights, though the precise extent of that range may be limited to just a few destinations or to seasonal services.\n\nThere is an even longer list of minor international airports serving cities as diverse as Cardiff, Liverpool and Aberdeen, which you can discover in detail on Wikivoyage's UK region and city articles. These airports generally focus on jetting Brits overseas, so are therefore dominated by low cost airlines flying to tourist resorts across Europe, though many also receive flights from a selection of European cities. Specifically, travellers from France, Spain, Italy and Greece stand a fair chance of finding nearby direct flights to UK regional airports, due to the popularity of these countries among British holidaymakers.\n\nBut how?\n\n[edit]\n\nBritain's largest airlines include flag carrier and member of Oneworld British Airways, major players such as Virgin Atlantic and TUI Airways, and budget giants easyJet, Jet2, Wizzair, and Ryanair.\n\nAlternatively, Dutch carrier KLM has a large number of feeder flights from its international hub in Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS IATA) to almost every UK regional airport, which is especially useful when you can't get a direct flight to the UK. Other useful national carriers transiting through a continental hub include Air France via Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG IATA), Iberia via Madrid Barajas (MAD IATA), and Lufthansa via Frankfurt (FRA IATA).\n\nIf you're visiting Northern Ireland, then Dublin Airport (DUB IATA), being the hub for Aer Lingus, has a much wider range of international flights than Belfast International. Only do this if you can travel visa-free between the Republic of Ireland and the UK or if you have a visa for both countries.\n\nMost UK airports are served by rail services, which if nothing else offer transport into the nearest city. The airports of Manchester and Birmingham are overall the best connected to the National Rail network, in terms of the wide number of destinations you can get to on board a train from either of their stations. Surprisingly, Heathrow's non-local rail connections are poor; if you want to get into central London, you are presented with three handy options to cater to any need. However, if you want to go anywhere else in the UK, you will still have to make your way to one of London's terminus stations to catch another train. Gatwick fares slightly better, with good regional connections including to London, Brighton and Reading. Most other airports are served by a nearby station, often connected by shuttle bus if not at the terminal. A few smaller airports have very few public transport options, so travellers flying into any British airport not mentioned here are advised to check before they travel.\n\nHeathrow is a hub for National Express, meaning you can catch a coach to most parts of the UK direct from the airport. Many other airports are also served by coach companies, and everywhere has car hire options.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom Belgium, France and the Netherlands\n\n[edit]\n\nEurostar operates high-speed trains to London (St Pancras International), Ebbsfleet and Ashford (both in the southeastern county of Kent) through the Channel Tunnel from Amsterdam (Centraal), Avignon (TGV), Brussels (Zuid-Midi), Calais (Fréthun), Lille (Europe), Lyon (Part-Dieu), Marseille (Saint Charles), Paris (Gare du Nord) and Rotterdam (Centraal). Journey times to central London average 2 hours 15 minutes from Paris, 1 hour 50 minutes from Brussels, 3 hr 15 min from Rotterdam, and 4 hr from Amsterdam. A second-class return from Paris to London costs between €85 and €230.\n\nIn normal times, there are also services from Marne-la-Vallée-Chessy (Disneyland Paris) and, in winter, two resorts in the French Alps (Bourg-Saint-Maurice and Moûtiers), though these are mainly of use to holidaymakers travelling from Britain. Through-tickets and connections are available through Lille, Paris and Brussels from many European cities to most large UK cities.\n\nPassengers travelling by Eurostar to the UK from Paris, Lille, Calais, Brussels, Rotterdam and Amsterdam undergo UK passport checks before boarding. As of late 2021, Eurostar advise passengers to arrive at the station between 90 and 120 minutes before departure due to extra (and, hopefully, temporary) border formalities caused by COVID travel restrictions and Brexit. Passengers from all other destinations go through security checks in Lille, which unfortunately involves disembarking from the train and physically passing through customs. The UK passport checks take place after the Schengen exit checks in the stations. However, UK customs checks sometimes also take place on arrival in the UK. In the reverse direction, passengers go through French immigration checks before boarding the train in the UK, and do not usually have to go through the checks again when arriving in France or Belgium.\n\nAn alternative route from the Netherlands is the Dutch Flyer: passengers can travel from any railway station in the Netherlands to any station served by Greater Anglia in England (this network operates in the East of England and east and central London) on a single fare (€142 return). There's no doubt this makes for a much longer journey than going through the tunnel, but for travellers not in a rush, or for those wishing to travel to East Anglia, this service may be a useful and pleasant alternative. The interchange between the ferry terminal and the train station at both ports is very simple and user friendly. Express trains from Harwich International are timed to meet the ferry and allow a simple transfer to London Liverpool Street in under 90 minutes.\n\nFrom Germany\n\n[edit]\n\nDeutsche Bahn does not run trains to London. However, they do offer an almost unbeatable \"London Spezial\" where you can take a Deutsche Bahn train from any point in Germany with any number of changes to Brussels and a Eurostar from there to London for fares starting at €63. Given that early bird fares may sell out rather quickly for popular dates (the NFL international series being an especially popular time for Germans to visit London), you may wish to book 180 days in advance, as this is the earliest possible date to buy tickets online.\n\nFrom the Republic of Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nCross-border rail services to Northern Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom Dublin (Connolly rail station) in Ireland, the Enterprise takes just over 2 hours to Belfast Central. Tickets are available from Irish Rail (in the Republic) and Translink in Northern Ireland. There are no border checks, but non British and Irish citizens should still bring a passport or some form of photo ID, just in case.\n\nServices to the British mainland\n\n[edit]\n\nCombined Rail & Sail tickets are available from any railway station in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland to any railway station in Great Britain. Tickets can be bought from the railway company and ferry operators. Through tickets are available on most sea corridors. Fares are slightly higher during July and August.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Channel Tunnel has provided a rail / road connection between the Continent and Britain since 1994. Shuttle trains operated by Eurotunnel carry vehicles from Calais (France) to Folkestone in Kent in 35 minutes, though you only spend about 20 minutes in the tunnel. Passengers remain with their vehicles for the duration, with trips to the toilet allowed. Fares start at €32 one way and can be booked online months in advance, though it is entirely possible to 'turn up and go' without a reservation, at a cost of course! The terminal on the French side is in Coquelles, 5 km outside Calais, and directly accessible from junction 42b of the A16 (E402) motorway. Follow signs for Tunnel sous la Manche. Passengers undergo UK passport card and customs checks in Calais and French exit checks before departure. On arrival at Folkestone, you can drive straight on to the M20 motorway which heads towards London (70 miles, 113 km) and the rest of the UK's national road network. The UK drives on the left and still uses the imperial system for distance and speed limit measures. In the reverse direction, you will go through French/Schengen passport control in the UK before driving onto the train.\n\nCar ferries also operate to many parts of the UK from other European countries – see the by boat section below.\n\nDrivers entering Northern Ireland from the Republic of Ireland will usually find they have done so without noticing. There are no border controls, and some roads don't display signs stating that you are leaving one country and entering the other. However, the appropriate travel documents for your nationality are still required for cross-border travel despite the lack of border controls. Road signs in the Republic of Ireland (as in the rest of Europe) are in kilometres while those in Northern Ireland are in miles, and the two countries use very different styles of road signs so take note of the differences in signage and road markings when driving in border areas.\n\nBy coach\n\n[edit]\n\nCoaches are the cheapest way to travel to the UK from France and the Benelux. Eurolines offer daily services from Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels to London Victoria coach station. Daily overnight coaches and limited day coaches travel between Ireland and the UK. Connections are available to most parts of the UK via the domestic National Express coach system; for most destinations it is cheaper to purchase this when purchasing your Eurolines tickets as discounts are available. Eurolines will also take you from and to most other major European cities, and the coach is certainly better for the environment than flying, if considerably slower.\n\nVarious other operators compete with Eurolines, mostly between Poland and the UK.\n\nFlixbus and several others serve the London–Paris route (through the Channel Tunnel). Prices tend to be much lower than on Eurostar, to make up for the much longer journey time.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nSee the city articles for more details on routes, timings and costs. Also: Ferry routes to Great Britain.\n\nThere are many ferry routes into the UK from continental Europe. Newcastle serves a route from Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Harwich has ferries from the Hook of Holland in the Netherlands. You can also sail from Rotterdam in the Netherlands to Hull.\n\nDover is the UK's busiest ferry port with sailings from Calais and Dunkirk in France. The Dover-Calais route is particularly busy, with three companies competing and up to 50 sailings per day. The ferry between Calais and Dover costs around €23 each way if on foot or bicycle, and around €50 for a car, although big discounts are available if booked in advance or with special offers. Passengers travelling from Calais or Dunkirk by ferry to the UK go through British immigration control after French exit checks and before boarding; UK customs checks are still after arrival in the UK.\n\nOn the south coast, Portsmouth receives ferries from Le Havre, Caen, Cherbourg and St. Malo in France, as well as Bilbao and Santander in Spain and there are speedy services between Dieppe (France) and Newhaven. The other route from Santander is to Plymouth. Plymouth also receives ferries from Roscoff (France), while Poole has ferries from Cherbourg and the Channel Islands.\n\nFrom the Republic of Ireland, Rosslare ferries sail to Pembroke and Fishguard. There are also sailings from Dublin to Holyhead and Liverpool.\n\nFrom the United States, you can hop aboard the Queen Mary II ocean liner or one of the other ships of the Cunard Line – they depart from New York City every month or so. The crossing to Southampton varies between six and seven days. Prices start at around US$1300.\n\nOther ships operate from various ports around the world – Grimaldi Lines operate a service carrying cars and passengers from Rio de Janeiro, Santos and Paranagua in Brazil about once every 15 days to Felixstowe.\n\nBy bicycle\n\n[edit]\n\nBicycles may be taken on car ferries and on Eurotunnel shuttle trains. They may also be carried on aeroplanes, though you should consult your airline beforehand: bikes often count as \"oversized luggage\" and there is sometimes an extra charge to check them in. You may also be asked to partially dismantle your bicycle, but this policy will vary from carrier to carrier. Eurostar allows folding bikes on all its trains, and offers a more restricted service for other bikes, but has quite strict and specific rules that are worth reading up on before you travel.\n\nFrom Paris\n\n[edit]\n\nThe adventurous (and fit!) may want to try cycling between two great capitals: Paris and London. The Avenue Verte follows high quality bike trails all the way from Notre Dame to the foot of the London Eye, passing through beautiful countryside on both sides of the Channel. Highlights of the 406 km (252 mile) journey include the rich farmland of Normandy, the ferry crossing between Dieppe and Newhaven, and the South Downs' rolling chalk hills. The itinerary is fully signposted all the way, and its accompanying website gives a detailed breakdown of the route, its points of interest and practical information such as places to rest, eat and sleep. Count on at least four days in the saddle, depending how fit you are and how you pace yourself. There is plenty to see and do en route, reserve enough time.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: An industrial dispute between the unions that represent railway workers and the rail industry has led to strikes that amount to a more-or-less total shutdown of the England and Wales's mainline rail network on strike days. These are ongoing. Check news on the situation and consider available contingency plans that don't involve rail. (Information last updated 28 Jan 2024)\n\nMain article: Rail travel in Great Britain\n\nFor Northern Ireland, see Rail travel in Ireland\n\nUkrainian Displaced Persons Travel Scheme provides free rail travel for Ukrainian nationals for their first 48 hours in the UK.\n\nTrain travel is very popular in Britain—you'll find many services busy, and passenger numbers have been rising steadily. It is one of the fastest, most comfortable, convenient and enjoyable ways to explore Britain and by far the best way to travel inter-city. From High Speed 1, which connects London to Kent and mainland Europe, to preserved railways operating historic steam trains through idyllic countryside, to modern inter-city services and the breathtakingly scenic lines of Scotland, Wales and northern England, the train can be an enthralling and affordable way to see much that the UK has to offer.\n\nAll infrastructure is owned by the state while trains are operated by private companies, usually multinational transport companies, which bid for temporary franchises from the government. The system is tightly controlled, both by the national government and the devolved governments in Scotland and Wales. Despite the presence of many franchises, the network provides seamless journeys even if travelling on multiple companies' trains. High-speed rail is provided on five upgraded railway lines running at top speeds of 125 mph (200 km/h) and one purpose-built high-speed line reaching 186 mph (300 km/h). HS1 is used by high-speed \"Javelin\" trains between London and Kent, as well as international Eurostar services to France and Belgium.\n\nPlanning a train trip\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Planning your trip\n\nThe essential source for rail travel information in Great Britain is the National Rail website. It includes an extremely useful journey planner, ticket prices and detailed information about every railway station in the country. You can also access this information using the National Rail Enquiries phone service on 0345 748 49 50.\n\nHowever, National Rail do not sell tickets. You buy tickets from a ticket office or automated ticket machine at a station, or from the train company's website. All train companies sell tickets for all services in Great Britain regardless of which company operates them, and the central ticketing means you can buy a through-ticket from one station to any other in Great Britain irrespective of which train companies you’ll need to travel on or how many changes.\n\nTwo classes of travel are offered: standard class and first class. Some commuter trains and local services offer standard class only. There are also some scheduled overnight sleeper train services from London to Scotland and to Cornwall (see more here).\n\nTickets\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Buying tickets\n\nGenerally, the ticket prices for a particular type of ticket are the same regardless of operator you choose to travel on. However the cheaper or promo tickets will be restricted to one operator only. Tickets normally go on sale three months in advance. On most routes, you save money by booking in advance and by travelling at off-peak times (after 9:30AM on weekdays, and all day weekends and on public holidays). You must have a ticket before boarding a train, and many stations now have ticket barriers. The exceptions are when there is no ticket machine or ticket office at a station, in which case you buy your ticket from the guard on-board or online.\n\nA ticket does not guarantee a seat unless you also have a seat reservation. Seat reservations are free. Local and commuter services do not have reserved seats. If you have no seat reservation, you may have to stand if the train is busy. There are discounts and rail cards available for various kinds of travellers, among them young people (16–30 year olds), children (up to 15 years old), senior citizens (over 60 years old), and groups.\n\nRail passes\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are three principal types of rail pass available to visitors to the UK which permit inclusive rail travel throughout the UK.\n\nBritrail[dead link] passes can be purchased for travel in England, Scotland and Wales by any non-UK resident online or in their home nation before departing for the UK.\n\nInterRail passes are available for EU citizens.\n\nEurail passes can be purchased by non-EU citizens for travel in Northern Ireland and most countries in Europe, but not Great Britain.\n\nSee European rail passes for more information.\n\nRanger and Rover tickets\n\n[edit]\n\nRanger and Rover tickets permit unlimited travel with relatively few restrictions over a defined geographical area for a period of one to fourteen days, for example, the All Line Rover allows 7 or 14 days' travel on almost all scheduled rail services throughout England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Driving in the UK\n\nUnlike most of Europe, the UK drives on the left. Most cars in the UK are manual transmission, and car rental companies will allocate you a manual transmission car unless you specifically ask for an automatic when you make a reservation. Renting an automatic version of the same car will cost more, and the number of automatic cars available might be quite limited. The government offers advice on driving with a non-UK licence. Most hire companies will check your driver's licence before you are able to hire a car.\n\nA car will get you pretty much anywhere in the UK. Parking is a problem in large cities, especially in London, and can be very expensive. Visiting smaller towns can often be done via the rail network, although driving may be a good option for more remote destinations. Fuel is heavily taxed and therefore expensive, and there are some fuel options available:\n\nAs of October 2023, standard unleaded petrol costs between £1.50 and £1.60 per litre depending on where you are, with even higher prices to be found at motorway services and especially around airports - if you can avoid filling up at these places, do so.\n\nVirtually all standard unleaded petrol in the UK is 95RON E10 as of 2023. \"Premium\" unleaded is typically 98RON E5, but this can vary according to brand - expect to pay an approximately 10p/litre premium for it.\n\nDiesel engine cars are also reasonably widespread due to their favourable tax treatments in the early-mid 2000s, albeit falling out of favour. Diesel is typically about 30p per litre more expensive than petrol, but with potential increases in fuel economy on longer journeys.\n\nElectric car charging infrastructure exists and is growing, but can be sporadic and unintuitively located, especially away from major cities. As such, hybrids are a commonly-found sight on the roads for those interested in fuel economy or lessened environmental impact, and car rental places are likely to have some)\n\nRoad distances are indicated in miles (1 mile is about 1.6 km) and speed limits are indicated in miles per hour (70 mph is about 115 km/h). However, many weight, height and width signs are now in metric as well.\n\nThere are no tolls with the exception of a few large bridges and tunnels and one privately financed motorway in the Midlands. There is a congestion charge of £11.50 per day to drive in central London, as well as a significant charge for entering the significantly wider London Ultra Low Emissions Zone with a car that does not meet the required strict emissions standards - this includes a great deal of older cars, especially diesels. If your journey is expected to take you into Greater London, do your research on an appropriate car to rent and the relevant charges that might apply here.\n\nTraffic can be very heavy, especially during 'rush hour', when commuters are on their way to and from work - typically 07:00-10:00 and 16:00-19:00. Checking local traffic reports on the radio or websites such as Frixo can help if you know you need to travel during busy hours.\n\nMany cities operate a \"Park and Ride\" scheme, with car parks on the edge of the city and cheap buses or sometimes trams into the city centre. In London it is best to leave your car at home altogether as parking in rail and Tube stations, even in the outer suburbs can be very expensive and if you don't arrive early enough you won't find a space. An alternative is to book parking in advance via online platforms such as YourParkingSpace.co.uk or Parkonmydrive.com. For more information on parking, see Parking in the UK\n\nDriving standards are relatively well-maintained in the UK, with the road system being statistically among the safest in Europe. British authorities have access to vehicle registration databases from various other countries, so you shouldn't try to ignore the rules just because you're driving a foreign vehicle. Also, British hire car companies will charge traffic fines to your credit card, long after you have left the country. Traffic police patrol the motorways in marked and unmarked cars, and automatic speed cameras are in place on most if not all major trunk roads. Any police officer, regardless of their normal duties, will pursue a vehicle seen driving dangerously.\n\nDon't drink and drive in the UK. Although the maximum limit is 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood (0.08%), Police in the UK will routinely stop any drivers they feel may be under the influence of alcohol especially if their driving is erratic or dangerous regardless. Scotland has a lower limit of 50 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.\n\nAll drivers and passengers are expected to wear seat belts, and it is illegal for drivers to hold (or even pick up) a phone or other handheld device while at the wheel of a car - this includes if you are stopped in traffic or basically at any time where you are behind the wheel and not parked up, with the sole exceptions being where you need to use your phone to pay for something at a drive-thru or in a genuine emergency. Aside from using a phone at the wheel being grossly unsafe, this is a criminal offence, and treated extremely seriously by police; do not risk it.\n\nFor further information on driving in the UK, consult the Highway Code.\n\nBy campervan\n\n[edit]\n\nHiring a campervan is one way to explore the UK. Some companies offer airport pickups and dropoffs. It can work out cheaper than travelling between hostels and bed and breakfasts by car or train. Smaller campers are ideal for parking and enjoying the narrow lanes in the UK.\n\nThe Caravan Club has a huge number of caravan and campervan parks all over the country. Most municipal car parks don't allow overnight camping, though some country pubs may let you use their parking lots for overnight stays if you ask.\n\nBy motorcycle\n\n[edit]\n\nMotorcycling can be good for navigating areas with bad traffic, e.g., in Central London, where motorcyclists do not have to pay the congestion charge that cars have to pay. However, it is important to prioritise your safety - although bikers make up a minority of road users, they make up the vast majority of deaths and serious injuries on British roads.\n\nThe rider and pillion passenger on a motorbike are required by law to wear a securely-fastened motorbike helmet that is CE marked. The only people exempt from this law are Sikh men, whose religion requires them to wear a turban. If you wear eye protection, the visor or goggles must be kitemarked. It is illegal to carry more than one pillion passenger. If you wish to carry multiple passengers, use a sidecar. The pillion passenger is required by law to sit astride the motorbike on a proper seat.\n\nIt is important to make sure you can be seen both at night and at day, and from the sides as well as the front and rear. Wear a high-visibility jacket or fluorescent strips (during the day) and reflective strips (at night). A good idea is to wear a white or brightly coloured helmet. You can also dip your headlights, even in good daylight, to make you easier to see, but only light them fully at night.\n\nBy bus and coach\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Bus travel in the United Kingdom\n\nIn the UK, coaches are long-distance bus services usually operating intercity or city to airport routes. Local services within and around villages, towns and cities are referred to as buses.\n\nCoach\n\n[edit]\n\nLong distance coach travel tends to be slower than train travel, as well as less frequent, although it is comfortable and often much cheaper. Coaches, like trains, will also generally take you right to the centre of town.\n\nThe largest coach companies in the UK are:\n\nNational Express is the largest long distance coach operator in the UK, and services all major destinations on the mainland; they sell tickets online and at coach terminals. Prices start at just £1 one way for promotional 'funfares' between major city-pairs, although remain quite expensive on less competitive routes such as those serving airports.\n\nMegabus is a service between a limited number of major destinations at cut-throat prices, as low as £1 (plus a £1 booking charge) for some routes if booked well in advance. Understandably, it is very popular with students. To get the cheapest fares you should book a week or two ahead. However, fares are often still good value when booked with less time, e.g. you may pick up London-Manchester for £8 booked only two days in advance. Tickets must be bought online or using the premium rate booking line 0900 160 0900 for at least 60p per minute and cannot be bought from the driver.\n\nCityLink services destinations in Scotland. They sell their tickets online, by text, or from the driver, although it is always advised to book your tickets in advance. Some routes also carry Megabus passengers.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal bus services (a categorisation which also includes many medium-haul inter-urban services) cover the entire country, but are of variable quality and cost. Services range from deep-rural village services operating once a week or less, to intensive urban routes operating every few minutes. All communities except the very smallest villages have some kind of bus service. Almost all are \"one person operation\", i.e. there is no conductor and you must pay the driver as you board. The vast majority of bus stops are \"request stops\", meaning that you must put your arm out as the bus approaches to signal that you want it to stop. Likewise once on the bus, you must ring the bell in advance of the stop you want to get off at. The majority of bus services, especially in urban areas, are fully accessible for disabled passengers, with either low floors or the use of a ramp facilitating access for wheelchair users. On-board there is space for pushchairs and wheelchairs.\n\nBus services in the UK outside of London and Manchester are privatised and deregulated, with any licensed operator free to run any route and timetable that they wish. Therefore, co-ordination of services with each other and with rail services can be poor, and tickets bought from one operator are often not valid on other services. Return tickets are usually much cheaper than two singles, and most operators offer discounted fares for children. Most operators offer period tickets for a day or longer, valid across their own network, which can represent very good value, giving all-day travel for as little as £4, but are of little use if you need to use more than one operator. However, combined day tickets valid across more than one operator's network are also available in some areas. In large towns and cities, weekday daytime services are as frequent and comprehensive as in London. However, almost universally, service levels reduce sharply in the evenings and on Sundays. In the larger cities, for example Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh, an extensive night bus network is available.\n\nIn areas with a multitude of operators, obtaining comprehensive maps and timetable information for the area can be difficult. It is not uncommon for operators to attempt to pass off their services as being 'the' network for the town or area in their publicity material – making no mention of the fact that other routes (or in some cases alternative departure times on the same routes) are available, operated by competitors. Many local authorities do attempt to produce comprehensive timetables and maps for all services in their area regardless of who operates them – these are well worth obtaining and are commonly available from tourist information centres. However it is still worth checking with the operator(s) before travelling to ensure that the information is up to date, as timetables can change frequently.\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nGiven the short distances involved, flying is rarely the cheapest or most convenient option for domestic travel within the UK with the possible exception of between southern England and Scotland, or where a sea crossing would otherwise be involved, such as between Britain and Northern Ireland or travel to and from many Scottish islands.\n\nThe main domestic hubs are London, Belfast, Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and Edinburgh, while major airlines include British Airways and Eastern Airways. The arrival of budget airlines Ryanair and easyJet has forced fares down considerably. Some peripheral destinations have their own local airline.\n\nTo get the best fare, it is advisable to book as far in advance as possible. 'Screen-scraper' comparison websites can be a useful way to compare flight costs between airports or even city pairs (suggesting alternative airports, for instance). Some airlines, such as Ryanair, object to being included in these searches, so these sites are not always comprehensive. Ryanair and Easyjet are also notorious for additional fees for anything but one person without checked bags doing online check in, so comparisons to legacy carriers might be complicated if you have luggage or other things legacy carriers typically include in their fares.\n\nMany regional airports are not connected to the national rail network, with connections to the nearest cities served by relatively expensive buses. Photo ID is required before boarding domestic flights.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nFerries link the mainland to the many offshore islands including the Isles of Scilly from Penzance, the Isle of Wight from Southampton and Portsmouth, the Isle of Man from Liverpool and Ireland, the Hebrides from various ports in the Scottish Highlands, the Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands from Aberdeen and Scrabster. There are also regular ferry services between Northern Ireland and Scotland and these depart Larne, Belfast, Troon and Cairnryan. There are also routes from Northern Ireland to Birkenhead and Fleetwood (both near Liverpool in England).\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are two types of ordinary taxis in the United Kingdom: metered black cabs that can be hailed in the street and are mostly found in larger towns and cities; and minicabs, or private hire taxis, which must be ordered by telephone.\n\nIf paying with cash, it's often typical to round to a convenient denomination (the difference being a gratuity), this practice is not however universal and some drivers will insist on giving change regardless. Card payment options vary, and its best to check either with the driver (black cabs) or operator when booking (minicabs).\n\nBlack cabs\n\n[edit]\n\nAlso known as Hackney carriages, these are useful for travelling within cities. The name originates from horse-drawn vehicles from at least as long ago as 1622. Custom-built vehicles which seat five people are commonly used as metered taxis, though regular cars or people-carriers can be used instead. These taxis can be hailed on the street or picked up from a taxi rank, which are usually found near major shopping areas and transport hubs. The 'Taxi' sign on the roof is illuminated when a taxi is available for hire.\n\nThe rate varies and is set by local government, typically starting at around £3-5 and rising at around £1 a mile, making them fairly expensive, especially so in London. Add night charges, waiting charges, luggage charges for large suitcases, etc., on to the meter as well, and travelling by taxi can be expensive unless you are in a large group.\n\nMinicabs\n\n[edit]\n\nMore common in suburbs and smaller towns, minicabs can only be ordered by telephone or online and charge fixed prices to different destinations. With the growing success of Uber, some minicab and black cab companies are releasing apps for smartphones, to make ordering easier. Local telephone directories usually advertise taxi companies, and the phone numbers are usually painted in big numbers on the side of their vehicles. You can also occasionally find numbers for local minicab firms on ad boards at supermarkets.\n\nMinicabs are usually much cheaper than black cabs; fares for long journeys can often be negotiated, although you should agree the fare with the phone operator when booking, not with the driver. Most companies have a variety of vehicle sizes from small saloons up to large 12-seater minivans so you can specify the vehicle size. Some minicab firms specialise in serving airports and offer discounted rates for this.\n\nRide hailing\n\n[edit]\n\nMost commonly used are Uber, Bolt and FreeNow\n\nFake taxis\n\n[edit]\n\nFake taxis are not a major problem and are mostly found around the main airports, some railway stations, and city centres night-spots late at night.\n\nA few tips:\n\nCheck that the taxi has a rear taxi-licence plate on the rear bumper and that it carries the name of the local authority or licensing authority (for example in London this is the Public Carriage Office).\n\nThe driver's taxi licence should be displayed on the dashboard.\n\nIf calling a minicab, the taxi company will ask your last name and your phone number - the driver should know this when he picks you up. If approached by a taxi driver claiming that you booked their taxi, ask them to confirm your name and phone number.\n\nMost local councils require licensed taxis to be newer than 10 or 15 years old. Many fake taxis use older vehicles.\n\nBy bicycle\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Cycling in England and Wales, Cycling in Scotland\n\nThe UK can be both a cyclist's dream and nightmare. Cycling is popular as both a sport and a means of transportation, though bikes don't always get adequate provision on roadways and the relationship between cyclists and motorists can be strained. The National Cycle Network is a web of paved and unpaved cycle tracks covering the whole country, passing through some spectacular scenery on the way. Their website has a comprehensive cycle map and most cycle stores, tourist information centres and youth hostels also sell their maps. Routes are indicated by blue finger posts with the route number in red.\n\nBy thumb\n\n[edit]\n\nPedestrians are banned on motorways, motorway junctions, and certain primary routes. Aside from those exceptions, hitchhiking is not illegal. Service stations are fair game. It's not a common practice, and the largely urbanised southeast is probably the most difficult region to travel by thumb. The southwest and north are easier.\n\nIf you use signs, it's fairly customary to use the number of the road on them rather than the destination. In other words, from Birmingham to London you wouldn't use a sign \"LONDON\" but rather \"M25\". Two places where signs are quite useful are Land's End and John O'Groats, the two extremes of the country, especially if your sign says the other.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom Land's End in the south to John O’Groats in the north, there is so much to see in the United Kingdom. There are hundreds of free museums to enjoy across the country, thousands of municipal parks to stroll through, tens of thousands of interesting communities to visit and many millions of acres of countryside to ramble across. And the country is home to 25 UNESCO World Heritage sites. There is certainly far more to do than just talking about the rain and seeing whether the King is home at Buckingham Palace.\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\nLondon – As Samuel Johnson once wrote, \"when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life.\" This is truer than ever before as London is home to an enormous range of attractions to suit all tastes. Enjoy art at the National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, the Tate Britain and Tate Modern among others. There are cultural treats in the theatres and cinemas of the West End and the South Bank, and at Shakespeare's re-created theatre, the Globe. And then of course there are all the traditional tourist sites to see such as Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, St Paul’s Cathedral, Trafalgar Square and the London Eye.\n\nEdinburgh - Scotland's capital was initially centred on the Old Town, the castle and Holyrood Palace, but the New Town is a Georgian masterpiece. Both the Old Town and the New Town are UNESCO World Heritage sites.\n\nOxford and Cambridge – The two ancient university cities allow you to wander among the dreaming spires, to punt on the river and at certain times to walk through the college quadrangles.\n\nCheck out the Cities section of this article for a fuller list, or have a read of the relevant pages for each country and region that interests you.\n\nParks and nature\n\n[edit]\n\nThe United Kingdom has an array of National Parks and designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty that serve to preserve the country's natural heritage. There are 15 National Parks in total spread across England, Scotland and Wales (10 in England, 2 in Scotland and 3 in Wales) and 49 Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (35 in England, 4 in Wales, 9 in Northern Ireland and 1 on the Anglo-Welsh border). There are no Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Scotland, but there are 35 of the Scottish equivalent (National Scenic Areas) spread across the country\n\nThe British countryside is unique and diverse. In southern England there are the rolling countryside and picturesque villages of the Cotswolds, the chalk hills of the Downs and the prehistoric cliffs of the Jurassic Coast. In the east, you'll find the lowland tranquillity of the Fens. The north of England has magnificent scenery and outdoor activities in the Lake District, Peak District and Yorkshire Dales. Wales offers the ruggedness of Snowdonia National Park and the beautiful beaches of the Gower. Scotland has the vast wilderness of the Highlands and the beauty of the islands. Northern Ireland is blessed with the Giant's Causeway as well as the north Antrim coast.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nPrehistory– before the human race\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earliest scientific discoveries of prehistoric creatures (dinosaurs, marine reptiles and pterosaurs) were made in the 19th century in Dorset and Devon, on England's south coast. Today, visitors can go on a fossil safari along the beaches and cliffs of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and see some of the original finds at the Natural History Museum in London.\n\nStone Age, Roman age and the Dark Ages – before 1066\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Roman Empire, Prehistoric Wessex Trail\n\nThe inhabitants of the United Kingdom have long had the tendency to try to leave their mark on the landscape. For the length of recorded history they have been leaving traces of their lives for the tourists of the future to enjoy. This started with our prehistoric ancestors who erected mysterious stone circles and mounds at such places as Stonehenge and Avebury.\n\nThen came the Romans, who as well as building the first roads, married the natives and left behind great reminders such as villas (e.g. Fishbourne), bath houses most notably at Bath, Hadrian's Wall in the north of England, and Roman city walls and buildings all over the country, including in London, Lincoln, York and Cirencester (The capitals of the four British provinces in the late Roman period).\n\nAfter the Romans left, the British Isles fell along with the rest of Western Europe into the Dark Ages. Even during this period when much of the learning, civilisation and culture of the Roman period was lost, the people of the British Isles continued to make their mark on the landscape of the country, with elaborate burial mounds such as the ones at Sutton Hoo, and stashes of treasure such as the Staffordshire Hoard, the finds from which can now be seen at the British Museum and the Birmingham Museum respectively. As time progressed waves of migrants and invaders coming from territories in present day Germany, Denmark and Norway brought with them new languages and customs. It was during this period that the English, Scottish and Welsh identities started to form.\n\nNorman and Medieval periods 1066 to 1603\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Medieval Britain and Ireland\n\n1066 saw a major change in the history of the country as the Kingdom of England was conquered by the Normans of northern France. The Normans imposed the system of Feudalism on England, and the bulk of the population were made to work the land in service of their Norman lords. In order to consolidate this system during the 11th and 12th centuries, the Normans went on a building spree, raising castles to intimidate and dominate and churches to inspire and unite. The most notable castles include the Tower of London and those in Windsor, Durham and Warwick. This period also saw the construction of wonderful Gothic cathedrals, the finest of which can be found at Canterbury, Durham, Norwich, Lincoln, Salisbury and York, each of which also have ancient city centres, littered with Medieval buildings and streets. The Christian faith also expanded to the remotest parts of the country, with Holy Island (Northumberland) and St Michael's Mount (Cornwall) hosting monastic communities cut off from the mainland by the tide. As the Normans extended their power into Wales in the 13th century, there was more castle building in Cardiff, Conwy, Caernarfon and Harlech. In Scotland too, which remained a kingdom independent of England throughout the Middle Ages, great castles were built at Edinburgh and Stirling. And in both England and Scotland great seats of learning were set up with universities at Oxford, Cambridge, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and St Andrews.\n\nAs political stability grew and peasants' revolts, black death and an emerging middle class reduced the power of the old Feudal system, castles dwindled in importance. The monarchs of the Tudor dynasty wished to live in comfort in great palaces rather than cold castles and this was the period in which Hampton Court was built. Towns such as Stratford-upon-Avon and Chester contain many examples of middle class town houses, built in typical Tudor timber-frame \"black and white\" style. Henry VIII's reign also saw the Reformation in which England severed its ties with the Roman Catholic Church and a new state religion, the Church of England, was established. This period witnessed the destruction of many monasteries and abbeys around the country, although many ruins can still be visited for example at Tintern in Monmouthshire and Rievaulx near Helmsley in North Yorkshire.\n\n1603 – 1900\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: British Empire, Industrial Britain\n\nThe United Kingdom is littered with historical sites from the Stuart, Georgian, Regency and Victorian eras. There are fine examples of English country houses at Blenheim, Chatsworth and the Royal Pavilion in Brighton which shows royal Regency splendour by the sea. Cities with classic Georgian architecture include Edinburgh and Bath, as well as much of west central London. The neo-classical movements brought about the appearance of many new churches, most notably the rebuilt St Paul's Cathedral in London. The union with Scotland also saw a renewed interest in castle living, and many members of the aristocracy and newly-moneyed middle class built luxurious homes in imitation of medieval fortresses so they could be lairds of their very own (often forcibly depopulated) highland estates. While there are many such edifices around Scotland, and indeed in other parts of the UK, the most famous example is at Balmoral, which has been the British monarch's summer retreat since 1852.\n\nThe establishment and growth of the British Empire saw the expansion and professionalisation of the country's armed forces, both on the land and at sea, and a massive increase in trade around the world. London's National Army Museum charts the long history of the British Army, while many garrison towns such as Aldershot have their own military heritage attractions. Chatham and Portsmouth each have historic dockyards containing some of the Royal Navy's finest ships from days gone by, and Bristol is home to Brunel's gigantic and revolutionary commercial steamship SS Great Britain. The age of Empire also saw the modernisation of the Houses of Parliament into the current iconic building known today, including the construction of the famous clock tower, and the export of similar parliamentary systems of government around the world. Various financial institutions of the City of London, such as the Bank of England and the London Stock Exchange are among the oldest such institutions in the world.\n\nThe industrial revolution, which started in the English West Midlands and spread steadily throughout the United Kingdom and then around the world, brought about a huge increase in the British population, a one-way migration into the rapidly-growing cities and the development of heavy industry. Some key sites from this period include the Ironbridge, site of the world’s first all iron b"
