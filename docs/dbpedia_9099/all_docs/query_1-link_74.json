On the contrary hand, Greater London is a 606 square mile area of England that is home to around 8.7 million people.\n\n2. Big Ben isn't really called Big Ben.\n\nSorry to burst your bubble, but that iconic London tower you’ve been calling Big Ben isn’t really called Big Ben. Actually, the clock in the Tower is the one that is called “Big Ben.” In honor of the Queen's diamond jubilee, the famed Tower's name was changed from Clock Tower to Elizabeth Tower in 2012.\n\n3. There are over 170 museums in London, including 11 national ones.\n\nLondon is home to more than 170 museums and most of them are free.

London is considered a forest.\n\nUnsplash: Bruno Martins\n\nThere are almost as many trees in London as there are people. According to a UN definition, any area that has at least 20% trees is considered a forest. And trees cover around 21% of the land in London, making the city an urban forest. In fact, 8.6 million people are known to live alongside 8.3 million trees.\n\n5. There are six ravens in the Tower of London.\n\nThere are six resident guardian ravens of the Tower of London: Harris, Jubilee, Poppy, Gripp, Erin, Branwen, and Edgar. They are intelligent birds that only respond to the Ravenmaster, and people should avoid getting too close to them because they can bite if they feel that their area is being threatened.\n\n6. The city has a Peter Pan Hospital.\n\nIn 1929, the Peter Pan novelist JM Barrie was asked to join a group that was looking to buy a piece of land to build a new wing for the Great Ormond Street Hospital or GOSH. Instead of joining the committee, Barrie generously donated the Peter Pan copyrights to GOSH. Since then, royalties from all Peter Pan performances and retail sales have helped GOSH, helping to pay for the ongoing care of seriously-ill children every day.\n\n*Read Peter Pan in English, French, Spanish, Korean, German and more with Beelinguapp!\n\n7.

The leaders of Norway, Poland, Belgium, France, and The Netherlands stayed in London between 1939 and 1945.\n\n9. Feeding the pigeons in Trafalgar Square is illegal.\n\nUnsplash: Robert Linder\n\nAlthough pigeons (or, as the locals refer to them, \"flying rats\") are an important feature of Trafalgar Square, it is illegal to feed them, and seed sellers have been banned from the area since 2003. However, protesters still feed these hungry birdies on its northern terrace. Tuppence a bag, you say… better think carefully.\n\n10. The world's oldest underground rail network is in London.\n\nThe first public transportation system to use steam engines was the London Tube. On January 10, 1863, the Metropolitan line's first segment from Paddington to Farringdon opened. Five years later, a second underground line went into operation. Metropolitan number 23 is the oldest surviving steam locomotive and it is on display at the London Transport Museum.\n\n11. The quintessential double-decker buses weren’t always red.\n\nThe double-decker buses that run across London aren't always red. At one point, they were all painted a different color to represent the different routes they travel. But in 1907, the London General Omnibus Company decided to paint its buses with a striking shade of red to distinguish itself from the competitors. Ever since then, the iconic red double-decker buses have been roaming and rouge-ing the streets of London.\n\n12. Some parts of London have been inhabited as early as 4000 BC.\n\nArchaeologists found flint tools close to Happisburgh that were used by hominoids, sometimes known as early humans, during the warmer interglacial periods around 900,000 years ago.\n\nIt is believed that Ice Age humans made the earliest known cave art in England at Creswell Crags about 13,000 years ago.\n\nResearchers also discovered the oldest human remains, which date to roughly 500,000 years ago. The remains belonged to a Homo heidelbergensis guy who stood six feet tall.\n\n13. There are some streets in London with derogatory names.\n\nMore than 20 streets in London have names that are extremely sexual, provocative, and at the same time humorous. These streets have very suggestive and explicit names that express what they were renowned for. A few streets include Helmet Row, The Butts and Upper Butts, Newington Butts, White Knobs Way, Copping Close, Fanny Hands Lane, Bird in Bush Road, Clitheroe Road, Kings Butts, Melon Road, Ogle Street, Cumming Street, Swallow Street, Hooker's Road, Cock Pond, and Cock Lane.\n\n14. Flying a kite is illegal.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Act of 1839 states that it is illegal to fly a kite in parks, other public areas, or in a way that annoys other people. And if you ever fly a kite in violation of the law, you risk receiving a fine of up to £500.\n\nThere are basic rules and tips for flying a kite that you must follow:\n\nDon’t fly your kite in wet or stormy weather.\n\nDon’t fly your kite close to roads or paths that may distract vehicles.\n\nDon’t fly your kite above 60 meters or 200 feet near airports or any flight path.\n\nDon’t fly your kite near power lines.\n\nAlways clean up after flying kites and wear gloves while using strong pulling kites.\n\n15.

The Palace is situated on the north bank of the River Thames for a specific purpose: to avoid ever being surrounded by a mob.\n\n16. Cleopatra’s Needle is a time capsule.\n\nMuhammad Ali, the king of Egypt and Sudan, presented Cleopatra's Needle to the United Kingdom in 1819 as a tribute to Lord Nelson's victory at the Battle of the Nile and Sir Ralph Abercromby's victory at the Battle of Alexandria in 1801. However, the ancient Egyptian obelisk stayed in Alexandria until Sir William James Erasmus Wilson offered £10,000 to have it transported to London in 1877.
