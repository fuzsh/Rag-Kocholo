        "text": "People would ask where you're from. You may answer “North Wales,” but others would say “London, England” or even “Belfast, Northern Ireland.” That seems to bring on immediate confusion and many questions—ranging from “So which one is in Britain?” to “Which countries are in the UK?”\n\nWhat is the difference between the British Isles, Great Britain, and the UK? Honestly, even people here seem to get the UK confused with Britain – the terms are often used interchangeably. So, let’s clear it up once and for all with this helpful article.\n\nThe United Kingdom\n\nThe ‘United Kingdom’ refers to a political union between England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Although the UK is a fully independent sovereign state, the four nations that make it up are also countries in their own right and have a certain extent of autonomy.\n\nAlthough all four countries are bound to the Crown and united, each has its own identity and is often considered separate in the minds of locals. There are even regional languages like Welsh and Gaelic, though English is spoken throughout.\n\nFrom 1801 to 1922, the United Kingdom included the whole of Ireland, but now only includes Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland operates as a sovereign state, although it’s physically close to the UK. The Isle of Man and the Channel Island (Jersey and Guernsey) are what we call ‘Crown Dependencies’ but are not part of the UK.\n\nGreat Britain\n\n‘Great Britain’ is the collective name for the islands that make up England, Scotland, Wales, and their islands. It comes from the political union of the three kingdoms, which was made in 1707. Northern Ireland isn’t part of Great Britain.\n\nWondering where the name comes from? We’re not just bigheaded! It’s said that ‘Great’ was stuck on the front of ‘Britain’ (the Roman word Britannia) to distinguish Britain from its similar-sounding neighbour, Brittany, in Northern France.\n\nThe British Isles\n\nThis is purely a geographical term that refers to the entire island of Great Britain and Ireland. It also includes the Republic of Ireland, along with the 5,000 small islands scattered around our coastlines.\n\nAlthough the Republic of Ireland is technically part of the British Isles, the people who live there are not British – in fact, they’d probably be a little peeved if you called them so!\n\nThe countries of the UK\n\nOne of the United Kingdom’s greatest strengths is its diversity – we’re bursting with regional pride. You could come on holiday here for just 2 or 3 weeks and manage to soak up 4 different cultures, hear 3 different languages and heaps of striking regional accents without travelling far.\n\nEngland\n\nEngland is the largest and southernmost country of the UK, home to around 84% of the UK’s population. Here, you’ll find some of the UK’s most bustling cities. London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds are all within a few hours' drive of each other, each bursting with their own unique culture and history.\n\nThere are heaps of beautiful countryside, including the famous Lake District and Peak District, as well as ancient historic sites at every turn. The most notable is Stonehenge, which should be on your bucket list.\n\nWales\n\nWe’d call Wales the unsung gem of the UK - it may be small, but it’s got lots on offer. Wales is most famed for its amazing landscapes and mountainous areas, such as Snowdonia National Park and the scenic, rugged coast and 870-mile path covering every inch of its coastline.\n\nOf course, let’s not forget that Wales has its own language—Welsh—which is still widely spoken today. The regional food is incredible, too. Don’t forget to try some cheesy Welsh Rarebit and comforting Cawl. It’s hard to summarise Wales in a short paragraph, so check out our blog for more info.\n\nScotland\n\nScotland has everything - diverse landscapes, remote islands and thriving cosmopolitan cities. It covers around a third of the total UK landmass, roughly divided into three areas - the Lowlands with its thick woodlands, the Highlands and its towering mountains and lochs, and the islands and their peace, quiet, and far-reaching sea views.\n\nThe highest point in Scotland, and the whole of the British Isles for that matter, is Ben Nevis, which reaches 4,418ft at its peak - a great challenge for hikers. If you visit, don’t miss out on a chance to visit Edinburgh, Scotland’s capital which is rich in stunning architecture and culture.\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nLonely Planet declared Belfast and the Causeway Coast as the number one region in the world to visit in 2018 - and that’s saying something. The Giant Causeway is Northern Ireland’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site, an area of around 40,000 basalt columns left by volcanic eruptions 60 million years ago and is well worth the trip alone.\n\nDrive the incredible Causeway Coastal Route around the Atlantic Ocean and stop at one of many quaint villages for the night to sip on a Guinness. And if it’s a city you’re after, Northern Ireland has that too. Belfast’s Victorian buildings and industrial heritage hark at its interesting past, but the buzz of Irish nightlife and impressive restaurant scene draws visitors in today.\n\nYou will have an amazing time wherever you choose to visit the UK.
