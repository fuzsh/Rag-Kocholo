        "text": "Europe’s capital cities have undergone significant changes over time, both in terms of their physical infrastructure and their cultural and political identities. Some European capitals perhaps carry more historical weight than others.\n\nProminent European capitals\n\nParis, France\n\nParis, for example, has a long and storied history, and over the centuries it has evolved from a small Roman outpost into one of the most iconic cities in the world. One of the most notable changes in Paris has been the transformation of its urban landscape, particularly during the 19th century under the guidance of Baron Haussmann. Haussmann oversaw the construction of many of Paris’s most famous boulevards, parks, and buildings, giving the city its distinctive character.\n\nLondon, UK\n\nLondon has a rich history that dates back thousands of years, and over time it has served as the capital of various empires and nations. One of the most significant changes in London’s history came during the Industrial Revolution, when the city underwent massive expansion and modernisation, leading to the growth of its population and economy. Today, London is one of the most diverse and cosmopolitan cities in the world, reflecting its long history of cultural and political diversity.\n\nBerlin, Germany\n\nBerlin has also undergone significant changes over time, particularly during the 20th century. Following the Second World War, the city was divided into East and West Berlin, with the construction of the Berlin Wall separating the two halves. The fall of the Wall in 1989 marked a major turning point in the city’s history, leading to its reunification and the rapid transformation of its physical and cultural landscape.\n\nAthens, Greece\n\nAthens is one of the oldest cities in Europe, with a history that dates back more than 3,400 years. Over the centuries, the city has served as a centre of learning, art and philosophy, and its contributions to Western civilization are incalculable. In more recent times, Athens has undergone significant changes, particularly in the wake of Greece’s economic crisis. Despite these challenges, the city remains a vibrant and culturally rich destination for visitors from around the world.\n\nComplete list of European capital cities and populations\n\nBut enough with the history, here is a complete list of Europe’s capital cities (and their populations using Demographia’s World Urban Area Report for cities over 500,000 and verified sources for those that fall below) in a handy A to Zagreb format.\n\nAmsterdam, Netherlands – 1.7 million\n\nAndorra la Vella, Andorra – 22,000\n\nAthens, Greece – 3.3 million\n\nBelgrade, Serbia – 1.35 million\n\nBerlin, Germany – 4.28 million\n\nBern, Switzerland – 133,000\n\nBratislava, Slovakia – 424,000\n\nBrussels, Belgium – 2.23 million\n\nBucharest, Romania – 2.09 million\n\nBudapest, Hungary – 2.4 million\n\nChisinau, Moldova – 503,000\n\nCopenhagen, Denmark – 1.65 million\n\nDublin, Ireland – 1,38 million\n\nHelsinki, Finland – 1.14 million\n\nKyiv, Ukraine – 2.88 million*\n\nLisbon, Portugal – 2.83 million\n\nLjubljana, Slovenia – 279,000\n\nLondon, UK – 10.8 million\n\nLuxembourg City, Luxembourg – 114,000\n\nMadrid, Spain – 6.79 million\n\nMinsk, Belarus – 2.12 million\n\nMonaco, Monaco – 36,000\n\nMoscow, Russia – 17.8 million\n\nNicosia, Cyprus – 200,000\n\nOslo, Norway – 1.0 million\n\nParis, France – 11.1 million\n\nPodgorica, Montenegro – 200,000\n\nPrague, Czech Republic – 1.24 million\n\nReykjavik, Iceland – 122,000\n\nRiga, Latvia – 603,000\n\nRome, Italy – 3.23 million\n\nSan Marino, San Marino – 33,000\n\nSarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina – 275,000\n\nSkopje, North Macedonia – 546,000\n\nSofia, Bulgaria – 1.08 million\n\nStockholm, Sweden – 2.2 million\n\nTallinn, Estonia – 426,000\n\nTirana, Albania – 917,000\n\nVaduz, Liechtenstein – 5,400\n\nValletta, Malta – 5,700\n\nVienna, Austria – 2.0 million\n\nVilnius, Lithuania – 550,000\n\nWarsaw, Poland – 2.0 million\n\nZagreb, Croatia – 691,000\n\nEurope’s capital cities have undergone significant changes over time, reflecting the complex interplay of history, culture, politics, and economics.
