        "text": "Transcript\n\nOkay, so you have Britain.\n\nGreat Britain.\n\nThe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nAll of these terms refer to the same place, right? Not exactly.\n\nThe British Isles are a group of islands off the northwestern coast of Europe.\n\nThe largest of these islands are Britain\n\nand Ireland.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the name “Britain” was also used for a small part of France now known as Brittany.\n\nSo people started to call the island Great Britain. That name became official when the island’s rival kingdoms of England and Scotland united as the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707.\n\nMake sense so far? Good, because it’s about to get complicated.\n\nIreland formally joined with Great Britain in 1801. Together they were known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland—or the United Kingdom for short.\n\nBut in 1922, all but six counties in the north of Ireland seceded.\n\nThe remaining unified country renamed itself the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which it remains today.\n\nSo, for those of you keeping score at home—the British Isles include the islands of Great Britain and Ireland. Great Britain is the location of Scotland, England, and Wales. So what’s the difference between Great Britain and the United Kingdom? Your answer’s right here."
