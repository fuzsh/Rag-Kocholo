        "text": "Get around\n\nThe main travel options in summary are:\n\nBy bus: This is the cheapest and usually the best way to get around London as a tourist: on most of the Underground, you won't see anything!\n\nBy Tube / Underground: 11 lines cover the central area and suburbs, run by TfL.\n\nBy Overground and the Elizabeth Line: Urban rail systems, part of TfL's network.\n\nBy National Rail: A complex network of suburban rail services, privately run and not part of the TfL network, although all operators now accept Oyster payments within Greater London.\n\nBy Docklands Light Railway (DLR): An automatic metro system running from the City to East London via the Docklands, run by TfL.\n\nBy foot: In central London, walking to the next Tube station often takes around 10 minutes, and is a more scenic choice than going underground. The street layout can be confusing, so a street map is essential; map and travel apps for smartphones and tablets are incredibly useful and many stations have central London printed maps for Â£2.\n\nBy boat: Both commuter ferries run by TfL and pleasure cruises ply along the River Thames. Some services accept Oyster cards, but special fares apply, so check before you travel.\n\nBy bicycle: There are hire bicycles (known to Londoners as \"Boris Bikes\" after former London mayor Boris Johnson) operated by TfL available for pick up in inner London. You will need a credit or debit card with a PIN. If you bring your own bike, there are plenty of cycle lanes and traffic is normally considerate.\n\nBy tram (Tramlink): A tram service that operates only in southern suburbs around Croydon, Wimbledon and Bromley. Run by TfL.\n\nBy public transport\n\nTransport maps\n\nLondon is the home of the famous Tube map, and TfL produces some excellent maps to help you get around:\n\nTube map, showing Underground, Overground, DLR, TfL Rail, Tramlink and cable car.\n\nRail and Tube map, showing every rail service in Greater London.\n\nNight Tube map, showing which Tube and Overground lines run all night on Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nBus maps include \"spider maps\" by route and borough and a simplified map showing key bus routes and visitor attractions in central London.\n\nRiver buses - great if you're near the Thames.\n\nToilets on the Tube - a map of every TfL station with a public lavatory.\n\nLondon has one of the most comprehensive public transport systems in the world. Despite residents' perpetual (and sometimes justified) grumbling about unreliability, public transport is often the best option for getting anywhere for visitors and residents alike. In central London use a combination of the transport options listed below - and check your map: in many cases, you can easily walk from one place to another or use the buses. Public transportation shuts down early on Christmas Eve, and all day on Christmas Day.\n\nTransport for London (TfL) is a government organisation responsible for all public transport. Their website contains maps plus an excellent journey planner. TfL publishes a useful 'coping guide' specially designed for travellers who wish to use public transport during their visit to London. TfL also offers a 24-hour travel information line, charged at a premium rate: tel +44 843 222 1234 (or text 60835) for suggestions on getting from A to B, and for up to the minute information on how services are running. Fortunately for visitors (and indeed residents) there is a single ticketing system, Oyster, which enables travellers to switch between modes of transport on one ticket.\n\nYou must have a valid ticket at all times when travelling by bus, tram or train in London. If you can't show a valid ticket or a validated Oyster card you will have to pay a Penalty Fare, which is usually Â£40 (increased to Â£80 if it isn't paid within 21 days). Always buy your ticket before you get on the train. If using an Oyster Card, ensure that you touch in and out on a yellow reader before and after travelling by Tube or train, even if there are no barriers or they are left open.\n\nThere are four types of tickets you can buy: the Oyster card (a contactless electronic smartcard), Travelcards (which exist both in paper form or can be loaded on your Oyster card), contactless debit or credit cards, and paper tickets. Paper tickets are significantly more expensive than paying by Oyster card or contactless card.\n\nOyster cards\n\nOyster is a contactless electronic smartcard run by Transport for London. Unless you have a contactless credit or debit card, Oyster is the most cost-effective option if you plan to be in London for any more than a couple of days, or if you intend to make return visits to the city: the savings quickly recover the initial purchase cost. You can buy an Oyster card from any Tube station for a deposit of Â£7. You can \"top up\" an Oyster card with electronic funds at ticket machines or shops displaying the \"Oyster\" logo. This money is then deducted according to where you travel. The cost of a single trip using the Oyster card is considerably less than buying a single paper ticket with cash. Prices vary depending on the distance travelled, whether by bus or Tube, and on the time of day. You can also add various electronic seven-day, 1 month and longer-period Travelcards onto an Oyster, and the card is simply validated each time you use it.\n\nThe deposit is fully refundable; if you have less than Â£10 credit on your card, you can claim an instant refund of the credit and deposit at some ticket machines after 48 hours of purchase of your Oyster card. Station staff will assist you if necessary. However, your Oyster card, and the credit on it, never expires, so keep it around in case you return to London. Be prepared to give your signature on receipts or even show ID for refunds over a few pounds.\n\nYou can sign up for contactless and Oyster account. This will allow you to track your journeys and make refund claims for incomplete journeys.\n\nVisitor Oyster card is a version of the normal Oyster card targeted to travellers. This version of the Oyster card can be purchased from some travel agents outside London and overseas or ordered by mail. This card can also be sent back to TfL by mail after a trip to London to claim a refund for the unused balance. Visitor Oyster cards come pre-charged with pay-as-you-go credit: in increments from Â£10 to Â£50. The card itself costs Â£5 non refundable fee plus postage. With a Visitor Oyster card you can also get some discounts in various venues across the city. The Visitor Oyster cards are for pay as you go use only and cannot be registered to provide protection against loss or topped up from the Oyster smart-phone app.\n\nIf you have a National Railcard, such as the 16-25 Railcard or the Senior Railcard, you can register this with your Oyster card at a Tube station (members of staff near ticket machines can do this) to receive a 33% discount on off-peak pay-as-you-go fares on rail & tube.\n\nValidity of your Oyster\n\nOyster is valid on all red London buses, and almost all trains in London: a list of destinations is available on the London Tube and Rail Services map. Oyster is not valid on buses or trains outside London: if you need to travel beyond the stations on the map, you will have to pay for a paper ticket. Oyster is also not accepted on long-distance coaches, tour buses, or charter buses. Also, Oyster cannot be used on the Heathrow Express.\n\nThe following table summarises the validity of the different tickets you can use on Oyster. For most tourists, the Tube, trains, and buses are the only transport you will use, but Oyster is not valid at all on airport express trains to Heathrow, Gatwick, Luton, Stansted or Southend. However, Oyster is valid on the Piccadilly Underground line & the Elizabeth Line to Heathrow Airport. Note, peak fares are charged at all times to Heathrow Airport.\n\nBus Tram London Underground London Overground National Rail\n\n(within London) DLR Airport Express trains Pay-as-you-go yes yes yes yes yes yes yes (Heathrow Express and Gatwick Express only, special fares apply) Travelcard yes yes yes yes yes yes no Bus & Tram pass yes yes no no no no no\n\nUsing your Oyster card\n\nWhen using your Oyster card to travel, make sure the reader is displaying an orange light, then place it flat against the reader. A single beep and a green light mean your card has been accepted, and you can proceed. Two beeps and a red light mean your card has not been accepted. Take the card off the reader, wait for the orange light, and try again; if this continues to happen, ask for help from a member of staff. Don't try to insert your Oyster card into the slot at the ticket gates!\n\nWhen getting on any kind of train, you must touch your Oyster card on the yellow circular reader at the start and end of your journey. At stations with ticket gates, these readers will be on the right-hand side of the gates. In the outlying parts of the city there are no entry or exit gates at some stations. In this case, the readers are on free-standing cabinets next to entrances/exits. Failing to touch out when you leave a station will result in you being charged a maximum fare for your journey, since the system doesn't know which station you left from. The maximum fare is between Â£5.40 and Â£14.20, and depends on the station where you started your journey.\n\nUsually you will not need to touch your Oyster card on a reader when changing trains. However, some stations have pink Oyster \"route validators\" on the platforms: if you are getting off one train and getting onto another at one of these stations, touch your Oyster on the pink reader so that the system charges you the right fare for the route you have taken. There are a few other situations where you might have to touch out when changing trains (usually when changing between Tube, DLR and/or National Rail) - in these cases make sure you touch back in before getting on your next train.\n\nWhen using a London bus or a tram, touch in once when getting on. Don't touch out when you get off the bus or you will be charged twice. Most buses have their Oyster reader next to the driver. Trams and some buses have Oyster readers on poles next to the doors.\n\nYou can make a change to another bus or a tram free of charge during one hour. You'll still have to touch your Oyster on the 2nd bus or tram, but no money will be deducted then.\n\nContactless credit or debit cards or other RFID identity cards may interfere with your Oyster if you keep them in the same wallet. This usually results in an error message but may mean you get charged the full fare from your contactless credit or debit card instead. Be careful standing near the readers on some buses - they are often quite sensitive and may read your card from several centimetres away, even if you did not intend this. It is best to remove the card from the wallet or purse it is in.\n\nPay-as-you-go (PrePay) with your Oyster\n\nYou can top up your Oyster card with cash at any Tube station ticket machine or ticket office (you can use a credit card if it has a PIN) with Oyster pay-as-you-go, also known as PrePay. Money is then deducted from your Oyster card each time you travel. When travelling by train, the fare is calculated based on where you started and ended your journey. Pay-as-you-go is much cheaper than paying by cash for each journey, especially if you make multiple trips. Bus fares are flat and you will be charged the same fare every time you get on the bus, regardless of distance.\n\nThe amount of Oyster credit deducted from your card in one day is capped to a daily limit. This means that on a day-to-day basis, you will always get the best fares when using Oyster pay-as-you-go. Even if you travel by bus only, your total fares are also capped, this makes bus travel very good value in central London if you are making lots of journeys.\n\nTravelcards\n\nA Travelcard gives you unlimited travel on trains within the relevant zones, and on red London buses. A Travelcard is typically loaded onto your Oyster, but for periods longer than 7 days, you will usually need to register your Oyster card or provide some form of photographic I.D.\n\nFor an up-to-date and comprehensive list of fares, see TfL's website.\n\nIf you are using Oyster and travel beyond the zones of your Travelcard, you will be charged an extension fare from your pay-as-you-go credit when you touch out at your destination.\n\nContactless credit/debit cards, Apple Pay and Google Pay can be used to pay fares anywhere Oyster is accepted. Most Visa, MasterCard, Maestro, Cirrus or American Express cards issued outside the UK are accepted. Some pre-paid cards may work as well. Some cards such as Visa contactless cards issued in the United States will not work.\n\nWhen you enter or leave a station or get on the bus, touch the card against the yellow validation reader as if it were an Oyster card. The price is the same as with an Oyster card. The price per day is automatically capped at the price of a day ticket. You also avoid the queues at ticket machines, the Â£5 deposit for an Oyster card, and you never have to top it up. A Travelcard can not be loaded onto a contactless card. The same card cannot be used by two or more different passengers. You must use the same device to touch in and out, otherwise you may get charged for two journeys - for example, if you touch in using your smartphone but touch out using your physical card, the system may get confused and charge you twice, even if the phone is linked to the same card.\n\nYou may notice a charge of Â£0.10 on your bank statement shortly after you touch in for the first time - this is normal. This will change to the price of all your travel for that day, usually overnight but sometimes it can take a few days.\n\nUsing a contactless card as a visitor from abroad may be tricky though. Your bank may ask for additional confirmations, so TfL may suspend accepting a card until you release a pending payment. Also sometimes you may end up with an unfinished journey even though you've touched an exit gate probably because a card may require a bit longer to process after a gate is opened. Keep your card at a reader until the gate opens fully. You can sign up for a contactless and Oyster account to check for these issues.\n\nFares\n\nEvery station where you can use Oyster or contactless payment is in a \"fare zone\" from 1 to 9 - you can see what zone a station is in on the Tube Map (look for the shaded areas and numbers in the background). Some stations on the boundary of two zones have their name written in a white box, which means they're considered to be in both zones (for example Earl's Court is in zones 1 and 2). If your journey starts or ends at one of these stations, the system will work out which zone would result in the cheapest fare and charge that.\n\nThe price of a journey is determined by how many zones it passes through. In general, the more zones you travel through, the higher the fare, with journeys passing through Zone 1 (most stations in Central London) being more expensive than ones going around it. TfL's website has a single fare finder tool that can be used to work out the price of a journey between any two stations. Most journeys have both a peak and off-peak fare - a peak journey is one starting between 06:30 and 09:30 and between 16:00 and 19:00 on working days (excluding public holidays).\n\nPay as you go fares are capped: once the fares for all your journeys on the same day add up to a certain amount (which varies depending on all the zones travelled), any further travel that day will be free. There are also weekly caps, covering all travel within a calendar week. Caps are calculated separately for peak and off-peak travel. Note that, even once you have reached a daily or weekly cap, you still need to touch in and out for each journey, otherwise you are traveling without a valid ticket - though you won't be charged anything for it. If you use a combination of Tube, zone 1-6 railway, and bus journeys, the Tube's fare caps (based on the farthest zone you travelled to) will apply to all your journeys for that day.\n\nPaper tickets\n\nIt's still possible to pay for a journey by a paper single or return ticket. However, this only makes sense if you take perhaps two to three journeys on public transport during your trip to London as they cost significantly more (roughly double the cost) in comparison with the other means of payment.\n\nSeason tickets can also be purchased in paper.\n\nAccessibility\n\nIf you have a physical disability, you might find it harder to travel around London. The oldest parts of the Underground date from the middle of the 19th century, and some of the surface rail network is even older. Therefore, much of the transport system wasn't built to cater for people with disabilities; narrow, winding passageways, steep staircases, and cavernous gaps between some platforms and trains are all barriers for certain passengers.\n\nHowever, times and attitudes have changed: all stations, lines and trains built since the 1990s are accessible and many older stations have been retrofitted with lifts and ramps. In addition, all London buses and trams have low-floor doors, access ramps and space onboard for at least one wheelchair user; most black cabs (taxis) are also accessible. That said, there are still significant gaps in accessibility, particularly on the Tube in Central London.\n\nTo help you navigate, TfL publish several maps to cater for different needs:\n\nThe standard Tube map marks all stations that are step-free from either street to platform (white wheelchair symbol) or street to train (blue wheelchair symbol).\n\nThe Step-free Tube map goes into more detail, indicating the height difference between platform and train floor-level.\n\nThe Large-print Tube map and Black-and-white Tube map[dead link] serve travellers with visual impairments.\n\nThe Audio Tube map is available to stream or download, however as of early 2023 it was last updated in 2016.\n\nFor more info, visit the transport accessibility portal on the TfL website.\n\nBy Underground\n\nThe London Underground, known popularly as the Tube due to its tube-like tunnels drilled through the London clay, is a network of 11 lines which criss-cross London in one of the largest underground rail networks in the world. It was also the first: the oldest section, from Paddington to Farringdon, opened as the Metropolitan Railway in 1863. The Tube is an easy method of transport even for new visitors to London and is equivalent to subway and metro systems in other world cities.\n\nThe routes operated by the London Underground fall into 2 broad types: the older \"sub-surface\" lines, encompassing the Metropolitan, District, Circle and Hammersmith & City lines, date from the 19th century. The \"deep level\" routes were largely constructed in the early-to-mid-20th century. The sub-surface lines are usually accessed by walking down a short set of stairs, whereas the deep-level lines are accessed by a complicated network of escalators or lifts. It is the deep lines which are served by the iconic tube-shaped trains which, despite their small size, can only just fit through the tunnels. However, the deep-level trains do not have air conditioning, which can make them unbearably hot in the summer.\n\nEach line has stations with interesting architectural and artistic features typical of the era they were opened. As you travel around the network, look out for Victorian finery, Edwardian glazed tiles, smooth Art Deco symmetry, and striking modern masterpieces. Various conservation pieces are also present, such as the heritage 1900s station name roundel sign at Caledonian Road on the westbound platform.\n\nTrains on most days and on most lines run from around 5:30AM to around 1AM. They are usually the fastest way to travel in London, the only problem being the relative expense and the fact that they can get extremely crowded during rush hours (7:30-10AM and 4:30-7PM). There is no air conditioning on the deep-level trains. TfL's website has a page notifying of tracking delays, closures, and planned engineering works, which you should check if you plan to travel on a Saturday or a Sunday, when entire lines may be shut down due to engineering works.\n\nIf you're travelling around central London then taking the Tube for just one stop can be a waste of time. For example, to travel between Leicester Square and Covent Garden stations takes over 10 minutes on the Tube, despite the two stations being only a few minutes walk apart. This is especially true since the walk from a Tube station entrance to the platform at some central stations can be extensive. The Tube map also gives no information on London's extensive bus network, or any of its National Rail network except for Thameslink. For more information see the 'By foot' section.\n\nNight Tube\n\nThe Night Tube, introduced in 2016, is a limited 24-hour Tube service that operates on certain lines on Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nNight Tube fares are the same as the off-peak fares during the day. Day Travelcards are valid on the day they were issued (using the date printed on the card) and for journeys starting before 4:30AM the following day. For example, if you buy a Day Travelcard at 11AM on Friday, you can use it until 4:29AM on the following Saturday. Daily capping on Oyster cards and contactless payment cards also applies.\n\nAs of April 2022, the Night Tube runs on the following lines (it used to run on some other lines, but this has been curtailed due to the coronavirus). Also note that until June 2022, there are strikes that can affect the Night Tube service for the Central and Victoria lines, which the former likely to be more severe.\n\nCentral line: Trains run approximately every 10 minutes between White City and Leytonstone, and approximately every 20 minutes on the Ealing Broadway to White City, and Leytonstone to Loughton/Hainault sections. There is no service between North Acton and West Ruislip, Loughton and Epping, and Woodford and Hainault.\n\nVictoria line: Trains run every 10 minutes on average along the entire line.\n\nLondon Overground: Trains run every 15-20 minutes on average between Highbury & Islington and New Cross Gate.\n\nTicketing\n\nTravel on the Tube system will always require the purchase of a ticket or the use of an Oyster card or contactless payment card if you have one; fare evasion is treated as a serious matter and will get you a fine.\n\nSingle tickets are charged at two rates, depending on the payment method. Cash fares and single Oyster fares are zonal, meaning that the price of a journey is determined by the zones you travelled through. There are additional fares payable for zones beyond 9, but these are mostly outside what is considered London.\n\nPaper travelcards valid for 1 day or 7 days are also available and can also be used on buses, National Rail trains, the DLR and Croydon Tramlink - however there is a capping feature for contactless and Oyster cards (which guarantees a strict upper bound on the fare you pay for a day and a week) which means that a paper travelcard is unnecessary and costlier.\n\nAlmost all stations have automatic ticket barriers. If you pay by Oyster card or a contactless payment card, just tap your card against the yellow pad to open the barriers (ensure that you do this upon both entrance and exit). If you have a paper ticket, insert it face-up into the slot on the front of the machine, and remove it from the top to enter the station. If you have a single ticket it will be retained at the exit gate. If you have luggage or if your ticket is rejected there is normally a staffed gate as well.\n\nPaper tickets can be purchased from vending machines in the station's ticket hall. The touchscreen machines have instructions in multiple languages, offer a greater choice of ticket and accept bills and credit/debit cards (if your card has no embedded microchip, you cannot use these machines; these machines do not support contactless). You can also add Oyster pay-as-you-go credit on many mainline ticket vending machines in London.\n\nIf you have a national train ticket, which involves travelling across London (e.g. Brighton to Darlington), you may be able to travel on the Tube across London, from one London terminus to another. If your train ticket has \"Any permitted â€ \" (with the dagger symbol) written in the \"Route\" section (at the bottom of the ticket), then you are able to travel on the Tube without buying another ticket. These can be used at the ticket barriers in the same way as the paper tickets described above.\n\nNavigation\n\nAll lines are identified by name (e.g. Circle line, Central line, Piccadilly line). Many lines have multiple branches rather than running point-to-point, so always check the train's destination (which is shown on the front of the train and the platform indicator screens, and will be broadcast on the train's PA). Most branches are only served by specific services; from the eastern end of the District line at Upminster, for instance, you can only catch trains for Ealing Broadway and Richmond - if you want to go to Wimbledon, you will have to change trains later down the line. Trains stop at all stations with the exception of the Metropolitan line, which during peak hours runs \"semi-fast\" and \"fast\" trains that skip some stations.\n\nSigns can be seen to be vague, especially if you are unfamiliar with what compass point direction (e.g. northbound) you're travelling in, as these are most often given rather than destinations. A person new to the Tube can become very frustrated trying to work out where a particular connection at a particular station is found. Each station is staffed by at least two personnel at all times who can advise you on your route and full system maps are on the walls of every platform and ticket office. Additionally, on every platform, there are individual line maps showing all the stations served by trains calling at that platform. Google Maps is another handy tool.\n\nThe Tube is made up of 11 lines each bearing a traditional name and a standard colour on the Tube map. You can change between lines at interchange stations (providing you stay within the zones shown on your ticket). Since the Tube map is well designed it is very easy to work out how to get between any two stations, and since each station is clearly signed it is easy to work out when to exit your train. The Tube map is a diagram and not a scaled map, making it misleading for determining the relative distance between stations as it makes central stations appear further apart and somewhat out of place - the most distant reaches of the Metropolitan Line for example are almost 64 km (40 mi) from the centre of the city. Tube maps are freely available from any station, most tourist offices, and are prominently displayed in stations. The National Rail map showing National Rail services is displayed as a large poster at most Tube stations.\n\nDirection signs for the platforms indicate the geographical direction of the line, not the last stop of the line. It is always advisable to carry a pocket Tube map to help you with this.\n\nThe Northern line has two routes through central London which split at Euston and rejoin at Kennington. One (the Charing Cross Branch) runs through the West End, while the other route runs via the City of London (called the Bank branch, or the City branch). It is fairly easy to work out which way your train is going; check the signs above the platform, and on the front of the train. The train's destination and central branch will also be announced on board, for example \"This train is for Edgware, via Charing Cross.\"\n\nThe London Underground has connections to all terminals at Heathrow (including Terminals 4 & 5) and most major London rail termini, with the exception of Fenchurch Street. Interchange hubs are also served, (such as Farringdon, Elephant & Castle, Harrow & Wealdstone and Stratford.\n\nOnboard\n\nBe considerate of your fellow passengers as best you can. Pushing and rushing are seen as extremely rude - there's not much need to run for a Tube train unless it's the very last one of the day! Also, trying to strike up a conversation with strangers is seen as peculiar and will instantly mark you out as a tourist. Despite having a reputation as being aloof Londoners are usually happy to help out if you have a problem, but otherwise they'd rather you didn't try to be overly familiar.\n\nIn some cases (particularly for the sub-surface lines), the tube doors have buttons on the outside. They normally come to use if a train is waiting for over 45 seconds, as the doors will automatically close to conserve energy. If the train isn't ready to depart (which is easy to check - if the button isn't illuminated, the train is ready to depart), pressing the button will open the doors.\n\nCrime, safety, and accidents\n\nWhen using the escalators, always stand on the right to allow people in a hurry to pass. Drinking alcohol or smoking anywhere on the London Underground is illegal.\n\nCrime levels on the Tube are comparable to but typically lower than in many other subway systems, and traveller advice about watching luggage and valuables is reasonable. The Tube system is covered by an extensive CCTV system, although it is not advised to be reliant on this fact when travelling.\n\nThe London Underground considers its safety record to be a matter of professional honour, major incidents being incredibly rare (despite the media attention they generate). Front-line staff are well trained for emergencies and will follow well-rehearsed procedures. In addition, front-line staff are generally appreciative of traveller vigilance, if concerns are politely expressed. If you notice something that concerns you please speak to a member of staff or a British Transport Police officer.\n\nGetting help\n\nOn the wall of the platforms (or freestanding on outdoor platforms) there will be a round, white device labelled \"Help Point\" with one or two buttons and a fire alarm. Press the green button to alert staff to an emergency and press the blue button to ask for non-urgent assistance. If you see smoke or fire always use the fire alarm first.\n\nOn the train\n\nOn Tube trains you will notice that there is a red handle you can pull to alert the driver to a serious incident or accident occurring on the train. If the train is in a tunnel the alarm should only be used in dire emergencies that require immediate attention, as pulling the alarm will activate the train's brakes. In practice, when the alarm is activated, a driver will move the train forward into the next station where help can be obtained. Therefore, the alarms should only be used in stations if possible as passengers will then be able to escape the train quickly if needed.\n\nTfL advise travellers to carefully consider their usage of the passenger alarm and, if suitable, leave the train at the next station and seek help from station staff instead. Because trains on the London Underground are run close together any delays can have serious knock-on effects for the rest of the service. In contrast, train drivers vary in their opinion as to when the alarm should be used: Consensus tends to be that if it's something you would run down the train to tell the driver then the alarm should definitely be used.\n\nLost items\n\nOwing to a heightened security climate, and a history of political violence targeting the Tube, unattended baggage may be treated as a suspect or explosive device and may be destroyed. Lost items (if not destroyed) will end up at the Lost Property Office and will be stored for 3 months. You will need to fill in a form online describing your lost item and TfL will contact you if it is found. There is a charge for recovery of most items, however some items (e.g. Laptops) have higher fees.\n\nBy bus\n\nLondon's iconic red Routemaster buses, which are recognised the world over, were withdrawn from regular service in 2005. Although a heritage service was continued on portions of two routes, this ceased in 2019. Routemasters are still used for tours and private parties.\n\nBuses are generally quicker than taking the Tube for shorter (less than a couple of stops on the Tube) trips, and out of central London you're likely to be closer to a bus stop than a Tube station. Most buses in London are very frequent (at least every ten minutes) and are accessible for buggies and wheelchairs. Buses also have a flat rate fare which stays the same no matter how far you travel. You will need to pay the fare again if you board a different bus, although the Hopper fare allows you to take as many buses as you like in 62 minutes and only pay for the first one.\n\nOver 5 million bus trips are made each weekday; with over 700 different bus routes you are never far from a bus. Each bus stop has a sign listing the routes that stop there and bus routes are identified by numbers and sometimes letters. Buses have very clear blinds on the front, with their route number and their destination. Transport for London produces all Bus route maps.\n\nUsing the bus\n\nBus tips\n\nBuses can accelerate and brake very fast so always grab hold of one of the handrails if standing.\n\nIf you are taking a pram/buggy with you, you must be prepared to fold it and carry your child if the bus is crowded or if a wheelchair user needs to get on the bus.\n\nSmoking and drinking alcohol is not allowed on buses. Non-alcoholic drinks and most food is fine, but be considerate: fast food is often smelly and leaves a mess.\n\nNo standing on the upper deck or stairs.\n\nDon't speak to the driver or try to get their attention when the bus is moving unless it is an emergency.\n\nSome buses terminate early and don't run the full length of the route. Always check the destination blind on the front of the bus, and if in doubt, ask the driver or the conductor. Drivers will usually announce a change in the bus's destination.\n\nIf your bus terminates early and you have paid using Oyster or contactless debit/credit card, ask the driver for a continuation ticket, sometimes called a transfer ticket. This will allow you to board another bus of the same route number to reach your destination without paying again.\n\nWhen you see your bus approaching, signal clearly to the driver that you intend to get on their bus: the way to do this is to stick your hand out, with an open palm. The driver will indicate and pull into the stop. Always wait for people to get off the bus before you enter.\n\nMost buses have two doors. Form an orderly queue at the front door: when you reach the driver, touch your Oyster or contactless card on the reader or show them your Travelcard or pass (importantly, cash is not accepted). Some buses are worked by the \"New Routemaster\": you can get on this bus at any of its three doors, as long as you touch in your Oyster or contactless card as soon as you board. It should be noted that unlike the Tube, you are allowed to use an Oyster card which has zero (but not negative) or insufficient balance - this will cause the balance to be negative (the machines will flash an \"Emergency fare charged\" message which is the same as the normal fare); however, you must then recharge before the card can be used again.\n\nIf you are a wheelchair user, you should indicate as normal, and wait by the second door from the front. The driver will activate the wheelchair ramp for you to use.\n\nMost buses have a system that provides visual and audible announcements of the bus's destination at every stop, the stops, and nearby landmarks.\n\nWhen you are nearing your stop, press one of the red \"STOP\" buttons on the handrails once only. You'll hear a bell, or a buzzer, and the words \"Bus Stopping\" will appear on the destination screen. Get off the bus using the middle or rear door. There is also a blue \"stop\" button by the wheelchair space - this indicates to the driver that the wheelchair ramp is required at the next stop.\n\nFinally, always watch out for moving traffic, cyclists and pedestrians, when you get off the bus.\n\nFares\n\nIt is not possible to buy tickets on the bus so you must have a valid Travelcard, Oyster card or contactless credit or debit card before you get on. Alternatively, tickets may be purchased from most newsagents in London, or from ticket machines at certain central London stops. The adult bus fare is Â£1.65; discounts are available to holders of certain cards that must be applied for in advance.\n\nUnlike on the Tube, you are charged for each bus you travel on. If you change buses then you will normally be charged a new bus fare up to the daily/weekly price cap. However, the Hopper fare allows you to make unlimited bus or tram journeys for the price of one if you use an Oyster card or contactless payment method. All of your journeys must be made within an hour of touching in on the first bus or tram you are travelling on and you must also use the same Oyster or contactless card for the other journeys.\n\nOyster\n\nIf you have a seven-day, monthly or yearly Travelcard or Bus and Tram Pass on your Oyster, that includes free bus travel across all of London, even outside the zones of your Travelcard (buses aren't subject to zones). You still must touch in when you get on the bus, but you won't be charged.\n\nIf you do not have a Travelcard, the fare is taken from your Oyster pay as you go credit as soon as you touch in when you get on the bus. Daily bus and tram travel is \"capped\", so you generally won't pay more than an equivalent travelcard.\n\nUnlike the Tube, you are allowed to use an Oyster card which has zero (but not negative) or insufficient balance - this will cause the balance to be negative (the machines will flash an \"Emergency fare charged\" message which is the same as the normal fare); however, you must then recharge before the card can be used again.\n\nTouch your Oyster on the reader as soon as you get on the bus or you may be liable to a Penalty Fare or prosecution.\n\nYou can also pay for with most contactless debit, credit or prepaid Visa, MasterCard/Maestro or American Express cards. You touch the card flat against the reader, like you would with an Oyster card, but your account is charged instead. Some foreign-issued cards will not work for contactless payment.\n\nThe total charges for that day are calculated and taken out of your account overnight. As with Oyster, you are charged for each bus fare, up to a cap each day. In addition, a weekly price cap applies from Monday to Sunday.\n\nSee above for further information on contactless payment.\n\nConcessions\n\nChildren aged 10 and under travel for free on the bus when accompanied by an adult. Children between the ages of 11 and 15 must touch in using a Zip card, yet journeys are still free on buses. If they do not have a Zip card they must pay the full fare using an adult Oyster or contactless card. 16-18 Student Oyster cards (only available to students studying in London) go up to age 18 and journeys are still free. Residents of England who have an ENCTS free bus pass (for the elderly or disabled) also get free travel: simply show your pass to the driver or conductor.\n\nNight buses\n\nNight bus hints\n\nWhile Britons on public transport are normally a model of reserve, those using night buses have a bit of a reputation for loud and rowdy behaviour. Their passengers are often people who have been having a good time in central London's clubs and bars; particularly true on buses leaving central London between 1AM and 3aM. While the buses are normally quite safe, if this is a concern for you, consider taking a pre-booked minicab instead, or failing that stand on the lower deck of the bus nearest the driver.\n\nAlways call out to the driver if you are pickpocketed, threatened or attacked.\n\nStandard bus services run from around 6AM-12:30AM. Around half past midnight the network changes to the vast night bus network of well over 100 routes stretching all over the city. There are two types of night buses: 24-hour routes and N-prefixed routes.\n\n24-hour services keep the same number as during the day and will run exactly the same route, such as the number 88, for example. N-prefixed routes are generally very similar to their day-route, but may take a slightly different route or are extended to serve areas that are further out. For example, the 29 bus goes from Trafalgar Square to Wood Green during the day; however, the N29 bus goes from Trafalgar Square to Wood Green and then continues to Enfield.\n\nNight buses run at a 30-minute frequency at minimum, with many routes at much higher frequencies up to every 5 minutes.\n\nPrices stay the same, and daily Travelcards are valid until 04:29 the day after they were issued, so can be used on night buses. Most bus stops will have night bus maps with all the buses to and from that local area on it, although it is good to check on the TfL website beforehand, which also has all those maps easily available.\n\nBy DLR\n\nDocklands Light Railway (DLR) is a dedicated light rail network operating in East London, connecting with the Tube network at Bank, Tower Gateway (close to Tower Hill station), Canning Town, Heron Quays (close to Canary Wharf Tube station), and Stratford. As the trains operate automatically, it can be quite exciting â€“ especially for children â€“ to sit at the front and look out through the window, whilst feeling as though one is driving the train oneself. The DLR runs above ground on much of its route, and travels through many scenic parts of London, including the Docklands area where most of London's skyscrapers are located.\n\nThe DLR can be a little confusing as the routes are not easily distinguished, however there are network maps on the train and the platform. Check the displays on the platform which will show you the destination and the wait for the next three trains, and also check the destination displays on the front and side of the train and listen for announcements. At busy times, some trains do not run the full length of the route. In this instance, you should take the first train, listen for announcements, and change where necessary. Be extra careful at Canning Town station as it is very busy and the line divides into two sections - one heading to Woolwich Arsenal and the other heading to Beckton. Always check the destination on the front of the train before getting on, especially at off-peak times when there may not be a return train for a good few minutes if you end up on the wrong branch.\n\nTicketing\n\nUnlike on the Tube, most DLR stations do not have ticket gates (except for Bank and Stratford) as they are unstaffed. Also, unlike the Tube, you do need to push the buttons to open the doors.\n\nYou can top up an Oyster card, buy a Travelcard or buy a paper ticket (at a substantial premium) from the ticket machines at the station. Most stations are unstaffed, so if you want to pay by cash then make sure you have plenty of change! As there are no gates, when travelling by Oyster you must always remember to touch in at the start of your journey and touch out at the end. Even if you are changing to the Underground at Canary Wharf/Heron Quays, you must still touch in/out at the DLR station: the system will recognise that you have made an interchange between the two stations and treat it as part of the same journey.\n\nBy train\n\nWikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain, with information applicable to the National Rail system within London.\n\nThe British railway system is known as National Rail (although some older signs still refer to it as \"British Rail\"). London's suburban rail services are operated by several private companies under tightly-written government contracts, and mostly run in the south of the city away from the main tourist sights. Only one line (Thameslink) runs through central London - on a north-south axis between London Bridge or Blackfriars stations, and the underground level of St Pancras main line station. There is no one central station - instead, there are twelve mainline stations dotted around the edge of the central area, and most are connected by the Circle line (except Euston, Fenchurch Street and those south of the river like Waterloo and London Bridge).\n\nMost visitors will not need to use National Rail services except for a few specific destinations such as Wimbledon, Hampton Court, Kew Gardens (Kew Bridge station), Windsor Castle, Greenwich, or the airports, or indeed if they are intending to visit other destinations in the UK. It's important to know that the quickest route between two stations is often a combination of the Tube as well as National Rail trains. For instance, if you are going from central London to Wimbledon, it will usually be much quicker to go to Waterloo and take the first Wimbledon train (around 15 minutes, maximum) rather than take the District line, which can take up to 45 minutes.\n\nYour pay-as-you-go Oyster card is valid in London zones 1-9 (and some extensions), but not beyond, so be careful â€” if you want to travel beyond the London zones you will need to buy a paper ticket from the ticket office at the station. If you travel beyond the London zones with no valid ticket, you will be charged a Penalty Fare (on National Rail services this is usually Â£20), you will have to buy another ticket for the remainder of your journey, and you will also be charged the maximum Oyster fare because you didn't touch out. This adds up to a lot, so be careful and make sure you plan your journey! If in doubt, ask at the ticket office. Importantly, there are stations where contactless payment but not Oyster is accepted - watch out for them.\n\nThere are express trains to and from Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. Tickets are often sold at a substantial premium, so you may want to consider taking the slightly slower 'stopping' services instead: for instance, an Anytime single from Victoria to Gatwick costs more on the Gatwick Express, then when marked \"Route Southern Only\"â€”taking a Southern train to Gatwick is only eight minutes longer. Similarly, while the journey from Paddington station to Heathrow Airport by Elizabeth Line will take around 10-15 minutes longer than by Heathrow Express, the walk-up fare will be twice as cheap (and even cheaper on the Tube, though the journey takes considerably longer), so it's often only worth the premium when you're in a hurry. Oyster cards are only valid to Heathrow when travelling by Tube, Heathrow Express, or the Elizabeth Line, to Gatwick by National Rail (including Gatwick Express), and to City by DLR. To all other airports they are not valid.\n\nDon't throw your ticket away until you're out of the station at your destination! Many stations have ticket gates which you will need to put your ticket through to exit; also, you need to retain all the parts of your ticket throughout your journey, as a member of railway staff may need to see it.\n\nBy Overground\n\nOverground hints\n\nBeware of pickpockets. Don't openly display your phone, wallet and other valuables.\n\nDrinking alcohol or smoking anywhere on the Overground is illegal.\n\nAlways stand well behind the yellow line painted on the platform. At some stations on the North London and West London lines freight trains run in the gap between Overground trains - because these trains are not stopping they can travel through stations at speed. Turbulence from these trains is dangerous.\n\nMost Overground trains have \"walk-through\" carriages with no doors separating each car. If the train is busy, try moving to the other end or towards the centre.\n\nGive up your seat to the elderly and those less able to stand, especially if the seat is labelled \"Priority Seat.\" These seats are a slightly different shade of orange than most seats.\n\nThe doors on the Overground will not open automatically. Wait for the button to light up and start beeping, then push it to open the train doors.\n\nTrains will usually run every 15 minutes or less, and more frequently on busy routes.\n\nDo not use flash photography or tripods when taking photographs. A camera flash can distract train drivers and tripods are not safe on the platform.\n\nIn common parlance, Londoners may refer to travelling by \"overground\", meaning going by National Rail (as opposed to going by Underground). However, only London Overground is a Transport for London rail service, which serves most boroughs of the capital. Oyster cards are accepted. Trains will usually run a minimum frequency of every 15 minutes, and some stations have a considerably more frequent service. The trains have big windows allowing for great \"urban scenic\" views.\n\nThe Overground appears on the Tube map as a double orange line. TfL also produces a map only showing Overground services. At many stations, trains leaving from the same platform will go to different destinations, so listen carefully for announcements and always check the destination on the front of the train. The Overground can be a great way to avoid changing trains in central London by skirting around the centre. It's also well-connected: you can frequently change for Underground trains, other Overground destinations, or for mainline National Rail services from Stratford, Clapham Junction and Watford Junction.\n\nThe different Overground services will be given distinct line names and colours from autumn 2024:\n\nLiberty line ( grey) between Romford and Upminster.\n\nLioness line ( yellow) between Euston and Watford Junction.\n\nMildmay line ( blue) between Stratford and Willesden Junction, where it splits into two branches to Richmond and Clapham Junction.\n\nSuffragette line ( light green) between Gospel Oak and Barking Riverside.\n\nWeaver line ( purple/maroon) starting at Liverpool Street, with three branches to Chingford, Cheshunt and Enfield Town.\n\nWindrush line ( red/pink) starting at Highbury and Islington, with four branches to Clapham Junction, New Cross, Crystal Place and West Croydon.\n\nBy the Elizabeth line\n\nThe Elizabeth line (known as Crossrail before and during construction) is London's newest railway line, having opened in May 2022 after a long series of delays. It appears on the Tube map as a double purple line (the colour purple is associated with royalty).\n\nIt runs from Reading and Heathrow Airport in the west to Abbey Wood and Shenfield in the east via London Paddington, Farringdon, London Liverpool St and Stratford.\n\nThe Elizabeth line is comparable to the RER in Paris: compared to the Underground, it has longer and faster trains that stop less frequently. With the exception of Ilford station, it is fully wheelchair-accessible and the trains are air-conditioned.\n\nBy Tramlink\n\nThe Tramlink network (which is operated as London Trams) is centred on Croydon, where it runs on street-level tracks around the Croydon Loop, providing transit to an area not well-served by the Tube or National Rail. Route 3 (Wimbledon to New Addington - green on the Tramlink map) is the most frequent service, running every 7 or 8 minutes Monday to Saturday daytime and every 15 minutes at all other times. Beckenham is served by Routes 1 and 2 (yellow and red on the Tramlink map), which terminate at Elmers End and Beckenham Junction respectively. All services travel around the Loop via West Croydon and run every 10 minutes Monday to Saturday daytime and every 30 minutes at all other times. Between Arena and Sandilands, these two services serve the same stops.\n\nLondon is a surprisingly compact city, making it a walker's delight. In many instances, walking is the quickest method of transport between two points.\n\nBecause Britain drives on the left hand side of the road, for most foreign visitors it can be all too easy to forget that traffic will come at you from the opposite direction than you are used to when crossing a street - for this reason remember to look right when you cross the road. If you are using a pedestrian crossing, don't risk it even if you can't see any traffic coming: Wait for the green man to appear and then cross quickly and carefully. Some pedestrian crossings now have countdown timers to indicate how long it will be safe to cross for.\n\nParticularly on Central London's busiest streets, it is easy to spot native Londoners as they weave in and out of the large crowds at fast speed; tourists who cannot will stand out. Make sure you're aware of your surroundings when in Londonâ€”Londoners are usually very considerate, but a group of tourists standing in the middle of the pavement can be a major annoyance! Try standing to the side of busy pavements and footpaths, especially if you're with a group.\n\nWalking alternatives to the Tube\n\nIn some instances, it can be faster to walk some or all of your intended route instead of taking the Tube. By looking at a map you'll notice that some central London Tube stations are a lot closer together than the Tube map would make you believe. TfL have produced a map detailing the walking time and number of steps between various popular stations.\n\nHere are some more specific instructions for some of the stations that you are likely to use as a tourist:\n\nLeicester Square station â€“ Covent Garden station: Come out of the station with The Hippodrome Casino behind you. Cross Charing Cross Road and walk up Cranbourn Street. Walk straight over at the junction and continue onto Long Acre. Walk straight up Long Acre to arrive at Covent Garden station. Approximate walking time: 5 minutes\n\nHolborn station â€“ Covent Garden station: Exit the station onto Kingsway, opposite a large Sainsbury's shop (if you exit onto High Holborn opposite a McDonald's - turn left, and round the corner). Cross Kingsway (this is a very busy road), and turn left on the other side. Take the second right (by a Starbucks) onto Great Queen Street. Walk straight, crossing over Drury Lane onto Long Acre. Continue on Long Acre, crossing over Endell Street/Bow Street. Covent Garden station will be on your left. Approximate walking time: 10 minutes.\n\nEmbankment station â€“ Waterloo station: Come out of the station onto Victoria Embankment, walk up the stairs and head across the River Thames using the Hungerford Bridge. At the other end of the bridge keep walking straight and away from the River Thames. Follow the railway line. You will come to some blue metal work and a walkway underneath the railway line called Sutton Walk. Follow this, cross the road and Waterloo station is ahead of you. Approximate walking time: 15 minutes\n\nWestminster station â€“ Waterloo station: Come out of the station and head across the River Thames using Westminster Bridge. Keep heading straight until you come to a junction. Turn left and walk down York Road. Stay on York Road until you come to a railway bridge. Waterloo station will be on your right. Approximate walking time: 15 minutes\n\nGreen Park station â€“ Hyde Park Corner station: Come out of Green Park station onto the road. This is Piccadilly. Walk west along Piccadilly following the edge of Green Park. When you come to a roundabout head straight across it. Hyde Park Corner station will be on your right. Approximate walking time: 10 minutes\n\nQueensway â€“ Bayswater: Turn to the left when exiting the station and keep walking. This is a good route if you want to quickly change to a different Tube line but not change at Notting Hill Gate. Approximate walking time: 1 minute\n\nOxford Circus station\n\nOxford Circus station can become extremely busy on weekday evenings and, if convenient, it is worth walking to other Tube stations.\n\nOxford Circus station â€“ Bond Street station: Head west along Oxford Street from the road junction. You should see the London College of Fashion and BHS. Keep walking west and you will come to Bond Street station. Approximate walking time: 10 minutes.\n\nOxford Circus station â€“ Tottenham Court Road station: At the road junction, head east along Oxford Street heading past Topshop. Keep walking past H&M and McDonald's and you will eventually see a skyscraper called Centre Point. Continue heading straight and Tottenham Court Road station is on the road junction here. Approximate walking time: 25 minutes.\n\nOxford Circus â€“ Piccadilly Circus station: At the road junction, head south along Regent Street to pass many big name brands, including Apple and Hamleys. Just after the road curves round to the left, you should be at Piccadilly Circus. Approximate walking time: 10 minutes.\n\nBy bicycle\n\nCycling in the United Kingdom\n\nCycling on the pavement (sidewalk) is illegal, except where a cycle route has been designated by signs or painted lines.\n\nWhen cycling on roads, you must ride on the left with other vehicles.\n\nYou must have working front and rear lights during hours of darkness. Flashing LED lights are legal. Reflective clothing is always a good idea at night.\n\nHelmets are not compulsory for cyclists in the United Kingdom, and their effectiveness is as much a matter of debate here as anywhere else. In London, many cyclists, especially those seen in rush hour, also wear filter masks, but their efficacy is even more disputed.\n\nIt is illegal to jump through a red light for cyclists as well as motorists. Advance stop lines at traffic lights allow cyclists to wait ahead of other traffic at red lights. In practice, most car drivers ignore this and occupy the cycle space when waiting at lights.\n\nWhen approaching a zebra crossing you should always take care and watch for pedestrians waiting to cross the road. You must be prepared to slow down or stop to allow them to cross as detailed in Rule 195 of the Highway Code. If someone is on a crossing already, you must stop as a car or other vehicle would and allow them to cross safely - weaving around pedestrians may frighten them and lead to an accident!\n\nThe rules for cyclists are available in the British Government publication The Highway Code\n\nDue to the expense of other forms of transport and the compactness of central London, cycling is a tempting option. Free cycle maps can usually be obtained from your local Tube station or bike shop.\n\nMost major roads in London will have a bus lane which is restricted to buses, taxis and bicycles. There are also many signposted cycle routes and cycle lanes, but the kind of contiguous cycle lane network found in many other European cities does not exist. The safest option is to stick to minor residential roads where traffic can be surprisingly calm outside rush hours.\n\nCritical Mass London is a cycling advocacy group which meets for regular rides through central London at 6PM on the last Friday of each month. Rides start from the southern end of Waterloo Bridge. The London Cycling Campaign is an advocacy group for London cyclists. With active local groups in most of the city's boroughs, it is recognised by local and regional government as the leading voice for cycling in the capital.\n\nNormally a cyclist should keep to the left of the lane when cycling on a road with traffic, to allow faster-moving traffic to overtake. However, it is legal for a cycle to dominate a lane by maintaining a central road position like any other vehicle. This will make you unpopular with any traffic behind you but it is recommended in London on approach to right-hand turns at junctions. Making a right-hand turn from the normal left-position means crossing the lane of traffic, which may often ignore you and any turn signals you might have been using, leading to potential accidents.\n\nTaking bikes on trains\n\nPermission to take bikes on trains is very limited in London due to overcrowding. Non-folding bikes can be taken only on limited sections of the Tube network, mostly only on the above-ground sections outside peak hours. For this reason, folding bicycles are becoming increasingly popular. Most National Rail operators allow bicycles outside peak hours.\n\nBicycle hire\n\nLondon offers a bicycle hire scheme known as Santander Cycles, operated by Transport for London. They are colloquially referred to as \"Boris Bikes\" after Boris Johnson, as they were introduced during his period as mayor of London. Docking stations can be found across Central London and slightly further out into areas such as Brixton, the Docklands, Hammersmith, and the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\n\nThe bikes, all coloured a distinctive red, can be unlocked at any hire dock and then ridden to wherever you want. After each journey the bike must be returned to a docking station on the network by locking the bike into the rack and receiving confirmation via a green light.\n\nYou pay via a credit or debit card and two payment plans exist: daily and yearly. A Â£2 daily plan (as of October 2020) gives access to the system for an unlimited number of rides for 24 hours. A fee for the first 30 minutes of each ride is included in the initial payment. For every other 30 minutes above that it costs extra Â£2. A yearly plan costs Â£90 for a full year.\n\nThe Santander Cycles app shows where bikes are available and can be used to make the hiring process faster, although sometimes the app doesn't show a journey as finished even if the bike was successfully docked back at a station. If in doubt it's better to check your activity log on the official site.\n\nThe Santander bikes' main competitor is Lime, whose fleet of electric bikes can be parked almost anywhere in much of Inner London, not just at docking stations. Download the app and set up a payment method first, then use your phone to scan a bike and unlock it. Rides are Â£1 plus Â£0.15 per minute (February 2021).\n\nCycle ways\n\nCycle lanes provide on-road and off -road routes. The network is not comprehensive, and on the road lanes vary in quality and size (normally 1-2 m wide). Some are indicated just with a stencilled image of a bike on the road. If the line between the traffic lane and cycle lane is solid, then vehicles may sometimes enter the space. A dashed line indicates a recommended cycle lane and motorists may make use of this road space, but it's recommended that they don't.\n\nLondon's cycleways connect destinations across the capital, and include \"cycle superhighways\" and \"quietways\". Cycle Superhighways run into central London from outer London and across the capital. They are designed to provide safe, fast routes for cyclists who commute and are painted blue to indicate where they are. Some are segregated from the road but some may be on the main carriageway. Quietways link key destinations in the capital but utilise side streets, waterways and parks instead of busy roads.\n\nThe towpaths in north London along the Grand Union Canal and Regent's Canal, and in London's parks and other green areas, provide a traffic-free cycle path through the capital. The Grand Union canal connects Paddington to Camden and the Regent's Canal connects Camden to Islington, Mile End and Limehouse in east London. It takes about 30-40 minutes to cycle from Paddington station to Islington along the towpaths. Pedestrians have priority on towpaths - slow down and respect their right of the way!\n\nBy taxi\n\nLondon has two types of taxis: the famous black cab, and so-called minicabs. Black cabs are the only ones licensed to \"ply for hire\" (i.e. pick people up off the street), while minicabs are more accurately described as \"private hire vehicles\" and need to be pre-booked.\n\nThe famous black cab of London (not always black!) can be hailed from the kerb or found at one of the many designated taxi ranks. It is possible to book black cabs by phone, for a fee, but if you are in central London it will usually be quicker to hail one from the street. Their amber TAXI light will be on if they are available. Drivers must pass a rigorous exam of central London's streets, known as 'The Knowledge', to be licensed to drive a black cab. This means they can supposedly navigate you to almost any London street without reference to a map. They are a cheap transport option if there are five passengers as they do not charge extras, and many view them as an essential experience for any visitor to London. Black cabs charge by distance and by the minute, are non-smoking, and have a minimum charge of Â£3.00 (as of 2019). Tipping is not mandatory in either taxis or minicabs, despite some drivers' expectations - use your discretion. If you like the service you may tip. If the ride has been uncomfortable or unsafe, or if the driver was rude, don't. Most Londoners will simply round up to the nearest pound.\n\nTaxis are required by law to take you wherever you choose (within Greater London) if their TAXI light is on when you hail them. However some, especially older drivers, dislike leaving the centre of town, or going south of the River Thames. A good way to combat being left at the side of the curb is to open the back door, or even get into the cab, before stating your destination.\n\nMinicabs are normal cars which are licensed hire vehicles that you need to book by phone or at a minicab office. They generally charge a fixed fare for a journey, best agreed before you get in the car. Minicabs are usually cheaper than black cabs, although this is not necessarily the case for short journeys. Licensed minicabs display a Transport For London (TfL) Licence - usually in the front window. One of the features of the license plate is a blue version of the famous London Transport \"roundel\". A list of licensed minicab operators can be found at TfL Cabwise.\n\nTfL operate a service called Cabwise, which will determine your location and provide three local, licensed cab numbers. If you have an iPhone or an Android smartphone, you can use the Cabwise application (search your platform's app store) or text CAB to 60835 (be careful - this might not work from some phones!) You can also use an app such as mytaxi[dead link] , which allows you to summon a black cab to your location and will provide a map and approximate wait time for your taxi to arrive. Most railway stations will also be able to provide a list of good local cab firms (many will display this outside the station, even after the last train of the night has gone.)\n\nSome areas in London are poorly served by black cabs, particularly late at night. This has led to illegal minicabs operating, who are just opportunistic people with a car, looking to make some \"fast\" money. Some of these illegal operators can be fairly aggressive in their attempts to find customers, and it's now barely possible to walk late at night through any part of London with a modicum of night-life without being approached. If you've booked a \"licensed\" minicab to collect you from a venue, the driver or operator should be able to give you additional details, (an example being the phone-number you booked them from), to confirm they are legitimate.\n\nYou should avoid minicabs touting for business off the street and either take a black cab, book a licensed minicab by telephone, or take a night bus. Not only is it 'illegal' for unlicensed minicabs to ply for trade on the street, these illegal cabs are also regularly unsafe, with a risk of robbery or assault a possibility, given that the operators of such illegal minicabs are in no way checked or vetted for past offences.\n\nAlways remember: if it's not licensed and it's not pre-booked, it's just a stranger's car. Never get into an un-booked minicab.\n\nUber is available in London and generally charge cheaper fares than black cabs, although higher \"surge\" prices are charged at times of high demand. Vehicles can only be booked via the smartphone app.\n\nBy car\n\nLondoners who drive will normally take public transport in the centre; follow their example. Unless you have a disability, there is no good reason whatsoever to drive a car in central London. Driving in central London is a slow, frustrating, expensive and often unnecessary activity. There are many sorts of automatic enforcement cameras and it is difficult and expensive to park.\n\nDriving outside of central London is easier, but traffic can still be an issue and most tourists won't head out that far unless they have a reason.\n\nFor those with disabilities driving can be much more convenient than using public transport. If disabled and a resident of a member state of the EU then two cars can be permanently registered, for free, for the Congestion Charge.\n\nThere's a speed limit of 20 mph (32 km/h) on most roads inside the Central London Congestion Charge zone, and several boroughs have borough-wide 20 limits. Limits elsewhere follow UK norms; see Driving in the United Kingdom#Speed limits for details.\n\nCongestion Charge\n\nDriving into central London on weekdays during daylight hours incurs a hefty charge called the Congestion Charge with very few exemptions. Rental cars also attract the charge. Cameras and mobile units record and identify the number plates and registration details of all vehicles entering the charging zone with high accuracy. The Central London Congestion Charge M-F 7AM-6PM (excluding public holidays) attracts a fee of Â£15. Numerous payment options exist: by phone, online, at convenience stores displaying the red 'C' logo in the window, and by voucher. Failure to pay the charge by midnight the next charging day incurs a hefty automatic fine of Â£160 (Â£80 if paid within 2 weeks). There are additional charges and penalties for vehicles not meeting certain emissions standards.\n\nTraffic\n\nDespite the Congestion Charge, London - like most major cities - continues to experience traffic snarls. These are, of course, worse on weekdays during peak commuting hours (i.e. :30-9:30AM and 4-7PM). At these times public transport (and especially the Tube) usually offers the best alternative for speed and reduced hassle.\n\nParking\n\nOne good tip is, that outside advertised restricted hours (usually on a Sunday), parking on a single yellow line is permissible. Parking on a red line or a double yellow line is never permissible and heavily enforced. Find and read the parking restrictions carefully! Parking during weekdays and on Saturday can also mean considerable expense in parking fees (fees and restrictions are ignored at your extreme financial peril). Issuing fines, clamping and/or towing vehicles (without warning!) has become a veritable new industry for borough councils staffed by armies of traffic wardens.\n\nAlso watch out for marked parking bays as these always have restrictions. Many are \"Resident Parking Only\" between certain hours and you will be fined if you park during these hours without a permit. Some bays also have restrictions on how long you can park in them for and these can be confusing. If in doubt: Don't park!\n\nIf you are driving to your destination then it's safest to find a dedicated private car park nearby. These may be eye-wateringly expensive, but parking on the roads is a lottery with low odds of you winning. Two large car park operators are NCP and Q-Park.\n\nMotorcycles and scooters\n\nMotorcycles and scooters are fairly common in London as they can pass stationary cars, can usually be parked for free, and are exempt from the Congestion Charge. Scooters and bikes with automatic transmission are much more preferable - a manually-geared racing bike is completely impractical unless you have excellent clutch control (although it has to be said you will see plenty of them being ridden aggressively by motorcycle couriers and locals as it can be the fastest way to get around!) Likewise to bicycles, car drivers can sometimes show disregard to anyone on two wheels and larger vehicles have an unwritten priority so take care when crossing junctions. Helmets are mandatory. Parking for bikes is usually free - there are designated motorcycle-parking areas on some side-streets and some multi-level car parks will have bike parking on the ground level.\n\nBy boat\n\nLondon is now promoting a network of river bus and pleasure cruise services along the River Thames from Hampton Court in the west to Woolwich Arsenal in the east. London River Services (part of Transport for London) manages regular commuter boats and a network of piers all along the river and publishes timetables and river maps similar to the famous Tube map. While boat travel may be slower and a little more expensive than Tube travel, it offers an extremely pleasant way to cross the city with unrivalled views of the London skyline. Sailing under Tower Bridge is an unforgettable experience.\n\nBoats are operated by private companies and they have a separate ticketing system from the rest of London transport; however if you have a Travelcard you get a 33% discount on most boat tickets. Many boat operators offer their own one-day ticket - ask at the pier kiosks. Generally, tickets from one boat company are not valid on other operators' services. Oyster cards can be used as payment for the 'Clipper'-styled commuter services but not for tour boats.\n\nAll the central London sights in Westminster and the South Bank tourist attractions are easily accessible by boat as are:\n\nHampton Court Palace\n\nGreenwich\n\nShakespeareâ€™s Globe\n\nTate Galleries\n\nLondon Dungeon\n\nLondon Eye\n\nTower of London\n\nTower Bridge\n\nSt. Katharine Docks\n\nMillennium Dome/The O2\n\nHam House\n\nKew Gardens\n\nHMS Belfast\n\nConsider a trip along an old Victorian canal through the leafy suburbs of North London. The London Waterbus Company runs scheduled services (more in summer, fewer in winter) from Little Venice to Camden Lock with a stop at the London Zoo (pick up only). The 45-minute trip along Regent's Canal is a delightful way to travel.\n\nBy skate\n\nInline skating on roads and pavements (sidewalks) is completely legal, except in the \"square-mile\" of the City of London. Roads are not the greatest but easily skateable. Central London drivers are more used to skaters than those in the outskirts.\n\nBy cable car\n\nThe London cable car (branded for sponsorship reasons as IFS Cloud Cable Car; formerly Emirates Air Line) is a cable car that runs across the River Thames in east London giving panoramic views of the surrounding area and beyond. It connects the Greenwich Peninsula on the south bank (near The O2) and the Royal Docks on the north bank (near the ExCeL Exhibition Centre), with the Greenwich Peninsula terminal connecting to North Greenwich Tube station on the Jubilee line and the Royal Docks terminal connecting to Royal Victoria DLR station.\n\nAlthough it is part of the TfL network and uses Oyster cards, the London cable car is mostly a tourist attraction and is therefore at its quietest during the week. It tends to be busiest when there is a large event at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre or a popular concert at The O2.\n\nThe cable car service sometimes finishes earlier than the Tube and DLR. If you are travelling to The O2 for an event that finishes late, you should have an alternative means in mind for getting back across the river.\n\nOperating hours\n\nDay2 October to 31 March1 April to 30 June1 July to 1 October Monday to Thursday07:00-21:0007:00-22:0007:00-23:00 Friday07:00-23:0007:00-23:0007:00-23:00 Saturday and Bank Holidays08:00-23:0008:00-23:0008:00-23:00 Sunday09:00-21:0009:00-22:0009:00-23:00\n\nEat\n\nFor suggestions of specific restaurants have a look into the district articles.\n\nThis page uses the following price ranges for a typical meal for one, including soft drink: BudgetBelow Â£15 Mid-rangeÂ£15-50 SplurgeÂ£50+\n\nIt is a huge task for a visitor to find the \"right place\" to eat in London - with the \"right atmosphere\", at the \"right price\" - largely because, as in any big city, there are literally thousands of venues from which to choose, ranging from fast food joints, pubs, and mainstream chains all the way up to some of the most exclusive restaurants in the world which attract the kind of clientele that don't need to ask the price. Sorting the good from the bad isn't easy, but London has something to accommodate all budgets and tastes. As London is one of the world's most multicultural cities, it is possible to find virtually every cuisine from around the world here if you look hard enough.\n\nFollowing is a rough guide to what you might get, should you fancy eating out:\n\nUp to Â£6 - you can get a good English pub or cafeteria breakfast with a rack of bacon, beans in tomato sauce, egg, sausage, orange juice and coffee or tea. Most pubs stop this offer at 11AM, but there are literally hundreds of backstreet cafes (colloquially known as \"greasy spoons\") which will serve this sort of food all day. Most supermarket chains offer a \"meal deal\", consisting of a sandwich, a drink and a bag of crisps or fruit for Â£3-4 together, while buying the sandwich only can be the same price. If you are going to be on a budget for several days, the supermarkets are a good option.\n\nÂ£8 - will buy you a couple of sandwiches and a soft drink, some takeaway fish and chips, or a fast food meal. There are also mostly Chinese restaurants which serve an all-you-can-eat buffet for around this price. These are dotted about the West End and it is well worth asking a member of public or a shopkeeper where the nearest one is. These restaurants make much of their revenue on drinks although these are usually still moderately priced. The food while not being of the finest standard is usually very tasty and the range of dishes available is excellent. There are literally thousands of so-called takeaways in London and are a cheap alternative to a restaurant meal. Check with your hotel management if they allow food deliveries before ordering in. Most takeaways offer some form of seating, but this is usually very limited.\n\nÂ£6-10 - will get you a good pub meal and drink or a good Chinese/Indian/Italian/Thai/Vietnamese buffet. Many pubs have a buy-one-get-one-free offer, and you can either order two main dishes for yourself or bring a friend.\n\nÂ£15 - some more expensive French, Mediterranean and international restaurants do cheaper two or three course lunch menus.\n\nÂ£25 - offers you a lot more choice. You can have a good meal, half a bottle of wine and change for the tube home. There are plenty of modest restaurants that cater for this bracket.\n\nÂ£50 (to almost any amount!) - with more money to spend you can pick some of the city's finer restaurants. It may be a famous chef (like Michel Roux, Jr, or Gordon Ramsay) or simply a place that prides itself on using the finest ingredients. Worth the splurge to impress a special someone. These establishments often need to be booked well in advance, and most will enforce a dress code of some sort, like Rules of Covent Garden, the oldest restaurant still extant.\n\nPrices inevitably become inflated at venues closest to major tourist attractions - beware the so-called tourist traps. The worst tourist trap food, in the opinion of many Londoners, is served at the various steak houses (Angus Steak House, Aberdeen Steak House, etc. - they are all dotted around the West End and near the main train stations). Londoners wouldn't dream of eating here - you shouldn't either! Notorious areas for inflated menu prices trading on travellers' gullibility and lack of knowledge are the streets around the British Museum, Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus. Even the major fast food chains charge a premium in their West End outlets - so watch out.\n\nPubs in the touristy areas of London are usually a poor choice for food although there are some brilliant \"gastro-pubs\" hidden away. In general, avoid all pubs that have graphic-designed and printed menus. Look around you - see any locals tucking in? No? - then you shouldn't either. The other rule to follow when avoiding poor food is the same as in any other part of Europe - is the menu available in multiple languages? If yes then start running!\n\nIn the suburbs, the cost of eating out is reduced drastically. Particularly in large ethnic communities, there is a competitive market which stands to benefit the consumer. In East London for example, the vast number of chicken shops means that a deal for 2 pieces of chicken, chips (fries) and a drink shouldn't cost you more than Â£3 especially on Brick Lane. Brick Lane is also known for being home to London's version of the beigel (spelt \"bagel\" in the United States and Canada, but pronounced the same way), with Brick Lane Beigel Bake and Britain's First & Best Beigel Shop being among the sole remnants of what was once a thriving Jewish community in the neighbourhood. Both shops are also known for their salt beef, London's version of Jewish-style cured meats, and a popular filling in their beigel sandwiches. Another good (and cheap) lunch option is a chicken or lamb doner (gyro) at many outlets throughout the city, though meat quality is often poor.\n\nFor more authentic Cockney food, try pie and mash, which originates from the working-class in the East End. Usually minced beef and cold water pastry pie served with mashed potato, mushy peas and \"liquor\" gravy, it tastes a lot better than it sounds. Some of the best pie houses are M. Manze in Peckham or F. Cooke in Hackney Broadway Market. Water Souchet and London Particular (green-pea and ham) are classic Cockney soups, though hard to find on menus. For those game, jellied eels, pickled-cockles and whelks are all traditional London seafood. It's people's experiences in these kind of places that gives Britain a bad name for food!\n\nThe South Bank's Borough Market offers wholesale produce as well as individual stalls that sell small bites and drinks for a casual and cheap meal. Kappacasein Dairy has a popular stand in the market famous for their grilled cheese which has earned the praise of Giada De Laurentiis and Ruth Reichl.\n\nOf course, the quintessential British dish fish and chips is widely available in London, but the standards can be pretty disappointing in the tourist trap pubs. The best-rated fish and chips shops in London are generally located in the suburbs, away from all the tourist fare in central London.\n\nFor hamburgers, local chain Burger & Lobster is an excellent choice for gourmet burgers.\n\nTipping may also be different than what you're used to. All meals include the 20% VAT tax and some places include a service fee (10-12%). The general rule is to leave a tip for table service, unless there's already a service charge added or unless the service has been notably poor. The amount tipped is generally in the region of 10%, but if there's a figure between 10-15% which would leave the bill at a conveniently round total, many would consider it polite to tip this amount. Tipping for counter service, or any other form of service, is unusual - but some choose to do so if a tips container is provided.\n\nRestaurant streets\n\nWhile central London is full of restaurants and cafes, there are some areas where the majority of diners are Londoners, rather than tourists, and in general you will get a much more pleasant, better value, and less crowded eating experience than you will find in the West End. These places are best visited in the evenings.\n\nClapham Junction is not just a train station, but also home to many good restaurants and bars, in particular on Lavender Hill and Battersea Rise. (Overground: Clapham Junction)\n\nDrummond Street in the Euston area has a fine mix of Indian restaurants - a short walk from Euston railway station. (Tube: Euston)\n\nHigh Street Croydon Croydon is derided by most Londoners, however this suburban gem of a road has at least 30 decent restaurants, including three Argentinians, a South African curryhouse, a couple of fancy modern European brassieres, and just about every other type of cuisine you can think of. (Overground: East Croydon)\n\nKings Street extends on to Chiswick High Road from Hammersmith Tube Station and is one long road of a choice of restaurants at very reasonable prices, some bargain mentions are the Thai restaurants offering two course lunch for Â£7. Nearby Shepherds bush is about a 15 minute walk and is alive with bars and pubs in the evening. (Tube: Hammersmith)\n\nLordship Lane in East Dulwich provides a good selection of European restaurants and a few award winning gastropubs. (train: East Dulwich)\n\nUpper Street in Islington has dozens of excellent restaurants, popular with young professionals. (Tube: Highbury & Islington, Angel).\n\nWardour Street, in Soho, is full of nice cafes and restaurants. (Tube: Piccadilly Circus)\n\nRestaurant areas\n\nAs one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities, you can find restaurants serving food cuisine from nearly every country, some of it as good as, if not better than in the countries of origin. Indian food in London is especially famous and there is hardly a district without at least one notable Indian restaurant. London also has excellent options for Chinese, in particular Cantonese food; local chain Royal China is an excellent option if you are looking for high-end fine dining dim sum.\n\nIf you are looking for other particular regional foods these tend to be clustered in certain areas and some examples are:\n\nBrick Lane in the East End is famous for Bangladeshi curries. (Overground: Shoreditch High Street)\n\nBrixton for African/Caribbean. (Tube: Brixton)\n\nChinatown just off Leicester Square for Chinese. (Tube: Leicester Square)\n\nEdgware Road in Marylebone and Paddington is popular for Middle Eastern cuisine. (Tube: Edgware Road, Paddington)\n\nDrummond Street (just behind Euston railway station in the London/Camden district) has lots of vegetarian restaurants - mostly Indian. (Tube: Euston)\n\nFinsbury Park and Green Lanes, for Greek, Turkish, and Cypriot. (Tube: Finsbury Park/Manor House; Overground: Harringay Green Lanes)\n\nGolders Green for Jewish fare. (Tube: Golders Green)\n\nKingsland Road for good cheap Vietnamese.\n\nTooting, East Ham, Wembley and Southall for authentic and cheap Indian eateries including South Indian restaurants serving hot pongal, dosas, idlis and other South Indian \"tiffin\" items.\n\nBayswater for Chinese, including the famous Four Seasons roast duck. (Tube: Bayswater, Queensway)\n\nLambeth between the South Bank and Brixton for Portuguese, Brazilian and diverse Latin American restaurants. (Tube: Kennington, Stockwell, Vauxhall)\n\nOther nationalities are equally represented and randomly dotted all over London. It is usually wisest to eat in restaurants on main thoroughfares rather than on quiet backstreets.\n\nFast food and chains\n\nLike other capitals in the world, London has the usual array of fast food outlets. Sandwich shops are the most popular places to buy lunch, and there are a lot of places to choose from including the ubiquitous Pret a Manger. Some Italian-style sandwich shops have a very good reputation and you can identify them easily by looking at the long queues at lunchtime. If all else fails, central London has lots of mini-supermarkets operated by the big British supermarket chains (e.g., Sainsbury's, Tesco) where you can pick up a pre-packed sandwich.\n\nFast food with an Asian flair is easy to find throughout the city, with lots of Busaba Eathai, Wagamama, and Yo! Sushi locations throughout the city. Nando's, a popular pseudo-Portuguese restaurant chain, has spicy peri-peri style grilled chicken. For burgers, GBK (Gourmet Burger Kitchen) has been joined by other franchises such as Byron and HachÃ©.\n\nVegetarian and vegan\n\nLondon has plenty of vegetarian and vegan restaurants many of them championing organic foodstuffs, and a quick search in Google will produce plenty of ideas, so you never have to see a piece of cooked meat all week. Hackney, Dalston, Islington, Soho, Peckham and Brixton are particular vegan hotspots.\n\nIf you are dining with carnivorous friends most restaurants will cater for vegetarians and will have at least a couple of dishes on the menu. Indian/Bangladeshi restaurants are generally fruitful, as they have plenty of traditional dishes. Good Indian/Bangladeshi options can be found in the Brick Lane area of Spitalfields or further afield in East Ham, Tooting Broadway, and Southall. These also tend to be very cheap eats with authentically prepared dishes with a true local ambience. There are also many vegetarian Thai buffet places where you can eat fake meat in tooth-achingly sweet sauces for under Â£5. These can be found on Greek Street and Old Compton Street in Soho and Islington High Street.\n\nMildred's is a great veggie chain with a handful of locations around London. If you're interested in vegan versions of classic British dishes, try \"fish\" and chips from Sutton and Sons in Hackney, and various cafes offer veggie interpretations of a full English breakfast.\n\nReligious\n\nDue to the mix of cultures and religions, many London restaurants cater well for religious dietary requirements. The most common signs are for Halal and Kosher meat, from burger joints to nice restaurants. There are lots of Halal restaurants and shops all over London including Whitechapel Rd and Brick Lane in the East End, Bayswater, Edgware Rd and Paddington and in many parts of north London. There are plenty of Kosher restaurants in Golders Green, Edgware and Stamford Hill along with some central delis such as on Charing Cross Road.\n\nConvenience stores and supermarkets\n\nConvenience stores such as Tesco Metro, Sainsbury's Central/Local, Budgens, Costcutter, SPAR, Co-op, and privately-run \"corner shops\" will sell pre-made sandwiches, snacks, alcohol, cigarettes, drinks, etc. Most are open from 5AM-11PM although some, such as Tesco Metro or convenience stores located at petrol stations, may open 24 hours (some will stop selling alcohol after a certain time). Whistlestop convenience stores, usually found in or around train stations, are notoriously overpriced and should be avoided.\n\nIf using a petrol station convenience store late at night (i.e. after 11PM) the store will be locked and you should order and pay through the external service window.\n\nSupermarkets\n\nAlthough Tesco, Sainsbury's and other supermarkets run smaller stores in central London, full-size superstores, including Morrisons and ASDA, are rare in the city centre - with the exception of the Sainsbury's in Pimlico - and you will usually have to take a 15- to 20-minute Tube ride to reach one.\n\nMarks & Spencer, an upmarket retailer, also operate food halls branded as \"Simply Food\". They can be found across central London. The smaller stores, such as those found in train stations, tend to focus mostly on ready-to-eat food such as sandwiches, drinks, snacks, and also essentials such as bread and milk.\n\nDrink\n\nLondon is home to a great many pubs, bars and nightclubs. The online city guide View London and the weekly magazine Time Out tell what's going in London's night life, as well as cultural events in general.\n\nPubs and bars\n\nLondon is an expensive place and your drink will cost more than its equivalent elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Expect to pay Â£6-7 for a pint of lager or Guinness in an average pub. As with restaurants, pubs close to major tourist attractions cash in on travellers' gullibility so be on your guard for the tourist traps where higher prices are not unheard of. If you're looking to save money and meet travellers then pub crawls are guided tours that run nightly in central London. You'll save the ticket price on the savings you get from discounted drink deals and what you would have spent on club entry. The \"1 Big Night Out\" pub crawl is the biggest operator and starts from near Leicester Square Tube station.\n\nMany local pubs, especially those run by chains like Wetherspoons and Scream, tend to be more reasonably priced with good drink promotions on weekday nights and during the day. As with the rest of the UK, chain pubs abound which Londoners tend to avoid like the plague. A good place to get cheap beer is at any one of the Sam Smith pubs found across Central London, including Soho and the City.\n\nIn the Bloomsbury area, check out The Court (near the north end of Tottenham Court Road) and The Rocket (Euston Road). Both are fairly cheap, given that they cater for students of the adjacent University College London. Directly opposite the British Library is The Euston Flyer, popular with locals and commuters alike given its close proximity to St Pancras International railway station.\n\nClassier bars and pubs can be much more expensive. However, the cost of alcohol drops significantly the further away you go from the centre (West London tends to be an exception, with prices pretty much the same as the centre). For a more reasonably priced (but brilliant) cocktail bar than you'll find in the central and West End areas Lost Society in Clapham on Lavender Hill, cocktails here cost around Â£7-8 each.\n\nTwo historic London breweries are Young's and Fullers. Young's was founded in Wandsworth in 1831 (but has relocated to Bedford) and nowadays it has 123 pubs in central London alone. The Founder's Arms next to the Tate Modern on the river embankment, is one of the brewery's most well-known establishments with a great view of the River Thames. Fullers was founded a bit later in 1845 at Chiswick (where you can take a most enjoyable tour of the brewery, including beer-tasting) and the jewel in its crown is probably the Grade I listed Old Bank Of England on Fleet Street, thanks to its breath-taking interiors. Fuller's flagship beer is the famous 'London Pride', however to try a truly authentic Cockney pint, ask at bars if they serve a seldom seen now porter, a dark style of beer originating in London in the 18th century, similar but less heavy than a stout. For a different taste, try a gin and tonic.\n\nIt's hard to say which pub in London is truly the oldest but it's easy to find contenders for the title. Many pubs were destroyed in the Great Fire of London â€“ indeed, Samuel Pepys supposedly watched the disaster from the comfort of the Anchor in Borough. Pubs were rebuilt on sites that claimed to have been working pubs since the 13th century. Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese in Fleet Street is on the site of an old monastery and its cellar dates back to the 13th century. The Princess Louise and Cittie of Yorke are two lovely pubs close by along High Holborn with interesting decor; as is the Jerusalem Tavern of Farringdon, a converted Georgian coffee shop, which sells the Norfolk beer, St. Peters. The Royal Oak of Borough, is another pub which is the only representative of an out-of-town brewery in London, that of Harvey's of Lewes. The food is fantastic as is the atmosphere. Those interested in London's historic and literary connections can't miss The Spaniard's Inn in Hampstead. Dick Turpin is said to have been born here; John Keats and Charles Dickens both drank here; it's mentioned in Dickens' The Pickwick Papers and Bram Stoker's Dracula. The Goose at Catford, was reputedly a favourite hole of Karl Marx.\n\nFor the best view in the city, try pubs on the banks of the Thames. The South Bank has lots of good bars with views of iconic bridges and buildings. One lesser-known cocktail bar sits in the OXO Tower, which is a secret that most tourists walk by every day. Heading towards Bermondsey, pub crowds become a little less touristy. For something historic try the Prospect of Whitby' in Wapping which has been on its site since 1520 and claims to be the worldâ€™s oldest riverside tavern.\n\nIf you're after gastropubs, you may like to visit London's first, The Eagle, in Clerkenwell, established in 1991. You can also try Time Out's favourite newcomer, The Princess Victoria on Uxbridge Road, Shepherd's Bush.\n\nThe \"Bermondsey Beer mile\" is home to many craft breweries which are open in the middle of the day most Saturdays. Situated under the railway arches on lines going to London Bridge, these quaint breweries are home to high quality beer at cheap to average London prices (~Â£2 per half). Best places include Kernel Brewery and Brew by Numbers.\n\nWine buffs can enjoy the famous Davys wine bars that dot the city. The company, established in 1870, import wines and own over thirty bars in the centre. Other big names in wine include the Michelin-starred Cellar Gascon and Vinoteca, both in Smithfield. For a posh wine tasting experience, there is Vinopolis by Borough Market, though a tour price will be as eye-watering as the produce sampled.\n\nBig hotels, such as The Langham, The Dorchester and The Ritz, and upmarket clubs around Leicester Square and Soho are reliable bets for a date at the bar. The Connaught Hotel in Mayfair-Marylebone boasts its house bar, plus the Time Out magazine favourite, The Coburg. Still in Mayfair, The Polo Bar at The Westbury is very intimate.\n\nYou can rely on most up-and-running bars to offer a short cocktail menu and there are also bars that position themselves as cocktail specialists.\n\nNightclubs\n\nNightlife is an integral part of London life and there are countless nightclubs in and around Central London with music to suit even the most eclectic of tastes. Districts in London tend to specialize in different types of music.\n\nThe Farringdon/Hoxton/Shoreditch area has many clubs playing drum and bass, techno, house and trance music and is home to the superclub Fabric. The clubs in this area are often home to the world's top DJs and attract a lively, hip and friendly crowd. Big name drum and bass, house and techno DJs also appear at clubs scattered around Kings Cross (Egg, Scala), Elephant (Ministry of Sound, Corsica Studios), Southwark (Cable), Whitechapel (Rhythm Factory), or at mixed nights at the Vauxhall clubs. Nights are also hosted in disused Hackney warehouses or south London car parks.\n\nThe area around Mayfair is home to the more upmarket clubs in London. This area attracts a rather more showy crowd who love to flaunt what they have and is a must go to celebrity spot. Beware that drinks are ridiculously expensive and many clubs operate a guestlist-only policy. Music played here is often of the commercial chart, funky house, hip hop and R&B genre. Notable clubs include China White, Luxx, Maddox, Jalouse, Funky Buddha, Whisky Mist, Mahiki, No 5 Cavendish Square, Embassy, Vendome and Maya.\n\nNightclubs around the Leicester Square area hold the same music policy, but are rather more accessible, with numerous club and pub crawl promoters scattered around the area offering deals on entry. Notable clubs are Cafe De Paris, 1 Big Night Out pub crawl, Penthouse, Sound, Tiger Tiger, Zoo bar and Ruby Blue.\n\nThe Camden area is home to clubs which play Indie, metal and rock music and notably the Electric Ballroom, the world-famous Koko (Fridays) and Underworld. Camden clubs are mostly shut (or empty) on the weekdays. In South London, London's Afro-Caribbean centre Brixton is home to numerous venues with all kinds of music, including a particular presence in reggae, ska, afrobeat, hiphop, and dubstep. There are also venues in Peckham and New Cross.\n\nGay and lesbian\n\nLondon has a vibrant gay environment with countless bars, clubs and events in almost every district in the city.\n\nThe nucleus of London's gay scene is undoubtedly Old Compton St and the surrounding area in Soho but over the last couple of years Vauxhall has seen a boom in Gay venues. You will find that many areas, particularly in Camden Town and Shoreditch, that straight bars will have a mixed clientele. To find out what is going on during your visit, you can check:\n\nGay Pride is held every year in June with a parade and street parties. The choice of places to go sometimes seems to be unmanageable.\n\nSleep\n\nThis guide uses the following price ranges for a standard double room: BudgetUnder Â£70 Mid-rangeÂ£70 to Â£140 SplurgeOver Â£140\n\nLondon has hundreds of options for accommodation to suit all budgets from hostels through historic bed and breakfasts (B&Bs), mainstream chain hotels and apartments all the way to some of the most exclusive luxury hotels in the world such as The Savoy, The Ritz and Claridges where a stay in a top suite will cost upwards of Â£1,000 per night. The average cost of hotel accommodation in London is higher than in any other major British city. Prices invariably become inflated close to major sporting tournaments (such as the London Marathon, Wimbledon or major England football/rugby fixtures), or other important events taking place in the city - so it pays to plan your trip around such occasions or book your accommodation well in advance.\n\nIn general, most people tend to stay within \"Zone 1\" of the underground, however do your research carefully - sometimes being that extra five minutes away from a station can make the differen"
