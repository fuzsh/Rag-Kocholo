        "text": "The city has a packed programme of events throughout the year, and this summer marks the start of the festival season with the Wickham festival returning from August 3 to 6, and the poetry festival taking place in October.\n\nSpeaking to Express.co.uk, Deryck Newland, Chief Executive of Play to the Crowd, the charity that runs Theatre Royal Winchester said: \"Winchester's arts offering is thriving. In the last few weeks we have presented, despite recent funding challenges, a free Outdoor Arts festival enjoyed by tens of thousands of audiences...For a city of its size Winchester really punches above its weight in terms of variety, diversity and sheer choice.\"\n\nWinchester City Councillor, Lucille Thompson, Cabinet Member for Business and Culture said: “Our residents can be rightly proud of the vibrant celebrations of culture that take place across Winchester - the festivals we attract to our historic city and district offer something for everyone, whether it's food, music, theatre, heritage, art or literature.\"\n\nShe added: “As well as entertaining those who live in Winchester, the festivals play a key role in attracting visitors from all over the country and beyond, which widens our well-earned reputation as a cultural destination and provides a welcome boost for our local economy.”"
