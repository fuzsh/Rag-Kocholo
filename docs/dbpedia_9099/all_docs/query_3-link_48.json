        "text": "Ah London. Our capital, and for many people around the world, a city of dreams.\n\nIt’s so well known that the globe has around 50 names for it according to the Londonist.\n\nHowever, what you might not know is that it’s not the only one. Other places liked the name so much they adopted too.\n\nHere are 11 others Londons you may not have known about.\n\nLondon in Burgundy, France\n\nIt turns out our closest neighbour has its own version of the British capital.\n\nLondon in Burgundy is a small village in France 50 miles south of Dijon and specialises in agriculture.\n\nIt shot into fame in 2012 when Paddy Power sponsored their egg and spoon race in am ambush marekting campaign. The move got the bookmaker into trouble with 2012 Olympic Games organisers as they proclaimed themselves as the ‘Official sponsor of the largest athletics event in London this year!’.\n\nLondon, Ontario\n\nClose in language. Close in city names.\n\nCanada’s London can be found in Southwestern Ontario with a population of 366,151. It has a pretty active tourism industry with a whole host of musical and artistic exhibits, and is also home to the University of Western Ontario.\n\nWhat’s more, it even has its own Thames River. What could be more London?\n\nLondon Island, Chile\n\nGoing a bit more remote: just off the coast of Chile are many islands, and London Island is one of them.\n\nIt can be found west of Tierra del Fuego, known for petrol extraction and Antarctic logistics.\n\nThere’s not much information nor photos of the island, but we imagine it’s probably as beautiful as this.\n\nLondon, Arkansas\n\nThe U.S sure does love to name places after our capital City. This is one of eight Londons you can find in America.\n\nThis particular London is home to around 1,044 according the most recent population data. 96.7 per cent of them are white.\n\nTrevor Drown, a Republican member of the Akansas House of Representatives, is a notable person from the area.\n\nNew London, Minnesota\n\nAnother city, but it’s not just London – it’s new.\n\nIt is most known as the start line for the New London to New Brighton Antique Car Run. Only old cars from 1908 and earlier can be drive on the 120-mile route.\n\nThe race runs every year in mid-August.\n\nLondon, California\n\nThis London has a very different demographic to the one in Arkansas.\n\nAccording to data from 2010, 92.9 per cent of residents are Hispanic.\n\nLondon, Ohio\n\nNo one really knows why people called this town London – some believe that many of the people there in the 1800s or earlier were from Britain. Others thinks it was named after the company that surveyed the land, the London Company.\n\nThere are plenty of fun things to do here, including a strawberry festival in June and the Madison County Fair in July.\n\nCould a place be more unlike the London we know?\n\nNot a city, a town or even a village, the unincorporated community of London was built up in the 1800s. It was named London after a post office was established in 1882.\n\nLondon, West Virginia\n\nAnother unincorporated community. It’s as industrial as it looks, being the home of London Locks and Dam built in 1933.\n\nLondon, Wisconsin\n\nAnother area that came to be named London as many of the earlier settlers were natives of the original city.\n\nIt is home to the Glacial Drumlin trail, a railway named after common glacial landforms in the area.\n\nLondon, Kiribati, Christmas Island\n\nAh finally, you’re thinking. A non-U.S London.\n\nIn fact it’s on the other side of the world near Australia.\n\nIt’s a principal settlement in the north of Christmas Island, known for its natural sights.\n\nMORE : 12 reasons Lincolnshire is the best place to live in the UK"
