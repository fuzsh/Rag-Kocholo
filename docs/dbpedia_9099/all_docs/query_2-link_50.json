        "text": "Wales is a country that forms part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (known as the UK). It is situated in the northwestern part of the continent of Europe.\n\nWales is one of the four countries that make up the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nWe are located on an island called Great Britain, which we share with Scotland and England.\n\nWales has its own devolved government and its own parliament (the Senedd), although some political decisions are still made by the UK Government, like matters of crime and policing, defence, and foreign affairs. People in Wales travel on British passports, like all citizens who live within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nFind out more about how Wales is governed.\n\nOfficial languages: Cymraeg (Welsh) and English\n\nPopulation: 3.1 million people (4.6% of the UK population)\n\nSize: 8,023 sq miles (20,779 sq km)\n\nTime zone: GMT\n\nCurrency: £ Pound Sterling\n\nNational Day: St David's Day (1 March)\n\nNational Anthem: Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land of my Fathers)\n\nHighest mountain: Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon), 1,085m (3,560ft)\n\nLongest place name:\n\nLlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch (known locally as Llanfair PG)\n\nClimate: The average temperature is 20°C (68°F) in summer and 6°C (43°F) in winter\n\nNational Parks: Three - Eryri (Snowdonia), Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons), Pembrokeshire Coast\n\nAreas of Outstanding National Beauty: Five (Anglesey, Gower, Wye Valley, Llŷn Peninsula and the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley)\n\nSites of special scientific interest (SSSI): There are over 1,000 SSSIs in Wales, covering 12% of the country. They form the basis for our network of protected nature conservation areas\n\nThere are seven cities in Wales: Bangor, Cardiff (our capital), Newport, St Davids, St Asaph, Swansea and Wrexham. St Davids is the UK's smallest city by population, and has been a popular pilgrimage destination for hundreds of years. Wrexham is the country's newest city, having been awarded city status as part of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022.\n\nWales is made up of 22 local authority areas, each with its own elected council, which makes decisions on local issues like housing, town planning and schools.\n\nThese local authority areas are grouped into four regions: North Wales, West Wales, Mid Wales, and South Wales - each with its own distinct geography and landscape.\n\nYes. Well, sort of. There are more than 600 castles in Wales. Some have been lived in continuously for a thousand years, some are romantic ruins, and others have disappeared, leaving almost no trace. Many are native Welsh castles, built by Welsh royal dynasties – often in very beautiful places.\n\nFind out more about Welsh castles."
