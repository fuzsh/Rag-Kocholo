        "text": "With Brexit, the British coronavirus variant, and the insignificant royal bickering, the British nation has been in the news a lot recently. It seems a lot of people are quite confused by the different names that are related to this iconic country across the pond, so let’s explain the difference between the United Kingdom, England, Great Britain, and the British Isles. No, they don’t mean the same thing at all.\n\nPeople often confuse these terms and, for example, say “England” when they’re actually talking about the “United Kingdom.” And we feel like those who love to travel and explore our world should love to learn more about our world too (we sure do!).\n\nSo let’s clear up this confusion, and the next time your travel across the Atlantic with our super-cheap Flytrippers flight deals, you will know exactly what each term actually means.\n\nThe UK, England, Great Britain, and British Isles\n\nHere’s a photo of an iconic spot in the UK, in England, in Great Britain, and in the British Isles… but all 4 terms are still very different.\n\nIn short, the United Kingdom and England are political terms:\n\nThe United Kingdom (UK) is the name of the country\n\nEngland is the name of the main part of the UK\n\nGreat Britain and the British Isles are geographic terms:\n\nGreat Britain is the name of the main island of the UK\n\nThe British Isles is the name for that whole group of islands\n\nIt’s pretty simple once you know it, after all!\n\nLondon is in England, which is a part of the country called the United Kingdom. This part is located on the island of Great Britain, which is one of the British Isles.\n\nIn other words, all of England is in the UK: England is a subdivision of the UK. But there are other parts of the UK that aren’t England.\n\nAnd Great Britain is the island where England and other parts of the UK are located. But there are other British Isles around Great Britain, some of which are part of the UK—but not all.\n\nLet’s look at each term in more detail.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nPolitically speaking, the UK is a sovereign country, comprised of 4 constituent countries.\n\nThe fact that these 4 are called countries instead of provinces or states might be what leads to confusion. These 4 are not independent countries: the UK is what we all know as a country. The UK is the one represented at the United Nations.\n\nHere are the 4 main subdivisions of the UK (and the island where they are located):\n\nEngland (Great Britain)\n\nScotland (Great Britain)\n\nWales (Great Britain)\n\nNorthern Ireland (Ireland)\n\nThe UK’s full name is actually the “United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.”\n\nAs that name suggests, the UK consists of the island of Great Britain and the northeastern part of the island of Ireland… but also other territories.\n\nYou might not know this, but the United Kingdom’s flag, the famous Union Jack, is actually a layering of the historic flags of Ireland, Scotland, and England (sorry, Wales).\n\nEach subdivision has some autonomy in its political matters, but all of them are bound to the Crown. However, each one retains its local identity and language.\n\nFor example, the official language of the UK, overall, is English, but Welsh is also an official language in Wales. And Scotland is so different that they held a referendum on independence in 2014 (and might succeed in the next one due to Brexit). Finally, Northern Ireland is also culturally pretty distinct from the 3 other parts of the UK since it is on a different island.\n\nEngland\n\nWhat most people think of when they think of “the UK” and “Great Britain” is indeed England.\n\nIt is the largest and most populous subdivision in the UK. London, the capital and major metropolis, is in England (as are the 3 other largest metropolitan areas in the UK: Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds-Bradford).\n\nIn fact, 84% of the UK’s population is in England (56 million out of 67 million total). For comparison, Canada’s most populous province has 38% of the country’s population (in the US, it’s just 12%).\n\nEngland is obviously the birthplace of the English language and is famous for its rich history, fine literature, Stonehenge, iconic architecture, infinite number of crowded pubs… and the myth of everlasting rainy weather.\n\nJust like many things in the world are very counterintuitive, London is not that rainy: did you know that most of Europe is factually rainier than London? True story. Even Miami is rainier than London.\n\nWe’ll have a post about this soon… but it’s a good reminder that just because you think something is true, that doesn’t mean the facts agree. It’s a good lesson that should already have been learned by all those who’ve explored the world and seen that what most people think of most places is not always accurate…\n\nGreat Britain\n\nGreat Britain (or just Britain) is a purely geographic term: it’s just the name of the largest European island, located in the North Atlantic Ocean, northwest of continental Europe.\n\nIt is the part of the United Kingdom consisting of England, Scotland, and Wales.\n\nWhat might lead to confusion is that the demonym for citizens of the UK is “British” because “United Kingdomers” doesn’t sound great. It’s not unlike how “Americans” is also derived from a geographic term that isn’t entirely accurate for the corresponding country.\n\nGreat Britain is just one of the British Isles (the largest one).\n\nThe British Isles\n\nThe British Isles is also a geographical term. It refers to the entire group of islands located in the northwestern part of Europe.\n\nThe archipelago consists of more than 6,000 islands, but the 2 main ones are:\n\nGreat Britain\n\nIreland\n\nWhile all of Great Britain is part of the UK, not all of the island of Ireland is part of the UK—only the northeastern part. The country of Ireland occupies the majority of the island of Ireland and is a sovereign nation that is completely independent of the UK.\n\nIn other words, on the island of Ireland (which is one of the British Isles), the northeastern part belongs to the United Kingdom (a country) but the southern part belongs to the Republic of Ireland (a different country).\n\nVenn diagram illustrating all 4 terms\n\nIf you like Venn diagrams, here is an interesting one with geographic terms in green and political terms in blue.\n\nWant to get more informative travel content like this sent to your inbox?\n\nYou can also read our post about the difference between the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China.\n\nSummary\n\nWhat is the difference between the United Kingdom, England, Great Britain, and the British Isles? Some are political terms while others are geographic terms. The sovereign country is the United Kingdom: England is just one part of the UK (albeit the main one). The group of islands where the UK is located is called the British Isles, and Great Britain is simply one of those islands (the biggest one).\n\nHave you confused these terms before?
