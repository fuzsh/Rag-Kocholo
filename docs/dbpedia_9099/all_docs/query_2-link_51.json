        "text": "Geography\n\nThe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is an island state in the west of Europe. It is separated from the mainland of continental Europe by the English Channel. The parts of England, Wales and Scotland are located on the main island of Great Britain. Northern Ireland takes up around one sixth of the island of Ireland. Ireland is also the only directly bordering neighboring country.\n\nThe United Kingdom has a total area of 243,610 kmÂ² and a total coastline of 12,429 km. This land mass corresponds to approximately 68% of the size of Germany. This makes it one of the largest countries in Europe and the 80th largest country in the world. An exceptionally high proportion of the population (84%) is urban. Around one in eight inhabitants lives in London alone. Large swathes of land in the north of the UK are sparsely populated. Only just over 13% of the population live in Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland has the lowest population share at less than 3% and England the highest at around 84%.\n\nThe United Kingdom is comparatively low lying at an average altitude of 162 meters above sea level. The highest mountain peak (Ben Nevis) is 1,345 meters above sea level. In addition to the main island, the country also includes around 1,000 other small islands, stretching from the Shetland Islands in the north to the Isles of Scilly in the English Channel."
