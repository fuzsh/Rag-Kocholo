The U.K. capital is home to 40% of the European Headquarters of the world’s top companies, more than any other European city, including 37% of the FT Global 500. London excels in industries including tech, finance, life sciences, and creative and is the place to capitalize on the exciting convergence between them.

Creative industries, tech, financial services, life sciences, business services, real estate, environment, clean-tech, manufacturing, oil and gas, transport, and logistics all make up the rich tapestry of the business world in London.\n\nTECH\n\nLondon, Europe’s fastest growing digital cluster, is home to more than 38,000 digital tech companies and 155,600 digital technology professionals. Small start-ups to large corporates thrive in London’s tech scene. The capital is also uniquely placed to leverage its traditional strengths to create new business opportunities, with the city being home to more fintech start-ups than anywhere else in Europe. In 2014, London tech companies landed more than $1.4bn of investment – double the previous full-year record of $719 million raised during 2013.\n\nFINANCIAL SERVICES\n\nLondon leads the world in financial services, with the expertise and the sectors that provide capital, investment and advice to businesses.\n\nLondon is the historical home of banking and investment.
