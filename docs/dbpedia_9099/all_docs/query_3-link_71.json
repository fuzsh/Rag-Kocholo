        "text": "The City of London (the Square Mile)\n\nThe City of London, also known as the Square Mile, is the financial district of London. It is the ancient core from which the rest of London developed. It has been a centre for settlement, trade, commerce and ceremony since the Roman period, producing a unique historic environment of exceptional richness and significance.\n\nOne of the reasons the Square Mile is unique, is the number of people who live, work and visit. In just 1.12 square miles, the City of London counts 8,600 residents, 614,500 workers and millions of domestic and international visitors. The City of London boundaries stretch from Temple to the Tower of London, on the River Thames including, from west to east Chancery Lane and Liverpool Street.\n\nCity of London boundaries\n\nThe City of London Corporation\n\nBased in Guildhall, the City Corporation looks after and promotes the City of London. It is headed by the Lord Mayor with the Court of Common Council being its main decision-making body. We are a uniquely diverse organisation, with a role that goes beyond that of an ordinary local authority. We have our own government (the oldest in the country with origins pre-dating Parliament), our own Lord Mayor and independent police force.\n\nAs the governing body of the Square Mile, we are dedicated to a vibrant and thriving City, supporting a diverse and sustainable London within a globally-successful UK. We aim to achieve and support the following objectives:\n\nDiverse Engaged Communities\n\nDynamic Economic Growth\n\nLeading Sustainable Environment\n\nVibrant Thriving Destination\n\nProviding Excellent Services\n\nFlourishing Public Spaces.\n\nOur reach extends far beyond the Square Mile’s boundaries and across private, public and voluntary sector responsibilities. This, along with our independent and non-party political voice and convening power, enables us to promote the interests of people and organisations across London and the UK and play a valued role on the world stage.\n\nFind out more about our vision in our Corporate Plan 2024-29.\n\nWhat we are responsible for\n\nWe provide local government services for residents and City workers based in the Square Mile, but not those of other boroughs. If you are unsure which borough you need to contact, find your local council will help you find the website for your local authority.\n\nHowever, our unique role means that our reach does extend beyond the City to include:\n\nMore than 11,000 acres of green spaces, including Hampstead Heath and Epping Forest\n\nBillingsgate, Smithfield and New Spitalfields wholesale food markets\n\nThe Heathrow Animal Reception Centre\n\nThe Barbican Estate and social housing estates in the Square Mile and six neighbouring boroughs\n\nA range of schools and academies\n\nWorking together with public, private and voluntary sectors to support economic, social and environmental wellbeing in the City and its surrounding boroughs\n\nAs trustee of City Bridge Foundation, the City Corporation is also responsible for five City bridges, including Tower Bridge\n\nAnd we are London’s Port Health Authority\n\nWe are also the principal funder of the Guildhall School of Music & Drama and the Barbican Centre.\n\nServices covering the whole Greater London area\n\nGreater London Authority\n\nTransport for London\n\nCongestion Charge"
