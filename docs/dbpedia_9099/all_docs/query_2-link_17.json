        "text": "United Kingdom Great Britain England The United Kingdom is a polity that encompasses the entire region of the British Isles with the exception of the Republic of Ireland The term ‘Great Britain’ is often used to include England, Scotland Wales and its adjoining islands England is one of the countries that is located in the southernmost part of the British Isle The term “United Kingdom” has occasionally been used as a description for the former kingdom of Great Britain from the 17th century onwards The term ‘Britain’ is derived from the Roman word ‘Britannia’. The word was extensively used by writers of classical antiquity to describe the British Isles following its conquest by the Roman Empire in 87 AD England is derived from the Old English name ‘ Englaland’ which means land of the Angles. The Angles were a Germanic tribe who settled in large numbers following the withdrawal of Roman forces in 410 AD The United Kingdom as a whole is the member of the Commonwealth of Nations, NATO and the United Nations amongst many other international bodies The term ‘Great’ was added into Britain during the rule of King James I in 1603 as a way to assert his rule over both the Kingdom of Wales and Scotland England is the largest country in the British Isles in terms of population and landmass. Its capital London is also the capital of the United Kingdom as a whole"
