        "text": "London has been a capital city for the better part of 1,000 years. In fact, it can be quite difficult to even imagine any other city in Britain holding the title of capital of the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter all, with close to 9 million people living in it, London is by far the largest and most populous city in the UK. Not even second-placed Birmingham comes close with its population of 1.1 million people.\n\nBut in its 1,976 years since being founded by the Romans, London has only been a capital for 956 years, gaining the status after the conquest of the British isles by Norman king William the Conqueror in 1066. Before that, London had existed for 1,119 years as nothing more than a regular city in Britain, or by today’s standards, an overgrown village.\n\nREAD MORE: UK capital could be moved from London due to risk of intense floods, says expert\n\nBefore London became the capital of England, several other cities had already had their turn serving as the country’s administrative headquarters. Colchester served as capital during the Roman era, while Anglo-Saxon King Alfred the Great named Winchester as his capital.\n\nFor a short time, during the reign of King Edward I between 1298 and 1304, York became the capital of England. Today, due to a number of reasons, some people have called for London to be stripped of its status once again in favour of another city in the UK.\n\nOne of those reasons is flooding. With global sea levels rising, climate experts have warned that large parts of London could be under water within the next few decades, or even as early as 2030. This could of course mean the government having to move its premises elsewhere, as well as the Royal Family (who already spend most of their time outside of London).\n\nIf only for the reason of it being the highest UK city above sea level, Sheffield could be a serious contender to take over as Britain’s capital after London. But any bid to replace London as capital would likely not go unchallenged.\n\nOwing to the fact that there are already other capital cities in the UK, namely Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast representing Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively, each of these cities might consider themselves natural heirs. No doubt the three other countries that make up the UK would rise to the opportunity to take over the leadership of the four nations from England for the first time in history.\n\nBut Birmingham’s voice will not go unheard. As the second most populous city in the country, it’s definitely in for a shout at glory. Meanwhile in Scotland, Glasgow might have a word to say about Edinburgh legitimacy as a contender, especially as it beats the Scottish capital in population figures.\n\nOn the other hand, Manchester is increasingly being viewed as the UK’s second city, more so than Birmingham. According to a YouGov poll conducted for Times Radio earlier this year, some 55 percent of people who supported moving the UK capital from London said they’d like to see Manchester take the title.\n\nEven Liverpool becoming the UK’s new capital had more support than Birmingham, with Liverpool getting 42 percent of the vote compared to Birmingham’s 39 percent. Leeds, meanwhile, was the fourth most popular choice for an alternative capital, with 37 percent.\n\nNewcastle followed with 36 percent, while Sheffield, Edinburgh, Nottingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Cardiff, Cambridge, Portsmouth and Belfast all also received votes. Mind you, if rising sea levels was the problem, Bristol would be in the same boat as London, as would Hull, experts have warned.\n\nAnother solution, as has been suggested by some, is to put the entire British government on some kind of mobile floating platform. In 2016, US-based architecture firm Gensler proposed that the Houses of Parliament be temporarily placed on the River Thames to allow refurbishment work to take place.\n\nThe platform wouldn’t necessarily need to be tied down to a fixed spot, and might even be able to float around the 7,723-mile UK coastline, allowing the capital to move around with it.\n\nHowever, there is one thing worth mentioning here. As the UK doesn’t have a constitution, there are no laws stating that London is even the official capital to begin with.\n\nWhat has traditionally made London the seat of power in the past 1,000 years is its status as a trade hub, and should that trade die down or pick up elsewhere, it is likely that everything that leads us to believe that London is actually the capital of the UK will change.\n\nGot a story you think we should be covering?
