        "text": "Hi there, I'm Earth.\n\nCome and take a look at one of my favourite places, the United Kingdom.\n\nIt's made up of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nThis is England, the biggest country in the United Kingdom.\n\nIts capital city is London.\n\nThis is the Tower of London, home of the Crown Jewels.\n\nThe north of England has many mountains and lakes, like Windermere, the largest lake in England.\n\nUp here is Scotland. It has lots of lakes. They call them lochs.\n\nThe most famous is Loch Ness. Legend says it's home to the Loch Ness monster.\n\nThe capital city of Scotland is Edinburgh, with its famous castle.\n\nWales's capital city is Cardiff.\n\nHere's Cardiff railway station. It was built to handle all the trains coming in and out of the city.\n\nAnd this is Snowdon, Wales's highest mountain.\n\nBeautiful, if I do say so myself!\n\nAcross the Irish Sea is Northern Ireland.\n\nIts capital city is Belfast.\n\nThis is the Titanic Museum, which tells the story of the famous ship.\n\nAnd this is the Giant's Causeway.\n\nLegend says it was built by a giant who wanted a shortcut between Northern Ireland and Scotland, but really it was formed when the lava from a volcano cooled and formed these columns.\n\nWith so many amazing places, I bet you can see why the United Kingdom is so special to me."
