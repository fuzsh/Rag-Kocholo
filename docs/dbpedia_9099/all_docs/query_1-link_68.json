        "text": "In London, everyone is different, and that means anyone can fit in.\n\nPaddington, who made the journey to London from Peru, certainly agrees with his foster mother, Mrs Brown. “Although I don't look like anyone else, I really do feel at home. I'll never be like other people, but that's alright, because I'm a bear.”\n\nBy the most recent statistics, London is one of the most ethnically diverse and multicultural cities in the world. It’s unmistakably evidenced through the nearly 200 cultural festivals that happen throughout the year and the almost 290 ethnic groups living in the UK capital.\n\n“There are 300 languages spoken in London,” explains Stephen Bach, the Executive Dean of King’s Business School. “If you're running the London Marathon, there will always be someone from your nationality cheering you on.”\n\nProfessor Bach finds himself working at the very heart of it all. Growing up in London as the son of a managing director of a foreign company, Stephen was exposed to a constant stream of visitors from different countries, instilling in him a respect for diverse cultures. “Being based in London, the political, business, and tech capital provides a unique advantage,” he continues, emphasizing the city’s role in shaping the community at King’s College London, and vice versa.\n\n#LondonForEveryone\n\nFor Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, “London’s greatest strength is our diversity.” Responding to the news that the UK's capital had been ranked number one in the world for the fifth year running in the QS Best Cities Ranking 2024, he said, “Our world-class universities, famous nightlife and graduate opportunities make London an unrivalled place to study.”\n\nFor London’s higher education sector, foreign students represent an important source of revenue. Data published in 2023 by the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency showed that University College London and King’s College London are in the Top 5 of universities with the most international students in the UK, with London hosting a third of all international students studying in the country.\n\n95% of the students in the London Business School MBA Class of 2025 are from outside the UK, with over 60 nationalities present. For business schools, they are not checkboxes to mark, but pathways to enhance peer-to-peer learning and build stronger global networks for both students and alumni.\n\n“London is a wonderful city for students, offering something for everyone.” says Aram Karkashian, Executive Director of Marketing, Recruitment and Admissions at Imperial College Business School. He highlights London to be a financial capital that, “bridges the East and West”, with such a role providing an extraordinary opportunity for students.\n\n“It is a multicultural melting pot that welcomes and thrives on diversity… This type of environment is a great benefit for learning and living where students can experience different cultures, perspectives, and traditions in the classroom and the city, enhancing their global business skills while building lifelong networks.”\n\n“That’s what we see within King’s Business School,” emphasises the KBS Dean. “The diversity of our staff and the diversity of our students. Typically, we have more than 90 different nationalities in our programmes. The impact of that is that we don't have just a Western Anglo-centric view of the world, especially in terms of the research our faculty undertake.”\n\nDiversity Drives Progress\n\nFrom work on preventing modern slavery, to employment in India, the research being produced by the faculty at King’s Business School are projects which, according to its Dean, come as a result of a more diverse faculty and student body.\n\nWhen your roots go back as far as King’s College London, to 1829, and Imperial College London, founded in 1907, being forward-thinking and enterprising is not straightforward; the weight of tradition and established processes can act as formidable barriers to change. Business schools with such histories across the world often grapple with a deep-seated culture that values tradition over change.\n\nBut Stephen Bach is perhaps not the traditional business school dean archetype, coming from a background in HR and with extensive experience in people-centric roles, including the National Health Service, prior to entering academia.\n\nSince becoming Dean at King’s Business School almost six years ago, his leadership style is distinctly influenced by his professional history. His initiatives, such as Faculty Quiet Weeks and putting substantial investments in staff development, have been implemented to prioritize the faculty.\n\nNotably, King’s Business School has observed an 86% increase in faculty numbers, accompanied by a 75% surge in student enrolment; “For our staff, the University’s Education Innovation Pathway emphasises innovation in education, and showed its strength during COVID. Creating an environment for diverse voices is a priority - we want to create space for collective forums, provide opportunities for engagement with industry and encourage diverse groupings in student projects.”\n\nBetter business for a better world\n\nWhilst the UK government may be (publicly) calling for less immigration, London and it’s business schools are preparing for the opposite. More programmes are being made to tailor to a growing desire for interdisciplinary teaching and partnerships.\n\n“With all the other nine faculties, such as law, we bring in crucial perspectives on digital law, governance, and employment law to enrich our programmes” says Stephen Bach. “We’ve launched an Executive MBA to help professionals in London shift into a growth mindset. Beyond King’s, we are launching a health management program in collaboration with Spain’s IE Business School, emphasising our dedication to fostering innovative initiatives with external partners”\n\nSo, what advice does the Dean of King’s Business Schools have for those thinking of studying in London ? Don’t be dissuaded, be encouraged. Apply, and come to enjoy all that London has to offer.\n\n“Don't be afraid to fail,” Bach urges. “We all fail. We're all vulnerable. We all are learning and improving, be part of that community - we all move together as one.”"
