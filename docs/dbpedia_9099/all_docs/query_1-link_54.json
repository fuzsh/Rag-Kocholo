        "text": "If someone were to ask me where to go for that quintessential English experience then Winchester would have to be right up there near the top of my list.\n\nIts location, where the River Itchen flows through the chalk Downs of the Hampshire countryside, helps give this small city of 45,000 people an air of peace and calm that belies its past history and status as Hampshire’s county town.\n\nIt was this precise spot, where the river could be forded, that attracted a Celtic tribe from the continent to build a settlement here. The tribe we now call the Belgae arrived around 100BC, but it would appear that their enclosure at Oram’s Arbour and fort at St. Catherine’s Hill had been abandoned by the time the Romans arrived in AD70, who then created a settlement of their own which they called Venta Belgarun (Marketplace of the Belgae).\n\nThe river at this point split into two around an island, and although it made for a good crossing point, it was also liable to flooding, and so the Romans diverted the river through a single channel, which not only saved their town from flooding but also gave it an extra line of defence on their eastern flank. The river still flows through this channel and can best be seen on the lovely Weirs Walk.\n\nVenta Belgarum became the 5th largest town in Britannia, but after the departure of the Romans around 410AD, Winchester, like the rest of the country, was left abandoned to the native Britons.\n\nAcross the North Sea, Jutes, Angles, and Saxons (who came from modern day Denmark, Germany, and The Netherlands) seized the opportunity to fill the void left by the Romans and set up several independent kingdoms, one of which was Wessex (West Saxons).\n\nThis Dis-United Kingdom was eventually brought under control during the 9th century when King Alfred arrived on the scene. By defeating the Danes and making Mercia part of his kingdom with the marriage of his daughter to Ethelred, he became the de facto king of all the Anglo-Saxon land, an area which we now call England.\n\nAlfred the Great, as he became known, created his capital at Wintanceaster using the old Roman town as his starting point. In fact, Wintanceaster derives from Venta and Ceaster (fortified town).\n\nYou can now see how all this background information proves that Winchester was in fact the very first capital of England."
