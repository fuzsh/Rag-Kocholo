        "text": "LONDON is one of the most famous - and visited - cities in the world, with a population of over 8.9 million.\n\nThe metropolis may be known for its city-centre landmarks like Big Ben and Tower Bridge but London actually stretches much further than the areas that tourists make a beeline for.\n\nWhat county is London in?\n\nLondon is in the ceremonial county of Greater London.\n\nIt is governed by the Greater London Assembly and the Mayor and covers an area of 607 square miles.\n\nAlthough the City of London, which covers just one square mile, falls within the administrative area of Greater London it is actually a separate ceremonial county.\n\nThe City of London is the smallest city in England, with about 10,000 residents and another half a million people who work there.\n\nCity of London Police govern the small city while Met Police are responsible for London's boroughs.\n\nGenerally, people say \"London\" to refer to the whole area of Greater London.\n\nTransport for London (TfL) is part of the Greater London Authority although the transport system does extend beyond those boundaries.\n\nWhat counties does London cover?\n\nGreater London was created in 1965 out of the former County of London, which had existed since 1889.\n\nFrom 1965, Greater London incorporated parts of historic counties Kent, Essex, Hertfordshire, Surrey and most of Middlesex, which was once a county itself.\n\nThere are many areas in Greater London where people still identify with the county they were once in, such as \"Stanmore, Middlesex\", \"Hayes, Kent\" or \"Barking, Essex\".\n\nSome still have postcodes that have not been updated - like Bromley, which is now in south-east London but has retained a Kent postcode.\n\nThese homes around the borders pay London taxes and are under the governance of the Greater London Borough Councils.\n\nHow many boroughs does London have?\n\nLondon has 32 boroughs.\n\nTwelve are designated as Inner London while the other twenty are classed as Outer London.\n\nThe twelve inner boroughs are:\n\nCamden\n\nGreenwich\n\nHackney\n\nHammersmith and Fulham\n\nIslington\n\nKensington and Chelsea\n\nLambeth\n\nLewisham\n\nSouthwark\n\nTower Hamlets\n\nWandsworth\n\nWestminster\n\nAnd the outer London boroughs are:\n\nBarking and Dagenham\n\nBarnet\n\nBexley\n\nBrent\n\nBromley\n\nCroydon\n\nEaling\n\nEnfield\n\nHaringey\n\nHarrow\n\nHavering\n\nHillingdon\n\nHounslow\n\nRoyal Borough of Kingston upon Thames\n\nMerton\n\nNewham\n\nRedbridge\n\nRichmond upon Thames\n\nSutton\n\nWaltham Forest\n\nAll the boroughs are governed by local councils apart from the City of London which has its own governance.\n\nThe councils decide policies on services like libraries, waste collection, and adult and social services.\n\nThe Greater London Authority, meanwhile, has jurisdiction over other elements of daily life such as transport, police services and fire services.\n\nHas London always been the capital of England?\n\nThere is some disagreement amongst historians about what the first capital of England was.\n\nAccording to some, the first capital city of England on record was actually Colchester, now in Essex.\n\nThis was said to have been chosen as capital by the Romans in around 50BC.\n\nThe settlement known as Londonium, which would eventually grow and merge with other cities to become modern day London, was reportedly later picked as their capital.\n\nWhen the Romans left, however, the capital city of England changed multiple times.\n\nThese changes were made according to which kingdom was most powerful.\n\nTamworth, then capital city of Mercia, was declared capital city of England under King Offa in the 600s.\n\nThis was followed by Winchester, capital of then Wessex, which became the capital of England in the late 800s under Alfred the Great.\n\nSome historians name Winchester as the first official capital of England.\n\nIn the year 913, when Northampton was reclaimed from the Danes, that became the next capital of England.\n\nLondon was then the capital for the Normans after their invasion in 1066 and the cityâ€™s existing rights and privileges were established by William Duke of Normandy (also known as William the Conquerer) in 1067."
