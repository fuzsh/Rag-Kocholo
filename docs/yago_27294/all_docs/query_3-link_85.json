        "text": "(The Male Patron Saint of the Secular Franciscans) – FEAST DAY: AUGUST 25\n\nIn Louis IX of France were united the qualities of a just and upright sovereign, a fearless warrior, and a saint. This crusading king was a living embodiment of the Christianity of the time: he lived for the welfare of his subjects and the glory of God. His father was Louis VIII, of the Capet line, and his mother was Queen Blanche, daughter of King Alfonso of Castileand Eleanor of England. Louis, the oldest son, was born at Poissy on the Seine, a little below Paris, on April 25, 1215, and there was christened.\n\nThe role of the Queen mother. Much of his virtue is attributed to his mother’s care, for the Queen devoted herself to her children’s education. She was determined that Louis should be educated not only for the earthly kingdom he was to govern, but still more for the kingdom of heaven. She accustomed him to look upon all things in the light of faith, and thus laid the foundation for that humility in good fortune and endurance in misfortune which characterized the holy King.\n\nLouis had tutors who made him a master of Latin, taught him to speak easily in public and write with dignity and grace. He was instructed in the arts of war and government and all other kingly accomplishments. But Queen Blanche’s primary concern was to implant in him a deep regard and awe for everything related to religion. She used often to say to him as he was growing up, “I love you my dear son, as much as a mother can love her child; but I would rather see you dead at my feet than that you should commit a mortal sin.”\n\nA boy of twelve crowned as King of France. After a reign of only three years, his father (Louis VIII) died, and Queen Blanche was declared regent for her eleven-year-old son. To forestall an uprising of restless nobles, she hastened the ceremony of Louis’ coronation, which took place at Rheims on the first Sunday of Advent, 1226, when he was not even 12 years old. At his coronation, Louis bound himself by oath to behave as God’s anointed, as the father of his people and feudal lord of the King of Peace. Other kings had done the same, of course, but with one difference … Louis actually interpreted his kingly duties in the light of faith. After the violence ot two previous reigns, he brought peace and justice.\n\nThe boy was tall, and mature for his age, yet he trembled as he took the solemn oath; he asked of God courage, light, and strength to use his authority well, to uphold the divine honor, defend the Church, and serve the good of his people. The ambitious barons, who were not present at the coronation, were soon making extravagant demands for more privileges and lands, thinking to take advantage of the King’s youth. But they reckoned without the Queen; by making clever alliances, she succeeded in overcoming them on the battlefield, so that when Louis assumed control some years later, his position was strong.\n\nDuring his minority, his mother was entrusted with the actual government of the kingdom. Meanwhile, Louis was being educated in all the duties of a real Christian prince. Among his instructors there were several Franciscan friars, and later on the young king himself joined the Third Order of St. Francis.\n\nMarriage. In May, 1234, when he was 19 (and his bride 12), he was married to Marguerite of Provence, the oldest daughter of Raymond Beranger, Count of Provence. It was a loving marriage, despite her arrogant and restless nature. They had 11 children, 5 sons and 6 daughters. This line continued in power in France for five hundred years. In 1793, as the guillotine fell on Louis XVI, it will be recalled that the Abbe Edgeworth murmured: “Son of St. Louis, ascend to Heaven!”\n\nAfter taking the government of the realm into his hands, one of the young King’s first acts was to build the famous monastery of Royaumont, with funds left for the purpose by his father. Louis gave encouragement to the religious orders, installing the Carthusians in the palace of Vauvertin Paris, and assisting his mother in founding the convent of Maubuisson. Ambitious to make France foremost among Christian nations, Louis was overjoyed at the opportunity to buy the Crown of Thorns and other holy relics from the Eastern Emperor at Constantinople. He sent two Dominican friars to bring these sacred objects to France, and, attended by an impressive train, he met them at Sens on their return. To house the relics, he built on the island in the Seine named for him, the shrine of Sainte-Chapelle, one of the most beautiful examples of Gothic architecture in existence. Since the French Revolution it stands empty of its treasure.\n\nThe seventh crusade. In 1244, Louis had a serious illness, namely a violent fever. At that time he vowed, that if he would recover, he would make a crusade to the Holy Land, to wrest the holy places from the hands of the non-Christians. Upon regaining his health the king announced his intention of undertaking a crusade to the East. King Louis IX was determined to “take the cross” for a Crusade. As a matter of fact, he went on two crusades, in his mid-30s in 1248 (Seventh Crusade) and then again in his mid-50s in 1270 (Eighth Crusade).\n\nAlthough his advisers urged him to abandon the idea, he was not to be moved from his decision. Elaborate preparations for the journey and settling certain disturbances in the kingdom caused him to postpone his departure for three and a half years. All benefices in Christendom were ordered taxed a twentieth of their income for three years for the relief of the Holy Land. Blanche was to be regent during the King’s absence. On June 12, 1248, Louis left Paris, accompanied by his wife and three brothers. Their immediate objective was Egypt, whose Sultan, Melek Selah, had been overrunning Palestine. Damietta, at the mouth of one of the branches of the Nile, was easily taken. Louis and the Queen, accompanied by his brothers, the nobles, and prelates, made a solemn entry into the city, singing Te Deum. The King issued orders that all acts of violence committed by his soldiers should be punished and restitution made to the persons injured. He forbade the killing of any moslem taken prisoner, and gave directions that all who might desire to embrace the Christian faith should be given instruction, and, if they wished it, baptized. Yet as long as the army was quartered around Damietta, many of his soldiers fell into debauchery and lawlessness. The rising of the Nile and the summer heat made it impossible for them to advance and follow up their success. After six months they moved forward to attack the Saracens on the opposite side of the river, in Mansourah. The ranks of the crusaders were thinned more by disease than by combat. In April, 1250, Louis himself, weakened by dysentery, was taken prisoner, and his army was routed.\n\nDuring his captivity. the King recited the Divine Office every day with two chaplains and had the prayers of the Mass read to him. He met insults with an air of majesty which awed his guards. In the course of negotiations for his liberation, the Sultan was murdered by his emirs. The King and his fellow prisoners were released, though the sick and wounded crusaders left in Damietta were slain. With the remnant of his army Louis then sailed to the Syrian coast and remained in that region until 1254, fortifying the cities of Acre, Jaffa, Caesarea, and Tyre, which as yet remained in Christian hands. He visited the Holy Places that were in the possession of Christians, encouraging their garrisons, and doing what he could to strengthen their defenses. Not until news was brought him of the death of his mother did he feel that he must return to France. He had now been away almost six years, and even after his return, he continued to wear the cross on his shoulder to show his intention of going back to succor the Eastern Christians. Their position worsened, and within a few years Nazareth, Caesarea,Jaffa, and Antioch had been captured.\n\nLouis IX as the king of France and as a member of the Church. Louis IX is admired as a crusader, but perhaps greater credit is due him for his concern for justice in civil administration. He drew up regulations for his officials which became the first of a series of reform laws. He replaced trial by battle with a form of examination of witnesses and encouraged the beginning of using written records in court.\n\nAfter taking the government of the realm into his hands, one of the young King’s first acts was to build the famous monastery of Royaumont, with funds left for the purpose by his father. Louis gave encouragement to the religious orders, installing the Carthusians in the palace of Vauvert in Paris, and assisting his mother in founding the convent of Maubuisson. Ambitious to make France foremost among Christian nations, Louis was overjoyed at the opportunity to buy the Crown of Thorns and other holy relics from the Eastern Emperor atConstantinople. He sent two Dominican friars to bring these sacred objects to France, and, attended by an impressive train, he met them at Sens on their return. To house the relics, he built on the island in theSeine named for him, the shrine of Sainte-Chapelle, one of the most beautiful examples of Gothic architecture in existence. Since the French Revolution it stands empty of its treasure.\n\nLouis was always repectful of the papacy, but defended royal interests against the popes and refused to acknowledge Pope Innocent IV’s [1243-1254] sentence against the emperor Frederick II [German king from 1212-1250 and Holy Roman Emperor from 1220]. He was devoted to his people, founding hospitals, visiting the sick and, like his patron St. Francis, caring even for the people with leprosy. Louis IX united France – lords and townfolk, peasants and priest and knights – by the force of his personality and holiness. For many years the nation was at peace.\n\nLouis was strong-willed, strong-minded. His word was trusted utterly, and his courage in action was remarkable. What is most remarkable was his sense of respect for anyone with whom he dealt, especially the “humble folk of the Lord.” To care for his people he built cathedrals, churches, libraries, hospitals and orphanages. He dealt withy princes honestly and equitably. He hoped to be treated the same by the King of Kings, to whom he gave his life, his family and his country.\n\nEvery day Louis had 13 special guests from among the poor to eat with him, and a large number of poor were served meals near his palace. During Advent and Lent all who presented themselves were given a meal, and Louis often seved them in person. He kept lists of needy people, whom he regularly relieved, in every province of his dominion.\n\nIn I258 Louis concluded the Peace of Paris with his old enemy Henry III of England. Though Louis had been victorious in most of the battles, he now voluntarily surrendered to Englandthe provinces of Limousin, Quercy, and Perigord, while Henry renounced all claim to recover Normandy,Anjou,Maine,Touraine, and Poitou. The French nobility were outraged by their King’s concessions, but Louis explained that he hoped thus to cement a lasting friendship between the two nations. Unfortunately, peace did not ensue; the Hundred Years’ War was still to come. A similar compromise was made with the King of-Aragon, by which France secured Provence and most of Languedoc, and gave up claims to Roussillon and Barcelona.\n\nThe eighth crusade and his death. One day, after standing godfather to a Jewish convert who had been baptized at St. Denis, Louis remarked to an ambassador from the emir of Tunis that to see the emir baptized he would himself joyfully spend the rest of his life in Saracen chains. The King was determined to go on another crusade, and in 1267 he announced his intention. His people objected, fearing they would lose their excellent and revered ruler, who, though only fifty-two years old, was worn with toil, illness, and austerities. The Pope supported the crusade, and granted Louis one-tenth of all Church revenues to help meet the expense. A toll-tax was also levied on the French people. Louis appointed the abbot of St. Denis and Simon de Clermont as regents. His three eldest sons, Philip, John, and Peter, accompanied him. The worthy Joinville disapproved the enterprise and stayed at home.\n\nLouis sailed with his forces from Aigues-Mortes, at the mouth of the Rhone, on July 1, 1270, heading forTunis, where, he had been told, the emir was ready to be converted and join the expedition to win back the Holy Places. The crusade was a dismal failure. On landing at Carthage, Louis learned to his dismay that the information about the emir was false. He decided to wait there for reinforcements from the King of Sicily. Dysentery and other diseases broke out among the crusaders, and Louis’ second son, who had been born at Damietta during the earlier crusade, died. That same day the King and his eldest son, Philip, sickened, and it was soon apparent that Louis would not recover. He was speechless all the next morning, but at three in the afternoon he said, “Into Thy hands I commend my spirit,” and quickly breathed his last. On 25 August 1270, Louis IX died on foreign soil at the age of 56.\n\nSaint of the Church. His bones and heart were taken back to France and kept enshrined in the abbey-church of St. Denis, until they were scattered at the time of the Revolution. Louis was strong, idealistic, austere, just; his charities and foundations were notable, and he went on two crusades. Little wonder that a quarter of a century after his death the process of canonization was started and quickly completed the man who was “every inch a king” became a saint of the Church in 1297, twenty-seven years after his death.\n\nShort Prayer: Almighty, ever-living God, You took Saint Louis from his cares as a ruler in this world, and brought him to the glory of heaven. Help us to live according to his life example, seeking Your eternal kingdom through the tasks we perform on earth. We pray this in the most precious name of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour. Amen.\n\nSources: Matthew Bunson, OUR SUNDAY VISITOR’S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CATHOLIC HISTORY; Joan Carrol Cruz, SECULAR SAINTS (pages 410-420); Leonard Foley OFM (Editor), SAINT OF THE DAY (pages 217-219); Marion A.
