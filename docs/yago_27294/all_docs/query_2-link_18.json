        "text": "Margaret of Provence and her daughter Isabelle\n\nOwners\n\nA direct association with Louis IXâ€™s wife Margaret of Provence or their daughter, Isabelle who married Thibault V, Count of Champagne and King of Navarre, in 1255, is unlikely, given the slim heraldic evidence. The three line fillers with the arms of Provence feature on two pages only (fols. 169v, 174r), which are part of the same bifolio. The arms of Provence are probably a reference to Margaret in a book made for a family member."
