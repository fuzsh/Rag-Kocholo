        "text": "St. Louis of France\n\nReigning from 1226 to 1270, Louis IX showed how a saint would act on the throne of France. He was a lovable personality, a kind husband, a father of eleven children, and at the same time a strict ascetic.\n\nTo an energetic and prudent rule Louis added love and zeal for the practice of piety and the reception of the holy sacraments. He was brave in battle, polished at feasts, and addicted to fasting and mortification. His politics were grounded upon strict justice, unshatterable fidelity, and untiring effort toward peace. Nevertheless, his was not a weakly rule but one that left its impress upon following generations. He was a great friend of religious Orders, a generous benefactor of the Church.\n\nThe Breviary says of him:\n\n“He had already been king for twenty years when he fell victim to a severe illness. That afforded the occasion for making a vow to undertake a crusade for the liberation of the Holy Land. Immediately upon recovery he received the crusader’s cross from the hand of the bishop of Paris, and, followed by an immense army, he crossed the sea in 1248. On the field of battle Louis routed the Saracens; yet when the plague had taken large numbers of his soldiery, he was attacked and taken captive (1250). The king was forced to make peace with the Saracens; upon the payment of a huge ransom, he and his army were again set at liberty.”\n\nWhile on a second crusade he died of the plague, with these words from the psalm upon his lips:\n\n“I will enter Thy house; I will worship in Thy holy temple and sing praises to Thy Name!” (Ps. 5).\n\nExcerpted from The Church’s Year of Grace, Pius Parsch\n\nIt was his mother’s supreme desire that her son should become a kind, pious and just ruler. She was in the habit of saying to him:\n\n“Never forget that sin is the only great evil in the world. No mother could love her son more than I love you. But I would rather see you lying dead at my feet than know that you had offended God by one mortal sin.”\n\nThese words remained indelibly impressed upon his mind.\n\nSt. Louis was a member of the Third Order of St. Francis and so is included in the family of Franciscan saints.\n\nPatron: barbers; builders; button makers; construction workers; Crusaders; death of children; difficult marriages; distillers; embroiderers; French monarchs; grooms; haberdashers; hairdressers; hair stylists; kings; masons; needle workers; parenthood; parents of large families; prisoners; sculptors; sick people; soldiers; stone masons; stonecutters; tertiaries; Archdiocese of Saint Louis, Missouri."
