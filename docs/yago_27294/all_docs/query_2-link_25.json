        "text": "Misc. Notes\n\nMarguerite Berenger of Provence (c. 1221, St. Main - December 21, 1295, Paris) was a daughter of Ramon Berenguer V, Count of Provence and Beatrice of Savoy.\n\nHer maternal grandparents were Thomas I of Savoy and Marguerite of Geneva, daughter of William I of Geneva.\n\nHer older sister Sanchia of Provence became the Queen consort of Richard, Earl of Cornwall and rival King of the Germans. Her sister of similar age Beatrice of Provence was the Queen consort of Charles I of Sicily. Her younger sister Eleanor of Provence became the Queen consort of Henry III of England.\n\nMarguerite herself became the Queen consort of Louis IX of France and mother to eleven children.\n\n1. Blanche (1240âApril 29, 1243)\n\n2. Isabelle (March 2, 1241âJanuary 28, 1271), married Theobald V of Champagne\n\n3. Louis (February 25, 1244âJanuary 1260)\n\n4. Philippe III (May 1, 1245âOctober 5, 1285)\n\n5. Jean (born and died in 1248)\n\n6. Jean Tristan (1250âAugust 3, 1270)\n\n7. Pierre (1251â1284)\n\n8. Blanche (1253â1323), married Ferdinand de la Cerda\n\n9. Marguerite (1254â1271), married John I, Duke of Brabant\n\n10. Robert, Count of Clermont (1256âFebruary 7, 1317). He was the ancestor of King Henry IV of France.\n\n11. Agnes of France (c. 1260âDecember 19, 1327), married Robert II, Duke of Burgundy\n\nMarguerite, like her sisters, was noted for her beauty and in the early years of their marriage she and Louis enjoyed a warm relationship. Her Franciscan confessor, William de St. Pathus, related that on cold nights Marguerite would place a robe around Louis' shoulders, when her deeply religious husband rose to pray. Another anecdote recorded by St. Pathus related that Marguerite felt that Louis' plain clothing was unbecoming to his royal dignity, to which Louis replied that he would dress as she wished, if she dressed as he wished. However, the chronicler Joinville noted with disapproval that Louis rarely asked after his wife and children, and in later years Louis became vexed with Marguerite's ambition.\n\nShe was devoted to her sister Queen Eleanor of England, and they stayed in contact until Eleanor's death."
