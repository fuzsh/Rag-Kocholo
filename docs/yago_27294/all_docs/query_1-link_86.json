        "text": "Through Eleanor, Queen of Castile\n\nEleanor, Queen of Castile (1162 â€“ 1214) was the second daughter and sixth child of Eleanor of Aquitaine and her second husband, Henry II of England.\n\nShe married King Alfonso VIII of Castile in about 1177, part of a diplomatic agreement about Aquitaineâ€™s border. They had eleven children.\n\nAlfonso was succeeded by Henry I, his youngest child by Eleanor, then by his eldest daughter,Berengaria, then her son Ferdinand.\n\nAlfonso VIII was the great grandson of Urraca of Leon and Castile,\n\nThrough Berengaria of Castile\n\nBeregaria (Berenguela) was the eldest child of Alfonso VIII of Castile and his queen, Eleanor, Queen of Castile, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II of England.\n\n1. Berengaria (about 1178 â€“ 1246),in 1188 contracted a marriage with Duke Conrad II of Swabia, which was annulled. She then in 1197 married Alfonso IX of LeÃ³n (dissolved 1204) with whom she had five children.\n\nAlfonso IX had been married previously to Theresa of Portugal; none of his children from the first marriage had children. He also had illegitimate children.\n\nBerengaria ruled Castile briefly in 1217 after first her father's then her youngest brother Henryâ€™s death, abdicating that year in favor of her son Ferdinand. This reunited Castile and LeÃ³n.\n\nThe children of Berengaria and Alfonso IX of LeÃ³n:\n\nEleanor (1198/9 â€“ 1202)\n\nConstance (1200 â€“ 1242), who became a nun\n\nFerdinand III, King of Castile and LeÃ³n (1201? â€“ 1252). Canonized by Pope Clement X in 1671. He was married twice.\n\nAlfonso (1203 â€“ 1272). Married three times: Mafalda de Lara, Teresa NÃºÃ±ez, and third, Mayor TÃ©llez de Meneses. His only child was a daughter, Maria of Molina, born during his third marriage. She married Sancho IV of LeÃ³n and Castile, whose grandfather was Ferdinand III, her fatherâ€™s brother.\n\nBerengaria, who married John of Brienne, King of Jerusalem, as his third wife. They had four children: Marie of Brienne married Emperor Baldwin II of Constantinople; Alphonso of Brienne became count of Eu; John of Brienne, whose second wife was Marie de Coucy whose father had once been married to a granddaughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine; and Louis of Acre who married Agnes of Beaumont and was the grandfather of Isabel de Beaumont who married the 1st Duke of Lancaster and was the maternal grandmother of King Henry IV of England.\n\nMore Children of Eleanor, Queen of Castile\n\nMore children of Alfonso VIII of Castile and his queen, Eleanor, Queen of Castile, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II of England: these three all died in early infancy.\n\n2. Sancho (1181 â€“ 1181)\n\n3. Sancha (1182 â€“ about 1184)\n\n4. Henry (1184 â€“ 1184?) - his existence is not recognized in all histories\n\nThrough Urraca, Queen of Portugal\n\nUrraca was the fifth child of Alfonso VIII of Castile and his queen, Eleanor, Queen of Castile, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II of England. She was originally proposed as a bride for Louis VIII of France, but when Eleanor of Aquitaine journeyed to visit, she decided that Urraca's younger sister Blanche would make a better fit with Louis VIII.\n\nUrraca of Castile, Queen of Portugal, was the 2nd great granddaughter of Urraca of Leon and Castile (depicted above) and the 4th great grandmother of Isabella I of Castile.\n\n5. Urraca (1187 â€“ 1220), married Alfonso II of Portugal (1185 â€“ 1223) in 1206. Their children included:\n\nSancho II of Portugal (1207 â€“ 1248), married about 1245.\n\nAfonso III of Portugal (1210 - 1279), married twice: Matilda II of Boulogne and Beatrice of Castile, an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso X of Castile. They had a number of children, including Denis, King of Portugal, who married Isabel of Aragon; and Afonso, who married a daughter of Manuel of Castile. Two daughters entered convents.\n\nEleanor (about 1211 â€“ 1231) who married Valdemar the Young, King of Denmark. She died in childbirth and the child apparently died a few months later.\n\nFernando, Lord of Serpa (1217 â€“ 1246), married Sancha FernÃ¡ndez de Lara. No children of the marriage, though an illegitimate son survived and had descendants.\n\npossibly another child named Vicente.\n\nThrough Blanche, Queen of France\n\nBlanche was the sixth child of Alfonso VIII of Castile and his queen, Eleanor, Queen of Castile, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II of England:\n\n6. Blanche (1188 â€“ 1252), married Louis VIII of France, who had been originally betrothed to Blancheâ€™s older sister Urraca before Eleanor of Aquitaine met the sisters and decided Blanche was a more appropriate queen of France. Famously, Eleanor crossed the Pyrenees with her granddaughter in 1200, when Eleanor would have been in her 70s, to bring Blanche to France to marry the grandson of Eleanorâ€™s first husband, Louis VII of France. At the time of their marriage, Louis was a prince, and was also the disputed King of England 1216 - 1217. He was almost matched with Eleanor of Brittany, Blanche's cousin and daughter of Blanche's maternal uncle Geoffrey II of Brittany.\n\nBlanche and Louis VIII had 13 children:\n\nUnnamed daughter (1205?)\n\nPhilip (1209 â€“ 1218)\n\nAlphonse (1213 â€“ 1213), a twin\n\nJohn (1213 â€“ 1213), a twin\n\nLouis IX of France (1214 â€“ 1270), king of France. He married Margaret of Provence in 1234. Margaret was one of four sisters who married kings. One married the King of England, Henry III; Richard Earl of Cornwall who became King of the Romans; and Louisâ€™ younger brother Charles who became King of Sicily. The surviving children of Margaret of Provence and Louis IX of France included Isabella who married Theobald II of Navarre; Philip III of France; Margaret, who married John I of Brabant; Robert, married to Beatrice of Burgundy, and ancestor of the Bourbon kings of France; and Agnes, who married Robert II of Burgundy.\n\nRobert (1216 â€“ 1250)\n\nPhilip (1218 â€“ 1220)\n\nJohn (1219 -1232), betrothed in 1227 but not married\n\nAlphonse (1220 â€“ 1271), married Joan of Toulouse in 1237. They had no children. She accompanied him on crusade in 1249 and 1270.\n\nPhilip Dagobert (1222 â€“ 1232)\n\nIsabelle (1224 â€“ 1270), who entered a convent at Longchamp with a revised rule modified from that of the Poor Clares. She was beatified as a saint of the Roman Catholic faith in 1521 by Pope Leo X and canonized in 1696 by Pope Innocent XII.\n\nEtienne (1225 â€“ 1227)\n\nCharles I of Sicily (1227 â€“ 1285), married Beatrice of Provence, with whom he had seven children, then Margaret of Burgundy, which whom he had one daughter who died in childhood.
