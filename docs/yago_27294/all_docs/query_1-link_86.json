        "text": "Through Eleanor, Queen of Castile\n\nEleanor, Queen of Castile (1162 – 1214) was the second daughter and sixth child of Eleanor of Aquitaine and her second husband, Henry II of England.\n\nShe married King Alfonso VIII of Castile in about 1177, part of a diplomatic agreement about Aquitaine’s border. They had eleven children.\n\nAlfonso was succeeded by Henry I, his youngest child by Eleanor, then by his eldest daughter,Berengaria, then her son Ferdinand.\n\nAlfonso VIII was the great grandson of Urraca of Leon and Castile,\n\nThrough Berengaria of Castile\n\nBeregaria (Berenguela) was the eldest child of Alfonso VIII of Castile and his queen, Eleanor, Queen of Castile, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II of England.\n\n1. Berengaria (about 1178 – 1246),in 1188 contracted a marriage with Duke Conrad II of Swabia, which was annulled. She then in 1197 married Alfonso IX of León (dissolved 1204) with whom she had five children.\n\nAlfonso IX had been married previously to Theresa of Portugal; none of his children from the first marriage had children. He also had illegitimate children.\n\nBerengaria ruled Castile briefly in 1217 after first her father's then her youngest brother Henry’s death, abdicating that year in favor of her son Ferdinand. This reunited Castile and León.\n\nThe children of Berengaria and Alfonso IX of León:\n\nEleanor (1198/9 – 1202)\n\nConstance (1200 – 1242), who became a nun\n\nFerdinand III, King of Castile and León (1201? – 1252). Canonized by Pope Clement X in 1671. He was married twice.\n\nAlfonso (1203 – 1272). Married three times: Mafalda de Lara, Teresa Núñez, and third, Mayor Téllez de Meneses. His only child was a daughter, Maria of Molina, born during his third marriage. She married Sancho IV of León and Castile, whose grandfather was Ferdinand III, her father’s brother.\n\nBerengaria, who married John of Brienne, King of Jerusalem, as his third wife. They had four children: Marie of Brienne married Emperor Baldwin II of Constantinople; Alphonso of Brienne became count of Eu; John of Brienne, whose second wife was Marie de Coucy whose father had once been married to a granddaughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine; and Louis of Acre who married Agnes of Beaumont and was the grandfather of Isabel de Beaumont who married the 1st Duke of Lancaster and was the maternal grandmother of King Henry IV of England.\n\nMore Children of Eleanor, Queen of Castile\n\nMore children of Alfonso VIII of Castile and his queen, Eleanor, Queen of Castile, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II of England: these three all died in early infancy.\n\n2.

Henry (1184 – 1184?) - his existence is not recognized in all histories\n\nThrough Urraca, Queen of Portugal\n\nUrraca was the fifth child of Alfonso VIII of Castile and his queen, Eleanor, Queen of Castile, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II of England. She was originally proposed as a bride for Louis VIII of France, but when Eleanor of Aquitaine journeyed to visit, she decided that Urraca's younger sister Blanche would make a better fit with Louis VIII.\n\nUrraca of Castile, Queen of Portugal, was the 2nd great granddaughter of Urraca of Leon and Castile (depicted above) and the 4th great grandmother of Isabella I of Castile.\n\n5. Urraca (1187 – 1220), married Alfonso II of Portugal (1185 – 1223) in 1206. Their children included:\n\nSancho II of Portugal (1207 – 1248), married about 1245.\n\nAfonso III of Portugal (1210 - 1279), married twice: Matilda II of Boulogne and Beatrice of Castile, an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso X of Castile.

Blanche (1188 – 1252), married Louis VIII of France, who had been originally betrothed to Blanche’s older sister Urraca before Eleanor of Aquitaine met the sisters and decided Blanche was a more appropriate queen of France. Famously, Eleanor crossed the Pyrenees with her granddaughter in 1200, when Eleanor would have been in her 70s, to bring Blanche to France to marry the grandson of Eleanor’s first husband, Louis VII of France. At the time of their marriage, Louis was a prince, and was also the disputed King of England 1216 - 1217. He was almost matched with Eleanor of Brittany, Blanche's cousin and daughter of Blanche's maternal uncle Geoffrey II of Brittany.\n\nBlanche and Louis VIII had 13 children:\n\nUnnamed daughter (1205?)\n\nPhilip (1209 – 1218)\n\nAlphonse (1213 – 1213), a twin\n\nJohn (1213 – 1213), a twin\n\nLouis IX of France (1214 – 1270), king of France.
