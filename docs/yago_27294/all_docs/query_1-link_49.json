        "text": "Margaret, Eleanor, Sanchia, and Beatrice were born into the royal family of the minor French county of Provence. But they would rise to be the most powerful women in Europe as the Queens of France, England, Germany, and Sicily, respectively.\n\nMargaret, Queen of France (Spring 1221 - 20 December 1295) was born in Forcalquier, the eldest daughter of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence and princess Beatrice of Savoy. She was a famous beauty endowed with dark hair and dark eyes and was very close with younger sister Eleanor. In 1234 she married King Louis IX of France. Their eleven children included Queen Isabella of Castile, King Philip III of France, Duchess Margaret of Brabant, and Duchess Agnes of Burgundy. Though Louis loved his wife, he was stuck between his wife and his mother, Queen Blanche who treated Queen Margaret terribly. Margaret, however, was supportive of her husband, going with him on his first crusade. She became the first woman ever to lead a crusade, after her husband was kidnapped by opposition. Her strengthening of France’s relationship with King Henry III of England and Margaret’s sister Queen Eleanor resulted in the Treaty of Paris. King Louis died in his second crusade. Margaret then returned to her Provence where she died.\n\nEleanor, Queen of England (c. 1223 – 24/25 June 1291) was born in Aixe-en-Provence, second daughter of the Count and Countess of Province. Just like her sisters and mother, the brunette princess was a beauty, who was called by contemporary Piers Langtoft as “the fairest may of life.” In 1236, dressed in a glittering golden gown walking down the halls of Canterbury Cathedral, she married King Henry III of England. Theyir five known children included the famous King Edward I of England, Queen Margaret of Scots, and Duchess Beatrice of Brittany. The young Eleanor never felt at home in the primitive court of England, being so used to the extravagant—though small—court of Provence, and relied heavily on the comfort of her Savoyard relatives. Her association with those Savoy relatives made her unpopular with the people. Her and Henry’s favoritism of the Savoyards over the English nobility caused parliament to call for a new government. Although she tried to raise an army to restore the royal supremacy, it came of nothing. When her husband died, she was isolated in her son’s new England where she died at Amesbury, the convent she had retired to.\n\nSanchia, Queen of Germany (c. 1228 – 9 November 1261) was considered the most beautiful of the Provencial sisters. Sanchia and Beatrice were annoyed that their queen elder sisters forced them to sit on stools in their presence because of lack of queenship. This would change however, for both of them. In 1242, her sister Queen Eleanor contracted a marriage between Sanchia and Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall. In 1257, Richard and Sanchia were crowned King & Queen of the Romans. Richard doted on his wife, basking her in extravagance and affection. Sanchia and Richard had only one child, Edmund. Only four years after becoming Queen, Sanchia died at only 33 years.\n\nBeatrice, Queen of Sicily (c. 1231 – 23 September 1267) though she died young like her sister Sanchia, Beatrice by far led the most romantic and exciting life of the sisters. A beautiful princess, Beatrice’s marital prospects were increased when her father made her Countess of Provence in her own right. She had many suitors, including the King of Spain and Charles of Anjou, the latter whom she married. The match was one of affection, if not love, and produced seven children, including Countess Blanche of Flounders, Beatrice the wife of the titular Emperor of Byzantium, King Charles II of Naples, Philippe the titular King of Thessalonica, and Queen Isabella of Hungary. Beatrice & Charles were a team, including pushing Beatrice’s mother out of the control of Provence; setting up a highly efficient and lucrative administration in Provence; and accompanying each other on the Seventh Crusade. As Charles was not yet King, Beatrice was forced to sit at a lower table than her sisters when they all met. In 1266, she and her husband were crown Queen & King of Sicily, finally earning Beatrice a seat at the high table with her queen sisters."
