Occupation: Marriage Celebrant

As engaged couple Allan Steiger and Janelle Timmins prepared to leave Erinsborough for a fresh start in Northern Queensland, a street party was thrown to send them off and Steiger then surprised his fiancée by announcing that they were going to get married there and then. Celebrant Lili Ford performed the ceremony and they were pronounced man and wife in front of their assembled family and friends, before heading off in style  taking off from the Erinsborough Sports Oval in a helicopter.
