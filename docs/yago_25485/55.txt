Anne Baxter was a fictional character on the Network Ten soap opera Neighbours, portrayed by Tessa James.

Character's background

She is the biological daughter of Kim (Brett Swain) and Janelle Timmins (Nell Feeney), who was switched at birth with their daughter Bree (Sianoa Smit-McPhee). Her biological family recently found out who she is. She is blind. When Mr. and Mrs. Baxter found that Anne had met the Timminses, they panicked and kidnapped Anne.

It was soon revealed that Loris (Kate Fitzpatrick), Anne's grandmother, switched her and Bree at birth and now regrets her actions. After confiding this secret to Harold Bishop (Ian Smith), Loris left to find the Baxters.

Anne returned to Erinsborough in July 2007, much to the surprise of the Timminses. When Harold's granddaughter Sky (Stephanie McIntosh) suspected that Anne was hiding something, she pressed him for answers, and he reluctantly admitted that Loris switched Bree and Anne at birth. Sky demanded that Harold tell Janelle about the switch. Meanwhile, Anne's adoptive father (Bree's biological father) Greg (Chris Connelly) arrived looking for Anne, to be faced with his biological daughter, Bree. Bree and Greg find out that they have a lot in common which they do not expect.
