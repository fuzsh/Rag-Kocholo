Meanwhile he held Katya kidnapped for several days until the shooting and toady and susan found her.Susan & Karl are back together, while Rachel has been sneaking around with stingray.They all got caught now rachel & zeak are mad and they think that there dad didn't matter to susan and want nothing more to do with her. Sky is pregnant with what we thought was dylan's baby, but as it turns out is stingrays because the timing for dylan's is all wrong.It is not JP's as he had a vastestomy, so it's not his. As you can tell Janelle is pleased that there will another Timmins coming into the world, but doesn't know that it's stingray she still think's it's dylan baby.Elle & Dylan are an Item.\n\nI'll write some more at the end of the week, so I can give you the up to date goss."
