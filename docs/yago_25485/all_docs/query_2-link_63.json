        "text": "I looked up the “movement” online\n\nout of curiosity.\n\nAnd the most popular Google searches were\n\n“Is the Xi Movement a scam?” and “Xi Movement cult.”\n\nAnd I think if you leave your husband\n\nand your three-year-old kid\n\nand your mortgage and your job\n\nbehind to move in with a group of people in New Mexico,\n\nall over some vitamins,\n\nthen yeah, it’s a cult.\n\nIt’s a cult, so naturally\n\nthey’re all hush-hush about what exactly goes on\n\nat the “Wellness Compound.”\n\n(By the way, no one lives in “compounds”\n\nexcept for cult members.)\n\nPeople who have come out of it have given interviews,\n\nand so far, it seems relatively harmless,\n\nexcept for the way that the members\n\nthrow away their jobs and families\n\nand give all their money to their leader, Brother Ben\n\n(total cult leader name).\n\nNo one has been ritually murdered;\n\nno mass suicides\n\nyet.\n\nIt sounds like a lot of meditation\n\nand vitamins\n\nand a very restricted diet—\n\nno meat, no dairy, no grains, no soy, no sugar, no wheat, no fruit with seeds—\n\nI’m not sure what’s left to eat after that.\n\nAnyway, more vitamins and meditation\n\nand allegedly no sex,\n\nbut you just know everyone is banging Brother Ben.\n\nBeth left Alan maybe about three or four months ago,\n\nso he’s still really upset,\n\nbut I guess he’s coming to terms with it?\n\nI asked him, shouldn’t you have her kidnapped\n\nand deprogrammed or something?\n\nBut he said that it wouldn’t save the marriage,\n\nand things hadn’t been great for a while anyway.\n\nBut he’s got to raise his kid all by himself now,\n\nand he still needs to work, of course,\n\nso day care costs a fortune, and he has no social life.\n\nHis parents live in Indiana still,\n\nso he’s thinking of moving out there\n\njust to get some help with the kid.\n\nBut he’s not going to get a good IT job\n\nin the middle of a cornfield.\n\nAnd if his parents still go to\n\nthat strict nondenominational church,\n\nhe might as well join Beth in the cult.\n\nSo I don’t think he’s actually going to do that.\n\nHe says his greatest fear\n\nis that Beth will all of a sudden want to take their son\n\nto live with her in that starvation camp\n\nwith the meditation and the vitamins\n\nand freaky sex with Brother Ben.\n\nI told him he needs a really good lawyer.\n\nGod, can you imagine?\n\nThe last time I saw Beth,\n\nI ran into her at a Whole Foods.\n\nThis was months before this whole cult thing.\n\nAnd she seemed very thin and fragile\n\nwith dark circles under her eyes,\n\nand she was very annoyed with her son,\n\nbut he’s three, so of course you’d be annoyed.\n\nShe trapped me in some seemingly endless conversation\n\nabout toxins and her long list of food sensitivities,\n\nand oh my God, who cares?\n\nShe seemed too delicate and brittle for our world,\n\nSo maybe this cult isn’t the worst thing for her.\n\nmaybe she feels really free now.\n\nLike she can be her true, unchained self.\n\nMaybe she gets a lot of reading done\n\nand has great skin. I don’t know.\n\nI wouldn’t join a cult.\n\nCertainly not any cult Beth would be in.\n\n***\n\nKaren Steiger is a poet, fiction writer, and future breast cancer survivor living in Schaumburg, Illinois, with her beloved husband, Matt, and two retired racing greyhounds, Giza and Horus.
