She first appeared in April 2005 and left the show in February 2008.\n\nCharacter's background\n\nJanae is the oldest daughter of Kim Timmins (Brett Swain) and Janelle Timmins (Nell Feeney). She grew up in Colac, Victoria with her father rarely around and her older brothers frequently straying on the wrong side of the law. Janae quickly learned that she could use her female sexuality to manipulate men and used this to her advantage in many situations. When her father took off again, Janae’s mother, Janelle, found a job in Erinsborough where Dylan (Damien Bodie) and Stingray (Ben Nicholas) were already living. There, Janelle summoned Janae and her younger sister, Bree (Sianoa Smit-McPhee) to join them at No. 26, where Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) had offered them a home. However, Janae caused trouble before even arriving in Erinsborough, causing both of them to be thrown off a bus. Predictably, she tried to hitch a lift by seductively posing to drivers, but after that didn’t work, Bree began to fake cry, claiming she had to get to Erinsborough where their Siamese twin brothers were undergoing an operation. But only hours after arriving in town, Janae managed to shoplift from Harold Bishop’s (Ian Smith) General Store, only to be caught and forced to apologise by Janelle.\n\nBoyd Hoyland\n\nJanae quickly developed an interest in Boyd Hoyland (Kyal Marsh). However, this was short lived when she realised that he was in a relationship with Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh). Instead, she started to date Mike Pill (Alexander Cappelli), who was going out with Shazza Cox (Emily Wheaton) at the time. However, Mike treated Janae like a possession and allowed his mates to try it on with her. At an all-ages night, Mike tried to pressure Janae into kissing his friend. Outraged, Janae threw her drink all over Mike, and stormed out, bumping into creepy photographer Chris Cousens (Simon Mallory) on the way. He convinced her she had what it took to be a model, and spiked her drink. When he prompted to collect their coats, a dizzy Janae called home. Quickly Stingray, Dylan and Bree came to her rescue. Bree kneed Chris in the groin and Dylan took him outside to teach him a lesson about \"messing with the Timminses\". Janae was taken to the hospital, but insisted she was fine. She made her siblings promise not to tell anyone about that night’s events, although Stingray tried to persuade her to call the police.\n\nHowever, Janae continued to go out with Mike until Dylan’s over-protectiveness caused them to split-up. But Janae persuaded them to try again, and worried about losing Mike, had unprotected sex in his car. The next morning, Mike refused to drive Janae to the pharmacy to get the morning-after pill. She walked there herself, and proceeded to pull the windscreen wipers off Mike’s car, and threw them in his face, announcing he was dumped.\n\nJanae’s interest in Boyd resurfaced when he split up with Sky, but after an embarrassing rejection when she kissed him, Janae turned to the school counsellor, Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher). However, Janae became jealous that Karl had betrayed her when she spotted him talking to her brother, Stingray. She decided to leave home after over hearing a conversation between Janelle and Stingray, saying how he was the only one of her children that was worth anything. Janelle caught up with Janae in her car, and the two reconciled. Janae finally confessed to her mother about the incident with Chris Cousens on the way to Canberra for Bree’s national spelling bee. Janelle was upset that Janae had hidden this from her at the time, and came to a new understanding regarding her children and parenting. She tried to make her feelings clear to Boyd once more, having attended aikido classes with him, but he rejected her due to being involved with Kayla Thomas (Virginia Ryan), who was pregnant. Janae continued her counselling sessions with Karl and began to gradually get more dependent on him, delighted that she was being appreciated and treated like an adult. In an attempt to pay off the family’s debts, the Timmins’ sent off a tape to the TV show ‘Stupid Aussies’, which showed a video of Janae singing (badly) into her hairbrush. However she won the family $5000, and decided to keep the money to herself, wanting a breast enlargement. However, she quickly backed out when she met the plastic surgeon.\n\nKarl and Janae began to get closer, and after a night at the theatre, in which Janae insisted she was studying for a school report, Boyd told Karl that Janae was lying. After Karl advised cutting back on the sessions, Janae returned began to cry, admitting she wished Karl was her father. He suggested getting in touch with her actual father, and find a new interest. Janae became vice-captain of the basketball team, but when Karl arrived late, she ran off in tears. Janelle confronted her daughter about her relationship with Karl, and when Janae briefly replied, Janelle jumped to the conclusion that he was inappropriately involved with her daughter. After reading her diary and confronting Karl, Janelle went to Colac to find Janae. Stingray and Dylan dragged her back to clear Karl’s name, and Janae also found some details on her father while she was there. However, when Dylan was presumed dead in the plane crash, Janae turned to Boyd and they started to date. Her father also returned and before long, he and Janelle were back together.\n\nJanae and Boyd went on a road trip, and were horrified to find Janae’s ex-boyfriend, Mike. However, Janae showed how much she’d matured, ignoring Mike and his new girlfriend, Karen Chambers (Cherise Donovan), completely. But when Boyd got a summer job at the clinic and began to ask Janae awkward questions about her relationship with Mike, Janae broke in and looked at her medical file. When she found nothing out of the ordinary there, she checked Mike’s, and was horrified to find he was HIV positive. Janae told Bree, who told their father, who promised to stand by her. Eventually, Janae admitted to Boyd that she and Mike did more than just kiss, and that he should be tested too. Luckily, the test results came back negative, and she suggested to Boyd that their relationship shouldn’t be all about sex. However, jealously quickly set in when Boyd began talking to girls on his medicine course. He warned Janae about threatening other girls, but she continued to do so when she saw Boyd chatting with his fellow medical student, Sasha Hennessey (Eliose Grace). Following the birth of Boyd’s brother Charlie (Aaron Aulsebrook-Walker), Janae became obsessed with the idea of children. Sasha overheard his, and told Boyd that Janae was trying to trap him into marriage. They split up, during which time Janae took fellow neighbour, Ned Parker (Daniel O'Connor), to the school formal, where she pulled away when he tried to kiss her. She also discovered a letter, addressed ‘J. Timmins’ that was intended for her mother. The letter disclosed the details and Bree’s real parentage, and Janae threatened to tell Bree if her parents didn’t. She turned again to Boyd, who rejected her and left for a week at another hospital. Unable to contain her feelings, she blurted out to Bree about her real parentage, and when Boyd returned, was adamant that she could survive on her own. Instead, Boyd turned up on her doorstep and proposed to her.\n\nEngagement\n\nJanae agreed to marry Boyd, much to the distaste of Boyd’s father Max (Stephen Lovatt). Max invited Janae to live with the Hoyland’s for a while, in an attempt to make the young couple realise that married life was hard. However, after the chaos of Kim and Janelle’s wedding, Max warned Boyd that if he decided to go ahead with his proposal, he would throw him out the house. Janae also received the same negativity from her mother, and the two decided to live at number 30.\n\nWhen they realised they wouldn’t be getting any support, Boyd and Janae decided to elope. Along with Bree and Boyd’s sister, Summer (Marisa Siketa), Janae faked a birth certificate and became Mrs. Hoyland. Max threatened to turn in Janae following her fraud birth certificate, but Boyd ignored him, and they went on their honeymoon.\n\nJanae attempted to rent a property from a real estate agent, Thomas Griggs, to which Max turned to the wrong conclusion when he saw them together. When he realised he had made a mistake, he attempted to put in a good word for Janae, but accidentally mentioned that she was sixteen. Janae was refused the flat, and Boyd was as angry as ever with Max. However, Max's wife Steph (Carla Bonner) and Janae managed to reunite them.\n\nJanae realised her marriage wasn’t as perfect as she wished, and urged Boyd that they get marriage counselling. She also got a job at the hospital as a cleaner, in hope of seeing Boyd more. Boyd didn’t like her constant attention, and grasped the opportunity when Karl warned Janae and Boyd that if her saw them kissing again, he would fire her. Janae also began struggling at school, and after receiving money from her grandmother, Loris (Kate Fitzpatrick), began to pay a friend to write her school essays. After being caught by Susan, Janae announced she would leave school.\n\nJanae, with the help of Steph, secured a job at a garage, but quickly clashed with head mechanic Christine Rodd (Trudy Hellier). Things also came to a head when Janae spotted Chris kissing another woman. Janae eventually supported Chris and helped her come out to her family. After Max ran away following Cameron Robinson’s (Adam Hunter) death, Janae tried to support Boyd. When they were made homeless by the new arrivals at number 30, Janae and Boyd moved back in with Steph and Charlie. Boyd announced he would try and find his father, who he thought might be in Tasmania, where Cameron’s grave is. Janae also managed to knock out neighbour Frazer Yeats(Ben Lawson), with a spanner while practising her skills.\n\nWhen Boyd returned from Tasmania, he kept rejecting Janae. When she confronted him about it, he admitted he had saved a girl, Glenn Forrest (Cleopatra Coleman), from drowning. He also said he had kissed her, and nothing more. Janae took the news surprisingly well, but broke down into tears later that night.\n\nGlenn\n\nAfter finding out that Steph kissed Toadie (Ryan Moloney), Janae was surprised with how well Boyd took it, until she realised that their situation was the same as his in Tasmania when he kissed Glenn.\n\nShe also decided to work for Rex Colt (David Serafin) at another garage, until he almost sexually assaulted her. Luckily, Allan Steiger (Joe Clements) managed to rescue her, but Janae was almost charged for assaulting Rex in an attempt to save herself.\n\nElle revealed that Max was staying with a new family. After deciding to keep it a secret from Boyd, Janae eventually found Max and told him to return. Janae also supported Boyd throughout the break up of his father and Steph.\n\nGlenn has recently arrived in Erinsborough and Boyd realised that he still has feelings for her. When Glenn crashed her car it was revealed that the brakes had been tampered with. It was revealed that it was actually Lolly Allen (Adelaide Kane), who had believed that the car belonged to her abusive stepmother Sandy (Catherine Hill).\n\nJanae gave her husband two weeks to decide who he wanted to be with. She was heartbroken when he chose to be with Glenn and not her.\n\nNed Parker\n\nJanae was horrified to discover that Ned was responsible for drugging Dylan and destroying his relationship with Elle Robinson (Pippa Black), and she and Janelle blackmailed Ned into being their slave. However, Janae eventually forgave Ned and he soon became her boxing coach.\n\nWhen Ned's brother Steve (Steve Bastoni) and his family arrived in Erinsborough, Janae let them store some furniture at her old family house. The onscreen chemistry between Ned and Janae was clear, and after Ned revealed his feelings for her, the two got together. In June 2007, Ned was hit with the news that he has a son with previous girlfriend Kirsten Gannon (Nikola Dubois). His son, Mickey (Fletcher O'Leary), was left by Kirsten in Ned's care and Janae decided to help him to look after the child. Ned then moved in with her and so did Mickey.\n\nIn November 2007 Kirsten began a child custody battle between herself and Ned. She later gave up the fight for Mickey after he himself said he would rather live with his father and let him live with Janae and Ned.\n\nKirsten returned to live in Ramsay Street permanently and got a job in Charlie's. After which Kirsten clashed with Janae, as she claimed she still had feelings for Ned. On the Oakey reunion, Kirsten kissed Ned, although he pushed her away. This caused the feelings of discomfort that Janae had been experiencing to grow, and after a fight over the Timmins' home, she spontaneously kissed Darren Stark. Unfortunately, Kirsten had been watching through the window and began blackmailing Janae, wanting more access to Mickey. Janae eventually told Ned, though he forgave her and they tried to sort their problems out.\n\nAt the welcoming barbecue of Carmella's daughter Chloe, Janae accidentally broadcasted Darren and her mistake when the music suddenly turned off. This led to another fight with Ned, and the breakdown of Libby and Darren's relationship. Janae moved out of the house to go to Steph and Toadie's house for a few days, before her departure. Duroing this timese became very mature for a 19 year old girl, and started to confy a whole lot more in Toadie.\n\nThe Timmins Family Home\n\nJanelle, having moved to Cairns with her new husband Alan Steiger and her children, put her old house up for sale. The current residents, Janae and the Parkers struggled to scrape together funds to buy it. Miranda and Steve planned to club together with Ned and buy it, although Ned assumed that would include Janae. However it did not as their rocky relationship made Miranda and Steve wary of going into a mortgage with Janae. However, the Parkers are going ahead to bid for the house.\n\nDeparture\n\nJanae's relationship with Ned Parker began to tear at the seams shortly after Kirsten arrived. The pair had difficulty keeping a steady relationship, and they soon realised the instability of constant fighting and stress was having a negative effect on Mickey. Janae realised she, although still in love with Ned, had to leave the household in order to provide stability for Mickey and moved to Cairns to be with her family. Ned was against her leaving, but she still went ahead. Unable to let her leave without a proper goodbye, Ned caught her at the airport and the couple shared one last tender kiss before Janae left Ramsay Street.\n\nLater Janae decide to attend a college in Cairns, that she began to study psychology, and be with her family.\n\nAs of 2008 there are no Timmins family members living on Ramsay Street."
