        "text": "[A soft drum-roll is heard.]\n\nMike: [Voice over] Previously, on Big Blogger …\n\n[As Mike continues to give his voice over, we see various clips of footage, from the Housemates going into the House, to each individual eviction. We see snippets of each new Intruder and Special Guest going in to the House, and quick shots of each eviction show with Feral Killmen and a cheering crowd. We see amusing shots of each Friday Night Live mishap, spill and thrill, and a shot of each FNL winner holding their trophy above their head. We see the grouped Housemates on each eviction night sitting on the couch, and we then proceed through the weeks in rapid-fire, watching the group get smaller and smaller until only three Housemates remain.]\n\nMike: [Voice over] Four months ago, twelve Housemates were sent into the Big Blogger House for the first time. Each week, Housemates were given grueling tasks to perform and harsh restrictions to live under. As the weeks went by, Housemates were gradually evicted. Over time, we saw six Intruders, one International Special Guest, and even a formerly evicted Housemate go into the House, bringing the total number of Housemates up to twenty individuals. Eventually, we reached the final week, and nine Housemates were quickly whittled down to the final few. Tonight, only three Housemates remain. Who will win what’s left of the two million dollar prize money? …\n\n[Theme music is heard: \"Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, DUM!\"]\n\nMike: [Voice over] From InYourDreamsWorld on the Mornington Peninsula, this is the 2006 Big Blogger Grand Finale!\n\n[The audience goes wild as a techno beat starts pumping. Lights flash on and off across the stage and a pair of spotlights act more like searchlights as they weave around and around the entire set in excitement. The techno beat begins to build until a laser show starts up, looking very 80s but creating the desired effect because the audience begins to scream like it’s the most amazing thing they’ve ever seen.]\n\n[The gigantic TV screen at the centre-back of the stage shows the Housemates’ faces in order of their evictions, each face changing to each new beat, the audience cheering their personal favourites. Finally, the final three Housemates’ faces appear on screen, and keep flicking back and forth between themselves, with a giant question mark alternating between each of their faces. The music picks up as the faces and question marks flick past faster and faster. The audience gets more and more carried away with its screaming as the excitement continues to build. Finally, the music erupts into the full Big Blogger theme, and the audience reaches a new level of mania as Feral appears at the top of a heretofore-unused flight of stairs at the back of the set. The spotlights immediately find her, and she waves to the roaring crowd.]\n\nMike: [Voice over] And now, please welcome your host, Feral Killmen!\n\nFeral: [Calling out over the cheering audience] Hello everyone!\n\n[The audience screams back at her in a state of delirium, and Feral starts to descend down the staircase, stopping to wave again every two or three steps. The music is still going ballistic and the lights are going mental. Feral eventually reaches the bottom of the stairs and walks to the centre of the stage. The music fades away, the lights calm down, and the audience finally takes a seat … but is asked to put it back.]\n\nFeral: Thank you Mike, hello everybody!\n\n[The audience yells cheerfully back at her, frothing at the mouth.]\n\nFeral: Hello and welcome to Big Blogger’s Grand Finale!\n\n[The audience goes nuts again. It looks like it’s going to be a long night if they keep interrupting her after every sentence.]\n\nFeral: Okay, calm down, calm down. [They don’t.] Alright, that’s enough. [The keep going for another two minutes.] Shut the <BEEP> up! [They ignore her and cheer for an additional three minutes.] Ninja!\n\n[The Big Blogger Ninja runs on with a fire hose and points it at the audience.]\n\nNinja: Who wants to be covered with spray? [The crowd continues to roar. The Ninja turns the nozzle on the end of the hose and sprays the audience with the full power of the fire hose. Audience members are knocked backwards from the force of the blast, and finally stop cheering. Slightly shaken, they stand up again and splutter a bit. They are soaked from head to toe.]\n\nNinja: Awesome! [He scurries off stage.]\n\nFeral: Okay, now that I have your attention, let’s get this party started by crossing live to the House and chatting with our three remaining Housemates.\n\n[Cut to live footage of the final three Housemates sitting together on the couch, all dressed up and nowhere to go. They are all clearly very excited and can’t stop grinning from ear to ear to ear and back again.]\n\nFeral: Hello, House.\n\nHousemates: Aghh! Hello! / Oooh! It’s Feral! / Hey-hey! / etc.\n\n[The audience goes nuts again, cheering uncontrollably throughout the whole interview.]\n\nFeral: How are you feeling?\n\nMelbourneGirl: I’m so <BEEP>in’ nervous, Feral!\n\nFeral: Of course you are.\n\nGav: I’m just amazed that I’m still in here.\n\nEnny: Me too, I don’t understand how an Intruder has lasted this long.\n\nFeral: Well, you’ve all done an outstanding job of being Housemates we’ve loved to love … and hated to love … so why don’t we take a look back at your time in the House.\n\nEnny: Oooh! Cool!\n\n[Cut to a pre-prepared video package, showing different shots of MelbourneGirl, Gav and Enny frolicking about and having a great time over the past four months, slowed down and put to “Wind Beneath My Wings”. We see Enny swimming in the pool as Gav ‘bombs’ into the pool. The water splashes MelbourneGirl, who is sunbathing nearby. She jumps up in fright, screaming angrily at him. Even though she’s moving in slow motion, we can clearly make out what she’s yelling. We see Enny and MelbourneGirl sitting on a bed, doing their nails together and laughing. We see Gav, quite bored on his own, staring at the ceiling and spinning around and around on the spot until he loses his balance and falls over the back of the couch. We see all three of them having dinner outside, making a toast and charging their glasses. We see MelbourneGirl relaxing in the sauna. We see Gav working out furiously in the gym. We see Enny picking bits of bacon out of her salad, a look of disgust on her face. We see MelbourneGirl and Enny hugging and crying as they share a girlie moment. We see Gav watching them hug, rolling his eyes. We see all three of them running around and laughing in the backyard. Enny falls over, perhaps from a lack of protein and energy, and the other two jump on top of her, “stacks-on”-style, and all three laugh themselves silly as the song draws to a close.]\n\n[Cut back to the House, with Feral on the TV screen in the lounge. The audience is going cr-a-zy with heartfelt screams of joy at the collection of Big Blogger moments they have just witnessed.]\n\nMelbourneGirl: [Drying her eye] That was amazing.\n\nEnny: I can’t believe how much fun it’s been in here.\n\nGav: Wow, that’s incredible.\n\nFeral: So tell me, guys – what did you think?\n\n[Pause.]\n\nGav: We just told you.\n\nMelbourneGirl: I thought it was amazing.\n\nEnny: I said it’s been heaps of fun.\n\nGav: And I said it was incredible to see it back like that.\n\nFeral: [Completely missing their irritation with her] That’s great!\n\nBig Blogger: This is Big Blogger.\n\nMelbourneGirl: Oooh!\n\nBig Blogger: There will be an eviction in twenty minutes. That is all.\n\n[The Housemates squeal and gabble at each other in excitement. The audience roars at the announcement.]\n\nFeral: Well, it looks like things are moving along, so we’ll leave you to yourselves for a while, but you’ll be able to watch what’s going on here on the stage, simply by watching this TV screen, okay?\n\nMelbourneGirl: Cool! Thanks, Feral!\n\nGav: This is so exciting.\n\nEnny: Oh, all the best, you guys!\n\nGav: You too.\n\nMelbourneGirl: Best of luck to us all.\n\nGav: Yeah.\n\nEnny: May the best blogger win.\n\n[Beat.]\n\nMelbourneGirl: Who wants a cuppa?\n\n[Cut back to Feral on stage.]\n\nFeral: Okay, well while they’re getting comfortable, how about we introduce our former Housemates one last time, eh?\n\n[The audience cheers its approval.]\n\nFeral: Let’s bring them out here, one at a time, in order of their eviction … or re-eviction, as the case may be. And we begin with a little lady who was one of two people kicked out of the House way back in our very first eviction show! She had one of the briefest stays in the House, but we can’t get enough of her. Please join me in welcoming her back to the stage; it’s No Dramas!\n\n[The audience cheers for No Dramas as the Ninja escorts her onto stage. She takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: Hi No Dramas, how are you?\n\nNo Dramas: Great thanks, Feral!\n\nFeral: What have you been up to since we saw you last?\n\nNo Dramas: Just doing the appearances we’re locked into with our contracts.\n\nFeral: What fun!\n\nNo Dramas: No, not really. But my lawyers advise me that I’m pretty much sewn up with the fine print you guys have written in there.\n\nFeral: Yeah, we’re good like that. [To the audience] And evicted on the same night as No Dramas was this young man, who’s been very busy with his own media commitments since leaving the House. Ladies and gentlemen, it’s John Surname!\n\n[The audience cheers for John Surname as the Ninja escorts him onto stage. He takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: Welcome back, John Surname.\n\nJohn Surname: Thanks, Feral. It’s great to be back. So I can promote my film again.\n\nFeral: Well, maybe later. Tell me, apart from making that short film, have you been having a great time since leaving the Big Blogger House?\n\nJohn Surname: Absolutely. If you replace “Abso-” with “Hell” and “-lutely” with “no”.\n\nFeral: [Not really listening] That’s fantastic. Moving right along, our third evictee is the loving fiancé to one of our final Housemates, and a rabid Collingwood supporter. Between being evicted so early on, and the way the AFL ladder ended up this year, he probably hasn’t been having a very good few months. So let’s make a point of sharing the love with Clokeeeey!\n\n[The audience cheers for Clokeeeey as the Ninja escorts him onto stage. He takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: Good evening, Clokeeeey.\n\nClokeeeey: Hi Feral.\n\nJoffa: [From the crowd] Leave Collingwood alone, ya <BEEP>!\n\nFeral: [To Joffa] Oh goodie. You’re back. [She turns back to Clokeeeey.] So tell me, what’s life been like at home without your beloved MelbourneGirl?\n\nClokeeeey: [The relief clearly showing in his expression] Ohhhhh … bliss.\n\nFeral: You realise she’ll be coming home tonight no matter which way it goes, right?\n\nClokeeeey: [His smile fading] Yeah.\n\nFeral: On to our next evictee. It was a sad night indeed when we had to send this little beacon of light packing from the House. Say hello to LittleFaerieGirl!\n\n[The audience cheers for LittleFaerieGirl as the Ninja escorts her onto stage. She takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: How are you doing, LittleFaerieGirl?\n\nLittleFaerieGirl: Great thanks! [She giggles.]\n\nFeral: Still living in that share house with the other girls?\n\nLittleFaerieGirl: Yep!\n\nFeral: What did you call it, again?\n\nLittleFaerieGirl: Oh, we didn't call it again - we just called it the one time. Since then it’s had the same name.\n\nFeral: [Confused] Um, yes … but what’s the name?\n\nLittleFaerieGirl: The “We All Rule So Suck A Fart Everybody Else” house. Or just “WARSSAFEE” for short.\n\nFeral: “WARSSAFEE”, that’s right. Rolls off the tongue, really, doesn’t it.\n\nLittleFaerieGirl: Depends on whose tongue it is, I guess.\n\nFeral: Um, yes. Ahem. Anyway, one of LittleFaerieGirl’s real-life housemates is the next Big Blogger Housemate evicted. They were evicted on the same night and set up the “WARSSAFEE” house the following week. Let’s bring her out to join us, say hello to Audrey & The Bad Apples!\n\n[The audience cheers for Audrey & The Bad Apples as the Ninja escorts her onto stage. She takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: Greetings, Aud.\n\nAudrey & The Bad Apples: Ooh, I don’t think you’ve ever called me that before.\n\nFeral: I’m just trying to save our website transcribers some time. You’ve got a very long name!\n\nAudrey & The Bad Apples: Yeah, well I told Big Blogger right back at Day One that he could simply call me ‘Audrey’ if he wanted to, but he’s a stickler for doing things ‘properly’.\n\nFeral: [Looking around at the set, which is made entirely from pipecleaners, papier-mâché, old toilet rolls and the hardest-working safety pin in show business] Yeeeeeeeees …\n\nAudrey & The Bad Apples: Still, I’ve been having a great time living with the girls.\n\nFeral: That’s great. So it’s you, LittleFaerieGirl, Dxxxx and Tammiodo, isn’t it?\n\nAudrey & The Bad Apples: That’s right. And it rocks!!\n\nFeral: I’m sure it does. Well, why don’t we get the other girls out here as well. First things first, it’s Dxxxx!\n\n[The audience cheers for Dxxxx as the Ninja escorts her onto stage. She takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: Hey there!\n\nDxxxx: Hey! Wassup?\n\nFeral: Oh, not much. Just doing a little Grand Finale show, you know.\n\nDxxxx: [Sagely] Yeah. [Brightening] Oh, hey! Maybe you could come and live with us in the WARSSAFEE house as well! You can share my room!\n\nFeral: [Taken aback] Um, no … thanks. I’m fine.\n\nDxxxx: Fair enough.\n\nFeral: What have you been up to since we saw you last, Dxxxx?\n\nDxxxx: Well, I just completed my doctorate in nuclear physics two days ago.\n\nFeral: Wow! I didn’t realise you were even studying nuclear physics while you were in the House!\n\nDxxxx: I wasn’t. I felt that I came across as a bit of an airhead in my last Big Blogger appearance, so I went away and enrolled in a three-week intensive crash course.\n\n[Pause.]\n\nFeral: [Truly in awe] My goodness. That’s incredible. I don’t know what to say.\n\n[Dxxxx is beaming with pride. Pause.]\n\nFeral: So … hang on … who offers a three-week intensive crash course to get a doctorate in nuclear physics?!\n\nDxxxx: The Ponds Institute.\n\nFeral: Ah.\n\n[Dxxxx continues to beam, although Feral is now noticeably less impressed.]\n\nFeral: On that note, I’d like to introduce you all to the fourth and final member of the WARSSAFEE house: Tammiodo!\n\n[The audience cheers for Tammiodo as the Ninja escorts her onto stage. She takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: Welcome, Tammiodo!\n\nTammiodo: Thank you very much, Feral. It’s great to see you again.\n\nFeral: Thank you for saying so. Are you still riding the wave of fame since being evicted from the Big Blogger House?\n\nTammiodo: Um, no. Not really. I’ve been a little flat and disinterested of late, actually. Really lathargic and unmotivated and stuff.\n\nFeral: Oh! That’s no good to hear. Maybe it’s just the slump of some sort of post-Big Blogger depression.\n\nTammiodo: [Noncommital] Myeh.\n\nFeral: Or maybe it’s a sign that you’re about to delete your blog and get a life!\n\nTammiodo: [Laughing] Ha! Unlikely!\n\n[They both laugh at the prospect. As if!!]\n\nFeral: [Wiping tears from her eyes] Well, moving right along, we come to a young man who got quite a bit of action, considering the length of time he spent in the House. I speak of course of Big Blogger’s own Casanova, Tyson!\n\n[The audience cheers for Tyson as the Ninja escorts him onto stage. He takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: Hi Tyson.\n\nTyson: G’day Feral.\n\nFeral: What’s it like being the ladies man of the series?\n\nTyson: A little surreal.\n\nFeral: You’re used to working in the theatre, though, aren’t you?\n\nTyson: Yeah …\n\nFeral: So you’d be used to that kind of behaviour from cast parties and the like?\n\nTyson: Hmm, when you put it like that … yeah, it’s pretty normal.\n\nFeral: Excellent. Okay, our next evicted Housemate spent most of his time in the House trying desperately to prevent people from nominating him, but couldn’t do anything about the public’s inevitable decision. Put your hands together for TOBYtoby!\n\n[The audience cheers for TOBYtoby as the Ninja escorts him onto stage. He takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: Hi, TOBYtoby.\n\nTOBYtoby: Hey there, Feral.\n\nFeral: Has the public been any more forgiving of you and your Insider missions since I spoke to you last?\n\nTOBYtoby: Yes.\n\n[Awkward pause. Feral probably expected more from him than this.]\n\nFeral: Well, … that’s good to hear. [Pause.] Is there any reason you’re not talking to me?\n\nTOBYtoby: Free th’ refugees.\n\nFeral: [Under her breath] Oh crap.\n\nTOBYtoby: Free th’ refugees.\n\nFeral: Yes, free th’m. Free th’m all. I get it. Good one. Who’s next? Oh yeah, that’s right. Of all the people whose surnames are Watts, including my <BEEP> of a Year 10 Science teacher, this guy’s in my top five. It’s RichardWatts!\n\n[The audience cheers for RichardWatts as the Ninja escorts him onto stage. He takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: Hello, RichardWatts.\n\nRichardWatts: How ya going, Feral?\n\nFeral: Great, thanks. And you?\n\nRichardWatts: Yeah, I’m ace.\n\nFeral: That’s good. Now, you’ll be pleased to hear I’m not gonna make any sexuality-based references this time, seeing as you got a little miffed about it last time.\n\nRichardWatts: Thank you, Feral. I appreciate that.\n\nFeral: It’s not because you’re ashamed of your sexuality, though, is it.\n\nRichardWatts: Oh goodness me, no. But there’s more to me than just that.\n\nFeral: Of course, of course. [Pause. Neither of them can think of anything to say.]\n\n[Pause continues.]\n\n[The pause is still going. It’s a long pause.]\n\n[Someone at the back of the audience coughs.]\n\n[The pause keeps on keeping on.]\n\nFeral: [Glancing at her watch] Ooh, look at the time. We’d better get a move on. It was nice talking to you again, RichardWatts.\n\nRichardWatts: You too, Feral.\n\nFeral: If you could just slide up the couch a bit, we’re about halfway through the former Housemates, now. [To RichardWatts, as he slides along the couch] Oh, you forgot your handbag.\n\nRichardWatts: Oh yeah, thanks. [He picks it up and slides along the couch.]\n\nFeral: And the colourful temptress who was evicted on the same night as TOBYtoby and RichardWatts joins us next … give a big warm welcome, everyone, to Steph!\n\n[The audience cheers for Steph as the Ninja escorts her onto stage. She takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: Hiya, Steph!\n\nSteph: Hi there!\n\nFeral: What up, yo?\n\nSteph: Oh, just the usual. Pimping myself out to any radio or TV station that’ll have me.\n\nFeral: So no different to a normal Saturday night for you, then?\n\nSteph: [Outraged] Feral! Of course it’s different! [Beat.] It wasn’t radio and TV stations before …\n\nFeral: Good point. Thanks for making that distinction.\n\nSteph: [Looking upwards, as if able to step outside the ‘reality’ of the piece and communicate directly with the writer, somehow] Exactly when did my character degenerate into such a tramp-for-hire?\n\nUnseen Voice: When I was writing this section at 4am and had run out of ideas. Sorry.\n\nSteph: [Sighs] Whatever.\n\nFeral: [Who has missed this brief exchange completely] Well, that’s it for the former Housemates we caught up with last time. We’ve only seen the evicted Housemates that follow, the night they actually were evicted. And it all starts with Elaine!\n\n[The audience cheers for Elaine as the Ninja escorts her onto stage. She takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: Hi Elaine, welcome back to Big Blogger!\n\nElaine: Thanks, Feral. I promised myself I wouldn’t use pirate-talk tonight, so please don’t ask me to.\n\nFeral: I didn’t intend to.\n\nElaine: Oh, alright. You talked me into it. Argh, me hearties!\n\n[The audience goes into a chant for Elaine’s pirate-talk. They love it.]\n\nFeral: Well, that’s quite a reaction.\n\nElaine: You should hear the things people yell out to me on the street.\n\nFeral: Like what?\n\nElaine: I’m not gonna tell you; I said you should hear it!\n\nFeral: I … see …\n\nElaine: Besides, it’s a bit too ‘blue’ for this timeslot / family blog.\n\nFeral: Okay then. No argument here. I just wanted to ask you, though … did you end up hooking up with our Ninja after your eviction show?\n\nElaine: Yeah, but not really. I thought the eye-patch was a fashion accessory he’d put on in my honour, but it turns out he was partially blinded in that eye earlier in the week. And his ‘wooden leg’ didn’t turn out to be half as impressive as he’d claimed.\n\nFeral: So it didn’t work out?\n\nElaine: Nah.\n\nFeral: How disappointing for him.\n\nElaine: [Brightening] Thanks, Feral!\n\nFeral: Our next former Housemate was relatively quiet inside the House, but still managed to create quite a storm … with a bit of help from Steph. Please say hello to Sublime-ation!\n\n[The audience cheers for Sublime-ation as the Ninja escorts her onto stage. She takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: Hello, Sublime-ation.\n\nSublime-ation: Hi Feral.\n\nFeral: How’s the outside world been treating you?\n\nSublime-ation: Okay, I guess. I certainly seem to be a lot better known now that I’m out of the House. This competition has done wonders for me!\n\nFeral: Well, that’s exciting to know! That means we can charge you twice the agents’ fee for any public appearances you make.\n\nSublime-ation: [Her bubble burst] Oh. Great.\n\nFeral: But enough of that. Let’s look at what inspired you to sign up for Big Blogger in the first place.\n\nSublime-ation: Well, it was because I really wanted to get involved in a House that’d do wonders for my self-esteem.\n\nFeral: Getting evicted because the majority of the reading public couldn’t stand you must’ve taken a beating, then!\n\nSublime-ation: [Just realising this now] Yeahhh …\n\nFeral: Nice one. Well, that brings us to our next former Housemate, one who was a bundle of energy that belied her diminutive size. A visitor to our fair shores who’s already enjoyed success in the UK version of Big Blogger. I speak, of course, of Pomgirl.\n\n[The audience cheers for Pomgirl as the Ninja escorts her onto stage. She takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: G’day Pomgirl.\n\nPomgirl: [Trying to imitate an Australian accent – but doing a terrible job, as most non-Australians do] “Guddoy.”\n\nFeral: [Trying to laugh good-naturedly, but her opinion of Pomgirl’s crap imitation shows through clearly] Aha-ha. Ha. Ha. That’s really good.\n\nPomgirl: Thanks, I’m really good at accents. And at acting in general, if there are any talent scouts reading the show.\n\nFeral: There won’t be. I’ve still got this gig, haven’t I?!\n\n[The audience chuckles, but they don’t think Feral’s very funny.]\n\nPomgirl: All I know is I’d like to star in a weekly drama or something.\n\nFeral: Big Blogger wasn’t enough for you?\n\nPomgirl: I have higher aspirations, Feral. I dream of being on Neighbours, or Home & Away, or Hey, Dad!\n\nFeral: Well, all the best with that.\n\nPomgirl: Cheers!\n\nFeral: Moving right along, from a visitor to our country to a visitor to our planet. Well, … sort of … it’s Mars!\n\n[The audience cheers for Mars as the Ninja escorts her onto stage. She takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: Hello, Mars.\n\nMars: Hi Feral.\n\nFeral: I hope you don’t mind that little reference to your name.\n\nMars: Nah, I get it all the time.\n\nFeral: That’s good. So how did you enjoy your Big Blogger experience?\n\nMars: It was cool! I had heaps of fun and met some ace people!\n\nFeral: Who’s been your favourite?\n\nMars: Oh, I couldn’t name favourites.\n\nFeral: Who’s your least favourite, then?\n\nMars: Oh, I couldn’t name least favourites, either.\n\nFeral: So what could you name?\n\nMars: Um … all nine planets?\n\n[Feral just looks at her.]\n\nMars: [Trying to make it sound good] … In order??\n\nFeral: [Flatly] Go on, then.\n\nMas: Ahem. Venus, Mer—\n\nFeral: Bzzzt. Wrong. [Cheerily, to the camera] Okay then, our penultimate former Housemate is probably the one I’ve come to know the best, simply because of all the conversations I had with her each week she was nominated for eviction. Well, she was finally evicted, and here she is: Magical_M!\n\n[The audience cheers for Magical_M as the Ninja escorts her onto stage. She takes a seat on the oversized couch, smiling and waving at the audience.]\n\nFeral: Hello Magical_M, how are you?\n\nMagical_M: I’m hottt, Feral! Remember?!\n\nFeral: Hehe, yes I do. It seemed to be a recurring theme there for a while.\n\nMagical_M: Well, I was recurringly hottt.\n\nFeral: Mmm. So anyway, you’ve only been out of the House now for a few days.\n\nMagical_M: I know! But it feels like two weeks, at least.\n\nFeral: Yeah, there seems to be a bit of that going around. But my question is: Has it had a chance to sink in yet that you were on the Internet’s most loved fake online reality TV show parody?\n\n[There is a pause while Magical_M considers the question.]\n\nMagical_M: Nuh.\n\nFeral: Excellently put.\n\nMagical_M: Thanks!\n\nFeral: And finally – yes, we’re at the end of the list, folks – it’s the former Housemate you hated so much, you evicted him twice! He was Evictee Number 4 but was sent back into the House to become Evictee Number 18 as well. Our most recent evictee who only left the House – for the second time – 48 hours ago, please make him feel welcome: Javatari!\n\n[The audience cheers for Javatari as the Ninja sticks his head out of the wings.]\n\nNinja: He’s not back here!\n\n[Suddenly, Javatari appears from his hiding place, inside the Ninja’s breast pocket.]\n\nJavatari: Shazam!\n\nNinja: Awesome, dude!\n\n[The Ninja escorts Javatari onto stage, and indicates the final spot on the oversized couch. Javatari sits, then turns to smile and wave at the audience. The Ninja leaves the stage, muttering to himself in amazement.]\n\nNinja: I didn’t even know Ninja outfits had a breast pocket! …\n\nFeral: Javatari, I have to begin by asking you if being evicted the second time was any easier than being evicted the first time.\n\nJavatari: Alright. [Pause.] Go on, then. Ask me.\n\nFeral: I just asked you.\n\nJavatari: No you didn’t; you simply informed me of what you wanted to ask me.\n\nFeral: [Sighing heavily; under her breath] I wish we had commercial breaks on this show so I could have even the slightest rest every ten minutes! [To Javatari] Was being evicted the second time any easier than being evicted the first time?\n\nJavatari: Oooh, good question. You’ll have to give me time to think …\n\nFeral: You’ve just had … look, never mind. I think you’re sitting on your magic wand funny. [She indicates the bulge in his pants pocket.]\n\nJavatari: [Looking down; embarrassed] Um, yes … my magic wand … thank you. [He adjusts it hurriedly.]\n\nFeral: [Closing her eyes and rubbing her forehead as if she can feel a headache coming on] Oh good grief. [Loudly, to the audience] Ladies and gentlemen, I give you your evicted Big Blogger Housemates for 2006!\n\n[The audience goes ballistic with excitement and applause for the former Housemates. The applause dies down after about 90 seconds.]\n\nFeral: [Addressing the former Housemates] Well, now that you’re all gathered here together on stage and you’ve just finished settling in on this massively-oversized couch, I’m going to get you to get up and go backstage again to prepare for your big musical number.\n\n[The audience goes “Oooooh!”]\n\nFeral: That’s right, the evicted Housemates have been rehearsing together for the past few days to bring you a spectacular presentation that will hopefully impress you all. But not before we evict our second runner-up. So you guys go and get changed, and we’ll see you very soon.\n\n[The audience cheers and applauds as the former Housemates exit the stage, smiling and waving at the crowd as they go.]\n\nFeral: While they’re back there getting ready, and just before we cross to the House to evict the first of tonight’s runners-up, let’s have one last look back at the Housemates’ time in the Big Blogger House. If you’ve wondered what it’s been like for the final three in that big, empty House on their own, here’s your chance to find out! We’ve put together a small package of today’s events. Here’s what happened on the Housemates’ final day:\n\n[Cut to footage of the House. MelbourneGirl, Enny and Gav are sitting on the stools in the kitchen, eating their breakfast at the kitchen bench.]\n\nEnny: What do you guys want to do today?\n\nGav: I dunno. What can we do?\n\nMelbourneGirl: I wanna break into the Rewards Room!\n\nEnny: Yeah! And see if there’s any chocolate or alcohol left in there!\n\nGav: Actually, that’d be cool.\n\nMelbourneGirl: I reckon we’d probably get fined again, though.\n\nGav: Hmm.\n\n[Pause.]\n\nMelbourneGirl: Maybe we can just sit outside in the sun and have a quiet one?\n\nEnny: Yeah … work on our tans.\n\n[Gav rolls his eyes as if to say, “Again?”]\n\nMelbourneGirl: I could make us all a cup of tea!\n\nEnny: You sure drink a lot of tea, MelbourneGirl.\n\nMelbourneGirl: Not really. I usually just make it for everyone else.\n\nGav: Hey, I just had a thought. Whatever happened to the Big Blogger Farm?\n\n[There is a pause. Cut to the three Housemates prying open the secret door in the backyard that leads to the enclosed Big Blogger Farm. We do not see inside, but we watch the expressions on their faces. MelbourneGirl looks distraught. Enny looks disgusted. Gav looks horrified.]\n\nEnny: Oh, yuck! [She turns away with a hand to her mouth, as if to prevent herself from vomiting.]\n\nMelbourneGirl: <BEEP>ing <BEEP>! Those poor <BEEP>in’ animals. Big Blogger is such a <BEEP> for letting this happen to them. Who was meant to be looking after the <BEEP>in’ things?!?\n\nGav: Help me close this door. I think it’s broken.\n\nBig Blogger: This is Big Blogger. MelbourneGirl. For calling Big Blogger “a <BEEP>”, that’s a five thousand dollar fine.\n\nMelbourneGirl: Well it’s true! [She points into the Big Blogger Farm.] Look in there! Who's responsible for that?!\n\nBig Blogger: [Ignoring her] Gav. For the destruction of Big Blogger property, that’s a five thousand dollar fine. That is all.\n\nGav: [Under his breath] Piece of <BEEP>.\n\nBig Blogger: What did you say?\n\nGav: I said, “Peace be with you.”\n\nBig Blogger: And also with you. That is all. [Beat.] Again.\n\nEnny: [Who is on her hands and knees, her head in the bushes of the garden] Can someone get me a facecloth?\n\nMelbourneGirl: I will.\n\nEnny: And a glass of water.\n\nMelbourneGirl: I’ll get you a cuppa.\n\n[Cut to later. The Housemates are lying on deckchairs in the backyard, their backs to the jammed-open doorway to the Big Blogger Farm.]\n\nGav: I wonder when this is gonna end.\n\nEnny: I reckon either today or tomorrow.\n\nMelbourneGirl: What day is it? Friday?\n\nGav: Yep.\n\nEnny: I think so.\n\nMelbourneGirl: I reckon Sunday or Monday. That’s when they usually end these things, right?\n\nGav: Hmm, maybe.\n\nEnny: [To Gav] When do you think it’ll end?\n\nGav: I agree with you. Today or tomorrow. [Pause.] Or Sunday or Monday. Or one day next week. [He grins as Enny throws a cushion at him.]\n\nEnny: Cop out!\n\n[They all laugh.]\n\n[Cut to later in the day. The Housemates are enjoying a spa together.]\n\nMelbourneGirl: I can’t believe it’s been so long since I’ve seen Clokeeeey.\n\nGav: What’s the longest time you guys have been apart, before Big Blogger?\n\nMelbourneGirl: About ten hours.\n\nEnny: No way!!\n\nGav: You serious?\n\nMelbourneGirl: Yep.\n\nEnny: In how long?\n\nMelbourneGirl: Ohhh, … about … three years.\n\nGav: You’ve GOT to be kidding.\n\nMelbourneGirl: Nope, I’m being 100% honest.\n\nEnny: How could you cope without seeing him this long?!\n\nGav: Forget that; how could you cope living out of each others’ back pockets so much?!\n\nMelbourneGirl: It really wasn’t so bad; we’re perfect for each other, so it was never a hassle. As for how I’ve coped going this long without him, … that’s been pretty tough.\n\nEnny: You haven’t shown it!\n\nMelbourneGirl: Plot device.\n\nEnny: Huh?\n\nMelbourneGirl: Retcon.\n\nEnny: What are you talking about?\n\nMelbourneGirl: MacGuffin.\n\nEnny: Who’s that? MG, I don’t understand what you’re saying.\n\nGav: Don’t worry about it, Enny. It’s not important.\n\n[Cut to later in the day. The Housemates are seated at the dining room table, eating an early dinner.]\n\nGav: This is great, MG. Thanks for cooking.\n\nEnny: Yeah – thanks, MG!\n\nMelbourneGirl: That’s alright. I hope it tastes okay. We’re pretty much out of everything, so I had to use whatever I could find lying around.\n\nEnny: [Stops eating; looking cautious] Do I want to know?\n\nMelbourneGirl: No.\n\n[Enny continues eating. Gav looks at MelbourneGirl questioningly. MelbourneGirl looks out the window meaningfully, at the still-ajar door to the Big Blogger Farm. Gav laughs. MelbourneGirl looks down at her food, smirking. Enny looks up at them, confused by their smiles and laughter, but neither of them catch her eye.]\n\n[Cut to later in the day. The Housemates are in the kitchen, washing and drying their dishes from dinner.]\n\nBig Blogger: This is Big Blogger.\n\nEnny: Oooohh! It’s happening!\n\nBig Blogger: Housemates. You have ten minutes to be seated on the couch in the lounge. That is all.\n\nGav: This is it.\n\nMelbourneGirl: Ooh goodie, ooh goodie, ooh goodie!\n\nEnny: [Scraping some leftovers into the bin] Hey, what’s this? [She picks a lamb’s skull out of the bin. It is partly stripped of meat and looks quite gory. She looks at the others accusingly while they pretend to be innocent bystanders.] I think I’m gonna be sick.\n\n[Cut back to Feral on stage. The audience is going wild.]\n\nFeral: Well, there you have it: The final 24 hours in the Big Blogger House! And now it’s time to end the dream for one of our final three Housemates. They’ve all done a magnificent job, but only one of them can win. And before we get to that announcement, we have to evict one last unlucky soul who came so close, and yet not close enough.\n\n[Cut to the House, where the three final Housemates are still seated on the couch.]\n\nFeral: Hello, House.\n\nHousemates: Oh boy / Here we go, huh? / Hi Feral / etc.\n\nFeral: Are you ready for this?\n\nGav: No!\n\nEnny: Not really.\n\nFeral: Well, unfortunately you don’t get an option.\n\nMelbourneGirl: Far out, this is stressful!\n\nFeral: I’m being handed the envelope now, so whoever’s name I read out will be our third-place winner for Big Blogger 2006. Okay. Here we go. It’s time to go … [Camera pans across the Housemates’ faces extremely slowly.] It’s time to go, Enny!\n\n[The audience gasps. The Housemates react in surprise and shock.]\n\nMelbourneGirl: Oh no! [She bursts into tears.]\n\nEnny: Don’t cry, MG! It’s alright!\n\nGav: I’m so sorry, Enny. [They hug.]\n\nEnny: Don’t worry about it. Seriously! I’m fine. I’ve had a great time.\n\nMelbourneGirl: [Crying] Mwhahahahahahahahahaha. [They hug.]\n\nEnny: I know, sweetie. I know.\n\nBig Blogger: This is Big Blogger. Enny, you have been avicted. You have ten seconds to leave the House.\n\nEnny: Yes sir!\n\nBig Blogger: Enny. For calling Big Blogger “sir”, that’s a five thousand dollar fine.\n\nEnny: You’ve got to be kidding me.\n\nGav: Don’t worry about that, babe. Focus on what a great job you did! You came all the way through to the final three! Probably the final day!\n\nEnny: Yeah, I know. Congratulations to all of us, hey?\n\nMelbourneGirl: [Crying] Wemewemeweme-huh-uh-uh-uhhhhh.\n\nEnny: That’s right, darling, I know.\n\nBig Blogger: This is Big Blogger. Enny, you have been avicted. You must leave the House ammediately.\n\nEnny: No wuckas. Listen, guys. I don’t care who wins; you’re both ace people and it’s been great getting to know you. Have a great time in here for however long’s left, and I’ll see you real soon! [She hugs them both again, then walks up to the Diary Room door. She steps through the doorway and the door closes behind her, while MelbourneGirl and Gav wave and call out encouraging things to her, like “Way to go!” and “On ya!”]\n\n[Cut back to Feral on stage.]\n\nFeral: Well! That’s certainly an upset for the books!\n\nNinja: [From offstage] Aww, CRAP!\n\nFeral: While Enny makes her way up here, let’s take a look at a collection of “Best Of” moments from the Adults Only special that never went to air.\n\n[Cut to a series of clips featuring the Housemates in various states of undress, having crude conversations as a group, and getting up to completely un-PG-rated shenanigans with each other, all set to “The Bad Touch” by the Bloodhound Gang.]\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n<CENSORED>\n\n[Cut back to Feral on stage. She is fanning herself and the audience is cheering the clips they have just seen, but also clearly need a glass of water and a lie down.]\n\nFeral: Well! It’s a wonder the Housemates ever provided us with enough footage to use in our regular timeslot!\n\n[The audience laughs.]\n\nFeral: But in any event, we’re now ready to bring our most recent evictee out on stage. Here she is, everybody; Enny!\n\n[The audience goes crazy, cheering like madmen and evenmadderwomen. Enny walks down the gangplank and greets Feral on stage.]\n\nEnny: Hey there! [She hugs Feral.]\n\nFeral: Hello! How do you feel?\n\nEnny: Amazing! This is amazing!\n\n[The audience bursts into further fits of applause.]\n\nFeral: Well, for an Intruder, you certainly lasted the distance! The winner of Big Blogger will be announced tonight!\n\nEnny: Oh wow, this is so intense! I think I’m going to faint!\n\nFeral: Well, you’ve done very well, so congratulations for making it all the way to the final da—\n\nEnny: No, really. I’m going to faint. Must be the fact that I don’t eat anything. Or that I’ve just eaten meat for the first time in years. [She slumps over a little on the couch.]\n\nFeral: Well, take it easy. I’ll get someone to make you a milkshake or something.\n\nEnny: No milk.\n\nFeral: Er, … of course not.\n\nEnny: Phew! I’m feeling a bit better now. I think I just needed a moment. [She sits up straight again.]\n\nFeral: Boy, you had me scared for a minute, there. Maybe you should eat more eggs or something, for protein. [Enny just looks at her.] Oh, right – no eggs. Well, anyway, I was just congratulating you on coming so far as an Intruder.\n\nEnny: Thank you, yes.\n\nFeral: And clearly the crowd loves you.\n\n[The audience roars its support of all things Enny.]\n\nEnny: [Raising her hands in triumph to the audience] Woo! Yeah!\n\nFeral: But obviously not as much as they love the last two remaining Housemates.\n\n[The audience cheers even more loudly than they did a moment ago, and Enny’s face drops. She quickly picks it up and puts it back on again.]\n\nFeral: Now, ordinarily this would be the part where I told you you’ll be on Uplate with Mike Goldentonsils later tonight, but because tonight’s the Grand Finale, that won’t be happening. So you’ve been spared that little injustice.\n\nEnny: Saints be praised!\n\nFeral: Instead, I get to give you your prizes.\n\nEnny: Yee-haw!\n\nFeral: Goodness me you’re an excitable one, aren’t you!\n\nEnny: I’m just so happy to have been a part of this great adventure, Feral.\n\nFeral: Anyway, here are your prizes: A 450 gram can of tomatoes, diced, and a two-year-old map of Ballarat and the surrounding districts.\n\nEnny: So pretty much any old crap you could find lying around, huh?\n\nFeral: You got it. But that’s not all! As you made it to the final three, you get an extra prize for your troubles: An official Big Blogger scarf, as worn here by our Big Blogger Model! Come on out, Bambi!\n\n[Bambi, the heretofore unseen, unheard and unmentioned Big Blogger Model, walks on stage wearing the official Big Blogger scarf, walks up and down the catwalk, turns on the spot to show off the scarf from all angles, and then walks back into the wings.]\n\nFeral: As you can see, it’s abnormally long and unwieldy, causing all manner of tripping and choking hazards, I’m sure.\n\nEnny: Yeah …\n\nFeral: So look out for that.\n\nEnny: Thanks. I’m … um … speechless.\n\nFeral: Good to hear, because we don’t have time for you to make a speech. Please thank her again, ladies and gentlemen: Your Big Blogger Second Runner-Up and Evictee Number 19, Enny!\n\n[The audience applauds and cheers as Enny waves and leaves the stage.]\n\nFeral: Let’s cut back to the House to see how our final two Housemates are fairing.\n\n[Cut to the House. MelbourneGirl is returning to the couch with two cups of tea. She hands one to Gav, who is too excited to drink from it. They are clearly very nervous and don’t know what to say or do.]\n\nBig Blogger: This is Big Blogger.\n\nMelbourneGirl: Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap.\n\nGav: This is it.\n\nBig Blogger: The winner of Big Blogger 2006 will be announced in fifteen minutes.\n\nGav: Aww!\n\nMelbourneGirl: This is too much! It’s so stressful! I can’t bear it.\n\nGav: Just relax. Not long now.\n\nMelbourneGirl: Oh boy. I need another <BEEP>in’ cup of tea to settle my nerves.\n\nGav: Let me make it for you. [He gets up and walks into the kitchen.]\n\nMelbourneGirl: [Calling after him] And fill it three-quarters of the way with whisky, will you?\n\n[Cut back to Feral on stage.]\n\nFeral: Okay, well, they’re doing okay, and we know that the big announcement is only minutes away. But now, the moment you’ve all been waiting for. This would have to be the most anticipated, most exciting, most ridiculously over-explained all-dancing, all-singing musical number that’s ever been written out in description-form, ever! That’s right, please welcome back to the stage your former Housemates, to perform a musical review for your entertainment pleasure! I give you … the Big Blogger 2006 Housemates!\n\n[The audience goes wild as Feral makes her way off stage. The lights go low and smoke fills the auditorium. A hush falls over the crowd and not a sound can be heard as the seconds tick by. The suspense is building. Finally, a low hum can be heard on the edge of forever. Then a piano chord is played, and a guitar riff follows closely behind. The audience instantly recognises the tune, and excitement leads them to cheer as the familiar strains of Robbie Williams’ “Let Me Entertain You” begin to fill the auditorium. Spotlights whip around the stage, illuminating the smoke and excitement. So far no one is on stage.]\n\nRobbie Williams: [Music track] Hell is gone and heaven's here / There's nothing left for you to fear / Shake your arse come over here / Now scream / I'm a burning effigy / Of everything I used to be / You're my rock of empathy / My dear.\n\n[During the above lyrics, the Housemates run on stage one by one through the centre split of a large curtain at the back of the stage that depicts the Big Blogger logo. The Housemates are all dressed in wild and crazy costumes, and they dance around the stage until they’re all standing in their own little section, facing the audience. They enter in order of eviction, starting with No Dramas, then John Surname, Clokeeeey, LittleFaerieGirl, Audrey & The Bad Apples, Dxxxx, Tammiodo, Tyson, TOBYtoby, RichardWatts, Steph, Elaine, Sublime-ation, Pomgirl, Mars, Magical_M and finally Javatari, who stands centre-stage, wrapping his cape around him as the beat builds into the chorus.]\n\nRobbie Williams: [Music track] So c’mon, let meeee-eeeee entertain you!\n\n[Each Housemate, left to right across the stage, strikes a different individual pose in rapid-fire between the first two lines of Robbie’s chorus.]\n\nRobbie Williams: [Music track] Let meeee-eeeee entertain you!\n\n[Each Housemate, right to left across the stage, strikes another individual pose in rapid-fire before the next verse starts.]\n\nRobbie Williams: [Music track] Life's too short for you to die / So grab yourself an alibi / Heaven knows your mother lied / Mon cher.\n\n[As one, each Housemate strikes an identical pose, head down, right fist extended up in the air, left hand by their side, feet spaced shoulder-length apart. They are lit only by a spotlight directly above each of them, casting their faces in shadow and an eerie look to the group as a whole.]\n\nRobbie Williams: [Music track] Separate your right from wrongs / Come and sing a different song / The kettle's on so don't be long / Mon cher.\n\n[During the guitar riff that falls between the second verse and the chorus, the Housemates spring to life and run in a giant circle around the stage, ending up spread out in a straight line across the entire length of the back of the stage. They sway from side to side, clicking their right hands and miming along to the words.]\n\nRobbie Williams: [Music track] So c’mon, let meeee-eeeee entertain you! / Let meeee-eeeee entertain you!\n\n[The music segues into another song, the lights dim, and the Housemates freeze. We can now see each Housemate in silhouette only.]\n\nShania Twain: [Music track, spoken] Let’s go, girls!\n\n[As the opening chords of “Man, I Feel Like A Woman” are played, the audience goes wild and the female Housemates walk forward from the line in time to the music and stand across the front of the stage. The male Housemates remain frozen in silhouette. As the song begins and the first two verses are played, the female Housemates mime along, pointing out at the audience and giving off a whole lotta attitude. The audience is loving it.]\n\nShania Twain: [Music track] I'm going out tonight / I'm feelin' alright / Gonna let it all hang out / Wanna make some noise / Really raise my voice / Yeah, I wanna scream and shout / No inhibitions / Make no conditions / Get a little outta line / I ain't gonna act politically correct / I only wanna have a good time.\n\n[The female Housemates all run into the middle of centre stage, surrounding Magical_M who has the middle position. No Dramas and Steph get down on one knee and slide right in front of the others, while Mars and Sublime-ation lift Pomgirl and Audrey & The Bad Apples up on their shoulders. They all mime the chorus together, reveling in the attention they are getting from the delighted audience.]\n\nShania Twain: [Music track] The best thing about being a woman / Is the prerogative to have a little fun (fun, fun) / Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy / Forget I'm a lady / Men's shirts / Short skirts / Oh, oh, oh, really go wild / Yeah, doin' it in style / Oh, oh, oh, get in the action / Feel the attraction / Colour my hair / Do what I dare / Oh, oh, oh, I wanna be free / Yeah, to feel the way I feel / Man! I feel like a woman!\n\n[The female Housemates freeze in their final “Girl Power” pose as the song segues into another, at-first-unidentifiable song. The lights cut, and the girls run back to their positions in silhouette along the back of the stage. The boys unfreeze, and slowly make their way towards the front of the stage, moving to the beat. The audience soon recognises the song as Mötley Crüe’s “Girls, Girls, Girls”. They deliver just as much attitude as the female Housemates as they mime along in true hard rock fashion, slicking their hair back and doing their best to channel band members Vince Neil, Tommy Lee, Nikki Sixx and Mick Mars.]\n\nVince Neil: [Music track] Friday night and I need a fight / My motorcycle and a switchblade knife / Handful of grease in my hair feels right / But what I need to make me tight are …\n\n[The male Housemates cut fully sick, jumping around and playing air guitar and lying down on their backs and ‘crab walking’ along the stage. The audience is cheering them on, literally beside themselves with joy (it was “Bring Your Twin” night).]\n\nVince Neil: [Music track] Girls, Girls, Girls / Long legs and burgundy lips / Girls / Dancin' down on Sunset Strip / Girls / Red lips, fingertips.\n\n[Clokeeeey bursts into an air guitar solo as the other male Housemates crowd around him and gaze adoringly at his magnificent playing skills. The audience lifts the game a bit by screaming for Clokeeeey like he’s a real rock star. As the air guitar solo comes to an end, the male Housemates return to their line across the front of the stage and mime to the next chorus.]\n\nVince Neil: [Music track] Girls, Girls, Girls / At the Dollhouse in Fort Lauderdale / Girls, Girls, Girls / Rocking in Atlanta at Tattletails / Girls, Girls, Girls / Raising Hell at the 7th Veil / Have you read the news / In the Soho Tribune / Ya know she did me / Well then she broke my heart / Girls, Girls, Girls!\n\n[The music comes to a crashing halt as the lights go out on stage. In the darkness, the male Housemates return to the back of the stage and take up their positions in silhouette with the female Housemates. Unseen by the audience, Magical_M moves forward to centre stage, and three spotlights turn on her at once. In the same beat, she turns to the audience and mimes to a Billy Idol classic, making the audience wet itself with excitement.]\n\nBilly Idol: [Music track] Hottt in the city / Hottt in the city tonight / Tonight!\n\n[Magical_M dances around the stage on her own, finishing back in the centre stage spot where she grabs the men’s business shirt she’s wearing, rips it open (buttons flying everywhere) and reveals the Bonds shirt underneath. Printed on the shirt are the words: DANCE CAPTAIN. The audience roars its approval at her excellent choreography work. As the song builds to the chorus, Magical_M pulls out all manner of 80s dancing moves, suiting her get-up (which includes fluorescent pink leg warmers), and turning the audience into a frenzied mob.]\n\nBilly Idol: [Music track] Stranger … / Stranger … / For all the dreams and schemes / People are as they seem / On a hot summer night / Don’t be no fun / Don’t forget you’re young / On a hot summer night / A sometime someone you’re not / Don’t wait to see what you got / ‘Cause you know that you’re / Hottt in the city / Hottt in the city tonight / Tonight / Don’t you know that you’re / Hottt in the city / Hottt in the city tonight / Tonight! / Tonight! / Tonight! / Hottt … hottt … hottt!\n\n[Magical_M freezes and the spotlights cut. Immediately, on stage left, another spotlight comes on and finds Dxxxx, ready to rock. She is also wearing 80s dance fashion, and as Cyndi Lauper comes on over the sound system, Dxxxx begins to mime the words with great enthusiasm.]\n\nCyndi Lauper: [Music track] The phone rings in the middle of the night / My father yells \"What you gonna do with your life?\" / Oh, Daddy, dear / You know you're still number one / But girls / They wanna have fu-un / Oh, girls / Just wanna have …\n\n[Dxxxx is rubbing her hands all over her body in time to the music, and despite (or perhaps because of) the nature of the song – and of Dxxxx herself – the men in the audience are cheering louder than anyone.]\n\nCyndi Lauper: [Music track] That's all they really want / Some fun / When the working day is done / Oh, girls / They wanna have fu-un / Oh, girls / Just wanna have fun.\n\n[The lights cut again and Dxxxx disappears. Simultaneously, a spotlight comes on over on stage right, revealing Tyson sitting at a piano, pretending to play along with the Billy Joel song that starts playing.]\n\nBilly Joel: [Music track] It’s nine o’clock on a Saturday / The regular crowd shuffles in / There’s an old man sitting next to me / Makin’ love to his tonic and gin / He says, “Son, can you play me a memory? / I’m not really sure how it goes / But it’s sad and it’s sweet and I knew it complete / When I wore a younger man’s clothes.”\n\n[Then the audience joins in as Tyson reaches the really well-known part.]\n\nBilly Joel: [Music track] La la la, de de da / La la, de de da da / Dahhhh / Sing us a song, you’re the piano man / Sing us a song tonight / Well, we’re all in the mood for a melody / And you’ve got us feelin’ alright.\n\n[As the spotlight on Tyson disappears, we hear the sound effect of someone quickly and carelessly pulling the needle off a record. It’s the international audio symbol for “hurried and forced silence”. After a second, Björk’s voice can be heard ]\n\nBjörk: [Music track] It’s / Oh / So / Quiet.\n\n[The lights come up on Sublime-ation, who is standing centre stage in a tiny spotlight, which only surrounds her head. For the moment, we are unable to see the rest of her. The spotlight gradually widens as she mimes to the slow-paced opening verse of the song.]\n\nBjörk: [Music track] It’s oh / So still / You’re all alone / And peaceful until …\n\n[Just as the song goes crazy, the spotlight finishes widening and we see that Sublime-ation is wearing a fake swan as a dress, Björk-style. Sublime-ation begins to go nuts, miming to the song and staying true to its nutty singer.]\n\nBjörk: [Music track] You fall in love / Zing, boom / The sky up above / Zing, boom / Is caving in / Wow, bam! / You've never been so nuts about a guy / You wanna laugh you wanna cry / You cross your heart and hope to die!\n\n[At this point, Sublime-ation steps in front of a backdrop, made to look like a park or backyard. There is grass all around and a fake tree in the middle of the very realistic-looking painting. Stepping behind a curtain for a second, she re-appears wearing a green T-shirt and long blue floral skirt, is handed a piano accordion, and begins to play. Lo-and-behold, Sublime-ation’s pet goat appears from side stage, and joins her for the rest of the number. The goat, “Nanny”, is a black goat that wears a black T-shirt, and stands up on its hind legs as Sublime-ation continues to play and mime along to the Björk song.]\n\nBjörk: [Music track] 'Til it's over and then / It's nice and quiet / But soon again / Starts another big riot / You blow a fuse / Zing, boom / The devil cuts loose / Zing, boom / So what's the use / Wow, bam! / Of falling in love?"
