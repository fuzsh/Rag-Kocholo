        "text": "The impact of APOA5, APOB, APOC3 and ABCA1 gene polymorphisms on ischemic stroke: Evidence from a meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAu, Anthony; Griffiths, Lyn R; Irene, Looi; Kooi, Cheah Wee; Wei, Loo Keat\n\n2017-10-01\n\nGenetic studies have been reported on the association between APOA5, APOB, APOC3 and ABCA1 gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke, but results remain controversial. Hence, this meta-analysis aimed to infer the causal relationships of APOA5 (rs662799, rs3135506), APOB (rs693, rs1042031, rs1801701), APOC3 (rs4520, rs5128, rs2854116, rs2854117) and ABCA1 rs2230806 with ischemic stroke risk. A systematic review was performed for all the articles retrieved from multiple databases, up until March 2017. Data were extracted from all eligible studies, and meta-analysis was carried out using RevMan 5.3 and R package 3.2.1. The strength of association between each studied polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk was measured as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), under fixed- and random-effect models. A total of 79 studies reporting on the association between the studied polymorphisms and ischemic stroke risk were identified. The pooled data indicated that all genetic models of APOA5 rs662799 (ORsÂ =Â 1.23-1.43), allelic and over-dominant models of APOA5 rs3135506 (ORsÂ =Â 1.77-1.97), APOB rs1801701 (ORsÂ =Â 1.72-2.13) and APOB rs1042031 (ORsÂ =Â 1.66-1.88) as well as dominant model of ABCA1 rs2230806 (ORÂ =Â 1.31) were significantly associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke. However, no significant associations were observed between ischemic stroke and the other five polymorphisms, namely ApoB (rs693) and APOC3 (rs4520, rs5128, rs2854116 and rs2854117), under any genetic model. The present meta-analysis confirmed a significant association of APOA5 rs662799 CC, APOA5 rs3135506 CG, APOB rs1801701Â GA, APOB rs1042031Â GA and ABCA1 rs2230806Â GG with increased risk of ischemic stroke.

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer MPA induced ABCA1 and LXR{alpha} protein expression in HepG2 cells. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer PPAR{gamma} antagonist GW9662 markedly inhibited MPA-induced ABCA1 and LXR{alpha} protein expression. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The effect of MPA upregulating ABCA1 was due mainly to activation of the PPAR{gamma}-LXR{alpha}-ABCA1 pathway. -- Abstract: ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) promotes cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from cells to lipid-poor apolipoprotein A-I and plays an important role in atherosclerosis. In a previous study, we developed a high-throughput screening method using an ABCA1p-LUC HepG2 cell line to find upregulators of ABCA1.moreÂ Â» Using this method in the present study, we found that mycophenolic acid (MPA) upregulated ABCA1 expression (EC50 = 0.09 {mu}M). MPA upregulation of ABCA1 expression was confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis in HepG2 cells. Previous work has indicated that MPA is a potent agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR{gamma}; EC50 = 5.2-9.3 {mu}M). Liver X receptor {alpha} (LXR{alpha}) is a target gene of PPAR{gamma} and may directly regulate ABCA1 expression. Western blot analysis showed that MPA induced LXR{alpha} protein expression in HepG2 cells. Addition of PPAR{gamma} antagonist GW9662 markedly inhibited MPA-induced ABCA1 and LXR{alpha} protein expression. These data suggest that MPA increased ABCA1 expression mainly through activation of PPAR{gamma}. Thus, the effects of MPA on upregulation of ABCA1 expression were due mainly to activation of the PPAR{gamma}-LXR{alpha}-ABCA1 signaling pathway. This is the first report that the antiatherosclerosis activity of MPA is due to this mechanism.Â«Â less\n\nPPAR{gamma} activates ABCA1 gene transcription but reduces the level of ABCA1 protein in HepG2 cells\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMogilenko, Denis A., E-mail: denis@iem.sp.ru; Department of Embryology, St. Petersburg State University, 199034 St. Petersburg; Shavva, Vladimir S.\n\nResearch highlights: {yields} PPAR{gamma} activates ABCA1 gene expression but decreases ABCA1 protein content in human hepatoma cell line HepG2. {yields} Treatment of HepG2 cells with PPAR{gamma} agonist GW1929 leads to dissociation of LXR{beta} from ABCA1-LXR{beta} complex. {yields} Inhibition of protein kinases MEK1/2 abolishes PPAR{gamma}-mediated dissociation of LXR{beta} from ABCA1/LXR{beta} complex. {yields} Activation of PPAR{gamma} leads to increasing of the level of LXR{beta} associated with LXRE within ABCA1 gene promoter. -- Abstract: Synthesis of ABCA1 protein in liver is necessary for high-density lipoproteins (HDL) formation in mammals. Nuclear receptor PPAR{gamma} is known as activator of ABCA1 expression, but details of PPAR{gamma}-mediatedmoreÂ Â» regulation of ABCA1 at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in hepatocytes have not still been well elucidated. In this study we have shown, that PPAR{gamma} activates ABCA1 gene transcription in human hepatoma cells HepG2 through increasing of LXR{beta} binding with promoter region of ABCA1 gene. Treatment of HepG2 cells with PPAR{gamma} agonist GW1929 leads to dissociation of LXR{beta} from ABCA1/LXR{beta} complex and to nuclear translocation of this nuclear receptor resulting in reduction of ABCA1 protein level 24 h after treatment. Inhibition of protein kinases MEK1/2 abolishes PPAR{gamma}-mediated dissociation of LXR{beta} from ABCA1/LXR{beta} complex, but does not block PPAR{gamma}-dependent down-regulation of ABCA1 protein in HepG2 cells. These data suggest that PPAR{gamma} may be important for regulation of the level of hepatic ABCA1 protein and indicate the new interplays between PPAR{gamma}, LXR{beta} and MEK1/2 in regulation of ABCA1 mRNA and protein expression.Â«Â less\n\nPurification and ATPase activity of human ABCA1.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakahashi, Kei; Kimura, Yasuhisa; Kioka, Noriyuki; Matsuo, Michinori; Ueda, Kazumitsu\n\n2006-04-21\n\nATP-binding cassette protein A1 (ABCA1) plays a major role in cholesterol homeostasis and high density lipoprotein metabolism. Apolipoprotein A-I binds to ABCA1 and cellular cholesterol and phospholipids, mainly phosphatidylcholine, are loaded onto apoA-I to form pre-beta high density lipoprotein (HDL). It is proposed that ABCA1 translocates phospholipids and cholesterol directly or indirectly to form pre-beta HDL. To explore the mechanism of ABCA1-mediated pre-beta HDL formation, we expressed human ABCA1 in insect Sf9 cells and purified it. Trypsin limited-digestion of purified ABCA1 in the detergent-soluble form suggested that it retained conformation similar to ABCA1 expressed in the membranes of human fibroblast WI-38 cells. Purified ABCA1 showed robust ATPase activity when reconstituted in liposomes made of synthetic phosphatidylcholine. ABCA1 showed lower ATPase activity when reconstituted in liposomes containing phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, or phosphatidylglycerol and also showed weak specificity in acyl chain species. ATPase activity was reduced by the addition of cholesterol and decreased by 25% in the presence of 20% cholesterol. Beta-sitosterol and campesterol showed similar inhibitory effects but stigmasterol did not, suggesting structure-specific interaction between ABCA1 and sterols. Glibenclamide suppressed ABCA1 ATPase, suggesting that it inhibits apoA-I-dependent cellular cholesterol efflux by suppressing ABCA1 ATPase activity. These results suggest that the ATPase activity of ABCA1 is stimulated preferentially by phospholipids with choline head groups, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. This study with purified human ABCA1 provides the first biochemical basis of the mechanism for HDL formation mediated by ABCA1.\n\nIntestinal ABCA1 directly contributes to HDL biogenesis in vivo\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBrunham, Liam R.; Kruit, Janine K.; Iqbal, Jahangir; Fievet, Catherine; Timmins, Jenelle M.; Pape, Terry D.; Coburn, Bryan A.; Bissada, Nagat; Staels, Bart; Groen, Albert K.; Hussain, M. Mahmood; Parks, John S.; Kuipers, Folkert; Hayden, Michael R.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nPlasma HDL cholesterol levels are inversely related to risk for atherosclerosis. The ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 1 (ABCA1) mediates the rate-controlling step in HDL particle formation, the assembly of free cholesterol and phospholipids with apoA-I. ABCA1 is expressed in many tissues; however, the physiological functions of ABCA1 in specific tissues and organs are still elusive. The liver is known to be the major source of plasma HDL, but it is likely that there are other important sites of HDL biogenesis. To assess the contribution of intestinal ABCA1 to plasma HDL levels in vivo, we generated mice that specifically lack ABCA1 in the intestine. Our results indicate that approximately 30% of the steady-state plasma HDL pool is contributed by intestinal ABCA1 in mice. In addition, our data suggest that HDL derived from intestinal ABCA1 is secreted directly into the circulation and that HDL in lymph is predominantly derived from the plasma compartment. These data establish a critical role for intestinal ABCA1 in plasma HDL biogenesis in vivo.

Syntaxins play a major role in vesicular fusion and have also been demonstrated to interact with members of the ABC-transporter family. Therefore, we focused on the identification of syntaxins that directly interact with ABCA1. The expression of syntaxins and ABCA1 in cultured human monocytes during M-CSF differentiation and cholesterol loading was investigated and syntaxins 3, 6, and 13 were found induced in foam cells together with ABCA1. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a direct association of syntaxin 13 and full-length ABCA1, whereas syntaxin 3 and 6 failed to interact with ABCA1. The colocalization of ABCA1 and syntaxin 13 was also shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. Silencing of syntaxin 13 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) led to reduced ABCA1 protein levels and hence to a significant decrease in apoA-I-dependent choline-phospholipid efflux. ABCA1 is localized in Lubrol WX-insoluble raft microdomains in macrophages and syntaxin 13 and flotillin-1 were also detected in these detergent resistant microdomains along with ABCA1. Syntaxin 13, flotillin-1, and ABCA1 were identified as phagosomal proteins, indicating the involvement of the phagosomal compartment in ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux. In addition, the uptake of latex phagobeads by fibroblasts with mutated ABCA1 was enhanced when compared with control cells and the recombinant expression of functional ABCA1 normalized the phagocytosis rate in Tangier fibroblasts. It is concluded that ABCA1 forms a complex with syntaxin 13 and flotillin-1, residing at the plasma membrane and in phagosomes that are partially located in raft microdomains.\n\nAssociation of ABCA1 with Syntaxin 13 and Flotillin-1 and Enhanced Phagocytosis in Tangier Cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBared, Salim Maa; Buechler, Christa; Boettcher, Alfred; Dayoub, Rania; Sigruener, Alexander; Grandl, Margot; Rudolph, Christian; Dada, Ashraf; Schmitz, Gerd\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) facilitates the cellular release of cholesterol and choline-phospholipids to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and several studies indicate that vesicular transport is associated with ABCA1 function.

However, regulation of these activities is still largely unknown. Brefeldin A (BFA), a uncompetitive inhibitor of brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins (BIGs), disturbs the intracellular distribution of ABCA1, and thus inhibits cholesterol efflux. This study aimed to define the possible roles of BIGs in regulating ABCA1 trafficking and cholesterol efflux, and further to explore the potential mechanism. Methods and Results By vesicle immunoprecipitation, we found that BIG1 was associated with ABCA1 in vesicles preparation from rat liver. BIG1 depletion reduced surface ABCA1 on HepG2 cells and inhibited by 60% cholesterol release. In contrast, BIG1 over-expression increased surface ABCA1 and cholesterol secretion. With partial restoration of BIG1 through over-expression in BIG1-depleted cells, surface ABCA1 was also restored. Biotinylation and glutathione cleavage revealed that BIG1 siRNA dramatically decreased the internalization and recycling of ABCA1. This novel function of BIG1 was dependent on the guanine nucleotide-exchange activity and achieved through activation of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1). Conclusions BIG1, through its ability to activate ARF1, regulates cell surface levels and function of ABCA1, indicating a transcription-independent mechanism for controlling ABCA1 action.

This mechanism may reduce intracellularly accumulated excess cholesterol, and thereby would contribute to the prevention or cure of the initial stage of atherosclerotic vascular lesion. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) plays a central role in this reaction by removing cholesterol from cells and transporting it to the liver, the major cholesterol catabolic site. Two independent mechanisms have been identified for cellular cholesterol release. The first is non-specific diffusion-mediated cholesterol \"efflux\" from the cell surface, in which cholesterol is trapped by various extracellular acceptors including lipoproteins. Extracellular cholesterol esterification of HDL provides a driving force for the net removal of cell cholesterol by this pathway, and some cellular factors may enhance this reaction. The other mechanism is an apolipoprotein-mediated process to generate new HDL particles by removing cellular phospholipid and cholesterol. This reaction is mediated by a membrane protein ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), and lipid-free or lipid-poor helical apolipoproteins recruit cellular phospholipid and cholesterol to assemble HDL particles. The reaction is composed of two elements: the assembly of HDL particles with phospholipid by apolipoprotein, and cholesterol enrichment in HDL. ABCA1 is essential for the former step and the latter requires further intracellular events. ABCA1 is a rate-limiting factor of HDL assembly and is regulated by transcriptional and post-transcriptional factors. Post-transcriptional regulation of ABCA1 involves modulation of its calpain-mediated degradation.\n\nFunctional rescue of mutant ABCA1 proteins by sodium 4-phenylbutyrate.\n\nPubMed\n\nSorrenson, Brie; Suetani, Rachel J; Williams, Michael J A; Bickley, Vivienne M; George, Peter M; Jones, Gregory T; McCormick, Sally P A\n\n2013-01-01\n\nMutations in the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) are a major cause of decreased HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), which infers an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Many ABCA1 mutants show impaired localization to the plasma membrane. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the chemical chaperone, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) could improve cellular localization and function of ABCA1 mutants. Nine different ABCA1 mutants (p.A594T, p.I659V, p.R1068H, p.T1512M, p.Y1767D, p.N1800H, p.R2004K, p.A2028V, p.Q2239N) expressed in HEK293 cells, displaying different degrees of mislocalization to the plasma membrane and discrete impacts on cholesterol efflux, were subject to treatment with 4-PBA. Treatment restored localization to the plasma membrane and increased cholesterol efflux function for the majority of mutants. Treatment with 4-PBA also increased ABCA1 protein expression in all transfected cell lines. In fibroblast cells obtained from low HDL-C subjects expressing two of the ABCA1 mutants (p.R1068H and p.N1800H), 4-PBA increased cholesterol efflux without any increase in ABCA1 expression. Our study is the first to investigate the effect of the chemical chaperone, 4-PBA on ABCA1 and shows that it is capable of restoring plasma membrane localization and enhancing the cholesterol efflux function of mutant ABCA1s both in vitro and ex vivo. These results suggest 4-PBA may warrant further investigation as a potential therapy for increasing cholesterol efflux and HDL-C levels.\n\nCellular Cholesterol Accumulation Facilitates Ubiquitination and Lysosomal Degradation of Cell Surface-Resident ABCA1.\n\nPubMed\n\nMizuno, Tadahaya; Hayashi, Hisamitsu; Kusuhara, Hiroyuki\n\n2015-06-01\n\nBy excreting cellular cholesterol to apolipoprotein A-I, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) mediates the biogenesis of high-density lipoprotein in hepatocytes and prevents foam cell formation from macrophages. We recently showed that cell surface-resident ABCA1 (csABCA1) undergoes ubiquitination and later lysosomal degradation through the endosomal sorting complex required for transport system. Herein, we investigated the relevance of this degradation pathway to the turnover of csABCA1 in hypercholesterolemia. Immunoprecipitation and cell surface-biotinylation studies with HepG2 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages showed that the ubiquitination level and degradation of csABCA1 were facilitated by treatment with a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist and acetylated low-density lipoprotein. The effects of an LXR agonist and acetylated low-density lipoprotein on the degradation of csABCA1 were repressed completely by treatment with bafilomycin, an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation, and by depletion of tumor susceptibility gene 101, a major component of endosomal sorting complex required for transport-I. RNAi analysis indicated that LXRÎ² inhibited the accelerated lysosomal degradation of csABCA1 by the LXR agonist, regardless of its transcriptional activity. Cell surface coimmunoprecipitation with COS1 cells expressing extracellularly hemagglutinin-tagged ABCA1 showed that LXRÎ² interacted with csABCA1 and inhibited the ubiquitination of csABCA1. Immunoprecipitates with anti-ABCA1 antibodies from the liver plasma membranes showed less LXRÎ² and a higher ubiquitination level of ABCA1 in high-fat diet-fed mice than in normal chow-fed mice. Under conditions of high cellular cholesterol content, csABCA1 became susceptible to ubiquitination by dissociation of LXRÎ² from csABCA1, which facilitated the lysosomal degradation of csABCA1 through the endosomal sorting complex required for transport system.

In most cases, Nef binds to the target protein and directs it to a degradation pathway. Our previous studies demonstrated that Nef impairs activity of the cellular cholesterol transporter, ABCA1, and that Nef interacts with ABCA1. Mutation of the 2226DDDHLK motif in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of ABCA1 disrupted interaction with Nef. Here, we tested Nef interaction with the ABCA1 C-terminal cytoplasmic fragment using yeast 2-hybrid system assay and co-immunoprecipitation analysis in human cells. Surprisingly, analysis in a yeast 2-hybrid system did not reveal any interaction between Nef and the C-terminal cytoplasmic fragment of ABCA1. Using coimmunoprecipitation from HEK 293T cells expressing these polypeptides, only a very weak interaction could be detected. The 2226DDDHLK motif in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of ABCA1 found previously to be essential for interaction between ABCA1 and Nef is insufficient to bestow strong binding to Nef. Molecular modeling suggested that interaction with Nef may be mediated by a conformational epitope composed of the sequences within the cytoplasmic loop of ABCA1 and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Studies are now underway to characterize this epitope.

Adipocyte dysfunction in obesity is associated with intracellular cholesterol accumulation, and alterations in cholesterol homeostasis have been shown to alter glucose metabolism in cultured adipocytes. ABCA1 plays a major role in cholesterol efflux, suggesting a role for ABCA1 in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in the adipocyte. However, the impact of adipocyte ABCA1 on adipose tissue function and glucose metabolism is unknown. Our aim was to determine the impact of adipocyte ABCA1 on adipocyte lipid metabolism, body weight, and glucose metabolism in vivo. To address this, we used mice lacking ABCA1 specifically in adipocytes (ABCA1(-ad/-ad)). When fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet, ABCA1(-ad/-ad) mice showed increased cholesterol and triglyceride stores in adipose tissue, developed enlarged fat pads, and had increased body weight. Associated with these phenotypic changes, we observed significant changes in the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and glucose homeostasis, including ldlr, abcg1, glut-4, adiponectin, and leptin. ABCA1(-ad/-ad) mice also demonstrated impaired glucose tolerance, lower insulin sensitivity, and decreased insulin secretion. We conclude that ABCA1 in adipocytes influences adipocyte lipid metabolism, body weight, and whole-body glucose homeostasis.\n\nAmphipathic Polyproline Peptides Stimulate Cholesterol Efflux by the ABCA1 Transporter\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSviridov, D.O.; Drake, S.K.; Freeman, L.A.; Remaley, A.T.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nApoA-I mimetics are short synthetic peptides that contain an amphipathic Î±Î±-helix and stimulate cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 transporter in a detergent-like extraction mechanism. We investigated the use of amphipathic peptides with a polypro helix for stimulating cholesterol efflux by ABCA1. Polypro peptides were synthesized with modified prolines, containing either a hydrophobic phenol group (Prop) or a polar N-acetylgalactosamine (Prog) attached to the pyrrolidine ring and were designated as either PP-2, 3, 4, or 5, depending on the number of 3 amino acid repeat units (Prop - Prog - Prop). Based on molecular modeling, these peptides were predicted to be relatively rigid and to bind to a phospholipid bilayer. By CD spectroscopy, PP peptides formed a Type-II polypro helix in an aqueous solution. PP-2 was inactive in promoting cholesterol efflux, but peptides with more than 2 repeat units were active. PP-4 showed a similar Vmax as a much longer amphipathic Î±-Î±helical peptide, containing 37 amino acids, but had a Km that was approximately 20-fold lower. PP peptides were specific in that they did not stimulate cholesterol efflux from cells not expressing ABCA1 and were also non-cytotoxic. Addition of PP-3, 4 and 5 to serum promoted the formation of smaller size HDL species (7 nM) and increased its capacity for ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux by approximately 20-35% (p<0.05). Because of their relatively small size and increased potency, amphipathic peptides with a polypro helix may represent an alternative structural motif for the development of apoA-I mimetic peptides.

Using CHO cell lines stably expressing human ABCA1 or ABCG1, we observed that the abundance of these proteins is increased by cell cholesterol loading. The response to increased cholesterol is rapid, is independent of transcription, and appears to be specific for these membrane proteins. The effect is mediated through cholesterol-dependent inhibition of transporter protein degradation. Cell cholesterol loading similarly regulates degradation of endogenously expressed ABCA1 and ABCG1 in human THP-1 macrophages. Turnover of ABCA1 and ABCG1 is strongly inhibited by proteasomal inhibitors and is unresponsive to inhibitors of lysosomal proteolysis. Furthermore, cell cholesterol loading inhibits ubiquitination of ABCA1 and ABCG1. Our findings provide evidence for a rapid, cholesterol-dependent, post-translational control of ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein levels, mediated through a specific and sterol-sensitive mechanism for suppression of transporter protein ubiquitination, which in turn decreases proteasomal degradation. This provides a mechanism for acute fine-tuning of cholesterol transporter activity in response to fluctuations in cell cholesterol levels, in addition to the longer term cholesterol-dependent transcriptional regulation of these genes.\n\nCellular Cholesterol Regulates Ubiquitination and Degradation of the Cholesterol Export Proteins ABCA1 and ABCG1*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHsieh, Victar; Kim, Mi-Jurng; Gelissen, Ingrid C.; Brown, Andrew J.; Sandoval, Cecilia; Hallab, Jeannette C.; Kockx, Maaike; Traini, Mathew; Jessup, Wendy; Kritharides, Leonard\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to examine the influence of cholesterol in post-translational control of ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein expression.

Adipocyte dysfunction in obesity is associated with intracellular cholesterol accumulation, and alterations in cholesterol homeostasis have been shown to alter glucose metabolism in cultured adipocytes. ABCA1 plays a major role in cholesterol efflux, suggesting a role for ABCA1 in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in the adipocyte. However, the impact of adipocyte ABCA1 on adipose tissue function and glucose metabolism is unknown. Our aim was to determine the impact of adipocyte ABCA1 on adipocyte lipid metabolism, body weight, and glucose metabolism in vivo. To address this, we used mice lacking ABCA1 specifically in adipocytes (ABCA1âad/âad). When fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet, ABCA1âad/âad mice showed increased cholesterol and triglyceride stores in adipose tissue, developed enlarged fat pads, and had increased body weight. Associated with these phenotypic changes, we observed significant changes in the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and glucose homeostasis, including ldlr, abcg1, glut-4, adiponectin, and leptin. ABCA1âad/âad mice also demonstrated impaired glucose tolerance, lower insulin sensitivity, and decreased insulin secretion. We conclude that ABCA1 in adipocytes influences adipocyte lipid metabolism, body weight, and whole-body glucose homeostasis.

Controlling ABCA1 is a rational approach to improving atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Although much is known about the regulatory mechanism of ABCA1 synthesis, the molecular mechanism underpinning its degradation remains to be clearly described. ABCA1 possesses potential sites of phosphorylation by serine/threonine-protein kinase Pim-1 (Pim-1). Pim-1 depletion decreased the expression of cell surface-resident ABCA1 (csABCA1) and apolipoprotein A-I-mediated [ 3 H]cholesterol efflux in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2, but not in peritoneal macrophages from mice. In vitro kinase assay, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry suggested phosphorylation of csABCA1 by the long form of Pim-1 (Pim-1L). Cell surface biotinylation indicated that Pim-1L inhibited lysosomal degradation of csABCA1 involving the liver X receptor Î², which interacts with csABCA1 and thereby protects it from ubiquitination and subsequent lysosomal degradation. Cell surface coimmunoprecipitation with COS-1 cells expressing extracellularly hemagglutinin-tagged ABCA1 showed that Pim-1L-mediated phosphorylation of csABCA1 facilitated the interaction between csABCA1 and liver X receptor Î² and thereby stabilized the csABCA1-Pim-1L complex. Mice deficient in Pim-1 kinase activity showed lower expression of ABCA1 in liver plasma membranes and lower plasma high-density lipoprotein levels than control mice. Pim-1L protects hepatic csABCA1 from lysosomal degradation by facilitating the physical interaction between csABCA1 and liver X receptor Î² and subsequent stabilization of the csABCA1-Pim-1L complex and thereby regulates the circulating level of high-density lipoprotein. Our findings may aid the development of high-density lipoprotein-targeted therapy.

Initially, four modeling approaches, including linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, radial basis function neural network, and classification and regression trees, were applied to construct different QSAR classification models. The statistics results indicated that these four kinds of QSAR models were powerful tools for screening highly potent ABCA1 up-regulators. Then, a consensus QSAR model was developed by combining the predictions from these four models. To discover new ABCA1 up-regulators at maximum accuracy, the compounds in the ZINC database that fulfilled the requirement of structural similarity of 0.7 compared to known potent ABCA1 up-regulator were subjected to the consensus QSAR model, which led to the discovery of 50 compounds. Finally, they were docked into the LXRÎ² binding site to understand their role in up-regulating ABCA1 expression. The excellent binding modes and docking scores of 10 hit compounds suggested they were highly-potent ABCA1 up-regulators targeting LXRÎ². Overall, this study provided an effective strategy to discover highly potent ABCA1 up-regulators.\n\nABCA1 gene variants regulate postprandial lipid metabolism in healthy men\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDelgado-Lista, Javier; Perez-Martinez, Pablo; Perez-Jimenez, Francisco; Garcia-Rios, Antonio; Fuentes, Francisco; Marin, Carmen; GÃ³mez-Luna, PurificaciÃ³n; Camargo, Antonio; Parnell, Laurence D; Ordovas, Jose Maria; Lopez-Miranda, Jose\n\n2010-01-01\n\nObjective Genetic variants of ABCA1, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, have been linked to altered atherosclerosis progression and fasting lipid concentration, mainly high density lipoproteins (HDL) and Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), but results from different studies have been inconsistent. Methods and results In order to further characterize the effects of ABCA1 variants in human postprandial lipid metabolism, we studied the influence of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [i27943 (rs2575875); i48168 (rs4149272); R219K (rs2230806)] in the postprandial lipemia of 88 normolipidemic young men, who were given a fatty meal. For i27943 and i48168 SNPs, fasting and postprandial values of APOA1 were higher, and postprandial lipemia was much lower in homozygotes for the major alleles, for total triglycerides in plasma, and large-triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRL) triglycerides. These persons also showed higher APOA1/APOB ratio. Major allele homozygotes for i48168 and i27943 showed additionally higher HDL and lower postprandial Apolipoprotein B (ApoB). Conclusions Our work shows that major allele homozygotes for ABCA1 SNPs i27943 and i48168 have a lower postprandial response as compared to minor allele carriers. This finding may further characterize the role of ABCA1 in lipid metabolism.

This paradigm implies the necessity to identify molecular biomarkers for early gastric cancer diagnosis, as well as for disease monitoring, thus contributing to the development of new therapeutic approaches. In a previous study, performed by array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization, we described for the first time in literature recurrent amplification of RTEL1 and ABCA13 genes in gastric cancer. Thus, the aim of the present study was to validate recurrent amplification of RTEL1 and ABCA13 genes and associate CNV status with clinicopathological data. Results showed RTEL1 and ABCA13 amplification in 38Â % of samples. Statistical analysis demonstrated that RTEL amplification is more common in older patients and more associated with intestinal type and ABCA13 amplification increases the risk of lymph node metastasis and is more common in men. Co-amplification of these genes showed a significant association with advanced staging. aCGH is a very useful tool for investigating novel genes associated with carcinogenesis and RTEL1 amplification may be important for the development of gastric cancer in older patients, besides being a probable event contributing for chromosomal instability in intestinal gastric carcinogenesis. ABCA13 amplification may have age-specific function and could be considered a useful marker for predicting lymph node metastasis in resected gastric cancer patients in early stage. Lastly, RTEL1 and ABCA13 synergistic effect may be considered as a putative marker for advanced staging in gastric cancer patients.\n\nPiperine inhibits ABCA1 degradation and promotes cholesterol efflux from THPâ1âderived macrophages\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Limei; Palme, Veronika; Rotter, Susanne; Schilcher, Nicole; Cukaj, Malsor; Wang, Dongdong; Ladurner, Angela; Heiss, Elke H.; Stangl, Herbert; Dirsch, Verena M.\n\n2016-01-01\n\n1 Scope Increased macrophage cholesterol efflux (ChE) is considered to have antiâatherosclerotic effect counteracting cardiovascular disease. The principle pungent ingredient of the fruits of Piper nigrum, piperine, is identified in this study as a ChE inducer in THPâ1âderived macrophages, and mechanisms underlying this effect are explored. 2 Methods and results Without affecting cell viability, piperine concentrationâdependently enhances ChE in THPâ1âderived macrophages from 25 to 100Â Î¼M. The expression level of the key cholesterol transporter protein ATPâbinding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is significantly upregulated by piperine, as revealed by western blot analyses. However, two other ChEâmediating transporter proteins, ATPâbinding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) and scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SRâB1), remain unaffected. Piperine exerts no influence on ABCA1 mRNA levels, but significantly inhibits the degradation of ABCA1, as evident by an increased halfâlife of the protein in the presence of cycloheximide. Furthermore, it is found that piperine likely interferes with the calpainâmediated ABCA1 degradation pathway and exhibits significant inhibition of calpain activity. 3 Conclusion Our findings suggest that piperine promotes ChE in THPâ1âderived macrophages by upregulation of ABCA1, which might be mediated by inhibition of calpain activity. This novel bioactivity makes the dietary constituent piperine a good candidate to be further explored for therapeutic or preventive applications in the context of atherosclerosis.

This study was designed to determine whether puerarin decreased lipid accumulation via up-regulation of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. Our results showed that puerarin significantly promoted the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) mRNA and protein via the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³)-liver X receptor-alpha (LXR-Î±) pathway and decreased cellular lipid accumulation in human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. The miR-7 directly targeted 3' untranslated region of STK11 (Serine/Threonine Kinase 11), which activated the AMPK pathway. Transfection with miR-7 mimic significantly reduced STK11 expression in puerarin-treated macrophages, decreased the phosphorylation of AMPK, down-regulated the expression of the PPARÎ³-LXR-Î±-ABCA1 expression. Additionally, treatment with miR-7 decreased cholesterol efflux and increased cholesterol levels in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. Our study demonstrates that puerarin promotes ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux and decreases intracellular cholesterol levels through the pathway involving miR-7, STK11, and the AMPK-PPARÎ³-LXR-Î±-ABCA1 cascade.

Here, a detailed survey of genetic variation in the ABCA1 region has been performed in a total of 1567 Swedish dementia cases (including 1275 with Alzheimer disease) and 2203 controls, providing evidence of association with maximum significance at marker rs2230805 (OR = 1.39; 95% CI 1.23â1.57, P = 7.7 Ã 10â8). Haplotype-based tests confirmed association of this genomic region after excluding rs2230805, and imputation did not reveal additional markers with greater support. Significantly associating markers reside in two distinct linkage disequilibrium blocks with maxima near the promoter and in the terminal exon of a truncated ABCA1 splice-form. The putative risk allele of rs2230805 was also found to be associated with reduced cerebrospinal fluid levels of Î²-amyloid. The strongest evidence of association was obtained when all forms of dementia were considered together, but effect sizes were similar when only confirmed Alzheimer disease cases were assessed. Results further implicate ABCA1 in dementia, reinforcing the putative involvement of lipid transport in neurodegenerative disease.

Recent findings Small Î±-helical peptides based on the C-terminal domain of apoE have been developed for therapeutic applications. These peptides stimulate cellular cholesterol efflux via the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) with high potency, like native apolipoproteins on a molar basis. This potent activity has been related to the unique ability of these peptides to maintain Î±-helix structure upon dilution. Recent structure-activity studies improving the safety features of these mimetic peptides have greatly improved their potentialmoreÂ Â» for clinical use. Structural features of the class A Î±-helix motif that induce muscle toxicity and hypertriglyceridemia have been identified. These may have implications for the design of other HDL mimetic peptides. Summary ABCA1 is an integral membrane protein that plays a central role in biology. Its principal function is to mediate the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipid from cells to extracellular apo, preventing a build-up of excess cholesterol in membranes. This process generates HDL particles that perform a variety of functions to protect against disease. A number of these functions can be viewed as directly or indirectly supporting ABCA1 activity, thus constituting a positive feedback system to optimize cellular lipid efflux responses and disease prevention. Consequently, therapeutic approaches that mimic the activities of apos may prove highly effective to combat disease. One such approach involves the use of peptides. The broad biological relevance of ABCA1 suggests these apo mimetic peptides may be useful for the treatment of a number of diseases, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease.Â«Â less\n\nABCA1 agonist peptides for the treatment of disease\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nBielicki, John K.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nPurpose of review The review summarizes information pertaining to the preclinical development of new apolipoprotein (apo) E mimetic peptides that stimulate cellular cholesterol efflux.

We evaluated targeted next-generation sequencing data from patients with very low HDL cholesterol (i.e. hypoalphalipoproteinemia) using the VarSeq-CNV caller algorithm to screen for CNVs disrupting the ABCA1, LCAT or APOA1 genes. In four individuals, we found three unique deletions in ABCA1: a heterozygous deletion of exon 4, a heterozygous deletion spanning exons 8 to 31, and a heterozygous deletion of the entire ABCA1 gene. Breakpoints were identified using Sanger sequencing, and the full-gene deletion was also confirmed using exome sequencing and the Affymetrix CytoScanTM HD Array. Before now, large-scale deletions in candidate HDL genes have not been associated with hypoalphalipoproteinemia; our findings indicate that CNVs in ABCA1 may be a previously unappreciated genetic determinant of low HDL cholesterol levels. By coupling bioinformatic analyses with next-generation sequencing data, we can successfully assess the spectrum of genetic determinants of many dyslipidemias, now including hypoalphalipoproteinemia.

The purpose of this study is to explore whether IL-8 promotes cholesterol accumulation by enhancing miR-183 expression in macrophages and its underlying mechanism. Treatment of THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells with IL-8 decreased ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux. Using bioinformatics analyses and dual-luciferase reporter assays, we found that miR-183 was highly conserved during evolution and directly inhibited ABCA1 protein and mRNA expression by targeting ABCA1 3'UTR. MiR-183 directly regulated endogenous ABCA1 expression levels. Furthermore, IL-8 enhanced the expression of miR-183 and decrease ABCA1 expression. Cholesterol transport assays confirmed that IL-8 dramatically inhibited apolipoprotein AI-mediated ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux by increasing miR-183 expression. In contrast, treatment with anti-IL-8 antibody reversed these effects. IL-8 enhances the expression of miR-183, which then inhibits ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux. Our studies suggest that the IL-8-miR-183-ABCA1 axis may play an intermediary role in the development of atherosclerosis. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These transporters are highly regulated at the post-translational level, including protein ubiquitination. Our aim was to investigate the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase HECTD1, recently identified as associated with ABCG1, on ABCG1 and ABCA1 protein levels and cholesterol export function. Here, we show that HECTD1 protein is widely expressed in a range of human and murine primary cells and cell lines, including macrophages, neuronal cells and insulin secreting Î²-cells. siRNA knockdown of HECTD1 unexpectedly decreased overexpressed ABCG1 protein levels and cell growth, but increased native ABCA1 protein in CHO-K1 cells. Knockdown of HECTD1 in unloaded THP-1 macrophages did not affect ABCG1 but significantly increased ABCA1 protein levels, in wild-type as well as THP-1 cells that do not express ABCG1. Cholesterol export from macrophages to apoA-I over time was increased after knockdown of HECTD1, however these effects were not sustained in cholesterol-loaded cells. In conclusion, we have identified a new candidate, the E3 ubiquitin ligase HECTD1, that may be involved in the regulation of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol export from unloaded macrophages to apoA-I. The exact mechanism by which this ligase affects this pathway remains to be elucidated. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This mechanism may reduce intracellularly accumulated cholesterol in excess, and thereby would contribute to the prevention or cure of the initial stage of atherosclerotic vascular lesions. HDL is thought to play a main role in this reaction on the basis of epidemiological evidence and in-vitro experimental data. Two independent mechanisms have been identified for this reaction. One is non-specific diffusion-mediated cholesterol 'efflux' from the cell surface, and cholesterol is trapped by various extracellular acceptors including lipoproteins. Extracellular cholesterol esterification on HDL provides a driving force for the net removal of cell cholesterol, and some cellular factors may enhance this reaction. The other mechanism is an apolipoprotein-mediated process to generate HDL by removing cellular phospholipid and cholesterol. This reaction is mediated by a membrane protein ABCA1, and lipid-free or lipid-poor helical apolipoproteins recruit cellular phospholipid and cholesterol to assemble HDL particles. The reaction is composed of two elements: the assembly of HDL particles with phospholipid by apolipoprotein, and cholesterol enrichment in HDL. ABCA1 is essential for the former step, and the latter step requires further intracellular events. ABCA1 is a rate-limiting factor of HDL assembly and is regulated by transcriptional factors and posttranscriptional factors. Posttranscriptional regulation of ABCA1 involves the modulation of its calpain-mediated degradation.\n\nThe cholesterol transporter ABCA1 is expressed in stallion spermatozoa and reproductive tract tissues.\n\nPubMed\n\nMerkl, M; Ertl, R; Handschuh, S; Aurich, C; SchÃ¤fer-Somi, S\n\n2016-04-01\n\nIn the present study, we assessed the presence of the ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) transporter molecules ABCA1 in spermatozoa of adult stallions and in testicular and epididymal tissue of prepubertal and adult stallions. For this purpose, semen samples from six fertile Shetland pony stallions aged 4 to 19 years were collected. Semen was collected from each stallion on three consecutive days. Ejaculates were analyzed immediately after collection, and only ejaculates meeting minimal requirements for fertile stallions were further evaluated. ABCA1 immunosignal was localized after staining of semen smears with different antibodies and counterstaining with Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-peanut agglutinin (PNA) and 4',6-Diamidin-2-phenylindol (DAPI). In a total of three samples, capacitation and acrosome reaction were induced by means of capacitation medium and progesterone substitution, respectively. Testicular and epididymal tissues were obtained from five prepubertal stallions aged 8 to 12 months and five adult stallions aged 4 to 9 years. For quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR), testicular and epididymal tissue of another seven adult (aged 1.5-14.5 years) and five prepupertal stallions (6-8 months) was used. For immunohistochemistry, sections from the caput, corpus, and cauda of the testes and epididymes were stained with the same specific antibodies as for immunocytochemistry. In stallion spermatozoa, strong immunosignal for ABCA1 was detected in the acrosomal area, the equatorial zone, and the principle piece of the flagellum but not in the caudal part of the head and the midpiece. In damaged or acrosome-reacted spermatozoa the FITC-PNA signal vanished together with the ABCA1 signal in most spermatozoa. In testicular tissue, strong immunostaining for ABCA1 was mainly visible in the heads and flagella of round spermatids and weaker signals in late spermatids and released spermatozoa. No staining was assessed in the Sertoli cells and spermatogonia of adult stallions, whereas\n\nCCL11 (Eotaxin-1) Levels Predict Long-Term Functional Outcomes in Patients Following Ischemic Stroke.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoy-O'Reilly, Meaghan; Ritzel, Rodney M; Conway, Sarah E; Staff, Ilene; Fortunato, Gilbert; McCullough, Louise D\n\n2017-12-01\n\nCirculating levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine C-C motif chemokine 11 (CCL11, also known as eotaxin-1) are increased in several animal models of neuroinflammation, including traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease. Increased levels of CCL11 have also been linked to decreased neurogenesis in mice. We hypothesized that circulating CCL11 levels would increase following ischemic stroke in mice and humans, and that higher CCL11 levels would correlate with poor long-term recovery in patients. As predicted, circulating levels of CCL11 in both young and aged mice increased significantly 24Â h after experimental stroke. However, ischemic stroke patients showed decreased CCL11 levels compared to controls 24Â h after stroke. Interestingly, lower post-stroke CCL11 levels were predictive of increased stroke severity and independently predictive ofÂ poorer functional outcomes in patients 12Â months after ischemic stroke. These results illustrate important differences in the peripheral inflammatory response to ischemic stroke between mice and human patients. In addition, it suggests CCL11 as a candidate biomarker for the prediction of acute and long-term functional outcomes in ischemic stroke patients.\n\nRare and Coding Region Genetic Variants Associated With Risk of Ischemic Stroke: The NHLBI Exome Sequence Project.\n\nPubMed\n\nAuer, Paul L; Nalls, Mike; Meschia, James F; Worrall, Bradford B; Longstreth, W T; Seshadri, Sudha; Kooperberg, Charles; Burger, Kathleen M; Carlson, Christopher S; Carty, Cara L; Chen, Wei-Min; Cupples, L Adrienne; DeStefano, Anita L; Fornage, Myriam; Hardy, John; Hsu, Li; Jackson, Rebecca D; Jarvik, Gail P; Kim, Daniel S; Lakshminarayan, Kamakshi; Lange, Leslie A; Manichaikul, Ani; Quinlan, Aaron R; Singleton, Andrew B; Thornton, Timothy A; Nickerson, Deborah A; Peters, Ulrike; Rich, Stephen S\n\n2015-07-01\n\nsubtype and in African Americans. Replication of protein-coding variants in candidate genes was observed for 2 previously reported GWAS associations: ZFHX3 (cardioembolic stroke) and ABCA1 (large-vessel stroke). Exome sequencing discovered 2 novel genes and mechanisms, PDE4DIP and ACOT4, associated with increased risk for ischemic stroke. In addition, ZFHX3 and ABCA1 were discovered to have protein-coding variants associated with ischemic stroke. These results suggest that genetic variation in novel pathways contributes to ischemic stroke risk and serves as a target for prediction, prevention, and therapy.\n\nActivation of Liver X Receptor Decreases Atherosclerosis in Ldlrâ/â mice in the Absence of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in Myeloid Cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKappus, Mojdeh S.; Murphy, Andrew J.; Abramowicz, Sandra; Ntonga, Vusisizwe; Welch, Carrie L.; Tall, Alan R.; Westerterp, Marit\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective Liver X Receptor (LXR) activators decrease atherosclerosis in mice. LXR activators (1) directly up-regulate genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and (2) exert anti-inflammatory effects mediated by transrepression of NFÎºB target genes. We investigated whether myeloid cell deficiency of ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 and G1 (ABCA1/G1), principal targets of LXR that promote macrophage cholesterol efflux and initiate RCT, would abolish the beneficial effects of LXR activation on atherosclerosis. Approach and Results LXR activator T0901317 (T0) substantially reduced inflammatory gene expression in macrophages lacking ABCA1/G1. Ldlrâ/â mice were transplanted with Abca1â/âAbcg1â/â or wild-type bone marrow (BM) and fed a Western-type diet (WTD) for 6 weeks with or without T0 supplementation. Abca1/g1 BM deficiency increased atherosclerotic lesion complexity and inflammatory cell infiltration into the adventitia and myocardium. T0 markedly decreased lesion area, complexity and inflammatory cell infiltration in the Abca1â/âAbcg1â/â BM transplanted mice. To investigate whether this was due to macrophage Abca1/g1 deficiency, Ldlrâ/â mice were transplanted with LysmCreAbca1fl/flAbcg1fl/fl or Abca1fl/flAbcg1fl/fl BM and fed WTD with or without the more specific LXR agonist GW3965 for 12 weeks. GW3965 decreased lesion size in both groups and the decrease was more prominent in the LysmCreAbca1fl/flAbcg1fl/fl group. Conclusions The results suggest that anti-inflammatory effects of LXR activators are of key importance to their anti-atherosclerotic effects in vivo independent of cholesterol efflux pathways mediated by macrophage ABCA1/G1. This has implications for the development of LXR activators that lack adverse effects on lipogenic genes while maintaining the ability to trans-repress inflammatory genes.

Y.; Ishigami, Masato; Kishimoto, Takuma; Kobayashi, Toshihide; Ueda, Kazumitsu; Furukawa, Koichi; Chang, Ta-Yuan; Yokoyama, Shinji\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCellular cholesterol homeostasis involves sterol sensing at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and sterol export from the plasma membrane (PM). Sterol sensing at the ER requires efficient sterol delivery from the PM; however, the macromolecules that facilitate retrograde sterol transport at the PM have not been identified. ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) mediates cholesterol and phospholipid export to apolipoprotein A-I for the assembly of high density lipoprotein (HDL). Mutations in ABCA1 cause Tangier disease, a familial HDL deficiency. Several lines of clinical and experimental evidence suggest a second function of ABCA1 in cellular cholesterol homeostasis in addition to mediating cholesterol efflux. Here, we report the unexpected finding that ABCA1 also plays a key role in facilitating retrograde sterol transport from the PM to the ER for sterol sensing. Deficiency in ABCA1 delays sterol esterification at the ER and activates the SREBP-2 cleavage pathway. The intrinsic ATPase activity in ABCA1 is required to facilitate retrograde sterol transport. ABCA1 deficiency causes alternation of PM composition and hampers a clathrin-independent endocytic activity that is required for ER sterol sensing. Our finding identifies ABCA1 as a key macromolecule facilitating bidirectional sterol movement at the PM and shows that ABCA1 controls retrograde sterol transport by modulating a certain clathrin-independent endocytic process.

Genetic factors, lipid profiles, hypertension are potential risk factors for diabetes mellitus. Adenosine binding cassette transporter proteins 1 (ABCA1) plays a role in cholesterol metabolism, especially high density lipoprotein (HDL-cholesterol). There are multiple mechanisms by which HDL-cholesterol can be atheroprotective, it is clear that the relative activity of ABCA1 plays a major role. We aimed to investigate association of ABCA1 C69T gene polymorphism with lipid levels in Turkish type 2 diabetic patients. After isolation of DNA by ethanol precipitation we determined ABCA1 gene polymorphism by using polimerase chain reaction--restriction fragment lenght polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method in 107 type 2 diabetic patients and 50 healthy controls. We have observed that the frequency of TT genotype is significantly higher in healthy controls compared to patients (14% vs. 3%; P = 0.008). Also frequency of T allele was higher in controls than in patients (34% vs. 21%; P = 0.020; OR (95% CI) = 0.52 (0.30-0.88)). There was no association of lipid levels and ABCA1 C69T polymorphism subgroups. We have found significantly higher frequency of both T allele and genotype in control group when compared to patients that made us think that T allele may be a protective factor against diabetes mellitus. But, we could not find a relationship between genotypes and lipid concentrations in our two groups. Larger studies will help us to understand the relationship between ABCA1 C69T genotype and lipid parameters in diabetes mellitus.\n\nA novel compound inhibits rHDL assembly and blocks nascent HDL biogenesis downstream of apoAI binding to ABCA1 expressing cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLyssenko, Nicholas N.; Brubaker, Gregory; Smith, Bradley D.; Smith, Jonathan D.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjective Nascent high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles form from cellular lipids and extracellular lipid-free apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) in a process mediated by ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). We have sought out compounds that inhibit nascent HDL biogenesis without affecting ABCA1 activity. Methods and Results Reconstituted HDL (rHDL) formation and cellular cholesterol efflux assays were used to show that two compounds that bond via hydrogen with phospholipids inhibit rHDL and nascent HDL production. In rHDL formation assays, the inhibitory effect of compound 1 (methyl 3Î±-acetoxy-7Î±,12Î±-di[(phenylaminocarbonyl)amino]-5Î²-cholan-24-oate), the more active of the two, depended on its ability to associate with phospholipids. In cell assays, compound 1 suppressed ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to apoAI, the 18A peptide, and taurocholate with high specificity, without affecting ABCA1-independent cellular cholesterol efflux to HDL and endocytosis of acetylated low-density lipoprotein (AcLDL) and transferrin. Furthermore, compound 1 did not affect ABCA1 activity adversely, as ABCA1-mediated shedding of microparticles proceeded unabated and apoAI binding to ABCA1-expressing cells increased in its presence. Conclusions The inhibitory effects of compound 1 support a three-step model of nascent HDL biogenesis: plasma membrane remodeling by ABCA1, apoAI binding to ABCA1, and lipoprotein particle assembly. The compound inhibits the final step, causing accumulation of apoAI in ABCA1-expressing cells.

ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 1 (ABCA1) is a crucial cholesterol transporter involved in RCT to produce high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDLC), and is transcriptionally regulated by liver X receptor alpha (LXRÎ±), a nuclear receptor. Quercetin is a widely distributed flavonoid in edible plants which prevented atherosclerosis in an animal model. We found thatmoreÂ Â» quercetin-3-O-glucuronide (Q3GA), a major quercetin metabolite after absorption from the digestive tract, enhanced ABCA1 expression, in vitro, via LXRÎ± in macrophages. In addition, leaf extracts of a traditional Asian edible plant, Nelumbo nucifera (NNE), which contained abundant amounts of quercetin glycosides, significantly elevated plasma HDLC in mice. We are the first to present experimental evidence that Q3GA induced ABCA1 in macrophages, and to provide an alternative explanation to previous studies on arteriosclerosis prevention by quercetin.Â«Â less\n\nModulation of ABCA1 by an LXR Agonist Reduces Beta-Amyloid Levels and Improves Outcome after Traumatic Brain Injury\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLoane, David J.; Washington, Patricia M.; Vardanian, Lilit; Pocivavsek, Ana; Hoe, Hyang-Sook; Duff, Karen E.; Cernak, Ibolja; Rebeck, G. William; Faden, Alan I.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAbstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases brain beta-amyloid (AÎ²) in humans and animals. Although the role of AÎ² in the injury cascade is unknown, multiple preclinical studies have demonstrated a correlation between reduced AÎ² and improved outcome. Therefore, therapeutic strategies that enhance AÎ² clearance may be beneficial after TBI. Increased levels of ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) transporters can enhance AÎ² clearance through an apolipoprotein E (apoE)-mediated pathway. By measuring AÎ² and ABCA1 after experimental TBI in C57BL/6J mice, we found that AÎ² peaked early after injury (1â3 days), whereas ABCA1 had a delayed response (beginning at 3 days). As ABCA1 levels increased, AÎ² levels returned to baseline levelsâconsistent with the known role of ABCA1 in AÎ² clearance. To test if enhancing ABCA1 levels could block TBI-induced AÎ², we treated TBI mice with the liver X-receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317. Pre- and post-injury treatment increased ABCA1 levels at 24âh post-injury, and reduced the TBI-induced increase in AÎ². This reduction in AÎ² was not due to decreased amyloid precursor protein processing, or a shift in the solubility of AÎ², indicating enhanced clearance. T0901317 also limited motor coordination deficits in injured mice and reduced brain lesion volume. These data indicate that activation of LXR can reduce AÎ² accumulation after TBI, and is accompanied by improved functional recovery.

This study was to explore the potential mechanisms underlying Hsp27 effects on ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression and cellular cholesterol efflux. THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells were infected with adenovirus to express wild-type Hsp27, hyper-phosphorylated Hsp27 mimic (3D Hsp27), antisense Hsp27 or hypo-phosphorylated Hsp27 mimic (3A Hsp27). Wild-type and 3D Hsp27 were found to up-regulate ABCA1 mRNA and protein expression and increase cholesterol efflux from cells. Expression of antisense or 3A Hsp27 suppressed the expression of ABCA1 and cholesterol efflux. Furthermore, over-expression of wild-type and 3D Hsp27 significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated specificity protein 1 (Sp1), protein kinase C Î¶ (PKCÎ¶) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). In addition, the up-regulation of ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux induced by 3D Hsp27 was suppressed by inhibition of Sp1, PKCÎ¶ and PI3K with specific kinase inhibitors. Taken together, our results revealed that Hsp27 may up-regulate the expression of ABCA1 and promotes cholesterol efflux through activation of the PI3K/PKCÎ¶/Sp1 signal pathway in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. Our findings may partly explain the mechanisms underlying the anti-atherogenic effect of Hsp27. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we demonstrate a direct association between free cholesterol (FC), lipid raft content, and hyper-responsiveness of macrophages to LPS in WT mice. Abca1-M/-M macrophages were also hyper-responsive to specific agonists to TLR2, TLR7, and TLR9, but not TLR3, compared with WT macrophages. We hypothesized that ABCA1 regulates macrophage responsiveness to TLR agonists by modulation of lipid raft cholesterol and TLR mobilization to lipid rafts. We demonstrated that Abca1-M/-M vs. WT macrophages contained 23% more FC in isolated lipid rafts. Further, mass spectrometric analysis suggested raft phospholipid composition was unchanged. Although cell surface expression of TLR4 was similar between Abca1-M/-M and WT macrophages, significantly more TLR4 was distributed in membrane lipid rafts in Abca1-M/-M macrophages. Abca1-M/-M macrophages also exhibited increased trafficking of the predominantly intracellular TLR9 into lipid rafts in response to TLR9-specific agonist (CpG). Collectively, our data suggest that macrophage ABCA1 dampens inflammation by reducing MyD88-dependent TLRs trafficking to lipid rafts by selective reduction of FC content in lipid rafts.

The build-up of precursor sterols, including lanosterol, displays cellular toxicity. Precursor sterols are found in plasma HDL. How these structurally different sterols are released from cells is poorly understood. Here, we show that newly synthesized precursor sterols arriving at the plasma membrane (PM) are removed by extracellular apoA-I in a manner dependent on ABCA1, a key macromolecule for HDL biogenesis. Analysis of sterol molecules by GC-MS and tracing the fate of radiolabeled acetate-derived sterols in normal and mutant Niemann-Pick type C cells reveal that ABCA1 prefers newly synthesized sterols, especially lanosterol, as the substrates before they are internalized from the PM. We also show that ABCA1 resides in a cholesterol-rich membrane domain resistant to the mild detergent, Brij 98. Blocking ACAT activity increases the cholesterol contents of this domain. Newly synthesized C29/C30 sterols are transiently enriched within this domain, but rapidly disappear from this domain with a half-life of less than 1 h. Our work shows that substantial amounts of precursor sterols are transported to a certain PM domain and are removed by the ABCA1-dependent pathway.

This study investigated the underlying mechanism whereby TSF regulates renal lipid accumulation and ameliorates diabetic renal injuries in spontaneous diabetic db/db mice and in vitro in sodium palmitate (PA)-stimulated and Abca1-SiRNA-transfected mouse tubular epithelial cells (mTECs). The results revealed that TSF treatment significantly ameliorated the renal injuries by lowering urinary albumin excretion and improving renal tissue injuries in diabetic (db/db) mice. Interestingly, the treatment with TSF also resulted in decreased cholesterol levels in the renal tissues of db/db mice, which was associated with increased expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ coactivator 1-Î± (PGC-1Î±), the Liver X receptors (LXR), and ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), suggesting that TSF might attenuate diabetic kidney injury via a mechanism associated with improving cholesterol efflux in the diabetic kidney. This was investigated in vitro in mTECs, and the results showed that TSF reduced the PA-stimulated cholesterol accumulation in mTECs. Mechanistically, the addition of TSF was capable of reversing PA-induced downregulation of PGC-1Î±, LXR, and ABCA1 expression and cholesterol accumulation in mTECs, suggesting that TSF might act the protection via the PGC-1Î±-LXR-ABCA1 pathway to improve the cholesterol efflux in the renal tissues of db/db mice. This was further confirmed by silencing ABCA1 to block the promotive effect of TSF on cholesterol efflux in vitro . In conclusion, TSF might ameliorate diabetic kidney injuries by promoting ABCA1-mediated renal cholesterol efflux.\n\nA Computational Approach From Gene to Structure Analysis of the Human ABCA4 Transporter Involved in Genetic Retinal Diseases.\n\nPubMed\n\nTrezza, Alfonso; Bernini, Andrea; Langella, Andrea; Ascher, David B; Pires, Douglas E V; Sodi, Andrea; Passerini, Ilaria; Pelo, Elisabetta; Rizzo, Stanislao; Niccolai, Neri; Spiga, Ottavia\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe aim of this article is to report the investigation of the structural features of ABCA4, a protein associated with a genetic retinal disease. A new database collecting knowledge of ABCA4 structure may facilitate predictions about the possible functional consequences of gene mutations observed in clinical practice. In order to correlate structural and functional effects of the observed mutations, the structure of mouse P-glycoprotein was used as a template for homology modeling. The obtained structural information and genetic data are the basis of our relational database (ABCA4Database). Sequence variability among all ABCA4-deposited entries was calculated and reported as Shannon entropy score at the residue level. The three-dimensional model of ABCA4 structure was used to locate the spatial distribution of the observed variable regions. Our predictions from structural in silico tools were able to accurately link the functional effects of mutations to phenotype. The development of the ABCA4Database gathers all the available genetic and structural information, yielding a global view of the molecular basis of some retinal diseases. ABCA4 modeled structure provides a molecular basis on which to analyze protein sequence mutations related to genetic retinal disease in order to predict the risk of retinal disease across all possible ABCA4 mutations. Additionally, our ABCA4 predicted structure is a good starting point for the creation of a new data analysis model, appropriate for precision medicine, in order to develop a deeper knowledge network of the disease and to improve the management of patients.\n\nNeopterin negatively regulates expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 by the LXRÎ± signaling pathway in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nYan, Jin-quan; Tan, Chun-zhi; Wu, Jin-hua; Zhang, Dong-cui; Chen, Ji-ling; Zeng, Bin-yuan; Jiang, Yu-ping; Nie, Jin; Liu, Wei; Liu, Qin; Dai, Hao\n\n2013-07-01\n\nTo investigate the effects of neopterin on ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux in human THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells, and to explore the role of the liver X receptor alpha (LXRÎ±) involved. In the present study, THP-1 cells were pre-incubated with ox-LDL to become foam cells. The protein and mRNA expression were examined by Western blot assays and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively. Liquid scintillation counting and high performance liquid chromatography assays were used to test cellular cholesterol efflux and cholesterol content. Neopterin decreased ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells, and the LXRÎ± siRNA can reverse the inhibitory effects induced by neopterin. Neoterin has a negative regulation on ABCA1 expression via the LXRÎ± signaling pathway, which suggests the aggravated effects of neopterin on atherosclerosis.\n\nRetinoid Binding Properties of Nucleotide Binding Domain 1 of the Stargardt Disease-associated ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) Transporter, ABCA4*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBiswas-Fiss, Esther E.; Affet, Stephanie; Ha, Malissa; Biswas, Subhasis B.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe retina-specific ATP binding cassette transporter, ABCA4 protein, is associated with a broad range of inherited macular degenerations, including Stargardt disease, autosomal recessive cone rod dystrophy, and fundus flavimaculatus. In order to understand its role in retinal transport in rod out segment discs, we have investigated the interactions of the soluble domains of ABCA4 with both 11-cis- and all-trans-retinal. Using fluorescence anisotropy-based binding analysis and recombinant polypeptides derived from the amino acid sequences of the four soluble domains of ABCA4, we demonstrated that the nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) specifically bound 11-cis-retinal. Its affinity for all-trans-retinal was markedly reduced. Stargardt disease-associated mutations in this domain resulted in attenuation of 11-cis-retinal binding. Significant differences in 11-cis-retinal binding affinities were observed between NBD1 and other cytoplasmic and lumenal domains of ABCA4. The results suggest a possible role of ABCA4 and, in particular, the NBD1 domain in 11-cis-retinal binding. These results also correlate well with a recent report on the in vivo role of ABCA4 in 11-cis-retinal transport.

We investigated this complex regulatory network using specific PPAR agonists: four fibrates (fenofibrate, bezafibrate, gemfibrozil and LY518674), a PPAR Î´ agonist (GW501516) and a PPAR Î³ agonist (pioglitazone). All of these compounds increased the expression of LXRs, PPARs and ABCA1 mRNAs, and associated apoA-I-mediated lipid release in THP-1 macrophage, WI38 fibroblast and mouse fibroblast. When mouse fibroblasts lacking expression of PPAR Î± were examined, the effects of fenofibrate and LY518674 were markedly diminished while induction by other ligands were retained. The PPAR Î± promoter was activated by all of these compounds in an LXR Î±-dependent manner, and partially in a PPAR Î±-dependent manner, in mouse fibroblast. The LXR responsive element (LXRE)-luciferase activity was enhanced by all the compounds in an LXR Î±-dependent manner in mouse fibroblast. This activation was exclusively PPAR Î±-dependent by fenofibrate and LY518674, but nonexclusively by the others. We conclude that PPARs and LXRs are involved in the regulation of ABCA1 expression and HDL biogenesis in a cooperative signal transduction pathway.

The build-up of precursor sterols, including lanosterol, displays cellular toxicity. Precursor sterols are found in plasma HDL. How these structurally different sterols are released from cells is poorly understood. Here, we show that newly synthesized precursor sterols arriving at the plasma membrane (PM) are removed by extracellular apoA-I in a manner dependent on ABCA1, a key macromolecule for HDL biogenesis. Analysis of sterol molecules by GC-MS and tracing the fate of radiolabeled acetate-derived sterols in normal and mutant Niemann-Pick type C cells reveal that ABCA1 prefers newly synthesized sterols, especially lanosterol, as the substrates before they are internalized from the PM. We also show that ABCA1 resides in a cholesterol-rich membrane domain resistant to the mild detergent, Brij 98. Blocking ACAT activity increases the cholesterol contents of this domain. Newly synthesized C29/C30 sterols are transiently enriched within this domain, but rapidly disappear from this domain with a half-life of less than 1 h. Our work shows that substantial amounts of precursor sterols are transported to a certain PM domain and are removed by the ABCA1-dependent pathway.

Raft-localization of proteins is widely thought to be regulated by raft cholesterol levels, but this is largely on the basis of studies that have manipulated cell cholesterol using crude and poorly specific chemical tools, such as Î²-cyclodextrins. To date, there has been no proteome-scale investigation of whether endogenous regulators of intracellular cholesterol trafficking, such as the ATP binding cassette (ABC)A1 lipid efflux transporter, regulate targeting of proteins to rafts.
