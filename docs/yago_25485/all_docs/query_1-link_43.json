        "text": "Did you know that Neighbours star Alan Fletcher has previously appeared on the Channel 5 soap as another character? It's true!\n\nBut he's not the only recycled Ramsay Street resident.\n\nCheck out our round-up of Neighbours stars who have appeared on the long-running Aussie series as different characters over the years.\n\nHow many of these roles do you remember?\n\n1. Alan Fletcher\n\nNeighbours star Alan Fletcher has played doctor Karl Kennedy for over 25 years. However, his first visit to Erinsborough was actually in 1987.\n\nAlan had a three-week guest role as mechanic Greg Cooper, who started working at the local garage owned by Jim Robinson.\n\nBut Greg was a troubled soul and later confessed a shock secret: he was responsible for the death of his brother Colin. Greg's girlfriend had dumped him for his brother. So in a jealous rage, Greg punched Colin, who fell and later died from a head injury.\n\n\"I was invited to continue playing Greg Cooper but preferred to work in the theatre at the time,\" Alan revealed in an interview with The Perfect Blend. \"Carrying on with Greg would have robbed me of that chance.\"\n\n2. Alyce Platt\n\nAlyce Platt was back on screen in Neighbours in 2020 as Olivia Bell, former flame of doctor Karl Kennedy. The pair previously dated in 2012 after Karl and Susan's marriage break-up.\n\nThis time around, Olivia caused chaos for the Kennedy family with her tell-all book about killer school teacher Finn Kelly, who moved into Number 28 Ramsay Street after avoiding a prison sentence for his crimes.\n\nBut long-time viewers of the Aussie soap may remember Alyce previously played medical student Jen Handley from 1995 to 1996. Jen began a romance with Philip Martin after the death of his wife Julie. The role reunited Alyce with her former Sons & Daughters co-star Ian Rawlings.\n\n\"In the end, I don't think the scriptwriters knew what to do with me,\" Alyce said after her character was written out of the series after just a year on screen.\n\n3. Tim Phillipps\n\nThere was big excitement when Neighbours bosses announced they were introducing the character of Daniel Robinson, the grown-up son of Scott and Charlene Robinson (famously played by Jason Donovan and Kylie Minogue).\n\nIt led to fan speculation that Kylie and Jason might even return to Ramsay Street for the Aussie soap's 30th anniversary back in 2015.\n\nTim Phillipps landed the role of Daniel after producers decided he looked a bit like his famous on-screen parents. But this wasn't Tim's first visit to Erinsborough.\n\nBack in 2007, he appeared on screen for a few weeks as Fox, a mystery teenager who haunted Paul Robinson during some weird fantasy sequences.\n\nIt turned out that Fox was a figment of Paul's imagination after the businessman discovered he had a brain tumour.\n\n4. Scott Major\n\nScott Major is best known for his role as mechanic and garage boss Lucas Fitzgerald on Neighbours.\n\nHe played the part for seven years and still makes occasional appearances on screen, as well as directing episodes of the Aussie soap.\n\nBut back in 1993, with much longer hair, Scott played the role of bad boy Darren Stark. Darren was the son of Cheryl Stark and the brother of Brett and Dannii.\n\nAfter being released from a juvenile detention centre, Darren headed for Erinsborough, where he continued his life of crime. He tried to involve his girlfriend Debbie Martin in a robbery and got sent to prison.\n\nThe role was later recast with Todd MacDonald, as Scott was busy filming Aussie high school drama Heartbreak High at the time.\n\n5. Ryan Moloney\n\nRyan Moloney has played Jarrod Vincenzo Rebecchi, aka Toadie, for over 25 years now. He made his first appearance on Neighbours as then-schoolboy Toadfish in 1995.\n\nBut the previous year, Ryan appeared in one episode of the Aussie soap as Cyborg, a yobbo who vandalised the Willis house and was confronted by Pam Willis.\n\nProducers were impressed with Ryan, who had also auditioned for the role of Brett Stark. They later offered him the role of Toadfish, the younger brother of Kevin 'Stonefish' Rebecchi.\n\n6. Darius Perkins\n\nWhen Neighbours first began on the Seven Network in Australia in 1985, Darius Perkins played the role of Scott Robinson.\n\nBut after just 170 episodes, the series was axed due to low ratings.\n\nWhen the series was revived by Network Ten in 1986, producers recast the role of Scott with Jason Donovan.\n\nDarius returned to Ramsay Street 18 years later. But this time as Marty Kranic, a dodgy associate of Paul Robinson. The role reunited Darius with his previous on-screen brother Stefan Dennis.\n\nThe character became a suspect after the baddie Robbo Slade was the victim of a fatal hit-and-run. Marty also blackmailed Paul while he was running to become mayor of Erinsborough.\n\n\"It's great playing a bad guy because Scott Robinson was such a nice bloke,\" Darius explained. \"But the writers have done a terrific job with Marty by showing another side.\"\n\nSadly, Darius passed away from cancer in 2019. He was aged 54.\n\n7. Colette Mann\n\nEx-Prisoner: Cell Block H star Colette Mann joined the cast of Neighbours as Kyle Canning's busybody gran Sheila in 2012. But this wasn't her first appearance on the Aussie soap.\n\nFrom late 1995 to early 1996, Colette took over the role of Cheryl Stark when actress Caroline Gillmer had to take a break from filming because of health issues.\n\nDuring Colette's six weeks in the role, Cheryl's relationship with Lou Carpenter was shaken up by the reappearance of his ex-wife Linda.\n\nLinda had a shock proposal for her and Lou to re-marry in order to get their hands on some inheritance money.\n\n\"Cheryl Stark was very hard work as I had no prep for the role,\" Colette has said on Twitter. \"But I think I got there in the end… just as Caroline got well again!\"\n\n8. Eliza Taylor-Cotter\n\nThese days, Eliza Taylor is best known for her role as Clarke Griffin in all seven seasons of the American post-apocalypse series, The 100. But before she hit it big in Hollywood, Eliza played two different characters on Neighbours.\n\nViewers will remember her as Toadie Rebecchi's feisty teenage cousin Janae Timmins. Between 2005 to 2008, Janae was at the centre of some big storylines including an HIV scare, an attempted sexual assault and a disastrous and short-lived marriage to Boyd Hoyland.\n\nEagle-eyed viewers might remember that Eliza actually made her Neighbours debut as guest character Jacinta Martin in 2003.\n\nJacinta was a mean girl from Eden Hills High who bullied Boyd's younger sister Summer Hoyland and attempted to take over her newspaper round.\n\n9. Nell Feeney\n\nJanelle Timmins first arrived in Erinsborough in 2004 wearing a neck brace. She wanted her legal eagle nephew Toadie Rebecchi to represent her in court and help her get financial compensation after a car accident.\n\nJanelle was a Ramsay Street regular for three years and her family lived at Number 26. She returned for the soap's 30th anniversary celebrations in 2015.\n\nBut Nell Feeney had also appeared on Neighbours the previous year as an entirely different character. In 2003, she played Joanne Blair, an old friend of Steph Scully.\n\nJoanne stirred up trouble between Steph and her fella, Max Hoyland after she set her sights on him falling in love with her.\n\nThe homewrecker appeared in five episodes of the soap, before Max eventually rejected her advances.\n\nNeighbours airs weekdays at 1.45pm and 6pm on Channel 5 (UK) and Mondays to Thursdays at 6.30pm on 10 Peach (Australia).\n\nRead more Neighbours spoilers on our dedicated homepage\n\nYou Might Also Like"
