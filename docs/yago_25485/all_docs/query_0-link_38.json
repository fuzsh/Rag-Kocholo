        "text": "The final episode of Neighbours is on TV this week, closing the book on nearly four decades of the Australian soap.\n\nThough the fictional suburb of Erinsborough was first introduced back in 1985, it wasn't until October 1986 that we got to see it every day on our screens in the UK. All these years later, we still remember the highs and lows of the Ramsay Street residents and the rollercoaster array of storylines they have been a part of. Neighbours spent the first 21 years of its life on BBC One before moving to Channel 5 in February 2008.\n\nAside from being must-see television for thousands of people, the show also built up a reputation as being the career launchpad for a number of big names. From Oscar-winning Russell Crowe and critically-acclaimed Margot Robbie, to all three Hemsworth brothers and chart toppers Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan, many have Neighbours to thank for getting into the limelight.\n\nSome cast members have returned through the years, whereas others are set to come back for the first time as part of the Neighbours finale. The soap has also had a few quirky cameos, such as wrestler turned actor Dave Bautista\n\nAs the final episode airs this week after 37 years on our screens, we take a brief look back at a number of celebrities who starred in Neighbours what they did next. From soap regulars to cameos, they may not have all started out on the show, but they are all part of its incredible history.\n\nMargot Robbie - Donna Freedman\n\nBefore her breakout role in The Wolf of Wall Street alongside Leonardo Di Caprio in 2013, Margot Robbie made her first screen appearance on Neighbours in June 2008. Initially a guest character before becoming a Ramsay Street regular, Robbie played Donna Freedman, later Brown, on the show until 2011.\n\nOriginally portrayed as an obsessive fan of musician Ty Harper, Donna went on to marry boyfriend Ringo, but their love story was cut short when Ringo was tragically killed. After his death, Donna decided to follow her dream of working in fashion, heading for a design school in New York.\n\nAfter flying the Neighbours nest, Margot arrived in America and landed the role of Laura Cameron in the period drama series Pan Am. Hitting the big time in Hollywood, she has since enjoyed a stellar film career.\n\nWith starring roles in The Legend of Tarzan, Suicide Squad, Harley Quinn, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood and her critically acclaimed role in I, Tonya, Margot has had numerous Golden Globe Award, BAFTA and Academy Award nominations.
