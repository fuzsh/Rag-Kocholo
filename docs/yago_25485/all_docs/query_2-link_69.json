        "text": "THE first half of \"13 West Street\" is pretty darn good. It's convincing and diverting to watch Alan Ladd as the determined victim and, especially, Rod Steiger as an eagle-eyed detective, try to find five young boys who for no reason nearly beat Mr. Ladd to death.This part of the movie, the detection, is solid stuff, effectively turned by Philip Leacock's steady directing and the terse dialogue. The Columbia release, adapted by Bernard Schoenfeld and Robert Presnell from a Leigh Brakett novel, opened yesterday in neighborhood theatres with \"Five Finger Exercise\").The set-up is for an interesting, hard-knuckled drama with some purposeful sociological overtones. The lads, for instance, aren't street hoodlums but moneyed, educated specimens, led by a cool, sadistic playboy (Michael Callan). Why did they nearly kill Mr. Ladd? Don't ask us.The picture is more concerned with the hero's almost paranoic obsession to get them. It maintains a man shouldn't take the law into his own hands and then whips up a hot melodramatic lather to prove it. The homestretch involves a boy's suicide, several random maulings, a wild car chase obliterating an extremely dumb detective (not Mr. Steiger) and a predictable fade-out that literally shrugs off motivations.In a sideline detraction, curious stress is placed on Mr. Ladd's profession â€” that of a rocket engineer. What has this to do with crime in Los Angeles and Bel Air to boot?The picture rings sharpest and truest in the quiet, strong performance of Mr. Steiger, who never looked nattier, as the juvenile-division sleuth. Others, among them Kenneth MacKenna and Margaret Hayes, are briefly effective. As Mr. Ladd's anxious wife, Dolores Dorn redeems some Ophelia-like behavior near the climax in an ugly encounter with Mr. Callan.We still want to know why Mr. Ladd was splashing around in blood downtown with such a big pool up in Bel Air.\n\nThe Cast13 WEST STREET, screen play by Bernard Schoenfeld and Robert Presnell, based on Leigh Brackett's novel, \"The Tiger Among Us\"; directed by Philip Leacock; produced by William Bloom for Ladd Enterprises; a Columbia presentation.
