        "text": "Otto Richard “Dick” Steiger, 92, passed away at his home early March 25, 2024.\n\nMr. Steiger was born on November 6, 1931 in Bucyrus where he lived most of his life. He was the only child of Otto Franklin and Freda (McPeak) Steiger who preceded him in death, along with his sons, Michael Lee Steiger, Ritchie Alan Steiger, and Steven Ray Steiger.\n\nHe leaves behind his wife of 68 years, Jeanne (Sharrock) Steiger; daughters-in-law, Christa Steiger and Kelly Steiger; grandsons, Wesley (Merideth) Steiger Shaun Steiger (Emily Wagner); great grandson, Callen Ritchie Steiger; and dear friends and neighbors, Ed “Yogi” and Scott Wheeler.\n\nDick graduated from Bucyrus High School in 1950. In 1951, he was drafted and served in the United Stated Army for two years, stationed in Germany during the Korean War. He was a member of the silent drill team and color guard of the 28th Infantry Division, performing for many high ranking officers. He returned to Crawford County and worked for General Electric for 20 years, one year at Marion Correctional Institute, and retired from the Ohio State Highway Patrol as a supervisor of Driver Examination District 2.\n\nHe was a member of Martin Luther Lutheran Church, Moose Lodge 669, and Life Member of American Legion Post 181 and AmVets Post 27. In years past, Dick served on the American Red Cross board, Bucyrus Twp VFD, and helped with Little League Baseball. His passions were his grandchildren, meticulously mowing his lawn, camping, and golfing.\n\nMr. Steiger will be laid to rest privately in Oakwood Cemetery with military rites by the US Army Honor Guard and Bucyrus Veterans Military Funeral Detail. Those wishing to remember him with a memorial donation are encouraged to make gifts payable to Lifeline of Ohio or Crawford County Veterans Hall of Fame and give through Wise Funeral Service, 129 W. Warren St., Bucyrus, Ohio 44820.\n\nMemories and photos can be shared on the guestbook."
