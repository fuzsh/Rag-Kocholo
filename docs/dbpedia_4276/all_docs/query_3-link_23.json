        "text": "North Flight (ノースフライト, Noosu Furaito) is a character in Uma Musume: Pretty Derby.\n\nProfile[]\n\nNorth Flight is Tracen Academy's resident fashionista, a horse girl who loves dressing up in everything and everything! She sticks by the motto that \"Any material can shine depending on what it looks like and how it's worn\", something that she has experimented with based on her own experience and body size. \"Fu-chan's Fashion Advice\" is very popular among the school's horse girls.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nNorth Flight is a horse girl with light brown hair, and wears a small hat on the left side of her head. She has orange eyes.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nSakura Bakushin O:\n\nIRL: Rival at sprint/mile races. North Flight prevented Bakushin O from two-class domination and vice versa.\n\nMatches (NF/SBO):\n\n1994 Yasuda Kinen 1st/4th\n\n1994 Swan Stakes 2nd/1st\n\n1994 Mile Championship 1st/2nd\n\nYukino Bijin:\n\nIRL: Fought once.\n\nMatches (NF/YB)\n\n1994 Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup 2nd/10th (1st: Hokuto Vega)\n\nBiko Pegasus:\n\nIRL: Fought twice.\n\nMatches (NF/BP):\n\n1994 Swan Stakes 2nd/7th (1st: Sakura Bakushin O)\n\n1994 Mile Championship 1st/5th\n\nAston Machan - Roommate\n\nSongs[]\n\n[]\n\nUma Musume Real Life\n\nRequirement:\n\nReference:\n\nNotes[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAs North Flight was appeared in Uma Musume, her real-life owner Taihoku Farm commentated in their X (former Twitter).\n\n“We heard North Flight appears in Uma Musume.\n\nWe would be grateful if you love her.\n\nAnd thank you all for uploading her photos on racing or in the farm.\n\nWe're sure she feels happy in the heaven.”\n\n―Taihoku Farm, the owner[1]\n\nReal Life[]\n\nNorth Flight is a racehorse in the 1990s. She was known as the Queen of Mile. In her age, it was difficult for mares to win sire-mare mixed races, however, she won two mile G1s, defeating Sakura Bakushin O and kept him within the Sprint King.\n\nName Origin[]\n\nNorth ― A crown name of the Taihoku Farm.\n\nFlight ― Comes from her mother Shadai Flight.\n\nA rivalry between her and Sakura Bakushin O is remarkable. Bakushin O could not defeat North Flight at two mile G1s. North Flight also could not defeat Bakushin O at the sprint race. They shared dominations for mile and sprint. This caused JRA's restructuring for sprint/mile grade races.\n\nNotes[]"
