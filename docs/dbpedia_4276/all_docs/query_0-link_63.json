        "text": "Welcome to our live coverage of the 2022 Epsom Derby, with tens of thousands of racegoers descending on the Downs for one of flat racing's blue riband events.\n\nThis year's race is a particularly special edition given it forms a central part of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations, although Her Majesty will not be present at the course today.\n\nEpsom still intends to celebrate the Queen, with 40 riders who have ridden for the owner-breeder donning royal silks in a guard of honour, while a number of her former racehorses will parade at the course.\n\nEpsom tweeted: 'We would like to wish Her Majesty The Queen a wonderful Platinum Jubilee. It is a rare occasion that The Queen is unable to join us at Epsom Downs but we are delighted she plans to enjoy Derby Day on television.\n\n'We have big plans to celebrate Her Majesty's contribution to horseracing and the nation, and these will continue in full.\n\n'The Derby is a unique race and we are looking forward to welcoming people in their thousands to help us create a spectacular carnival atmosphere.'\n\nThis year's race will also be run in memory of legendary jockey Lester Piggott, who died last week.\n\nApart from naming the Derby in memory of the nine-time winner - the first time the race had been named in honour of an individual - jockeys will also wear black armbands, while a wreath in Nijinsky’s colours will be placed at the foot of the life-sized statue of Piggott on the grandstand lawn and there will be a minute’s silence ahead of the race.\n\nTickets for Epsom's paid enclosures on Saturday are sold out with a crowd of 36,000 anticipated, plus racegoers on the Hill, which is free to access.\n\nSir Michael Stoute's Desert Crown is the current favourite for the Derby, priced up at a general 9/4.\n\nWe will have all the build-up to the big race plus the results from the rest of the card as they happen, and tips from our racing correspondent Marcus Armytage, while the Derby itself is due to get under way at 4.30pm."
