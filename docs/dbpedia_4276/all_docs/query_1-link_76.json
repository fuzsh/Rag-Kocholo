        "text": "It’s Andrea Atzeni’s friendship with all-conquering Australian trainer Ciaron Maher that will see him make a hit-and-run mission to Randwick this weekend to ride Group One Sydney Cup (3,200m) favourite Circle Of Fire.\n\nCircle Of Fire carries just 51.5kg (113.5 pounds) in the Sydney Cup seven days after winning the Group Two Chairman’s Quality (2,600m), with Atzeni delighted to be able to step in and help a mate.\n\n“I got the phone call on Monday but at the time he was only carrying 50kg, which is a bit too light for me. But Ciaron said there was a good chance the weights would go up and he went up to 51.5kg, so I took the ride,” said Atzeni, who is enjoying a strong season in Hong Kong with 34 winners.\n\n“It came out of the blue but I’m actually quite good friends with Ciaron. There’s a lot of horses carrying light weights and there’s only so many light jockeys available. It’s obviously a good ride to get.”\n\nAtzeni will ride in Sydney for the first time and jumps aboard outsider Lively, also for Maher, early on the card in a bid to get his eye in before attempting to negotiate barrier 15 of 17 aboard Circle Of Fire.\n\n“I rode in the Melbourne Cup in 2016 but I’ve never ridden in Sydney before. I’ve spoken to Hughy [Bowman] about it and I’m looking forward to it,” said Atzeni, who will return to Sha Tin for eight rides on Sunday.\n\n“I’ve never ridden [Circle Of Fire] before but he’s an ex-English horse, he was trained by Sir Michael [Stoute] and the late Queen [Elizabeth] owned him. He had decent form in England, he was placed in a Listed race and he was a winner last weekend [in Sydney] on heavy ground, so it’s nice ride to get.”\n\nThe Jockey Club will simulcast 10 races from Randwick on Saturday, including four Group Ones, before crossing to Ascot in Perth for the Group Two WATC Derby (2,400m)."
