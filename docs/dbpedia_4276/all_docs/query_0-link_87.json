        "text": "Out in the yard at Freemason Lodge, there is a sentry. He is a proud little Ormskirk Heeler who trots around like he owns the place. He is called Duke, named for the late racehorse trainer David Nicholson and when Sir Michael Stoute emerges from his office to have his picture taken, Duke knows what to do.\n\nSir Michael is not much renowned for liking interviews, nor for posing for photographs that accompany them. He is courtesy itself today but Duke is not encumbered by such social or professional niceties.\n\nAs the camera whirs and whines, Duke starts to growl and advance, eyeing the photographer's ankles.\n\n'Well trained,' says Sir Michael, looking at him askance.\n\nWell trained, like pretty much everything else Sir Michael has touched in a brilliant career in British horse racing that has spanned five decades and which, as the Flat season approaches its finale next weekend with the QIPCO British Champions Day at Ascot, is in the midst of what the great man himself describes as a 'resurgence'.\n\nNot that his career ever really dipped. It is more that the 10-times champion trainer has had to come to terms with the shift in the balance of power in British racing that has occurred with the emergence of the Coolmore Stud and the might of its racing arm at Ballydoyle, overseen by Aidan O'Brien, as the dominant force in the sport.\n\nA life in racing that began by locking horns with men such as Henry Cecil and Dick Hern has spanned different eras and is now spent in the struggle against monoliths Ballydoyle and Godolphin. It has not affected Sir Michael's reputation or the esteem in which he is held. Nor has it softened his competitive edge.\n\nForget the idea that he is some sort of ogre, though. On Thursday morning in Newmarket, he leaves the barking to Duke. Sir Michael might be economic with his language sometimes, he might have an aversion to surrendering information on his runners, but he is fine, engaging company and a man who laces everything he says with self-deprecation.\n\nHe keeps you on your toes, sure. A question about what keeps him motivated is met with an arched eyebrow and a glance at an acquaintance sitting on the other side of the room. 'He's trying to retire me, isn't he,' he says, before he elaborates.\n\n'I want success and reasonable returns. I don't have to run away crying because I am not top dog. But I will remain respectable or I'll walk. And what is respectability? Having reasonable success. You want some class horses to go to war with.'\n\nSir Michael loves sport, too. Cricket is his other great passion and his friend Michael Holding, the former West Indies fast bowler, accompanies him to the gallops most mornings. But he is a student of football as well and he smiles when he is asked if competing with the might of Ballydoyle is akin to struggling against the billions of, say, Roman Abramovich.\n\n'Ballydoyle are nicer than Abramovich,' says Sir Michael, 71. 'They have been very, very clever because they have built this thing up. They've got a nursery. That is where their best horses come from: their own nursery, not public auction. They still keep topping up and bringing in new blood. It's just been sheer brilliance, led by John Magnier, who has developed his team around him and they are stronger than anybody else.\n\n'We have won a few championships in our time but I don't have the firepower or the numbers to do that any longer. We maintain a respectable position but I wouldn't be champion trainer again. I can't compete with them.\n\n'The power is now held by Ballydoyle. Godolphin will probably get stronger now that they have broken down the barriers and are purchasing Galileos themselves. There was a freeze on that since 2005. They didn't touch any Coolmore stallions but that has changed now. A fresh approach. They are an enormous set-up.\n\n'Listen, I would love to have 15 or 20 Galileos. I don't. We get the occasional one. Ulysses has helped us along. At the end of the day, I think I do the best I can and I have got to accept that and I am better off than most. I am fortunate with a lot of loyal owners and very good staff. Without them, the job won't be properly done and won't be enjoyable. We're hanging in there. We're getting the odd goal. I wouldn't get top wages as a striker, though.'\n\nSir Michael roars with laughter at that analogy but it is slightly misleading. A cursory knowledge of racing tells you he is still deadly when it comes to hitting the back of the net. By yesterday, he was already fast closing in on his career-best domestic prize money haul for a single season of £3.7million, achieved in 2003.\n\nThe season has been dominated by O'Brien. The Irishman trained the first four home as US Navy Flag won the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket on Saturday to provide him with a 24th Group One success of 2017, one short of American trainer Bobby Frankel's record.\n\nBut Stoute has claimed victory in two of the most prestigious races in the British racing calendar this year, the Group One Eclipse Stakes and the Juddmonte International Stakes, both with Ulysses.\n\nUlysses is also on course for next month's Breeders' Cup Turf, at which he could be joined by stablemate and 2016 Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf winner Queen's Trust.\n\nAnd Poet's Word, winner of the Glorious Stakes at Goodwood and runner-up in the Irish Champion Stakes, is among the fancied runners in the QIPCO Champion Stakes on Champions Day next Saturday, another big target for Sir Michael.\n\nStoute is about more than just numbers, though. He's the trainer's trainer. His name stands for quality and thoroughness and class. Jockeys love working for him, too. Kieren Fallon, who rode Kris Kin and North Light to victory in the Derby in 2003 and 2004 for Sir Michael, felt more at ease at Freemason Lodge than he did when he was retained by Henry Cecil, for instance.\n\nFallon enjoyed Sir Michael's more relaxed style. The two men would discuss the next day's racing over a glass of red wine at the yard rather than in the full glare of the paddock with owners and stewards milling around. Fallon, six times the champion jockey, enjoyed his most productive years with Stoute.\n\n'Stoutey's work on the gallops was impressively detailed,' says Fallon. 'His work was more important than his races. That is one of the things that makes him such a great trainer. He had excellent work riders when I was there.\n\n'Kevin Prendergast, the first trainer I rode for, wouldn't let you touch his two-year-olds with the whip and Stoutey had something of the same philosophy. It's like a child going to his first day at school.\n\n'If the teacher comes out of the door, gives the kid a whack round the head and shouts \"Get in there\", the kid is going to be like a rabbit in the headlights next time he goes in. He's not going to enjoy it. He's not going to want to go back to school. You treat animals the same way you treat humans. It's not difficult.'\n\nStoute, who has won 15 English Classics, including the 2,000 Guineas five times, the 1,000 Guineas twice, the Oaks twice and the Derby five times, recognises Fallon's assessment of his attitude towards young horses. Patience — with horses, if not interviewers — is another of his trademarks.\n\n'The two-year-olds must be given a nice introduction,' says Sir Michael. 'Many trainers would share that view. I think you have to have a love for the horse as a trainer but you don't love all of them.\n\n'Some of them annoy us. Some we prefer to others. There is nothing too complex about it. You do pay a bit more attention to the ones with the most talent. Some might lie and say we treat them all the same.'\n\nFallon, like many others, regarded the owner-trainer-jockey partnership of the Aga Khan, Sir Michael and Walter Swinburn as the holy trinity of racing when he was a young jockey.\n\nTogether, they took Sir Michael's most famous horse, Shergar, to his emphatic victory in the 1981 Derby. Stoute, the only trainer to win an English Classic in five successive seasons, enjoyed successful and happy partnerships with Swinburn, Fallon and Ryan Moore. Teamwork, he says, is more important in racing than in any other sport.\n\n'On the whole,' he says, 'I like the company of jockeys. Very much so, actually. They can take me into an arena that I have never entered myself and I am also fascinated with that from the intelligent ones. I haven't race ridden but I think I have a pretty good idea of what goes on out there because of questions I have asked them and answers they have given.\n\n'I have talked a lot to football managers over the years. I was a big fan of Bobby Robson. A big fan. I know how good he was at man-management. But you don't manage the jockeys. You just build a rapport. You find it easier with some than others. We have been very lucky with our jockeys over the years.\n\n'It is very important to be able to breathe confidence into a jockey because their confidence is very fragile. It is sport at a very high level and everything is happening very quickly.\n\n'There were times when Kieren, for instance, was his own biggest critic. I remember a Goodwood meeting not going very well and I said \"You're the best, it's a tricky track\". Kieren was tough. He didn't need much of that.'\n\nStoute does not seem to need too much of it, either. He is robust. He is not a man who needs empty compliments. His focus is as fierce as ever. A former England cricket captain, who describes Stoute simply as 'a good lad', remembers being struck by how the bonhomie ended when they got to the gallops. He was only interested in one thing then. His attention was fixed on the horses.\n\n'I still love what I am doing,' says Sir Michael. 'I have got great support from my staff. The owners will retire you. It is as simple as that. Even Bobby got retired, didn't he.'\n\nHe thinks about that for a second and then adapts Lady Macbeth for the racing world. 'There comes a time,' he says, 'when you stand not upon the order of your going but bugger off immediately.'"
