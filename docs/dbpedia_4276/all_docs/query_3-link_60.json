        "text": "(a Fotomat booth, originally uploaded from Roadsidepictures from Livejournal (thank you!))\n\n(I really, REALLY wanted to work in one when I was a child–that little sweet house, filled with little things–a playhouse in the middle of the Kroger parking lot…)\n\nIn this video, recorded when I was in Cincinnati shooting two Alternative Art Journal how-to videos for Artist Network Television, Jamie Markle, publisher of North Light Books and I get a chance to talk: what brought me to New York (and then Cincinnati) and book publishing, what I hoped to be when I was a kid, and where I find inspiration. It was a fun interview. Jamie asked thought-provoking questions, and we laughed a lot.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi_2YkIABUQ&feature=relmfu"
