        "text": "Apache Angel is one of the 2021 yearlings bought by Castle View Racing last October from Tatts and has had few runs on the Flat and one over hurdles – he will race for the Race4fun partnership back on the Flat over a mile plus.\n\nAtomic Angel was broken in and trained at Girsonfield after Shaun Humphries bought her for £1200 as a yearling. She has won five times and placed 11 times – she is a small and feisty\n\nmare who has already earned her place in the ‘Elite’ Girsonfield Brood mare band – but not\n\nyet!\n\n‘Rolo’ was broken last year and just joined our yard recently. He is being brought on slowly and we will see how he goes. From the family of Aye Right. He replaces Wor Verge who recently retired after winning six races for the syndicate.\n\nDiscovered for us by our friend Rose in Ireland, this mare was broken for us by Gary Rutherford.\n\nBlame Rose won at Carlisle by 15 lengths before being 5 the in the Mares Go North series at Musselburgh in April. She has gone on to win two more races ridden by Nathan Moscrop\n\nafter her soft palette operation!\n\nA winner in July over hurdles – we bought Champ Royal at the September Goffs sale for the Northern Racing Club. He has two wins out of four runs and looks to be a superstar for the syndicate.\n\nHe has now rewarded our patience by winning his first race for us over 6f and followed that up by winning over a mile and achieving four places. He has recently won two more races including the Consolation Race for Carlisle Bell. A total of 4 wins and 11 places with Prize money up to 44K.\n\nBred by his owners Les & Viv Waugh we hope he will carry on the tradition of his uncle Gowanbuster who won five races for us.\n\nHe is about to start his career on the Flat.\n\nAnother bargain buy at only 4k as a yearling at Tatts. He had a good education last season and this he has been placed in each of his last three runs with a 3rd and 2nd twice – nearly there!\n\n‘Max’ whom we have named Ivan’s Legacy, a 2021 gelding. He is Les’s Legacy sibling also out of Morning with Ivan. He should be ready to run in a bumper as a three-year old.\n\nJimli’s Island has recently joined us from Ireland and will be looking at a career Chasing – starting for us in July. He is a big nice horse with a tremendous stride. He has been placed 4 times so far….\n\nKilmore has now had a debut run for the yard at Hexham – winning by a 1 ½ lengths!\n\nHe is owned by Payne, Bell, Severs, Moffatt & Corbett. Special mention should be made of Joe Wright who sold us this horse and Ron Payne whose colours finally got in front!\n\nKilmore is having a short break and will be back for an Autumn campaign.\n\nBought from Ireland this gelding started his career running in bumpers and has now progressed to hurdles. He is a big horse who will take time to mature and is heading to a chasing career.\n\nLes’s Legacy is a legacy left by the late Les Richards.\n\nLes’s Legacy came 2nd at Newcastle before The Tweed Valley Racing Club bought him just in time to see his first win at Hexham in May by 2 ¾ lengths. Since then he has won 3 and been placed 14 times! His best win remains the final of the BetVictor Go North Handicap Hurdle.\n\nSince coming to the yard, Pinot Rouge has had two races for us – 3rd in a Novice and then a brilliant winner of our first Class 1 Listed mares race at Doncaster in March. We look forward to her career!\n\nBoth her siblings, Bushmans Pass and Advantage Point, have won bumpers. Advantage Point also won over hurdles, was 4th in a listed race and was rated 129 over hurdles and 128 over fences.\n\nA big gelding with two winning brothers including ‘No but I Will’ rated 116 and ‘Rock on Tommy’. Bought at the Goffs May sale he needed more time to fill out and mature so he has had a break and has just been 3rd on his debut in a bumper at Hexham! He has had an educational hurdling career with three places from five runs and will go chasing after his summer break.\n\nRogers Dream (previously ‘Harriet’) is out of the black type mare Virginia Hall who has already bred four winners from four runners including the black type Spygate and Marie of Lyon.\n\nShe is about to make her debut.\n\nStraight from his breeder in Ireland, Samwise made a very good account of himself by coming 4th in his first bumper at Catterick in November. He was beaten by 1/2 length by a horse bought for £89,000. He did not run so well at Wetherby but put in a great effort to be 3rd at Carlisle\n\nOne bumper left to go before he starts his hurdling career.\n\nThis young mare is a well build, agile horse who has ran in two Irish Point to Points. She was 5th and 6th making a good account of herself. 50% is for sale.\n\nShe has ran in one bumper where she was 6th in a very competitive field – she is a very exciting horse for the future.\n\n‘Bob’ arrived on the yard after a short spell in Ireland with Gavin Cromwell. He needed some time but is proving very promising so far. His sibling, Come on Gruff, has won a bumper and two hurdle races over 2.4m including at Ludlow in March and is now rated 115. He has been placed four times so far including 2 x seconds…"
