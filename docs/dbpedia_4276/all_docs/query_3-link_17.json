        "text": "There is a widespread belief, based on the assumption that the field contains no potential superstar, that this is a sub-standard Arc. The perception may well be accurate. It should be pointed out, though, that great races don't exist just to confirm the greatness of those who came into them with mighty reputations. They often throw up great horses, too.\n\nIn any case, it's hard to pour much scorn on a championship event whose cast includes every major middle-distance Classic winner in Europe. One result of the absence of a dominating colossus is that this year's Arc is much more open, and therefore more punter-friendly, than usual. The going will be crucial and, given the probability of fine weather in Paris, its condition will depend on the Longchamp authorities, who intend to produce ground just on the soft side of good.\n\nPatriotic Brits who, as usual, will make up about half the crowd, will no doubt get stuck into North Light; but faith in the Fallon-Stoute combination will be the main reason for the Epsom hero's popularity, and neither has yet won an Arc. North Light was certainly the best middle-distance colt in Europe on firm ground in early June. By the end of that month he had been overtaken by Grey Swallow, who beat him in the Irish Derby. North Light's failure to reappear since then means he's done no further damage to his reputation. It's hardly grounds for confidence, even so. Stoute declared him a definite runner only 10 days ago.\n\nGrey Swallow, just a respectable fourth last time out behind Azamour over a possibly inadequate trip, was himself an uncertain runner until last weekend. He has been supplemented for the race at a cost of more than €60,000, but Dermot Weld's description of his latest work as 'satisfactory' is not the sort of endorsement to send anyone rushing to the pawn shop for ammunition.\n\nThese two aren't alone among the three-year-olds in giving grounds for concern. Bago, for some time trumpeted as this year's mandatory wonder horse, lost his unbeaten record behind Sulamani at York, and then could finish only third behind Valixir and Prospect Park in the usually informative Prix Niel. His humans also vacillated and decided on the Arc rather than the Breeders' Cup Classic.\n\nSince he represents André Fabre, Valixir would have attracted heavy support if he hadn't drawn the outside stall. Lord Derby's Ouija Board, unbeaten against her own sex this year, is another whose connections spent time headscratching before they decided on the Arc; and Latice, who boasted a similarly immaculate record until three weeks ago, seemed clearly not to stay when disappointing in the Prix Vermeille.\n\nIt says plenty about the uncertainties surrounding the three-year-olds that some of the old reliables feature near the top of the betting. Warrsan is a marvellous campaigner and seems better than ever at the age of six. His victory in the Grosser Preis von Baden may have represented a career high; but Warrsan is not, and perhaps never will be, a real pulse quickener.\n\nFrankie Dettori's Mamool looks very much like a Godolphin stopgap after the loss of form of Doyen and Sulamani. Although comparisons have been made between his record and that of their 2003 Arc winner Marienbard, it's easier to imagine him running fourth or fifth than winning. Vallee Enchantee has a chance if returning to the form she showed in winning the Hong Kong Vase, but she hasn't been seen since her flop in the King George.\n\nIn such an open race it makes sense to look for unknown quantities, and in the absence of Shirocco who withdrew yesterday, one seems to stand out. If the form of his victory in the Japan Cup is taken at face value, then Tap Dance City, who had the Breeders' Cup Turf deadheater Johar almost a distance behind him, is already a great horse. That form has to be treated with caution, however, because he may well have been the only one acting on the wet ground.\n\nThe Japanese star is, however, a formidable competitor on firm ground, too, as he proved at Group One level over 11 furlongs last time, and having overcome his transport problems (a substitute plane had to be found for him after the first broke down on its way to Tokyo) this front-runner, who's won 11 of his 16 races at home, could be a serious danger to all. Any rain should increase his chance, but it seems reasonable to guess, even allowing for any advantages he may have enjoyed in the Asian equivalent, that the Japanese invader will be crowned champion in what may - or may not - turn out to be a relatively ordinary year for Europe's greatest race.\n\nARC BETTING\n\n5-1 North Light\n\n6-1 Grey Swallow\n\n8-1 Warrsan\n\n12-1 Bago, Valixir\n\n14-1 Mamool, Ouija Board, Prospect Park\n\n16-1 Tap Dance City, Vallee Enchantee\n\n25-1 Cherry Mix, Latice, Policy Maker\n\n33-1 Blue Canari"
