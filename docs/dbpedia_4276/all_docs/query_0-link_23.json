        "text": "Desert Crown handed trainer Sir Michael Stoute a sixth Cazoo (Epsom) Derby success with an impressive score in the 243rd running of the world-famous flat race at Epsom Downs June 4, winning by two and a half lengths from Hoo Ya Mal (150-1). Westover (25-1) was a further head behind in third.\n\nThis year’s Cazoo Derby was run in memory of jockey Lester Piggott, who won the premier Classic a record nine times and passed away peacefully aged 86 on May 29th. The race was also held during Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth’s Platinum Jubilee celebration, although for the first time, The Queen was not in attendance.\n\nA field of 17 was assembled for the 1 1/2 mile classic around the undulating Epsom course. Desert Crown, unbeaten in his first two career races, was favoured over a host of top colts including Aidan O’Brien trainee Stone Age and Nations Pride from the yard of Charlie Appleby.\n\nUnfortunately, the start of the race was delayed when protestors ran onto the course and had to be physically removed. And, as the horses were circling near the gate before the start, a large fireworks display, with pink and purple coloured smoke, was set off, noticeably unnerving many of the horses. The fireworks display attracted much controversy from horsepeople and the public on social media.\n\nOnce underway, the Derby field was led early by Changingoftheguard, track by West Wind Blows. Kingscote and Desert crown stalked in sixth while three paths removed from the rail.\n\nAs the field went around Tattenham Corner to the homestretch, Kingscote appeared to take another hold of his colt, not wanting to move too soon.\n\nWith less than two furlongs to go, Desert Crown was given his cue and he galloped past the leaders on his way to an easy win over longshot Hoo Ya Mal. Westover, owned by Juddmonte Farms, had a troubled journey and finished fastest of all to be third.\n\nStoute was previously successful with Shergar (1981), Shahrastani (1986), Kris Kin (2003), North Light (2004) and Workforce (2010).\n\nBorn in Barbados on 22nd October 1945, the 76-year-old Stoute becomes the oldest known trainer to win the Derby, surpassing 75-year-old Mat Dawson who saddled Sir Visto to victory in 1895. Based at Freemason Lodge in Newmarket, Stoute also trains horses for The Queen.\n\nIt was a first Derby victory for jockey Richard Kingscote. The 35-year-old was having his second Derby ride. He finished 11th on Knight To Behold in 2018 on his only previous Derby ride.\n\nIt was a second Derby win for owner Saeed Suhail, who previously saw his colours carried to victory by Kris Kin in 2003.\n\nIt is the first Derby victory for Desert Crown’s sire, Nathaniel. Desert Crown was bred by Strawberry Fields Stud, based at Teversham near Newmarket. He was sold for 280,000 Guineas as a yearling at Tattersalls in October 2020.\n\nQuotes from Sir Michael Stoute:\n\n“He was very cool (Richard Kingscote) and he rode a beautiful race. It was wrong (jokes about the three cheers) it should have been for the horse. I appreciate it though. It has been a great afternoon. I am to be proud of that (oldest trainer to win the Derby at age 76), I’m proud of the horse.\n\n“We were very hopeful after York that he might win the Derby. His performance delighted me as he had it won a long way out. He has got such a good mind to go with his ability.\n\n“From an early stage he was having little niggles, that is why he didn’t run until the backend last year. There was nothing serious, he was maturing and developing and that was causing a few little problems with niggles.\n\n“That was a foot problem (why he wasn’t out until the Dante). I was very happy when he got to the top of the hill where he was positioned. He travelled and he is a good athlete, he floated down the hill.\n\n“Shergar was very special and he hasn’t quite reached that stage but he has potential. It is a wonderful thrill (to be back here) for the whole yard.\n\n“It is a delight to train good horses and fortunately we have come across another good one.\n\n“I didn’t know (if those days of training a Derby winner would return). When you realise and as time goes on your chances lessen. It has been a lot of years (since our last Derby winner) which I didn’t think there would be.”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4dSmjSNK48"
