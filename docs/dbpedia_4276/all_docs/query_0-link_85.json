        "text": "Sir Michael, 76, revealed yesterday that she was soon on the phone to congratulate him and the team behind the success. “I spoke to the Queen late afternoon, She was very pleased for the team,” he said.\n\nThe Queen has never had a Derby winner but her last triumph in a Group One race came when Estimate, trained by Sir Michael, triumphed in the 2013 Gold Cup at Royal Ascot.\n\nAsked yesterday what it was like to receive a congratulatory message from the monarch, he joked: “I forgot what it was like!”\n\nThe Jockey Club sent souvenir racecards to Windsor to help the Queen enjoy the action from home.\n\nShe regularly rings trainers to congratulate them when they have won with one of her horses but it is less usual for her to call when the winner of a big race is not one of hers.\n\nSir Michael, who paid tribute to his entire team, is now the oldest trainer to win a Derby. His previous successes were Shergar (1981), Shahrastani (1986), Kris Kin (2003), North Light (2004) and Workforce (2010). Only Aidan O’Brien (eight wins) and Fred Darling (seven wins) have saddled a greater number.\n\nAsked if he has the same drive as when he started training, he said: “I can’t be the judge of that as it was so long ago I can’t remember.\n\n“Some mornings you are bouncier than others it depends what has happened the day before. It doesn’t do you any harm winning a race like this and it is great for morale all the way round.”"
