        "text": "Twenty NINE years on from his first Derby success withShergar, Sir Michael Stoute was delighted by win No.5.\n\nOn a blazing afternoon at Epson, Workforce stormed home in the calendar’s premier Classic.\n\nThe Freemason Lodge trainer watched his horse romp in seven lengths clear of 100-1 outsider At First Sight, rekindling memories of Shergar triumphing by a record 10 lengths in 1981.\n\n“It’s one of the great feelings because it’s one of the great races, if not the greatest of them all,” said a delighted Stoute.\n\n“Workforce won on his first time out, which was a run brimming with promise, but then he became a bit frustrating in the spring.\n\n“This horse is a big fellow and when he threw a dirty scope in the early part of his build-up it put us behind schedule. But after his racecourse gallop atLingfield, I knew he was dead right for the Derby.”\n\nOwner Prince Khalid Abdullah watched his silks carried to Derby glory for the first time since Commander In Chief in 1993 – and his racing manager Lord Grimthorpe said: “The prince is absolutely chuffed to bits.”\n\nStoute was loathe to compare Workforce with any of his other Derby winners, of which Shergar stands out as a very special colt.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Workforce surpasses the heights reached by the remaining three: Shahrastani, Kris Kin and North Light.\n\nShergar went on to complete the Epsom Derby/Irish Derby double.\n\nAnd Grimthorpe added: “You don’t have to be a clairvoyant to see the Irish Derby will be the next port of call.”\n\nNo bookies are betting on the Irish Derby but Workforce was cut from 33-1 into 6-1 for the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe by Victor Chandler."
