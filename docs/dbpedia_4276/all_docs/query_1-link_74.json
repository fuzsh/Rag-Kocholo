        "text": "Show me a Stoute 2 year old that got beat a neck by it’s stablemate, when ‘arguably’ given an easier ride – and then I will answer the question on Clive’s behalf\n\nPersonally I don’t buy the stablemate argument- don’t think it matters if it was a stablemate or not- the filly was merely there for a nice introduction.\n\nAs for a Stoute 2yo who could have won first time out under a more vigorous ride, look no further than subsequent Derby winner North Light’s first run at Sandown.\n\nIf you look back at Kitty Matcham’s debut she got a very tender introduction…asked to win the race if she could but nothing over the top…and look where it has ended up for connections. Common sense has to come into play for punters and they cannot just keep crying foul.\n\nThe North Light introduction was the first one I thought of as well trackside.\n\nThis I think was worse than Magna Cum Laude, however bad that may have looked, because there must a huge doubt as to whether he would have beaten Achill Island. In this instance Psalm would almost certainly have won under a more vigorous ride. It seems from the outside that O’Brien can do exactly as he wants and the Irish racing authorities have little or no inclination to do anything about it. Whatever the type of race a horse should be seen to do it’s best to win it – that was not the case here.\n\nInterestingly, Stoute was mentioned in passing. A couple of weeks ago Kerrin McEvoy produced the worst ride I have seen all season on a 2yo called City Stable at Windsor. A short priced favourite (having been given a very easy intoduction) he sat ‘miles’ behind the second favourite who duly bolted up. In my opinion this was much worse than any of the above and a month’s ‘holiday’ for all concerned would have seemed lenient. As far as I am aware nothing happened.\n\nUnfortunately, unless the stewards change radically, there is going to be no improvement because we are fooling ourselves if we think the likes of O’Brien or Stoute, to name but two, give a monkeys about the average punter – incidently I didn’t back any of the horses concerned.\n\n\"North Light\n\nin touch, pushed along after 2f and again over 3f out, quickened approaching final furlong, strong run under hand driving inside final furlong, just failed\"\n\nBeaten a short head by a horse not from the same yard, doesn’t seem comparable to me.\n\nWhy not Col? It seems to me that Madman’s issue with the Psalm ride is that the filly wasn’t given every possible opportunity to win. Surely the same premise applies here; by not going for the whip, the jockey (not going to say who, but you can probably guess ) did not give the horse every opportunity to win.. hope I’m not putting words in your mouth MM, and correct me if I’m wrong!\n\nI don’t agree with the above I might add, as I didn’t have an issue with the ride. I was merely proving why the two cases are relevant, according to MM’s logic, as far as I understand it."
