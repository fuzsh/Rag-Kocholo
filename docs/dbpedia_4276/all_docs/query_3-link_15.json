        "text": "Derby winner North Light (Ire) (Danehill) was euthanized on Mar. 20 due to complications from laminitis, The Stronach Group announced on Thursday. The 23-year-old stallion had been pensioned since 2020 and will be laid to rest at Adena South in Ocala Florida. Bred and raced by Ballymacoll Stud and trained by Sir Michael Stoute, the son of G1 Prix du Cadran heroine Sought Out (Ire) (Rainbow Quest) won one of two starts at two, and added the G2 Dante S. and G1 Derby in succession during the spring of 2004....\n\nMucho Macho Man (Macho Uno--Ponche de Leona, by Ponche), winner of the 2013 GI Breeders' Cup Classic, will stand the 2024 breeding season at Adena Springs in Ontario, Canada. The 16-year-old stallion is the sire of GI Pegasus World Cup Invitational S. winner Mucho Gusto, as well as graded winners City Man and Mucho Unusual. He will stand for C$4,500 LF/S&N.\n\nHorses aren't supposed to be able to do what Ghostzapper did. The Hall of Famer was so dazzling that the 128 Beyer Speed Figure he registered in the GIII Philip H. Iselin H.--still the highest figure in the history of American racing at a route--isn't even remembered as one of his top races. Some people might count his GI Vosburgh sprinting at three against older horses as one of his best, others might prefer his GI Woodward battle over eventual Horse of the Year Saint Liam, and still others might...\n\nJim and Dana Bernhard, recent buyers of the 793-acre Pin Oak Stud near Versailles, KY, have acquired an additional 465 acres from Adena Springs, bringing the total size of the farm to just over 1,250 acres. The land, purchased from eight-time Eclipse Champion Breeder Adena Springs, connects the existing Pin Oak land on the east side of US-60--commonly known as Versailles Road--with an entrance on Old Frankfort Pike. \"Frank Stronach's Adena Springs and Josephine Abercrombie's Pin Oak Stud are two legendary farms. Both were champion breeders focused on raising the...\n\nThe name Canuck Racing Club might not be a familiar one to most folks in the horse racing industry, however at least one of the personalities behind it most certainly is. Less than two weeks ago in Saratoga Springs, New York, bloodstock agent Donato Lanni made his presence felt when signing the tickets on five yearlings--led by a pair of sales-topping colts--totaling over $9 million in gross expenditures. Already well established south of the border, the Montreal-raised Lanni decided to forge a deeper stake into the Canadian industry over the...\n\nMoira (Ghostzapper), dominant winner against males in last year's Queen's Plate S., took home both Horse of the Year and Champion 3-Year-Old honors at the 48th Annual Sovereign Awards ceremony hosted by the Jockey Club of Canada on Thursday. The evening began with a commemoration of the club's 50th anniversary and recognition of the founding members from 1973. The top three finalists in each category are determined by the online ballots of the Jockey Club of Canada's voters. The media category award finalists were determined by professionals within the industry...\n\nETOBICOKE, ON--Heading into the 163rd Queen's Plate, most of the pre-race talk swirled around X-Men Racing, Madaket Stables and SF Racing's Moira (Ghostzapper), and her pre-Woodbine Oaks antics that led to her ultimately running, and romping, without hind shoes. Keeping her shoes--if not entirely her composure--firmly intact prior to Sunday's Classic fixture at Woodbine, the filly appeared to sprout wings in the stretch, cruising to an eye-catching seven-length victory over the Mark Casse-trained pair of Hall of Dreams (Lemon Drop Kid) and Sir For Sure (Sligo Bay {Ire}). \"There are...\n\nThe Jockey Club of Canada has announced the finalists for the 2021 Sovereign Awards, which honor Canada's champions and recognizes their outstanding achievements in Canadian Thoroughbred Racing and Breeding. The winner of each category, along with Canada's Horse of the Year for 2021, will be announced during the 47th Annual Sovereign Award Ceremony that will be held on the evening of Thursday, Apr. 14, 2022 at Universal Eventspace in Vaughan, Ontario. Tickets can also be purchased online here. The 2021 Media Awards finalists, the winner of the Award for Outstanding...\n\nAlphabet Soup (Cozzene--Illiterate, by Arts and Letters), who won a memorable renewal of the GI Breeders' Cup Classic at Woodbine in 1996, died Jan. 28 at Old Friends Thoroughbred Retirement Farm in Georgetown, Kentucky, due to chronic kidney disease. The oldest living Classic winner, the gray was 31 years old and had been pensioned at the farm since 2015. Bred in Pennsylvania by Southeast Associates, Alphabet Soup was trained by David Hofmans for Georgia B. Ridder and came to hand at four in 1995, winning the GII Del Mar Budweiser...\n\nLEXINGTON, KY - The Keeneland January Horses of All Ages Sale continued Thursday with a third session dominated by mares from the Godolphin draft. Dan Hall, acting on behalf of Frank Stronach's Adena Springs, made the day's highest bid when going to $480,000 to acquire the unraced Crowning Jewel (Into Mischief). Sheikh Mohammed's operation, on track to earn the Eclipse Award as leading breeder of 2021, was responsible for three of the session's top four prices. In all, 259 head sold Thursday for a gross of $5,471,700. The session average...\n\nAdena Springs Farm, located near Paris, Ky., will be sold, according to Dallas real estate firm Icon Global. Frank Stronach purchased the land that makes up the 2,300-acre property in 2005 and built the facility from scratch, opening it in 2007. It is capable of handling over 1,000 horses and has been the home of a number of prominent stallions, including homebreds Awesome Again and Ghostzapper. Adena Springs Farm is part of The Stronach Group's (TSG) real estate portfolio and is being sold under the direction of its Chairman, Chief...\n\nKeeneland has named bloodstock consultant Cormac Breathnach, Ph.D., associated for many years with first Adena Springs and then Airdrie stallions, as its new Director of Sales Operations. Breathnach succeeds Geoffrey Russell, who retired in April after 25 years with Keeneland. Russell will remain in a consulting role with Keeneland through the rest of 2021. \"We are excited to have Cormac join the Keeneland sales team as the Director of Sales Operations,\" Keeneland Vice President of Sales Tony Lacy said. \"I have long admired his professionalism, knowledge, and integrity, which is..."
