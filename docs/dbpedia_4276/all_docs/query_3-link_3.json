        "text": "Using some strong statistics, it is possible to narrow down this year's Derby field to two runners. Only horses at the very peak of form win (19 of the past 23 victors had won on their previous run). Concentrate on horses at the front of the betting, too (16 of the past 18 winners started at 12-1 or under). Horses beaten in Classics and with suspect stamina (second favourite Snow Ridge fails on both counts) should be ruled out. Since American Post would have finished third, at best, in a Classic last time, but for Antonius Pius swerving near the finish, and Percussionist likely to be done for pace, that leaves Yeats and North Light as the qualifiers. They ran in the best Derby trials of modern times, the Derrinstown Stud Stakes at Leopardstown and the Dante Stakes at York, and are very solid picks on the big-race trends. Yeats is a short price for what he achieved in his latest race, when he did not appear to have a lot in hand, and North Light, who has abundant stamina, hails from the top-class yard of Sir Michael Stoute. He has plenty in his favour, and won't mind if the rain comes.\n\nWith trainer Henry Cecil - who amazingly has won four of the past eight runnings of Friday's Oaks - in grave decline, the stables to focus on are those of Godolphin and Aidan O'Brien, who have impressive records. Fancied runners who performed well in a Guineas or one of the Classic trials have been dominant. In what looks an open year, Godolphin have an obvious candidate in 1,000 Guineas runner-up Sundrop , but stable companion Punctilious , who won the Musidora Stakes at York, has similar prospects and confidence would be increased if she is the mount of stable jockey Frankie Dettori.\n\nHow they bet\n\nThe Derby\n\n11-4 Yeats\n\n10-3 Snow Ridge\n\n4 North Light\n\n12 American Post, Salford City\n\n14 Percussionist\n\n16 Let the Lion Roar\n\n20 Ecomium, Rule of Law\n\n25 Azamour, Grey Swallow\n\n33 Cairdeas\n\n40 and up others\n\nThe Oaks\n\n11-4 Sundrop\n\n10-3 Punctilious\n\n5 Ouija Board\n\n7 All Too Beautiful\n\n14 Baraka, Hathrah\n\n25 Necklace"
