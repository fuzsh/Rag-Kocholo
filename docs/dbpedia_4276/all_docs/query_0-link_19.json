        "text": "It will come as no surprise to witness Sir Michael Stoute conducting a triumphal interview in the Classic winners' enclosure at Epsom this week, as the Freemason Lodge trainer is doubly represented in both the Oaks today and the Derby tomorrow.\n\nYet, but for a quirk of history, Stoute could be at the other end of the microphone from the one to which we have become accustomed. He could have pursued a much more worthy calling. He could have been a press man.\n\nIt was his failure in 1965 to land the job as BBC racing correspondent that was to have ongoing ramifications for the training industry, even long after the appointee, Julian Wilson, had been replaced by Clare Balding, Willie Carson and a box.\n\n\"When I didn't get it, I thought I'd been there and done that and decided to kick on with the other business. It's all been downhill since, with the occasional up.\"\n\nThese occasional ups include eight trainers' championships, two Oaks, four Derbys and acknowledgement as one of the greatest practitioners of his art on the planet. \"I know for a fact I've been very fortunate,\" he says. \"I've always got a bit of an opening when I needed one, the sort of opportunities not a lot of people get.\"\n\nIt is possible to believe that Stoute has also won many of the international trophies worth having - including the Dubai World Cup, Japan Cup and success at the Breeders' Cup series - by dint of good luck. But you would have to be as barmy as the trainer himself appears to be as he patrols the Newmarket gallops.\n\nYou can tell when Michael Ronald Stoute is coming in the mornings because he either whistles or sings all the time. Sometimes a booming laugh breaks the East Anglian air. One day, a huge butterfly net will come plonking down on him.\n\nStoute is also a strange cove after he has won a race. He comes puffing into the winners' enclosure with an instinct to avoid speaking to the people who could have been his workmates. The press pack is usually slipped with a sidestep admirably nimble in a man of 60 as Stoute peers into the distance as if a long-lost relative has been spotted.\n\nWhen he does speak, it is in a mellifluous Caribbean basso profundo (his family stretches back to the 1600s in Barbados), the sort of voice that might communicate with micro-organisms at the bottom of the sea. This week it has been talking about the quest for yet another Derby.\n\n\"It's the Derby which is the seriously important race of them all,\" Stoute says. \"It creates more natural buzz because it's a race with great history and it's run in England. It's the history, the venue, the test of the race. It's still the one that everyone wants to win.\"\n\nBut the first two arrows Stoute pulls from his Epsom Classic quiver this afternoon carry the names of the Oaks aspirants Riyalma and Short Skirt. \"They have both won good trials and I am very happy with their condition,\" says the trainer who has won the fillies' championship with Fair Salinia (1978) and Unite (1987).\n\n\"She showed a good turn of foot in the end in the Musidora,\" Stoute says of Short Skirt, the mount of Michael Kinane. \"We did have slight reservations about the contours of Epsom, but the most important factor for her is the going and we will get suitable ground. You would stay away from a firm-ground Epsom. Riyalma showed she handled tacky ground at Newmarket and I'm very happy with her.\"\n\nThe colts' career around Tattenham Corner has been left this year to Best Alibi and Papal Bull. The latter camouflaged his form until the Chester Vase, after which he had to be re-entered into the Derby at a cost of Â£75,000.\n\n\"Obviously it was an error [taking him out of the race at an earlier forfeit stage],\" Stoute says. \"But we were looking at the form of an 88-rated horse who had raced in two maidens and then won at Leicester in workmanlike fashion. I didn't think we had a Derby horse on our hands. After Chester, we had to change our views.\n\n\"He's a progressive colt. He just missed the beat at Chester and was a bit further back than Kieren [Fallon] would have liked. But he learned a lot because he was tight on the fence and he was on and off the bridle. I liked the way he picked up. Kieren said that if he had got into gear earlier he would have been an easy winner.\"\n\nVictory for Papal Bull would provide another valuable stallion prospect for his Coolmore connections. \"I am very well aware of the commercial aspects of the sport,\" Stoute says. \"That's my job. But it would be ungrateful to call it pressure. I always like what Jack Berry says, that it's much tougher at the bottom. We're lucky to have that calibre of horse.\n\n\"We look at every year as a different year and we realise we have to achieve. There are a lot of owners to keep happy and a lot of lads competitive with each other because it might be their turn that particular year. We're happy but we're not satisfied. We want to keep doing it and the fear of failure is always there.\"\n\nAnd even failure, as an interview 40 years ago certainly proved, can work for Michael Stoute.\n\nGreat days in Derby for master trainer\n\nShergar (1981) 10-11 fav\n\nWon by a record 10 lengths but Irish Derby and King George wins were followed by St Leger defeat and tragic end after a botched kidnap in 1983\n\n\"He was just an exceptional machine, a natural athlete with this different cruising speed. He just destroyed them from the turn in. He and Galileo were the two Derby winners I've seen who floated around there.\" Stoute\n\nShahrastani (1986) 11-2\n\nWon one of the most controversial Derbys of recent times when holding off the late challenge of Dancing Brave, extreme left, who was given far too much to do by jockey Greville Starkey\n\n\"Shahrastani was a better horse on Irish Derby day [when he won by eight lengths] than he was at Epsom.\" Stoute\n\nKris Kin (2003) 6-1\n\nFirst Derby winner to have been supplemented for the race and landed a huge gamble, but eventually rated one of the worst winners of recent times, having failed to win again\n\n\"You would have to say that Kris Kin didn't win the greatest Derby I'd ever seen, but we'd gone a long time without winning one before he came along.\" Stoute\n\nNorth Light (2004) 7-2\n\nEpsom was easily North Light's greatest hour, as he never won a race after the Derby and was retired through injury after just one run the following season"
