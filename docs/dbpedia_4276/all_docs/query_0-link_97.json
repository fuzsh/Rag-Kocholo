        "text": "The 6-1 shot annihilated his 11 rivals to win by seven lengths, giving Moore his first Derby win and Stoute, whose first Epsom triumph came with the ill-fated Shergar in 1981, his fifth success.\n\nLike the acclaimed Shergar, who won his Derby by a record 10 lengths, Workforce trounced a high-class field to win in a race record time, smashing nearly one second off Lammtarra's victory time of 2 minutes 32.31 seconds in 1995.\n\n\"It's a special day. He (Workforce) travelled beautifully and quickened very well,\" said the 26-year-old Moore, who won the Oaks, the fillies' Classic, on Friday with Snow Fairy.\n\nHorse Racing\n\nRacing results: Saturday June 5\n\n05/06/2010 at 22:22\n\nWorkforce took the lead from front-running At First Sight (100-1) with 300 metres to go and came home unchallenged. Third place in the field of 12 went to Rewilding (9-2), the mount of Frankie Dettori.\n\nJan Vermeer, the 9-4 favourite who had been strongly backed to give Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien a third Derby win, finished fourth.\n\nStoute also won the Derby with Shahrastani (1986), Kris Kin (2003) and North Light (2004).\n\n\"He was seriously good today, wasn't he?\" Stoute, who like Moore is a man of few words in front of the media, said of Workforce.\n\nOf his jockey, Stoute added: \"I'm thrilled for Ryan. He missed out on Conduit in 2008 and this is a monkey off his back.\"\n\nConduit won the 2008 St Leger, the final Classic of the flat racing season, for Stoute but Moore had rejected the ride to partner stable mate Doctor Fremantle.\n\nHorse Racing\n\nDefender Burghley Horse Trials joins fight against MND\n\n03/04/2024 at 14:06\n\nHorse Racing\n\nScott recalls Queen Elizabeth II discussed horses with trainer two days before her death\n\n19/09/2022 at 12:01"
