        "text": "There are hundreds of horse breeds found around the world, each uniquely adapted to their local environment and role in human society.\n\nHorses vary widely in appearance, size, and conformation, reflecting the particular conditions of their breed characteristics. Some are strong and heavy, ideal for farm work or pulling loads, while others are swift and agile, perfect for racing or equestrian sports.\n\nMany of North America’s most popular horse breeds are ones developed in Canada or the United States, while others have European, Asian or South American lineage.\n\nAlthough most North Americans no longer rely on equids for work and transportation, the continent is still home to millions of horses. Modern horse owners primarily use horses for recreation, companionship, and competition.\n\nThis article will discuss the most popular horse breeds in North America, particularly on Canadian and United States populations.\n\nHorse Breed Background\n\nHorse breeds are groups of horses with shared characteristics that are distinctively identified and passed down through generations. These characteristics can include external features such as color, size, and build, as well as inherent traits like temperament, gait, and performance abilities.\n\nKey aspects of a horse breed include:\n\nGenetic Consistency: Horse breeds are established through selective breeding, where horses with desired traits are bred over generations to reinforce these traits within the population. The offspring consistently exhibit these specific characteristics.\n\nBreed Standards: Most horse breeds have defined standards set by breed registries or associations. These standards detail the ideal characteristics, including physical attributes and temperament, that horses of the breed should possess.\n\nRegistration: For a horse to be officially recognized as belonging to a particular breed, it typically needs to be registered with a breed registry. This process often requires proof of pedigree, demonstrating that the horse descends from recognized members of the breed.\n\nPurpose and Use: Many horse breeds were originally developed for specific purposes, such as work, racing, riding, or show. For example, Thoroughbreds are known for racing, Clydesdales for heavy draft work, and Arabians for endurance.\n\nHeritage and Origin: Each breed has its own history and geographic origin. The development of a breed is often closely tied to the culture and needs of the people in its region of origin.\n\nHorse breeds may also have common tendencies towards certain health issues or genetic disorders, and they often require breed-specific management and care practices.\n\nThe breed of a horse also affects its suitability for various equestrian disciplines and determines the shows and competitions in which it can participate.\n\nGlobal Equine Demographics\n\nThe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates the global horse population is approximately 60 million. The organization’s database includes records of 786 horse breeds, with varying breed demographics depending on the country. [1][2]\n\nOne 2010 study found the Arabian was the most widely distributed horse breed worldwide, present in 59 different countries. The Thoroughbred was the second most widely distributed breed, residing in 45 countries. [2]\n\nNorth American Population\n\nAccording to the latest data from the American Horse Council and Equestrian Canada, North America is home to over 12% of the horses in the world. [3][4]\n\nThe American Horse Council’s (AHC) 2017 National Economic Impact Study estimated a total U.S. equine population of 7.2 million horses. [3] However, some believe that this number understates how many horses there are in the United States.\n\nA study by Equestrian Canada estimates that between 478,268 – 545,136 horses lived in Canada in 2021. Although, a 2009 report estimated a horse population of 963,500, suggesting that the number may be significantly higher. [5]\n\nActivities and Uses\n\nSurveys by the American Horse Council and Equestrian Canada also reveal the most popular activities and uses of horses in North America.\n\nU.S. Horse Population\n\nThe following is the estimated number of horses categorized by activity in the U.S.: [3]\n\nRecreation – 3,141,449\n\nShowing – 1,227,986\n\nRacing – 1,224,482\n\nWorking – 537,261\n\nCanadian Horse Population\n\nBelow is the estimated percentage of horses by use in Canada: [5]\n\nRecreation – 28%\n\nAmateur Sport – 24.5%\n\nWorking – 19%\n\nBreeding – 14%\n\nProfessional Sport – 8%\n\nElite Sport – 4%\n\nRacing – 2.5%\n\nPopular Horse Breeds\n\nIn 2015, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) completed an equine census that included statistics on breed populations in the U.S. While this census only reflects horses kept on commercial farms, it offers valuable insight into North America’s most popular horse breeds. [4]\n\nHere is a list of the most popular horse breeds in the United States according to data from the USDA.\n\nAmerican Quarter Horse (42.1%)\n\nThoroughbred (7.1%)\n\nAmerican Paint Horse (6.8%)\n\nMiniature Horse (5.1%)\n\nDraft Horses (4.7%)\n\nTennessee Walking Horse (4.5%)\n\nGrade Horse (4.1%)\n\nArabian (3.9%)\n\nStandardbred (3.7%)\n\nWarmbloods (3.2%)\n\nSaddlebred (2.5%)\n\nAppaloosa (1.9%)\n\nMorgan (1.4%)\n\nMustang (1.0%)\n\n1. American Quarter Horse\n\nBy a wide margin, the American Quarter Horse is the most popular breed in North America.\n\nQuarter Horses are one of the oldest recognized American horse breeds. Initially bred for quarter-mile races, Quarter Horses thrive as western mounts and working ranch horses. They are well-known for their excellent character and versatility. [6]\n\nHousehold surveys by the AHC indicate there are 2.1 million Quarter Horses living in the U.S. [3] This accounts for 42.1% of horses in all commercial operations included in the 2015 USDA census, representing the majority of horses in the West and South Central regions. [4]\n\nThe American Quarter Horse Association is the official North American breed registry for Quarter Horses. The AQHA maintains the records of over 6 million Quarter Horses registered since 1940.\n\n2. Thoroughbred\n\nThe Thoroughbred is the second most popular equine breed in North America. Thoroughbreds are characterized as being fast, athletic horses.\n\nThe U.S. horse racing industry produces tens of thousands of Thoroughbreds each year. Many of these off-the-track Thoroughbreds find successful second careers as riding horses after retiring from their racing careers. [7]\n\nThe AHC survey reported a U.S. population of 1.1 million Thoroughbreds. [3] These horses comprised 7.1% of the resident horses in the USDA census, and they are most common in the Northeast and Southeast regions of the country. [4]\n\nThe Jockey Club maintains the official North American breed registry for Thoroughbred horses. Their pedigree database dates back to the late 1800s and contains information on over 1.8 million horses. [7]\n\n3. American Paint Horse\n\nThe American Paint Horse is one of the fastest-growing horse breeds in North America, closely related to the Quarter Horse. In the 2015 USDA census, American Paint Horses accounted for 6.8% of resident horses. [4]\n\nThese horses are particularly favored in Western disciplines due to their distinct coat colours and stock horse bloodlines that help them stand out.\n\nThe American Paint Horse Association is the official breed organization for Paint Horses and processes approximately 50,000 new registrations each year. [8]\n\nUnlike some breeds, American Paint Horses must meet both colour and bloodline requirements for registration.\n\n4. Miniature Horse\n\nAmerican Miniature Horses are the smallest equine breed in the world. These horses resemble full-size horses, but stand less than 34 inches tall at the withers.\n\nMiniature Horses accounted for 5.1% of the horse population reported by the USDA census. [4] In North America, Miniature horses are popular companion animals, driving horses, and halter show horses. Some minis work as guide animals.\n\nThe American Miniature Horse Association is North America’s largest breed registry for miniature horses.\n\n5. Draft Horses\n\nDraft horse breeds, also known as draught horses or heavy horses, are a group of large horse breeds primarily bred for heavy work such as plowing, farming, and hauling heavy loads. Together, draft horses make up 4.7% of the U.S. equine population included in the USDA census. [4]\n\nPopular draft breeds in North America include:\n\nBelgian Draft Horse\n\nClydesdale\n\nShire\n\nPercheron\n\nThese heavy horses are most common in the Northeast region of the United States. Some communities still rely on draft horses as strong working animals, but these gentle giants are also popular for recreation.\n\n6. Tennessee Walking Horse\n\nTennessee Walking Horses are one of the most popular breeds of gaited horses in North America.\n\nGaited breeds have smooth ambling gaits that are comfortable to ride. The Tennessee Walking Horse performs a unique four-beat running walk.\n\nIn the USDA survey, Tennessee Walking Horses accounted for 4.5% of the total U.S. equine population. [4] These horses are most popular in the American South, where they originated.\n\nThe Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders’ and Exhibitors’ Association manages the North American breed registry for these horses.\n\n7. Grade Horse\n\nIn the USDA census, horse owners classified 4.1% of horses as grade horses, which are horses that lack documented pedigree or purebred ancestry.\n\nThese horses don’t have registration papers with any breed organization. [4]\n\n8. Arabian\n\nArabians are one of the oldest and most famous horse breeds in the world. Originally from the Arabian Peninsula, these light horses are beautiful and charismatic, with a talent for endurance riding.\n\nArabian horses made up 3.9% of horses in the USDA census, but some data suggests the U.S. population of Arabians is larger. The AHA estimates over 400,000 registered purebred Arabians live in the United States. [4]\n\nMost modern breeds of riding horses carry influences from Arabian bloodlines. The Arabian Horse Association is the official breed registry for Arabian horses in North America.\n\n9. Standardbred\n\nThe Standardbred horse is an American harness racing breed. Standardbreds are classified as trotters or pacers, depending on the gait they use to race.\n\nThese horses are the fastest trotting breed in the world, but their talents aren’t limited to the racetrack. Like their Thoroughbred relatives, many Standardbred racehorses have successful second careers.\n\nAccording to the USDA, 3.7% of horses included in the 2015 census were Standardbreds. These horses are more common in the Northeast region. [4]\n\nThe U.S. Trotting Association is the regulatory body for North American harness racing and Standardbred registrations.\n\n10. Warmbloods\n\nWarmbloods include several breeds of sport horses primarily originating from Europe. Together, these horses comprise 3.2% of the equine population in the USDA census. [4]\n\nPopular warmblood breeds in North America include:\n\nOldenburg\n\nHanoverian\n\nDutch Warmblood\n\nHolsteiner\n\nSelle Francais\n\nAmerican Warmblood\n\nCanadian Warmblood\n\nMany warmblood registries have open studbooks and rigorous selection procedures for breeding stock. These horses are bred to compete at the top level of equestrian sport.\n\n11. Saddlebred\n\nThe American Saddlebred is a gaited horse breed with roots in Colonial America. Their elegant looks and high-stepping gaits make Saddlebreds popular show horses. These horses can perform ambling gaits called the slow gait and the rack.\n\nThese horses accounted for 2.5% of the horse population in the 2015 USDA report. [4]\n\nThe American Saddlebred Horse and Breeders Association maintains a registry of nearly 250,000 American Saddlebreds.\n\n12. Appaloosa\n\nThe Appaloosa is a popular American horse breed known for their distinct spotted colouring. They are versatile horses that stand out in many different disciplines.\n\nAppaloosas made up 1.9% of all included horses in the 2015 USDA census. [4]\n\nThe Appaloosa Horse Club is the official breed registry for Appaloosa horses in North America. All horses must meet colour and pedigree requirements for full registration as an Appaloosa.\n\n13. Morgan Horse\n\nThe Morgan horse is a versatile American breed popular with pleasure riders. Morgans are known for their dependability and willingness. Their sturdy builds and kind characters make these horses well-suited for many disciplines.\n\nThe 2015 USDA report found Morgan horses made up 1.4% of the studied equine population. [4] The Morgan horse is also the official state animal of Vermont.\n\nThe American Morgan Horse Association (AMHA) is the official breed registry for Morgans. The AMHA oversees a registry of approximately 90,000 living registered Morgans.\n\n14. Mustang\n\nThe Mustang is an iconic feral horse breed from the American West. Mustangs accounted for 1% of the U.S. horse population in the 2015 USDA census. [4]\n\nFree-roaming herds of Mustangs still inhabit public lands, but these equines aren’t truly wild. They descend from domesticated horses brought to the Americas by Spanish explorers. Mustang adoption programs help these horses transition to private homes. [9]\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management (BLM) monitors feral Mustang populations. The BLM estimates there are more than 82,000 wild horses and burros on public lands. [10]\n\nOther Breeds\n\nThe remaining 7.8% of the U.S. horse population reported on by the USDA included many other popular breeds, such as:\n\nPaso Fino\n\nFriesian\n\nGypsy Vanner\n\nMissouri Fox Trotter\n\nRocky Mountain Horse\n\nIcelandic Horse\n\nHaflingers\n\nAmerican Horse Breeds\n\nIn addition to the breeds mentioned above, there are several additional local American horse breeds with smaller population numbers. These breeds include:\n\nAmerican Bashkir Curly\n\nPony of the Americas\n\nAmerican Cream Draft\n\nAmerican Drum Horse\n\nChincoteague Pony\n\nCarolina Marsh Tacky\n\nColorado Ranger\n\nFlorida Cracker Horse\n\nNez Perce Horse\n\nNokota Horse\n\nRacking Horse\n\nSpotted Saddle Horse\n\nUSEF Breed Classes\n\nThe United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) recognizes 11 breeds that can compete in breed-specific classes at USEF-licensed shows:\n\nAndalusian/Lusitano\n\nArabian\n\nConnemara\n\nFriesian\n\nHackney\n\nMorgan\n\nNational Show Horse\n\nPaso Fino\n\nAmerican Saddlebred\n\nShetland\n\nWelsh Pony\n\nCanadian Horse Breeds\n\nThe Canadian horse population is significantly smaller than the U.S. population but shares similar demographics. [3] Canada is also home to several native horse breeds, some of which are endangered.\n\nLocal Canadian horse breeds include:\n\nCanadian Horse\n\nCanadian Warmblood\n\nNewfoundland Pony\n\nSable Island Horses\n\nCanadian Rustic Pony\n\nAlberta Wild Horse\n\nSummary"
