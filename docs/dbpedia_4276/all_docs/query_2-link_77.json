        "text": "Horse racing was never meant to be a team sport but there are definitely two clearly divided sides in the Melbourne Cup - last year's winner Makybe Diva and the strong international contingent.\n\nThe visitors are true heavyweights - the Dubai based champion trainer Saeed bin Suroor (Mamool and Razkalla), Ireland's famous global raider Dermot Weld (Vinnie Roe and Media Puzzle) and England's renowned racing knight, Sir Michael Stoute (Distinction).\n\nWeld's green light to start Vinnie Roe - a break in the weather - arrived on cue yesterday afternoon, and an unsettled day is forecast for the big occasion.\n\nHowever, local idol Makybe Diva has some pretty flash connections, too. In her win last year, she was prepared by David Hall, enjoying his first season as the latest expatriate trainer in Hong Kong. The mare is now under the care of Lee Freedman, who has trained three winners and three seconds in the great race, a sequence which started with the Tawrrific-Super Impose quinella in 1989.\n\nShe will be ridden by Glen Boss, Australia's most successful Group One jockey this year, who won on her in 2003 and also has a Melbourne Cup second to his credit, with Champagne in 1998.\n\nMakybe Diva has been the best backed runner with most bookmaking agencies in Australia and will almost certainly start favourite, despite a threatened betting plunge on Vinnie Roe. She looks the logical one to repel the invasion, if it can be repelled.\n\nThe international visitors have added a new dimension to the Cup since Weld and Vintage Crop showed exactly what was possible in 1993. Since then, 44 horses have been brought from international destinations to compete at Flemington on the first Tuesday in November but only one more - Weld's Media Puzzle in 2002 - was able to make it.\n\nStoute has added further spice to the mix with the Danehill horse Distinction, to be ridden by a two-time winning jockey in Darren Beadman.\n\nStoute is a four-time winner of the English Derby and trainer of such champions as Shergar, Pilsudski, Singspiel and his sire, In The Wings. This is his second Cup runner, following Hong Kong Vase hero Daliapour, a distant 16th two years ago.\n\nDistinction is a massive horse, standing at least 17 hands. He boasts successive wins in the Silver Cup and Troy Stakes, both Listed events in England. There was a thought to bringing Distinction for last year's Cup, but Stoute advised the owners to wait another year.\n\n'Sir Michael could not be happier with him now,' managing owner Harry Herbert said. However, Distinction's English form points clearly in one direction - a preference for firm tracks. So the pending rain will not be to everyone' taste. Then again, it never is."
