        "text": "Punters' favourites Frankie Dettori and Kieren Fallon both warmed up for their big weekends with popular winners at Goodwood yesterday.\n\nThe pair partner Dubai Destination and Russian Rhythm respectively in Saturday's feature Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot.\n\nAnd Dettori will then go on to Germany the following afternoon to ride Godolphin's Melbourne Cup hopeful Mamool in the Preis von Europa at Cologne.\n\nThe Italian kept up the winning momentum as he partnered the John Gosden-trained Tip The Dip to success in the Macphie Foodservice Classified Stakes.\n\nThe well-backed 7-4 favourite had to be asked plenty of questions to beat Wasted Talent, although he was clearly lacking in experience and should come on again for the run.\n\n\"He is a young horse, improving, and he did it well,\" said Dettori, who completed a double when Godolphin's Imtiyaz made all in the Bet attheraces Foundation Stakes.\n\nTrainer Saeed bin Suroor was delighted to see that colt return to winning ways.\n\n\"I was disappointed with him earlier this season,\" he said. \"But in the last few weeks he seems to have come back again and improved. I am really pleased.\n\n\"He will go for a Group Three race at Newmarket next month (the Darley Stakes) over a mile and a furlong.\n\n\"It is going to be a busy weekend with Dubai Destination, Mamool, Moon Ballad and Sulamani all set to run.\n\n\"I think I will be at Ascot to watch Dubai Destination rather than go to America (where Sulamani runs).\n\n\"It is a difficult choice but he (Dubai Destination) did a really good piece of work yesterday and I think he will run well.\"\n\nFallon, fresh from reaching a double century at Kempton 24 hours earlier, moved on to the 201-winner mark for the campaign as he scored on another winning favourite, 1-5 chance North Light.\n\nThe Sir Michael Stoute-trained son of Danehill, racing in the colours of the late Lord Weinstock, did all that was asked of him as he accounted for Take A Bow by a length and three-quarters.\n\n\"He did it very well and he is going to be a nice three-year-old,\" said Fallon.\n\n\"He is from a good family and hopefully he will develop into a really decent horse. He gives you the sort of feel that suggests he will do.\"\n\nFallon is relishing the chance to ride Russian Rhythm again on Saturday.\n\n\"She is in great form and although it will be her toughest test, I am really looking forward to the race,\" he said.\n\nRichard Hannon, busy eyeing up next year's winners at the sales in Ireland, took the training honours with a one-two in the Sharp Commercial Microwave Oven Auction Stakes as 9-4 chance Old Malt led home fellow market-leader Vienna's Boy.\n\nThe runner-up, who looked a shade unlucky to be beaten, will now be aimed at the Two Year Old Trophy at Redcar next month.\n\n\"The owners have promised me a Rolex if he wins it,\" beamed Hannon's representative Taffy Williams.\n\n\"That is six winners for the week - two by two each day. I hope we can keep it up.\""
