        "text": "At Nick Bradley Racing, we appreciate that it is often beneficial for a racehorse owner to have a racehorse located with a trainer which is convenient for themselves as well as the horse! We are fortunate to offer racehorses with a wide selection of premier racehorse trainers in the UK and Ireland.\n\nOur aim is to individually place our horses with a trainer most likely to unlock their true potential on the track!\n\nLearn more about each of our Nick Bradley Racing trainers below.\n\nTo find out about our Open Days click here\n\nKarl met wife Elaine Jarvis, daughter of trainer Alan at school and they later married and had two girls Kelly and Lucy. Karl trains from Spigot Lodge where his family play crucial roles in the team.\n\nAs a jockey Karl rode for Alan Jarvis but always likely to be too heavy for the Flat he switched codes to jump racing, and went on to gain 50 winners from 750 rides.\n\nAfter riding, Karl and Elaine set up a livery and pre-training yard in Newark where they broke young stock in. It was here they started training a small string of both flat and jump horses. The family then moved to Broadway near Cheltenham where they rented a yard, with much more space, from Michael Berrow the manager of pop group Duran Duran. As the string of horses increased Karl made the decision to move to Ginge in 1990 where he enjoyed further success with horses such as Philistar and Daring Destiny winner of the Ayr Gold Cup, a Group 2 in Germany and a Group 3 in Ireland.\n\nIn 2000 Karl and his family bought Spigot Lodge in idyllic North Yorkshire. Spigot Lodge is ideally situated between the famous Middleham High and Low moor gallops and is steeped in racing history. Karl has now trained here for several years and has enjoyed a number of Group successes, the most notable of which is the recently retired multiple Group 1 winning Laurens.\n\nNick and Karl have worked together since the 2016 season. Karl has had tremendous success for syndicates over the past few years and we are excited to be involved with the team at Spigot Lodge.\n\nRoger has been a racehorse owner and enthusiast for many years and has enjoyed a great deal of success as an owner. His favourite horse has to be Smarty Socks but there have been many others.\n\nThe yard was purchased by Roger Fell in 2008 with the vision of owning a successful racing yard and making racing fun and affordable for owners. Substantial investment has transformed the yard and it is now one of the best available anywhere. He took over the license himself in 2016 and with a team of dedicated staff and great facilities he has already shown that winners will continue to come from this quality yard.\n\nArthington Barn Stables is located just a few miles from Helmsley on the A170 Scarborough to Thirsk road in the village of Nawton. Set on the border of the North Yorkshire Moors it is the perfect location to train racehorses. The facilities provide a tranquil setting which gives all our racehorses the best chance to achieve their potential. The perfect recipe for a successful racing yard!\n\nRoger is very proud of the state-of-the-art facilities, and his dedicated staff work tirelessly to ensure that every horse is happy and relaxed. His private gallops mean the routine training can be done without stress and the need to box the horses and travel to the gallops. He can use other shared gallops whenever they are needed, so they enjoy the best of both worlds.\n\nThe yard is a proven success and provides a winning platform which has been demonstrated over many years. Over 400 winners have been sent out from Arthington Barn in recent years and we are confident that there are many more winners to come.\n\nWhen you have precious racehorses that need caring for, you want to choose a racing stables with a wealth of experience and deep knowledge of horses and racing.

You and your horse will receive the kind of care and attention that’ll make you feel like part of the family too.\n\nPark Lodge Stables has been established since the 19th century and is one of the oldest racing yards in Newmarket. It made a name for itself with renowned racehorse trainers Sir Jack Jarvis and Ron Sheather and continued to be a successful stables when James Eustace, Harry’s father, took over in 1989, a year after Harry was born.\n\nHarry grew up at Park Lodge, immersed in the excitement of a busy training stables. He went on to work at several prestigious establishments internationally, as well as with Royal Trainer to The Queen, William Haggas at Somerville Lodge Stables. He took over the family stables from his father in 2021.\n\nFrom the foundations of a long-established, family facility you and your horse will benefit from generations of Eustace training experience and racing knowledge. Your horse will be in safe hands because, as Harry says, “Horses are our life, not just a business – we’re just lucky that we are able to combine the two.”\n\nBased on the picturesque North Yorkshire moors, Trenholme House Farm has been home to over a hundred winners. With an exciting team of racehorses, a host of facilities including a private gallop, and a very driven trainer at the helm, 2023 looks set to be another successful season.\n\n​\n\nGemma Tutty brings a wealth of experience, having worked in the industry for well over a decade. She honed her interest in flat racing when taking out an apprentice jockey’s licence in 2012. Following stints with Saeed Bin Suroor in Dubai, Kevin Ryan, and her mother Karen when acting as Assistant Trainer, plus winning 75 races in the saddle.\n\n​\n\nIn her first season as a trainer she topped the yards previous best ever seasonal figure of 15 winners, by going one better with 16. Mostly Cloudy won 5 consecutive races, rising from a handicap mark of just 60, all the way up to 98 in the process, Shahnaz won 3 races rising from a mark of 59 to 73. A brace from Miss Britain and wins for Strawman, Freak Out, Fomo, Elixsoft, Vondelpark and Twin Appeal capped a great first season for Gemma.\n\n​\n\n2024 brings a whole host of new exciting horses and opportunities to the growing yard, in what will hopefully be a very successful season ahead.\n\nAndrew became the licensed racehorse trainer at Kingsclere in 2003, when he succeeded his father Ian. His training career got off to a perfect start when he saddled Casual Look to win the 2003 Epsom Oaks and since then the yard has gone from strength to strength, increasing in both size and quality.\n\nMany more domestic Group winners have followed from star performers such as Passing Glance, Tullius, Blond Me, Horseplay and Beat The Bank, whilst Group 1 wins have come courtesy of Elm Park in the Racing Post Trophy and Here Comes When in the Sussex Stakes, Donjuan Triumphant in the British Champions Sprint and Kameko in the Futurity Trophy. In 2020 Andrew achieved his second Classic success when Kameko won the Qipco 2,000 Guineas, whilst Alcohol Free capped off an excellent season with victory in the Group 1 Cheveley Park Stakes. Alcohol Free added two further Group 1 wins in 2021, taking the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. Andrew was leading trainer at the Qatar Goodwood Festival and runner-up trainer at Royal Ascot.\n\nAndrew finished second in the British Trainer’s Championship for 2021, his horses having amassed over £4.4m in UK prizemoney with a further £1.1m earned abroad.\n\nKevin Philippart de Foy, a Belgian native, has a wealth of racing experience, dating back as early as he can remember. Kevin’s mother, a jockey and trainer herself in France, immersed Kevin in to the world of racing from a young age, setting him on the path to a fantastic globe-trotting career with renowned racehorse trainers John Oxx in Ireland, the legendary Criquette Head in France, Christophe Clement in America and most recently James Fanshawe in Newmarket.\n\nHaving previously visited Newmarket previously, Kevin knew this was where he wanted to base his future, so in January 2016 he crossed the waters for the final time and became Assistant Trainer to James Fanshawe, a long established and well-respected part of the British racing scene. Based at Pegasus Stables for 5 seasons, Kevin has worked with James to produce multiple Group 1 winning horses SPEEDY BOARDING and THE TIN MAN, plus a full roster of listed race winners. ​\n\nWhilst working for James, Kevin developed a great understanding of the training requirements for horses racing in Great Britain and the race planning behind this. His career development with James and has lead to him now taking out his own training license and building his own yard based at the picturesque Machell Place in Newmarket.\n\nWith a background steeped in equestrianism, Alice is one of Newmarket’s new young ambitious racehorse trainers! Growing up Alice would be spending her time eventing and at Pony Club. She then delved into the racing industry aged only 15. Alice started at Henrietta Knights where she then went on to get her apprentice licence for Mick Channon before moving to HQ where she worked for David Simcock as an apprentice. Alice has ridden over 10 winners!\n\nAlice then started her Pre-Training career. Having a very successful pre training business for the likes of Varian Stable, William Haggas and Blue Diamond Stud, Alice decided she had completed this task and needed her next challenge. Alice decided to take out her training licence and is now based at the bottom of famous Warren Hill.\n\nHer ethos is small yard, big results. Each horse is individually trained for their individual needs, love and care goes into everything Alice does, and she tries to give all of her racehorse owners a service where they can be involved in their horse’s journey. She prides herself on good communication with owners and encourages them to come and see their horses as often as they like and feel part of the team!\n\nFrom his arrival in Newmarket in 2006, Marco Botti quickly established himself as one of Britain’s leading trainers. A reputation for fielding high-class challengers in the world’s biggest races led to Marco being voted international racehorse trainer of the year at the 2012 HWPA Derby Awards. He also boasts an admirable strike-rate with his runners at home, where he has been champion all-weather trainer.\n\nInternational Group and Grade 1 victories with Capla Temptress, Euro Charline, Excelebration, Tac De Boistron, Joshua Tree and Gitano Hernando have been backed up by a strong supporting cast which includes G2 Mill Reef Stakes winner Moohaajim, G2 Rockfel Stakes winner Al Thakhira, and G2 Gran Premio di Milano winner Dylan Mouth.\n\nMarco was bred to succeed in racing. His father Alduino has been champion trainer in Italy for more than 30 years, while Marco’s brother Stefano is also a leading trainer in Italy. In addition to learning at home with his family, Marco also spent time working for leading trainers Luca Cumani, Ed Dunlop and Saeed Bin Suroor before embarking on his own training career. Marco has now gone on to train over 500 winners and win more than £16 million in prize-money.\n\nMarco’s wife Lucie is a former jockey and a key member of the team, who accompanies many of the stable’s international runners on their travels. In early 2013, Marco and Lucie, along with their children Matteo and Valentina, moved into their brand new custom-built stable, Prestige Place, in order to accommodate their burgeoning string of racehorses.\n\nOllie has been training racehorses for over ten years, but has also experienced a number of areas of the racing industry. He was a professional jockey, with a total of 168 winners, both on the Flat and National Hunt. He gained a reputation for being a tough, powerful jockey as an apprentice and enjoyed considerable success as a professional.\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of his achievements in the saddle came at York in 1992 when he partnered Mr Confusion to success in the John Smiths Magnet Cup. Ollie remembers the day with great fondness, riding the gelding for Steve Norton.\n\nWhen his riding career came to a halt due to injury, Ollie set up a pre-training yard at the family farm, breaking youngstock and teaching the basics to an average of 70 horses a year for some of the country’s leading trainers. Realising that he missed being involved on a day to day basis, Ollie decided to pursue a career in training and sought out a trainer to teach him the craft.\n\nHe spent eighteen months with Howard Johnson, looking after the two-year olds (with some considerable success - the yard sent out hundreds of 2YO winners, all of which had gone through Ollie's hands), followed by periods with Dandy Nicholls, Jim Boyle in Epsom, and Michael Dickinson in Maryland, USA.\n\nOllie initially started Ollie Pears Racing from a mobile home on the site of a handful of rented stables, with a number of fairly moderate horses, which he placed with considerable skill to win a total of 33 races in 2008 and 2009, his first two seasons. In 2010, he was given the opportunity to buy The Old Farmhouse at Norton and consequently expanded the business to cope with demand, and to improve the quality of horses in training. He normally has 25-30 horses in training during the flat season.\n\nHe now has a tally of winners heading North of 160 and is aiming to beat his riding total soon, and hit the 200 mark before 2020. Ollie enjoyed success in the Musselburgh Gold Cup with My Arch, and No Leaf Clover was placed in Listed company.\n\nOllie and his wife Vicky are dedicated to their stables and the horses in their care, but outside racing Ollie is a keen road runner, and is a regular competitor in half marathons. Their young son Thomas is following in Ollie's footsteps and is sure to be riding ponies competitively before too long! Ollie has also ridden in the Doncaster 'Leger Legends' race for the last few years, personally helping to raise over £10,000 for the Injured Jockey's Fund.\n\nED DUNLOP was born to train, having grown up in a world - at Castle Stables in Arundel - where his father John masterminded the winning of ten British Classics. While horseracing is a great respecter of tradition, however, no son of a famous father will survive for long in the sport without being able to stand firm on his own two feet, so when Ed was thrown into the deep end by the tragic death of his boss Alex Scott in 1994, he had either to sink or swim.\n\nThe Eton-educated 25-year-old had learned some of his trade at studs in Ireland, Kentucky and Sydney, with extra tuition as assistant to top jumps trainer Nicky Henderson in Lambourn, but when he took over Sheikh Maktoum Al Maktoum’s Gainsborough Stables on Newmarket’s Hamilton Road, he entered a different arena entirely.\n\nBefore he turned 26, though, he had a winner to his name – Lynton Lad at Yarmouth on October 19, 1994 – and by the time he turned 28, he already had two Group 1s on the board, courtesy of Ta Rib in the Poule d’Essai des Pouliches at Longchamp and Iktamal in the Haydock Park Sprint Cup.\n\nAny doubts that Ed had the ‘right stuff’ were quickly blown away, as he racked up a series of big wins across national and continental divides, from Night Style in the Gran Criterium in Milan, to the prolific filly Lailani in the Flower Bowl International at Belmont Park, New York and Fraulein in the EP Taylor Stakes at Woodbine, Toronto.\n\nYes, Ed had begun life with many advantages, but it was his own talent that took him many rungs up racing’s ladder – and kept him there when the sad death of Sheikh Maktoum meant he finally had to leave Gainsborough and head across town - before the horse arrived that would change his life.\n\nLord Derby’s Ouija Board ended her two-year-old season as the winner of a modest Yarmouth novices’ event, but under the tutelage of Dunlop she finished her three-year-old campaign as a dual Oaks winner and heroine of the Breeders’ Cup Filly and Mare Turf at Lone Star Park in Texas. By the close of her glittering career, she had won seven Group and Grade 1 races, including a Hong Kong Vase, a Prince of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot and a second Breeders’ Cup, establishing her handler as one of the great international trainers of his generation.\n\nTo cement his reputation, however, Ed repeated the magic with his next great filly, Cristina Patino’s Snow Fairy, whose six wins at the highest level came as far apart as Surrey, Sha Tin, Kyoto and Dublin, with her two wins against all the odds in Japan’s Queen Elizabeth II Cup reflecting enormous credit on La Grange’s accomplished team of travelling staff.\n\nAs if all that weren’t enough, along came Red Cadeaux, the 55,000gns purchase whose wildly divergent, but carefully plotted, career paths have seen him beaten by a kangaroo’s whisker in the Melbourne Cup, runner-up in a Dubai World Cup, and getting his nose in front in the Hong Kong Vase in the back yard of his owner Ronnie Arculli – a victory that helped take his career earnings beyond £4 million.\n\nNo trainer can achieve as much as Ed Dunlop has achieved without a strong team of staff and a loyal band of owners behind him, but Ed continues to prove he has what it takes to make La Grange Stables the home of a new generation of success."
