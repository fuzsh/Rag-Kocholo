        "text": "North Light, the 7-2 joint favourite ridden by Kieren Fallon for trainer Michael Stoute, galloped to a one and a half length success in the Epsom Derby.\n\nIt was a remarkable classic double for the jockey and trainer who won the Derby a year ago on Kris Kin. Second place in the 14-strong field went to Rule of Law (20-1) with Let the Lion Roar (14-1) in third.\n\nThe result was a huge disappointment for Frankie Dettori who was riding the other 7-2 joint favourite Snow Ridge for the Godolphin stable but finished in mid-division.\n\nDettori has still to win the Derby after 12 unsuccessful attempts.\n\nBut it was a second classic victory in the space of 24 hours for Fallon who captured the Epsom Oaks yesterday on Ouija Board."
