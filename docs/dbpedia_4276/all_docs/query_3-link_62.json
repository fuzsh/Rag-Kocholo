        "text": "There surely won't be many horses receiving as much backing as Kitty's Light will garner at Aintree this weekend.\n\nThe Grand National, horse-racing's greatest prize, hasn't been won by a Welsh-trained horse since Kirkland in 1905, and should that change on Saturday, the significance of that victory will stretch well beyond mere record books.\n\nFor trainer Christian Williams and wife Charlotte, this is a horse that has helped them through arguably one of their darkest chapters.\n\nREAD MORE: Grand National 2024: The final 34 runners confirmed as favourite announced\n\nREAD MORE: Free Grand National 2024 sweepstake generator\n\nJust over a year ago, their then five-year-old daughter Betsy was diagnosed with leukaemia, and has been undergoing extensive treatment ever since.\n\nShe's made huge strides in her recovery, and hopes to finish chemotherapy next May. Despite the scale of the occasion this weekend, Betsy's battle has unsurprisingly put everything into perspective.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to being there with the family,\" Williams tells WalesOnline. \"I've not really thought about the race too much to be honest. I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. I'm just looking forward to Charlotte and the children being there. It's wonderful they're judging the best dressed on Ladies' Day, the two children. It'll be a special day, and there's great excitement for Friday really. I haven't really thought too much about Saturday, though.\"\n\nKitty's Light has already had huge success over the last year, claiming victories in the Scottish Grand National and the Bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown, and there's real hope he can make a mark on the most famous stage of all.\n\n\"He's in good form,\" Williams adds \"This seems to be his time of year and he showed everyone what he could do this time last year.\"\n\nThe emotions of the last 12 months has only heightened the sense of occasion, and arguably emphasises just how far the family have come on what's been a tough and daunting journey.\n\n\"The first six months were crippling really,\" Williams says looking back. \"They take them as close to death as they can without killing them. But it's tough.\n\n\"It's very important what Kitty did for our family over the last year.\n\n\"It's been very tough really,\" he admits. \"We've been in cruise control. We'll probably sit back in a few years and wonder how we got through it. But we're not the only ones in this situation. It obviously came as a shock finding out our daughter had cancer. Then we had to deal with it, but we're lucky we're involved in racing. With all the lows there's been some great highs as well, watching the horse.\"\n\nThose families going through similar experiences are among those to have thrown their backing behind the Ogmore-based horse, with plenty of support also coming from Noah's Ark hospital in Cardiff, where Betsy spent two months in her recovery.\n\n\"It just adds to it,\" he added. \"It's a big day for us. A big day for all the families in a similar situation that have been following us. There's been great excitement following the horse. Not just on Saturday, but over the last few weeks. It's just wonderful that the children and all the families in a similar situation, some of them might not have been involved in racing before, but have all latched on to Kitty's Light.\"\n\nWilliams himself comes from a rich sporting background. His uncle Gareth was a Great British and Irish Lion, while his uncle Owen played rugby for Wales. He was also at school with the a couple of other household names.\n\n\"Gavin Henson was in the year above me at school,\" he reveals. \"Nicole Cook [the cyclist] was in the same class.\n\n\"Henson was the year above me. Clearly very talented and a lovely man. We try to support his business as much as we can now. He's got a pub in the village.\n\n\"Every Welsh boy 20 or 30 years ago wanted to be a rugby player, but I could ride before I could walk really. I was brought up on a farm with my father. He always had riding horses.\"\n\nWilliams rode 400 winners during a 10-year career as a jockey before retiring aged 30. As a rider he never won the Grand National, and admits he's found it hard to imagine the prospect of winning horseracing's greatest prize this time around.\n\n\"It would be wonderful, but I don't want to get too greedy,\" he said. \"We're just very privileged to have such a wonderful horse. To have taken us on this journey has been just great. If he finishes in the first six what a wonderful day it will be. I just can't imagine what it will be like to win that race.\"\n\nIf Kitty's Light does pull it off, the biggest roars outside of Aintree will be in south Wales, at Chepstow racecourse.\n\nChepstow punters will enjoy their own Grand National Party Raceday on Saturday, with seven races over the jumps, alongside big screens around the course that will be showing all the action from Aintree.\n\nThe Grand National will be shown live at 4.00pm and if Kitty’s Light makes it a memorable day for Welsh sport, then the cheers at Chepstow might be heard all the way back up in Liverpool.\n\nPhil Bell, regional director at Arena Racing Company, said: “There has been so much support and goodwill towards Christian and his family over the past year, it would be so special if his horse now wins the Grand National.\n\n“It would cap a brilliant day’s racing at Chepstow on Saturday if we have Welsh racing fans enjoying live racing and then watching the challenge of Kitty’s Light for the Grand National on the big screens.”\n\nThe first of seven races at Chepstow will begin at 12.40pm with the last race taking place at 4.40pm after the Grand National winner is crowned.\n\nSpectators entering the racecourse after the gates open at 10.40 am will be offered a badge showing the colours of a horse/jockey taking part in the Grand National for entry into the free sweepstake.\n\nEach person with a badge will be in the chance to win a pair of tickets for any 2024 fixtures at Chepstow Racecourse along with a free £20 bet that can be redeemed on the DragonBet website."
