This filly has made 11 starts and had 1 win over 10.7F (£11493)\n\nFinsceal Rose is born and bred in Co Galway. She has mainly been living out which has produced a strong and healthy horse. She has been coping well with training.\n\nOwn race record\n\nFinsceal Rose herself has raced 8 times in 2019 with a second as the best result at Bellewstown (video showing highlights race number 6), trained by Gavin Patrick Cromwell. She was showing some fabulous spirit in this race having found her way from the outside track. She has due to the COVID 19 lockdown had some time off but is ready to return to training. We believe there is plenty left in the tank and the best is yet to come.\n\nHealth and future\n\nFinsceal Rose is in good health without any injuries, she is also open to any vetting. Apart from racing she could well have a future in ROR or eventing as her temperament is fabulous and she is well handled and trained throughout.\n\nLinks\n\nDisclosure\n\nRelated"
