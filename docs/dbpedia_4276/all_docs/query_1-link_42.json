        "text": "I didn’t pick them; they picked me. For that, I’m grateful.\n\nI grew up riding horses from the age of three. I began competing and training show horses throughout childhood, into my teens, and early adulthood.\n\nOn my journey to better understand horses and the retraining process, I shifted gears and found an opportunity at one of the best breaking and training programs for Thoroughbreds and relocated to Ocala, Florida.\n\nI had the honor of working under the D. Wayne Lukas program at Padua Stables, breaking and training Thoroughbreds. The knowledge I gained there allowed me to evolve my training skillset and further apply it to the off-the-track training program at the farm. After that experience,\n\nI then worked as an equine veterinary assistant for four and a half years, giving me another perspective on horses and their health.\n\nI opened my own business, Bella Inizio Farm, where I initially cared for broodmares, foals, weanlings, and yearlings before moving into rehabilitating Thoroughbreds to return to racing."
