        "text": "Runner-up in the Grade 2, $300,000 Black Eyed Susan Stakes at Pimlico this spring, Hoosier Philly, appears to be a strong possibility to run in the Grade 3, $200,000 Remington Park Oaks at Remington Park on Oklahoma Derby Day.\n\nThe Remington Park Oaks distance is 1-1/16 miles on the main track.\n\nHoosier Philly, a 3-year-old gray daughter of Into Mischief, out of the Tapit mare Tapella, led every step of the way in the Black Eyed Susan at Pimlico in Maryland, but was caught in the latter stages by Taxed. She is trained by Tom Amoss and owned by Gold Standard Racing Stable. She won the first three races of her career, including the $200,000 Rags To Riches Stakes and Grade 2, $400,000 Golden Rod Stakes, both at Churchill Downs. Her most recent stakes win came on June 17 in the $175,000 Monomoy Girl Stakes at one mile at Ellis Park in Kentucky. She won that won gate to wire by 3-1/2 lengths as the 6-5 second wagering favorite. Hoosier Philly was bred in Kentucky by Candy Meadows.\n\nHoosier Philly’s record is four wins from eight starts, one second and one third for earnings of $652,010. Only one other filly nominated for the Remington Park Oaks has banked more money and that is Defining Purpose, trained by Kenneth McPeek. She is a 3-year-old daughter of Cross Traffic, out of the Strong Hope mare Defining Hope, and her record stands at 10 starts, four wins and two thirds for earnings of $745,788. Her claim to fame so far has been victories in the Grade 3, $200,000 Indiana Oaks at Horseshoe Indianapolis and the Grade 1, $600,000 Ashland Oaks at Keeneland in Kentucky. She did run in the Grade 1 Kentucky Oaks, but finished a disappointing seventh. Defining Purpose is owned by Katsumi Yoshida and was bred in Kentucky by Colette Marie VanMatre.\n\nThe leading all-time horse racing conditioner in history, Steve Asmussen, has nominated Magic Bubbles, already a winner at this Remington Park meet. This daughter of Empire Maker, out of the North Light (IRE) mare Rigorously, would be racing in her first stakes race if she is entered. She is owned by Michael and Troy Langford and was bred in Kentucky by Michael Waresk. Her record is eight starts, two wins, two seconds and one third for $127,788.\n\nSabra Tuff, out of trainer Dallas Stewart’s barn, also is a possibility, owned by Valene Farms. She is well seasoned, having raced in eight stakes out of 10 total starts lifetime, but the filly has yet to win at that level. This daughter of Cross Traffic, out of the Cactus Ridge mare Cactus Cadillac, was at her best when she ran second in the $175,000 Debutante Stakes at Churchill Downs last year, followed by a third-place finish in the Grade 3, $200,000 Adirondack Stakes at Saratoga in upstate New York as a juvenile. She did make an appearance in the Grade 1, $2 million Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies last year and closed like a bullet from 13th to finish fourth. Sabra Tuff was bred in Louisiana by Tom Curtis and Wayne Simpson. Her record is 10 starts, one win, one place and one show for a bankroll of $261,970.\n\nThere were a total of 28 fillies nominated for the Remington Park Oaks scheduled for Sunday, Sept. 24.\n\nRemington Park racing continues Wednesday-Saturday, Sept. 13-16. The first post time is 7:07 p.m. CDT nightly.\n\nRemington Park has provided more than $328 Million to the State of Oklahoma general education fund since the opening of the casino in 2005. Located at the junction of Interstates 35 & 44, in the heart of the Oklahoma City Adventure District, Remington Park is home to the Grade 3 Oklahoma Derby and the Grade 3 Remington Park Oaks on Sunday, Sept. 24, 2023. Remington Park presents simulcast racing daily and non-stop casino gaming. Parking and admission are always free. Must be 18 or older to wager on horse racing or enter the casino gaming floor.
