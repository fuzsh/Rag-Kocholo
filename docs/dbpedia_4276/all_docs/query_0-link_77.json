        "text": "Kieren Fallon completed a memorable Vodafone Oaks-Vodafone Derby double when landing the Derby aboard the Danehill colt North Light in the colours of the Weinstock family’s Ballymacoll Stud.\n\n“He has a fabulous temperament, which is so important here, he has early speed and is a good stayer from a great family,” said Fallon.\n\n“It’s unbelievable to have done the double, I always liked Ouija Board and Michael had a couple that could have run in the Oaks but didn’t make it so it just worked out well. The atmosphere is just great here and it seems I’m lucky here - it’s the second time I’ve done the double.\n\n“I always thought this was going to be my Derby horse. I liked him from the first time I sat on him at Sandown and he was impressive in the Dante and he has improved since then. His temperament is his great asset.\n\n“He’s a big horse, but a lot of big horses handle this track well. Commander In Chief had the same sort of frame and action, so I was pretty sure he would handle the course.\n\n“You can hear nothing with the crowds and bands during the race but it’s fantastic, especially when you pull up and you’re still in front! You just hope nothing too bad has happened behind you.\n\nWinning trainer Sir Michael Stoute said: “He’s very composed and a fine athlete - both physically and mentally.The first time he ran at Sandown was a performance with a lot of promise then he just idled in front at Goodwood. We thought about going for the Dewhurst or Racing Post but he then wasn’t quite right. We had a messy spring this year with him with infections and minor things.\n\n“The Irish Derby is a strong likelihood now but we haven’t thought further than that. There’s been progress up until now and I hope there’ll be a lot more.\n\n“I’d like to thank the Weinstocks for keeping the operation going. Kieren and I are a good team and work well together.”\n\nPeter Reynolds, who has managed the Weinstock family’s Ballymacoll Stud for over a quarter of a century, said: “We have lovely families and our policy is to send the best to the best and hope for the best. Lord Weinstock and his son Simon were always very ruthless with what we kept and what we got rid of.\n\n“Lord Weinstock didn’t visit the stud in his last few years so never saw this horse. But he was very much hands on and took a tremendous interest in what was going on and liked to watch the pennies!\n\n“The mare has a beautiful Kalanisi gelding yearling and is in foal to Danehill Dancer. She raced until she was five and is now 14.\n\n“Lord Weinstock named North Light - as with everything he did he was very efficient and named them 24 hours after they were born.\n\n“Ballymacoll is owned by the executors of Lord Weinstock and the stud is run as a business that must make money - it’s not a charity.”\n\nLord Weinstock’s widow, Netta, collected the trophy and she was joined by her son Simon Weinstock’s widow Laura, who said: “I got engaged to Simon exactly 25 years ago today on the day Troy won the Derby. It’s a tribute to Simon and his father Arnold that we are still in racing with a fantastic combination of Michael, Kieren and Peter at the stud.”\n\nWinning trainer Sir Michael Stoute denied any claims to being “a genius” but described North Light as “a lovely horse and a lovely horse to train, and the real credit has to go to the stud Ballymacoll.\n\n“ For a stud like that with just 25 mares, though they may have had as many as 35 when North Light was foaled, to have bred two horses to have started joint favourites for the Derby and for one of them to have won is quite remarkable and it is all credit to them. .\n\n“This was only the fourth run of his life and we shall have to think about what we do with him in the future, but I would think that it is pretty likely that we shall go for the Irish Derby with him.”\n\nKieren Fallon and Sir Michael Stoute both made history today with North Light’s victory in the Vodafone Derby.\n\nFallon, who also rode yesterday’s Vodafone Oaks winner Ouija Board, follows in the footsteps of Michael Kinane who won both races on Imagine and Galileo in 2001 . Fallon was also winning the Vodafone Derby for the second year in succession following Kris Kin’s victory last year. Fallon is now the most successful current jockey in the premier classic with three successes - Oath (1999), Kris Kin (2003) and North Light (2004).\n\nTrainer Sir Michael Stoute joins Henry Cecil as the most successful current trainer in the Vodafone Derby with four success - Shergar (1981), Shahrastani (1986), Kris Kin (2003) and North Light (2004). The master of Freemason Lodge was also winning the Vodafone Derby for the second year in succession following Kris Kin 12 months ago.\n\nLadbrokes spokesman Balthazar Fabricius said: 'The Epsom Derby 2004 was a satisfactory result for bookmakers despite Fallon and Soute teaming up again with North Light.'\n\n'Turnover was up 10% on last year. Due to all the each-way money on horses at bigger prices, for once a Fallon Derby win has not wiped us out.'\n\n'North Light is quoted as 5/2 favourite to win the King George VI at Ascot.”\n\nAlthough the precise crowd figure was still being calculated, the police estimated an attendance of around 100,000 at the 2004 Vodafone Derby.\n\nStephen Wallis, Managing Director at Epsom Downs Racecourse, said: “It’s been a great fun day and we’ve seen a fantastic, class horse in North Light win a great race in front of a huge crowd who really enjoyed themselves.\n\n“I don’t ever recall such a great atmosphere and noise from the crowd, not just for the Vodafone Derby but for all the other races as well.”\n\nTHE 2004 VODAFONE DERBY\n\nGroup One, £1,386,410 Total Prize Fund.
