        "text": "My idea to collect photographs of the progeny of Northern Dancer, our King of Thoroughbred Racing here in Canada, led to the discovery of just how influential this tiny thoroughbred stallion really was — and continues to be today, particularly in Great Britain, Ireland, Europe and Australia.\n\nIt was the last Kentucky Derby my ailing grandfather and I watched together. He sat, wrapped in blankets, in his favourite armchair and I sat cross-legged near him on the carpet, the rest of the family ranged in chairs around the black and white television console. When the little colt hit the wire, the room erupted with gasps, followed by delight. Here he was, the very first Canadian bred and owned 3 year-old to win the Kentucky Derby and he had done it in record-breaking time.\n\nAs we watched EP Taylor leading his fractious champion into the winner’s circle at Churchill Downs, my grandfather exclaimed, “Well I never……just look at him ….he’s only a pony!”\n\nI had been born with Grandpa’s “horse gene,” as my mother liked to say. Shortly after the Derby win, I bought a copy of Sports Illustrated magazine, carefully removed a photo of “The Dancer” winning the Florida Derby and glued it onto a sturdy sheet of blue cardboard, under which I wrote: ” ‘He’s all blood and guts and he tries hard.’ Northern Dancer: first Canadian owned-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby. Time: 2:00:00 flat.”\n\nThe photo and the memory stuck. Today, as I write this, the faded blue cardboard with The Dancer’s photo and my round printing sits in a frame just above the computer.\n\nPunctuated as he was by the love of a grandfather who was gone only a year later, as well as that festering horse gene of mine, it was predictable that by 1990 I had decided to collect original press photos of Northern Dancer and some of his progeny. What I had in mind was a project: to collect some photos and then mount them in an album, together with a little research on The Dancer’s most prominent progeny.\n\nI started out in earnest, shopping on places like the newly-opened EBAY. But little did I know what I was going to uncover. The search for original photos of Nijinsky and The Minstrel connected me to a number of UK sellers — and it was here that the proverbial “floodgates” flew open. My career and family had necessitated a lengthy sabbatical from all things thoroughbred, leaving me somewhat amazed to discover that through the aegis of the great trainer and horseman, Vincent O’Brien, Canada’s tiny Dancer had, in fact, gone viral.\n\nI had bought a few albums to house the photos and had started mounting them together with text. But as the sheer number of photos mounted, I could see that I was making myself a project that would take a lifetime to complete. It wasn’t that I had no criteria for acquiring a photo…..it was that truly great thoroughbreds kept coming and coming, like an enormous tidal wave, prompting the question: Where do I draw the line?\n\nThink about it. Out of the “Danzig connection” alone, another galaxy of superstars in England, Ireland, Europe and Australia have emerged. And this is only one of many Northern Dancer sire lines.\n\nAmong the remarkable thoroughbreds who descend from a bewildering galaxy of Northern Dancer sire lines and families, and who have recently retired are the champions: Rachel Alexandra (USA), America’s sweetheart and 2009 Horse of the Year, is a daughter of Medaglia d’Oro and granddaughter of Sadler’s Wells; Black Caviar (AUS) whose sire, Bel Esprit, is the grandson of Nijinsky and whose dam, Helsinge, is the granddaughter of the late Green Desert (by Danzig); the incomparable Frankel (GB) a son of Galileo (by Sadler’s Wells) whose dam, the Blue Hen, Kind, is a daughter of Danehill (by Danzig); America’s two-time Horse of the Year and turf star, Wise Dan (USA), who carries Storm Bird (by Northern Dancer) and Lyphard (by Northern Dancer) on both sides of his 4th generation pedigree; the 2014 and 2013 Investec Derby winners Australia (IRE) by Galileo and Camelot (IRE) by Montjeu; Arc winner Danedream (GER), whose sire Lomitas is a grandson of Nijinsky and whose dam, Danedrop, is a daughter of Danehill (by Danzig); the brilliant Nathaniel (IRE), a son of Galileo and only one of two horses to seriously challenge Frankel, the other being Zoffany (IRE) by Dansili, a son of Danehill and grandson of Danzig; the mighty Igugu (IRE), winner of the SA Triple Tiara and a daughter of Galileo; the immortal Hurricane Fly (IRE) whose sire Montjeu is a son of Sadler’s Wells; the undefeated Arc winner Zarkava (IRE) whose sire, Zamindar, is a grandson of The Minstrel and whose dam, Zarkasha, is by the superb Kahyasi, a grandson of Nijinsky; the ill-fated and brilliant St. Nicholas Abbey (IRE) a son of Montjeu; the Australian champion All Too Hard (AUS), the half-brother of Black Caviar, and a grandson of Danehill (by Danzig); the wonderful mare, The Fugue (IRE), a daughter of Dansili (by Danehill) whose dam, Twyla Tharp, is by Sadler’s Wells; Canada’s Inglorious, winner of the 2011 Queen’s Plate, who is a granddaughter of Storm Bird (by Northern Dancer); and last but hardly least, Goldikova (IRE) whose sire, Anabaa is a son of Danzig and whose dam, Born Gold, is a granddaughter of Lyphard (by Northern Dancer).\n\nIt’s impossible to think of thoroughbred racing or the National Hunt without these individuals — but even they are the tip of the proverbial iceberg in the ongoing genetic dance of The Dancer.\n\nBelow, a video of the American turf superstar, Wise Dan, winning the 2013 Breeders Cup Mile for the second straight year:\n\n“The bird has flown” — the fabulous Nathaniel winning the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot:\n\nThe “sensational” Canadian filly,Inglorious, winning the 2011 Queen’s Plate at Woodbine, Toronto, Canada:\n\nStallions — so many names that one gets dizzy just trying to keep them in a kind of chronological order. Among the best-known: Giant’s Causeway, Medaglia d’Oro, Elusive Quality, Animal Kingdon, Big Brown and War Front in the USA; Galileo, Sea The Stars, Yeats, Invincible Spirit, Cape Cross (sire of Sea The Stars, Ouija Board and Golden Horn), New Approach, Oasis Dream, Kingman, Mastercraftsman, Dansili and Dubawi in Great Britain, Ireland and Europe; So You Think, Exceed and Excel, Sepoy, Redoute’s Choice, Fastnet Rock, More Than Ready, Bel Esprit and Snitzel in Australia; and in Japan, the great Empire Maker and leading sires by earnings, Deep Impact and King Kamehameha ( a son of Kingmambo who is inbred 2 X 4 to Northern Dancer through his sons, Nureyev and Lyphard, and carries Nijinsky’s son, Green Dancer, in his 4th generation).\n\nA look back at the late Bart Cummings’ great champion, So You Think:\n\nAnd in 2015?\n\nWell, let’s see.\n\nThere’s America’s first Triple Crown winner in 37 years, American Pharoah (whose brilliance, I will continue to insist, owes at least as much to Empire Maker and his Blue Hen dam, Toussaud, a daughter of Northern Dancer’s El Gran Señor as to any other in his pedigree), the Investec Derby winner Golden Horn, Shadwell’s brilliant Muhaarar, Coolmore’s Gleneagles, the up-and-coming sire, Mastercraftman’s The Grey Gatsby and Amazing Maria in Great Britain. And it’s impossible to overlook the incomparable Treve, who now has her own theme song!\n\nThis year, they all look like him, carrying his bay coat and dark mane and tail into a future he never saw. But the familiar colours of my “tiny Dancer” always take me back to that last Kentucky Derby my grandfather and I watched together. And as for my collection of photographs, it’s tailed off considerably since it arrived at 500 + images. I’m well behind in recording them all, so the considerable overflow are now housed in an archival file.\n\nBut then along came 2015.\n\nAnd I can see that my collecting is not yet done…….\n\n*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\n\nUPDATE\n\nSince I began THE VAULT’S rescue fund, $1,542.00 CAD has been raised, allowing THE VAULT readers and yours truly to rescue Hale, as well as a Standardbred gelding and a beautiful blue roan QH mare, in foal, from slaughter.

And it’s inconvenient in the 21st century, when our concept of time is so different, thanks to things like the social media. In a world where Twitter pumps out race results one second (literally) after the horses cross the finish line, the prospect of waiting thirty years to get another Frankel or thirty-seven years to get the next American Triple Crown winner isn’t all that appealing.\n\nBut another way of looking at this is to realize that any thoroughbred is a work much like the tapestry of Storm Cat and owner-breeder William T. Young that hangs in the University of Kentucky library in Lexington, Kentucky. A thoroughbred is textured of many threads — and many life stories — coming down to us through time.\n\nIf we appreciated this, we could reform how we manage the Earth and all of her creatures. And, as though to encourage us, Storm Cat’s “thread” hovered over the 2015 Triple Crown and, across the Atlantic in England, over the pomp of Royal Ascot 2015.\n\nWilliam T. Young’s great stallion died in 2013, at the age of 30, leaving in his slipstream a gallery of champion colts and fillies, and stallions whose progeny continue to contribute to Storm Cat’s legacy — and to the survival of the Bold Ruler line. During his active years as a stallion, Storm Cat sired a bevy of runners who excelled as two year-olds and favoured a distance of 7f. Among his best were Kentucky Oaks winner Sardula, Harlan (sire of the excellent stallion Harlan’s Holiday), Hennessy (sire of the brilliant Johannesburg), the champion After Market (now standing in Turkey), 2005 Sovereign Award Winner Ambitious Cat, the leading miler and Coolmore champion, Black Minnaloushe and millionaire Bluegrass Cat, the dam of champion Sky Mesa, himself a successful sire.\n\nOther excellent prodigy include Caress, BC Classic winner Cat Thief, champions Catinca and Sweet Catomine, Desert Stormer, Courageous Cat, Good Reward, Coolmore’s Hold That Tiger, BC Distaff winner, Mountain Cat, Juddmonte’s Nebraska Tornado, Newfoundland, One Cool Cat, millionaire Raging Fever, Japanese multimillionaire, Seeking The Dia, the fabulous filly, Sharp Cat, BC Juvenile Fillies & Eclipse award winner, Stormflagflying, Vision and Verse, champion Tabasco Cat and the 2009 BC Distaff winner, Life Is Sweet (below,winning the BC Distaff in 2009 for owner M. Wygood and trainer, John Shirreffs).\n\nStorm Cat’s record of great thoroughbreds of both sexes was absolutely stunning during his lifetime. Arguably the best of all his progeny was Ireland’s Giant’s Causeway, “The Iron Horse,” who gave Storm Cat a classic runner, one of the few he produced during his stud career. As a sire, Giant’s Causeway is well on his way to becoming a sire of sires, notably through sons like Shamardal and Footstepsinthesand. Other European runners of classic lines include the aforementioned filly, November Snow, and Black Minnaloushe.\n\nAs a BM sire, Storm Cat was equally successful. In 2012, a year before his death, Storm Cat was responsible for, among others: Japan’s King Kanaloa (King Kamehameha ex. Lady Blossom) and Shonan Mighty (Manhattan Cafe ex. Luxury); Arkansas Derby winner and millionaire, Bodemeister (Empire Maker ex. Untouched Talent); champion Love And Pride (A.P. Indy ex. Ile de France); champion In Lingerie (Empire Maker ex. Cat Chat); Grade 2 winner City To City (City Zip ex. Stormbow) and Noble Tune, winner of $321,000 USD (Unbridled’s Song ex. Serena’s Cat). Of course, Storm Cat’s contribution to thoroughbred bloodlines as a BM sire was not confined to his 2014 record. His appearance in the first 5 generations of some exceptional individuals in their tail female bespeaks a lasting influence on the breed, both in North America and the United Kingdom, with a smattering (for the moment) in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nA dark bay, Storm Cat was bred in the purple: his sire was Storm Bird, a champion juvenile and son of Northern Dancer and the New Providence (Bull Page) mare, South Ocean. His dam was Terlingua, a champion filly and daughter of the 1973 American Triple Crown winner, Secretariat. In the minds of those who knew Storm Cat’s female family best, like trainer D. Wayne Lukas, he was his mother’s son through and through, as were many of his offspring. According to Lukas, an American Hall of Fame trainer, the Storm Cats “… walk like her, they look like her and they have her attitude…the influence of the {dam} there was very strong.”\n\nAnd this led, in turn, to analysts making the connection between Terlingua’s precocity as a two year-old, together with her sprinter-type profile (Crimson Saint, Terlingua’s dam, was a champion speedster) and Storm Cat progeny, many of whom fell into this performance category. The time was ripe for thoroughbreds with a speed bias — and the market loved it.\n\nBut Storm Cat’s sire, Storm Bird, had been a stellar two year-old himself and would likely have continued into his three year-old season had it not been for a series of unfortunate events, one of which had an absolutely devastating effect on the colt’s state-of-mind. In the late winter months of 1981 a disgruntled (Vincent) O’Brien employee broke into the gentle Storm Bird’s stall and hacked off his mane and tail before being apprehended. Ballydoyle, who had Storm Bird insured for 15 million (USD) was understandably quiet about the attack, saying only that there were no career-ending injuries. But Storm Bird, known for his sweetness and his kind eye around the stable, was never quite the same again. Hampered by physical injuries, he was retired to stand at Ashford Stud, then owned by Dr. William Lockridge and Robert Hefner. Ironically, it was Lockridge who bred Crimson Saint, the dam of Terlingua and grandam of Storm Cat, and it was Lockridge’s relationship with William T. Young, Sr., with whom he owned Terlingua in partnership, that led to her being sent to Storm Bird. (When bankruptcy plagued Lockride, Young bought a group of mares from him, including Terlingua and another Secretariat mare, Cinegita, who was bred to Storm Bird to produce Starlet Storm, the dam of champion Flanders. Shortly thereafter, Ashford was acquired by John Magnier and company as part of a settlement Lockridge and Hefner made to cover their outstanding debt on the purchase of Storm Bird.)\n\nThe Storm Bird influence is one that had the potential to mitigate against Storm Cat producing only short distance runners. And that potential might well be exerting itself from two or three generations back, in the pedigree of contemporary thoroughbred champions who happily get at least a mile over the dirt or turf.\n\nBelow is footage of the two year-old Storm Bird winning the Dewhurst Stakes from To-Agori-Mou and Miswaki, two colts who were champions of the turf.. His performance set the press buzzing, and Storm Bird was a prohibitive Epsom Derby favourite well before his anticipated debut as a three year-old:\n\nSo it comes as little surprise that, through sons and daughters and their progeny, the lasting influence of Storm Cat was profoundly felt over three weeks in June of this year, when America received her much-anticipated Triple Crown winner, American Pharoah, and Royal Ascot saw brilliant performances by a number of outstanding colts and fillies. And even though Storm Cat represents only a thread in the pedigree weave of these champions, none would have come into being without him. Their collective performances further attest to this amazing stallion’s resiliency and to his rightful place in thoroughbred racing history.\n\nAmerican Pharoah, a son of Pioneerof the Nile by Empire Maker out of the mare Littleprincessemma, a daughter of Yankee Gentleman by Storm Cat, gave North America the racing highlight of the year when he swept to the finish line in the Belmont Stakes to become America’s twelfth Triple Crown winner — after a wait of 37 years.\n\nAs though this wasn’t enough, Storm Cat’s name was as prominent as Galileo’s in the pedigrees of several of the most stunning winners at Royal Ascot this year. In addition, Storm Cat mares have proved a very good match with Galileo, as seen in two of the colts below, Gleneagles and Aloft, as well as the filly Ballydoyle, who ran a blinder against Suits For You in the Chesam Stakes. Too, previous good performers like Misty For Me have Storm Cat as their BM sire. The Galileo-Storm Cat nick has been particularly lucrative for Coolmore, attesting to the fact that Storm Cat can get excellent turf runners too.\n\nStorm Cats at Royal Ascot 2015 put in some sterling performances:\n\nTUESDAY, June 16\n\nGleneagles, the stunning winner of the St. James Palace Stakes who broke the mighty Frankel’s existing track record, is by Galileo out of You’resothrilling, a Storm Cat daughter, and full sister to Giant’s Causeway:\n\nWEDNESDAY, June 17\n\nCoolmore’s Acapulco, a 2 year-old filly brilliantly trained by Wesley Ward, won the G2 Queen Mary Stakes. She is a daughter of Scat Daddy (Johannesburg), placing Storm Cat in her 4th generation:\n\nIn the next race that day, Amazing Maria, ridden by James Doyle and taking on champions Integral and Rizeena, won the Duke of Cambridge Stakes convincingly. The pedigree of the 4 year-old daughter of Mastercraftsman features Tale of the Cat, a son of Storm Cat, as her BM sire:\n\nTHURSDAY, June 18\n\nOn Thursday, it was 3 year-old War Envoy, whose dam is a granddaughter of Storm Cat, who took the Britannia Stakes.\n\nFRIDAY, June 19\n\nStorm Cat kicked off more trips to the winner’s circle with Balios in the King Edward VII (G2). Balios is a son of Shamardal by Giant’s Causeway and Storm Cat appears in his sire line in the 3rd generation.\n\nAloft, a Galileo colt out of Dietrich, by Storm Cat, wins the Queen’s Vase and gives Ryan Moore, aka “Magic Moore,” a 9th win that confirms him as the winningest jockey ever at a Royal Ascot meet.\n\nSATURDAY, June 20\n\nCrack 2 year-old filly Ballydoyle didn’t win the Chesham Stakes but she came close enough that the stewards’ needed to take a long, hard look at the footage of the race. A daughter of Galileo, the young Ballydoyle’s BM sire is Storm Cat. Bumped badly near the finish and running against colts, she still got up to make all, narrowly missing the win by a short nose.\n\nThis is one article that doesn’t require an epilogue, because Storm Cat’s story isn’t done.\n\nWe can look forward to more threads in more pedigrees as time goes on.\n\nBecause that’s how great thoroughbreds are made.\n\nBONUS FEATURES\n\n1) Two year-old Storm Cat goes up against some other very good colts to win the 1985 Young America Stakes:\n\n2) Storm Cat’s son, the incomparable Giant’s Causeway (running on dirt for the first time under Mick Kinane/#14), makes a courageous run at Tiznow in the BC Classic — and just misses by a nose:\n\n3) Short documentary on Terlingua, with cameos of Storm Cat:\n\n4) TOO CUTE! Trainer John Shirreffs tries to wake up Storm Cat’s daughter, Life Is Sweet, to “go to work”:\n\n5) Multimillionaire Seeking the Dia (Japan):\n\nNOTE: THE VAULT is a non-profit website.

An exciting twist for American racing fans is provided by the entry of Rosalind, trained by Kenny McPeek, in either the Ribblesdale Stakes on June 19 or the Coronation Stakes on Friday, June 20. In addition, Verrazano, now in training with Aidan O’Brien, will be starting in either the Queen Anne (June 17) or the Prince of Wales (June 18) Stakes.\n\nImpossible as it is to focus on every horse entered at Royal Ascot, there are several who have become familiar names to racing fans worldwide. Keeping our readership and their needs in mind, we have focused on a few of the star-studded cast who will assemble at Royal Ascot next week. At the time of this writing, the fields were still not quite set and since several of the entries described below remain co-entered in two different races, readers are encouraged to go to the Racing Post site for Royal Ascot to check the racing cards early next week: http://royal-ascot.racingpost.com/horses/cards/\n\nTREVE\n\nArc winner, Treve, is set to kick off in the Prince of Wales Stakes on Wednesday, June 18 in what will be her first start on British soil. Last seen in neck-to-neck combat with the outstanding Cirrus des Aigles in April at Longchamps in the Prix Ganay (below), which Treve lost by a whisker in her first-ever defeat, trainer Cricket Head-Maarek’s champion seems ready to add another jewel to her crown next week.\n\nAs satisfying as it will be for Head-Maarek to see her great mare return to the winner’s circle at Ascot, the Prince of Wales is thought to be a prep race for Treve who’s real objective is likely to be the 1 million purse in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot in July, where it is very possible that she will meet up with Derby winner, Australia. From there, if all goes well, Treve will defend her title in the 2015 Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe. If anyone can get her through this arduous campaign it is Head-Maarek, a trainer of no small merit who hails from the family of Freddie Head, trainer of the brilliant Goldikova. Here is Treve in-training prior to the Prix Ganay, with commentary from the distinguished jockey, Frankie Dettori, who has ridden some of the greatest thoroughbreds of the last twenty years.\n\nThe Prince of Wales is shaping up to be a solid race including Aidan O’Brien’s 2013 Epsom Derby winner, Ruler of the World, John Gosden’s globetrotting mare, The Fugue, the William Haggas-trained Mukhadram, second in last year’s Dubai World Cup, and Dank, trained by Sir Michael Stoute, last seen by North America in her record-setting run in the Breeders Cup Filly and Mare Turf in November 2013 (below). (NOTE: Ruler of the World is co-entered in the Hardwicke Stakes, Saturday, June 21st. Check on Monday, June 16 to see where he is going.)\n\nOf particular interest to American racing fans will be the entry of Verrazano, last year’s winner of the Wood Memorial, who is now being trained by Aidan O’Brien. O’Brien reports that he is pleased with Verrazano’s progress to date. The 4 year-old made his first start for O’Brien at Newberry in May, where he finished a very respectable third to champion Olympic Glory in the JLT Lockinge Stakes (below). (NOTE: Verrazano is co-entered in the Queen Anne Stakes which will run on Tuesday, June 17. Verrazano fans should check at on the weekend or Monday, June 16 when the entries should be finalized for June 17.)\n\nSOFT FALLING RAIN & OLYMPIC GLORY\n\nMike de Kock’s Soft Falling Rain is getting set to take on Olympic Glory in the Queen Anne Stakes, on the first day of racing (June 17th) at Royal Ascot. The last time he tried this on Ascot turf, Soft Falling Rain ran the worst race of his distinguished career, coming in 11th behind the winner (Olympic Glory). But don’t be fooled: Mike de Kock’s champion has only ever finished out of the money twice in his 12 starts, winning 8. A son of Canada’s National Assembly, a champion sire in South Africa who was trained by Vincent O’Brien but never raced due to injury, Soft Falling Rain is a grandson of the prepotent Danzig and Giant’s Causeway is his BM sire. So this 5 year-old is “bred in the purple” and always gives his best. His last start was in March in the Godolphin Mile, where he narrowly lost out to stablemate Variety Club:\n\nOlympic Glory (shown in video above in connection with Verrazano) is another champion who has won very consistently over 13 career starts for trainer, Richard Hannon. A son of Choisir, the first Australian-trained horse to win at Royal Ascot (2003) who became almost as famous for his weird headgear, Olympic Glory carries “the Danehill gene” that never seems to disappoint. Accordingly, the colt has won seven times in France and England, and was seen last year at Royal Ascot winning the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes (below). Despite coming in 4th at Longchamps to the mighty Cirrus des Aigles, expect Olympic Glory to be well in the mix on opening day.\n\nESTIMATE\n\nPerhaps the most heartwarming moment of last year’s Royal Ascot was the delight of HM The Queen as she greeted her filly, Estimate, in the winner’s enclosure after the Gold Cup.\n\nEstimate was the product of an arrangement involving her dam, Ebaziya, owned by the Aga Khan Studs and HM’s Royal Stud. The latter sent Ebaziya to the super German stallion, Monsun (sire of Novellist, Shirocco and Stacelita, among others) and the result was a beautiful mare who has done her 88 year-old owner-breeder proud. Although lightly raced, the 5 year-old has won 4 of her 8 starts. Given HM’s passion for thoroughbred racing, it would be a thrill to see Estimate defend her title with another win in the 2m 4f Gold Cup on June 19. But she will have to be at her absolute best to vanquish her competition.\n\nIt’s a fair guess that Aidan O’Brien’s Leading Light will push Estimate to the limit if he can get the distance. Successful at Navan in May, the son of Montjeu has only lost twice in 8 starts. Out of the Gone West mare, Dance Parade, Leading Light was the brilliant winner of the St. Leger last year as a 3 year-old, and at Royal Ascot 2013 showed true grit in winning the Queen’s Vase.\n\nA sentimental favourite is the hardy Simenon, whose problem won’t be the distance. Rather, it will be his age. At seven, with 38 starts under his belt, Simenon may be getting past his best but he’s one of the most honest horses in the race. Too, there is Richard Baldwin’s Whiplash Willie, who ran a very decent third at Sandown last time out to the favourite, Brown Panther.\n\nCERTIFY\n\nCertify was brilliant as a juvenile at 2 and as a 3 year-old, but her career was cut in half by the drug scandal that beset Godolphin’s trainer, Mahmood Al Zarooni in 2013. Certify returned in 2014 where she won her first race, followed by a fourth at Meydan in what was her first ever defeat. Her story is a heart-breaker because the daughter of Elusive Quality is Frankel-esque in her abilities and bringing her back to form after an enforced break of 469 days is a challenge of epic proportions. Switched to trainer Charlie Appleby, Certify is listed to run against fillies and mares in the Duke of Cambridge Stakes on Wednesday, June 18. One can only hope to see her regain the brilliance of her 2012 season. Either way, she is a superstar gracing the turf of champions. Here is Certify winning the Shadwell Fillies Mile in 2012, followed by her win in the Cape Verdi at Meydan in January 2014:\n\nBROWN PANTHER\n\nAnother serious contender for the Gold Cup will be Ted Dascombe’s Brown Panther, a son of Shirocco and grandson of Monsun. As of this writing, Brown Panther has won his last two races decisively and with 20 starts and 9 wins under his belt, appears to be peaking at just the right moment. The Dascombe-trained 6 year-old is currently listed as the favourite going in to Royal Ascot week, given that his last win came at the Gold Cup distance over a soggy track at Sandown. Although it has taken him some time to get there, Brown Panther deserves the attention he’s getting.\n\nBred by his owner, Michael Owen, a British and international soccer (football in the UK) star who now does football commentary for the British media, Brown Panther represents the zenith of his owner’s career in horse racing. And he’s come along very nicely under Ted Dascombe’s patient tutelage, since his male family have a tendency to come into their own rather slowly by today’s standards and Dascombe understands this.\n\nAs footage of his most recent win at Sandown was not available, here is Brown Panther (turquoise shirt) winning the Artemis Goodwood Cup at Glorious Goodwood a year ago, where he beat the likes of Colour Vision soundly. By all accounts, he’s an even better distance runner this year.\n\nROSALIND\n\nAmerica’s Rosalind will have her work cut out for her, making her first start on grass at Royal Ascot in either the Ribblesdale (June 19) or the Coronation Stakes (June 20). Either way, she will be in heady company, including a contingent from Ballydoyle that includes Wonderfully, John Gosden’s Criteria, Roger Varian’s excellent Sea The Stars filly, Anipa, Godolphin’s Ihtimal, John Oxx’s talented filly My Titania (another by Sea The Stars), Andre Fabre’s Miss France, together with lightly-raced fillies like Wonderstruck, Dermot Weld’s Edelmira or William Haggas’ Cape Cross filly, Token of Love.\n\nStill, Rosalind will have a huge fan following from America, where she is a favourite and they will be rooting for her all the way. The daughter of Broken Vow whose BM sire is Theatrical has several excellent grass runners in her pedigree, including Britain’s last Triple Crown winner, Nijinsky II, as well as Sassafras and Nureyev, who was born and raced in France where he got Champion 3 year-old honours. Her owners, Landaluce Educe Stables and trainer, Kenny McPeek have little reason to doubt either her quality or her determination. Having only finished out of the money twice in 8 starts, Rosalind is shown here in a gutsy win over Room Service in April at Keeneland:\n\nWAR COMMAND, KINGMAN & NIGHT OF THUNDER\n\nIt would be fair to say that next to the emotion of HM’s Estimate taking the Gold Cup, last year’s Royal Ascot was punctuated by the thrill of 2 year-old War Command’s victory. As his white-blazed faced streaked across the finish line his sire’s (War Front) reputation grew even more in the minds of British and European thoroughbred owners and breeders. They had to be asking themselves, “Have we got another Northern Dancer on the rise?” since The Dancer really made his legacy through the loyalty of Coolmore-Ballydoyle, specifically Vincent O’Brien, to his progeny. Most of whom proved to be brilliant. Cross-entered in both the prestigious St. James Palace Stakes (June 17) and the Diamond Jubilee (June 21), Coolmore-Ballydoyle will be dreaming of a performance that repeats War Command’s brilliance of almost a year ago:\n\nHowever, a little-publicized truth (according to Ballydoyle) is that the “War Fronts can be quite lazy” and War Command pulled that card in his most recent outing in May at Newmarket, where he finished a dismal 9th in the 2000 Guineas, failing to pick up the pace when it counted most. If he does this again at Royal Ascot, he’ll likely be pummelled by either the brilliant Night of Thunder or Kingman.\n\nNight of Thunder, a 3 year-old son of Dubawi, is trained by the eminent Richard Hannon. Having won 3 of his 4 lifetime starts, the colt has never been out of the money. More importantly, Night of Thunder is this year’s winner of the Quipco 2000 Guineas, taking it despite hanging out very far as he and jockey Keiron Fallon came to the finish. But he beat War Command, the subsequent Derby winner, Australia, as well as a very good colt in Kingman despite what could have been a disastrous error:\n\nKingman and Night of Thunder have been challenging each other throughout the season. While Juddmonte’s Kingman lost to his rival in the Quipco 2000 Guineas, he went on to subsequently take the Irish 2000 Guineas in devastating fashion. The son of Invincible Spirit has only ever lost once in his 5 lifetime starts. Accordingly, Prince Khalid Abdullah and trainer John Gosden’s champion has been accorded the status of favourite to take the St. James Palace next week:\n\nSOME PROMINENT AMERICAN SIRES REPRESENTED AT ASCOT 2014\n\nThe War Fronts make up a small army, with newcomers War Envoy and The Great War running in the prestigious Coventry Stakes for 2 year-olds on June 17; Guerre and Due Diligence running on the same day in the King’s Stand; Giovanni Boldini joining War Command in the St. James Palace Stakes; and a filly, Peace and War is running for Sheikh Suhaim Al Thani/QRL/M Al Kubaisi in the Queen Mary Stakes (June 18).\n\nElusive Quality is represented in the St. James Palace Stakes (June 17) by Michaelmas who runs for Ballydoyle; Great White Eagle in the Jersey Stakes for Ballydoyle (June 18); Elusive Guest for John Guest Racing runs in the Jersey Stakes (June 18); and the fabulous mare Certify is due to run in the Duke of Cambridge Stakes (June 18) for Godolphin.\n\nBig Brown is represented by the very good colt, Darwin, who runs in the King’s Stand (June 17) for Ballydoyle.\n\nBluegrass Cat is represented by Biting Bullets who runs for Mrs. Joanna Hughes in another 2 year-old race, the Windsor Castle Stakes (June 17).\n\nQuality Road has a 2 year-old colt, Hootenanny, running in the Windsor Castle Stakes in the colours of Tabor, Magnier and Smith (June 17).\n\nStreet Cry has Street Force running in the Jersey Stakes (June 18) for Saeed Mañana.\n\nDynaformer is represented by Somewhat who runs in the colours of Sheikh Majid bin Mohammed Al Maktoum in the King Edward VII Stakes (June 20).\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nWe all know our own racing venues pretty well, but keeping track of international racing to the same degree can really be a challenge. This year at Royal Ascot 2012, the stars of thoroughbred racing are aligned — Frankel, Black Caviar, So You Think, Fame and Glory, St. Nicholas Abbey, Helmet, Sepoy, Ortensia and a host of other elite thoroughbreds whose names are less familiar to many.\n\nThis article reviews some of the top horses and their connections who are slated to run at Royal Ascot next week. The content is designed to keep our readers on top of all the key information as it is known at this time. The goal is to provide VAULT readers with an informed viewing context.\n\nWe doubt that readers will digest all of the content in one sitting, so the article will remain posted until Wednesday, June 20th for those who might want to visit again before specific races, or read up on some of the winners. Then, on Wednesday Part Two will be posted and cover the remainder of Thursday at Ascot, as well as Friday and Saturday.\n\nNOTE REGARDING ROYAL ASCOT COVERAGE IN N. AMERICA: TVG begins its live coverage of Royal Ascot on Tuesday, June 19th and HRTV will provide re-caps in the evening throughout Royal Ascot, for those who won’t be able to tune-in for the live coverage. Just check SCHEDULE on the HRTV home page. If you’re not on HRTV, the UK’s Racing Post has a ROYAL ASCOT page where all of the races will be shown, though probably after the fact. (Not entirely sure whether the live stream is available without registering.) As well, there is the UK site, At The Races. Just go to this address and click on the VIDEO tab. Most races will be posted, although not in real time. The e-address is: http://www.attheraces.com/ascot\n\nToo, Blood-Horse, DRF, Thoroughbred Times, The Paulick Report and other popular North American racing websites will likely post the results of the most prestigious races the same or next day. In Canada, CBC Television televises Royal Ascot on June 23 for one hour only (sigh!) from 5:00 – 6:00 p.m. (We’re assuming that Black Caviar’s run will feature, as well as Frankel’s.)\n\nRACE CARD\n\nIn the UK, the racing program is referred to as a “race card.” As of today, the cards still reflect all the horses who’ve been nominated. Coolmore-Ballydoyle’s So You Think, for example, is listed in more than one race. Below is the schedule for the full 5 days of Royal Ascot 2012, courtesy of the UK’s Racing Post. Entries in each race should be finalized about 24 hours before the race. If you refer to the Racing Post link (above) there is a section labelled CARDS that will be updated and tell you exactly who is running on the day.\n\nUpcoming races at Royal Ascot 2012\n\nFRANKEL\n\nFirst up is the undefeated FRANKEL (Galileo) who runs on Tuesday in the 1-mile Queen Anne Stakes. This will be Frankel’s first race at a mile. The brilliant 4 year-old will be taken on by 3 from Coolmore-Ballydoyle (Aidan O’Brien): Excelebration (Exceed and Excel) whom Frankel has already beaten, champion So You Think (High Chaparral) and 7 year-old Windsor Palace (Danehill Dancer). Australia’s Helmet (Exceed and Excel) has also been nominated, but may start against Black Caviar in the Diamond Jubilee instead. Should he run against Frankel, Helmet is not to be underestimated. He was a 2 year-old superstar in Australia and has continued his winning ways, albeit erratically because he tends to act up on race day and ruin his own chances. But he has the speed and, if he’s sharp, the determination. Frankel will have his half-brother Bullet Train (Sadler’s Wells) in there too. Bullet Train has raced with the champ twice and tends to play the role of pacesetter, even though he’s a very good colt in his own right.\n\nHere’s trainer, Sir Henry Cecil, talking about his colt’s chances:\n\nBLACK CAVIAR\n\nArguably, the other superstar to grace the turf at Royal Ascot 2012 is Australia’s Black Caviar. She will have her regular jockey, Luke Nolan, in the irons and we assume that Peter Moody, her trainer, will also be present — Moody is currently training his great mare from afar, relying on modern technology to watch her works each day. (Nolan has landed Medicean Man in the King’s Stand on Tuesday and may pick up more mounts prior to the Diamond Jubilee.) At the present time, 57 horses have been nominated to go up against the undefeated mare in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes on the last day of the meet, Saturday, June 23rd. That number will change as we get closer to race day, so be sure to check the race card on the Racing Post site. At present, Black Caviar’s rivals include 4 from Aidan O’Brien: Power (Oasis Dream), Reply (Oasis Dream) and the fillies After (Danehill Dancer) and Wave (Dansili). And as if that’s not enough, there’s Society Rock (Rock of Gibraltar), a colt who won this race at Ascot last year and loves the going there. Too, Australia’s Helmet is also nominated, as is Roger Charlton’s Bated Breath (Dansili). Charlton is rated 4th best trainer in the UK and feels his colt’s chances against the Aussie heroine are better than good. These last 3 have also been nominated in other Royal Ascot races, so there may be defections.\n\nStill, as the Australian racing community sees it, their superstar mare will make all of the running, even though she’s had to travel halfway around the world to do it.\n\nWe start our video line-up with Black Caviar’s arrival at Newmarket, followed by a look at Society Rock’s trainer, James Fanshawe and then wind up with pre-race ditties and analysis, courtesy of TVN Racing Network (Australia) under the title “Black Caviar’s Destiny.” Note the ties sported by announcer Bruce Clark and analyst Mick Sharkey — TOO CUTE!\n\nTHE KING’S STAND STAKES (Tuesday, June 19)\n\nThe King’s Stand is going to be very competitive this year and we might expect several defections from the Diamond Jubilee to run, since it is also a sprint. Chief among these might be the promising Bated Breath (Dansili). Ortensia (Testa Rossa) who has already had 30 starts and is 11-3-4 is going to be a contender for certain: the 7 year-old Aussie mare is on a winning streak, having just completed a hat-trick of victories, including a come from behind effort in the Al Quoz Sprint at Meydan. Other horses of interest include Little Bridge (Faltaat) who has had 19 starts, winning the last 2, Sole Power (Kyllachy) who has a track record of 24-4-5-4 and might be sitting on a big effort and Tangerine Trees, who has won 12 of 35 starts and won twice the last 3 times out. Of interest: Luke Nolan (Black Caviar’s regular jockey) rides Medicean Man.\n\nHere’s the great Ortensia, pulling a Zenyatta and winning the Al Quoz Sprint recently at Meydan:\n\nST. JAMES’S PALACE STAKES (Tuesday, June 19)\n\nThis prestigious race features a few familiar names from Coolmore-Ballydoyle: Daddy Long Legs (also nominated for the King Edward VII on Friday, June 23), Power (Oasis Dream) and Wrote (High Chaparral). Another starter from trainer Aidan O’Brien is Requisition (Invincible Spirit) who is lightly raced and has won his last 2 starts. The brilliant Lucayan (Turtle Bay) also looks to be running in the St. James; he’s also won his last 2 starts and can be counted on to be very well placed early in the race. William Haggas has Nine Realms (Green Desert) nominated here as well and he’s another lightly raced colt who won the last time out. Green Desert was a fabulous sire and Nine Realms could be described as promising. For Street Cry fans, Fencing, trained by the incomparable John Gosden also looks to be starting in the St. James.\n\nHere is Lucayan winning at Longchamp:\n\nCOVENTRY STAKES FOR 2 YEAR-OLDS (Tuesday, June 19)\n\nThe babies are on-track late in the day for the running of the Coventry Stakes. Of interest here are Annnunciation (Proclamation), Artigiano (Distorted Humour) who will have Godolphin’s skilled Frankie Dettori aboard, William Haggas’ Odooj (Pivotal) who is also nominated for the Windsor Castle (earlier on the same day), Richard Hannon’s Jalaa (Street Cry) and 2 from Coolmore-Ballydoyle: Lines of Battle (War Front) and Pedro the Great (Henrythenavigator). Given their age and experience, it’s really anyone’s race!\n\nWINDSOR CASTLE STAKES for 2 year-olds (Tuesday, June 19)\n\nThe last race on the Tuesday card again highlights promising 2 year-olds. Aidan O’Brien brings Gale Force Ten (Oasis Dream) and Parliament Square (Acclamation), while famed trainer, Richard Hannon, has loaded the race with 7 nominated colts: Alhebayeb (Dark Angel), Annunciation (Proclamation), Ask Dad (Intikhab), Ceelo (Green Desert), Lyric Ace (Thousand Words), Master of War (Compton Place) and Mister Marc (Acclamation). One would not overlook trainer William Haggas’ Odooj, a son of Pivotal, one of the UK’s truly outstanding sires.\n\nBritish trainer William Haggas has the distinction of being Lester Piggott’s son-in-law. But far more impressive — for a trainer with a modest number of horses at the turn of the century — is the fact that he has a 100% success rate in the the Epsom Derby and the Investic Oaks; he won the Derby with long shot Shaamit (Mtoto) in 1996 and came back again with the great filly, Dancing Rain (Danehill Dancer) to win the Oaks in 2011. Below is an interview with Haggas that focuses on his 2012 Royal Ascot hopes, including Roy & Gretchen Jackson’s (Barbaro) filly, Sentaril.\n\n150th Anniversary running of the Prince of Wales Stakes (Wednesday, June 20)\n\nA highlight in this race, at least for any who has yet to see him, is HRH the Queen’s champion colt, Carlton House. The son of Street Cry out of Talented (Bustino) is lightly raced at 4, although 2 of his three wins have come in stakes races. Trained by Sir Michael Stoute, Carlton House is bound to be the sentimental favourite in this Jubilee year. UPDATE: So You Think has been confirmed for this race and it may set up as quite the dual!\n\nQUEEN MARY STAKES: 2 YO FILLIES (WEDNESDAY, JUNE 20)\n\nIt would be fair to say that this 5-furlong race will be hotly contested since, as of today, well over a dozen of these babies have wins, places or shows already chalked up. But, they are babies. Which means that almost any of them stand a decent chance of winning.\n\nIf you’re looking for a North American connection, Smart Strike’s Madame Mojito, bred at Lane’s End, is 2 for 2. Star Up In The Sky is a daughter of Speightstown who has only run once before and came in a respectably 4th. And there’s also Jadanna, a daughter of Mujadil (USA), who is also 2 for 2.\n\nOther fillies that might sparkle include: Lady Phill (4 starts and never out of the money); JillNextDoor, a daughter of Henrythenavigator who is 2 for 2; a very good daughter of Pivotal with the unenviable name Hairy Rocket; a daughter of Tagula called Projectisle who is 2-1-1-0, as are the fillies Miss Diva (Acclamation) and Satsuma (Compton Place). Upward Spiral (Teofilo/BM sire Fantastic Light) comes in undefeated, with a maiden under her belt.\n\nRIBBLESDALE STAKES FOR FILLIES (THURSDAY, JUNE 21)\n\nThis race is setting up to look very much like a re-play of the 2012 Investic Oaks, with most of the principals nominated to start as of today.\n\nWe should also mention that Coolmore-Ballydoyle (Aidan O’Brien) have no less than five GALILEO fillies nominated for the Ribblesdale: Was (winner of this year’s Oaks), Maybe (brilliant winner for her sire, having only lost twice in 7 starts), Kissed (2 for 2), Twirl (who is 5-1-2-1 and whose BM sire is none other than Storm Cat) and Up (6-1-2-1).\n\nOther stars who ran extremely well in the Oaks and are entered in the Ribblesdale include Andrew Lloyd-Webber’s lovely filly, The Fugue (Dansili) who, despite a troubled trip was closing like an express train to finish third in the Oaks. Trained by the brilliant John Gosden, we can expect a great run from her. The Fugue’s race record to date is 4-2-0-1.\n\nAnother filly to watch, who ran second in the Oaks, is Shirocco Star (Shirocco).

Note the effort from The Fugue in particular. Shirocco Star is also a contender.\n\nNOTE: Remember to tune in next week on Wednesday, June 20 for PART TWO (Royal Ascot racing from Thursday, June 21 – Saturday, June 23)\n\nRead Full Post »"
