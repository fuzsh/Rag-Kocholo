Tell your friends today, and stop out for a good night out!!\n\nHours\n\nMon: 3 Pm – 11 Pm\n\nTue – Wed: 3 Pm – 12 Am\n\nThu – Sat: 12 Pm – 1 Am ??\n\nSun: 12 Pm – 12 Am\n\nContact\n\n717-792-9838\n\nSend us an email\n\nLocation\n\n738 N Biesecker Rd.\n\nThomasville, PA 17364\n\nOWNED & OPERATED since 1988\n\nAbout The Race Horse Tavern\n\nA local neighborhood bar introducing a Fresh New menu, Fantastic and Knowledgeable Bartenders and staff, New Ideas. A fun, friendly Atmosphere, Pool Leagues on Sunday,Monday,Tuesdays,Wednesday & Thurdays nights. Karaoke on Thursday nights Also BIKE NIGHTS on Thursdays starting APRIL 18TH 2024 THRU OCTOBER. Live music every Friday, Saturday and Sunday inside on our stage or outside on our 4 seasons patio!!! With a smoke free environment in the main bar area. COUNTRY LINE DANCING with BRITTANIE every other Sunday. We are looking forward to serving you. And we thank you for your buisness!\n\nATTENTION!!!\n\nOK peeps this is a public service announcement from the RACEHORSE TAVERN. My family has owned the Tavern since 1988 (35 years). I acquired it thru the untimely passing of my father almost 12 years ago. The reason for this post is this, We’ve been doing live music on and off since the very beginning and as of the last 20 years at least every weekend. Now to my point the cover charge has always been $5. I have spoken to both sides of this debate for opinions from both sides. I can assure you that whatever comes in at the door is ALWAYS given to the band as part of their pay. As you are all aware EVERYTHING is increasing in price and that the list would go on well into tomorrow, so with that being said we are raising the cover charge at the RACEHORSE TAVERN to $10 on some events and could be more depending on the event. We will continue to have other event’s that may require a higher entry price but you will be well informed if that is the case or if it will be a ticketed event.\n\nWe try to bring you the very best of local and regional acts, and we will continue to do just that!!!\n\nThe other piece of information I would like to let you know is that starting Friday MARCH 3RD all who are present for the start of the entertainment will be expected to pay the cover. For those who have been there for a while such as after work, or just hanging out we will courteously allow you to finish your drink and or food. no more then 30 minutes, you will then be required to pay cover to stay with us or come back on another day.\n\nFor those interested in reserving a table you will be required to pay the cover charge for the entire table based on # of seats you are reserving, or for however many it is sitting at the table, upon entry regardless of when you come in.\n\nPlease keep in mind if you are only reserving seats for 2 or 3 people you will be sitting at a table with other cool people just like you.\n\nWe wIll BE GOING smoke free in 2024. We have provided you a 4 seasons patio that is heated and out of the elements for your smoking needs during inclement weather. You may also take advantage of our full service bar out on the patio as well. We will have access to your tab at any cash register if you started one inside you may add to it outside with either food or drinks or both.\n\nPlease remember if you have any complaints or discussions about this matter PLEASE address them to me not the bartenders as my Staff will be following my direction in doing their job.\n\nEvery WEDNESDAY starting DECEMBER 20TH\n\nWORLD TAVERN TRIVIA RETURNS !!!\n\nSTARTING WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 20TH 2023 with DJ DUTCH!!!!\n\nEXCEPT THE FIRST WEDNESDAY WHICH IS OPEN MIC NIGHT!!!\n\nEXCITING BAR TRIVIA\n\nEnjoy a night out with your friends while you Eat, Drink, and THINK!
