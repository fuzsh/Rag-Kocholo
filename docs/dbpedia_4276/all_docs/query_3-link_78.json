Through ownership with Tony, we have had the pleasure of making friends with other owners and likeminded racing enthusiasts, leading to our race day experience being even more enjoyable.\"\n\nJim & Jane Higgens\n\nHEY DOC & KINKY BOOM Part-Owners\n\n\"MMR are very successful on the racetrack and have delivered a lot of joy and excitement to me and my family through our successes. I thoroughly recommend Tony and his team you won't regret being part of the action\"\n\nBill Ellis\n\nCONCEALER, KINKY BOOM & SANCTIMONIOUS Part-Owner\n\n\"The professionalism of the McEvoy Mitchell team ensures owners, wherever they live, are kept abreast of their horse’s training. Up-to-the-minute reports arrive regularly and once a horse accepts, the owner is armed with all the necessary information as their horse heads into a race.\"\n\nGraham Fischer\n\nDESPATCH Part-Owner\n\n“I am a first time member of an All Ladies Syndicate with Tony (McEvoy Mitchell) and I can’t tell you how enjoyable it has been. The communication and professionalism is to be admired.\"\n\nRobyn Parker\n\nSUNLIGHT Part-Owner"
