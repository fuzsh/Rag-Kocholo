        "text": "Jockeys' championship rivals Kieren Fallon and Frankie Dettori enjoyed contrasting fortunes in the main event at York yesterday as North Light advertised his Vodafone Derby claims.\n\nFallon's season may be about to take a turn for the better after the colt stamped himself a live Epsom contender with an impressive performance to win the totesport Dante Stakes.\n\nBut Dettori was hit with a four-day ban which will rule him out of key rides for Godolphin in the Boylesports Irish 1000 Guineas and Tattersalls Gold Cup.\n\nFallon, still to face an inquiry into newspaper allegations, is only third in the championship race this season behind Dettori and Darryll Holland.\n\nBut the champion was all smiles after he took this Group Two prize aboard 6-1 chance North Light, and immediately nominated this handsome and well-built horse as a live candidate to give him a third win in the world's most famous Flat race.\n\n\"He's got everything you would like for the race,\" he said. \"He's got toe, a great attitude and there's no reason why he wouldn't stay the trip.\n\n\"The only worry I had today was that he might be a top-of-the-ground horse, but that good to soft going didn't seem to stop him.\"\n\nFallon kicked on as the field turned for home with five furlongs to travel in this Derby trial.\n\nAnd although North Light was strongly challenged by Dettori on Rule Of Law in the closing stages, he battled on gamely.\n\nThe Sir Michael Stoute-trained winner held on by half a length, with the 3-1 favourite Let The Lion Roar a further two and a half lengths away in third.\n\n\"It was a great trial - possibly the strongest of them so far,\" Fallon went on.\n\n\"I wanted to make it a test as they weren't going that very quick, so I kicked on a long way from home, and on the first run of the season it's a tough ask to do that.\n\n\"I didn't know Frankie was coming at me. I could see the two on my right, but he took me by surprise a bit. I nearly did a Ballinger Ridge!\n\n\"He's got more speed than his half-brothers (useful stayers Cover Up and Researched) and he's a good horse going the right way at the right time.\"\n\nNorth Point is a best-priced 10-1 chance with Victor Chandler as he bids to become the seventh horse to complete the Dante-Derby double.\n\nInitial quotes of 12-1 from William Hill and Paddy Power immediately after the race were soon snapped up.\n\nStoute said he felt his charge had \"an each-way chance\".\n\n\"I can't tell you that he's going to hack up,\" he smiled. \"But it was a very solid performance. He's done nothing wrong on the racecourse. He was a bit unfortunate first time out at Sandown to get beaten a short head.\n\n\"He's got a lovely temperament and a lot of scope. He has always been a horse brimmed full of promise.\n\n\"He'll go for the Derby after this performance. I don't think the preliminaries will be a problem for him.\n\n\"I would hope he'd act on the track at Epsom as he's a well-balanced, athletic horse.\"\n\nRunner-up Rule Of Law is set to join stablemate Snow Ridge in the Epsom line-up.\n\nGodolphin racing manager Simon Crisford said: \"I was really pleased, because he was definitely a little short on work. We had to get a run into him. He'll run in the Derby and will definitely get a mile and a half.\n\n\"He and Snow Ridge have never been put together at any time. Snow Ridge was second in the Guineas and is the number one hope from the stable, but this horse is a very able number two.\"\n\nDettori, however, received a four-day ban (May 23-26) for using his whip with excessive frequency, out of stride pattern and without giving his mount time to respond.\n\nThe Italian will miss the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh and the Tattersalls Gold Cup on the same afternoon - the race in which Godolphin star Sulamani could make his seasonal reappearance.\n\nThird-home Let the Lion Roar also remains a Derby possible, with trainer John Dunlop reporting: \"He definitely wants a mile and a half. He travelled really well, but he didn't finish when it mattered.\""
