        "text": "Lightly-raced Ulysses colt looked an unlucky loser in the Dante.\n\nPassenger will be supplemented at a cost of GBP 85,000 for the Betfred Derby on Monday morning, Sir Michael Stoute has said. The master trainer, who landed the Epsom Classic with Desert Crown last year, will be represented in Saturday’s mile-and-a-half showpiece by the fast-improving Ulysses colt, who was denied a clear run in the Dante Stakes at York. Passenger, owned by the Niarchos family, made a taking debut when scoring in a mile maiden at Newmarket on April 20. He was withdrawn from the Dee Stakes at Chester due to heavy ground so connections paid GBP 14,000 to supplement the colt into the Group Two Dante on the Knavesmire. Upped to an extended 10 furlongs and racing keenly early on his second start, jockey Richard Kingscote found his path blocked when attempting to mount a challenge two furlongs from home. Once seeing daylight, the 9-4 favourite stayed on nicely and forced a dead-heat for third, just a length and a half behind The Foxes, who enjoyed the run of the race. Passenger, currently 5-1 third-favourite with the sponsors, will bid to give Stoute a seventh Derby success following victories with Shergar (1981), Shahrastani (1986), Kris Kin (2003), North Light (2004), Workforce (2010) and Desert Crown. He “worked nicely” in a mile workout on the Al Bahathri Polytrack in Newmarket on Saturday morning, according to Stoute, who confirmed: “We are planning to supplement him for the Derby in the morning.” Desert Crown, returning from 11 months off after the Derby, saw his colours lowered for the first time when the fast-finishing Hukum overhauled him in the last few strides of the Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown on Thursday evening. Stoute added: “He’s all right. He did everything right until the last hundred yards when he tied up a bit.”\n\nFollow us on Twitter racing365dotcom and like our Facebook page.\n\nLatest\n\nMore to come yet from Nottingham winner, says Morris\n\nGoing up in trip is proving to the liking of Sir Mark Prescott-trained filly.\n\nAga Khan moving horses with Jean-Claude Rouget to Graffard\n\nVadeni was one of the stars of the Aga’s partnership.\n\nMenuisier has sights set on Leger glory with Sunway\n\nIrish Derby runner-up did well to finish where he did in luckless King George run.\n\nNashwa could make return to the track in the autumn\n\nTop-class mare has had a lengthy break since run in Dubai.\n\nAll eyes will be on Economics at Deauville on Thursday\n\nDante winner has not been since brilliant victory at York in May.\n\n‘Everyone is so happy with him’ – Ambiente Friendly team counting down to York\n\nDerby runner-up firmly on course for City Of Troy rematch.\n\nBelieving the key word for Boughey in bid for first York success\n\nSpeedy filly expected to be suited by Nunthorpe test.\n\nJapanese ace Durezza all set for City Of Troy clash at York\n\nChristophe Lemaire will be on the Knavesmire next week to partner the Group One winner.\n\nCheveley Park team excited about pair of Stoute prospects\n\nHomebred duo Anna Swan and Formal both made impressive winning debuts.\n\nCox wants dry spell ahead of Ghostwriter’s International bid\n\nTrainer may also be represented in the Nunthorpe Stakes with Kerdos."
