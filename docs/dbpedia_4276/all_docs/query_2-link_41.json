        "text": "LONDON, England -- Long-time Epsom Derby favorite Yeats has been pulled out of Saturday's classic because of a recurring muscle problem.\n\nIrish trainer Aidan O'Brien, who won the Derby in 2001 with Galileo and in 2002 with High Chaparral, made the decision after the colt exercised on Wednesday.\n\nSnow Ridge, bidding to give jockey Frankie Dettori his first Derby victory, is the new favorite at 9-4.\n\nNorth Light, from Sir Michael Stoute's stable, which trained last year's winner Kris Kin, is 11-4.\n\nO'Brien said the colt had been suffering from a muscle problem for the past 10 days.\n\n\"We looked at Yeats again this morning and his muscle problem has not improved sufficiently, so we think it is in the best interest of the horse not to run in the Derby,\" O'Brien said. \"We plan to give him a complete rest.\"\n\nLatest betting: 9-4 Snow Ridge, 11-4 North Light, 6-1 Salford City, 7-1 Percussionist, 8-1 American Post, 14-1 and upwards others.\n\nClick Here to try 4 Free Trial Issues of Time!"
