        "text": "Sir Michael Stoute will be hopeful that Conduit can break his personal St Leger hoodoo when he lines up for the Ladbrokes St Leger this afternoon.\n\nThere is a belief at Freemason Lodge that Stoute-who has saddled five runner's-up in the Classic-has a horse with the ideal blend of speed and stamina, one capable of erasing so many heartaches, which include the mighty Shergar, who was beaten in the Leger when starting at 4-9 in 1981.\n\nConduit carries the colours of the Ballymacoll Stud, who have continued the racing interests of late owner, Lord Weinstock, such a staunch supporter of the St Leger, in which he was successful with the Dick Hern-trained Sun Princess 25 years ago.\n\nBallymacoll have been responsible for three of Stoute's five seconds in the race (Hellenic, Saddler's Hall and Air Marshall) and stud manager Peter Reynolds revealed last week that he is \"getting the right vibes\".\n\nReynolds, who has been associated with the Weinstock family for nearly three decades, said: \"We know how tough a race the St Leger is for a three-year-old, and Lord Weinstock always maintained that winning it with Sun Princess cost us the Arc, which is the one jewel that we don't yet have in our crown.\"\n\nConduit is a little easier to handle than Sun Princess, who was trained by Dick Hern and won a good renewal of the classic under Willie Carson in 1983.\n\n\"She was one of the most brilliant animals you could ever ride, but unmanageable, everything was an argument,\" said Carson. \"The more you pulled at her, the more she'd fight.\n\n\"The most important thing was to get her to relax. In the Oaks she was still a maiden and she won by 12 lengths. I got fed up holding her!\"\n\nSun Princess was the widest-margin winner in Oaks history and the late Dick Hern said upon her death in 2001: \"She was a great filly with terrific ability. She certainly won very easily at Epsom and I was very proud of her.\n\n\"She was very free as a youngster and we had a job to get her to canter. I thought she'd probably win the Oaks because she'd been going so well - but not by 12 lengths.\"\n\nAfter Epsom, it was on to York. Carson added: \"In the Yorkshire Oaks there were only four runners, and the other three were planning to go slow because they thought I'd have trouble holding her, but I surprised them all by jumping out and making the running. That spoiled her, because from then on she always wanted to jump off in front.\n\n\"She won the St Leger with soft ground helping us, and I thought I had the Arc won, but All Along came and beat us (by a length).\n\n\"She was a tremendous filly with so much ability. If she'd learned to relax enough she would have been the best you've ever seen.\"\n\nAs a broodmare, Reynolds recalled that Sun Princess's temperament contrasted sharply with that of the headstrong racehorse, saying: \"She was a most wonderful character and a very easy mare to deal with. A real lady.\"\n\nAnd if you believe in omens, you'll be cheering on Conduit today. Ballymacoll waited 25 years after Troy's Epsom Derby triumph before North Light gave the Co. Meath stud another victory in the classic.\n\nIt is 25 years since Sun Princess won at Doncaster."
