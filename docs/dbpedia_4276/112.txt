A PELVIC injury has caused the retirement of last year's Vodafone Derby winner North Light.

His trainer, Sir Michael Stoute, said yesterday, "North Light has sustained a stress fracture of the right ilial wing and will now be retired.

"He has been a joy to train and we shall long remember his victories in the Dante Stakes and Epsom Derby."

North Light won three times in seven starts and was ridden on six occasions by Kieren Fallon, including in his memorable victory over Rule Of Law at Epsom.

This son of Danehill won a Goodwood maiden on his second and last run as a juvenile and earned his trip to the Derby with a convincing victory in the Dante Stakes at York on his reappearance.

North Light never won again after Epsom, but he ran with credit to finish second to Grey Swallow in the Irish Derby, when the fast ground was blamed for his defeat.

He rounded off his three-year-old career with a close fifth behind Bago in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

On his return this season North Light was a disappointing second to New Morning when odds-on for the Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown Park.

The son of Danehill was bred by and raced for the Ballymacoll Stud, and racing manager Peter Reynolds was saddened by the news.

He said, "We are all gutted here in Ballymacoll. We bred him and his mother and his grandmother.

"It's a bit of a disaster, but, as long as the horse is still OK, I'm sure he can go on and do other jobs.

"It's a serious loss for us and Michael Stoute. Keeping a Derby winner in training at four is always risky. There are no plans for his retirement yet."
