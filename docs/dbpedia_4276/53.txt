North Light has won the 225th Vodafone Derby at Epsom, giving champion jockey Kieren Fallon a famous Classic double.

Fallon, who won another big race the Oaks on Friday on Ouija Board, took Europe's richest race by a length and a half on the 7-2 joint favourite.

It was the jockey's third Derby win and the fourth for champion trainer Sir Michael Stoute. Rule of Law came second, and Let The Lion Roar third.

But it was a disappointing for Frankie Dettori, who really wanted to win.

At one point Dettori's horse Snow Ridge looked like it might be in with a chance, but the challenge faded in the final furlong.

Meath made most of the early running with Fallon keeping North Light handily placed in second.

But in the end North Light raced ahead to take the title.

More than 120,000 people were at the famous course to watch North Light take the Â£800,000 first prize.
