A PELVIC injury has caused the retirement of last year's Vodafone Derby winner North Light.

His trainer Michael Stoute said yesterday: "North Light has sustained a stress fracture of the right ilial wing and will now be retired. He was a joy to train."

The son of Danehill won three races from seven starts and was ridden six times by Kieren Fallon, including in his memorable win over Rule Of Law at Epsom.

Fallon, who has won the premier Classic three times, said yesterday North Light was his "favourite Derby horse". "He had a great attitude and bags of speed for a horse who stayed so well," added the jockey.

North Light won a Goodwood maiden on his second and last run as a juvenile and earned his trip to the Derby with a convincing victory in the Dante Stakes at York on his reappearance.

He never won again after Epsom, but he ran with credit to finish second to Grey Swallow in the Irish Derby, when the fast ground was blamed for his defeat.

He rounded off his three-year-old career with a close fifth behind Bago in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

On his return this season North Light was a disappointing second to New Morning when odds-on for the Brigadier Gerard Stakes.
