North Light, winner of last year's Derby and over Â£1m in prizemoney, has been retired after suffering a pelvic injury. But there was better news yesterday of the 2004 Oaks winner, Ouija Board, whose career had appeared in doubt.

An autumn campaign is still being considered for the Ed Dunlop-trained filly. However, Sir Michael Stoute yesterday announced that North Light had run his last race. "He has been a joy to train and we shall long remember his victories in the Dante Stakes and Epsom Derby," said the trainer.

The son of Danehill was bred by and raced for the Ballymacoll Stud, whose racing manager Peter Reynolds said: "It's a bit of a disaster. There are no plans for his retirement yet. It's tough, but we'll just have to find another horse for the Arc."

North Light is sure to find a place at stud, but it is not Ballymacoll's policy to stand stallions at their operation in Ireland.

Ed Dunlop yesterday confirmed that Ouija Board had returned from York last week with a stress fracture to her near-fore cannonbone, but added: "We haven't retired her yet, far from it. Hopefully we'll see her back later in the year."

Paul Hanagan was handed a seven-day suspension for improper riding by Beverley stewards yesterday. The jockey was found to have struck fellow rider Dean Mernagh with his whip after the finish of the opening race, in which Hanagan finished fourth on Island Odyssey, a short head behind Mernagh on Blushing Hilary.
