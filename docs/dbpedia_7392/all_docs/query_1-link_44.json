        "text": "Through the International History (IHIS) major, students study how the world has changed over time and the impact of the social, political and economic forces that continue to shape its ongoing formation. Drawing on the interdisciplinarity of the SFS curriculum, IHIS majors develop a nuanced and critical understanding of the complex events and forces that inform the global present.\n\nIn the face of seemingly unprecedented world events such as a once-in-a-century pandemic, challenges to the liberal world order, resurgent authoritarianism, democratic backsliding and demands for racial and environmental justice, IHIS students are equipped with both the knowledge and perspectives critical to make sense of an increasingly complex present. Through their coursework and independent research projects, IHIS students will evaluate historical arguments, explore their implications for today and make their own evidence-based claims about the contours of global history.\n\nStudents in the IHIS major will:\n\nApproach the discipline of history as an ongoing conversation between sources, scholars and students\n\nAnalyze sources on the basis of their claims and the quality of their evidence\n\nTrace major themes, issues and developments in comparative, international and global history\n\nFormulate comparative questions and arguments about different societies and cultures\n\nAcademics Anchor\n\nAcademics\n\nStudents who major in IHIS draw on the resources of SFS, the Department of History and other programs throughout Georgetown College to offer a diverse range of courses in fields as varied as anthropology, philosophy, sociology, political science, economics, religious studies and literature. A particular focus of the major is the history of international relations, a field in which Georgetown is especially rich in resources.\n\nIHIS students also take advantage of the major’s international scope. The faculty includes specialists in each of the world’s major regions, and students can sample both introductory and advanced courses on all periods of history and areas of the world that present thematic, comparative and global perspectives.\n\nBack to Top\n\nGaining Essential Research and Analysis Skills\n\nThe International History major prepares students to understand modern events as the result of historical processes, as well as to analyze the forces that influence unfolding global events.\n\nStudents who major in International History gain skills critical to understanding how the current world emerged from the past, and how social, political and technological changes continue to influence its development. Students develop strong research and analytical skills that help them explore the complex ways in which the past continues to complicate current questions of power and culture, technology and work, race, gender, ideology and more.\n\nWriting in IHIS\n\nIHIS students hone their writing skills throughout their time in the program. In both required classes and electives, students have numerous opportunities to develop their writing through coursework that include everything from writing short reports to producing longer original research papers.\n\nIn IHIS, students learn how to work with a range of primary and secondary sources through classes that explore written texts, material culture, oral histories and a myriad of other sources providing insight into our shared global past. Many students produce original research which they develop into published papers or conference presentations.\n\nStudent Experience Anchor\n\nStudent Experience\n\nThe IHIS major’s faculty mentorship, study abroad opportunities and place within Georgetown’s Walsh School of Foreign Service in Washington, DC, provide unique opportunities for the study of international history.\n\nBack to Top\n\nStudy in the Heart of Washington, DC\n\nOur location in the heart of Washington, DC gives students a front-row seat to history in the making. IHIS students can witness and participate in the work of political organizations, grassroots social movements, cultural institutions and traditional and alternative diplomatic efforts just by stepping outside their front door! From accessing the world’s largest collection of books at the Library of Congress to combing through historical documents at the National Archives and discovering new information about the past at one of DC’s many world-class museums, IHIS students can explore the history of the world in Georgetown’s hometown.\n\nLearn more about student life in DC.\n\nInternational Opportunities\n\nIHIS is a gateway to the world, as well as to the past. Through SFS and Georgetown’s extensive study abroad and global internship options, students can trace important historical changes in events in the areas most relevant to their chosen concentration. In the past five years, IHIS majors have studied abroad in Stockholm, Sweden; Moscow, Russia; São Paulo, Brazil; Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and numerous other locations around the world.\n\nLearn more about international opportunities at SFS.\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nAt the very core of every major is a commitment to recognizing and celebrating cultural diversity and fostering an inclusive environment for all students. SFS is dedicated to welcoming students from all backgrounds to our community and the SFS Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Office leads school-wide efforts to enhance DEI in the SFS curriculum, faculty and recruitment of students and staff.\n\nNo matter their background or interests, students are sure to find like-minded and supportive peers here on the Hilltop. Whether through campus ministry, student groups or engaging with neighbors in DC, you can find your community at Georgetown.\n\nFind out more about DEI at SFS.\n\nFaculty Anchor\n\nFaculty\n\nIHIS majors are taught by world-leading scholars specializing in a wide range of regions, time periods and fields. Students can take classes examining sweeping international trends in environmental history or drill down into the experiences of small communities in a specific place and time.\n\nBack to Top\n\nIHIS Faculty\n\nIHIS majors are also taught by other faculty in the Georgetown University Department of History. Click here to see the full list of IHIS faculty.\n\nIHIS Curricular Dean\n\nCareers & Alumni Anchor\n\nCareers & Alumni\n\nThe IHIS major prepares students for successful futures in policy, law, foreign service, research and academia. Alumni apply the critical analytical and writing skills they acquired at SFS to careers as journalists, policy analysts, diplomats, global affairs consultants, security analysts and leaders in the nonprofit sector.\n\nBack to Top\n\nBuilding a Career at Georgetown\n\nWith DC on their doorstep, students can pursue career opportunities that can take them all over the world. IHIS students take advantage of the many internship opportunities here in the capital to begin building real-world work experience even before they graduate.\n\nAt Georgetown, students connect with the Cawley Career Education Center, where they can meet with professional advisors who can help with everything from developing a perfect resume to nailing job interviews and exploring how to break into a new industry or field. And the Hoya network students build throughout their time at Georgetown can help unlock new opportunities throughout their careers.\n\nIHIS Alumni Spotlight"
