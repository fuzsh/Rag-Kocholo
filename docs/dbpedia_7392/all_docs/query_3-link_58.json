I did my graduate work at Northwestern University (PhD, 2018) and before that I studied at Bates College, where I received a BA degree in Economics and Political Science (2009). While finishing my dissertation, I held temporary teaching appointments at Lake Forest College and the American University in Bulgaria. Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in the fields of history of political thought, moral and political philosophy, and contemporary democratic theory. Within the first two, I take a particular interest in the social and political thought of Kant and Hegel, as well as the tradition of early modern European political thought (esp. Hobbes, Locke, Hume, and Rousseau). In the third field, I take an interest in the normative democratic theories of Dewey, Rawls, Arendt, and Habermas. Secondary research interests include American political thought, international political theory (esp. contemporary philosophical theories of global justice and human rights), philosophy of social science, and ancient Greek political ethics (Plato and Aristotle).\n\nSubfield(s): Political Theory; history of political thought, moral and political philosophy, contemporary democratic theory\n\nDissertation: Kant's Libertarianism and Its Aftermath: Rereading The Conflict of the Faculties, Rethinking Hegel, Arendt, and Habermas (Ebscohost)\n\nCommittee: Farr, James Fulton (Chair); Alznauer, Mark Vinzenz; Dietz, Mary Golden;\n\nCurrent: Senior Research Scientist, Duke University, Political Science\n\nPlacement: Visiting Lecturer, American University in Bulgaria, Political Science\n\nCarrabregu, Gent2018Duke University\n\nSenior Research ScientistPolitical TheoryC\n\nInstitutional Website | Professional Website | Twitter: @rossecarroll | Academia.edu | LinkedIn\n\nBiography: My early education was in my native Ireland.

From 2009 to 2012 I served as Assistant Editor of Political Theory: an International Journal of Political Philosophy. Before arriving at Exeter in the autumn of 2015 I spent two years as Visiting Assistant Professor of Government at the College of William and Mary in Virginia.\n\nMy teaching and research are primarily in the history of early modern political thought with a particular focus on the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, Edmund Burke, David Hume, the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, and Alexis de Tocqueville. Thematically my work mainly deals with issues surrounding the passions, ridicule, fanaticism, religious toleration, and censorship.

Through innovative readings of some of the most important thinkers of science and politics of the near and distant past, including René Descartes, Thomas Hobbes, Giambattista Vico, and Hannah Arendt, Ephraim argues that the natural sciences are political because they are crucial sites in which the worldly relationships that bind together the human and nonhuman are inherited, augmented, and reconstructed.\n\nSubfield(s): Political Theory; Political Theory\n\nDissertation: Recovering the common root of science and politics: Reading Descartes and Hobbes with Vico (ProQuest)\n\nCommittee: Zerilli, Linda (Chair); Farr, James Fulton; Honig, Bonnie H\n\nCurrent: Associate Professor, Williams College, Political Science\n\nPlacement: Assistant Professor, Williams College, Political Science\n\nEphraim, Laura2010Williams College\n\nAssociate ProfessorPolitical TheoryE\n\nLinkedIn | Twitter: @boje_1984 | Google Scholar\n\nBiography: Muhammad Fajar (Ph.D.) is a research fellow at the Institute for Advanced Research (IFAR), the Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia.

She grew up down a red dirt road, dreaming of making a difference. Today, she’s the first to tell you that she’s as comfortable behind a podium as she is at a rodeo or a trail ride! Dara’s rural upbringing and extensive academic training give her unique insights that boost her ability to connect with people from various social and cultural backgrounds. Her life has twisted, turned, and bent around itself since she left that dirt road. Dara graduated from the University of Arkansas in 2017 with a combined B.A. in Political Science and African & African American Studies. From there, she was accepted into Northwestern University’s Political Science Graduate program where she earned both a Master’s (‘19) and a Ph.D. (‘23). While enrolled in college, Dara studied the origins and underpinnings of the significant disconnect between communities and the policymakers who serve them, always wondering, “if people don’t vote, who holds government officials accountable?”. Her research explores how rural African Americans experience political incorporation in the South and asks how access to economic, social, and political capital shapes their political perceptions. She leverages her years in the academy and political field experience in her many roles including research manager, mobilization strategist, and business owner. A detail-oriented investigator, she excels at translating policy and empirics for general and specified audiences. She's most interested in engaging, educating, and empowering voters through innovative integrated methods. Dara's system works because she doesn't assume what people care about. Instead, she prioritizes listening, providing context, and empowering people where they are. This method builds stronger connections and makes lasting changes in perceptions of politics and personal power.\n\nSubfield(s): Political science; African American studies; Blacks; Engagement; Mobilization; Politics; Rural; Voters\n\nDissertation: Dirt Road Democracy: How Political Context Shapes Rural Black Mobilization (ProQuest)\n\nCommittee: Rogers, Reuel R.

Gellman's research interests include comparative democratization, cultural resilience, memory and violence politics, and education policy in the Global South and the United States. Gellman's second monograph, Indigenous Language Politics in the Schoolroom: Cultural Survival in Mexico and the United States, looks at how heritage language learning operates in high schools as a tool for young people to resist culturecide—the intentional killing of culture. She uses collaborative methodology to work with Indigenous community stakeholders in far Northern California and southern Mexico to document, via interviews, focus groups, surveys, and observations, the impact of culturally conscious curricula in formal education. Gellman's first monograph, Democratization and Memories of Violence: Ethnic Minority Social Movements in Mexico, Turkey, and El Salvador (Routledge 2017) examines how some communities use memories of violence in mobilizations for cultural rights, particularly the right to mother tongue or heritage tongue education.\n\nGellman is also the founder and Director of the Emerson Prison Initiative (EPI), which makes college available to incarcerated students at Massachusetts Correctional Institution (MCI) at Concord, a men's medium security prison. Gellman works with the Massachusetts Department of Correction, Emerson College, and other partners to bring an Emerson College Bachelor of Arts in Media, Literature, and Culture to incarcerated students.

His other line of research engages with efforts to rethink democracy and collectivity in continental political thought. His work has appeared in European Journal of Political Theory and The Review of Politics.\n\nHe is currently working on a book project that explores how the modern idea of democracy emerged and evolved in nineteenth-century European thought against the background of the “social question” – i.e. the debates over the problems of social disintegration, poverty, and class conflict. More specifically, through an investigation of the thought of Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, Louis Blanc, and Jeanne Deroin this project recovers how democratic egalitarianism and participation were seen as ways of repairing social bonds, improving the conditions of the working classes, and promoting the common good.\n\nSubfield(s): Political Theory; the history of political thought and democratic theory, equality, participation, and political economy.\n\nDissertation: Claiming Culture: Ethnic Minority Rights Mobilizations in Mexico, Turkey, and El Salvador (ProQuest)\n\nCommittee: Dietz, Mary Golden (Chair); Farr, James Fulton; Lafont, Cristina; Spruyt, Hendrik\n\nCurrent: Assistant Professor, University of Connecticut, Department of Political Science\n\nPlacement: Visiting Assistant Professor, University of Connecticut, Department of Political Science\n\nGercek, Salih Emre2020University of Connecticut\n\nAssistant ProfessorPolitical TheoryG\n\nInstitutional Website | Professional Website | LinkedIn | Academia.edu\n\nBiography: Gina Giliberti is the Director of Speaker Events at World Affairs Council of Philadelphia, the region’s largest and oldest international affairs nonprofit with a combined 130 years of expertise in connecting Philadelphia to the world.\n\nGiliberti's dissertation examines the politics of religious emotion in the context of British colonial governance in India, contemporary global de-radicalization initiatives, and international and comparative law.
