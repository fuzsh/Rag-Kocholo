        "text": "I recently wrote about Generative AI and you seemed to have appreciated that ‚Äì many thanks! Today, I am publishing something about virtual RAN slicing. RAN slicing is one of the important new features of 5G networks and I believe this is a topic we need to discuss as it will most likely be part of the next generation standards as well. It distinguishes 5G and more generally NextG telecommunications networks from previous generations of such networks. In writing this blog I was thinking about what can I say that is new? That is different? So, I took a shot at it. https://lnkd.in/gb-Uv_Mm I believe that we at Microsoft Azure forOperators division have researched and produced some good results, which will make it easier for operators to offer RAN slicing and generally benefit from integration with Azure. Please read my latest blog and let me know what you think.\n\nThere is a lot of excitement about AI so I thought I should write about what we are doing in this space. Within Azure for Operators, we are taking advantage of the significant investments Microsoft has made and its expertise in programming foundation models by developing technical solutions that will give our customers a competitive advantage. Please read my latest blog on \"Empowering operators through generative AI technologies with Azure for Operators\" https://lnkd.in/gG_Pb3vB I would love to read your comments and thoughts on this subject. (#5G #AI #Cloud #GenAI #Telecommunication #NextG #6G #ML #Networking) These are fun times üòä\n\nMWC 2024 News (related to Microsoft): On Sunday, February 25 at 20:00 hours PT, and timed with MWC in Barcelona, via an OMB and Azure Blog, we (Microsoft) announced new AI and cloud solutions and capabilities. These highlight how operators can monetize their investments, run modern networks and carrier-grade workloads on a trusted hybrid cloud platform, enhance productivity, streamline business operations and elevate customer experiences by partnering with Microsoft in the era of AI. Accelerating telco transformation in the era of AI - The Official Microsoft Blog https://lnkd.in/g5YbdY7b\n\nToday is a wonderful day. Arjun Balasingam defended his PhD thesis titled, ‚ÄúApplication-Aware Scheduling Architectures for Mobile Systems‚Äù. He is Hari Balakrishnan‚Äôs and Mohammad Alizadeh‚Äôs Student at MIT‚Äôs EECS department. I had the unique pleasure of mentoring him at Microsoft and serving on his thesis committeealong with Radhika Mittal. He recently published a fabulous paper on network slicing, which he will be presenting at NSDI 2024. My heartiest congratulations and best wishes to him, his advisors and his family. We are very proud of you. We should watch him because I am confident that he will do extremely well in the future. Well done, Arjun. üòä"
