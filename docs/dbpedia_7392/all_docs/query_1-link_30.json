        "text": "Andrew Hodges, author of \"Alan Turing: The Enigma,\" was invited to speak at the UMN's Institute for Mathematics and its Applications in December of 2012. CBI was a co-sponsor of the lecture. He lecture, entitled, \"Alan Turing: The Power of Mathematical Discovery\" discussed Turing's short and extraordinary life, which had great consequences for modern computers, for the philosophy of mind, and for the outcome of the Second World War. But all these things, and more, sprang from his innovative work in mathematics. Andrew Hodges' talk illustrated the way that Turing seized on a great range of mathematical ideas and turned them into world-changing discoveries.\n\nEdsger W. Dijkstra (1972)\n\nDijkstra received the award \"for fundamental contributions to programming as a high, intellectual challenge; for eloquent insistence and practical demonstration that programs should be composed correctly, not just debugged into correctness; for illuminating perception of problems at the foundations of program design.\"\n\nDonald Ervin “Don” Knuth (1974)\n\nKnuth received the award \"for his major contributions to the analysis of algorithms and the design of programming languages, and in particular for his contributions to the \"art of computer programming\" through his well-known books in a continuous series by this title.\"\n\nFernando Corbató (1990)\n\nCorbató, who came up with the idea of using passwords for computers, received the award \"for his pioneering work organizing the concepts and leading the development of the general-purpose, large-scale, time-sharing and resource-sharing computer systems, CTSS and Multics.\"\n\nButler Lampson (1992)\n\nWhile working at Xerox PARC in 1972, Lampson envisioned the Xerox Alto. With its three-button mouse and full-page-sized monitor, it became know as the first 'personal computer.' Lampson received the award \"for contributions to the development of distributed, personal computing environments and the technology for their implementation: workstations, networks, operating systems, programming systems, displays, security and document publishing.\"\n\nEdward Feigenbaum (1994)\n\nFeigenbaum, who worked under another Turing winner, Herbert A. Simon, was a pioneer in the design and implementation of AI systems. He, along with Raj Reddy, won the award \"for design and construction of large scale artificial intelligence systems, demonstrating the practical importance and potential commercial impact of artificial intelligence technology.\"\n\nMartin Hellman (2015)\n\nHellman, who was interviewed by CBI a little more than 10 years prior to winning, received the award \"for inventing and promulgating both asymmetric public-key cryptography, including its application to digital signatures, and a practical cryptographic key-exchange method.\""
