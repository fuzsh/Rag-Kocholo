To major in STS, students work through a common core of courses drawn from the social sciences, the humanities, the natural and physical sciences and engineering. Students pursue coursework in one of seven specialized areas:\n\nCatastrophic Risks and Solutions\n\nCommunication and Media\n\nInnovation and Organization\n\nLife Sciences and Health\n\nPolitics and Policy\n\nSocial Dynamics of Data and Information\n\nSelf-Designed Concentration\n\nStudents may also undertake research in affiliated laboratories and through the honors program for course units. All students complete a capstone project, either by taking one of the senior capstone courses (STS 200) or by applying for and completing an STS honors thesis. Students are encouraged to pursue mastery in at least one field from within the humanities or social sciences and at least one field from within the sciences or engineering. Majors may declare either a B.A. or a B.S. degree (see the specific requirements for each degree).\n\nThe Program's affiliated faculty represent over a dozen departments, including Anthropology, Communication, Computer Science, Education, Electrical Engineering, History, Law, Management Science and Engineering, Political Science and Sociology. By learning to bring such a rich collection of disciplinary approaches to bear on questions of science and technology, students graduate uniquely equipped to succeed in professions that demand fluency with both technical and social frameworks. Recent graduates of STS have entered top-ranked Ph.D. and MBA programs and forged successful careers in a variety of fields, including business, engineering, law, public service, medicine and academia.\n\nAdvising and Course Selection\n\nThe Program in Science, Technology, and Society offers an advising process that includes faculty, staff and peer advisers. Prospective majors must first meet with a peer adviser and then with the Program’s Student Services Officer to determine which degree they will pursue (the B.A. or B.S.) and how they will fulfill the Program’s basic requirements. When they are ready to declare, they meet with the Program's Student Services Officer to submit their degree plan and then the Associate Director reviews the coursework for intellectual coherence. Majors are then assigned to a faculty adviser who serves as an intellectual mentor and helps them identify the core questions driving their interest in the field. The Program also sponsors a wide variety of events designed to help students meet their colleagues and Program alumni, discover research and internship opportunities, and make their way toward the career of their choice.\n\nSTS Affiliated Faculty\n\nDirector: Paul N Edwards\n\nAssociate Director: Kyoko Sato\n\nExecutive Board: Paul N Edwards (STS and CISAC), Paula Findlen (History), Mark Granovetter (Sociology), Stephen Luby (Global Health), Rob Reich (Center for Ethics in Society), Gabrielle Hecht (History), Pamela Hinds (Management Science and Engineering), Michael Lepech (Civil and Environmental Engineering), Scott Sagan (Political Science), Fred Turner (Communication)\n\nAffiliated Faculty and Staff: Jeremy Bailenson (Communication), Adam Banks (Graduate School of Education), Thomas Byers (Management Science and Engineering), Angèle Christin (Communication), Jean-Pierre Dupuy (French), Paul N.
