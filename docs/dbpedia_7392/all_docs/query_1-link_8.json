        "text": "Dr. Whitfield Diffie is the co-inventor of public key cryptography, pioneering dual-key cryptography in the early 1970s. Before writing the 1976 paper, “New Directions in Cryptography,” with Martin Hellman, encryption technology was the sole domain of government entities. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol democratized the use of cryptography and revolutionized the landscape of security in the private sector.\n\nIn 2015, Diffie became a winner of the Turing Award, widely considered the most prestigious award in computer science, for fundamental contributions to modern cryptography."
