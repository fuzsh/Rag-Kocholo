Similar to the M.S. degree, the M.Eng. degree requires the successful completion of at least 21 credits of WPI ECE graduate courses (specific course requirements for the M.S. ECE and M.S. PSE degrees are discussed below). In contrast to the M.S. degree, the M.Eng. degree allows up to 9 credits on non-ECE courses to be chosen as management courses and does not include a thesis option. Admission Requirements Master’s Program Students with a B.S. degree in electrical engineering or electrical and computer engineering may submit an application for admission to the Master’s program. There are three degree options in the Master’s program: An M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, an M.Eng. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and an M.Eng. in Power Systems Engineering. Admission to the Master’s program will be based on a review of the application and associated references. Applicants without a B.S. degree in electrical engineering or electrical and computer engineering, but who hold a B.S. degree in mathematics, computer engineering, physics or another engineering discipline, may also apply for admission to the Master’s program in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. If admitted, the applicant will be provided with required courses necessary to reach a background equivalent to the B.S. degree in electrical engineering or electrical and computer engineering, which will depend on the applicant’s specific background. Applicants with the bachelor of technology or the bachelor of engineering technology degree must typically complete about 1-1/2 years of undergraduate study in electrical engineering before they can be admitted to the graduate program. If admitted, the applicant will be provided with required courses necessary to reach a background equivalent to the B.S. degree in electrical engineering or electrical and computer engineering, which will depend on the applicant’s specific background. Ph.D. Program Students with a Master’s degree in electrical and computer engineering may apply for the doctoral program of study. Admission to the Ph.D. program will be based on a review of the application and associated references. Students with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical and computer engineering may also apply to the Ph.D. program. Students with a strong background in areas other than Electrical and Computer Engineering will also be considered for admission into the Ph.D. program. If admitted (based on review of the application and associated references), the applicant may be approved for direct admission to the Ph.D. program, or to an M.S.-Ph.D. program sequence. Applicants possessing and M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from WPI that have not been directly admitted to the Ph.D. program are still required to submit an application and associated references for consideration, with the exception of GRE scores, TOEFL scores, and the application fee. Certificate Requirements The ECE Department offers advanced certificate and graduate certificate programs. Please visit https://www.wpi.edu/academics/study/electrical-computer-engineering-certificates Degree Requirements There are three degree options within the Master’s program in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department: A Master of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering (M.Eng. ECE), a Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering (M.S. ECE), and a Master of Engineering in Power Systems Engineering (M.Eng. PSE). Program of Study Each student must submit a program of study for approval by the student’s advisor, the ECE Department Graduate Program Committee and the ECE Department Head. To ensure that the Program of Study is acceptable, students should, in consultation with their advisor, submit it to the ECE Department Graduate Secretary prior to the end of the semester following admission into the graduate program. Students must obtain prior approval from the ECE Department Graduate Program Committee for the substitution of courses in other disciplines as part of their academic program. All full-time students in the Master’s degree program (with the exception of B.S./M.S. students as noted below) are required to attend and pass the two graduate seminar courses, ECE 596A (fall semester) and ECE 596B (spring semester). See course listings for details. Thesis Option Students pursuing an M.S. ECE degree that are financially supported by the department in the form of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, or fellowship are required to complete a thesis. The thesis option is not available for students pursuing an M.Eng. ECE or M.Eng. PSE degree. M.S. thesis research involves 9 credit hours of work, registered under the designation ECE 599, normally spread over at least one academic year. For students completing the M.S. thesis as part of their degree requirements, a thesis committee will be set up during the first semester of thesis work. This committee will be selected by the student in consultation with the major advisor and will consist of the thesis advisor (who must be a full-time WPI ECE faculty member) and at least two other faculty members whose expertise will aid the student’s research program. An oral presentation before the Thesis Committee and a general audience is required. In addition, all WPI thesis regulations must be followed. Non-Thesis Option Although the thesis is optional for M.S. ECE students not financially supported by the department, and there is no thesis option available for M.Eng. ECE or M.Eng. PSE students, all M.Eng. and M.S. students are encouraged (but not required) to include a research component in their graduate program. A directed research project, registered under the designation ECE 598, provides an opportunity to conduct focused research under the direct supervision of an ECE faculty member. Credits received under the directed research designation (ECE 598) can be used to satisfy the M.Eng. ECE, M.Eng. PSE, and M.S. ECE degree requirements with a grade of C or better. Note that credit received under the thesis designation (ECE 599) may not be applied toward an M.Eng. ECE degree, M.Eng. PSE degree, or non-thesis M.S. ECE degree. Transfer Credit Students may petition to transfer a maximum of 15 graduate semester credits, with a grade of B or better, after they have enrolled in the degree program. This may be made up of a combination of up to 9 credits from the WPI ECE graduate courses taken prior to formal admission and up to 9 credits from other academic institutions. Transfer credit will not be allowed for undergraduate level courses taken at other institutions. In general, transfer credit will not be allowed for any WPI undergraduate courses used to fulfill undergraduate degree requirements; however note that there are exceptions in the case of students enrolled in the B.S./M.S. program.
