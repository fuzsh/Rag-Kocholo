As an undergraduate at Oregon State University (OSU), she characterized the fungal communities of Douglas-fir seeds from throughout the Pacific Northwest and New Zealand. She went on to work as a lab technician at OSU, characterizing the wood fungal communities of Populus trichocarpa and assisting on various projects in the greenhouse and the field. As a PhD student at UC Davis, Gillian is investigating the spatial and temporal processes involved in microbial transmission from flowers to seeds. Her long-term goal is to apply a metacommunity framework to studying seed microbial community assembly across scales, with interests in plant-pollinator-microbe interactions and consequences for young plant health. Outside of science, she enjoys riding and racing her bike, baking, traveling, and spending time with her husband and cat.\n\nShawn Christensen, PhD Candidate in the Microbiology Graduate Group\n\nEmail: smchristensen ‘at’ ucdavis ‘dot’ edu\n\nTwitter: @pollenmicrobes\n\nShawn is an evolutionary biologist turned microbiologist, broadly interested in microbial interactions/symbioses with plant-pollinator systems, weird evolutionary traits, and crosswords. They obtained a BS from University of Wisconsin-Madison in Evolutionary Biology, where they did research on reducing ecological impacts of phosphorus runoff, ethnobotany and domestication traits in Brassica rapa, botanical field excursions of all kinds, and the evolution of chemical sets in the early origins of life. In the Vannette lab, Shawn is currently studying nectar-dwelling Acinetobacter and other nectar microbes and their potential influences on pollen for nutrient procurement, as well as the metabolomics of solitary bee pollen provisions.\n\nLexie Martin, PhD Candidate in the Entomology Graduate group\n\nEmail: lexmartin ‘at’ ucdavis ‘dot’ edu\n\nWebsite: https://entomolexie.wordpress.com/\n\nLexie is an entomology PhD candidate interested in the impact of microbes on bee health. She received a BS in Biology (focus evolution, ecology, and behavior) and a BSA in Chemistry from the University of Texas at Austin. As an undergraduate, she investigated the spatial distribution of bacteria within the guts of bumblebees and the gut microbiota of the Mexican honey wasp. In the Vannette Lab, she studies how microbes acquired socially and environmentally affect the health of bumblebees and blue orchard bees.\n\nDanielle Rutkowski, PhD Candidate in the Entomology Graduate Group\n\nEmail: dmrutkowski ‘at’ ucdavis ‘dot’ edu\n\nCo-advised with Rick Karban\n\nDanielle is an entomology PhD student interested in the relationships between bees and microbes. She completed her bachelor’s degree at Cornell University, where she studied how the relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and their host plants impacts insect herbivores. At UC Davis, she studies how bumble bees interact with the microbes, particularly fungi, in their environment, and how these relationships impact bee health.\n\nDino Sbardellati, PhD Student in the Microbiology Graduate Group\n\nemail: dlsbardellati ‘at’ ucdavis ‘dot’ edu\n\nDino is a microbiologist interested in understanding how microbial ecology shapes macroscale ecology. He received a BA in biology from Sonoma State University and an MS in Bacteriology from the University of Wisconsin Madison. Dino has worked on projects exploring how reintroduced Tule elk modulate terrestrial arthropod populations, how antibiotic treatment impacts gut microbial communities in Passalid beetles, and how diet effects bovine rumen microbial communities. In the Vannette lab, Dino’s work deals with studying the bacteriophage (viruses which target bacteria) communities associated with the bumble bee gut and how phages shape gut microbial communities. In his spare time Dino enjoys catching, pinning, and drawing insects, cooking pizza, and making art.\n\nPost-Baccalaureate\n\nLeta Landucci, Jr. Specialist\n\nLeta is a biochemist inspired by chemical ecology, broadly interested in exploring chemically mediated plant-insect-microbe interactions. Leta obtained a BS from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Biochemistry, where she studied poplar acyltransferase enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the crucial plant polymer, suberin. She also did research on the dynamic between physical and chemical plant traits and Japanese beetle herbivore behavior. As a member of the Vannette lab, Leta is studying how the production of peroxides secreted by nectarin proteins in floral nectar shapes microbial growth in nectar. She also aims to understand how this chemistry varies across plant species and influences pollinator-plant-microbe interactions. Leta was a NSF Postbaccalaureate Research Trainee in the lab from Sept 2022-Sept 2023.\n\nUndergraduates in the lab\n\nHelen Noroian: Helen is working with Lexie and Rachel on projects related to bee-microbe interactions and microbial community assembly in nectar.\n\nAmy Hazemoto: Amy is working with Danielle on projects related to bee-microbial interactions and fungicide effects on bee-associated yeasts.\n\nLab photos:\n\nJuly 2024 Lab Retreat at Point Reyes (partial group with a few extras!)\n\nPartial lab group, summer 2018\n\n(L to R: Allie Igwe, Ash Zemenick, Robert Schaeffer, Rachel Vannette, Honey Pathak and Imade Ojo)\n\nLab photo, Summer 2016\n\n(L to R: Tim Rei, Chela Owens, Rachel Vannette, Ariana Nagainis, Megan Morris, Griffin Hall and Allie Igwe)\n\nYoungest (honorary) lab members:\n\nSterling Vannette (2013-present) and Corwin Vannette (2017-present)\n\nPrevious affiliates\n\nStaff Research Associate\n\nJacob Cecala, Staff Research Associate and Postdoc 2021-2024\n\nJake Cecala is a community ecologist interested in wild, native bee species and their interactions with cultivated plants in urban and agricultural areas. For his doctoral work, he investigated how commercial plant nurseries in California function as habitats for wild bees. As a member of the Vannette lab, Jake studied how insecticides and drought interact to affect floral microbial communities and crop pollination. He is currently an ORISE Postdoctoral Fellow in Urban Forestry.
