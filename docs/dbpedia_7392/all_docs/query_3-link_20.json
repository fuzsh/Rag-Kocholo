        "text": "These days all your devices are encrypted. Apple boasts about their secure systems, most companies have encrypted servers, even your own laptop probably has some level on encryption going on. However, all of these systems are subject to fault. Of course, this all depends on the type of encryption you’re using. While many agree that the standard is and should be AES, there are a lot of other encryption protocols out there, some of which are still in use today. One of the other main algorithms still circulating the globe is the RSA algorithm. In order to understand why, we have to go back to before its time, to the beginnings of modern cryptography.\n\nIn the beginning, there were two…\n\nKnown mostly within the American cryptologist worlds, Martin Hellman was the more academic of the two. After having received a Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1969, he joined the teaching staff in the electrical engineering department, where he still teaches today."
