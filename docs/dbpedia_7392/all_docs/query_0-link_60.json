        "text": "I am honored and proud to join IBM Quantum Safe (https://lnkd.in/gW-vX4rg ) leadership team as the Head of Product Management and Go-To-Market Strategy. IBM has been pioneering cryptography innovations since 63 years (https://lnkd.in/gAnSkSCU )- establishing a cryptography research group in 1960 at TJ Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, NY who developed a cryptographic algorithm that was adopted by National Bureau of Standards in 1977 as the first ever Data Encryption Standard (DES) for computer security for both civilians and the US government. IBM inventions continued throughout the last eight decades with key contributions as Hash-based Message Authentication (HMAC) – a gold standard for data authentication in the Internet; design of Internet Key Exchange (IKE) standard – a critical piece of Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) and Virtual Private Network (VPN); development of lattice-based cryptosystems; a Common Cryptography Architecture (CCA) and secure encryption schemes; a breakthrough invention of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). For Quantum Safe Cryptography or Post Quantum Cryptography, in 2016 contenders from all over the world submitted 69 cryptographic schemes for potential standardization. NIST later narrowed down the list of candidates over three stages, eventually shortlisting seven finalists — four for public key encryption and three for digital signatures. At the end of a six-year-long process, three of the four chosen standards were developed by the security research team (https://lnkd.in/gkMfRM_A ) at IBM’s lab in Zurich, Switzerland, in collaboration with a number of industry and academic partners. Last week, it has been truly inspiring to meet with IBM’s cryptography talent, and deeply understanding about IBM’s recent cryptography technology and innovations. I am absolutely convinced that IBM is the invincible market leader in this space and leading the way for the most comprehensive quantum safe cryptography solution in an agile manner. I am really excited and looking forward to drive the business strategy and go-to-market execution of these technology and innovation to help our clients and partners throughout their journey to be quantum safe and secure. #cryptography #technology #innovation #leadership #ibm #ibm-quantum-safe #ibm-quantum #quantumcomputing #quantum-safe #quantumsecurity #post-quantum-cryptography #pqc #nist #ibmresearch #ibmsecurity #cybersecurity #productmanagement #agile #strategy #isaca #isc2 #eccouncil #ciso #cio #cdo #cto Alessandro Curioni Jay Gambetta Scott Crowder Ray Harishankar Mary O'Brien Chris McCurdy Sridhar Muppidi J.R.
