        "text": "Larissa Avilés-Santa, MD, MPH\n\nDirector, Division of Clinical and Health Services Research at the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities\n\nNIMHD\n\nDr. Avilés-Santa distinctly remembers falling in love with the human body when she browsed her fifth grade atlas de anatomía humana and immediately realizing that she wanted to become a physician. This fascination and curiosity about the human body and medicine were further nurtured by accompanying her paternal grandmother to medical appointments at the Puerto Rico Medical Center, where the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine is located. Years later, she would study at that school of medicine.\n\nHer interest in endocrinology started during her undergraduate studies, and was intensified during her residency, while taking care of a young patient with a severe endocrine condition due to an underlying intractable malignancy. Through the study of her patient’s condition, she discovered the value and need for clinical research, and pursued an endocrinology fellowship in Texas. The high prevalence of diabetes among Hispanics/Latinos led her through a different clinical research path, and equipped her to join the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) in 2006 as the project officer for the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.\n\nDr. Avilés-Santa has participated in various NIH-wide committees and working groups addressing minority health, diabetes mellitus and its complications, cardiovascular health, chronic diseases, women’s health, and vascular dementia. In 2015, she founded the NIH Hispanic Health Research Scientific Interest Group.\n\nIn 2017, Dr. Avilés-Santa was the field coordinator of the post-Hurricanes Irma and María recovery of the health and social services of the entire territory of Puerto Rico during the first six and a half months of work coordinated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In this capacity, she led a diverse group of volunteer federal employees and local contractors in the performance of needs assessments of health care and social services facilities in collaboration with local key partners. Additionally, she directed the proposal of multiple recovery strategies.\n\nWorking in the recovery of health care facilities and systems in Puerto Rico, inspired her to promote research in this field. In 2019, she joined the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) as the director of the Division of Clinical and Health Services Research. In this capacity, she has led and/or supported her team in the development of multiple initiatives related to clinical care, health services, health care models, and health care systems research within the context of health and health care disparities. She is working on a recently approved concept on Latin America: Synergizing Health Research Across the Hemisphere, as well as an upcoming parallel workshop.\n\nShe looks forward to the opportunity offered in the NIH Executive Leadership Program to strengthen skills and improve effectiveness as a leader, and develop new and meaningful relationships with colleagues across the NIH and beyond.\n\nDorothy Beckett, PhD\n\nDivision Director, Division of Biophysics, Biomedical Technology, and Computational Biosciences (BBCB)\n\nNational Institute of General Medical Sciences\n\nDorothy Beckett, Ph.D., is director of the NIGMS Division of Biophysics, Biomedical Technology, and Computational Biosciences. The division support quantitative research spanning the full range of biological organization from the molecular to the population level and supports technology development and resources to facilitate advances in basic biomedical research.\n\nPrior to assuming the BBCB directorship, Beckett was a faculty member in the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department at the University of Maryland, College Park, where, in addition to teaching, she directed a research program that focused on the basic biophysical chemistry of protein function and its significance for biological regulation. Her multidisciplinary research program employed a range of techniques including solution thermodynamic and kinetic measurements, structural biology, and computation. Beckett, who has long record of service to the biophysics community, was president of the Biophysical Society from 2014 to 2015.\n\nBeckett earned an A.B. in chemistry from Barnard College at Columbia University, and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She performed postdoctoral research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLiza Q. Bundesen, PhD\n\nDeputy Director, Office of Extramural Research\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nDr. Liza Bundesen is Deputy Director of the Office of Extramural Research (OER) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In OER, Liza works on a variety of issues, such as developing and implementing policies and procedures related to the funding and oversight of NIH grants; working on efforts to protect the integrity of NIH-funded research, which includes addressing harassment and discrimination in extramural research settings; and communicating the value of NIH-supported research to NIH’s wide range of stakeholders. Prior to her current role, Liza was a senior advisor in OER and Chief of the Science Policy and Evaluation Branch at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). At NIMH, she oversaw policy and planning activities for the institute, including Congressional reporting, strategic planning, and program evaluation. Liza joined NIMH as an American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Science and Technology Policy Fellow. Before coming to NIH, she was a Science and Technology Policy Fellow at the National Academies, where she worked at the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Liza received her Ph.D. in neuroscience from Georgetown University and her B.S. in molecular biology from Lehigh University.\n\nBeth Chandler, ESQ\n\nDeputy Director, Office of Human Resources\n\nNIH\n\nBeth Ilana Chandler Esq. has over 27 years of experience in the Human Resource field. Currently she serves as the Deputy Director of the Office of Human Resources (OHR) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Prior to this position, Ms. Chandler was the Director of NIH OHR’s Workforce Relations Division. In that role, she managed numerous NIH-wide programs including employee and labor relations, performance management, employee benefits and retirement, leave administration, workers’ compensation, and processing and payroll functions.\n\nShe began her government career in 1995 as a law intern for the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), an independent agency of the United States government that governs labor relations between the federal government and its employees. After graduation in 1997 Beth became a Field Attorney with the FLRA's Washington Regional Office of the Office of General Counsel, litigating Unfair Labor Practices and Representation Cases.\n\nShe joined the NIH community in November 2005 as an Employee and Labor Relations Specialist\n\nin the Workforce Relations Division. In 2009, she became a Team Leader in the Employee\n\nRelations and Labor Relations (ERLR) Branch in WRD. She then became Deputy Director of WRD\n\nin August 2012, Acting Director of WRD in September 2015, and Director in April 2016.\n\nMs. Chandler holds a J.D from American University and a Bachelor of Science Degree from Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nAlice Chen, MD\n\nSenior Scientific Officer\n\nNational Cancer Institute\n\nDr. Chen directs the Developmental Therapeutics Clinic (DTC) in the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis at the National Cancer Institute since 2014.

Within human cells, the genetic information encoded within the chromosomes is sequestered to the cell nucleus, so that its expression is controlled by communication between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, where other cellular components reside. This communication occurs through conduits called nuclear pores. Dr. Dasso’s recent studies focus on the roles of nuclear pores in chromosome organization and gene expression. These studies also concern the essential role of nuclear pore proteins during mitosis, when the separation of the nucleus and cytoplasm breaks down and chromosomes are segregated as the cell divides into two daughter cells. Importantly, mutations in components of the nuclear pore have been implicated in a number of diseases, including nephrotic syndromes and neurodegenerative diseases, so Dr. Dasso’s work ultimately aims to address how these diseases arise from nuclear pore disfunction.\n\nBeyond the studies within her group, Dr. Dasso is the Associate Scientific Director (ASD) for budget and Administration within the NICHD Division of Intramural Research (DIR). Her focus as an ASD is to increase the transparency and efficiency of scientific administration within the DIR, in order to advance the scientific mission of the NICHD.\n\nKendrick T.
