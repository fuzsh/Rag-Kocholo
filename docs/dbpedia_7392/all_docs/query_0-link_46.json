        "text": "After spending 20 years as a leader in the energy industry, I was blessed with the opportunity to become the president of a high school for students of limited economic resources in Houston, Texas. That experience fundamentally changed the way I view the world. It deepened my appreciation for the delicate relationship between human potential and life circumstances and opened my eyes to the challenges and opportunities we face as a society.\n\nI believe in the dignity of work and that labor is a part of God’s plan for our lives. Unfortunately, with growing education and income inequality in the United States, finding a living wage job will become more challenging for the low income population. Fortunately, we have millions of Americans who are rising above their socioeconomic challenges and are often the first in their family to attend college. These first generation students bring grit, determination, and a set of life experiences that would add significant value to our labor market, but they often lack the social capital and information necessary to find meaningful employment. As a result, millions of first generation graduates are under-employed despite their education and massive potential. At the same time, the demographics of our labor market are evolving rapidly, and employers will need to find ways to attract high quality candidates with diverse backgrounds.\n\nThe combination of these factors creates an incredible opportunity to facilitate the movement of underemployed Americans into jobs that maximize their potential, and importantly, provide the dignity of meaningful work. To seize this opportunity, we have developed an efficient and scalable model to connect hundreds of thousands of young Americans with information and social capital that facilitates their career readiness and unlocks their employment potential. Our model also assists employers to reach their goals for diverse talent recruitment within a dynamic labor market. When we look forward, we see an America that optimizes the God given potential of every first generation student. Welcome to CareerSpring."
