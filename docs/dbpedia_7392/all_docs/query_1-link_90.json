        "text": "50th Anniversary Celebration\n\nOn October 7, 2023 we celebrated the 50th year of the Department since its inception. To recognize that milestone, we hosted a series of events that culminated with a party at the Samuel Riggs IV Alumni Center on campus.\n\nAn Opportunity to Make an Impact\n\nTo celebrate our 50th anniversary in a meaningful way, we need your help in establishing a new, general endowment fund. Thanks to the following students, alumni, parents, faculty and friends who have already contributed, we have raised over $100,000 to match a lead gift by William \"Bill\" Smith, BS ‘81 for the establishment of the William Smith Endowed Program Support Fund in Geology - in celebration of the Department’s 50th Anniversary. We continue to raise funds as part of this effort. If you feel that the Department has helped shape your career and improved the quality of your life, please consider giving back by donating to this fund. Thank you!\n\nGuillermo M. Accame\n\nMichael and Jennifer Brown\n\nKang Chen\n\nJames Farquhar\n\nChao Gao\n\nRobert M.
