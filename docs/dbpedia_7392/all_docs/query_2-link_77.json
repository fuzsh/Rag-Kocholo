        "text": "The Princess Grace Foundation today announced that 18 people will be awarded Princess Grace Awards, and 11 will be feted as honoraria recipients.\n\nThe Princess Grace Foundation-USA is dedicated to honoring the legacy of Princess Grace of Monaco, neé Grace Kelly, known for her commitment to advancing the arts in the United States. The award supports and elevates extraordinary emerging artists in theater, dance and film through career-advancing grants and nurtures and supports Princess Grace Award winners throughout their careers.\n\nAs part of the Princess Grace Foundation’s 40th-anniversary celebration of emerging artists in theater, dance and film, recipients have been categorized into one of four award programs: The Princess Grace Award, Special Project Grant, Grace Kelly Scholarship and the re-introduction of the Princess Grace Statue Award.\n\nThis year’s Princess Grace Award winners join the community of over 900 artists who have received exclusive grants, career development and networking opportunities.\n\n“I am delighted to announce the 2024 Princess Grace Award winners and Honoraria recipients. As we celebrate 40 years of unparalleled grantmaking and a steadfast commitment to extraordinary artistry, I thank our esteemed artistic luminaries who serve as Arts Advisory Council members and panelists,” Diana Kemppainen, president of the Princess Grace Foundation, said in a statement. “Their discerning judgment and dedication have been instrumental in selecting this distinguished cohort of artists in theater, dance and film. We eagerly anticipate the contributions these artists will make to the cultural landscape.”\n\nFor the first time since 2019, the Princess Grace Foundation will also award the Princess Grace Statue Award. Given to previous Princess Grace Award winners who have distinguished themselves in their artistic disciplines, the Statue Award comes with a $25,000 unrestricted cash grant.\n\nThis year’s recipients are playwright and Pulitzer Prize finalist Branden Jacobs-Jenkins and theater and film director Lila Neugebauer, whose most recent collaboration, “Appropriate,” won the best revival of a play at the 77th Annual Tony Awards.\n\nThe honorees will be feted at the Princess Grace Awards Gala, which will be held on Oct. 23 at the Pierre Hotel in New York, New York.\n\nSee the complete list of winners below:\n\n2024 Princess Grace Award Winners and Honoraria:\n\nTheater and Playwriting:\n\nDahlak Brathwaite, nominated by Princess Grace Award winner Zoe Scofield (Choreography 2011), Gant Gaither Theater Honor\n\nDesiré Graham, nominated by Double Edge Theatre, Robert and Gloria Hausman Theater Honor\n\nLauren Holmes, New Dramatists Playwriting Fellowship\n\nSamora la Perdida, nominated by Princess Grace Award winner David Mendizábal (Theater 2021), John Gore Theater Honor\n\nMary Prescott, nominated by Harlem Stage, Grace Le Vine Theater Honor\n\nAlexis Kulani Woodard, nominated by David Geffen School of Drama at Yale\n\nTheater Honoraria:\n\nSim Carpenter, nominated by NYU Tisch School of the Arts- Chih-Jou Cheng, nominated by Links Hall\n\nJosiah Davis, nominated by National Black Theatre\n\nEvan Silver aka Tiresias, nominated by The Cell Theatre\n\nDance Performance and Choreography:\n\nEric Best, nominated by Houston Ballet, Chris Hellman Dance Honor\n\nMJ Edwards, nominated by Limón Dance Company\n\nAmari Frazier, nominated by Princess Grace Award winner Kyle Abraham (Choreography 2010)\n\nRoderick George, nominated by Princess Grace Award winner Chanel DaSilva (Dance 2011)\n\nBarkha Patel, nominated by Harlem Stage\n\nLeonardo Sandoval, nominated by Works & Process at the Guggenheim\n\nDance Performance and Choreography Honoraria:\n\nMiriam Gittens, nominated by Princess Grace Award winner Elisa Clark (Dance 2008)\n\nJake Roxander, nominated by American Ballet Theatre\n\nEmara Vonae’ Neymour Jackson, nominated by Owen/Cox Dance Group\n\nFilm & Animation:\n\nIfeyinwa Arinze, nominated by Princess Grace Award winner Pepi Ginsberg (Film 2021), Wendy Ferguson Film Honor\n\nNicole Chi, nominated by the University of Texas at Austin, John H.
