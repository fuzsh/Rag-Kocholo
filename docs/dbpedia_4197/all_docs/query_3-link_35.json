        "text": "August 3, 2018 (Los Angeles, CA) – Award-winning band, the John Butler Trio will release their forthcoming studio album HOME on September 28 via Nettwerk Records.\n\nWhile continuing to create as a trio, this album was largely recorded and produced in a more solo format with long-time friend and producer Jan Skubiszewski and reflects the deeply personal, critical yet redemptive nature of the inner and outer worlds Butler was experiencing and observing during this latest chapter of his life.\n\n“I’ve been dealing with anxiety on and off for ages. I hadn’t always been able to name it. It was in this fractured state that I started trying to wrangle this new mob of songs – wild horses I’d met over the last four years. Songs about family life, love, what it means to be a modern man and personal insights into dealing with my anxious projections. Songs have always been my friends. No matter what I’m going through they help me convey the things my heart feels but my brain is too afraid to say. But grappling with this herd in this state would prove uniquely tricky. As things turned out that journey would actually be critical in helping me deal with my shit. In the meantime though, I was lost and somehow I had to find my way home. There was no choice. Like that classic children’s book, ‘We’re Going On A Bear Hunt’ says; “Can’t go under it. Can’t go over it. Can’t go around it. MUST go through it,” says Butler.\n\n“Throughout the years that it took to make this album, there were tears and frustration, confusion and chaos. But there was also family and friends, honesty and vulnerability, gardens and harvest, service and surrender. And in amongst it all, ultimately, there was joy,” says Butler. Adding, “It turns out that breakdowns can lead to breakthroughs if you’re willing to get under the hood and get your hands dirty.”\n\nWhile exploring this inner world, Butler also traverses new sonic territory to combine his love of electronic and hip-hop production with folk and country instrumentation and songwriting traditions that have always inspired him. Partnering with Billboard [HYPERLINK] to premiere, title track “Home” represents a genuine creative leap. “Home” (out today) captures the emotional and sonic landscape that would become the bedrock of this album – a complex mesh of poignant lyrics, industrial rhythms and a grinding electronic soul. Dark and brooding, yet at the same time offering hope, this first musical taste pushes the envelope, digs deeper and explores the frustrations, vulnerabilities and tensions of modern life.\n\nWatch (& Share) The Lyric Video For “Home” Here: https://youtu.be/9zhrpfEHvSE\n\nThe John Butler Trio is guitarist/vocalist John Butler, bassist Byron Luiters and percussionist Grant Gerathy.\n\nTour Dates:\n\n**Tickets on sale Friday 8/10 at 10am local (Oakland, CA on sale on Friday 8/17 at 10am local)\n\nFriday, 11/16 Washington DC @ Warner Theatre\n\nSaturday, 11/17 Philadelphia, PA @ The Fillmore\n\nTuesday, 11/20 New York, NY @ The Beacon Theatre\n\nWednesday, 11/21 Boston, MA @ Orpheum Theatre\n\nFriday, 11/23 Montreal, QC @ Corona Theatre\n\nSaturday, 11/24 Ottawa, ON @ National Arts Centre\n\nSunday, 11/25 Toronto, ON @ Danforth Music Hall\n\nTuesday, 11/27 Ann Arbor, MI @ Michigan Theater\n\nThursday, 11/29 Chicago, IL @ Chicago Theatre\n\nFriday, 11/30 Cincinnati, OH @ Taft Theatre\n\nSaturday, 12/1 Pelham, TN @ The Caverns\n\nSunday, 12/2 Atlanta, GA @ The Tabernacle\n\nTuesday, 12/4 Mobile, AL @ Soul Kitchen\n\nWednesday, 12/5 New Orleans, LA @ The Joy Theater\n\nFriday, 12/7 Austin, TX @ Paramount Theatre\n\nSaturday, 12/8 Houston, TX @ House of Blues\n\nSunday, 12/9 Dallas, TX @ House of Blues\n\nThursday, 12/13 Tucson, AZ @ Rialto Theatre\n\nFriday, 12/14 Los Angeles, CA @ The Theater at Ace Hotel\n\nSaturday, 12/15 Oakland, CA @ Fox Theater\n\nTrack List:\n\nTahitian Blue\n\nWade in the Water\n\nJust Call\n\nRunning Away\n\nHome\n\nMiss Your Love\n\nFaith\n\nCoffee, Methadone & Cigarettes\n\nTell Me Why\n\nBrown Eyed Bird\n\nYou Don’t Have to Be Angry Anymore\n\nWe Want More\n\nPre-order the album here: smarturl.it/JBTHome\n\nAbout John Butler Trio:\n\nCentered around John Butler’s virtuoso guitar stylings and powerful, progressive lyricism, the band draws upon a remarkable variety of musical genres, spanning folk, blues, funk, classic rock ‘n’ roll, and beyond.
