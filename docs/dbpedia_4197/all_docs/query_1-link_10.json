        "text": "Last Dinosaurs gained huge attention in 2012 with the release of the critically acclaimed first album ‘In A Million Years’ that debuted at No.8 on the Australian ARIA chart. The success of the album had them selling out shows across Australia as well as huge headlining tours and festival plays across the UK and Europe, SE Asia and South Africa. The band continued to win hearts in 2015 with ‘Wellness’ and then again with the much-heralded third album, ‘Yumeno Garden’. The first two singles ‘Dominos’ and ‘Eleven’ went straight to high rotation on Triple J, while the album tour sold out multiple venues in each city across Australia. In December 2018, Last Dinosaurs announced their first ever US tour, with the first round of shows in LA, Chicago and LA selling out in under a minute, the tour quickly expanded into 17 sold out shows around the States. Last Dinosaurs went on to do two sold out tours of the USA and Canada including a 21 date headline tour featuring iconic venues such as Webster Hall, Fonda Theatre, and The Fillmore. The band then went on to the UK & EU, selling out the tour through Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, and two nights in London and then to a hugely successful run through SE Asia.Last Dinosaurs have also supported international acts such as Foals, Matt & Kim, Lost Valentinos and Foster the People and played festivals including Splendour In The Grass, Laneway, Falls Festival and Field Day to name a few.In 2020/21, under the constraints of Covid and unable to tour, the band retreated to studios in Mexico and Australia, to write and record yet to be announced fourth studio album due for release later in 2022. Off the back of this album, Last Dinosaurs signed a global, multi-album record deal with world renowned label, Nettwerk. International touring planned for '22 includes a headline UK & EU tour in May, a 21 show headline tour in the US / Canada in June + Mexico, SE Asia and South America all in and around a multi-single and album release campaign with their new record label."
