        "text": "Boxed In - All Your Love Is Gone (Michael Rother Remix) by Nettwerk Music Group\n\npublished on 2015-01-16T19:05:03Z\n\nBoxed In's self title album is available on iTunes http://smarturl.it/boxedin?IQid=sc.aylisgset Oli Baystonâs UK project Boxed In plays a unique combination of krautrock, post-punk, and house. Theyâll release their self-titled debut album next week, and today theyâre sharing an exhilarating remix of one of the albumâs best songs. âAll Your Love Is Goneâ is one of those motorik rave-ups that just keeps building intensity, and Michael Rother has given it a makeover that maintains the brisk urgency while significantly changing its sound. The original was dominated by a propulsive bass line, but Rotherâs remix is all about that treble, shifting the focus to percolating keyboard sounds that trigger positive memories of LCD Soundsystemâs âAll My Friends.â\n\nGenre\n\nElectronic\n\nContains tracks\n\nBoxed In - All Your Love Is Gone (Michael Rother Remix) by Nettwerk Music Group\n\npublished on 2014-12-11T20:21:32Z"
