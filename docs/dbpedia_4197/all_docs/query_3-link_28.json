        "text": "Mree began writing her own songs at the age of 14 and released her debut album Grow at age 18; the album debuted at #18 on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart. Mree’s music has been featured in numerous national TV shows including Grey’s Anatomy, Bones, Beauty and the Beast and major ad campaigns such as Target. Her music has drawn the attention of music industry professionals including Grammy Award winning artist Bon Iver (Justin Vernon), who has shared several of her music videos with his fans and followers. Her brand of “folktronica” draws on her influences of Bon Iver, Sigur Ros and Jonsi creating a musical bed of acoustic and electronic elements for her angelic voice to float effortlessly above.\n\nBorn and raised in New Jersey (currently living in Portland), Mree honed her craft while attending the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at NYU. During that time, she performed regularly in NYC at venues such as Rockwood Music Hall, Webster Hall and the Highline Ballroom both as a featured and opening act for national touring artists such as Priscilla Ahn, Nina Nesbitt, and Ron Pope to name a few."
