        "text": "Guster has announced their new album Look Alive, out January 18, 2019, on Nettwerk/Ocho Mule. The 9-song collection – the band’s first new album in four years – was produced by Leo Abrahams (Regina Spektor, Brian Eno/David Byrne, Belle and Sebastian) and recorded in a vintage keyboard museum in Calgary, AB, with additional sessions helmed by John Congleton (St. Vincent, Alvvays) and Collin DuPuis (Angel Olsen, Lana Del Rey). It captures the group – Adam Gardner, Ryan Miller, Luke Reynolds, and Brian Rosenworcel – at an inspired moment, creating the most layered, moody and brilliantly unpredictable music of their storied career.\n\nTo accompany the announcement, the band has released title track “Look Alive,” which NPR Music dubbed “one of Guster's most musically sparkling pop songs,” calling the track, “moody and warm,” saying it “slithers with colorful, sinewy synths.”\n\nGuster has announced their new album Look Alive, out January 18, 2019, on Nettwerk/Ocho Mule.
