        "text": "Harmless - I'm Sure LP (10th anniversary)\n\nIn stock\n\n•••••\n\nHarmless is a colorful mix of emotions woven seamlessly with bright electronic synths, smooth vocals, and the occasional playful saxophone. Bedroom recording to the max\n\nGeographer - Down and Out in the Garden of Earthly Delights 2LP (180g color vinyl)\n\nIn stock\n\n•••••\n\nDown and Out's creative strength is partially evident through its sheer volume.

This collection of 9 tracks encapsulates the core aspects of Tate’s distinctive songwriting and vocal artistry.\n\nVacations - No Place Like Home LP (green vinyl)\n\nIn stock\n\n•••••\n\nThe new project follows an intense period of transformation for Campbell, who was forced to cancel all touring commitments due to COVID restrictions and subsequently came down with a severe bout of writer's block.\n\nSkinny Puppy - Mind: The Perpetual Intercourse LP\n\nIn stock\n\n•••••\n\nFamous for both its pornographic album photo (the political backlash resulted in the Parental Advisory Label) and for inspiring the next generation of Industrial Music contemporaries (Nine Inch Nails) with tracks like “Dig It” and “Stairs and Flowers”.\n\nFrances, Neil - There is no Neil Frances LP (180g clear vinyl)\n\nIn stock\n\n•••••\n\nThere is no Neil Frances.

An alluring, dynamic and diverse company, the 'Roses' vocalists were hand picked by the band to feature on the new album\n\nFolick, Miya - Roach LP\n\nIn stock\n\n•••••\n\nRoach is Miya Folick's clearest and most direct work yet. With ear-worm melodies, heart-wrenching poetry, eclectic production and anchored by Folick's once-in-a-lifetime voice, Roach straddles a line between pop and something more experimental.\n\nBayonne - Temporary Time LP (electric blue vinyl)\n\nIn stock\n\n•••••\n\nElectric Blue Vinyl. Deeply informed by a deliberate transformation of his musical process, Bayonne's third full-length Temporary Time ultimately makes for his most expansive work to date-an album of both painfully raw introspection and otherworldly beaut\n\nSt. Lucia - Utopia 2LP (180g yellow/blue vinyl)\n\nIn stock\n\n•••••\n\nLed by husband-and-wife duo n Jean-Philip Grobler and Patti Beranek, the group retreat from a fractured world on fire and into the glow of a rapturous synth-spiked electro-pop catharsis-akin to a dance party at the edge of existence."
