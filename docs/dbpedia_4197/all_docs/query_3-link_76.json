        "text": "Forming in 2015 during a spontaneous trip up to New Zealand’s west coast, LEISURE quickly gained attention with their self-titled debut album. Released in 2016, LEISURE peaked at #2 in the NZ charts and received worldwide critical acclaim. The album also included a notable collaboration, ‘Nobody’, with US rapper GoldLink.\n\nA twelve-track release, 'Sunsetter' will become LEISURE’s third studio album, following on from 2019’s 'Twister' and their 2016 eponymous debut LP. 'Sunsetter' will feature previous singles 'Slipping Away', 'Take You Higher' and 'Flipside', concluding their string of EP releases ‘Side A’ and ‘Side B’.\n\nCompleting the album are two new tracks not originally included in the EP series, the silky 'Dipping and Diving', and bass driven 'Be With You'.\n\n'Sunsetter', the full album fittingly concludes its beginnings of Side A’s new light. An album centred around home, underpinned as always by their genuine friendship and democratic writing process, it follows the journey of their past couple of years, one in which they have started families, become closer friends and refocused on what is important. As the sun sets there is plenty more on the horizon. After all, life in the slow lane has legs -as this band proves. They’re going the distance, at their own pace, in their own way.\n\nThis preceded 2019 sophomore album 'Twister', and a successful European tour soon followed, which included sold-out dates in London and Berlin alongside a debut double performance at Brighton festival The Great Escape. Sunsetter, LEISURE’s 3rd studio album will be out 3rd December, 2021 via Nettwerk."
