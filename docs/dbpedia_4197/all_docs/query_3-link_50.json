        "text": "...\". Kinda funny to hear actually.\n\nFumbling Towards Ecstasy (Live) Promo Only / ASCD-2723 (Arista)\n\nA special in-store play sampler that is very rare. Contains four songs from the April 94 Pay Per View special shown in Canada: Good Enough, a cool, bluesy version of Elsewhere, an orgasmic version of Ice Cream (if you have seen the FTE tour, you know wh at I mean :), and Mary.

Everything was and is subject to her interpretation. She has tried to be as unbiased and unopinionated as possible, but hey, that's to ugh to do sometimes.\n\nBen's song\n\nDirected by: Sarah McLachlan, David Kershaw, John Hautman\n\nYear released: 1989\n\nBlack and white.\n\nDescription: In this video Sarah is playing the piano in a large, white room (then again the video is in black and white so the room can actually be a light pink. I'm not quite sure.) and Dave Kershaw is playing a bass.\n\nVox (Canadian Version)\n\nDirected by: Mark Jowett and Dermot Shane\n\nYear released: 1988\n\nColour. Description: Unlike her other videos in a few ways, perhaps stylistically the most, this light-hearted video has Sarah (with short hair) singing \"Vox\" while falling water and flowers are superimposed over her. CUT TO: Sarah on top of a rock and at the end she throws flowers into the water.\n\nVox (American Version)\n\nDirected by: Michelle Mahrer\n\nYear released: 1989\n\nBlack and white.\n\nDescription: Imagine, Sarah singing and playing guitar in a long black dress in the middle of the desert. It's hot, she cools off by getting wet.\n\nSteaming\n\nDirected by: David Hauka\n\nYear released: 1989\n\nColour.\n\nDescription: A torch singer in a cabaret night club, Sarah sings while the club's patrons get to know each other. Enter the femme fatale and some of the female patrons begin to get jealous. Like the song title says, things start steami ng. Dave Kershaw as the bartender.\n\nPath Of Thorns (Terms)\n\nDirected by: Philip Cates\n\nYear released: 1991\n\nColour.\n\nDescription: Two dancers, a man and a woman, perform a tormented pas-de-deux, intercut with Sarah singing naked in the shadows. Simple and stark, the video's blue tone accentuates the song's mood. When this video was first aired it gener ated quite a bit of controversy, but I have to agree with Sarah in saying that her nude appearance in the video is \"a very quiet and honest way to be.\"\n\nInto The Fire\n\nDirected by: Philip Cates\n\nYear Released: 1991\n\nColour.\n\nDescription: Running along the theme of birth and rebirth, Sarah sings naked in the mud (UBC mud, might I add). In the video Sarah also runs through the forest in a flowery, summer dress, and gets washed up in a waterfall. Blue and orange tones. In a M uchMusic interview Sarah mentions that shooting this video was not that great for her skin, as it would appear to be. The mud was taken from the roadside at the University of British Columbia and was filled with gravel and rocks. On the more positive si de, this video was nominated for a Juno. There's two versions of this video (I'm guessing American and Canadian versions). The pix are the same but the accompanying soundtracks differ. One is the album version (Canadian) and the other, the John Fryer mi x (American version).\n\nDrawn To The Rhythm\n\nDirected by: Sarah McLachlan\n\nYear released: 1992\n\nBlack and White.\n\nDescription: A group of children go to the beach to play, sing and party by a big bonfire. One boy goes off on his own and encounters a darker side of the idyllic ocean. Great cinematography and the images are fantastic.\n\nPossession (Canadian Version)\n\nDirected by: Sarah McLachlan\n\nYear released: 1993\n\nColour.\n\nDescription: Female archetypes. Sarah hangs on to a limp man, Sarah wrapped in gauze, swings on a pendulum. The video is full of biblical and mythical imagery. Once again wonderful cinematography. Makes you wonder why Sarah doesn't di rect more of her own videos. Some of Sarah's friends are in the video. Look out for Ash Sood as Adam and Brian Minato as well. The limp guy that she's holding onto is actually Tony Pantages, the director of \"Hold On\". This video also won two Canadian Music Video awards (Best Female and Best Adult Contemporary).\n\nPossession (American Version)\n\nDirected by: Julie Hermelin\n\nYear released: 1994\n\nColour.\n\nDescription: Sarah and the band are playing in a beautiful theatre. The premise of the video is that we are actually watching a scratched up film of the performance, perhaps emphasizing the voyeur/idolatry angle of the song.\n\nHold On (Canadian Version)\n\nDirected by: Tony Pantages\n\nYear released: 1994\n\nColour.\n\nDescription: Looks quite a bit like REM's \"Losing my Religion\" in lighting and design. In the video, different people perform various acts of frustration: a man is blindfolded and trying to pry his gloved hands apart, a young cherubic, Pan-type boy comes and soothes his pain; a woman furiously paces back and forth. Meanwhile two people perform a sensual ballet on a single trapeze. Shot in Montreal, P.Q.\n\nGood Enough\n\nDirected by: Kharen Hill\n\nYear released: 1994\n\nBlack and White (colour tinted).\n\nDescription: A young girl escapes her abusive home life with the help of a girlfriend. Her mother also finds some refuge and peace. Features Sarah and the band in black and white clips. Shot in Maple Ridge, B.C.\n\nHold On (American Version)\n\nDirected by: Tony Pantages\n\nYear released: 1995\n\nColour.\n\nDescription: Rehashing of the Canadian version of the video. The cuts are faster and the whole video has a greater sense of tortured urgency. There are more shots of the trapeze artists and Sarah can actually be seen standing with the t rapeze artists behind her.\n\nCommercial Video Releases\n\nImmortal Canvas (Nettwerk W5-005) Year released: 1991\n\nDescription: A Nettwerk video compilation, this videocassette includes the \"Path of Thorns(Terms)\" and \"Ben's Song\" videos.\n\nNo Alternative (Polygram Video 800630461-3) Year released: 1994\n\nDescription: This video is a companion to the \"No Alternative\" CD. The Sarah portion of the tape is a short film (directed by: Nick Gomez) using the \"No Alternative\" version of \"Hold On.\" The short film has a Halloween theme. Sarah does not appear in the video.\n\nFumbling Towards Ecstasy: Live (Nettwerk W5-006) Year released: 1994\n\nColour.\n\nDescription: Filmed in Montreal at Le Theatre Olympia during the FTE tour and intercut with an interview session held at Pierre Marchand's Studio Nomade (Wild Sky Studios), in April, 1994. This video was first aired on T.V. as a pay-per-view special.

Songs included are: \"Ice Cream\", \"Plenty\", \"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\", \"I Will No t Forget You\", \"Ol' 55\", and a rollicking gospel rendition of \"Mary\".\n\nVideo Collection: 1989-1994 (Nettwerk W5-007) Year released: 1995\n\nColour and B&W.\n\nDescription: A compilation of all of Sarah's videos (Canadian and U.S. versions)\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1. Vox (Cdn. Version)\n\n2. Steaming\n\n3. Ben's Song\n\n4. Vox (U.S. Version)\n\n5. Path Of Thorns (Terms)\n\n6. Into The Fire\n\n7. Drawn to The Rhythm\n\n8. Possession (Cdn. version)\n\n9.
