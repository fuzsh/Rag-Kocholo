On Conjure One, he develops his own ideas further, applying a wonderful grasp of sounds from the Mediterranean and Middle East. Fulber traveled the world to put together this breathtaking work, which was recorded in Amsterdam, Vancouver, London, and Los Angeles. Given his busy production schedule, it's no surprise that this took three years to finish. The result is satisfying to say the least, as Conjure One is nothing short of sweeping ambient dance-pop. Like Sarah McLachlan's contribution to Delerium's \"Silence,\" the guest vocalists here enhance Fulber's already powerful songwriting. Most magnificent are Sinéad O'Connor (\"Tears From the Moon\"), Poe (\"Center of the Sun\"), and Marie Claire D'Ubaldo (\"Manic Star\"). With other collaborations from Billy Steinberg and the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, this ethereal solo debut (if you can call it a solo effort) is another big step forward for Fulber, as well as culturally diverse pop. A limited-edition version comes with a second disc of remixes.\n\n&copy Kenyon Hopkin /TiVo\n\nMore info\n\nAlbum review\n\nRhys Fulber had already proven his skills in ambient dance with Delerium.
