The earliest track included here is “Heroine” recorded and released in 1986. The back of the CD lists the song as hitting number 89 in the UK charts. The CD follows her career through the years, up to the 2014 release of “Take Me to Church” as a single on August 11, 2014. The second CD ends with four covers of Sinéad O’Connor songs by Lais, No Use for a Name, Chevelle and Placebo. The version of “Heroine” included here is the same version appearing on the soundtrack, and on other Sinéad O’Connor compilations.\n\nBoth CDRs are printed with graphics, and the set includes back and front inserts in a double jewel case.\n\nLiner Notes\n\nRelated Promotional Videos\n\nRelated News"
