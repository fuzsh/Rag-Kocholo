        "text": "Goth-leaning electronic musician Rhys Fulber, co-founder of Canadian industrial act Front Line Assembly, will release his first solo project under the moniker “Conjure One.” Due Aug. 27 from Nettwerk, the album is said to take its cue from the sounds of the Mediterranean and Middle East, and will feature guest vocals from the likes of Sinead O’Connor and Poe.\n\nFulber, also known for his work with co-Front Line Assembly conspirator Bill Leeb in the more ambient-oriented Delerium, describes the worldy electronics as “epic music with a pop structure.” O’Connor lends her chords to first single “Tears from the Moon,” while Poe pops up on “Center of the Sun” and “Make a Wish.” Other vocalists include Israel’s Chemda and Argentina’s Marie-Claire D’Ubaldo.\n\nIt’s a formula that Fulber has been using for years, as one of his biggest hits came courtesy of Sarah McLachlan, who guested on Deleruim’s “Silence.” The cut reached No. 6 on Billboard’s Hot Dance Music chart in September 2000. Additionally, Delerium’s 2000 release “Poem” featured vocals from such wide-reaching artists as power-popper Matthew Sweet and ex-Miranda Sex Garden singer Katharine Blake.\n\nFulber, who recorded the “Conjure One” album over a span of three years, has been spending much of his recent time producing and remixing for such artists as Pete Tong, P.O.D., Josh Groban, Fear Factory, and Mudvayne."
