        "text": "Nettwerk is excited to announce the signing of euphoric west coast/indie-folk duo Ocie Elliott, to its worldwide label roster. Hailing from Victoria, B.C and comprised of couple Jon Middleton (of Jon & Roy) and Sierra Lundy, the two met playing music at a festival on the small, wind-swept Salt Spring Island, where their love of music and the chemistry of their voices fostered an instant connection.\n\nPremiering on Spill Magazine, the pair shared their latest single “Hold My Name” which is off an upcoming new album releasing in early in 2019. When asked about the track, here’s what the pair had to say. “The track is essentially about being there for someone in the long run. It’s a love song that touches on the subtleties in a relationship, the sadness of missing a partner and the idea of having someone to be there through the good and the bad in life. We choose the song title because it alludes to something more personal than love itself. To us, holding someone’s name is a way of communicating a specific kind of eternal love, where the ‘name’ represents a person’s identity, their soul — something that you can’t physically hold. It expresses the feeling of being loved, held, or supported even without palpable affirmation.”"
