        "text": "FEATURING NEW SINGLE “LIFE’S JUST NO FUN”\n\nLISTEN HERE\n\n+ EUROPEAN AND U.K. HEADLINE TOUR TICKETS ON SALE NOW\n\nLiverpool April, 19th 2024 - After an incredibly prolific run of much-loved releases over recent months, including “The Best View in Liverpool,” “Anywhere for You,” “Have You Ever Loved Someone,” “Name In Lights,” “Tell You I Love You”, “C’est La Vie” and the mesmerising single \"Perfectly Broken (Duet Version)\" featuring the soulful voice of America’s Got Talent 2022 breakout star Lily Meola, award-winning Liverpudlian artist, songwriter BANNERS (aka Michael Nelson) has now released his eagerly-awaited new album ‘All Back To Mine’, featuring the dazzling new effort “Life’s Just No Fun”.\n\n‘All Back to Mine’ marks BANNERS’ homecoming to Liverpool after a whirlwind of success in North America. It's a record cemented in friendship, optimism and love - both romantic and familial.\n\n“I put my heartstrings all over this album. You want to fill your life with experiences, don't you? And the more of them, the better.\" Nelson adds, “I can't judge what's good and what isn't anymore. All I can do is try to make something that matters.”\n\n\"I lived away from home for a little while. Quite a long time actually. Sometimes life is happening somewhere else and that's where you need to go. Sometimes you need to go so that you can come back. And then being back is the greatest gift you could ever be given. This album is the sound of me being back. Back with my friends and family. The most inspiring people in the most inspiring place. I think mainly this is the sound of me being happy, knowing that I'm in the place that I'm supposed to be.\"\n\nHighlighting the new release is its penultimate song “Life’s Just No Fun”, a piano-led ballad that heightens more of that illuminating songwriting he has been garnering lately.\n\nAdding about “Life’s Just No Fun”, he said, \"I bought the piano of my dreams. Some strong men carried it up some stairs for me. Then when they went away I wrote this song on it. It's about how life just isn't as good when that one person isn't in it. I really love Regina Spektor so much and I think this song is a bit Regina Spektor-y. I'm listening to it now and I think I might even put a little Regina Spektor accent on in one bit.\"\n\nTo kick off an exciting 2024, BANNERS is set to tour Europe and the UK this spring for a handful of headline shows. Tickets are on sale now, and for more information and to purchase tickets, visit BANNERS website HERE.\n\nBANNERS Tour Dates:\n\nMay 7 - Bristol, England - Thekla\n\nMay 8 - Cardiff, Wales - The Globe\n\nMay 10 - London, England - Heaven\n\nMay 11 - Birmingham, England - O2 Institute\n\nMay 12 - Manchester, England - Band On The Wall\n\nMay 13 - Glasgow, Scotland - The Garage\n\nMay 15 - Amsterdam, Netherlands - Melkweg\n\nMay 16 - Tilburg, Netherlands - 013 Tilburg\n\nMay 17 - Cologne, Germany - Luxor\n\nMay 19 - Zurich, Switzerland - Papiersaal\n\nMay 21 - Vienna, Austria - Simm City\n\nMay 23 - Hamburg, Germany - Knust\n\nMay 25 - Stockholm, Sweden - Bar Brooklyn\n\nMay 26 - Copenhagen, Denmark - Pumpehuset\n\nMay 27 - Oslo, Norway - Parkteatret\n\nEnglish indie-pop act BANNERS (a.k.a. Michael Joseph Nelson) is known for his effervescent melodies and immensely relatable lyrics about the human condition. With Nelson’s latest full-length, All Back to Mine, it’s safe to say he owns a market share in feel-good anthems streamlined to soundtrack your best life.\n\n“Someone to You,” his soaring track about simply being “seen,” has over 780 million streams on Spotify along and collectively his catalogue has amassed over 2 Billion streams. The single proved so unforgettable; BANNERS performed it on Season 16 of American Idol. Before that, his hit singles could be heard all over television, among them: “Ghosts” on Suits and Teen Wolf,” Half Light” on The Royals and New Amsterdam, and “Got It in You” on The Good Doctor and America’s Got Talent. His EP ‘I Wish I Was Flawless, I’m Not’ was recently nominated for a JUNO Award for Adult Contemporary Album Of The Year.\n\nWritten and recorded over nine months, primarily in Liverpool and on the breath-taking Scottish isle of Lewis, the title, All Back to Mine, refers to an exuberant, long-awaited return to his hometown of Liverpool after spending seven years in Canada to get his career going. Rich in romance and optimism, it’s as positively infectious as you’d expect.\n\nAll Back To Mine Track listing\n\nName in Lights\n\nHave You Ever Loved Someone\n\nAnywhere For You\n\nIn Your Universe\n\nThere Goes My Girl\n\nC’est La Vie\n\nThe Best View In Liverpool\n\nPerfectly Broken (Duet Version)\n\nBroken Hearted\n\nTell You I Love You\n\nLife’s Just No Fun\n\nAll That You Made Me\n\nFollow BANNERS"
