        "text": "Never Better, the anticipated new album from Platinum-selling trio Wild Rivers—Khalid Yassein, Devan Glover and Andrew Oliver—is out today on Nettwerk Music Group. Stream/purchase HERE. In conjunction with the release, a new video for the title track is debuting today. Watch/share the video, directed by Hannah Gray Hall and produced by Weird Candy, HERE.\n\nProduced by Gabe Wax (Soccer Mommy, Adrienne Lenker) and recorded in Joshua Tree, CA, Never Better reflects on the band’s past few years, as they faced burnout, mental health challenges and extended periods on the road, while also rediscovering the joy of making music together. Across these eight tracks, including previously released songs, “Backfire,” “Anyways, I Love You,” “Cave” and Everywhere I Go,” Wild Rivers is their most free and authentic self, as they return with a new level of confidence and an energized creative perspective.\n\nThe release adds to an already notable year for Wild Rivers, whose breakout single, “Thinking ‘Bout Love,” was recently certified RIAA Gold in the United States, following previous certifications in Canada (Platinum) and Australia (Gold). Additionally, the group will embark on an extensive headline tour this fall with special guests Jade Bird and Lily Meola. Upcoming stops include New York’s Irving Plaza (two nights, one sold out), Nashville’s Ryman Auditorium, Los Angeles’ Fonda Theater, Boston’s Paradise Rock Club (sold out), Austin’s Scoot Inn (sold out), Chicago’s Vic Theater, Denver’s Ogden Theater (sold out), Seattle’s The Showbox and San Francisco’s Regency Ballroom among many others. See below for complete tour itinerary. Full details can be found at www.wildriversmusic.com/tour.\n\nReflecting on the new music, the group shares, “We approached this record with the mindset, ‘this is who we are.’ We aren’t pretending to be something we’re not, or trying to sound like anyone else. We wanted it to feel easy. We wanted the stories to be real. We wanted to show our true selves as best we could. We’re proud of who we’ve become as people and as a team. We truly feel like we’re having the most fun with music that we’ve ever had, and in the most exciting stage of our lives. We’re never better.”\n\nFormed during their time at Queen’s University in Ontario, Wild Rivers has released two full-length albums to date including 2022’s Sidelines, which landed at #9 on the U.S. Spotify Debut Album Chart. Released to critical acclaim, Under The Radar praised, “expertly straddles the lines between folk and indie, offering an empathetic and enveloping comfort and a piece of poignant pop beauty,” while American Songwriter declared, “Soul-stirring…rich male/female harmonies bring the emotional lyrics to life.” Since the release of Sidelines, Wild Rivers has also been nominated for Breakthrough Group of The Year at the 2023 JUNO Awards, garnered over 800 million global streams, with 4 million monthly listeners on Spotify and joined artists such as The Chicks and Noah Kahan on the road.\n\nNEVER BETTER TRACK LIST\n\n1.
