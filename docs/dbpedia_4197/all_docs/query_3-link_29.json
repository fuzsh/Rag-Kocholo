        "text": "SYML, signed to Nettwerk Music Group, has released 'In My Body,' the followup EP to his debut 'Hurt For Me' EP. The EP features his new single, 'Wildfire,' along with his viral hit, 'Where’s My Love,' which just passed 100 million combined streams, and a stunning cover of Neil Young’s Harvest Moon. Both EPs are available now to purchase as a special double EP physical package called The Hurt Eps.\n\nYou can listen to the full EP on Soundcloud, YouTube, Spotify, Apple and Amazon.\n\nSYML will embark on his first headline UK/European tour next month, titled the 'Where’s My Love' tour, which begins in Berlin (the first of four German dates) on 30th January and takes him through Brussels, Amsterdam, Paris, two special nights at St. Pancras Old Church in London, then Manchester and Dublin, before wrapping in Stockholm on 14th February. Cologne, Brussels, Amsterdam and both London shows are now sold out. Labelmate Joshua Hyslop will be supporting on selected European dates.\n\nSYML has also announced additional North American dates in March as well. Full list of dates are below.\n\nFrom his basement recording studio in the small town of Issaquah, WA outside Seattle, Brian Fennell began to write and record songs under the name SYML, which means simple in Welsh. Adopted and not knowing his history or connection to his Welsh roots, many of these songs are influenced by the complex feelings that come from unknown lineage.\n\nTour Dates:\n\nJan 22nd Buffalo, NY @ Tralf Music Hall\n\nJan 23rd Toronto, Canada @ The Drake Underground (SOLD OUT)\n\nJan 24th Albany, NY @ The Hollow\n\nJan 25th New York, NY @ Rockwood Music Hall\n\nJan 27th Philadelphia, PA @ 104.5 Winter Jawn\n\nJan 28th Wilkes-Barre, PA @ ALT 92.1 Snow Show\n\nJan 30th Berlin, Germany @ Kesselhaus Acoustics\n\nJan 31st Hamburg, Germany @ Knust Acoustics\n\nFeb 1st Cologne, Germany @ Theatre der WG (SOLD OUT)\n\nFeb 3rd Frankfurt, Germany @ Bedroom disco\n\nFeb 4th Brussels, Belgium @ Rotonde @Botanique (SOLD OUT) *\n\nFeb 5th Amsterdam, Netherlands @Paradiso (SOLD OUT)\n\nFeb 7th Paris, France @ Pop-Up Du Label *\n\nFeb 8th London, UK @ St. Pancras Church (SOLD OUT) *\n\nFeb 9th London, UK @ St. Pancras Church (SOLD OUT) *\n\nFeb 10th Manchester, UK @ Fallow Café *\n\nFeb 12th Dublin, Ireland @ Whelan’s *\n\nFeb 14th Stockholm, Sweden @ Obaren\n\nMar 5th Los Angeles, CA @ The Moroccan Lounge\n\nMar 7th San Francisco, CA @ Rickshaw Stop\n\nMar 9th Portland, OR @ The Old Church\n\nMar 10th Seattle, WA @ Columbia City Theater\n\nMar 13-18th Austin, TX @ SXSW (details to follow soon)"
