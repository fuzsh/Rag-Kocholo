        "text": "Nowell Rhys Fulber is a Canadian electronic musician and producer. He is a member of Front Line Assembly[1] and Delerium, along with Bill Leeb. He also records under his own name and under the name Conjure One.\n\nBiography[]\n\nRhys Fulber was born in Vancouver, Canada on October 10, 1970. His father, a musician, was born in Germany and his mother was from Great Britain. His father introduced him to the music of Led Zeppelin and Kraftwerk (and took him along to see Kraftwerk live in 1975). Fulber became interested in music and started drumming on his father's instruments at a very early age.\n\nHis father later built and ran a recording studio, catering toward the local punk rock scene. As a youth, Fulber spent a lot of time at the studio. In 1984 he started becoming more interested in electronic music and acquired his first synthesizer.\n\nIn 1986, he became friends with Bill Leeb, who had just left his former band Skinny Puppy.[2]\n\nFulber is a first cousin of Shawn Atleo (Ahousaht First Nation), a Canadian activist and politician, who was elected twice as national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, serving 2009 into 2014.\n\nEarly music career[]\n\nFulber's first involvements in Front Line Assembly were one song on their second cassette release Total Terror, and then three songs on The Initial Command. He also contributed to Delerium's debut album, Faces, Forms & Illusions. During this time he started the band Will together with Chris Peterson, John McRae and Jeff Stoddard, which lasted from 1987 to 1992.\n\nHe joined Front Line Assembly for their first tour, Gashed Senses & Crossfire in 1989. He then joined Delerium full-time when Michael Balch left.[3] Until 1997, Fulber was involved in all Front Line Assembly, Delerium and side projects with Bill Leeb, including the albums Tactical Neural Implant and Hard Wired from Front Line Assembly, and Semantic Spaces and Karma from Delerium.\n\nLeeb and Fulber released several albums as Synæsthesia, including Embody, Desideratum[4] and Ephemeral.\n\nFulber was nominated for the Jack Richardson Producer Of The Year award at the 2008 Juno Awards and won two Junos with Delerium for Best Dance Recording in 1998 and 2000.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nThis section lists only regular full studio albums.\n\nUnder his own name[]\n\nYour Dystopia, My Utopia (Sonic Groove, 2018)\n\nOstalgia (Sonic Groove, 2019)\n\nDiaspora (aufnahme + wiedergabe, 2020)\n\nResolve (FR Recordings, 2020)\n\nBrutal Nature (FR Recordings, 2021)\n\nConjure One[]\n\nConjure One (Nettwerk, 2002)\n\nExtraordinary Ways (Nettwerk, 2005)\n\nExilarch (Nettwerk, 2010)\n\nHoloscenic (Armada Music, 2015)\n\nDelerium[]\n\nMorpheus (Dossier, 1989)\n\nSyrophenikan (Dossier, 1990)\n\nStone Tower (Dossier, 1991)\n\nSpiritual Archives (Dossier, 1991)\n\nSpheres (Dossier, 1994)\n\nSemantic Spaces (Nettwerk, 1994)\n\nSpheres II (Dossier, 1994)\n\nKarma (Nettwerk, 1997)\n\nChimera (Nettwerk, 2003)\n\nNuages du Monde (Nettwerk, 2006)\n\nMusic Box Opera (Nettwerk, 2012)\n\nMythologie (Metropolis, 2016)\n\nFauxliage[]\n\nFauxliage (Nettwerk, 2007)\n\nFront Line Assembly[]\n\nThe Initial Command (Third Mind, 1987)\n\nCaustic Grip (Third Mind, 1990)\n\nTactical Neural Implant (Third Mind, 1992)\n\nMillennium (Roadrunner, 1994)\n\nHard Wired (Off Beat, 1995)\n\nCivilization (Metropolis, 2004)\n\nArtificial Soldier (Metropolis, 2006)\n\nWake Up the Coma (Metropolis, 2019)\n\nMechanical Soul (Metropolis, 2021)\n\nIntermix[]\n\nIntermix (Third Mind, 1992)\n\nPhaze Two (Third Mind, 1992)\n\nFuture Primitives (ESP-Sun, 1995)\n\nNoise Unit[]\n\nResponse Frequency (Antler-Subway, 1990)\n\nStrategy of Violence (Dossier, 1992)\n\nDecoder (Dossier, 1995)\n\nDrill (Off Beat, 1996)\n\nDeviator (Artoffact, 2021)\n\nSynæsthesia[]\n\nEmbody (Cleopatra, 1995)\n\nDesideratum (Hypnotic, 1995)\n\nEphemeral (Hypnotic, 1997)\n\nWill[]\n\nPearl of Great Price (Third Mind, 1991)\n\nProduction[]\n\nAs Front Line Assembly was beginning to peak, their UK label Third Mind was bought out by Roadrunner Records, a predominantly metal label. An up-and-coming band on the label Fear Factory was looking to expand their sound with remixes and new label mates Front Line Assembly were contacted. This led to the influential Fear Is the Mindkiller EP. From this more metal themed work followed while Fulber was contracted to contribute keyboards and de facto additional production to Fear Factory's breakthrough Demanufacture album, defining their signature sound. Fulber had also contributed backing tracks around this same time to new Canadian industrial rock band Econoline Crush, leading to their signing with EMI Canada and eventually his first full length production job handling their debut album Affliction, spawning minor Canadian rock radio hit \"Wicked\". From there his production career grew and became more varied. The later success of Delerium bringing him into more adult music formats with artists like Josh Groban and Serena Ryder. Based out of Los Angeles since 2000, he currently works out of his own studio, Surplus Sound in Van Nuys.\n\nSelected production credits[]\n\nFor musicians[]\n\n1993: Fear Factory - Fear Is the Mindkiller (remixing)\n\n1994: Econoline Crush - Purge (programming, keyboards)\n\n1995: Fear Factory - Demanufacture (programming, keyboards, mixing, co-writing)\n\n1995: Machine Head - Old (remixing)\n\n1995: Econoline Crush - Affliction (production, keyboards, programming)\n\n1995: Nailbomb - Proud to Commit Commercial Suicide (keyboards, programming)\n\n1996: Front Line Assembly and Die Krupps - The Remix Wars: Strike 2 (remixing)\n\n1996: The Tea Party - Alhambra (remixing)\n\n1997: Fear Factory - Remanufacture - Cloning Technology (remixing)\n\n1997: Waltari - Space Avenue (producing, programming)\n\n1998: Skinny Puppy - Remix Dystemper (remixing)\n\n1998: Fear Factory - Obsolete (producing, programming, keyboards, co writing)\n\n1998: Cubanate - Interference (producing, programming, keyboards)\n\n2000: Factory 81 - Mankind (remixing)\n\n2001: The Watchmen - Slomotion (producing, programming, keyboards)\n\n2001: Josh Groban - Josh Groban (producing, programming)\n\n2001: Fear Factory - Digimortal (producing, programming, keyboards, co writing)\n\n2002: Paradise Lost - Symbol of Life (producing, programming, keyboards)\n\n2004: Collide - Vortex (remixing)\n\n2004: L'Âme Immortelle - Gezeiten (producing, programming, keyboards)\n\n2004: Fear Factory - Archetype (programming, keyboards, co writing)\n\n2005: Paradise Lost - Paradise Lost (producing, programming, keyboards)\n\n2007: Paradise Lost - In Requiem (producing, keyboards)\n\n2009: Divine Heresy - Bringer of Plagues (keyboards\n\n2010: Fear Factory - Mechanize (producing, programming, keyboards, co writing)\n\n2012: Fear Factory - The Industrialist (producing, programming, keyboards, engineering, co writing)\n\n2013: Mindless Self Indulgence - How I Learned to Stop Giving a Shit and Love Mindless Self Indulgence (mixing, additional production, engineering, co writing)\n\n2013: Scar the Martyr - Scar the Martyr (producing, keyboards, programming)\n\n2014: Machine Head - Bloodstone & Diamonds (string arrangements, keyboards, percussion)\n\n2015: Fear Factory - Genexus (producing, programming, keyboards, engineering)\n\n2016: Youth Code - Commitment to Complications (producing, mixing, engineering, additional programming, additional keyboards)\n\n2018: Machine Head - Catharsis (programming, string arrangements)\n\n2018: Three Days Grace - Outsider (keyboards, programming)\n\nFor other media[]\n\n2000: Gun Shy (additional score)\n\n2002: Coors Light - \"Rock On\"\n\n2006: Justice (theme programming)\n\n2020: Cyberpunk 2077 (two tracks for game play[5])\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nTemplate:Bandcamp\n\nFull list of production credits, at official Nettwerk site\n\nTemplate:Usurped\n\nTemplate:Front Line Assembly\n\nTemplate:Delerium Template:Will (band)"
