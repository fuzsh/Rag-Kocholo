        "text": "Rhys Fulber is best known for his work with Delerium and Front Line Assembly, while also highly regarded for his production for the likes of Sarah Brightman, Josh Groban, P.O.D., and Mudvayne. After spending nearly two decades as a part of electronica's pioneering acts, Fulber emerged as Conjure One. Music has always been an integral part of his life. Born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Fulber was surrounded by instruments at an early age. His dad was a musician, and by age five, Fulber was playing drums. By 11, he was a punk rock kid buying Dead Kennedys records and learning the ways of the studio. Pete Shelley's synth-driven Homosapien release was the way to Fulber's heart; by 14, he'd received a drum machine and a keyboard as a gift from his father and his electronic musical visions were underway. Going by the moniker Conjure One in 1999, Fulber traveled around the world for a three-year period, absorbing all sorts of world music for an interesting electronic sound. Redemption marked Conjure One's proper debut in 2001. A year later, Fulber joined Sin√©ad O'Connor, Poe, and Israeli singer Chemda for a self-titled second album. Fulber himself would making his singing debut with a version of the Buzzcocks classic \"I Believe\" included on the 2005 album Extraordinary Ways.\n\n&copy MacKenzie Wilson /TiVo"
