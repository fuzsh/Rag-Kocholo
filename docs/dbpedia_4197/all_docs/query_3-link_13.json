        "text": "HIMALAYAS kick off 2023 with the highly anticipated announcement of their debut album release! From Hell To Here will be released via Nettwerk on 5th May, and will span twelve previously released singles including album title track From Hell To Here, Out Of The Dark And Into The Light and Alone, plus several unheard songs. From Hell To Here can be pre-saved here.\n\nAs well as their exciting album release news, the Welsh rock-outfit have also today released their single Into The Trap. Set to appear on the band’s debut album, the swaggering and sultry track, “is a song about the unknown and the feelings of fear and resignation that come with facing up to it.” guitarist Mike Griffiths explains. “The melodramatic lyrics switch perspective to move with the music and create an atmosphere of uncertainty and dread.” Watch the lyric video here and below:\n\nHIMALAYAS are gearing up to support Welsh-American rock band, No Devotion. They will join them on 26th January at Cardiff’s Clwb Ifor Bach, and on 7th February at the Lexington in London. Buy tickets here. Last year saw the quartet wrap a UK headline tour, which included sold out shows; one being their raucous hometown gig at Buffalo in Cardiff."
