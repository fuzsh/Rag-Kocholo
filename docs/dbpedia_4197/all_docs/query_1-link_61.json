Charlie gently stirs the heart while simultaneously nourishing the soul as Schottland treats listeners to ten intimate confessionals – a personal collage of her last three years, which included an impactful move from Brooklyn to California. For her, this record is a “time capsule… full of love, grief, loss, daydreams, and the untethered feeling of change.” Littered with little sparks of musical magic, Charlie is a heartwarming, smile-inducing folk record ready to soundtrack winter’s cold nights. – Mitch Mosk\n\n1/19 Lil Dicky – PENITH (The DAVE Soundtrack) (BMG)\n\n1/19 Green Day – Saviors (Warner Records)\n\nTwo decades after Green Day reached what remains its commercial and cultural pinnacle with American Idiot, their fourteenth studio album, Saviors, demonstrates that there is life in them yet as a veteran rock group – and one that still has plenty of bones to pick with their home country. – Josh Weiner\n\nGREEN DAY THROW A BIG BIRTHDAY BASH FOR TWO OF THEIR CLASSICS ON ‘SAVIORS’\n\n:: OUR TAKE ::\n\n1/19 Brown Horse – Reservoir (Loose Music)\n\nNorwish, England’s Brown Horse ache from the inside out on their debut album Reservoir, a hauntingly beautiful alt-country record full of turbulence and tenderness, born from an inescapable inner turmoil and an undying love of folk, alternative rock, and country music. It’s a dreamy, emotionally charged reverie that pays homage to the band’s folk roots, while establishing them as sonic kinfolk to groups like Lucero and Big Thief – contemporary acts that have, in their own ways, broken the mold and charted their own unique paths in the music world. – Mitch Mosk\n\nBROWN HORSE’S ‘RESERVOIR’ IS A HAUNTING, INTIMATE ALT-COUNTRY REVERIE\n\n:: TRACK-BY-TRACK ::\n\n1/19 Eliza McLamb – Going Through It\n\n1/19 Sleater-Kinney – Little Rope (Loma Vista Recordings)\n\nJanuary 26 Album Releases\n\n1/26 Courting – New Last Name (Lower Third)\n\n1/26 Future Islands – People Who Aren’t There Anymore (4AD)\n\nFuture Islands are a band to grow with, a band to embrace both heartbreak and joy, dark and light, sometimes one right after another.

The dream rock band confront, contemplate, and comment on modernity and the human condition without drawing conclusions – facilitating open-ended conversations (and reflections) on the state of things that provoke us to, in turn, dig deeper into ourselves and the many ways in which we do and don’t connect with the world. – Mitch Mosk\n\n• •\n\n“SPACE, ALIENATION, & WONDER”: LONDON’S JUNODREAM UNPACK THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE ON ‘POOLS OF COLOUR’\n\n:: FEATURE ::\n\n1/26 Katy Kirby – Blue Raspberry (ANTI- Records)\n\n1/26 Large Brush Collection – Off Center (independent)\n\n1/26 Mall Girl – Pure Love (Jansen Records)\n\n1/26 NewDad – MADRA (Atlantic Records)\n\nHeavy, achingly raw, and emotionally charged, MADRA is an unrelenting alternative album built on fragility, vulnerability, and the dark depths of human experience. NewDad’s debut album finds them dwelling in the deep end of the sonic and emotional spectrum, picking their worlds apart as they comprehend the sheer weight of living through a haze of grunge, shoegaze, and dreamy indie rock. – Mitch Mosk\n\n• •\n\nNEWDAD UNPACK THE “SAD, NOISY ROCK” WORLD OF ‘MADRA,’ THEIR CATHARTIC & HEAVY-HITTING DEBUT ALBUM\n\n:: TRACK-BY-TRACK ::\n\n1/26 The Smile – Wall of Eyes (XL Recordings)\n\n1/26 Ty Segall – Three Bells (Drag City)\n\n1/29 Conchúr White – Swirling Violets (Bella Union)\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nFebruary 2 Album Releases\n\n2/2 Britti – Hello, I’m Britti (Easy Eye Sound)\n\n2/2 Giant Rooks – How Have You Been?

It’s a record of poetic self-expression and radiant revelry: A charming collection of songs ready to be the soundtrack to our own dusty roads as James soaks up the full spectrum of life experience, crafting a ‘patchwork’ record that stitches together the stories of her life to date. – Mitch Mosk\n\n• •\n\n“A WARM HUG”: SHANNEN JAMES’ SPIRITED DEBUT ‘PATCHWORK’ IS A STUNNING, SUN-KISSED SOUNDTRACK TO LIFE\n\n:: FEATURE ::\n\n2/2 The Last Dinner Party – Prelude to Ecstasy (Island Records)\n\nThe Last Dinner Party’s debut album Prelude to Ecstasy cements the London group’s status as an indie pop band with ambitious imagination, melding genres and references of their choosing into a wild and mellifluous collage, taking musical maximalism to an extreme in both lyrical content and sonic arrangement. – Olivia Martinez\n\n• •\n\nTHE LAST DINNER PARTY’S ‘PRELUDE TO ECSTASY’ IS A TRIUMPHANT EXPLORATION OF MAXIMALISM IN MUSIC\n\n:: REVIEW ::\n\nFebruary 9 Album Releases\n\n2/9 1999 WRITE THE FUTURE – hella (˃̣̣̥╭╮˂̣̣̥) ✧ ♡ ‧º·˚: (88rising / RCA Records)\n\n2/9 Brittany Howard – What Now (Island Records)\n\n2/9 Chelsea Wolfe – She Reaches Out To She Reaches Out To She (Loma Vista Recordings)\n\n2/9 Cj Pandit – One Lost English Boy (Lost Language)\n\n2/9 Declan McKenna – What Happened to the Beach?

After receiving a five year prison sentence for a desertion charge of the Army in 1993, Roger Frank mysteriously vanished from his cell, leaving nothing but an orange behind. Roger’s body was never found. When he was just 5 years old, Lukas began receiving visitations from his elusive uncle through vivid, recurring nightmares. Roger would come to Lukas in his room and try to speak with him, but Roger’s mouth wasn’t working; like it was glued shut. In his hands was a large orange, the skin peeled back, and written in the rind were words in black ink. While all of the stories told in Ink & Oil speak to experiences from Lukas’ past, there is an open ambiguity as to what’s factually real and what’s emotionally real. He finds his inspiration in the tension between the two; the gray area where memory and belief overtake accepted truth and certainty to reform into something deeper; something that Lukas feels can be described simply as Faith.” (PR)\n\n6/28 Towa Bird – American Hero (Interscope Records)\n\n6/28 WAASH – WAASH (Light Organ Records)\n\n6/28 Washed Out – Notes From a Quiet Life (Sub Pop)\n\nJuly 2024\n\nJuly 5 Album Releases\n\n7/4 Zach Bryan – THE GREAT AMERICAN BAR SCENE (Warner Records)\n\n7/5 Burr Island – Days Dreamt (Left Foot Records)\n\n7/5 Eves Karydas – Burnt Tapes (independent)\n\nJuly 12 Album Releases\n\n7/10 Smooth Rogers – Roger That!

It was recorded in the autumnal sunshine of Leith with Rod Jones from Idlewild at the production controls. From the driving ‘I Will Break My Own Heart’, the twinkling ‘Beck and Call’, the electric force of ‘Total Communication Breakdown’ to the blossoming ‘Gracie’, there is a song to accompany everyone’s own life soundtrack.” (PR)\n\n7/12 Cigarettes After Sex – X’s (Partisan Records)\n\n7/12 Clairo – Charm (Virgin Music Group)\n\n“Evoking balmy summer evenings and tête-à-têtes in plush conversation pits, Clairo’s third album Charm is a collection of warm, ’70s-inspired grooves that move lithely between jazz, psychedelic folk and soul, an extroverted bounce back from her beloved 2021 album Sling. Co-produced by Clairo and Leon Michels (of The Dap-Kings and El Michels Affair), Charm is the type of gorgeous, ornate, sensual record only Clairo could create, an amalgamation of everything that has made her one of the most celebrated artists of the last five years.” (PR)\n\n7/12 Donovan Woods – Things Were Never Good If They’re Not Good (End Times Music)\n\n“On his seventh studio album, singer/songwriter Donovan Woods takes a long look inside – and isn’t necessarily thrilled with what he sees. For an artist who isn’t afraid to bear his soul, this is as emotionally gritty as he has ever been. Across the album’s 12 sparse, intimate songs, Woods finds himself reflecting on the ups and downs he has been through since 2020. His writing allowed him to open up and address the complexities of life that he has been going through. The album, he notes, serves as ‘a funeral to the life he was living.'” (PR)\n\n7/12 Font – Strange Burden (Acrophase Records)\n\n7/12 Hannah Mohan – Time Is a Walnut (Egghunt Records)\n\n7/12 Phish – Evolve (Phish Inc)\n\n7/12 Tayla Parx – Many Moons, Many Suns (TaylaMade Records)\n\n“Crafted over a tumultuous two years, Many Moons, Many Suns captures the emotional whirlwind of Parx’s celestial journey of self-discovery. From establishing boundaries in ‘Rich,’ to difficult endings in ‘Dream Hotel’ and ‘This Was Supposed to Be Our Wedding Song,’ and finding new freedoms in ‘For What It’s Worth,’ each track represents a step in the hitmaker’s ongoing evolution. The 13-track record also features her previously released summer anthem ‘Era’ (feat. Tkay Maidza), which received glowing critical praise upon release.”\n\n“‘Many Moons, Many Suns captures the essence of my last two years – a period marked by an unnoticed depression, hidden beneath moments so vibrant they masked my internal struggles,’ Tayla explains. ‘Despite always wearing a smile, I’ve learned that it can manifest in way more ways than a tear. This album was born from the challenges of an unexpected breakup while deeper exploration into self-love and companionship. It reflects my curiosities and the ways they lead me to redefine intimacy and connection.

It’s a country-tinged, radio-ready sound, yet delves deep into universal themes. From stirring reflections on death and aging to the joyous celebrations of life, love, and triumph, every track on Fancy Gap captures different facets of the human experience.

A line from ‘To Live Is To Fly’ has stuck with him ever since; Van Zandt sang, ‘When here you been is good an gone, all you keep is the getting there.’ LaMontagne reflects, ‘Thirty years later it occurs to me that every song on Long Way Home is in one way or another honoring the journey. The languorous days of youth and innocence. The countless battles of adulthood, some won, more often lost. It’s been a long hard road, and I wouldn’t change a minute. It took me nine songs to express what Townes managed to say in one line.

Most of these songs reflect his time living overseas between 2010-2020 as he was finishing a PhD, working, & wrestling with years of PTSD. With a surprising mix of English & Armenian, Vaun’s lyrics offer a taste of what it means to grapple with being multicultural & multilingual in the 21st Century. While his previous record, The Cynthia Sessions, was an intimate concept album, Stuck Inside a Map has an expansive feel, anchored by his band’s live sound and production by Vaun and Dave Minehan. The catchy melodies & lush arrangements balance the highly personal lyrics, resulting in bittersweet indie pop deliciousness. The album itself is the result of around 6 years of somewhat reclusive songwriting. It’s a record that signals coming out of a decades-long fog brought on by a high dose of tragedy, upheaval, and PTSD.” (PR)\n\n8/2 Anberlin – Vega (Equal Vision Records)\n\n8/2 Blood – Loving You Backwards (Ramp Local)\n\n“Blood circa Loving You Backwards was made by an emotionally knit six piece. This record encompasses that first generation of Blood, the one that completely immersed itself in their newfound home and dedicated themselves to the craft of losing oneself in the artform. While writing the record, the band made a group effort to share the burden of collective grief by holding weekly meetings to discuss mental health. As a collective, they quickly abandoned any former attachments to musical notions of punk or genre at all. bandleader/lyricist Tim O’Brien ‘felt liberated to let the femme shades of my voice show on record for the first time and allowed my first true love for pop melodies to come to the surface.'”\n\n“The resulting Loving You Backwards flourishes in the subtle, the ambiguous, the shades of gray. These songs somehow feel both intimate like Liz Harris’ Grouper feels intimate and totally vast in the way that a Talk Talk record feels vast. It’s in the same universe as Ought in its earlier iterations. They exist in the realm of ballads, heart-wrenching and weird pop with a post rock sensibility. It explores, as the title implies, approaching a relationship in the reverse, dealing with your past while you try to stay in the present. Loving You Backwards is a record of big ideas and honesty, but it’s also a record of genuinely pristine pop.” (PR)\n\n8/2 Brigitte Calls Me Baby – The Future Is Our Way Out (ATO Records)\n\n“In choosing a title for the full-length debut, Brigitte Calls Me Baby landed on a phrase lead singer Wes Leavins impulsively scrawled onto a white t-shirt as a teenager and continued to revisit over the years, eventually transforming it into a lush and cinematic pop song. ‘I want to be earnest even when it’s uncomfortable, and write unapologetically about things like my intense fear of death,’ says Leavins. ‘The Future is Our Way Out is about that fear, but it’s also about hoping there might be something beyond death, a way out of all the mess and the sadness that plagues us in life.” (PR)\n\n8/2 Footballhead – Before I Die (Tiny Engines)\n\n“There is no way to avoid the pitfalls of the lived human experience; and in a world where the passing of time carries a residual but certain cynicism, we can’t help but sit from a polarized vantage point. Footballhead’s new mini album Before I Die takes into consideration several bitter hypotheses and truths: fate will make its attempt to control you, the clock never ceases to tick, and you are always judged on your impact, not your intent. This 7-song collection drives the band’s ethos harder and raises their ceiling even higher.” (PR)\n\n8/2 Jack White – No Name (Third Man Records)\n\n8/2 Khalid – Sincere (Right Hand Music Group/RCA Records)\n\n“Through a collection of 16 tracks, Sincere showcases Khalid’s evolution as an artist and person and explores the all-too-relatable feelings of growing up. His irresistible soulful vocals and unfiltered lyricism are on full display.” (PR)\n\n8/2 Orville Peck – Stampede (Warner Music)\n\n8/2 Personal Trainer – Still Willing (Bella Union)\n\n“Witty, welcoming and winningly melodic, Still Willing is the sound of an instinctive DIY-pop musician favoring think-on-your-feet exploration and intuition over know-it-all premeditation. Willem Smit’s initial intent was to record the album as if live, but he realized that his chemistry with Casper van der Lans would not be denied. ‘I felt that we had grown and built a language together. We don’t have to say a lot, but we understand each other well. There was a lot less of trying out stuff and taking stuff away compared to the last record, because it felt like we were on the same wavelength.’\n\n“Still Willing arrives as a fervid expression of Willem’s home-recording and studio methods, tethered to inviting pop instincts and rich with the fertile promise of more to come. Willem doesn’t want to tell you what or how to think about the album but, he says, ‘It would be awesome if people like it and buy the record, so that I can make another one.’ On the strength of Still Willing, he’s fit for the long distance.” (PR)\n\n8/2 Samm Henshaw – For Someone, Somewhere, Who Isn’t Us (Dorm Seven / AWAL)\n\n“This six-track mini album emerged from a period of struggle for Samm and ultimately became a profound life lesson he wishes to share with other creatives. He learned that even in creative hard times, if you remain consistent and resilient something beautiful can come out of it. Unlike past projects, Samm embraces this new era free of expectations. Reflecting on this phase, Samm says, ‘Anything that comes, I’m grateful for it, I’m excited for it. Ultimately, I think it needed to happen just for me to be able to prove to myself that I could still do it. It was almost like this project to me felt more like a lesson.'” (PR)\n\n8/2 The Smashing Pumpkins – Aghori Mhori Mei (Martha’s Music / Thirty Tigers)\n\n“The Smashing Pumpkins’ thirteenth collection to date, Aghori Mhori Mei is a bruising and shadowy return to form from original Smashing Pumpkins members Jimmy Chamberlin, James Iha, and Billy Corgan. The new album harkens back to the band’s early ’90s canon; where guitars, bass, drums, and spiking vocals ruled, and continues the prolific hot streak frontman Billy Corgan kicked off a decade ago. Just last year, the band released the third and final Act of their sprawling and adventurous rock opera ATUM, a sequel to 1995’s Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness and 2000’s Machina/The Machines Of God. While some artists might take a breather after an acclaimed and ambitious triple album, Corgan went straight back into the studio to write, produce, and record this new 10-track body of work. As vital and vibrant a songwriter as ever, Corgan had quickly promised a 2024 follow-up on the horizon, which serves as the latest twist in Corgan’s careful commitment to how his art is presented. The band completed the recording of Aghori Mhori Mei amidst an expansive touring schedule across the last few years.” (PR)\n\n8/2 Tones And I – Beautifully Ordinary (Elektra Records)\n\n“Beautifully Ordinary captures raw human emotion and resonates with the universal longing for connection through heartfelt lyrics and soulful melodies. Reflecting on past relationships, nostalgia, and growth, the album is a personal narrative of the human experience through Tones and I’s eyes. Each song is a relatable chapter in this emotional journey through love, life, and self-acceptance, offering catharsis for anyone who has ever sought to belong.” (PR)\n\n8/7 theMIND – Dancing While Crying in the Middle of Nowhere (A Terrible Thing to Waste)\n\n“Dancing While Crying in The Middle of Nowhere, theMIND’s fourth album, is a culmination of a unique and expansive creative journey over the past few years. This musically textured project, built on limitless genre-bending techniques, promises a raw and unfiltered exploration of unique interpretations of love songs, steering away from conventional paths. By doing so, the album aims to elevate the listening experience, offering fans an unexpected and refreshing perspective on the multifaceted themes of love and inviting listeners on a musical journey that challenges norms and delves into the intricacies of emotion.”\n\n8/9 Amos Lee – Transmissions (Hoagiemouth Records / Thirty Tigers)\n\n8/9 Aquilo – A Quiet Invitation to a Hard Conversation (AWAL)\n\n8/9 Big Sean – Better Me Than You (Def Jam Recordings)\n\n“It’s usually better you than me, but I realize when you that one that has to step up and endure it all – endure the extras, maybe break a cycle in your family or change your environment for your circle, or whatever the case may be – when you got to be that one, it’s like you realize that you’re only put there because you’re the one that can handle it. Because that’s the way God made it for you. So you realize that, alright, better me than you because I’m the one that can do it. I’m a better me than you could ever be, you feel me? When I hold my son I feel like, right now it’s on me. It’s on Dad to take the extras, and sometimes it’s on his mama to step up and be that- the person that has to endure it all, but one day, it’s going to be on him. And when it is, I hope he realizes that it’s not a burden. It’s an opportunity. It’s a responsibility that you’re meant for. Better Me Than You.” – Big Sean\n\n8/9 Campfire Social – They Sound the Same Underwater (Popty Ping Recording Company)\n\n“They Sound the Same Underwater, originally named The Inevitable Heat Death of The ​Universe: And Other Short Stories, is the first album by Campfire Social. At the end of 2019 the band set their sights on writing what was to be their first full ​length, only to have all plans thrown out the window by a worldwide pandemic that ​shall not be named. What they had begun to piece together would be eventually ​released as The Everything Changed EP. All things considered this ended up being a blessing in disguise, as far as the band ​are concerned, as what came next was a collection of songs that they think ‘shit all ​over’ previous tracks and having reunited with old friend and musical companion, ​Michael Deponeo, they believe Campfire Social is now what it was always meant to be.”\n\n“Every song on the album has its own place in our hearts and as a whole piece it feels ​almost autobiographical. ‘I think we just stopped caring about what people would ​think and thought more about what we wanted to say and how we wanted to achieve ​that. There are ups and ups and downs throughout the album and although we touch ​on themes of loss or general despair there is a continued sense of hope that rings ​through ‘til the end. Above all, it’s honest.’”\n\n8/9 DICE – Midnight Zoo (Tone City Records)\n\n8/9 Florence Clementine – One Mile Upstream (Preserve Artists)\n\n8/9 Louis Cole – Nothing (Brainfeeder)\n\n8/9 Mal Not Bad – This Is Your New Life (independent)\n\n“Self-produced and recorded by Mal Not Bad in their home in the Melrose District of Los Angeles, This Is Your New Life – as its title suggests – is as much a gesture to their past as it is a gateway to new beginnings. Across its twelve tracks, Mal Not Bad draws upon influence from the spiraling electronic and ambient worlds of Aphex Twin and Brian Eno to the deft songwriting nuances of Feist, David Byrne and Alex G, with its subject matter stretching across relationships — to ones we love and with ourselves, and with death and life itself, as well as reflections upon modern day communication, and ultimately pausing to observe the world around us, rather than being consumed by the chaos.” (PR)\n\n8/9 Never Ending Fall – American Disco (Create Music Group)\n\n“Never Ending Fall’s sophomore album is a radiant collection of high-energy, and at times feverish, indie rock and post-punk songs speckled with funky beats, sweltering melodies, and deep dance grooves. Among the band’s chief musical inspirations are groups like Phoenix, Two Door Cinema Club, Kings of Leon, Quarters of Change, and Turnstile. These influences can be felt throughout American Disco, as the five-piece carve out their own niche in the ever-expanding ‘indie rock’ umbrella.” – Mitch Mosk\n\nNever Ending Fall Find Reinvention Through Rock Songs on 'American Disco,' Their Irresistible Sophomore Album\n\n:: INTERVIEW ::\n\n8/9 Rae Khalil – CRYBABY (Def Jam Recordings)\n\n“Rae Khalil’s major label debut album CRYBABY showcases her dynamic ability to explore universal themes that bind over atmospheric production.” (PR)\n\n8/9 Ravyn Lenae – Bird’s Eye (Atlantic Records)\n\n8/16 Amy Shark – Sunday Sadness (Wonderlick / Sony Music Australia / RCA Records)\n\n8/16 beabadoobee – This Is How Tomorrow Moves (Dirty Hit)\n\n8/16 Charly Bliss – FOREVER (Lucky Number)\n\n8/16 Horse Jumper of Love – Disaster Trick (Run for Cover Records)\n\n8/16 KALISWAY – A Kid from Toronto (independent)\n\n“Consisting of 14 immaculately produced tracks, skipping between R&B, Funk, Hip-Hop and Soul, including focus track “Sugar,” Kalisway’s highly-anticipated album A Kid From Toronto is groovy, psychedelic and her personal definition of funk.” (PR)\n\n8/16 Lesibu Grand – Triggered (Kill Rock Stars)\n\n“Using modern sounds of celestial pop, punk, and surf rock, each song off Lesibu Grand’s debut album Triggered encapsulates the essence of our tumultuous society, weaving together threads of personal introspection and societal commentary.” (PR)\n\n8/16 Matty – POPS (Lex Records)\n\n8/16 Marlin’s Dreaming – HIRL (Ditto Music)\n\nLongtime standouts in the global indie pop scene, Marlin’s Dreaming prove that their inner flame burns brighter than ever on HIRL. They consider their fourth studio album one of change, inner (and outer) transformation – tracking personal growth as well as their own physical movement, from their home territory of Dunedin to New Zealand’s bustling capital of Auckland. To them, it’s “a complex and layered indie pop record that sparkles and shines with a studio pop gusto not seen for [some time]… Notably, it takes the layered and tender songwriting of the previous records and levels up the production to a sparkling studio pop sheen,” marking a turn as they level up their production and embrace a pop mindset.” – Mitch Mosk\n\n8/16 Maude Latour – Sugar Water (Warner Records)\n\n“Sugar Water is about growing up and learning how to lose things, people, and love— all parts of getting older. This album is an attempt at trying to hold onto the sweetness of this short life while it is still happening. It’s my most existential, deepest thoughts coated in pop music. I hope it takes you on the journey of a lifetime.” – Maude Latour\n\n8/16 Ok Cowgirl – Couldn’t Save Us From My Gut (Easy Does It Records)\n\n“The album is named Couldn’t Save Us From My Gut because this record is about me learning to listen to and trust my intuition in various contexts from leaving my first long-term relationship, to entering my first queer relationship, to coming to terms with growing apart from friends, to navigating my career in a f*d up economy. That’s the through-line, and it’s a direct lyric from the third track, ‘Our Love.'” – Leah Lavigne, Ok Cowgirl\n\n8/16 Rosie Lowe – Lover, Other (Blue Flowers Music)\n\n8/16 Tama Gucci – Notes to Self (Sinderlyn)\n\n8/16 Veronica Lewis – Too Late for Tears (Moonwink Records / Symphonic)\n\n“With this album, Boston-based, 20-year-old indie singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Veronica Lewis shows a singular vision, confidence, and stunning artistic honesty. Merging American roots rock with ’90s alt and modern indie-pop, this sonic coming-of-age odyssey reflects Veronica’s powerful vulnerability as a songwriter and musician. ‘This is about coming to terms with things we all struggle with… disillusionment, self-discovery, the beauty and flaws you find in yourself and the world around you,’ says Veronica.” (PR)\n\n8/16 Wishy – Triple Seven (Winspear)\n\n8/21 Peel Dream Magazine – Rose Main Reading Room (Top Shelf Records)\n\n“Rose Main Reading Room, the fourth full length by Peel Dream Magazine, is a lush, inviting headphones record; the kind of album made to accompany city bus rides and rainy-day solo trips to accidental destinations. The band, whose name nods to the BBC Radio 1 legend John Peel — arbiter of all things underground, quality, and (it must be said) “cool” — has since its inception been a genre-hopping experiment, jumping from motorik krautrock to shoegaze and space age pop, and their newest work is a perfect starting point for the uninitiated, beckoning toward a newfound romance and nostalgia with their catchiest collection of songs to date. Set to the backdrop of New York City and its towering landmarks — The American Museum of Natural History, Grand Central Station, and the like — songwriter Joseph Stevens weaves personal stories into the wider fabric of the natural world, touching on themes of instinct, animality, and evolution.” (PR)\n\n8/21 William Harries Graham – Annie’s House (independent)\n\n8/23 Andrew Combs – Dream Pictures (independent)\n\n“A vivid portrait of the musician and visual artist at work, Dream Pictures is a dreamy, dusky record for the quiet hours that bring each day to a close.” (PR)\n\n8/23 Closebye – Hammer of My Own (independent)\n\n8/23 Dhruv – Private Blizzard (Little Worry / RCA Records)\n\n“Recorded in Nashville with Grammy-nominated producer JT Daly (Noah Kahan, Bully, Benson Boone), Private Blizzard echoes the rollercoaster of emotions Dhruv experienced during this time as he allowed his intuition to guide him, an ebb and flow similar to the changing of the seasons. He focused on developing his vocal range to give himself a larger canvas to express these varied emotions, arriving at a sound that incorporates classic live elements but still feels modern. The end result is a debut album that feels true to Dhruv above all else.” (PR)\n\n8/23 Dutch Criminal Record – Novium (AntiFragile Music)\n\n8/23 Emily Wurramara – NARA (ABC Music)\n\n“Titled for the Anindilyakwa word meaning ‘nothing,’ NARA beckons its listeners through mystical portals on a varicoloured journey through the years since Emily Wurramara’s debut album Milyakburra (2018), tracing intense highs and lows – from winning accolades and taking her music across the world, losing her house in a fire, giving birth to her daughter and struggling with her mental health – to her ultimate arrival at peace in the knowledge that ‘It was when I had nothing, I realised I had everything.’ Expanding into weird and wonderful spaces sonically and visually without losing the organic timelessness of Wurramara’s songwriting and steeped in love for community, NARA and its twelve songs are the testament of a soul now finally at peace, making the music she wants to make, anchored by a deep love, respect and appreciation for community, family and country – always with a sense of humour and purpose.” (PR)\n\n8/23 Emma Russack – About the Girl (Dinosaur City Records)\n\n“Emma Russack’s brilliant, searching sixth record is an album about longing’s impossible force, tackling how relationships both muddle and illuminate one’s sense of self. Russack says the record is partly inspired by the dissociations brought on by dating apps. ‘It’s about the funny experiences that happen when you’re untethered,’ she says, ‘I had these awful experiences and encounters, that made me also reflect on my past experiences with different people, romantic or otherwise.’ Often, Russack sings in a daze, trying to grasp the contours of memories that have blurred. But she hauls specificity back with hard-won vigour, pasting details together and creating new constellations of understanding. In the thrall of past experience, Russack’s songwriting reaches new heights; merging plain-spoken disclosures with mordant humour. History’s constant murmur is felt through the record’s spectral, spacious sound, full of elegant harmonies, heavily strummed guitar and ominous synths that reverberate and splutter.” (PR)\n\n8/23 Fontaines D.C. – Romance (XL Recordings)\n\n8/23 Fruition – How To Make Mistakes (independent)\n\n“How To Make Mistakes is the beloved Portland, Oregon band’s first album in four years, with a different recording approach this time around. The album was co-produced by the band, and everything was recorded live on the floor in the studio – both firsts for the quintet. The new song captures their raw, heartfelt sound and 15-year journey together, blemishes and all. How To Make Mistakes is a melting pot of rock, soul, folk, and pop with its combination of soaring vocal harmonies and collaborative, song-driven Americana. You should’ve received download and stream links to the album already, but I also included them below again for convenience.” (PR)\n\n8/23 Geneva Jacuzzi – Triple Fire (Dais Records)\n\n8/23 GIFT – Illuminator (Captured Tracks)\n\n8/23 Gilligan Moss – Speaking Across Time (Foreign Family Collective)\n\n“With their new album Speaking Across Time, Gilligan Moss — the Brooklyn-based electronic duo of childhood friends Ben + Evan — have created a swirling and expansive survey of 90s rave, old country, pastoral house, and vintage soul. Gilligan Moss say that it ‘explores how creation and collaboration change over time — and how music can outlast us.'” (PR)\n\n8/23 Illuminati Hotties – Power (Hopeless Records)\n\n“Power is not a grief record. It is not a love record, either. Instead, it is a real-life record, a reflection of all the things Tudzin has endured or enjoyed during the too-long span since Illuminati Hotties’ wonderfully infectious last batch. Sadness, joy, and the busyness of modern existence are all bound into these 13 songs, characters and circumstances sometimes exaggerated not just for effect but to offer a modest buffer between Sarah Tudzin’s world and those inside of her words.” (PR)\n\n8/23 Jordan Lindley – Maybe It’ll All Work Out (independent)\n\n“With his sophomore album, most of which produced by Jake Finch and Collin Pastore (boygenius, Lucy Dacus, Illuminati Hotties), singer/songwriter Jordan Lindley presents a collection of songs that collectively highlight the internal realities of everyday life, with an emphasis on the subtle middle ground between emotional extremes that everyone experiences. When discussing the album, Lindley says, ‘I have made the most intentional effort I’ve ever made to keep the throughline consistent. The way we receive and feel emotions is weird and unconventional. On paper, we know that death is sad, love is happy, upticks are easy, etc. But, like, what a crock. Sometimes death is a guilt-ridden relief, sometimes love is confusing and sucks ass, and sometimes upticks are the most riddled with insecurity and fear. I want to explore the genuine feelings – good, bad, funny, shitty, odd – because I truly, whole-heartedly believe that in doing so, life will unfold into something so much more unexpectedly beautiful than we could ever have planned.’” (PR)\n\n8/23 Lee DeWyze – Gone for Days (independent)\n\n“On his most personal and vulnerable album, Gone for Days, Lee DeWyze blends his skills as a songwriter with masterful musicianship by roots royalty (including members of Union Station such as Barry Bales and Tim Stafford, and Grammy-nominated Cellist and Compose Dave Eggar. The skilled songwriter with more than seventy sync credits in film and television, gives listeners a place to escape and creates a vulnerability to open emotional doors, something DeWyze knows much about. In his most personal and introspective record to date, DeWyze touches on themes such as self-exploration and the spectrum of life’s possible outcomes. DeWyze shares, ‘This album was emotional for me to write, and so it was really important that you could feel the emotion on this album and that it sounded that way as well. I wanted those two thins to go hand in hand. I wanted it to sound how it feels.'”\n\n8/23 lovelytheband – lovelytheband (happy accident records / Vydia)\n\n8/23 Luna Li – When a Thought Grows Wings (In Real Life / AWAL)\n\n8/23 M.A.G.S. – Creator (Smartpunk Records)\n\n“M.A.G.S. is the solo moniker for Buffalo-bred multi-disciplinary artist Elliott Douglas. His style seamlessly glides between genres ─ from funky garage rock to minty alt-pop with a punk-inspired energy. The release of his third full-length album Destroyer in 2023 via Smartpunk Records pushed Douglas into a more textural direction, dripping with flavors of post-punk while keeping his genre-bending melodies. Written by Douglas and produced by Jay Mass (Defeater), the album is about having to destroy yourself in order to grow and move forward – an extremely relatable phase in one’s life.” (PR)\n\n8/23 Montell Fish – Charlotte (Virgin Music)\n\n8/23 The National Parks – Wild Spirit (independent)\n\n8/23 Oh He Dead – Ugly (Wally Baba Records)\n\n8/23 Sabrina Carpenter – Short N’ Sweet (Island Records)\n\n8/23 Sam Weber – Clear + Plain (Sonic Unyon Records)\n\n“Sam Weber’s Clear + Plain is a group of simple and beautiful folk and jazz inflected songs which lean into sensory experiences and underscore Weber’s values. Clear + Plain came together in 2021, 99% of the record recorded in just three days. Weber collaborated with bandmates Griffin Goldsmith, Mal Hauser and Garret Lang, co-producing the record with Hauser. It is by far the favourite record that Sam has made, with a naturalism and beauty to it that speaks to the work of a songwriter who has found a new degree of depth within the creative process.” (PR)\n\n8/23 SOFI TUKKER – BREAD (independent)\n\n8/23 Spring Silver – don’t you think it’s strange?

Seeking the catharsis of self-expression, she withdrew to her home studio. Emerging from this unfettered creative period, Stevens had completed Maple to Paper: A glimpse into her most private moments of grief and transcendence, rendered with devotion to music’s alchemical powers. Maple to Paper is Stevens’ first entirely solo acoustic record. Recorded live with no overdubs and mixed by frequent collaborator Nic Hard, the album features a stripped-down sound rooted in her spellbinding guitar work and raw yet luminous vocal performance.” (PR)\n\n8/30 Bench Press – Personal Best (Poison City Records)\n\n“Bench Press’s third album Personal Best continues to meditate on themes of self and mental health lyrically but through a new lens, as the album follows Stavrakis’ journey of making a career change into mental health social work. Where Jack Stavrakis has previously dwelled on the politics of personal action, he now looks outwards and critiques what and who he sees in our increasingly chaotic world.” (PR)\n\n8/30 David Kushner – Dichotomy (Miserable Music Group / Virgin Records)\n\n“David Kushner’s debut album delves into the tapestry of human existence by exploring two contrasts. Comprising 17 songs, this musical work examines the interplay between light and darkness, happiness and sadness, anger and love, hero and villains, and the dichotomy of our inner demons and angels. Through a fusion of introspective lyrics, David Kushner captures the essence of emotional experiences, providing connection from all walks of life.” (PR)\n\n8/30 Kid Dakota – Praegustator (Graveface Records)\n\n“Kid Dakota’s seventh album showcases the creative talents of original frontman Darren Jackson and new drummer Lars Oslund, who have further refined the lush, orchestrated sound that marked their last two albums, “Denervation” and “Age of Roaches.” Not for the faint of heart, this dark, brooding album delves into themes of alienation, addiction, inequality, and environmental catastrophe. Praegustator is both innovative and fresh while staying true to Kid Dakota’s Art Rock/Alternative roots. The sound evokes a comforting nostalgia yet feels entirely new.” (PR)\n\n8/30 Leyya – Half Asleep (INK Music)\n\n“Self-reflection due to inner turbulence defines Leyya’s upcoming album, Half Asleep. The process of recognising and gaining self-awareness runs through the album like a common thread, and with titles such as ‘I Don’t Hug So Well’, ‘Ease My Mind’, or ‘Sometimes You’re Lonely’, this proves self-explanatory. Despite the record’s self-effacing modesty, Half Asleep was written without preconception. It was inspired by lived experiences, favourite songs and sounds, the wheel of human emotion, and the art of music making “’cause it’s fun.” Every sound, sample or lick has been lovingly crafted and is harmoniously organic, contrary to the fast-moving circumstances and conventional production methods. Egoless but stubborn, Half Asleep shows a new kind of honesty and openness circulating between digital and analogue, as the band share their experience of how healing it can be to return to oneself.” (PR)\n\n8/30 Los Bitchos – Talkie Talkie (City Slang)\n\n8/30 Marianas Trench – Haven (604 Records / Warner Music Canada)\n\n“Since their inaugural album Fix Me, Marianas Trench have always continued to evolve, and with Haven, the Vancouver-based four-piece pushes the envelope and takes their musical and thematic efforts to new heights. The album showcases that at the core Marianas Trench is a take-no-prisoners, four-piece rock band featuring singer, songwriter and producer Josh Ramsay’s expansive vocal range, and Haven adds exciting layers of synthesizer and orchestral elements.”\n\n“Haven is inspired by Joseph Campbell’s scholarly book, The Hero’s Journey, which defines the arc of virtually every quest narrative. ‘The more of a deep dive I did into the book, the more I was in awe of how much it applied to every story,’ says Marianas Trench singer, songwriter, and producer Josh Ramsay. He added that each of the songs on Haven is inspired by the plot points Campbell defines as commonalities in every hero’s journey. The result is a narrative sequence of thirteen tracks based on the framework of the book, and like previous Marianas Trench albums is extremely broad in scope.” (PR)\n\n8/30 Mondo Cozmo – It’s PRINCIPLE! (Last Gang Records)\n\n“Mondo Cozmo’s fourth studio album is his most complete and vulnerable body of work. Instead of an ending, it marks a new beginning. Not many artists are fortunate to successfully hit the reset button. Yet, that’s exactly what It’s PRINCIPLE is: An artist, who has been through it, taking a big swing and connecting with an album he believes he made for himself but it would be nice if others like it too.” (PR)\n\n8/30 Sima Cunningham – High Roller (Ruination Record Co.)\n\n8/30 Valley – Water the Flowers, Pray for a Garden (Capitol Records / Universal Music Canada)\n\n8/30 Why Bonnie – Wish On The Bone (Fire Talk)\n\n“When Why Bonnie recorded their debut 90 in November, they set out to make a country album, aligning their respective technical instincts with the genre trappings. With Wish on the Bone, Blair Howerton had no interest in adhering to genre standards. Howerton, Chance Williams, and Josh Malett fleshed out these songs with help from Jonathan Schenke, who co-produced alongside Howerton. ‘Personal experience of learning to be bolder and more assertive and trusting myself has carried over into my music. I’m not afraid to take risks,’ Howerton says. Although Wish on the Bone is untethered from the particulars of landscape or genre, its fixation on what it might look like to lead an authentic life grounds the record in place. With Wish on the Bone, Howerton is wide-eyed and waiting, reminding herself, even on the worst days, that despair is not inevitable.” (PR)\n\n8/30 Wunderhorse – Midas (Communion / Mick Music)\n\n“Midas adopts an unpolished recording process which captures the visceral atmosphere of Wunderhorse’s lauded live performances and establishes the band as one of the most exciting new UK artists. Of the album, frontman Jacob Slater explains, ‘When we first went into the studio to make this record, the only thing we were sure about is how we wanted it to sound; very imperfect, very live, very raw; no frills. We wanted it to sound like your face is pressed up against the amplifiers, like you’ve been locked inside the bass drum.'” (PR)\n\nSeptember 2024\n\n9/3 Cheridomingo – Shapeshift (independent)\n\n9/3 Rachel Platten – I Am Rachel Platten (independent)\n\n“This record emerges from Platten’s own struggles with mental health – depression, chronic pain, and how she dug herself out of the hole she fell into.

A Billboard Hot 100 hitmaker who has worked with superstars like Olivia Rodrigo, Justin Bieber, and Leon Bridges, won an Album of the Year GRAMMY for her work on Harry Styles’ Harry’s House, and was nominated for the inaugural Songwriter of the Year award, Allen showcases a new dimension of her one-of-a-kind artistry on his record. Centered on a gorgeously composed and endlessly unpredictable form of indie-rock, with inspiration ranging from Cocteau Twins to John Prine, Amy Allen introduces an essential new artist whose music you didn’t know you already loved.” (PR)\n\n9/6 Ashe – Willson (Mom+Pop)\n\n9/6 Claude Fountaine – La Mer (Innovative Leisure)\n\n9/6 David Gilmour – Luck and Strange (Sony Music)\n\n“Luck and Strange was recorded over five months in Brighton and London and is Gilmour’s first album of new material in nine years. The record was produced by David and Charlie Andrew, best known for his work with alt-J and Marika Hackman. The album features nine tracks, including the beautiful reworking of The Montgolfier Brothers’ 1999 song, ‘Between Two Points’ which features 22-year-old Romany Gilmour on vocals and harp, the lead-off track from the album, ‘The Piper’s Call’ and the title track which features the late Pink Floyd keyboard player Richard Wright, recorded in 2007 at a jam in a barn at David’s house.

(Domino Records)\n\n“When the chaotic South London rabble known as Fat Dog formed, they made two rules: they were going to be a healthy band who looked after themselves and there would be no saxophone presence in their music. Two simple edicts to live by, and two things long-since broken by the Brixton five-piece. Fat Dog are the most exciting breakthrough band of the past few years, conjurers of the sort of frenzied and wild live shows not seen in the capital for years and now the creators of WOOF., a brilliant and mind-bending debut album, but they are not healthy. One of them has a foot odour problem. And they also have a saxophone player in the line-up.” (PR)\n\n9/6 Fred again.. – ten days (Warner Music)\n\n“My new record is called ten days.​ It’s ten songs about ten days. There’s been a lot of biggg mad crazy moments in the last year but basically all of these are about really very small quiet intimate moments.” – Fred again..\n\n9/6 Gooseberry – All My Friends Are Cattle (independent)\n\n“All My Friends Are Cattle represents Gooseberry’s most ambitious project yet, showcasing the expansive distance they cover, from punch-you-in-the-mouth punk rock to lyrically-driven singer-songwriter to atmospheric prog rock. Though powered by heavy 90s alternative influences, this LP showcases what Gooseberry can be: an exciting amalgamation of many genres and sounds, taking the listener on a journey that never once leaves the ear tired and consistently keeps the mind guessing where they will head next.” (PR)\n\n9/6 Hinds – VIVA HINDS (Lucky Number)\n\n9/6 HONNE – OUCH (Smile More Recordings / AWAL)\n\n9/6 The Howl & The Hum – Same Mistake Twice (Miserable Disco)\n\n“Across The Howl & The Hum’s second album Same Mistake Twice, Sam Griffiths confronts the pain and chaos of recent tumultuous years across 12 tracks of his most direct songwriting to date. Surviving the breakup of his band, the global pandemic and reckoning with his future in music, he points the spotlight directly at the anxiety involved in any breakup we experience: how am I perceived? How do people speak about me? How will I be remembered? Am I a good person? The album traverses the raw harshness of Neutral Milk Hotel as much as the unblinking self-reflection of country pioneers like John Prine or Townes Van Zandt. Throughout, Griffiths’ voice is acrobatic and powerfully emotive, even while singing about the most vulnerable of topics. Effortlessly veering between gravelly introspection to soaring falsetto, it is a unifying counterpoint to his themes of anxiety and dread.” (PR)\n\n9/6 Jamie Sutherland – The World As It Used to Be (Frictionless Music)\n\n“Having grown up listening to the likes of Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and the Everly Brothers, acclaimed Scottish musician Jamie Sutherland has always had an affinity with the Greenwich Village scene of New York and the songwriters synonymous with the area. With time away from Broken Records during the pandemic, he began writing songs with focus on the melody and lyrics, growing from a collection of stripped-back bare-bones songs to a beautiful and classic-sounding album. The result is his second solo record, The World As It Used To Be. With mixing carried out by Tony Doogan (who has worked with Broken Records on numerous occasions) and mastering by Frank Arkwright at Abbey Road Studios, the tone of the record is one that Jamie feels remains true to where the songs came from.” (PR)\n\n9/6 Mercury Rev – Born Horses (Bella Union)\n\n9/6 Midwife – No Depression in Heaven (The Flenser)\n\n“Midwife’s fourth studio album No Depression In Heaven explores themes of sentimentality, the interplay between dreams, memory, and fantasy, and a familiar subject seen throughout all of Midwife’s work: Grief. Madeline Johnston takes a look at the tender and transcendent underneath the hard exterior of leather and studs, exposing a different side of the heavy music scene, where Johnston’s project has been living and evolving. Inspired by ephemeral moments that make up life on tour, the totemization of vehicles, outlaws, and the psyche of America’s underbelly, No Depression In Heaven affirms Johnston’s existential status as a woman of the highway.” (PR)\n\n9/6 MJ Lenderman – Manning Fireworks (ANTI- Records)\n\n“Manning Fireworks is an instant classic of an LP. MJ lets us in on his frank observations on the intersection of wit and sadness. The punchlines from his previous albums are still here, as are the rusted-wire guitar solos that have made him a favorite for indie rock fans looking for an emerging guitar hero. But there’s a new sincerity, too, as Lenderman lets listeners clearly see the world through his warped lens.” (PR)\n\n9/6 Public Opinion – Painted on Smile (Convulse Records)\n\n9/6 Sarah Kinsley – ESCAPER (Verve Records)\n\n9/6 Shovels & Rope – Something Is Working Up Above My Head (Dualtone Records)\n\n“Less is more has always been the approach for the husband-and-wife duo of Cary Ann Hearst and Michael Trent in their incendiary live shows, and many of their recordings. From the stage, the two of them alone can sound like a raucous full band one moment or create an intimate, moving moment that commands the full attention of an audience the next. Less is more is truly fitting on Shovels & Rope’s latest album. The two decided to simplify their recording process by only using instrumentation they can replicate live, as opposed to changing the arrangements to fit the live performance. Something Is Working Up Above My Head finds Shovels & Rope leaning into their rock and punk roots that have always been a part of their sound. Hearst and Trent are, at their core, songwriters and great storytellers. Their character-driven narratives and vivid, cinematic vignettes of flawed protagonists who are often derailed by their shortcomings are as present as ever.” (PR)\n\n9/6 Wayne Graham – Bastion (Hickman Holler Records/Thirty Tigers)\n\n“Bastion, Wayne Graham’s ninth studio album, is a sonic shift embracing their Appalachian roots, but bursting forward into indie rock sounds, from wall of sound guitars to listless shuffled rhythms, and sprinkled with avant garde and jazz influences. The album explores themes of the meaning of home, and the feeling of no longer belonging to a place you grew up in. Wayne Graham comprises brothers Kenny and Hayden Miles, as well as José Oreta and Germany-based instrumentalist Ludwig Bauer.”\n\n“On their ninth studio album, the band welcome a sense of looseness, unraveling and a touch of the avant-garde as they continue to shift the New Appalachian movement forward with this seminal work, shaped by tradition (hymns, high and lonesome) but intent on breaking boundaries in the sonic landscape by experimenting with synths, production work and unexpected instruments like clarinets. Their songs crackle with energy, using folk and country as a foundation for fearless explorations of jazz, punk, soul, noise, classic rock, and modern classical.” (PR)\n\n9/12 Drew Holcomb & The Neighbors – Strangers No More Volume Two (Magnolia Music)\n\n9/13 Albin Lee Meldau – Discomforts (Mayfly / Glassnote)\n\n9/13 Beau – Girl Cried Wolf (Immortal Records)\n\n9/13 BONES UK – SOFT (Sumerian Records)\n\n“Unapologetically rebellious and GRAMMY-nominated duo BONES UK return with a visceral, anthemic take on their future-rock mélange of swaggering guitars, gritty electronics, and love-yourself / think-for-yourself lyrics. SOFT‘s eleven tracks are bound by through-lines of massive hooks, bold stylistic cocktails, and empowering lyrics that also include collaborations with Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins and Mike Schuman of Queens of the Stone Age.” (PR)\n\n9/13 Chance Peña – Ever-Shifting, Continual Blossoming (ONErpm)\n\n“Chance Peña’s debut album sees the rising artist exploring themes of personal growth, overcoming internal struggles, and finding strength in hard times. Peña also delves into the universal complexities of relationships and the longing for deeper connections. The album, which was co-produced by Chance, Naebird and Sarcastic Sounds, was written over the course of the last year. ‘This project is a glimpse into the lessons I’ve learned over this last year and I’ve been excited about these songs for a while now. I’m really just ready to share these pieces of me with those who listen and to play them live on these upcoming tours,’ says Chance.” (PR)\n\n9/13 COIN – I’m Not Afraid of Music Anymore (10K Projects)\n\n“The new album finds the band in their most vulnerable state and continuing to push the boundaries of alternative pop without straying from their trademark dynamic energy. It’s bright, bittersweet, electric, intimate and a record fans new and old can embrace open heartedly. After thinking they were out of stories to tell, songs to shape, I’m Not Afraid of Music Anymore suggests that COIN have unlocked not a new chapter in their existence but an entire new volume, with more depth than they’ve ever shared before.” (PR)\n\n9/13 Dayglow – DAYGLOW (Republic Records)\n\n“When I was 18 years old, I made my mixtape Fuzzybrain. I was a pretty introverted kid from a reasonably small town in Texas, so I didn’t expect much to happen ‘commercially’ for the record—I just made it for my own enjoyment, really. As a fan of the 2010’s indie music scene (MGMT, The Strokes, Phoenix, Passion Pit, etc.), I wanted to see what kind of album I could make completely alone in my bedroom. So, out of the quest to make something I loved, Dayglow was born. It was a clear reflection of myself at that time. It was pure, naive, goofy, guitar-driven indie-pop made to be played live by a 5-piece band (that I didn’t even have yet). Since then, I’ve fully become Dayglow, and my world has become an odd culmination of everything I didn’t think I’d ever have. But I still feel like I haven’t properly introduced myself. So with this new album, I view it as a debut. Self titled, big shabang. The past three records have shown who I was growing up, who my influences were, who I was when I was a kid, so they felt more like mixtapes. Dayglow is finally entering the world in its purest form with clarity and confidence. I want this album to define exactly what Dayglow looks like, sounds like, and feels like.” – Dayglow\n\n9/13 DEADLETTER – Hysterical Strength (SO Recordings)\n\n“The world is brutal but there are cherry trees in blossom. This is the philosophy that underpins DEADLETTER, and their bruising, beautiful debut album, Hysterical Strength. ‘It’s punishing but there’s also f*ing beauty out there,’ explains frontman Zac Lawrence, who, with life-long friends Alfie Husband and George Ullyott, and Poppy Richler, Sam Jones and Will King, may just have turned in one of 2024’s most urgent and vital listens – a record that, right down to its title, relishes the contradictions of modern life. “Being able to take something disgusting or disgraceful and make it sound nice through the power of music, that juxtaposition appeals to me,” Lawrence adds. The result is twelve tracks of motorik rhythms and angular guitars, adorned by smoky saxophone and baritone-belted lyrics about flickering television sets and dilapidated town centres decked with decapitated bodies. Its strengths are hysterical indeed.” (PR)\n\n9/13 Divine Sweater – A Time for Everything (Better Company Records)\n\n“Divine Sweater’s fourth LP A Time for Everything is a record of ends and beginnings, meditating on one’s ability to deal with mortality, loss, and grief, and having the strength to reset and come out stronger on the other end. The deceivingly upbeat and breathtaking collection of shimmering indie-pop, features production by Better Company honcho and San Fermin founder Allen Tate. Fearlessly honest and strapped with sonic influences spanning Haim, Alvvays, First Aid Kit and Angel Olsen, the notably darker subject matter of A Time for Everything represents Divine Sweater’s immersion into uncertain realms, achieving catharsis through the process as they wrestled with mortality. A Time for Everything is a documentation of death and renewal, cataloging the personal changes that take place as the world’s axis continues to shift from under us.” (PR)\n\n9/13 Foreign Fields – What It Cost (Nettwerk Music Group)\n\n“Foreign Fields’ fourth album What It Cost is an ode to the many layers of love Brian Holl and Eric Hillman have saved for those they choose to spend their days, years, and lives alongside while exploring and then answering what a band-led version of Foreign Fields might sound like. ‘We hadn’t written about the people in our lives in a while,’ Brian explains. ‘Previously, everything had been quite conceptual. From the get-go, we intended to break that apart with this one.'” (PR)\n\n9/13 Fousheé – Pointy Heights (RCA Records)\n\n“The LP shares its name with the land her grandfather purchased in Jamaica, with the intention that her whole family could build homes and live there. With Pointy Heights, Fousheé zigs out of the frenetic R&B-punk of her acclaimed previous album, softCORE, as she paints an entirely new sonic palette. Playing the part of singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer, we enter a world shaped by her home, where old school, indie Reggae, rhythms buoy dance-friendly melodies and a natural cool that makes her the go-to collaborator for today’s biggest artists. The album is a 180 by an artist who makes genres feel like quaint ideas of a bygone era. In Pointy Heights, Fousheé makes an entirely new sound, an effortlessly bold move from an artist who has created one of the most adventurous, melodically resonant records of the year.”\n\n“Pointy Heights is rich with crackling bass lines, spangly guitar parts, and rollicking, sharp drum sounds, all anchored by the next level songwriting that has defined Fousheé since her first project – time machine – was released three years ago. Her songwriting prowess has made her one of the most sought-after collaborators of the last few years, collaborating with Childish Gambino’s Donald Glover, Steve Lacy, Teezo Touchdown, Lil Yachty, and more.” (PR)\n\n9/13 Gia Ford – Transparent Things (Chrysalis Records)\n\n9/13 Hataałii – Waiting for a Sign (Dangerbird Records)\n\n“As Hataałii metes out his careful, artful lyrics that revel in uncanny particularities and the desire to know the unknowable, Waiting for a Sign recalls the gothic pop of Echo & The Bunnymen (“Something’s In The Air”), the grubby beauty of Silver Jews (“Alex Jones”), and the softer sonics from Spacemen 3 (“Burn”), all conveying an atmosphere of mystery and melancholy amid a mirage of short stories.” (PR)\n\n9/13 Hello Mary – Emita Ox (Frenchkiss Records)\n\n“On Emita Ox, Hello Mary push harder into heavy distortion and psychedelic dreamscapes, as they build out their singular universe of gutsy strain of rock. The LP’s labyrinthine production reflects how the band’s musical tastes have expanded from Elliott Smith and Radiohead to encompass experimental post-rock acts like Black Midi and Swans. Featuring songs that span from 2018 to 2023, Emita Ox is also a document of Hello Mary’s past five years together growing up as bandmates and their arrival into young adulthood.” (PR)\n\n9/13 HYPER GAL – After Image (SKiN GRAFT Records)\n\n“Springing from Osaka, Japan’s cultural center and historical heart, comes HYPER GAL, a two-piece band consisting of visual artist Koharu Ishida on vocals and noise artist Kurumi Kadoya on drums. The minimalist duo make maximum impact – stripping music down beyond the bare essentials, to create shimmering, no wave pop from blast beat drums, glittery keyboard loops and ethereal bubblegum vocals – laced with velvet and firecrackers. On After Image HYPER GAL hold fast to their limited palette, but expand their reach. Working with a canvas larger than ever before, the band fearlessly alternate bold, avant-garde strokes with intimate, deliberate gestures. The result is a new world awash in a sea of"
