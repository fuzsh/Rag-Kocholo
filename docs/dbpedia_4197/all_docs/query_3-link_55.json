        "text": "The Irish artist has signed to Nettwerk Music Group, and released a new song.\n\nThe Irish music polymath James Vincent McMorrow has released his first new single since his 2022 album The Less I Knew, and announces signing to Nettwerk Music for future releases.\n\n‘Stay Cool’ is an acoustic reset of a track, recorded in a single take unadorned from production methods.\n\n“I have lived the last few years amongst a span of trees. There was something comforting in hiding, but it was obscuring the places I wanted to go, and it was obscuring me,. Dor me, the winter is when things begin. All the songs and records I’m most proud of have either been created or released during the winter months. You’ll listen to this song and hopefully know what it’s about, emerging from trees, trying to be open again.”\n\nMcMorrow produced The Scratch’s most recent album.\n\nA planned album called Heavyweight Champion of Dublin 8 was due to be released in 2022 but wasn’t released in the end.\n\nJames Vincent McMorrow\n\nInstagram | Facebook | YouTube | Tik Tok"
