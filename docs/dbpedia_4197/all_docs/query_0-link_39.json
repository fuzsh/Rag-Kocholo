        "text": "Brandkommando: 1989\n\nBy Vito Camarretta(@) - More reviews by Vito Camarretta\n\nArtist: Brandkommando (@)\n\nTitle: 1989\n\nFormat: CD + Download\n\nLabel: Zoharum (http://zoharum.com/) (@)\n\nRated:\n\nPower electronics isn’t a genre for the masses, and BRANDKOMMANDO’s \"1989\" is no exception. The album, released by Zoharum in January 2023, immerses listeners in the dark, oppressive world of Romania’s 1989 revolution. This isn’t just music — it’s a sonic documentary of terror, revolt, and the raw, ugly mechanics of a totalitarian regime collapsing in on itself.\n\nBRANDKOMMANDO, a leading force in Polish power electronics, has always excelled at channeling socio-political anger into abrasive, challenging soundscapes. With \"1989\", Karol Wachowski (the man behind this project's curtains) has crafted a concept album that dives deep into the turmoil of Nicolae Ceauescu’s Romania, capturing the brutality and desperation of that period with an unflinching gaze.\n\nFrom the opening title track, \"1989\", you’re thrust into a cauldron of harsh noise and distorted vocals, a relentless assault on the senses that reflects the chaos of revolution. This track sets the tone for the rest of the album, establishing an atmosphere of suffocating tension and paranoia. It's a four-minute introduction to a soundscape that feels like it could crumble under its own weight at any moment—a perfect reflection of the state apparatus in its death throes.\n\n\"Soarele Carpatilor\", the second track, intensifies the dread with a grinding, mechanical rhythm that evokes the drudgery and fear of life under Ceauescu. The title, meaning \"The Sun of the Carpathians\", ironically refers to Ceauescu’s grandiose self-stylization. The track’s sinister undertones and relentless drive mirror the oppressive nature of a regime that demanded adoration while instilling terror.\n\n\"Teroare\", the album's centerpiece, is a nine-minute descent into aural horror. Here, BRANDKOMMANDO pulls no punches, layering samples, screams, and noise to create an overwhelming sense of dread. It’s an audio depiction of the fear that gripped the nation as the Securitate, Ceauescu’s feared secret police, attempted to crush dissent. The track builds and builds, refusing release, much like the inexorable rise of revolutionary fervor in Romania.\n\nThe final track, \"Securitate\", is a 15-minute epic that stands as a brutal reminder of the machinery of oppression. The track’s length and oppressive soundscapes reflect the omnipresent surveillance and repression that characterized the Securitate. Yet, in its relentless drive, there is a hint of the inevitability of collapse — a slow, grinding inevitability that finally came to fruition with the execution of Ceauescu and his wife.\n\nMusically, \"1989\" is a difficult listen, but then, it’s meant to be. BRANDKOMMANDO has a reputation for delivering some of the most potent and politically charged power electronics in the scene, and \"1989\" only solidifies that standing. The album’s focus on Romania’s revolution is a natural fit for the project, blending historical narrative with the visceral impact of harsh noise to create a work that is as intellectually challenging as it is emotionally overwhelming.\n\nIn comparison to other artists in the power electronics and industrial scene, BRANDKOMMANDO’s approach on \"1989\" feels particularly focused and intense. While artists like Genocide Organ or Prurient might explore similar sonic territories, \"1989\" stands out for its thematic cohesion and historical specificity. It’s a stark reminder of the power of this genre to not just reflect but to interrogate history through sound.\n\nUltimately, \"1989\" is a harrowing, yet essential listen for those who appreciate power electronics with a purpose. It’s an album that not only documents but also forces us to engage with the darkest aspects of human history. In doing so, BRANDKOMMANDO has created a work that, like the revolution it portrays, leaves a lasting impact.\n\nWhalesong: Leaving A Dream\n\nBy Vito Camarretta(@) - More reviews by Vito Camarretta\n\nArtist: Whalesong (@)\n\nTitle: Leaving A Dream\n\nFormat: CDx2 (double CD)\n\nLabel: Zoharum (http://zoharum.com/) (@)\n\nRated:\n\nWhalesong, the elusive musical entity from Tarnowskie Góry, has once again defied categorization with their third studio album, \"Leaving A Dream\". Released on July 14, 2023, through Zoharum in collaboration with Old Temple, this monumental work spans over 120 minutes and occupies two CDs. It is an album that beckons listeners into a sonic world where genres blur, emotions collide, and the line between dream and reality is perpetually in flux.\n\nFrom the first unsettling notes of \"Enter\", Whalesong plunges the listener into an auditory landscape that is both hypnotic and treacherous. The music builds like molten lava beneath a seemingly dormant volcano—slow, simmering, and full of latent power. The tension escalates, sounds swirl together in an ever-tightening spiral, only to retreat at the brink of eruption, offering fleeting moments of calm before plunging back into the chaos. This is music that embodies contradiction: raw yet refined, chaotic yet meticulously crafted, harsh yet laced with unexpected beauty.\n\nWhalesong’s music has always been resistant to easy classification, and \"Leaving A Dream\" is no exception. The band pulls from a dizzying array of influences—industrial, noise rock, drone, jazz, post-rock — while managing to transcend them all. The album doesn’t merely flirt with different genres; it engages in a full-on dialogue with them, twisting and transforming familiar elements into something uniquely its own. Unlike some experimental acts that merely mimic their influences, Whalesong uses them as tools to carve out a sound that is as original as it is unmistakable.\n\nThe band’s lineup is as eclectic as their sound. Micha Kiebasa, the mastermind behind Whalesong, is a sonic architect of the highest order, layering vocals, guitars, and an arsenal of unconventional instruments — theremin, hammered dulcimer, tubular bells, and even circular saws—into a dense, immersive tapestry. His fellow band members, Grzegorz Zawadzki (drums, percussion) and Piotr Dziemski (guitars), along with vocalist Elise Aranguren, form a tight, intuitive collective that thrives on the unpredictable. Yet, the album’s true richness comes from the impressive roster of guest musicians, including Attila Csihar (SUNN O))), Mayhem), Steve Blanco (Imperial Triumphant), and Wukir Suryadi (Senyawa), among others. These collaborations bring new dimensions to Whalesong's sound, adding layers of depth and complexity that make the album an almost overwhelming sensory experience.\n\nTracks like \"Leaving A Dream\" and \"We Have Never Really Lived\" showcase the band's ability to weave intricate narratives out of sound. These are not mere songs; they are epic sagas told through a fusion of noise, melody, and rhythm. The former feels like a melancholic reflection on the ephemeral nature of existence, with each note tinged with a sense of longing. The latter, by contrast, is an existential battle cry, a defiant declaration that resonates with the primal need to find meaning in a world teetering on the brink of chaos.\n\nThe album’s grand finale, \"From The Ashes\" and \"shekissedmewithhervenomouslips\", push the boundaries of what music can achieve, stretching past the twenty-minute mark without ever losing focus. These compositions are a testament to the band’s refusal to be constrained by conventional song structures. Instead, they allow the music to evolve organically, leading the listener on a journey through soundscapes that are as disorienting as they are captivating.\n\nIn \"Leaving A Dream\", Whalesong has created something truly monumental. It is an album that resists easy listening, demanding full immersion from its audience in spite of the apparently unfathomable thickness of its huge walls of noises. Yet, for those willing to surrender to its pull, it offers a deeply rewarding experience — one that lingers long after the final notes have faded. This is music that can potentially leave an indelible mark on all who encounter it.\n\nDaniele Martini Quartet: Impermanent\n\nBy Vito Camarretta(@) - More reviews by Vito Camarretta\n\nArtist: Daniele Martini Quartet\n\nTitle: Impermanent\n\nFormat: CD\n\nLabel: el Negocito (@)\n\nRated:\n\nSometimes, albums slip through the cracks, not because they’re forgettable, but because they demand a more considered approach—a time to marinate in their complexities before one can even attempt to articulate their impact. *Impermanent* by the Daniele Martini Quartet is one such album, and while this review may be fashionably late to the party, it’s a record that refuses to let go until it’s properly understood. If you also consider that the cat managed to take and hide it for a long time in the basket of his toys...\n\nBy the way, when we talk about \"Impermanent\", the title might suggest something fleeting, but the reality is quite the opposite. This album’s impact is durable and lasting, as it gracefully weaves through contemporary jazz with an adventurous spirit. Saxophonist Daniele Martini leads this journey, surrounded by a trio of remarkable talents: Bram De Looze on piano, Manolo Cabras on double bass, and João Lobo on drums. Together, they navigate through a spectrum of emotions and styles, creating a work that’s as cohesive as it is unpredictable.\n\nThe album opens with “For Those Who Stay”, a track that lulls you into a contemplative state with its delicate balance of melancholy and hope. Martini’s saxophone drifts over De Looze’s gentle piano, while Cabras and Lobo provide a rhythm that’s as steady as it is subtle. It’s a conversation of sorts, where each instrument knows when to lead and when to listen—a skill that defines the quartet’s dynamic throughout the album.\n\nBut don’t be lulled into thinking that \"Impermanent\" is all soft edges and quiet reflection. The title track, \"Impermanent\", jolts the listener awake with its rhythmic complexities and sharp turns. It’s a track that demands attention, much like the entire album, revealing new layers with each listen. Martini and his bandmates navigate these twists and turns with precision, making the track a highlight of the album.\n\n“Cells” pushes the envelope even further, with Martini’s saxophone taking on a more confrontational tone. There’s a rawness here that challenges the listener, a refusal to settle into easy patterns or predictable melodies. Yet, the track never descends into chaos; instead, it’s anchored by the quartet’s impeccable sense of structure and direction.\n\n“Auroshika” offers a breath of calm after the intensity of “Cells”. Here, Martini’s saxophone takes on a more tender tone, floating above the delicate interplay of the other instruments. It’s a moment of quiet beauty, where the quartet’s cohesion shines through in every note. The track exemplifies the album’s ability to move seamlessly between moods, showcasing the versatility and depth of the musicians.\n\n“Fang Song Song” continues this reflective mood, with a slow, deliberate build that recalls the best of Miles Davis — not in sound, but in its patient, unhurried approach to thematic development. The track unfolds like a story, each phrase carefully considered, leading to a conclusion that feels both inevitable and satisfying.\n\nThe album closes with “Born Work Sad Happy”, a track that encapsulates the quartet’s unique blend of emotional depth and technical brilliance. It’s a fitting end to an album that refuses to be pinned down to any one emotion or style, leaving the listener with a sense of having experienced something truly special.\n\nSo, while this review may have arrived late to the party, it’s clear that \"Impermanent\" by the Daniele Martini Quartet is worth the wait. This is a quartet that has something profound to say, and they say it with a grace and conviction that’s rare in today’s jazz scene. If impermanence is the theme, let’s hope this album’s influence is anything but.\n\nDaunik Lazro, Kristoff K Roll, Sophie Agnel: Quartet Un Peu Tendre\n\nBy Vito Camarretta(@) - More reviews by Vito Camarretta\n\nArtist: Daunik Lazro, Kristoff K Roll, Sophie Agnel (@)\n\nTitle: Quartet Un Peu Tendre\n\nFormat: CD\n\nLabel: Fou (@)\n\nRated:\n\n\"Quartet Un Peu Tendre\" might be the most misleading album title of the year. What at first glance promises a gentle, perhaps even tender exploration of sound, quickly reveals itself as a ferocious assault on conventional musicality. It’s the kind of record that dares you to listen, dares you to find the beauty amidst the chaos, and laughs in your face if you think you've figured it out.\n\nThe album features a lineup of avant-garde veterans: Daunik Lazro on baritone saxophone, Sophie Agnel on piano, and the duo Kristoff K. Roll (Carole Rieussec and J-Kristoff Camps) handling electro-acoustic devices. If you’re familiar with these names, you already know that you’re not in for a smooth ride. Lazro, a stalwart of the French free jazz scene, brings his usual brand of bracing, guttural saxophone work that feels as if it’s tearing at the very fabric of sound itself. Agnel, on the other hand, isn’t content to simply \"play\" the piano — she interrogates it, manipulates it, and ultimately bends it to her will. Meanwhile, Kristoff K. Roll weave a tapestry of unpredictable, often unnerving sounds that challenge your very notion of what constitutes music.\n\nThe opening track, “Au Départ C’est Une Photo”, is a sprawling 31-minute odyssey that defies easy categorization. It begins with an eerie quietude—Agnel’s piano notes scatter like raindrops on a tin roof, while Lazro’s saxophone hums ominously in the background. Just when you think you’ve settled into a groove, the electro-acoustic elements creep in, turning the serene into something profoundly unsettling. It’s as if the musicians are constantly at odds with each other, each one vying for control, yet somehow creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe second piece, “L’Hiver Sera Chaud”, clocks in at just under 41 minutes and is no less demanding. This is the sound of winter as imagined by a mind teetering on the brink—bleak, cold, but with the occasional burst of unexpected warmth. Lazro’s saxophone work here is especially notable; he conjures sounds that range from the abrasive to the plaintive, all while Agnel’s piano provides a counterpoint that is as dissonant as it is compelling. The electro-acoustic elements by Kristoff K Roll, meanwhile, feel less like an accompaniment and more like an omnipresent force, shaping the entire listening experience in ways that are both subtle and overt.\n\nTo say this album isn’t for everyone is an understatement. This is music that demands your full attention, and even then, it’s likely to leave you feeling disoriented and perhaps a little uneasy. But for those willing to engage with it on its own terms, \"Quartet Un Peu Tendre\" offers a deeply rewarding experience. It’s the musical equivalent of staring into the void—what you find there is entirely up to you.\n\nComparisons to other avant-garde stalwarts like Anthony Braxton or the electro-acoustic explorations of Luc Ferrari are inevitable, but \"Quartet Un Peu Tendre\" carves out its own niche in the experimental landscape. It’s an album that, much like the artists involved, refuses to be pigeonholed, constantly shifting and evolving with each listen. Just when you think you’ve got it figured out, it throws another curveball your way, challenging your preconceptions and forcing you to reassess what you thought you knew about music.\n\nIn a world where much of what passes for experimental music feels like it’s trying too hard to be different, \"Quartet Un Peu Tendre\" feels refreshingly genuine in its disregard for convention. It’s not trying to be difficult; it just is. And that, perhaps, is what makes it so compelling.\n\nSo, is \"Quartet Un Peu Tendre\" an easy listen? Absolutely not. But is it worth your time? If you’re willing to dive deep into the world of avant-garde improvisation and let go of your expectations, the answer is a resounding yes. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you."
