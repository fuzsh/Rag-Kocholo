It’s about returning to myself now. Previously, my writing was very nostalgic—this album is intentionally very present,” shares Bre.\n\nBre will celebrate the cathartic release of this first set of songs with a special hometown show in Nashville on July 30th at 3rd and Lindsley as part of Lightning100’s acclaimed weekly concert series “Nashville Sunday Night,“ She has also announced fall tour dates starting September 28th at Eddie’s Attic in Atlanta, and making stops in D.C. at DC9, Chicago at Schubas, Philadelphia at World Cafe Live, New York at Mercury Lounge, and more before wrapping up in Boston at Deep Cuts on October 15th.

With its infectious beats, soulful melodies, and vibrant subculture, it has become a global phenomenon. Over the decades, it has transformed and branched into numerous subgenres, but its core essence remains the same. In this article, we’ll explore the state of house music today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. The Resilience of the Underground:\n\nHouse music’s roots lie in the underground club scene, and this spirit remains alive and well. While mainstream pop music trends come and go, house music continues to thrive in the underground, with an unwavering dedication to the music and the dance floor. Underground clubs and raves provide a space for creative experimentation, pushing boundaries, and fostering a sense of community that’s unique to the genre.\n\n2. The Proliferation of Subgenres:\n\nHouse music has evolved into a diverse family of subgenres. From deep house to tech house, progressive house to acid house, each subgenre brings its own flavor and style. This diversity ensures that there’s something for every taste within the house music spectrum. It also keeps the genre fresh and innovative, as artists continue to blend and redefine these subgenres.\n\n3. A Global Phenomenon:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse music has transcended its Chicago origins to become a global phenomenon. It has touched every corner of the world, with thriving house music scenes in cities as diverse as Ibiza, Berlin, Miami, and Johannesburg. The global reach of the genre has not only expanded its fan base but also enriched it with diverse cultural influences.\n\n4. Influence on Mainstream Pop:\n\nHouse music has had a significant influence on mainstream pop music. Elements of house, such as four-on-the-floor beats and soulful vocal arrangements, can be heard in chart-topping hits. Artists like Daft Punk, Calvin Harris, and David Guetta have seamlessly blended house elements into pop music, introducing new audiences to the genre.\n\n5. Technological Advancements:\n\nAdvancements in music production technology have had a profound impact on house music. The genre has always been at the forefront of utilizing new tools and techniques. Today, digital audio workstations, synthesizers, and MIDI controllers enable artists to create intricate, layered sounds that push the boundaries of what’s possible in electronic music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. A Resurgence of Vinyl:\n\nWhile technology has ushered in the digital age of music, vinyl records have experienced a resurgence within the house music community. Vinyl not only offers a nostalgic connection to the roots of the genre but also a unique sound quality that many purists appreciate. Vinyl-only sets and limited edition releases have become a hallmark of the scene.\n\n7. Social and Cultural Movements:\n\nHouse music has often been associated with social and cultural movements. It has been the soundtrack to LGBTQ+ rights, unity, and inclusivity. From the early days of Chicago’s house scene to contemporary festivals, it has celebrated diversity and acceptance, offering a space for people of all backgrounds to come together.\n\n8. The Future of House:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe state of house music is strong, and its future looks promising. As technology continues to evolve, new subgenres will likely emerge, pushing the boundaries of what defines house music. The global connectivity of the digital age ensures that the genre will continue to transcend borders and cultures.\n\nHouse music remains a vibrant and evolving genre. It continues to hold a special place in the hearts of those who have danced to its beats and embraced its culture. With its resilience, diversity, and influence on mainstream music, house music is well-positioned to keep the world dancing for years to come.\n\nPre-Order the new EP, Babe? here.\n\nMore information on YU QT:\n\nTwitter Instagram Soundcloud\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContent provided by: Infectious\n\nPhoto Credit: All photos are copyright of their respective owners.\n\nFind more Music Releases HERE!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtists: Wh0\n\nTitle: Deeper\n\nLabel: Wh0 Plays\n\nRelease Date: Sept 15, 2023\n\nBuy/Stream\n\nOne-Line Review: Wh0 Drops A Real House Collaboration That Takes You Back To The Hay-Days When Gospel Power-House Singers Pushed Chart-Topping House and Dance Tracks.\n\nNews\n\nFresh off their massive Capital playlisted collab What You Need with Steve Angello this past July, dynamic masked duo Wh0 drop a brand new two-track EP Deeper on their Wh0 Plays label.\n\nSince meeting in 2018 the duo rapidly caught industry attention, landing nominations for 1001 Tracklist’s ‘50 Best Producers’ title 3 years consecutively and releasing on major labels such as Ministry of Sound, Toolroom, Positiva, Ultra, and their own imprint Wh0 Plays, home to rapidly rising artists and industry veterans such as Vanilla Ace, Alex Preston, Makree, and more.

I’ve grown to understand that He loves me as I am, but loves me enough not to let me stay as I am. These songs have taken time to record and write, and I believe it will reignite our desire for love and God’s love. Unfortunately, many people are hopeless and don’t have high expectations because of past trauma, but I promise you, this love record will reconnect you to God’s love. I am excited about my collaborations with PJ Morton and D Smoke. Also, with all of my sisters and my children, Krista, Wozy and Zaya, being a part of this record, it feels like love to me, and I pray that’s what people feel when they hear it,” shares Erica Campbell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn anticipation to the “I Love You” album release, fans have been feasting on other songs released from the album. There is the throwback to testimony service, “Sho’ Been Good“. “The saints would stand up and say, “When I think of the goodness of Jesus and all He’s done for me, my soul cries out ‘Hallelujah’. Thank God for saving me.” That’s not a cliché. That’s real talk and I wanted to put it in a song as a reminder of all God has done because He’s done so much. I hope this song makes you remember all He’s done in your life. I hope it encourages you to reflect on the goodness of God, the greatness of God, the mercy of God, the favor of God, and the power of God, and then celebrate that goodness. He sho’ has been good,” she adds.\n\nThe most recent song release is “Trust and Obey“. “The song was was written by my friend, Gromyko Collins. It is a beautiful song and impacted my heart the moment I heard it. I knew I wanted to sing it because I feel every one of these lyrics. After all, without trust and obedience to the Father, I won’t live the full life God has for me. I want to experience all that He has for me. To be transparent, there’s been many times I have not obeyed and I did not trust Him but God’s gracious hand helped to build my faith back up when I lost it and wasn’t even sure how to find it. I found it in trusting God and obeying him even when it didn’t make sense to me. So I hope this song reminds you to trust and obey the Father because we can trust Him. He’s trustworthy. He’s got a great track record!.”\n\nIn addition to her continued success as a music artist, Erica Campbell also touches fans’ lives as the host of the syndicated morning radio show, Get Up!
