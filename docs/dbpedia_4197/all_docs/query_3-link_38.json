        "text": "Today sees Welsh juggernauts, HIMALAYAS release their debut album, From Hell To Here via Nettwerk. The 12-track album, mixed by the GRAMMY Award-winning producer Dave Sardy (Royal Blood, Rage Against The Machine, Oasis), features previously released singles including ‘Leave This Place’, album title track ‘From Hell To Here’, ‘Into The Trap,‘Out Of The Dark And Into The Light’ and ‘Alone’, plus several unheard songs.\n\nListen to From Hell To Here:\n\nhttps://himalayas.ffm.to/fhth\n\nFrontman Joe Williams has said of the band’s debut album release, “We’re so excited to be saying that our debut album is out. From Hell to Here feels like the best version of the band up to this point and is an album that we’re all really proud of. We’ve tried to create something that shows who we are as a band and where we can go in the future. Hopefully everyone enjoys it as much we enjoyed making it!”\n\nIn celebration of the band’s highly anticipated debut album release, HIMALAYAS will play not one but two intimate shows! First off will be a free show at Porters bar in Cardiff tonight, from 9pm. The second will be a special in-store at HMV (41 Queen Street, St David’s Centre) tomorrow at 3.30pm.\n\nThe Cardiff-based quartet are playing a slew of festivals this Summer, including the highly regarded Reading & Leeds and Madrid’s Mad Cool festival. They will also join Lost Society on the European leg of their tour in June. Last year saw HIMALAYAS head out on a UK headline tour, which included sold out shows; one being their raucous hometown gig at Buffalo in Cardiff. See full dates and details here.\n\nHIMALAYAS have garnered brilliant support across radio and received spins from the likes of BBC Radio 1’s Nels Hylton who has declared them “heirs to the indie rock throne”, Daniel P Carter and Alyx Holcombe, on Kerrang! Radio, and also local and student radio stations across the board. The band have also racked up 46 million+ streams across Spotify alone, where they have previously been added to playlists such as Walk Like A Badass (2.2 million+ likes) and The Rock List (588k+ likes).\n\nSharing a mutual love of Queens Of The Stone Age, Muse and Iggy Pop in their teenage years, Joe and Mike started performing in small venues, and soon captured the attention of hungry fans and music industry tastemakers alike. Later joined by drummer James Goulbourn in 2015, they were completed by Louis Heaps on bass. HIMALAYAS started making their own unique blend of raucous fast-paced rock’n’roll music, which soon went on to earn them an extremely solid fanbase. The four-piece have been cutting their teeth on the live circuit ever since, playing highly regarded festivals including SXSW and Reading & Leeds Festival, supported the likes of Stereophonics and Manic Street Preachers, and have played sold out headline shows in London and Cardiff.\n\nFrom Hell To Here album tracklisting:"
