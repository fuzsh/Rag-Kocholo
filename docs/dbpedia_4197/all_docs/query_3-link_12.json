        "text": "To celebrate Hip Hop turning 50, I am sharing my first academic publication, 9 years ago, which centered Hip-Hop and Black masculinity! Hip-hop has always been my first love as a child and what led me to poetry, Black joy, critical analysis and so much more. Abstract: The evolution of hip-hop music and culture has impacted the visibility of Black men and the Black male body. As hip-hop continues to become commercially viable, performances of Black masculinities can be easily found on magazine covers, television shows, and popular websites. How do these representations affect the collective consciousness of Black men, while helping to construct a particular brand of masculinity that plays into the White imagination? This theoretical article explores how representations of Black masculinity vary in underground versus mainstream hip-hop, stemming directly from White patriarchal ideals of manhood. Conceptual and theoretical analyses of songs from the likes of Jay-Z and Dead Prez and Imani Perry's Prophets of the Hood help provide an understanding of the parallels between hip-hop performances/identities and Black masculinities. #hiphop #hiphop50 #iloveyou\n\nI recently created a resource that lists examples of musical intervals, but only using music performed or created by Black women. Understanding how diversity/inclusion and equity intersect is crucial, and goes beyond changing hiring practices and repertoire (which are also important). It requires us to think about the tools we use, and how we can easily forget about the materials that underpin the pedagogy that is now, by some, being scrutinized and adapted. At any rate, I hope this resource is useful to teachers and educators! https://lnkd.in/eDqimDzR\n\nThey say there's a Swift Math to calculate when Taylor Swift will release her next album or make a significant announcement. Last night, the math was on point as she celebrated her 13th Grammy by announcing her newest album. In between the Eras concert this year in Asia, Australia, and Europe and her new album(s), we can see the impact she's had not only on our economy but also on music culture üé∂ This report, crafted by fellow researchers at Statista, is truly amazing. Not only does it capture the statistical importance and feasible results in the economy, but it also includes some delightful fun facts üòé #TaylorSwift #Grammy #DataAnalyst #StatisticalAnalysis\"\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the big hype about taylor swift.. she‚Äôs not even that good‚Äù.. said a dear male friend of mine who clearly does not like her‚Ä¶and I told him ‚ÄúYour anecdotal experience does not trump statistically significant data‚Äù and given that he is a wise guy he took my point gracefully. I read somewhere that ‚ÄòOpinion is really the lowest form of human knowledge. It requires no accountability, no understanding. The highest form of knowledge is empathy, for it requires us to suspend our egos and live in another's world. It requires profound purpose larger than the self kind of understanding. ~Bill Bullard‚Äô I have doled out my share of opinions in my life time and I am humbled after reading this.. Artist like Taylor swift and others ( as cited in the article) now have the power to change people‚Äôs lives (and I mean economically) beyond thier songs and that‚Äôs a contribution worth recognition and celebration .. not criticism ‚Ä¶and yet they get trolled in ways their male counterparts never face. Fortunately we live in an age where access to information is easily available ‚Ä¶ even in a polarised opinionated world.. if you search ‚Äú good things about xxx‚Äù search ‚Äòbad things about xxx‚Äù too so you can make up your own mind‚Ä¶ and not get influenced by the algorithm ‚Ä¶and then there is data like the below article to support your inference. Here‚Äôs to celebrating the wins of these mighty talented women breaking barriers, inspiring young girls and transforming lives through thier songs and music."
