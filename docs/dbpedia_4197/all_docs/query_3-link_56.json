        "text": "As a part of our interview series with leaders, stars, and rising stars in the music industry, we had the distinct pleasure of interviewing Oliver Hazard.\n\nThe story of Waterville, OH indie-folk trio Oliver Hazard — ​​Michael Belazis (vocals, guitar), Griffin McCulloch (vocals, keys) and Devin East (vocals, guitar) — is the digital age’s version of classic band mythmaking. One member of the band came home to Ohio after leading camping trips in California and decided to make an album with two childhood friends. They won a Facebook raffle to record one song at a studio. Instead, they played their whole album straight through once, resulting in their debut LP 34 N River (2018). The Fader called the album a “folk-pop masterpiece” and the band was booked at Bonnaroo and Mountain Jam shortly thereafter. In 2019, the band released their 6 track EP, The Flood, which Billboard called a “souvenir.” This brings the band to their sophomore, self-titled album (July 2023), featuring music from the band’s recent Northern Lights EP, plus five additional songs.\n\nThe sound of their upcoming 10 track LP, produced by Jacquire King (Of Monsters and Men, Kings of Leon), blends delicate arrangements with sturdy melodies. The LP is the work of 3 individual singers, songwriters and multi-instrumentalists, who share an organic connection in the craft — sensibilities that yield music that’s harmonic, haunting and also ambitious and surprising.\n\n“This album feels different than anything we’ve done in the past. We’re very simple people. I think the album reflects that, and I hope it captures something you probably can’t describe yourself, but that speaks to you.” Dev says.\n\nThank you so much for joining us in this interview series! Before we dive in, our readers would love to learn a bit about your “origin story”. Can you tell us the story of how you grew up?\n\nThanks for having us! Well, we all grew up in very small towns in northwest Ohio, along a mud bottom river. It’s quaint, quiet, and there isn’t much going on. But there is a really strong sense of community here. The town is really close to Lake Erie, and that’s actually how we got our band name. Oliver Hazard Perry was a local historical figure here. We wanted to find a name that had a local tie to where we grew up, so we borrowed his first and middle name. Plus, people thought they had heard of us because of the name familiarity, so it helped us grow when we first were getting started.\n\nCan you share a story with us about what brought you to this specific career path?\n\nSo I was working in california, and during a holiday break back home in Ohio while visiting family, I had a goal to perform a short set at a local dive bar. So I booked 20 minutes at our local music dive, and then I asked two friends to perform the show with me. I had been working on some songs for the show. But as a trio, we were able to finish about 10 songs that week. We performed the show, our friends loved it, and serendipitously I threw our name into a recording contest at a local studio. We won one free song. I asked if we could record all 10 of the songs that we had written “live” in a single take. That became our first album 34 N. River. It started to gain some traction amongst fans and also industry folks, and with that momentum, we were able to start our careers as Oliver Hazard.\n\nCan you tell us the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?\n\nDuring the pandemic, we teamed up with our local minor league baseball stadium and hosted the first socially distant concert in our region. We sold about 1000 tickets, painted boxes in the outfield for “pods” to organize. We were projected onto the Megatron. It was wild.\n\nIt has been said that sometimes our mistakes can be our greatest teachers. Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?\n\nAt one of our first shows, I kept forgetting which fret my capo was supposed to be on, for each song. I had to restart multiple songs that night. It was super embarrassing. I quickly learned to leave myself notes on stage if I am new to any song that I am about to perform.\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\n\nThe town and the community that lives there is really the foundation of the band. We have so much support from the community with our local shows, our music festival, our merchandise production, everything. Someone is always willing to help. The sense of place really inspires our songwriting.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\n\nYou miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. We set out to do something that felt larger than ourselves with this project, and we never would have done that without taking risks.\n\nWhat are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now?\n\nWe have our own music festival in our hometown of Waterville, Ohio. It’s on August 12th. We have some awesome artists coming into town this year. We invite emerging artists that we meet on tour to our little town in Ohio. There’s always a great turnout, and awesome local beer and local food. You should totally come if you are free.\n\nWe are very interested in diversity in the entertainment industry. Can you share three reasons with our readers about why you think it’s important to have diversity represented in music, film, and television? How can that potentially affect our culture?\n\nWe grew up in a place with a lot of privilege. And because of that, we’ve always committed this project to using our platform to help those who didn’t grow up with the same privilege. Each year we actually donate large profits from our music festival to our local arts commission, who gives grants to artists in need of a little extra support.\n\nWhat are your “5 things I wish someone told me when I first started” and why?\n\nI’ll give you three.\n\nGreat projects can take time. It has taken us 5 years to get where we are today.\n\nDon’t just do what you think you are “suppose” to do to succeed. Think outside of the box. Instead of playing in bars and empty venues when we first started, we decided to do play in our fans living rooms. This helped us build and create a grassroots audience much more organically than if we had taken a conventional route.\n\nTake a step back. You’ll have a lot of hard days, but if you can take a few steps back and understand how far you’ve come since you first started, and be proud of that progress. Not every story is a meteoric success. Ours certainly isn’t, and that is okay.\n\nWhich tips would you recommend to your colleagues in your industry to help them to thrive and not “burn out”?\n\nSet boundaries. There are infinite ways to succeed. You don’t have to say yes to all of them.\n\nYou are a person of enormous influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)\n\nIt would be great to inspire folks to love and support their local environment as much as they can. There is nothing more beautiful than a local ecosystem and more timeless than a local business. Let’s make sure to do our part in a small but effective way.\n\nIs there a person in the world, or in the US whom you would love to have a private breakfast or lunch with, and why? He or she might just see this, especially if we tag them. :-)\n\nWe’d love to have breakfast with Neil Young. We are big fans of his songwriting.\n\nHow can our readers follow you online?\n\nThey can follow us @olihazard on all platforms.
