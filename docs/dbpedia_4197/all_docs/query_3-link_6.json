        "text": "Texas duo MISSIO encapsulates complex human emotions with their new album I Am Cinco. The album combines the different moods and emotions of the four previously released EPs – I Am Sad, I Am High, I Am Awesome, and I Am Angry – along with the fifth and final EP, I Am Crazy, which also drops today alongside the full album. Together, these 26-tracks see MISSIO powerfully meld elements of rock, electronic, indie, and hip-hop into an unmatched and uncompromising hybrid. Listen to the band’s most ambitious body of work to date HERE, and for more information on band’s illustrious career, check out the sizzle reel HERE.\n\nI Am Cinco is an empowering statement that you exist as the sum of all parts of your past. David Butler elaborates, “We have widely different emotions. The way we live our lives is the way we created ‘I Am Cinco.’ This is a picture of humanity and a collection of our experiences.”\n\nMISSIO is proud to share the newest visualizer for “Fall Into A Black Hole,” one of the five new songs from the I Am Crazy EP, rounding out the band’s vision of celebrating human existence. These tracks delve into introspection and processing trauma in healthy ways, and also features the previously unreleased tracks “Rage,” “This World Is Better When It’s Sick, ” “Go Fuck Yourself,” and “Pulled Down Low.”\n\nFormulated in the band’s hometown of Austin, TX, I Am Cinco was eventually completed on a creative escape to Mexico City. “We’ve been to multiple countries and had 10 different sessions to write and record these 26 songs. It’s an epic inspired by some of the great old-school double LPs like The Wall or Melancholy and the Infinite Sadness. We’re not just here to check a box; we’re here to be prolific. It puts our creativity out there in a way no other album has. It’s MISSIO,” MISSIO elaborates.\n\nI Am Cinco Tracklisting:\n\nI Am Sad and I Can’t Speak\n\nRead Your Mind\n\nI Don’t Like It When You’re Lonely\n\nWhat Can You Say\n\nRingTing\n\nMonsters (Inside of Us)\n\nGood Vibrations\n\nEasy\n\nThang Thang\n\nBig Stacks\n\nPapi Chulo\n\nI’m Coming Home\n\nNot My Fault\n\nHeart Made of Dynamite\n\nGoodbye to the Old Me\n\nMaking Me Nervous\n\nRun Away\n\nRage\n\nFuck It\n\nAztec Death Whistle\n\nThis World Is Better When It’s Sick\n\nGo Fuck Yourself\n\nFall into a Blackhole\n\nThe Higher You Climb\n\nPulled Down Low\n\nTime\n\nMISSIO will be bringing their high energy live show to Denver for their album release show on May 3rd before heading out to Europe and the U.K. for a headline run starting in June. Catch the band performing the new music for the first time live by purchasing tickets on the band’s website HERE.\n\nAbout MISSIO:\n\nSince 2015, MISSIO released Loner [2017], The Darker the Weather // The Better the Man [2019], Can You Feel The Sun [2020], and VILLAIN [2022]. Their catalog has notably resonated with the Gold-certified “Everybody Gets High” and staples, including “Twisted,” “Bottom of the Deep Blue See,” “Sing To Me,” and “I See You.” Between selling out shows, they appeared at festivals a la ACL and Lollapalooza and incited praise from Billboard, Rolling Stone, New Noise, and Substream."
