        "text": "The growing success of indie Nettwerk Records is demonstrated by these noteworthy artists’ rise to fame, covering a variety of genres and taking social media by storm.\n\nfrom Nettwork Records via A2IM\n\nNettwerk Music Group is a full-service artist development and brand builder with a history spanning almost 40 years. Nettwerk operates a global organization with offices in major cities around the world and an infrastructure to match.\n\nAt Nettwerk, we pride ourselves on our ability to anticipate shifts in consumer behavior and to effectively leverage technology in order to place great music in the hands of fans around the world. We work across a variety of genres with an overarching philosophy to help inspiring artists grow their careers and realize their creative vision.\n\nCheck out some highlights from their current roster…\n\nVacations\n\nHailing from Newcastle, Australia, VACATIONS is an indie alt band making waves across the globe whose music encapsulates a dreamy intention, soundtracking moments in everyday life.\n\nTheir song “Young” has 2M+ video uses + 7B views on TikTok and a cumulative 750M streams, and they sold out their debut 32-date U.S. Spring tour (over 14k tickets) + follow-up 11-date west coast US tour.\n\nWild Rivers\n\nWild Rivers new album Sidelines captures the band as they navigate their twenties, moving from the college years into the uncharted territories of adulthood. Co-produced by Peter Katis (The National, Interpol, Sharon van Etten), it landed at #9 in the U.S. on the Spotify Debut Album Chart, received praise from Line of Best Fit, Under The Radar, Wonderland and more, and was supported by a sold-out North American tour.\n\nThey’ve earned over 250 million streams and a devoted fanbase for their expertly crafted harmonies, introspective lyricism, and incredible live show.\n\nBraxton Cook\n\nBraxton Cook is one of this generation’s most exciting voices. The Juilliard-trained and uniquely talented vocalist, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer blends jazz, soul and alt-R&B in a fresh new sound all his own, as heard on his latest acclaimed EP, Black Mona Lisa, which received acclaim from the likes of Billboard, NPR Music, PAPER, OkayPlayer, Jazziz, and more.\n\nThey’ve earned over 250 million streams and a devoted fanbase for their expertly crafted harmonies, introspective lyricism, and incredible live show.\n\nMiya Folick\n\nMiya Folick first attracted acclaim with two 2015’s Strange Darling and 2017’s Give It To Me EP. Her 2018 debut album Premonitions drew critical praise from NPR, GQ, Pitchfork, The\n\nFADER and many more; landed her a Tiny Desk Concert for NPR and saw her sell out headline shows and play festivals the world over.\n\nShe recently released her latest acclaimed EP 2007, and spent the remainder of 2022 playing headline shows and supporting Tove Lo across Europe.\n\nOld Sea Brigade\n\nBen Cramer describes 5 AM Paradise, his vivid and moving third album as Old Sea Brigade, as a coming-of-age record: ten songs that balance youthful abandon with maturity and restraint, full of imaginative flourishes, evocative textures, and graceful melodies that lend magnitude to mundane moments.\n\nHe capped a triumphant 2022 with a gripping three-song performance on CBS Saturday Morning, marking the Nashville-based and Georgia-born musician’s national television debut.\n\nSt. Lucia\n\nLed by husband-and-wife duo, Jean-Philip Grobler and Patti Beranek, synth-pop group St. Lucia has arrived with their long awaited fourth studio album, Utopia. Equal parts colorful disco, 70s funk, and 80s pop, the Utopia LP is a luminous palette of synths, pulsating with vibrant sonics that have come to characterize St. Lucia’s genre-defying career, earning praise from Paper, Billboard, Under The Radar, FLOOD, Ladygunn and more.\n\nLuke Sital-Singh\n\nLuke Sital-Singh recently released Dressing Like A Stranger, an eleven-song collection penned by the London-born songwriter as he moved halfway across the globe to Los Angeles just before the world shut down. With praise from Forbes, Under The Radar, WNYC, NPR Music and more, Sital-Singh shines with perhaps his most celebrated work to date.\n\nMichal Leah\n\nMichal Leah might be only 19 years old, but the Chicago-born soul-pop songwriter and multi-instrumentalist is a superstar on the rise, singing with the wisdom, range, and intuition of an artist withdecades’ more experience. Her viral single, “The Way I Love You,” was written with the esteemed Elsa Curran and Grammy-nominated producer Yakob. “The Way I Love You” sound on Tik-Tok has already garnered over 60 million views, as well as recognition from Meghan Trainor, Lauren Spencer Smith, Camylio, and more.\n\nAlana Bonilla on 01/27/2023 in Indie Music | Permalink | Comments (0)\n\nShare on:"
