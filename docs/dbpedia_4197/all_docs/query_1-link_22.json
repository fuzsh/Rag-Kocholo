        "text": "Having already spent the last few years building an immersive catalogue of much-loved delights, Paris Paloma has now announced her plans for her debut studio album, arriving later this year.\n\nThe new full-length 'Cacophony' will include the previously shared efforts ‘my mind (now)’, ‘drywall’, ‘as good a reason’, and ‘yeti’, is being previewed by the revamped rendition of 'labour' dubbed 'LABOUR (the cacophony)', and is set to be released on the 30th August via Nettwerk.\n\nSpeaking about the new release, she said, “From this chaotic cosmic yawn, creation sprang forth, so this is a collection that makes sense of the overwhelming space of my mind where my anxiety, my OCD, and trauma processing lives.\n\n“I love the feral, feminine aspects of my music. Being unapologetically vulnerable feels wild – it's breaking down boundaries, a return to something primal”.\n\nWatch the new video for 'LABOUR (the cacophony)' in the player below."
