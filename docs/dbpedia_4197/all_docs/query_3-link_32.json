        "text": "Growing up in a small village in Lower Austria, OSKA moved to Vienna at 18 to study her first love; music. She started busking in streets and squares of the capital while also studying pop and jazz singing. She signed to Nettwerk in 2020 and released her debut EP Honeymoon Phase to critical acclaim. The five songs on the album have amassed more than 4 million Spotify streams and won her the XA Music Export Award at Waves Vienna Festival 2020.Now in 2022, OSKA is proud to unveil her debut full-length album My world, My love, Paris. “For so many years making my first album was the biggest thing in the world to me. That‘s probably also why it took me so long to make it. I always wanted it to be special and at times was scared that I wouldn‘t like it five years from now or that I couldn’t identify with the music some time after the release.\"History, family, and legacy are touchstones of OSKA’s music. Legacy can mean different things to different people. For some, legacy is simply about blood ties. For others, it’s about making positive decisions that will impact future generations. For OSKA, legacy is about both of these things. It’s a theme that looms over her remarkable debut album, My world, My love, Paris. Ultimately it serves as a snapshot of a young woman attempting to make sense of getting older in an increasingly uncertain era."
