Rhys Fulber from Front Line Assembly, Delerium, Conjure One et al recently announced that he and Bill Leeb are working on a new Noise Unit album, which got a lot of fans excited. But that’s far from everything he’s got in the pipeline, so here’s an update on what’s brewing. First off: new Conjure One album.

The as yet untitled Conjure One album is coming out on the Dutch label Black Hole and features vocal collaborations with Jaren and Jeza. The style is moody and electronic, with a great focus on the songs, melodies and atmospheres and not bothering too much with current dance trends. No word on a release date yet though.

Rhys also has a dark ambient EP called “Resolve” coming out soon, under his own name.

The Noise Unit album is coming along, but it’s a bit too early in the process to say much about it. A picture was posted on Facebook of Bill doing vocal recordings in Greg Reely’s quarantine bedroom studio. Rhys is also teasing that there might be some interesting collaborations. Furthermore he’s also teasing that they are working on other stuff too, but won’t reveal what it is.

On top of all this, he’s also made three tracks that will appear in the upcoming AAA video game Cyberpunk 2077 , which comes out in November. This is the most hyped game of 2020 so it’s a pretty big deal.
