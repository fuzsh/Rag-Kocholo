        "text": "World Facts Index\n\nBetween 1990 and 1992 Albania ended 46 years of xenophobic Communist rule and established a multiparty democracy. The transition has proven challenging as successive governments have tried to deal with high unemployment, widespread corruption, a dilapidated physical infrastructure, powerful organized crime networks, and combative political opponents. Albania has made progress in its democratic development since first holding multiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies remain. International observers judged elections to be largely free and fair since the restoration of political stability following the collapse of pyramid schemes in 1997. In the 2005 general elections, the Democratic Party and its allies won a decisive victory on pledges of reducing crime and corruption, promoting economic growth, and decreasing the size of government. The election, and particularly the orderly transition of power, was considered an important step forward. Although Albania's economy continues to grow, the country is still one of the poorest in Europe, hampered by a large informal economy and an inadequate energy and transportation infrastructure. Albania has played a largely helpful role in managing inter-ethnic tensions in southeastern Europe, and is continuing to work toward joining NATO and the EU. Albania, with troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been a strong supporter of the global war on terrorism.\n\nGeography of Albania\n\nLocation:\n\nSoutheastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea and Ionian Sea, between Greece and Serbia and Montenegro\n\nCoordinates:\n\n41 00 N, 20 00 E\n\nMap references:\n\nEurope\n\nArea:\n\ntotal: 28,748 sq km\n\nwater: 1,350 sq km\n\nland: 27,398 sq km\n\nArea comparative:\n\nslightly smaller than Maryland\n\nLand boundaries:\n\ntotal: 720 km\n\nborder countries: Greece 282 km, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 151 km, Serbia and Montenegro 287 km\n\nCoastline:\n\n362 km\n\nMaritime claims:\n\nterritorial sea: 12 NM\n\ncontinental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\n\nClimate:\n\nmild temperate; cool, cloudy, wet winters; hot, clear, dry summers; interior is cooler and wetter\n\nTerrain:\n\nmostly mountains and hills; small plains along coast\n\nElevation extremes:\n\nlowest point: Adriatic Sea 0 m\n\nhighest point: Maja e Korabit (Golem Korab) 2,753 m\n\nNatural resources:\n\npetroleum, natural gas, coal, bauxite, chromite, copper, iron ore, nickel, salt, timber, hydropower\n\nNatural hazards:\n\ndestructive earthquakes; tsunamis occur along southwestern coast; floods; drought\n\nEnvironment - current issues:\n\ndeforestation; soil erosion; water pollution from industrial and domestic effluents\n\nGeography - note:\n\nstrategic location along Strait of Otranto (links Adriatic Sea to Ionian Sea and Mediterranean Sea)\n\nMore Geography\n\nPopulation of Albania\n\nPopulation:\n\n2,986,952 (July 2010 est.)\n\nAge structure:\n\n0-14 years: 23.1% (male 440,528/female 400,816)\n\n15-64 years: 67.1% (male 1,251,001/female 1,190,841)\n\n65 years and over: 9.8% (male 165,557/female 190,710)\n\nMedian age:\n\ntotal: 29.2 years\n\nmale: 28.6 years\n\nfemale: 29.8 years\n\nGrowth rate:\n\n0.529%\n\nInfant mortality:\n\ntotal: 20.02 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nmale: 20.46 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nfemale: 19.54 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nLife expectancy at birth:\n\ntotal population: 77.6 years\n\nmale: 74.95 years\n\nfemale: 80.53 years\n\nTotal fertility rate:\n\n2.03 children born/woman\n\nNationality:\n\nnoun: Albanian(s)\n\nadjective: Albanian\n\nEthnic groups:\n\nAlbanian 95%, Greek 3%, other 2% (Vlach, Roma (Gypsy), Serb, and Macedonian or Bulgarian) (1989 est.)\n\nnote: in 1989, other estimates of the Greek population ranged from 1% (official Albanian statistics) to 12% (from a Greek organization)\n\nReligions:\n\nMuslim 70%, Albanian Orthodox 20%, Roman Catholic 10%\n\nnote: percentages are estimates; there are no available current statistics on religious affiliation; all mosques and churches were closed in 1967 and religious observances prohibited; in November 1990, Albania began allowing private religious practice\n\nLanguages:\n\nAlbanian (official - Tosk is the official dialect), Greek\n\nLiteracy:\n\ndefinition: age 9 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 98.7%\n\nmale: 99.2%\n\nfemale: 98.3%\n\nGovernment\n\nCountry name:\n\nconventional long form: Republic of Albania\n\nlocal short form: Shqiperia\n\nformer: People's Socialist Republic of Albania\n\nlocal long form: Republika e Shqiperise\n\nGovernment type:\n\nemerging democracy\n\nCapital:\n\nTirana\n\nAdministrative divisions:\n\n12 counties (qarqe, singular - qark); Qarku i Beratit, Qarku i Dibres, Qarku i Durresit, Qarku i Elbasanit, Qarku i Fierit, Qarku i Gjirokastres, Qarku i Korces, Qarku i Kukesit, Qarku i Lezhes, Qarku i Shkodres, Qarku i Tiranes, Qarku i Vlores\n\nIndependence:\n\n28 November 1912 (from Ottoman Empire)\n\nNational holiday:\n\nIndependence Day, 28 November (1912)\n\nConstitution:\n\na constitution was adopted by popular referendum on 28 November 1998\n\nLegal system:\n\nhas a civil law system; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction; has accepted jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court for its citizens\n\nSuffrage:\n\n18 years of age; universal\n\nExecutive branch:\n\nchief of state: President of the Republic Bamir TOPI\n\nhead of government: Prime Minister Sali BERISHA\n\ncabinet: Council of Ministers proposed by the prime minister, nominated by the president, and approved by parliament\n\nelections: president elected by the People's Assembly for a five-year term (eligible for a second term); prime minister appointed by the president\n\nLegislative branch:\n\nunicameral People's Assembly or Kuvendi Popullor (140 seats; 100 are elected by direct popular vote and 40 by proportional vote for four-year terms)\n\nJudicial branch:\n\nConstitutional Court, Supreme Court (chairman is elected by the People's Assembly for a four-year term), and multiple appeals and district courts\n\nEconomy\n\nLagging behind its Balkan neighbors, Albania is making the difficult transition to a more modern open-market economy. The government has taken measures to curb violent crime and reduce the large gray economy. The economy is bolstered by annual remittances from abroad of $600-$800 million, mostly from Albanians residing in Greece and Italy; this helps offset the towering trade deficit. Agriculture, which accounts for about one-quarter of GDP, is held back because of lack of modern equipment, unclear property rights, and the prevalence of small, inefficient plots of land. Energy shortages and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure contribute to Albania's poor business environment, which make it difficult to attract and sustain foreign investment. The planned construction of a new thermal power plant near Vlore and improved transmission and distribution facilities eventually will help relieve the energy shortages. Also, the government is moving slowly to improve the poor national road and rail network, a long-standing barrier to sustained economic growth. On the positive side, growth was strong in 2003-06 and inflation is low and stable.\n\nGDP:\n\n$20.87 billion\n\nGDP growth rate:\n\n7% (2003 est.), 5.5% (2005 est.), 6% (2007 est.)\n\nGDP per capita:\n\n$4,500 (2003 est.), $4,900 (2005 est.), $5,800 (2007 est.)\n\nGDP composition by sector:\n\nagriculture: 21.2%\n\nindustry: 20.5%\n\nservices: 58.3% (2007 est.)\n\nInflation rate:\n\n3.3% (2003), 2.4% (2005 est.), 2.5% (2006), 2.9% (2007 est.)\n\nLabor force:\n\n1.09 million (not including 352,000 emigrant workers) (2006 est.)\n\nLabor force - by occupation:\n\nagriculture: 58%\n\nindustry: 15%\n\nservices: 27% (September 2006 est.)\n\nUnemployment:\n\n13.8% official rate, but may exceed 30% due to preponderance of near-subsistence farming (2006 est.)\n\nBudget:\n\nrevenues: $2.608 billion\n\nexpenditures: $3.1 billion; including capital expenditures of $710 million (2007 est.)\n\nElectricity production by source:\n\nfossil fuel: 2.9%\n\nhydro: 97.1%\n\nother: 0%\n\nIndustries:\n\nfood processing, textiles and clothing; lumber, oil, cement, chemicals, mining, basic metals, hydropower\n\nAgriculture:\n\nwheat, corn, potatoes, vegetables, fruits, sugar beets, grapes; meat, dairy products\n\nExports:\n\ntextiles and footwear; asphalt, metals and metallic ores, crude oil; vegetables, fruits, tobacco\n\nExport partners:\n\nItaly 60.7%, Greece 9.1%, China 6.5%, Serbia and Montenegro 5.3% (2007)\n\nImports:\n\nmachinery and equipment, foodstuffs, textiles, chemicals\n\nCurrency:\n\nlek (ALL)\n\nSOURCES: The CIA World Factbook, U.S. Department of State, Area Handbook of the US Library of Congress"
