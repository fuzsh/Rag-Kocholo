        "text": "In March 1992 communism came to a violent end in Albania, the world’s most isolated communist state. Finally, three years after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, the country set out on the road toward democracy. But the personality cult of the communist dictator Enver Hoxha (deceased 1985) continues unabated. The Socialist Party of Albania (PartiaSocialiste e Shqipërisë, PSSh) that was founded in June 1991 is nothing less than a latter-day reincarnation of communist Albania’s ruling Party of Labour (Partia e Punës e Shqipërisë, PPSH).\n\nWhat changed was only one word in the name. Nothing else. This new-old party (PSSh) claims to be glad that the era of the dictatorship of proletariat is over, yet they continue to glorify the brutal decades of Albania’s Stalinist-style communism. Each year the party’s leaders attend anniversaries that celebrate communist partisan victories during the Second World War. The anti-communist guerrillas who also fought against Italian and German occupants are virtually ignored.\n\nCommunist legacy with a tight grip on politics\n\nMeanwhile, three classical communist parties were established in post-communist Albania: the Communist Party of Albania (Partia Komuniste e Shqipërisë), the 8 November Communist Party of Albania (Partia Komuniste e Shqipërisë 8 Nëntori), and the Reorganised Party of Labour of Albania (Partia e Punës e Shqipërisë e Riorganizuar). Their ideological profile is shared by the pro-communist Union of War Veterans (Bashkimi i Veteranëve të Luftës), a hub for surviving communist partisans, their descendants and their sympathisers. The union and these three parties seize every occasion to demonstrate in the streets with portraits of Enver Hoxha held high. They never forget to commemorate the anniversaries of the dictator’s birth and death (16th October and 11th April, respectively), and the founding of the PSSh in 1941 (8 November).\n\nOn 16 September 1942 a conference was held near Tirana in the village of Pezë. The Conference of Peza (Pezë) was attended by all Albanian political and religious factions. They established a unified National Liberation Movement (Lëvizja Antifashiste Nacional-Çlirimtare, LANÇ) for fighting against Italian (and later German) occupants. With time, the PPSh, led by Enver Hoxha, seized effective control of the LANÇ. Together they took power after the war, forming the new People’s Socialist Republic according to Stalinist principles. Hoxha ruled for the vast majority of the state’s existence, until his death in 1985.\n\nOn 16th September 2018, the leaders of the three communist parties, along with the Union of War Veterans, turned the celebrations of the 76th anniversary of the Conference of Peza into a commemoration of dictator Enver Hoxha.\n\nOn the same September day, the inhabitants of Tepelena, a town in southern Albania, celebrated the 75th anniversary of their town’s liberation from German occupation. On this occasion, Tepelana’s mayor, Tërmet Peçi, alongside the members of the municipality board, publicly sang a communist anthem in praise of Hoxha. Immediately afterward, MP Tritan Shehu from the Democratic Party of Albania (Partia Demokratike e Shqipërisë, PDSh) protested and lodged a formal complaint with Prime Minister Edi Rama (who also leads the PSSh), requesting the mayor be summarily released from the post. A public procurator opened a legal case against Peçi. But it remains to be seen whether this mayor will face any repercussions, given that at present the Socialist Party (PSSh) rules Albania, and its members frequently venerate Hoxha in a rather blatant and unrestricted manner. It appears they have no sympathy or respect for the tens of thousands of victims of Hoxha’s murderous regime.\n\nNew ways to deal with the past\n\nThe Institute for Exploring the Crimes of Communism is working hard to make evidence of communist-era crimes public, but much work remains to be done.\n\nNot long ago a group of young citizens founded the organization “Qendresa Qytetare” (Civil Resistance) which among others has produced an interesting documentary film called “Interview with Dictator”. The film presents the life of the former communist leader using modern cinematography. The cinema Millenium in the centre of Tirana was full of people for the premiere, most of them young.\n\nIt was a pity that national media was absent.\n\nIn the film the dictator answers questions, referring to official documents. Below is a translated and shorter transcript of this imagined interview.\n\nBardhyl Selimi is a retired teacher of mathematics, born in Kosovo in 1945. He has published articles about mathematics and its relation to philosophy. He is an activist of the Esperanto movement.\n\nInterview with a dictator\n\nWho are you? Why do people honour you?\n\nMy name is Enver Hoxha. I’m the person who brought\n\ncommunism to Albania and have managed this country with a\n\nsteady hand for 40 years. Without my care, Albania ran the risk\n\nof falling into the hands of democratic reactionaries, a sad fate\n\nthat befell many countries in Eastern Europe after the Second World War.\n\nWhat was your childhood like?\n\nI was born in the town of Gjirokaster. I had a modest childhood,\n\nsplit between Gjirokastër and the small city of Korça, where I\n\nwent to school. At the age of 22 I was studying in France, but returned home\n\nthanks to a scholarship offered to me by King Zog the First.a But\n\ndue to my poor grades, the state suspended my scholarship and I\n\ncould not finish university.\n\nLater, once I was the one in power, I took my revenge. I kicked\n\nout Zog and put a price on his head. I put the former minister of\n\neducation, an aged nationalist by the name of Mirash Ivanaj, in\n\nprison, where he lived out his years.\n\nWhat do you hate the most?\n\nGod! Communist materialism cannot accept religious\n\nspiritualism. God and religion were serious\n\nobstacles in the creation of the new, socialist people. The centre\n\nof all should be I, leader of the Albanian\n\nCommunist Party, and to achieve it, we communists had to\n\nadopt extreme measures!\n\nMy comrades and I declared Albanians nonreligious by law.\n\nAccording to the Penal Code, everybody who makes the sign of\n\nthe cross or kneels to pray, even within his own home, is to be\n\ncondemned to ten years in prison.\n\nWhat happened to religious objects built before then?\n\nDuring our rule, we succeed in closing 2189 churches, mosques\n\nand masjids. These objects have been returned to the people by\n\ntransforming them into culture houses, decorated with portraits\n\nof Marx and Lenin. We use others as storehouses, depots or\n\nprisons. We destroyed the rest.\n\nWhat happened to the leaders of religion, priests and\n\nmullahs?\n\nI declared them enemies of the people. Since the year 1945 I\n\nhave been signing death sentences for the clerics. But the\n\nresistance of these Servants of God has been incredible.\n\nNeedless to say, the most educated have already been executed.\n\nThousands of mullahs have been imprisoned, while others have\n\nseen the light of reason and shaved off their beards.\n\nMaintaining power is of course more important than\n\nattaining it. How did you manage to keep going?\n\nVery true! We succeed using the most effective political method\n\nknown: terror. Just after I took power in 1945, I founded the\n\nState Security apparatus. This structure arrested 5021 citizens\n\nthat year. During its existence 958 people were killed without\n\ntrial. They have loyally oppressed all opposition in the country\n\nand have persecuted anybody who did not accept my regime.\n\nEvery Albanian was registered and under surveillance at home\n\nand at work. The state needed to know his thoughts, whether he\n\nwas content or had complaints about the way I was running the\n\ncountry. We seized all the assets of the rich, and persecuted all\n\nintellectuals and patriots who did not believe in\n\ncommunism.\n\nDid you try to keep Kosovo within the Albanian territory?\n\nNo. After Mukje, we understood that Kosovo was not to be on\n\nour agenda. A few years later, in a meeting of our Party\n\nCentral Committee on December 1945, I spoke about the\n\nKosovo affair. I said that it was not progressive to pursue it any\n\nfurther. On the contrary, we had to do all we could to encourage\n\nbrotherly love between the Kosovars and the Yugoslavs…\n\nBut in your final years your attention returned to Kosovo.\n\nWhy?\n\nNot only to Kosovo. I was trying to develop my image as a\n\npatriot. Patriotism was the only rallying cry left after we lost our\n\ncommunist allies. I succeed. Many Albanians today really think\n\nI was a patriot.\n\nMany others honour you for the construction of Albania…\n\nWith an iron fist we got all our prisoners to work. Since we\n\ndidn’t have to pay them, we could achieve big things: dikes,\n\nchannels, factories, mills, airports, hospitals, farms and housing\n\nblocs. It’s true that the credit is ultimately mine though, as I\n\ncame up with all the ideas.\n\nIn what manner did the prisoners build the country?\n\nThey had no choice of course. Enemies were punished and\n\nimprisoned. Albania had 23 prisons and 48 prison-camps, which\n\nemployed enforced labor to power the most difficult sectors of\n\nthe economy.\n\nWhy were Albanians so isolated under your rule?\n\nOnly traitors wanted to fly from Albania, those people who did\n\nnot want to build socialism, our holy aim. So anyone who\n\nwanted to see the outside world was punished or executed.\n\nAlmost 6000 Albanians were executed at the border while they\n\ntried to flee. We considered even those who watched foreign TV\n\nchannels to be traitors.\n\nLast question: can you explain why most of your comrades\n\nwere also punished by your regime?\n\nIt is not difficult for me to answer. As Miladin Popovich said:\n\nThe Party strengthens itself by cleansing. When enemies are\n\nmissing, you cook up them.\n\nOver my 40 years in power, I liked to spice things up with some\n\ngood cleansing. Ordinary citizens and party members alike. I\n\nexecuted 9 ministers. In 1974 alone I cleaned up the chief\n\nmanagers, headquarters, former war comrades, and\n\nanother 500 officers in the army.\n\nIn the economic sphere, in 1975 alone we arrested the chief\n\nmanagers of the country. Their families were interned. We also\n\ncleansed culture. I would like to highlight the arrests of artists\n\nwho contributed to eleventh Festival of Chanson.\n\nOn February 18, 1984 I incurred a cerebral ischaemia. It made it\n\ndifficult to run the country."
