        "text": "Italian architecture\n\nWell-known architects of the Mussolini period in Italy, Florestano de Fausto and Armando Brasini, were the masterminds behind the construction of the main square, which today bears the name of the Albanian National Hero Skanderbeg, the huge boulevard, ministry buildings, national bank, the town hall and the Palace of Brigades (former royal palace, today the presidential palace). In 1939, Tirana was captured by Fascist forces that appointed a puppet government. The Italian architect Gherardo Bosio was asked to elaborate on previous plans and introduce a new project for the area of the present-day Mother Teresa Square. By the early 1940s, the southern end of the main boulevard and the surrounding buildings were finished and renamed with Fascist names.\n\nInteresting facts\n\nTirana’s name is mentioned for the first time in a Venetian document of 1418. The first record of its population was compiled by the invading Ottomans in 1431–1432, revealing some 1,000 houses and 7,300 inhabitants. A century and a half later, in the registration of 1583, Tirana had 20,000 inhabitants. In 1769, Tirana and surroundings exported 2,600 barrels of olive oil. At the beginning of the 20th century Tirana area had 140,000 olive trees and 400 oil mills, while the market numbered 700 shops. In 1990, the city had 250,000 inhabitants, while it now numbers more than 700,000, perhaps as much as one million, due to a demographic shift with people from all over the country heading towards the capital.\n\nGeographic location\n\nTirana is the capital city of Albania, a country in south-eastern Europe with a coastline that runs from the Adriatic Sea to Ionian Sea. It is situated in the south-west of the Balkan Peninsula, between Greece to the south, the Republic of Macedonia to the east and Montenegro and Kosovo to the north. Tirana itself is positioned just west of the centre of the country, with the Adriatic coast only 30 km away.\n\nTAGS: Good To Know for Tirana, History of Tirana, about Tirana, Communist style in Tirana, Explore Tirana"
