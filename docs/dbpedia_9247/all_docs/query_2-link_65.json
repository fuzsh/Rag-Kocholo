This was a congress of militant socialism. The 8th Congress recorded the triumphant advance of socialism over the last five years since the 7th Congress, and set down the tasks for the further strengthening of working class rule, for the nonstop development of socialist construction, and for guaranteeing a prosperous and happy life for the Albanian people. Comrade Enver Hoxha delivered the Report on the Activity of the Central Committee, which was the main document of the Congress setting forth the line and analysis of the Party. The 8th Congress reaffirmed the Marxist-Leninist principles and stands which the PLA has unwaveringly adhered to in the course of its 40 years of militant revolutionary activity. This Special Issue of The Workers Advocate is devoted to acquainting the American working class and progressive people with this important congress.\n\nNonstop Advance of Socialism\n\nThe 8th Congress of the PLA measured the forward strides of Albania's socialist construction and charted a course for its further dynamic development. The thriving economy of socialist Albania stands in stark contrast to the crisis- ridden capitalist and revisionist world which is in the grip of universal stagnation and decay. In the U.S. more than nine million workers are unemployed. The catastrophe in Poland is the most dramatic example of the crisis shaking the revisionist countries. Only socialist Albania forges, ahead unshaken by the world capitalist economic crisis. This is a concrete expression of the immense strength and vitality of genuine socialism.\n\nSocialist construction in Albania is forging ahead in the face of the bitter imperialist and revisionist encirclement and pressure. The Albanian working class and people have successfully overcome the criminal sabotage of the Chinese revisionists and all the other obstacles which have confronted them over the last period.\n\nThe Chinese revisionists, on the other hand, along with the Yugoslav, Polish and other revisionists and traitors, are down on their knees begging the imperialists for alms to help pull them out of their crisis. But in socialist Albania there is no crisis.\n\nThe Albanian working class and people are marching ahead entirely on their own efforts.\n\nThe 7th Five-Year Plan, which was adopted at the 8th Congress, is the first plan that will be fulfilled without any credits or aid from abroad whatsoever. This is an historic victory for socialism in Albania and a militant example to the working and oppressed peoples everywhere who are striving for freedom from imperialist and revisionist slavery.\n\nThe 8th Congress stressed that socialist construction is not only a problem of economic growth, but also of strengthening the socialist character of the economy, perfecting the socialist relations of production, and carrying forward the class struggle. This orientation is essential to prevent the emergence of a bourgeois-bureaucratic stratum, to block the way to the tragedy of capitalist restoration as took place in the Soviet Union, and to carry forward the process of the socialist revolution.\n\nAs Comrade Mehmet Shehu stated in his Report on the 7th Five-Year Plan, \"On this vital question, the Party has adhered to the Marxist-Leninist thesis that if the socialist relations of production degenerate there is not and cannot be socialism, however developed the productive forces may be. Herein lies one of the main lines of demarcation between us and the modern revisionists.'' (p. 148) Speaking of \"the further deepening and uninterrupted development of the class struggle,\" Comrade Mehmet stressed that \"To underrate this class struggle, which is waged in all fields of socialist construction, meansto open the way to the birth of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism. This our Party has never permitted and never will permit.\" (p. 172)\n\nThe Congress paid close attention to further improving and strengthening the state power of the working people, the whole political system of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Comrade Enver's Report spoke to perfecting the relationship between the Party and the other mass organizations and state organs, of the cadres to the masses, and of the executive and administrative bodies to the elected and representative bodies.\n\nAs always the Congress stressed that basing all the activity of the Party and the masses on Marxist-Leninist science, not empiricism and practicism, is a fundamental condition for further success. The Congress paid particular attention to the problems of the ideological struggle among the masses, of the struggle against alien manifestations and to arm the working people with the Marxist- Leninist world outlook. It set forward the tasks for the further development of the new socialist man, the man imbued with socialist consciousness.\n\nIn all its work, the Congress laid stress on strengthening the Party, ensuring its leading role, and enhancing the effectiveness of the Party's activity. In his Report Comrade Enver Hoxha stressed that: \"The experience of our Party over 40 years proves that only a party, which is based firmly on Marxist- Leninist science, can become the true leader of the working class, can achieve its hegemony and ensure the triumph of the revolution and the construction of socialist society.... This has been and remains a law for us. The single and indivisible leadership of the Party is the source of all the victories in the socialist construction and the surest guarantee for the brilliant future we are building.\" (p. 23, Proletarian Internationalism edition)\n\nA Resolute Stand Against All Imperialism\n\nFrom the platform of the 8th Congress, the PLA once again proclaimed to the world its unbending stand against U.S. imperialism and Soviet social-imperialism and against all imperialism and reaction.\n\n\"The superpowers,\" Comrade Enver Hoxha declared, \"individually and jointly, are the most ferocious enemies of the freedom and independence of the peoples, the protectors and guarantors of reactionary regimes, supporters of national bondage to foreigners and instigators of feuds and conflicts between nations. Their policy contains the direct danger that mankind is hurled into a third world war.\" (p. 51, edition)\n\nThe Report forcefully condemned U.S. imperialism, stating that: 'In one way or the other, in this or that form, all the peoples encounter the interference of and are threatened by the aggressive policy of American imperialism, which represents the greatest capitalist power of our time and the main defender of the bourgeois-imperialist system.\" (Ibid.) Comrade Enver Hoxha denounced the warmongering Reagan policy which he links to the policy of Carter. He said that U.S. imperialism \"has begun to apply a harsher, more aggressive and more adventurous line in foreign policy,\" a line that can be seen in the new warmongering doctrine that was \"begun by Carter and further developed by Reagan.\" (p. 52, PI edition)\n\nSpeaking about Soviet social-imperialism, the Report declared: \"Today the hegemonic and expansionist policy for the establishment of world domination, the adventurous course for the preparation and incitement of war also characterize Soviet social-imperialism, the global strategy of which and especially the way in which it is applied have likewise become more aggressive.\" (Ibid.) Condemning the Soviet aggression in Afghanistan and elsewhere, the Report underscores that \"The policy of the Soviet Union has assumed the same aggressive, expansionist, warmongering features as those of the United States of America.\" (Ibid.)\n\nComrade Enver Hoxha also strongly condemned the aggressive strategy of the other imperialist powers. In regards to the imperialists of Western Europe his Reportpoints out that: \"The European members of NATO have now organized and strengthened their economic potential within their countries and abroad, have strengthened their own military arsenal, and have created their reactionary organism -- the European Common Market.... The strategy of the European monopolies is aimed at the transformation of Europe, first into an economic superpower, then into a political superpower, and later still into a military superpower.\" (p. 56, PIedition)\n\nLikewise the Reportdenounces Chinese social-imperialism and the aggressive U.S.-China alliance. It points out among other things that: \"Already a new imperialist alliance between the United States, Japan and China has taken form in the Far East, and this constitutes another danger that local wars, or a general war will break out. ' ' (Ibid.)\n\nThe Reportcondemns the neo-colonialist system of imperialist and social- imperialist enslavement of the oppressed peoples. Along with this, Comrade Enver Hoxha exposes the Yugoslav revisionist concepts of \"non-alignment,\" the Chinese revisionist theory of \"three worlds,\" and the hullabaloo about \"a new international economic order,\" as ideological weapons in the hands of the enslaving interests of the neo-colonialist powers.\n\nSpeaking on a global scale Comrade Enver Hoxha points out that: \"In order to emerge from the chaos which capitalism creates, to escape once and for all capitalist oppression and exploitation, the neo-colonialist yoke of foreigners and the domination of reaction, there is no other course apart from the revolution, the overthrow of imperialism and capitalism.\n\n\"The struggle of the peoples, the struggle of the proletariat against their enemies will surge ahead. It is an objective historical process which no force can stop.\" (p. 59, PI edition)\n\nUnyielding Struggle Against Modern Revisionism\n\nAt its 8th Congress, the PLA again displayed its unyielding loyalty to the revolutionary principles of Marxism- Leninism. Comrade Enver Hoxha's Reportvehemently condemns the Soviet, Chinese, Yugoslav and \"Eurocommunism\" revisionists, betrayers of the working class, the revolution and Marxism-Leninism.\n\nThe Reportexposes the thoroughly capitalist and imperialist nature of the present-day Soviet Union. And it warns against the great and pressing danger which Soviet revisionism represents. \"More than any other variant of revisionism,\" the Reportpoints out, Soviet revisionism \"retains its socialist disguise and Leninist phraseology in order to cover up the present-day capitalist reality of the Soviet Union and its aggressive imperialist foreign policy. It is a revisionism which has seized power in a state which is a great power and has ample means and possibilities to exert its influence in the world, to operate in many directions and on a large scale.\" (p. 72, PIedition)\n\nSpeaking of the great struggle which the PLA has waged against Chinese revisionism, Comrade Enver Hoxha stressed the immense harm which Mao Zedong Thought brought onto the Chinese Communist Party and the revolution in China. \"In the future too,\" his Reportdeclared, \"the Party of Labor of Albania will continue its consistent principled struggle for the complete exposure of Chinese revisionism, for the establishment of a clear-cut dividing line between Marxism-Leninism and the anti-Marxist ideas of Mao Zedong. Without denouncing and rejecting Mao Zedong thought, without combating and eradicating any influence of it in the revolutionary movement, there can be no serious talk about the struggle against Chinese revisionism or against modern revisionism as a whole, the Marxist- Leninist movement cannot be properly consolidated and developed and the cause of the revolution carried forward successfully.\" (p. 76, PI edition)\n\nThe Congress also exposes the Yugoslav revisionists and their anti-socialist and capitalist system of so-called \"workers self-administration.\" It also sternly condemns the racist, chauvinist and anti-people crimes of the Yugoslav authorities against the Albanians of Kosova and other parts of Yugoslavia. At the same time it refutes the vicious slander campaign of the Yugoslav chieftains against socialist Albania, showing that Albania has never interfered in Yugoslav affairs and has consistently acted as a true friend of the Yugoslav peoples.\n\nUnderscoring the first-rate importance of combating the influence of the various currents of modern revisionism, Comrade Enver Hoxha's Reportstresses that: \"The liberation of the consciousness of the proletariat and the peoples from the inhibiting influence of revisionism, the dissemination of Marxism-Leninism which points out the only correct course for the struggle and victory, is a primary task today in order to carry forward the revolutionary process in each country and on a world scale.\" (p. 78, PIedition)\n\nA Congress of Militant Socialism\n\nIn a word, the 8th Congress of the PLA was a congress of militant proletarian socialism. The socialist reality which the^ Albanian people have created, with the PLA as their militant vanguard, is a great inspiration to the working class and downtrodden masses the world over. Socialist Albania provides a magnificent perspective of the socialist goal which the proletariat and people of the whole world aspire to. As Comrade Enver Hoxha pointed out in his Report: \"The ideas of genuine socialism have been and remain a great force to inspire, mobilize and organize the revolutionary struggle of the masses.\" (p. 77, PIedition)\n\nThe world bourgeoisie and its revisionist allies fight bitterly to wipe out this perspective of socialism. The capitalist propaganda proclaims that there is no alternative to this capitalist hell, and even if you do realize socialism then a capitalist restoration is inevitable. At the same time, in order to cloud the significance of genuine socialism, the capitalists and their revisionist liquidator allies propagate a whole grab bag of false models of socialism. These fake models range from the restored capitalism in the Soviet Union, to the Chinese revisionists' Maoist \"socialism,\" to the Yugoslav \"self-administration socialism,\" to \"Arab\" or \"African socialism,\" to even social-democratic \"Scandinavian socialism.\"\n\nBut the example of socialist Albania, the only genuinely socialist country in the world today, provides living proof that socialism and the prevention of capitalist restoration are the fully attainable objectives of the working class. Moreover the Albanian reality graphically demonstrates the wide gulf separating genuine socialism from revisionist state monopoly capitalism and all other fake models of socialism. The 8th Congress of the PLA provides a powerful confirmation of the fact that in Albania genuine socialism, that is the socialism of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, is being successfully built in life and death struggle with the capitalist and revisionist world.\n\n[Back to Top]\n\nMarxist-Leninist Parties from Around the World Attend the 8th Congress\n\nThe Party of Labor of Albania and the heroic Albanian people enjoy the love and affection of the and revolutionaries throughout the world. This was again demonstrated at the 8th Congress. Over 20 fraternal delegations came to attend the Congress from all the continents of the globe, making the Congress a militant internationalist gathering. In the course of the Congress, the representatives of the fraternal delegations greeted the PLA, discussed questions of the revolution, and conveyed the proletarian internationalist solidarity of the world's Marxist-Leninists for socialist Albania. Below we are printing excerpts from the speeches of some of the Marxist-Leninist parties who attended the 8th Congress. They have been taken from bulletins of the Albanian Telegraphic Agency reporting on the 8th Congress in early November.\n\nCOMMUNIST PARTY OF BRAZIL\n\nGreeting the Congress, the leader of the delegation of the Communist Party of Brazil, Joao Amazonas, First Secretary of the Central Committee, said, among other things:\n\nThe Communist Party of Brazil sends fraternal and cordial greetings to the 8th Congress of your beloved Party. I also greet the 40th anniversary of the founding of the heroic Party of Labor of Albania, which at the head of the people is constructing socialism, opening new horizons for the continuous progress and the complete victory of the great cause of the workers.\n\nWe shall never forget the invaluable aid of your 5th, 6th and 7th Congresses in the struggle against modern revisionism of all hues, a struggle which gave essential aid to the working people of all continents to clearly see the traitor role of the Soviet, Yugoslav, Chinese and \"Eurocommunist\" revisionists and others.\n\nComrade Joao Amazonas said: Your 8th Congress is holding its proceedings at very complicated moments, when the imperialist system is caught in insoluble problems, and when favorable conditions have been created for the proletarian revolution. Despite the revisionist capitulation and the reformist and deceptive activity of the deceivers of the working class, he said further, the idea of the revolution is being implanted ever more in the conscience of the broad masses. It is the only solution for the working people and the peoples which live under the imperialist and social-imperialist yoke.\n\nAlbania, he said, is successfully constructing socialism, with confidence in the future, setting a marvelous example of a fruitful activity, coping with and wisely solving new problems of the socialist construction, led by Marxism- Leninism. Here there is no rise in the cost of living, there is no inflation or unemployment, or insecurity of the morrow and no merciless plundering by the international financial capital. The selfless work of the people is carried out to their own benefit, for their own well-being, culture and the flourishing of their homeland. Here the red banner of proletarian socialism, which the renegades of the Soviet Union and other countries thought they had lowered once and for all, is flying proud and victorious, encouraging the struggle for freedom, peace, national independence, for a life without exploiters and exploited.\n\nThe Communist Party of Brazil, sister of the same ideals and of the struggle of the glorious Party of Labor of Albania, Joao Amazonas said in conclusion, feels itself honored to take a seat on the rostrum of your 8th Congress from where we express the feelings of profound friendship which unites the communists of our country with the Albanian communists, and at the same time, it expresses the unshaking confidence that we shall always act hand in hand in the common struggle for the triumph of the immortal cause of the proletariat. From this rostrum the Communist Party of Brazil reaffirms its determination to work for the strengthening of the internationalist unity of the world Marxist-Leninist movement, from which the triumph of the revolution in different countries depends on a great scale. Allow us, dear comrades, to wish you sincerely and cordially complete success in the realization of the objectives of the 7th Five-Year Plan and the great tasks and brilliant prospects which are foresightedly defined in the Report presented by our beloved Comrade Enver Hoxha, the distinguished Marxist-Leninist. The successes in the construction of socialism in Albania are victories of the working class of the entire world, are the triumph of the great and powerful doctrine of Marxism-Leninism.\n\nCOMMUNIST PARTY OF COLOMBIA (M-L)\n\nIn his message of greetings to the 8th Congress, the leader of the delegation of the Communist Party of Colombia (Marxist-Leninist), the First Secretary of the Central Committee, said:\n\nIn this period the most important success of a historic and political value for the consolidation and development of the Marxist-Leninist movement is constituted by the victories of socialism in Albania and the strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat under the correct leadership of the PLA.\n\nThe rich experience of the Albanian communists, their great achievements in the construction of socialism, the victories in their struggle against imperialism, social-imperialism and reaction, their determined struggle against revisionism of all hues are important victories not only for the PLA led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, but also for the Marxist-Leninist movement and the revolutionaries.\n\nThe Marxist-Leninist thesis of Comrade Enver Hoxha, namely that the revolution is a problem put forth for solution, now assumes even greater force. This means that we must oppose the imperialist war with the revolution.\n\nThe sharpening of the class struggle all over the world, the deepening of the crisis of the whole capitalist system and the perspective of the revolution raise the need for the strengthening of the unity of the international proletariat, and in the first place, of its political vanguard -- the Marxist-Leninist communist parties.\n\nThe international Marxist-Leninist movement must unify its common tactic and activity in order to counter and destroy fascism and the imperialist war. The struggle against fascism and the threat of war must not circumscribe the objectives of the proletariat within the democratic reforms. We must forcefully raise the banner of the revolution and socialism which, kept aloft by the true Marxist-Leninist parties with determination, will lead to the triumph of the proletariat and the peoples over their most savage enemies.\n\nAs Comrade Enver Hoxha has said, \"Proletarian internationalism is the unity of thought and action of the proletariat of each country and of the world proletariat in general for the purpose of overthrowing the old capitalist world by violence, smashing the power of the bourgeoisie to its foundations and becoming the master of the means of production and everything else that serves the capitalists for the exploitation of man by man.\"\n\nOn behalf of the Colombian Marxist-Leninists who have taken positions in the trenches of their struggle, he said in conclusion, we wish great successes to the 8th Congress of the PLA which undoubtedly will guarantee new and greater victories for the Albanian working class and people to the benefit of the revolutionary cause of the proletariat and the peoples all over the world.\n\nCOMMUNIST PARTY OF DENMARK (M-L)\n\nGreeting the Congress, the leader of the delegation of the Communist Party of Denmark (Marxist-Leninist), Klaus Ris Klausen, First Secretary of the Central Committee, said, among other things:\n\nThe Party of Labor and its Central Committee, with Comrade Enver Hoxha at the head, always raised high the invincible principles of Marxism-Leninism at a time when world imperialism and modern revisionism made the most ferocious attacks on socialism, the international communist movement and the revolution in order to avoid their own final doom. The PLA has unmasked all the variants of modern revisionism, Titoite, Khrushchovite, \"Eurocommunist\" and Chinese modern revisionism, which bases itself on the opportunist ideas of so-called Mao Zedong Thought, always assisting the revolution, the proletariat and the peoples as well as the new Marxist-Leninist parties.\n\nCOMMUNIST PARTY OF LABOR OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC\n\nThe leader of the delegation of the Communist Party of Labor of the Dominican Republic (Partido Comunista del Trabajo), Rafael Chaljub Mejia, General Secretary of the Party, said in his greeting:\n\nOn behalf of the Communist Party of Labor, the working class, and the entire people of the Dominican Republic, we greet the 8th Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania.\n\nAfter the achievement of its national independence violated by Nazi-fascist invasion, Albania entered with determination the road of socialist construction. It has denounced the maneuvers and acts of aggression of the imperialists, has withstood them and has defended the purity of the theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, betrayed by the Yugoslav and Soviets, \"Eurocommunist\" and Chinese revisionists, which on various occasions, but with the same cynicism and betrayal, have launched attacks and used maneuvers against the Party of Labor of Albania and the PSR of Albania.\n\nThe Communist Party of Labor of the Dominican Republic is fighting to consolidate its ranks and build itself up as a tempered and militant vanguard according to the Leninist-Stalinist concept of the party and to strengthen its links with the proletariat and masses of the people, with the aim of turning into reality, arms in hand, the objectives: independence and progress, socialism and freedom which are so dear to the Dominican people.\n\nThe Communist Party of Labor is aware that to achieve this it is necessary to keep always aloft the struggle against Soviet, Titoite, \"Eurocommunist\" revisionism and the Chinese one and its source in the so-called Mao Zedong Thought, which had previously had its influence on us. In this struggle the Communist Party of Labor has drawn lessons from the experience of the Party of Labor of Albania, especially by the deep study of the works of Comrade Enver Hoxha such as Imperialism and the Revolution, Eurocommunism Is Anti- Communism, With Stalin, The Khrushchevites, etc.\n\nMARXIST-LENINIST COMMUNIST PARTY OF ECUADOR\n\nIn his greetings to the Congress, the leader of the delegation of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Ecuador, Pasqual Prado, Secretary of the Central Committee, said:\n\nOn behalf of the Central Committee and all the members of our Party, the working class and people of Ecuador, we warmly greet this Congress, greet the entire Party and the people of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania.\n\nThe achievements which within 37 years have completely transformed feudal-bourgeois Albania into a socialist country with advanced industry and modern agriculture, with culture and education, with work, well-being and security for all its sons, with complete sovereignty and independence, are a direct result of the correct and unwavering leadership of the PLA, of its indomitable unity with the working class and the people, of the fearless and merciless struggle against all the internal and external enemies.\n\nHe said further on that the revolutionary activity of the Party of Labor of Albania is guided by and based on the ever-living scientific theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin; it is guided by loyalty to this theory and its consistency to it in putting into life proletarian internationalism, by vigilance and high exemplary courage in the defense of the purity of Marxism-Leninism, to mercilessly fight against all the opportunist and revisionist trends which in the last 25 years have tried to disorientate the proletariat and the peoples and deviate them from the correct revolutionary path. We are confident of this because the Party of Labor of Albania is a party which has been able to build, uphold, strengthen and continually develop the dictatorship of the proletariat, which gave it the possibility to lead the Albanian people on the road of socialism, in a state of encirclement, coping with the sabotage, blackmail and aggressions by imperialism and social-imperialism, be it Soviet or Chinese.\n\nThe crisis of the capitalist system in our country, he continued, is extending and deepening. Dissatisfaction and indignation of the masses are becoming more general and are gradually being expressed in strikes and other fighting actions. The objective conditions for the democratic and anti-imperialist revolution exist, and with the struggle of the Party the process of their ripening will be carried out rapidly.\n\nFor the proper implementation of our great tasks, Pasqual Prado said in conclusion, the effective solidarity of the fraternal Marxist-Leninist parties is necessary. Therefore the strengthening and development of the world Marxist- Leninist communist movement, its steel unity round the consistent theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism are a vital necessity at these moments when the proletariat and the people expect and seek the leadership of the Marxist-Leninists.\n\nWORKERS' COMMUNIST PARTY OF FRANCE\n\nIn her greeting the leader of the delegation of the Workers' Communist Party of France, Chantal, said:\n\nThe entire history of your Party, since its founding, is characterized by the irreconcilable, uninterrupted and principled struggle it has waged against opportunism and revisionism, against imperialism and reaction.\n\nThe 8th Congress of the PL A, she said, is the congress of the living and acting socialism, of the triumphant construction of socialism in Albania, at a time when in the whole world of the imperialist and revisionist camp there is only war, misery, unemployment and death. This Congress, which reaffirms once again the principles of socialism as defined by Lenin, and develops them further on the basis of the teachings of history, shows to the peoples of the world that scientific socialism is the most advanced social order in the world, the only one created for man.\n\nCOMMUNIST PARTY OF GERMANY\n\nGreeting the Congress, the leader of the delegation of the Communist Party of Germany, Ernst Aust, Chairman of the Party, said, among other things:\n\nIt is a joy for me on the occasion of the 8th Congress of your Party and the 40th anniversary of its foundation, to bring the glorious Party of Labor of Albania, with Comrade Enver Hoxha at the head, and the entire heroic Albanian people, the most fraternal, militant and cordial greetings of the Communist Party of Germany and the revolutionary workers of the Federal German Republic.\n\nVery great have been the difficulties for your country during the last five years, he said. The undermining activity of the Chinese revisionists caused damage. Despite this you succeeded to fulfill the main targets of the 6th Five- Year Plan; therefore you are able now to realize the new five-year plan, relying completely on your own resources and the creative and productive forces of your people.\n\nAt a time when the capitalist world of the West and that of the state capitalism of the East are ever deeper plunging into the crisis, when prices are spiraling, unemployment, suffering and poverty are rising, you march with sure steps on the construction of socialism. The modern revisionists speak much of records they want to attain in the international level of technique. They are record men, but in the loans they take from the capitalists from the West.\n\nSpeaking of the successes of the Albanian people, he said: you have the ratio two to one between higher and lower wages, you are a country without taxes, you have health service free of charge, etc. At a time when your average life span has reached 70, in our country it is on the decrease.\n\nWhat characterizes your country is the unity and solidarity among people. At a time when you say: one for all and all for one, the motto of capitalism is: one against the other, all against all! Two years have gone by since the earthquake destroyed large areas in north Albania, and in five months' time no trace remained of its destruction. New houses and new villages were built at a time when in other countries the earthquake victims live in miserable barracks and shelters even though many years have passed by.\n\nNo earthquake, no encirclement, no blockade, no threat of the imperialists can affect socialist Albania. Its Party and people stand firm like your mountains.\n\nThe Party of Labor of Albania, Ernst Aust said in conclusion, carries the triumphant banner of Marxism-Leninism unwaveringly forward and sets a brilliant example to the workers and working people of all countries. We, too, stand firm and unwavering beside you in the struggle against capitalism, against imperialism and against revisionism of all hues, for the triumph of the world proletarian revolution.\n\nCOMMUNIST PARTY OF JAPAN (LEFT)\n\nIn his message of greetings to the 8th Congress, the leader of the delegation of the Communist Party of Japan (Left), Toshio Jasudo, member of the Political Bureau and Secretariat of the Central Committee, said:\n\nThrough the previous five-year plans the heroic Albanian people have scored great victories in all fields, victories which have proved to the whole world the superiority and vitality of the socialist order. In particular, during the 6th Five-Year Plan the socialist Albanian economy developed with sure steps. This success was achieved at a time when all the other states of the world found themselves in very great chaos because of the deepening of the economic crisis which swept the whole world, both the capitalist and the revisionist countries. It was also achieved in struggle against international imperialism and modern revisionism.\n\nOur two Parties, that of Japan and Albania, he stressed, are fraternal parties fighting for a common ideal and united through the red thread of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. Your victories are ours, too.\n\nCOMMUNIST PARTY OF NEW ZEALAND\n\nThe leader of the delegation of the Communist Party of New Zealand, Jack Lock, member of the Central Committee, said in his greeting:\n\nOn the occasion of the 8th Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of New Zealand conveys warm fraternal greetings to the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania and the First Secretary, Comrade Enver Hoxha. Likewise, through the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania, we extend our fraternal greetings to the heroic Albanian people. Likewise, we express to you our revolutionary greetings on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Party of Labor of Albania.\n\nThe Party of Labor of Albania has resolutely abided by the principles of Marxism-Leninism and has been in the forefront of the struggle to expose those who try to replace the hegemony of the working class allegedly with the so-called \"third world,'' those who try to replace revolution with reformism, those who attack the party which relies on democratic centralism, wanting to instill in it the theories on the existence of \"two lines'' in the party.\n\nThe existence of socialism in Albania, he said further on, is the result of the fact that the Party of Labor of Albania has correctly abided by the principles of Marxism-Leninism. The banner of socialism which flutters in Albania is an inspiration and example to the Marxist-Leninists and the. workers of the entire world.\n\nPERUVIAN COMMUNIST PARTY (M-L)\n\nIn his message of greetings, the leader of the delegation of the Peruvian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), Antonio Fernandez, Secretary General of the Party, said, among other things:\n\nThe Party of Labor of Albania is the genuine representative and defender of the working class and working people of Albania and a glorious detachment of the world communist movement. Founded as an historical necessity in the process of stern class struggle, through the efforts of heroic Marxist-Leninist fighters, under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, your Party always upholds the revolutionary principles of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.\n\nThe Party of Labor of Albania, which seized power through people's war, has known how to adhere with loyalty to the universal principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat, which, as Lenin said, is the basis of Marxism. In the 40 years of its existence and in the entire period of the successful construction of socialism, it has stuck to this principle with determination, exposing the betrayal of Khrushchovite revisionism which replaced the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat with the \"state of the entire people,'' as well as the distortions made by Maoist revisionism which replaced the principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat with the so-called \"common dictatorship of the entire people,'' including the bourgeoisie, as well. The about-turn and revisionist degeneration of the Soviet Union, where capitalism has been restored, the stagnation and degeneration of the Chinese revolution, which did not go beyond its democratic-bourgeois stage of the old type, are historical proof that the old economic and political state can be destroyed only by the dictatorship of the proletariat, that socialism can be built successfully and the transition to communism, the classless society, can be ensured only through the dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nThe Party of Labor of Albania, as a bolshevik party, has achieved its ideological, political and organizational unity which has ensured its continuous strengthening and consolidation, as an invaluable weapon for the successful construction of socialism. It has known how to work out a single revolutionary Marxist-Leninist political line, because the working class is one and its party is also one.\n\nIn monolithic unity around a single revolutionary line, the Party of Labor of Albania has always stood in the forefront of the struggle against all forms of opportunism and revisionism, making a great contribution to the exposure of Soviet and Chinese revisionism.\n\nThe Party of Labor of Albania, guided by Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism and the wise teachings of Comrade Enver Hoxha, leader of the Albanian people and great Marxist-Leninist who is making an invaluable contribution to the science of Marxism-Leninism, is a great inspiration and an example of revolutionary proletarian determination for the Peruvian Communist Party (M-L).\n\nThe Party of Labor of Albania and the Peruvian Communist Party (M-L), he said in conclusion,.have been and will be in the same trench of the struggle against imperialism, Soviet social-imperialism, Chinese social-imperialism and all reactionaries.\n\nPORTUGUESE COMMUNIST PARTY (RECONSTRUCTED)\n\nThe greeting of the leader of the delegation of the Portuguese Communist Party (Reconstructed), Jose Alves, member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, said:\n\nOn behalf of the Portuguese Communist Party (Reconstructed), its Central Committee and militants, on behalf of the Portuguese workers who are struggling to turn their country into a country of proletarian socialism like Albania, we greet through you all the Albanian communists.\n\nWe hail the Albania of the dictatorship of the proletariat, of genuine socialist democracy. We hail Albania, where the workers defeated the despicable economic sabotage of the Chinese revisionists and, mobilizing all their internal forces, have thrown themselves into an assault for the fulfillment of the first five-year plan relying completely on their own forces. With its struggle and creative work, Albania asserts itself in the eyes of the proletariat as the representative of the new world, the socialist world, which will triumph over the decadent capitalist and revisionist world through revolution. The Albanian working people, united under the leadership of the PLA with Comrade Enver Hoxha at the head, are showing the world that proletarian socialism lives and is triumphing over its enemies.\n\nThe historic significance of the Report submitted by Comrade Enver Hoxha to the 7th Congress for the communist movement is fully corroborated in our days. It echoed like a great revolutionary call to all the communists of the world in defense of the principles of Marxism-Leninism against all the revisionist currents. The further promotion of this struggle through a Marxist-Leninist criticism of the so-called Mao Zedong Thought, by revealing its anti-proletarian and revisionist essence, as well as the works of Comrade Enver Hoxha, which were published in that period, were of fundamental importance for the communist movement in taking a decisive step.\n\nAfter speaking of the struggle waged by the Portuguese Communist Party (Reconstructed) as a party of revolutionary action of the masses, he said:\n\nDevelopments in the world today require that we must be prepared for a more arduous struggle and to utilize the revolutionary situations to our advantage. An uninterrupted and irreconcilable struggle must be waged against the revisionist and reformist forces which have become active all over the world, and against Soviet revisionism, in particular.\n\nFrom this rostrum, the Portuguese Communist Party (Reconstructed) voices its unreserved readiness to take concrete steps, together with the sister parties, to find advanced forms for the unity of the Marxist-Leninist parties.\n\nYou are holding aloft the banner of socialism, which is the hope for the millions of proletarians. You must be confident that the resolve of all the Portuguese communists to build up militant bonds linking us with the glorious Party of Labor is on your side.\n\nCOMMUNIST PARTY OF SPAIN (M-L)\n\nGreeting the Congress, the leader of the delegation of the Communist Party of Spain (Marxist-Leninist), Raul Marco, member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, said:\n\nWe shall never forget your 7th Congress, which played such an important role in exposing the traitor Chinese revisionism and the opportunists who disguised themselves behind the so-called Mao Zedong Thought and the vulgar \"three worlds\" theory. Only five years have elapsed since that historic Congress. Thanks to the correctness of the stand of the PLA, headed by Comrade Enver, as well as thanks to the struggle of the parties which stand in these positions, Chinese revisionism, Maoism on the international plane has remained only a bitter memory and this is due to the damage it caused to the revolution in the world and the Marxist-Leninist movement.\n\nHe said further on that there exists the threat of a world inter-imperialist war with two main centers -- U.S. imperialism and Russian imperialism. But we communists are not pessimistic. We mobilize ourselves and fight actively for peace, to avoid a new world holocaust. This holocaust can be averted only through active struggle conducted by the peoples of the world with all their means.\n\nAgainst those who preach demoralizing theories to counter the war, against the sham defenders of peace and the homeland in an abstract way, we launch the slogan: let us prepare the revolution. The land we are living in will become our real homeland only after we have done away with imperialism and reaction. Regardless of the demagogy they resort to, all the revisionists are lackeys of the local bourgeoisie, either of one or of the other superpower when they cannot be the lackeys of both of them at the same time; they are counter-revolutionaries and anti-communists and they, all together, are savage enemies of our socialist Albania. We are optimistic for we are revolutionaries, but we do not sleep on laurels. That is why we think that the moment will come when we Marxist-Leninists of the world have to strengthen our ideological, political and practical unity, and take measures in this direction, because as Comrade Enver Hoxha says: \"The present circumstances in the world, which we must submit to a profound analysis on a satisfactory level, call for meetings and consultations between us.... Our Party thinks that the times we are living through are not for endless and sterile academic discussions, they call for courageous militant and revolutionary actions full of self-denial and sacrifices.\" In conclusion, Raul Marco said: Comrades, once more we publicly express our full support for the Party of Labor of Albania and socialist Albania.\n\nPLA GREETS THE FRATERNAL DELEGATIONS\n\nOn the evening of November 7, the Central Committee of the PLA gave a reception at the Palace of Brigades on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Party and the successful conclusion of the 8th Congress. The guests included members of the Central Committee of the PLA, delegates to the 8th Congress, and the delegations of the fraternal parties and organizations which came to the 8th Congress. The reception was greeted on behalf of the Central Committee of the PLA by Adil Carcani, member of the Political Bureau. Below we publish excerpts of his speech which have been taken from the Albanian Telegraphic Agency News Bulletin, November 8, 1981.\n\nThe Albanian communists, the working class and the entire people have lived these days with the proceedings of the Congress of the Party. The heart of the communists and of the whole people during these days has been one with the Party. This is a wonderful and steel unity round our heroic Party with Comrade Enver Hoxha at the head, which has been tested in these 40 years of great and successive battles and victories against the numerous and savage enemies, internal and external, for the great cause of freedom and socialism, and this is the surest guarantee of all the victories scored in our country.\n\nThe 8th Congress of the PLA, Adil Carcani said further, was a vivid testimony to the monolithic unity of our Party and at the same time, a brilliant expression of the proletarian internationalism, of the friendship and communist unity that unite the PLA with the other Marxist-Leninist parties. Your presence and greetings at the Congress, dear comrades, representatives of the sister parties, are a great support and inspiration for our Party and people.\n\nWe know that despite the slanders by the enemies, we have never been and will not be alone in our just struggle, because we have loyal comrades and innumerable friends far and wide the world over, because the cause we are fighting for is the cause of all the revolutionary Marxist-Leninists, is the cause of the proletariat and of all the freedom-loving and progressive peoples of the world.\n\nThe PLA, during the glorious National Liberation War and the epoch of the construction of socialism as well, has never separated its struggle from the struggle of the sister parties and other peoples. It has always considered itself as a detachment of the international Marxist-Leninist movement and the revolution of the Albanian people as a component part of the world proletarian revolution.\n\nThe revolution is today more actual than ever. The all-round crisis itself, which is gnawing at the imperialist-revisionist system, is accelerating this process.\n\nThe imperialists and modern revisionists for whole decades have resorted to all means to subdue Marxism-Leninism and to liquidate the genuine communist parties, loyal to the immortal and triumphant doctrine of the proletariat. But Marxism-Leninism was not and will never be subdued either by the force of the bourgeoisie or by the demagogy and betrayal of revisionism.\n\nCertainly in the future too the Marxist-Leninist parties, defending and unfolding with courage and revolutionary partisanship the banner of Marxism-Leninism, will successfully continue the resolute and uncompromising struggle against all the trends of modern revisionism and particularly against Soviet-led revisionism. Great battles lie in store for them, but also great and sure victories await them. Without struggle and sacrifices there is no liberation, there are no victories of the revolution.\n\nThe unity of the Marxist-Leninist movement as a whole, which has a colossal importance for our revolutionary movement and struggle, is continuously tempered in the process of our common struggle. The Party of Labor of Albania in the future, too, will do its utmost within its possibilities to continuously extend the close fraternal cooperation with the sister parties, to further consolidate together the Marxist-Leninist unity of our movement.\n\nThanking you once again on behalf of our Party and people, on behalf of the Central Committee with Comrade Enver Hoxha at the head, for the honor you made us and for the very useful support you displayed with your participation at the 8th Congress of our Party, we ask you, dear comrades of the sister parties, that when you return to your countries, to assure your parties that the PLA, the Albanian communists and the entire people, will carry always forward the cause of socialism in Albania under the triumphant banner of Marxism-Leninism, will hurl themselves into battles for the realization of all the major tasks that the 8th Congress of the Party laid, will successfully realize the 7th Five-Year Plan and at the same time will accomplish with honor and determination their internationalist duty in every situation.\n\n[Back to Top]\n\nThe working people of Tirana celebrate the 8th Congress\n\n[Photos: Left: Comrade Enver Hoxha greets the mass rally in Scanderbeg Square in Tirana on November 8. Right: Over 120,000 working people of Tirana took part in a festive rally held in Scanderbeg Square on November 8 to celebrate the 8th Congress and the 40th anniversary of the PLA.]\n\nOn November 8, a grand rally was organized in Scanderbeg Square in Tirana, the capital of Albania, to celebrate the successful conclusion of the 8th Congress and the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Party of Labor of Albania. More than 120, 000 working people of the capital attended this rally. With songs and dances, cheers and slogans, they expressed their profound love for the Party of Labor of Albania.\n\nProlonged ovations burst out when Comrade Enver Hoxha and other comrades of the leadership of the PLA came amidst the people. The rally also greeted the representatives of the fraternal delegations who attended the 8th Congress.\n\nAfter the speech by a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the PLA, the rally was greeted by three representatives of the fraternal delegations who spoke on behalf of the Marxist-Leninist parties of Europe, the Americas, and Asia, Oceania and Africa. Below we publish excerpts from these speeches which have been taken from the bulletin of the Albanian Telegraphic Agency, November 8, 1981.\n\nRaul Marco, member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain (M-L), greeted the rally on behalf of the delegations of the Marxist-Leninist parties of Europe. He said:\n\nWe, the communists of France, Denmark, Great Britain, Portugal, Germany, Sweden and Spain, want to express our complete support for the decisions endorsed by the 8th Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania. These decisions open a still brighter future for our beloved Albania.\n\nYour Party emerged in struggle and came out victorious through great sacrifices. These have been 40 years of struggle and 40 years of victories.\n\nWhen we notice your victories, he said further on, we have what to say of the Albanian miracle. We state that what you have achieved has been possible thanks to the great and continuous efforts of the women and men of Albania and, above all, thanks to the fact that you have a Party, which at every moment has implemented Marxism- Leninism in a creative way. This is the real miracle of Albania.\n\nI assure you that the Marxist-Leninist parties of Europe, together with the working class of our countries, will always be side by side with you.\n\nGreeting the rally in the name of the delegations of the Marxist-Leninists of the Americas, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Colombia (M-L) said:\n\nCelebrating its 40th anniversary the Party of Labor of Albania presents itself before its people and the whole world chin up and chest out, raising high the banners of triumphant socialism.\n\nIn the 8th Congress of the PLA we saw the great vitality of socialism, the unbreakable unity of the Albanian people round the Party and the steel unity of the Party with the outstanding Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Enver Hoxha. For our parties, this reality is a brilliant example and a powerful stimulus for the struggle we are waging in our countries.\n\nOn behalf of the Marxist-Leninist parties of America we once again express on this marked day our unreserved solidarity with socialist Albania, with the glorious Party of Labor of Albania and with its unbent people, who, undoubtedly, will score fresh, ever greater victories. The unity between the PLA and the Marxist-Leninist parties of America, just as the unity of Marxist-Leninist parties of the world will become stronger in the joint struggle against all the enemies and reactionaries and against the revisionists of all hues.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the delegations from Asia, Oceania and Africa, Jack Lock, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of New Zealand, said:\n\nI want to greet the 8th Congress of the PLA, led by its very beloved leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha, as well as all the Albanian people. We congratulate you on this 40th anniversary of victories of socialism, as well as on these 37 years of the construction of a new, free society.\n\nCompared with our countries, Albania has been raised to very great heights. Our peoples suffer from exploitation. In our countries there is unemployment, inflation, growing price rise, at a time when the living standard falls. In some of our countries oppression is very savage.\n\nBut in all our countries, the struggle of the working class is intensifying. Demonstrations against nuclear stations in Japan, the demonstrations against the visits of racist sports teams to New Zealand, as well as many other strikes and clashes are to be found everywhere. In all our countries exist the Marxist- Leninist parties that fight for socialism.\n\nMay our Marxist-Leninist parties live together in fraternal unity, he said in conclusion.\n\n[Back to Top]\n\nComrade Enver Hoxha's Closing Speech to the 8th Congress\n\nThe following text of the closing speech delivered by Comrade Enver Hoxha to the 8th Congress on November 7, 1981 is taken from theAlbanian Telegraphic Agency News Bulletin.\n\nIn his closing speech at the 8th Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania, Comrade Enver Hoxha said:\n\nAllow me on behalf of the comrades whom you elected to the Central Committee, on behalf of the members of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat, to thank you for the trust you have placed in us and the great honor you have done to us by electing us to the supreme forums of the Party. We assure the Party and the whole people that we will put all our forces in the service of the cause of socialism, the freedom and independence of the Homeland, for which our heroic Party and people have fought and continue to fight with self-abnegation.\n\nThe historic tasks that lie ahead of us, the work awaiting us will not be easy.\n\nBut we are fully confident that we shall carry them out successfully. A guarantee for this are the correct line of the Party, the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, the 40-year experience of our Party. A guarantee for this are the militant spirit, the resolute struggle and the creative work of the communists and our people for the socialist construction of the country and the defense of the gains of the revolution.\n\nThe successful conclusion of the proceedings of this Congress has greatly rejoiced our Party and people, our friends and well-wishers. Its proceedings were characterized by revolutionary maturity, loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, the determination to carry our socialist society forward, to make the life of our people happy and sure.\n\nThe Congress is a fresh manifestation of the monolithic unity of the Party, of the unanimous determination to defend and carry out the line of the Party in all fields, both on internal and external questions. The unity of the Party is a guarantee for the unity of the people. Therefore, dear comrades, let us preserve and ceaselessly strengthen this steel unity.\n\nMany delegates from the various districts and sectors, workers, peasants, intellectuals, military men and others took the floor at this Congress. They differed in age and in length of service in the ranks of the Party. But all of them were united by the same communist ideal, the same love for the socialist Homeland, the same loyalty to the people. Their contributions to the discussions were another expression of the political and ideological maturity of the entire Party, of correct understanding of the situations and the importance of the tasks set by this Congress.\n\nThe Congress endorsed a great program of work in all fields, it formulated concrete tasks and clear orientations for all sectors. Their realization calls for fresh and greater mobilization, increased efforts for improving the organization and management of work, the increase of labor productivity, the application of the achievements of science and advanced experience everywhere.\n\nOur people, with the communists in the lead, will successfully accomplish these tasks, will also win the battle for the fulfillment of the 7th Five-Year Plan. They will not spare their efforts and toil, because they are convinced that only by constantly carrying the socialist construction forward will the victories of the revolution be defended and strengthened, will the present and the future be guaranteed.\n\nComrades,\n\nDelegations of the fraternal Marxist- Leninist parties from all continents have honored our 8th Congress with their participation. Allow me on your behalf and on behalf of the entire Party tothank them from our heart for the warm messages they brought from their parties and the fraternal greetings they addressed to this Congress.\n\nTheir internationalist solidarity is a valuable support for our efforts for the socialist construction, for the struggle our Party and people wage against imperialism and modern revisionism, against all our common enemies.\n\nOn our part we assure the fraternal Marxist-Leninist parties, all our comrades-in-arms, that the Albanian communists will jealously preserve the revolutionary friendship that exists between us and will spare no efforts so that our collaboration develops and strengthens further on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.\n\nForward, comrades, to carry out the decisions of this Congress, to fulfill the tasks of the new five-year plan, to make our socialist Albania more powerful and more prosperous!\n\nLong live the Party of Labor of Albania, the glorious leader of our people!\n\nLong live our heroic people!\n\nLong live proletarian internationalism!\n\nGlory to Marxism-Leninism!\n\n[Back to Top]\n\nComrade Enver Hoxha's Report to the 8th Congress of the PLA\n\n(Summary)\n\nBelow we publish a summary of the Report on the Activity of the Central Committee of the PLA ted by Comrade Enver Hoxha to the 8th Congress. This summary is taken from the bulletin of the Albanian Telegraphic Agency, November, 1, 1981. Subheads have been added by the The Workers' Advocate in accordance with the full text of the Report. Emphasis as in the Albanian Telegraphic Agency text.\n\nDear Comrades,\n\nThe Party and our entire people come to this Congress with great successes and notable victories. Socialist Albania has raised its economic and cultural development to a higher stage, has taken a new step forward in raising the well-being of the masses and strengthening the defense of the Homeland.\n\nThe five years which have elapsed since the 7th Congress was held are a period of heroic struggle by our working masses on all fronts to carry the socialist construction even further forward, to make our new life even richer and more prosperous. Under the leadership of the Party and with unshakeable confidence in its correct line, the working class, the cooperativist peasantry, the youth and the intelligentsia unsparingly poured out all their physical and mental energies to cope with and successfully overcome the difficulties of socialist growth, as well as those which the foreign enemies created for us.\n\nOur Party comes boldly and proudly to the present Congress, as it did to the former congresses, because it has successfully accomplished the great tasks it undertook, because it has fully justified the unshakeable trust the people have in it. Our people can be satisfied with their work and efforts. This has been creative and fruitful work which brought them new joy and progress, which made them more optimistic and happier.\n\nDuring the 6th Five-Year Plan, too, the industrialization of the country went ahead nonstop. The utilization of the value of our mineral wealth and other raw materials of the country reached a higher level. With the building of new projects, such as the \"Steel of the Party\" metallurgical combine, the ferro-chrome plant, the pyro-metallurgy plant, the deep oil-processing refinery, etc., a considerable portion of these materials are now transformed and processed locally, thus creating a sound and reliable base for the development of the whole economy. This is a success of the correct line of the Party, as is the ensuring of the powerful energy base, which was further expanded with the commissioning of all the turbines of the \"Light of the Party\" hydropower station.\n\nOur agriculture has made new big strides in all directions. The orientation of the Party that it must be transformed into a socialist agriculture of modern large-scale production, relying on an ever more powerful technical base and on the latest agro-technical knowledge, has been proved in practice to be a correct and fully realizable orientation. The increase of agricultural and livestock products from year to year, the ever better fulfillment of the needs of the population and industry for these products, fully confirm this.\n\nMarked progress has been made in the field of culture and education. The socialist content, national physiognomy and popular spirit of our culture have been further developed and deepened. Culture and all its values are being introduced ever more deeply among the masses. A merit of our new culture is that it has withstood the various pressures and influences of bourgeois and revisionist culture, while preserving its originality and socialist features. The people's education has advanced, fully implementing the instructions of the Party to ensure the broad education of the new generation and to give the country specialists at the level which our present and future development requires.\n\nIn this grave period of crises which have engulfed the capitalist and revisionist world, where there are many political upheavals, stagnation and decline in production, falling living standards and decadence of moral values, in our country there is complete economic and political stability, our society is sound, our people are confident about the present and the future. During the past five years, a large contingent of people educated and trained by the Party and our people's state power have begun work for the first time, adding to and further strengthening the great army of working people of town and countryside. This fact becomes even more significant if we bear in mind that in the world today, not only is work not ensured for the younger generation, but even people of the older generation are left unemployed.\n\nOur people's state power has been further strengthened and democratized. The participation of the masses in governing the country has become more active and been raised to a higher level. Our socialist democracy has been extended further and better conditions have been created to ensure that the people enjoy the rights guaranteed them as fully as possible, and perform their duties to society better.\n\nThe internal situation has never been stronger than it is today. The compactness and unity of the people, the alliance of the working class with the cooperativist peasantry, the collaboration and solidarity among the different strata of our society, have been strengthened and consolidated further. The links of the Party with the people have been steeled and their mutual confidence has been tempered further.\n\nA brilliant expression of this great unity is that determination, that drive and heroism with which our people fight to carry out the tasks set by the Party, to overcome the various difficulties that have emerged in our road, to successfully cope with the imperialist-revisionist blockade and encirclement.\n\nThanks to the correct line and special care of the Party, socialist Albania today has a reliable and impregnable defense. Our people and the army always maintain high vigilance and stand fearless and ready to defend the freedom and independence of the Homeland and the victories of socialism.\n\nOur country is honored and respected by the progressive and peace-loving peoples and states everywhere in the world. Its international position is strong. Its friends and well-wishers are increasing and multiplying day by day. Its resolute and principled struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism has enhanced the sympathy and love of the Marxist-Leninists, revolutionaries, and honest democratic-minded people for the Party of Labor and the People's Socialist Republic of Albania.\n\nOur Party and people successfully withstood the grave test to which they were put by the sudden and brutal breaking off of economic relations with our country on the part of China. The Chinese revisionists thought that through their hostile activity they would disorganize our economy and stop its development for a long time, that they would force Albania to make political and ideological concessions, to hold out its hand to foreigners and beg for support and aid from abroad.\n\nHowever, they, and international reaction after them, which hoped that Albania would be forced to change course, failed completely. With great political maturity and a lofty patriotic spirit, with fresh mobilization of their energies and unshaken confidence in the triumph of their struggle, our people overcame the difficulties created.\n\nOur Party comes to its 8th Congress tempered in new battles and richer in experience. It comes as a great army, educated with the proletarian Marxist-Leninist ideology, with strong internal unity and closely linked with the people, with increased organizing, mobilizing and leading capabilities, ever ready to undertake new and greater tasks and to carry them out with success as always.\n\nThe work of this Congress coincides with a glorious anniversary, the anniversary of the founding of our heroic Party of Labor. Forty years ago our people entrusted their destiny, the life and the future of the Homeland to the Albanian communists. Our Party justified their trust with its glorious work, with the triumph of the revolution and the creation of the new socialist Albania. Inspired by the trust of the people and conscious of its historic responsibility and the lofty mission it had undertaken, it guided the Albanian people with penetrating mind and sure touch from one battle to another, from one victory to another.\n\nThe magnificent achievements attained in the years of our free life under the leadership of the Party have shown that there is no force which can seriously disturb socialism in Albania and the freedom and independence of our Homeland, or dim the brilliance of our future. The consistent adherence to the Marxist-Leninist principle of self-reliance, the policy of the creation of a modern industry based on the country's raw materials and an agriculture which with its products guarantees the food supplies for the people, the training of sufficient technical and scientific cadres capable of working and leading in all sectors, have been proved indispensable to success in all directions. This wise and farsighted policy of the Party has created that sound foundation on which our ceaseless economic and cultural development is based and which guarantees our socialist course.\n\nThe achievement of economic independence along with political independence, the ensuring of the country's defense by the people themselves, the education and arming of the working masses with the Marxist- Leninist ideology, are the strong and unshakeable pillars on which our socialist fortress stands, the fundamental features which characterize a truly socialist state. Taken as a whole, these achievements constitute the historical experience of socialism in Albania. The experience of Albania shows that even a small country, with a backward material-technical base, can achieve a very rapid and all-round economic and cultural development, can ensure its independence and withstand the attacks of world capitalism and imperialism when it is led by a truly Marxist-Leninist party, when it is determined to fight to the end for its ideals, and has faith in its ability to achieve them.\n\nIn the future, too, the Party of Labor of Albania will march determined and unwavering on the brilliant road on which it has proceeded during the forty years of its existence. Linked like flesh to bone with its people, at the head of them and together with them, it will fight with devotion, sparing no sacrifice in order to ensure new progress and victories for our people and our socialist Homeland.\n\nI\n\nThe Development of the Economy and the Tasks of the Party\n\nComrades,\n\nOur socialist economy enters the new five-year period of its development with stability, dynamic and with great possibilities to develop and extend social production further and raise its efficiency in all directions.\n\nThe great achievements of historic significance already made in all fields, as well as the rich experience gained in the work and struggle of the Party and people for the construction and defense of socialism, constitute a powerful political, economic and social basis from which to advance confidently and boldly.\n\nOn the basis of the general line and the economic policy of the Party for the construction of socialism, the Central Committee, after all-sided work and study and a broad popular consultation, prepared the Draft- directives for the 7th Five-Year Plan of the development of the economy and culture for the period 1981-1985, which it presents to the Congress for examination and endorsement. The fundamental task of this five-year plan is:\"The general development of the economy, relying completely on our own forces, on the basis of deepening the socialist industrialization of the country, the strengthening and intensification of agriculture, raising the efficiency of the economy, the development of the technical scientific revolution and perfecting the socialist relations of production, in order to guarantee and gradually raise the material well-being and the cultural level of the masses of the working people and to further strengthen the socialist order and the defense capacity of the Homeland.\"\n\nThe main directions and objectives of the development of the economy and culture during the 7th Five- Year Plan, which is distinguished by a number of special characteristics, are synthesized in this task.\n\nThis is the first five-year plan which will be carried out relying entirely on our own forces and possibilities.Today Albania is the only country in the world which is developing and advancing on the socialist road without any kind of aid or credit from abroad. This is a great but glorious test for our people and Party, and the victory is certain, because, by proceeding on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, we prepared ourselves long ago for this decisive step.\n\nThe objectives and tasks of the new five-year plan are greater than in any other plan, but they are scientifically based and fully achievable. For the five years 1981-1985, the volume of social production and investments will be larger than the volume realized over the first four five-year plans taken together, while the volume of exports will be even larger. In 1985, as against 1980, social production is envisaged to increase 34- 36%, at an average annual rate of 6.4%. The funds for investment and construction will be used to build about 750 important projects for the development of the economy and culture.\n\nWith the possibilities created by the increased production and national income, in 1985, as against 1980, the fund for consumption by the people is expected to increase by 21% and the circulation of retail goods by 22-24%. Important tasks are envisaged for the development of education and culture, the health service, housing and other public services.\n\nIn setting these targets and rates, account has been taken both of the possibilities the economy has and will provide and of the needs for the development of the economy and the employment of the new active forces, for the strengthening of the defense of the country and the increase of reserves, and for the development of the social and cultural sectors, as well as for ever better fulfilling the growing demands of the population. Many of the targets of this five-year plan, especially those which have to do with the utilization of reserves of oil and minerals, the allocation of investments, etc., have also been seen to in close connection with the development of the economy in the future five-year plans, when we will be faced with even greater needs and demands.\n\nDuring the 7th Five-Year Plan some important structural improvements will be made in the field of production, the circulation of goods and consumption by the people.These improvements will involve energy resources, black metallurgy, the engineering industry, agriculture, transport, finances and mass consumer goods, etc. The improvements envisaged will lead to intensification of the economy, raise its efficiency and make it more capable of meeting the needs of the country and of coping better with the encirclement and blockade and the pressure of the economic crisis of the capitalist and revisionist world.\n\nThe development and strengthening of the material-technical base of the country, as always, will be closely linked with the improvement of various aspects of the economic relations in the city and, especially, in the countryside. Important measures have been and are being taken for the further development of the cooperativist system and the restriction of the personal plot, for the extension of specialization and cooperation, the strengthening of the organization and management of production, for a better linking of the remuneration for work with quantity and quality, savings and the fulfillment of targets of the plan. These measures will be carried still further with the aim of ceaselessly strengthening our socialist order.\n\n1. The Further Strengthening of Industry -- A Decisive Factor for the General Advance of the Country\n\nIn the 7th Five-Year Plan our industry will advance still further and develop on a broad front.About 46% of all the investments of the five-year plan will be made in this branch. The aim of the policy of the Party for the development of industry is: to consolidate the multi-branched structure of industry, giving priority, as always, to heavy industry; to maintain and further improve the positive balance of energy resources, attaching particular importance to the oil industry; to further develop the mineral extracting and processing industry, while also starting to utilize new minerals; to make tangible improvements in the structure of means of production and consumer goods; to put industry even more in the service of the intensification of agriculture; to expand the existing productive capacities through their reconstruction and modernization.\n\n2. Agricultural Production Must Be Further Intensified and the Socialist Relations in the Countryside Perfected\n\nConsistently following its agrarian policy, the Party has setnew, more important objectives for the development of agriculture and the progress of our socialist countrysideduring the 7th Five-Year Plan. The tasks which the Central Committee of the Party has set for the sector of agriculture in the new five-year plan are aimed: to increase production in order to ensure ever better supplies of all the food for the people and improve its structure; to substantially increase the raw materials for the light and food-processing industry; to gradually eliminate imports of that part of foodstuffs and agricultural raw materials which are still brought from abroad; to increase the volume of exports of processed and unprocessed agricultural products; to increase and strengthen the necessary reserves. On the basis of these objectives, as well as through other economic and social measures, the well-being of the peasantry will be raised and the distinctions between town and countryside will be further reduced.\n\nThese major problems for the development of agriculture have to do with the present and the future of the country. For all these reasons, in this five-year plan agriculture will occupy a special and more important place than hitherto.\n\nIn the context of the work that will be carried out in agriculture during this five-year plan, the Central Committee of the Party proposes to the Congress that aseries of important measures for the intensification of agricultural production, giving priority to production in the more fertile plains of the country, should be applied within a ten-year period.The first stage of this program, to be applied in the 7th Five-Year Plan, covers more than 100,000 hectares of land in the area of the coastal plains. The aim of this action is to increase agricultural and livestock production in the areas in which the work and investments yield greater and more rapid results. This will also create favorable conditions for a more rapid development of the cooperatives and for the gradual transition from the property of the group to the property of the whole people. Undertaking this action will not affect the investments and material resources necessary for the development of agriculture in the other areas of the country. On the contrary, work will continue for the further development and strengthening of all agricultural cooperatives.\n\n3. Investments and Construction Work -- An Important Basis for the Ceaseless Strengthening of the Economy\n\nThe productive potential we have built up and the growing resources of our internal accumulation enable us to undertake a program of investments and construction work of unprecedented proportions in the 9 new five-year plan,with a total volume of more than 25 billion leks, or 22-24% more than in the previous five-year plan. This is a very significant expression of the superiority and vitality of our socio-economic order, of the creative abilities and inexhaustible energies of the broad working masses and of the correctness of the principle of self-reliance.\n\nIn allocating investments, deciding their structure and the concrete projects, the future development of the various branches of the economy and culture, the strengthening of the independence and defense of the Homeland and the need to guarantee and gradually raise the well-being of the people, have been taken into account.\n\n4. Export Must Be Increased and Hard Currency Used Sparingly\n\nIn the development of our economy we have always followed the course of ceaselessly strengthening our political and economic independence, but we have never aimed and do not aim at an autarkic development, while we have always struggled against any pressure to integrate our economy into the economy of capitalist and revisionist countries.\n\nBy applying this correct Marxist-Leninist course, and increasing the volume of exports perceptibly, even though we encountered serious obstacles and difficulties,in the last years of the past five-year period our economy managed for the first time to balance all the necessary imports with exports. This balance was achieved without detriment to the rates of the development of the economy, or the standard of living of the people.This is another historic victory of our Party and people on the road of the complete construction of socialist society, a clear expression of the economic strength of our country.\n\nIn 1985 exports of goods are forecast to be 58-60% greater than in 1980, while imports will go up 56-58%. Thus, the active balance of foreign trade will be further strengthened and the fulfillment of the targets of the five-year plan as a whole will be more firmly guaranteed.\n\n5.The Level of Well-Being of the People Must Be Guaranteed and Gradually Raised\n\nIn the development of production and all other social activities the Partyhas always had the working man, the fulfillment of his material and cultural needs in the center of its attention.\n\nWith the development of industry, agriculture and the other branches of the economy during the 7th Five-Year Plan, the material well-being and the cultural level of the people will be guaranteed and raised. Despite the huge program of investments and expenditure for the development of the economy and the increase in the norm of accumulation from about 30% in the 6th Five-Year Plan to 31-33% in the 7th Five-Year Plan, the real income per capita of the population will go up 8-10%. The rate of increase in real income in the countryside will be more than double that in the town. The production of mass consumer goods will increase 33-35% and services for the people 45-47%. There will be increased supplies of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, potatoes and fruit. Improvements are envisaged in the structure of mass consumer products and the supply of durable household goods, in order to make living conditions easier and to ensure a more cultured family life.\n\n6. We Must Perfect the Management of the Economy and Raise Its Efficiency\n\nManagement and organization are one of the most important links which we must grasp firmly to ensure progress everywhere, in the economy, education, science, culture, in all the fields of social activity.\n\nIn the existing conditions, when our economy has become a large-scale complex economy, it cannot be managed and progress with outdated concepts and practices. Today, empiricism and narrow practicism cannot do the job. Management and organization must be based on profound knowledge and learning, on sound scientific principles and criteria which stem from the laws of our economic and social development.\n\nOur economy has always proceeded on a correct Marxist-Leninist course. Its stability, vitality and dynamism are clear and concrete proof of this. These fundamental features of our socialist economy will be consolidated and carried still further forward through the struggle and efforts of the working class, the cooperativist peasantry and the people's intelligentsia, under the leadership of the Party, to put into practice the objectives of the 7th Five-Year Plan which we are endorsing at this Congress.\n\nII\n\nWe Must Ceaselessly Strengthen the Party and Further Enhance the Effectiveness of Its Work\n\nOur Party of Labor, unwaveringly loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, a determined fighter against external and internal enemies and with its roots deep in the people who gave birth to it and raised it, has led the Albanian people with wisdom and foresight from victory to victory, at each stage of the revolution and the socialist construction of the country.\n\nThe Party has also accomplished with honor the great, difficult and complex tasks set by its 7th Congress. The struggle and work for the accomplishment of these tasks has further strengthened and steeled the Party, enhanced its leading role and fighting spirit, revolutionized the life and activity of the basic organizations, the forums and the members of the Party and tempered the steel unity of its ranks and its close links with the broad masses of the people.\n\n1. We Must Further Enhance and Perfect the Leading Role of the Party\n\nThe experience of our Party over 40 years proves that only a party which is based firmly on the Marxist-Leninist science can become the true leader of the working class, can achieve its hegemony and ensure the triumph of the revolution and the construction of socialist society.\n\nThe Party realizes its leading role everywhere and on every question through the basic organizations and the party members. The better the ideology and political line of the Party in general, and each of its decisions and directives in particular, are grasped and applied by every organization and member, the stronger the Party and its links with the masses become, and the more its leading role is enhanced in all the links of the socialist construction. This is a decisive condition for the fulfillment of the great tasks which face us at the present stage of the development of the country and in the concrete conditions under which we are building socialism. With the Party strong as steel, vigilant and fearless in the lead, the cause of the revolution and socialism is invincible.\n\nOur Party has always had a correct concept of its role in the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat and has played this role correctly. Therefore, it is very important to establish thorough understanding and ever better application in practice of the fact that the work of the Party is not the work of the party organs and basic organizations only, and even less, of their apparatuses. The state and economic organs, the commands and staffs of the army, the mass organizations, all the cadres and working people, whether party members or not, also carry out the work of the Party, because they are all guided by the ideology and line of the Party and carry out the laws and regulations of the state and its plans in which this line is embodied.\n\n2. The Effectiveness of the Work of the Party and the Sense of Responsibility of the Party Organs and Organizations Should Be Increased\n\nThe work of the Party is effective when the party organizations and all the party members develop the ability to act on their own initiative, develop the creative and innovative spirit widely. In this direction there are many examples and positive experience everywhere.\n\nLife progresses, our socialist society is developing ceaselessly, the conditions change. This development requires us to be creative and inventive, to find new, more flexible and varied forms of work, and to continually renew and enrich them so that they respond better to the requirements of the time.\n\n3. The Established Criteria for Increasing the Ranks of the Party Must Be Applied Correctly\n\nOur Party has always applied correct criteria for the increase of its ranks, with determination and in a revolutionary way. This has made the Party stronger and healthier and increased the effectiveness of its work.\n\nThe Party comes to this Congress with its ranks increased with communists who are resolute fighters for the cause of the people, the revolution and communism, proletarians in thought and action. Now 122,600 communists, of whom nearly 38% are workers, 29.4% cooperativists and 32.6% office workers are militating in the ranks of the Party. Women make up 30% of the total, or 2.5% more than at the previous Congress. Members of the Party make up 4.5% of the population; 24,363 candidates for membership, 42.40% of them workers, 40.43% cooperativists and 17.17% office workers, have been admitted to the Party in the years following the 7th Congress. Of these, 40.70% are women comrades.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of those admitted to the Party, either as full members or candidates, come from the sphere of production, especially from its main fronts. They are among the best workers, the most developed politically and ideologically, those with lofty moral qualities and virtues and a high educational level, vanguard fighters and active participants in the construction of socialism.\n\n4. Improve the Work of the Party with the Cadres\n\n5. Further Strengthen the Political System of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat\n\nFollowing the 7th Congress, with the adoption of the new Constitution and the other codes and laws which stem from it, the management, organization and activity of the entire system of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the Party itself, the state, the armed forces, the mass organizations, etc., have been further strengthened.\n\nIt is known that the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat includes a whole system of organs and organisms with various functions, competences and responsibilities, built on the basis of democratic centralism and which function under the leadership of the Party. The problem presents itself that this entire system has to be strengthened continuously and operate in a synchronized way, with each part of the system performing its own functions with precision, so that all of them in unison realize the objective and program of the Party.\n\nIn the period between the two congresses, the Central Committee of the Party and the Defense Council have taken important measures to further strengthen the defense capacity of the Homeland. The Party and the state, the military cadres, both active and reserve, have carried out great work in the army and fought successfully to eliminate the consequences of the hostile activity of Beqir Balluku and company. As a result of this, the organization, training, education and fighting readiness of our armed forces have been raised to a higher level.\n\nThe Party has never based the defense of the Homeland on external aid or the various international factors, but has relied mainly on the internal factor, on the strength, patriotism and bravery of our own people, as well as on the all-round preparation and permanent fighting readiness of the whole country for defense.\n\nThe defense of the Homeland is strengthened and becomes impregnable when the tasks in the political, ideological, economic and military fields are understood and carried out closely and inseparably linked with one another. Such an understanding and performance of the tasks will further consolidate our internal front in all directions, will make it even more capable of coping successfully with any situation, a steel wall against which any aggressor who dares to raise a hand against the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, will break his head.\n\nIII\n\nThe Tasks of the Party for the Communist Education of the Working People\n\nThe all-round education of the new man has been and remains a fundamental question in the activity of the Party in order to carry the construction of socialist society consistently forward. This education has been carried out on a broad front, closely linked with the task of each stage of development, with the problems which life has raised, and the concrete situations. This has always ensured the active character, the great mobilizing and transforming force of the educational work of the Party and its levers.\n\nThe conditions in which we are working and fighting for the construction and defense of socialism, as well as the tasks which we are putting forward in this Congress for the socio-economic development of the country, require that the educational work of the Party be raised to a higher level and concentrated better on certain current and future main problems, in order to create deep Marxist-Leninist convictions among the people, to raise their professional skills, to equip them with broad culture and pure moral virtues.\n\n1. The Communist Education of the Working People -- The Basis of Our Successes\n\nOur Party has always done a great deal of work for the Marxist-Leninist education of the communists and the masses. The task now is that all this work should be done at a higher, more qualified level, with the aim that the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the teachings of our Party should be mastered as well and as thoroughly as possible. The main thing is that our people should be properly armed ideologically with the Marxist world outlook and methodology, should be properly formed from the theoretical viewpoint, so that they stand and act consciously at all times and in any circumstances, as consistent revolutionaries, as determined fighters for the cause of socialism and communism, and not be taught only some Marxist theses and conclusions.\n\nOur Party and people have to advance continuously, to solve new problems. The theoretical working out and the practical solution of these problems require that creative thinking should be developed continuously, relying on the basic Marxist principles and methodology, as well as on the summing up of the experience gained.\n\n2. Socialism Needs People with Broad Culture and Scientific Knowledge\n\nIn our country a true revolution has taken place in the cultural and professional level of the working masses. Nevertheless, the raising of the educational, cultural and technical-vocational level of the working people as an inseparable part of the communist education, remains one of the important directions of the activity of the Party and the state.\n\nThe intensive development of the economy and culture, the ever more extensive introduction of advanced equipment and technology, the targets set for higher productivity and quality, greater profitability and efficiency of production, the prospects of the whole development of the country in the future, demand the further raising of the educational and cultural level, the mastering of science and technology by our people.\n\nThe main center for the assimilation of culture, knowledge, and science is our new school. The great action for the further revolutionization of our socialist school, which has been going on during the recent 15 years, is being carried out with success.\n\nGreat successes have been achieved in assuring mass participation in all parts of our school system. In general, the overwhelming majority of the urgent needs for the quantitative development of education can be considered solved, or well on the way to their final solution. We now have an education system capable of coping with the present and future requirements in all fields.\n\nNow the time has come for all the forces of our education and teaching front to concentrate more seriously and in a more qualified way on raising the quality of the work of the school, without neglecting constant care to further increase the mass participation in education in general, and especially in certain of its links.\n\nOur country has been transformed into a great school in which everybody learns and works, beautifies the Homeland and makes it prosper. This has brought the people into an ever more active relationship with culture. Our people take part actively in the creation of the values of material and spiritual culture and in their continuous use. Herein lies one of the superiorities of our socialist system over the capitalist system.\n\nOur socialist life gives our culture, literature and arts more vigor, more dynamism and freshness, enriching them in content and form. The connection with the active life is the only means, the only way to disclose and affirm the lofty moral and political virtues and qualities, the successes and creative activity of people who work. Only in this way are the cultural values turned into a source to inspire and mobilize the masses to carry out the tasks in the fields of the construction and defense of the country, creating an atmosphere of revolutionary enthusiasm to overcome difficulties and achieve new victories.\n\nAn important task of all our creative artists in literature, cinematography, figurative arts, music, etc., is to take up the major problems of our days, the processes of the development and the new phenomena of our life and reflect them extensively in their works.\n\nThe development and progress of culture means the development and progress of the nation. There is a close dialectical interconnection between them. Engels has said that history shows that every new step forward on the road of culture has been a step towards freedom. It is important that this is understood profoundly by the organs of the Party and the state power at the base and by all the working people of the front of culture. The greater their understanding of the importance of cultural work, the more they will link themselves with the problems of this activity.\n\nOur new science also has made a special contribution to the great successes which our people have achieved in the socialist construction of the country.\n\nBut the stage reached in the development of the country and the great tasks which we have ahead of us make the development of science, its proper evaluation and the application of its achievements in production an urgent need. This need becomes even more imperative in the present conditions of the development of our country with our own forces alone, when the economy and all sectors of social activity have set out on the course of intensification and when work of high quality, productivity and efficiency is required everywhere.\n\nThe main objective of all the scientific study work is to give the 7th Five-Year Plan the necessary support to ensure its complete fulfillment. Along with this, an important task and objective of our science is to begin immediately to carry out studies in regard to the next five-year plan. To be science, to really play its role and perform its function, science must precede production, must indicate in advance the future course of development of economy and culture. Only on this basis can it aid both planning and production.\n\nIV\n\nThe International Situation and the Foreign Policy of the PSR of Albania\n\nThe Party of Labor of Albania has always followed the development of international situations and the events which occur in the world with attention. It has, analyzed them in an objective and realistic manner, based as always, on the Marxist-Leninist principles, and has drawn the respective conclusions. In all this work the Party has proceeded from the fact that the processes going on in the world today exert their influence, to this or that extent, on our country, too. We follow and analyze the international situations with particular interest, so that we are never taken by surprise, to ensure that we are always prepared to face up successfully to any danger which might come from abroad, and to build socialism with success. On the other hand, this also constitutes a condition for us to properly and effectively perform our internationalist duty in support of the peoples' struggle for freedom and national independence, democracy and social progress, and to contribute to the strengthening of international peace and security.\n\nViewed as a whole, the present international situation is disturbed, complicated and very tense. Major political and social forces confront one another: on the one side, imperialism, capitalism and reaction, the bearers of oppression, exploitation and war, and on the other side, the peoples, the revolutionaries and the democrats, who are struggling for national and social liberation and the emancipation of mankind. This large-scale, profound and all-round confrontation, which is a reflection of stern class clashes and has included all the continents without exception, has further exacerbated all the contradictions and the grave crisis which has swept the capitalist world today. Everything indicates that the present situation in the world could give rise to general and local wars, just as it may give rise to liberation wars and revolution. The development of events will show whether imperialism will be able to lead the world to a new catastrophe or whether the peoples will prevent the war and save mankind.\n\nThe imperialist-revisionist policy of war, oppression and exploitation has run into the great resistance of the proletariat and the peoples of the world.
