        "text": "Whether you are a politician, a passionate traveler, or just a map freak (throughout the pandemic, this is relevant to many of us), you may want to know the names of counties and their capitals. But what about their pronunciation? Even the native speakers of English often have difficulties reading aloud the names of foreign countries and cities. And yes, some of them are really challenging to pronounce. But first things first.\n\nThe UN recognizes 195 independent states, while only 193 of them are members of the organization. But what is the overall number of countries in the world? The exact number may vary depending on the evaluation methodology, thus you may find different data on the subject. In fact, there are much more nations on our planet. Some of them do not constitute countries, others are not fully recognized by other nations or countries, yet others are self-governing overseas territories (dependencies) of the big well-known countries.\n\nWe know from history that countries may be born and die, kingdoms, realms, and empires rise and fall, borders move and change. Their names may transform and alter over time as well.\n\nBut here we are not going to scrutinize political status, forms of government, or the geographical location of countries. Our goal is to get familiarized with the names of countries, as well as the names of their capitals and their English pronunciation. And as mentioned above, this list may not represent all countries of the world.\n\nHere you can also sort countries and capitals alphabetically or check your knowledge: hide countries or capitals and make an attempt to recall their names. Hide both and try to spell them by listening to the audio pronunciation.\n\nDo not use the Table Sorting along with the Continuous Play feature, because in this case, you won't be able to track the play pointer.\n\nTo reset the table sorting reload the page. Country Capital\n\nContinuous play\n\n1The UN established status of Jerusalem as a territory under international administration (UNGA Resolution No. 194 of 11 December 1948). Israel declared Jerusalem its capital in 1949 shortly after the end of the War of Independence. In 1967, after the Six-Day War, Israel annexed East Jerusalem and merged it with its Western part into a single municipality. This connection is not recognized by the United Nations (UN Security Council Resolution 478). The vast majority of foreign embassies are located outside Jerusalem, chiefly in Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan, and Herzlia."
