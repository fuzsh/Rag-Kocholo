        "text": "Albania is among the countries of the region with the longest and deepest track record of cooperation with communist China, before the two countries fell out at the beginning of the 1970s. Dozens of past joint projects mean that there are various supporters of a political renaissance between the two states who still regularly refer to this historical period of close relations. Indeed, this attitude features in cultural and tourism ties, too. For older people, the principled stand of reclusive Albania and orthodox communist China can still bring forth waves of political nostalgia.\n\nWhen it emerged dramatically, impoverished from communism, Albania sought to re-join the world, looking in all directions for friends, partners, and investors. China was among the likely candidates for renewed cooperation, and during the 2000s Beijing showed some interest, mostly in trade and infrastructure. Yet, Albania’s foreign policy and other positions was strongly framed by the promise of democratic and market transition, gradual reintegration into Western political space, and US support and commitment. NATO accession further solidified the country’s Western anchoring, just as Beijing began to unleash a wave of activism in the Western Balkans. The mid-2010s witnessed a series of Chinese investments in important sectors in Albania, implying sustained interest and future investments.\n\nFirstly, the Chinese firm Geo-Jade Petroleum acquired the concession for the major oil extraction field in the country, seemingly making a breakthrough investment. A year later, the company China Everbright secured the Tirana Airport concession, suggesting an emerging trend of gradual economic Chinese penetration of the Albanian economy. Chinese firms then made various attempts to gain a foothold in Albanian ports through the creation of economic and investment zones. Trade has grown such that China is now Albania’s third largest export partner. Chinese companies have sought to win road infrastructure projects and more and more local firms have established links with Chinese counterparts through trade fairs. Huawei made a concerted effort to embed itself, at one time securing the support of Prime Minister Edi Rama. Cultural cooperation also picked up as the Chinese embassy ‘went granular’, organising large-scale events and providing material help to cultural institutions. Furthermore, China provided significant official aid on various occasions, most notably after a series of devastating earthquakes. Chinese cooperation with the Red Cross ensured public exposure as did the delivery of covid-19 testing kits. Chinese interaction with Albanian media outlets has also increased during the last few years, leading to an uptick in the presence of China-related content.\n\nStill, this activism has not generated a sustained wave of economic engagement. At the end of 2020, Tirana Airport’s ownership was transferred to an Albanian company and there have been no announcements of significant new Chinese investments in the country. A regionally re-engaged US and a push to begin EU accession negotiations has further reinforced Albania’s sense of geopolitical belonging. The frustration at the persistent postponement of EU accession talks has not transformed into a greater readiness among the Albanian population or political class to explore non-Western political and economic options. Furthermore, Tirana is sensitive to the ongoing shifts in China-West relations. It doesn’t want to undermine good relations with Western powers and therefore remains unlikely to make any dramatic shifts in approach, especially if the EU enlargement process regains momentum. At the same time, prolonged regional geopolitical ambivalence and delayed EU membership will undoubtedly impact on Albanian perceptions and calculations. China has been increasing its diplomatic presence in the country, even if largely to improve its capacity vis-à-vis Kosovo. Moreover, China’s “16 plus 1” engagement and investment framework is gradually focusing again on the Western Balkans and new project ideas could come Tirana’s way. Additionally, Beijing has increased its society-based diplomatic presence in the country, ranging from culture to academic and education. We should also remember that China’s interest in maritime infrastructure predates the Belt and Road Initiative and is unlikely to end. Developments further up the Adriatic Sea are a useful reminder of where China’s interests lie.\n\nEconomy & business\n\nInvestment\n\nThe major Chinese investments in Albania include: Hong Kong-based company China Everbright and Friedmann Pacific Asset Management’s acquisition of the concession rights of Tirana International Airport, which is now under Chinese management until 2025 with a possible two-year extension. China’s Shanghai-based Geo-Jade Petroleum also acquired the Canadian company Bankers Petroleum in 2016 to the tune of nearly half a billion US dollars, which gives the Chinese firm full rights to develop Albania’s Patos-Marinza oilfield, the largest onshore oilfield in Europe. Reuters reported in late 2019 that “After investments of more than $2.5 billion at its Patos-Marinza oilfield, Bankers now produces 95% of Albania’s crude oil.”\n\nNot everything has gone smoothly. In 2016, the Chinese construction company withdrew from the Arber Road project, which was valued at more than $200 million. It was then taken over by an Albanian firm, the Gjoka Construction Company, and the government via a joint financial arrangement agreed between the private company and the state.\n\nChinese investment in the Balkans focuses mostly on fossil fuel-linked industries, including energy, refinement transport, and mining. There is only one investment in telecoms – by Huawei – and one in metal processing (steel production) out of 21 greenfield or mergers and acquisitions from Chinese companies in the Balkans.\n\nDiscussions originally took place with Chinese banks and investors on building two transport corridors – the Blue Corridor and Arber Road. However, in the end the Albanian government chose to work with other partners.\n\nTrade\n\nBilateral trade between China and Albania has grown steadily since the start of the global financial crisis in 2008. Since 2008, it has risen from a total value of $284 million to $635 million in 2016. More recently, Albanian exports to China have increased. In 2019, they totalled 6.2 billion Albanian lek (€50.9 million), with annual growth of only 1%. However, this a better figure than one-year prior when Albania’s exports to China declined by 26%. Bilateral trade has increased threefold in less than one decade, due to accelerated trade practices being put in place. More trade has meant that more and more Chinese commodities are present in the Albanian market.\n\nIn 2016, China was Albania’s third largest economic partner. Imports from China also continued to grow, reaching 8.8% of total imports in 2016, up from 6.4% in 2012. Albanian exports to China increased by 29.7% from 2012 to 2016, supported by the increase in exports of minerals and oil, and of construction materials and metals\n\nIn 2017, Albania imported $312 million worth of goods from China. According to Obsevatory of Economic Complexity, China’s exports to Albania in 2017 were as follows: Machines $104 million; textiles $49.4 million; mineral products $37.9 million; metals $29.3 million; miscellaneous $24.1 million; plastic and rubber $22.1 million; stone and glass $17.5 million; chemical products $15.7 million; footwear and headwear $15.5 million; transport $8 million; instruments $7.19 million; paper goods $5.37 million; animal hides $4.89 million; vegetable products $2.73 million; foodstuffs $2.66 million; wood products $2.37 million; animal products $365,000; animal and vegetal by-products $333,000; and precious metals $129,000.\n\nAlbania exported $177 million worth of goods to China in 2017. Products such as Albanian wine are proving popular, with China expected to become its largest market. The value of mineral products exported to China was $162 million. Other export goods include: textiles $8.55 million; metals $4.15 million; footwear and headwear $1.86 million; and foodstuffs $151,000.\n\nThe total trade value between Albania and China neared $600 million in 2018. Official data show that imports from China in 2019 increased by 11%, while China was Albania’s third main trade partners after Italy and Greece.\n\nSoon, China will be a new market for Albanian animal products. Albania and China have signed a memorandum regarding their collaboration about the import and export of food products and their safety.\n\nFigures show that by 31 March 2020 China was Albania’s third largest trading partner. Despite the impact of covid-19, bilateral trade increased 36% in the first half of 2020. There has been diversification in the categories of products exported to China, making the trade structure more balanced.\n\nLoans from Chinese Banks and Entities\n\nChina has provided $126 million to Albanian government under a bilateral financial agreement as a loan to be repaid over 12 years with a 3.5% interest rate.\n\nMain Local Companies / Businesspeople with Economic Ties to China\n\nChinese investments in Albania have taken place through indirect acquisition of shares of Albanian companies’ property of non-Albanian owners:\n\nIn May 2014, a subsidiary of Ekin Maden Ticaret ve Sanayi A.Ş. – a Turkish company – sold a 50% stake in Beralb Ltd for $65 million to Jiangxi Copper Company ltd. of China23;\n\nIn September 2016, the Chinese-owned Geo-Jade Petroleum acquired management rights for the largest oil field (operated by Bankers Ltd – a Canadian company) in Albania for $575 million;\n\nIn October 2016, China Everbright Limited acquired 100% of the shares of the Tirana International Airport for 30 years from its German owner. (Source: China and Western Balkans – Ardian Hackaj).\n\nThe company “Euroasia Footwear”, located in Kamza, is a shoe manufacturing enterprise in tripartite cooperation China-Albania-Europe, which makes products for well-known brands in European markets, mainly in Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAccording to the Albanian National Business Center, the number of Chinese companies operating in Albania is 149, as of April 2018.\n\nCooperation between China and Employers’ and Branch Associations\n\nEconomic relations between the two countries have strengthened in recent years. Around 150 Chinese national companies are present in Albania in various sectors according to the Chinese Embassy website.\n\nThe Chinese companies, at least from what we can gather from information posted in the website Chinese embassy in Tirana, organises regular meetings with Chinese companies. On 29 May 2019, a meeting of Chinese companies took place at the Chinese embassy. The meeting was attended by Chinese ambassador to Albania Zhou Ding, adviser Lian Gang, and representatives of dozens of Chinese companies, such as Tirana International Airport, Bankers Petroleum, Sinohidro, Hailong Oil Service, CRTV, and Huawei. On 6-7 February 2019, the ambassador of China to Albania Zhou Ding visited the Chinese companies Hailong Oil Service and Bankers Petroleum, to express “sincerest congratulations” to the Chinese and foreign employees of the two companies for having continued to work even during Chinese Spring Festival holiday.\n\nThe Chinese embassy also convenes meetings on the security of Chinese companies in Albania.\n\nCooperation takes place between the local Chinese embassy and the Farmers’ Association and local farmers via a programme for agricultural cooperation.\n\nTrade fairs\n\nActivities and participation in joint trade fairs has been expanding. In 2015, a Business-Art-Coexistence event was organised by the Klik Ekspo Group. In the same year, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama visited Hong Kong to attend the Economic Forum where more than 100 companies interested in trading with Albania were represented. In 2018, Albanian firms attended the first China International Import Expo trade fair held in Shanghai, showcasing products such as Skenderbeu cognac, Albanian wine, liquors, cream liquor, spirits, honey, medical and aromatic plants, herbs, essential oils, and more. Albanian companies also attend the various China-Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) Investment and Trade Expos.\n\nPolitics\n\nCooperation by China with local political parties; agreements, visits, and exchanges.\n\nIn March 2015, the Socialist Party of Albania, the Democratic Party of Albania, and the Socialist Movement for Integration sent a delegation to Suzhou for the 4th China-Europe High-level Political Parties Forum.\n\nIn March 2015, the Socialist Party of Albania, the Democratic Party of Albania, and the Socialist Movement for Integration sent a delegation to China for the China-CEEC Young Political Leaders Forum.\n\nIn December 2018, Ambassador Jiang stated that exchanges and cooperation had intensified with a total of 28 cooperation documents signed in 17 areas over the previous three years. China has become an important source of foreign investment in Albania with collaborations in infrastructure, energy and minerals, human resources, agriculture, and tourism becoming new growth points. Human-cultural exchanges were also on the rise.\n\nProminent political figures with official positions on relations with China\n\nCooperation Framework: number of state-to-state agreements, areas of formalized cooperation, agreements and projects with local authorities, exchange and training programmes with civil servants\n\nRegular exchanges of official visits have taken place between Albania and China over the years. In 2000, upon invitation of the Albanian foreign minister Paskal Milo, China’s foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, paid a two-day visit to Tirana. During the visit, the president, Rexhep Meidani, the prime minister, Ilir Meta, and the speaker of parliament, Skender Gjinushi, met with Tang.\n\nIn 2002, Chinese state councillor Wu Yi conducted a two-day visit to Tirana and met with President Rexhep Meidani to discuss bilateral relations and cooperation.\n\nIn 2004, Fatos Nano, the prime minister, met with Chinese president Hu Jintao at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and discussed further deepening of bilateral relations.\n\nIn 2009, Sali Berisha, the prime minister, visited China and met Hu, marking the 60th anniversary of Sino-Albanian diplomatic ties. At that event Hu stated that relations between China and Albania were at a new starting point, with a new opportunity for further development and pragmatic cooperation.\n\nIn 2011, the Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, visited Tirana and met the prime minister, Sali Berisha, the speaker of parliament, Jozefina Topalli and the president, Bamir Topi.\n\nIn 2017, Zhang Gaoli, Chinese vice-premier visited Albania for two days and met the president, Bujar Nishani, and the prime minister, Edi Rama. On that occasion, Zhang highlighted the importance of Albania as an integral part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and welcomed the intensification of Albania’s participation in the “16+1” cooperation format. Rama is the only Albanian prime minister since 1991 to have a one-to-one meeting with a Chinese president. The only meetings he has held have been within the “16+1” framework with premier Li Keqiang.\n\nThe “16+1” cooperation mechanism gave new impetus to Sino-Albanian relations, helping increase trade and investment. In Albania, the China-CEEC cooperation platform is mostly deals with investments and trade. Some individual cases have attracted public attention, such as the acquisition of the controlling rights of two Albanian oil fields (Patos-Marinza and Kucova) from Geo-Jade Petroleum (a Shanghai based company) specifically, which in total produce around 13,000 barrels of crude oil per day.\n\nIn 2001, Albania and China signed three agreements covering financial and technical aspects of the construction of the Bushat hydropower station in northern Albania. Beijing provided support for the $126 million preferential loan project, and the station was built by China International Water and Electricity Corp in 2008.\n\nIn 2005, cooperation agreements were signed between the armed forces of the two countries. Four years later, in April 2009, Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha visited Beijing. On that occasion, during the talks with the Hu Jintao, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, and other Chinese leaders, Berisha said he wished to see strengthened relations based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence and raise them to a higher level. The two sides signed a joint statement on deepening traditional friendly relations and documents on cultural and health cooperation. As one of the most important documents in Sino-Albanian relations, the joint statement set out the basic principles of bilateral relations, including the political basis and directions of development and cooperation. The four main points highlighted are:\n\nIncreasing dialogue as the basis for stable political relations;\n\nGreater emphasis on cooperation in the field of information technologies, energy, infrastructure, and mining research;\n\nExpansion of cooperation in the fields of culture, health, agriculture, and tourism; and\n\nStrengthening coordination in the United Nations and other international organisations on the protection of the interests of developing countries and the unity of the United Nations.\n\nDuring his stay in Tianjin for the World Economic Forum between 9-12 September 2014, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang held a bilateral meeting. The Chinese prime minister stressed that the 65th anniversary of diplomatic relations should be an opportunity to improve high-level exchanges and promote practical cooperation in all areas. The forum was the venue for the signing of a memorandum of cooperation between representatives of the Albanian Ministry of Energy and Industry and PowerChina as well as for the conclusion of the agreement on the construction of highway between Albania and North Macedonia.\n\nLater, at the Belgrade Summit in December 2014, the two prime ministers agreed on the construction of Arber Road to link Albania with North Macedonia. The highway would continue to Bulgaria, connecting Albania’s Ionian Sea coast with Bulgaria’s Black Sea coast. However, the project did not come to fruition due to an investigation by the Chinese authorities into corruption at China State Construction Engineering Company (CSCEC). In the same year, at the “17+1” summit in Belgrade an agreement was reached on the construction of an industrial park and the development of port infrastructure in the coastal city of Durrës.\n\nIn November the following year, a memorandum of understanding was signed on a project to build the Adriatic-Ionian highway from Trieste in Italy, through Croatia, Montenegro, and Albania, to Greece. This project held national significance and opened-up the possibility for building parts of the Thumane–Peze-Mullet road and the Peze Mullet–Dushk road.\n\nIn April 2016, Chinese firm Geo-Jade Petroleum acquired the Canadian oil company Bankers Petroleum, which also operates in Albania, for $575 million, which included the oilfields of Patos–Marinze and Kucova.\n\nAt the same time, the Chinese company Everbright Limited acquired through concession Tirana International Airport until 2025 with a possible two-year extension.\n\nIn addition, the Chinese company Sinomine Resource Exploration has established a daughter company in Albania, which works on the construction of mines and geological tests in cooperation with the Albanian Geological Institute.\n\nIn 2017, China granted a relatively modest €1.5 million to the Albanian government to modernise the agricultural sector, and $2 million for the reconstruction of the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet and the Popular Ensemble. These figures are taken from the embassy website.\n\nIn November 2015, a memorandum of understanding between Albania, Montenegro, and Chinese firm Pacific Construction Group was signed by Albania’s prime minister, Edi Rama, during the “16+1” economic summit in Suzhou, China.\n\nOn the personal initiative of the Chinese ambassador, China has funded the purchase of ten new excavators for the opening and cleaning of the main drainage channels in the most problematic areas of Albania.\n\nThe ambassador declared that China will also support Albania to improve the irrigation of agricultural land. The Albanian Ministry of Agriculture and the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources are expected to sign a Memorandum of Cooperation in the upcoming months.\n\nIn 2014, the Albanian Ministry of Energy and Industry and the Chinese state-owned company PowerChina signed a memorandum of collaboration in Beijing. The Albanian delegation was headed by Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama. According to the China International Radio (Albanian section), the memorandum emerged from discussions between the two prime ministers who expressed their support for its swift implementation. PowerChina owns about 50% of the world hydroenergy sector while hydropower itself makes up for 17% of the total electric power capacity worldwide.\n\nIn 2015, Yan Jiehe, the president of the China Pacific Construction Group, the biggest Chinese private construction company, held a meeting with the minister of transport and infrastructure, Edmond Haxhinasto, to discuss opportunities to invest in Albania. The official press release of the Ministry of Transport announced that Haxhinasto presented to the representatives the Adriatic-Ionian highway and the Eighth Corridor as priority infrastructure projects in the country. The Albanian Ministry of Transports and Infrastructure subsequently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China Pacific Construction Group.\n\nIn September 2015, the People’s Bank of China and the Bank of Albania signed the Chinese yuan/Albania lek bilateral currency swap arrangement agreement and held a virtual conference on “Partnership bridges and opportunities to promote trade in the field of agriculture between Albania and China”.\n\nIn 2017, China and Albania signed a cooperation document on the joint construction of “One generation, one road”, bilateral treaty, which has led to the expansion of cooperation in trade, culture, education, and health; and between policy research institutes and local governments.\n\nIn November 2016, in the presence of the prime ministers of the two countries, a memorandum of cooperation was signed in human resource development. The two sides agreed that China should provide support to the Albanian government in the implementation its 100 Villages project, which aims to support and train Albanian village mayors. In 2019, a seminar was held on the modernisation of public administration through use of performance management.\n\nIn April 2017, former member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the People’s Republic of China and former Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Zhang Gaoli visited Albania. During the visit, he and Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, jointly determined the level of this commission at the level of ministers and, as a result, the platform of cooperation and economic and trade exchanges between the two parties has reached a new level. Since January 2014, when the 8th meeting of the Joint Intergovernmental Economic and Trade Commission between the two countries was held in Tirana, the parties embraced the proposal of a bilateral initiative titled “One generation, one road”, in the framework of “16 +1” cooperation format. Reciprocal high-level visits of the two sides have been frequent and have promoted the successful development of economic and trade relations between China and Albania.\n\nOn 27 February 2019 in Tirana, a ceremony was held to donate physical training equipment from the Chinese government to Albania’s Republican Guard.\n\nCooperation with local government – projects, initiatives, and visits\n\nOn 25 October 2019, the “17+1” forum was held in Tirana at the level of mayors. This was an initiative led by China that aimed to increase and expand cooperation with central and eastern European countries in the field of investment, transport, finance, science, education, and culture\n\nThe ambassador of China, Zhou Ding, held a meeting in October 2019 with the mayor of the city of Elbasan, Gledian Llatja. Zhou said that Sino-Albanian friendship had a long history and that Elbasan had an inseparable connection with China. In the 1960s and 1970s, many Chinese technicians and engineers were in Elbasan, contributing to the industrial construction and economic development of Albania and leaving precious memories of a rich historical heritage. The ambassador said that China was ready to further increase ties with Elbasan, using the “17+1” mechanism, and increase cooperation in economy, culture, and tourism, to realise mutual benefits\n\nOn 5 September 2018, the tree of the city of Beijing, platycladus orientalis, was donated and planted in a ceremony in the Artificial Lake Park of Tirana. Vice-chair of the Standing Committee of the People’s Assembly of Beijing City, Yan Aoshuang, and the mayor of Tirana, Erion Veliaj, undertook the planting together, which was to symbolise the friendship of the two cities in the new era and celebrate the 10th anniversary of the twinning of the two cities.\n\nOn 5 September 2018, a Chinese-style quadrangular “Shanshui” pavilion was inaugurated in the Tirana Artificial Lake Park as a gift from China Zhenjiang International Economic-technical Cooperation Corporation Limited (CZICC) to the Municipality of Tirana.\n\nCivil society\n\nCivil society cooperation with Chinese organisations by sector\n\nIn July 2019, the China Disabled People’s Performing Art Troupe staged performances in Albania.

The ambassador said: “China is an important trading partner of Albania. We have overcome major obstacles to international transportation and provided Albania with medical emergency equipment, including test kits, protective suits, gloves and masks, worth over 500,000 Euros. Chinese health experts and medical staff have held video conferences with the Albanian side to share their experiences. Chinese companies and individuals have supported Albania in their own ways.”\n\nIn September 2020, China and central and eastern European countries held a video-conference of experts on covid-19, a video-conference of the ministers of health on covid-19, and a video-conference of the national coordinators of “17+1” cooperation, to share experiences in prevention, control, and treatment.
