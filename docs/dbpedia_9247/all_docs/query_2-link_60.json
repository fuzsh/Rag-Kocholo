        "text": "FOR years I had wanted to visit Shqiperia - the land of the eagle - whose people reputedly descend from the ancient Illyrians and have spent their entire history fighting foreign domination.\n\nBut Shqiperia, better known as Albania, has been the most rigidly controlled and impenetrable country in Europe. Ruled by the Stalinist leader Enver Hoxha for 40 years, Albania turned its back on the United States, the Soviet Union and China, preferring to go it alone.\n\nUntil recently the Socialist People's Republic of Albania was virtually closed to Americans, except for a few carefully screened Albanian-Americans. But now, President Ramiz Alia, who has ruled since Mr. Hoxha's death in 1985, has begun to open the doors to a limited number of foreign tourists. An estimated 10,000 tourists visited Albania this year, just a handful of them Americans.\n\nAt the end of October I joined a Greek tour group in Athens for a six-day tour to Albania; our overall impressions of this Communist Balkan state on the Adriatic were mixed.\n\nThere is a pristine charm about the rugged, mountainous country, which is just a little larger than Maryland and has only three million inhabitants. Albania, which sits between Yugoslavia to the north and east and Greece to the south, is the world as it used to be in the 1950's. The insular society seems to have escaped such modern ills as drug addiction, alcoholism, violent crime, AIDS and automobile congestion. It is practically an environmentalist's paradise, with generally unpolluted air, clean parks and beaches and natural, fresh foods. The state assures its citizens housing, employment, free health care and schooling and cultural opportunities.\n\nBut these advantages have come at a price: total suppression of freedom of speech and movement; outlawing of all religious faiths and practice; abolition of all private property, including private cars. The Sigurimi, or secret police, are everywhere and someone seen making the sign of the cross can get a three-year jail sentence.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
