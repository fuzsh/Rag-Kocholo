        "text": "Tirana is a colorful and unique European capital – perfect for those who are looking for a slightly different city vacation.\n\nWe had mixed expectations when our plane landed at Mother Teresa International Airport outside Tirana. The airport has been given this name because Mother Teresa was born precisely in Albania, one of the many things we did not know about Albania before our trip here. However, during our stay, we were pleasantly surprised by this small country by the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nHow to get from the airport to Tirana?\n\nThere are two main options when you want to go from the airport to Tirana – taxi or bus. Both will take about 30 minutes depending on the traffic.\n\nIf you go for a taxi, it is important to check that it is actually a real taxi. There are many pirate taxis in Tirana, especially at airports and major bus stops (one time we ended up in a pirate taxi without realizing it until we were inside). Make sure to agree on a price in advance, or check that the taximeter is switched on.\n\nThe other option is the airport bus, which we chose to try. The quality of these buses does not compare with the airport buses we are used to in Norway. You sit tightly cramped together, there is no air conditioning, and the bus does not run until it is full, even though it is officially supposed to run once an hour. In addition, we had to search a bit before we found the bus, which only has a small paper sheet in the windscreen indicating the destination. Do not ask the taxi drivers standing right outside the terminal, as we did. The answer we got was “No bus. Two hours.” Of course, that was not true. The bus left as soon as it was full, which did not take more than 15 minutes.\n\nThe bus operated by LUNA Travel is called Rinas Express. It cost around 3€, and you can pay with cash (Albanian LEK or Euro) on the bus. It stops at a park in the center of the city, near the National Theater and Skanderbeg Square. If you want to get off earlier, just let the driver know.\n\nThings to do in Tirana\n\nAlbania is among the poorest countries in Europe, but the country’s economy has picked up significantly in recent times. The contrasts are clearly visible in the capital, with beggars on street corners and buildings with peeling paint right next to shiny new skyscrapers, ultra-modern concept bars, and a vibrant cafe culture that brings together locals and tourists alike.\n\nThe capital also has clear marks of being under renovation, with a number of new hotels, office buildings, and skyscrapers under construction around the city.\n\nTirana offers a vast selection of sights and exciting experiences. The city is an up-and-coming travel destination, and we predict its popularity will increase sharply in the future.\n\nSkanderbeg Square\n\nSheshi Skënderbej, or Skanderbeg Square, is a great place to start exploring the city. This is a large open square in the city center, covered in a mosaic of colorful tiles. The square gets its name after Albania’s national hero Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu, who ruled in the 15th century. A number of interesting buildings surround the square. Among other things, you’ll find the City Hall, the National Library, Tirana’s Clock Tower, the Hajji Et’hem Bey Mosque, and the National History Museum here.\n\nWhen the Clock Tower is open, you should be able to climb the 90 or so steps up the tower and admire a great 360-degree view of the city and Skanderbeg Square.\n\nYou should also check out the Hajji Et’hem Bey Mosque as you stroll through the square. This is Albania’s oldest mosque and one of the very few religious buildings that survived the communist era. The mosque with its Ottoman architecture has beautiful frescoes covering the outside walls. Since religion was prohibited, the building remained closed until January 1991, when more than 10,000 people participated in an illegal religious protest. This event marked the beginning of the fall of communism and was a rebirth of religious freedom in Albania.\n\nThe Tirana Pyramid\n\nA short distance from the square you will find Tirana’s Pyramid, a legacy from the communist era in Albania. The pyramid was originally a museum in honor of Enver Hoxta, the former communist leader of the country. Since its construction, it has served several purposes. One time a nightclub, and during the war in the former Yugoslavia, the pyramid was actually used as a NATO base. Now the building has received a massive facelift and is now a center for technology, art, and culture. Of all the things to do in Tirana – this is absolutely a must. It’s a bit quirky, but also pretty cool!\n\nBlloku\n\nA short distance from the pyramid, you enter Blloku, Tirana’s most popular and well-developed urban area, with stylish bars and trend-setting restaurants. In the past, the district was closed to ordinary citizens, it was exclusively members of the Communist Party who worked and lived here. You can still see the former house of the dictator Enver Hoxha, now turned into a museum.\n\nBlloku has now become the nicest (and most expensive) place to live in Tirana. If you want to enjoy a vibrant and exciting nightlife, this is where you go! Quench your thirst with unique and innovative drinks at one of the colorful bars, or sit down at a finer restaurant and eat everything from well-known international dishes to the fine dining version of Albanian cuisine.\n\nBlloku is also the perfect place to try a few local beers – check out our guide to Albanian beer!\n\nArtificial lake\n\nShould you need a little break from the noisy car traffic (yes, the Albanians are a bit impatient while driving) and the bustling life of the city, Tirana’s artificial lake is a nice place to relax. Here you can find a place under a palm tree and read a book, or get some work done on the laptop. If you are an ornithologist, you can study the exciting birdlife at the lake.\n\nIf you like to walk the whole way round, it is probably a good idea to set aside an hour or two, as it is a five-kilometer walk. If you do not feel like walking that far, you can settle down at one of the many small cafes in the area around the park. If your stomach rumbles, you will also find many nice places to eat nearby. Be aware that there are a number of stray dogs in the park, and the water quality is not at its best, so swimming is not recommended.\n\nBunk’art 2\n\nThere are two Bunk’art museums in Tirana. While number one is slightly on the outskirts of the city, the other one is right in the city center. The museums are former underground bunkers intended as refuges for the dictator and the political elite in case the Cold War developed into a nuclear war. Now they’ve been converted into history museums with interactive art.\n\nBunk’art 2 is the smallest and newest of the museums and is located a short distance from Skanderbeg Square. If you have several days at your disposal, we recommend you also take a trip to Bunk’art 1, but if not, you should at least make time for Bunk’art 2. Here you get a glimpse into the dark and paranoid times Albania found itself in after the Second World War, and what life was like for the military and communist police.\n\nTirana Castle (Kalaja e Justinianit)\n\nA short distance from Skanderbeg Square lies Tirana Castle, the ruins of a former Byzantine fortress. The fortress was strategically located at the intersection of the main roads connecting east to west and north to south.\n\nIn 2018, a bazaar was opened aiming to create a fusion of traditional and modern elements in Tirana. A narrow pedestrian street winds its way between restaurants, bars, and small, charming shops selling authentic Albanian handicrafts and souvenirs.\n\nTirana New Bazaar\n\nAs the name suggests, Tirana’s New Bazaar is relatively new in the Albanian capital. This area is located a 10-15 minute walk from Skanderbeg Square and includes a large food market and flea market, along with cafes and small taverns serving traditional Albanian cuisine.\n\nThis was just a small selection of everything Tirana has to offer. Do you have more time on your hands, and want to go on a fun and exciting day trip?\n\nCheck out our article about our day trip to Dajti Mountain and Bunk’art 1 (only in Norwegian at the moment).\n\nIs Tirana cheap?\n\nYes, absolutely. At least if you are Norwegian. 🙂\n\nFor example, a three-course dinner for two including a large carafe of wine cost 25-35€ at a midrange restaurant (2023). Despite the reasonable prices, the quality is excellent. We recommend that you try out some of the local dishes.\n\nRead our article about what to eat and drink in Albania.\n\nThe standard of the hotels in the city is probably a little variable, but you get acceptable accommodation in a double room in a three-star hotel at prices from 30€ and up. The English skills of the employees at the hotels also vary. But knowing a few Italian words will come in handy, as many Albanians have it as their second or third language.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that Albania is mostly a cash-only destination, so it’s a good idea to either bring cash from home or hit the ATM at the airport. There are a few ATMs in Tirana, but they are often out of order and hard to find.\n\nWhy travel to Tirana?\n\nIt’s warm and sunny in the summer season\n\nOne of Europe’s cheapest travel destinations\n\nInnovative, but at the same time traditional food scene\n\nModern cafes and concept bars\n\nHistorical attractions and art from the Communist era\n\nTirana might not be suitable if you:\n\nExpect consistent standards in hotels\n\nWant comfortable local transport that is easy to find\n\nWant to communicate easily in English\n\nOther cities in Albania"
