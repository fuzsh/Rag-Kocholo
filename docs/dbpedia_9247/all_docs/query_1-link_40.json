        "text": "The People's Socialist Republic of Albania led by Enver Hoxha is a custom civilization by Alga, with contributons from DarthKyofu, Urdnot and JFD.\n\nThis mod requires Brave New World.\n\nOverview[]\n\nAlbania[]\n\nThe People's Socialist Republic of Albania was the Marxist–Leninist one party state that existed in Albania from 1946 to 1991 (the official name of the country was the People's Republic of Albania) from 1946 until 1976. From 1944 to 1946, the state of Albania was known as the Democratic Government of Albania.\n\nDuring this time period, the country was ruled by Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour of Albania. They ruled Albania by establishing a Albanian stalinist style of state administration and adhering to policies which stressed national unity and self-reliance. Travel and visa restrictions made Albania one of the most difficult countries to visit or travel from. Former President Ilir Meta called it the \"North Korea of Europe\" during an interview with Euronews. Being Europe's only Muslim-majority country, it declared itself the world's first atheist state in 1967. But after the fall of communism in Albania in 1991, the practice of religion slowly increased. It was the only Warsaw Pact member to formally withdraw from the alliance before 1990, an action which was occasioned by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968.\n\nThe government implemented reforms which were aimed at modernizing Albania and they resulted in significant gains in the areas of industry, agriculture, education, the arts, and culture, which contributed to a general increase in the Albanian population's standard of living. However, these developments coincided with political repression by the secret police, the Sigurimi, for the purposes of preventing a counter-revolution, which included dismissal from employment, imprisonment in forced labor camps and executions. The first multi-party elections in Socialist Albania took place on 31 March 1991 – the Communists gained a majority in an interim government. The Republic of Albania was proclaimed on 29 April 1991 and the country's first parliamentary elections were held on 22 March 1992. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania was officially dissolved on 28 November 1998 upon the adoption of the new Constitution of Albania.\n\nEnver Hoxha[]\n\nEnver Halil Hoxha was an Albanian communist politician who was the authoritarian ruler of Albania from 1944 until his death in 1985. He was First Secretary of the Party of Labour of Albania from 1941 until his death. He was also a member of the Politburo of the Party of Labour of Albania, chairman of the Democratic Front of Albania, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces and ruled the country from 1944 until his death. He was the 22nd Prime Minister of Albania from 1944 to 1954 and at various times was both foreign minister and defence minister of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania.\n\nHoxha was born in Gjirokastër in 1908 and became a grammar school teacher in 1936. Following the Italian invasion of Albania, he joined the Party of Labour of Albania at its creation in 1941 in the Soviet Union. He was elected First Secretary in March 1943 at the age of 34. Less than two years after the liberation of the country, the monarchy of King Zog was formally abolished, and Hoxha rose to power as Albania's symbolic head of state.\n\nDuring his 41-year rule, his government rebuilt the country, which was left in ruins after World War II, building Albania's first railway line, raising the adult literacy rate from 5–15% to more than 90%, wiping out epidemics, electrifying the country and leading Albania towards agricultural independence. It also outlawed religion, travelling abroad, private proprietorship, and closed or converted to secular uses all of Albania's religious facilities. His government imprisoned, executed, or exiled thousands of landowners, rural clan leaders, Muslim and Christian clerics, peasants who resisted collectivization, and disloyal party officials.\n\nHoxha's government was characterised by his proclaimed firm adherence to anti-revisionist Marxism–Leninism, i.e. Stalinism, from the mid/late-1960s onwards. After his break with Maoism in the 1976–1978 period, numerous Maoist parties around the world declared themselves Hoxhaist. The International Conference of Marxist–Leninist Parties and Organisations (Unity & Struggle) is the best-known association of these parties.\n\nDawn of Man[]\n\n\"Stay alert, Enver Hoxha, First Secretary and Prime Minister of Albania, Supreme Comrade, Sole Force and Great Teacher, for there are enemies on all sides. A hero partisan in the fight against Nazism, you fought as a true Marxist–Leninist and an admirer of Stalin. You deposed King Zog at the end of the war, and when the revisionists took power in the Warsaw Pact, you retaliated by moving towards Maoism. But even then, the Maoists were too ideologically impure, leading to the true Marxism–Leninism ideology being developed, Hoxhaism. Under Hoxhaism and the Cultural and Ideological Revolution, women’s rights advanced as they were encouraged to take up all jobs, direct taxation was abolished, health and school care improved, the nation electrified, and the military adopted the strategy of the people’s war. Truly a great success.\n\nOh sublime Enver Hoxha, you must protect your people. Add to the 173,371 one-man concrete bunkers you built across the country to protect your people from the external invasions that will surely come from the capitalists to destroy your glory. Can you stop the degenerated bourgeois culture infiltrating and destroying the only true bastion of Marxism-Leninism, and the foreign agents sent here to coup you from destroying the glorious Albania? Will you build a civilization that can stand the test of time?\"\n\nIntroduction: \"Greetings Comrade, I am Enver Hoxha, Prime Minister of Albania, a great nation of proud people. How can you and your ideas be of service for us?\"\n\nDefeat: \"I woe for my dear nation, but you will never break the soul of the Albanian people.\"\n\nUnique Attributes[]\n\nAlbania (Enver Hoxha)\n\nFortress of Socialism\n\nGain Culture from finishing Defensive Buildings (Walls, Castle, etc.).
