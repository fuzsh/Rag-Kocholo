        "text": "# 10 Surprising Facts About Tirana\n\nTirana, the vibrant capital city of Albania, is often overshadowed by its more popular European neighbors. Yet, this city is rich in history, culture, and surprises that are just waiting to be discovered. From its colorful buildings to its unexpected history of religious tolerance, Tirana is a city full of hidden gems. Let’s uncover some of the most surprising facts about this eclectic capital.\n\n1. Tirana Wasn’t Always the Capital\n\nTirana has not always been the administrative heart of Albania. It’s a relatively young capital, officially designated in 1920. Before that, the title was held by the city of Durrës, an ancient port city with origins dating back to 627 B.C.\n\nThe selection of Tirana as the capital was partly due to its central location, which offered strategic advantages and easier accessibility. The city’s growth was significantly bolstered when Italian architects during the interwar period brought neoclassical flair to its design, laying the groundwork for it to become the bustling metropolis it is today.\n\n2. A City of Color\n\nOne of the most striking visual aspects of Tirana is its vibrantly painted buildings. The transformation began in 2000 under the leadership of former mayor Edi Rama, who was an artist before diving into politics. Rama launched a beautification campaign where old and communist-era grey buildings were repainted with colorful and abstract motifs.\n\nThis splash of color across the city’s landscape was not merely ornamental but symbolic of change and revitalization. It injected life and energy into urban areas that were previously drab and neglected. This has come to be known as a reflection of Tirana’s dynamic and hopeful spirit in the post-communist era.\n\n3. The Bunk’Art Museum\n\nTirana is home to Bunk’Art, a unique museum situated inside a massive Cold War bunker. Built in the 1970s under the dictatorial regime of Enver Hoxha, the bunker was intended to protect against a potential nuclear attack, a fear pervasive during the Cold War era.\n\nConverted into a museum and cultural space, Bunk’Art offers visitors a chilling look into Albania’s isolationist past, providing insight into the country’s communist history. The five-story bunker encompasses history and art installations, creating a haunting and educational experience.\n\n4. The Pyramid of Tirana\n\nAnother architectural oddity residing in the heart of Tirana is the Pyramid of Tirana. Originally designed by the daughter and son-in-law of Enver Hoxha, the pyramid was intended to be a museum commemorating the dictator’s life and legacy. However, its purpose and appearance have sparked much controversy over the years.\n\nAfter the fall of communism, the building served various functions, including a NATO headquarters during the Kosovo War, a television station, and even a nightclub. Plans to demolish it have been shelved, and the pyramid stands as a testament to Albania’s complex history.\n\n5. The City Is Named After a Castle\n\nTirana’s name is derived from “Tirkan,” which was a castle in the medieval Dajti Mountain region on the outskirts of the city. The area around this fortress was inhabited since antiquity, with the castle serving as an important focal point for tradesmen and military campaigns through the ages.\n\nEtymologically, the term “Tirana” is thought to come from the old Greek word “Theranda,” found in ancient Greek and Latin texts, referred to as a location where different trade routes met. The Byzantine historian John Kananos (12th century) was the first to mention “Tirkan.”\n\n6. Abandoned Military Installations\n\nThroughout the city and scattered across the Albanian countryside, one can find over 700,000 military bunkers. These concrete domes were constructed to protect Albania from potential invasions during Hoxha’s isolationist regime. The country was preparing for a war that never came.\n\nSome of these bunkers have found new life as quirky homes, cafes, and even mushroom cultivation sites. They are a stark reminder of a paranoid past but have become a surreal part of Albania’s cultural landscape."
