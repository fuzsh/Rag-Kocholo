        "text": "Albanian democracy was tested to its core in 2021 by the country’s tenth multiparty parliamentary elections since the collapse of communism. The incumbent Socialist Party was reelected for a third term, a feat no political party had ever achieved in post-communist Albania, retaining 74 seats in the 140-seat Kuvendi, Albania’s unicameral parliament. However, much of the pre- and postelection public discourse was filled with mutual recriminations and divisive rhetoric by leaders of the main political parties and the president, which led to incidents of public intimidation, injuries, and even deaths during the electoral campaigns.\n\nThe parliamentary elections, based on the Electoral Code amended in 2020, included several novelties, such as electronic voting in several polling centers as part of a pilot project and preferential voting on party lists. The amendments allowed party leaders to run for the parliament in up to four districts at a time. This granted them an unfair advantage compared to other candidates and is at odds with the democratic principle of equal opportunity.\n\nThe parliamentary elections were generally well administered. The Central Election Commission was able to introduce new technological tools to identify voters on election day, and new counting technologies were used in various polling centers. However, the integrity of the election was not fully intact, as credible allegations of vote buying, intimidation, and violence were reported. The Special Prosecution Office against Organized Crime and Corruption (SPAK) announced on May 6 that it had opened some 35 criminal proceedings, most regarding vote buying. The opposition Democratic Party created a unit called “Protect the Vote” to counter vote buying activities during the election, although this was seen as a paramilitary-style operation and potentially illegal since parallel structures to the police and army are prohibited by Albanian law. Yet it speaks to broader issues of public distrust in institutions that Albania has yet to provide for its citizens, namely, a functional liberal democratic system in which Albanians may freely choose their representatives without pressure or intimidation.\n\nIn the run-up to the parliamentary elections, President Ilir Meta openly campaigned against the incumbent Socialist Party and called for citizens to use violence if their vote was compromised. Following Meta’s outbursts, the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) urged the country’s main political leaders to “exercise restraint” and “clearly reject violence.” The Albanian presidency is largely ceremonial and generally understood to be apolitical. However, Meta went further to openly accuse the U.S. and EU of helping the prime minister and Socialist Party chairman, Edi Rama, to capture the state and the judicial system. In recent years, and especially during 2021, factions within the Socialist Movement for Integration (LSI, founded by Meta in 2004) and the Democratic Party have stepped up their harsh rhetoric towards the U.S. and EU, claiming they are interfering in Albania’s sovereignty and internal affairs.\n\nThis rhetoric of disapproval towards the U.S. and EU relates to the significant political and financial foreign investment in various new law-enforcement bodies and the justice system’s vetting process, which has raised high expectations for investigations into abuse of power and corruption by current and former public officials—for example, a former environment minister who embezzled millions in a public tender for waste incinerators. Following the elections, in June, the Kuvendi secured 104 votes to impeach President Meta for allegedly violating 16 constitutional articles, and for inciting violence during the 2021 parliamentary elections. (The Constitutional Court found in February 2022 that Meta’s actions did not amount to a grave violation of the constitution, which is the legal threshold for discharging a sitting president. ) Although the parliament may elect a new president as soon as May 2022, since Meta’s term ends in July 2022, the clash among the president, the government, and the parliament has further contributed to the already highly polarized political climate.\n\nDuring 2021, several leaks occurred that comprised the personal data of thousands of Albanian citizens. In April, before the elections, the online news outlet Lapsi.al reported that a database containing sensitive personal data of 910,000 citizens had allegedly been obtained by the Socialist Party from e-Albania, a government portal for the delivery of public services. The Socialist Party initially denied the existence of the database, but PM Rama later acknowledged that his party, since 2009, had maintained an internal database by collecting information from door to door in a so-called system of patronage. Although no investigation was launched into this “system of patronage,” or more generally into how political parties obtain and handle citizens’ personal data, SPAK ordered the seizure of electronic equipment of journalists at Lapsi.al. This action was deemed improper by the European Court of Human Rights and the High Court of Albania, which ruled that journalists should not disclose their sources of information to SPAK unless the authority had already exhausted all available investigative tools before claiming access to journalists’ data.\n\nThe data breach and aftermath show that Albania has not yet taken seriously its own laws on protecting citizens’ personal data while also underscoring the challenging environment for journalists and civil society activists in the country. Furthermore, the authorities’ overreach and seizure of electronic equipment without due process or proper care for the rule of law further erodes citizens’ trust in the country’s newly reformed justice system.\n\nThe main opposition Democratic Party experienced political turmoil in second half of 2021, amid power struggles between Lulzim Basha (who resigned as chairman in March 2022) and Sali Berisha (former chairman and former prime minister and president), thereby leaving the actions and policies of the Socialist Party–led government free of scrutiny. The power struggle has been ongoing since Basha expelled Berisha from the Democratic Party following the U.S. State Department’s public designation in May that Berisha had engaged in corrupt acts that undermine Albanian democracy.\n\nIn October, the EU published its 2021 Enlargement Progress Report on Albania and called on EU member states to greenlight the first intergovernmental conference to officially launch accession talks with Albania, as all preconditions had been met since March 2020. However, the intergovernmental was not held during the year, and the integration process has stalled. The EU is financing a number of projects to support Albania’s institutional capacity-building, particularly in the areas of rule of law and anticorruption; however, the European Court of Auditors published a special report (in January 2022) on “EU support for the rule of law in the Western Balkans” and found that such support and funding have had little impact on advancing fundamental rule of law reforms due to insufficient political will and a lack of engagement, including in Albania.\n\nThe EU’s anticorruption and rule of law support, and the U.S. State Department’s public designations, should be understood in the wider context of international foreign policy goals towards the Western Balkans. The desire is to have a partner in Albania who adheres to democratic norms, not problematic leaders who generate artificial political crises that the U.S. and EU are called upon to mediate. If these international anticorruption efforts and public designations are taken more seriously by Albania’s political parties, law-enforcement agencies, and judicial system, it could provide impetus for further domestic reforms. However, encouraging political parties to take responsibility for their own reform and to tackle allegations of abuse of power and corruption within their own ranks has proven to be very difficult."
