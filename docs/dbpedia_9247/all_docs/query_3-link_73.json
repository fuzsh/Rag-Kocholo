        "text": "Probably one of the most underrated countries in Europe at the moment, Albania is sure to surprise and delight. With a captivating mix of complex history, youthful and quirky culture, and untouched nature, now’s the time to head over there before the crowds come to their senses (!).\n\nGet your intro to this Balkan country in its capital, Tirana – the best place to witness the incredible transformation this wrongfully labeled “post-communist backwater” has been experiencing lately. Although a fairly new capital (1920), you can clearly see the marks of its complicated past from the Ottomans to the Italians and finally the communist era across the city. Start in its very center, Skanderbeg Square, named after the national hero of the country.\n\nGrab a seat at one of the cafes to take in the scene (the Palace of Culture has good ones overlooking the plaza).\n\nAlbania’s cafe culture is strong and wonderful. You’re guaranteed a great cup of coffee (cue the Italian invasion of the mid 20th century) and a myriad of pastries wherever you go. Traditional dishes are mixed in the menu and worth trying as it’s unlikely you would get a chance to see them outside of Albania. A lot of them are based on soured goat or sheep’s milk which is part of many traditional Albanian dishes, like in this breakfast dish of trahana – a soured milk soup with bread and cheese.\n\nYou’ll likely pass through this square an innumerable amount of times while in Tirana to get to another part of town, join a walking tour, or visit one of the many attractions around its periphery. From every corner you can see centuries old buildings and modern high rises in a tableau that may appear strange at first but endearing once you start to get to know the city a bit better.\n\nSay hi to Skanderbeg, the country’s national hero who led the rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century.\n\nTurn around to see the true jewel of the square – Et’hem Bej Mosque.\n\nDon’t be fooled by its small size (even more so now that it’s being dwarfed by tall buildings being erected right behind!) – its interior is splendid and well worth a short visit to admire it from up close.\n\nFamous especially for having survived the Communist regime which destroyed many of the country’s historic religious monuments, the 19th century mosque is one of the country’s best preserved.\n\nThe daylight is best to take in the colorful frescoes and woodwork.\n\nStep into the prayer hall for the full effect of being surrounded by intricate Ottoman frescoes under a giant dome…\n\nBehind the mosque, you’ll find The Clock Tower of Tirana, awkwardly fighting for space within the city center’s construction boom.\n\nClimbing its steps leads to a pretty view of the square and the center.\n\nGet back down and wander around the colorful ministry buildings which would cure anyone suffering from architecture boredom.\n\nThat green and blue tower that keeps catching your eyes everywhere you look is the Forever Green Tower build as part of Tirana’s reconstruction. At 85m high it is now one of the tallest buildings in the Balkans and is sure is a treat to see.\n\nLower to the ground with a much more significant history, notice the two adjoining concrete entrance and exit of Bunk’Art 2, an underground shelter turned museum and art space. Nothing in the vicinity reflects better Tirana’s initiative to use culture to memorialize the past while celebrating the beginning of a new era. This nuclear shelter was secretly built underneath the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the early ’80s by former dictator Enver Hoxha who suffered from paranoia and was convinced a nuclear war was inevitable.\n\nDuring his rule which lasted over 50 years, he built hundreds of thousands of bunkers all over Albania, enslaving and bringing an entire population to the brink of starvation. And of course history has proven that there was no such nuclear threat. Some of these bunkers are finding a second life today with great success. Make sure to visit the first Bunk’Art 1 and read about it in my other post – it’s just outside the city center, much bigger, and in my opinion much more interesting than #2).\n\nBunk’Art 2 remained hidden to the population until 2015 and turned into what it is today after the massive success of Bunk’Art 1 in the outskirts of Tirana. The exhibit focuses on the communist period and through 24 rooms (some rather unpleasant!) you learn about the political persecutions of 100,000 Albanians from 1945-1991, the creation of the state security police, and the atrocities that took place during this very dark period. Vintage photos of Albanians murdered by the Communist government line the domed entry while recordings of their relatives’ remembrances play on speakers.\n\nReemerge in the daylight to continue the architecture exploration in the fresh air. Close by, another marvel is the site of the Tomb of Kapllan Pasha who was the administrator of Tirana during the Ottoman period. As it’s a monument of cultural heritage, the city cleverly built the adjoining Plaza Hotel literally around it…\n\nThe huge orthodox church (Resurrection Cathedral) was completed in 2012 and has become quite an attraction with its gorgeous and flashy design.\n\nDown the street, admire the art installation “Reja (The Cloud)” made by a famous Japanese architect in front of the National Gallery of Arts. You can go inside, sit on it, and chill in the open air.\n\nFrom there, take Tirana’s pedestrian street Murat Toptani, named after the leading Albanian noble family under Ottoman rule. The stone-paved street is a wonderful shady respite with restaurants, cafes, and shops.\n\nAs with everywhere in the city, modern mixes with history here too and that stone wall you’ve been following for a bit finally leads to an opening… welcome to Tirana Castle. The fortress dates back to before 1300 and stands where the heart of Tirana was back then.\n\nToday you can go through the gate and stroll through the Old Bazaar lined with shops and restaurants focusing on traditions, culture, and art.\n\nAt the end you’ll spill out right onto Zhan D’Ark Boulevard (named after Joan of Arc) and right next to the modern looking Catholic Cathedral of St Paul.\n\nYou’ll be greeted by a statue of Mother Teresa at the entrance and a mosaic of her inside besides some beautiful stained glass windows.\n\nRounding up the most interesting religious monuments in the center, Namazgah Mosque (also called The Great Mosque of Tirana) was nearing completion when I visited and will be the largest mosque in the Balkans, able to fit 4500 worshippers.\n\nAcross the street, walk over the restored Tanner’s Bridge, an 18th century stone footbridge that was once the road used by livestock and produce to enter the city from the eastern highlands.\n\nWhen hunger strikes, right behind the bridge you’ll find a delightful traditional restaurant – Mrizi i Zanave Tirane.\n\nEnjoy farm to table cuisine in relative quietness during the week (the weekends turn into huge family gatherings with live music!) with ingredients coming straight from the mountains in the north where they also run an agritourism hotel/restaurant.\n\nA few blocks north you can see some of the ingredients in The New Bazaar, one of the oldest residential neighborhoods in Tirana with a small and beautiful farmer’s market in its central square.\n\nPeruse the fruits, vegetables, meat and fish as well as a few souvenirs and local handicrafts.\n\nStroll around the residential streets, you never know what you might stumble upon… wall mural? Antiqued wood carved door?\n\nOnce you start heading south, you’ll soon run into the Lana stream which flows through a concrete canal right in the center. Cross it on one of the numerous bridges to find yourself in Tirana’s coolest neighborhood – Blloku.\n\nBlloku, also known as The Block, is the trendiest (and most expensive) area in Tirana overflowing with cool restaurants, bars, cafes, and shops. It’s the best place to stay as you’re still central to everything there is to see in the city while benefitting from a charming, tree-lined residential atmosphere and fewer crowds.\n\nTirana has one of the strongest café culture I’ve seen and there’s a gorgeous one on every block, no joke. Just pick any, order a strong (i.e., Turkish style or espresso) coffee and a pastry and settle in for a while, people watching.\n\nOne you must seek out though is the treasure trove of Café-Museum Komiteti. This peculiar and totally charming cafe/bar was born out of the desire of the owner to store and expose his extensive collection of Albanian-made historical items of which there are thousands. It feels like you’re stepping into the coolest grandma’s house (if your grandma was a collector who also made local spirits….)\n\nYou can cozy up in any room depending on if you feel like admiring traditional costumes, antique tools, or artwork. Few places feel as warm and inviting plus you get to experience the local culture in a truly immersive way.\n\nThe inner courtyard is the true hangout spot especially when the light hits just right and illuminates quirky sculptures and colorful paraphernalia. One more reason to come – this is the best place to sample the widest variety of Raki, Albania’s traditional (and fiery!) spirit.\n\nAn equally cool and colorful cafe/bar (i.e., cafes are bars here meaning they’re always open from morning to evening and can serve you both caffeinated drinks or alcohol or both at any time…) is Radio Bar Tirana. Retro vibes and delicious cocktails are the draw here.\n\nHead to the covered backyard and try one of their locally made Raki-based drinks such as this Kaipiraki – lime, fig jam, grape Raki and sparkling water.\n\nYou can certainly eat beautifully at any cafes but leave some meals to try some more traditional Albanian food at restaurants such as Restaurant Piceri Era “Blloku” which I visited numerous times.\n\nHead to Kronos Fish Restaurant for impeccable seafood on a quiet street.\n\nWalk a few blocks south of Blloku for a big dose of greenery in Tirana’s Grand Park, the perfect place for a post meal quiet stroll.\n\nYou’ll find plenty of landmarks in the vast 230 hectares including castles turned restaurants, tombs from Albanian national heroes, an outdoor theater as well as a large artificial lake.\n\nNear the north side of the lake, Mullixhiu (“The Miller”) awaits in its mountain cabin setting to introduce you to a fancier side of Albanian country cuisine.\n\nAs one of the oldest wine-producing countries in the world, Albania is going through a mini wine revolution as winemakers slowly emerge from the dictatorship that crippled the industry. Now’s your chance to sample some special and unique indigenous grapes or local interpretation of international varieties before they start making their mark on the global scene. Blloku has a number of cozy wine bars like Vena Vinoteka (inside a shop) where you can taste your way through a large number of local labels with some quality nibbles. The owner lived in Italy for a while and brought back with him the tradition of the aperitivo – you’ll get some lovely complimentary snacks with your glass…\n\nTake an evening walk in the center to capture the numerous light displays around the main attractions. Head to Rinia Park to sit by the Taiwan Fountain Pool…\n\n… and get a new perspective of The Cloud as it shines bright against the dark blue sky.\n\nEnd your day right where you started at Skanderbeg Square. Watch the locals meet up on the stairs and head out to dinner, catch the mosque in a glorious glow, and stop at one more cafe for a night cap of Raki as strong as Tirana…"
