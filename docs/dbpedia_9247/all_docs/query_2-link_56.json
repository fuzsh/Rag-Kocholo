        "text": "Independence[edit | edit source]\n\nThe First Balkan War began in October 1912 leading to the occupation of Albania, which was at that time a part of the Ottoman Empire, by the alliance of Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria and Montenegro.[1] On November 28, 1912, Albania's independence was declared to prevent its partition by the coalition and a provisional government was formed by Ismail Qemal-bey. Seeing an opportunity to expand their influence, Italy and Austria-Hungary declared their support for the states independence.[2]\n\nOn Dec. 17, 1912, at the London Conference, the European Great Powers recognized the autonomy of Albania and subsequently its independence was recognised by the 1913 Treaty of London and by the London Conference of Ambassadors held on July 29, 1913. Although officially independent, Albania was in actuality a puppet of the imperialist Great Powers. In March 1914 they imposed German Prince, William of Wied, as its monarch, who ruled the country until September 1914.[2]\n\nAlthough a neutral state Albania became a battleground following the outbreak of the First World War. In April 1915 the Entente signed the secret 1915 Treaty of London with Italy abolishing Albanian independence and giving Italy influence over Albania. Subsequently by the end of the war Albania was occupied by Italian, Serbian, and Greek troops.[2]\n\nThe October Revolution inspired a new fight for Albanian independence and the Albanian National Congress assembled Jan. 21–31, 1920, in Lushnje, proclaimed the independence of Albania. The Albanian government led a struggle against its foreign occupiers and feudal separatists between 1920 and 1922 ending in the liberation of their lands and from 1922 to 1924 Albania's borders were defined on the basis of the decision of the 1913 London Conference of Ambassadors.[3]\n\nFirst Republic[edit | edit source]\n\nIn its early days of emancipation, Albania remained unstable and impoverished with a political struggle raging between the feudal-landlord group led by Ahmed Zogu and the liberals led by Fan Noli. Following an uprising by the antifeudal movement In June 1924, Noli came to power with a programme of bourgeois democratic reforms leading Zogu to flee the country in what was essentially a bourgeois revolution. Although Noli's government made progressive decisions such as establishing relations with the Soviet Union, it was politically weak and the bourgeoisie proved themselves incapable of destroying feudalism and defending Albania from imperialism.[3]\n\nIn December 1924 counterrevolutionary forces led by Zogu crossed the border from Yugoslavia with support from the imperialist powers of Britain, France and Italy allowing Zogu to repress democratic forces and seize power. On January 21, 1925, Albania was declared a republic with Zogu as president but Zogu would later on September 1, 1928, change Albania into a monarchy and declare himself King Zog. Zogu's reactionary regime subjugated itself to Fascist Italy providing the power with agricultural goods and raw materials and allowed Italy to consolidate control over the country year by year. The people were restless throughout the rule of the regime and during the 1930s many uprisings occurred and several resistance groups, communists among them, formed to fight the repressive regime.[3]\n\nOn April 7, 1939, Fascist Italy invaded Albania and formed a personal union with the country on April 12 setting up a puppet government. At the beginning of the Second World War, resistance to fascist occupation was disorganised and limited but the entry of the Soviets into the war and the establishment of the Communist Party of Albania in November 1941 helped lay the foundation for victory in the national liberation struggle. By September 1943 the Italian occupiers had been driven from most of Albania but they were soon replaced by occupiers from Nazi Germany arriving on September 10, 1943. With the Soviets advancing on the eastern front and the successful repulsion of German attacks by the Albanians from late 1943 to early 1944, the Albanians were soon able to push back the Fascists and complete the liberation of Albania on November 29.[4]\n\nSocialist period[edit | edit source]\n\nSee main article: People's Socialist Republic of Albania (1946–1992)\n\nCounterrevolution[edit | edit source]"
