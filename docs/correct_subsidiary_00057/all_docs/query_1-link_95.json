        "text": "Morteza Ejabat\n\nMORTEZA EJABAT is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Zhone\n\nTechnologies, Inc., the first company dedicated solely to delivering the\n\nfull spectrum of next-generation wireline communications equipment.\n\nUnder his leadership, Zhone’s market share and product portfolio has\n\ngrown significantly both through organic growth and the 10 acquisitions\n\nZhone has made in the past four years. In addition, Zhone has recently\n\nbecome a publicly traded company through a reverse merger with Tellium,\n\nInc., in November 2003. Before founding Zhone, Mr. Ejabat was President\n\nand CEO of Ascend Communications, Inc., which was sold to Lucent\n\nTechnologies in 1999 for $24 billion. Ascend was the leader in wide area\n\nnetwork (WAN) solutions for providers and users of the Public Network.\n\nMr. Ejabat joined Ascend in 1990 as Vice President of Operations and\n\nassumed increasingly strategic roles within the company over his tenure\n\nwith the company. He served as President, COO and Director of Ascend\n\nbefore its IPO in 1995. Under Mr. Ejabat’s leadership, Ascend’s annual\n\nsales grew from $40 million to nearly $2.3 billion in just over five\n\nyears, with an increase in personnel from less than 100 to more than\n\n3,000 full-time employees by the end of 1998. Ascend’s business success\n\nwas achieved both through organic growth and strategic acquisitions, the\n\nmost notable being the $3.7 billion purchase of Cascade Communications\n\nin 1997 and of Stratus Computer Corporation in 1998. Earlier, Mr. Ejabat\n\nwas Vice President for wide area communications products at Micom\n\nSystems, Inc., where he had total P&L responsibility for the WAN product\n\nline. Mr. Ejabat received his BSIE and his MS in Systems Engineering\n\nfrom California State University at Northridge and he holds an MBA from\n\nPepperdine University."
