        "text": "MARLBOROUGH -- Two major employers have plans to move into the city over the next year, representing signs that the struggling local office market is on the mend.\n\nCytyc Corp. is moving its headquarters and about 300 employees from Boxborough to the former 3Com campus near Interstate 495 in Marlborough, the owner of the complex officially announced Friday.\n\nCytyc Corp., maker of a cervical cancer-screening test, signed a 15-year lease for 216,000 square feet of space -- one of four buildings at The Campus at Marlborough, the 125-acre property owned by Philadelphia-based Berwind Property Group.\n\n\"It's the biggest lease I can think of in quite a while in that submarket,\" said Kevin Hanna, a broker at Boston-based Cushman & Wakefield who represented Cytyc in the deal. \"It's definitely the biggest one in my recent memory.\"\n\nThe Cytyc lease puts the 531,000-square-foot campus' occupancy at 95 percent, a sharp rise from the 37 percent rate that Berwind inherited when it bought the property from 3Com in November 2002.\n\n\"That's a huge step for us,\" said Albert Corr, a Berwind vice president.\n\nMeanwhile, Natick-based medical-device maker Boston Scientific Corp. is close to finalizing the acquisition of the former Stratus Computer campus on Fairbanks Boulevard, city officials said.\n\nArthur Vigeant, an at-large City Council member, on Friday said the deal hinges, in part, on Marlborough accepting a small road that leads to the sprawling campus, which is owned by Hall Gillespie LLC. The City Council is scheduled to discuss the road acceptance and the pending sale at tomorrow night's meeting, Vigeant said.\n\nBoston Scientific spokesman Paul Donovan said the company is searching for expansion space in MetroWest but declined to comment on specific venues. The company, which is looking to hire 1,000 new employees worldwide, has no plans to leave Natick.\n\n\"All I can really say at this point is that Boston Scientific is a growing company,\" Donovan said Friday. \"That is creating a need for more space in Massachusetts and we are looking at expanding in the MetroWest area and looking at finding a way to address our space constraints.\"\n\nHall Gillespie officials could not be reached for comment Friday. Vigeant indicated a deal is close to being done for the Marlborough property.\n\n\"They're working on it now,\" he said. \"I think the sale will be done by mid-February.\"\n\nHall Gillespie bought the three-building campus for $27.5 million from Lucent Technologies in June 2002. It was Stratus Computer's headquarters from the 1980s until the high-tech giant was acquired by Ascend Communications in 1998, which was subsequently swallowed by Lucent. Most of the 500,000 square feet of space is empty.\n\nBoth deals would put a dent in Marlborough's high office vacancy rate, which stands at more than 30 percent in terms of total availability, including sublease space on the market.\n\nWith Cytyc's lease, Berwind also comes closer to meeting the requirements of its Tax Increment Financing agreement, or TIF, a state program that gives companies tax breaks in return for bringing an agreed-upon number of jobs to the city.\n\nBerwind must have 1,000 workers at its property -- down from the 1,200 requirement in the original TIF for 3Com -- by next June. The current tenants, which include 3Com, Exact Sciences Corp., National Grid and Wellington Management Co., employ about 800 people.\n\n\"We will exceed the (TIF) requirement with Cytyc,\" said John Brogan, a Berwind vice president who worked closely with city officials and Cytyc.\n\nThe city also helped seal the deal for Cytyc to sign with Berwind by agreeing to revise the TIF agreement to allow individual tenants the chance to receive their own tax breaks under a \"corporate condominium\" structure.\n\nThat revision, whose supporters included then-Mayor William Mauro and former city councilor and current Mayor Dennis Hunt, received state approval as well.\n\n\"They went to a lot of trouble for us,\" said Brogan. \"They had some political opposition to do that, but they did the right thing for the city and for us, and we appreciate it.\"\n\nHanna, the broker for Cytyc and a Framingham native, agreed. \"The city was accommodating. They recognized that it's important to diversify the tenant mix.\"\n\nBesides tax incentives, Cytyc was looking for a place with a connection to a sewer system, expansion possibilities and a location not too far from its current home up I-495 in Boxborough.\n\n\"It's a central location. You're not far from the Pike and you're right on 495,\" Hanna said. \"It didn't add a lot of drive time for employees.\"\n\nAnne Rivers, head of investor relations at Cytyc, declined comment Friday and said company officials were not available for comment.\n\nCytyc is actually coming full circle. The company started out in the late 1980s on Marlborough's Cedar Hill Street, then moved about a decade ago to Boxborough's Swanson Road, where it occupies 100,000 square feet of office and laboratory space.\n\nCytyc, which expects to relocate by early 2005, is moving in next door to a familiar firm. The aforementioned tenant, Exact Sciences, a biotech firm with its own cancer-screening technologies, was started in 1995 by Cytyc founder Stanley Lapidus.\n\nThe higher occupancy, meanwhile, puts wind in Berwind's sails -- enough so that it is already moving ahead with plans to build out the entire property. 3Com constructed the first four buildings in 1998, but there's room for another 670,000 square feet of office space in three to four buildings.\n\nBrogan said Berwind is working on a new master plan, which may differ from 3Com's vision, and expects to bring designs to the city within the next few months.\n\n(Greg Turner can be reached at gturner@cnc.com or 508-626-3909.)"
