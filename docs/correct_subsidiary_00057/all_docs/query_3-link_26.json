Goldenberg and\n\nSaro Saravanan,\n\nboth of Digital Equipment Corporation\n\nThis outstanding new book describes the internals and data structures of the OpenVMS AXP operating system Version 1.5 in vivid detail. Perhaps the most comprehensive and up-to-date description available for a commercial operating system, it is an irreplaceable reference for operating system development engineers, operating system troubleshooting experts, systems programmers, consultants and customer support specialists.\n\nSome of the text and much of the book's structure are derived from its highly successful predecessor, VAX/VMS Internals and Data Structures: Version 5.2. The new work is divided into nine parts: Introduction; Control Mechanisms; Synchronization; Scheduling and Time Support; Memory Management; Input/Output; Life of a Process; Life of the System; and Miscellaneous Topics. Each of the 39 chapters is akin to a case study on the topic it covers, based on the depth and breadth of treatment. Although the descriptions are of the OpenVMS operating system for the Alpha AXP family of processors, the concepts are equally applicable to the internals of any modern-day multiprocessing operating system running on a RISC computer.\n\nSAVE 20%\n\nPlace your order before June 1, 1994\n\nand qualify for the special\n\npre-publication price of $120.00.\n\nPrice after June 1, 1994 is $150.00.\n\nContents\n\nPreface Part I.
