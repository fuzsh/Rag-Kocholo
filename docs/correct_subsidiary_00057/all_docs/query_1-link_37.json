        "text": "Various Information on the Internet\n\nA subset of the Samba SMB client and server has been ported to VOS by Erik Devriendt. VOS Samba provides Windows-NT-style SMB network file and print services. You can read how to use it here.\n\nIf your computer is connected to the Internet, despite the custom in the VOS community, do not use an underscore character in its name, if you want the Domain Name System to keep track of it. We receive this same warning from The DNS Resources Directory and from cisco systems. This rule was established by RFC 1035 back in November 1987.\n\nWhen you are setting up your TCP/IP network for the first time, carefully consider the IP-address issues raised in RFC-1918. Advice on how to assign addresses in a private network can be found here. You can also consult the Internet Protocol (IP) Assignment Guidelines for End Users.\n\nIf you'd like a VOS version of the PKzip data-compression software to be available as a commercial product, go here and request it. However, a related type of compressed data storage can be achieved with other software tools freely available from the anonymous FTP Server.\n\nIf you read about all the different software problems that must be solved for the High-Availability Linux Project, you'll gain a greater appreciation for the benefits of the Stratus fault-tolerant hardware architecture.\n\nTelevideo terminals are frequently connected to Stratus hosts.\n\n(Diagrams of V102 keyboard templates available.)\n\nHere is information on many other types of video terminals.\n\nNew VOS \"ttp\" files for ANSI terminal types. (ftp)\n\nAlternatives to PC/Connect. (ftp)\n\nNew \"ttp\" files for DEC VT220 and VT320 video terminals, and for the CRT program a ttp file and a VOS keyboard setup.\n\nDocumentation on new ANSI-type ttps in VOS 13.5 and 14.0.\n\nAnd general advice on connecting terminals to Stratus systems.\n\nVOS 14.0 Documentation/Manual List (PDF file)\n\nStrataDoc on the Web (requires site ID and password)\n\nChronology of Stratus machines that support VOS\n\nThe Stratus V101 is a Televideo 950. The V102 terminal is a Televideo 955 equipped with the 2-page memory option. A Stratus V103 is a Link MC-5 (operated in TVI 955 mode). However, the new V105 is a different genus: it's a Boundless 4000/160 terminal, with either a PC-type or \"ANSI\" (DEC-like) keyboard, running in VT320/7-bit mode. (Here is some V105 information.)\n\nSTRATAGY User Group on the Web\n\nDisaster Recovery Journal\n\nDisaster Recover/Contingency Planning\n\nRead about C-Kermit for VOS and then get it (ckl*) from here.\n\nAtaman free software for Windows NT/2000 (including console \"vi\", \"more\", \"ed\" and \"emacs\")\n\nLevel 8 Systems (Geneva Message Queuing--GMQ, MSMQ implementation, Cicero)\n\nStratus HP-UX Product Information (2004 link)\n\nThe Unix Reference Desk (NWU)\n\nUnix Reference Desk (geek-girl.com)\n\nHP-UX FAQ (Ohio State)\n\nHP-UX Unix Book\n\nHP-UX software collection (Iowa)\n\nHP-Related Web Links (Interex)\n\nJava for HP-UX (HP)\n\nHP-UX Developer's Kit for Java (or try these developer's resources)\n\nwdb (GDB) GUI C++ debugging environment (www.hp.com)\n\nHP-UX Porting and Archive Center (in Utah--or use the alternative UK centre)\n\nAIX/HP-UX Interoperability Guide (InterWorks)\n\nBSD Unix to HP-UX Porting Tricks (Mike Peterson)\n\nHP-UX Patches (ftp: HP external)\n\nSearch HP-UX Sysadmin mailing list archive (nexial)\n\niij-ppp for HP-UX 10.x (barthold)\n\nWorkaround for Netscape binary-transfer problems?\n\nethereal network traffic analyzer for HP-UX (hpux.cict.fr)\n\nHP-UX 10.x Login White Paper (CERN: setup shell and terminal)\n\nMicroEmacs (several platforms, including HP-UX 10.20\n\nFormer Quotations of the Month\n\n\"As practiced by computer science, the study of programming is an unholy mixture of mathematics, literary criticism, and folklore.\"\n\n-- B. A. Sheil (circa 1981)\n\nStratus Computers Appear in Techno-Thriller:\n\n\"The client used Stratus mainframes, compact powerful machines that were easily networked....\"\n\n-- Tom Clancy, Debt of Honor, page 54.\n\nA distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn't even know existed can render your own computer unusable.\n\n-- Leslie Lamport\n\n\"We decided years ago that the most important element in this business is information technology, and we have geared everything to that philosophy--recruitment, training and compensation. Fail-safe precision is the key to it all.\"\n\n-- Frederick W. Smith, Chairman and CEO of FedEx.\n\nComputer science is the first engineering discipline ever in which the complexity of the objects created is limited by the skill of the creator and not limited by the strength of the raw materials. If steel beams were infinitely strong and couldn't ever bend no matter what you did, then skyscrapers could be as complicated as computers.\n\n-- Brian K. Reid, in Communications of the ACM, October 1987\n\nY2K Questions\n\nWe've heard that motorcycles and trucks will stop on January 1.\n\nIs it true that bicycles will also stop working?\n\nWill airplanes really fall out of the sky?\n\nWill Jesus return and tell all the Christians to become Muslims?\n\n-- Inhabitants of the village of Baani in Burkina Faso\n\n\"It's boring!\"\n\n-- Dan Danz of Stratus, at 1999-12-31 22:30 EST,\n\nwaiting for Y2K-related problems to be reported\n\nby Stratus customers around the world\n\nIf you have trouble accessing the FTP server at Stratus while using a Web browser, be sure that the IP address of the machine where your browser is running is registered in the Domain Name Service with a single, correct PTR record for reverse lookups to a domain name.
