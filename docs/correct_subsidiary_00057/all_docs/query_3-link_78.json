        "text": "Talk about kerb appeal! Tastefully decorated inside and out, these charming units are big on comfort and totally unique in style - one might even say each has its own personality! Of course, location is key, and you couldn't ask for a better spot than this. The small city of cabins are within easy walking distance of all camp amenities as well as training and recreational facilities. Don't see a unit dedicated to your particular godly parent? No worries! Once you're claimed, one can be built to suit. In the meantime, pull up a bunk in Cabin Eleven and stay awhile!\n\nWARNING! The divine cabins area is an active construction sites, so please watch out for exposed nails, exploding blocks and cracks that could plummet you to the Underworld.\n\nNOTE: You are free to add cabins or make improvements to the less described cabins.\n\nCabins and Claiming[]\n\nZeus Cabin[]\n\nThe Zeus Cabin the cabin for the children of Zeus/Jupiter, Greek/Roman king of the gods and god of thunder and lightning.\n\nClaiming and cabin[]\n\nWhen Zeus/Jupiter claims his children, a thunderbolt appears over the child's head.\n\nZeus' Cabin is described as looking like a white marble box, with heavy, white columns in the front. This cabin is the biggest and bulkiest of all the cabins. It has polished bronze doors that shimmer like a hologram, and have lightning bolts streaked down them. The dome-shaped ceiling is decorated with moving mosaics of a cloudy sky and thunderbolts. It also rumbles with the growl of thunders all the time. There used to not be furniture, but after the two camps merged, there is now furniture that looks like the Iris cabin furniture, except that the furniture is storm cloud-like, and lightning backings, arms, etc. There is also a big statue of Zeus, and the ceiling is dome-shaped, with mosaics enchanted to move, looking like a cloudy sky, that streaks with lightning, and also, every time a lightning bolt streaks across the ceiling, thunder rumbles throughout the cabin.\n\nPowers and traits[]\n\nChildren of Zeus have the power of Aerokinesis, or wind control.\n\nChildren of Zeus have the power of Electrokinesis, or electricity control.\n\nChildren of Zeus have the power of Atmokinesis, or weather control.\n\nChildren of Zeus can communicate with eagles and other avian creatures.\n\nChildren of Zeus are generally able to predict the weather.\n\nChildren of Zeus tend to have good leadership qualities, as their father is the king of the gods.\n\nChildren of Zeus rarely suffer from acrophobia (fear of heights).\n\nChildren of Zeus sometimes may have superhuman strength.\n\nChildren of Zeus also are naturally more athletic than the normal demigod\n\nHera Cabin[]\n\nThe Hera Cabin is the honorary cabin for Hera/Juno, Greek/Roman queen of the gods and goddess of marriage, women, motherhood, and familial love.\n\nClaiming and cabin[]\n\nWhen Hera/Juno chooses/claims her champions/children, a peacock feather appears over their head.\n\nHera's cabin is made entirely out of marble. It is the second largest cabin. It has four pillars in the front and they are all wrapped with ivy that has pomegranates growing on it. The doors gleam in the sun and have a carving of a peacock feather on it. The inside only has a few bunk beds. There are carvings of peacocks, lions, and cows all on the walls. There is a small in-ground fountain in the middle of the cabin.\n\nPowers and Traits[]\n\nChampions of Hera usually do not get along with Zeus, and hold some sort of disdain for him.\n\nJealously and insecurity are the fatal flaws of most of her children.\n\nChildren of Hera are very helpful with the imminent birth of a child, being able to ease the pain of a expecting mother, and know how to handle situations like a breached birth or water suddenly breaking properly and safely, making them excellent midwives. They are also the least likely to pass out during the child-birthing process.\n\nGiven that Hera sired a demigod due to affairs with mortals, Zeus happens to dislike children of Hera when ironically he had sired several demigod behind Hera's back. However, he cannot destroy them as Hera would step down as queen of Olympus should Zeus kill them, indirectly or otherwise, and swears this on the Styx. However, it is easier for daughters of Hera to win Zeus' favor given their step-father's skirt chasing nature.\n\nChildren of Hera are very good tacticians and strategists, but not quite as the same level of skill as the children of Athena in terms of planning and are highly observant. Children of Hera usually tend to make observations of the person's strengths and weaknesses, and tend to use that person's strengths and weaknesses against them. This can apply to not just one, but multiple people. This is especially useful during \" capture the flag\" from the team they side with.\n\nChildren of Hera tend to be dazzlingly beautiful. They like to be up to speed on the latest fashion trend, trend to be flashy when they do not need to be. This is very true for daughters, and some sons, of Hera, who are incredibly fussy over how they appear to other demigods, and nitpick over the most minute of details if it does not meet up to their standard. Children of Hera are usually spoiled in their upbringing. Some grew out of this attitude, some do not. Regardless of their gender, children of Hera have a tendency to act like a huge drama Kings or Queens.\n\nEnemy cabins - You could argue that the Zeus and Hera cabins would be friendly with each other because now Hera has children outside of her marriage too, but it’s still quite unlikely. Hera’s children would likely have enemies in the Zeus, Apollo, Artemis (as in the Hunters of Artemis), Hephaestus and Athena cabins. All of these are for relatively obvious reasons. Apollo and Artemis wouldn’t care for Hera or her kids due to her curse on their mother, Leto. Hephaestus’ cabin would probably not care for Hera’s due to her throwing their father off of Mount Olympus for being ugly. Athena was always Zeus’ favorite child, and I’d imagine that Hera would be especially salty about it since Athena wasn’t her child.\n\nAllied Cabins - It is likely that children of Hera would be allied with the Ares and Aphrodite cabins. Ares was Hera’s favorite immortal child, and Aphrodite kids seem like they would get along with Hera’s children for the most part. There aren’t any super big conflicts between Hera or Aphrodite to note either, just the whole Trojan War thing, yah know? It’s also possible that cabin 2 would befriend the Poseidon, Demeter, Hades, and (hypothetical) Hestia cabins. This is because they are Hera’s siblings, and she never had many qualms with any of them.\n\nPersonalities- children of Hera would likely be quite nitpicky and controlling, and would get frustrated when things don't go their way. They would be quite the perfectionist and would plan every day, night, event, etc. to the tiniest piece of pollen on the fake flower at the door. Children of Hera would also be pretty easy to make angry, especially if you insult and/or attack those that he or she cares for. Jealously and insecurity are the children of Hera fatal flaw.\n\nchildren of Hera can be sometimes motherly\n\nChildren of Hera have minor aerokinesis and can glide very long distances, so long as there is any sort of breeze.\n\nChildren of Hera can manipulation love, making others love each other deeply.\n\nChildren of Hera can detect love from anywhere causing to love that particular relationship.\n\nChildren of Hera can force others to love each other.

The outer walls are rough gray stone with pieces of seashell and coral and look like the bottom of the ocean floor. On the inside, it has six empty bunk beds and the walls glow like abalone. with bronze hippocampi hanging from the ceiling, strange aquatic plants on the windowsills, walls that glow like abalone, and a giant fountain that the campers can use to send Iris messages.

There are sunflowers and hyacinths in vases in the windows. Beds line the sides of the cabin and cots with medical tables are in the center.

(It's like shadow travel but only with light).\n\nChildren of Apollo can touch a person and get a sense of what state their body is in (such as identifying organ damage). They can also use this to know the patient's heart rate and blood type.\n\nSome children of Apollo can transfer pain between people with physical contact, meaning that they can take the pain away from their patients and take it on instead as long as they are touching them. If a third party is also in contact with the child of Apollo, the pain can be transferred to them, too. This is useful when it is evenly distributed between people, meaning that one person is not in critical pain.\n\nTheir father being a light god, they can see well in brightness and tend to remain unaffected by powerful lights or the sun.\n\nIn times of great distress, some can scream loud enough to deafen or kill opponents, though this is difficult to use around allies, as it could hurt them.\n\nWhen joining hands, they can sing songs in Ancient Greek to cause harm. Depending on the song, different things will happen (see: hymns).\n\nSome of Apollo's offspring have piercing whistles that can stun opponents (such as Will Solace).\n\nSometimes, their moods can affect the health of those around them.

No one can enter their dome without feeling intense dehydration, and have the ability to faint. People cannot look into the dome so the user can effectively conceal themselves in plain sight.\n\nChildren of Apollo are able to foresee potential future attacks, allowing them a short span of time to prepare for these attacks.\n\nChildren of Apollo can teleport themselves by manipulating light photons. Essentially, it’s them moving at the speed at which light travels, but using the light itself to help them travel and travel through objects that light can pass through. They need to be careful to not attempt to travel anywhere that has something that blocks light, because it will immediately halt their travel.\n\nChildren of Apollo can create massive waves of heat and radiation that can span a large area around them. This can cause people to get heat stroke, dehydrate quicker, and if close enough to the user, cause hallucinations. The longer this power is used, the less hot it becomes, until the user simply runs out of heat and energy.\n\nChildren of Apollo are able to manipulate music in their head to play outside of themselves, and amplify it in different places in the surrounding areas, so much so, that they create shock waves from those areas. This essentially allows them to create miniature music explosions capable of blowing people away. They have to be able to visualize the area in which they're sending the music. No one is immune to the sound so this could cause potential danger to themselves and their allies. The more they use this power, the more exhausted they become.\n\nChildren of Apollo can sometimes fly.\n\nChildren of Apollo can occasionally turn themselves invisible for long periods of time.\n\nChildren of Apollo often have the power Hypnokinesis, but not to the extent of Morpheus's children.\n\nSome children of Apollo have retractable fangs.\n\nChildren of Apollo mimic some wolf behaviors.\n\nThere are many different hymns that the Apollo children learn to use certain magic. By singing these together, they can strengthen their effects. However, the more powerful the hymn, the more energy it drains from the singer.

Although Artemis is a maiden goddess, her huntresses do count as inhabitants, when they visit. The cabin also houses the children of Hunters (all of these children were born the their mother's before their dams joined the hunt and were adopted into the hunters as Artemis's adopted children and gained some of the )\n\nClaiming and cabin[]\n\nWhen Artemis/Diana claims her adopted children, a moon with a bow and arrows appears over the child's head.\n\nThe cabin itself looks like a normal wooden cabin during the day, but at night, it takes on a silvery-white glow. On the inside, the cabin is silvery colored, the walls are covered in various animal pelts, and the blankets on the beds are also pelts. It is decorated with images of wild animals, and animal tracks appear on the floor from time to time. Each bed comes with a silver canopy.\n\nHuntress: Powers and traits[]\n\nThese powers are for the huntresses as a whole, and they also leave out each maiden's original powers, if any.\n\nHunters of Artemis tend to have a silvery aura around themselves.\n\nHunters of Artemis are extremely proficient at archery, even more so than the Apollo kids.\n\nHunters of Artemis are semi-immortal, which means that they do not age or get sick, but they can die in battle, or if they break their vow.\n\nHunters of Artemis have a telepathic connection with wolves and falcons.\n\nHunters of Artemis can summon their bows and arrows, and their hunting knives, whenever they need them, but it is tiresome.\n\nHunters of Artemis have excellent night vision, so much so, that they can see as well at nighttime as they can in the daytime.\n\nHunters of Artemis tend to have enhanced strength, agility, and dexterity.\n\nHunters of Artemis are skilled hunters,as they hunt monsters with Artemis.\n\nAdopted Children: Powers and traits[]\n\nBecause adopted children of Artemis are often raised and trained by their mother's in the hunt, no matter what their gender, their hunting prowess and abilities far exceeds that of her Hunters but they just pale in comparison to their virgin adopted mother/aunt.\n\nAny and all adopted children of Artemis would not be a result of intercourse after their mothers joining of the Hunters, but rather would be children who lost their fathers but not their mothers. Commonly, these children's fathers died and their mothers loved their husbands so much they could not bare dishonoring their memories by marrying again and became Hunters.\n\nWhen it comes to sexual intercourse, adopted children of Artemis are painfully shy about it because their mother is a virgin goddess. They even have the ability to detect when someone is a virgin or not.\n\nWhile respected by the Hunt because of their skills and status as their mother's child, sons of Hunters are generally distrusted by the Hunt (except for Thalia, who essentially is often their godmother at Artemis' request) due to the simple fact of being male. With that said, Thalia will protect them from harassment or danger from any antagonistic Hunters. Daughters of Artemis are more trusted by them simply because they are female.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis would be subject to their adopted mother/aunt's wrath, just like anybody else if they killed one of her Hunters, especially without a reason.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis are exceptionally passionate about the wild, animals, and nature as a whole because their mothers are the maidens of a nature Goddess. If any animal is abused or harmed right before their eyes, they become extremely livid and will brutally slay the offender.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis get very defensive when someone lustfully eyes their mother, male or female. Sons of Artemis especially hate when someone tries to flirt with their mother, and can go off the deep end about it.\n\nOnce a adopted child of Artemis has found the perfect mate and lover for them, they will generally remain faithful to their lover.\n\nAdopted children of Artemis, like their mother's adopted sister, often inherit the signature auburn hair and silver colored eyes Artemis possesses.\n\nBy default, adopted children of Artemis are automatically given their mother's blessing once they are claimed, giving them the same benefits as the Hunters and making them two times more powerful than the Hunters. They cannot die from natural causes or aging and will remain eternally young until they decide not to have their step-mother's blessing. However, children of the Hunters of Artemis are not bound by oath to spurn love.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis do not get along at all with children of Aphrodite, given their mother's leader's conflicts with Aphrodite and Aphrodite's attempt to meddle with the love lives of the Hunters.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis can use moonlight as a means of teleportation and appear anywhere so long as moonlight can shine in that location, known as \"lunar-travelling\" which functions identically to shadow travelling.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis possess lunakinesis, manipulation of the moon and its' light as their step-mother/aunt has divine authority over the moon. They can even create arrows made out of silvery moonlight, which never fail to hit their target unless an outside force intervenes. They are also more powerful when the moon shines on them, and they can use moonlight to communicate with anyone, esp. their patron and other lunar gods.\n\nAdopted children of Artemis can heal at an accelerated rate if they are bathed in moonlight, as well as move faster and hit harder.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis have the ability to communicate with and understand stags, hawks, and wolves given that they are their patron's sacred animals. They can also understand other wildlife.\n\nLike their patron, adopted children of Artemis can utter a blessing in ancient Greek to make two more of a species of animal that was slain by them.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis have the ability to temporarily shift anyone into a jackalope for a day.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis can fire lasers of moonlight from their eyes, just like their patron can do. It works identically to heat vision.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis can create large constructs from moonlight, generally in the shape of a stag or doe, as a means of communication or offense, but the construct can only be twice the size of the user. The larger the construct, the more power it requires from the child. They are also masterful at using lunar-based attacks.\n\nOnly when moonlight is present, meaning this does not work on a night of the New Moon, adopted children of Artemis can create wings of silvery light to fly. They can even give temporary wings to other people. This fails if the child is too weak or too hungry.\n\nLike their patron's father, children of Artemis possess minor atmokinesis and are partially immune to lightning. They can also redirect or reflect lightning back at the sender but they cannot completely control the bolt's path.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis have the ability to turn anyone into the opposite sex of what they currently are, but only temporarily, like their patron did to Sipriotes.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis are incredibly gifted fighters, and are exceptional in the art of dagger-fighting, much like their patron and often their mothers.\n\nWhen it comes to children of Orion, Adopted Children of Artemis are generally in either one of two feelings about them: either they do not really care for the demi-giants given Orion's attack on the Hunters of Artemis, but respect their skill all the same as it rivals children of Artemis's followers's skills, or they become fast friends (and potentially lovers) just like Artemis and Orion once were before he was slain by Apollo.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis can use the moon's gravity to weigh down an opponent and hinder their mobility, or they can make themselves more nimble by lessening the gravity around them. They also have a degree of hydrokinesis in that they can control the tides to be higher or lower than normal because the moon is related to tidal forces.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis have night vision that allows them to see in even the darkest night.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis have the ability to temporarily shed their human form and become raw moonlight. Anyone or anything that touches them while they are in this form will burn up. Also, their lunakinetic abilities and lunakinetic combat becomes three times more powerful than it already is. They will also heal from injuries at thrice the normal rate and larger ones at twice the normal speed if exposed to moonlight. If this form is maintained for longer than 3 hours, they will return to their human form and either become unable to move or collapse from exhaustion.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis can infuse a weapon with moonlight to make it deal more damage. The infusion can last until the next morning.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis can also use moonlight to heal their allies. However, the more serious the injuries are, the more energy and concentration it requires to restore them. If they use this ability too many times within a day, they will eventually be unable to even conjure a single ball of moonlight, let alone keep their eyes open.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis are immune to lunar attacks from other demigods who use lunakinetic combat, and can absorb any lunar energy that is thrown their way and either use it to heal, as ammunition for their own attacks, or send it back to the attacker at double the power.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis can use Chlorokensis and have control from a forests tallest trees to it's grass.\n\nAdopted Children of Artemis are often drawn to loners and are known for adopting and caring for injured strays such as dogs, panthers, owls, wolves and small dragons, all of whom they are able to tame easilier than most..\n\nHephaestus cabin[]\n\nThe Hephaestus Cabin is the cabin for the children of Hephaestus/Vulcan, Greek/Roman god of blacksmiths, volcanoes, and fire.\n\nClaiming and cabin[]\n\nWhen Hephaestus/Vulcan claims his children, a fiery hammer appears over the child's head.\n\nHephaestus' Cabin is constructed of brick, and has a smokestack sticking out of it, mimicking a miniature factory.
