        "text": "Compaq Computer Corp., Intel Capital and DB Capital Partners Inc., will make a combined investment of $115 million in Stratus Technologies Inc., a maker of fault-tolerant computing systems.\n\nThe investment will be in the form of a preferred stock purchase. The shares will be acquired from Investcorp., a global investment company that is the majority shareholder in Stratus. Stratus and Investcorp will retain majority control of the company, said Stephen C. Kiely, president and CEO of Stratus.\n\nAlso today, the company announced technology collaboration agreements with Compaq and Intel Corp. Under the agreements, Compaq will license and use Stratus’ fault-tolerant technology in upcoming server products. Intel and Stratus, meanwhile, will work close together to use Intel technology for fault-tolerant computing, Kiely said.\n\nThe partnerships should help Stratus significantly expand its market reach and visibility, Kiely said.\n\n“We are today a $320 million company in an industry dominated by companies 100 times our size,” Kiely said. “We concluded that our maximum impact and value delivery to our customers will occur when we become part of the product stream of a major industry player.”\n\nApart from Compaq and Intel, Stratus already has an existing licensing relationship with NEC Technologies of Japan.\n\nThough such licensing deals will form a core part of Stratus’ sales strategy going forward, the company will also continue to make and sell servers under its own brand name, Kiely said.\n\nStratus Technologies is an umbrella company based in Luxembourg that owns Stratus Computer of Maynard, Mass., and a separate intellectual property licensing division of Stratus. All these businesses were originally a part of Stratus Computer Inc., which was acquired by Ascend Communications Inc., — now a part of Lucent Technologies Inc. — in 1998.\n\nSoon after the acquisition, Stratus’ fault-tolerant computer business was cut loose to operate as a privately financed, independent company with the same name. Fault-tolerant software is designed to prevent the loss of data during failures and to manage tasks such as forced switchovers from a failed system. The goal is to detect hardware problems that are about to shut down a system and quickly redistribute the workload to other systems."
