        "text": "By LAURA M. HOLSON\n\nscend Communications, the Alameda, Calif., maker of networking equipment, is expected to announce Monday morning that it will acquire Stratus Computer Inc. for about $1 billion in stock, a person close to the talks said.\n\nBoth boards met and approved the deal Sunday, the person said. Stratus is a Marlboro, Mass.-based maker of computers designed to run continuously for customers such as banks and telephone companies.\n\nSome analysts suggest that Ascend is attracted to Stratus's technology to allow telephone carriers to offer services like caller ID or call forwarding over data networks. It is believed that Ascend will spin off Stratus's nontelecommunications businesses.\n\nAscend's stock took a pounding on Friday -- down 14 percent for the day -- when rumors surfaced that the company was interested in Stratus.\n\nInvestors were concerned that any acquisition by Ascend would be dilutive to its earnings. Last year Ascend struggled with slow demand and delayed customer purchases.\n\nFor months Ascend itself has been rumored to be an acquisition target, either by Ericsson A.B. or Lucent Technologies.\n\nThe company is expected to have sales of $1.4 billion in 1998.\n\nStratus, for its part, has seen its stock tumble from a high of $60.75 in September to close at $28.875 on Friday.\n\nThe Asian economic crisis has pared business among its customers. The company lost $10 million in the most recent quarter and saw sales fall 20 percent.\n\nIn July it announced that it would cut 350 jobs, or 15 percent of its work force, because of a second-quarter loss.\n\nRelated Sites\n\nFollowing are links to the external Web sites mentioned in this article.
