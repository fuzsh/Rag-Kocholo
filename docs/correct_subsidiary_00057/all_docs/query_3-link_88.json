Ascend Communications International implemented variable speed drives (VSDs) on eight air handling units (AHUs) at their Dublin facility to improve energy efficiency. \n2. A test of VSDs on one AHU showed average load reduction from 26kW to 9kW, a 65% savings. VSDs were expected to provide similar savings on all eight AHUs.\n3. Financial analysis showed the VSD project paid for itself in one year through energy savings of £31,200 per year, £823 in reduced heat gain, and £1,160 in maintenance savings, for a total annual savings of £33,183. The installation cost was £33,400.",
