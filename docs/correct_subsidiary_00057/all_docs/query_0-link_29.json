        "text": "Investcorp is to acquire a 79 per cent stake in a US telecommunications company for $135 million, the Bahrain-based investment bank announced on 21 December. The deal involves Independent Wireless One Corporation (IWO), a network partner of Sprint PCS in the northeast of the US. The remaining21 per cent of the company will be owned by the founders of IWO, who include a number of leading independent regional telephone companies in the northeast.\n\nIn a statement, Investcorp management committee member Salman Abbasi said: 'This investment...provides Investcorp with a significant addition to its growing portfolio in the technology, telecom and other rapid growth sectors.' He said the affiliation with Sprint PCS, which he described as the fastest-growing wireless communications provider in the US, gives IWO 'a tremendous foundation'.\n\nThe deal is Investcorp's second acquisition of the year in the US technology sector. In January, it bought the Stratus Enterprise Computer Division from networking group Ascend Communications (MEED 22:1:99). The new buy follows the sale of Investcorp's stakes in two Swiss watchmakers and a French jeweller in September and October (MEED 29:10:99)."
