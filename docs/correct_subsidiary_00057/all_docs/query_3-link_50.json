        "text": "Borrowing from Japanese practices, U.S. manufacturers have cut their production and component costs dramatically in the last decade by overhauling their supplier bases. They have radically pruned the ranks of their suppliers and given more work to the survivors in return for lower prices. And by getting their remaining suppliers to deliver parts just in time and to take responsibility for quality, they have managed to slash inventories, reduce defects, and greatly improve the efficiency of their own production lines."
