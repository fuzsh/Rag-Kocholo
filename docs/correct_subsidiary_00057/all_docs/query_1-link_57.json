        "text": "Ascend Communications CEO Mory Ejabat plans to sell as much as US$4.75 million worth of his company's shares, just as the stock is hovering nearing a 12-month high and as speculation swirls that Ascend is about to make a big acquisition.\n\nEarlier this week and on 17 July, Ejabat filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission showing that he plans to sell a total of 90,000 Ascend shares. It's unclear whether he has sold any yet.\n\nEjabat's decision comes at a time when Ascend's stock is recovering from a yearlong lull. It also comes amid reports that Ascend is about to announce plans to buy Stratus Computer for about $800 million, an acquisition that could affect Ascend's earnings and stock.\n\nSix calls to Ascend's public relations department went unanswered. Ejabat's assistant referred calls back to public relations.\n\nAscend (ASND) makes telecommunication devices that shuffle information through computer and telephone networks. The company's stock began to descend last August from about $55 to a low of $22 in November, when the company warned of slowing growth because of Asia's economic woes and its own marketing missteps. Ascend also had trouble swallowing Cascade Communications, a rival networking firm it bought in June 1997.\n\nSince January, Ascend's stock has been recovering.\n\nBut on Friday, Ascend shares fell after Bloomberg News and the San Jose Mercury News reported that Ascend is about to buy computer maker Stratus (SRA).\n\nAscend shares closed down $7.03, or 14 percent, at $44.47 on the Nasdaq. Stratus rose 88 cents to $28.88.\n\nEjabat has been selling shares regularly for the past few months. In May, April, and February, he sold 50,000 shares each month, according to insider selling tracker CDA/Investnet.\n\nDonald Trump and Silicon Valley's Billionaire Elegy\n\nVenture capitalists Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen claim the tech industry, California, and the country are doomed if we don’t embrace the former president.\n\nRealPage Says Rental Pricing Tech Is Misunderstood, but Landlords Aren’t So Sure\n\nThe software company has pushed back hard against claims that its algorithms helped make rent in the US too damn high. Property owners and managers aren't entirely convinced.\n\nApple, Nvidia, Anthropic Used Thousands of Swiped YouTube Videos to Train AI\n\nCreators claim their videos were used without their knowledge.\n\nOpenAI Slashes the Cost of Using Its AI With a ‘Mini’ Model\n\nWith competing models—including many free ones—flooding the market, OpenAI is announcing a cheaper way to use its AI.\n\nHow to Get Rich From Peeping Inside People’s Fridges\n\nForget the S&P 500. Look at the ice cream. This investor visits homes around the world to see where diets—and economies—will go next."
