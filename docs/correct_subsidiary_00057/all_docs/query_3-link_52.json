For this installment, we talk to Jacquelyn Horton at Contact Climbing—the recipient of the most nomination votes for CBJ’s 2021 Business Leaders survey. Horton had a background in the hospitality industry before opening the gym, and found some interesting parallels. “Really good hospitality, in my opinion, is simply caring for others. And the indoor climbing gym industry, though not exactly the same as a high end resort or restaurant, isn’t actually that far off,” Horton says. We wanted to learn more about that idea, the gym’s opening, and the specifics of its environmental mission. Here’s what Horton had to say. Name: Jacquelyn Horton Title: Gym Manager / Co-Founder of Contact Climbing Location: St. George, Utah\n\nCBJ: Contact Climbing is your first venture into founding and managing a gym. Now that you’ve been at it for a while, what stands out as the aspect that surprised you the most?\n\nHORTON: This question is a little hard to answer—I don’t honestly think I was surprised much. Being the first time I’ve done something quite like this, I allowed myself a lot of grace to make mistakes. I knew what my strengths were, and I knew that I’d spend a lot of time trying things, making mistakes, trying new things, and switching it up if we needed. I also leaned on my team pretty heavily. Accumulatively, they have decades more climbing gym experience than I did—and still do—and I’m happy to ask for help…and I’m comfortable admitting when I’m wrong or that I don’t have the answer. Coming from a background of fast-paced, high-end restaurants, we’re groomed to make decisions on the fly or pivot entirely if necessary. I spent a lot of time during our first year open listening to people, trusting our team, and respecting their experiences and opinions. It has allowed me to be open to learning, open to making mistakes, and consequently impervious to things that might surprise some people. Every day was a new adventure and a new opportunity to learn and grow and I loved every second of it.\n\nWhat have been the most challenging parts of that whole process?\n\nThe opening process was really tough because there is literally only a finite amount of money and you have to take whatever you have (and odds are, it won’t be enough) and you have to find a way to hire enough of the right people and pay them enough to get them to join you in opening a business. We didn’t know how busy we’d be or how many people we’d need—and if we’d have too many people or not enough. In our situation, we didn’t have enough money to pay people the wages they deserved upon opening and I couldn’t just magically make that number higher. What I did to combat this is I took every opportunity to ensure that my team knew that they mattered most to me. I worked extremely hard to ensure that they knew that I would do everything in my power to get them to a place they were happy with as fast as possible. We were fortunate to be able to give everyone raises fairly quickly, but they could still very easily find a job elsewhere that paid much better. I sincerely don’t believe though that they would be able to find a manager who appreciated their individual talents as much as I do, and this carries so much weight in a society who is working harder and harder to prioritize their happiness.\n\nSo, based on your experiences thus far, what makes a good climbing gym manager?\n\nThe thing we can do best as managers in any business is care for our staff—I mean sincerely care about the unique well-being of every individual. This helps with every aspect of running and managing a business, and frankly makes every aspect of my job easier. I am surrounded daily by people who know that I truly care about who they are and the things that are important to them, and it has consequently allowed me to be surrounded by people who I know also care about me and each other. We spend a lot of time sharing experiences about some of the cool things that have happened to us in and out of the gym, and we celebrate each other and our successes daily. We also talk a lot about our challenges in and out of the gym. We check in on each other and our struggles physically, emotionally and mentally, and I do the best I can to ensure that the team know that this place is one where they can seek refuge from the trials of normal life. Our climbing gym is a safe space to come in and be happy or sad or depressed or anxious or anything else our team might be feeling. I work exceptionally hard to ensure that the team know that I will support them no matter what trials they might be going through and that I want them to feel safe coming as they are. Nothing, in my opinion, is more important than this.\n\nContact Climbing has more of an overt environmentally conscious mission than most other gyms. What prompted that—and can you explain some of the specifics?\n\nWhen we began the process of building and opening Contact, I knew pretty early on that I wanted to run the operational side of the gym and I wanted to make sure that I was proud to be there every day. This sense of pride, for me, is linked to many things, but a large factor is the impact we’re making on the environment. There are so many simple and easy actions we can take to ensure that we’re doing our part…for example, having only hand dryers in bathrooms in lieu of paper towels, and not selling any single use plastic bottles. We have multiple water bottle filling stations and sell Nalgenes, as well as only sell beverages in containers that are recyclable. There’s always more we can do to ensure that we’re being thoughtful about our environmental footprint, but these are some of the items that I find are the simplest to implement and send a clear message about who we are and what’s important to us.\n\nBeyond Contact, are you of the opinion that the gym industry is on the right track, in terms of how most managers are operating their gyms?\n\nI definitely don’t want to use this as an opportunity to glorify myself, but a lot of my current team have previously worked at other climbing gyms and/or are exceptional in their fields. I’ve consequently heard many stories and it seems to be a pretty common theme that people don’t feel respected, paid well enough, and/or are incredibly overworked. I think all of these problems boil down to the disconnect between the people working at and/or running the gym and the people who make the rules and sign the checks. Do the managers and owners know what it feels like to sit in a harness all day routesetting, or how tough it can be to teach an entire family how to belay, or how defeating it might feel to have an adult man tell a young woman that she shouldn’t dare correct his belaying because she clearly doesn’t have as much climbing experience as him? These are common occurrences—and I can think of 100 more difficult examples off the top of my head—and they’re pains that I don’t believe many managers and owners have felt or really truly understand. Granted, I know I’m generalizing, but as a manager or owner, when is the last time you set a route or taught a belay instruction or attempted to correct an exceptionally difficult guest? When your staff are struggling through some of these pains, where are you? I can tell you that odds are I am, or one of my other managers or supervisors are, close enough by that that person can turn around and ask for help. I also understand that there isn’t always money to pay people more, and that sometimes businesses are understaffed. But having the most utmost respect for your team and being willing to pick up any slack and being willing to work alongside them helps ease those pains until you can be in a position to pay people their worth. Also, saying the words, “Hey Jess, I appreciate you,” could—and should—happen more. We should never ever assume that our team knows we appreciate them.\n\nTRUBLUE iQ+ “Catch-and-Hold” Launched\n\nLouisville, CO – May 18, 2022 – Head Rush Technologies (Head Rush), a global leader in the engineering, manufacturing, and distribution of recreational climbing equipment, is launching the TRUBLUE iQ+ Auto Belay, the first and only auto belay in the world equipped with catch-and-hold technology. The TRUBLUE iQ+ marks the largest leap forward in auto belay innovation in over a decade. As opposed to previous auto belays, which immediately lower climbers back to the ground when they fall, the TRUBLUE iQ+ makes it possible for climbers of all abilities to choose whether they want to lower after a fall or if they want the device to catch them so that they can try the move again. “It’s frustrating to start over every time you fall,” said Luke Smith, Senior Product Development Engineer at Head Rush. “So rather than lowering back down, what climbers will do is call, ‘Take!’ Basically, this gives them time to rest before making another attempt. Climbers do this all the time when they’re climbing with a partner, but until now it hasn’t been possible on an auto belay. That’s what makes the TRUBLUE iQ+ so exciting! Climbers can really push their limits.” Although it might sound complicated, in practice the TRUBLUE iQ+ is actually very easy to use. At the base of the wall, there is a large button. When a climber presses this button, the catch-and-hold feature becomes activated. If at any point during the climb that climber should fall, the TRUBLUE iQ+ will immediately catch them and allow up to 30 seconds to rest and then resume climbing. When the climber makes it to the top, a second button will lower them back down again. “One of my favorite things about the iQ+ is that it gives everyone the chance to make it to the top,” said Smith. “It’s not just designed for experienced climbers looking to push their grades. Beginning climbers, who might never have been able to get very high before, can now take as many rests as they need to feel that sense of accomplishment.” While being able to ‘take’ has always been an option for gym climbers who are used to being belayed by either a trusted climbing partner or trained staff member, Head Rush President and CEO Lea Ann Zuellig is quick to point out that the traditional belay method is not a reality in many modern facilities. Climbing walls in most family entertainment centers, for example, are exclusively accessible via auto belay. “Twenty years ago, no one would have dreamed that climbing would be as widespread as it is today,” said Zuellig. “But with this latest boom in popularity, everyone wants to try it for themselves. Whether they go to a gym, a fun climb, a camp, or a rec center, the truth is that most of these facilities simply don’t have the staff or the space to accommodate so many new climbers. That’s where auto belays can really make an enormous impact.” Zuellig points to the launch of the TRUBLUE iQ+ as a significant event in continuing to grow the popularity of the sport. Auto belays are already known to increase membership, retention rates, and user throughput, while helping to reduce traffic jams and overcrowding, particularly during busy times. They also greatly reduce the barrier to entry for new users. The one thing that previous auto belay models couldn’t do was give climbers an authentic belay experience in the same way that a climbing partner could. With the launch of the TRUBLUE iQ+, that is about to change. “I can’t tell you how excited I am about this launch,” said Zuellig. “Most of the time, when companies put out a new product, it’s more or less the same as the old one. In this case, that couldn’t be further from the truth. There has never been a device like this before. The TRUBLUE iQ+ will completely change the way that people think about auto belays.” About Head Rush Technologies Based in Louisville, Colorado, Head Rush Technologies is an engineering company and manufacturer of climbing, zip line, and free fall equipment that is on a mission to make adventure experiences more enjoyable for users and to increase ROI for operators. Their patented magnetic braking system has led to the development of best-in-class recreational devices found in facilities worldwide, including the TRUBLUE Auto Belay (the Official Auto Belay of Team USA Climbing), zipSTOP Zip Line Brake, and QuickFlight Free Fall devices.

The announcement coincided with a celebration of the original gym’s five-year anniversary, “a big party” that included games, pop-up tattoo artists and live music. According to Josh Muller, owner and operator of Bolder, their first location became too small to fit the needs of the growing climbing community. “Our gym is really busy right now,” Muller explained. “We need more space, so we thought why not go for it and open a second location!” He noted an expansion in Calgary also made sense from a managerial standpoint, so he could be close to both gyms while supporting “the growth of the community.” The second facility, dubbed Bolder 2.0 in the announcement post, is expected to open in the fall or winter this year. “We are really looking forward to trying to make this gym special! We want the experience to be unique, big, bright and stylish,” said Muller. Part of that plan is balancing non-climbing related fun, such as DJ Nights, with hard training. Training amenities in the gym include a large campus board, spray wall, multiple training boards (Moon, Kilter and Grasshopper), hangboards and weights. As for the climbing, Bolder 2.0 will add roped offerings to Bolder’s mix, with top rope and lead walls reaching 40 feet and a 10-meter speed wall. The new gym will also have a pro shop, food and beverage, and treatment rooms. Muller also hopes to continue much of Bolder’s programming at the new location, and keep working to ensure all climbers have a seat at the table. “At Bolder we have a DEI committee as well as a very active indigenous climber/friend who together have applied for grants with the CEC to host more events that help bring indigenous people into climbing,” Muller said. “Through that process we have started a regular indigenous climbing night where we support local indigenous communities to come climbing.” Additional programming at Bolder includes a Ladies night, personal coaching and various clinics, as well as competitive youth teams.

In this first installment, author Devin Dabney―a previous head setter himself at Nike Rock Gym, co-founder and host of the American Climbing Project, and all-around jack-of-all-trades in the climbing industry―catches up with North Mass Boulder’s Head Routesetter and longtime friend Thomas Bonifield about the popular RIC Scale and how to leverage it in your routesetting work. Want more routesetting content? Be sure to check out our Ask a Setter and Behind the Wrench series as well. Grades in climbing have always been a frequently discussed subject―especially in a routesetting space—and one of the things that makes grading challenging is a lack of language around how to describe climbs. Simply saying a climb feels “hard,” “easy” or even “crimpy” doesn’t encapsulate the complexities that comprise climbing, and breaking down those intricacies can go beyond hold choice, style and wall angle too. As the routesetting profession continues to develop, the need for more precise, intelligible conversation around grades becomes more and more necessary―which is likely what led to the RIC Scale’s creation by setting legends Tonde Katiyo and Jacky Godoffe, who discuss the scale in the book My Keys to Routesetting. Possibly the most prominent tool used to talk about grades amongst setters, the RIC Scale can be a valuable resource for any commercial setting program―if you know how to use it. Thomas Bonifield knows this scale very well; he’s used it in commercial gyms, competitions and other setting events and, as the current Head Routesetter of North Mass Boulder in Indianapolis, he still uses it with his team today. When we first worked on the same setting team in 2014, such a scale was unknown to us, and we more or less had to rely on our best guesses. Needless to say, the setting profession is in a much different place eight years later, and I was excited to hear what he had to say.\n\nWhat Is the RIC Scale?\n\n“RIC represents three parameters: risk, intensity, and complexity,” explained Bonifield. “Each of these parameters can be assessed on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 5 being the highest value), and the result is a far more faceted assessment of a climb.” Bonifield also noted that these 1-5 RIC values are relative to the target audience, meaning that if a V3 climb is rated a 5 in Complexity, a V3 climber should find the problem particularly difficult to decode; climbers at the V1 or V5 levels, on the other hand, will have a completely different experience of that climb’s complexity. (While I will use boulder grades in my examples, the RIC Scale can also be used for roped climbs.) Additionally, the three RIC values can be averaged together to assess the overall difficulty of a problem on the same 1-5 scale (with 5 being a problem that’s incredibly difficult for the grade). For example, a climb with RIC values of 2-4-3 would average out to 3, meaning this climb has slightly above-average difficulty for the grade. ​​“It all depends on the level,” Bonifield said. “What’s easy for me may be hard for others and what’s hard for me may be easy for others. It goes back to talking about the user and their experience.” Below is a depiction of how assessing RIC might work, with some hypothetical boulders I set:\n\nAdjusting Risk, Intensity, Complexity\n\nAs a routesetter, understanding how to adjust these three factors in a climb is invaluable—whether you use the scale or not. Here are just a few ways to dial each parameter up and down:\n\nRisk\n\n“Risk is more of a mental challenge and focuses on the commitment level of the climber,” said Bonifield. It relates to how ‘scary’ a move feels, as well as how low-percentage the movement is or if the climb has a ‘point of no return’ where downclimbing on-route is unfavorable, or near-impossible. Some high-risk movements and climbing qualities include the following: dynos; no-hands climbing; slippery, dual-textured footholds or handholds; low-percentage handholds, such as pockets or slots; sparse holds (particularly on a slab wall).\n\nIntensity\n\n“Intensity focuses on the physicality of a single move or entire boulder,” explained Bonifield. This is how most climbers describe ‘hard’ climbing; it solely relates to the physical ability, power or grit required to finish a climb. High-intensity climbing can focus on challenging holds—such as crimps, slopers, pockets or pinches—but it can also focus on how demanding the movement is. This can include arm-intensive movements such as lock-offs and campusing, or movements requiring flexibility such as high-steps, hand-foot matches and stemming.\n\nComplexity\n\nTo quote Bonifield, “Complexity focuses on the puzzle aspect of the boulder and how difficult it is to figure out.” This is not just about how complicated a climb’s sequence is, but how difficult that sequence is to execute. Coordination movements such as run-and-jumps or double clutches are often used in competition settings, but nuanced, specific footwork―such as heel hooks, toe hooks or backflags―are also common ways to add complexity. Setters can also make use of specific hand sequences that require bumps, crosses or rose moves.\n\nUsing the RIC Scale in Commercial Setting\n\nThere are several advantages to using the RIC Scale in commercial setting environments—both for your setting teams and the end-users. Bonifield and I discussed a few ways to leverage this tool at your gym:\n\n1. Keep Everyone on the Same Page\n\nCommunication is key for routesetting quality control, and oftentimes as routesetters we work with setters we’re only meeting for the first time—be it for gym openings, community events or competitive events. The RIC Scale can act as a Rosetta Stone for these interactions, allowing us to discuss climbs with other setters regardless of where we’re from. Bonifield just experienced this in February, when his gym hosted a USAC Divisionals Youth Competition. “We used it when we were setting the most recent youth divisional comp,” he told me. “The chief of the event wanted to use it as a tool to talk about boulders in a productive and efficient manner.”\n\n2. Challenge Your Teammates\n\nAnother big benefit to having the RIC Scale in your toolbox is its usefulness as an educational instrument for your setting team’s development. When reviewing his teammates’ climbs, for instance, Bonifield can see if they prefer a particular ‘style’ of setting based on their RIC values, and where they may have room to grow. As a head setter, I’ve done an exercise with my team where each person had to set their assigned climbs based on randomly-generated RIC values; this is not just a fun creative exercise, but one that also challenges setters to think differently about difficulty. (What does a low-risk/high-intensity climb look like, versus one that’s high-risk/low-intensity?)\n\n3. Revisit Your Grading\n\nThe RIC Scale also provides an opportunity to see your gym’s grading in a new light, and perhaps encourage a change in how some climbs are graded. For example, if you’re relying too heavily on intensity when choosing V grades, some V2s that are still more challenging in terms of risk and complexity may be better off as V3s. I’ve personally seen setters fall into this trap, setting problems that “feel” easy physically but have movements that are very risky for newer climbers (such as an ‘easy V2’ with a heel-toe cam—yes, that actually happened). “The RIC scale is used to help setters discuss and tweak climbs efficiently,” explained Bonifield. “It allows setters to step back from the conversation of a V-grade and go more in-depth about how risk, intensity, and complexity affect the difficulty of the boulder in regards to the user.”\n\n4. Balance Challenges Across Grades\n\nBonifield’s team not only uses the scale to discuss grades but also keeps meticulous track of the values in their setting distribution. “We currently use the scale when we are setting and planning for upcoming sets,” he explained. “At the end of the setting day, the RIC values are recorded in Plastick/Kaya to help look at the balance of each circuit.” This means that, as a head setter, Bonifield can observe not just how difficult each climb is, but the average difficulty of each grade range. He can see if the V2s are a little too stiff, if all the V7s focus on Intensity, or if the gym overall is lacking risk-heavy climbs.\n\n5. Target Specific User Groups\n\nWhen creating a climb for a target audience―whether new or more experienced climbers, youth comp team athletes or weekend warriors―setters must visualize the climb through the intended user’s eyes, and keep track of the things that will be challenging for the intended user’s ability level. For example, what a V0 climber considers as ‘risky’ or ‘complex’ will be vastly different than what a V8 climber thinks as such. “I think one of the pros of the RIC scale is that it focuses on the intended user, and helps setters look at how and why specific dimensions of the climb affect the difficulty level,” said Bonifield. “It goes back to talking about the user and their experience.”\n\n6. Pair It With Other Routesetting Language\n\nIt’s without question how useful this system is for discussing challenges, analyzing setting, and looking at a gym’s distribution. However, Thomas and I agree that in a regular day of setting, it’s not something that always comes up—or needs to. He made sure to emphasize it was not the only tool he and his team used. “I feel like RIC can leave out some other measurables…dynamic/static movement, force, technique, and coordination are a few other ways to discuss difficulty…but overall, it’s pretty easy to use. I think it’s useful as a conversation tool, but [it’s] not necessary all the time,” concluded Bonifield. While essential for any developing routesetter to know, it’s better used as a fine-toothed comb rather than a workhorse. We think it’s best to keep a balanced approach when discussing difficulty, but the RIC Scale is a pretty handy thing to have on your routesetting tool belt—almost as handy as a combined hex/star bit. Almost.\n\nAbout the Setter\n\nThomas Bonifield is the Head Routesetter of North Mass Boulder in Indianapolis, Indiana. He is primarily based in the Midwest, having set in over a dozen locations in that region over his decade-long setting career. He has helped open several gyms and has set for numerous USAC competitions, including the 2020 Youth Boulder Nationals. He loves being a leader in the setting world and is particularly passionate about breaking down barriers for routesetters of various genders, races, and backgrounds.

The Climbing Wall Association is our industry trade group. They were formed in 2003 with an initial focus of combining forces in this small industry to create a framework for defending our businesses when faced with litigation. From the beginning they have been a great risk management ally to climbing gym businesses. Since those humble beginnings they have expanded their focus in many new directions, and in 2007 they launched the CWA Summit. Previously always held in Colorado, the Summit has become the largest climbing industry gathering in North America. This year’s Summit looks like it will be the biggest and best ever! There are essentially two components: (a) education through presentations and workshops, and (b) exhibits of products and services.

The first was held in Berkeley, California, in 1990 and was organized by legendary climber Jeff Lowe. Unfortunately, the event’s financial shortcomings left America without another World Cup for nearly two decades, until the first Bouldering World Cup in Vail, Colorado, in 2008. Since then, aside from a pandemic delay in 2020, the U.S. has consistently held an IFSC Bouldering World Cup event every year. In 2021, the event moved to Salt Lake City and expanded to two separate Bouldering and one Speed World Cup, and the country’s first Paraclimbing World Cup took place in Los Angeles. This year the action will all be in SLC, with the Paraclimbing at The Front SLC and two Bouldering and two Speed World Cups hosted at Pioneer Park. As of this writing, tickets are still available for all events. A recent press release from USA Climbing about the forthcoming World Cups states, “Team USA will field a strong team with 2021 IFSC World Cup SLC Bouldering champions Sean Bailey and Natalia Grossman returning along with Olympic Team members Colin Duffy and Brooke Raboutou. Paraclimbing medalists Benjamin Mayforth and Hannah McFadden and Speed Climbing medalists Noah Bratschi and Emma Hunt are ready to shine in Salt Lake City.”\n\nCombined Schedule of Events\n\nHere is a summary of the main CWA Summit and IFSC World Cup events we are aware of.
