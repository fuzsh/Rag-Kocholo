Miller - Chairman of the Board, Chief Scientist and Founder\n\nDr. Miller founded Animetrics in 2002 with the idea of applying his imaging technology invention to facial biometrics. He is also currently the Director of Imaging Science at Johns Hopkins University. He is the Seder Professor of Biomedical Engineering and also a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. A recognized leader and pioneer in areas of image understanding, pattern theory, computer vision, medical imaging, and computational neuroscience, and is the co-inventor of Computational Anatomy. Dr. Miller has authored over one hundred peer-reviewed publications in magnetic resonance imaging, brain imaging, jump-diffusion processes in image understanding, and Computational Anatomy.\n\nIn 2002 Dr. Miller was recognized by ISI Essential Science Indicators for Citations in the Field of Engineering. In 2001 he was named International Man of the Year for contributions to Science by Cambridge Biographical. In 1986 Dr. Miller was one of fifty to one hundred young scientists selected by the National Science Foundation as a National Presidential Awardee for their future promise to the advancement of American Science. Dr. Miller received the Johns Hopkins Paul Ehrlich Graduate Student Thesis Award in 1983 and the national IEEE Biomedical Engineering Thesis Award first prize in 1982.\n\nAs Animetrics Chief Scientist Dr. Miller provides the IP, strategy and architecture for Animetrics research and development of the products.\n\nDr. Marc A. Vaillant - Chief Architect, Director Engineering\n\nDr. Vaillant joined Animetrics after completing his Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. His dissertation was on diffeomorphic surface matching and tangent space representations. Vaillant also received an MSE and BS in Biomedical Engineering. As a researcher at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Vaillant worked with Dr. Michael Miller on the design and implementation of surface matching algorithms and methodologies for cortical registration and analysis using spherical representations.\n\nDr. Vaillant is responsible for Animetrics core technologies, implementation and architecture strategy.\n\nSenior Staff\n\nDr. Guoqiang \"Gary\" Zang - Scientist\n\nDr. Zang joined Animetrics in February 2004 after completing his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.
